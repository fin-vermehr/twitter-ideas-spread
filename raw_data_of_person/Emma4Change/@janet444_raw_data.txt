970452555733008386 2018-03-04 00:14:54 UTC <janet444> @CBSNews She looks great!
970452112084783104 2018-03-04 00:13:08 UTC <janet444> @JaimeBlackNo_1 Love this. Not sure why it's so hard for so many "Christians" to understand.
970451842940456960 2018-03-04 00:12:04 UTC <janet444> Cool, this makes me like Jim Beam more, even though I'm not much of a drinker. I do like whiskey (a little weird for someone who drinks so little, I know, and I literally sip it from a shot glass, but I still like it).https://twitter.com/JimBeam/status/970443276913446914
970416767507009537 2018-03-04 21:52:41 UTC <janet444> @SenFeinstein I think we're getting there, thanks to the teens.
970415894357860357 2018-03-04 21:49:13 UTC <janet444> @PoliticalEmilia That one astounds me. To be triggered by a friendly, traditional greeting for no reason other than that it excludes nobody.
970413463230189569 2018-03-04 21:39:33 UTC <janet444> @newcivilrights Oh my, we wouldn't want that to happen. This must be what some conservatives mean when they accuse us of being "overly emotional." As in - caring about human lives.
970278533577789440 2018-03-04 12:43:23 UTC <janet444> @TomthunkitsMind https://www.snopes.com/did-sen-tom-cotton-issue-a-cease-and-desist-to-a-constituent/
970278522643275776 2018-03-04 12:43:21 UTC <janet444> @TomthunkitsMind I looked it up. According to Snopes, he sent it to some constituents, not all, But if these letters were truly threatening enough to warrant this, they should have been sent individually, with names. I don't think we should let ppl think this was sent to all constituents though.
970274712780615680 2018-03-04 12:28:13 UTC <janet444> @TomthunkitsMind This is from October. I'm glad it's getting out. Are you sure it's not directed towards anyone in particular? It's not addressed to anyone in particular, though, making it seem that it is addressed to his constituents. Nervy!
970054550899044352 2018-03-03 21:53:22 UTC <janet444> @BettyBowers @AdviserAkbar It's an insidious plot to get people to use their brains and maybe do some research from legitimate sources (and concede that CNN is a more legit source than Breitbart).
970053880506658823 2018-03-03 21:50:42 UTC <janet444> @BettyBowers Do they not know what the word "amendment" means?

969708480369168384 2018-03-02 22:58:12 UTC <janet444> @aliveesq @RealNeraCare @HilarieC Good point (about trump not being able to edit his tweets). That makes me feel better about the lack of an edit function. Maybe they should take away the delete function too - just for that reason alone.
969707455725924352 2018-03-02 22:54:08 UTC <janet444> @funkpuncher @brucewilson @CruzenJesse @bthospo @StopPssyGrabber Yeah - very sad. But keep in mind - they're the ones who voted him in. Who would have thought anyone would vote for this? Now we know- about 1/3 of our country. He still has a 35% approval rating, which is remarkably high imho.
969706835157618688 2018-03-02 22:51:40 UTC <janet444> @StopPssyGrabber @funkpuncher @brucewilson @CruzenJesse @bthospo Yeah. So far that doesn't seem to be stopping them. They're brave in their anger and grief.
969706267559321600 2018-03-02 22:49:25 UTC <janet444> @StopPssyGrabber @funkpuncher @brucewilson @CruzenJesse @bthospo Thanks for letting me know.
969706212454518784 2018-03-02 22:49:11 UTC <janet444> @StopPssyGrabber @funkpuncher @brucewilson @CruzenJesse @bthospo So disgusting to see so many adults vilifying these teens.
969705182421450752 2018-03-02 22:45:06 UTC <janet444> @StopPssyGrabber @funkpuncher @brucewilson @CruzenJesse @bthospo Brenda, is that link safe? Jesse is posting it all over this whole thread but I was afraid to click on it. I suspected it was something putting the kids down, but also worried it could be a link that could lead to a virus.
969704781257363456 2018-03-02 22:43:30 UTC <janet444> @StopPssyGrabber @funkpuncher @bthospo @brucewilson I'm tempted to report it, but I know that means I have to first open up an InfoWars episode and watch enough of it to be offended by it.

969702957431353349 2018-03-02 22:36:15 UTC <janet444> @davidhogg111 @cantaya6 @deplorable619 @Kimflower82 I used botcheck and they are not, sadly. I just blocked another one who put up a stupid meme showing the teens had the audacity to smile when posting for a photo. They'll defend their right to guns no matter how many die, but these teens apparently don't have the right to smile.
969702464973934593 2018-03-02 22:34:18 UTC <janet444> @davidhogg111 @Caffeine_Rules He's a teenager. Nobody is using him as a pawn. He is not against the bill of rights. You're against vulgar language, but you're okay with bullying a teenager. Get your priorities straight. And please don't reply, I won't engage with someone with your values (or lack thereof).
969701722041053184 2018-03-02 22:31:21 UTC <janet444> @davidhogg111 @A_Navison I'm disgusted that you would post this about a teen who just endured a school shooting. Did you know that you can disagree with someone's political views without acting like a jerk?
969701162667642880 2018-03-02 22:29:08 UTC <janet444> @davidhogg111 Please don't bother debating someone like Alex Jones. Find someone who has something of substance to say and who will debate you respectfully.
969699815700488195 2018-03-02 22:23:46 UTC <janet444> @davidhogg111 @cantaya6 @deplorable619 @Kimflower82 We can only pray these are bots, Kimberly. Maybe not, but hopefully they're still in the minority. They get a real kick out of being nasty to people (including teenagers who've endured a mass shooting that killed their friends).
969699291756486660 2018-03-02 22:21:41 UTC <janet444> @davidhogg111 @deplorable619 You really are deplorable if you're putting down a teen who just endured a school shooting. Did you know you can disagree with someone without being nasty about it?
969698891737288704 2018-03-02 22:20:06 UTC <janet444> @davidhogg111 @Caffeine_Rules Is there an amendment that takes away his right to smile? I don't care what your list of what's despicable is. if you think it's okay to post this on the feed of a teenager who endured a mass shooting, you have no right to tell anyone else what is and is not despicable.
969696938395389953 2018-03-02 22:12:20 UTC <janet444> @shannonrwatts One of my high school classmates said posted on Facebook that her daughter's school was on lockdown after a 14-year-old threatened violence. He wasn't armed, but it was of course scary for the kids. I wonder how many such incidents have taken place.
969695936908873729 2018-03-02 22:08:22 UTC <janet444> @davidhogg111 @Caffeine_Rules OMG I just realized you put this as a reply to one of the kids who endured this. Wow. That's really despicable.
969695690547978241 2018-03-02 22:07:23 UTC <janet444> @davidhogg111 @Caffeine_Rules And by the way, it wasn't 17 classmates, it included teachers as well. Maybe you should create memes if you don't care enough to find out who died in the shooting.
969695572058935296 2018-03-02 22:06:55 UTC <janet444> @davidhogg111 @Caffeine_Rules Are you really going to go there? Because these kids who just endured a mass shooting and are grieving their friends are smiling and laughing? Have you never had a chance to laugh even while grieving? I have, so you can put me down too with your petty meme.
969694901939122179 2018-03-02 22:04:15 UTC <janet444> @davidhogg111 @funkpuncher @ThePattyTank @spelloerthewest @CruzenJesse I don't want to click on a link without knowing where it's going to. When I hover, it's not a Facebook link. Can you tell us how to find it by searching?
969694510715428865 2018-03-02 22:02:42 UTC <janet444> Just saw nice article in which Delta CEO declares its values are "not for sale." The GA legislature is retaliating by removing a jet fuel sales tax exemption from a tax bill. Petty and manipulative but Delta's not letting it stop them. Good for them.https://twitter.com/Delta/status/967391778897891328
969693915040440320 2018-03-02 22:00:20 UTC <janet444> @Delta Thank you! Just saw article with CEO declaring your values are not for sale. It's refreshing to see corporations like Delta and Dick's Sporting Goods stand up for their beliefs and values.

969660333790040066 2018-03-02 19:46:53 UTC <janet444> Scary but not surprising. Surely people knew he would make stupid, rash decisions when angry (or even just because).https://twitter.com/mystcole/status/969640071639982080
969656109802901504 2018-03-02 19:30:06 UTC <janet444> @NBCNews @mystcole Yeah, that's why I was hoping he would never be president. Well, one of a million reasons. But the part where he's impulsive and cares only about himself was maybe the biggest one.

969653035629793280 2018-03-02 19:17:53 UTC <janet444> @NRA @nowthisnews @KTHopkins Sorry to see that you're able to extend only limited sympathy to teens who have endured something so tragic and are speaking up about it. Perhaps if you endured the same situation, you might be able to muster up a bit more sympathy.
969652703302488067 2018-03-02 19:16:34 UTC <janet444> @celtcgrrl1169 @bejeebies @GManfan64 @PrinceOnTheHill @4usall @themagaist @ashleeyoakes @Trendy2Chic What Trendy said. I'm 57 and you kids r my role models. I'm sick of people making stuff up about adults "using" you kids and I'm horrified that there are adults treating you disrespectfully. You deserve compassion for what you've been through & respect for how you're handling it.
969651996918763520 2018-03-02 19:13:45 UTC <janet444> @celtcgrrl1169 @bejeebies @GManfan64 @PrinceOnTheHill @4usall @themagaist Stop lying about adults using kids. These kids have minds of their own and far too many adults are treating them like garbage after what they've been through. No adults are using these kids nor coaching or abridging them.
969651259358793728 2018-03-02 19:10:50 UTC <janet444> @cameron_kasky How dare she say that when she has not endured what u have. Sorry there are so many squeaky wheels making us adults look like jerks. I believe the majority r with u, but it's unfair that u r being treated like crap by self-centered adults who can't see beyond their own agenda.

969649868481486848 2018-03-02 19:05:18 UTC <janet444> @funkpuncher God bless you. So sorry you have to deal with so many crazy adults who are showing so much less maturity than you and our classmates. You are heroes and role models to this 57-year-old woman.
969649093524979712 2018-03-02 19:02:13 UTC <janet444> @EdKrassen @AnneAnnapolis Yes, but I'm so glad your state is working on doing it, because once that info is out, we all get to see it, as well we should.
969648876046225408 2018-03-02 19:01:21 UTC <janet444> @EdKrassen Good for Maryland! I just read a few minutes ago that a federal court just upheld a law banning assault rifles in Maryland.
969396152142573568 2018-03-01 02:17:07 UTC <janet444> @BetteMidler Dick's is doing more. They'll stop selling assault weapons and have taken a strong stand in favor of gun control laws. But it's good that Walmart and also Kroger have raised the age to 21 (how is it even legal to sell guns to anyone under 21 anyway?).
969394404216713219 2018-03-01 02:10:11 UTC <janet444> @TeamPelosi @kaufmannskrimis I so totally agree with this.
969394332691238912 2018-03-01 02:09:54 UTC <janet444> @TeamPelosi Not only should he be removed, there should be some disciplinary action against anyone and everyone who allowed him to have access to classified information. Including his father-in-law.
969393162799239168 2018-03-01 02:05:15 UTC <janet444> @Bencjacobs @npfandos @jdotshack Not the point - the House Intelligence Committee is leaking sensitive info. See how that's more disturbing than sensitive info being on an individual's cell phone?

It's not always easy to be clear on Twitter, and I've often explained other peoples' tweets when people get defensive about someone who's on the same side. I don't think we're lacking comprehension skills.

969011098967044101 2018-02-28 00:47:04 UTC <janet444> @EdKrassen @sydney241 @jessthomas195 @fElizabethPerry Teachers are human. They often suffer burnout. They're not perfect. Why can't we believe that a human being who is a teacher would do this? Also - a human being just did this. How can someone fake being a teacher? Was he a sub?
969010564990210048 2018-02-28 00:44:56 UTC <janet444> Wow. Almost immediately, we have proof that arming teachers is more dangerous than not arming them (as I think most of us suspected).https://twitter.com/EdKrassen/status/968908762349268992

968115618959577089 2018-02-26 13:28:44 UTC <janet444> @bryanbehar Apparently it is for some people. Far too many are angry with these grieving teens for having the audacity to speak out. They want everyone who disagrees with them to just shut up.

968114801393242114 2018-02-26 13:25:30 UTC <janet444> @jaketapper Par for the course with trump, right?
968114730052259840 2018-02-26 13:25:13 UTC <janet444> Nothing should surprise me anymore - not even knowing that his supporters, about 30% of the country, will see nothing wrong with this.

967815456890466305 2018-02-25 17:36:00 UTC <janet444> I came here to Twitter to find trump's anti-Oprah tweet and comment, even though I  know he won't read it. And instead I found this. Wow. Just what I needed to see. She's a class act.https://twitter.com/KarenCivil/status/967813413010313220
967815349126262787 2018-02-25 17:35:35 UTC <janet444> @GlobalGrind @KarenCivil OMG I came here to Twitter to find trump's anti-Oprah tweet and comment, even though I  know he won't read it. And instead I found this. Wow. Just what I needed to see. Thanks for sharing. She's a class act.
967813874018897920 2018-02-25 17:29:43 UTC <janet444> @katiecouric @gsheath829 @JoMarksberry Jo, draining the swamp means appointing honest people with integrity, right? So when four people he hired are indicted and two plead guilty of crimes against this country, doesn't that make u think he's not really draining the swamp? Maybe the swamp is dirtier than it was?
967812804588818432 2018-02-25 17:25:28 UTC <janet444> @katiecouric The article gives trump far too much credit. If the writer is warning us not to be complacent, I agree. There are still far too many Americans who think he's just great despite all evidence to the contrary. So let's focus more on how to defeat him because he's an embarrassment.
967810961838170112 2018-02-25 17:18:09 UTC <janet444> @RWPUSA @dallaspamela53 Except that the "pro-lifers" themselves are drawing the comparison. I've seen more than one tweet in which a pro-lifer somehow tweeted against gun control laws saying something about how those in favor of such laws were fine with "killing babies."
967810249284636673 2018-02-25 17:15:19 UTC <janet444> Good one, and from a Republican!https://twitter.com/RWPUSA/status/967758793647017984
967810152291282944 2018-02-25 17:14:56 UTC <janet444> @RWPUSA OMG you're starting to sound like a Democrat! Or maybe you're just showing us what a sane GOP could look like. We haven's seen one in a while. This is an excellent point and I will retweet.
967809629903376385 2018-02-25 17:12:51 UTC <janet444> Please vote the GOP out! I don't usually call for voting on party lines alone, but right now the GOP has far too much power and most of its members, at least in the Senate and House, are using that power recklessly and selfishly. #Vote!https://twitter.com/johnpavlovitz/status/967599028333670400
967491009985830912 2018-02-24 20:06:46 UTC <janet444> @bobcesca_go What??? Did they offer any explanation? Or is it because we will forget this because or most will never find out about it because everything is insane right now and we cannot keep up with it all?
967471795279364096 2018-02-24 18:50:25 UTC <janet444> I don't usually retweet these kinds of memes. But this is so true.https://twitter.com/Veritaph/status/967426425732018177
967471699309596672 2018-02-24 18:50:02 UTC <janet444> @Amy_Siskind @Veritaph Ha, so perfect! They insist they love America and have the flag all over the place, but they need military-grade weapons to fight the tyrannical government that's coming to get them.
967471493914464256 2018-02-24 18:49:13 UTC <janet444> @Amy_Siskind To be fair, you'd have to be an idiot to be part of that group if you're female or a person of color. Or gay. Or not rich.
967469964985815041 2018-02-24 18:43:09 UTC <janet444> I am infuriating by the gigantic misleading postcard I got denigrating Senator James Eldridge @JamieEldridgeMA - If you live in Massachusetts in his district just know that the Mass.

966868829065359361 2018-02-22 02:54:27 UTC <janet444> Too funny. I agree with Cruz's comparison, I'd say it's right on the mark. Puzzled though that he would rather have the Homers running the country over the Lisas.https://twitter.com/SRuhle/status/966820125302296576
966868267791986688 2018-02-22 02:52:13 UTC <janet444> @thehill Wow, I agree with Cruz on something! Except the part where he actually thinks Homer is the one we should be listening to over Lisa. That's just so weird.
966867865361092608 2018-02-22 02:50:37 UTC <janet444> @SRuhle Wait, it was Cruz who said that? When i saw that I thought, yeah, that sounds right. But is Cruz saying Dems are smarter? Or is he actually saying he thinks the gov should be more like Homer Simpson? Very weird.
966864671922970624 2018-02-22 02:37:55 UTC <janet444> @HillaryClinton It actually feels more like a radical idea now than it did in 1995. I feel like we've gone backwards.

966862481607012352 2018-02-22 02:29:13 UTC <janet444> @CNN Saw this on Facebook. So vile the way the NRA and some (not all but too many) on the right are showing such insensitivity. They accuse us of politicizing by working towards change. But they can denigrate grieving students or the journalists covering these difficult stories.
966736869873549313 2018-02-22 18:10:05 UTC <janet444> @sarahchad_ @vet4democracy @MolonLabeLibs You calling it an anti-gun agenda doesn't mean anything more than us being upset with you for your pro-gun agenda. But again - these kids are obviously not being pushed by anyone. They are teens, not toddlers, and they are grieving. Not ur place 2 tell them who to be angry with.
966736205021876225 2018-02-22 18:07:27 UTC <janet444> @sarahchad_ @MolonLabeLibs You know 16-year-olds are capable of having their own thoughts, right? Nobody is pushing them. Anyone paying attention can see this is from the heart. They are grieving, they have been through a hell we thankfully cannot imagine. It's not your place to tell her what to think.
966734838593138688 2018-02-22 18:02:01 UTC <janet444> @FluffyFire I need to look into this more. I really do think there should be less access to these kinds of weapons. But I'll admit that I'm still learning. After this incident, I feel more determined to understand this issue, but it will take some time.
966734371880398848 2018-02-22 18:00:09 UTC <janet444> @SamuelAAdams @JeremyPerry36 @StainlessII @LizRabban @allisonrathan @tomajessie @Dcarnerphotogr1 OMG I can't deal with you any more. Janet does believe in facts. You're not presenting any. I'm going to mute you now because you are not making sense and by the way, your opinions are not facts.
966733934972284928 2018-02-22 17:58:25 UTC <janet444> @DineshDSouza But sure, being able to support yourself by going to a 9 to 5 job has more to do with whether you can have an opinion on gun policy than living through a tragic mass shooting.
966733780017995776 2018-02-22 17:57:48 UTC <janet444> @DineshDSouza And how disgusting to hear someone tweet sarcasm towards kids who have been through a traumatic school shooting where they lost 17 classmates and staff members.
966733641521999872 2018-02-22 17:57:15 UTC <janet444> @DineshDSouza How interesting to hear someone who's never been through the trauma of a school shooting and lost 17 classmates & teachers telling us about American gun control policy.
966732924686135296 2018-02-22 17:54:24 UTC <janet444> @DineshDSouza Really? Your heart goes out to the parents, but you'll put down the students? These kids are grieving & they've been endangered & traumatized. You don't get to denigrate them because they're saying things you don't like.
966731300580331520 2018-02-22 17:47:57 UTC <janet444> @DineshDSouza You have a lot of nerve accusing others of being disgusting. Have you met you?

966475080934023168 2018-02-21 00:49:50 UTC <janet444> @TeaPainUSA No, this was already normalized. Esp. the gun thing. And probably after that the sexual abuse against women. The white supremacy was gaining steam too. Trump didn't transform America, America turned into a country that would vote for someone like trump.

It's just so hard not to at least express disapproval of such ghoulish behavior. It's so unfair to these poor, grieving kids and to everyone who was involved in this shooting in any way.
966471870521466881 2018-02-21 00:37:04 UTC <janet444> Exactly!https://twitter.com/TheAntiHannity/status/966423923192573952
966470512355487744 2018-02-21 00:31:40 UTC <janet444> @DineshDSouza @AnnCoulter @kurteichenwald Oh no I don't even want to know about this. How low can people go? And she has the nerve to say we liberals are "godless" (which makes no sense).
966470023412944896 2018-02-21 00:29:44 UTC <janet444> @robreiner Sad that we knew exactly who you were talking about without having to read the last sentence. Also sad that the last sentence is as true as the others.

There are plenty of Americans who will stoop this low, plenty who care more about keeping their guns than saving lives, even those who don't benefit directly from the NRA's wealth.
966298908988190720 2018-02-21 13:09:47 UTC <janet444> @peterdaou Just saw a tweet attacking them & almost all comments supported his views. He calls himself Thomas Paine & claims to have won a Pulitzer. Please someone tell me he's lying about that. Nobody who would do that deserves a Pulitzer.

966298007460368384 2018-02-21 13:06:12 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump Seriously? Yes, let's look at the facts. You believe Putin because he said so a few times and you couldn't keep asking. You praise Putin while putting down our Congress members if they're Democrats. You won't pass bipartisan sanctions. Tell me now what facts I'm missing here?
966297009912152064 2018-02-21 13:02:14 UTC <janet444> @Thomas1774Paine @TheSharpEdge1 @TXIndepndnt1836 @MathewsJeanne @hsmiles It's horrifying that you would put down grieving teens or post photos of them smiling as though it proves something. Most people are able to laugh during grief. It helps relieve the intense feelings.

I'm actively researching this issue because we need solutions. You could defend yourself with a weapon that would be less likely to kill so many people so quickly.
966164394009874432 2018-02-20 04:15:16 UTC <janet444> @SamuelAAdams @JeremyPerry36 @StainlessII @LizRabban @allisonrathan @tomajessie @Dcarnerphotogr1 And a knife or even a vehicle won't kills as many people. So let's leave them with the least dangerous choice. And now you'll say "but they'll get guns if they want them." They might not be able to.
966164011099348993 2018-02-20 04:13:45 UTC <janet444> @SamuelAAdams @JeremyPerry36 @StainlessII @LizRabban @allisonrathan @tomajessie @Dcarnerphotogr1 You're making all of this up. And OF COURSE I did not say that kids who are spanked become killers. If that were true, there would be a lot of killers out there! I said that people who are disciplined with violence learn that violence is the solution.

Why is the AR15 necessary when there are other options that couldn't do as much damage in an attempted mass shooting?
966162699834019840 2018-02-20 04:08:32 UTC <janet444> @SamuelAAdams @JeremyPerry36 @StainlessII @LizRabban @tomajessie @allisonrathan @Dcarnerphotogr1 Those are separate issues. We do teach teens to be observant, defensive drivers (or the driving schools ought to be teaching that). But that's a different subject. I respectfully disagree that getting rid of gun free zones in schools will eliminate the issue of shootings.
965938373142642688 2018-02-20 13:17:09 UTC <janet444> @peterdaou @seffrtnow @JackHockett1 @MCMath512 I'm starting to believe this - about America's mental health. Or at least an alarming lack of intelligence. We're seeing more and more of the "ugly American" - someone who celebrates violence & is stubborn about their right to be jerks. Not all conservatives, but too many.
965937821323333632 2018-02-20 13:14:57 UTC <janet444> @peterdaou Oh please don't let this be true. They have gone through so much.

Age limit too, no gun sales to those under 21 except maybe hunting w/parental approval.
965936821753536513 2018-02-20 13:10:59 UTC <janet444> @SamuelAAdams @JeremyPerry36 @StainlessII @LizRabban @allisonrathan @tomajessie @Dcarnerphotogr1 I didn't say that those who spank become killers. I said that those hit learn to use violence to discipline. You use spanking and you used it on your boys too. I'm against spanking. I would never have spanked my boy and he's not going to hurt anyone.
965936171602890752 2018-02-20 13:08:24 UTC <janet444> @WomanResistorNC That's how I feel!

People don't commit acts of extreme violence because their parents didn't discipline them well enough. On the contrary, those who are hit are the ones taught that violence is the answer. But again, gun control is not banning guns.
965932949223944192 2018-02-20 12:55:35 UTC <janet444> @ChelseaClinton @girlfromPBO @TLC10q @wma927 Me too! If you can get Stephen Colbert, you would probably like his late show too, if you like Oliver and Noah and SNL.

They don't even get that riled about about the people who were tragically killed. And they insist that we're being illogical. It's baffling.

Of course we're not asking to ban guns anyway, plus we actually need cars.

965355765975470080 2018-02-18 22:42:04 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump Decent and honorable people welcome investigations to find out the truth about what happened. If you're innocent, you have nothing to worry about. The investigation has uncovered important information, but apparently you don't care about that.

I wonder if the Russians came up with it as a way to divide us.
965343596479221761 2018-02-18 21:53:43 UTC <janet444> @SamuelAAdams @JeremyPerry36 Nobody is blaming the guns as though they are people. Try this argument again when you're able to drive your gun to work.
965017502060285952 2018-02-17 00:17:56 UTC <janet444> @everywhereist @AlbanyBillsFan @whoopwhoop3777 Okay, but you do see a problem with the failure to pass some of these simple measures then? What I see from the other end is people who are afraid of any gun control measure because they're afraid it means we're taking their guns away.
965016064164802560 2018-02-17 00:12:13 UTC <janet444> @robreiner @HCiavotto @averageWhtgal @Anthony21Mets @kitsaoc @anniebearwolf @OrygunSon No. There is nothing cute about it. We know that the AR 15 can be modified to be used as a machine gun. What the AR stands for doesn't matter. What matters is how it's been used in mass shootings. That's tragic.

We've known this for decades. Today Joe Scarborough said Ronald Reagan tried to ban such weapons. Surely if Reagan wanted to ban them, it's not too hippy dippy liberal to want to do this and save lives.
964711036669562880 2018-02-16 04:00:09 UTC <janet444> @robreiner @HCiavotto @averageWhtgal @anniebearwolf @Anthony21Mets Okay - it's the bump stocks that can turn these into machine guns. At minimum, the bump stocks AND machine guns should be banned. We're not gun owners. We don't need to know one gun from another so much as we need to know which guns and modifications can create these 1/2
964709106295693313 2018-02-16 03:52:29 UTC <janet444> @everywhereist @AlbanyBillsFan @whoopwhoop3777 No there are not. That's a myth the NRA or somebody is feeding you all so that no laws get passed at all. Who are these people in the liberal movement? And if they don't even have enough influence to get bump stocks banned, what are you afraid of? Let's pass the laws already.
964708275890675714 2018-02-16 03:49:11 UTC <janet444> @robreiner @HCiavotto @averageWhtgal @anniebearwolf @Anthony21Mets So both could be weapons of mass murder and you posting this and asking us to "get educated" is supposed to make us think they're okay? If they can both be used to quickly kill many people, then yes, they should be banned. Nobody needs to fire 30 rounds when hunting.

Every suggestion is interpreted as a ban on guns. Our borders aren't open, gun control isn't a ban, and yes, there would be fewer shootings and no, it's not naive of me to believe that.
964706471165427712 2018-02-16 03:42:00 UTC <janet444> @everywhereist @AlbanyBillsFan @whoopwhoop3777 As I said before, she did not suggest a ban on firearms. She responded to one of the ridiculous arguments against gun control. Whenever gun control laws are proposed, everybody equates it with banning all guns, then use that as an excuse to fail to pass any gun control laws..

964647864558333952 2018-02-16 23:49:07 UTC <janet444> @everywhereist @AlbanyBillsFan She's replying to someone saying "If they ban guns..." which seems to be what so many say when the subject of gun control comes up. I'd rather see guns banned than have us continue on this path, where we can't pass even the mildest reforms.

964642735985741825 2018-02-16 23:28:45 UTC <janet444> @everywhereist @AlbanyBillsFan Also, she did not admit the criminals will still have guns. She said it will be harder for them to get them.
964642562345766914 2018-02-16 23:28:03 UTC <janet444> @everywhereist @AlbanyBillsFan Why do you think that sensible gun control laws would prevent law abiding citizens to get guns? Why do you think it means repealing the 2nd amendment? It doesn't. And I'm tired of ppl using that excuse to prevent sensible gun control laws.
964642256698466304 2018-02-16 23:26:50 UTC <janet444> @everywhereist Ordinarily, I refrain from "liking" comments that include name calling. But that fuckwad asked for it by calling you an idiot for making what's probably my favorite Twitter comment today or even this week.

964639681269903360 2018-02-16 23:16:36 UTC <janet444> @dbongino @GeraldoRivera @seanhannity Nice way to avoid the important conversation that should keep more kids from getting killed. Call it "politicizing" when we try to implement even the most sensible gun control laws. That's why these 17 teens and adults were violently murdered. That's why so many have died.

You're arguments just aren't as "logical" as u think they are. And when u  can't allow the tragic deaths of innocent people, many of them minors, play a role in how u view this, that's not logic.

Not saying it doesn't exist. Please stick to the point being made. Don't tell me it's as self-evident now as it was then when so many are dying tragic and untimely deaths at the hands of violent, irresponsible gun owners.

Even if this is recent, how does the problem lie "outside gun ownership"?

Let me see some of those stats. You haven't shown a single logical argument in favor of failing to enact gun control laws. The US has the more mass shootings than any other country. US owns half the guns. But u c no correlation?
964298629208068096 2018-02-15 00:41:23 UTC <janet444> @car_nove @wrogglenutbog Both issues need to be addressed, of course.
964298458512396289 2018-02-15 00:40:42 UTC <janet444> @car_nove @wrogglenutbog Do you think she'd need to hide in a closet for 2 hours if the threat had been a knife or a crossbow? There have been 18 school shootings this year. You do know that a student with a knife probably would have been apprehended long before killing 17 people, right?

You're trying to justify failure to control gun ownership to the point where no amount of homicide enough to sway you nor any victim too young to cause you to question your views.

When we have 30 mass shooting and 18 are school shootings during the first 45 days of the year, you can seriously say that the right to keep and bear arms is as self evident in 2018 as it is in 1776? To the point of non regulation?

963601765336743936 2018-02-13 02:32:18 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff @lindacascone @krtmd @Bree000007 So I can't say I see that as lying. I see that as him sharing his perspective, and I do share that perspective. It's possible that there's another quote that I missed, but if this is the quote, I don't see that as a lie.
963601395512430592 2018-02-13 02:30:50 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff @lindacascone @krtmd @Bree000007 So from my my perspective, he's not saying that there is proof or evidence. I know you'll disagree with me here, but I do agree with him in that, while it may not be proof beyond a reasonable doubt, there are several incidents where his staff has had suspicious dealings.
963600416893267968 2018-02-13 02:26:56 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff @lindacascone @krtmd @Bree000007 (2/2) Schiff: "... help and the president made full use of that help. That is pretty damning, whether it is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of conspiracy or not."
963600337847414784 2018-02-13 02:26:38 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff @lindacascone @krtmd @Bree000007 Schiff (1/2): "We have all of these facts in chronology, you'd have to believe that these were all isolated incidents, not connected to each other  just doesn't make rational sense ... We do know this: the Russians offered help, the campaign accepted help, the Russians gave ..."
963600184256188416 2018-02-13 02:26:01 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff @lindacascone @krtmd @Bree000007 I wasn't able to get to Twitter until now. I looked this one up and found it, but in one source, it looks like the news source is using the word "evidence" but Schiff is not. I will see if I can paste the quote on another tweet now.
963123698051018754 2018-02-12 18:52:38 UTC <janet444> I blocked him, so I don't know if u can see the tweet. But it makes me so sick to see people accusing abuse victims of making things up; I'd love for people to provide him with some real, reliable stats. Then again, I should probably be more concerned with trump having same view.
963122920930381825 2018-02-12 18:49:32 UTC <janet444> Anyone care to give this guy a piece of your mind? He sides with trump in believing that Porter is innocent and his ex-wives both made up the abuse accusations out of "spite and vengeance." He also seems to believe there are a large percentage of false abuse reports.https://twitter.com/WVhunter78/status/963121855317135360
963122572333330433 2018-02-12 18:48:09 UTC <janet444> @WVhunter78 OMG - I'm "deranged"? Because I believe credible accusations? And you think I imagine myself a perpetual victim? I am truly disgusted by this conversation. Take a good look at yourself. But I warn you, if you're able to see yourself clearly, it won't be a pretty picture.
963122092362403840 2018-02-12 18:46:15 UTC <janet444> @WVhunter78 I will say though, I'd be happy to insult your intelligence, given your willingness to side with Porter, who is clearly an abuser. You shouldn't say a thing to anyone, ever, about abused women. You clearly care more about those accused of abuse than about abuse victims.
963121515146416128 2018-02-12 18:43:57 UTC <janet444> @WVhunter78 You are seriously comparing Slate with Infowars? If you actually clicked on it, you would see further links. i believe this is the one with the link to Jennifer Willoughy's blog post from last year, in which she did not name Porter. She was referring to him though.
963121007170084865 2018-02-12 18:41:56 UTC <janet444> @WVhunter78 Also, don't tell me what abused women do or don't do. You owe an apology to Porter's ex-wives for your tweet to me and to all abused women.

963120211024056320 2018-02-12 18:38:46 UTC <janet444> @WVhunter78 Oh please, that's a load of bs. You think women like being seen as victims of abuse? They don't. I don't know how or why this came out at this time but the idea that both exes did this out of "spite and vindictiveness" to a great ex-husband is preposterous.
963119239094730752 2018-02-12 18:34:55 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff @lindacascone @krtmd @Bree000007 Okay - I have to get off Twitter. I will look into it. I'm not sure I'd call that lying, but I would agree - if it is true (and I don't know that yet) - that nobody should be stating anything as fact if it's not yet proven. But again, I don't know yet.
963118741520289793 2018-02-12 18:32:56 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff @lindacascone @krtmd @Bree000007 .... I get the impression that the GOP is trying to undermine the investigation as well, esp. after the Nunes memo, which seemed to imply that FBI acted inappropriately, but when read closely revealed the opposite. I need to get off Twitter now but will check back later.
963118446190964737 2018-02-12 18:31:46 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff @lindacascone @krtmd @Bree000007 I did find one thing. Grassley accused Schiff of making a "baseless claim" that Grassley was trying to undermine the investigation. I don't have time to look further, but if that's what you mean, I wouldn't call that a lie. It's an accusation and....
963117836423057408 2018-02-12 18:29:20 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff @lindacascone @krtmd @Bree000007 Okay - thanks for a reply that is clear and respectful. But please help me out. You need to tell me what the lies are. I can't just look up Grassley's statements and know what you're referring to.
963117393823305729 2018-02-12 18:27:35 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff @lindacascone @Bree000007 @krtmd But trump's lies have been verified and he's known to have told many. So if you are not willing to see that, you need to be unwilling to look at some really obvious information.
963117167448346625 2018-02-12 18:26:41 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff @lindacascone @Bree000007 @krtmd Doesn't take much to get a block, does it? I take it she's not open to points of view even remotely different from her own. Bree, you can prove me wrong. Tell me what Rep. Schiff has lied about and I will look into it and if you're right, I'll tell you so.
963115613785874432 2018-02-12 18:20:30 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff @lindacascone @Bree000007 @krtmd I mean, we know for a fact that trump lies constantly. And yes, he is trying to screw America with his lies and he has lied so blatantly it's astounding that he has any followers. But I'll bite - what has Rep. Schiff lied about? If he's lied, we should look into it.
963115165070831616 2018-02-12 18:18:43 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff @lindacascone @Bree000007 @krtmd Oh wow, I had to "unlike" that comment because I just assumed she was referring to trump when she said lying. If she had said "policies" instead of "politics" I probably would have realized she was replying to my comment.
963114498260389888 2018-02-12 18:16:04 UTC <janet444> @cindi_leive @PainterPay I follow Richard Painter and Bill Kristol, but I'll admit that I have a hard time following conservative viewpoints. So far though I really like what both of them have to say. All conservatives and Republicans should be horrified by this administration & distances themselves.
963113883820003328 2018-02-12 18:13:38 UTC <janet444> @WVhunter78 It's true that he's not alone, though. He has a whole White House full of sick people who abuse women and then accuse them of lying about it, including trump himself.
963113622045102082 2018-02-12 18:12:35 UTC <janet444> @WVhunter78 Are you seriously saying that the ex-wife whose eye was bruised was faking it? That's sick. By the way, Porter couldn't get security clearance because of the domestic violence charges. So the WH KNEW ABOUT THIS and allowed him to see classified documents without clearance.
963113020632326144 2018-02-12 18:10:12 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff @Neoracer @atheistsresist @NateKeNYC True - whataboutism, vague explanations, nasty insults - sounds like trump alright.
963081392715436032 2018-02-12 16:04:31 UTC <janet444> @cindi_leive @PainterPay ...or to even "like" tweets or Facebook posts that include insults. I don't always succeed but I usually do. Also, Cindi, thanks for your kind words to us.
963081037428477952 2018-02-12 16:03:07 UTC <janet444> @cindi_leive @PainterPay Very true, Philippa. But I will admit to being challenged. I have had some friendly exchanges with trump supporters and that made me feel very good (albeit mildly conflicted). But in many cases, my anger gets to me. I do try with all my might not to disparage people...
963080359029166080 2018-02-12 16:00:25 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff @lindacascone @krtmd Oops, I meant "attack" not "attach." It would be nicer if they did attach themselves to Rep. Schiff's ethics.
963080224589144075 2018-02-12 15:59:53 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff @lindacascone @krtmd That's for sure. It's astounding to me that anyone can support trump's ethics, which have been proven to be - well - nonexistent. Yet they'll attach Rep. Schiff's ethics because they disagree with his policies. It's NOT the same thing.
963079851845484544 2018-02-12 15:58:24 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff @Neoracer @atheistsresist @NateKeNYC Botcheck says it's probably not a bot. Sadly, there are still a fairly large number of supporters. Try to get something more substantial than "you're a liar" though and you won't get further than whataboutism or more vague replies - or in some cases downright nasty insults.

962844118178246657 2018-02-11 00:21:41 UTC <janet444> @HillaryClinton @POLITICOMag @politico @VerdantWater Yeah, it wasn't as bad as I thought, but I almost didn't read it because of the stupid clickbait headline. I still disagree with the editorial though. Clinton is smart enough to decide for herself what to do, and I welcome her input on any subject.
962841525762908166 2018-02-11 00:11:23 UTC <janet444> @POLITICOMag @politico Oh dear Lord, not ANOTHER "Hillary Clinton Needs to Move ON" article. PLEASE STOP! Move on from what? Existing? Does Romney need to move on? Do you also want her to knit? You know who needs to move on? All the people who want HRC to move on.

You just know when the last word in the comment is "honey" that they're just doing it to be mean. You are obviously the opposite of that and it's gracious of you to apologize when you didn't even say anything mean.

You didn't do that. I forget what the comment was now, but I was replying to that person's reply to you. Sorry for the confusion. I *do* like "bratty baby" for trump though.

962701228814884865 2018-02-11 14:53:53 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @JTMann05 @tomkubow The majority of us in the US can see he's killing the US, destroying its rep, and causing harm in many other ways (taking from the poor and giving to the rich, allowing environment to be destroyed, and just being incredibly nasty). But there's still a large minority behind him.
962699917281153025 2018-02-11 14:48:41 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @Brimshack @markfollman @annableigh I hope it wasn't tone deaf of me to refer to racist comments "we" had to endure. As a pale white woman, it was disgusting to see. But I have no idea what it was or is like for people of color.
962699705808547840 2018-02-11 14:47:50 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @Brimshack @markfollman @annableigh There was drama - it just came from the GOP being horrible to both Barack and Michelle Obama and also from the many racist comments we had to endure. The racist anger was starting to boil up during his presidency. I guess that helps explain how someone this vile got elected.
962699354183258113 2018-02-11 14:46:26 UTC <janet444> @markfollman Ha ha - there HAD to have been a vast conspiracy to get someone this horrible elected. What puzzles me most is that there are still a significant number of people who support him.

962697190564036609 2018-02-11 14:37:50 UTC <janet444> @cindi_leive This tweet makes me sick. And I said that as a reply to it. It's sickening.

962491133527056384 2018-02-10 00:59:03 UTC <janet444> A response to trump's sickening tweet about how Porter's life has been "shattered" by "mere allegations."https://twitter.com/tarastrong/status/962372221950869504
962490643506434048 2018-02-10 00:57:06 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump This is just making me sicker and sicker. He's worried that poor Porter's life is being "shattered" by a "mere allegation" that included a photo of Porter's ex-wife's bruised eye. THAT is a "mere allegation"? This is truly sickening.
962425570943471616 2018-02-10 20:38:31 UTC <janet444> @BuzzFeed I hope she does well. She showed so much talent as a teen and it was sad to see her go downhill during her 20s - a time that could have been really wonderful for her.
962424741700173824 2018-02-10 20:35:14 UTC <janet444> @WilliamShatner I'm sorry to hear that. My church has a Social Justice Committee & I'm always impressed at how hard they work to help others when in most cases they'll gain nothing for themselves. It's done purely out of love and compassion.
962423649084084224 2018-02-10 20:30:53 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump If they want to fix it, they can do so easily. Treat it as a single issue and don't tie to that ridiculous, ineffective wall. Just pass it. You and the GOP know full well the Dems will support it.
962423254710472704 2018-02-10 20:29:19 UTC <janet444> @_kthechief Wow, that would be a rotten thing to do. I love that Cattrall is outspoken and not afraid to talk about sex and money. I'm not like that at all. Her character on SaTC wasn't always the nicest person, but in some ways I think we women need role models like Samantha.
962422021056495616 2018-02-10 20:24:25 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @Bluegreg48Greg Oh, you like guys who beat up their wives? Are we "haters" because we want trump to show compassion for the victims of Porter's abuse? Or r u one of those who thinks it's still not "proven."
962421163552059393 2018-02-10 20:21:00 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump Dear Lord, so the photos of his ex-wife's bruised eye isn't enough for you to declare that domestic violence is wrong and to express sympathy for both ex-wives and concern for Hope Hicks? Due process is for the legal system and yes, it's still in place. It seems your <3 is not.
962420562986401792 2018-02-10 20:18:37 UTC <janet444> @_kthechief I hope they can make up. It must be an unbearably difficult time for Kim Cattrall.
962420385332346880 2018-02-10 20:17:55 UTC <janet444> @_kthechief Thanks! Interesting - it looks as though they were friends here. :-(
962418861244022784 2018-02-10 20:11:52 UTC <janet444> @_kthechief Isn't the NY Post not the most reliable source though?
962418581592928256 2018-02-10 20:10:45 UTC <janet444> @_kthechief Wow, I never knew they had a feud. I have no idea what happened, but I can forgive Cattrall for this given, as you said, it was a public post that makes SJP look good.

I feel like people on Twitter don't understand the meaning of the word parody. This isn't even amusing. Get better at this, fake Julian.
962416915045109760 2018-02-10 20:04:08 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @TheRealJuIian Oh sorry, just realized that it's probably not stupidity on your part but corruption. My bad.
962416561456910336 2018-02-10 20:02:43 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @TheRealJuIian Wow, that is a load of bs there. If you really are the "real" Assange, you're not very bright. Good at hacking, I guess, but not good at telling truth from fiction.
962416244338167810 2018-02-10 20:01:28 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump You allowed the GOP memo to be released even after the DOJ said it would be reckless. You're full of it.

The story here is clearly true & could probably be easily verified. But keep living in fairy tale land. Those were not real facts you found. They just support the bias in your head. Good bye.
962415440315240448 2018-02-10 19:58:16 UTC <janet444> @GPaw2004 Yes, I was defending the guy who posted something about that, NOT defending trump - who probably still believes Obama is a Muslim born in Kenya and his real birth certificate is a big hoax and probably still believes the Central Park 5 were guilty.
962414751442665473 2018-02-10 19:55:32 UTC <janet444> Funny, I was just thinking the same thing when this post popped up.https://twitter.com/JoyAnnReid/status/962038716440064000

If you're going to argue about this on Twitter, then you should do some research and don't do it on these ridiculously biased websites like FAIR that hate immigrants. Learn what it really takes. Many of those deported did file.

Liberals care so much more than the GOP does. Do you think a GOP that voted for a tax plan that helps the wealthy and corporations over avg Americans cares about you? Dems care about those who need help most.

The rushed nature of the deportations under trump is uncalled for.

We need to address it, but we can do it with compassion. The first people ICE should target should of course be criminals - real criminals, not someone who had trouble filling out a form correctly.

If so, I'm disappointed in Vox for screwing that up.
962349286557147136 2018-02-10 15:35:24 UTC <janet444> @HilaryClinton @SenFeinstein @mcforgod @lovehersports50 That's what I thought, but Vox is saying a legal firm retained Fusion GPS on behalf of Hillary & DNC. Fusion GPS retained the highly respected Steele to do the research & the dossier was the result. So Fusion GPS didn't "buy" a dossier.

I've heard that we'll lose more money than we would gain by deporting them (although I don't remember the source).

That disgusts me, given that it has nothing to do with respecting women. When something or someone is sacred, you treat it/her/him with reverence and respect. You don't deny that person basic human rights.

961217797090172930 2018-02-07 12:39:16 UTC <janet444> @DecisionDeskHQ @tsmartens Absolutely! I kept saying that during the presidential election and look what happened.
961028212896813056 2018-02-06 00:05:55 UTC <janet444> @Chndlrr What????? I admitted no such thing. I have extremely high principles as a voter. It's you who have wasted my time with your narrow-minded, combative tweets.
961027958466113536 2018-02-06 00:04:54 UTC <janet444> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @DonnaWR8 @Rosymediagirl @MCCali60s @r_frayer Does it count as spam? I wanted to report them, but they didn't seem to violate any of Twitter's policies.
961027470626578433 2018-02-06 00:02:58 UTC <janet444> @Chndlrr Also, how dare you tell me whether or not I care about policy. I just don't whine when a candidate doesn't agree with ever single policy. That Hillary failed to defeat trump says more about the sad state of affairs in America than it does about Hillary Clinton. #StillWithHer
961027121400418304 2018-02-06 00:01:35 UTC <janet444> @Chndlrr WHAT???? How dare you make up things about me when you know nothing about me. I'm sick of people spouting that nonsense. I actually voted for Sanders in the primary and I regret it. He helped trump win by taking too long to concede & back Hillary.
961014541843918848 2018-02-06 23:11:36 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump Do you ever think about anything but keeping brown and black people out of the country? Stop the fear mongering.
961014302772809733 2018-02-06 23:10:39 UTC <janet444> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @DonnaWR8 @Rosymediagirl I just muted her. I can't stand these people who post meme after obnoxious meme so that you can't see the actual comments. I'd be fine with Twitter limiting people to one or two memes per post.
961013230759038976 2018-02-06 23:06:23 UTC <janet444> @deray @owillis @Chndlrr @OmarV09241992 But I completely agree that Hillary was the best candidate for president.
961013169392058373 2018-02-06 23:06:09 UTC <janet444> @deray @owillis @Chndlrr @OmarV09241992 I didn't think McCain was a bad candidate UNTIL he picked Palin. I don't think it was his choice. I've always believed the GOP pressured him into it. The irony is, he probably would have had a decent shot if the GOP didn't think we woman will vote for any female, even Palin.
961012828424622083 2018-02-06 23:04:47 UTC <janet444> @deray @owillis @Chndlrr Clinton was one of the best candidates ever to run. A GOP smear campaign combined with Bernie Bros who were appalled that anyone could be a moderate Democrat, along with a huge does of sexism, has allowed far too many to keep saying she was a "terrible" candidate. Nonsense.
961010992858746880 2018-02-06 22:57:30 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @SherriWhit @AGSchneiderman @GreatWordsmith It sounds like this had more to do with technicalities. Now that it's time to pay up, though, let's see what he does. Paint Spot sued for the $30k trump owed them and he appealed so many times that the bill he owed went up to $300k! To this day, I don't know if trump ever paid.
961010541681573889 2018-02-06 22:55:42 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @AGSchneiderman You're doing so much good work!
961006919103209472 2018-02-06 22:41:18 UTC <janet444> This is how this administration handles a breach of the security of about half of all American adults. They're protecting the company who allowed it by stalling the investigation.https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/960997038589644800
960947815110373376 2018-02-06 18:46:27 UTC <janet444> I hope there is a better version of the GOP out there that's ready to take the seats of most of the GOP members now in office. Or even better - let's just stop electing any of them. #VoteBlue2018https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/960891786909667328
960946352237809664 2018-02-06 18:40:38 UTC <janet444> @CNN Right. It was clear he thought he was being funny. He needs to learn the limits, especially since his "humor" (if you can call it that) tends to be mean-spirited and abusive. Come to think of it, it's common for abusers to say "it was only a joke" & u don't have a sense of humor.
960945834698399744 2018-02-06 18:38:35 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @bipolarlioness People need to be careful with those kinds of tweets, because it's far too easy to believe he would say that (or pretty much anything that looks stupid, uninformed, racist, sexist, etc.). Sadly, the only unbelievable tweet would be an intelligent, gracious, articulate one.
960944862735536128 2018-02-06 18:34:43 UTC <janet444> @Amy_Siskind @StSmallerie Oh yeah. Every time I write a tweet like this, someone tells me that. I know it but I guess I don't want to know.
960944472359079937 2018-02-06 18:33:10 UTC <janet444> I feel the same way.https://twitter.com/Amy_Siskind/status/960706227226456064
960664620024426496 2018-02-05 00:01:08 UTC <janet444> That's for sure! Thanks for understanding.
960664453879607296 2018-02-05 00:00:28 UTC <janet444> Disgusting. He actually called Dems treasonous for not applauding his obnoxious SOTU address. Treasonous.https://twitter.com/Amy_Siskind/status/960607326880325632
960664057505251333 2018-02-05 23:58:54 UTC <janet444> @Amy_Siskind How on earth did this horrible person get elected? It's baffled me ever since he started to gain traction in the campaign. He's just disgusting and horrible and I will never understand how anyone could possibly support him.
960663607729164288 2018-02-05 23:57:07 UTC <janet444> Richard Painter is a Republican, and thankfully, one who is against this horrible person's unpresidential (to put it mildly) behavior.https://twitter.com/RWPUSA/status/960588018670297088
960663330443747334 2018-02-05 23:56:00 UTC <janet444> @pittgriffin This is a fake tweet that's going around. But don't worry, I'm sure he'll offer at least one genuine offensive tweet every day.
960662698739601408 2018-02-05 23:53:30 UTC <janet444> @RepTimWalz What did he say this time? Or dare I ask. Sorry that you were insulted. Thank you for your service.
960662222098878464 2018-02-05 23:51:36 UTC <janet444> @MarkHarrisNYC Oh, that's sad news. I didn't know he was a magazine editor. But it sounds right.
960661961255084032 2018-02-05 23:50:34 UTC <janet444> @MarkWarner @Comey @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump @tribelaw @onegoodmove I'm against insulting nicknames and yet I think he so deserves a taste of his own medicine. He already whines that he is treated more unfairly than any other president (bs), even as he treats others this way.
960661078995857410 2018-02-05 23:47:04 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @bipolarlioness I saw this before & someone pointed out that it was fake. NOT defending him. There are plenty of genuine offensive tweets to choose from.
960660759029088260 2018-02-05 23:45:47 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump Projection again. I really appreciated Rep. Schiff pointing out that proper oversight was not undertaken before that blatantly biased memo was released. That is not in the best interests of our country.
960659622452449281 2018-02-05 23:41:16 UTC <janet444> @SpeakerRyan @CBSNews @HPbasketball @timjhogan @scottie_cryptin @b_arthurs_tunic @GardenerAngry lol, I was ready to get all defensive, but I don't think I need to.
960659356240044036 2018-02-05 23:40:13 UTC <janet444> Yeah, it's important not to retweet fake stuff & I'm embarrassed that I made that mistake! So sorry about your vision. You've been very kind too, and I hope you too have a fabulous evening.
960658817435557894 2018-02-05 23:38:04 UTC <janet444> I know! lol
960650277887111168 2018-02-05 23:04:08 UTC <janet444> If you want to see the video, click on my name. I retweeted it a few minutes ago, so it should be at the top of my feed.
960649728034770945 2018-02-05 23:01:57 UTC <janet444> Yeah and you know what I just saw? The secretary who got the raise was being sarcastic. I just saw a video of her saying he must not have read the whole article! lol. Thanks for correcting me on the fake tweet, I appreciate that too. :-)
960649225183944704 2018-02-05 22:59:57 UTC <janet444> @SpeakerRyan @CBSNews @HPbasketball @timjhogan @scottie_cryptin You're missing the point.
960648656725729280 2018-02-05 22:57:42 UTC <janet444> This explains why the secretary who got a $1.50/week raise was so excited about such a tiny raise. Because she actually wasn't. That makes more sense.https://twitter.com/timjhogan/status/960637803699822592
960647791088455682 2018-02-05 22:54:16 UTC <janet444> @brandxit @PRyan I think the greed tweet is fake. A trump supporter said it was when I retweeted it & I checked it out & see no evidence he ever tweeted this.  I knew the "greed is good" part was from the movie Wall Street, but I think this whole thing is from that infamous greed-is-good speech.
960646893058580481 2018-02-05 22:50:41 UTC <janet444> @ChelseaClinton @JTMann05 @debnsync Yes, it can be hard to forgive, but we can try and we can ask God to help us forgive. I so admire Chelsea for her gracious replies to people who are unkind to her.
960646431093723138 2018-02-05 22:48:51 UTC <janet444> No, the tweet about the $1.50/week raise was real. It was stupid, but it was real. Here's a link to one of several articles about it:https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-ryan/house-speaker-ryan-deletes-tweet-praising-1-50-pay-increase-idUSKBN1FO00T
960645690249621504 2018-02-05 22:45:55 UTC <janet444> I've been expecting this to happen - I knew the stocks would fall at some point, because the rise seemed to be based on some weird faith that things would go well under trump.
960645112417144833 2018-02-05 22:43:37 UTC <janet444> I am really confused by your user name and profile. You don't seem like an actual trump supporter. Are you trying to lure them into following you or something? Just curious.
960527253930151936 2018-02-05 14:55:17 UTC <janet444> I can't find anything about it, so you're probably right. The obnoxious tweet about the woman who was grateful to earn an extra four cents an hour was bad enough anyway.
960289291913003008 2018-02-04 23:09:43 UTC <janet444> @brandxit @PRyan This really shows how morally bankrupt he is. Greed "for lack of a better word," he says. Here are some better words, Ryan: passion, love, humanity, empathy, wisdom. Greed means selfishness, but I guess a disciple of Rand would believe that's a good thing. It's disheartening.
960287831930343424 2018-02-04 23:03:55 UTC <janet444> @PRyan @HandjobBob So $1.50 a week for a ft job - wouldn't that be about five cents an hour more? God bless her for being so grateful and happy for such a modest increase! Imagine a CEO being excited about a nickel raise.
960286858616950785 2018-02-04 23:00:03 UTC <janet444> So this is what Paul Ryan thinks. He's become the Michael Douglas character from Wall Street. No, Paul Ryan, greed is not good.https://twitter.com/InvisiblePinkNP/status/959883388663590912
960284804213280768 2018-02-04 22:51:53 UTC <janet444> @mattyglesias @rfilmyer Ha, yeah, that's why he fired Comey. Sure.
960260335948173312 2018-02-04 21:14:39 UTC <janet444> This is something to see! Carlson gets really riled up, but @RepSwalwell holds firm and doesn't let him off the hook. Nice work, Rep. Swalwell!https://twitter.com/RanttMedia/status/960224631230738437
960260093534195714 2018-02-04 21:13:41 UTC <janet444> @TuckerCarlson @RepSwalwell @RanttMedia Wow! So good to see a rep holding a journalist accountable! Although it's usually the other way around (when journalists do their jobs right).
960258612676431873 2018-02-04 21:07:48 UTC <janet444> @HillaryClinton @derekski353 @_5xo_25161 @bongo__furious That's fine with me. I really don't want to engage with people who believe all the ridiculous, unproven allegations against Hillary Clinton. She should be our president right now and she would have been one of our greatest.
960257510656696320 2018-02-04 21:03:25 UTC <janet444> @BarackObama @Lady_Star_Gem You left out the Dijon mustard and his wife's shocking sleeveless dress (much more disturbing to them than Melania's soft porn). Oh and her desire to have children served nutritious lunches at schools. Not putting down Melania, just pointing out the absurdity.
960256213127704578 2018-02-04 20:58:16 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @GOP @krassenstein @Polite_Jerk Did you read the initial comment? You do get why Brian sees that as moral confusion, right? Your comment doesn't have anything to do with what Brian said.
960255363647000576 2018-02-04 20:54:54 UTC <janet444> @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @DonaldJTrumpJr @FoxNews @paladine Wow! No words. Just - wow.
960254802356826113 2018-02-04 20:52:40 UTC <janet444> @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @DonaldJTrumpJr @FoxNews @paladine @Feybriona @Tw4ter Sorry about the weird spelling, but it was the only way to get the whole quote in. I didn't see it in her book, but it was quoted as an excerpt on Goodreads. Which isn't likely to be a site that makes up quotes.
960254496692686849 2018-02-04 20:51:27 UTC <janet444> @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @DonaldJTrumpJr @FoxNews @paladine @Feybriona @Tw4ter Perception is more important than reality. If some1 perceives something to be true, it is more important than if it is in fact true. This doesn't mean u should be duplicitous or deceitful, but don't go out of your way 2 correct a false assumption if it plays to your advantage.
960254237979574273 2018-02-04 20:50:25 UTC <janet444> @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @DonaldJTrumpJr @FoxNews @paladine @Feybriona @Tw4ter Yikes, I expect memes to be misleading, so I looked it up & the full quote is worse! It's too long to post here, so I will post it in the next tweet.
960253599174615041 2018-02-04 20:47:53 UTC <janet444> @HillaryClinton @derekski353 @_5xo_25161 @bongo__furious I guess your definition of "liberal denial" is paying attention to the facts and not believing every idiot who claims that Hillary Clinton said something shocking. With Trump, we endure hearing the words come out of his mouth. With Hillary, everyone's willing to believe anything.

960184717709635584 2018-02-04 16:14:10 UTC <janet444> @MrFilmkritik lol - you are right! Now that you said it, I can see it!
960184517502865408 2018-02-04 16:13:22 UTC <janet444> @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @DonaldJTrumpJr @FoxNews @paladine Can't argue with that. I was having a Twitter argument yesterday with people who insisted the memo showed FBI obtained a warrant due to an unverified document that had been "shot down" (it had not). And of course we now know Steele's dossier wasn't the primary reason.
960182191253794822 2018-02-04 16:04:08 UTC <janet444> @DonaldJTrumpJr @FoxNews @herrytehelen So true and somehow that didn't even occur to me until you said it, so thanks for pointing it out.
960181071705812992 2018-02-04 15:59:41 UTC <janet444> @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @DonaldJTrumpJr @FoxNews @paladine Well, they could have done a better job at it, given that anyone paying even a little attention to the memo knows that if anything, it proves the opposite of the point they're trying to make.
960178837031215104 2018-02-04 15:50:48 UTC <janet444> What? This is horrible - What Judd says in this tweet and what's said in the tweet within it. I didn't realize all this was happening!https://twitter.com/JuddApatow/status/959872971526496256
960176856208150528 2018-02-04 15:42:56 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff @AdamHileman Good question! It's so hard to understand what's happening right now - why all this has been allowed to happen.
960176525453725697 2018-02-04 15:41:37 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff I happened to catch this segment this morning and I was impressed with what a great job you did. I wasn't aware that certain procedures were ignored (bringing in the FBI to question them first, etc.). The memo was already concerning enough. Thx for pointing that out.
959957743833616384 2018-02-03 01:12:15 UTC <janet444> @ChelseaClinton @JTMann05 @ThatBastardJim Truly obnoxious. I'm sorry to say I saw more of his tweets, which all repeat the many lies spread about the Clintons. Bad enuf ppl believe the nonsense, but then to harass the daughter - so rude. She's gained much respect from me with her gracious responses.
959956536306163712 2018-02-03 01:07:28 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @TrumpJew The MSM is literally reporting things he says and does - and we can see and hear him saying and doing them. But if you like guys who walk into teens' dressing rooms, mock disabled people, and constantly tweet insults, I can't stop you.
959955403730837505 2018-02-03 01:02:58 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump No, the disturbing fact is that the memo was used to discredit the FBI unfairly. But yes, it sure is disturbing that this politically motivated memo was written and released.
959954836581179392 2018-02-03 01:00:42 UTC <janet444> Once again, Chelsea gives a gracious response to a rude, obnoxious person. I have a hard enough time with haters, so I can't imagine being a Clinton and having to deal with them constantly. Yet she not only deals with them, she does so with grace and kindness.https://twitter.com/ChelseaClinton/status/959904821066321921
959954080016818181 2018-02-03 00:57:42 UTC <janet444> @ChelseaClinton @mackfire701 Yes, well said, Ray!
959952735834640384 2018-02-03 00:52:21 UTC <janet444> @ChelseaClinton @JTMann05 @ThatBastardJim Are you sure it's the same guy?
959952394867150848 2018-02-03 00:51:00 UTC <janet444> @ChelseaClinton @JTMann05 @ThatBastardJim Wow, it's not a great idea to be obnoxious to famous people if you're trying to start a career as a musician. Unless you want the fifteen minutes of fame that comes from negative attention.
959951738240405504 2018-02-03 00:48:24 UTC <janet444> @ChelseaClinton @JTMann05 While none of that is true, even if it were, it would be helpful to stick to the point rather than insult someone's looks. It betrays a shallowness and mean-spiritedness, which isn't surprising from someone who believes nonsense.
959950909777371140 2018-02-03 00:45:06 UTC <janet444> @krassenstein I've never believed in voting solely along party lines, although I always end up preferring the Dem. But with all that's happening & now that I see what happens when one party has too much control, I'll be sure to vote all Dems this year.
959900952462544899 2018-02-03 21:26:35 UTC <janet444> Wow. I had no idea this was happening.https://twitter.com/MsTaraDowdell/status/959876069804445697
959900057301643264 2018-02-03 21:23:02 UTC <janet444> @Slate Except that his base won't take the time to understand why it's a flop, so they'll keep believing it's "proof" that there should be no investigation into Russian collusion. And arguing about it here on Twitter.
959896539639549953 2018-02-03 21:09:03 UTC <janet444> @oscarmichelen This was an excellent explanation of the memo. Thank you for writing this!

959797594397528065 2018-02-03 14:35:53 UTC <janet444> @girlsreallyrule @sharcat12 I did see trump called nixonian yesterday and thought - seriously, much as I dislike Nixon, it makes trump sound like a real president. Which I just cannot wrap my head around. It feels more like a bad, mean-spirited joke was elected president.
959796787925213184 2018-02-03 14:32:41 UTC <janet444> Wow, fascinating thread about Devin Nunes' website and some suspicious activity on it. Mike Farb is doing a lot of work in uncovering suspicious activity. He's worth following and supporting.https://twitter.com/mikefarb1/status/957676207570587648
959796213586341888 2018-02-03 14:30:24 UTC <janet444> @mikefarb1 @Skwidj Great idea! The only reason not to is if Dems have their own closet skeletons. They might, but I hope not, because they're the only ones giving us hope right now.
959795678892515328 2018-02-03 14:28:16 UTC <janet444> @mikefarb1 Do you have any idea of what this could be used for? Is it Nunes himself that's behind this? Why would he want to hack accounts and steal passwords?
959794798227009536 2018-02-03 14:24:46 UTC <janet444> @EdKrassen We already know what the code word "adoptions" means. But it's complicated so I keep forgetting. It's about Russian sanctions on American adoptions of Russian children, so the meeting with Don Jr. was probably about the sanctions.
959794331602374657 2018-02-03 14:22:55 UTC <janet444> @SenFeinstein @ChrisGakings @sandee0802 @TheBaronessMT I am too - worried about the corruption. What's happening with Russia is very concerning. As I read more, it's clear that the Steele dossier was not the primary reason for the warrant, so there was no wrongdoing there.
959793795905806337 2018-02-03 14:20:47 UTC <janet444> @ThePlumLineGS Did Steele have anti-Trump financial &ideological motivations? Or was that just thrown in there as more innuendo? He was hired to do opposition research, so I guess that could be construed as anti-trump financial motivation but there's no rule against opposition research, right?
959791187640160258 2018-02-03 14:10:25 UTC <janet444> Ha hahttps://twitter.com/StephenAtHome/status/959627667917230080
959791025219829760 2018-02-03 14:09:47 UTC <janet444> Hard to believe even the ban on bump stocks hasn't gone through.https://twitter.com/SenFeinstein/status/959577171575627777
959790754381074432 2018-02-03 14:08:42 UTC <janet444> @SenFeinstein @ChrisGakings @sandee0802 @TheBaronessMT I question everything. I'm not muting this conversation because I don't question things. I'm going to mute it because I'm wasting my time arguing against false points. I hope you too will question your own beliefs and the validity of the points you and Chris are making.
959790252897513472 2018-02-03 14:06:42 UTC <janet444> @SenFeinstein @sandee0802 @ChrisGakings @TheBaronessMT The Dems and GOP must work together to find out the truth. Right now, nobody knows what the truth is. But that means working together, it does NOT mean discrediting the FBI. That is irresponsible and reckless. It does mean the investigation must go on with no more GOP whining.
959789809643458560 2018-02-03 14:04:57 UTC <janet444> @SenFeinstein @sandee0802 @ChrisGakings @TheBaronessMT Wray himself said it would be "reckless" to release this memo. It's misleading, it's biased, it's partisan, it was said to include classified information, and it seems to be an attempt to stop the Russian investigation. What are they afraid of? The truth?
959788979620073474 2018-02-03 14:01:39 UTC <janet444> @SenFeinstein @TheBaronessMT @ChrisGakings @sandee0802 I may just mute this conversation. Stubborn Flame, you're the only one making sense here. The others are just making up reasons or listening to Fox News making up reasons why this is supposedly alarming and shocking. The fact they created this memo is, but its contents are not.
959788367423705089 2018-02-03 13:59:13 UTC <janet444> @SenFeinstein @TheBaronessMT @ChrisGakings @sandee0802 I think he means that because C Steele is from England (I think that's where he's from) we're not supposed to get intelligence from him. I don't know the basis of that. We know Russia helped elect Trump so why wouldn't we want more info on that?
959787813293182976 2018-02-03 13:57:01 UTC <janet444> @SenFeinstein @ChrisGakings @sandee0802 @TheBaronessMT Which guy? Nunes? Yeah, that's probably true. If you're referring to Steele, he has an excellent reputation and that hasn't changed. Again, "unverified" doesn't mean "untrue."
959786763786096642 2018-02-03 13:52:51 UTC <janet444> @SenFeinstein @sandee0802 @TheBaronessMT @ChrisGakings My point is that "shot down" and "unverified" are two different things. You're now asking a different question, but based on the response to the memo, there was no wrongdoing. But again - that was not my point.
959554813364264962 2018-02-02 22:31:09 UTC <janet444> @SenFeinstein @ChrisGakings @sandee0802 @TheBaronessMT Unverified and "shot down" are two very different things. Unverified means it hasn't been verified yet. But it was put together by someone with an excellent reputation.
959554458534514689 2018-02-02 22:29:45 UTC <janet444> Senator Feinstein's statement re the Nunes memo is worth reading:https://twitter.com/SenFeinstein/status/959525343265722369
959554312077762560 2018-02-02 22:29:10 UTC <janet444> @SenFeinstein Well stated. It's deeply upsetting that so many Americans are okay with this and that most of the GOP is okay with it. This is a scary time in America.
959553275975684101 2018-02-02 22:25:03 UTC <janet444> @SenFeinstein Yes and when they refuse to release a memo by the Dems, that makes them look even more suspicious. I hope all of this comes back to haunt them and soon.
959551996163514373 2018-02-02 22:19:58 UTC <janet444> @HillaryClinton @Frank_Mazza @_5xo_25161 @derekski353 Yes, we're dumb enough to not fall for fake news (the actual fake news, not the news trump discredits so that people will only listen to sources that praise him).
959550592581586944 2018-02-02 22:14:23 UTC <janet444> @RIFuture @DianeRavitch @RIPR @projo @TedNesi @RISenate @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @Comey @SenatorSheehan @patie1267 I agree that all should be held accountable. But releasing classified information within an inaccurate memo from a source that's clearly biased proves nothing about the FBI. If there is real wrongdoing, this is not the way to handle it.
959519639091974144 2018-02-02 20:11:23 UTC <janet444> @peterdaou @Cortini I saw that! Thankfully, he's just a candidate. Lots of us went to his Facebook page and let him know what we thought. He really didn't get at all just how backwards his views were or how offensive.
959518827624189954 2018-02-02 20:08:10 UTC <janet444> @HillaryClinton @derekski353 @_5xo_25161 She never said that. But trump has talked like that many times and he was recorded talking like that.
959517471815487489 2018-02-02 20:02:46 UTC <janet444> @peterdaou @Cortini Yeah, some goal. :-(
959517331268472832 2018-02-02 20:02:13 UTC <janet444> @peterdaou @Cortini So even if you do good, they'll say it's wrong because they don't believe it's sincere. Which is nuts. I've noticed they don't want gov to put its nose in people's lives, as long as it's convenient for them.
959516921950588928 2018-02-02 20:00:35 UTC <janet444> @peterdaou @Cortini @StrangeFruit39 Yeah, I don't want to believe it, but I suppose it must be that plus maybe a good helping of greed and corruption. :-(
959516436732563457 2018-02-02 19:58:40 UTC <janet444> @SenJohnMcCain Thank you, Sen. McCain. I wish more Republicans would speak out against this.
959462873843019777 2018-02-02 16:25:49 UTC <janet444> @peterdaou @Cortini No, we don't understand it. Are they just really competitive? Is it racism and sexism? Why can't they be grown-ups and play nice with people who have different ideas? From all indications, both Obama & Clinton were able to reach across the aisle. Why is GOP so hostile and rigid?
959461429660340224 2018-02-02 16:20:05 UTC <janet444> @Pontifex Although I'm a Christian who tries to live by the words of Jesus (and often fails), it's hard for me to believe that Jesus is the only way. I would think a loving atheist would be closer to God & Jesus than the many hypocritical Christians I've been hearing about.
959460453679321088 2018-02-02 16:16:12 UTC <janet444> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @traci_ortiz Sorry to hear that. <3
959460274418970626 2018-02-02 16:15:29 UTC <janet444> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It hasn't gone that far for me other than avoiding the topic, but I'm lucky I don't have to spend lots of time listening to MagaSpeak. Really good point, though. Cuz there's nothing divisive about a pres who calls anyone who disagrees with him losers and haters, right?
959456707842801664 2018-02-02 16:01:19 UTC <janet444> Many of us could use more info on the consequences of climate change. This article has 3 levels blowing away arguments by climate change deniers or those who say the change is somehow positive:   https://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-positives-negatives.htm

959455229665300480 2018-02-02 15:55:27 UTC <janet444> @MissRossi @DrWestinForTX07 @Mjaybat2002 @Patronus_2017 @RocketBaur This article is more direct about how dire the consequences could be:https://www.nrdc.org/stories/are-effects-global-warming-really-bad

Here's one article from National Geographic that describes many consequences.https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-effects/

959270577885401088 2018-02-01 03:41:42 UTC <janet444> @MissRossi @DrWestinForTX07 @Mjaybat2002 @Patronus_2017 @RocketBaur Why do you believe that? From what I've heard, the consequences are horrendous. That may be because our government continues to willfully ignore those consequences rather than address them, making things worse.
959269886169178113 2018-02-01 03:38:57 UTC <janet444> @SenGillibrand @yiayia1234 You are an extremely obnoxious person. Please go away. And stay away from women who do need to make the heartbreaking decision to have an abortion at 20 wks to save their own lives, because they don't need some holier than thou person like you telling them it's "wrong."
959268638015606784 2018-02-01 03:34:00 UTC <janet444> @MissRossi @DrWestinForTX07 @Mjaybat2002 @RocketBaur @Patronus_2017 Yes, it's disappointing that so many voters can be persuaded by politicians that this is not the case. Given the consequences of ignoring it, it's hard to understand why so many are willing to deny it.
959268217586843648 2018-02-01 03:32:20 UTC <janet444> @MissRossi @DrWestinForTX07 @Mjaybat2002 @Patronus_2017 @RocketBaur I found a good article on this:https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/6/1/15724164/9-questions-climate-change-too-embarrassed-to-ask
959268125253558272 2018-02-01 03:31:58 UTC <janet444> @MissRossi @DrWestinForTX07 @Mjaybat2002 @Patronus_2017 @RocketBaur Yes, 200 years is extremely short relative to earth's beginning, so if I understand correctly, the rate of climate change has gone up dramatically during that relatively short period of time during which factories and vehicles have been emitting greenhouse gasses.
959079273779879941 2018-02-01 15:01:32 UTC <janet444> I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/UyInGriuVJ0?a Hypnosis for Inner Peace
959078645812924416 2018-02-01 14:59:02 UTC <janet444> Michael Sealey's guided meditation/hypnosis videos are so wonderful. His voice lulls me into peace. This one is only 15 min: Hypnosis for Inner Peace https://youtu.be/UyInGriuVJ0 via @YouTube
959062518781095936 2018-02-01 13:54:57 UTC <janet444> @MissRossi @DrWestinForTX07 @Mjaybat2002 @Patronus_2017 @RocketBaur Main issue 4 me is we need to take it seriously and not just deny it or dismiss science. It seems the bigger changes have occurred over the past 200 years since the industrial revolution & I know it's tough for corporations to address it but our burying heads in sand is not ok.
959059459313201152 2018-02-01 13:42:48 UTC <janet444> @johnpavlovitz @nikazilio Okay, that is NOT what he's advocating. I know it's humor but in all honestly, physical violence doesn't amuse me. If anything we need more people willing to speak out thoughtfully without being called "haters" which is a ridiculous argument a lot of trump supporters use.
959058660038270977 2018-02-01 13:39:37 UTC <janet444> @SenGillibrand @yiayia1234 Also don't call me "touchy touchy" it's really rude. I have no idea why you decided start an argument with me but I'm not into it. I made a fairly innocuous post and you started an argument & one that includes rudeness. I'm done with this.
959057528238768128 2018-02-01 13:35:07 UTC <janet444> @SenGillibrand @yiayia1234 Here are stats from the gov. According to the CDC, 1.3% of abortions are performed after 20 weeks. https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm
959056835432140800 2018-02-01 13:32:22 UTC <janet444> @SenGillibrand @yiayia1234 Also I hope you'll consider reading this moving first-person account from an OB/GYN who reluctantly had an abortion due to unusual circumstances:https://www.vox.com/first-person/2017/10/6/16438352/20-week-abortion-ban-obstetrician
959056640980017152 2018-02-01 13:31:36 UTC <janet444> @SenGillibrand @yiayia1234 No, abortions are NOT their main business. I wish people would stop calling them "abortion clinics" because that is about 3% of what they do. They are a health clinic for low-income woman and they also treat men.
959055704786112513 2018-02-01 13:27:53 UTC <janet444> @PPact @yiayia1234 It is already allowed - the new law would be a BAN on what is already legal. Nobody is talking about going to PP for a late-term abortion. You're the one who brought it up.
959050877553258496 2018-02-01 13:08:42 UTC <janet444> @PPact @yiayia1234 Yes, I have heard that the women are hospitalized and that is where the abortions are done. Not at PP. That doesn't change the fact that they might need an abortion after 20 weeks. It would be at a hospital. So again, it would be dangerous to ban abortions after 20 weeks.
959050322311303169 2018-02-01 13:06:29 UTC <janet444> @SenGillibrand @yiayia1234 2/2 - the main point is that a ban on abortions after 20 weeks is dangerous because those abortions are rare and done under circumstances that endanger the life or well being of the mother or fetus. Now stop arguing with lies and also do NOT call me "honey."
959049877140459520 2018-02-01 13:04:43 UTC <janet444> @SenGillibrand @yiayia1234 Where are you getting your "facts"? Fox News? Washington Examiner? Please find some legit news sources. And don't tell me what I know and don't know. People who are in it for the money don't target people who lack money. In any case, you've strayed from the point (1/2)
959046978343702528 2018-02-01 12:53:12 UTC <janet444> @ananavarro @RepStevenSmith @Rosemarie4311 I think it's a parody account. I fell for it a while back. I don't get the humor in just being a dick, we've got enough real ones on Twitter already, but it's not worth anyone's attention.
959046606271246336 2018-02-01 12:51:43 UTC <janet444> @ananavarro Who is this woman and how did she get this job? By being young and blonde and hating liberals?
959044845569486848 2018-02-01 12:44:44 UTC <janet444> @RepAdamSchiff Isn't that illegal? What are the consequences of something so serious? Because this IS serious. Our government is going downhill fast, but then we already knew that part. Thanks for tweeting this.
959044372816855040 2018-02-01 12:42:51 UTC <janet444> This woman thinks @PPact Planned Parenthood would lie about a woman's life being in danger so they can make big bucks off late-term abortions for low-income women. Please send her some facts about how preposterous this is. I don't have the time or energy.https://twitter.com/yiayia1234/status/958724469006176257
959044048148451328 2018-02-01 12:41:33 UTC <janet444> @SenGillibrand @yiayia1234 So now you're saying they would lie about the mother's life being in danger? That's another thing altogether. You're the one who is believing lies and propaganda. Nobody wants a late-term abortion. And health clinics for low-income women aren't in it for the money.
959043031616905217 2018-02-01 12:37:31 UTC <janet444> This really is from the 1920s. I looked it up. Cute and prescient but he never counted on the invention of a thing that would turn off the ringer. ;-) https://twitter.com/konskicoco/status/959013402902380546
959042641869656064 2018-02-01 12:35:58 UTC <janet444> @konskicoco Ha ha - the cartoonist was prescient about everything but the ability to turn off the ringer. Still - it can happen.
959041282898366464 2018-02-01 12:30:34 UTC <janet444> @thehill @B_Rad_lee55 @JRLorton This is interesting, but I'm wary of the source and I disagree when the article says trump was right to bring it up. Dreamers are not gang members and they shouldn't be used as a bargaining chip while trump scares Americans into being afraid of immigrants.
959039499207626752 2018-02-01 12:23:29 UTC <janet444> @MissRossi @DrWestinForTX07 @Mjaybat2002 @Patronus_2017 @RocketBaur I thought there was scientific consensus that humans are significantly increasing climate change. I just looked it up after reading your post and found this from NASA, where first paragraph states 97% scientific consensus it's caused by humans:https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/
958859211517190144 2018-01-31 00:27:05 UTC <janet444> @ChelseaClinton Thanks for sharing this. I might have missed it otherwise. As a strong supporter of your mother I was upset about the news, and her thoughtful Facebook post helped me understand what happened and assured me she is the remarkable woman I thought she was.
958858579699752961 2018-01-31 00:24:34 UTC <janet444> @HillaryClinton @AHammondmeyer @dbelew02 @PRojectGiRLcons Lovely post, PRoject GiRL. <3 Why should we #getoverit is right! Also, I love the sound of Madam President and I'm okay with calling her that. She did get the most votes and would have been an amazing president - polar opposite of what we have now.
958857043271737346 2018-01-31 00:18:28 UTC <janet444> @HillaryClinton Well said - thank you for your thoughtful response. I'm so glad the woman who was harassed continued to thrive working for you.
958856791504424960 2018-01-31 00:17:28 UTC <janet444> @HillaryClinton @konskicoco Yes, we do. Obviously you're not alone so ignore the ridiculous, obnoxious replies.
958853005188583424 2018-01-31 00:02:25 UTC <janet444> @thehill Thanks to Senator Harris for speaking up on behalf of Dreamers. No, trump should not be bringing up gang members in the same conversation in which he talks about Dreamers. And DACA should not be used as a bargaining chip.
958852163123499008 2018-01-31 23:59:04 UTC <janet444> @thehill @B_Rad_lee55 If he said that many MS13 gang members fall in the Dreamer definition, then why is everyone here saying Sen. Harris is lying? Of course gang members could not be Dreamers. Has anyone making negative comments here even bothered to find out what constitutes a Dreamer? Has trump?
958723103659560961 2018-01-31 15:26:14 UTC <janet444> @SenGillibrand @yiayia1234 Again, PP should not have to lie about the reason in order to protect a woman's life or well-being. They should never be put in that position nor should the mother.
958526110140166144 2018-01-30 02:23:27 UTC <janet444> @SenGillibrand @yiayia1234 You can't lie about how far along you are in a pregnancy and nobody should have to. Abortions after 20 weeks are done for serious reasons and a ban could threaten the mother's life or well being.
958332796870840320 2018-01-30 13:35:18 UTC <janet444> Bad PR for Home Depot! Its co-founder: Dems dont have any brainshttp://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/371121-home-depot-co-founder-dems-dont-have-any-brains#.WnB0gokv2Ws.twitter
958320941142069248 2018-01-30 12:48:11 UTC <janet444> Okay, I had to read this three or four times, but yes, that concerning.https://twitter.com/waltshaub/status/958149108694478848
958319598067159040 2018-01-30 12:42:51 UTC <janet444> @SenGillibrand @kalendaearum @RealLastJedi Actually murder means "with malice aforethought" so unless you believe women have abortions out of maliciousness towards the fetus, it cannot be "murder." I learned this in the 70s when I was debating against abortion in high school. I've since changed my views.
958127059053744133 2018-01-29 23:57:46 UTC <janet444> @DonaldJTrumpJr @funder Well, he's right in a way. This will go down in history as a monumental, unprecedented disgrace to the US.
958125526807470080 2018-01-29 23:51:41 UTC <janet444> @FoxNews Why are you focusing on Wynn contributions to Dems when most were to Republicans? And this guy is talking like it's some great coup to find out that a smaller amount went to Dems. The partisanship in this "news" organization is appalling.
958124652936810497 2018-01-29 23:48:13 UTC <janet444> @SenGillibrand Sorry, I meant most states ban abortions after 20 weeks without those reasons. I wish Twitter allowed editing.
958124506819776513 2018-01-29 23:47:38 UTC <janet444> @SenGillibrand Would this ban abortions even when the mother's or fetus's health or life is in danger? I ask because that's about the only time women have abortions after 20 weeks & most states ban abortions without those reasons, right?
958122568359317504 2018-01-29 23:39:56 UTC <janet444> I'm disappointed twitter thinks it's ok for someone to reply to my non-political tweets with political replies. To me, that's harassment. I reported the person & they're saying it didn't violate their rules.
958112544065024000 2018-01-29 23:00:06 UTC <janet444> @JCTheResistance @WMoulthrope @Karl123459 You should know that the person who called Hillary a b**** has been replying to tweets YouTube sent on my behalf about videos I've added to a list with anti Hillary bs. These videos have nothing to do with politics. I blocked him/her. Please do not engage with this person.
958041504630657024 2018-01-29 18:17:48 UTC <janet444> @catherine_lucey Thx 4 pointing out on Kasie DC how crazy it is that trump is living in another reality. I was disappointed that your remark was glossed over, though I suppose they ran out of time.
958040964869840896 2018-01-29 18:15:40 UTC <janet444> @axios @jonathanvswan @KasieDC @ksb927 Yes! There should be more on how crazy all of this is. In that same show, they trashed Hillary again & it was a matter 4 which she deserved criticism, yet they glossed over Lucey's remark. Agree on names & I wish they'd get rid of gigantic banners at bottom in favor of names.
958039876196282370 2018-01-29 18:11:20 UTC <janet444> @paulkrugman @jarthur47 @vickiringer Thanks for that, I'll consider that the next time I'm ordering from Amazon. Or maybe I'll look at my last year's purchases and see if it would be justified.
958039565473861632 2018-01-29 18:10:06 UTC <janet444> @JCTheResistance @Karl123459 @WMoulthrope Hillary is clearly on the left, albeit perhaps not as far to the left as some progressives. That doesn't make her a monster. And no, it doesn't sound like a criminal enterprise, that's a far reach. Also, Bernie is not and never was a Democrat.
958039194902974464 2018-01-29 18:08:38 UTC <janet444> @RogueSNRadvisor @SpookyKat4 @lyn_rix @K200mph @felicia403 @LynneFeldman2 Hadn't thought of that. Hopefully that won't fly in this type of investigation. Also he likes to spout off and that might work in the country's favor (given that getting to the truth is in the country's favor). I can't see trump repeatedly saying "I don't recall." We shall see.
958038698276335616 2018-01-29 18:06:39 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @RogueSNRadvisor @SpookyKat4 @lyn_rix @K200mph @RussBarbee @felicia403 Russ, I could see that happening - and it would be glorious. Well - unless his supporters keep supporting the unsupportable. Felicia, I know what you mean. These past two years (since the campaign when people actually took him seriously) have been so strange and baffling.

957958077491351552 2018-01-29 12:46:18 UTC <janet444> @JCTheResistance @Karl123459 What's more we don't need to get the warm fuzzies from a candidate before we can vote for her.  btw, that's the whole point of the original post above. I personally find her likable and have heard several stories of her genuine kindness towards others.
957957104169517056 2018-01-29 12:42:26 UTC <janet444> @JCTheResistance @Karl123459 You're not bursting and bubble. Hillary is well liked by many and unfairly trashed by many others. She was held to a higher standard than male candidates. No matter what she does, she's vilified. Progressives believed the fake news Russia spread about her. 1/2
957956747930546178 2018-01-29 12:41:01 UTC <janet444> @JCTheResistance @Karl123459 @WMoulthrope You don't sound all that progressive. Referring to highly qualified female candidates with a profane slur is blatantly sexist. And no, she didn't rig your primary. The Republicans are doing the rigging with gerrymandering and voter suppression.
957955836466401280 2018-01-29 12:37:24 UTC <janet444> @axios @jonathanvswan @KasieDC @ksb927 Thank you! I didn't catch it at all, because I flipped it on near the end. We need more like her, people who point out how disturbing it is to have a president who is not in touch with reality - let alone one whose staff is afraid he'll perjure himself.
957955278896615431 2018-01-29 12:35:11 UTC <janet444> @paulkrugman @jarthur47 @vickiringer Good to know, but Amazon Prime isn't in my budget either. I'll keep that in mind, though, when I have a budget for both/either.
957954903401476096 2018-01-29 12:33:41 UTC <janet444> @DonaldJTrumpJr @drewhamelink @historyball @australiamerica Huh? The secretly taped conversation was disgusting and shows his true colors. Billy Bush himself is disgusted by it. Also liberals do not ignore thugs who beat up on women and children. That's a ridiculous statement.

957788545787289600 2018-01-28 01:32:38 UTC <janet444> @JCTheResistance @Karl123459 Definitely - we can't ever take any of it for granted. But that's also why we can't say Dems can win "easily" - it'll take effort. Esp with all the gerrymandering and voter suppression.
957788166894833664 2018-01-28 01:31:08 UTC <janet444> @RogueSNRadvisor @SpookyKat4 @lyn_rix @K200mph @felicia403 Right - it's scary. It'll be interesting to see how much it takes to get him held accountable to something - anything.
957787912933867526 2018-01-28 01:30:07 UTC <janet444> @RogueSNRadvisor @SpookyKat4 @lyn_rix @felicia403 @K200mph I don't think he even understands what a conflict of interest is. He gets away with conflicts of interest all the time. And then he'll have the nerve to accuse others of conflicts of interest because of some vague relationship, like the judge who was of Mexican descent.
957787438637871104 2018-01-28 01:28:14 UTC <janet444> @chefjoseandres @CafeMilanoDC @gymqwn @CassyBlue3 Oh - it's not the main account that posted the initial post. They're using a similar name to trick people and making the cafe look worse than they already do. Sorry to say, they fooled me. Thanks for explaining.
957786816484032512 2018-01-28 01:25:46 UTC <janet444> @JCTheResistance @Karl123459 I don't know about that. That's why I say - don't get ppl thinking they will easily win. That's why people need to heed the original message here - vote for the blue candidate, unless they're truly horrible (as in sexual predator or Republican-in-disguise horrible).
957786079448457218 2018-01-28 01:22:50 UTC <janet444> @axios @jonathanvswan @KasieDC Who's the woman on the left who, thankfully, talked about how bizarre & concerning it is to have a president who's not in touch with reality? I felt Kasie minimized her point, saying Mueller would handle it. The concern was deeper; it's about having a pres not in touch w/reality.
957740465872351233 2018-01-28 22:21:35 UTC <janet444> @JCTheResistance @Karl123459 Maybe I'm misunderstanding. When you said it's hard to be worried about 2018, I thought you meant that Dems will easily win.
957740293100621824 2018-01-28 22:20:54 UTC <janet444> @RogueSNRadvisor @SpookyKat4 @lyn_rix @felicia403 @K200mph Yes, it might just be fairly easy to get him to clearly perjure himself. But these days, it actually might not be as easy to get people to care if he perjures himself. That's what's scary.
957739588352729088 2018-01-28 22:18:06 UTC <janet444> @chefjoseandres @CafeMilanoDC @gymqwn Is that really your response to Patty's tweet? We were all proud to be American until an egomaniac with the temperament of a toddler (but without the sweetness) somehow became president. I do wish we could make America great again, but it'll be difficult after trump.
957737874207715328 2018-01-28 22:11:17 UTC <janet444> @washingtonpost @IvankaTrump @CafeMilanoDC @chefjoseandres @amifriend40_ami Very true, considering this man's claim to fame is his extreme generosity to those in need. THAT is what made Ivanka uncomfortable. We can only hope her discomfort came from a guilty conscience.
957736994368577536 2018-01-28 22:07:48 UTC <janet444> @paulkrugman @jarthur47 I find I end up seeing a lot of good articles in the LA Times when I'm searching online for info. I seem to end up at LA Times or the Guardian. I'd spend more time at WaPo too if a subscription were in my budget.

957701286060806145 2018-01-28 19:45:54 UTC <janet444> @JCTheResistance @Karl123459 No, it's easy to be worried. In 2016, I told people not to get complacent. They thought a trump win was impossible. If someone like that could get elected (and over someone as highly qualified as Clinton) we can't get complacent about 2018.
957700120971268098 2018-01-28 19:41:16 UTC <janet444> @RogueSNRadvisor @SpookyKat4 @lyn_rix @K200mph @felicia403 I'm hoping they'll ask questions designed to trip him up. For instance, questions they already know the answers to but he doesn't know they know. Or they'll ask so many that he'll contradict himself. He lies so blatantly and unabashedly that he may well lie himself into a corner.
957698111647993856 2018-01-28 19:33:17 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @EricTrumpsGums @opv_research Deregulation might help those at the top in a business, but the regulations are there for a reason. Taking them away can cause harm to our country and the world for various reasons AND there's no reason to believe the profits will trickle down to employees.

What is his claim to fame - overconfidence in his own intellectual abilities? You handled him just great. Painter wasn't as bad but you called him on veering off topic a bit. Gotta start watching your show more!
957335164207685632 2018-01-27 19:31:04 UTC <janet444> @chuckwoolery @Tooda I'm disappointed. I used to watch Love Connection AND Lingo (my mom loved the Game Show Network). And I always liked Chuck. It's disappointing to see him disparaging Joy Reid and Lawrence O'Donnell. You can disagree respectfully.

957098519755743233 2018-01-26 03:50:43 UTC <janet444> @MarkWarner Especially not the president. Presidents should be held to a higher standard, not a lower one.
957097856837541889 2018-01-26 03:48:05 UTC <janet444> @thehill Glad to see someone else mentioned that. I just tweeted the same to The Hill on this thread. It looks like a tabloid photo.
957097609931444225 2018-01-26 03:47:06 UTC <janet444> @thehill Surely a professional news source like the Hill could have found a better picture of Senator Waters. This looks like the kind of photo a tabloid would use.

It's about the wall being a ridiculous way of deterring immigrants. But FAIR is a biased source as well. I'm ok with curbing illegal immigration but not with alarming people about it or stirring hatred for ppl who are desperate.

956336475154591752 2018-01-24 01:22:38 UTC <janet444> I am not liking this obvious spin-off episode of #TheGoldbergs.
956319524214771712 2018-01-24 00:15:16 UTC <janet444> I happened to see the sentencing. Thought it would be boring but it was compelling & I can see why Judge Aqulina is Simone Biles' hero. <3https://twitter.com/Simone_Biles/status/956258439302451200
956318727435321346 2018-01-24 00:12:06 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @DannyZuker @brocanteuse @scrivbalto @nomiibo4u @Quaint116 @Teresa1643 @Benwest2016 @FerrellRich Okay that made me laugh out loud. 
956318563203190784 2018-01-24 00:11:27 UTC <janet444> Yay! One of my favorite shows ever!https://twitter.com/TwitterMoments/status/956298149173366786
956318394587996160 2018-01-24 00:10:47 UTC <janet444> @TwitterMoments @DebraBlankens19 To be fair, the show was pretty political. But now we have Twitter, where all the right-wing trolls can whine about the show instead of just not watching it.
956317645246169088 2018-01-24 00:07:48 UTC <janet444> @TwitterMoments Woo hoo! That was my favorite show during its run and 1 of my favorite shows of all time. I never caught the last episode! And I don't know why it's never been syndicated. I'd love to see Bergen play Brown again. Lately she seems to always play these sad women & it's beneath her.
956317132312203264 2018-01-24 00:05:46 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @DannyZuker @brocanteuse @scrivbalto @nomiibo4u @Quaint116 @Teresa1643 @Benwest2016 @FerrellRich Oh that's bad! 
956316839168086021 2018-01-24 00:04:36 UTC <janet444> @StacyCuccia How did I not think of that? But surely she could leave. A prenup can't keep you from divorcing and she'd hardly end up destitute.
956156549499707392 2018-01-24 13:27:40 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @DannyZuker @brocanteuse @scrivbalto @nomiibo4u @Quaint116 @Teresa1643 @Benwest2016 Sure she would. Look at how much support he still has.
956156249770545154 2018-01-24 13:26:29 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @DannyZuker @brocanteuse @scrivbalto @nomiibo4u @Quaint116 Oh wow, that little video is telling! I wish she'd open up about the marriage and divorce him, because it's hard not to believe she's miserable.
956154980540538881 2018-01-24 13:21:26 UTC <janet444> @johnpavlovitz @cjredj True. He either attracts or inspires (both?) those who imitate his own hatefulness, but they love 2 call liberals hateful because we're angry about it. It's weird how blind they r  2 their own hatefulness while accusing everyone who disagrees w/them of it. Maybe it's projection.
955948419029372936 2018-01-23 23:40:38 UTC <janet444> @Diddlydeeleedee @esquirerecordsi Oh, just saw this - it looks like I just posted pretty much the exact same opinion on this same thread. lol. Sorry, it's been a long day!
955948186803286016 2018-01-23 23:39:43 UTC <janet444> @Diddlydeeleedee @esquirerecordsi I'm glad it turned out as it did - there has to be some compromise, and although I think it's important that DACA pass, I'm not in favor of using non-budget-related issues as bargaining chips, at least not to the point of shutting down the government.
955947673525342209 2018-01-23 23:37:40 UTC <janet444> @esquirerecordsi @Diddlydeeleedee Once again, I simply asked a sincere question and you for some reason came on here to start an argument. That's disrespectful and obnoxious.
955947499688267777 2018-01-23 23:36:59 UTC <janet444> @esquirerecordsi @Diddlydeeleedee I'm not going to bother to read this nonsense. The idea that anything Obama did helped create ISIS is preposterous. And to call Obama arrogant when we have an egomaniac in the WH is also preposterous. Please go away. Stop creating arguments.
955946619303874560 2018-01-23 23:33:29 UTC <janet444> @rosariodawson @CWJaneTheVirgin JTV is back on Friday? Glad I saw this so I don't miss it!
955774356684247040 2018-01-23 12:08:58 UTC <janet444> Well, I don't believe trump's heart is in the right place on anything, but I do appreciate Sen. Graham's candidness regarding Miller.https://twitter.com/alanhe/status/955153178567364610
955773851245404160 2018-01-23 12:06:58 UTC <janet444> @CNN @realDonaldTrump @RanttMedia @mforte1970 Glad you added @GOP. I had forgotten but they are complicit in allowing this unqualified threat to the country and the world to get away with his nonsense. They're as guilty in this as he is.
955773120413143040 2018-01-23 12:04:03 UTC <janet444> This is pretty terrifying.https://twitter.com/RanttMedia/status/955647821474074624
955772673984000000 2018-01-23 12:02:17 UTC <janet444> @Diddlydeeleedee @esquirerecordsi I do think it's urgent that DACA is renewed, but I think it made sense to remove it from the negotiations and get CHIP funding, since CHIP was tied to the budget and DACA was not.
955772378382061568 2018-01-23 12:01:07 UTC <janet444> @Diddlydeeleedee @esquirerecordsi Meanwhile, though, I asked a simple question sincerely wanting an answer and you turned this into an argument (Outspoken, not Esquire Records). I simply wanted an objective reply as to whether it was essential that DACA be on the table in this particular negotiation.
955771920124805120 2018-01-23 11:59:17 UTC <janet444> @Diddlydeeleedee @esquirerecordsi The racism is blatant and what saddens me is that the response to it shows how racist a good percentage of Americans are. What's interesting though is that I never mentioned racism. You did. He's unqualified and unsuited for so many reasons I can't list them all in a tweet.
955613420002344960 2018-01-22 01:29:28 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump I don't know who you're quoting but there hasn't been a day over the past year that I have not wished Hillary Clinton was president.
955612923875024897 2018-01-22 01:27:30 UTC <janet444> @rowhillnth @washingtonpost @newyorktimes110 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @Fuerniss @JunkoPatsye @debnsync We never have 100% agreement or "consent" regarding who is elected president. We're not upset because a Republican won. We're upset because a wildly unqualified egomaniac with the temperament of a toddler is pres & as Debbie said, he was basically elected by Russia.
955611979774939137 2018-01-22 01:23:45 UTC <janet444> @esquirerecordsi @Diddlydeeleedee His smarts? Are you seriously talking about trump?
955611770667917317 2018-01-22 01:22:55 UTC <janet444> @esquirerecordsi @Diddlydeeleedee Please, take him! I'm not sure how you can "giggle" at my suggestion that trump is incompetent. He is wildly incompetent. Please take him and give us Trudeau! Most of us here are terrified and many around the world, including in Canada, are terrified of how ill-suited he is.
955411255472394246 2018-01-22 12:06:08 UTC <janet444> @Diddlydeeleedee @esquirerecordsi I wish he would (run away from the presidency and leave it to someone competent).
955410934717210625 2018-01-22 12:04:52 UTC <janet444> @esquirerecordsi @Diddlydeeleedee Sure, it'll be a treasure for anyone who profits from the billions of dollars wasted. Maybe trump has some kind of interest where he'll profit off construction of a wall. How did I not think of that before? Yeah, that's probably it.
955231101684977664 2018-01-21 00:10:16 UTC <janet444> @esquirerecordsi @Diddlydeeleedee Better than a multi-billion-dollar wall? Immigration isn't easy to deal with. But a wall is a bad idea for many reasons. There will never be a perfect solution. But that doesn't mean we should waste billions of dollars on a bad one.
955068258612334593 2018-01-21 13:23:11 UTC <janet444> @Diddlydeeleedee @esquirerecordsi What upset me most about Schumer was that he tried negotiating with trump and offering to allow the wall to be built. trump kept changing his mind. Nobody should allow the wall. It's a huge, expensive mistake and was a hairbrained idea that should never see the light of day.
954919793076981761 2018-01-20 03:33:14 UTC <janet444> @esquirerecordsi @Diddlydeeleedee Yes and it was during that year that CHIP funding was allowed to lapse. It was during that year that trump rescinded DACA. I did watch the video and as I said above, there's a difference between immigration reform and DACA. I'm wanting CHIP & DACA restored.
954909472199249925 2018-01-20 02:52:14 UTC <janet444> @MarkHarrisNYC @ToddDracula @MJValere @MainStreetMuse Is that the law of nature?
954908439477653505 2018-01-20 02:48:07 UTC <janet444> @ToddDracula I'm sure he means "torn" and not "born" but it's still funny. And no, you can't abort a baby that's being born, as babies tend to do during that 9th month. Maybe that's why he actually said "born." Maybe he knew how stupid the comment was even as he was saying it.
954890858721144832 2018-01-20 01:38:16 UTC <janet444> @Prime_Politics I read that thousands of Russian bots got #SchumerShutdown trending. And they may well be here too. Just keep in mind that there's no way of knowing who is voting or commenting here.

954888392747175937 2018-01-20 01:28:28 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @Be_TheChange18 @LouiseJune18 And yet since it does have so much support, it should have been no big deal to reinstate it.
954887935400300544 2018-01-20 01:26:39 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr Stop blaming Dems for your own failure. It disgusts me that the GOP allowed CHIP & DACA to lapse. Until 2017. CHIP was a program with bipartisan support, but now the GOP is so heartless it won't even fund health care for children. Maybe if they could vote & give u money u would.
954886936908492800 2018-01-20 01:22:41 UTC <janet444> @chloechloe616 @SiestaKeySunnin @JP61926104 @santori_lisa Oh yes, no wonder they hired her. People who lack critical thinking skills seem to be the biggest trump supporters (other than Russian trolls)..
954886441816985600 2018-01-20 01:20:43 UTC <janet444> Twitter: More than 677,000 U.S. users engaged with Russian troll accountshttp://politi.co/2Bg1soC
954864505678454784 2018-01-20 23:53:33 UTC <janet444> @esquirerecordsi @Diddlydeeleedee From Vox: During the meeting, in exchange for strong [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] protections, I reluctantly put the border wall on the table for the discussion. Even that was not enough to entice the president to finish the deal, Schumer said.
954864222483165184 2018-01-20 23:52:25 UTC <janet444> Just saw this on VOX & am disappointed Dems would consider wall During the meeting, in exchange for strong [DACA] protections, I reluctantly put the border wall on the table for the discussion. Even that was not enough to entice the president to finish the deal, Schumer said.
954863236549103618 2018-01-20 23:48:30 UTC <janet444> @esquirerecordsi @Diddlydeeleedee Letting CHIP lapse was unconscionable. That should never have happened in the first place.
954863087873556481 2018-01-20 23:47:55 UTC <janet444> @esquirerecordsi @Diddlydeeleedee There's a difference though between immigration reform and DACA. Both DACA and CHIP were already in place & it's the GOP that let them lapse. So it's disingenuous of the GOP to blame the Dems for this.
954802479446872064 2018-01-20 19:47:05 UTC <janet444> @WSJ @NBCNews @amjoyshow This seems right. There's something oddly reassuring in knowing that the majority, at least of those who took this poll, feel the same way I do.
954802307195195392 2018-01-20 19:46:24 UTC <janet444> This seems right. Disgusted would be my #1 choice, with scared very close behind and angry not too far after that.https://twitter.com/amjoyshow/status/954737573225738240

Readers have an obligation to read the news critically. What we don't want is a state where the gov controls the media. Freedom of the press is critical.
954801122874724352 2018-01-20 19:41:41 UTC <janet444> @POTUS @debnsync I'll never understand people like Pat who can't see the reasons we find a trump presidency horrifying. With Obama, you might disagree with his policies but he behaved with dignity and he was qualified for the job. How anyone can support a tantrum-pulling egomaniac is beyond me.
954800128300343296 2018-01-20 19:37:44 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee @LisanArkansas @elec_powell @Tsabbat Exactly. News sources don't report negative info to "shame" anyone. If a party's members are behaving shamefully, that's on them. The American people have a right to know about it.
954799313439346688 2018-01-20 19:34:30 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee Also, don't attack @Acosta and stop attacking the press. That's what is done in dictatorships. Just because you can't conceive of a source within the WH saying this doesn't mean it's not true.
954798793198915586 2018-01-20 19:32:26 UTC <janet444> @realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee Let's see, trump and the GOP ARE blaming Dems for causing a shutdown even though GOP controls Congress. They won't renew CHIP or DACA, even though most people are in favor. Yeah, trump & GOP will be blamed & with good reason. Acosta's story checks out.
954798223071334400 2018-01-20 19:30:10 UTC <janet444> @esquirerecordsi Thanks. I don't know why GOP won't pass DACA anyway or why they let CHIP lapse. It's on GOP and president. They r nervy to blame Dems for shutdown.
954797834167078912 2018-01-20 19:28:37 UTC <janet444> @chloechloe616 @SiestaKeySunnin @santori_lisa @JP61926104 Just because one source says another source is 99% accurate doesn't make it so. You need to examine the sources for trustworthiness and follow the sources they cite to see if everything adds up.
954797366162460672 2018-01-20 19:26:46 UTC <janet444> @chloechloe616 @SiestaKeySunnin @santori_lisa @JP61926104 It's not just because I don't like him that I don't believe he's factual. It's because there is no proof that he is factual. There is a source saying his predictions r 99% accurate. I have no idea whether that's true. But predictions & facts r 2 different things.
954796660600819713 2018-01-20 19:23:57 UTC <janet444> @ModernFam @FrankBoniniNJ @FrankBonini Yeah, that is a good point. But I did love the way she used the professor's line on her to get the job. That was clever.

Predictions r not facts. I didn't bother to find out what predictions they thought he was right about.
954795976400756737 2018-01-20 19:21:14 UTC <janet444> @chloechloe616 @SiestaKeySunnin @JP61926104 @santori_lisa Yeah but it really does scare me what people will believe! She muted the conversation because she will believe an opinionated guy is a legit source of factual information based on 1 other untrustworthy source. I looked it up & they said his predictions were right 99% of the time.

I wasn't expecting u 2 cite Reuters or the Associated Press. But I don't list Occupy Democrats as a legit source. You shouldn't be listing blatantly biased talk show personalities as 99% accurate sources.
954542900754427905 2018-01-19 02:35:36 UTC <janet444> @chloechloe616 @SiestaKeySunnin @santori_lisa @JP61926104 omg you can't be serious! And how has he been proven to be 99% accurate? Keep in mind, this is someone who spends more time spouting opinions than calmly sharing factual information.
954540258925957120 2018-01-19 02:25:06 UTC <janet444> @esquirerecordsi Oh I agree with ALL of that. He's crazy unfit for office. I was just wondering (& I should b more informed on this) if dealing with DACA separately could help avoid shutdown.
954473419189424133 2018-01-19 21:59:31 UTC <janet444> @matthewjdowd @PJLM I never knew about that one. Although I knew they seemed horrified that she would suggest that we have children eat healthy food in school. Yet no matter what this guy does, they defend him. It's insane.
954469945181720576 2018-01-19 21:45:42 UTC <janet444> I'm a dem but asking sincerely so pls reply: Wouldn't it make sense to pass a budget that includes CHIP & then work on DACA separately? I don't know y GOP won't pass DACA since most Americans r in favor, but wouldn't this avoid shutdown?
954468758915035138 2018-01-19 21:40:59 UTC <janet444> @matthewjdowd @achampiontoday But people are basing their opinions on watching Fox and those opinions are nasty and dangerous. I don't think we can change how they're consuming info and fact. I wonder if there is a way to insist they get status as a real news organization and be held to the same standards.
954468341586038786 2018-01-19 21:39:20 UTC <janet444> @matthewjdowd Well, you know, it's not like he put Dijon mustard on his MacDonald's cheeseburger. Or Melania wearing a sleeveless dress. Now those would be scandals.
954466126943195136 2018-01-19 21:30:32 UTC <janet444> @SenDougJones @HouseGOP You should have renewed it when it came up for renewal months ago. Families are afraid. This is on you, not Sen. Jones.

954463759619289091 2018-01-19 21:21:08 UTC <janet444> The wall is a good metaphor for 2 styles of leadership. One is all about building walls & separating people. The other is about cooperation & harmony - building bridges. The second type is the one that makes things better.

It is not the same thing. I'm not surprised that they screwed up. Here's a fact-based version of this:https://www.cbsnews.com/news/undocumented-immigrants-increasingly-filling-arizona-prisons/

It's blatantly biased and full of bs. If it's important to you to read only conservative news outlets, at least read something more respectable like the Wall Street Journal, which leans firmly to the left.

ICE should focus on dangerous undocumented immigrants, not DACA recipients.

And no, I'm not talking about the mainstream media, which isn't perfect but is not "fake news" by any means.

Instead they deport people like the husband and dad who came here at the age of 10 and was torn this week from his wife and children. There's nothing treasonous about knowing how wrong that was.

Nobody has to put these immigrants before our military or health care for children in order to offer them deferred status. It hurts nobody & helps us to have ICE prioritize immigrants who (1/2)

These sites provide sources for the conclusions they come to. Anyone using them can review the sources to come to their own conclusion.

But if you have facts to share, go ahead and send them. I'll try to find time to review them. Meanwhile, if I have time, I'll look for facts about the good she's done.

So far what you've shown me has been unconvincing. During her campaign, I read so many vile stories about her and researched each one. Every time it turned out that the story was inaccurate or 1/2

She was talking in 2014, years later, about how it destroyed her faith in polygraphs and she did laugh about that. She asked a judge to remove her from the case but her request was denied.

953825816470835201 2018-01-17 03:06:10 UTC <janet444> @ModernFam @FrankBoniniNJ Me too. I'd much rather she marry Andy than this professor. Not because i don't like the prof but because they are so mismatched & someone that logical would surely realize why he wanted to marry her (hint: not because they're so well suited to one another).
953825446847709184 2018-01-17 03:04:42 UTC <janet444> @ModernFam @FrankBoniniNJ Oh, I must have either missed that or somehow forgotten it. :-(

953824203156967426 2018-01-17 02:59:45 UTC <janet444> @WilDonnelly And they could have addressed it, but when they had the chance, tea partiers blocked other lawmakers so they could get their pet projects in instead. Instead of addressing maternal mortality rates of a 3rd world country.
953823505338060800 2018-01-17 02:56:59 UTC <janet444> @JesseCharlesLee Are you sure you're not thinking of the lifetime pass? Not defending them. But I think there was a lifetime pass for people over a certain age that was free or very inexpensive and this year it went up to $80.
953822506946912256 2018-01-17 02:53:01 UTC <janet444> @StephenAtHome Oh, gross, he told her she was just like his daughter. Not surprising, but still gross. And he showed up for the "date" (to eat in a hotel room) in sweatpants.

953815719577374720 2018-01-17 02:26:03 UTC <janet444> @ModernFam Okay I do love how Haley used that line.
953814907966885890 2018-01-17 02:22:49 UTC <janet444> @ModernFam No! This makes no sense. Or are all men shallow when they see a pretty girl? Bring back Andy! I don't even know what happened with Andy, he just disappeared & they were perfect together.
953814581410975745 2018-01-17 02:21:31 UTC <janet444> @TheNewsIntern1 Me too! And I do not buy this professor wanting to marry Haley. I knew he'd be attracted to her, but irl wouldn't he want to be someone he had something in common with? Or is he both brilliant and shallow?
953799361728827392 2018-01-17 01:21:03 UTC <janet444> @JCMcCracken And they're not worried about how corrupt that makes them sound? Of course not - they've been behaving this way for a year and getting away with it.
953798997713485826 2018-01-17 01:19:36 UTC <janet444> @christinawilkie Calling something a "potential event" sounds like something a fake news source might say. Or a regime that tries to undermine the legitimate press the way dictatorships have done in the past. Double talk and nonsense.
953797352992714754 2018-01-17 01:13:04 UTC <janet444> @SInow Was that piece u did comparing trump to pro athletes for real? Or was it really, really subtle satire?
953796945411223552 2018-01-17 01:11:27 UTC <janet444> @FullFrontalSamB @Grey_Obelisk Sports Illustrated ran an absurd piece comparing him to pro athletes based on his weight and height and saying that college teams would have snapped him up. Seriously.
953795735434268672 2018-01-17 01:06:38 UTC <janet444> @MSNBC @Amy_Siskind OMG did he do that? I didn't know about that.

It's sickening.
953795170285256704 2018-01-17 01:04:23 UTC <janet444> @SPIN @williamlegate @Planet_Phoebe @JLustwerk @thuggalaflare @FrAnKiE_SHeHuLK He has said things about Ivanka that I've found disgusting. And I think about Tiffany when she was a baby. I just think if he openly said he was attracted to his 12-year-old daughter on live TV we'd have known about it when it happened and never forgotten it.

953792410844368897 2018-01-17 00:53:26 UTC <janet444> @SPIN @williamlegate @Planet_Phoebe No! He's said some truly disgusting things but are you sure he said THAT?
953792239200800770 2018-01-17 00:52:45 UTC <janet444> @SPIN Oh, that's just creepy, esp. given the way he is around his actual daughter (the one he pays attention to).
953790451806605312 2018-01-17 00:45:38 UTC <janet444> @AngryBlackLady I'll just add that we'd be lucky to have a president like HRC. We could have had caviar but we chose a can of spam that was opened and left out to rot.
953790122729902080 2018-01-17 00:44:20 UTC <janet444> @AngryBlackLady Is this in the NY Times? I'm sorry to say I do care if they would publish such nonsense. The idea that HRC is a worse alternative is beyond absurd. I can't even think of a word to describe how absurd it is. It horrifies me every day that trump is in the White House.

HRC could do nothing right despite being accomplished, brilliant and caring. And I told people the same thing - marital decisions are nobody's business. Had she been conservative, they'd have praised her for it.
953744850431758338 2018-01-17 21:44:26 UTC <janet444> @MiraSorvino @JulieAnnLily @DoraTweetting Oh, that's terrible news. I hope things will change but it's going to take a long time and a lot of people will suffer deeply while trump's supporters insist that all of this is fine. :-(
953744091459870720 2018-01-17 21:41:25 UTC <janet444> @SharonHooper Yes, there are too many people these days who insist that we need to bypass anger and fear and "negative" emotions. I'm glad I'm seeing more and more people advocating for honoring our feelings before letting them go.
953742937577480194 2018-01-17 21:36:50 UTC <janet444> @chrissyteigen These settlements with NDAs should be illegal. They allow criminals to keep victimizing people. Victims should have better resources than settlements that require them to keep quiet.
953742238135279616 2018-01-17 21:34:03 UTC <janet444> @MiraSorvino @JulieAnnLily @DoraTweetting It breaks my heart that this happened. There was no good reason to tear that family apart and I'm sick of people being so heartless and hateful towards undocumented immigrants. He was brought here at 9 & was doing everything he could to fill out the paperwork.
