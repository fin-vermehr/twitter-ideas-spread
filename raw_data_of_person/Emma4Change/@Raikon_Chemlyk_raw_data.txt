969753423452213248 2018-03-02 01:56:47 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Terrashiva @xcentrik4 I did at least put in some lemon and garlic which tastes pretty good 
969752989077573632 2018-03-02 01:55:04 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @xcentrik4 Oooh that's a great idea! I actually forgot about the butter this time, I'll have to remember next time!

969220014820724737 2018-03-01 14:37:13 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Good morning everyone!
969024802622181376 2018-02-28 01:41:31 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Golfhaus May be a tangential question but have you ever had any trouble flying with the injections? Like can you take them in your carry on?

968861994567766021 2018-02-28 14:54:34 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 @workshopcraft Ooooh, we're blood related, meaning we share DNA, meaning I can think of myself as a voodoo doll  thanks for that

968654195980226560 2018-02-27 01:08:51 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @MardiGraskid Good advice! I was actually doing research on the meds while the doctor was telling me what they were.
968649270822924289 2018-02-27 00:49:17 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Alright folks, I got my diagnosis and I am confirmed for having MS. It's scary, it's big, it's going to force me to make some big changes in my life style (diet for starters, as well as getting over my gear of needles), and it's not gonna ruin me. I am and will be okay 
968648575877046272 2018-02-27 00:46:31 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @AddyLinear I don't get these kinds of ads and I'm jealous 
968636862989520897 2018-02-27 23:59:59 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I was told that the crippling headaches could very well be from the spinal tap and the prescription is caffeine so when I get home I am having a MEDICINAL Dr. Pepper
968607613146599424 2018-02-27 22:03:45 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 You got this! \o/
968554376829849605 2018-02-27 18:32:12 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @mcrKirei @Tavinnea Okay cool! Thanks :)
968549398895628296 2018-02-27 18:12:26 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @mcrKirei @Tavinnea I had an IV in my arm for five days, they took it out 3 days ago and my arm has been sore and bruised since and I'm freaking out 
968505445186002944 2018-02-27 15:17:46 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 No I know, I just don't know what's normal for IV's, so there's a small amount of "oh well now THIS is happening" thoughts going on
968503672165543938 2018-02-27 15:10:44 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So my arm has been bruised and sore since they took the IV out but it's not growing or anything, but the last time I said "just wait, it'll go away" my hands stopped working after a few months but then I don't want to waste the neurologists time with what might be normal but-
968162895510016000 2018-02-26 16:36:36 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @WBFBDeni @Tyranostradamus @Yirggzmb I'm very curious to know what this is now 
968078025047887872 2018-02-26 10:59:21 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @nite97m From what I've seen, its supposed to be released in Autumn 2018.
967982569345175552 2018-02-25 04:40:03 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @nite97m I'm waiting for PC solely because my usual gaming crew mostly only has computers instead of console. It is absolutely killing me to wait though
967939524117565442 2018-02-25 01:49:00 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> HOLY SHIT #BlackPanther IS SO GOOD
967888816408350722 2018-02-25 22:27:30 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset I will say, it could be anything cause what I actually put in the search bar was "martial hearts"
967888430712721409 2018-02-25 22:25:59 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset I did not mean to do that, sorry!
967491254044020736 2018-02-24 20:07:44 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Last steroid infusion done. Got the IV out. Gonna sleep well tonight 
967453851333877762 2018-02-24 17:39:07 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> This has been... A pretty shit month.
967122036740050951 2018-02-23 19:40:36 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @MalcolmTolmanVO I see it's got in-app purchases, does it cost money to use their plans?
967120265766473728 2018-02-23 19:33:34 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset Oh absolutely. I'm looking at cheap alternatives at the moment. With my hand still not being perfect I think it's best if I limit my preparation to thinks that don't require coordination. That and I just hate the action of coming rice
967119138425638912 2018-02-23 19:29:05 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I have tried so many times to have an actual healthy diet but it always reverts back to soda and snacks. Now that my immune system is the way it is, I gotta be more careful. May look into an electric rice cooker and food processor.
966523122890563584 2018-02-21 04:00:44 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Terrashiva @mcrKirei Terra's never been to my house. Maybe now I have to KEEP it that way to keep the mystery alive
966522713585192961 2018-02-21 03:59:06 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @mcrKirei They left the IV in me (it's a plastic tube instead of a needle so not too uncomfortable). So all they have to do is hook me up when I get there 
966447471198195714 2018-02-21 23:00:07 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I was allowed to go home today. I have to try to stay off my feet for a couple days, and I have to go back to the hospital over the next few days for medicine injections (mediicinjections?), but at least I'm home with my cats.
966152890942480384 2018-02-20 03:29:34 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Walking around the hospital thinking everything's fine. I don't realize until I'm back in my room that only one of my strings is tied and I'm just flashing all of the nurses and other patients 
966126298216136712 2018-02-20 01:43:53 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @BrendanDRenders Yeah, due to my nerves.
966076986438414337 2018-02-20 22:27:57 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Update: I am being admitted to the hospital

966003640342401024 2018-02-20 17:36:29 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Folded_Pixel But on the bright side it's serious enough that they're willing to expedite my tests and maybe get them today/tomorrow instead of next week like the doctor originally thought
965990034552782853 2018-02-20 16:42:26 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> The neurologist basically said it's not a pinched nerve like everyone was hoping and the best case scenario is multiple sclerosis.

962861635441430529 2018-02-11 01:31:17 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Three different doctors gave me similar diagnoses from an inconclusive test, the consensus is my situation is serious but not immediately life threatening, I have to go see a neurologist for more tests. Hopefully tomorrow as I've already told work the plain is tomorrow.
962094583004975104 2018-02-09 22:43:18 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I wrote though query over the course of the last 3 weeks and I've gotten to a point where I have no idea what certain parts of the query DO anymore

950489705786822656 2018-01-08 22:09:39 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Is today the day that I actually TELL my a sales rep that I don't get paid enough to deal with his bullshit? 2 hours to go, today just might be the day

949095113187307525 2018-01-04 01:48:02 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Ugh, the main character is a "chosen one" trope. No longer enjoying this experience.

949091787389456384 2018-01-04 01:34:50 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> One of the laziest plot blurb formats: "This is a story about a [stereotype] who can SUDDENLY [mystical verb]."
949077664907825152 2018-01-04 00:38:42 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I just had to remove Skype and Outlook from my phone. If work wants to give me a company phone once I'm hired on, great - but until then, the lack of separation between personal time and work time is maddening.
949072295720636421 2018-01-04 00:17:22 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> It has just dawned on me that that the pins and needles sensation in my thigh is not the everyday run-of-the-mill pins and needs but it's the kind where I can't feel my entire thigh for the last couple weeks and I didn't realize. Guess I'm going to the doctor.

946821509041016833 2017-12-29 19:13:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> This new year, it's good to remember that even though we may be returning to the same spot in our journey around the sun, it takes the solar system 230 million years to orbit the milky way. So we never truly are in the same place twice in our lifetime, make the most of it now.

944338768886104066 2017-12-22 22:48:02 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 That's the thing: I have one. I started out taking them in the evening so I have a reminder. But I hit okay on it a couple nights ago and then forgot to take the pill so I took it the next morning and told myself I would take it when I woke up, but I don't think I have been.
944336767259435008 2017-12-22 22:40:04 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So here's a fun story. I keep forgetting to take my meds. I think it's been like 3 days.
944296011937304577 2017-12-22 19:58:08 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Through the magic of asking a coworker to do it for me, I got my SQL query!

943982489973985280 2017-12-21 23:12:18 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I live finding out while I'm on the freeway that I have a super low tire. Thank you kind strangers but also fuck this situation. All I can do is sit in a parking lot and wait for the cavalry to come with quarters so I can re-air myself.

943527060747808768 2017-12-20 17:02:35 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 The problem is that I'm being REALLY pressed to get this project done and I just don't have the SQL know how yet to pull the data we need.

Suddenly jar jar Binks and Loki were Disney princesses too. Honestly, Disney could buy coca cola and people would say Santa Claus and some polar bears are all Disney princesses.

932345986218852352 2017-11-19 20:32:59 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> After watching some videos about using game maker studio 2, I actually feel a little more motivated about getting my game created. But first - a nap.
932237709401362432 2017-11-19 13:22:44 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Or arcade game. Whichever came first
932237078649335808 2017-11-19 13:20:14 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I'm still kinda in shock from finding out that they're actually making a movie about the N64 game Rampage

931554763577098240 2017-11-17 16:08:57 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 That's sound advice. I think I've problem myself indispensable enough. I'm gonna see what my boss says before I try to take any further actions.
931551352563621888 2017-11-17 15:55:24 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I just did a scary thing. I actually emailed my boss asking for a raise. Let's hope my diplomatic speak helped.

929106393399025664 2017-11-10 22:00:00 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac I always feared, but I was too scared of the diagnosis

926227937216614402 2017-11-02 23:22:03 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Batronyx I would love to be a radio DJ for a day. The power imbued in that role is often underappreciated.
926212165366964225 2017-11-02 22:19:23 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Starrlett20 I do, and to make it even better, Wikipedia even includes spices as condiments as well.
926194875699224576 2017-11-02 21:10:40 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Siiiiigh I guess I better get the defensive driving class out of the way.
926141624077430785 2017-11-02 17:39:04 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Like, I know it's been 70 years and that's very exciting. But what about the parents who can't just take off work for the same reason?
926141166504108032 2017-11-02 17:37:15 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Apparently HISD is closing all of their schools tomorrow because we won the world series. That sounds like a bit much???
926137580806135815 2017-11-02 17:23:00 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset That's a good point. I personally would say do something youre proud of. As cliche as that sounds. Whether it's Ash ketchum or something new
926133475308195841 2017-11-02 17:06:41 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset Do you have ample enough time before the presentation to make something?

925856552308957185 2017-11-01 22:46:18 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Somehow my tweet notifications got turned off (possibly when I got the new phone), so I've missed a lot of streams I would have loved to see
925504797448507393 2017-10-31 23:28:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Also I googled "top online computer science degrees" and their Information Technology program was in the top 3
925504436985847808 2017-10-31 23:27:07 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Colorado State University - Global Campus. Cuts out the dorm and such fees and makes the commute s lot shorter
925504101877796864 2017-10-31 23:25:47 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Woo! So I've changed schools again, but I've settled on an online 4 year school. One way or another, I'm getting this degree eventually

923378735511982080 2017-10-25 02:40:20 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset I've promised someone else I would play Metal Gear Solid V as soon as I read the wonder woman book but I'll add yakuza 0 to the list 
923377598536781824 2017-10-25 02:35:49 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I finished persona 5. Now I need something else to devote another 130 hours to.

918506180493873152 2017-10-12 15:58:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So far, from what I've learned, SQL seems so much simpler than absolutely everything I've learned up to this point.

912779278554628097 2017-09-26 20:41:53 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Picked up some extra work last Saturday - very casual setting. Music, jeans, t-shirts, do what you want but get the work done.
912654349515575299 2017-09-26 12:25:27 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So a parking ticket goes to the doctor  "doc can you tell me what's wrong with me?"  Doctor: "well the good news is, you're gonna be fine."

900724790176174080 2017-08-24 14:21:39 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 That's quite a view! 
900500301165318146 2017-08-23 23:29:36 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Spunkeydoodle Same here. It frustrates me how "teen novel" it seems in the trailer when the original was way more "thriller"
900494074414759938 2017-08-23 23:04:52 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I'll admit that the new death note series does not raise a lot of hopes, but I'm excited to see Ryuk voiced by Willem Dafoe
900484552438755330 2017-08-23 22:27:02 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I did it 30 minutes later...

900389851241086977 2017-08-23 16:10:43 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset That makes sense! Especially since it looks like the kid in the ninjago movie has a new set of das issues.
900376468886134784 2017-08-23 15:17:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> How do you explain to someone that the moon phase does not affect the tides and stars don't cause hurricanes?
900343261994340352 2017-08-23 13:05:35 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So are we to assume the lego batman movie and the ninjago movie are both Will Ferrell being a good dad now?
900175090536546305 2017-08-22 01:57:20 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> "This app is a scam because I used too much data and am having to pay for it" - a real review I saw on a video app

897865915290791936 2017-08-16 17:01:30 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Yirggzmb And if platforms are above or below you. And if a platform is above you, you couldn't see anything coming at you below 
897823495924666369 2017-08-16 14:12:56 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 @ChronoStreamer True, link to the past does have some segments where you have to get onto various platforms. But I feel like a true platformer needs jumping

888472300860977152 2017-07-21 18:54:38 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @dot83 i feel guilty for letting you live vicariously through me. You're no longer vegetarian vicariously through me.pic.twitter.com/UCmBZOKC0N
888470028491911168 2017-07-21 18:45:36 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> The more I look at that Reynolds stache the more it becomes clear it doesn't belong there
888469007321489409 2017-07-21 18:41:32 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So I'm at mellow mushroom and while I wait for my pizza I photoshopped Burt Reynolds mustache onto myselfpic.twitter.com/56qDEy2tsB
888424476865703941 2017-07-21 15:44:36 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> You know, I don't know that I like the implication of the pax pox liking my tweet about going to pax. Sentient disease sounds terrifying.pic.twitter.com/AshHsYOdu1
888341837429313536 2017-07-21 10:16:13 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @MaxAmpere_ My car is already here at work but I am definitely considering getting an uber home.
888339423997374464 2017-07-21 10:06:37 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So I ended up staying out until 1:30AM so now I'm trying to push through, I never slept last night. I have three energy drinks for today 
888224845267439621 2017-07-20 02:31:20 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So I forgot my ID to go drinking so no Thursday night alcohol for me after all. Might be for the best honestly XD
888186331318407169 2017-07-20 23:58:17 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I highly recommend it
888186214808944641 2017-07-20 23:57:49 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So I just played bioshock infinite for the first time and apparently it gives me super motion sickness
888179881388978176 2017-07-20 23:32:39 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Cool so bioshock infinite got real dark real fast and the creepy giant statue watching over doesn't make it better
888172425803968513 2017-07-20 23:03:02 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Tell me about some people who you may remember being kind in passing. I love these stories and I just spammed mine at you all.
888172205741309957 2017-07-20 23:02:09 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Never forget that your impact doesn't have to be global. It can be interpersonal and you will have made an impact. The little victories.
888172019812061184 2017-07-20 23:01:25 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I went to a P!atD concert where I sang along and a woman complimented my singing in between songs.
888171872508149760 2017-07-20 23:00:50 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> There was a group of 2 couples who would come into my mcdonalds routinely for some coffee. They invited me to sit with them once.
888171597739282433 2017-07-20 22:59:44 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> There was an old man who frequented my mcdonalds I managed. He had a very complicated order for his mother but was always so patient.
888171445125304320 2017-07-20 22:59:08 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> There's a woman at my local Taco Bell who remembers me by name. She calls me by name and I adore her for it.
888171335444291585 2017-07-20 22:58:42 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> As long as you are kind and gracious to others, they will think of you often. Don't let the need to "change the world" define your life.
888144809365577729 2017-07-20 21:13:18 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @mcrKirei The twist: I spilled food and reached for a kleenex instead
888143843794837504 2017-07-20 21:09:27 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> She opens the window and hands me napkins. She gives me back my card and hands me napkins. I open the bag- more napkins. What is your plan?!
888131221892472833 2017-07-20 20:19:18 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Golfhaus Same man. For all the shit I gave them, I did enjoy the music.
888126799120547843 2017-07-20 20:01:44 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Thank you for the lookout though, I appreciate the suppirt
888126729021030400 2017-07-20 20:01:27 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Oh no, I'm not being forced. If I don't want the drink this evening I won't.
888124466668085248 2017-07-20 19:52:28 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So I said I'd never drink alcohol again. Apparently I'm being taken out drinking tonight to celebrate my birthday. We'll see how this goes.
888020604498186240 2017-07-20 12:59:45 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> For instance, "I've already sent an email about that" and they keep telling you what boils down to "we need to send an email about this"
888020428677107713 2017-07-20 12:59:03 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> You ever find yourself faced w/ someone who continues making their point after you've told them 3 times what their point is going to be?
888016665967026177 2017-07-20 12:44:06 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac It actually gives me an idea for game to play at conventions 
888016225472835585 2017-07-20 12:42:21 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac This makes it sound like some sort of Robert roulette.

887726401536897026 2017-07-19 17:30:41 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Eneija Home has become people to me. Home is the people I can be comfortable and myself with. Whether it's blood family or the family I chose.
887724780862001152 2017-07-19 17:24:15 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Eneija 13 houses in my lifetime. 10 of which have been in the last 6 years.
887723825084981249 2017-07-19 17:20:27 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I just read an interview alluding that we have to wait for Borderlands 3 before we get a second Telltale game. 15 years it is 
887710054434168832 2017-07-19 16:25:44 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I just registered for PAXSOUTH

887513255773712384 2017-07-18 03:23:44 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac @Davkas2005 Sure it was XD
887512302534184960 2017-07-18 03:19:56 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @milliemaytweet It's a music man!!!! 
887511916062662657 2017-07-18 03:18:24 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I thought that was what that was about, just wanted to make sure XD
887511628589223936 2017-07-18 03:17:16 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Everything alright?
887494822747144195 2017-07-18 02:10:29 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Yirggzmb @DolinmysterLP Sadly treasure planet and Atlantis both lost money for Disney and so are under rated  I just hate seeing it happen to actually good films
887494083194884097 2017-07-18 02:07:32 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Yirggzmb @DolinmysterLP It was brilliant but she's right. It's one of the only Disney movies that's ever lost money.
887480412464979968 2017-07-18 01:13:13 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I hate how Disney actually refers to Mulan as a Disney princess (despite very much not being a princess) and not kida (literally a princess)
887469652099641344 2017-07-18 00:30:28 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I'm watching Tavinnea's awesome stream. Come check it out here: https://mixer.com/Tavinnea via @WatchMixer
887424833478426625 2017-07-18 21:32:22 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Shout out to whoever made it so toasters don't stay down if they're not plugged in.
887421739575201792 2017-07-18 21:20:04 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Yeah, probably. I'll buy my ticket within the next couple weeks.
887400308929908736 2017-07-18 19:54:55 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> But like, at least now I know where I want my life to go and I'm figuring out the "how" as I go along.
887400204839923712 2017-07-18 19:54:30 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I wanted to give people a chance to answer before I jumped on this. Last year I had a plan but no goal. This year I have a goal and no plan.
887372244711854081 2017-07-18 18:03:24 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Yirggzmb Ooooh confidence and traveling alone are definitely huge, congrats!
887372057993990144 2017-07-18 18:02:39 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 It has been very nice coming back to the community and seeing how confident and kind you are in these interactions now :)
887368028001796098 2017-07-18 17:46:39 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @mkbeanbuilds @Davkas2005 This interaction has changed my life forever.
887367151774040064 2017-07-18 17:43:10 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @mkbeanbuilds @Davkas2005 You're joking!!! How did you find that so quickly XD
887367029224853505 2017-07-18 17:42:40 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac That's both beautiful and endearing. I know your new family definitely appreciates seeing you laugh more 
887365738931081216 2017-07-18 17:37:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Terrashiva That sounds like a good year then! Minus the bone moving of course, unless that's one of the positive outcomes of surgery

887364516396314624 2017-07-18 17:32:41 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @mkbeanbuilds All in all, that's not too bad for a whole year :P
887363351248068609 2017-07-18 17:28:04 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> How would you say you're different today from who you were 1 year ago?
887304328922484738 2017-07-18 13:33:31 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Cats_of_Pop There is no F in team either
887133287805792256 2017-07-17 02:13:52 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Enjoy!!
887124672722161665 2017-07-17 01:39:38 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> watching "The Gay and Wondrous Life of Caleb Gallo" makes me less afraid to call people on the phone
887024712034942977 2017-07-17 19:02:26 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac @TigerSpirit_ @Davkas2005 I only suggest bringing food aboard the plane. It won't taste the same at altitude but Airplane food is SUPER unhealthy.
887017540949602310 2017-07-17 18:33:56 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TigerSpirit_ I had a similar experience  I was also in a middle seat one of the flight's so I would wake up and find my head on a stranger's shoulder.
887016163120697345 2017-07-17 18:28:27 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TigerSpirit_ Get a neck pillow. Trust me. There's no comfortable way to sleep with the provided pillows.
886984834811383809 2017-07-17 16:23:58 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @dot83 I was a little confused about plums in cake. What cake is that exactly?

886605309711708160 2017-07-16 15:15:52 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @milliemaytweet It also may have been a bad idea to put more alcohol nearby in case I got thirsty/dehydrated
886605202291400704 2017-07-16 15:15:27 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @milliemaytweet Same, I think. I did not enjoy the experience of being dizzy and not being able to do anything about it.
886604533123743745 2017-07-16 15:12:47 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @milliemaytweet Solid advice. I genuinely don't remember if I liked the taste last night or not.
886595459053232128 2017-07-16 14:36:44 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Better than two hours ago.

886407356413865984 2017-07-15 02:09:17 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> We only had one smart one among us. He genuinely only tried a little bit of each drink While the rest of us drank all of it. This isn't good
886403400618962944 2017-07-15 01:53:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So we're playing "keep talking and nobody explodes" drunk-ish

885558594980151297 2017-07-13 17:56:36 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> You have to be careful with anthromorphising inanimate objects. There's an "am I god" rabbit hole you have to steer clear of.

885534966209290240 2017-07-13 16:22:43 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Samsung @Graphoniac Something similar exists, but for emergency situations where you don't want to draw attention. Look at SafeTrek.

885271029416964098 2017-07-12 22:53:55 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @BrendanDRenders and it ended up being the only word I ever put in there XD (2/2)
885270948282335232 2017-07-12 22:53:36 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @BrendanDRenders My 2nd grade teacher gave me a journal to keep big words in. I asked the meaning of probability 3 times before I wrote it down (1/2)
885269966802620416 2017-07-12 22:49:42 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Someone once called me smart because I used the word "abscond"... Little do they know, I only know the word because of homestuck.
885245550823694337 2017-07-12 21:12:41 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 @HauntedKnight74 @Yirggzmb you're all great, I love this community so much :')
885244094594854912 2017-07-12 21:06:53 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset It's also good to not record at full mic volume. I learned through trial and error that that's what our main problem was on popcats.
885239068883288064 2017-07-12 20:46:55 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> We're getting fiber for our home internet 
884838198182072320 2017-07-11 18:14:00 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 @MadSlothy My actual brother deserves an actual lot of things XD unfortunately I'm at work and didn't want it to seem like I forgot until later
884837323585835010 2017-07-11 18:10:32 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 btw happy birthday!!
884758587628806144 2017-07-11 12:57:39 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 "Don't make lemonade! Make life take the lemons back! Demand to see life's manager!"
884625870224281600 2017-07-10 04:10:17 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @milliemaytweet @TheNerdCloset @Davkas2005 "Sneak" he says, as if he didn't pour the glass 
884592591370694656 2017-07-10 01:58:03 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @milliemaytweet @TheNerdCloset So now that I'm turning 15, I can't wait to try alcohol :P
884590467312209920 2017-07-10 01:49:36 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @milliemaytweet In six days. It would be six years if @TheNerdCloset had her way.
884585027362861056 2017-07-10 01:27:59 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset just a friendly reminder that I am turning 21 :)
884548852052889600 2017-07-10 23:04:15 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Oh I do have Ren'Py! I totally forgot which hard drive I installed it on 
884526605791617024 2017-07-10 21:35:51 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 The program I'm going to use to make my dating sim
884523471631519744 2017-07-10 21:23:23 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> We're off wifi until tomorrow evening and I totally forgot to install Ren'Py on my PC after I reinstalled windows
884464852869283841 2017-07-10 17:30:28 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac Winter isn't for months
884407619250737152 2017-07-10 13:43:02 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Have I ever played D&D? Once or twice. Have I agreed to DM a game this Saturday? Absolutely.
884119441813852161 2017-07-09 18:37:55 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Absolutely not. When two different people say "whoa your hair is getting big" it's time...
884117607862894592 2017-07-09 18:30:38 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Haircut day!pic.twitter.com/RpVvfviXhP
883898319948349440 2017-07-08 03:59:16 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I wasn't expecting it because I genuinely didn't like the game when I first tried it
883896801471991808 2017-07-08 03:53:14 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> This is the fourth game in a row that I said would be the last game
883884436382777348 2017-07-08 03:04:06 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> "I'm only garbage cause our team is garbage" yeah okay guy who keeps rushing their entire team when the healer's dead 
883804144565235714 2017-07-08 21:45:03 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I just learned that Ren'Py has a games list?? let the research commence!
883782408608391170 2017-07-08 20:18:40 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I was not lied to, Spider-Man: Homecoming was amazing!
883523577064169473 2017-07-07 03:10:10 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @milliemaytweet @Davkas2005 I'm really good as a healer though. That's not what I mind. Just the players yelling at me when they're the ones running in unprepared 
883521782292107264 2017-07-07 03:03:02 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @milliemaytweet I dunno I feel like if I quit being healer then it really is mostly my fault if we lose. I cant help their bad playing, but I can do my best
883506848908931073 2017-07-07 02:03:42 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Me, 3 days ago: hey I should try going back to overwatch! Me now: I have done nothing but heal unworthy people for hours
883491140619706368 2017-07-07 01:01:17 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Taraceroid It's not exactly the same feel but I would also suggest Murakami by Made In Heights
883464860906000384 2017-07-07 23:16:51 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Enemy team kept trying to stop playing and we didn't know so we killed them. So team member killed them then said hi to their body XD
883444963471757313 2017-07-07 21:57:47 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 According to boss man I have to go into the office for a few hours this weekend.
883442771885006848 2017-07-07 21:49:05 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> apparently they mess with the security settings for the work VPN a lot and whatever the reason, it has made it so I can't work from home now
883434219921342465 2017-07-07 21:15:06 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> For the record, popcats is an nsfw channel. Nothing weird or nudey, just generally adult humor. "Viewer discretion is advised"

883114623075057664 2017-07-06 00:05:08 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I got a toxic player in my group in Overwatch. I absolutely made snarky remarks to make him madder
883095607677788161 2017-07-06 22:49:34 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> The first time you get Epic in Overwatchpic.twitter.com/F8AXzO0sJw
883076914419826692 2017-07-06 21:35:17 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @xcentrik4 Oh yeah that one is a good friendship ender :P
883076454975766530 2017-07-06 21:33:28 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> What's your favorite song?
882814354047074304 2017-07-05 04:11:58 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> If someone is important to you, tell them. Words don't lose their meaning until the emotions behind them are gone.
882795179178151940 2017-07-05 02:55:46 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I absolutely adore Orisa 
882780328200425474 2017-07-05 01:56:46 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac so are you gonna tell Twitter something we might not know about you? 
882780120569851904 2017-07-05 01:55:56 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac But before Hong Kong I generally just found someone I knew and followed them when I was in a new place.
882779951556165632 2017-07-05 01:55:16 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac Oh I wanna do one more! I tend to follow people. It wasn't until I went to Hong Kong that I actually felt comfortable going out alone
882766181337366533 2017-07-05 01:00:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I think I'm going to try Overwatch again.
882758026133897216 2017-07-05 00:28:08 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Btw, @Davkas2005 is gonna be 30 in a week and I'm turning 21 4 days later. My mom is having a crisis.
882753479160279041 2017-07-05 00:10:04 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac @Davkas2005 All I have is a Facebook link  I can ask mom in a little while
882750735749976064 2017-07-05 23:59:10 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac I do! It has become one of my favorites 
882749436107075584 2017-07-05 23:54:00 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac I have made it a bad habit to just buy games for my friends so I can play with them. It's getting out of hand 
882443173552939008 2017-07-04 03:37:02 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I might actually try this. S1 pissed me off so much, I never watched anything past that.
882441741273632770 2017-07-04 03:31:20 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 See that's what I've always thought. I figured they didn't know they were getting a S2 so they tried to condense everything.
882441477078515712 2017-07-04 03:30:17 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 What happened with the development?
882441178779668481 2017-07-04 03:29:06 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Really? Something in the story?
882416991990153216 2017-07-04 01:53:00 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I don't know if this is actually why they're called docile but you can pick up this one and he's just fluid the whole time.
882414977906245632 2017-07-04 01:44:59 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 His name is lucky. Apparently he's a purebred Ragdoll with documents and all.
882414212814958592 2017-07-04 01:41:57 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @milliemaytweet I did it anyway. Don't regret it.

882385318376353793 2017-07-04 23:47:08 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @milliemaytweet I can gleefully say I had forgotten this existed.
882384625200496640 2017-07-04 23:44:23 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I actually know someone who never once saw "The dress". He had no idea what I was talking about.

882045571741220865 2017-07-03 01:17:06 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> My solution to not being able to get past a quest in Boderlands DLC is buying said DLC for my girlfriend 
881953332893548544 2017-07-03 19:10:35 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Do you ever get anxious about how EVERYTHING costs something?  "I shouldn't eat this ramen... I've only got $11"
881346464689115136 2017-07-01 02:59:06 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> It's barely July 1st, why have the fireworks already started???
881318723663089664 2017-07-01 01:08:52 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Cats_of_Pop has 20 subscribers on YouTube omg!!!!
880964124087390208 2017-06-30 01:39:49 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> That's why I specify that it'd be optional. I want people to be able to play the game both ways, if they'd like.
880942882840092673 2017-06-30 00:15:25 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> If it were optional, how would you feel about a dating sim that ran on real time? I.e. "Please come back tomorrow for your date with (name)"
880912920451874818 2017-06-30 22:16:21 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @.my posts from 5 years ago:  Hey can you maybe shut up?

880192426215825408 2017-06-28 22:33:22 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 It's an music writing program. I actually think you'd have some fun with it.
880191294714327040 2017-06-28 22:28:52 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So I thought I had deleted an entire song in OpenMPT but it turns out the scroll bar had just freaked out and it was our of view.
880191117043609600 2017-06-28 22:28:10 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset Wooo I get to keep my acorns!
880190306150301697 2017-06-28 22:24:56 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset I'm willing to bet 3 acorns and 18 cents that they're functional

880016336914612224 2017-06-28 10:53:39 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> For the record: Yes there may be some questionable games in my steam library. I'm doing research for the dating sim I'm helping to make 
879725876480544772 2017-06-27 15:39:28 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 In other news, the Gulf of Mexico is wet 
879514634033778688 2017-06-26 01:40:04 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I saw some forums talking about that. Might wanna check it out
879512710223974400 2017-06-26 01:32:25 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Mine wouldn't even open to begin with. I ended up reinstalling windows
879500234581315584 2017-06-26 00:42:50 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> "Oh hi, how are you doing? Because I'm a potato. So there's that."
878942392115752960 2017-06-25 11:46:10 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> OHHHH THANK GOD THERE IS A GOD
878942144093990912 2017-06-25 11:45:11 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> There's no chance stardew Valley saves online is there?
878784395750060033 2017-06-24 01:18:21 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Dually noted. I wish I had thought to copy the file over before the reinstall.
878781292015484929 2017-06-24 01:06:01 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> On the bright side, I didn't lose ALL of my files. However, I am still pretty sure I lost all of my saves because I lost ProgramFiles(x64)
878781058757668864 2017-06-24 01:05:06 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I had an error with kernelbase.dll, Some data stacking error (as the microsoft tech called it), and I had to reinstall windows 10.
878780837336145921 2017-06-24 01:04:13 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Pretty sure I lost all of my game saves because of this whole ordeal with Portal 2.
878753627850059776 2017-06-24 23:16:05 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I got passed off to a different Microsoft tech and now this guy is trying to sell me on Dota 2 
878734157832171520 2017-06-24 21:58:43 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Waited for a response from Steam Support for 7 hours. Now I've been trying to deal with Microsoft for 2 hours. I just wanna play portal 2.
878724950072414208 2017-06-24 21:22:08 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> It's cute how microsoft techs are so insistent to ask for your phone number as if they don't already know your shoe size
878567652075216896 2017-06-24 10:57:05 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> bought 5 games from steam sale yesterday, the two I was most excited to play again (portal 2 and L4D2) won't run and no forums help 
878368577769717760 2017-06-23 21:46:02 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> And the semester off isn't really by choice. The way Fafsa works has basically bullied me into a semester off.
878368335645351936 2017-06-23 21:45:05 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I genuinely don't understand how people make it through school in one go. I had to take a gap year and now I'm taking a semester off too.
878351063656546304 2017-06-23 20:36:27 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> My work team is a bad joke: a Jew, a Muslim, a satanist, a Christian, an atheist, a bhuddist-Christian, and a Jehovah's Witness.
878253289086697472 2017-06-23 14:07:55 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Steam sale is both a drug and an enabler simultaneously
878241763865047041 2017-06-23 13:22:08 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 It eventually resolved itself
878235621734719488 2017-06-23 12:57:43 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> One second I was zipping a file, the next second my screen was FILLED with 90KB files and I couldn't cancel the compression
878234495404593154 2017-06-23 12:53:15 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I told 7zip to split the file into 90K instead of 90 M and I'm so screwed, my computer won't respond
877975030516170752 2017-06-22 19:42:13 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Anxiety: You have 65 things to freak out about, text someone about all of them.  Anxiety: Well now look, you texted them too many times.
877501422299996160 2017-06-21 12:20:16 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> You know what? You're right Shia lebouf! I will just do it! I will make my dreams come true!
877468686193483776 2017-06-21 10:10:12 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @MadSlothy It's a lot cheaper in Hong Kong though.

877119495331958784 2017-06-20 11:02:38 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Have a good day folks, my flight back to Houston is about to take off

877094256422211584 2017-06-20 09:22:21 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @MadSlothy My camera is too large of an electronic, I can't take it on the plane with me. Apparently I'll get it back in Houston.
877091179040395266 2017-06-20 09:10:07 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> 3 passport checks, 1 security bag-check, had to check my camera because of brand new regulations, all of this before the plane even arrived.
877064225281130496 2017-06-20 07:23:01 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> There's ONE in America and it's in some town in California. I'm more likely to meet a former POTUS than I am to eat pepper lunch.

876757059219279873 2017-06-19 11:02:26 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I made a reasonable well-thought-out purchase.pic.twitter.com/K5D1ugAwjd

876412256535232512 2017-06-18 12:12:19 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 It was okay. It just tasted like sugar water with alcohol in it.

874782468317921284 2017-06-13 00:16:07 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> It's also possible they could be just as destructive but just not as much destruction because most buildings here are solid concrete.
874782183528865792 2017-06-13 00:14:59 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Typhoons in Hong Kong aren't as destructive as hurricanes in Gulf of Mexico. But boy is it miserable walking around when it rains sideways

873832352979529728 2017-06-11 09:20:42 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I suffered the wrath of the Turkish ice cream man
873832352706899968 2017-06-11 09:20:42 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I thought I had explored the whole airport. Turns out there was an even LONGER hallway. Guess whose flight was at the other end 
873558392387891201 2017-06-10 15:12:05 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> This airport is ENORMOUS. For a few minutes, I thought I had somehow left the airport and walked into a mall
873553617894207488 2017-06-10 14:53:07 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I was wrong about there being no infants. There were four on that flight. One couldn't sleep meaning FOUR couldn't sleep.

873322598905544704 2017-06-09 23:35:07 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Yirggzmb True, walking through the airport isn't the best. But when you're on the plane, it's nice to not be constricted as much as possible.

872454739937681409 2017-06-07 14:06:34 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 @Graphoniac Trouble is that costs a 3% fee on both cards. I think (for me) it may be cheaper to just use cash for the majority of the trip.
872446115207159809 2017-06-07 13:32:17 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I was gonna say the one thing the internet agrees on is that the airport usually had higher fees but doesn't give clear alternatives.
872445473721913345 2017-06-07 13:29:44 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Any suggestions on where to exchange US dollars for foreign currency? And whether I should do it here or there? The internet can't agree
872409195353657344 2017-06-07 11:05:35 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> "i had a really good morning! you deserve a really good morning! kill anyone who says you dont and build a throne from their bones!"  Okay

871781527415173120 2017-06-05 17:31:27 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac My mom is definitely a #WonderWomanIRL. Like Scott Pilgrim, she fights with the power of self respect. 
871610098639970304 2017-06-04 06:10:15 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Went to bed @ 9:30, woke up @ 11:30. Accidentally stayed up until 12:30 @ which point I was worried I wouldn't wake in time. So now I'm up.

871516902371188736 2017-06-04 23:59:56 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So apparently in an early story board for one of Gravity Falls' final episodes, Dipper was gonna break Dippy Fresh's neck

871408917183463425 2017-06-04 16:50:50 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> If there's anything better than a game about sentient corn, it's one that had a DDR portion at the end

871162223690792960 2017-06-03 00:30:34 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Forget "in years." Thinking more about it, Wonder woman is my favorite super hero movie ever. I suggest EVERYONE go see it!https://twitter.com/Raikon_Chemlyk/status/871094510054326272

865639426633814018 2017-05-19 18:44:56 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Apparently "those days" include my first opportunity for overtime in months
865554214973349889 2017-05-19 13:06:20 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Just a friendly reminder that today is gonna be one of those days. You know. one of THOSE days. You know the days.

865266932039208960 2017-05-18 18:04:47 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Black lightning is getting a show which APPARENTLY means we probably won't see a static shock reboot. And so begins the revolt.

864498462620086273 2017-05-16 15:11:09 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Reminds me of a Donald glover quote where he refers to all children as "tiny hitlers."
864497023202054144 2017-05-16 15:05:26 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset Depends on whether the conversation is about stories I enjoyed or gameplay.
864351821048954880 2017-05-15 05:28:27 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So now I'm adding "Write a soap opera script" to my already over-ambitious to do list
864328090838859776 2017-05-15 03:54:09 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> You know Dav and X are both in chat when Aya says "Oh you guys are talking about plane stuff"

864270795509575680 2017-05-15 00:06:29 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 My App was on one of your tweets. So when I went to tweet, it would've been a reply to you.
864268457965215744 2017-05-15 23:57:12 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I almost tweeted at you with something totally unrelated to your tweet again
864268366764269570 2017-05-15 23:56:50 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Oh god, I only brought it up to 3,500 steps today and I'm dying. I gotta get my life under control XD
864227437139435522 2017-05-15 21:14:12 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> How can one person who is so smart miss the point of 5 facebook posts in a row. Also is it still subtweeting if they don't have twitter?
864158088739377152 2017-05-15 16:38:38 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> That Kate Spade ad is BS. Absolutely nobody is happy about a mariachi band on public transit.
864140323936755713 2017-05-15 15:28:02 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Oh and DID I mention I'm going to the Fifth Element Fathom Event on Wednesday?
864137191714369536 2017-05-15 15:15:36 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Although, to be fair, I tried joining a running group of people from highschool but no one has said anything about it in weeks
864131244350738433 2017-05-15 14:51:58 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I used to get about 20,000 steps every day, but since I started sit down jobs, I've been lucky to get 900. This MIGHT be a problem.
864119588254089216 2017-05-15 14:05:39 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 It's trending because of John Oliver last night

863769006888677376 2017-05-14 14:52:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 No, separately
863768887288094720 2017-05-14 14:52:05 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Does it have to install or anything? The "install game" option was there but I never saw anything happen  I'd hate to miss the chance

863592667627835392 2017-05-13 03:11:51 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Until the aliens come. I think it's only fair that we are fully honest with them.

863125688391528448 2017-05-12 20:16:14 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset "Martial hearts" or whatever the crap it was that you suggested years ago
862846420096868352 2017-05-11 01:46:32 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac I will keep these in mind though 
862846287623970816 2017-05-11 01:46:00 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac The trouble is that gpa can take away your eligibility for financial aid, so it is a small worry

860687238480396288 2017-05-05 02:46:43 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Why would you make a game that rewards the player for exploration, then make a character that yells at them if they leave the beaten path?!
860655818391379968 2017-05-05 00:41:51 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> A suggestion to video game developers: if you're going to make an annoying character with dialog, please give them their own volume setting.

857959652453216260 2017-04-28 14:08:15 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I admire the man who took a cigar INTO the hypersleep pod just so he could light it up as soon as he woke up. Man has his priorities.
857949172074467329 2017-04-28 13:26:37 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> 2009-2012 was the meme renaissance. They may never be the same again.
857949018978209793 2017-04-28 13:26:00 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I hate seeing news outlets reporting on memes. Memes were better when they happened naturally, not when they were reported to the masses (c)
857800790836117504 2017-04-27 03:37:00 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Tomorrow is probably gonna be another slow day for work... I bet I could get away with watching the remaining three alien movies.
857791777960603648 2017-04-27 03:01:11 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I finally finished it and Oh my gosh yes Ripley.
857777791412129792 2017-04-27 02:05:36 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @MomofMiners Yep, that's the one pic.twitter.com/I8QIr9nOCy
857776720694456320 2017-04-27 02:01:21 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I honestly can't believe I've managed to go my whole life and I didn't hear many spoilers about one of the most famous sci-fi films ever.
857735293717417984 2017-04-27 23:16:44 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Weddings are red Lannisters aren't nice People that mess with you Will pay the iron price
857719012196839424 2017-04-27 22:12:02 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Agreed! And with the camera work and the script, I feel like they were so ahead of their time
857718803874140161 2017-04-27 22:11:13 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Honestly, even the original star wars loses me sometimes.
857718544800370688 2017-04-27 22:10:11 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I have heard people say Alien didn't age well. I have to strongly, STRONGLY disagree. I've never felt so enthralled in a movie from the 70's
857693558769430533 2017-04-27 20:30:54 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I realize I'm 38 years late on this one. But face huggers are disgusting.
857689666551771137 2017-04-27 20:15:26 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Alien: cat aboard the ship, huge success. Cowboy Bebop: dog aboard the ship, hug success. More pets in space would lead to more successes
857681216958541824 2017-04-27 19:41:51 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I've got two hours left at work and not much work left. Maybe it's finally time to watch Alien
857615774579662848 2017-04-27 15:21:49 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Today is Thank You Thursday. Thank you, all of you, because even the smallest impact on my life has still made me who I am 
857404653297971200 2017-04-26 01:22:53 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Apparently in today's society it's just cool for Chinese takeout to not bring chopsticks. I don't know what's what in this world anymore
857388972351291392 2017-04-26 00:20:35 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I've never seen a chinese restaurant with online ordering. I'm so excited I didn't have to actually call a restaurant
857367384520306689 2017-04-26 22:54:48 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Yirggzmb Yeah I figured out how to phrase the Google almost immediately after tweeting  it's based on the airline
857366626362155008 2017-04-26 22:51:47 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Question for pilots and frequent flyers. How do you determine the drinking age on an international flight?
857005750807384064 2017-04-25 22:57:48 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I'm aware this autocorrected  from toto, I'm in too deep to change it now
857005342164738050 2017-04-25 22:56:10 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> "This thing happens as sure as a mountain stands still just like this other Mountain but in a different location."
857005172068950017 2017-04-25 22:55:30 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Whoever wrote the "kilamanjaro" line in Tori's Africa was a genius.
857002499596853249 2017-04-25 22:44:52 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @MaxAmpere_ @MomofMiners Woo! I can put that on my CV, thanks twitter XD
856994615932661762 2017-04-25 22:13:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> WHOOAOAOAOAO Guess which nerd got accepted into an University.
856989701915516933 2017-04-25 21:54:01 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> School things have come up which means no stream for me tonight. But luckily I'll be more boat learned when I DO stream now!
856984585950838784 2017-04-25 21:33:41 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac is this another bear/bird- I mean lizard/bat stream??
856982292807520257 2017-04-25 21:24:35 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> It's super reassuring when every section of a game's tutorial includes "we hope this makes sense!"
856979063554101248 2017-04-25 21:11:45 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Just looking at this sailing simulator right now... I don't know if I can promise I won't crash on my stream tonight >.>
856971504189353986 2017-04-25 20:41:43 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Okay yes definitely. at 9PM Central time tonight, I'm gonna be on a BOAT stream! but I will be learning how to drive it so please be kind
856969083174219782 2017-04-25 20:32:05 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Even though I don't believe in the A.I. takeover, sometimes I wake up Siri just to tell her to shut up. Just in case she's getting any ideas
856968240597278720 2017-04-25 20:28:44 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> THEY KNOW TOO MUCHpic.twitter.com/7RQzCCJ7mp
856915699926790146 2017-04-25 16:59:58 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Oh but speaking of legendary memes, there's probably gonna be a raikon stream tonight 
856914828803420160 2017-04-25 16:56:30 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Meanwhile, it was just a stupid meme.
856914707600551936 2017-04-25 16:56:01 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Future historians are going to think 2008-2012 held tournaments for some great worldwide sport so legendary it was only known as "The game."
856652425935114240 2017-04-24 23:33:48 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> There's a guy here on campus watching a pirated version of Baby Boss... who took the time to pirate that movie in the first place?!?!
856515028081573890 2017-04-24 14:27:50 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> When your boss thinks it's funny to joke about firing some of the team members, just to get a responsepic.twitter.com/ZrHBttpLdD

856303953117630464 2017-04-23 00:29:06 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> update: the book doesn't have a very high standard for what counts as a joke.
856302490345762817 2017-04-23 00:23:17 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I won't lie, I'm excited to get to that one, but a man has his priorities.

856241593128452098 2017-04-23 20:21:18 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac could be the sensation of being socially trapped. Once a card/boardgame is started, if you want to quit, you don't want to be THAT person
855981828246786048 2017-04-22 03:09:05 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I have said so many times the Doctor Who needs to end. This season has completely changed my mind.

855854688650092544 2017-04-22 18:43:53 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Sometimes I look at diet drinks (to which I am allergic) and think "just one bottle and I have an excuse for the day"
855602906896244737 2017-04-21 02:03:23 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> There is way too much cake research going on right now
855599093334380544 2017-04-21 01:48:14 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Why even buy fun smell-good candles if they're just gonna smell like burning?
855576601098113025 2017-04-21 00:18:52 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I just referred to William Shatner as Patrick Warburton. If anyone needs me, I'll be applying for a new nerd card.

854860549355700224 2017-04-19 00:53:32 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I'm actually arguing whether or not the doctor would win the game of thrones  spoiler alert: he wouldn't.

854854049405050880 2017-04-19 00:27:42 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I think it's probably time I actually WATCH the Alien movies
854817151429070849 2017-04-19 22:01:05 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Do you ever see a character design and you just think to yourself "Wow, I bet their three-dimensional personality is REALLY developed."
854724741210537985 2017-04-19 15:53:52 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Me: "don't buy new books, you have one you have to read over the next 4 days."  Also me: "Eldritch horror?! Sold!"
854437590413561856 2017-04-18 20:52:50 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @xcentrik4 @Davkas2005 I think we all have the one bit of office supplies on our desk that we're particularly possessive of too. The stapler is in all of us.

854372798382436352 2017-04-18 16:35:23 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset Interesting... it makes me wonder how many Netflix shows are actually original concepts.
854372337369657345 2017-04-18 16:33:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset If I'm honest, it was a serious question cleverly disguised as could-be sarcasm just in case it was a dumb question.
854371558323879937 2017-04-18 16:30:27 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset You mean they didn't come up with "seven deadly sins" or the K anime?  
854302770505142272 2017-04-18 11:57:07 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I feel like Netflix should just call them "Netflix Productions", cause MST3K isn't REALLY a Netflix original, is it?

854109488617590784 2017-04-17 23:09:05 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Part of me is proud that the kids in my neighborhood are pretending to be comic book characters.

854078416819294209 2017-04-17 21:05:37 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 If I'm being honest, I'm doing a lot better than in the past. Having to save up for a huge trip that's on my dime has certainly helped.
854077983941963777 2017-04-17 21:03:54 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Wow not only did I sign up for a free trial and forget to cancel before they charged me... I did it with three different services at once XD
854073041806135297 2017-04-17 20:44:15 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> The term mailman is kinda redundant
853770237669462016 2017-04-16 00:41:01 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 That's fair. I'm honestly indifferent, it's just a sound effect and the gameplay is still awesome.
853767739445477377 2017-04-16 00:31:05 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> People are actually hating on a really good game just because a single voice actor was removed from the cast.

851983669279547392 2017-04-11 02:21:50 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac I didn't get to play Banjo-Kazooie as much during my childhood, but this definitely still feels nostalgic af.
851907781724602368 2017-04-11 21:20:17 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I sure am glad I got the Xbox controller.  Because it turns out you CANT change the control scheme in the final game. Thanks @Davkas2005
851904929589604353 2017-04-11 21:08:57 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> On second thought, no. This reaction just creates MORE housework.https://twitter.com/raikon_chemlyk/status/851904093593509889

851829894610812929 2017-04-11 16:10:47 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 @Graphoniac There is, however, no honor among brothers. I'm playing as soon as I get home.

839597945917964289 2017-03-08 22:05:23 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Interviewee- "I get most of the contract, but what's the CH2O clause?"  Interviewer- "Oh don't worry that's just a formaldehyde."
839545287198781441 2017-03-08 18:36:09 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Me- "okay I really need to focus on work"  Brain- "SAX MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN"
839485639187922944 2017-03-08 14:39:07 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I'm growing out my bears. This joke born of a type is one of the best things I've ever donepic.twitter.com/2t05jR0DPm

839270507543408640 2017-03-07 00:24:16 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> How am I already getting instructions for the final project? We haven't even taken our midterm yet!
839269654933737477 2017-03-07 00:20:53 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Spunkeydoodle that sounds like actual magic and I'm worlds of jealous

838957949603221504 2017-03-06 03:42:16 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Raikon_Chemlyk totally just remembered I promised someone a skype call tomorrow because I have a horrible memory. So this will be thursday!
838956272481406977 2017-03-06 03:35:37 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Tomorrow (Tuesday) at 9PM CST, I'm doing a stream, but I can't decide what I should stream!
838934399236308993 2017-03-06 02:08:42 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> "In America, we put out amazing statesmen. Jefferson, Washington. Even today, what's the best thing we've got? That's right! Basketball!"

838573827705737216 2017-03-05 02:15:55 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Sometimes only you know what's really best for you. If you're in a bad situation and you're waiting for someone to tell you to get out, go.
838573576290725890 2017-03-05 02:14:55 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Just a daily reminder that realizing that you would do something with someone else's validation is all the validation you need.
838535398481625089 2017-03-05 23:43:12 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Had no idea the remastered versions of bioshock were so glitchy. Game crashed on me three times whilst trying to record >.<

838186098295713792 2017-03-04 00:35:13 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I actually have to take back every bad thing I said about the Great Wall movie.
838104372177420288 2017-03-04 19:10:28 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I absolutely cannot believe @TheNerdCloset went quietly on that one XD
838094155016454144 2017-03-04 18:29:52 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Yirggzmb now everybody plays modded sticks and it's not the same
838093857883578373 2017-03-04 18:28:41 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> You know those moments when you think "I'm gonna find a mesa!" and then thirty minutes later you're 6000 blocks from spawn XD
838093445956780032 2017-03-04 18:27:03 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Yirggzmb it all boils back to Bertie the brain.
838084323903418368 2017-03-04 17:50:48 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @jimi_jt had a discussion with me about FloorCon rules. Then I turned around and broke decorative grass out of habit pic.twitter.com/yJ9BTSSDw9

837888889092177920 2017-03-03 04:54:13 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 @Tyranostradamus @Graphoniac I hadn't completed my "dammit raikon" quota for the day. I have metrics to meet.
837887110728269824 2017-03-03 04:47:09 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 @Tyranostradamus so would you say it has... broadened your horizons?
837859950294667265 2017-03-03 02:59:13 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I bought a drawing tablet and kept it sitting in the box because the inspiration disappeared as soon as it arrived. Tonight things happen.
837858462524661761 2017-03-03 02:53:18 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I know Pirates of the Caribbean has gone on way too long as it is, but seeing "the final adventure" written in the trailer is still sad

837497183104561152 2017-03-02 02:57:43 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @xcentrik4 oh okay, so does each family have their own ship choices as well??
837496038944620544 2017-03-02 02:53:10 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Around and get to know the universe on your own before blindly choosing a race and bloodline
837495929905246208 2017-03-02 02:52:44 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So Eve already has the concept of "transferring your consciousness into a clone" from the starting cinematic. It'd be cool if you could walk
837455976835993600 2017-03-02 00:13:58 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I got so caught up building the desk I totally forgot I have class in 15 minutes  #whoops
837443760040644608 2017-03-02 23:25:26 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Apparently I don't know how to properly build a desk, I keep putting everything on backwards.

837363503954550787 2017-03-02 18:06:31 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> It can be so frustrating that there's so much waiting involved in "going out and doing something with your life"

837320754991620101 2017-03-02 15:16:39 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I don't know if 1976 counts as traditional. If so, Hendrix counts as traditional American folk songs now.

836967490399924224 2017-03-01 15:52:54 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @xcentrik4 that being said, are you only able to get glasses from the doctor's office itself? Surely there are better selections elsewhere
836967093643919361 2017-03-01 15:51:19 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @xcentrik4 "ugh hipster? That's SO mainstream. I prefer the lesser known, underground sub genre of neo-hippy. You've probably never heard-"

836934814301319169 2017-03-01 13:43:03 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> The instructions for if I set off the office alarm actually advise me to try not to get shot by a cop until I can call someone else first XD

833635516876779520 2017-02-20 11:12:50 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Hoo boy, up at 5AM for the first time in a long time. This new sleep schedule is going to be a brutal adjustment.
833041410114912257 2017-02-18 19:52:03 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 he's also done liquid cooling before and I don't know how complicated this pre-built setup will be. But yeah! I'm excited :D
833040688904278016 2017-02-18 19:49:12 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 No, a former co worker is going to help me build it next weekend. He's also got cable management and Windows 10, so I'm waiting.

832728531113242624 2017-02-17 23:08:47 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> "Put the romance back in necromancy" is my new favorite phrase, I've been saying it randomly for days.
832721273130205184 2017-02-17 22:39:57 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @BrendanDRenders thanks Brendan! I hope you have a good day as well

832328420038209537 2017-02-16 20:38:53 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Yirggzmb I mean witches, zombies, and exploding green monsters are within the realm of possibilities but maybe you're right, maybe
832325063361835009 2017-02-16 20:25:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Does @Mojang actually have a reason for why nether rack doesn't work for infinite furnace fuel?
832315216096587776 2017-02-16 19:46:25 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Raikon_Chemlyk it's a shame too, I tried to coordinate everything to be blue and white but I couldn't find a solid state drive I liked.

825129319911546880 2017-01-27 23:52:14 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Is there anyone at #PAXsouth from Houston who wants to discuss collaboration for small YouTube channels?

825036246783246336 2017-01-27 17:42:24 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Holy cow there's a lot of cops on the route to PAX.
825021910375358465 2017-01-27 16:45:26 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I just passed a guy on the freeway pulling a grill out of his truck. Looks like folks are tailgating the traffic

824855875525308416 2017-01-26 05:45:40 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 unfortunately so far I'm on S2E7, doesn't look good for me finishing the show by tomorrow morning
824815092021735426 2017-01-26 03:03:36 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I wasn't expecting to find the voices of john Oliver, nick offerman, and Patton Oswald in Gravity Falls. Its almost disconcerting.
824801747864518656 2017-01-26 02:10:35 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Now the question is can I watch the entire second season of gravity falls tonight?
824794776562180098 2017-01-26 01:42:53 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Last class done! Just gotta pack and I'll be heading for PAX in the morning!

824729690111873025 2017-01-26 21:24:15 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I just wanted to find a single Gravity Falls scene on YouTube and now I'm in some shipping parallel universe.
824699144690405376 2017-01-26 19:22:52 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Good lord, I only THOUGHT Gravity Falls was dark until I saw Gideon's mom.
824686024458641409 2017-01-26 18:30:44 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> How old is Soos supposed to be? I'm so unclear
824658388281884672 2017-01-26 16:40:55 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Because 90's WWE references are what I'm looking for in my Disney shows
824490183567507456 2017-01-25 05:32:32 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I'm not going to lie, the wax figures in gravity falls are way too creepy.
824488538599202816 2017-01-25 05:26:00 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I got one more day of class then imma be joining y'all in San Antonio this weekend! #PAXsouth2017

823325575041388545 2017-01-22 00:24:48 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> The writer of the Godzilla comic is silly. Why would you say "on three" then count down from three?
822923538315313152 2017-01-21 21:47:15 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I hope these protests finally get the message across. I hope today finally proves solidarity.

822568369492815873 2017-01-20 22:15:56 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> There is way too much going on with this Yugioh phone game. The amount of stuff is just overwhelming
822527479856431104 2017-01-20 19:33:27 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I have this foreboding feeling that the cats aren't going to let the house stay clean until @Davkas2005 and @TheNerdCloset get here
822510499308982273 2017-01-20 18:25:59 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 And I didn't wait until almost the last day to start cleaning house

822350110495477760 2017-01-19 07:48:39 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I thought I was finally going to persevere through this show but then I got distracted by unread comics and unfinished games.

822165056397905921 2017-01-19 19:33:19 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Why do science comics insist on "reverse the polarity"? what does that even mean?? What does that have to do with Godzilla????

821883059356180481 2017-01-18 00:52:45 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Raikon_Chemlyk you'd think they would trust us by now to know that hot glass looks like cold glass.
821882971183546370 2017-01-18 00:52:24 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> It astounds me that after doing safety quizzes in every science class since middle school we still have to do them in college.

821570584052199424 2017-01-17 04:11:05 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Professor said we were using the 3rd edition because it was cheaper. google search proves it's the most expensive.pic.twitter.com/bA9Q9apyhJ

819968032420331520 2017-01-13 18:03:07 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> It's my last day at this job and we are the busiest we have been in months >.>

819681522731089921 2017-01-12 23:04:38 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Humans are 65% water. Cats are 67% water. Conclusion: I'm 44% Cat.
819661252574281728 2017-01-12 21:44:05 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I've always heard coding stories. Now I myself have experienced doing the same thing a million times and not understanding why it works now.
819652017035628544 2017-01-12 21:07:23 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 codecademy has a built in code editor. Lets you work on projects and see how they come out in the browser in real time.
819650698652614656 2017-01-12 21:02:09 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 And I'm using an in-browser platform that saves basically every time I make a keystroke.
819650598282862596 2017-01-12 21:01:45 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I'm pretty sure. I got the link directly from W3, and put it before my js script element.
819650166445711360 2017-01-12 21:00:02 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I'm using the link for the google CDN. W3 said it would load faster.
819649579239018500 2017-01-12 20:57:42 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Okay I'm confused now. Every forum I've read says my code should allow me to use jQuery but my jQuery doesn't work.
819649263676325891 2017-01-12 20:56:27 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @xcentrik4 @TheNerdCloset you know, ceiling space is the least utilized part of a household.
819580176770236416 2017-01-12 16:21:55 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Seriously, I feel like I have all this information now and the best thing I can come up with to start is basically a text doc about code.
819574786565218305 2017-01-12 16:00:30 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Okay so I have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. I haven't the slightest idea where to even begin.
819550813014130689 2017-01-12 14:25:14 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Watch all five, they're only about 2-3 minutes each. You will regret it. I do. https://youtu.be/5Bt66S75EWo via @YouTube
819397547802394626 2017-01-11 04:16:13 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Yirggzmb @BlockSamurai also which stream platform do you use for yours??
819397456739893248 2017-01-11 04:15:52 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Yirggzmb @BlockSamurai Okay cool! I might try this then to get the ball rolling on my story again! Thanks! :)
819395474163699712 2017-01-11 04:07:59 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> not sure if anyone would find it fun or interesting, but I'm considering trying it, cause I'm stuck with ideas.
819395318576017408 2017-01-11 04:07:22 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I've seen lots of different types of streams but has anyone tried doing writing streams? Like, talking their writing ideas out? With people?
819366045647572994 2017-01-11 02:11:03 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So I have a story I want to tell but writing a book has always felt disingenuous. I want to try different ways of telling it through YT.

819286856588259328 2017-01-11 20:56:22 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 is Java more complicated than JS?
819286591394971648 2017-01-11 20:55:19 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 lol I was implementing javascript for a joke :P
819286253275324418 2017-01-11 20:53:59 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Java = Javascript According to your languages rules, now it does.
819284692520288265 2017-01-11 20:47:46 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I understand what's going on with it, but Java makes my brain hurt.
819215240193777664 2017-01-11 16:11:48 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Finished HTML and CSS, now on to JavaScript!

818893144347602945 2017-01-10 18:51:54 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Yeah, but I'm glad to know ahead of time instead of having it sprung on my friday night like they usually do.
818889957112770563 2017-01-10 18:39:14 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Was just alerted that I may be let go this week. So I suppose it's time to update my resume.
818881816396464128 2017-01-10 18:06:53 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset @dot83 I bought a year calendar and every day I exercise, I mark the day off. It's proven to be rewarding to see days marked.
818880203833348098 2017-01-10 18:00:29 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset @dot83 Same, though I'm trying to gain weight but I would prefer not to gain it in fat :P
818865399085367299 2017-01-10 17:01:39 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> This course I found teaches HTML and CSS in the same course. There was so much out there to learn, I just never knew where to look!
818831859538796544 2017-01-10 14:48:23 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @LadyMpire I'll check them out, thanks! :)
818831300014575618 2017-01-10 14:46:09 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @LadyMpire me too! I love the taste of diet drinks, but I'm allergic to the aspartame 
818830631404703745 2017-01-10 14:43:30 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @dot83 I'm glad I'm not the only one then! I simply realized my diet was WAY too much sodium and I can't afford to cut ramen out :P
818829643528761345 2017-01-10 14:39:34 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Due to cutbacks in my diet, this is going to be my last doctor pepper for a long timepic.twitter.com/CyTy1apTIb
818794132525162497 2017-01-10 12:18:28 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Dear college, Skinny jeans used to be so easy to put on, why are you doing this to me?
818618273361227776 2017-01-09 00:39:40 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Second week of "don't break the chain" and I'm starting to lose steam but trying to motivate myself to keep going with these life changes.
818589808230592518 2017-01-09 22:46:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @BrendanDRenders @TheNerdCloset can I guess prompto or newt scamander?
818588384511885312 2017-01-09 22:40:54 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @nite97m I'm offended that you would even suggest that this isn't true #triggered

817516932488458240 2017-01-06 23:43:20 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Spunkeydoodle XD I legit knew a kid in high school who brought a marshmallow puff/Nutella sandwich to school every day.

817503496903790594 2017-01-06 22:49:56 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I'm so instinctively determined to be the nicest person. I said "have a good night," she said "you too!" To which I ALSO said "you too!"
817490219477925888 2017-01-06 21:57:11 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Tavinnea This speaks to me oh so well. I know you'll get there! :D
817479333249957888 2017-01-06 21:13:55 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Tavinnea @torgosaves I think that happened earlier when they got married and then immediately divorced.

817037356079476736 2017-01-05 15:57:40 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 it's all miscommunication and certain people not remembering things that happened right before the Christmas break.

816878376526999553 2017-01-04 05:25:56 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I really hope AMD showed up with this one. I don't want to spend $300 on intel if I can spend $500 on AMD and get so much more.https://twitter.com/amdryzen/status/816857322655887362
816877551058493440 2017-01-04 05:22:39 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheDinocow I wish they would do real benchmarks with it though. Highlighting fixes for issues from bulldozer, not how it outperforms intel.

810338935339712512 2016-12-17 04:20:32 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I participated in so much screaming at the show, I'm holding the funeral for my throats and vocal cords on Thursday.
810295305858121732 2016-12-17 01:27:10 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Also they've got the Spanish version of "hotel California" playing before the show?
810290071588995073 2016-12-17 01:06:22 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> "Of course I don't know my limits, I'm drunk when I reach them" -overheard at #gamegrumpslive

810241289040068608 2016-12-17 21:52:31 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> This will be my first trip to downtown Houston without anyone to direct me where to park. #adulting
810171590352769024 2016-12-17 17:15:34 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Now that FFXV is out, can we get Kingdom Hearts 3? I need to be told to follow my dreams/heart.
809886974404218880 2016-12-16 22:24:36 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Spunkeydoodle perhaps more accurately, a sputter spife
809886665422635008 2016-12-16 22:23:22 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Spunkeydoodle forget the spork. That there is a spife.
809875429926588417 2016-12-16 21:38:43 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @GameGrumps I did it, I bought a ticket to the @gamegrumps show in Houston tomorrow night
809784437856727041 2016-12-16 15:37:09 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset let me know if you find any extra mimikyu because I still haven't found any!
809783837324673024 2016-12-16 15:34:46 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 @TheNerdCloset just looked up terminology. Lycanroc's midnight form is only available in moon.
809782107509850112 2016-12-16 15:27:54 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 @TheNerdCloset rockruff's evolution is a bigger dog or a werewolf depending on which game you got
809781311275667456 2016-12-16 15:24:44 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 @TheNerdCloset ohh okay that's fair enough. And the only reason they did that is for the werewolf, isn't it?

809536777253949440 2016-12-15 23:13:02 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @TheNerdCloset no way!! I still haven't gotten there yet, I'm itching for it!
809529749882150912 2016-12-15 22:45:07 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Just got this in the mail. By the power of grey skull, we WILL record sega genesis footage.https://twitter.com/cats_of_pop/status/809529535008047104
809186973294493696 2016-12-14 00:03:03 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I just want to say I didn't realize battletoads actually existed and I'm so excited I know where to get a copy now
808723456019886081 2016-12-13 17:21:11 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Any suggestions for affordable/reliable motherboard brands?
808520447428096000 2016-12-12 03:54:30 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Just finished the unfinished swan for the second time in 24 hours. But I got all the balloons this time! So now I've got that going for me
807688247035957249 2016-12-10 20:47:38 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I want a robot movie where instead of saying "my programming prohibits" they say "my mind is telling me no" #LowkeyRKellyReferences
807676392896860160 2016-12-10 20:00:32 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Basically trying to make the argument that there will come a point when AI will be considered lifeforms.
807676262470877185 2016-12-10 20:00:01 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Paper is coming together really well. Discussing how robot's ability to want, adapt, and feel, isn't really all that different from mankind.
807398610807771141 2016-12-09 01:36:44 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 had to find the course description. No language, just concepts of structure. Data types, arrays, control structures, etc.
807386114193588225 2016-12-09 00:47:04 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 programming fundamentals 1 :-P
807384472849096706 2016-12-09 00:40:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Yirggzmb thanks!! I really WANT to do computers, I'm just not sure if it will come as easy to me as it does a certain brother of mine :-P
807384282348011520 2016-12-09 00:39:48 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 fair enough, I'll see what pandora does with itpic.twitter.com/9PPjjoYxs2
807383684689121280 2016-12-09 00:37:25 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I do use pandora
807382712826871808 2016-12-09 00:33:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 awesome, it's greatly appreciated :-) writing a philosophy paper on androids and I need something to set my tone.
807382251017269248 2016-12-09 00:31:43 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I'm finally taking my first actual programming class next semester. This will be the real test to see if I'm cut out for this stuff.
807380697044414464 2016-12-09 00:25:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Any suggestions for background techno music?
807026523035336704 2016-12-08 00:58:11 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Do you ever worry you're gonna laugh to hard and accidentally swallow your tongue? No? Yeah me neither ha ha ha
807006302996197377 2016-12-08 23:37:50 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Paper due Sunday. Normally I'd do it Saturday, but the topic is interesting so I'll do it Friday.
805642344842350592 2016-12-04 05:17:57 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Holy crap! I forgot about this!https://twitter.com/davkas2005/status/805642020408553472
805588615363461120 2016-12-04 01:44:27 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Second time seeing Dr. Strange I notice a problem, but people are just going to dismiss it with "shhhh it's magic" so whatever :-P
804869481336098816 2016-12-02 02:06:52 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 out set up with the el Gato works fine. It's something about the sega going into something before going into the monitor.
804869331796561920 2016-12-02 02:06:17 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I can play the sega on a tv fine. But plugging it into the El Gato or anything doesn't work. But we tested the el Gato and
804868176332853249 2016-12-02 02:01:41 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Plot twist: it was the sega all along.
804861989319221248 2016-12-02 01:37:06 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Trying out an El Gato on the sega. It might be the sega and not the capture device.
803335028042321920 2016-11-28 20:29:30 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Graphoniac @Yirggzmb my friend's roommates had a little plastic fetus that they hid in the dorms and waited for it to be found.

803001695525621760 2016-11-27 22:24:57 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Hmmm... I was thinking about getting some Doritos, but I guess I'm just too lays-y.
802551997148917760 2016-11-26 16:38:01 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So we didn't want to lose the progress we made in those 14 episodes and we're uploading them over the next two weeks. They're cringe worthy.
802029434563739648 2016-11-24 06:01:32 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 floof  Happy thanksgiving by the way! It's midnight where I am but technically I'm not too late in Arizona :-P
801847208022802432 2016-11-24 17:57:26 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 but they've never been so blatant as to use so much of a real world language before Kalos, right?
801844575165906944 2016-11-24 17:46:58 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Pokmon doesn't know when to stop stressing how unbelievably FRENCH the Kalos region was
801674888704589824 2016-11-23 06:32:42 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Another thing super rad about the new Pokmon game is the pok-ber. No more transportation moves or "cut/strength".
801623996785692673 2016-11-23 03:10:28 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Things that frustrate me about the new Pokmon. 1.-1000 "Vullaby called for help."
801623842498158592 2016-11-23 03:09:52 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> 3. The talking pokedex is interesting. It makes me wonder if the Pokmon itself talks? Or if the new pokedex is translating.
801623842489827333 2016-11-23 03:09:52 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> 2. Pokmon refresh heals status effects and also ups their affection for you which has bonuses in battle. Also it's cute.
801623471751131136 2016-11-23 03:08:23 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Things I enjoy about the new Pokmon 1. The new "trials" motif rather than the old style of gyms and gym leaders

800765096733605888 2016-11-21 18:17:31 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @dot83 @Oviraptor_ the German language uses the letter Z a lot more than English does, I believe.

800501610153656320 2016-11-20 00:50:31 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I may have eaten way too many skittles today. I regret nothing.
799797988902273024 2016-11-18 02:14:34 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> You can't tell me #PokemonSunMoon  is for kids and then make the new professor an attractive man. This is confusing and uncalled for.
799768856101351424 2016-11-18 00:18:48 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I'll get myself a plastic light up bracelet if I want! They can't stop me from accessorizing with my light up sketchers!
799766674228576256 2016-11-18 00:10:08 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> The advertising in the new Pokmon game. What are they? Nine? I've never felt so attacked by Nintendo in my life.pic.twitter.com/Qe3Dii0Mzs

798292685383749632 2016-11-14 22:33:02 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Sometimes I forget who I'm talking to and what is considered appropriate. I just used a ton of emojis in an email to my apartment manager.

797898903605514240 2016-11-13 20:28:17 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Yirggzmb it randomly hits me that I have daily conversations with a girl in Hong Kong. Communication today is incredible.
797892754307170304 2016-11-13 20:03:51 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 yeah! I've been learning to knit. Admittedly I started this scarf in March.
797887142966005761 2016-11-13 19:41:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> This is a PSA that scarves feel so much cooler when you make them yourself.pic.twitter.com/mavIhvgwAX

797234759839662080 2016-11-11 00:29:13 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Oh what? So it's NOT my goal to destroy everyone in my path in Dishonored?
797228949269082114 2016-11-11 00:06:07 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Oh good and the rats bite too, that's fantastic.
797228411857096704 2016-11-11 00:03:59 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> No sure Dishonored, watching rats DEVOUR two dudes is absolutely delightful, thanks for that 
797223733467500544 2016-11-11 23:45:24 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I actually really enjoy editing videos so much. Is there a way to get paid to do it?
797170920582447104 2016-11-11 20:15:32 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 yeah, full time contractor :-) so full time but it could end any day now.

797169339258589185 2016-11-11 20:09:15 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 not really. I mean, is there a reason for alerting guards of your presence in Dishonored? :P
797168169425190912 2016-11-11 20:04:36 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 lol, I'm waiting for my special cable to come in so I can hook my sega up to my monitor at work.
797104442088837120 2016-11-11 15:51:23 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Because there is only so much joy that the Internet can bring on a daily basis.

796486666584203265 2016-11-09 22:56:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 is voter turnout not strictly the voters who have shown up to vote?
796482708549627905 2016-11-09 22:40:50 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Since stating Im running for pres. in 2032: 1 person won't vote for me, 2 people will. I've got 2/3 of the voter turnout so far.

795852454575349760 2016-11-07 04:56:26 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 a little bit of column A, a little bit of column B. I really want to start with the advent of video games, and work from there.
795851825756983296 2016-11-07 04:53:56 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 yeah, I want to make a video (or possibly series) exploring the earlier consoles for the younger gen (like myself)
795851588892053506 2016-11-07 04:52:59 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Not just that, but I also think it's a video people will enjoy. It's gonna take months though, so nobody hold their breath.
795851417579831298 2016-11-07 04:52:18 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I've been wanting to establish a presence on the internet for sometime and I think I finally have a video idea that will help.
795412088428646400 2016-11-06 23:46:34 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I am armed and about to go round 2 with the "maybe brown recluse"pic.twitter.com/A4WRuY83sn
794283345458798592 2016-11-03 21:01:21 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Does anyone know anything about capturing in adobe premiere CC?
794152589239652353 2016-11-03 12:21:46 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I wasn't gonna say anything but turns out it's a garden spider and he likes it in the closet and the cats are letting him.
794133700418019328 2016-11-03 11:06:43 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Cat and spider have now entered the closet. We shall see who returns alive.
794133466644287489 2016-11-03 11:05:47 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Yes yes yes!! Get the spider shadow! Yessss defend me, I will swear an eternal oath to you!!
794132852656848896 2016-11-03 11:03:21 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Plot twist: one cat just wants to be pet, the other wants in the closet, neither has any interest in my predicament
794132484757725185 2016-11-03 11:01:53 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Both cars are in my room, I've got #backup
794132164627427328 2016-11-03 11:00:36 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> One of the cats is in my room now. Trying to point it towards the spider
794132031923843072 2016-11-03 11:00:05 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> There's a brown recluse in my bedroom, I genuinely don't know what to do, I am in FULL panic mode right now
793299915212410880 2016-10-31 03:53:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> My laptop has been "getting windows ready" for 20 minutes... that's probably not a good sign.

780128218359529472 2016-09-25 19:33:55 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So popcats is taking a two week hiatus because there's a lot of life happening right now but Jera and I will get back at it after that 
777726924340666368 2016-09-18 04:32:02 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 yeah I've been meaning to. As soon as I work up the effort to log onto twitter on my computer, I'll do it.
776956985665171457 2016-09-16 01:32:35 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I just spent the last hour remixing together "uptown funk" and "cake by the ocean". Procrastination has never sounded so upbeat.

770441104596488192 2016-08-29 02:00:48 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 let me put it this way. He reworked the same problem back to back and got different answers and didn't notice. I think I'm safe.
770440167299481600 2016-08-29 01:57:04 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> My 90 year old calc professor: is this part going to be red? Or blue? *proceeds to pull out purple marker*
770028797240442880 2016-08-28 22:42:26 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> You could even implement a battle function where you try to knock stuff off your opponent's Katamari for you to roll up and grow in size

768644451698868224 2016-08-24 03:01:32 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I think I'm just gonna go ahead and look into getting a degree that doesn't require anymore math.
768643686926286848 2016-08-24 02:58:30 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 oh I had no idea that was a thing I will keep that in mind in the future!
768643510127980544 2016-08-24 02:57:48 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> (7/7) luckily he turned left at the next light and the crisis was averted but it's still possible he recognized my voice.
768643369635606529 2016-08-24 02:57:14 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> (6/?) duration of the longest red light of my life I sat with my face hidden behind the sun visor, sitting WAY up in my seat.
768643232221782016 2016-08-24 02:56:41 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> (5/?) see his face. It was my 90 year old calc II teacher. In the flesh. So I speed past and OF COURSE the next light is red. So for the
768643047483707393 2016-08-24 02:55:57 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> (4/?)words as I'm explaining the light situation to the guy. The light finally turns green we go, and I get around the car cause I want to

768168943131373568 2016-08-23 19:32:02 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 but I could at least get it in time for NEXT year's pokemon game!
768168876643201028 2016-08-23 19:31:46 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I'm definitely considering saving up for one though. I probably won't get it in time for sun and moon.
768168137086816256 2016-08-23 19:28:50 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> On the one hand, I would absolutely love to buy a capture kit for my 3DS. on the other hand, $550 is a lot of money. decisions decisions.
767407888083980288 2016-08-21 17:07:52 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> It's worth saying that all of the new popcats episodes coming out have stayed under 15 minutes. no more of this 30 minute business!
767386031968497668 2016-08-21 15:41:02 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Oviraptor_ @LadyMpire this one might be a stretch but there's also the velociraptor that got caught in a pitfall. The boobytraptor.
767385053391233024 2016-08-21 15:37:08 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Oviraptor_ Or a Velociraptor that knows how far he's going? A vectoraptor

749479998797471744 2016-07-02 05:48:51 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 that's what I exported it to, and I fixed the other preset to 720p 30fps to match the PS4 recording.
749479607049424896 2016-07-02 05:47:17 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I changed the quality setting I was viewing it in on YouTube.
749479344796413952 2016-07-02 05:46:15 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> PopCats episodes are rendered and quality is fixed! There's a new episode too!https://twitter.com/Cats_of_Pop/status/749478857841840128
749336187047845890 2016-07-02 20:17:23 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> New PopCats episode was taken down until we figure out our quality issues.
748654152562024448 2016-06-30 23:07:13 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I just thought everyone should know "The Little Prince" is going to be on Netflix which is important because we almost didn't get it at all.
748367334394437633 2016-06-29 04:07:31 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 ahh lame. I got excited because I saw an ad with no voices in it, but I guess that's how they get you.
748365958977314823 2016-06-29 04:02:03 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Have the Lego games abandoned the voices yet?
748188520175501312 2016-06-29 16:16:58 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @dot83 why would you want to open a window on a train anyway? I imagine that would get uncomfortably windy!
748004352682504197 2016-06-28 04:05:09 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Raikon's return: http://youtu.be/5ktJXmmc_Q0?a via @YouTube
747924042473050112 2016-06-28 22:46:02 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Just ordered my PS4. For the first time I am going to be in the current generation of gaming consoles.
747652926529757184 2016-06-27 04:48:43 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Also if anyone can help us figure out resolution issues that would be GREAT.
747652769910226945 2016-06-27 04:48:05 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Minecraft | Pilot - PopCats -here it is folks! The new channel, the new content, we're still working out some kinks. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWlUAHu_7FY&feature=share
747605711207567360 2016-06-27 01:41:06 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I doubt it but I'll definitely look into it. That's a good idea!
747603532711243777 2016-06-27 01:32:26 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 where can you get premiere for $20 a month?
747603468760686592 2016-06-27 01:32:11 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 it's called movie edit pro. Don't ever use it. And he's a friend from high school!
747602175526768642 2016-06-27 01:27:03 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 and it doesn't do crap. I can't even get it to open properly.
747602118895251459 2016-06-27 01:26:49 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 we're still trying to get video editing set up so it may be a bit before the video actually goes up. I bought a $70 video editor
747592796563877888 2016-06-27 00:49:46 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Coming soon from me: new content on a new channel with a new friend, a new name, and the same prepubescent sounding voice! :D
743293731021815808 2016-06-15 04:06:49 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Forgot one of the core basics of the game and couldn't open my chests.pic.twitter.com/qUSdlBRHwi
743278286843744256 2016-06-15 03:05:27 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @NicktheWick @sindurele @TheNerdCloset @Davkas2005 okay how about... Just outside of town?
743276976857767936 2016-06-15 03:00:15 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Hmmm... Do I build an enormous eyesore of a house in townsquare with the ugliest material I can find, or do I act totally out of character?
742841610711367680 2016-06-14 22:10:15 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I'm officially a Hewlett Packard employee! (Blacked out the photo because I don't like it)pic.twitter.com/taBWmSmmMk
740322675143254016 2016-06-07 23:20:54 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 I was making an arcana check and I rolled a 1, but my intelligence is a (-1) so I didn't know that magic SO HARD.
740317539608072193 2016-06-07 23:00:30 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I crit failed an Int check and I have a -1 modifier so I am officially the stupidest member of the party.
732416496081637377 2016-05-16 03:44:34 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Question: is the steam hardware worth buying? Does it really chalk up to what steam says it does?
731585600550100993 2016-05-14 20:42:54 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 Big McLargeHuge
731540466496233473 2016-05-14 17:43:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 but it was super glitchy, I got stuck in a tree a couple times. And as the trex I got stuck in the animals I killed.
731540067244613632 2016-05-14 17:41:58 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 it's some "be the dinosaur" exhibit where you are either trex or tricera and you have to survive by eating drinking and fighting
731539692693245953 2016-05-14 17:40:28 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> So I found my own boring dinosaur game at the museum.pic.twitter.com/4XsGDFsCF6
731285315994820608 2016-05-13 00:49:40 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Alfredo's family is on the way to pick him up! Love a happy ending!
731285206280200192 2016-05-13 00:49:14 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Dog's actual name is Alfredo.
731285162042908672 2016-05-13 00:49:03 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I found a dog and named it Sandy. We're at the animal hospital to find her home.pic.twitter.com/qctSyRWJ8N
731235942057402368 2016-05-13 21:33:28 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> It's gonna be a great day. #good lifepic.twitter.com/kClg2Ltck7
730921340698431489 2016-05-12 00:43:22 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 gotcha! Well school is over so I'll catch them more often now!
730920936405245952 2016-05-12 00:41:45 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 hey are you streaming tonight? Just curious. You know, asking for a friend.
730882147213410305 2016-05-12 22:07:37 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Kondrik what game are we talking about here? Grinding is the best part of any gaming experience, I've gotta check this out.
730880302894088192 2016-05-12 22:00:17 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 oh sweet! Definitely gonna check that out! Because *nervous sweat* who plays WoW anymore, amirite?
730880084135927809 2016-05-12 21:59:25 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Kondrik I have a feeling there's a joke there that I would understand if I had been on Twitter more :P
730879992003854337 2016-05-12 21:59:03 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> @Davkas2005 what is over watch? And why specifically that date? :P
730879381866844161 2016-05-12 21:56:38 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Okay so I'm coming out of hiding. I'm so out of touch. Do people even still play mine craft?
730878313489522690 2016-05-12 21:52:23 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Rad idea: A music app that listens to the environment around you and plays music that matches the tempo of that environment.
727312467093688320 2016-05-02 01:42:59 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I got a length of 364.7 in http://slither.io! BRUUUUHHHH
713817686757613568 2016-03-26 19:59:33 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I can't be the only one tempted to turn a game off when it says "do not touch power" just to see the outcome.
707027147823579136 2016-03-07 02:16:22 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Ever seen a cat chase his tail?pic.twitter.com/7jokTZoHXq
698544152741543940 2016-02-13 16:27:58 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/ZVzzk0NszBY?a The Black Satans - The Satan Of Hell | Benny Hill Remix
695071049612816384 2016-02-03 02:27:06 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> Plot twist: all voltorbs are actually ditto's blending in like pokeballs so they won't be forced to battle. But then they lose who they are.
694211354127781888 2016-02-01 17:30:59 UTC <Raikon_Chemlyk> What if cats are disobedient because there's no human who has enough gym badges to train them yet?
