965562259517984768 2018-02-19 12:22:36 UTC <RCierraD73> And before anyone says something about white shooters being a minority? From 1982 to 2017 not including recent shootings? 54 out of 95 mass shootings were committed by a white person. Thats roughly 57% committed just by white shooters. Over half.  https://www.statista.com/statistics/476456/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-shooter-s-race/https://twitter.com/rcierrad73/status/965559408704081921

That term only applies if they are a person of color. #NikolasCruz #FloridaShooting #ImWithTheKids #ENOUGHhttps://twitter.com/rcierrad73/status/965558434258149377
965558434258149377 2018-02-19 12:07:24 UTC <RCierraD73> Articles like this need to STOP. He is not the victim here. He is garbage. He is not a child. He is a legal adult who made a decision to commit mass murder. He did slip through the cracks in that he should have been prosecuted long ago for terroristic threats, but he wasnt. 1/2pic.twitter.com/CEHsTuStWn

958378978250842112 2018-01-30 16:38:48 UTC <RCierraD73> Im waiting on my doctor to call me back and give me some information. Im waiting for this stupid ass game to load or to get some information.  One or the other needs to happen before I cease my angry tweeting towards @BlizzardCS and start the hormonal sobbing.
958376249839312896 2018-01-30 16:27:58 UTC <RCierraD73> @BlizzardCS Any information from the techs or an ETA? (Ive read the forum. So its useless to post it again.)
958357435307216901 2018-01-30 15:13:12 UTC <RCierraD73> @BlizzardCS Considering its been over an hour since the servers went back online Im pretty sure people have given it time. But ok.
958349113438932993 2018-01-30 14:40:08 UTC <RCierraD73> @BlizzardCS Person less than 5 miles from me that I play with is on and has been for 30 minutes. Mine isnt letting me access characters or anything. What is the point in paying for a game that doesnt work?

942593689985212417 2017-12-17 03:13:42 UTC <RCierraD73> Just gonna leave this here. Because yeah. Its about Craplo Ren. But there is a key part about Luke Skywalker and who he was that should have been taken into account before he was butchered in the Last Jedi. #NotMyStarWars and Im done for the night  http://ferdinandcham.tumblr.com/post/166482080491/ferdinandcham-spaceytreats-ferdinandcham
942591564865527808 2017-12-17 03:05:16 UTC <RCierraD73> Im just so upset by this butchering of a character and a franchise so many people loved. I was on the fence about the reboot in the first place, but this solidified it. I wont be watching another Star Wars movie. #NotMyStarWars #NotMyLukeSkywalker
942591094440845314 2017-12-17 03:03:24 UTC <RCierraD73> Literally Lukes entire characterization was about love, compassion, and seeing the good in others, even those who had no hope of redemption. I mean Kylo is AWFUL, but my Luke Skywalker would never have given up on him. And def not try killing him in cold blood #NotMyStarWars
942589957683761153 2017-12-17 02:58:53 UTC <RCierraD73> So @rianjohnson is telling us that Luke Still Sees the Good In Darth Vader Despite Genocide and Evil Skywalker was going to kill his nephew because he suddenly developed a psychotic and out of character bout of paranoia? Yeah. Ok. Lmao. #NotMyStarWars
