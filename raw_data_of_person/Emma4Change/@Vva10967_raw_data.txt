970573860155416577 2018-03-05 08:16:55 UTC <Vva10967> @RVAwonk The pharma price scheme is so insane that it is possible for the uninsured GoodRx discounted price to be lower than the price you would pay WITH insurance.
970573163447967744 2018-03-05 08:14:09 UTC <Vva10967> @RVAwonk GoodRx has an app for your smartphone and you can see with the app if their program (which is free) will save you money. It works with coupons which get you their negotiated rate. And the app shows you the prices that pharmacies near you charge for the same med.

970167889826369537 2018-03-03 05:23:44 UTC <Vva10967> @darlenewaters @BillKristol @realDonaldTrump always projects on Hillary what is true about himself. When he said she was crooked, HE was crooked. When he accused the Clinton Foundation of wrongdoing, HIS Trump Foundation was engaged in wrongdoing. Now HE is unhappy and says that she is.
970102002989576192 2018-03-03 01:01:55 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Hey Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ohio, it looks like you are REALLY going to regret your vote for Trump!  Looks like he is going to kill the auto industry that Barack Obama saved in 2009.  But why should that surprise us? He's bent on undoing EVERYTHING Obama accomplished.
970083344074539009 2018-03-03 23:47:47 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro It's a REPUBLICAN-CAUSED problem Ana. It will only be resolved by VOTING EVERY REPUBLICAN OUT of office in 2018. When Sandy Hook happened in 2012 and the GOP refused to do anything about it, we should all have understood that the GOP had no soul left. #BlueWave2018 #ChangeParties
970081828072771586 2018-03-03 23:41:45 UTC <Vva10967> @DonaldJTrumpJr You should google Bill and Hillary Clinton.  The attacks on THEM were unparalleled and still are.  The attacks on your dad have been brought on by his own hateful rhetoric and actions. And who the f*ck is Mark Levin and why would anyone care what the f*ck he has to say???
970071560865439744 2018-03-03 23:00:57 UTC <Vva10967> @PaulBegala @DevinNunes Americans who are unhappy with the economy vote Republican. They need to start voting Democratic if they want their lives to improve. Wait and see how rural America fares after Trump is done screwing  our trade agreements. It will be a disaster.

They love Shattered because its narrative absolves them.
969067161254858753 2018-02-28 04:29:50 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh Its Karma. They all backed Trump knowing what a POS he was and how temperamentally, morally and mentally UNFIT he was.

Always saying she wasnt likable or trustworthy & always assuming the worst about her. Gave a total free pass to DonTheCon & his swamp. #Karma
968706139788644352 2018-02-27 04:35:16 UTC <Vva10967> @tribelaw The Republicans in the House wont impeach him. For them its Party over Country. Once Dems take over after the 2018 midterm they have to weaken Trump through hearings and then impeach. Or Mueller could find out that Trump and Pence conspired with Russia against the United States
968601671856205831 2018-02-27 21:40:08 UTC <Vva10967> @Acosta Only path forward is to vote out of office EVERY Republican in November 2018. #BlueWave

968540211490820096 2018-02-27 17:35:55 UTC <Vva10967> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Because Mueller has not presented the obstruction case yet.  And has not added your pals to the conspiracy against the United States case yet.  But it's coming.... and you know it.

Fox News is ENTERTAINMENT, NOT real news.  That's why Fox is allowed to LIE, because the FCC mistakenly assumes that its idiot audience KNOWS it's entertainment.

968015225978064896 2018-02-25 06:49:49 UTC <Vva10967> @CNNPolitics If Hillary had sent Chelsea to practice Diplomacy with the South Koreans you would all be calling it what it is: NEPOTISM and questioning why shes there when she isnt a diplomat and her only qualification is being the daughter of the POTUS.
968013097347768320 2018-02-25 06:41:21 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidKlion @davidslavick Yes you can tell how much those excusing Monika hate Hillary when they are rewriting history to excuse the mistress and pervert the MeToo movement, even though there is a transcript put out by Ken Starr to humiliate Bill Clinton detailing what and how it actually happened.
968009838667198464 2018-02-25 06:28:24 UTC <Vva10967> @MonicaLewinsky @DavidKlion @NanInKansas @Ramona2uimby Youre rewriting history as is she. She was 22 yo, had a crush on Bill Clinton, brought him pizza during a government shutdown, she lifted  her own skirt and proceeded to give him a blow job.  Thats NOT workplace sexual harassment.
968007456365441024 2018-02-25 06:18:56 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidKlion If thats the new standard then every old geezer who has had a consenting sexual relation with a woman over the age of 21 but who is 20 years his junior is now a sexual predator. Thats perverting #MeToo. @VanityFair @Monikalewinsky
968005418625757184 2018-02-25 06:10:51 UTC <Vva10967> @MonicaLewinsky @AlyssaMastro44 Except that we can all read the details of what happened & how it happened because Ken Starr made it public and shes the one who lifts her skirt after bringing Bill a pizza during a government shutdown so to compare her relationship with Bill to a MeToo abuse is just wrong.
967996805123379201 2018-02-25 05:36:37 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert The narrative is correct. A Republican Congress will not do anything on gun control and neither will a Republican State Legislature or a Republican Governor.  Which is why the GOP MUST ALL BE VOTED OUT in November 2018. #NeverAgain

Or not get paid because shes a woman? Bc those were 3 out of more than 100 speeches she gave & she got paid 6 figures for most of them. & only reason everyone knows that is that unlike Bernie & Trump SHE released her taxes

Bernie would always end his speeches reminding his audience that they would have to hold @HillaryClinton to her promises once she was elected POTUS, reinforcing the idea that she wasnt being honest when she said she backed the Dem platform.

967449924961996800 2018-02-24 17:23:31 UTC <Vva10967> @KFILE Maybe it will force the members to elect new leaders who actually reflect the gun owners  views instead of the gun manufacturers views. Although its possible that the nomination process of the NRA prevents that. Some orgs have bylaws that entrench the power of the insiders.

966901740745367553 2018-02-22 05:05:13 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines I still find it too coincidental that Bernie adopted his rigged election narrative right around the time that the DNC emails were hacked (and thus, in Putins possession) and Putin needed a narrative to weaponize them, which Bernie conveniently provided.

Apparently NOTHING about civics because you clearly have no Fing clue what the Speaker of the House does! Google it. Maybe youll then learn to appreciate how talented Pelosi is and why Republicans keep trying to bring her down.
966574425880580096 2018-02-21 07:24:35 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill And in April and May 2016 Putin had the hacked DNC emails. He needed a narrative to weaponize them. He got one from Bernie who began peddling the nonsense that the primary was rigged. Coincidence or collusion?

965726216362909696 2018-02-19 23:14:06 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 I bet Trump will manage to outdo them all.  And he can because he is an insane idiot and the Republicans in Congress are complicit with him and refuse to stop him. He can nuke a country, start a nuclear armageddon and bankrupt the country, which is really all he knows how to do
965680073155149824 2018-02-19 20:10:45 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill Why wont @HillaryClinton sue him? Seems thats the only language Trumpers understand.
965313113171034113 2018-02-18 19:52:35 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Dear Dotard:  maybe you should ask your IC briefer to explain it to you instead of Faux and Friends? It was IRAN's money that we had frozen. Obama unfroze it. It was never OUR money.  Get it?
965284589747961856 2018-02-18 17:59:14 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow @jjz1600 @MalcolmNance @LawdHelpUSa @SophieInCT @Momof2inDE So are they enjoying the President they elected?
965284109462507521 2018-02-18 17:57:20 UTC <Vva10967> @MalcolmNance @amjoyshow @jjz1600 Not true. We have the 2012 results from Gary Johnson and Jill Stein to measure the effect that Putin's sabotage & Bernie's slanders had. Putin couldn't have succeeded without Bernie's bizarre "election is rigged" claims which is what Putin needed & used to weaponize DNC emails.
965282621264670721 2018-02-18 17:51:25 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro @wlft1 @ValleyQuercus @AmyLaurenSomers And Trump registered his Make America Great Again trademark on November 19, 2012 so his claim that he hadn't announced that he was running in 2014 so how would Russia know is a LIE, like everything else that comes out of his mouth.
965281158983495681 2018-02-18 17:45:37 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro @wlft1 Examining the voting machines in the MI WI & PA districts that inexplicably went for Trump and in Southern FL would be a start. DHS has said in Congressional Testimony that they did NOT examine any voting machine to arrive at their assessment that votes weren't changed.
965280310874210304 2018-02-18 17:42:14 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro I wouldn't be shocked if Bernie's campaign were too. He came up with the "election is rigged" nonsense right after the DNC emails were hacked and were in Putin's possession, which is precisely the narrative that Putin needed (and used) to weaponize them.
965279150088114177 2018-02-18 17:37:38 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein @davidaxelrod @GrinsvenMatthew @RobinHoodReport @Statistar30 @bex0760 @erroltonysoma @monad1010 True, that's because of self-entitled pricks like you who keep getting Republicans elected by sabotaging the only party that can beat them.
965278459630059521 2018-02-18 17:34:53 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod Funny that the media keeps saying that Trump can win in 2020 when in 2016 he was an accidental POTUS who did NOT have enough voters of  his own to win but won thanks to the 3rd party protest voter idiots who thought MI, WI & PA were safe blue states. THEY MADE TRUMP POTUS.
965264569848532993 2018-02-18 16:39:41 UTC <Vva10967> @SenatorDurbin @SandraPfaff57 Im pretty sure he said because the Latino community considered him dangerous. We did. He was like Justice Thomas has been for the Black community. Someone who uses his ethnicity to advance and then eliminates the very same programs that helped him.
965119453246738432 2018-02-17 07:03:03 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @chrislhayes Unless Mueller were to examine the voting machines in the MI WI and PA precincts whose voting results didnt match the polls or the party registration of the voters. DHSs claim that the voting machines werent hacked is baseless.  It didnt examine any to know for sure.
965114594862780416 2018-02-17 06:43:45 UTC <Vva10967> @NBCNews Lol. Does @realDonaldTrump think that Mueller and his team would be investigating potential school shooters if they werent investigating Russias sabotage of our 2016 presidential election and his collusion with Putin? 
965113263456440326 2018-02-17 06:38:27 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @xchrisk5 And the media and Trump used the crowd size to reinforce the narrative that she was unpopular when in reality the venues chosen were too small and people who wanted to see her couldnt.
965112567118155776 2018-02-17 06:35:41 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @xchrisk5 Which unfortunately was a mistake in the general because the media wasnt covering her events or her policies and she could have reached thousands more. There were always long lines of people who couldnt get in at her events because the venue had reached capacity.
965106698762539009 2018-02-17 06:12:22 UTC <Vva10967> @NastyCatWoman1 @joanwalsh Obviously thats the lie he is making everyone who works for him say. And McMasters didnt say it. And its the reason Rosenstein said it in the presser limiting it to this indictment so it would be true.
965105534172106752 2018-02-17 06:07:44 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump So thats the lie you are making everyone in your administration repeat?  Your @DHSgov wont test the voting machines so they have NO basis for asserting that Russia didnt hack them. And you won because 78000 Berners voted 3rd Party in states they thought were safe blue.
965045685136523265 2018-02-17 02:09:55 UTC <Vva10967> Exactly.https://twitter.com/realNandanSage/status/964965668796948480
965030664797151232 2018-02-17 01:10:14 UTC <Vva10967> @GOPChairwoman And @SenMajLdr and @SpeakerRyan betrayed our country when they put Party first and didn't let Obama tell the country what Russia was doing. #Treason #TreasonousGOP #BlueWave2018 #VoteTheTraitorsOUT
965015282732490752 2018-02-17 00:09:07 UTC <Vva10967> @denver_rose @askboomer1949 If it were the Koch brothers I would say yes. This donor not so much.
965005494371999745 2018-02-17 23:30:13 UTC <Vva10967> @robjective Then why not show us the ads and let US decide?  Its the least @facebook can do. Plus Mark Zuckerberg says he believes in transparency. Time to prove it!
965003786535260160 2018-02-17 23:23:26 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @swain241 @AshaRangappa_ Even more interesting is the timing of his rigged claim. It starts after the Russians have hacked the DNC emails and coincidentally its precisely the narrative that Putin needed to weaponize them. 
964926761241804800 2018-02-17 18:17:22 UTC <Vva10967> @DesignDreamer1 Yeah but @DHSgov refuses to examine the voting machines and prefers to make a baseless claim that they werent hacked.
964757884331577345 2018-02-16 07:06:18 UTC <Vva10967> @riotwomennn @Sensata2014 @AuntieMM42 @hollymwchris But it could if Mueller uncovers collusion with Russia that takes down both Trump and Pence in 2019 and Nancy Pelosi is Speaker.
964696793492664321 2018-02-16 03:03:33 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes And by the way, all you pundits keep saying that Trump can win in 2020 and never stop to think that he is an accidental POTUS who got elected because enough idiots voted 3rd party in states they thought were safely blue.  Those idiots made Trump POTUS.
964696228847083520 2018-02-16 03:01:18 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes But it did change the outcome and Mueller and Rosenstein know that if they were to say so, Trump would fire them both. Trump didn't have enough voters of his own to win. He NEEDED the Berners to vote for Jill Stein and Gary Johnson and it worked, THEY elected him.
964676805696327682 2018-02-16 01:44:07 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @BrookLyn1825 do you know when and where he said that? Would love to get the video.
964675611775176704 2018-02-16 01:39:23 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @Social_1_Media That "data" is fake. School shootings began with Columbine in 1999.
964675129161723905 2018-02-16 01:37:28 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @cjcamp49 @Lauwomanator Pretty sure you're arguing with a bot.
964659222075052032 2018-02-16 00:34:15 UTC <Vva10967> @JoshSchwerin @PatriotDem The going high when they go low hasnt worked out too well for us. We need to go subterranean when they go low.
964658642610982919 2018-02-16 00:31:57 UTC <Vva10967> @johnpodesta @JoshSchwerin @ThinSkinTrump Podesta got hacked in March 2016 as did the DNC. His speech asking Russia to find Hillarys emails was in late July.
964642677345214464 2018-02-16 23:28:31 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @tomwatson So how do you explain Bernie's "the election is rigged" accusation, which was bizarre yet new and began right after the Russians had hacked (and thus had in their possession) the DNC emails and was precisely what Russia needed (and used) to weaponize them?
964615172802400262 2018-02-16 21:39:13 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines @NefarusContrara The election is rigged? Bernie came up with that and it was what Putin needed to weaponize the DNC emails that Russia already had when Bernie started claiming that.
964614235757142017 2018-02-16 21:35:30 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports So all 130 will be out?
964378403120926721 2018-02-15 05:58:23 UTC <Vva10967> @awelab1956 @TheRynheart He probably assumes that because the shooter has a Spanish last name he must be a member of MS-13 
964327701933887488 2018-02-15 02:36:55 UTC <Vva10967> @ThePlumLineGS You mean THIS IS A LIE AND WE SHOULD ALL CALL IT A LIE.  There, I fixed it.
963934413443731462 2018-02-14 00:34:07 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilipRucker Elections have consequences. Trump is a sociopath and lacks empathy. WE knew that. Why are we surprised now?
963933992054611968 2018-02-14 00:32:27 UTC <Vva10967> @KatyTurNBC By electing Republicans?
963879806927556611 2018-02-14 20:57:08 UTC <Vva10967> @VABVOX @JulieAnderson01 @nasty_woman2 @PopessAllyBlue Lol. Immigrating to Canada is not as easy as PM Trudeau makes it sound. VICE recently did a report on how difficult it actually is. We need to stop electing Republicans. At all levels of government.
963878966816894976 2018-02-14 20:53:48 UTC <Vva10967> @VABVOX @RashmiGaur9 Because we choose to spend our tax revenue on military equipment that our military doesnt need or want and choose to give control of the Congress to the party that has no heart and only cares about profits.
963452020752637952 2018-02-13 16:37:16 UTC <Vva10967> @joshfoxfilm You just killed your credibility as far as Im concerned. If you can lie about the election to fit your desired outcome you can also lie about other things so Im not sure I believe what you showed in Gaslight anymore.
963450084259192832 2018-02-13 16:29:34 UTC <Vva10967> @SenFeinstein @DMRegister @ChuckGrassley @JoyAnnReid @JulieAnnLily Remember that in 2010 Chuck Grassley who had helped write Obamacare went home and campaigned on the LIE that Obamacare had death panels in it and pulled the plug on grandma, and he was allowed to get away with it. Not one Democrat called him on it! He has no moral compass.
963316815681204229 2018-02-12 07:40:01 UTC <Vva10967> @krassenstein And if the Dems win the House they can release Trumps Tax Returns to the public!
963314650065657856 2018-02-12 07:31:24 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Those same people made Trump President. He didnt have enough voters to win. But he won because the Revolutionary a-holes wanted to protest vote just to say FU to @HillaryClinton instead of doing everything they could to stop Trump.
963309940877258753 2018-02-12 07:12:41 UTC <Vva10967> @MyDaughtersArmy @RX7_Lover825 @jonalisag At least with President Obamas you look at it and you know its President Obama. With Michelles you look at it and go, who could that be? It doesnt look like her.
963194801884745729 2018-02-12 23:35:10 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidPriess So at what point does the IC recognize that we have a Manchurian candidate occupying the Oval Office? IC foks tend to be Republican, however the GOP under Trump has morphed into a treasonous party.
963193237618995200 2018-02-12 23:28:57 UTC <Vva10967> @leximccammond @TheBeatWithAri isn't it illegal to give access to classified information to people who do not have clearances and thus are not authorized to see it? And if so, who prosecutes it and if DOJ, what is the statute of limitations?
963192206176739329 2018-02-12 23:24:51 UTC <Vva10967> @MyDaughtersArmy @jonalisag @RX7_Lover825 Agreed. If it didn't say that it was Michelle, I would never have guessed. Barack's does look like him. But with Michelle, the artist missed.
962953237992177665 2018-02-11 07:35:17 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @jenpiotti The happy ending requires a Dem-controlled US House and Senate and a Dem Speaker who becomes POTUS, selects HRC as her VP, resigns and goes back to being Speaker.  Oh and the Illegitimate Orange Clown and his VP are sent to Gitmo for treason.
962951443471794176 2018-02-11 07:28:09 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @want2brd Oh I would watch! The trials would be AWESOME and the sentencing hearings would make America great again! 
962932321631469568 2018-02-11 06:12:10 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @joshfoxfilm Hillary was very nice to him. in 2016. Trump would have unmasked him. And whoever runs in 2020 WILL unmask him. #NeverBernie
962929276122263552 2018-02-11 06:00:04 UTC <Vva10967> @joshfoxfilm Hey Josh, if you just came back to planet Earth, the lawsuit was dismissed. The DNC is NOT a king making institution except in Bernies mind and I bet even he doesnt believe his own lies.
962923608061501442 2018-02-11 05:37:33 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro This proves that Trump is a symptom and not the cause, and that it is the REPUBLICAN PARTY and not just Trump that embraces White Supremacy. You really don't belong there.http://a.msn.com/01/en-us/BBJ0oum?ocid=st
962785316452163584 2018-02-11 20:28:01 UTC <Vva10967> @MikePettigano @djlavoie @SallyAlbright @JoshuaMZeitz But they have to call HER loser in the headline yet they dont do that with Romney. Probably not with Biden either who lost TWICE already and badly or with Kerry who lost BOTH the EC AND the popular vote.
962567945053507584 2018-02-10 06:04:16 UTC <Vva10967> @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @POTUS @JerryFalwellJr Oh my God, you are loony too and you run a University!
962566168539226112 2018-02-10 05:57:12 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill Who is going to buy that?  A crazy woman interviews a man with dementia who cant read? 
962565152976654336 2018-02-10 05:53:10 UTC <Vva10967> @VABVOX @martysullivanjr @bethecricket And @mitchellreports is also getting her share of karma. I think about how badly she treated @HillaryClinton during the campaign whenever Tillerson ignores her or makes her fly commercial
962551845930627072 2018-02-10 05:00:18 UTC <Vva10967> @Waitingfour4 @danpfeiffer And the reason the Dream Act was able to pass the House in 2010 is that @NancyPelosi was Speaker of the House and she got things done. Since Republicans took over the House in 2011 NOTHING gets done. #RepublicansAreIncompetents
962548400343437312 2018-02-10 04:46:36 UTC <Vva10967> @tribelaw @Sharonhotaling3 Nah. She let @Comey steal the election for Trump. She and Lynch both had the legal authority to stop him & knew what he was going to do. Chose not to.
962499396888924161 2018-02-10 01:31:53 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @ananavarro So Ana, George W. Bush wasn't POTUS in 2008???  And Boehner wasn't Speaker in 2011?  And GOP didn't contest Al Franken's Senate win until July 2009? And Scott Brown didn't win his MA Senate Seat in early 2010? Really??? And DACA somehow preceded President Obama's 2012 EO?
962498176656773120 2018-02-10 01:27:02 UTC <Vva10967> @BradMossEsq They're not a "watchdog" group, they're a "Hillary-hunting" group.  That is all they've done since they were created.
962493262853496832 2018-02-10 01:07:30 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump And DACA wasn't a thing until 2012 when Obama invented it with his Executive Order that YOU rescinded.
962492991419092992 2018-02-10 01:06:26 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Hey Dotard, George W. Bush was POTUS in 2008 and John Boehner was Speaker of the House in 2011.  And GOP fought Al Franken's election for 8 months to keep Dems from reaching 60 votes in the Senate and in early 2010 Dems lost Ted Kennedy's seat and thus their 60 vote control.
962491333456945152 2018-02-10 00:59:50 UTC <Vva10967> More families being torn apart by ICE because THIRD PARTY PROTEST VOTERS thought that saying FU to @HillaryClinton was more important than stopping Trump. @SenSanders this is also on you and your "rigged" BS.http://www.wfsb.com/story/37468643/rally-held-in-support-of-couple-facing-deportation#.Wn-VKzoSF5A.twitter

962478125908152320 2018-02-10 00:07:21 UTC <Vva10967> @BetsyGervasi @ABC Bet Chachi says the same thing!
962210058036793344 2018-02-09 06:22:09 UTC <Vva10967> @rtraister Well we didnt elect him. Hes an accidental President who lost the popular vote and only won the electoral college because the Berners and Bernettes decided that saying FU to @HillaryClinton with their 3rd Party votes was more important than stopping Trump and Trumpism. 
962090524684546052 2018-02-09 22:27:10 UTC <Vva10967> @kcbyrne @steve_vladeck Maddow said the other day that they had brought Boente back in some other job so he's not gone yet.
962040632473612291 2018-02-09 19:08:55 UTC <Vva10967> @ZarinaZabrisky @WendySiegelman Makes me wonder if the prostitutes from the PeePee tape wouldn't have uploaded the video to some web or video site back in 2013 when Trump was a businessman but not a presidential candidate or if they didn't write a book similar to the one that Navalny shows in the video?
962037148911222784 2018-02-09 18:55:04 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @Diego_Galaviz_ Only if Dems take the House and ideally also the Senate. We can't leave her exposed to Republican Congresssional shenanigans again.
962036348558479360 2018-02-09 18:51:53 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 And in a clip I saw yesterday @mitchellreports reminded us that the media has no problem w failed POTUS Candidate Biden going for a THIRD try in 2020!   And let's not forget John Kerry who LOST popular vote in 2004 in addition to EC & will be 76 in 2020 but plans to run anyway!
961832934339624960 2018-02-08 05:23:36 UTC <Vva10967> @RepBonnie As your constituent, I urge you to stand with @NancyPelosi and vote NO on the budget bill until Paul Ryan agrees to a clean DACA bill vote in the House. If the government shuts down, so be it.  Dems need to stand with the DACA kids. Thank you.
961831370845663233 2018-02-08 05:17:23 UTC <Vva10967> @NancyPelosi @ananavarro Ana, maybe you need to examine your own biases? Maybe it's internalized misogyny and sexism? Pretty sure that you would say the same thing about @HillaryClinton yet if you examine Hillary's and Nancy's roles in history, they're VERY inspiring.
961793472272400385 2018-02-08 02:46:47 UTC <Vva10967> @dfro @PhilippeReines Yeah but Kelly fired the bodyguard in September 2017.  I mean the bodyguard "resigned" in September 2017. 
961658310545018880 2018-02-08 17:49:42 UTC <Vva10967> @ApocalypticaNow No but sexism and misogyny do. The media covers @NancyPelosi the same way they cover @HillaryClinton focusing 100% on their voice & what they wore & never ever covering their policies or their achievements & always telling people that theyre unpopular.
961483959053049857 2018-02-07 06:16:54 UTC <Vva10967> @RWPUSA Mmmmm NO. Youre assuming hes imitating Putin. I think hes following Hitlers playbook which we know he kept by his bed in 1991. Presumably he was capable of reading back then.

The draft dodger who thinks that POWs are losers and not war heroes because they got captured? The guy who pretends that his foundation gave money to vets? The one who calls states with opioid crisis drug infested dens? That guy? 
961475460797382656 2018-02-07 05:43:07 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh @EricRiback @moorehn Actually if that were true the Senate Immigration bill from 2014 would be law today. Its not. The then Speaker of the House John Boehner kept it from being voted on. Because he could.
961474737472987136 2018-02-07 05:40:15 UTC <Vva10967> @moorehn You may want to educate yourself on how impeachment works. Its spelled out in the US Constitution. Spoiler Alert: it must be started by the House. Guess who controls the agenda there? Hint: he aint a Democrat.
961429566022737920 2018-02-07 02:40:45 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Or Adolf Hitler. Remember this is the guy who back in 1991 when he could still read, kept a copy of Hitlers My New Order by his bed per the interview that his then wife Ivana gave to Vanity Fair.
961378356066504705 2018-02-07 23:17:16 UTC <Vva10967> So the rule about giving back the money donated by sexual predators only applies to Dems? @GOP #GOPisPartyOfSexualPredatorshttps://twitter.com/rebeccaballhaus/status/961245734933811203
961306735133843456 2018-02-07 18:32:40 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines @MeghanMcCain needs to be replaced on @TheView.  She's unbearable to watch & unlike her father she's ignorant & uninformed, AND uses Trump's White Supremacist term (Chain Migration) to refer to Family Reunification & says Dems should just CAVE to the Orange Hitler's MAWA plans!
961293766840733700 2018-02-07 17:41:08 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC Lindsey, YOU KNOW the Orange Fuhrer wants a military parade honoring HIM, not the troops. Like Hitler in Nazi Germany.  You know who read Hitler's My New Order in the 1990s? Donald Trump. His then wife Ivana told Vanity Fair in 1991. This is NOT a coincidence. #militaryparade
961136957161132033 2018-02-06 07:18:02 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines Actually I think Hitlers Nazi Germany is more like it. Remember that Ivana said in 1991 that the Orange Fuhrer kept a copy of Hitlers My New Order near his bed and he could still read back then.
961133085826961409 2018-02-06 07:02:39 UTC <Vva10967> @POTUS @davidaxelrod You assume that because someone has served in our armed forces he/she cant be a racist?  General Kelly agrees with Trump.
960655651209973760 2018-02-05 23:25:30 UTC <Vva10967> That's too bad.https://twitter.com/snopes/status/960649740164698113
960272505364770816 2018-02-04 22:03:00 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @orangedouche @sparriemcclary Same percentage in FL too.
960236585886380032 2018-02-04 19:40:17 UTC <Vva10967> @Scaramucci @emzorbit @ThisWeekABC No worries. We KNOW Donald Trump. He would be lying because that is who he is, a compulsive liar  and what he does. No chance that he would do it accidentally or unintentionally 
960182865882419201 2018-02-04 16:06:49 UTC <Vva10967> @Evan_McMullin But it's because Director @Comey agreed to politicize the @FBI to investigate @HillaryClinton for her use of Bill Clinton's email server to handle her non-classified State Dept emails, when W's administration had "lost" 22 MILLION emails & Colin Powell had put his emails on AOL.
960052007569674240 2018-02-03 07:26:50 UTC <Vva10967> @mamashenay @maggieNYT OMG! @realDonaldTrump is accidentally telling the truth for once!  
960051054044942336 2018-02-03 07:23:02 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump The memo is stupid. Its nothing more than Fox talking points. Its soooo stupid that if he were on The Apprentice, you would tell Nunes, Devin Youre Fired!!!   He really sucks!!!   And if YOU had read his memo, you would know that. Nunes is as stupid as his memo! 
960048467321253888 2018-02-03 07:12:46 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Wall Street Journal is owned by Rupert Murdoch, same guy that owns Fox.  BOTH are FAKE NEWS. Enough said. 
960047953267314688 2018-02-03 07:10:43 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Heck the @FBI hid that you were colluding with Russia AND Director @Comey went rogue on @HillaryClinton and got YOU elected POTUS.
960046309335031808 2018-02-03 07:04:11 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN @realDonaldTrump @WhoopiGoldberg @davidaxelrod Because Trump is an illegitimate President who won with @Comeys and a rogue FBIs help?
960018392097968128 2018-02-03 05:13:15 UTC <Vva10967> @danpfeiffer Maybe we should be asking about the political leanings of the @nytimes Executive Editor Dean Baquet. Is he a Republican? Every freaking NYT headline about Democrats is negative and yet when it comes to Trump the NY Times is always giving him passes and cant call his LIES, LIES!
959667800058023936 2018-02-02 06:00:07 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines @ChristinLuvsSno I bet Nunes Memo #2 will be on Uranium One. Trump is now quoting Tom Fitton, the Judicial Watch a-hole who should have been committed to a psychiatric ward a long time ago.
959618813829492737 2018-02-02 02:45:28 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu We know he does. He already said in a recent interview that he thinks he needs a 9-11 type of event to unite the country (supposedly behind him). I'm pretty sure the country would unite AGAINST him.
959599998328541186 2018-02-02 01:30:42 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Also, don't you think it's suspicious that there was a garbage truck standing on the tracks of the Amtrak train that was carrying the GOP Congressmen to their GOP retreat in West Virginia? Would Trump have expected to get a response similar to the 1 GOP got in baseball shooting?
959599184960778240 2018-02-02 01:27:28 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Trump already said out loud in a recent interview that he thinks a 9-11 type of attack would help him unite the country.  He IS thinking about it.
959318361329975296 2018-02-01 06:51:35 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @CindyPDX True. Just the BernieBros and Bernettes who voted third party to avenge their Messiah did.
959312972421087232 2018-02-01 06:30:10 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah But in the meantime I believe one of the House committees can get the Tax returns, Republicans just refuse to get them, so we should see them in 2019 when Dems are back in control of the House.
959312333339222020 2018-02-01 06:27:38 UTC <Vva10967> @SenFeinstein @kimfrederi @JulieAnnLily What do you expect Senator Feinstein to do? She sent Twitter a letter. As long as Dems are in the minority that is all she can do. Republicans control the hearings and who gets summoned to DC. Dems do not.
959309975481757696 2018-02-01 06:18:15 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidJollyFL What do you think would happen if Nunes releases his memo and there are massive resignations at the FBI in protest?
959220850191949824 2018-02-01 00:24:06 UTC <Vva10967> @MittRomney are you sure you don't want to take up knitting like @VanityFair says losing Presidential Candidates should???  
958956171272118273 2018-01-31 06:52:22 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill She knew wed need something to keep us occupied during Trumps SOTU since we were boycotting it. 
958954908883062784 2018-01-31 06:47:21 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @Comey @FBI @NickMerrill Similarly with Nunes memo, Nunes is accusing the FBI of abusing its surveillance powers & the FBI cant correct the record without disclosing the classified info that it included in the FISA warrant application /2
958954136455786496 2018-01-31 06:44:17 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill And Karma is hitting Strzok AND the FBI hard. Nunes is doing to the @FBI what @Comey did to @HillaryClinton in July 2016: falsely accusing her of being extremely careless knowing she couldnt defend herself without making public the emails that they had now labeled classified./1
958951707194556416 2018-01-31 06:34:38 UTC <Vva10967> @politico @TGowdySC got sick of selling his soul to the devil for power???  or is he going back home to collect his reward for having done so? Did Trump promise him a judgeship for betraying the @FBI with his vote to release the Nunes memo?
958942755148980225 2018-01-31 05:59:03 UTC <Vva10967> @morninggloria @samstein Press inability to just say Im sorry over obsessive coverage of @HillaryClintons emails, sexist and misogynistic coverage and false equivalencies reflects a weird trait of virtually every media outlet : the notion that apologizing is a sign of weakness.   #FixedIt4U
958922725610938368 2018-01-31 04:39:28 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh I dont. And frankly I think its more likely that Michael Wolff was referring to her than to Nikki Haley since it was Hope that was steaming Trumps pants while he was wearing them and shes the age that he finds attractive. 
958921068223389698 2018-01-31 04:32:53 UTC <Vva10967> @TGowdySC Returning to the justice system will be hard after betraying the FBI to protect the Orange Fuhrer, no?  How you sleep at night is a mistery to me. Youre so crooked!!! #PartyOverCountry
958732263981834240 2018-01-31 16:02:38 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines Melania's outfit was a strange choice for a birther.
958569822966738945 2018-01-30 05:17:09 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro @TheView Can you PLEASE replace @MeghanMcCain with Ana Navarro?  Meghan always sounds bitter and/or resentful. Ana on the other hand is very entertaining. Love her!
958476766745694208 2018-01-30 23:07:23 UTC <Vva10967> Since Trump believes in conspiracy theories, lets hope he isnt planning a 9-11.https://apple.news/ASXau0PkVSi6vUNHy-Kx95g
958468067662749699 2018-01-30 22:32:49 UTC <Vva10967> @willafrej Would love to know who his wife and adult children voted for in 2016. So many voted for Trump and showed NO empathy for the immigrants that Trump openly targeted, thinking that his anti-immigrant agenda would not affect them, and surprise, it has!

958385308323794944 2018-01-30 17:03:58 UTC <Vva10967> @PoliticsWolf Yeah but the Trump Tax Scams elimination of the SALT deduction will cost GOP their seats in CA NY and NJ because it raises taxes on the income brackets that typically vote Republican, to punish blue states.
958383983368261632 2018-01-30 16:58:42 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes Except that Democratic control of the House and Senate can expose and stop that. THAT was missing in the Benghazi and email witch hunts where Republicans ABUSED the governments power for political purposes.
958381049985236993 2018-01-30 16:47:02 UTC <Vva10967> Hey @CNN @cnnbrk @CNNPolitics one of your employees is using plagiarized data. #investigate https://twitter.com/redistrict/status/958370576191709190
958214952573120512 2018-01-29 05:47:02 UTC <Vva10967> @RepDeSantis Enjoy it. You will lose your majority in November and that will end your treasonous conduct (unless Mueller ends it sooner) 
958214220230873088 2018-01-29 05:44:07 UTC <Vva10967> @RepAdamSchiff FBI didnt find her handling of classified info extremely careless, Director @Comey did. And his history with the Clintons was long and suspect enough that he should have recused himself from the investigation and let his deputy (McCabe) handle it.
958189234816454657 2018-01-29 04:04:50 UTC <Vva10967> @Comey This was a really bad idea.  It looks like our country may not survive it.pic.twitter.com/XCU8wLuzCr

958142264928292870 2018-01-29 00:58:12 UTC <Vva10967> @coton_luver I don't think Newt was in Congress in 2009 and it's missing Mitch.

958033828131606530 2018-01-29 17:47:18 UTC <Vva10967> @BoobPunchTina @Addoxfordms @joedrawing3 @Brian_Chovanec Dems gaining control of US House is a given. GOP Congressmen in CA, NY and NJ should ALL lose their seats due to GOP's eliminating the SALT deduction to punish blue states. It hits hard the income brackets that tend to vote Republican in these states (as in thousands of $$$ hard)
957887289555865600 2018-01-29 08:05:01 UTC <Vva10967> @JonahNRO @JustinRYoung @BarackObama @JoeNBC @YeYowYa Youre confused. What that explains is why the recovery was so slow. Mitch & Boehner were too busy blocking everything Obama proposed to make him a one term president. To hell with country, its Party First for the Republicans.

957423561576153089 2018-01-27 01:22:19 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem Sorry but I disagree. She didn't mess up. She followed the HR rules of 2008.  That's like when people accuse her of being against same-sex marriage in the 1990s. That's just the way it was. She evolved as society evolved. Nobody else is judged for their past actions like she is.
957419898417963010 2018-01-27 01:07:46 UTC <Vva10967> @ericgarland @FareedZakaria Trump is still a racist. NOTHING changes that. He is also a liar, an authoritarian and a sociopath. NOTHING changes that.  He also believes he is above the law. NOTHING changes that. Why would reading a teleprompter in Davos change our view of him???
957414484519342080 2018-01-27 00:46:15 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 The @washingtonpost headline is wrong. It's not the Classified Russia Memo that Trump wants to release but the Nunes Bullshit Memo. The Classified Russia Memo would be the one that Obama & Trump were given by the IC in January 2017 with sources & methods.
957292262949613569 2018-01-27 16:40:35 UTC <Vva10967> @RuthMarcus Your head must REALLY, REALLY, REALLY explode knowing that we have a sexual assaulter as @POTUS then! Just how infuriating do you find his denials? Surely you KNOW that a woman filed a complaint saying @realDonaldTrump raped her when she was 12 or 13 at a Jeffrey Epstein party?
957291000887742464 2018-01-27 16:35:34 UTC <Vva10967> @FLOTUS @secupp Shouldn't you be asking @Flotus Melania Trump to call Trump's 16 accusers? or is it more than 16, I can't keep track.  Including the girl who filed the lawsuit accusing Trump of raping her at a Jeffrey Epstein apartment when she was 12 or 13 years old???  #GOPisPARTYofTRUMP
957286082118406144 2018-01-27 16:16:02 UTC <Vva10967> @SenBobCasey No offense but you guys are REALLY BAD AT MESSAGING. During the shutdown Dems spoke of wanting something about Pensions, never mentioning that it was pensions for coal miners. In the meantime, the coal miners still think that Trump is their champion and that Dems are not! 
957032088355659777 2018-01-26 23:26:45 UTC <Vva10967> @marcolblackwell @KamalaHarris Dont they need 60 votes in which case Dems CAN block it?
956787000786505728 2018-01-25 07:12:51 UTC <Vva10967> @SenRonJohnson @jimsciutto Was his informant Devin Nunes??? 
956769635130515457 2018-01-25 06:03:51 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN Hey CNN, it's 2 EMPLOYEES of the @FBI, not @Comey and/or his deputy Andy McCabe, discussing the investigation.  2 REPUBLICAN EMPLOYEES who wanted JOHN KASICH to be POTUS, not Hillary, not Trump, not Sanders. Leave the Conspiracy Theories to CRAZY Fox!!!
956716156097843200 2018-01-25 02:31:21 UTC <Vva10967> @rachaelmbade Nah. The Blue Tsunami is coming regardless. They can point to the election of Donald J Trump and to their own missing backbones.
956710043839287296 2018-01-25 02:07:03 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko Although she flew to Florida today.  General Kelly also stayed behind and unlike Melania, he stayed in the White House....
956673925202808832 2018-01-25 23:43:32 UTC <Vva10967> @funder will you make the podcast available on Itunes?
956427171840561153 2018-01-24 07:23:01 UTC <Vva10967> @Montgomery_bjm @peterdaou Makes me wonder what Russia might have on Devin Nunes. They did hack the RNC servers.
956201876680335360 2018-01-24 16:27:47 UTC <Vva10967> @SenGillibrand @matthewjdowd @itsybitsydotsie @Rontildawn But she wont be. I dont see her motivating a large enough segment of the Dem base. I do like her as a Senator despite the Franken fiasco she pulled.
956082470964875264 2018-01-24 08:33:18 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias @hoosiemommy27 @sanblasena But it was the Berners that voted third party to avenge their Messiah that elected Trump. He didnt have enough voters to win without them. And it was Bernie who made them hate her, not Trump.
955944021553229825 2018-01-23 23:23:09 UTC <Vva10967> @reesetheone1 So @SenSanders was it worth it to demonize Hillary? All this suffering can be traced to your "she's corrupt" and "the election is rigged" narratives. You knew better.
955900269631549440 2018-01-23 20:29:18 UTC <Vva10967> @Slate so they should have let children with chronic conditions die??? because we all know that Mitch is a sociopath like Trump and would not have hesitated to let kids die for a good political ad.
955897346419773441 2018-01-23 20:17:41 UTC <Vva10967> @ReutersPolitics Real crime is that slow Mr. Sessions??? or are you a believer in GOP conspiracy theories? @jeffsessions
955655340225425408 2018-01-22 04:16:02 UTC <Vva10967> @MarkWarner @SenatorBurr How can Jared Kushner be receiving the Presidents Daily Briefing if he doesnt have the requisite security clearance??? Are security clearances optional now??? @KamalaHarris @AdamSchiffCA
955652018449866753 2018-01-22 04:02:51 UTC <Vva10967> @mviser Dont be so dramatic. Thats how  we ended up with Trump, because of disillusioned lefties who cant keep their eyes on the prize. Republicans on the other hand are VERY disciplined and thats how they win.
955616982514257920 2018-01-22 01:43:37 UTC <Vva10967> @patrickdmarley @mkraju It wasnt illegal. IG report already addressed that. Different rules cannot continue to be applied to @HillaryClinton because the Republicans need a distraction from the ineptitude & treason of Trump. Press needs to stop playing along.
955611634466254849 2018-01-22 01:22:22 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @TheSickness85 It helps if you actually get out and vote straight ticket for Democrats so these Senators that you are forcing to do the right thing control the Senate & House & can get the job done. The parties are NOT the same. One, GOP, is racist. The other one, Dems, cares about people.
955574984872792069 2018-01-22 22:56:44 UTC <Vva10967> @lsarsour We wouldnt be here if you Berners had fought to elect @HillaryClinton in the general election. She was the last thing standing between us and a Trump apocalypse which the 3rd party protest voters made possible. But of course chaos is good business and you are now profiting. Q
955562717795975169 2018-01-22 22:08:00 UTC <Vva10967> @T_FisherKing @HawaiiDelilah @briancheeek You did but I bet a LOT of those people marching now did not.  If there had been this much energy and outrage to PREVENT a Donald Trump presidency, we wouldn't be here.
955529045055365120 2018-01-22 19:54:11 UTC <Vva10967> Funny how the #TrumpShutdown coincided with the Women's Marches and kept the media reporting 24/7 on the #TrumpShutdown while ignoring the Marches.

955521201635577857 2018-01-22 19:23:01 UTC <Vva10967> @SHSanders45 @JoyAnnReid doesn't the ad say at the end "I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message?"
955520650621440001 2018-01-22 19:20:50 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid why do you think that is?
955513276514922496 2018-01-22 18:51:32 UTC <Vva10967> @iSheyman @MoveOn but you have to admit that Mitch is a good hostage-taker & used CHIP to get his way. There's no CHIP hostage in the next CR.  Also Dems are TERRIBLE at messaging. They need to anticipate & prep for the worst from GOP & McConnell. @TomPerez @keithellison @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi
955511634520432640 2018-01-22 18:45:00 UTC <Vva10967> @RajShah45 @juliehdavis @maddezmom @CopyDan @Vince_WF @Sheryl_Lynn_NB proves that McConnell is a good hostage taker and forced Dems to choose between CHIP and DACA.  Next time, it's just DACA, no CHIP.
955509875500601350 2018-01-22 18:38:01 UTC <Vva10967> @joannalampert1 @ChrisJZullo Actually Trump got the media to focus 24/7 on his #TrumpShutdown #GOPShutdown and ignore the Women's Marches.  Maybe that was the plan all along?
955507681955057664 2018-01-22 18:29:18 UTC <Vva10967> @tomperriello This is what the self-entitled 3rd party voters brought on our country and on the Dreamers and other immigrants. We ALL KNEW Trump was RACIST and ANTI-IMMIGRANT from the moment he launched his campaign but 3rd party voters didn't care because THEY were not on the chopping block.
955246434693144576 2018-01-21 01:11:12 UTC <Vva10967> Hey @realDonaldTrump all these people HATE YOU.  You win MOST HATED POTUS EVER. And this is just the US.  There were marches against you ALL OVER THE WORLD!!!https://twitter.com/cnni/status/954900635819872256
955211889511944192 2018-01-21 22:53:56 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias And yes, people have short memories. How else do you explain electing another Republican to the White House after the last Republican took a booming economy from his Dem predecessor & collapsed it & almost collapsed the world's economy too? And W wasn't 1/10 as stupid as Trump!
955211236957880320 2018-01-21 22:51:20 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Also, as dangerous as W was, he didn't contemplate starting a nuclear holocaust.
955210649461776384 2018-01-21 22:49:00 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias They key word is "yet".  Trump has been riding Obama's economic recovery but that is over now that he has passed his Tax Cut. I bet he collapses the American economy a lot quicker than Bush! Bush at least had semi-decent staff.  Trump is surrounded by morons like himself.
955208775870361602 2018-01-21 22:41:33 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @keithellison I think it's a calculated ploy to lower the popularity of Democrats in the 2018 Midterms because they see a Blue Tsunami coming.  The Republicans are shamelessly holding CHIP, DACA and Military Pay hostage for partisan purposes. @MilitaryTimes @votevets
955198876826431488 2018-01-21 22:02:13 UTC <Vva10967> @Maggie_Klaus And during the weekend of the Womens Marches which he knew would be large and which have gotten very little coverage from the media because theyre all busy reporting 24/7 on the shutdown.
955196933097783296 2018-01-21 21:54:30 UTC <Vva10967> @Evan_McMullin He needs to be charged with obstruction of justice.
955177944187580416 2018-01-21 20:39:02 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @MSNBC @bj141cox @barbls23 There is also a thing that they don't understand and that is that the women marching aren't marching because of them, the 4 original organizers, but in spite of them.  A lot of the marchers are people inspired by Hillary, & others are Indivisible Group & Emerge & PP etc members.
955118560858210306 2018-01-21 16:43:04 UTC <Vva10967> @AriFleischer @phwarner @josnoss Lost? You cant lose that which you never had. 
954952986115149824 2018-01-20 05:45:08 UTC <Vva10967> @DanaHoule all the a-holes who voted for Trump assumed that his anti-immigrant rhetoric would apply only to illegals and didnt think that he would target everyone who looks brown.  Trumps support for the AZ show me your papers law should have made it clear where he was heading.
954775533547671553 2018-01-20 18:00:00 UTC <Vva10967> @CREWcrew And can he go to jail for it?
954598062709788673 2018-01-19 06:14:48 UTC <Vva10967> I feel sorry for the elites at DAVOS who have to put up with so many fing morons from the US this year, starting with @realDonaldTrump https://twitter.com/alivitali/status/951552524594622466
954585743967563777 2018-01-19 05:25:51 UTC <Vva10967> @GoAngelo Why not start a petition to have Dean Baquet removed?
954581126659690496 2018-01-19 05:07:30 UTC <Vva10967> @JudgeJeanine I hope a bear eats you.
954527754778750977 2018-01-19 01:35:25 UTC <Vva10967> @SecretService there is a deranged woman in the Chappaqua NY woods who is obsessed with @HillaryClinton.  She sounds dangerous and mentally unstable.https://twitter.com/JudgeJeanine/status/954476644919578625
954519165137752066 2018-01-19 01:01:17 UTC <Vva10967> @DonaldJTrumpJr @PhilippeReines Fox is melting Don Jr.'s brain, just like it melted @realDonaldTrump's. And there wasn't much to melt in the first place! 
954516032495988737 2018-01-19 00:48:50 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @goldlawny No, that's cloture.  It takes 51 to pass a bill once it proceeds to voting. Blame is on Trump because he SAID before the cameras that he would sign ANY bipartisan bill that the Congress put before him, and then he backtracked.
954392942042669061 2018-01-19 16:39:43 UTC <Vva10967> @verrit and yet we continue fracking in the USA.
954389450129334272 2018-01-19 16:25:51 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou and MEDIA (@MSNBC @CNN @nytimes @washingtonpost @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews , @realDonaldTrump is holding the government hostage over his stupid wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for. He won't sign anything that doesn't include $20 billion for his stupid wall.  REPORT IT.
954388714641412097 2018-01-19 16:22:55 UTC <Vva10967> @DonaldJTrumpJr you should stop watching Fox News.  Look how crazy it has made your father and he probably started watching in the last 10 years. He was always an a-hole but now he's delusional (even if he can still tell rhinos, lions and camels apart )
954247100459601920 2018-01-18 07:00:12 UTC <Vva10967> @MaddowBlog @maddow @Lawrence So as the federal government shuts down, @realDonaldTrump will be hosting a mega fundraiser at Mar-A-Lago!    (mmmm, wonder if Melania will be asked about The Stormy Daniels story...)https://twitter.com/thehill/status/954196745717800961
953882993239748608 2018-01-17 06:53:22 UTC <Vva10967> @jonallendc I can. Hillarys emails!!!!
953790532270125056 2018-01-17 00:45:58 UTC <Vva10967> @brianstelter Next time can @nytimes at least ask these morons (and include in heir profiles) their age, where they get their news, their 3 favorite TV shows, & if they have ever travelled abroad.
953725397715255296 2018-01-17 20:27:08 UTC <Vva10967> @gdebenedetti She persisted in lying under oath?  
953488099031572480 2018-01-16 04:44:12 UTC <Vva10967> @kthalps @joanwalsh @TinaMorphis Sounds like Katie and @realDonaldTrump have something in common 
953460650726035456 2018-01-16 02:55:08 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost And if so, he too is an enabler as he votes with Trump despite his rhetoric.
953315060730028034 2018-01-16 17:16:36 UTC <Vva10967> @womensmarch @bust_magazine What happens to the DC March if there is a government shutdown?  Is it possible thats what Trump is trying to avoid, the embarrassment of seeing a repeat of the hundreds of thousands marching against him in 2017?
953071862602457088 2018-01-15 01:10:13 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Funny, I remember people in WI during a post-election townhall hosted by @chrislhayes saying that they wouldn't let this happen.  I don't see them coming to help any of the deported nor their US born children? 
952804039565172736 2018-01-14 07:25:59 UTC <Vva10967> @themistocles_w @jdawsey1 Were @realDonaldTrumps dentures coming off again when he said it?  
952669887251480579 2018-01-14 22:32:55 UTC <Vva10967> @CandiceAiston LOL, she sounds like a female Steve Bannon!
952664349621047296 2018-01-14 22:10:55 UTC <Vva10967> @RandPaul @MeetThePress So we shouldn't tell the Emperor that he has NO clothes???  
952664084893315072 2018-01-14 22:09:52 UTC <Vva10967> @VanJones68 lol, bet that when Trump READS his State of the Union speech off the teleprompter later this month you'll say he's back to being Presidential! But Trump has always been a racist & at 71 he ain't going to change.  p.s. telling people to vote for Jill didn't work out too well, uh?
952597955982315521 2018-01-14 17:47:05 UTC <Vva10967> @pastormarkburns @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow Did your team miss this expose that CNN did on the pastor in 2016? He owes his rise to fame to Donald Trump and was caught by CNN falsifying his resume:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbIGBCcfKZg
952412483456823296 2018-01-13 05:30:05 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko When Dems take control of the House they should subpoena the Sep 2012 to Jan 2016 emails of Trey Gowdy, Kevin McCarthy, and Jason Chaffetz that relate to Benghazi and/or to @HillaryClinton. Bet they show conspiracy. @RepCummings
952362973259096064 2018-01-13 02:13:21 UTC <Vva10967> @FranCastric1 @MSNBC Be serious, he was likely told that the Brits couldnt assure that people wouldnt throw eggs and tomatoes at his car and entourage 
952214998952108032 2018-01-13 16:25:21 UTC <Vva10967> @pastormarkburns And you should find another occupation since you've aligned yourself with Trump who stands for everything that was repugnant to Jesus Christ.
952052581764870145 2018-01-12 05:39:58 UTC <Vva10967> @livemusic4me Are you a recent viewer? Did you watch his coverage of the 2008 Dem primary? It was Misogyny 101 
951635104190861318 2018-01-11 02:01:04 UTC <Vva10967> @sundarpichai @SusanWojcicki @karaswisher @AriMelber @TheBeatWithAri I have a question for YouTube. Are there any plans for combating fake news?  Its REALLY BAD on YouTube. Do a search for Hillary Clinton and you will see an alternate universe where she is being dragged to prison.
951542358436405249 2018-01-11 19:52:31 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 Mueller also needs to investigate Giuliani, Jim Kallstrom and the NY FBI Office.
951538009853349888 2018-01-11 19:35:14 UTC <Vva10967> @joncoopertweets Do you think that person that you spoke to will be called by Mueller's team to testify? ie. is he high enough in the totem pole to be called in?
951537184691060737 2018-01-11 19:31:58 UTC <Vva10967> @CNNPolitics Good thing @realDonaldTrump is working on fixing those libel laws to make it easier to sue POS like Joe Arpaio AND @realDonaldTrump himself. @HillaryClinton should become a billionaire suing Trump for all the times he has falsely called her "Crooked"!
951535582408314880 2018-01-11 19:25:36 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald You would think that they are required to file WARN notices with the Federal government, no?
951535013077676035 2018-01-11 19:23:20 UTC <Vva10967> This Thread shows that @realDonaldTrump is always reacting to the news he gets on TV.  The Right made their Crazy Fox-Watching Uncle POTUS!!!https://twitter.com/MattGertz/status/951108342205878272
951520927820472320 2018-01-11 18:27:22 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert But I don't think they (coal miners) have turned on Trump yet. Reality hasn't hit them yet. Or they refuse to believe they were conned.
951498625783336960 2018-01-11 16:58:45 UTC <Vva10967> @jodikantor @JaneSlavin Bill's and Monica's was a consensual affair. That has never been in dispute.
951498317036441600 2018-01-11 16:57:31 UTC <Vva10967> @jodikantor @mondiani @AditiJuneja3 only because there are too many of them to be able to remember their names.  If Congress had impeached Trump over the 20+ sexual assault allegations from those women as they did with with Clinton over the consensual affair he had with Monika Lewinski, we would ALL know the names.
951497166987649031 2018-01-11 16:52:57 UTC <Vva10967> @jodikantor The only victim of "the Bill Clinton scandal" was @HillaryClinton.  Bill's and Monica's was a CONSENSUAL affair.  You're doing false equivalencies, typical of the @nytimes. Do you have to be a Clinton hater to work there?
951345884121522176 2018-01-10 06:51:48 UTC <Vva10967> @sarahkendzior I was blocked by Univision's Jorge Ramos for telling him that the false equivalencies he kept creating in his Sunday show between @HillaryClinton and Trump would get Trump elected. And I was right.
951342877149409280 2018-01-10 06:39:51 UTC <Vva10967> @sarahkendzior I was blocked by Jake Tapper for calling him out after he and other CNN anchors ran @HillaryClinton Uranium One stories on Oct 27 2017 in response to a Trump tweet that ordered the media to do it.
951285270686633988 2018-01-10 02:50:57 UTC <Vva10967> @charlesbethea and the local press didn't do much diligence on Trump either? it's no secret that FOR DECADES Trump has been a con artist, been anti-union in his hotels, cheated contractors, filed 4 bankruptcy multiple times, used Chinese steel for his buildings & made his clothes lines in China
951276865716662272 2018-01-10 02:17:33 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC What are YOU smoking?  What achievements???  A tax scam bill that will cost GOP the House, tank the economy that Obama fixed, bring on another Great Recession and bankrupt us?  A Puerto Rico left in the dark that will cost GOP Florida?  #BlueWave
951139288925790209 2018-01-10 17:10:52 UTC <Vva10967> @GoAngelo But Bannon deserved it.  He and the Mercers financed the Clinton Cash book & movie that slanders the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation #karma
950772991788568576 2018-01-09 16:55:20 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump learning the words to the National Anthem would be a good start for you, no?   Or maybe you knew the words and you forgot them because you do have Alzheimer's? Your dad had it, and it runs in families. Prove you don't have it by taking a mental exam & releasing the results!
950771535442259968 2018-01-09 16:49:33 UTC <Vva10967> @TomArnold But I bet she didn't have Alzheimer's...... Trump was always an a-hole, but what he has now is dementia and it runs in his family.
950590582765838336 2018-01-08 04:50:30 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Or he doesnt REMEMBER the words because he has Alzheimers?
950501434025488384 2018-01-08 22:56:15 UTC <Vva10967> @POTUS @CharlesMBlow @cbeilinson @LuBonLez @_Seedsy_ @JudyWhaleCove @MichelleMarched We don't choose the GOP Candidates. The GOP idiots do.  And OUR candidates end up having to clean up the mess the GOP Presidents leave behind. And the 2020 Democratic POTUS will have the most cleaning up to do of any POTUS ever. A Great Depression, maybe even a nuclear holocaust.
950457921703497728 2018-01-08 20:03:21 UTC <Vva10967> @jonallendc Maybe you should write a book exploring and explaining what has caused the dumbing down of America and how that is holding us back? Its really really bad.
950402235200090113 2018-01-08 16:22:05 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs And that is why this great nation of ours, the United States of America, will never fulfill its potential.  Because we don't value knowledge, intelligence or experience. W connected with voters, look where that got us.
950268921713713152 2018-01-07 07:32:20 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs @EvanHandler @robertdsheridan Americans are soooo bad at learning anything from history! Obamas decision to pull Dem Senators and Governors into his Cabinet allowed the GOP to fill those seats with Republicans and now were screwed and extremely close to GOP being able to amend the US Constitution.
950190148758786048 2018-01-07 02:19:19 UTC <Vva10967> @Kasparov63 The Democratic Party is not broken. The 2 parties are NOT the same. Demagogues say they are to fundraise for their own benefit eg Our Revolution, but that doesnt make their claims true. The perpetuation of that LIE made Trump POTUS.  He couldnt have won without 3rd party votes.
950188988333219842 2018-01-07 02:14:43 UTC <Vva10967> @Kasparov63 How long have you lived here and you still dont fully grasp the racism, xenophobia, sexism and misogyny that are still prevalent in rural areas and in red states or the brainwashing of old people that Fox has been carrying out for the past 20 years?
949545196651499520 2018-01-05 07:36:31 UTC <Vva10967> @runforsomething @AndrewPaulJoyce @alexkotch @kgoebel The Trump Tax Scam could do the trick. It really raises taxes on CA NY and NJ.
949465537414946816 2018-01-05 02:19:58 UTC <Vva10967> @runforsomething @AndrewPaulJoyce @alexkotch @kgoebel yeah but in CA, if you manage to get 2 Democrats in the top 2 spots, the Republican is left out of the general.
949461363864293377 2018-01-05 02:03:23 UTC <Vva10967> @PreetBharara but it won't happen until we flip the House in November.  GOP is treasonous and will protect Trump over country. e.g. Nunes, Ryan, Grassley, Graham.
949459752337240064 2018-01-05 01:56:59 UTC <Vva10967> @POTUS @davidaxelrod Yeah but the same is true of the GOP Congressmen and Senators and look how THAT has turned out! All #TreasonousGOP
949452386459963392 2018-01-05 01:27:43 UTC <Vva10967> @davidfrum Its not the system of power but the Republican Party that is enabling Trump. #TreasonousGOP
949362044494598145 2018-01-05 19:28:44 UTC <Vva10967> @GovHowardDean what about treasonous @ChuckGrassley and @LindseyGrahamSC who just referred Christopher Steele for criminal investigation to DOJ? The ENTIRE @GOP is betraying their oaths to defend the US Constitution and have become the Party of Trump. #VoteGOPOut #TreasonousGOP
949358160011284480 2018-01-05 19:13:18 UTC <Vva10967> #GOPCorruption #GOPTreason How can any patriotic American still support the GOP?https://twitter.com/newtgingrich/status/948719733918101504
949356503462502401 2018-01-05 19:06:43 UTC <Vva10967> @Comey @benjaminwittes Do you think US Democracy survives a deranged POTUS, a treasonous @GOP, a treasonous @ChuckGrassley, a treasonous @LindseyGrahamSC, a corrupt AG Jeff Sessions & a corrupt Arkansas DOJ appointee? Seems we are heading Russia's & Putin's way. #HowUSDemocracyDied #Oct282016
949352680778010624 2018-01-05 18:51:31 UTC <Vva10967> So what exactly does Russia have on Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham? Remember that Russia hacked the RNC servers but didn't put contents on Wikileaks.https://nyti.ms/2F3GEUC
949336944273690624 2018-01-05 17:48:59 UTC <Vva10967> @timkaine I'm sure Dems will stand up to Trump.  Republicans on the other hand have proven that they will not.  What happens if he nukes millions?  War Crime?
949328668341555212 2018-01-05 17:16:06 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews @marebytes hey idiot, the US Government PROMOTES the sale of arms to other countries. It's part of its job, to promote US MANUFACTURING.  We manufacture weapons. e.g. Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, L3, etc.
949170370300596224 2018-01-04 06:47:05 UTC <Vva10967> @AlexMohajer Did @FoxNews not get an advanced copy of Fire and Fury?  
949167382685241344 2018-01-04 06:35:13 UTC <Vva10967> @SunflowerSoul71 @HRCpersists I think how much damage Trump does to our economy, institutions and standing in the world between now & 2020 & what Mueller uncovers about Trumps & others 2016 collusion w Russia will determine who the nominee will be in 2020. Its too early to tell.
949045685118226433 2018-01-04 22:31:38 UTC <Vva10967> @robertcaruso Who is going to finance him? For years it has been the Mercers and theyre apparently divorcing him. Maybe he takes revenge instead and tells Mueller how Jared, Don Jr, Brad Parscale and Cambridge Analytica collaborated with Russian hackers and bots.
948999542271303681 2018-01-04 19:28:17 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT Its not. It was never a big deal except to the media who never understood it and blew it out of proportion. Just like Benghazi. No crime was committed and investigating it 30x wont change outcome only waste money.
948753177402400769 2018-01-03 03:09:19 UTC <Vva10967> @KimStrassel Or there is someone else higher up in the food chain /Trump campaign who also said too much to our allies.
948733113466748929 2018-01-03 01:49:35 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @RepSwalwell @emmajaniejones Bernie did.  And Jill Stein did.
948719743422418949 2018-01-03 00:56:27 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod As can the people who vote 3rd Party. Trump didnt have enough voters to elect him POTUS. The Far Left made him POTUS with their 3rd Party votes in the swing States. Numbers dont lie.
948646146335039490 2018-01-03 20:04:00 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines lol, apparently Bannon is now a "staffer" -- not sure if that is above or below "coffee boy".  
948644573148049409 2018-01-03 19:57:45 UTC <Vva10967> @NatashaBertrand So, is staffer above or below "coffee boy"??? 
948439011542134784 2018-01-02 06:20:56 UTC <Vva10967> @Scout_Finch New Jersey is closer and bluer and not as freaking cold as MN. @HillaryClinton could easily beat Senator Bob Menendez who is up for re-election in 2018 if she wanted to join the Senate again...
948384278294953985 2018-01-02 02:43:26 UTC <Vva10967> @jdawsey1 No idiot. She had 3 SCIFs AND a CLASSIFIED GOVERNMENT account for communications LABELED CLASSIFIED. The Media was too inept to ever explain that the private server handled her NON-Classified communications, like discussions about front page NYT stories which is what Comey found.
948381911344402433 2018-01-02 02:34:02 UTC <Vva10967> @PragmaticObot The 3rd party voters in the swing states made him POTUS.  He didn't have enough voters of his own to win.  So here we are stuck with him for the foreseeable future since GOP won't remove him no matter how insane he is.
948237561666916353 2018-01-02 17:00:26 UTC <Vva10967> @Comey, still no regrets? you unleashed a madman on our country and the Republicans in Congress refuse to stop him.  BUT HER EMAILS!!!!! #Javerthttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948174033882927104
947892749654806528 2018-01-01 18:10:17 UTC <Vva10967> @peterbakernyt @neeratanden LOL, Peter knew that his Dec 31 piece was even worse and would be published only 2 days after that awful "interview"  As they say in reality television these days: SAD!https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/us/politics/trump-reinventing-presidency.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur
947889257259110402 2018-01-01 17:56:24 UTC <Vva10967> @SpeakerRyan Yeah, specially Americans living in CA, NY & NJ in the income brackets that typically vote Republican who will see their taxes rise by several thousand dollars thanks to the GOP Tax Scam.  The GOP said FU to the Blue States in 2017, and in 2018 the Blue States get to say FU back!
947888114592309248 2018-01-01 17:51:52 UTC <Vva10967> @mikefarb1 @ilovelightning No offense but you're guessing. I want to know for sure from a cyber security expert.
947880420934324224 2018-01-01 17:21:17 UTC <Vva10967> @TiffanyATrump @EricTrump @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @pastormarkburns You mean hiring nannies to help your wife and ex-wives raise them is YOUR standard for being a "REAL" father? Barack Obama was 1000X more real father to his girls and I never heard you praise him?
947879656153403392 2018-01-01 17:18:15 UTC <Vva10967> @Newsweek News organizations need to stop referring to Trump as the leader of the free world. That has been Angela Merkel since January 20, 2017.  Trump is just the US President.
947710301285376000 2017-12-31 06:05:18 UTC <Vva10967> @NBCNews Wheres the ball??
947709779664887808 2017-12-31 06:03:13 UTC <Vva10967> @RWPUSA Richard you and @ananavarro should both join the Democratic Party. The Republicans party that you remember no longer exists.
947604928763191296 2017-12-31 23:06:35 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes Dear New York Times and Peter Baker: You, like Trump, keep sinking lower. You're really making me think that I should NOT renew my subscription when it comes due in 2 months. If I wanted to read a pro-Trump tabloid, I would subscribe to the @WSJ.
947518058939207682 2017-12-31 17:21:23 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes can we get an explanation? if not, @washingtonpost can you investigate and let the public know how such egregious mistake was made?https://twitter.com/SusaMorgan/status/947240473470443520
947515783227297792 2017-12-31 17:12:21 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump They would be the same, likely higher. You have been riding the Obama economy. YOUR economy starts Jan 1, 2018, with the effects of YOUR tax bill on the economy and on domestic growth and increased deficits and HUGE ADDITIONAL debt.
947362234082254849 2017-12-30 07:02:12 UTC <Vva10967> @ebruenig @PhilippeReines Others have been fired for less. Showed extremely poor judgment. They should be fired. Freedom of speech doesnt mean that your actions will have no consequences, only that the government cant come after you for what you say.
947247620174385152 2017-12-30 23:26:46 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @SenSanders @DNC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @keltickaty @urmadz @drdiegomyego @Cliff_M85 @JSException I remember watching Chuck Grassley tell voters in IA that Obamacare had a death panel in it & that it pulled the plug on grandma!  And NO ONE called him on it, not the media, not Obama, not his fellow Senators. NOBODY. And that POS is still in the Senate trying to stop Mueller.
947246645707771904 2017-12-30 23:22:53 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @SenSanders @DNC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @keltickaty @urmadz @drdiegomyego @Cliff_M85 @JSException Until recently the Left's answer to the Right Wing propaganda has been to ignore it and that obviously hasn't worked. We allowed Hillary to be labelled flawed over a stupid server where she was discussing how to respond to questions about a front page NYT Story on CIA drones.
947246079195664385 2017-12-30 23:20:38 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @SenSanders @DNC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @keltickaty @urmadz @drdiegomyego @Cliff_M85 @JSException Yeah, I agree that we didn't do enough to contain the right wing propaganda or to defend Hillary.  Even Obama didn't do enough to defend himself from the right wing lies about Obamacare that lost us the House in 2010 and brought the implementation of his agenda to a virtual halt.
947244918908612609 2017-12-30 23:16:02 UTC <Vva10967> @Millennial_Dems @KaivanShroff @glendablue And her Joining Forces initiative was discontinued by Trump, you know, the guy who "loves the troops" Unfortunately Obama allowed Fox News to play in military bases and that probably accounts for why any military service person would vote for Trump or the GOP.
947244257055854592 2017-12-30 23:13:24 UTC <Vva10967> @Millennial_Dems @KaivanShroff @glendablue The Media also ignored Michelle's Reach Higher initiative launched in 2014 to encourage every student in America to pursue higher education and her Let Girls Learn initiative launched in 2015 to help adolescent girls worldwide obtain a quality education.
947243477171097600 2017-12-30 23:10:18 UTC <Vva10967> @Millennial_Dems @KaivanShroff @glendablue Basically the media focused on Michelle's Lets Move initiative (exercise) and her Partnership for a Healthier America (healthier meals for kids).  It ignored her Joining Forces initiative where she mobilized corporate America to retrain, recruit and hire returning military.
947242041863495685 2017-12-30 23:04:36 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @SenSanders @DNC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @keltickaty @urmadz @drdiegomyego @Cliff_M85 @JSException Yeah, just like those who didn't stop Hitler in Germany. They too were as responsible as Hitler for the millions he murdered. Trump is no different. You all knew that he was deranged and full of hate.  It's not like he hid it during the campaign.
947240993883123712 2017-12-30 23:00:26 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @SenSanders @DNC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @keltickaty @JSException @urmadz @drdiegomyego then YOU @Cliff_M85 are 1 of the 7MM RESPONSIBLE for EVERYTHING that Trump brings along. YOU KNEW BETTER. And made it about YOU. Let's hope he doesn't nuke millions, because he CAN and has never had any morals or empathy.  I find 3rd party voters like you REPULSIVE to be honest.
946993534808272896 2017-12-29 06:37:07 UTC <Vva10967> @Millennial_Dems @KaivanShroff @glendablue Actually she did a lot for the troops, and for getting kids to go on to higher education. Its more that the media chose to focus on her Lets Move and her Healthy Meals initiatives.
946991611745054720 2017-12-29 06:29:29 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @SenSanders @DNC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @keltickaty @JSException @urmadz @drdiegomyego @Cliff_M85 Actually you Berners made Trumps presidency possible with your 3rd Party votes. He didnt have enough voters to win. Had the Left united to defeat him we would have a great POTUS, a competent Cabinet, criminal justice reform, DACA, left leaning judges filling court vacancies etc
946958931343101952 2017-12-29 04:19:37 UTC <Vva10967> @JoeNBC No, "Congress" has not been heartless towards our American brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico. REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS AND TRUMP have.  STOP THE FALSE EQUIVALENCIES. THE PARTIES ARE NOT THE SAME.
946885851254087680 2017-12-29 23:29:13 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko and they (NYT & WaPo) never clarified that Clinton Cash was financed by Steve Bannon & the Mercers. Hillary should have sued Peter Schweizer and Fox.
946644562335977472 2017-12-28 07:30:26 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @nytmike Its not the Russian inquiry, its him that makes us look bad. He would know if he flipped the channel to anything other than Fox. He is living in a Fox propaganda bubble.
946511810034851841 2017-12-28 22:42:55 UTC <Vva10967> @https @davidaxelrod This assumes his followers made him POTUS and that is NOT true. It was the BernieBros & Bernettes voting 3rd Party in the swing states to avenge their Messiah that made Trumps Presidency possible. Had the Left united to stop him, @HillaryClinton would be POTUS.
946295430568120320 2017-12-28 08:23:06 UTC <Vva10967> @renato_mariotti Tried??? How do you know they didnt succeed ? DHS assumes the voting machines werent penetrated but hasnt examined any to be sure. Its like they dont want to know.
945776222881148928 2017-12-26 21:59:57 UTC <Vva10967> @KatyTurNBC Not really. The people who made Trumps POTUS were the BernieBros and Bernettes who voted 3rd party in the swing states to make @HillaryClinton pay for having defeated their Messiah in the primary. He didnt have enough voters to get elected.
945775513418813440 2017-12-26 21:57:08 UTC <Vva10967> @NatashaBertrand Do all these Republican old geezers have dementia? Is it exacerbated by watching Fox all day? Sure seems so!
945107000387604480 2017-12-24 01:40:42 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump That's Obama's legacy.  Yours started when you signed the Trump Tax Scam.  If and when it tanks the economy you inherited from Obama, it's on you. And you can't declare bankruptcy like you did with your private businesses.
945030981202915329 2017-12-24 20:38:38 UTC <Vva10967> @ByronJohnson32 @Amy_Siskind @savannastc Theyre still not good at playing the political theater and speaking with one voice and staying on message.
945030615979741185 2017-12-24 20:37:11 UTC <Vva10967> @ByronJohnson32 @Amy_Siskind @savannastc They could play hardball and call out the treason by Trump & by their Republican colleagues. They still speak of bipartisanship after Mitch stole Obamas SCOTUS seat and told them to fuck off in drafting the Trump Tax Scam.
945029346330316800 2017-12-24 20:32:08 UTC <Vva10967> @benjaminwittes @Jinxy_Minxy @KathyMBI @mzjkbee Its white resentment and misogyny that drives them. Their hate of Obama and Hillary, of immigrants, of blacks, of Muslims, and of a world that is now accepting of LGBT people.
945028619029630976 2017-12-24 20:29:15 UTC <Vva10967> @benjaminwittes @Jinxy_Minxy @KathyMBI Or the help of the 7 million who voted third party particularly in the swing states.
944996811382706176 2017-12-24 18:22:51 UTC <Vva10967> @JeffFlake your votes prove that YOU ARE WITH TRUMP. You've ENABLED HIM. You voted FOR repealing Obamacare and kicking off MILLIONS of Americans off healthcare. You voted FOR the Trump Tax Scam. You voted to confirm Trump's unqualified nominees to the Cabinet & to the Judiciary.https://twitter.com/SocialPowerOne1/status/944969758952312832
944979576597417984 2017-12-24 17:14:22 UTC <Vva10967> @BarackObama @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SubodhChandra @linda_lindylou @NativeTexan74 @billyjoecain No, Dem policies are in the right place & the parties are NOT the same.  Problem is Dems allow demagogues to trash them for their own political gain. They lost the 1000 seats because Obama was too busy saving the economy to pay attention to the GOP's RedState Project.
944966646346780672 2017-12-24 16:22:59 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Because they are not. You didnt have enough voters to make you POTUS. @SenSanders followers made you POTUS by voting third party in the swing states to punish @HillaryClinton for defeating their hero in the primary.
944935634896113664 2017-12-24 14:19:46 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh Im going to miss your conversations with @JoyAnnReid on @amjoyshow. @MSNBC should have cancelled @hughhewitt instead. When will they understand that if we wanted right wing propaganda we would watch Faux instead? 
944251613119643648 2017-12-22 17:01:42 UTC <Vva10967> @marcorubio mmmm, that's your ENTIRE PARTY, the party formerly known as the Republican Party, now the Party of Trump.
944250587968888832 2017-12-22 16:57:38 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @cenkuygur and @mtaibbi could have been twins in 2000! Their writings are indistinguishable. They were male chauvinist Aholes then and were male chauvinist Aholes during the 2016 election.  They too bear responsibility for Trump, who is an older version of them.
944246320122023936 2017-12-22 16:40:40 UTC <Vva10967> That's what happens when you back a racist conman.https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/944198851690409984
944245656071307266 2017-12-22 16:38:02 UTC <Vva10967> @NYGovCuomo @tomholmes2016 @Hershell_Bryant @DickyMcgeesacks No they don't. They allow free-loaders to choose the party's nominee and to hijack the nomination, like it happened with Sheriff Clarke in WI. You can still vote in the general. If you want to vote in the primary, NOTHING prevents you from joining a party, it's free. Your choice.
944244759039827968 2017-12-22 16:34:28 UTC <Vva10967> @NYGovCuomo @tomholmes2016 They're disenfranchised by choice.  It doesn't cost anything to register as a Republican or as a Democrat.
944096837740396544 2017-12-21 06:46:41 UTC <Vva10967> @mrsmaris Sirota has been a Hillary hater for far longer than that.
944094333388681216 2017-12-21 06:36:44 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @pastormarkburns Pastor I have to assume you are an atheist because you have no fear of burning in Hell for all eternity when you die. And unlike Trump YOU have read the Bible!
944089461712982018 2017-12-21 06:17:22 UTC <Vva10967> @BarackObama @ValerieJarrett @VanJones68 And @HillaryClinton as POTUS could have continued Obamas work and enacted criminal justice reform but too many on the Far Left were more interested in bringing her down & making her pay for defeating Bernie and elected Trump with their 3rd Party votes in the swing states.
944087908801220609 2017-12-21 06:11:12 UTC <Vva10967> @PreetBharara can Nunes be charged with obstruction of justice?https://twitter.com/tburages/status/944065180098539520
944082961074458624 2017-12-21 05:51:32 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines Yet she could have stopped Comey after his July 5 press conf and/or  before his Oct 28th letter and didnt. Now we have Trump.  Im pretty sure Holder would have stopped him.
944062841388232704 2017-12-21 04:31:35 UTC <Vva10967> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson JFC. Are all Republicans stupid morons like @realDonaldTrump??? Has anyone told you that Russia sells us Uranium because we dont have enough deposits in the US and that it is used to power nuclear ENERGY plants that make electricity and not bombs??? 
944058021017280513 2017-12-21 04:12:26 UTC <Vva10967> @Acosta Do they realize they just took Christ out of Christmas??? 
943742209828032512 2017-12-20 07:17:31 UTC <Vva10967> @TheDemocrats @Lawrence @BCFoltz @JoyAnnReid @nunya_binnis @jimjamescomey The GOP will also likely try to privatize the VA in 2019 which wont go over well with vets. Trumps undiagnosed Alzheimers will get worse. The rural states will see their economies suffer come Jan 1st 2018 when Mexico stops buying its corn wheat and soy from the US. Not good.
943740419413889024 2017-12-20 07:10:24 UTC <Vva10967> @TheDemocrats @Lawrence @BCFoltz @JoyAnnReid @nunya_binnis @jimjamescomey By 2019 his support should be in the 20s and if Dems control both Houses of Congress they can reign him in. The sequester cuts to Medicare and Medicaid will have kicked in, there is no money left for infrastructure & the deficit will have ballooned because trickle down is a myth.
943737634534412288 2017-12-20 06:59:20 UTC <Vva10967> @Lawrence @JoyAnnReid @tizlock @Kjerstieb They internalized the philosophy of Ayn Rand and never outgrew it.
943736874220343302 2017-12-20 06:56:19 UTC <Vva10967> @TheDemocrats @Lawrence @BCFoltz @JoyAnnReid @nunya_binnis @jimjamescomey However Dems wont have veto proof majorities, at least not in the Senate even with a blue wave, so unless both Trump and Pence get impeached for collusion with Russia in 2019, the earliest the Trump Tax Scam can be repealed and replaced is 2021.
943694589717725184 2017-12-20 04:08:17 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @BobKerns Which is why we need to get control of the Senate in 2018 as well. AZ will have 2 seats open. In NV Heller is a goner, NE will be very unhappy with its economy come Jan 1st when Mexico stops buying its corn & other crops & TN and TX could turn into the next AL.
943630500257849344 2017-12-20 23:53:37 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @BobKerns No. The Speaker will not be a Republican in 2019.
943613843875430402 2017-12-20 22:47:26 UTC <Vva10967> @johnastoehr On what theory do you know?
943554391969353729 2017-12-20 18:51:12 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes @SpryGuy You're generalizing. Not all private schools are religious and most do a good job educating their students in math and science and civics. If you had to ban something for the good of the country it should be Citizens United and the Republican Party.
943549512261472256 2017-12-20 18:31:48 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @BobKerns it will, if it happens in 2019 and Pence goes down with Trump too.
943548835019874307 2017-12-20 18:29:07 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes @SpryGuy No, that's extreme. They simply should not be subsidized by taxpayers.
943543147132522496 2017-12-20 18:06:31 UTC <Vva10967>  The terrifying Trump robot, but with his actual speeches dubbed over ithttps://twitter.com/i/moments/943263153181179904
943396688919781376 2017-12-20 08:24:32 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill That must be why @HillaryClinton sells out every event she speaks at and gets standing ovations everywhere she goes & why thousands choose to wait in line for hours in the cold  just to say say hi to her & get their books signed. 
943394322480881666 2017-12-20 08:15:08 UTC <Vva10967> @RevDrBarber @RobinCook @RileyRae58 @JuneBuggieRants With all due respect this nonsense that the parties are the same and the purity tests are what put the GOP in charge and made Trump POTUS. God knows how much of their damage to our country well be able to reverse.
943382507348811777 2017-12-19 07:28:11 UTC <Vva10967> @RepBobGibbs You'll tank the economy and bring us another Great Depression, but hey, YOUR donors, the Kochs and the Mercers, are happy.  They got THEIR Return On Invesment.
943379822335623168 2017-12-19 07:17:31 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein @joshfoxfilm @QuinnsHere @SarcasmStardust Yet YOU enabled Trump by not voting or by voting 3rd party. The choice was always binary.  If you didn't vote for Hillary YOU directly or indirectly made Trump POTUS. WHAT DO YOU THINK HE IS DOING IN THE MIDDLE EAST? He is KILLING THOUSANDS of civilians. Because he's a SOCIOPATH.
943021621916336128 2017-12-18 07:34:09 UTC <Vva10967> @Amy_Siskind @MeganSutherlin @JW4Resistance @fotoeffex @MadmanIke @yesimrite Trump is a con artist.  Always has been, always will be. His fellow New Yorkers know him well and hate him. They also know his opponent @HillaryClinton well and voted overwhelmingly for her. She would have been a great POTUS.
942939462178353158 2017-12-18 02:07:41 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill At least the Speaker will be a Democrat when Trump & Pence get impeached.  And that's the only way the House impeaches Trump. GOP continues to put Party over Country. #TreasonousGOP (Dems should make HRC Speaker in 2019. She's our legit POTUS )
942937550834069504 2017-12-18 02:00:05 UTC <Vva10967> @TheRichWilkins No, that was Bernie who convinced his young followers that Hillary was a "corporate whore" and that the primary was "rigged". Trump took Bernie's words and used them against Hillary. She lost by 78,000 votes in 3 states, 3rd party idiots who wanted her 2 pay for defeating Bernie.
942935082255478784 2017-12-18 01:50:17 UTC <Vva10967> @TVietor08 The Karma is strong with @HillaryClinton.  She didn't deserve any of what was done to her to derail her presidency.
942871286182825984 2017-12-18 21:36:46 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @Acosta it also doesn't mention that Trump's budget CUTS Amtrak's budget to fix those tracks.
942841851110883329 2017-12-18 19:39:49 UTC <Vva10967> @SpeakerRyan @SenBobCorker @ajmeader @davidsirota A senile @OrrinHatch wrote that complicated provision??? His staff have to tell him where he is, what day it is and what time it is. 
942838713175986177 2017-12-18 19:27:20 UTC <Vva10967> @BillKristol Dont give him any ideas!
942838116624330752 2017-12-18 19:24:58 UTC <Vva10967> @Acosta Because @realDonaldTrump is a sociopath.
942833254155120640 2017-12-18 19:05:39 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Your Tax Scam assures that there will be NO MONEY left for infrastructure. Do you plan to put another trillion dollar on the credit card?
942641523119808512 2017-12-17 06:23:47 UTC <Vva10967> @TomPerez @amjoyshow You also need to combat the nonsense fed by Bernie to Millenials to push HIS agenda & fundraise for Our Revolution that the 2 parties are the same. They're NOT. It's a LIE. Call it out. One (the Dem Party) cares & protects, the other (GOP) is greedy & serves only the top 1%.
942638763037155333 2017-12-17 06:12:49 UTC <Vva10967> @TomPerez @amjoyshow Also, push should be to make ALL states hold PRIMARIES, not caucuses & count PRIMARY if they hold both eg. WA. And why penalize blue states like NY for having closed primaries when NY DETERMINES if the Democratic nominee for POTUS becomes POTUS or not? Dems cant reach 270 w/o NY.
942637593870635008 2017-12-17 06:08:10 UTC <Vva10967> @TomPerez @amjoyshow If non-Democrats are going to be allowed to choose OUR nominees, what is the point of joining the party? I can have my cake and eat it too under the Unity's proposals. Nothing in Life is Free. When you make it free, it is not valued.
942535468155064321 2017-12-17 23:22:21 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilipRucker Was the tip the name of a CIA spy at the Kremlin?
942231358503641088 2017-12-16 03:13:56 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @SteveKornacki @amjoyshow I would bet that EVERY GOP seat in CA, NY & NJ will flip in 2018 if the GOP Tax Scam becomes law. The income brackets that vote Republican in those states WILL get a SIGNIFICANT TAX INCREASE with the repeal of the State Tax Deduction & the income limit'n on the Healthcare Ded'n.
942230994953883648 2017-12-16 03:12:29 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump: look, youre the most hated POTUS ever!https://twitter.com/rawstory/status/942207745222115333

942115207408685056 2017-12-16 19:32:23 UTC <Vva10967> @AndyRichter @CNN and the MSM don't want to acknowledge the role THEY played in making Trump POTUS. They also don't want to acknowledge that 62MM people voted for a racist & sexual predator, either because they shared his views or because they lacked morals to care about his views.
942114102121582592 2017-12-16 19:28:00 UTC <Vva10967> @tribelaw You're assuming it's insecurity. What if it's guilt? What if the Steele Dossier is true? How do you explain that Trump didn't lose his wealth in the 1990s after all his businesses went belly up or even in the 2008 financial crisis when he was heavily invested in mortgages and RE?
942112920221245440 2017-12-16 19:23:18 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @marceelias do you think it's possible to get (via FOIA) the emails of the NY FBI agents working on the Weiner case and/or of the IC IG related to his decision to refer the emails matter to the FBI? All these should show a bias against @HillaryClinton .https://twitter.com/JohnCornyn/status/942055255516344320
941914578153279488 2017-12-15 06:15:10 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Which is why the Trump Tax Scam is a recipe for a Great Depression. He is increasing taxes on the people in the states responsible for 2/3 of our countrys GDP.
941913197451337729 2017-12-15 06:09:40 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Most people dont know about his women fantasize about being raped by 3 men essay or about the one where he says they get cancer due to lack of orgasms or that children should touch each others genitalia.
941908991013203969 2017-12-15 05:52:57 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @CWayneBull @susi_debra @hdot42 We can stop Trump by taking the House and Senate in 2018 and the GOP as a whole by taking the governorships and legislatures too. 2018 is a huge election year.
941864857351131136 2017-12-15 02:57:35 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines lol, whenever I see "Slanders" my mind jumps to Bernie Slanders and all the lies he told his followers about Hillary. His lies are the reason we have Trump in the White House.
941861877528846336 2017-12-15 02:45:45 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko Karma is a bitch. The @NewYorkFBI and @JamesComeyFBI made @realDonaldTrump POTUS & now he is turning on them.  @HillaryClinton could have gone after the @FBI after Comey violated every DOJ rule during his July 5th press conference but didn't because she respects the institution.
941401215535108096 2017-12-14 20:15:14 UTC <Vva10967> @AjitPaiFCC seems that your staff needs a shakeup... badly.https://twitter.com/juddlegum/status/941354380049223681
941354049286426624 2017-12-14 17:07:49 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko I know @HillaryClinton is not litigious but Tom Fitton and Judicial Watch have been harrassing the Clintons for over 20 years, non-stop, I think it'd money well spent to sue them for damages and for an injunction to cease and desist. Fitton's fixation with HRC crosses the line.
941351687931006977 2017-12-14 16:58:26 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko I don't buy it. I think he knows he colluded with Russia and that the claims in the Steele Dossier ARE true. The press is very afraid to go there and entertain the notion that he committed TREASON.
941350796591075330 2017-12-14 16:54:54 UTC <Vva10967> @NewYorkFBI this didn't turn out too well, uh?  President @HillaryClinton would never in a million years have gone after the @FBI because unlike Trump she respects the law. @JamesComeyFBI I have to wonder if the nation will survive the consequences of your Oct 28 letter.https://twitter.com/RVAwonk/status/941191170180501504
941060660284350464 2017-12-13 21:42:00 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald You expect the man who stole Obamas SCOTUS appointment because he could and lowered the vote required to confirm SCOTUS justices to 51 to get Gorsuch in to do the right thing now?  @SenMajLdr has shown us who he is. We should believe him.
940833315237527552 2017-12-12 06:38:36 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @Alfree7619 Actually she was in Portland, OR, on her book tour before a crowd of cheering fans. So even better.
940457155848736768 2017-12-11 05:43:53 UTC <Vva10967> @yottapoint Good thing Karma hit @RyanLizza
940108173066821632 2017-12-10 06:37:09 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @VABVOX Only if Dems control both The House and Senate after 2018. Otherwise GOP will do a repeat of their fake outrage and abusive investigations into her emails, server and Benghazi to bring her down.
939944000974475270 2017-12-10 19:44:47 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @TheDemocrats @AlasscanIsBack @OHenryHernandez Also Chuck Todds wife worked for Bernies campaign & got paid over $1.34 million.
939943392821350400 2017-12-10 19:42:22 UTC <Vva10967> @TheDemocrats @AlasscanIsBack @OHenryHernandez Its not the Democrats, its the media, the male pundits in the MSM to be exact. Have to wonder about Chuck Todd. He fits the profile of Matt Lauer, Mark Halperin, Charlie Rose, Glenn Thrush etc who were misogynist to @HillaryClinton & had skeletons in their closets.
939772338291331073 2017-12-10 08:22:40 UTC <Vva10967> @Zebop Lets keep it that way. Bernie is the kiss of death for the candidacies if the people he endorses. 
939044195062267905 2017-12-08 08:09:17 UTC <Vva10967> @GOP @Remy_Anne Maybe hes hoping that Putin will order his hackers to hack the voting machines in Alabama?
939040268812107778 2017-12-07 07:53:41 UTC <Vva10967> @PressSec @ElizLanders Good for @repjohnlewis who has called from the beginning Trumps illegitimacy as POTUS.
938628229363052544 2017-12-06 04:36:23 UTC <Vva10967> @alfranken Do NOT resign.  We need you. And this has Roger Stone written ALL OVER IT.  Media & Dems are again playing FALSE EQUIVALENCY GAME.  That brought down Hillary & gave us Trump. Don't let false equivalencies bring you down too.  @DNC @SenSchumer @TomPerezhttps://twitter.com/TomArnold/status/938600824866881536
938491890789470209 2017-12-06 19:34:37 UTC <Vva10967> @SenFeinstein It's clear that you guys in the Senate have a double standard when the Republicans are electing a PEDOPHILE to the Senate and NO ONE will hold the Pussy-Grabber-In-Chief that inhabits the White House accountable for his sexual assaults and alleged child rape because it's too soon
938491352681197568 2017-12-06 19:32:29 UTC <Vva10967> @SenBobCasey So you'll ask @alfranken to resign without an investigation into the truth of the allegations against him but you won't call on Trump's impeachment because "It's too soon" and "we need facts"???  Give me a break! Dems need to fight like Republicans and stop caving!!!

938240527765594117 2017-12-05 02:55:48 UTC <Vva10967> @RepStevenSmith She didnt. Unless YOU are jumping to the conclusion that all gang members are black? Because THAT is who she said were super predators. #GOPSupportsPedophiles
937950569989398528 2017-12-04 07:43:36 UTC <Vva10967> @SenFeinstein Maybe Utah should stop voting Republican. The parties are NOT alike. That is propaganda used by Mr. Sanders to grow his own PAC.
937949001940381696 2017-12-04 07:37:22 UTC <Vva10967> @MalcolmNance @PartPhil @carolealana No. Its My New Order. Still by Hitler. His then wife Ivanna said in 1991 to Vanity Fair that Trump kept a copy by his night table. Its available on google. We should probably all read it to see what comes next in his playbook.

937590685192130560 2017-12-03 07:53:33 UTC <Vva10967> @CapehartJ Loved your interview of @HillaryClinton. One of the best. Also loved the one you did of Donna Brazile.

Hillary has respect for law enforcement, govt institutions & for the law. Trump does not. Never has, never will & at 71 yo he wont change.
937457930680619009 2017-12-03 23:06:02 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes @realmadpip @Vickybayless It was 62 million plus 7 million a-holes who knew better but wanted to punish HRC for defeating their messiah. Thats a lot of a-holes.
937218663555522560 2017-12-02 07:15:16 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Since you lie so much you should know. Your nickname should be Lying Donald or Don The Con.

He couldnt convince the Dem base to vote for him. What makes you think the Trumpers would have voted for a commie?  Plus Putin wouldve hacked his emails & put them on Wikileaks. And Bernies rape essays would have been widely discussed
937057924534489093 2017-12-02 20:36:33 UTC <Vva10967> @IAMDJLIVE Somebody is playing games with @realDonaldTrump They probably put the cockroaches, mice and ants there on January 20th.  Or he brought them from Trump Tower!  That place (Trump Tower) is OLD and hasn't been refurbished or redecorated since the 1990s.

937046712241319938 2017-12-02 19:52:00 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM Bullshit. He wants to be able to say that he fought for the Dreamers because he wants to run for POTUS in 2020. He's as bad as the rest of his party, the Party of Trump and other sexual assaulters and pedophiles.
936868999941332992 2017-12-02 08:05:50 UTC <Vva10967> @OrrinHatch @SenatorFischer @tedcruz @DeanHeller @ALT_DOJ @houndmom @emerald_aly Hatch is retiring. Already announced it. Romney is considering running for that seat. Best bet to get to 51 in 2018 are NV (Heller) and AZ. There will be 2 seats in AZ.
936863811671277570 2017-12-01 07:45:13 UTC <Vva10967> @NastyWomenRule @TomArnold And unlike Obamacare the Trump Tax Scam pulls the plug on grandma & contains de facto death panels for people over 65 since Medicare cancer treatment will be cut to pay for the cuts.
936730681543192576 2017-12-01 22:56:12 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 @SenFranken should resign ONLY AFTER the Pussy-Grabber-In-Chief resigns.  @realDonaldTrump has 16 women accuse him of sexual assault and 1 woman accuse him of child rape.  Press was too busy with Hillary's emails to investigate, especially the child rape case filed in court.

936726621033259008 2017-12-01 22:40:04 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump The biggest Tax Cut in history FOR YOU, not for the average American.  The working and middle classes are going to pay MORE so YOU and YOUR DONORS can pay less. #TrumpTaxScam
936454233171382273 2017-11-30 04:37:42 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon Did your account get hacked?  If he hadnt trashed HRC and convinced his followers that she was a corporate whore we wouldnt be having this discussion in the Senate because Madam President would simply veto the GOP Tax Scam.

The CIA took the position that the existence of its drones program was classified even though the reason Hillary and 300 other high level diplomats & State Dept & WH staff were discussing it was because NY Times kept printing front page stories about it. 
936395363459784704 2017-11-30 00:43:46 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro Conyers is being pushed out by Dem leadership. Looks like the only 2 left are Trump and Moore. Both Republican. The rapist and the pedophile. Maybe you should rethink what you still have left in common with your party?
936394062202105858 2017-11-30 00:38:36 UTC <Vva10967> @JRubinBlogger That would require them to have principles which neither @JeffFlake nor @BobCorker do. #PartyOverCountry #DonorsFirst

I think that given the new wave of zero tolerance, Bernie should be asked about the women fantasize about being raped by 3 men & similar essays he wrote in his 30s. Unlike Bill Clintons affairs, Bernies essays havent been investigated AT ALL.

936037161664688128 2017-11-29 01:00:24 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon @TruNewsNet Bet Trump will make Ws 2008 Recession look good. He is currently riding Obamas economy since he hasnt passed any laws. Once he passes his Trump Tax Scam, the economy will start diving and fast because hes raising taxes on the states responsible for 2/3 of USAs GDP.

935736814291292160 2017-11-28 05:06:56 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @lariti2 @Bernadette96 @MeMe23 @studiohq @Allon2324 No she lost because at least 78000 idiots like you in 3 swing states believed the memes the Russians fed you. Youre extremely easy to manipulate because you grew up believing memes and empty logos from false prophets who have never accomplished anything in life.

935694232492363776 2017-11-28 02:17:44 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh If tomorrow Trump were to say that the Earth is Flat, the cable shows would run segments asking, is he right? is the earth flat? why is he saying that the earth is flat? instead of calling it what it is, a LIE. Just like the "Obama wiretapped me" nonsense.
935693765083312128 2017-11-28 02:15:52 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh The cable news shows do the same thing with Trump's claim that the Access Hollywood video isn't real.

934807330067288064 2017-11-26 15:33:30 UTC <Vva10967> @TrumpArmyDawn  says the one who elected a 71 yo man with a family history of Alzheimer's who cannot find his limo when it's parked in front of his plane and who can't tell reality from fiction anymore.
934668927996702721 2017-11-25 06:23:32 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump You are SOOOOOO gullible!!!  Is it age? Alzheimers? Some other form of dementia?
934667409306390528 2017-11-25 06:17:30 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid I sure hope you are right. Karma needs to hit him hard.
934557428372426754 2017-11-25 23:00:28 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill Because @realDonaldTrump knows that no matter how ridiculous his claims are, the main stream media wont call it out for what it is: a LIE. You actually give it a headline that suggests his ludicrous claim is plausible. It isnt.
933953951292116992 2017-11-23 07:02:28 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill seriously HillaryClinton should sue this loser. Make him pay. Will be money well spent. And she can even donate the proceeds to Onward Together if she wishes to.https://twitter.com/dbongino/status/933871009333170177
933952213017341952 2017-11-23 06:55:34 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill Why doesnt @HillaryClinton just sue him?  If he was never assigned to her it should be a slam dunk case. Times v Sullivan doesnt even come into play. And really, thats the only way these right wing POS are going to stop making stuff up about her.
933600812881907712 2017-11-22 07:39:13 UTC <Vva10967> @jack @Twitter @PhilippeReines Actually @facebook I would like to see ALL the ads displayed on a page with a disclosure of how many likes and shares each got.
933597956552478720 2017-11-22 07:27:52 UTC <Vva10967> @isteintraum Although in all fairness everyone Bernie endorsed loses so maybe he doesnt want to help the pedophile win #TheBernieCurse
933230975995318272 2017-11-21 07:09:37 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost @RonaldKlain How can Dems in Congress stop it?
933229450237394950 2017-11-21 07:03:34 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill Twitter needs an LOL button in addition to the like button. @jack
933216504086179840 2017-11-21 06:12:07 UTC <Vva10967> @EricTrump @FoxBusiness Looks like Eric Trump IS as STUPID as SNL and Seth Meyers portray him!
933211543155613697 2017-11-21 05:52:24 UTC <Vva10967> @TomArnold Curious, would that be his First, Second or Current Wife?
932633535013367808 2017-11-20 15:35:36 UTC <Vva10967> @renato_mariotti But then again, we've known that since the moment she joined the Trump Campaign.
932494843707879424 2017-11-19 06:24:30 UTC <Vva10967> @tomwatson @al_arthofer Maybe when your taxes go up and grad students cant pay the taxes theyll be charged for their scholarships and Obamacare disintegrates and Trump plunges us into a Great Depression with his tax and trade policies youll feel energized uh?
932140318136381445 2017-11-18 06:55:44 UTC <Vva10967> Hey Berners, hope youre enjoying the Trump era since your stupid third party protest votes in the swing states got us here. Bet Susan Sarandon and Jill Stein will not be affected by anything Trump does. But I bet you will be.https://twitter.com/kurteichenwald/status/931774595295739904
932138597511258112 2017-11-18 06:48:54 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald Mmmm I m pretty sure the billionaires and corporations this bill is helping did NOT promise anything. Theyre just collecting their return on investment after buying their Republican Congressmen/women.
931400732426858496 2017-11-16 05:56:53 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Obviously you have no clue what is in your Republican tax bill. You even screw New Yorkers and New Jersians taking away the state tax deduction. But YOU get anywhere between a BILLION and FOUR BILLION out of your tax bill depending on how rich you really are.
930913336933351427 2017-11-15 21:40:09 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @Shareblue @CaryNovak Thats Fox bullshit. Facts are facts. Even in the Trump era.
930912991029186560 2017-11-15 21:38:47 UTC <Vva10967> @chelseahandler The third party protest voters in the swing states made him POTUS. Because they chose to make it about them and not about US and the country. Trump didnt have enough voters to win.
930912385724018688 2017-11-15 21:36:22 UTC <Vva10967> @frodofied @SethAbramson Trump knows THEY know hes really STUPID.
930890417201180674 2017-11-15 20:09:05 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @Shareblue @CaryNovak Neither us nor the Russians are making nuclear bombs anymore. We both have thousands of warheads stockpiled to blow up the world. Fox just feeds your ignorance.
930889935267225600 2017-11-15 20:07:10 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @Shareblue @CaryNovak In fact, we don't have enough uranium in our mines to meet our power plant needs so we have agreements WITH RUSSIA to IMPORT uranium to meet our deficit, ie. RUSSIA SELLS US THE URANIUM WE NEED.  And the uranium that the mine that was sold makes CANNOT BE EXPORTED.
930889250345816065 2017-11-15 20:04:27 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @Shareblue @CaryNovak What scandal? It was a routine CFIUS review of the sale of a Canadian company that happened to have a small uranium mine in the US.  We use that uranium for nuclear FUEL at our nuclear power plants, to make ELECTRICITY, NOT to make bombs.
930715659234922496 2017-11-15 08:34:39 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Hey bozo, wrong shooting! There are so many now that youre mixing them up! Yet you refuse to do anything about them because YOURE SCARED of the NRA!
930322845011464194 2017-11-13 06:33:45 UTC <Vva10967> @marceelias Also the media acts as if Trump had enough voters to elect him POTUS when reason he won is that Bernie convinced his followers that the primary was unfair to him & they in turn CHOSE to cast 3rd party protest votes in swing states to punish @HillaryClinton, thus electing Trump.
930264780438491138 2017-11-13 02:43:01 UTC <Vva10967> @NBCNews So we are now officially a third world country run by a dictator?

929613920817512448 2017-11-11 07:36:44 UTC <Vva10967> @mad1nola @SethAbramson Traitor and impeach him. But since the GOP members of Congress wont do their jobs, we the people must fire them.
929223333366960128 2017-11-10 05:44:41 UTC <Vva10967> @MMFlint @RealTimers @SenSanders was promising ponies. Like Trump he had no F'g idea how to deliver the ponies but hey, he sounded authentic to you. And that is why the Rustbelt, Appalachia and the South are hurting, because those areas keep voting for authentic bozos who can't fix sh*t.
929222511128141824 2017-11-10 05:41:25 UTC <Vva10967> @MMFlint @RealTimers I'm tired of the bullshit that all of you pundits spew of wanting to elect a BOZO as POTUS because you can have a beer with him, and passing on the fucking brilliant candidate who can make our country prosperous, fair & truly great because she doesn't seem "authentic" to you. 
929221278355132416 2017-11-10 05:36:31 UTC <Vva10967> @MMFlint @RealTimers Actually in 2020 we'll need someone who's fucking brilliant to rebuild the federal government that Trump is decimating AND if the GOP tax cuts pass, also the US economy. Right now Trump is riding the Obama economy. The GOP tax increase on the 99% & on blue states will tank it.
929219227269128192 2017-11-10 05:28:22 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes I suggest you talk to @JoeConason and have him walk you through pages 60-66 of his book where he goes into detail on the Juanita story.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312245475/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_5?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A2ENLOCYXEFS31
929124053029474305 2017-11-10 23:10:11 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @KeithOlbermann Oh no, Trump is going to start wearing pantsuits hoping to look Presidential! 
929123428715687936 2017-11-10 23:07:42 UTC <Vva10967> @JoshuaGreen @LauraLitvan Funny, I don't recall that EVER bothering the Republicans when they went after Bill Clinton and exposed his affair with Monika in the 1990s. And Monika wasn't a minor. #RoyMooreIsAPedophile
928893414514528257 2017-11-09 07:53:42 UTC <Vva10967> @Truthbuster @RWPUSA Maybe a left wing billionaire can buy @CNN and return it to being the news network it was instead of the entertainment network that Jeff Zucker has turned it into. And he needs to go or stay back with Time Warner.
928839842447921153 2017-11-09 04:20:50 UTC <Vva10967> @lynnv378 @FeMaiden13 @Cycle4 Last week @billmaher had Jeffrey Lord. I couldnt watch it.  Surprised hes not also having Van Jones tomorrow. That would complete the Berniefest!
928833869121507328 2017-11-09 03:57:05 UTC <Vva10967> @TVietor08 The media does the exact same thing with Bernie Sanders for the Left.
928774160184217601 2017-11-09 23:59:50 UTC <Vva10967> @daveweigel Republicans haven't dumped Moore. They've been qualifying their replies with "IF the allegations are true, THEN he should step down." So no, Menendez should stay on at least until January, when Governor Murphy can appoint a Democrat to fill his seat.
928516239575699457 2017-11-08 06:54:57 UTC <Vva10967> @TelegraphWorld So Joe Biden is now adopting alternative facts???

926939413820723200 2017-11-04 22:29:12 UTC <Vva10967> @ManOfGoodPosts @neeratanden That feeds the myth that Bernie created about the DNC being a king-making arm of the Democratic Party when it's just a FUNDRAISING arm.
926937971114246145 2017-11-04 22:23:28 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill @neeratanden Seriously @HillaryClinton needs to start SUING people or they'll continue to LIE with impunity about her. Should've sued Peter Schweizer too

926204977533550592 2017-11-02 21:50:49 UTC <Vva10967> @donnabrazile @HillaryClinton @NickMerrill I think that played a role in how the MSM treated Hillary vs. how they treated Trump. They knew there'd be NO consequences for trashing HRC.

925608397520633856 2017-10-31 06:20:13 UTC <Vva10967> @ChadPergram At the White House? And without the so-called President?
925529082355384320 2017-10-31 01:05:03 UTC <Vva10967> @DKElections Well somebody is running ads in PA saying are you mad at [list of things Trump is doing] then send a message by voting for Democrat judges.
924845262199250949 2017-10-29 03:47:47 UTC <Vva10967> This was awesome! Fastest GOP debunk ever!https://twitter.com/amjoyshow/status/924701835901964288
924844865762070528 2017-10-29 03:46:13 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill hope @HillaryClinton has been able to watch @JoyAnnReid debunking the Uranium One GOP talking point today.  It was AWESOME!!!https://twitter.com/amjoyshow/status/924701835901964288
924122767015981057 2017-10-27 03:56:51 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @JRutstein @emptywheel @ericgeller @matthewamiller Why do AGs resign as opposed to waiting to be fired by a POTUS that is forcing them out?
924030269451063296 2017-10-27 21:49:18 UTC <Vva10967> @Amy_Siskind Trump's entire interaction with the kids is WEIRD.https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/924002187306512384
924013018513575937 2017-10-27 20:40:45 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes @HillaryClinton @EricLiptonNYT @maisondechienvt Media strategy for covering Trump should be to pretend he's HRC & assume he too is guilty of the unimaginable & ignore everything he says.
924012367767326720 2017-10-27 20:38:10 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @EricLiptonNYT @maisondechienvt It's Clinton Derangement Syndrome. The @nytimes has 25 yrs covering HRC that way. She's assumed guilty of the unimaginable no matter what.
924002033442742272 2017-10-27 19:57:06 UTC <Vva10967> @andersoncooper @NickMerrill But @CNN @AndersonCooper @wolfblitzer @jaketapper are all going along like trained animals, jumping when the master says JUMP.

923793349055795201 2017-10-26 06:07:52 UTC <Vva10967> @funder We need to take US House back in 2018 to stop GOP from selling our government to Putin. Need @AdamSchiffCA to be Intel Chair! #GOPTreason
923792084506693632 2017-10-26 06:02:50 UTC <Vva10967> Hey @jaketapper @wolfblitzer @andersoncooper Heres your topic for tomorrow, just as credible as the Uranium One stories you ran today!https://twitter.com/rwpusa/status/923721086998638592
923778513756356609 2017-10-26 05:08:55 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN, that's you & @AC360 Anderson Cooper your "reporting" on this is shameful. It was a F**king CFIUS Review! Like antitrust review.https://twitter.com/phyllissharp54/status/923731836471316480
923768474308050944 2017-10-26 04:29:01 UTC <Vva10967> @mmfa and @SebGorka should be tried like the Nazi he is. #NurembergTrials
923692580696657920 2017-10-26 23:27:27 UTC <Vva10967> did @HillaryClinton not smile enough @JoeBiden? 
923690773689917441 2017-10-26 23:20:16 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer Rumor has it that ICE is working w DOJ to charge the parents of undocumented children with human trafficking. So will probably jail parents.
923665915039965186 2017-10-26 21:41:29 UTC <Vva10967> Why is @TulsiGabbard so friendly to Putin's government?  https://twitter.com/joshrogin/status/923580140529029120
923620239987957761 2017-10-26 18:39:59 UTC <Vva10967> @tedlieu @cherokeesher2 He can't. In the House, the Speaker controls the agenda & committees. Until Nov 2018 that's Speaker Ryan who's covering for Trump's treason.
923618507178303490 2017-10-26 18:33:06 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes @kenvogel @marceelias @NatashaBertrand @joanwalsh @tcddoyle @mimilahr @TheMattFenton unless you're a public figure in which case you have to prove malice which is a higher bar. But I don't think Mr. Elias is a "public figure"

923243514758156288 2017-10-25 17:43:01 UTC <Vva10967> @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain @PhilippeReines to jump ship! They should learn from @HillaryClinton who is STILL fighting to defeat the dark forces that Trump unleashed. THAT is patriotic
922996375993774081 2017-10-24 01:20:59 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein Apparently @SpeakerRyan's response was to give @DevinNunes & @TGowdySC the green light to start impeaching real POTUS @HillaryClinton 
922994827154919424 2017-10-24 01:14:49 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill We all keep saying that and then Trump proves that he has no bottom. No low is too low for him.
922993950520107008 2017-10-24 01:11:20 UTC <Vva10967> @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain @PhilippeReines Flake already said he won't consider impeaching Trump.
922993354438266882 2017-10-24 01:08:58 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines Because he's not stopping Trump, he's quitting. As is Corker. Flake said later he would not consider impeaching Trump to stop him.
922963128920559616 2017-10-24 23:08:52 UTC <Vva10967> Republicans are traitors. Their Uranium One story has been debunked. It was a CFIUS review. Anything to not investigate RussiaGate!https://twitter.com/mikememoli/status/922854538763227136
922962283617247234 2017-10-24 23:05:30 UTC <Vva10967> @kasie Why? @JeffFlake is quitting instead of fighting back. The country is in danger, time for him to get off the ship??!

922520660194287616 2017-10-23 17:50:39 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @Shakestweetz lol, I had forgotten about Nunes! 
922520093438939142 2017-10-23 17:48:24 UTC <Vva10967> This event is in DC on October 28. 3600 attendees expected. Tickets are sold out.https://twitter.com/HRC/status/922517229803057154
922512630018924546 2017-10-23 17:18:45 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @Shakestweetz The leaker has to be someone NOT on Mueller's team (his team doesn't leak) who's received a subpoena for docs or testimony, or a grand juror
922511525365116929 2017-10-23 17:14:21 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @Shakestweetz @AHammondmeyer So who's the source of this leak? Typically it's been people receiving the subpoenas or being interviewed. So someone close to Tony Podesta?
922511018802274305 2017-10-23 17:12:20 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @Shakestweetz @AHammondmeyer But the Uranium Scandal is a CFIUS review. Not different than an antitrust review but for foreigners. And Mueller's Team doesn't leak.
922509068673183744 2017-10-23 17:04:36 UTC <Vva10967> @ericgarland lol, any idea when this all unfolds? 2018? 2019? 2020? Do we survive or are we all killed in Trump's Nuclear Armageddon?
922346785103908866 2017-10-22 06:19:44 UTC <Vva10967> @IrisRimon Maybe hes trying to flatter Trump so hell accept his offer to go to North Korea to negotiate with Kim Jung Un?
922249380844965888 2017-10-22 23:52:41 UTC <Vva10967> @KaraCalavera i thought they all DemExited back in July? Was it all empty threats?
922246303639273473 2017-10-22 23:40:27 UTC <Vva10967> @Billbrowder Putin is learning from the Republicans & their 25 years of smearing the Clintons.
922246000168914947 2017-10-22 23:39:15 UTC <Vva10967> @creynoldsnc 2 year anniversary. Twitter really needs that Edit function!
922242891564580866 2017-10-22 23:26:54 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Yeah, but you got YOUR media coverage for free, at least $2 BILLION worth. @CNN and @MSNBC even taped your empty podiums!
922242405038002176 2017-10-22 23:24:58 UTC <Vva10967> @NatashaBertrand Maybe @LindseyGrahamSC should read the Steele Dossier, it's very revealing even if you leave aside the pee pee tapes. 
922210645168263173 2017-10-22 21:18:46 UTC <Vva10967> @RepWilson @amjoyshow Has anyone in the media checked the video for General Kelly sightings? Did he actually attend that FBI Building inauguration?
922125776576753667 2017-10-22 15:41:32 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko This is no time to be shy or modest.
922125663666098183 2017-10-22 15:41:05 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko I think they should highlight more the volunteer work that Ralph Northam as MD does in rural Virginia with the Remote Area Medical clinics.
922120361776476160 2017-10-22 15:20:01 UTC <Vva10967> @Spitfirehill Too bad we didn't find out who she was. She should have been shamed.
922118827198083072 2017-10-22 15:13:55 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @Ohdaneit Because the release of the JFK Files was legislated 25 years ago, in 1992. Said the files were going to be released Oct 26, 2017.
922117901297111040 2017-10-22 15:10:14 UTC <Vva10967> @eclecticbrotha @Irish_Pack They still need to get rid of the Unity Committee which has the hard core Berners.
921959252733956096 2017-10-21 04:39:49 UTC <Vva10967> @bravenak Do you think he realizes that he looks like a pompous ass? 
921944008800309248 2017-10-21 03:39:15 UTC <Vva10967> @NerdyWonka President Obama is so eloquent, what a huge contrast to the Orange Fuhrer.
921622827186425856 2017-10-20 06:22:59 UTC <Vva10967> @JKH2 And she is getting the award on her birthday(October 26).
921618486929055745 2017-10-20 06:05:44 UTC <Vva10967> @damonbethea1 @kylegriffin1 They only need 51 votes to be confirmed. Will Republicans put country over party? They havent yet.
921447280942690311 2017-10-20 18:45:26 UTC <Vva10967> @RepWilson @Yamiche Because she is black and a woman? That is the pattern in the Trump Administration. Why not admit that Kelly is a TRUE believer of Trumpism?
921407832108556288 2017-10-20 16:08:40 UTC <Vva10967> @RepWilson @realDonaldTrump @NewDay @CNNPolitics @vee817 @glory_janson @themisrules @AzaniaJustice @ActosNonVerba @Bionic_T_Rex And his fucking travel ban is to blame for it. Chad's armed forces were keeping our troops in Niger safe & withdrew from Niger after Sep ban
921407402636869634 2017-10-20 16:06:58 UTC <Vva10967> @RepWilson @realDonaldTrump @NewDay @CNNPolitics @vee817 @glory_janson @themisrules @AzaniaJustice @ActosNonVerba @Bionic_T_Rex Because the widow DESERVED an apology. They also fucking abandoned Sgt Johnson ALIVE and didn't find him until 2 days later #TrumpsBenghazi
921406582025486336 2017-10-20 16:03:42 UTC <Vva10967> @CandiceAiston @revlupneb Maybe Susan Sarandon identifies with leaches??? 
921404322776305664 2017-10-20 15:54:44 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon @KazeSkyz Also, they were NOT speaking prior to his death. That's a fact that should have been publicized to understand her true motives for LYING.
921401649930883072 2017-10-20 15:44:06 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump we've found the source of the Fake News: It's FOX!!!https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/921345543074394114
921396414177005569 2017-10-20 15:23:18 UTC <Vva10967> @CNNPolitics @MooreHomes1 @ZenaRo ps Blair is a Russian troll. Look at his handle. 8 numbers.

But he can NEVER apologize. #Sociopath
921395501060194304 2017-10-20 15:19:40 UTC <Vva10967> Rep. Wilson is right, Sgt. Johnson did not die "surrounded by his friends". He was left behind, alive, and found dead 2 days later.https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/921337696282345472
921259391650803712 2017-10-19 06:18:49 UTC <Vva10967> @KenDilanianNBC The @nytimes story WAS based on the Clinton Cash book financed by Bannon & the Mercers. Also look up CFIUS review. You might learn something
921257723144146952 2017-10-19 06:12:11 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon @KazeSkyz She was reading off a Teleprompter, a speech that she didnt write & whose writer later said he regretted writing.
921170614697705473 2017-10-19 00:26:03 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Trump always projects.
921168212250722304 2017-10-19 00:16:30 UTC <Vva10967> @JanzforCongress Pretty sure they were not tricked when they did it.
921069477399232512 2017-10-19 17:44:10 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Ask your White House Counsel what a CFIUS Review is. Should enlighten you. You too will be signing off on many of these.
920871434116911104 2017-10-18 04:37:13 UTC <Vva10967> @PeterAlexander we have a follow up question for the next time you see Trump.https://twitter.com/joyannreid/status/920691829900800002
920865654105833472 2017-10-18 04:14:15 UTC <Vva10967> @isteintraum They both lost their 2016 primaries bigly. Neither is the Chair of the Committees in charge of healthcare or taxes. Why should anyone care?
920864129442893825 2017-10-18 04:08:11 UTC <Vva10967> @DHSgov @tedlieu Why are naturalized US Citizens being targeted without a warrant or probable cause & the Congress says NOTHING??? @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr

920820837418262528 2017-10-18 01:16:10 UTC <Vva10967> @CREWcrew @joyce_tyler Only if he indicts. What Comey did to Hillary in July and later in October was unprecedented & Mueller is unlikely to go rogue like Comey.
920820385037332480 2017-10-18 01:14:22 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN Seriously CNN, why would anyone care about the opinion of 2 men who were rejected by the voters bigly in the 2016 primaries???
920819480896397312 2017-10-18 01:10:46 UTC <Vva10967> @Yahoo @AOL @CBS @nbc @thehill @politico @ABC @AP @PBS @MSNBC @CNN @ItsNorbitPeters LOL, you should lay off Fox and Breitbart!  Or maybe it's InfoWars?  Hard to tell.
920818844905635840 2017-10-18 01:08:15 UTC <Vva10967> @CREWcrew @joyce_tyler Mueller and his team don't leak. And it would be illegal to leak the tax returns. Trump has to disclose them (or be forced to via lawsuits).
920810684333539328 2017-10-18 00:35:49 UTC <Vva10967> No offense but voting third party IS how we got Trump. #NoThanks

920803436177760256 2017-10-18 00:07:01 UTC <Vva10967> @coopah 100% consistent with GOP View that Healthcare is a Privilege and NOT a Right. Until Americans vote GOP out, we'll continue to see this.
920788617244626945 2017-10-18 23:08:08 UTC <Vva10967> @planetcivic yeah, let's start with @realDonaldTrump
920787120595329024 2017-10-18 23:02:11 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilMurphyNJ @Lonegan Bullshit. The Attorney Generals of all the blue states are suing Trump Admin to stop it. #TenthAmendment

920766491385061378 2017-10-18 21:40:13 UTC <Vva10967> @ChuckGrassley @benjaminwittes was Sen Grassley being Senile or just a partisan hack? He KNOWS that was a ROUTINE CFIUS review & that there were NO grounds 2 deny approval
920762678968188928 2017-10-18 21:25:04 UTC <Vva10967> @CREWcrew @joyce_tyler Oh I'm sure Mueller has Trump's tax returns but WE the public should have them too. We got Obama's & the Clinton's & W's. Should get Trump's
920762020215054336 2017-10-18 21:22:27 UTC <Vva10967> @HouseBenghazi @HillaryClinton @Irish_Pack @4YrsToday But it will not because Republicans are traitors and put Party Over Country. #VoteThemOut
920516284290396161 2017-10-17 05:05:59 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @Irish_Pack @4YrsToday The green berets deaths would fall under DOD so Mattis & the so-called Commander In Chief should be made to testify in 2019.
920440029499011072 2017-10-17 00:02:58 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill @HillaryClinton should consider suing Breitbart for libel. They're back to their uranium nonsense. Take them down like Thiel did w Gawker?
920387626078822400 2017-10-17 20:34:44 UTC <Vva10967> @SethAbramson @GOP has no morals left. This is the party that stole SCOTUS seat & wants to cover up RussiaGate. Ryan would keep presidency for himself. 
920364743189245952 2017-10-17 19:03:48 UTC <Vva10967> @brianbeutler Media should ask Gen Kelly if it's true, just like they've been asking Tillerson if he called Trump a moron. Let's see where Kelly stands.
920364111912894466 2017-10-17 19:01:18 UTC <Vva10967> And nop, this is NOT from the National Enquirer. She's one of 5 Republicans seeking to replace GOP's @RosLehtinen when she retires in 2018!https://twitter.com/NBCLA/status/920133780849020929
920359309967491072 2017-10-17 18:42:13 UTC <Vva10967> @kaitlancollins Well, are you going to ask him?
920355936123981824 2017-10-17 18:28:49 UTC <Vva10967> @Beyerstein @benwikler why does it only require 51 votes and not 60?
920333087673847808 2017-10-17 16:58:01 UTC <Vva10967> @AC360 Too bad he didn't say that during the 2016 campaign. Seems that Republicans will only speak up if they're not running for reelection.
920160811078873088 2017-10-16 05:33:27 UTC <Vva10967> @Newsweek lol, he still believes Republicans would do the right thing! The party that STOLE a SCOTUS seat? The party that refuses to impeach Trump?
919961059699634176 2017-10-16 16:19:43 UTC <Vva10967> @20committee She was a private citizen in 2013, why would the IC have continued to give her classified briefings as a private citizen???
919949511363096576 2017-10-16 15:33:50 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 Bannon should have added: I prefer a President that my bosses, the Mercers, own.  
919947288553943040 2017-10-16 15:25:00 UTC <Vva10967> @bravenak do we know if he ever paid the money back? I recall that he charged it to his campaign?
919689901943283718 2017-10-15 22:22:14 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat She was the last thing standing between us and the Apocalypse.  He's a deranged sociopath & has no one to stop him. He might kills us all.
919689474929582080 2017-10-15 22:20:32 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat & frankly everything she told us about Trump has turned out to be true.THAT ALONE should have made people do everything possible to stop him
919689199615438848 2017-10-15 22:19:26 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat She had an extensive economic agenda. Media chose to focus on her emails bc they wanted the ratings of a horse race & never thought he'd win
919688982581178370 2017-10-15 22:18:35 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat She was going to end Reaganomics which is still in our tax code. Trump will make the tax code Reagonomics on steroids, like she warned us.
919688396230053888 2017-10-15 22:16:15 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @seenorseems Not if she had gone after him in March, after it became mathematically impossible for him to catch up to her votes & elected delegates.
919688016192589824 2017-10-15 22:14:44 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat The media created that narrative and Bernie reinforced it.  Now the media is living to regret it.  Not sure about Bernie. He likes attention
919687682086920199 2017-10-15 22:13:25 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat Hillary understood it but only discussed it in Economic forums. Should have gone mainstream w/ it. Leaving/renegotiating NAFTA can't fix it.
919687205400047616 2017-10-15 22:11:31 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat Once DE did that, every corporation reincorporated in DE in the 1990s & employees & firing them became a non-issue. It wasn't bc of NAFTA.
919686774355644416 2017-10-15 22:09:48 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat Also Delaware played a big part as it changed its corporate laws saying only constituency for Board of Dir were shareholders not employees.
919686512266051584 2017-10-15 22:08:46 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat Manufacturing jobs began leaving after Reagan reformed the Tax Code. It's the tax code that makes it advantageous to leave.
919685872697659393 2017-10-15 22:06:13 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat Both Bernie & Trump lied about NAFTA. Sure, Hillary should have debunked their lies and didn't. So that was a mistake.
919685628584964097 2017-10-15 22:05:15 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat If/when Trump exits NAFTA, his rural voters will find out that just like the ACA, NAFTA has benefited them & their states.
919685035439153153 2017-10-15 22:02:54 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat No, a lot of them chose Trump and his politics of white resentment and white supremacy. The media keeps giving his voters excuses.
919682370512543745 2017-10-15 21:52:18 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat Your hate and that of the other Bernie Bros lost her the election. And Bernie fueled it with his lies about her character.
919681971068039169 2017-10-15 21:50:43 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat Everyone who voted 3rd party IS responsible for Trump and what he has done and will continue to do to our country & to the most vulnerable.
919681765115158529 2017-10-15 21:49:54 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat The 3rd party protest vote elected Trump. It went from less than 1% in 2008 & 2012, to 5% in 2016 with the same 3rd party candidates as 2012
919681346674536448 2017-10-15 21:48:14 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat lol, sorry that if it didn't fit into a bumper sticker you and Rust Belt voters couldn't comprehend it. Would cartoons have helped? 
919676608998445057 2017-10-15 21:29:25 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger You and the other Bernie Bros elected Donald Trump POTUS with your stupid Third Party protest votes. You screwed yourselves AND Bernie.
919676234874998784 2017-10-15 21:27:55 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @seenorseems That just proves that it was a bad decision for HRC to not expose the skeletons in his closet. He'd be polling in single digits if she had.
919675610108133377 2017-10-15 21:25:26 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat Yeah, after he convinced them that she was corrupt and a "corporate whore". NEVER WALKED IT BACK.
919637370928091141 2017-10-15 18:53:29 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh I think @SenFeinstein is too used to the old ways of the Senate and is too nice to Republicans.  Senate has changed for the worse.
919633270438055937 2017-10-15 18:37:12 UTC <Vva10967> @IndieWire Only sad thing is that Woody Allen is still a member of the Academy.  He too should be kicked out!
919630251285778432 2017-10-15 18:25:12 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @NoMoreNeolibs She attacked him on the issues but NOT personally. And she could have but didn't.  Wish she had. Wish WE had. He'd be polling in single # s
919629467898740738 2017-10-15 18:22:05 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @NoMoreNeolibs I was going to say that if policies mattered more than labels Trump wouldn't be POTUS, but YOU BernieBros MADE HIM POTUS w 3rd party votes!
919628930512015360 2017-10-15 18:19:57 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @NoMoreNeolibs If policies mattered more than labels, YOU & your Bernie Bros would've voted 4 Hillary who developed policies & not just slogans like Bernie
919628274380271619 2017-10-15 18:17:21 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @NoMoreNeolibs Oh he has plenty of skeletons. The GOP Dossier on him is rather thick & has video too. And if he runs in 2020, it will come out EARLY.
919427389402353665 2017-10-14 04:59:06 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger HE LOST FAIR AND SQUARE AND IN A LANDSLIDE. 4 MILLION VOTES IS NOT CLOSE AT ALL. IF HE RUNS IN 2020 HE WILL LOSE AGAIN IN A LANDSLIDE.
919426417183649796 2017-10-14 04:55:14 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger The admission you cite is a motion to dismiss->defendants lawyer says ok lets assume EVERYTHING plaintiff alleges is true, STILL NO CASE
919425348143669248 2017-10-14 04:50:59 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger He continued to milk his followers for $27 donations when it was mathematically impossible for him to catch up in votes & elected delegates.
919424925491974144 2017-10-14 04:49:18 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger Nobody robbed him. He however robbed his followers pretending that he wasnt mathematically eliminated after March 15 and after NY.
919343392823349248 2017-10-14 23:25:20 UTC <Vva10967> @LondonEconomic Nop. He lost primary by 4 million votes. And @HillaryClinton didnt bring out the skeletons in his closet but GOP would have for sure.

918885413699366919 2017-10-13 17:05:29 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews "estrategia"?  Trump no entiende el tratado nuclear ni tampoco la politica externa de los EEUU, como va a tener una estrategia al respecto?
918882981988765696 2017-10-13 16:55:49 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @abbydphillip Was @realdonaldtrump talking about himself??? 
918875857015463937 2017-10-13 16:27:30 UTC <Vva10967> Funny how terrorists acts by white dudes don't get the same coverage that terrorist acts by muslims do....https://twitter.com/funder/status/918496645750411264
918689662293520384 2017-10-12 04:07:38 UTC <Vva10967> @yashar Does Oliver Stone have skeletons in his closet too?
918513162760093696 2017-10-12 16:26:17 UTC <Vva10967> The 4 Cities are New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago. All this because the Bernie Bros wanted to protest vote!https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/918512229263306753
918511441157779456 2017-10-12 16:19:27 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @womensmarch Will he read his essay on how women fantasize being raped???
918510678754889728 2017-10-12 16:16:25 UTC <Vva10967> @POTUS @NancyPelosi @Flare5699 The Republicans will let Vets go homeless with or without illegals. They hate social programs & only care about Tax Cuts for the 1%.
918336822048063489 2017-10-11 04:45:34 UTC <Vva10967> @justapedn @DonnaNoble10th @elid955 @DragonStone1963 Right now Trump should be ordering his FEMA guy to do away with the red tape. Instead Brock is ignoring the San Juan Mayor to please Trump!
918336336515526656 2017-10-11 04:43:39 UTC <Vva10967> @justapedn @DonnaNoble10th @elid955 @DragonStone1963 You can't fix what you don't understand and Trump doesn't understand basic things, including how FEMA works. He IS a moron. #Fact
918335857760890880 2017-10-11 04:41:45 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah I did. It should say that Trump is a UPenn graduate with a BS in Economics.
918334831657914369 2017-10-11 04:37:40 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah It's NOT the same thing. The Wharton prestige is derived from the BUSINESS SCHOOL SIDE. He couldn't even get into UPenn straight out of HS.
918334284280336384 2017-10-11 04:35:29 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah His degree is from UPenn. Yes, it's an Ivy League. But to get a Wharton School degree you have to be enrolled in the Wharton Business School
918333484824973312 2017-10-11 04:32:19 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM @MalcolmNance @joshtpm Seems that NBC is working on a story/video that Trump wants to quash:https://twitter.com/TomArnold/status/918123740399112193
918332182644559872 2017-10-11 04:27:08 UTC <Vva10967> @justapedn @DonnaNoble10th @elid955 @DragonStone1963 The ineptitude comes from the top. We have an inept POTUS. FEMA did great during Sandy when Obama & his team were overseeing it.
918331862354886658 2017-10-11 04:25:52 UTC <Vva10967> @elid955 @justapedn That's exactly what San Juan Mayor @CarmenYulinCruz has been saying all along.
918331562680307713 2017-10-11 04:24:40 UTC <Vva10967> Maybe you should read @DavidCayJ's book on Trump?
918331341359452160 2017-10-11 04:23:48 UTC <Vva10967> He attended first 2 years of college at Fordham & transferred into UPenn as a junior. He took COURSES at Wharton, the UPenn Business School.
918330287263834112 2017-10-11 04:19:36 UTC <Vva10967> Another thing the media gets wrong (like the HRC emails story).https://twitter.com/davidcayj/status/774414176273989632
918323712901959680 2017-10-11 03:53:29 UTC <Vva10967> @NBCNews @nbc you should have released those Apprentice tapes last October.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/918267396493922304
918323238383493125 2017-10-11 03:51:36 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump And what your advisers wrote for you does NOT do any of that, it's just a tax cut for the top 1% that guts Medicare & Medicaid to pay 4 it.
918322405700984832 2017-10-11 03:48:17 UTC <Vva10967> He's not a Wharton graduate, he made that up.
918318271220387840 2017-10-11 03:31:52 UTC <Vva10967> @Bourdain So if the Weinstein stories were out there for years, wouldn't YOU have known about them too & if so, why didn't YOU speak out & out him?
918314233758089217 2017-10-11 03:15:49 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @SRuhle Great, one more thing he does NOT understand! He'll leave our country in financial ruin if he manages to pass his tax cut for the 1%.
918313758342205440 2017-10-11 03:13:56 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @chrislhayes Yet she's brilliant & would have been an awesome POTUS bc she understands America's problems & KNOWS how to solve them & prepared 4 the job.
918313305344749568 2017-10-11 03:12:08 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes Maybe now you understand. @HillaryClinton is maligned for things she hasn't done and has no control over  and have nothing to do with her.
918147663991676928 2017-10-11 16:13:56 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump If you could revoke a broadcaster's license over fake news, Fox would have lost theirs back in the late 1990s. Even morons should know that.
917988024440500224 2017-10-10 05:39:35 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @HillaryPix HRC should have done more of these large rallies. She fills up large venues. Would have killed the shes so unpopular false media narrative
917980654444392448 2017-10-10 05:10:17 UTC <Vva10967> @markfollman Isnt there an environmental group that can sue to stop him?
917768656720982016 2017-10-10 15:07:53 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Good luck Joy and stay safe. Will you be going to Puerto Rico too?
917768184010289152 2017-10-10 15:06:01 UTC <Vva10967> @owillis But they won't because the parties are NOT equal.
917765683546640384 2017-10-10 14:56:04 UTC <Vva10967> @voxdotcom Since he cannot understand policy, much less write it, who do you think is really behind his executive order "fixes"? Can't be Ryan or Mitch
917764619158065152 2017-10-10 14:51:51 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump That's what W thought too before he crashed the economy in 2008.
917764392879640576 2017-10-10 14:50:57 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump We SHOULD tax the NFL.No reason why they should get a tax exemption. Will make interesting conversation at your next NFL owners fundraiser
917763671174139904 2017-10-10 14:48:05 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump you read? or did you listen to the audible in between your golf outings, tweeting and watching Fox?
917763193971331073 2017-10-10 14:46:11 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @IsraelUSAforevr Trump with his ineptitude is going to piss off Iran and get you all nuked and you're thanking him!
917630869556416512 2017-10-09 06:00:22 UTC <Vva10967> https://twitter.com/i/moments/917466583131410433
917606619831291904 2017-10-09 04:24:01 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs @IrisRimon @turnageb Yeah Brad Parscale said in October that they were focusing on running anti-Hillary ads to convince young blacks & Latinos to stay home.
917604675087732736 2017-10-09 04:16:17 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs Lol. You still think the election was decided on issues & not on racial hate, xenophobia, misogyny & Bernies slanders of HRCs character.
917602101160759297 2017-10-09 04:06:03 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton speaking at UC Davis tonight!https://twitter.com/mondavicenter/status/917592704246099968
917568462616178688 2017-10-09 01:52:23 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryPix I think it will be a hard race if CA House Dems who are confronting Trump challenge her, e.g. Adam Schiff, Maxine Waters, Eric Swalwell
917566851592474624 2017-10-09 01:45:59 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @bravenak @viacampmimi @thepoliticalcat @ShouldRemain She's anti-Hillary & anti-Pelosi & pro-Tim Ryan, you know, the OH dude who took NRA contributions AFTER Sandy Hook & wanted to be Min Leader
917565449973452800 2017-10-09 01:40:25 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton & yet so many of those parents voted GOP for a POS who wants to end CHIP & if he could would also end the public schooling of disabled kids.
917564934422237184 2017-10-09 01:38:22 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton Truth is that every person with a disabled child that was able to attend public school or benefited from CHIP owed you a debt of gratitude.

917561053940191233 2017-10-09 01:22:57 UTC <Vva10967> @60Minutes @InvestigateRU Actually 60 Minutes, you should have watched the BBC Documentary BEFORE interviewing Parscale so you could catch his LIES and confront him.
917514870769291264 2017-10-09 22:19:26 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball STOP OBSESSING WITH HILLARY. SHE OWES US NOTHING. You wanted Tim Ryan to replace Pelosi & he took NRA money AFTER SANDY HOOK.

916363311951831040 2017-10-06 18:03:33 UTC <Vva10967> @JuddLegum Especially when the GOP nominated and elected the Pussy-Grabber-In-Chief as POTUS.  They have NO MORALS left to criticize ANYONE.
916348985258008576 2017-10-06 17:06:37 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost @seanspicer Maybe because when your party nominated & elected a Pussy-Grabber-In-Chief as POTUS, you normalized sexual assault & lost ALL moral ground.

912547579795267584 2017-09-25 05:21:11 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines So were W Bush and Cheney (intentionally hiding things). Didn't bother the Republicans. Only mistake you guys made was apologize for it.
912546184790777856 2017-09-25 05:15:39 UTC <Vva10967> @roxydavis99 There is no bottom with the Trumps. Just today Howard Stern released the tapes of ALL his interviews with Trump. 
912535527378898944 2017-09-25 04:33:18 UTC <Vva10967> Trump and Pence are too busy with fundraisers this week to pay attention to the USVI and Puerto Rico.http://politi.co/2hvbi1x
912533727418478592 2017-09-25 04:26:09 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias That's not limited to @LindseyGrahamSC , it's a Republican problem. Only exceptions in GOP are @SenatorCollins & @lisamurkowski.
912530833826811904 2017-09-25 04:14:39 UTC <Vva10967> @ASlavitt Until @lisamurkowski says she is also a NO, it's not dead. Rand Paul is not reliable. He was a no in the prior repeals & became a yes.
912520184308600832 2017-09-25 03:32:20 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes loved the interview and your questions but most I loved @HillaryClinton's answers to them. She's so smart and knowledgeable, unlike DJT.
912518505853046784 2017-09-25 03:25:40 UTC <Vva10967> For the idiots who voted for Trump because they thought that his xenophobia would be limited to illegals and would not affect them:https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedNews/status/912468823441260551
912438927398711296 2017-09-25 22:09:27 UTC <Vva10967> @ReutersPolitics well yes, because it cuts Medicaid, that's where the "savings" is coming from!
912437718831026176 2017-09-25 22:04:39 UTC <Vva10967> @RVAwonk Unfortunately he can't launch it UNLESS & UNTIL Dems win back the House in 2018.
912437375875330048 2017-09-25 22:03:17 UTC <Vva10967> Of course. The Republicans don't want the Dreamers voting for 15 YEARS!https://twitter.com/ReutersPolitics/status/912433638222024705
912361311274758145 2017-09-25 17:01:02 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton So she's not saying that the National Guard & the Coast Guard have not been deployed but that this particular ship is needed to save lives/3
912357999267782657 2017-09-25 16:47:52 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton Hospitals in PR are closed because they can't get diesel due to flooded streets, debris & also drivers stuck in their homes. /2
912357699710521344 2017-09-25 16:46:41 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton The USNS Comfort is a Naval hospital ship which Trump & his inept govt may not know exists. /1
912195359656562688 2017-09-24 06:01:36 UTC <Vva10967> @RepStevenSmith @tedlieu Why isn't Trump's attack on NFL's players' freedom of speech an impeacheable offense? He swore to uphold the US Constitution incl 1st Amdt
912158482991910913 2017-09-24 03:35:04 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Hey @RealDonaldTrump @GOP & @TGowdySC, LOCK HIM UP???? Or does the rule only apply to HRC?http://wapo.st/2xpyZyA?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.b77f8106f44a
911981664519299074 2017-09-24 15:52:27 UTC <Vva10967> @Evan_McMullin mmm, have you been watching YOUR party, the GOP, over the last 30 years???  Trump didn't invent it, the GOP did & Trump put his name on it
911744322231525383 2017-09-23 00:09:20 UTC <Vva10967> @Khanoisseur can't somebody sue to stop them? like an environmental group? or even the govt of Alaska?
911742179529445376 2017-09-23 00:00:49 UTC <Vva10967> @yashar Why would a man that is still "With Her" want to go out with a Deplorable excuse for a human being???
911716438322368522 2017-09-23 22:18:32 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid LOVED the interview, you asked excellent questions. Would love to see Hillary as a regular guest on your show discussing policy 1:1 w you.

911709017982095360 2017-09-23 21:49:03 UTC <Vva10967> @awelab1956 @mikefarb1 @NatDialogues @LazyDogTweets @BCrawfordCA @cirizarryster They don't understand that to White nationalists, they are brown and would be racially profiled in time.
911708782434152448 2017-09-23 21:48:07 UTC <Vva10967> @awelab1956 @mikefarb1 @NatDialogues @LazyDogTweets @BCrawfordCA @cirizarryster The Latino vote probably reflects Texas & the old Cuban guard in FL. They think that Trump's rhetoric only affects illegals.
911456576124411904 2017-09-22 05:05:56 UTC <Vva10967> @girlsreallyrule Could be. But it would be higher without ACA. He might have a platinum plan that lets you see specialists without referrals.

911450622288941056 2017-09-22 04:42:16 UTC <Vva10967> @RepAdamSchiff DHS has yet to audit the voting and tallying machines to KNOW for sure they were not breached Claim of no breach is based on ASSUMPTIONS.
911449922641199104 2017-09-22 04:39:30 UTC <Vva10967> @APEastRegion @MYSTERIOUS043 @VeeCee30 @somecough210 @WNeilrlw12 DHS did not audit the voting or tallying machines to know if they were in fact breached. They simply ASSUMED they were not breached.
911449356028583936 2017-09-22 04:37:15 UTC <Vva10967> @APEastRegion DHS said they did not audit machines to know if they were in fact breached. DHS simply ASSUMED they were not breached. #Investigate
911309640838914048 2017-09-22 19:22:04 UTC <Vva10967> @allanbrauer The focus needs to be 2018. If we don't take back the House, we're screwed. Same with the Governorships & state legislatures.
911099261734969345 2017-09-21 05:26:06 UTC <Vva10967> @eafrederick521 @BarbaraLNewsome @SenSanders was likable until he let power & greed go to his head in primary. If he had stuck to issues & not slandered HRC she'd be POTUS.
911097105019691008 2017-09-21 05:17:31 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @HillaryClinton @amjoyshow Love it!  Can't wait to watch the interview!
911095814683951104 2017-09-21 05:12:24 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @DC4Hope @ZerlinaMaxwell Can you ask her what her thoughts are on where the fight against systemic racism goes & what happens to BLM with DOJ under Jeff Sessions?
911087663817437190 2017-09-21 04:40:00 UTC <Vva10967> @itsmebeccam @SallyAlbright @SoftSable79 To this date whenever I see any of the men that was on Senate Judiciary Committee then (e.g Hatch) my mind immediately jumps to Anita Hill.

910696512551874561 2017-09-20 02:45:43 UTC <Vva10967> @SecretService you should check out this Hillary Clinton stalker.https://twitter.com/LauraLoomer/status/910677910394167297

910609284534284288 2017-09-20 20:59:06 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @SenSanders @MeetThePress @SusanBordo and he never walked back any of his slanders on her character. Nor walked back any of the "rigged election" nonsense.
910608885093928963 2017-09-20 20:57:31 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @SenSanders @MeetThePress @SusanBordo Bernie would always end his speech by saying 2 his base that post-election they'd NEED to hold HRC accountable 4 making good on her promises
910608366988382208 2017-09-20 20:55:27 UTC <Vva10967> @MeetThePress @SusanBordo the thing is that during stump speeches @SenSanders made for @HillaryClinton he'd REINFORCE claim that she couldn't be trusted by his base.
910595151239761921 2017-09-20 20:02:56 UTC <Vva10967> @DailyTrix @pennyw503 @jlms_qkw yes, and Trump's attorney general wants to go back to the Immigration Law of 1924 to make America White Again.

910371300144828416 2017-09-19 05:13:26 UTC <Vva10967> @yashar Yes.  They need to stop trying to please Bernie and his Cult.

910359865113096193 2017-09-19 04:28:00 UTC <Vva10967> So @realDonaldTrump APOLOGIZED to Turkey??? #weakhttps://twitter.com/yashar/status/910292078403481601
910357250845364229 2017-09-19 04:17:36 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @JDiamond1 So why does a self-proclaimed billionaire need donations to pay his legal bills if he is as rich as he proclaims to be?

908855273602854912 2017-09-15 00:49:17 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @bluedgal @deniseparashac @RoughAcres Substantively, the interview Hillary gave to Ezra Klein at Vox is better than Anderson Cooper's.  The View's wasn't bad either.
908853421725437953 2017-09-15 00:41:56 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @BarackObama @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @RoughAcres @bluedgal @jude_scout CNN still feels and looks like a zoo. Long gone is their reputation as a news organization. Now they are purely a bad entertainment channel
908852938747105280 2017-09-15 00:40:00 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @BarackObama @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @RoughAcres @bluedgal @jude_scout The guy that is now CNN's President, Jeff Zucker, is a Trump friend and was President of NBC when NBC launched Trump's Apprentice show.
908852342719729664 2017-09-15 00:37:38 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @BarackObama @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @RoughAcres @bluedgal @jude_scout Rachel's program was born out of her Obama 2008 coverage on Keith Olbermann's show. Dems should have built it up like GOP did w Fox.
908851862371274752 2017-09-15 00:35:44 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @BarackObama @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @RoughAcres @bluedgal @jude_scout but the difference is that during the Obama years, Dems ran away from MSNBC instead of building it up, while Republicans built up Fox.
908763063008026624 2017-09-15 18:42:52 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @bluedgal @RoughAcres @skcalab where she tells Max laughing that she now wants to be spontaneous and authentic and maybe a little likeable. It's funny.
908762676066705408 2017-09-15 18:41:20 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @bluedgal @RoughAcres @skcalab or "she is so unlikable"By the way, if you haven't listened to the With Her podcast, HRC mocks the media in the last 2 episodes uploaded
908733540589764609 2017-09-15 16:45:34 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 waiting for Trump's tweet where he claims this and that Obama is the one doing it!!!
908732306776629249 2017-09-15 16:40:40 UTC <Vva10967> @emigre80 @MrMittensthecat exactly and activists may let their guard down with ACA repeal thinking that Medicare for All is viable and a real thing when it isn't.
908729807810306048 2017-09-15 16:30:44 UTC <Vva10967> @BarackObama @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @RoughAcres @bluedgal Yet @maddow has the top rated show on MSNBC & is the best vehicle for Dems to reach their base. CNN has gotten trashy with all the yelling.
908729243605053441 2017-09-15 16:28:29 UTC <Vva10967> @BarackObama @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @RoughAcres @bluedgal Maybe her show's producers aren't as aggressive as the producers of other shows in booking guests.
908728275433922560 2017-09-15 16:24:38 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @RoughAcres @bluedgal @BarackObama also never found time in his schedule as POTUS to go on Rachel's show. I think he gave her ONE interview in 8 yrs.
908727255676985345 2017-09-15 16:20:35 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @RoughAcres @bluedgal but Jen & her team had not been able to find time in HRC's tight schedule. But yet they found time for Fox, home of the Deplorables!
908726376991215621 2017-09-15 16:17:06 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @RoughAcres @bluedgal No, because Rachel had Jen Palmieri on her show after the election & they talked about it & Jen admitted that Rachel had tried to book HRC.
908725018846220288 2017-09-15 16:11:42 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @bluedgal @RoughAcres @barefootswan In 1 of latenight @MSNBC shows during Dem Convention, Joy Reid brought up sexism in how media was covering HRC & @HardballChris shut her up.
908723966197534720 2017-09-15 16:07:31 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @bluedgal @RoughAcres @barefootswan a woman?  What the media did to Hillary in 2016 wasn't much different than what they did to her in 2008. Coverage was sexist & misogynist.
908723022386929664 2017-09-15 16:03:46 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @bluedgal @RoughAcres Rachel has far left leaning views but is too smart to not know that Bernie couldn't pass anything he was selling nor knew how to pay for it.
908722532190228481 2017-09-15 16:01:49 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @bluedgal @RoughAcres yet they booked her on Fox with Chris Wallace.  Still reading What Happened so don't know if HRC says anything about where she was booked/Y
908721304043483136 2017-09-15 15:56:56 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @bluedgal @RoughAcres @carolstohon Yes, @mitchellreports did, and now she's paying for it. #Karma I hope @HillaryClinton does NOT give her any interviews going forward.
908553086561525760 2017-09-14 04:48:30 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @bluedgal @RoughAcres Rachel had a fascination with Bernie's crowd sizes. But neither she nor Joy Reid went negative on Hillary. Chuck Todd & Matthews did.
908552399878447106 2017-09-14 04:45:46 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @bluedgal @RoughAcres Rachel interviewed Hillary several times in 2016 & all interviews were fair & great. Her campaign booked her w Fox trying to appeal to GOP 
908545982480007168 2017-09-14 04:20:16 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @JW4Hillary @realpaolathomas @bluedgal @RoughAcres No, not true. Hillary was hard to book. Maddow tried. That was a mistake by her campaign (to not use MSNBC the way Trump used Fox and CNN.)
908541825270476807 2017-09-14 04:03:45 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes Didn't Bernie's bill omit its price tag like all his other prior single payer bills? If so how do you know how much would have to be raised?
908504965076934657 2017-09-14 01:37:17 UTC <Vva10967> @Amy_Siskind Listen to her Pod Save America podcast interview. What she says there is VERY close to what you've been saying, re Trump's authoritarianism.pic.twitter.com/zgQRDppOn4
908481076133339138 2017-09-14 00:02:21 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes but Gang of 8 bill was a really shitty bill, a militarization of our borders with no legalization unless and until GOP decided border=secure
908449985984942080 2017-09-14 21:58:49 UTC <Vva10967> @AhmedBaba_ @Jimi_Jammin true, but it proved that American voters will believe ANYTHING, no matter how absurd & that Dems shouldn't assume no one can be THAT dumb.
908447329631555584 2017-09-14 21:48:16 UTC <Vva10967> @AhmedBaba_ @Jimi_Jammin The 2010 election should have been a warning. Obama & Dems gave people HEALTHCARE and instead of being rewarded by voters they were punished
908189403750813697 2017-09-13 04:43:21 UTC <Vva10967> @Lawrence @chrishay what do you think? Part of Trump's dementia?https://twitter.com/kathrynw5/status/908058652132724737
908184579927928832 2017-09-13 04:24:11 UTC <Vva10967> @owillis you give him too much credit, he doesn't think long term. He just wants to see his poll numbers improve a bit.
908087128139190273 2017-09-13 21:56:57 UTC <Vva10967> The full interview of Hillary airs today, Wednesday, at 8:00 p.m. during "Anderson Cooper 360."https://twitter.com/danmericaCNN/status/908069458807320577
908084666263068678 2017-09-13 21:47:10 UTC <Vva10967> @20committee @JoeUchill lol, reading that description, I thought you tweet was about Trump, didn't realize it was about Flynn!
908083921715417088 2017-09-13 21:44:12 UTC <Vva10967> @chucktodd @HillaryWarnedUs mmmm, I would say the answer is YES, he just wings it! 
908023222548840448 2017-09-13 17:43:01 UTC <Vva10967> @marcushjohnson @_celia_marie_ @dorolfe @owillis @JoshuaGuess @fawfulfan Yeah but this is being presented as a viable plan and it isn't. it's political theater and we still need to protect and fix the ACA.
908021781084155906 2017-09-13 17:37:17 UTC <Vva10967> @sarahkliff @anneelliott1818 So Dems are banking on voters being too dumb to realize they're being sold Snake Oil. It worked for Trump & Bernie but will Dem base buy it?
908000347192520704 2017-09-13 16:12:07 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Single payer can't work unless we're also willing to regulate prices of healthcare & we aren't. HC isn't free. SOMEONE's always paying. /9
907999585980833797 2017-09-13 16:09:05 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid They expect same people who were upset about losing their doctor under ACA 2 embrace losing their current health insurance for Medicare? /8
907999280757198848 2017-09-13 16:07:53 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Actually, never mind passing, it has zero chance of even getting a vote since Ryan & McConnell decide what gets a vote. /7
907998898349846530 2017-09-13 16:06:21 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid And this Medicare for All bill that has zero chance of passing could make the Resistance let down its guard and allow ACA to be repealed /6
907998625363644416 2017-09-13 16:05:16 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid I feel like the Dems are setting themselves up to walk into a 2010-like "Death Panels, Pulls the Plug On Grandma" trap in 2018. /5
907998243514191872 2017-09-13 16:03:45 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid And it would be prohibitively expensive because you're not doing anything to bring HC prices under control. Also it would NOT be FREE. /4
907997777178845185 2017-09-13 16:01:54 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid The Medicare people know is really Medicare with Advantage Plans. Medicare by itself is like a bronze ACA plan with 80% coverage. /3
907997391973994496 2017-09-13 16:00:22 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid They are very vocal, but the majority of the voters get their medical insurance through their employers and are happy with it. /2
907997187723972608 2017-09-13 15:59:33 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid But don't you think Dems are MISREADING the electorate? The folks who lack medical insurance are a small segment of the population. /1
907770362645172224 2017-09-12 00:58:14 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias You can say the same thing of Bernie. But you won't. He too opposed gay marriage in his 2006 Senate Campaign. It just wasn't popular.
907747543915929600 2017-09-12 23:27:34 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @AW2B12 They won't admit it until Mueller shows that Bernie's campaign colluded too.
907747037805981697 2017-09-12 23:25:33 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller But Comey SO DESERVES to be dragged through the mud by Trump.  He was such an a-hole to Hillary. I'm sure Mueller will rescue him in the end
907744654896050176 2017-09-12 23:16:05 UTC <Vva10967> @finneyk @robertNorth14 @Feagley What vote??? Ryan and McConnell DECIDE what gets a vote and what does not. Guess where Bernie's bills fall?
907712274630156288 2017-09-12 21:07:25 UTC <Vva10967> @TVietor08 and you don't? Seriously? She is 100% right about the GOP's intentions of changing the Constitution. Will likely make us a Christian nation.
907669756324524033 2017-09-12 18:18:28 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @jjz1600 it made no sense when Bernie made it as he was mathematically eliminated after NY & knew it.But it weaponized DNC emails hacked in Mar & Apr
907669261581275136 2017-09-12 18:16:30 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @jjz1600 Then explain Bernie's claim that election was rigged, made precisely at a time when Putin had DNC emails & needed to weaponize them.
907668121854595073 2017-09-12 18:11:58 UTC <Vva10967> @daveweigel @kelsey_snell @frodofied @PowerPost She doesn't want to give Republicans the gift they need to stay in power in the House in 2018.
907667625538408449 2017-09-12 18:10:00 UTC <Vva10967> @kelsey_snell @daveweigel @PowerPost @FreeRangeK Dems are the minority party. CBO scores the majority party's bills, you know, the ones that get a vote and have a chance of becoming law.

907666011377332224 2017-09-12 18:03:35 UTC <Vva10967> @essenviews But will the GOP-controlled Senate confirm her regardless? @ChuckGrassley @SenFeinstein @SenFranken
907664126058536961 2017-09-12 17:56:05 UTC <Vva10967> @guycecil I don't think that is possible unless and until Bernie stops attacking the Dem Party & his Bros its upcoming stars like Kamala Harris.
907655740189499393 2017-09-12 17:22:46 UTC <Vva10967> @SymoneDSanders I don't see how you solve POC's problems with economics alone when you have systemic racism.https://twitter.com/JW4Hillary/status/907652088544493569
907655096137404417 2017-09-12 17:20:12 UTC <Vva10967> @PostEverything @washingtonpost @SymoneDSanders doesn't it bother you that in his 70 years of life he never bothered to staff his high level positions with POC? HRC did.
907653969857703936 2017-09-12 17:15:44 UTC <Vva10967> Thanks @BarackObama @POTUS44! Now was @HillaryClinton supposed to show anger at an economy that was doing well & had been revived from zero?https://twitter.com/WestWingReport/status/907638505295269888
907637745237061634 2017-09-12 16:11:16 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki @HillaryClinton is attacked for that vote as if she had been decisive vote or had been sole yes  (she wasn't, 77 of 100 Senators voted yes).
907637440487313408 2017-09-12 16:10:03 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki I don't remember ANYBODY pounding Kerry for YEARS for having voted FOR the Iraq War.
907625837700243456 2017-09-12 15:23:57 UTC <Vva10967> @owillis Funny, that reminds me of Anthony Weiner and the excuse he gave for his first sexting. #TedCruz
907621252671602690 2017-09-12 15:05:44 UTC <Vva10967> @MrTreyTony But sure, @HillaryClinton is so unpopular  & her appearances on The View (9/14), Colbert (9/18) & The Daily Show (11/1) are all sold out.
907618012743847936 2017-09-12 14:52:51 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill They (Russia) have probably been doing the same thing in Germany to attack Angela Merkel.
907614758530113536 2017-09-12 14:39:55 UTC <Vva10967> @rmiskimens @deray Because they know Jeff Sessions' DOJ agrees with them. @HillaryClinton's DOJ would have prosecuted this. #ElectionsHaveConsequences
907477728454160384 2017-09-11 05:35:25 UTC <Vva10967> @finneyk @robertNorth14 You mean he is playing his idiot base who believes that Mitch McConnell is going to let ANY of Bernie's bills come up for a vote. 
907443034064916482 2017-09-11 03:17:33 UTC <Vva10967> A tiny preview of tomorrow's With Her podcast.https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/with-her/id1143509380?mt=2&i=1000392117837
907407078477717505 2017-09-11 00:54:40 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @martinjdolan Had she used the State Dept server instead of her own, her emails would have been hacked because Russia hacked the State Dept in 2014.
907406644916768768 2017-09-11 00:52:57 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @martinjdolan And @HillaryClinton's server was NEVER HACKED. If it had been, her PRIVATE emails would be on Wikipedia. They're not.
907406387453599745 2017-09-11 00:51:56 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @martinjdolan Her server was set up for Bill Clinton & Clinton Foundation. She simply added a domain name to it (her tech did) for her email account.
907406024138805248 2017-09-11 00:50:29 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @martinjdolan emails PROPERLY marked CLASSIFIED (in accordance with manual) went into SCIF & into CLASSIFIED GOV SERVER ACCOUNT.
907405687264829441 2017-09-11 00:49:09 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @martinjdolan e.g. Did you know that the private server email account was ONLY for her UNCLASSIFIED emails & that she had a SCIF AND a CLASSIFIED account?
907405328018497539 2017-09-11 00:47:43 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @martinjdolan The story didn't go away because she apologized for having used a private server. BiG MISTAKE.  AND the press didn't understand servers.
907401654919720960 2017-09-11 00:33:07 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos And since the Berners hate the DNC, they also won't give it money. So DNC is failing at its key task: fundraising. /5
907401461314805760 2017-09-11 00:32:21 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos Now it's pissing off REGISTERED Dems with Unity Commission & the bowing down to Bernie so these Registered Dems don't give it money. /4
907400973089374210 2017-09-11 00:30:25 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos That's the reason Hillary had to pump money into it when she became the nominee. Other task is to plan debates & nominating convention  /3
907400490425647104 2017-09-11 00:28:30 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos People think it's a king-making entity because of Bernie's LIES. But it's not. And it hasn't been great at fundraising either. /2
907400277858422786 2017-09-11 00:27:39 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos The DNC is a FUNDRAISING ARM of the Dem Party, NOT a king-making entity. It raises money nationally & distributes it to Dem state parties 1/
907399406772736000 2017-09-11 00:24:11 UTC <Vva10967> @kkondik So we really should make the Supers non-voting. Otherwise Bernie will cry foul & blame his 2020 loss on the Supers AGAIN! And he WILL LOSE.
907398832434098176 2017-09-11 00:21:54 UTC <Vva10967> @kkondik you still have to clear a 10% threshold to get any delegates so no, it won't be inconclusive. Supers don't overturn the will of the voters.

907266453736493056 2017-09-11 15:35:53 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Too few 2016 takes properly acknowledge that it was the Berners' 3rd party protest vote that made Trump POTUS. He did NOT have enough voters
906938958382329856 2017-09-10 17:54:32 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Also, it's odd that everytime Rick Scott starts speaking Spanish, both CNN and MSNBC switch off covering him!
906938774386552832 2017-09-10 17:53:48 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Like Christie, he sucks as a governor but did a good job with Sandy. But yeah, watching a Tea Party guy speak Spanish is odd.
906926840325066754 2017-09-10 17:06:23 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill How is he going to save it when he's not a member, 4MM more DEM PARTY voters REJECTED his platform AND Trump's voters say he's a Commie???

906904991360802816 2017-09-10 15:39:34 UTC <Vva10967> @GOP @AdamSchiffCA @mikesdebra @Belairviv Trump will NOT be held accountable unless and until the Democrats win the House in 2018. For GOP it's Party over Country. #TreasonousGOP

906903024232263680 2017-09-10 15:31:45 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @dfoley75 No rigging. He was MATHEMATICALLY eliminated after NY but kept milking you for $27 contributions to keep having rallies & applause he loves.

906756625503059968 2017-09-09 05:50:00 UTC <Vva10967> Hey @mattyglesias & @kurteichenwald, THIS from Bernie's book is REALLY whiny & I don't recall you bitching about it??? #sexism #StillWithHerhttps://twitter.com/alex__katz/status/906561085154750465

906277421435023360 2017-09-08 22:05:49 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright @Irish_Pack Voter ID & Russia's meddling w voter registrations kept true Dem voters from casting their ballots & allowed Bernie's Cult 2 make DJT POTUS.
906276397081088000 2017-09-08 22:01:45 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright @Irish_Pack yeah, but the 3rd party protest voters MADE it to the polls AND had the proper ID. They determined the outcome and made Trump POTUS.
906272377738276867 2017-09-08 21:45:47 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright Sexism must be addressed or female candidates for POTUS in 2020 will suffer same fate as Hillary. Sanders & Trump got away with LIES--> men.
906271972010725379 2017-09-08 21:44:10 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright Trump did NOT have enough voters to elect him POTUS. He needed Bernie's Cult to vote 3rd party in swing states to defeat HRC.
906271556237750272 2017-09-08 21:42:31 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright Democratic Party won popular vote. Needs to start acting like it. So much self pity. Trump has NO mandate. Only won because of Bernie's Cult
906271178259562497 2017-09-08 21:41:01 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright Hillary spared Bernie but GOP had a thick opposition dossier on him, with videos and audio, and Trump's nickname for him: Communist Bernie.
906270693939138562 2017-09-08 21:39:05 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright Bernie LOST Primary by 4 million votes. Primary was never rigged.  Bernie lost primary in mid-March & was mathematically excluded after NY.
906270355416809472 2017-09-08 21:37:45 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright Bernie attacks the Democratic Party for his own benefit, for his Revolution. But America is NOT socialist.
906270166891335681 2017-09-08 21:37:00 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright The Democratic party fights for the middle class. It passed Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, ACA. GOP opposed & wants to dismantle all.
906269850212990977 2017-09-08 21:35:44 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright Can't fix problems if we misdiagnose them. We lost because Bernie's Cult voted 3rd party or for Trump to punish HRC. It wasn't the message.
906269601343909889 2017-09-08 21:34:45 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright The Resistance is Female. Hillary's loss woke them up to the fact that the most qualified woman can lose to the least qualified man. #Sexism
906234377209827328 2017-09-08 19:14:47 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica And for that matter, shouldn't she have sued InfoWars and Alex Jones for PizzaGate? And Flynn and son? even just to get their depositions.
906234153225650177 2017-09-08 19:13:53 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica She's a public figure, sure, but Clinton Cash book & Breitbart interview of Erik Prince would still have met malice test of NYT v Sullivan.
906233891060633601 2017-09-08 19:12:51 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica Shouldn't she have sued the authors of Clinton Cash? And Erik Prince and Breitbart? And gotten their depositions in discovery?
906233321071443968 2017-09-08 19:10:35 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica Because Comey went rogue on Black Lives Matter & policing too but didn't go rogue on @EricHolder. He should have been fired then.
906232857219227648 2017-09-08 19:08:44 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica what's her opinion of (1) how Comey related to Loretta Lynch & Sally Yates (sexism?) & (2) why they let him get away w violating Dept Rules?
906232065464651777 2017-09-08 19:05:36 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica Trump projects. Was claim that he may not accept results a trick to ensure she would concede & not challenge election lost by <78,000 votes?
906231652107653121 2017-09-08 19:03:57 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica what did their internal polling show about Berners protest voting 3rd party or for Trump in the swing states?
906231327346892802 2017-09-08 19:02:40 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica were the classified emails discussions with her staff on how to deal with NYT front page stories on CIA drones program?
906230925062795264 2017-09-08 19:01:04 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica maybe she covers this in her book, but why didn't she do the large rallies in the general? The demand to see her was there. Events sold out.
906230586876076033 2017-09-08 18:59:43 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica why are the tickets to her book tour so high?
906230233073844225 2017-09-08 18:58:19 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica @PilotJz Because she doesn't want Bernie to crash us in 2018 since that's the last fair election we would have if GOP wins.
906229864310738944 2017-09-08 18:56:51 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica What does she think of Steele Dossier's claim that release of hacked DNC emails was quid pro quo 4 changing RNC platform on Russia-Ukraine?
906229555056267264 2017-09-08 18:55:37 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica What does she think of Steele Dossier's claims that Dem Party was infiltrated too?

906222688452136960 2017-09-08 18:28:20 UTC <Vva10967> @daralebrun @JustAGurLnSwedn Bernie has made up a false narrative to fit & boost his socialist agenda from the 1960s & conveniently leaves out how he pays for it.

906040592328646656 2017-09-07 06:24:45 UTC <Vva10967> @sahilkapur Sanders is a cancer on the Democratic Party and needs to be exposed and removed so the Democratic Party can heal back and win in 2018.
906039097713582080 2017-09-07 06:18:48 UTC <Vva10967> @sahilkapur She lost with @SenSanders' help. He even helped Putin weaponize hacked DNC emails with rigged election lie. He should be investigated.

905568976230600705 2017-09-06 23:10:43 UTC <Vva10967> @JaredHuffman And Bernie came up with that narrative AFTER Russia did the hacking but before it went public with them on Wikileaks. #InvestigateSanders

903099733480271872 2017-08-30 03:38:49 UTC <Vva10967> @Gus_802 @GrapefruitCorey if you mean Medicare, that's not really single payer. People like it because of Medicare Advantage. W/O it's like a Bronze Obamacare Plan.

902377249235722241 2017-08-28 03:47:56 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @SimonBooks The button to request a city isn't working!!! How about Princeton NJ?

902361881888903168 2017-08-28 02:46:52 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @mcrumr @troysgirl @oldstony @austin_cis The richest states are blue. The poorest are red. The economy also does better when the POTUS is a Dem and TANKS when the POTUS is GOP.

901964305108742144 2017-08-27 00:27:02 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @pursemonkey5 @jeffersonsheir @leftcoastlefty5 You're still falling for Jared Kushner's propaganda. The judge didn't admit anything. He wrote a summary judgment order to dismiss.
901963838995795968 2017-08-27 00:25:11 UTC <Vva10967> @cornellbelcher you are so polite.

901926702821060608 2017-08-27 21:57:37 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @GovHowardDean @MrDunes Even Obama would have voted for it IF he had been a US Senator in 2001 (he wasn't) AND if the city attacked had been Chicago instead of NYC.
901926427959971841 2017-08-27 21:56:32 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @GovHowardDean @MrDunes 77 US Senators voted for the Iraq authorization, including Kerry and Biden. Why is she the ONLY one blamed? #Sexism #Misogyny
901922677404917760 2017-08-27 21:41:37 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @GovHowardDean @MrDunes Not to mention that during 9/11 *I* & ALL OF WALL STREET WATCHED HER come to the aid of NYC & get the money to rebuild it & be 100% hands on
901921980965953536 2017-08-27 21:38:51 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @GovHowardDean @MrDunes Those people are busy and only events like speeches by HRC or Barack Obama will make them go to the bankers' HQs. HRC & BO R like Rock Stars
901921281997774848 2017-08-27 21:36:05 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @GovHowardDean @MrDunes oh please.  I LIVED AND WORKED IN NY.  Wall Street makes money by attracting busy, wealthy people to their offices who have $$$ to invest.
901920974857269248 2017-08-27 21:34:51 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @GovHowardDean @MrDunes Even Bernie when he was still a decent human being back in February of 2016 objected to the speech slanders. But then ambition corrupted him
901920737388310531 2017-08-27 21:33:55 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @GovHowardDean @MrDunes You only know what she gets paid per speech because she's the most transparent candidate for POTUS EVER & has disclosed 40 yrs of tax ret'ns
901919438915731457 2017-08-27 21:28:45 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @GovHowardDean @MrDunes As to Bernie, I wouldn't go listen to him even if someone paid ME. And it would be ILLEGAL for a sitting US Senator to get paid.
901919102729674752 2017-08-27 21:27:25 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @GovHowardDean @MrDunes Obama will too, no matter how much the haters and losers whine about it.  The man can sell out a stadium.
901918751968423937 2017-08-27 21:26:01 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @GovHowardDean @MrDunes & she got paid really well because people ADMIRE HER FOR HER CAREER AND LIFELONG ACCOMPLISHMENTS & she sells out the functions that hire her
901918430672146436 2017-08-27 21:24:45 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @GovHowardDean @MrDunes Paying a former POTUS or Sec of State to give a speech isn't illegal or abnormal, except in Bernie's mind. HRC gave over 100 paid speeches.

901833885427912705 2017-08-27 15:48:48 UTC <Vva10967> @AynRandPaulRyan The comparisons to a child avoid the truth: that he is an old man with dementia who can't tell reality from fiction & believes the Fox Cult.
901831943146393601 2017-08-27 15:41:05 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @GovHowardDean @Ellahbie He was ordered to send back some by the FEC. We can't tell if he did because he never filed final FEC report. Used loophole to avoid filing.

901827886814035969 2017-08-27 15:24:58 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump yeah, let's do that. THAT will show Rural America what a mistake you were & are. You'll tank their economies BIGLY. But hey they were warned
901827474769805313 2017-08-27 15:23:19 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump actually they have, it was called Katrina. And you are 1000X more inept than GWB so that isn't comforting at all.

901669280386863104 2017-08-26 04:54:43 UTC <Vva10967> @mikefarb1 How so? Wouldn't clock have run out anyway because Clinton campaign didn't want to challenge the results?
901667301371645953 2017-08-26 04:46:51 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @GovHowardDean And Steele Dossier says Dem Party WAS infiltrated. Tulsi Gabbard should be investigated too. The timing of her DNC departure is suspect IMO
901666768724398080 2017-08-26 04:44:44 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @GovHowardDean Remember that Tad Devine worked with Paul Manafort in Viktor Yanukovich's Ukraine campaign so ties must be scrutinized too.
901665401398059008 2017-08-26 04:39:18 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @GovHowardDean without Bernie's claim that Primary was rigged, Putin would not have been able to weaponize hacked DNC emails Russia already had.
901664855496826881 2017-08-26 04:37:08 UTC <Vva10967> @GovHowardDean And hopefully Mueller's investigating @SenSanders too. Was Russia pumping his campaign w small $$$ donations that didn't have 2 be itemized?
901664376628932608 2017-08-26 04:35:14 UTC <Vva10967> @GovHowardDean Like Trump, Jill Stein didn't release her tax returns.

901611456982130689 2017-08-26 01:04:57 UTC <Vva10967> @GovHowardDean Had @BernieSanders not helped Russia weaponize DNC emails it already had in its possession by claiming election was rigged HRC would've won.

901469791789166592 2017-08-26 15:42:01 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias @ZoeSugarQueen Yet she did it because it was the right thing to do, because she has stood up against discrimination & racism since listening to MLK in 60s.

900819600442617861 2017-08-24 20:38:23 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh But will MSM ever ask WHY & HOW did Bernie come up with the "election is rigged" narrative that Russia NEEDED to weaponize the DNC emails?

898347384861634560 2017-08-17 00:54:41 UTC <Vva10967> @Indivisible_EDH @HawaiiDelilah @lorelilee18346 They are not. They, like Trump, lack a moral compass. It's not like he didn't show us who he was during his campaign.
898297795186016256 2017-08-17 21:37:38 UTC <Vva10967> @chucktodd & YOU'll be doing full hour reports on @MeetThePress that prove GOP hates her, right? Your OWN hate of Hillary becomes self-fulfilling, no?
898296182656651264 2017-08-17 21:31:14 UTC <Vva10967> @chucktodd Maybe if people in the media like YOU had not engaged in false equivalencies & had investigated Trump instead he wouldn't be POTUS now.
898295520027975680 2017-08-17 21:28:36 UTC <Vva10967> @chucktodd No. She lost because the BernieBusters hated her more than they loved our country & voted 3rd party in swing states to avenge St Bernie.
897942017510187014 2017-08-16 22:03:54 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump yeah, Heather Heyer will be remembered as the first victim of the hate that you and your campaign brought back.
897872667579174914 2017-08-16 17:28:20 UTC <Vva10967> So @facebook got Trump elected?https://twitter.com/bbcstories/status/897518270349058049

896041185994829825 2017-08-11 16:10:41 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem He (Bernie) is wrong as usual, but not deranged like Trump to be advocating nuking North Korea as Trump is doing now.

895327806703378433 2017-08-09 16:55:58 UTC <Vva10967> @brhodes Trump is (AGAIN!) taking credit for something Obama did:http://www.politicususa.com/2017/08/09/trump-falsely-takes-credit-obamas-nuclear-modernization-plan.html
895143298700120064 2017-08-08 04:42:48 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN Because Trump believes all states having opioid epidemies are nothing but drug infested dens.
895103480586805248 2017-08-08 02:04:34 UTC <Vva10967> @JoshSchwerin @politico Doesn't the headline make it sound like Feds caught a Clinton Foundation donor doing something improper when the opposite is true?
895101681054220288 2017-08-08 01:57:25 UTC <Vva10967> @jmpalmieri @barryparmet only if we win the House in 2018.  The Republicans won't impeach him. For them, it's party over country.
895101469359255552 2017-08-08 01:56:35 UTC <Vva10967> @jmpalmieri I suppose they could do it again in 2020 since they're already attacking Kamala & Cory but we now know what to expect & can plan for it.
895100889517760513 2017-08-08 01:54:16 UTC <Vva10967> @jmpalmieri yeah but Trump didn't have enough voters to elect him POTUS in 2016. The BernieBusters made Trump POTUS w their 3rd party protest votes.

894763666318295040 2017-08-07 03:34:16 UTC <Vva10967> @gdebenedetti just like they got Donald Trump elected POTUS. Trump didn't have the numbers to get elected. Berners tilted the scales and made him POTUS.
894763427398275072 2017-08-07 03:33:19 UTC <Vva10967> @gdebenedetti The problem is not the primary, they don't have the numbers to affect the outcome. The problem is that they'll get the Republican elected.
894662564516331520 2017-08-07 20:52:32 UTC <Vva10967> @AwardsDaily He won't. Trump's base isn't large enough 2 elect or reelect him. He won bc of the Berners. Now we know they'll backstab us & can plan 4 it.
894596905203847169 2017-08-07 16:31:37 UTC <Vva10967> @AwardsDaily They were all fake scandals. Trump's RussiaGate is real.

894591881379815424 2017-08-07 16:11:39 UTC <Vva10967> @Amy_Siskind Thiel's Palantir also played a key role in Trump's election, helping Cambridge Analytica sort the data they had collected.

894247644532441088 2017-08-06 17:23:47 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou Weird no? And he also came up with "election is rigged" narrative that allowed Moscow to weaponize DNC emails Russia ALREADY had hacked...
894074832203198464 2017-08-05 05:57:05 UTC <Vva10967> @moonpieluva @WindyCitySoft @bravenak Trump didn't invent the racism & hate he ran on, he merely exploited what the GOP has been brewing since Nixon's Southern Strategy.

892786353536159745 2017-08-02 16:37:08 UTC <Vva10967> Yes, because the Republican Party is now a White Supremacist Party. The seed was planted when Nixon adopted the Southern Strategy.https://twitter.com/JoyAnnReid/status/892777267922968576
892784278286868480 2017-08-02 16:28:53 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden To Make America White Again, of course, which was always was his MAGA slogan really meant.

891886757595279360 2017-07-30 05:02:28 UTC <Vva10967> @MichaelEMann @Edrouant Actually we did. When Gore lost. But then people forgot about it and thought it was a fluke. It wasn't.

890303178192891908 2017-07-26 20:09:53 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @LadyTetta THAT was the party's mistake that cost us the election and not the bullshit that @SenSchumer is saying now about Dem Party message.
890302790924476418 2017-07-26 20:08:21 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @LadyTetta Neither did Obama. That point was crossed in Mid March & for sure on 4/20 after NY. But Dem Party continued trashing of HRC by Bernie.
890301701542031360 2017-07-26 20:04:01 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @4alarmsafeplace No one is saying that she's the Democratic Party's savior. But she isn't out to destroy the party either, like Nina Turner & Bernie Sanders.
890227463250489345 2017-07-26 15:09:01 UTC <Vva10967> Hey @realDonaldTrump did you not know what the T in LGBT stood for???https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/742771576039460864
890087263140491268 2017-07-25 05:51:55 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 That doesn't make her the equivalent of Bernie. For one, she is a Democrat and doesn't want to burn down the party like Bernie & his cult do

890084474326843393 2017-07-25 05:40:50 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 Nina Turner is the female Bernie.
890084256713715712 2017-07-25 05:39:58 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 No. Warren fully supported Hillary on the campaign trail. Told audience HRC was a good person w good heart. Bernie didn't. Only attacked DJT
890081956901396481 2017-07-25 05:30:50 UTC <Vva10967> @flipflop4u2 @JoyAnnReid And the man who lost the popular vote by 3 million will sign it. All bc the BernieBros in the swing states wanted to protest vote on Nov 8.

890055696234029056 2017-07-25 03:46:29 UTC <Vva10967> @BrendanNyhan Trump is an idiot but we all know that. Amazon now collects state sales tax for ALL states. Trump thinks there's a separate "internet" tax.

889932861947695104 2017-07-25 19:38:23 UTC <Vva10967> @jasoninthehouse @greenhousenyt @notary_marian If our drone bombs Iraq or Afghanistan, it falls under Dept of Defense & it's public. If it bombs Yemen or Pakistan it's CIA & "top secret."

889685605831127040 2017-07-24 03:15:52 UTC <Vva10967> @BraddJaffy So @SenJohnMcCain is coming back to take away from other Americans the healthcare that is keeping HIM alive???
889653675785949185 2017-07-24 01:08:59 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 Oh I don't mean as candidate but as POTUS. And Sanders would get defeated in the primary AGAIN. Plus he'll need an oxygen tank to campaign

889581214516097024 2017-07-24 20:21:03 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos @rudepundit @KaraCalavera @mg81992 And it was not effective with the BernieBros & Bernettes who voted 3rd party in swing states to say FU to HRC. THEY made Trump POTUS.
889580867642937344 2017-07-24 20:19:41 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos @rudepundit @KaraCalavera @mg81992 or his message of hate was more effective than Dem politicians & media will ever acknowledge. Because it's an America they don't recognize.
889550589734113280 2017-07-24 18:19:22 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @radum27 with the treasonous Republicans in charge of the hearings, ANYONE Trump names can make it. #TreasonousPotus #TreasonousTrump #TreasonousGOP
889549752668434433 2017-07-24 18:16:02 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos @rudepundit @mg81992 @KaraCalavera I know, if you watch her warnings now, she was 100% right.
889549071098294272 2017-07-24 18:13:20 UTC <Vva10967> @rudepundit @mg81992 @armandodkos @KaraCalavera watching TV & they still voted for him. But in all fairness it was the Berners that made Trump POTUS w their 3rd party votes in swing states
889548694479155201 2017-07-24 18:11:50 UTC <Vva10967> @rudepundit @mg81992 @armandodkos @KaraCalavera So voters in the swing states didn't learn that he was a crook & a grifter. But still, they knew he was a pussy grabber & saw ad w children
889548317096587265 2017-07-24 18:10:20 UTC <Vva10967> @rudepundit @mg81992 @armandodkos @KaraCalavera According to American Bridge both the campaign & the PACs ignored the oppo research on Trump stiffing the little guys & union workers.
889547697673383937 2017-07-24 18:07:52 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos @rudepundit @KaraCalavera @mg81992 perhaps but having lived through 6 months of Trump, shouldn't we have listened??? And no he's NOT getting impeached while GOP controls House
889547335214170112 2017-07-24 18:06:26 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer Trump won & @HillaryClinton lost because Dem leadership allowed @SenSanders to trash her. It was 3rd party vote in swing states.https://twitter.com/rudepundit/status/889487159039807488
889545370115690499 2017-07-24 17:58:37 UTC <Vva10967> @JoshuaGreen @yottapoint In every single swing state that @HillaryClinton lost, the protest vote 4 JIll & Gary swelled & exceeded the margin by which Trump won state
889542982906544128 2017-07-24 17:49:08 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Because @HillaryClinton is NOT Crooked, YOU ARE. The Russians helped YOU win, because your people said you'd lift their US sanctions.

889363607317884928 2017-07-23 05:56:22 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill @18major @CcitySuave27 He protested in college like all good hippies of his generation did, and moved to white VT and never lifted a finger again to help blacks.

889277104969396225 2017-07-23 00:12:38 UTC <Vva10967> @CapehartJ unless they're angry at blacks, gays, immigrants, muslims, asians, refugees & a guy named Barack Obama....which is WHY they voted for Trump.
889261713589227520 2017-07-23 23:11:28 UTC <Vva10967> @iowademocrats @Lee_in_Iowa @AndreaJPhillips Yes, both are Obama districts that flipped to Trump.
889259124109783041 2017-07-23 23:01:11 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @SenSchumer @neeratanden Because we're the nice party that goes high when Republicans go low??? F*CK THAT! Unless & until we learn to go subterranean, we'll lose!
889258702120906752 2017-07-23 22:59:30 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer @neeratanden & Dems in power let the FBI go rogue on @HillaryClinton knowing Comey had violated DOJ rules in making his July 5th presser & said NOTHING!
889258157083643905 2017-07-23 22:57:20 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer @neeratanden The Republicans stood by their pussy-grabber-in-chief. We, Dems, let our superbly qualified candidate be trashed by the media & by Trump.
889257453703057410 2017-07-23 22:54:33 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer @neeratanden or that Dems let Bernie convince his followers that HRC was corrupt? or that Dems went along w media narrative that she was "flawed"?
889256587487055872 2017-07-23 22:51:06 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer @neeratanden or that Obama's timing with TPP hurt her with Rust Belt voters? or that Dems were NEVER able to defend the ACA until Trump was sworn in?
889256130702127108 2017-07-23 22:49:17 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer @neeratanden or that standing up 4 common sense gun legislation was risky? or that taking the side of BLM & Mothers of the Movement was offensive to WWC?
889250926531366913 2017-07-23 22:28:37 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer @neeratanden At what point do we say that she lost because she didn't appeal to white nationalism & didn't trash Obama LGBT or immigrants like Trump did?
889250334954192897 2017-07-23 22:26:15 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden But shouldn't @SenSchumer be saying the same thing about the 16 Republicans that Trump beat in the primary?
889249062310039554 2017-07-23 22:21:12 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump If they protected you more we'd have to try them for treason.
889248337635024900 2017-07-23 22:18:19 UTC <Vva10967> @BettieRose100 @peterdaou If ALL Dems had defended Hillary like the Repubs defended Trump and had stopped Sanders from trashing her during the primary she'd be POTUS.

889196118357180418 2017-07-23 18:50:49 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod but consistent with the Party of Trump (the one formerly known as the GOP).
889191872580767744 2017-07-23 18:33:57 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein @DonaldJTrumpJr @AlexMohajer And Jill, like Moscow Mike Flynn, attended RT Dinner with Putin and sat at his table.
889189348700295169 2017-07-23 18:23:55 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein @DonaldJTrumpJr @AlexMohajer Jill even showed up at the Democratic Convention to rally Berners against Hillary and didn't release her own taxes either. #UnexplainedMoney

889188649669201922 2017-07-23 18:21:09 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein @DonaldJTrumpJr @AlexMohajer The Senate Intelligence Committee (in addition to Judiciary one) should request list of ALL communications between Jill Stein and Russians.
888928103610843136 2017-07-22 01:05:50 UTC <Vva10967> @peterbakernyt @maggieNYT Apples & Oranges. Republicans then were demanding Bill's head over a blow job. Republicans now are silent over collusion w Russia & treason.
888926982947442688 2017-07-22 01:01:22 UTC <Vva10967> @GovHowardDean And yet Comey thought that telling us about emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop was more important than telling us about Russia's interference
888818064296378369 2017-07-22 17:48:34 UTC <Vva10967> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump So if China is NOT a currency manipulator after all, what the hell is keeping you and @IvankaTrump from making YOUR products in America???
888817680668667905 2017-07-22 17:47:03 UTC <Vva10967> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Funny, those soldiers have your age.  Imagine, you too could have served our country if you hadn't dodged the draft with your phony injury!

888791772268306435 2017-07-22 16:04:06 UTC <Vva10967> @JKH2 and yet, there is ONE woman who happens to live in Chappaqua who has the expertise and knowledge to fix what Trump has broken....
888791348551221248 2017-07-22 16:02:25 UTC <Vva10967> @RepAdamSchiff Pompeo must have taken Trump's Loyalty Pledge.

888788868631326720 2017-07-22 15:52:33 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump So are you saying that Trump Jr. will release ALL his PERSONAL emails? because that's what the 33K emails that you talk so much about were.
888623765596360704 2017-07-21 04:56:30 UTC <Vva10967> @CierPR @InSpiteOfTrump @peterdaou @Maxiesid Least he could do. His slanders of Hillary is what got Trump elected. And he knows they were slanders.

888616395256332288 2017-07-21 04:27:12 UTC <Vva10967> @AshleyRParker @SpinDr @dan_schrader @cheeto_goblin @chad_lamar Yeah but like Obama said back in 2008 they cling to their guns and their religion instead. And they're brainwashed by Fox.
888547998288019456 2017-07-21 23:55:25 UTC <Vva10967> @AshleyRParker @SpinDr @chad_lamar @dan_schrader @cheeto_goblin Yes but GOP Senators are traitors and put party above country. They have enough votes to approve Putin's Puppet's AG choice.

888502412394328064 2017-07-21 20:54:17 UTC <Vva10967> Hey @CNN @nytimes @washingtonpost @NBCNews @CBSNews @ABC maybe destroying @HillaryClinton's POTUS candidacy wasn't good business after all?https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/888440197649747972
888268283698233344 2017-07-20 05:23:56 UTC <Vva10967> @grandoftwo @MrDane1982 @pennyw503 Pelosi then resigns as POTUS 46 and goes back to being Speaker and HRC becomes POTUS 47 and the 2 fix the damage caused by Trump.
888267273583992833 2017-07-20 05:19:55 UTC <Vva10967> @grandoftwo @MrDane1982 @pennyw503 I think Trump lasts until Dems take back the House in 2018 and Pence gets impeached too so we end up w POTUS Pelosi who names HRC as her VP
888265136850391042 2017-07-20 05:11:26 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu But is a pardon issued by an illegitimate POTUS valid if it turns out that Russia hacked voting and/or tallying machines in swing states?
888263444721311744 2017-07-20 05:04:43 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost Also the Russian disinformation campaign was aimed at the Berners not at the Trumpers & it was the Berners who protest voted  electing DJT.
888262814778834944 2017-07-20 05:02:12 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost We don't know if the voting and/or tallying machines in the swing states were hacked because DHS refuses to find out & hasn't examined any.
888260755027394561 2017-07-20 04:54:01 UTC <Vva10967> @PreetBharara @Dr_G_Enigma NYAG can strike at any time. Before or after pardons since Trump pardons would only apply to federal crimes. State crimes fall under Cuomo.
888259708926124032 2017-07-20 04:49:52 UTC <Vva10967> @dollyp724 Actually it was the BernieBros with their 3rd party protest votes in the swing states that elected Trump. He didn't have enough Deplorables.
888258453713465344 2017-07-20 04:44:53 UTC <Vva10967> @AwardsDaily Don't be too sure. It's Mueller time. He and his team don't have sacred cows. And Russian money was likely pouring into Bernie's campaign.
888216876211462144 2017-07-20 01:59:40 UTC <Vva10967> @thedailybanter @AwardsDaily They need to add Bernie who came up w the "rigged election" soundbite that Putin needed to weaponize DNC emails already hacked.
888134602124136448 2017-07-20 20:32:44 UTC <Vva10967> @elonmusk Verbal approval from @realDonaldTrump?
888133889255931905 2017-07-20 20:29:54 UTC <Vva10967> @BraddJaffy Trump has got to have Alzheimer's and no one in the media dares to say it. It runs in his family. His dad had it. He is showing the symptoms
887917203382820864 2017-07-19 06:08:52 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @KaraCalavera Lol. Same here. DVR'd Rachel and saw Joy had filled in for Chris so I'm recording the 3 am repeat of All In 
887843943622356993 2017-07-19 01:17:46 UTC <Vva10967> @KatyTurNBC Hey @realDonaldTrump we should have a new Presidential election, no? Kobach says we will never know if you won the swing states on Nov 8.
887843275788480513 2017-07-19 01:15:06 UTC <Vva10967> @KatyTurNBC So 3 Million people voted illegally?  if so, I bet it was in the Red States and @realDonaldTrump is an ILLEGITIMATE PRESIDENT!
887836243551289344 2017-07-19 00:47:10 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Frankly, any New Yorker could tell you the same thing. It wasn't a secret. 
887833474123673602 2017-07-19 00:36:10 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon However he changed after the 2008 election, could never get over his bitterness against Obama for having defeated him. Yet HE picked Palin.
887831183626821633 2017-07-19 00:27:03 UTC <Vva10967> @GovHowardDean I think he's been suffering from Alzheimer's for a while (since at least 2011) and no one dares to say it.  But it runs in his family.
887830329431666688 2017-07-19 00:23:40 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @erlaz @orangefuzzz @SenorElNegro ...we really should go subterranean. The "going high" has lost us over 1000 seats, including the SCOTUS seat and given us Trump.

887186135373447168 2017-07-17 05:43:52 UTC <Vva10967> @NewDay Trump voters embraced who he is and what he represents. The very worst of America. A grifter. A pussy grabber. A racist. A swindler. A liar.

882291662118113280 2017-07-04 17:34:59 UTC <Vva10967> @newrepublic If @SenSanders had dropped from primary when it was mathematically impossible 4 him to win & not SLANDERED HRC, country & ACA would be safe.

881998410420809728 2017-07-03 22:09:42 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders Great to see you adopt @HillaryClinton's plan for Medicare expansion. It's the right thing to do. Too many lives at stake to play games.
881988306136961028 2017-07-03 21:29:33 UTC <Vva10967> @POTUS @tedlieu @CNN keeps coming up with idiotic headlines. Tom Arnold says Trump met Putin in 2013 at a party that was also attended by NBC Executives.

881394644973740032 2017-07-01 06:10:33 UTC <Vva10967> @kdrum @KenDilanianNBC knowing those emails had been stolen by the Russians. You all didn't care. You also reported the Comey Oct 28th letter 24/7, weaponizing it
881393689607667712 2017-07-01 06:06:45 UTC <Vva10967> @kdrum @KenDilanianNBC And you all chose to report the contents of the hacked DNC & Podesta emails 24/7 as the useful idiots Russia needed to weaponize them /4
881392382398353408 2017-07-01 06:01:34 UTC <Vva10967> @kdrum @KenDilanianNBC You then all failed to tell people that the 3 emails with the (c)s were telephone scripts where she congratulated heads of state. /3

878366566135480320 2017-06-23 21:38:03 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid but if the cost shifts to the states, his constituents' STATE taxes will go up, probably by a lot.

877576040507375617 2017-06-21 17:16:47 UTC <Vva10967> Hey, now all those Trump voters in coal country and in the Rustbelt that were promised jobs by Trump can move to Kansas! Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!!!https://twitter.com/BW/status/877193023469355010
877568257988939776 2017-06-21 16:45:51 UTC <Vva10967> @daveweigel The attention the race got nationally as a referendum on Trump is what sank Ossoff by attracting all that GOP PAC money. It wasn't 1:1 match
877566898790998016 2017-06-21 16:40:27 UTC <Vva10967> @FightingMad1 @davidfrum Not just any cake, Mar-A-Lago chocolate cake. Most beautiful cake.
877391114529116160 2017-06-20 05:01:57 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein Or more likely that we need to intensify voter registration efforts between now and Nov 2018 & maybe challenge ID law.
877379331701354496 2017-06-20 04:15:08 UTC <Vva10967> @harrisonjaime and this close result in SC-05 proves that you are right when you say that SC can be competitive is Dems invest money there.
877379163337797632 2017-06-20 04:14:28 UTC <Vva10967> @harrisonjaime it looks good for 2018 though. GOP won't be able to invest the high amounts they invested in these 4 special elections in 2018.
877376784265879552 2017-06-20 04:05:00 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias So if Dems take the House in 2018, will you publicly apologize to Nancy Pelosi for acting like a sexist pig?
877374912779964416 2017-06-20 03:57:34 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid They abstain because they want to fall in love.  Republicans fall in line, whether or not they like their candidate, and thus they win.
877374253355724801 2017-06-20 03:54:57 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid that they engaged in voter intimidation & threatened 2 jail group doing  registration & that they implemented CrossCheck to throw people off
877373841789636609 2017-06-20 03:53:19 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid You also ignore that Handel as Sec of State worked to defranchise voters, that they lost thousands of voter registration forms,
877373643638136832 2017-06-20 03:52:32 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid You assume that the Dems that live in GA-06 are Socialist BernieBots like you and not Center-Right Dems.
877372654310838276 2017-06-20 03:48:36 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden When they go low, we need to go subterranean. We really need to stop being the "nice" party.Republicans keep pushing and crossing all lines.
877371649619664897 2017-06-20 03:44:36 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid And Ossof did well considering how much money was thrown by GOP to defeat him because GA-06 race was made into a Referendum on Trump.
877371402327695361 2017-06-20 03:43:37 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Medicare-For-All has issues.  People in GA-06 understand that. They don't just go for logos like you Berners do.
877370799321174016 2017-06-20 03:41:13 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid The GA-06 IS a GOP district. Over half the people there have college degrees. They're NOT making minimum wage, they care about tax rates.
877369850498236416 2017-06-20 03:37:27 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @PracticalLefty Not to burst your bubble, but we don't have a Great Depression with 50%+ unemployment caused by the GOP POTUS to make everyone flip tribes.
877369129329508353 2017-06-20 03:34:35 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @saysthepea The SC race was surprisingly close.  2000 votes. A voter registration could flip it.
877368561324277760 2017-06-20 03:32:20 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid The country is center. Has been for the past oh, 50 years. Even Democrats don't want to be taxed at 90% rates.
877368021035122689 2017-06-20 03:30:11 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid The Republicans do, that's why they keep winning. They fall in line & win & get to implement their awful agenda & strip people's rights.

876558722486734851 2017-06-18 21:54:19 UTC <Vva10967> Hey BernieBusters, this would NEVER have happened in a Hillary presidency. This is on you, YOU elected Trump w your 3rd party protest votes. https://twitter.com/hiphopsrevival/status/876088980697174017
876554194521554945 2017-06-18 21:36:20 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden I don't understand why @TomPerez and the DNC keep appeasing the Young Turks. They are funded by the GOP & keep attacking & undermining Dems.

875214154361061378 2017-06-14 04:51:29 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden The Far Left is as bad as the Far Right.  Bernie & Trump both appealed to angry white men with misogynist tendencies and resentments.

875143920488939520 2017-06-14 00:12:24 UTC <Vva10967> @KaraCalavera @reesetheone1 I think that's a photo of Seth Rich, the DNC staffer that Fox ( Hannity) is claiming was murdered by the Clintons. Far Left believes it too.
875043657031835651 2017-06-14 17:34:00 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Especially Florida. The early vote predicted she would win & GOP has made it impossible to request recounts. And FL was target of hacks.
875043078003929088 2017-06-14 17:31:41 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid And if the GOP knew or found out, they would hide it because they've proven that they will go to ANY length to win & put Party Over Country.
875042818934411265 2017-06-14 17:30:40 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid It's like our government is hiding something and/or is afraid to admit that the vote/tallies could have been tampered with.
875042465312636928 2017-06-14 17:29:15 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Also claim by FBI that hackers didn't change votes or tallies.  No one has stated that machines were forensically examined to prove it.
875042128384188416 2017-06-14 17:27:55 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid If registration rolls were changed by hackers, people would have been forced to cast provisional ballots & I bet GOP states would toss those
875041911303790597 2017-06-14 17:27:03 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid I don't think anyone has looked at the number of provisional ballots rejected in MI WI PA FL & NC? Were numbers unusually high?

874758496608301056 2017-06-13 22:40:52 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @EricBoehlert So Hillary will remain only person in US history dragged through the mud by a rogue FBI Director who found she had NOT committed any crime!
874757831655870464 2017-06-13 22:38:13 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert They also fired Comey so Comey couldn't do to Trump what he did to @HillaryClinton upon concluding the email investigation on July 5, 2016.
874756794886742017 2017-06-13 22:34:06 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump You obviously didn't read the memo Rod wrote so you could fire Comey.  COMEY took the decision away from AG Lynch.

873936789148491776 2017-06-11 16:15:42 UTC <Vva10967> Not surprising that Bernie talks down Obama's achievements. He wanted Obama primaried in 2012.https://twitter.com/jmartnyt/status/873719907615199233

873558886564995072 2017-06-10 15:14:03 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Bernie is not a Democrat. And he LOST the primary by 4 MILLION VOTES. Trump nicknamed him Communist Bernie on the campaign trail.

873414877196554241 2017-06-09 05:41:48 UTC <Vva10967> @daveweigel And Corbyn's party improved its margin but still LOST. May is still the Prime Minister, not Corbyn!
873413988461228032 2017-06-09 05:38:16 UTC <Vva10967> @daveweigel These special congressional elections where Dems improve margins but still lose are confusing you:  Bernie's candidates continue to LOSE.

873401816498806784 2017-06-09 04:49:54 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @StillLes4Hill which contradicts the excuse he gave for sending that October 28th letter.

873285283999084544 2017-06-09 21:06:51 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid We also don't know if hacks altered voter rolls to prompt provisional ballots in MI WI & PA that weren't counted.
873285007279869952 2017-06-09 21:05:45 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid We still don't know how voter registration hacks were used in micro-targeting voters in MI WI and PA.
873283514212528129 2017-06-09 20:59:49 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Sure, May lost her majority, but she's still Prime Minister & Corbyn isn't. Not terribly different than HRC winning 3 million more votes.

873210974240722945 2017-06-09 16:11:34 UTC <Vva10967> @guardian Our Presidential campaign also lasts 18 months, giving enough time to adversaries to trash you. Bernie could NOT survive that long vs GOP.
873210666626232321 2017-06-09 16:10:21 UTC <Vva10967> @guardian And in all other countries, the person with the most votes is the winner of the election.  Not so in the US.
873210386211893248 2017-06-09 16:09:14 UTC <Vva10967> @guardian you also are comparing apples to oranges.  Hillary got 3 million more votes than Trump & because of Electoral College she still "lost".
873210159610441728 2017-06-09 16:08:20 UTC <Vva10967> @guardian We need to educate people in the US so they don't fall again for targeted Russian propaganda but with Fox here that is a higher climb.
873209881263788032 2017-06-09 16:07:13 UTC <Vva10967> @guardian No, they knew better. They were aware of Cambridge Analytical's game & its connection to Putin, the Mercers & Trump thanks to your reporting

873041743968477185 2017-06-08 04:59:06 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @VABVOX @purrfectmusic He presumed her guilty. Was clearly biased and should have recused himself from emails investigation.

872940944047341568 2017-06-08 22:18:34 UTC <Vva10967> @ericswalwell @CatchaRUSSpy Nor has anyone at hearings asked how many provisional ballots went uncounted in MI WI PA FL & NC since Russians hacked voting registrations.
872940161058918402 2017-06-08 22:15:27 UTC <Vva10967> @CatchaRUSSpy On the machines no one at hearings has asked if any machines in WI MI PA FL or NC were forensically examined by FBI. @ericswalwell

872856095211089921 2017-06-08 16:41:24 UTC <Vva10967> @AJentleson He also keeps calling Trump "President Comey" 
872855901371334658 2017-06-08 16:40:38 UTC <Vva10967> @AJentleson Or @SenJohnMcCain is showing signs of senility
872855469685174274 2017-06-08 16:38:55 UTC <Vva10967> @SenJohnMcCain is acting senile. Now he thinks @HillaryClinton coordinated with Russia to sabotage her own campaign!

872690510271569920 2017-06-07 05:43:26 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @IamDaveHobbs The type of people that GS wants to attract to its events will take the time to come when the speaker is HRC or Obama no matter the topic.
872689782190739456 2017-06-07 05:40:32 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @IamDaveHobbs And no, she isn't paid the big bucks for what she is going to say. She gets paid the big bucks for who she is and what she has accomplished.
872688880847343616 2017-06-07 05:36:57 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @IamDaveHobbs You Berners are so dumb. You think speakers like Hillary talk about some secret plot to take over the world when they talk to Goldman Sachs.
872688415472574464 2017-06-07 05:35:06 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily I can't imagine PAYING to go listen to Bernie scream about breaking up the banks and then proceeding to trash the Dem Party.
872687506197753856 2017-06-07 05:31:29 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily Every event that Hillary has spoken at this year has sold out after it's announced that she's speaking there. Same with Obamas.
872686968601280512 2017-06-07 05:29:21 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily To command a large fee, your presence must cause the event to sell out at rather high prices since most are conferences or fundraisers.
872686481223159808 2017-06-07 05:27:25 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily He probably will not. Hillary and Obama are extremely accomplished people. WJC was POTUS.  Bernie is a failed primary candidate & will fade.
872685951973195776 2017-06-07 05:25:19 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @Gregorygurley @NomikiKonst Bernie has Wall Street investments and makes money off them.  Bet there are some banks and "evil" corporations among them.
872685647089348609 2017-06-07 05:24:06 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @IamDaveHobbs The speeches were not secret. You know about them because Hillary has published her tax returns w ALL attachments for the past 30 years.
872643247214137345 2017-06-07 02:35:37 UTC <Vva10967> @isteintraum Have you noticed that you have a lock icon next to your name & that your tweets cannot be retweeted?  Seems Twitter is censoring users?
872562400851111937 2017-06-07 21:14:22 UTC <Vva10967> @yashar @JoyAnnReid @StephenAtHome is going to have fun with Comey's remarks!  
872561225095409664 2017-06-07 21:09:42 UTC <Vva10967> @daveweigel So who is going to fund it? the BernieBros? 
872560592967565313 2017-06-07 21:07:11 UTC <Vva10967> @tedlieu which makes you wonder if Coats and Rogers took Trump's loyalty oath?
871936626515210244 2017-06-05 03:47:46 UTC <Vva10967> @marceelias They shouldn't have voted for Trump. He was clear on where he stood on climate change & on the Paris Agreement.
871935383189192704 2017-06-05 03:42:49 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump maybe you should take a briefing on how cases in general work and how the SCOTUS cases in particular do.
871930583676485632 2017-06-05 03:23:45 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou I hope @HillaryClinton ignores all these a-holes who continue to be afraid of a brilliant woman.We CANNOT let misogyny triumph.#StillWithHer
871888165568737285 2017-06-05 00:35:12 UTC <Vva10967> @KenDilanianNBC @hardball Has anyone gotten info (e.g. via FOIA) on number of provisional ballots that were tossed in the hacked states?
871878968345079808 2017-06-05 23:58:39 UTC <Vva10967> @politico Articles like this make me CHEER when the Orange Fuhrer and Spicer roll you over. You made him POTUS. You deserve him.  #karma.
871878645236867073 2017-06-05 23:57:22 UTC <Vva10967> @politico I wouldn't call male misogynist journos like JOSHUA ZEITZ "a large portion of America". Your journos' ego is as big as Trump's.

871603631698706432 2017-06-04 05:44:34 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost The MSM enabled the election of Trump with your character assassination, misogyny & sexism against Hillary so just stop.
871602151407177728 2017-06-04 05:38:41 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost @LateBloomer111 @demIN240 @LeDivaSandi She's right. While Dems were ahead in data analytics in 2008 & 2012 we are now far behind thanks to the Mercers, Cambridge Analytica & Thiel

871510234514292736 2017-06-04 23:33:26 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro @kewlsense It it now, the Party of Trump.  Too afraid to resist. Willing to sell our country to Russia to get their tax cuts. And they know better.
871509938711011328 2017-06-04 23:32:15 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro No offense but none of those things sounds compelling. Even McCain is having a hard time finding his valor under Trump, all talk, no action.
871505254235467776 2017-06-04 23:13:39 UTC <Vva10967> @jmpalmieri The media so deserves it though.  Like @HillaryClinton said, they treated her email server like Pearl Harbor! They have lots of mea culpas.
871247514330157056 2017-06-03 06:09:29 UTC <Vva10967> @selectedwisdom What's mind boggling is that college educated Republicans voted 4 him. He showed us how ignorant, arrogant & stupid he was during campaign.
871246544246370304 2017-06-03 06:05:37 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou They don't think that poverty or disease are problems. And they can't eliminate terrorism because they need it to frighten their base.

871170918340546560 2017-06-03 01:05:07 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow @JoyAnnReid why does @krystalball hate the Clintons so much?  She blames WJC for deregulation & income inequality that started under Reagan!
870877603758059520 2017-06-02 05:39:35 UTC <Vva10967> @Newsweek Putin probably ordered Trump to do it to prove to Europe that they cannot rely on the US keeping its word anymore. #PutinPuppet
870817384201891840 2017-06-02 01:40:18 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews The media acts like @HillaryClinton is somehow responsible for the > 1000 State & Federal losses Dems took in 2010, 2012 & 2014.
870816817819922435 2017-06-02 01:38:03 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews But what she said it's true, the DNC and the 50 State Strategy that brought Dems back to power in 2006 and 2008 was left to starve for cash.
870813687153610753 2017-06-02 01:25:36 UTC <Vva10967> I would bet that Trump has never opened the Bible and has no clue what's in it. https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/870693471677329409

870679264357568513 2017-06-02 16:31:27 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Like @HillaryClinton said, @realDonaldTrump is temperamentally UNFIT to be POTUS.  True when she said it, true now. #SheWarnedUs
870521966825881600 2017-06-01 06:06:25 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden Have you noticed how the BernieCrats & the Trumpers repeat the same right wing nonsense about Soros? Also about HRC.Hard to tell them apart!
870488829911736320 2017-06-01 03:54:44 UTC <Vva10967> @SethAbramson @danpfeiffer actually I think the reason Syria didn't sign is because they couldn't go to Paris due to sanctions, not because of Accord's terms.
870486592363704320 2017-06-01 03:45:51 UTC <Vva10967> @SethAbramson Is that the sale of the 19.5% Rosneft stake to the secret buyer which Steele Dossier says is Trump's reward for removing Russian sanctions?
870484506083561472 2017-06-01 03:37:33 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper So he touted Obama's accomplishments that Pruitt is trying his best to undo & proceeded to flat out LIE about what HE is proposing 4 future?
870480240879050756 2017-06-01 03:20:36 UTC <Vva10967> @RWPUSA But then again, steel workers in Pittsburgh knew that he was a con artist, Pittsburgh voted for @HillaryClinton and HER vision for America.
870424563133362177 2017-06-01 23:39:22 UTC <Vva10967> Hey @realDonaldTrump Pittsburgh voted for @HillaryClinton and HER vision for America, not yours!https://twitter.com/hardball/status/870422079446945793
870420854089428992 2017-06-01 23:24:37 UTC <Vva10967> @hardball @HardballChris why isn't MSM pointing out the obvious, that Pittsburgh voted for @HillaryClinton NOT Trump? #TrumpIsAnIdiothttps://twitter.com/nkechithinks/status/870416121475854336

870400558787461121 2017-06-01 22:03:59 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert mmm... maybe because he didn't have those factors in his race? When have we had a rogue FBI director & rogue NY FBI office intervene before?
870400085091270658 2017-06-01 22:02:06 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @bradisterrific they don't just rehash it on Twitter, media also does it on cable shows and writing bullshit articles about it.  Didn't do it in 2004.
870290006816034821 2017-06-01 14:44:41 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias They even believe that trump is pro-labor union when he has fought unionization in his own casinos and hotels. But sure, her emails!!!!
870289429251969025 2017-06-01 14:42:23 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Thanks to awful media coverage people in rust belt believe Trump is a successful business man that can bring back jobs and prosperity.
870288887524052992 2017-06-01 14:40:14 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Maybe media should have exposed Trump's multiple frauds & cons & business fails AND ties to Russia instead of obsessing with HRC's emails.

870162312015040512 2017-05-31 06:17:16 UTC <Vva10967> @willmenaker Republicans and especially Trump always, always project. They need to see a shrink!
870145793755414529 2017-05-31 05:11:38 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill I'm waiting for when HRC tells the world in a chat what we all know: that the reason Trump fails is that he's unfit, incompetent & inept.

Bernie's FAR LEFT candidates continue to lose.

Hillary lost the election by 78,000 votes thanks to idiots who voted 3rd party. 66 million voted FOR her.

869791505736757248 2017-05-30 05:43:49 UTC <Vva10967> @rubycramer @edabny54 I miss her too & still feel nauseous when I remember that the pussy grabber is POTUS. Hope Comey burns in hell for having been such a dick.

869439103984705536 2017-05-29 06:23:30 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT @nytimes @RepDonBeyer So establishing a COVERT  COMMUNICATIONS CHANNEL with an enemy of the United States that has just attacked us is now legal? @MalcolmNance
869365737181372417 2017-05-29 01:31:58 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill yes, they also limit the hours that the places that issue drivers licenses are open in areas that are predominantly black, latino or poor.
869365077882830848 2017-05-29 01:29:21 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill so they'll say that a Hunter ID is okay bc most hunters love guns & vote Republican but a college ID is NOT okay bc young people vote Dem
869364303320817664 2017-05-29 01:26:16 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill the Democratic party and civil rights groups have to keep bringing lawsuits against the states but it is a long process that can take years.
869364019014103040 2017-05-29 01:25:08 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill not that hard but they are passing voter ID laws, that say that even if you register, you cannot vote unless you show a specified type of ID
869363653270794240 2017-05-29 01:23:41 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill And our voting laws change from state to state, so all the states that are controlled by Republicans are passing voter suppression laws,
869362825243889665 2017-05-29 01:20:24 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill We agree but the Republican party has discovered that they can only win if they suppress the vote, so they do.
869362143476539393 2017-05-29 01:17:41 UTC <Vva10967> @Freeyourmindkid maybe Raul Castro will offer Trump a hotel in Cuba and change his mind....
869361477412671488 2017-05-29 01:15:02 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill @astrtch2k especially when he is up for reelection in 2018.  He'll want to suppress the vote.
869361282130030596 2017-05-29 01:14:16 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill in the United States the Republican party tries to keep poor people, blacks, latinos, asians & women from voting bc they tend to vote Dem.
869360868945014784 2017-05-29 01:12:37 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill it's not a done deal yet, it still needs to go to their state senate and be signed by their Republican governor who is up for reelection.

869352523819253761 2017-05-29 00:39:28 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @mdeloge 77,759 if you want to be exact: 22,748 in WI, 44,307 in PA and 10,704 in MI.
869352135401627648 2017-05-29 00:37:55 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @mdeloge He even reinforced notion that she couldn't be trusted, often saying You All Will Have To Hold Her Accountable after the election is over.
869351894627561473 2017-05-29 00:36:58 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @mdeloge I listened to his post-convention rallies & he never walked back his slanders of HRC. Message was that Trump was bad, not that HRC was good.
869351511704432640 2017-05-29 00:35:26 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @mdeloge True that most did, but there were enough in MI WI & PA 78,000 to be exact who didn't & protest voted, delivering the Presidency to Trump.
869350320710844416 2017-05-29 00:30:42 UTC <Vva10967> @npfandos @reaDonaldTrump @Fahrenthold and I bet his voters believe it's true no matter what anyone else says!

869348000916803584 2017-05-29 00:21:29 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @IrfanSabrina Actually Dem Governor, not Senator =-) But yes, the problem was Quist who had 16 yrs of unpaid bills. Denise Juneau should have run instead.
869344578830299137 2017-05-29 00:07:53 UTC <Vva10967> @OGTedCruz @levitator1g All he does is attack the Democratic party and use that as a fundraiser. He's said numerous times that he is willing to work with Trump.
869343882185768961 2017-05-29 00:05:07 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @mdeloge Too bad he chose to slander the one candidate who could make that happen. Now next POTUS is going to spend first 2 years fixing Trump's 4.
869343163265298434 2017-05-29 00:02:16 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko I thought his end game was to hijack the Dem Party, turn it into a Socialist party & make us all pander to the WWC men that voted for Trump?
869342635114233858 2017-05-29 00:00:10 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko I hope the article's right & Bernie FINALLY goes away! He cost us the 2016 election with his slanders of Hillary which he NEVER walked back!

869261088113786881 2017-05-29 18:36:08 UTC <Vva10967> @Purify_toast17 A lie that suggests that Bernie's campaign should be investigated by the FBI just like Trump's because it too was infiltrated. /3
869260749314699266 2017-05-29 18:34:47 UTC <Vva10967> @Purify_toast17 A lie that made NO sense but that was made up in May-June, AFTER Russia had gotten the DNC emails. /2

861450377438343172 2017-05-07 05:19:09 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright @Malinasaval Bernie also reinforced notion that HRC couldn't be trusted, telling his audience that after she won they would have to hold her accountable

861449120174755840 2017-05-07 05:14:09 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright @Malinasaval Bernie created false narrative that he lost because the DNC rigged the primary which was the narrative that Putin needed to weaponize emails

857304046608293888 2017-04-26 18:43:07 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon That's because Bernie Slanders convinced his base that giving paid speeches made one a "corporate whore" & never walked it back.

857097236890738688 2017-04-25 05:01:20 UTC <Vva10967> @lpolgreen Because Bernie convinced you that getting paid thousands to give speeches is evil, but it isn't and if HE could give them he would.

856223519440502784 2017-04-23 19:09:29 UTC <Vva10967> @RVAwonk @neeratanden @smenor However it's the truth. You had BernieBros in your camp. They screwed the USA. Only took 78,000 across 3 states. Now Trump will screw them.
856222714297798657 2017-04-23 19:06:17 UTC <Vva10967> @tribelaw Probably not. Palmer isn't reliable, he reads what is in the newspapers and sensationalizes it.

856168448463953920 2017-04-23 15:30:39 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisMurphyCT Let him show the world that Republicans are inept at governing. #IneptGOP If @GOP wants the wall, THEY have to vote for it, not Dems.
856027986335805440 2017-04-22 06:12:30 UTC <Vva10967> @macmcd And if HRC had gone after him he wouldn't be St Bernie today. He needed to be exposed and wasn't.

855955782273290240 2017-04-22 01:25:36 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 they also started trashing HRC in April 2015 based on Clinton Cash, the book that Steve Bannon & the Mercers financed =Right wing propaganda
855954970167971840 2017-04-22 01:22:22 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 you would think she had killed someone the way they were covering the letter! and yet the one under FBI investigation was Trump! #treason
855954695688380416 2017-04-22 01:21:16 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 the media went 24/7 nonstop covering the Comey letter from the moment it came out while Florida and NC were still having early voting. 1/
855953826158923777 2017-04-22 01:17:49 UTC <Vva10967> @bitchyologist especially when THEY, the MSM, HELPED bigly with their sick obsession with her emails and their TOTAL MISS of RussiaGate!
855952625216499712 2017-04-22 01:13:03 UTC <Vva10967> @KaraCalavera @neeratanden maybe you should write a CAP piece explaining to Sanders crowd why healthcare is complicated, they seem to be in same boat as Trump 
855951705841774592 2017-04-22 01:09:24 UTC <Vva10967> @marceelias Didn't principled Republicans go extinct when they nominated Trump in July 2016? principled Republicans is now an oxymoron!

855918708434317313 2017-04-22 22:58:16 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem and Hillary gave him an interview for his podcast (Politico), as did Robby Mook and Jen Palmieri.

855912527468929024 2017-04-22 22:33:43 UTC <Vva10967> @GlennThrush and yet, NYT & other MSM managed to convince the voters that she was untrustworthy & drove her approval ratings from 69% to less than 50%!

855816748909678593 2017-04-22 16:13:07 UTC <Vva10967> And the country back then WAS very much center right. Part of why HillaryCare failed to even get a vote & why GOP had WH for 1980-1992  2/

854535718080827392 2017-04-18 03:22:46 UTC <Vva10967> @StillLes4Hill I think they're referring to the CNN DNC candidate debate where Perez refused 2 say that Sanders was wrong when he said primary was rigged

849121341538226176 2017-04-03 04:47:58 UTC <Vva10967> FBI has not said that they did any forensic examination of voting or tallying machines to back their no tamper claimhttps://medium.com/@keeltyc/russians-didnt-hack-voting-machines-is-fake-news-59846acc286c
849118421761622016 2017-04-03 04:36:22 UTC <Vva10967> @POTUS @SharonJ44257163 @RepSpeier I'm pretty sure Ryan and McConnell would block it and Trump wouldn't sign it. Maybe put efforts elsewhere?
849109902538801152 2017-04-03 04:02:31 UTC <Vva10967> @Newsweek @SenWarren Bernie will alienate your followers too.  And he'll attack you if you take his spotlight like he did with HRC. #HeIsNotADemocrat
849109443858092032 2017-04-03 04:00:41 UTC <Vva10967> @Newsweek Bet @SenSanders will find out that his campaign was as compromised as Trump's when the FBI's investigation is concluded.
849101246128640009 2017-04-03 03:28:07 UTC <Vva10967> @StevenTDennis does @kwelkernbc not realize that Trump has no clue what is in either the ACA or in Trumpcare and has no clue how US healthcare works?

848951430891360257 2017-04-03 17:32:48 UTC <Vva10967> @AriMelber yeah, but Mitch broke the Senate when they decided that Black presidents only get 3/5 of a term & cannot appoint SCOTUS justices in last yr.
848950942795956226 2017-04-03 17:30:52 UTC <Vva10967> @SenatorMenendez you must filibuster Gorsuch. Vote against cloture. TY.
848928442024382464 2017-04-03 16:01:27 UTC <Vva10967> @JasonKander since he ALWAYS projects, makes me wonder if Fox didn't give HIM the questions for the debate that Chris Wallace moderated against HRC?

848920672566956032 2017-04-03 15:30:35 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM did aliens abduct him in 2016 when they REFUSED to give a hearing to Merrick Garland?
848915425136185345 2017-04-03 15:09:44 UTC <Vva10967> @ezlusztig That's too complicated for a one-time event. After Trump is removed, Pence should name HRC as VP and once she's confirmed, step down.

847570912794869760 2017-03-30 22:07:07 UTC <Vva10967> @Amy_Siskind And it's "strange" that they never ask if FBI did a forensic examination of the tallying machines to base claim that they weren't hacked.

847135663023669248 2017-03-29 17:17:35 UTC <Vva10967> @bitchyologist @CindyDPishere they want to hear slogans from old men yelling & claiming that it's easy & not complicated.
847134467294670849 2017-03-29 17:12:50 UTC <Vva10967> @cryanhyde I think that an independent commission WOULD ask the questions & not be afraid of the answers. Even our side seems to be afraid.
847130965654810624 2017-03-29 16:58:55 UTC <Vva10967> @cryanhyde yes until Comey confirms that they've looked at the machines & done forensic examinations I don't see how he can say no tampering

846771891050303491 2017-03-28 17:12:05 UTC <Vva10967> @yashar journalists need to stay on the Russia story & also report on his bad bills. Ignore his tweets & don't treat them as truth.
846771281634709504 2017-03-28 17:09:40 UTC <Vva10967> @yashar that's because they run with his nonsense, instead of calling it out as nonsense and lies from getgo, eg.Obama wiredtapped me tweets

846456845099302912 2017-03-27 20:20:12 UTC <Vva10967> So when this fails, will @SenSanders say "Nobody Knew Healthcare Could Be So Complicated"???http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-progressives-medicare-for-all_us_58d6f5c1e4b03692bea68fd2?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004

846233060421111808 2017-03-26 05:30:58 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT Same with Podesta emails, they came in on October 7th.  Media READ them on the air for days under a headline of BREAKING NEWS.
846232737950453760 2017-03-26 05:29:41 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT Comey's Oct 28th letter came out late in the race & that didn't stop the media from covering it 24/7 as BREAKING NEWS.
846231686799118336 2017-03-26 05:25:31 UTC <Vva10967> @Lawrence not much difference w Hugh Hewitt either yet @MSNBC employs him too? @yottapoint @jonlovett
846230817416339456 2017-03-26 05:22:03 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT @nytimes see, she tried to tell us. Neither the audience nor the media believed her. And she didn't get to Trump-Putin collusion.https://twitter.com/Casey_Clemmons/status/844732315653869572
846227193768411138 2017-03-26 05:07:39 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @JBPNW9 @LaPajamas Yes Tulsi Gabbard was Vice-Chair of the DNC & quit to endorse Bernie on Feb 28 2016. Devine worked w Manafort
846226549493977090 2017-03-26 05:05:06 UTC <Vva10967> The Steele Dossier claims that Russia had "agents/facilitators within the Democratic Party structure itself". @RepSwalwell @RepAdamSchiffhttps://twitter.com/JoyAnnReid/status/846119616078319618
846219881985036288 2017-03-26 04:38:36 UTC <Vva10967> @impeach_d_trump I think she has great integrity but I am troubled by the fact that she COULD have stopped Comey's Oct 28 letter & didn't.
846071247930884098 2017-03-26 18:47:59 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @cryanhyde no one has asked Comey that. And it would have been done by the FBI not the NSA or CIA.
846069342261460993 2017-03-26 18:40:25 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou however no one has asked FBI director if machines were forensically examined to reach that conclusion. Doesn't seem they were.
846068876991500288 2017-03-26 18:38:34 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou I think that if FBI looks, they will also find that Jill Stein's and Sanders' campaign colluded too.
846068138311602181 2017-03-26 18:35:38 UTC <Vva10967> @stphil Unlike Trump, both Sanders and Devine were smart, could count elected delegates & understood presidential primary system. Yet LIED.
846067679995854850 2017-03-26 18:33:48 UTC <Vva10967> @stphil The polarization was done by Sanders. He and Devine KNEW race was over in March, definitely in April but chose to LIE to followers.
846067147570921472 2017-03-26 18:31:41 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN @MSNBC @maddow @JoyAnnReid @Lawrence @jaketapper @msnbc @cnn can you follow up on this story on your shows? Also @nytimes @washingtonposthttps://twitter.com/mattmfm/status/845986821888753664
846066694900629509 2017-03-26 18:29:53 UTC <Vva10967> @stphil @Teknogrot @fawfulfan However Pence was chosen by Manafort. Trump wanted Chris Christie. So he must have some ties to RussiaGate.
846065451356557312 2017-03-26 18:24:57 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan @stphil & Devine worked for Manafort in Ukraine. Both need to be called to testify under oath & their bank accounts investigated.
846064902825545728 2017-03-26 18:22:46 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan @stphil Sanders campaign needs to be investigated too. Their attacks on HRC & DNC coincide w Manafort arrival in Trump campaign.
846064006490140673 2017-03-26 18:19:12 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan @stphil whose malfeasance? Sanders campaign fabricated its rigged lies AFTER DNC had been hacked & Russia knew what was in emails

846017202243485696 2017-03-26 15:13:13 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT maybe at the time the Russian interference felt 2 much like a badly written spy novel so media ignored it? Same w Steele dossier
846016597378711552 2017-03-26 15:10:49 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT the media was too busy reporting on the content of the hacked DNC emails & ignored all reports about their source i.e. Russia. 2/
846016362061418496 2017-03-26 15:09:53 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT it was the media's failure. The information was out there. Look at reports of DNC hack from day 1 of Dem convention. 1/
846014888644415490 2017-03-26 15:04:02 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill @kathleenn & Joe had the same chance of being attacked by Russia in the general election bc he like HRC is pro-NATO & pro-sanctions
846014451996332033 2017-03-26 15:02:18 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill @kathleenn yes, he was on the ballot in 2008 along with Obama & Hillary and lost badly. He would have lost to Hillary in 2016.

845868945991254016 2017-03-25 05:24:06 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill lately every Democratic alpha male wants to throw Hillary under the bus.

845749895755632640 2017-03-25 21:31:03 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou they need to be investigated too. Podesta got hacked in mid March, DNC in summer of 2015 & hackers stayed in system til July 2016
845749352547143685 2017-03-25 21:28:53 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou they also created the "election is rigged" narrative which IS what weaponized the DNC emails & did so in April 2016, AFTER hacks.

845735525445242882 2017-03-25 20:33:56 UTC <Vva10967> @MilitaryTimes @vanambb @YyvetteW agreed but I think Dems in the Senate can stop the VA privatization. Not so with the hiring freezes.

843335621410275329 2017-03-18 05:37:35 UTC <Vva10967> @bigmonkeydick Bernie was on the ballot. He lost bigly (3.7MM) with liberal Democrats voters. Why would Trump's voters vote for a Socialist?
843260154653163520 2017-03-18 00:37:42 UTC <Vva10967> @redsteeze that is true of trade, tariffs, the trade deficit which he seems to confuse with the budget deficit, healthcare, nukes, etc. etc.

842860551223070720 2017-03-17 22:09:49 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @JoyAnnReid @kylegriffin1 I always get the impression that Trump confuses trade deficits with budget deficits. Someone should ask him
842860221114601474 2017-03-17 22:08:30 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @JoyAnnReid @kylegriffin1 Angela Merkel's look when Trump calls the German newspaper "Fake News" is priceless.

842856644128194560 2017-03-17 21:54:18 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid question is, does Kellyanne Conway share Mercer's and Bannon's views on race and white identity?
842856204871393281 2017-03-17 21:52:33 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Also named Bannon 2 Board of Cambridge Analytica so Bannon is his guy. IF Mercer not associated w Putin then Trump has 2 masters
842855702536306688 2017-03-17 21:50:33 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Mercer has been associated w Bannon for a LONG time so not surprising. He financed Breitbart & Clinton Cash book & movie.

842236903491567617 2017-03-15 04:51:40 UTC <Vva10967> @mckaycoppins problem is that Trump gets his "news" and alternative facts from Faux, Infowars and Breitbart.

838556635408760834 2017-03-05 01:07:36 UTC <Vva10967> @AB_Owl @boofontheloose no, Trump would be impeached by the Congress if that happens.  At that point even the GOP would have to impeach him.
838544341618524160 2017-03-05 00:18:45 UTC <Vva10967> @boofontheloose @_Ms_J however Trump would fear Comey will simply spill the beans on him "to get even" if he fires him.

838535060408123392 2017-03-05 23:41:52 UTC <Vva10967> @20committee and if you are ok with it, you are also listening to the bullshit Trump and his allies are spewing about "deep state"

838531486949261312 2017-03-05 23:27:40 UTC <Vva10967> @SarahLerner BUT this forced labor happened under Obama. Case is just going to court. Abuse was consequence of using for-profit prisons.
838531235538427906 2017-03-05 23:26:40 UTC <Vva10967> @BenjaminNorton BUT this forced labor happened under Obama, not under Trump. Case is just going to court. Abuse by for-profit prisons used.
838530494820139009 2017-03-05 23:23:43 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT they would have to admit that he gets his "news" and "evidence" off Breitbart....
838529246968561665 2017-03-05 23:18:46 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid I don't think that's what Comey is saying, just that Obama didn't order the tapping of Trump's phones as Trump claims.
838487119052046338 2017-03-05 20:31:22 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem oh it would have been Comey. I don't think Comey is letting too many people know status of his investigation.
838486162889191424 2017-03-05 20:27:34 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper shouldn't most reporters be looking into his mental insanity instead? 
838484885312524288 2017-03-05 20:22:29 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem in Senate investigation is with Intelligence Committee & Sessions wasn't a part of it & would look odd for him to ask status.
838484608945618944 2017-03-05 20:21:23 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem but investigation is at the FBI level, with Comey, who but for the recusal would have been obligated to update him on status
838483659569102848 2017-03-05 20:17:37 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem who would give him a status report at the FBI or DOJ? They all know he has recused himself from investigation.
838483290407456770 2017-03-05 20:16:09 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem So Comey probably leaked meetings with Russian ambassador, to force Sessions to recuse himself.
838483074258251776 2017-03-05 20:15:17 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem he can't. After recusal, he can't ask questions about investigation & Comey doesn't have to give him status reports either.
838284629211774976 2017-03-04 07:06:44 UTC <Vva10967> Dear media: this is karma. You enabled Trump's election with your false equivalencies, sexism, & relentless email stories about Hillary.https://twitter.com/jenniferjjacobs/status/838166563618435073

836345836896456705 2017-02-27 22:42:40 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro right now Trump still uses a freaking unsecured Android phone and that's ok. If it were HRC, she'd be "extremely careless".
836345578112024576 2017-02-27 22:41:39 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro HRC is "flawed" only because media treats EVERYTHING she does differently. e.g. her emails. W deleted MILLIONS & no one complained
836344167529840642 2017-02-27 22:36:02 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro you don't think that the country deserved to have the most qualified candidate to ever run for that office as POTUS?
836340126997442561 2017-02-27 22:19:59 UTC <Vva10967> Next statement will be: Nobody knew that being POTUS could be so complicated. https://twitter.com/DavidCornDC/status/836238458444115973
836339764173373440 2017-02-27 22:18:32 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou and he's NOT a Democrat.
836338702775435265 2017-02-27 22:14:19 UTC <Vva10967> @leahmcelrath and where exactly does Robert Mercer fit in? He has been enabling Banner for YEARS yet media focuses only on Banner.
836334329542365184 2017-02-27 21:56:57 UTC <Vva10967> @LouiseMensch he certainly has practice.
836328491482288129 2017-02-27 21:33:45 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 He's not a BernieBro, but a NeverTrump Republican. Changed registration to Indep when Trump got nominated but Repub at heart.
836295208262381571 2017-02-27 19:21:29 UTC <Vva10967> Because Republicans in Congress are covering up for Trump and don't want to learn the truth. #RussiaGate #Treason #TreasonousTrumphttps://twitter.com/ananavarro/status/836206887918002177
836294388611448833 2017-02-27 19:18:14 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @DoctrBenway lol that comment applies to Trump's entire Cabinet and to Trump himself!
836244368281354240 2017-02-27 15:59:28 UTC <Vva10967> What the Party of Trump wants us to go back to. http://usuncut.com/news/america-looked-like-epa-cleaned-everything/
836085431380946944 2017-02-26 05:27:55 UTC <Vva10967> @FBI @mmpadellan Bernie's campaign should too. Tad Devine worked with Manafort in Ukraine election of  Viktor Yanukovych.
836049972466442240 2017-02-26 03:07:01 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @Lawrence @JoyAnnReid @jaketapper Robert Mercer's role in 2016 election & ties to Bannon warrant closer lookhttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/robert-mercer-breitbart-war-on-media-steve-bannon-donald-trump-nigel-farage
836049478587142145 2017-02-26 03:05:03 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon @RobbyMook @jmpalmieri @neeratanden I think you underestimated Robert Mercer @TomPerez @keithellison https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/robert-mercer-breitbart-war-on-media-steve-bannon-donald-trump-nigel-farage
836030616747536386 2017-02-26 01:50:06 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 Hell, NO. And she better run as an independent after trashing the Democratic Party!

836027972264022017 2017-02-26 01:39:35 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou Trump's Party wants to perpetuate @BernieSanders's fantasy as to why he lost because that elected Trump. Cult eats it with gusto.
835930610539589633 2017-02-26 19:12:43 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @keithellison needs to have a conversation with @BernieSanders who is helping Trump now just like he helped him in defeating HRC.
835930146775449601 2017-02-26 19:10:52 UTC <Vva10967> @MichaelLaRosaDC the one he originally stole from @HillaryClinton? lol.
835928036210012160 2017-02-26 19:02:29 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Chapter 4 is up!https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/835917294220029953
835926966125592577 2017-02-26 18:58:14 UTC <Vva10967> This is the 4th Installment of the Trump-Russia saga. Read her other 3 pieces tying together the many pieces of the RussiaGate puzzle.https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/835917294220029953
835924691294511104 2017-02-26 18:49:11 UTC <Vva10967> @bannerite his theory is too simplistic. Trump used Mercer's Cambridge Analytica which determined from FB likes who's gullible to fake ads.
835923070787420162 2017-02-26 18:42:45 UTC <Vva10967> @MattBruenig @ahumorlessfem @kaydeelex Seriously. How many voters can even tell you WHO was the DNC Chair from 2001 to 2016? #BernieMyths
835921055420133376 2017-02-26 18:34:44 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper PLEASE stop giving @BernieSanders a mike? He's irrelevant & is Trump's best weapon to destroy Dem party. HE got Trump elected.
835896406950969348 2017-02-26 16:56:48 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @amjoyshow where is @JoyAnnReid??? Show is not the same without her.

835894861706452992 2017-02-26 16:50:39 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN @MSNBC @maddow @Lawrence @amjoyshow @jaketapper @chucktodd @hardball seems to me Trump is confusing Deficit with National Debt?https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/835479283699224576
835894411284348928 2017-02-26 16:48:52 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon He's quoting Herman Cain appearance on Faux & Friends. And I think he's confusing deficit with national debt.
835894100717076480 2017-02-26 16:47:38 UTC <Vva10967> @amyklobuchar if you read in between the lines, WaPo is suggesting that CIA Director Pompeo complied with Trump's orders to downplay story.
835892012436049920 2017-02-26 16:39:20 UTC <Vva10967> @jasoninthehouse @RepCummings So, when can we expect the botched Yemeni raid hearings to start?http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article135064074.html
835891722798399489 2017-02-26 16:38:11 UTC <Vva10967> @politico actually they are almost like Watergate and the suspect acts almost like Nixon, 
835888588952858625 2017-02-26 16:25:44 UTC <Vva10967> From September 2016.  MSM largely ignored the story.https://twitter.com/ericgeller/status/779386469437808640
835724175616716800 2017-02-25 05:32:25 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro @dollyllamaX is just another Hillary-hating NeverTrump REPUBLICAN.  Changed his party affiliation only after GOP chose Trump.
835722138640400384 2017-02-25 05:24:19 UTC <Vva10967> @AndreaChalupa whatever it was, she deleted her tweet.  Too bad @CharlesMBlow didn't shot-screen it.

835716323619532800 2017-02-25 05:01:13 UTC <Vva10967> Trump got his "I reduced the National Debt" nonsense from Herman Cain who said it on Faux & Friends @maddow @amjoyshow @jaketapper @Lawrencehttps://twitter.com/WillOremus/status/835498773623238657
835715412255977472 2017-02-25 04:57:35 UTC <Vva10967> @TheRickWilson is Trump confusing the deficit with the national debt?
835711950206173184 2017-02-25 04:43:50 UTC <Vva10967> @Airport_Lawyer @DFWDetained @robarmstrongjr @Henry_Rousso @painter_nancy @HelpTheLawyers The original story says he was released.
835710838921129984 2017-02-25 04:39:25 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden because it was their pay for trashing Hillary and getting Trump elected?
835710363027009536 2017-02-25 04:37:31 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Midwesterners would also get to experience what is like working without a minimum wage since it doesn't apply to farm workers
835707899552870400 2017-02-25 04:27:44 UTC <Vva10967> @TomPerez_DNC @peterdaou @mexicanfoodfrea agree that DNC should be more hands-off. That way LOSERS can't blame their loss on DNC.
835707519553122307 2017-02-25 04:26:14 UTC <Vva10967> @TomPerez_DNC @peterdaou @mexicanfoodfrea Obviously the ACA wasn't explained well.  Seems people love it now that they can lose it.
835707162735349761 2017-02-25 04:24:48 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @TomPerez_DNC @peterdaou @mexicanfoodfrea Nop, the Dem primary was OVER after NY. @SenSanders LIED to his followers.
835663179808182273 2017-02-25 01:30:02 UTC <Vva10967> @Shakestweetz no, that'd be doing the work without the title. Better if @AlecBaldwin attends in Trump's place & turns it into full SNL.
835662309615861760 2017-02-25 01:26:35 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 it doesn't sound like him, it's missing the "losers, haters and enemies" references that he loves so much.
835661823290507264 2017-02-25 01:24:39 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou even more absurd, they believe his claim that the DNC rigs the primary for its chosen candidate. 
835660778007117824 2017-02-25 01:20:29 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro @damon_musha they were both on the ballot in 2008. Not even close.
835660522313875461 2017-02-25 01:19:28 UTC <Vva10967> @Neukreid1 and apparently you can't read, 
835660054212849664 2017-02-25 01:17:37 UTC <Vva10967> Best Alt-News Site: http://HillaryBeatTrump.org, it reads like The Onion with National Enquirer headlines. Its twitter handle is @potushill 
835596006733533184 2017-02-25 21:03:07 UTC <Vva10967> Today's election in Delaware is for control of their State Senate. Go Vote!https://twitter.com/StillLes4Hill/status/835590297967022080
835595663974989826 2017-02-25 21:01:45 UTC <Vva10967> @gdebenedetti Keith didn't falsely accuse Tom of having rigged the election or of being corrupt nor did he refuse to accept his loss.
835594103349981184 2017-02-25 20:55:33 UTC <Vva10967> @SarahLerner Josh Barro is a NeverTrump Republican so like all Republicans hates Hillary.
835592162863644674 2017-02-25 20:47:50 UTC <Vva10967> @sahilkapur he speaks for the Democratic Party's base. That's how we feel.
835590780353937408 2017-02-25 20:42:21 UTC <Vva10967> Trump White House is violating FOIA. Will law be followed? @jasoninthehouse @RepCummings @NancyPelosi @SpeakerRyan @SenSchumer @SenMajLeader https://twitter.com/getoffmylawn80/status/833405003574317056
835589668779470848 2017-02-25 20:37:56 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro Biden would have lost the primary to Hillary.  We, the Dem primary voters, LOVED HER. Still do.
835589121087270912 2017-02-25 20:35:45 UTC <Vva10967> @imillhiser exactly but the Bernie Cult believes it's the person who rigs the primary & puts in place the candidate of his choice. 
835587325455450117 2017-02-25 20:28:37 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost both Tom Perez and Keith Ellison are liberals. What you meant to say is "in blow to Sanders' hard core followers".
835586568219996160 2017-02-25 20:25:36 UTC <Vva10967> YES!https://twitter.com/gdebenedetti/status/835585702863777794
835586340012056577 2017-02-25 20:24:42 UTC <Vva10967> @markos also the vote in Delaware today for control of that State's Senate matters more than the DNC chair vote!
835584807635681281 2017-02-25 20:18:37 UTC <Vva10967> @donnabrazile will it be made available to the public and media on the DNC website?
835584021350404096 2017-02-25 20:15:29 UTC <Vva10967> @aravosis Hillary lost by less than 78K votes & got 2.86MM more votes than Trump. Bernie Cult is small but very loud. Can be overcomed
835582718826196998 2017-02-25 20:10:19 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @MoElleithee local press was reporting in 2009-14 on efforts by FWs & AFP. Nat Press wasn't so Dems ignored it. Esp. in MI & WI 2
835581868082933761 2017-02-25 20:06:56 UTC <Vva10967> @MoElleithee @peterdaou actually Dems understimated & still do what Freedom Works & AFP did.  That accounts for the 1000 lost state seats. 1
835580328752345088 2017-02-25 20:00:49 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @MoElleithee the RNC didn't rebuild the GOP infrastructure. Freedom Works & AFP did. They supported Tea Party to electoral wins.
835579247502716930 2017-02-25 19:56:31 UTC <Vva10967> @DNC @KaraCalavera @s1_se_puede you can't work with petulant children. They'll be back when they grow up & their "revolution" fades.
835578839656968192 2017-02-25 19:54:54 UTC <Vva10967> @amyzworldamy that's what Trump and his followers say when they make up numbers and facts.,,,OurRevolution barely has 47K followers.
835578183164522498 2017-02-25 19:52:17 UTC <Vva10967> @gdebenedetti curious, how do you get a half vote?
835577546905366529 2017-02-25 19:49:46 UTC <Vva10967> @TagAmericaBlue @ChrisJZullo Bernie's Cult cares because he told them that DNC & DWS made Hillary the candidate. Not true. Voters did.
835577265635409921 2017-02-25 19:48:39 UTC <Vva10967> @TagAmericaBlue @ChrisJZullo Whole thing is silly. No one has ever cared who the heck is DNC Chair, eg. didn't care when Tim Kaine was Chair
835576731998224384 2017-02-25 19:46:31 UTC <Vva10967> @TagAmericaBlue @ChrisJZullo @westernUS2016 DNC's main function is to fundraise, recruit candidates & support local Dem parties. Not policy.
835576275909636103 2017-02-25 19:44:43 UTC <Vva10967> @amyzworldamy LOL where are you getting your numbers? InfoWars??? 
835574411814137858 2017-02-25 19:37:18 UTC <Vva10967> Have fun!  
835573770517622786 2017-02-25 19:34:45 UTC <Vva10967> @Noneya_Mindyers they are loud but not large in numbers.  Look at their OurRevolution handle, barely has 47K followers in 8 months.
835570477670285320 2017-02-25 19:21:40 UTC <Vva10967> @VABVOX do you know if there is a list of who actually votes? i.e. who the 442 are? I can't imagine that Nina & Weaver & Michael Moore vote?
835569298387038208 2017-02-25 19:16:59 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden lol, next thing you know @itomkowiak is going to say that Joe Manchin is a lefty liberal!
835568933038075904 2017-02-25 19:15:32 UTC <Vva10967> the people Sandaron represents lost Democrats the 2000 election and the 2016 one. Time for her to go join Jill for good.
835562855697170432 2017-02-25 18:51:23 UTC <Vva10967> @KaraCalavera @DNC let Berners walk away.  They aren't the Dem party & their #s R actually small. Their "revolution" will fade like Occupy.
835562267425005568 2017-02-25 18:49:03 UTC <Vva10967> @MichaelLaRosaDC Bernie would fade if @MSNBC stops portraying him like he's the savior of the Dem Party. He isn't. You built him like Trump.
835560005776572419 2017-02-25 18:40:03 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou Bernie's so called "Revolution" will fade.  Like Occupy. Even OFA has faded. Hillary endures and persists. #StillWithHer
835557164982878213 2017-02-25 18:28:46 UTC <Vva10967> @JordanUhl @jasoninthehouse of all people uses one, gmail.  Apparently that's ok. Even lists it on his gov business card.
835352429856194561 2017-02-24 04:55:14 UTC <Vva10967> Twitting at 3 AM can be hazardous....http://ktar.com/story/1468093/phoenix-area-teacher-resigns-allegedly-tweeting-killing-immigrants/
835350752797343744 2017-02-24 04:48:34 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid BTW, @OurRevolution has barely 47K followers & has been around since July.  Loud but not big. Bet it dissipates like Occupy.
835349337018359809 2017-02-24 04:42:56 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid what Dems need now is their own Freedom Works which is what trained & supported the Tea Party activists to electoral success. /4
835348565866262528 2017-02-24 04:39:52 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid if Keith wins & follows purist approach, I'm not sure how DNC will fund Keith's initiatives w/ only grass-root donations /3
835347950977040384 2017-02-24 04:37:26 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid its job is organize, fundraise & recruit candidates, not make policy. If Perez wins, will also include defending voting rights.2
835347512605229058 2017-02-24 04:35:41 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid except that the DNC is NOT the all-powerful, king-making entity that Bernie made it out to be.  NO ONE cares what DNC thinks. 1/
835347163005796352 2017-02-24 04:34:18 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid And this is part 2, on Jefferson Sessions and how HE fits into the puzzle:https://patribotics.wordpress.com/2017/02/07/jeff-sessions-attorney-general-suspect/
835347010689564672 2017-02-24 04:33:42 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Her other 2 puzzles are good too.  This is part 1.https://patribotics.wordpress.com/2017/01/17/dear-mr-putin-lets-play-chess-louise-mensch-trump-russia/

835276469718892545 2017-02-24 23:53:23 UTC <Vva10967> @rubycramer frankly I am tired of Bernie's Cult and Weaver and Michael Moore being so dramatic about this. @TomPerez is a great organizer.
835275544547704833 2017-02-24 23:49:43 UTC <Vva10967> @rubycramer @OurRevolution @TomPerez regardless of who wins DNC is not the king-making all powerful institution Bernie made it out to be.
835274385472761856 2017-02-24 23:45:06 UTC <Vva10967> @KaraCalavera NY adores Hillary too. She gets standing ovations everywhere she goes now. Trump would get boo'd in NY.
835207384150781952 2017-02-24 19:18:52 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump may want to read up on the Fall of Richard Nixon... https://twitter.com/tackettdc/status/835205982565371904

835205900596047872 2017-02-24 19:12:58 UTC <Vva10967> I sure hope so.  Only Trump can destroy the GOP at the national level, just like Gov Pete Wilson did in CA implementing Prop 187.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/835204417817362432
835205083893743618 2017-02-24 19:09:44 UTC <Vva10967> @PaulBegala @CNN should continue probing into Trump's Russian ties and bring him down.  Other REPUTABLE news outlets should too.

835029431731249152 2017-02-23 07:31:45 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 the so called progressive left. They gave us Trump with their third party votes.  True progressives would have voted for HRC.
835024588316737536 2017-02-23 07:12:30 UTC <Vva10967> @CarolMerritt @MrDane1982 @MacMargi @LJYanney but in the end the DNC doesn't determine policy except in Bernie's & Cult's mind.
835023901797322752 2017-02-23 07:09:46 UTC <Vva10967> @HuffPostPol @MrDane1982 Ellison however IS a Democrat and will back Perez if Perez wins.
835019641361686528 2017-02-23 06:52:51 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes nah. He IS Putin's Puppet. It's just a matter of when it all comes out.  And what WE THE PEOPLE do about it. #TreasonousTrump
835018756980158465 2017-02-23 06:49:20 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou you forgot Putin and Robert Mercer. Mercer put Bannon & Kellyanne in charge of Trump's campaign when Cruz' sank.

834900276217798661 2017-02-23 22:58:32 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper maybe they are troubled by having to falsify data to please the so-called President?
834899287045734400 2017-02-23 22:54:36 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC and the only reason Trump won is that the Bernie Cult decided that voting third party to punish HRC was more important.
834898133536636932 2017-02-23 22:50:01 UTC <Vva10967> @Evan_McMullin Nunes was part of Trump's transition team, party over country. They need to be voted out in 2018.

834853217724923904 2017-02-23 19:51:32 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid The Resistance must stand up for Warren.  We let the Right (and the media!) trash Hillary while GOP stood by indefensible Trump.
834852510099701760 2017-02-23 19:48:43 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid they always pick a powerful woman, Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton, and now Elizabeth Warren.

834656130408259585 2017-02-22 06:48:23 UTC <Vva10967> @StillLes4Hill or they will find out that the DNC has no power and that Bernie lied to them, lol.

834214496210137089 2017-02-21 01:33:29 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @MaddowBlog alumni of Yanikovich campaign then went MIA during general even as Bernie & Weaver tried to stop Trump. Weird, no? /7
834214337220861953 2017-02-21 01:32:51 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @MaddowBlog and it got the narrative it needed from Bernie's campaign. Russia's target were Bernie's voters, to split Dem party /6

834210509528428544 2017-02-21 01:17:39 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @MaddowBlog Bernie had pledged not to attack HRC personally & to stick to issues, Complied up until March when something changed 2/

833821557600436227 2017-02-20 23:32:05 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou but if Russia had planted someone in Bernie's campaign to attack HRC & DNC & Dem Party & say election was "rigged" = dispositive

833406527750938624 2017-02-19 20:02:54 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs he won because the Far Left voted 3rd party to say FU to Hillary. Our side needs to vote straight Dem & stop being purists. Rs do.

832472823432048646 2017-02-16 06:12:42 UTC <Vva10967> & should've explained that unmarked "classified" emails were discussions on how to answer Qs on CIA drones program story in NYT

832470020500316161 2017-02-16 06:01:34 UTC <Vva10967> & her campaign should have FORCED Bernie to walk back the LIES he told about her & about the DNC & Dem Party & "rigged election"
832469599811538945 2017-02-16 05:59:53 UTC <Vva10967> She should have attacked Bernie back & exposed his flaws when he attacked her personally in March.eg. Sierra Blanca, his writings
832468640469389312 2017-02-16 05:56:05 UTC <Vva10967> She didn't skip PA & I think you meant MI not MA =-) She lost bc she underestimated the 3rd party protest votes of Bernie's Cult.

829758366624915457 2017-02-09 18:26:25 UTC <Vva10967> @docrocktex26 @lilsister7 None of the Dems can do anything in the House. Speaker controls agenda & agencies ignore ranking member requests.

824867053748121601 2017-01-26 06:30:05 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow @JoyAnnReid I think Trump confuses public when he talks about trade deficit, makes it sound like money Mexican Gov takes from USA
824866486560792576 2017-01-26 06:27:50 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow Can U do segment on NAFTA & jobs it created &/or that depend on it? & explain "trade deficit" & invite @paulkrugman?

822165324640436226 2017-01-19 19:34:23 UTC <Vva10967> @TomArnold which one of her former bosses? she's had a few. 
822142860300521472 2017-01-19 18:05:07 UTC <Vva10967> So Women's Rights are Human Rights but @HillaryClinton is left off the list? Seriously?  #WhyWeMarchhttps://twitter.com/KaraCalavera/status/822056479435919361
822126165477519360 2017-01-19 16:58:46 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Or Not.  It assumes GOP Senators would put country over party & that hasn't happened since at least 1/20/2009.
822125929459752960 2017-01-19 16:57:50 UTC <Vva10967> @ThePlumLineGS lol, it assumes that GOP Senators will put country ahead of party, when the opposite has been true since at least 1/20/2009.

821847881871216641 2017-01-18 22:32:58 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid was the Fox guy new? i.e. are they sending a black right wing correspondent to cover Trump?
821845670139142146 2017-01-18 22:24:11 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 had Far Left not voted 3rd party in MI WI & PA to protest HRC, we'd be having a different type of hearing today.
821845200603582464 2017-01-18 22:22:19 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 but he doesn't need Bernie's vote. Dems cannot block Trump's nominees w/o at least 3 GOP Senators voting No as well.
821778958870052865 2017-01-18 17:59:06 UTC <Vva10967> @dailykos @markos @trampslikeus2 we need to take the House of Representatives in 2018 if we want one.  Republicans will cover up for Trump.
821777251373084674 2017-01-18 17:52:19 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias but the 2 Alabama ones were Dixiecrats, no?
821767003711082497 2017-01-18 17:11:36 UTC <Vva10967> @CharlesMBlow is he following Hitler's manual again?
821766058067558400 2017-01-18 17:07:50 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Hope it's HRC. She can just stay overnight at her DC home & headline march next day. Peaceful transfer of power will be over.
821765066081075200 2017-01-18 17:03:54 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @HalicueH @Fleurette15236 No, not unity.  Just the peaceful transition of power that she believes in. March is day after that.
821764632801136641 2017-01-18 17:02:10 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @agustin_hiponia Since AirForce One is taking both Obamas to an undisclosed WARM location where they can catch sleep, I'd say no
821762633166688257 2017-01-18 16:54:14 UTC <Vva10967> @AndreaWNYC too bad the Dem Senators didn't test him to see if he had even read TPP or even NAFTA.  Trump certainly hasn't.
821757538706345984 2017-01-18 16:33:59 UTC <Vva10967> @AndreaWNYC how? you can't find fresh fish in USA even in FL, most of our fish is farmed & imported from Ecuador, Norway or worse, China!

821522664284164096 2017-01-17 01:00:40 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Tom Arnold said on his Twitter feed that Trump met Putin in 2013.
821521928431210496 2017-01-17 00:57:45 UTC <Vva10967> @CoryBooker so will you be boycotting the Trump inauguration? So far no Senator has been brave enough to say that they will. I hope you will

820868025167609856 2017-01-15 05:39:22 UTC <Vva10967> @Fahrenthold you should cover Trump's ties to Russia. Bet you can tie together the pieces of the puzzle from his past & archives.

820175390840856576 2017-01-13 07:47:05 UTC <Vva10967> @brownawell I disagree. Problem with Dems is our leaders have cared more about optics while GOP cares more about winning.

818159236832231424 2017-01-08 18:15:37 UTC <Vva10967> @LOLGOP and somehow Trump has convinced the Far Right that Putin loves evangelicals!

818137705980821504 2017-01-08 16:50:04 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos @reesetheone1 they bought Bernie's "I lost because I was cheated by DNC" nonsense which Russia exploited with hacked emails.

817971311146373120 2017-01-07 05:48:52 UTC <Vva10967> @Khanoisseur @drloisweiner In other words, rule that Dems changed in 2013 will now PREVENT them from blocking or delaying Trump's nominees.
817971018388111360 2017-01-07 05:47:42 UTC <Vva10967> @Khanoisseur @drloisweiner No, it was easy for Republicans because PRIOR to Nov 2013 ANY nominee could be filibustered. Dems changed rule.
817859996352385025 2017-01-07 22:26:32 UTC <Vva10967> @VABVOX @ShaneDalyDP DNC didn't kill his chances. NO ONE cares what DNC does or says. She won because 4 million more people voted for her.
817858302143057922 2017-01-07 22:19:48 UTC <Vva10967> @Khanoisseur @drloisweiner Not as easy. Sen Dems passed nuclear option in Nov 2013 so now only SCOTUS nominees R subject to filibuster.
817857373272502275 2017-01-07 22:16:07 UTC <Vva10967> Bad timing: Since Senate Dems passed nuclear option Nov 2013, ONLY the SCOTUS nominees are subject to filibuster http://politi.co/1aIUuqp

817787945625198592 2017-01-07 17:40:14 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou except that what Russians were exploiting w/ stolen DNC & Podesta emails were myths Bernie created about DWS & "rigged" primary.
817786569557995520 2017-01-07 17:34:46 UTC <Vva10967> Remember this when Trump says that we need to eliminate US regulations that protect our air and water from polluters.https://twitter.com/peterdaou/status/817713289249615872
817631570861375488 2017-01-06 07:18:52 UTC <Vva10967> @therealezway @StillWithHer unfortunately the Dems eliminated the filibuster for all nominations other than SCOTUS justices back in oct 2013

817622754912595968 2017-01-06 06:43:50 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden @HardballChris report however ignores that in Trump Putin also got a Puppet in the White House to lift sanctions against Russia

817620194285780993 2017-01-06 06:33:39 UTC <Vva10967> did FBI go rogue again and kept this out of the report on purpose?https://twitter.com/DavidCornDC/status/817512696442658816

817615973129814016 2017-01-06 06:16:53 UTC <Vva10967> @RepAdamSchiff this too, why didn't IC report look into it? Seems IC skipped the obvious, the collusion between Kremlin & Trump's campaign.https://twitter.com/sarahkendzior/status/817538387053858821
817614481383714820 2017-01-06 06:10:57 UTC <Vva10967> @RepAdamSchiff why didn't IC investigate if Putin had met Trump before? Tom Arnold says they met. Trump said he'd met Putin, then denied it.
817614082186559488 2017-01-06 06:09:22 UTC <Vva10967> @RepAdamSchiff why didn't FBI investigate how Roger Stone w/ Trump campaign was 2 steps ahead of wikileaks disclosures of hacked emails?

817494014169583620 2017-01-06 22:12:15 UTC <Vva10967> @modestpassion yes, bad timing, only nominees subject to filibuster are SCOTUS justices, look:  http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/harry-reid-nuclear-option-100199

817477917903060994 2017-01-06 21:08:18 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion @FiliaultFrance Bernie voted for it. Didn't seem to matter to him back then.  Doubt it matters to him now 4 real.
817477610049601536 2017-01-06 21:07:04 UTC <Vva10967> @modestpassion what can they do? he's about to become the most powerful man in the world, in 2 short weeks.
817476083167666178 2017-01-06 21:01:00 UTC <Vva10967> @modestpassion or just a vested interest in keeping Trump from killing us all and/or collapsing the economy.
817475414054600704 2017-01-06 20:58:21 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion @FiliaultFrance when he was in college & then he didn't rediscover blacks until he ran for POTUS 50+ yrs later 
817418979799105536 2017-01-06 17:14:06 UTC <Vva10967> @modestpassion Hollywood? People who abhor racism & xenophobia & homophobia? People who didn't want Trump to kill us all or tank economy?
817418234337099777 2017-01-06 17:11:08 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion lol, back in the 1990s she meant the gangs.  They were a real problem since Reagan who didn't want to deal w them.
817416060265697281 2017-01-06 17:02:30 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion in 1990s gangs WERE killing blacks 2. U had marches going on in predominantly black neighborhoods protesting gangs
817415639430270976 2017-01-06 17:00:49 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion and it wasn't "open racism".  She said gang members were super predators. She didn't say blacks were. 1/
817415164869877760 2017-01-06 16:58:56 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion in 1990s even Rev Al Sharpton was FOR that crime bill. Had unintended consequences which HRC was going to fix.
817414598039138306 2017-01-06 16:56:41 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion there is also a project to revitalize Detroit and lend money to buy & fix homes. Work sponsored by Clinton Foundat
817414216067977216 2017-01-06 16:55:10 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion Sanders is stuck in 2008. She's working w/ banks to address racism & get them to lend to minority owned businesses
817412744324481025 2017-01-06 16:49:19 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion Bernie's coat of paint on it was even fresher. He's never had a relationship w black community. VT is too white.
817412295651446784 2017-01-06 16:47:32 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion Bernie voted FOR that bill that you all excoriate Hillary for.  She was FLOTUS and didn't have a vote.
817412028763688961 2017-01-06 16:46:29 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion since HRC lost, she won't be able to reform the criminal justice system and Trump will make things worse.
817411253987659776 2017-01-06 16:43:24 UTC <Vva10967> Neither can we in the US, lolhttps://twitter.com/ReutersPolitics/status/817409154054815744
817409448683732992 2017-01-06 16:36:13 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion Bernie thought and still thinks of issues of race as "identity politics" that take back seat to class warfare. 3/
817409133641158656 2017-01-06 16:34:58 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion could have gotten done what Obama couldn't because he backed down every time he touched race & racism. She didn't.
817408938538893316 2017-01-06 16:34:12 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion she's the ONLY candidate for POTUS willing to take on systemic racism, support BLM & Mothers of Movement. 1/
817405962181050368 2017-01-06 16:22:22 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou agreed he went so far that when he FINALLY endorsed her, his hard core brain-washed supporters called HIM a sellout & walked away
817405499574546432 2017-01-06 16:20:32 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 Unlike Warren, Bernie could NEVER bring himself to say HRC has a good heart, will fight 4 us & is champion we need in WH.  2/
817405030588448770 2017-01-06 16:18:40 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 but SHE was to Obama when she endorsed him because goal was winning the White House. Bernie never took back his claims on HRC. 1/
817396637404450816 2017-01-06 15:45:19 UTC <Vva10967> @Mas5665 Single payer was never on the table.  What Lieberman stopped was the public option. Obamacare was always Romneycare with diff name.
817253111785930756 2017-01-05 06:15:00 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon and that's probably because Putin is blackmailing Trump per the spy memo that the FBI got over the summer and chose to ignore.
817235714756775936 2017-01-05 05:05:52 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos @NancyPelosi @joanwalsh @carriesjan Maybe it's weed. It just became legal in November in CA. Maybe she's starting early, lol.
817235183632052230 2017-01-05 05:03:45 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos She's a Bernie Sanders follower. Doesn't care about the Dem party, probably isn't a Democrat. Willing to normalize Trump.
817232401407574016 2017-01-05 04:52:42 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes @joanwalsh seems to believe that @HillaryClinton has nothing better to do with her life! Her Foundation work alone would be 24/7.
817230771421331456 2017-01-05 04:46:13 UTC <Vva10967> @colbertlateshow maybe because we excoriated the most qualified candidate ever over some stupid emails (or allowed it to happen)?
817225696028356608 2017-01-05 04:26:03 UTC <Vva10967> House Republicans revive obscure rule that allows them to slash the pay of individual federal workers to $1 http://wpo.st/aH-Q2
817223705453588480 2017-01-05 04:18:09 UTC <Vva10967> Well Berners, you voted against Hillary because Bernie said she'd be too close to Kissinger & lo and behold you elected the man who IS.https://twitter.com/business/status/817219739344900096
817221699485712385 2017-01-05 04:10:11 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @MSNBC Joy Reid, yours is the ONLY show I look forward to watching ANYWHERE. @chrislhayes & @maddow keep having Bernie.
817047547982348292 2017-01-05 16:38:10 UTC <Vva10967> @thenation @joanwalsh can Senate Dems block his confirmation? or did they change the rules on Cabinet confirmations prior to 2014 midterm?
817046435745107968 2017-01-05 16:33:44 UTC <Vva10967> LOL, some things never change.  Did these contractors not know that the Donald has been stiffing contractors since at least the past 25 yrs?https://twitter.com/postlocal/status/817045942322995200
816912597844983808 2017-01-04 07:41:55 UTC <Vva10967> @brianstelter @CatchaRUSSpy curious but why doesn't US just bring down Wikileaks's servers? Could have done it when the were interfering no?
816892955105652736 2017-01-04 06:23:52 UTC <Vva10967> @CapehartJ but the Republicans are still swearing him in come January 20th.
816891821221670912 2017-01-04 06:19:21 UTC <Vva10967> @FBI @CIA Thank James Comey for your new Commander in Chief who wants to downsize you and doesn't believe anything you say. Prefers Assange.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/816884201937113088
816889982954651648 2017-01-04 06:12:03 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 Heck, if it's not going anywhere, they should have gone for 6 years worth of returns! (note that all co-sponsors are Dems)
816821859220148224 2017-01-04 01:41:21 UTC <Vva10967> @MalcolmNance @JoyAnnReid @maddow Can he do that or does he need Congressional approval?https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/816819492353437696
816817272782258176 2017-01-04 01:23:08 UTC <Vva10967> @JasonKander I think this is much worse.Assange has put in danger members of the IC in the past with his leaks & Trump is siding w the enemy
816816752973717504 2017-01-04 01:21:04 UTC <Vva10967> So @realDonaldTrump you trust Assange more than you trust the U.S. Intelligence Agencies?  REALLY? @CIA @FBI @NewYorkFBI @NSAGov
816815908438081536 2017-01-04 01:17:42 UTC <Vva10967> @NormOrnstein so who enforces the law against Trump?
816543410068844544 2017-01-03 07:14:54 UTC <Vva10967> @RBReich @HillaryClinton will always put country first. Always has, always will. She believes in the peaceful transfer of power.
816542451032850433 2017-01-03 07:11:05 UTC <Vva10967> @deray @seanhannity @KellyannePolls Yeah we were raised that way but GOP changed the rules in 2009 and those new rules apply now.
816541010264256512 2017-01-03 07:05:22 UTC <Vva10967> Nop.https://twitter.com/jonfavs/status/816476883420225536
816335066913767424 2017-01-03 17:27:01 UTC <Vva10967> If @realDonaldTrump wants to be a President for all Americans, he could start by withdrawing his most divisive pick @jeffsessions.It mattershttps://twitter.com/ALPolitics/status/816333985550897153
816334325121748992 2017-01-03 17:24:04 UTC <Vva10967> @ActosNonVerba it's not made up. He's a racist, always has been, always will be. His rhetoric in the Trump Campaign was consistent with past
816326049587937280 2017-01-03 16:51:11 UTC <Vva10967> Jeff Sessions needs to be defeated at Attorney General.  @SenSchumer @SenWarren @timkainehttps://twitter.com/LawyersComm/status/816325761481068544
816325725544452096 2017-01-03 16:49:54 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias No, BernieBusters elected Trump w their 3rd party votes in MI WI & PA.They can't be rewarded with the reigns to the Dem party.
816324670815424513 2017-01-03 16:45:42 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias strongly disagree. But then again, the notion that the DNC is an all-powerful king-making institution is a Bernie myth.

815817909113077760 2017-01-01 07:12:01 UTC <Vva10967> Any hackers out there? Tom Arnold's password is expired. But the footage is there.https://twitter.com/tomarnold/status/814659914119323648

815813184519016452 2017-01-01 06:53:14 UTC <Vva10967> @WBFO @joshtpm @gila43 racist Carl Paladino lives in Buffalo. He may be hosting the event. Ugh.
815812316168146944 2017-01-01 06:49:47 UTC <Vva10967> @WBFO @joshtpm well they weren't expecting the Berners to gift them the election with their 3rd party protest votes in MI WI & PA.
815784981175926785 2017-01-01 05:01:10 UTC <Vva10967> @VanJones68 @CNN let's not MISREPRESENT Hillary and what she ran on.  CC: @ChrisCuomopic.twitter.com/5ZWXBb2jOe
815784497576820736 2017-01-01 04:59:15 UTC <Vva10967> @VanJones68 @CNN If Hillary had been in Barack's shoes in 2009, she wouldn't have handed your head to the GOP to save her butt. #loyalty
815768730693206017 2017-01-01 03:56:36 UTC <Vva10967> Some hope that Senate Dems just might grow a spine. http://wpo.st/UmLP2
815766454553419776 2017-01-01 03:47:33 UTC <Vva10967> @TeenVogue why would a BILLIONAIRE do that? UNLESS he isn't one? This suggests that Trump is cash strapped, no?
815745588755132416 2017-01-01 02:24:38 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisCuomo he backed off? really? when? it's still on his website.
815745363055349761 2017-01-01 02:23:45 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisCuomo I think there is something counterproductive about not accepting that Trump spoke to WWC's racism, xenophobia & sexism.
815743927408005120 2017-01-01 02:18:02 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisCuomo Emails, Emails, Emails, Emails, ....& you never told people that there was a SEPARATE GOVT system for those MARKED classified.
815692512182542336 2017-01-01 22:53:44 UTC <Vva10967> Exactly.  Stop making excuses for the Trump enablers. The Nazis were as guilty as Hitler. @ChrisCuomohttps://twitter.com/owillis/status/815609650653630466
815690762239299585 2017-01-01 22:46:47 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN @VanJones68 you just described the Trump Platform while grossly distorting Hillary's.  And Trump won the WWC with that platform.

815650980738043905 2017-01-01 20:08:42 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou should say the "CNN days are over" The Right hates them and now the Left does too. @jaketapper is the only journalist left there.
815650216468742145 2017-01-01 20:05:40 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou I miss her. So wish she were our President. 
815331269110362112 2016-12-31 22:58:17 UTC <Vva10967> @Evan_McMullin @Gabbiedrice78K it would contradict his explanation of why Hillary lost (didn't reach out to the WWC). Can't have that, lol.
815326648820203520 2016-12-31 22:39:55 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @keithchaput You might as well, you already gave us Trump as POTUS with your third party votes.
815326064381661185 2016-12-31 22:37:36 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders why not? Trump did it and the WWC voted for him. He's now rewarding his donors with Cabinet positions & WWC is okay with it.
815262537008775169 2016-12-31 18:25:10 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou was looking at one of your Oct 2015 articles. Tad Devine corrupted Bernie after all & created HH-Left.http://www.hillarymen.com/latest/bernie-dont-go-down-that-anti-hillary-road
815260506927861760 2016-12-31 18:17:06 UTC <Vva10967> @davidfolkenflik yeah but you guys in the media, and particularly the NYT, elected him with your Clinton Derangement Syndrome & EmailGate.
815258966259339266 2016-12-31 18:10:58 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou is there a difference between the 2 groups? 
815258191776849920 2016-12-31 18:07:54 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem @KaraCalavera and Comey reported to @LorettaLynch who allowed him to break DOJ rules & protocol to go ONLY after HRC.
815257934645133312 2016-12-31 18:06:53 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem @KaraCalavera except that he nominated Comey to be his FBI director knowing Comey was a Republican, bc of bipartisan kumbaya.
815243930933440512 2016-12-31 17:11:14 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro in your examples, what the voters you point out are revolting against is change & the browness of the new immigrants, the "other" 3/
815243237757571078 2016-12-31 17:08:29 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro you're reading too much into the Presidential election result. Almost 3 million more people voted for HRC & her platform. 2/2
815242906164338689 2016-12-31 17:07:09 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro Trump won because at least 80,000 Bernie fools in MI PA & WI fell for the info Russia fed them in Podesta's & DNC hacked emails. 1/
815042621051666433 2016-12-30 03:51:18 UTC <Vva10967> @CatchaRUSSpy then again, Trump could get US there easily, lol.
814890454491729920 2016-12-30 17:46:38 UTC <Vva10967> It's sad how the Alt Right, the MSM & Trump were able to slander the Clinton Foundation @ClintonFdnhttps://medium.com/clintonfoundation/clinton-foundation-what-you-need-to-know-now-df0b1aa865a5#.fdq511pc9
814727081758248961 2016-12-29 06:57:27 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @dstreamdiver winning for presidential election or for getting back the U.S. House and the State Govs & Legislatures? Not same.
814726311704936448 2016-12-29 06:54:24 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @dstreamdiver & it's more what Trump & right wing repeat i.e. immigration = more terrorists, criminals, rapists & gang members
814699412970700801 2016-12-29 05:07:31 UTC <Vva10967> @McFaul but they were able to hack FL machines before the election? When FBI interfered in the election how can it be trusted to tell truth?
814697354670571520 2016-12-29 04:59:20 UTC <Vva10967> @TomPerez @EllisonCampaign thinking I should have used these addresses instead for my question.  See below, thanks!https://twitter.com/Vva10967/status/814693564051587074
814694598392119297 2016-12-29 04:48:23 UTC <Vva10967> @JesseFFerguson @tomperriello although redness of middle of the country also seems to track rise/growth of Roger Ailes' Faux News.
814693564051587074 2016-12-29 04:44:16 UTC <Vva10967> @LaborSec @keithellison I think caucuses should go & be replaced w/ normal primaries 2 make voting easier 4 everyone. What's your position?
814682904135602177 2016-12-29 04:01:55 UTC <Vva10967> @CatchaRUSSpy @NavyvetPC true, but my point is that no, Wikileaks is not stopping. What we saw here IS now being repeated in Germany.
814675729011056641 2016-12-29 03:33:24 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @AC360 @NBCNews @ABC @CBSNews @washingtonpost @nytimes @MSNBC Are you all going to get this story right or just parrot Trump? https://twitter.com/TonyRomm/status/814260720443490304
814675092911308800 2016-12-29 03:30:52 UTC <Vva10967> @CatchaRUSSpy Trump didn't have enough voters to elect him. He won because enough in the Far Left (70,000) voted 3rd party in MI, WI & PA
814674691638042624 2016-12-29 03:29:17 UTC <Vva10967> @NavyvetPC @CatchaRUSSpy they started leaking emails targeting Angela Merkel a couple of weeks ago so MO seems to be the same & not stopping
814674361630281733 2016-12-29 03:27:58 UTC <Vva10967> @CatchaRUSSpy actually it was the Far Left that elected Trump & the hacked emails were directed at them & at their myths
814673887510327296 2016-12-29 03:26:05 UTC <Vva10967> @maslaniks @CatchaRUSSpy why hasn't the US government ever taken down the Wikileaks website? It's put US personnel at risk in the past.

814345163569070084 2016-12-28 05:39:51 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCayJ has Trump always sounded like he has a cognitive & expressive disability? is it possible he's getting Alzheimer's?

814241320793477122 2016-12-28 22:47:13 UTC <Vva10967> @OrenCNN @jaketapper or he may be trying to distract from the fact that the Israeli AG is now investigating him for fraud and corruption.

814006266184036352 2016-12-27 07:13:12 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan @RBRadio1 Berners were "trading" 3rd party votes in swing states for 3rd party votes in safe states wk bf election.
814005922578239488 2016-12-27 07:11:50 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan @RBRadio1 there are no coal miners in those states. And she had the only plan to actually help them.
814005270225502209 2016-12-27 07:09:14 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan @RBRadio1 She would have survived Comey, the rogue NY FBI & the Russian hackers but/for the Alt Left sabotage.
814005068202708995 2016-12-27 07:08:26 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan @RBRadio1 yeah but it was the Alt Left protest vote in MI PA & WI that blew her wall, <78.000 across those 3 states.
814003779523772417 2016-12-27 07:03:19 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan @RBRadio1 & his stump speeches for her were weak & focused on how bad Trump was, not on how good she was.
814003306204950528 2016-12-27 07:01:26 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan @RBRadio1 after he trashed her so badly that his hard core followers called HIM a sold out.
814002896186540032 2016-12-27 06:59:48 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan maybe she was tired of ALWAYS being presumed guilty until proven innocent & rules only applying to her.

814000190449483777 2016-12-27 06:49:03 UTC <Vva10967> @KevinDarryl lol, like Trump will sign that as President, even if Ryan & McConnell found the courage to put it up for a vote & passed it.
813997529629073408 2016-12-27 06:38:29 UTC <Vva10967> @FoxNews sure why not.  Along with Obamacare, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.  That's the Paul Ryan agenda & now he can implement it
813933568233799680 2016-12-27 02:24:19 UTC <Vva10967> @warrenforpres20 Patr Act was a mistake.But we now know better & won't repeat it when we get attacked bc Trump won't pay attn to briefings.

813932465454743552 2016-12-27 02:19:56 UTC <Vva10967> @warrenforpres20 77 Senators voted for the Iraq War and it wasn't a vote to go to War.  Look at the tape & at her remarks.
813929958859010048 2016-12-27 02:09:58 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid It's like finding out they have a KKK outfit hidden in their closet. 2/2
813929869247713280 2016-12-27 02:09:37 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid No, because voting for Trump revealed who they are and how they really feel about POC, women, LGBT, etc. etc. 1/2

813927135966543872 2016-12-27 01:58:45 UTC <Vva10967> @warrenforpres20 Hillary's public service record has been liberal. To the left of Obama's in the Senate.  For women, children & LGBT as SOS.

810981294637219840 2016-12-19 22:53:02 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro it's heartbreaking when the most qualified woman for POTUS in the world loses to the least qualified man in the world by 78K votes.

810973115866120192 2016-12-19 22:20:32 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders actually 2.86 Million.
810894016019566594 2016-12-19 17:06:13 UTC <Vva10967> @ezralevant but Bush Sr. didn't lose with 2.9 MILLION more votes. Nor was he aided by a rogue FBI, Russian hackers & Wikileaks.
810885753433636864 2016-12-19 16:33:23 UTC <Vva10967> She won against Bernie by 3.7 MILLION votes and over 300 ELECTED delegates.  Stop spreading the lies he fed you.
810738693266927616 2016-12-18 06:49:01 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 @mequantum that number is down to 78K
810738146019278848 2016-12-18 06:46:51 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 actually NAFTA was negotiated & signed by Bush Sr. What Bill signed was its ratification by Senate a year later.

810242875510390784 2016-12-17 21:58:49 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos their biggest mistake was 2 apologize 4 server thinking media would move on.  Trump attacked media & got away w sexual assault!

810230905142919169 2016-12-17 21:11:15 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon she let Comey go rogue in July violating DOJ rules & precedent, did same in October & failed to investigate NY FBI leaks.#weak

810200499756658688 2016-12-17 19:10:26 UTC <Vva10967> @tribelaw 37 of Trump's electors could still deny him the Presidency IF they vote for HRC on Monday. But they are partisans, not patriots.
810198970689605632 2016-12-17 19:04:22 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow can you get @DavidCornDC back to discuss memo spy handed to FBI claiming Trump was compromised & could be blackmailed by Putin?
810028036888424448 2016-12-16 07:45:08 UTC <Vva10967> @PoliticsQNA not in the primaries. She got 3.7MM more votes than Bernie. That's not rigging. It's winning fair & square.
809900378468872192 2016-12-16 23:17:52 UTC <Vva10967> @PoliticsQNA yeah, she rigged it by getting 4 million more votes. Right, because the DNC is so powerful it tells people how to vote.
809897381928062977 2016-12-16 23:05:57 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki @DanHogan95 @bellisaurius only if as the media does, you assume Hillary's guilty until proven innocent. With Trump they don't
809825982072885248 2016-12-16 18:22:14 UTC <Vva10967> If Putin targeted Hillary because of 2011 grudge, why were HOUSE Democrats targetted by Russian hack too? http://nyti.ms/2hCOgEY
809812285703200768 2016-12-16 17:27:49 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki @DanHogan95 exactly and the media went into a frenzy over that Comey letter, covering it non-stop.

809810506496299008 2016-12-16 17:20:44 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki polling supports her claim, not yours. The FBI letter gave college educated whites an excuse to cast their votes for Trump.

809621681740402688 2016-12-15 04:50:25 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah @riverapolitics Cabinet members MUST back POTUS' agenda. TPP & Trade, like Fracking, were Obama key agenda items.
809469177228455936 2016-12-15 18:44:25 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn & yet Hillary lost by only 22.2K votes in WI, 44K in PA and 10.7K in MI, not unsurmountable numbers. Mostly due to Dem infighting
809456150231982080 2016-12-15 17:52:39 UTC <Vva10967> Trump will get our troops and diplomats killed and our homeland attacked with his carelessness. http://reut.rs/2hEtVim via @Reuters

809450589629415424 2016-12-15 17:30:34 UTC <Vva10967> @CIA should leak what they know now. Otherwise come Monday, Trump will become our 45th POTUS.https://twitter.com/GideonResnick/status/809438762811924481
809441591442214912 2016-12-15 16:54:48 UTC <Vva10967> @garageleague66 @BlazerBluejeans which will be hard to get rid of now that GOP has figured out that's the only way they can win Presidency.
809441323426136064 2016-12-15 16:53:44 UTC <Vva10967> @BlazerBluejeans @garageleague66 agreed. That fraction is driven by cult of personality 4 Bernie. Same thing that drives Trump voters.
809297189650493440 2016-12-14 07:21:00 UTC <Vva10967> @ezlusztig Even in July when Comey held unprecedented press conf breaking DOJ rules & protocol to excoriate HRC, Obama & Lynch stood silent
809246209416249344 2016-12-14 03:58:26 UTC <Vva10967> @reason @brosandprose @jaristmtrs actually it was higher. Hillary got 16.6 MM vs Sanders' 12.9MM
809245359482535936 2016-12-14 03:55:03 UTC <Vva10967> @brosandprose @groggygirl85 we only lost by 80K.  It can be overcome.
809244522689523712 2016-12-14 03:51:43 UTC <Vva10967> @garageleague66 @BlazerBluejeans Yet she won the most votes of any WHITE candidate for POTUS ever, male or female.

809166869739569153 2016-12-14 22:43:09 UTC <Vva10967> She adopted MOST of your losing candidate's platform. He lost the primary by 4 million votes.  Now all Berners get Trump.
809165551440457728 2016-12-14 22:37:55 UTC <Vva10967> @lw_populist Bernie was raised in NY. Yet I never saw him at Ground Zero on the days and months that followed 9/11. I saw Hillary there.
809164636562063364 2016-12-14 22:34:17 UTC <Vva10967> @lw_populist if someone insults you 24/7 you may not like them either. Hillary was NY's senator & worked hard to rebuild NYC after 9/11
809163869230919680 2016-12-14 22:31:14 UTC <Vva10967> @bluelighttv Independents are Right Leaning or Left Leaning. Most Left Leaning Indys did right thing & went with Hillary. Busters didn't
809163187627102209 2016-12-14 22:28:32 UTC <Vva10967> @bluelighttv your hate for her makes you hear everything she says as an insult. She said she understood millenials' economic frustrations.
809099973296058368 2016-12-14 18:17:20 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm she adopted most of Bernie's wishlist. They owed the country their vote. It's called Love of Country.
809099523230494720 2016-12-14 18:15:33 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @andrew_029 @JenGranholm Most Bernie supporters put country first. But enough didn't, their hate 4 HRC was stronger than love of country.
809099283664437248 2016-12-14 18:14:36 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @andrew_029 @JenGranholm she lost WI by 22K and the election by < 80K. I'm talking about the Bernie Busters not all Bernie supporters.
809098602563903488 2016-12-14 18:11:53 UTC <Vva10967> @laureldavilacpa apparently the Republicans are okay with it so long as their side wins.
809098310963306496 2016-12-14 18:10:44 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm so did 4MM more Dem voters. And Berners f*cked the country to avenge Bernie.
809097386148642816 2016-12-14 18:07:03 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm @lw_populist He lied. He made himself look pure about not giving paid speeches when he knew he'd be in jail if he'd given one.
808925719971713026 2016-12-13 06:44:55 UTC <Vva10967> @CapehartJ did you ask her why she let Comey go rogue in July & breach DOJ rules & protocol and treat HRC unlike any other citizen?
808923628893044736 2016-12-13 06:36:36 UTC <Vva10967> @HamiltonElector They are. They should be fighting to convert the Republican electors, anything else is a waste of time & energy.
808922936413487108 2016-12-13 06:33:51 UTC <Vva10967> Because they're misguided Berners. No wonder we lose! ur side doesn't know how to fight. Until it learns, GOP will continue winning
808922447126953986 2016-12-13 06:31:55 UTC <Vva10967> so @HamiltonElector is a bunch of weak Democrats who can't hold the line plus 1 GOP? Dems shooting themselves in the foot again!Sad
808921398160871424 2016-12-13 06:27:45 UTC <Vva10967> at one point they have to decide if COUNTRY matters to them more than party or not. If it does only Hillary can stop Trump #reality
808921165590827008 2016-12-13 06:26:49 UTC <Vva10967> and you're missing the point. 270 is too high a number to swing. 38 is a stretch as is, but not unsurmountable. 1/2
808920790200647680 2016-12-13 06:25:20 UTC <Vva10967> It's a useless exercise that will end up the same way as the NeverTrump movement: With Trump being elected POTUS.
808920244546846720 2016-12-13 06:23:09 UTC <Vva10967> Seems you are.  They will never get 270 to defect.  38 IS a stretch. And you either get to 270 at the EC or the House elects Trump.
808910918813941760 2016-12-13 05:46:06 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm Bernie convinced them during primary that the Democratic party is corrupt. Don't think he walked it back either. Reason we lost
808910016812089345 2016-12-13 05:42:31 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm @TabrisThe17th HRC's platform was most progressive in history. Far Left torched it and elected Trump instead out of hate 4 HRC.
808909511838863361 2016-12-13 05:40:31 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm @lw_populist Bernie's lies regarding Hillary's character, which he never walked back, gave us Trump.
808908680477417472 2016-12-13 05:37:12 UTC <Vva10967> didn't mean to copy you, sorry.
808908333344235521 2016-12-13 05:35:50 UTC <Vva10967> @lessig but if they don't vote for @HillaryClinton they will fail, just like the NeverTrumpers failed. Only Hillary can reach 270.
808907792123826176 2016-12-13 05:33:41 UTC <Vva10967> @TheChrisSuprun You MUST put COUNTRY above party.  Putin's Puppet CANNOT keep us safe. Will get us attacked & get troops killed w/o briefing
808907485914558464 2016-12-13 05:32:28 UTC <Vva10967> @TheChrisSuprun Hillary will be restrained by the GOP majorities in House & Senate. Country will be saved as will Western World & NATO.
808907196503392257 2016-12-13 05:31:19 UTC <Vva10967> @TheChrisSuprun If you want to save this country from Putin's Puppet, you MUST vote for @HillaryClinton who has 232 EC & can get to 270.
808906934132899841 2016-12-13 05:30:16 UTC <Vva10967> @TheChrisSuprun you're going to FAIL just like the NeverTrumpers failed. Only person who can stop Trump IS Hillary. She has 232 EC.
808905899175739392 2016-12-13 05:26:09 UTC <Vva10967> @tribelaw but GOP controls >30 so Trump wins anyway since GOP puts party above country. Better 4 38 to have courage 2 vote 4 @HillaryClinton

808857007243595786 2016-12-13 02:11:53 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm @TabrisThe17th That attitude elected Trump. Hope you enjoy him 4 the next 4 years. Corporate America will do great under Trump.
808854736258600960 2016-12-13 02:02:51 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm at the presidential level we lost by <80,000 votes & seems lesson is don't underestimate Far Left's hate & grudges?
808851745107542021 2016-12-13 01:50:58 UTC <Vva10967> @HillarysMen Which is why @HamiltonElector should vote for @HillaryClinton and defeat him.  Anything else fails and makes Trump POTUS.
808850846884757505 2016-12-13 01:47:24 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 @TooMuch__0 yes. May hope that if the CIA agrees to give briefing it'll be made available 2 all electors forcing GOP to listen
808820130310455300 2016-12-13 23:45:20 UTC <Vva10967> @MaddowBlog @maddow ask her why she won't appoint Special Prosecutor to investigate NY FBI leaks & Comey interference w election.
808819444336181249 2016-12-13 23:42:37 UTC <Vva10967> @MaddowBlog @maddow please ask her why she allowed Comey 2 break DOJ rules & protocol w July press conference & treat HRC unlike any citizen
808818594146635778 2016-12-13 23:39:14 UTC <Vva10967> @poniewozik @Ka5hBrokeDaBanK the west coast and also NY. You should educate yourself about state populations.
808818101882122244 2016-12-13 23:37:17 UTC <Vva10967> @poniewozik @Ka5hBrokeDaBanK there is only one recount the WI one. The others were ended by Trump's lawyers and GOP
808727968365170688 2016-12-13 17:39:07 UTC <Vva10967> @eldiariony Noticia: Trump no es religioso. No tiene idea que dice la biblia ni va nunca a misa.
808574285728141312 2016-12-12 07:28:26 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @NurseBoyStanley GOP voters vote straight party ticket no matter who the candidates are. Dems won't win until they do same.
808572374127931393 2016-12-12 07:20:51 UTC <Vva10967> what do you think made Arkansas turn red post Clinton?
808571989153710080 2016-12-12 07:19:19 UTC <Vva10967> why are the Clintons unpopular in Arkansas if they had a good track record when Bill was governor?
808563107975012353 2016-12-12 06:44:01 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou or it's proof that Putin is blackmailing Trump as report spy gave to FBI claimed he could do.
808562648380047360 2016-12-12 06:42:12 UTC <Vva10967> @cnnbrk and how would anyone know that if he hasn't released his tax returns?
808562368712245248 2016-12-12 06:41:05 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 agreed but then why make them voting? if they want spots to be able to attend convention, make them non-voting.
808559901152833536 2016-12-12 06:31:17 UTC <Vva10967> @StillLes4Hill If she had won 37 states she would have >270 EC votes. Wish she had. She won 20 states plus DC. Trump won 30.
808555569925804032 2016-12-12 06:14:04 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @karliw what, did she take their IDs away?  Give me a break. The "failing NYT" deserves Trump. Takes cheap shots at HRC.
808545812829601793 2016-12-12 05:35:18 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon Jeff Sessions is much worse.
808545599859654656 2016-12-12 05:34:27 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @naveman Bernie won't admit that Trump's xenophobic and islamophobic message resonated with the WWC in the rust belt states.
808545250486747140 2016-12-12 05:33:04 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @jmkofan yes, but that would interfere with Bernie's theory that Clinton lost because she didn't appeal to the WWC men, lol.
808544565875658752 2016-12-12 05:30:21 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert if people listen to Bernie we'll get killed in 2018 and that will decimate the party until 2030.
808543386315751424 2016-12-12 05:25:39 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @karliw WI had voter ID laws this election.  300,000 people in Milwaukee couldn't get proper IDs in time from DMV.
808494210861191168 2016-12-12 02:10:15 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @silveroinks The LEFT outnumbered the right, but failed because the Berners couldn't overcome their HATE for HRC.
808493606285746180 2016-12-12 02:07:51 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @silveroinks That's the thing, there were NOT ENOUGH Trump voters to elect him POTUS IF the Left had all voted Democratic.
808483597904707584 2016-12-12 01:28:05 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @silveroinks But it's true. There weren't enough of them. But they won because the Far Left refused to vote for Dem ticket.

808479423255244800 2016-12-12 01:11:29 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @silveroinks There were not enough Trump voters to defeat the Left IF the Left had voted for the Democratic ticket.
808479292623622144 2016-12-12 01:10:58 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @silveroinks Maybe but they, the Trump voters, didn't elect Trump. The Berners in MI WI & PA did with their protest votes.
808478786907963392 2016-12-12 01:08:58 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @JasperQNoob The Bernie Bros gave MI PA & WI to Trump.  She won popular vote by 2.85 MILLION votes. THEY elected Trump.
808478428680830976 2016-12-12 01:07:32 UTC <Vva10967> @TimDNiles @kurteichenwald @AlwaysThinkHow But it would have been overcome if Berners hadn't voted 3rd party in MI WI & PA. It's on them.
808477892791373824 2016-12-12 01:05:25 UTC <Vva10967> The Berners did and elected Trump.https://twitter.com/kurteichenwald/status/808437743009353728

808352196924477440 2016-12-12 16:45:56 UTC <Vva10967> @JoeConason which is why the Clinton Campaign should have challenged the vote counts in MI PA & WI. He told us the election would be rigged.
808346199744974848 2016-12-12 16:22:07 UTC <Vva10967> @poniewozik @Ka5hBrokeDaBanK Hillary got 2.85 MILLION more votes than Trump.  10% of the vote is roughly 13 MILLION that were left to count.

808080880757575680 2016-12-11 22:47:50 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @HamiltonElector is another stupid NeverTrump movement that LACKS the courage to vote FOR @HillaryClinton to stop Trump.
808071740815474688 2016-12-11 22:11:30 UTC <Vva10967> @ezlusztig but he still ignored the intel. Trump won't even bother listening or reading the reports.
808010328428707840 2016-12-11 18:07:29 UTC <Vva10967> Trump thinks "intelligence" in "intelligence briefings" refers to being smart!  oi!https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/807994453650710528
808009037015027713 2016-12-11 18:02:21 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 or maybe Putin IS blackmailing Trump like the Spy report that the FBI got in August said.  http://www.motherjones.com/print/317801

807806245654642690 2016-12-10 04:36:31 UTC <Vva10967> @Ventuckyspaz & your claim's false. Obama couldn't close Gitmo because enough Dems & Repubs wanted to keep it open. Not everyone is a purist

807357731241922560 2016-12-09 22:54:17 UTC <Vva10967> @billmaher The one you shouldn't want to see again is Bernie, HIS followers made Trump POTUS with their 3rd party votes in MI PA & WI
807341585281282048 2016-12-09 21:50:08 UTC <Vva10967> @yottapoint I think the hate for Hillary & Dem Party that Bernie instilled in his followers explains this. May not have realized it'd last.
807340299764764672 2016-12-09 21:45:01 UTC <Vva10967> Media you are flunking sooooo bad!https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/807271756499140608
807255378820026372 2016-12-09 16:07:35 UTC <Vva10967> @benjamuniverse & HRC never said Rigged! I would have won but for the DNC & supers even though she had more votes than BO did @brianefallon
807127632060018688 2016-12-08 07:39:57 UTC <Vva10967> @soledadobrien @dandrezner but she lost election because < 80,000 Berners cast third party protest votes in MI PA & WI to say FU to her
807108316883255296 2016-12-08 06:23:12 UTC <Vva10967> And the hate for America has started and he hasn't even been sworn in yet.https://twitter.com/ReutersPolitics/status/807097468106264576

806743010599833602 2016-12-07 06:11:36 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah @DonnaDiva Actually US intel professionals should thank Comey for the disrespect they are now getting from both sides.
806741485697650690 2016-12-07 06:05:33 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 who is "someone else" at this point?
806740748389400577 2016-12-07 06:02:37 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 the Superdelegates should be non-voting. Then we don't have to argue that the person who got 4MM more votes "cheated".
806736715922558976 2016-12-07 05:46:36 UTC <Vva10967> @POTUS @LorettaLynch @SallyQYates @JoeBiden Seriously you need to declassify this report like the Democratic Senators on Intel Com requestedhttps://twitter.com/michaelscherer/status/806500081486753793

806547411048996864 2016-12-07 17:14:22 UTC <Vva10967> Welcome to Trump's Presidency. Where the show is what matters and facts do not.https://twitter.com/CNNnewsroom/status/806535940936175616
806546328402661376 2016-12-07 17:10:04 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid they would be filing this lawsuit with the SCOTUS asap: https://medium.com/@lessig/the-equal-protection-argument-against-winner-take-all-in-the-electoral-college-b09e8a49d777#.b7oo1t1fc @KamalaHarris
806537633430126593 2016-12-07 16:35:31 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @Maverik877 they must either show courage & patriotism by voting for the ONLY candidate who CAN defeat him in the EC, Hillary, or shut up
806537194152267777 2016-12-07 16:33:46 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @Maverik877 oh I do.  I also understand that the NeverTrumpers have been trying to defeat Trump 4 over a year and keep failing.
806536649081495556 2016-12-07 16:31:36 UTC <Vva10967> @marceelias @KamalaHarris speaking of CA, have you looked at this? His argument seems consistent with Bush v Gore.https://medium.com/@lessig/the-equal-protection-argument-against-winner-take-all-in-the-electoral-college-b09e8a49d777#.78igtwo5d
806535822719729664 2016-12-07 16:28:19 UTC <Vva10967> @TheChrisSuprun @lutherlowe @Maverik877 2.7 MILLION more people voted 4 Hillary than Trump. Kasich was defeated in the primary. Not a choice
806345876331524096 2016-12-06 03:53:32 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN @VanJones68 you're in denial. Michael Moore is right.  Trump doesn't even understand trade. Has never read Nafta. Carrier deal was sham
806344628152791044 2016-12-06 03:48:35 UTC <Vva10967> @TheChrisSuprun @lutherlowe BULLSHIT. If the Electors want to stop Trump, they must vote for HILLARY.  It's called COURAGE & LOVE OF COUNTRY
806342347588009984 2016-12-06 03:39:31 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid She's actually over 2.7 Million.
806340613759176704 2016-12-06 03:32:38 UTC <Vva10967> @KFILE only the Democrats.  @jasoninthehouse is pretending he's blind.
806339841910775808 2016-12-06 03:29:34 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost what about Gen Flynn himself? He retwitted the PizzaGate story claiming it was true on Nov 2nd. Should disqualify him.
806215077946945536 2016-12-06 19:13:47 UTC <Vva10967> @ReutersPolitics maybe you should add that Trump's tweet came 22 minutes after story that Boeing criticized him for how he's handling China
806214396666138624 2016-12-06 19:11:05 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou they're as deplorable as the Trump followers.
806212538962759685 2016-12-06 19:03:42 UTC <Vva10967> @Unashamed_Chuck and you consume fake news.
806187907811831810 2016-12-06 17:25:50 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @whitegalvin @ShelbyEmerald maybe @Lawrence or @maddow @MaddowBlog or @JoyAnnReid  or @jaketapper (only good one left at CNN)
806186000783392768 2016-12-06 17:18:15 UTC <Vva10967> @patysq73 IF enough votes are flipped in a state, she gets the Electoral College votes of that state and wins if she reaches 270 EC total.
806185589041168384 2016-12-06 17:16:37 UTC <Vva10967> @MesMitch their argument is that no recount has ever flipped > 10,000 votes. But this election has been like no other so who knows.
806184339201462272 2016-12-06 17:11:39 UTC <Vva10967> @CNBC @kylegriffin1 wonder if @realDonaldTrump will do same with Lockeed Martin,Northrop Grumman & other defense contractors paid billions?
806028969153822721 2016-12-05 06:54:16 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @teeging @realcaptainmorg Bernie had even less chance. The amount of opposition research on him was HUGE.
806012830252232704 2016-12-05 05:50:08 UTC <Vva10967> @ElectProject which 18 haven't certified yet?
806008853896773632 2016-12-05 05:34:20 UTC <Vva10967> @MMFlint never mind the Trump voters. If just 2 BernBusters hadn't voted third party, Trump wouldn't be President Elect.
806008259941376000 2016-12-05 05:31:58 UTC <Vva10967> @MMFlint yeah but what's ahead will be under Trump, not under Obama. Could have been under Hillary if BernBusters hadn't voted 3rd party.
806007839760273408 2016-12-05 05:30:18 UTC <Vva10967> @MMFlint but he's saying that he'll cast his vote for a Republican like Kasich. If no one gets 270 it goes to House where each state= 1 vote
806000768465698816 2016-12-05 05:02:12 UTC <Vva10967> Trump continues to be afraid of the Michigan recount.  What is he hiding???https://twitter.com/paulegan4/status/805878073035988992
805997216456470533 2016-12-05 04:48:05 UTC <Vva10967> @Lawrence @maddow @JoyAnnReid I don't understand why @washingtonpost & @nytimes pretend they treated Hillary fairlyhttp://politi.co/1Ho8V4a
805996723227258880 2016-12-05 04:46:08 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost @nytimes how can you deny your role in Trump's election when you purposefully trashed Hillary?  http://politi.co/1Ho8V4a
805984678343823360 2016-12-05 03:58:16 UTC <Vva10967> @JuddLegum problem is that he is contemplating voting for Kasich. If no one gets 270 it goes to the House where they get 1 vote per state.
805984451826241536 2016-12-05 03:57:22 UTC <Vva10967> @JuddLegum @hillofbeans17 @politibeast we don't run dangerous demagogues willing to start a war with China on twitter.
805945255585546240 2016-12-05 01:21:37 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro Since Trump has no core beliefs and loves celebrities we should send Leonardo DeCaprio next, lol.
805856006664228864 2016-12-05 19:26:58 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid did Holder say why @LorettaLynch has NOT prosecuted any cases since taking over? eg WI & NC come to mind.
805851123949170690 2016-12-05 19:07:34 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @Physicstocks how's a narrative of reality "committing treason"?
805820997916065800 2016-12-05 17:07:51 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro He's not different than Clarence Thomas who fights tooth and nail the very system of civil rights that got him there.
805819736307142656 2016-12-05 17:02:51 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou I think the real cult is not Trump's but Bernie's. The Berners gave the election to Trump to avenge their "wronged saviour".
805819018561077248 2016-12-05 17:00:00 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @xwex Not all those years, Bernie's attacks during the primary plus media's relentless obsession over her emails. Plus Comey.
805818542956363776 2016-12-05 16:58:06 UTC <Vva10967> @cbouzy @JenGranholm @JoyAnnReid specially when MI didn't even have a Senate race.  Why go vote at all if you're not voting for POTUS?
805664786595872768 2016-12-04 06:47:08 UTC <Vva10967> @SpeakerRyan How do you sleep at night??? You have no conscience, no heart, no moral code, no ethics, only partisanship left.
805663968522104832 2016-12-04 06:43:53 UTC <Vva10967> Ryan showing again that he is not for the little guy.https://twitter.com/speakerryan/status/805562892921831424
805663107263643648 2016-12-04 06:40:27 UTC <Vva10967> @mathieuvonrohr @deray @williamjordann and Assange has already started his wiki leaks attack on her. He has become an enemy of democracy.
805647870540058624 2016-12-04 05:39:55 UTC <Vva10967> @ByronTau You do know that Breitbart is a neo nazi white supremacist site, don't you? That's what "Alt Right" is.
805647419602046978 2016-12-04 05:38:07 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou Heck, he told us to elect Hillary.  Not his fault that the Berners voted 3rd party in MI PA & WI and elected Trump.
805643250442924032 2016-12-04 05:21:33 UTC <Vva10967> The MI recount is back on! And Judge says state must "assemble necessary staff to work sufficient hours" to make sure it's done by Dec 13!https://twitter.com/paulegan4/status/805640496823603200
805531506198347776 2016-12-04 21:57:31 UTC <Vva10967> @GovMikeHuckabee Then the recounts will show that, no? If he won fair & square, what are you afraid of?
805528658949574656 2016-12-04 21:46:12 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 you never think it could happen in super liberal blue NYC.
805528250554392576 2016-12-04 21:44:35 UTC <Vva10967> Thanks! Didn't realize it was the same guy you blocked, lol. Just blocked him too.
805526207747989505 2016-12-04 21:36:28 UTC <Vva10967> @tristanwalker @blykmyk44 @jonfavs yeah I'd understand that he means that the black guy in the White House destroyed America, like Faux says
805525504761753600 2016-12-04 21:33:40 UTC <Vva10967> @thatmattwade @jonfavs yes, in a conversation about Making America White Again, like in the 1950s.
805525344191152131 2016-12-04 21:33:02 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs @kaaawababy @tristanwalker So if you buy into the media narrative that HRC is inauthentic and untrustworthy, nothing matters, no?
805524094867374080 2016-12-04 21:28:04 UTC <Vva10967> @thethriftygene OR he got the Dem Party DECIMATED because he couldn't communicate to voters the good he and the Dems did passing the ACA.
805521386143879168 2016-12-04 21:17:18 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @eee_eff Dems lose elections over purity tests and infighting. Unless & until that stops, GOP will continue to win
805520985722068992 2016-12-04 21:15:43 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @eee_eff @LBTheDemocrat @peterdaou The "OMG, no press conferences" was media bullshit.  It didn't apply to Trump & still doesn't.
805520638291181568 2016-12-04 21:14:20 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @eee_eff @LBTheDemocrat @peterdaou She was tired of being presumed guilty until proven innocent and drew a line in the sand.
805520301924749312 2016-12-04 21:13:00 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @eee_eff LOL, could it be that she's actually HONEST? She could have lied to win and didn't.
805519837204250624 2016-12-04 21:11:09 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @eee_eff It doesn't matter WHAT the issue is, Hillary gets treated differently, as guilty until proven innocent.
805519527710720000 2016-12-04 21:09:55 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @eee_eff nah, he would get a break. Just like he did in 2008 & in 2012. He's promoted fracking his entire 2 terms.
805498016882946049 2016-12-04 19:44:27 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @eee_eff but only one gets excoriated for it by the same voters.
805497325590298624 2016-12-04 19:41:42 UTC <Vva10967> @Evan_McMullin The GOP has lost its soul & become the Party of Trump.  @jasoninthehouse refuses 2 investigate Trump's conflicts of interest
805496289903448064 2016-12-04 19:37:35 UTC <Vva10967> @centojack81 @jonfavs and the damage Bush caused in the Middle East has been irreversible.  And Bush wasn't nearly as bad as Trump is.
805495928832589824 2016-12-04 19:36:09 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs Not as much as Bernie did during the primary. To date, he's still trashing the Democratic party as corrupt. Not great for GOTV.
805495295572320258 2016-12-04 19:33:38 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias @jonfavs @danpfeiffer Hillary ran as continuation of Obama's legacy, Trump ran as repudiation of it. But for Berners she'd won
805493933702860800 2016-12-04 19:28:13 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias @jonfavs @danpfeiffer or in 2010 or in 2014.  The Democratic party got DECIMATED under Obama despite all the good he did.
805492486588268545 2016-12-04 19:22:28 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @eee_eff So the Democratic voters in 2008 CHOSE "Hope and Fracking" and as SOS HRC marketed HIS agenda bc he won.
805492066142842880 2016-12-04 19:20:48 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @eee_eff Hillary voted AGAINST 2005 Energy Bill that exempts fracking from Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act & CERCLA
805491930968850432 2016-12-04 19:20:16 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @eee_eff Obama voted FOR 2005 Energy Bill that exempts fracking from Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act & CERCLA.
805491520593940481 2016-12-04 19:18:38 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @eee_eff and in the 2008 primary she was anti-fracking while Obama was pro-fracking and people didn't give a f*ck.
805490861962305536 2016-12-04 19:16:01 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @noiserawker AND because he wasn't the nominee so GOP never attacked him. They've attacked HRC for 30 years.
805489930751320065 2016-12-04 19:12:19 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 @PeterSzucs90 He IS wrong. WI counts Milwaukee absentee & provisional last. So numbers reflect election night results 4 now.
805489270064640000 2016-12-04 19:09:41 UTC <Vva10967> @TVietor08 actually he is. WI counts Milwaukee absentee & provisional ballots last. Numbers will track election night results before that.
805488571503247360 2016-12-04 19:06:55 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou The notion that a 75 socialist is the future of a party that he is NOT a member of is mind boggling. They're a mindless cult.
805487904176869376 2016-12-04 19:04:16 UTC <Vva10967> @bagglo @NeuOligarch so she shouldn't have given speeches because it offends your purity test?  ahhhh.
805464044534722560 2016-12-04 17:29:27 UTC <Vva10967> @bagglo @NeuOligarch Bernie would have gone to JAIL had he given a paid speech to anyone not bc he's "pure" but bc law prohibits it.
805463663486320640 2016-12-04 17:27:56 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @bagglo @NeuOligarch her speeches were given AFTER she left her SOS post and BEFORE she decided to run again for POTUS.
805461465125847041 2016-12-04 17:19:12 UTC <Vva10967> @bagglo @NeuOligarch Bc Bernie convinced U of that. She gave > 100 speeches. Agency that represented her had >50 other speakers w same rate.
805461051944869888 2016-12-04 17:17:34 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @bagglo @NeuOligarch only bc Dems allowed it to be an issue. Former Presidents & SOSs have given paid speeches for decades.
805460189101064192 2016-12-04 17:14:08 UTC <Vva10967> @aravosis @roselaura100 there weren't enough of them to elect Trump. He couldn't have won if protest voters had voted for Dem ticket.
805457847517671425 2016-12-04 17:04:50 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper has Comey resurfaced? is he in hiding or something? why isn't he being hunted down by the media for a comment?
805311364164190208 2016-12-03 07:22:45 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm the hate for Hillary that Bernie instilled in his followers is strong and elected Trump. Bernie never walked slanders back.
805303831043129344 2016-12-03 06:52:49 UTC <Vva10967> @Amy_Siskind Maybe we can all do this for Hillary? I already submitted my nomination.https://twitter.com/stylistkavin/status/805231786657624064
805111946848702466 2016-12-03 18:10:21 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou LOL, these are the same people who attacked Warren 4 not backing their saviour in the primary & endorsing Hillary in the general
804912765504802816 2016-12-02 04:58:52 UTC <Vva10967> @thefix @washingtonpost articles like this make me question the wisdom of subscribing to you.  You need to rethink keeping @TheFix
804912117212127232 2016-12-02 04:56:17 UTC <Vva10967> @AriBerman MI AG is also opposing it and Trump SuperPACs are opposing the recount in WI. They sure fear something.
804909927277989889 2016-12-02 04:47:35 UTC <Vva10967> @Saberghoff did you see this? https://protectourelections.nationbuilder.com/florida_recount I don't know if they filed today but they did reach their fundraising goal.
804905586425032704 2016-12-02 04:30:20 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah He makes W look good, lol.
804904750324060160 2016-12-02 04:27:01 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou and by voting third party just to say FU to her. We lost WI by 22,177 votes, PA by 46,435 and MI by 10,707, total of 79,319.
804901318854852608 2016-12-02 04:13:23 UTC <Vva10967> THIS IS FALSE:  Trump Won 3,084 of 3,141 Counties, Clinton Won 57http://www.snopes.com/trump-won-3084-of-3141-counties-clinton-won-57/
804900183704305664 2016-12-02 04:08:52 UTC <Vva10967> @AriBerman the Dems can block him and keep the vacancy vacant.  The Republicans said they were going to do it to Hillary, so why not?
804794531011055616 2016-12-02 21:09:03 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @maddow @Lawrence @amjoyshow Please cover this story. Thanks!https://twitter.com/Amy_Siskind/status/804730602352214017

804731771569008641 2016-12-02 16:59:40 UTC <Vva10967> @NancyPelosi @keithellison Dems need to stop pretending Election Result was about Economics.  It was about white nationalism.https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/804717302944006144

804724045610700800 2016-12-02 16:28:58 UTC <Vva10967> If you live in Michigan, please call.  Something fishy going on there that Trump is trying to cover up.  Also share widely.https://twitter.com/leahmcelrath/status/804713760304799744
804722332610785280 2016-12-02 16:22:09 UTC <Vva10967> @MIAttyGen what are you afraid of? If Trump won fair and square the result won't change.  On the other hand if GOP cheated, it will.
804720601915125762 2016-12-02 16:15:17 UTC <Vva10967> @AlyssaMastro44 maybe Trump saw that didn't keep McCain from being an assh*ole to Obama for the past 8 years.
804578537101463552 2016-12-01 06:50:46 UTC <Vva10967> @thefix @joanwalsh Thing is that @TheFix has always hated Hillary. He was one of the worse going after her character. Everything was negative
804577615931645953 2016-12-01 06:47:06 UTC <Vva10967> @thefix @ahumorlessfem @TheFix has always hated Hillary.

804520804813832197 2016-12-01 03:01:21 UTC <Vva10967> @CapehartJ the "emails are a crime" story is bogus. He knows it. Comey knows it. The media is again providing a FALSE narrative about it.
804520147000184832 2016-12-01 02:58:44 UTC <Vva10967> @ToddCmii that creates trillion $$$ deficits that R piled on 2 the national debt. Hope U like currency devaluations when he defaults on debt
804466174331420676 2016-12-01 23:24:16 UTC <Vva10967> Trump is afraid of the Recounts.  Does he know something we don't? @JoyAnnReid @Lawrence @maddow @jaketapperhttp://www.rawstory.com/2016/12/trump-campaign-files-objection-to-jill-steins-lawless-insulting-michigan-recount/#.WECwsAB0VJo.twitter
804464608450854912 2016-12-01 23:18:03 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah HRC should have ran ads spelling it out and maybe added some cats to the ads too.  Low info voters generally don't read.
804460586813767680 2016-12-01 23:02:04 UTC <Vva10967> @samsteinhp @peterdaou @annaleclaire People like you are the problem.  Hope you enjoy Trump. You elected him with your hate for Hillary.
804459480301916160 2016-12-01 22:57:40 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou I agree with U but Sam Stein's numbers R off. The recount needs to flip the full 79,319 votes that Trump is ahead by to celebrate
804433418972839937 2016-12-01 21:14:07 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod CNN is having an effect on you, lol.  No offense but it seems it's frying your brain. Quit it before it's too late.
804431490180268033 2016-12-01 21:06:27 UTC <Vva10967> @guycecil which explains why HRC running to continue Obama legacy didn't appeal at all to Trump voters, they live in an alternate reality.
804429714383192064 2016-12-01 20:59:24 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes You're such a Bernie fan.
804429344277872640 2016-12-01 20:57:55 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow Thank God! @hardball with Chris Matthews is unbearable to watch @MSNBC, he's sooo giddy about Trump, makes me puke.
804428714867978240 2016-12-01 20:55:25 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald Gary's vote was way larger than Jill's. Likely Berners voting against Hillary because Bernie told them she was corrupt.
804427937449549824 2016-12-01 20:52:20 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald Bet most of her voters are Bernie supporters who were convinced by Bernie that Hillary is corrupt & blamed HRC for his loss
804412678525435904 2016-12-01 19:51:42 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs I would bet they were Bernie voters who blame Hillary for his loss.
804411918148464640 2016-12-01 19:48:41 UTC <Vva10967> @JerryBrownGov @RepBecerra Congratulations!
804411099932082176 2016-12-01 19:45:26 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Trump is apparently worried about those recounts. WI margin is 22.177, PA is down to 46,435 & MI is 10,707. Total 79,319.
804410763662139392 2016-12-01 19:44:05 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Gary Johnson is the Ralph Nader.  She's roughly at the typical !% or under that Green party gets. He's not. He's way up.
804410251474653185 2016-12-01 19:42:03 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah he's also term limited as Governor. Election is in 2017,
804407511600209920 2016-12-01 19:31:10 UTC <Vva10967> @docwindprod It was always like he was afraid 2 take sides w/ African Americans. HRC didn't have that fear & didn't have it in Senate either
804407107160342528 2016-12-01 19:29:34 UTC <Vva10967> @docwindprod HRC would have been a better leader than Obama. Obama never really stood up for the African Americans who elected him.
804406705551351808 2016-12-01 19:27:58 UTC <Vva10967> @docwindprod You are SO bitter.  The Dems need to shake up the bitter people like you, it's unproductive. You should go form your own party.
804406370422390784 2016-12-01 19:26:38 UTC <Vva10967> @docwindprod Nop. Johnson votes tracks Dem losses in votes.  Jill stayed at the normal 1% or under that the Green party typically gets.
804403742703554560 2016-12-01 19:16:12 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn please tell me it's a joke? Trump didn't actually say that, did he?
804402591132188674 2016-12-01 19:11:37 UTC <Vva10967> @richardmskinner @Nate_Cohn @Joseph100960 Now they get to find out what that entailed. And on top of that they want to hijack the Dem party!
804399962608074753 2016-12-01 19:01:10 UTC <Vva10967> @docwindprod The Party is NOT Dying.  She won over 65 MILLION VOTES. Berners screwed her with 3rd party votes. That's a fact.
804398721710649344 2016-12-01 18:56:14 UTC <Vva10967> @wisgop @RDHague You can't steal what isn't yours.  And they seem a bit fearful, no?
804227709341724672 2016-11-30 07:36:42 UTC <Vva10967> @ElectProject but if Gov is Democrat will decision still be appealed?
804223981817565184 2016-11-30 07:21:53 UTC <Vva10967> @marceelias can't believe you gave this reporter an interview. He's such a Hillary hater. Can never say a single positive thing about her.
804178102624649216 2016-11-30 04:19:35 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Chris Matthews is unwatchable though. He was always giddy about Trump becoming POTUS, his secret cheerleader.
804176919335993344 2016-11-30 04:14:53 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou agree 100% with you and he never walked it back.
804176064012582912 2016-11-30 04:11:29 UTC <Vva10967> @jonlovett @jonfavs did you know that 1000s of Berners "traded" 3rd party votes in swing states for 3rd party votes in safe blue states?pic.twitter.com/59RO5yZv9u
804170008138018816 2016-11-30 03:47:25 UTC <Vva10967> @jonlovett actually true.  For them the primary didn't end until Election Day and they voted for Gary to say FU to HRC, making Trump POTUS
804161702686236673 2016-11-30 03:14:25 UTC <Vva10967> @ToddCmii it's spelled "since" not sense. And as to Carrier Pence offered them incentives to stay which Trump has said is stupid thing to do
804160815184117760 2016-11-30 03:10:53 UTC <Vva10967> @dsgoldfield22 That's what happens when your leader feeds you a myth. He lost by 4 million votes. No stealing.
804160343807295488 2016-11-30 03:09:01 UTC <Vva10967> @Redistrict CA has 600,000 left to go.
804160241818599424 2016-11-30 03:08:36 UTC <Vva10967> @Redistrict have WA, OR and CO finished counting their ballots?
804098515291033602 2016-11-30 23:03:20 UTC <Vva10967> @ToddCmii I read their signs, most can't spell. Seems to be a common trait among them. Not so on the left. Just the facts.
804098087845318671 2016-11-30 23:01:38 UTC <Vva10967> @ToddCmii lol, should be "could not spell well".
804097876041355269 2016-11-30 23:00:47 UTC <Vva10967> @ToddCmii LOL, then you should criticize Trump & the GOP leadership, not ours. That's like Bernie criticizing the Dems when he isn't one.
804096341538381824 2016-11-30 22:54:41 UTC <Vva10967> no, disgruntled Bernie voters choosing to vote third party in MI, PA & WI just to say FU to Hillary. They elected Trump.
804096040483901443 2016-11-30 22:53:30 UTC <Vva10967> @dccc @abigailgardner @JoyAnnReid @YusefFarrell actually they gained 6 seats in the House.
804094560796364800 2016-11-30 22:47:37 UTC <Vva10967> @ToddCmii In which case I don't get why you're opining on who the Dems elect or not?
804094349755764743 2016-11-30 22:46:46 UTC <Vva10967> @ToddCmii No offense but you should learn to spell. You're sounding like a Trumper.  Maybe you are?
804093966627065859 2016-11-30 22:45:15 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @Chrispydoggy Better than the Bernie fools who cast 3rd party protest votes in MI PA & WI and elected Trump.
804021359642812417 2016-11-30 17:56:44 UTC <Vva10967> @ToddCmii what's the "new blood" going to do? Ryan controls the House for the next 2 years. At least in Senate they can filibuster & block
804020186806448128 2016-11-30 17:52:05 UTC <Vva10967> @ToddCmii at what? she pulls her caucus, fundraises, stands up for progressive values. House doesn't have filibuster or procedural tools.
804015325230596101 2016-11-30 17:32:46 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @kasie @NancyPelosi @TamronMSNBC last time I checked 68% IS more than 2/3, lol. You approach Nancy as you approached Hillary. BAD.
804012557719797760 2016-11-30 17:21:46 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Thank God. I would have lost faith in the Democratic party had Nancy too been pushed aside.

803828965706203137 2016-11-29 05:12:14 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh it's really hard to tell apart Trumpers from Berners just by looking at their twits.These 2 old white men attracted similar types
803819594662158336 2016-11-29 04:35:00 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh you have more patience than me, lol. She's a Trump troll so I blocked her.  Deplorables will be Deplorables.

803392075626586112 2016-11-28 00:16:11 UTC <Vva10967> Nop, no landslide. And nop, no mandate either since Hillary is winning the popular vote by over 2.3 million votes. Just an accidental POTUS.https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/803351590342131712

803056713007972353 2016-11-27 02:03:35 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh wonder when he'll realize that Hillary's concession isn't binding, lol.  Love seeing you on Joy Reid's show by the way.
803056210656120832 2016-11-27 02:01:35 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh he sounds scared, lol.  Maybe he knows Putin rigged those states for him and will be found out.
803055196691722240 2016-11-27 01:57:33 UTC <Vva10967> @AriBerman does your book list the voter suppression laws in the various states?
803040405344448516 2016-11-27 00:58:47 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews you are failing to mention that his source is Alex Jones' InfoWars. No, I'm not kidding.
803038968342310912 2016-11-27 00:53:04 UTC <Vva10967> The "Hillary Bitches" guy from the Delta flight video has been ID'd. His name is Jamie Finnefrock, lives in PA & works for @RockwellCollins https://twitter.com/yashar/status/803020477509804036
803036605279670272 2016-11-27 00:43:41 UTC <Vva10967> @Reuters maybe you should note that Trump is getting his news on this from Alex Jones' InfoWars.  Bet that'd be newsworthy to most.
803030031371042817 2016-11-27 00:17:33 UTC <Vva10967> @TheDemocrats @chuckschumer @NancyPelosi @SenWarren @timkaine @guycecil Something to keep in mind re voter registration laws.https://twitter.com/AriBerman/status/803026747537129473
803008055705300997 2016-11-27 22:50:14 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews @CBS you are blowing it! you're supposed to be journalists, not parrots!https://twitter.com/jonfavs/status/802995114016546816
802995597271699456 2016-11-27 22:00:43 UTC <Vva10967> Seems Trump is bothered by the fact that the people voted for HILLARY and the Electoral College will be awarding him the position he LOST.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802972944532209664
802985597845598208 2016-11-27 21:20:59 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn @RocketHamster03 the ones who have gotten caught have all been Republicans....
802985404106469380 2016-11-27 21:20:13 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn seems that losing the popular vote is getting into his thin skin.
802983643564179456 2016-11-27 21:13:13 UTC <Vva10967> @chucktodd @JackTapper @HardballChris @wolfblitzer @nytimes @washingtonpost Seems to have worked like a charm, no?https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/802953567506206720
802982695231844352 2016-11-27 21:09:27 UTC <Vva10967> @billmaher that thinking IS what lost us the election.  Berners voted Trump as POTUS to say FU to HRC. For them primary never ended.
802980813449072640 2016-11-27 21:01:59 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn @RocketHamster03 Actually when they do, they vote GOP because they believe all the right wing nonsense about not getting caught.
802980295469318144 2016-11-27 20:59:55 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn Remember that Trump projects. He told us election would be rigged. Now he's telling us that there were millions of illegal votes.
802978260787331072 2016-11-27 20:51:50 UTC <Vva10967> @freedom4all117 The Senate was meant to ensure states got treated equally.  The EC wasn't. The House wasn't either.
802977562683211776 2016-11-27 20:49:04 UTC <Vva10967> @Spkr2theDead that is true now under the Electoral College. The candidates visit only the "swing states" and ignore the rest.
802763953558392832 2016-11-26 06:40:15 UTC <Vva10967> and it's obvious that you (and the Donald) are afraid of the recount.
802761645730709504 2016-11-26 06:31:05 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein because Republicans can only win by cheating? Too afraid of 1 person 1 vote?
802761125859237889 2016-11-26 06:29:01 UTC <Vva10967> We should have taken care of the EC the first time it happened in 2000 with Gore. So our bad. But we can't let it happen again. Compact 2018https://twitter.com/vva10967/status/802720622899957762
802759220605157376 2016-11-26 06:21:27 UTC <Vva10967> @WDFx2EU16 @spacecalls oh look an angry egg!
802757880839553024 2016-11-26 06:16:07 UTC <Vva10967> Were you absent the day Federalist papers were taught?  EC was intended to stop someone like Trump not rubber stamp him. Read # 69.
802756850131275777 2016-11-26 06:12:02 UTC <Vva10967> @spacecalls @WDFx2EU16 Educate yourself: most of that redness is empty land and cows. They don't vote.
802727715690446848 2016-11-26 04:16:16 UTC <Vva10967> @jonlovett she's not terribly different than Comrade Bernie.  I'm surprise he hasn't issued a statement praising Fidel and HIS revolution.
802726340189421568 2016-11-26 04:10:48 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @nytimes was too busy with HRC's emails and Comey's letter to pay attention to Trump's conflicts.
802726013033730048 2016-11-26 04:09:30 UTC <Vva10967> And I seem to recall that he said NO, it shouldn't be accepted unless you yourself win.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802723588759375873
802721326918156288 2016-11-26 03:50:52 UTC <Vva10967> @spacecalls you're confusing the recount/audit petition w the Popular Vote Compact.  The Compact can't happen before 2018 or 2020.
802720622899957762 2016-11-26 03:48:04 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein @spacecalls Nop. Whoever wins the most votes should win the office he/she is running for.
802715244598611969 2016-11-26 03:26:42 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein @spacecalls oh the signing of the compact is for 2020.  States w 165 EC votes have signed, need states with total of 105 more
802711500775424000 2016-11-26 03:11:50 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein Hillary would do it. She was after all the plaintiff in the Citizens United lawsuit. Hell would freeze over before Trump would.
802710898645180416 2016-11-26 03:09:26 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein well we could ALL work to get the Popular Vote Compact signed by sufficient states to reach 270 electoral college votes.
802710443198443520 2016-11-26 03:07:37 UTC <Vva10967> @RobertsDan what assh*les! Both of them. And @BernieSanders isn't even a Democrat and wants to hijack the party. @SpikeLee sounds like a WLB
802707798605856768 2016-11-26 02:57:07 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah LOL. I'm surprised Comrade Bernie hasn't issued a similar statement yet.
802634703455059968 2016-11-26 22:06:40 UTC <Vva10967> @DecisionDeskHQ @EsotericCD but U know, prior 2 this election MSM had lost all credibility from the right. Now you've lost all from the left
802624636039155712 2016-11-26 21:26:39 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem actually I was listening to a 2015 podcast interview of HRC where she's asked what she does to relax and that was her answer
802624148849573888 2016-11-26 21:24:43 UTC <Vva10967> @CornFedIABoy same type. Sams is owned by Walmart. Costco's its own publicly traded company. Bet @mattyglesias would be as happy at SamsClub
802619449891233792 2016-11-26 21:06:03 UTC <Vva10967> HFA's statement announcing their participation in the WI, PA & MI vote recounts. https://medium.com/@marceelias/listening-and-responding-to-calls-for-an-audit-and-recount-2a904717ea39#.b41kyr2o9
802597161036840960 2016-11-26 19:37:29 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias maybe Trump voters don't have Costcos nearby?  LOL. Their problem is that they elect Republicans at state level so remain poor
802596627911475200 2016-11-26 19:35:22 UTC <Vva10967> Yeay! Yes We Can! #StrongerTogether #StillWithHerhttps://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/802552154833698818
802596193935257603 2016-11-26 19:33:38 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro @ahumorlessfem lol, to be fair, she's always said that she hikes with Bill and her dogs to relax. Not a new thing for her.
802591172506058753 2016-11-26 19:13:41 UTC <Vva10967> mmmm, actually Raul Castro has been governing Cuba for the past few years. He's still alive and in power. So not quite there yet.https://twitter.com/mike_pence/status/802557437786066944
802590409348304896 2016-11-26 19:10:39 UTC <Vva10967> @Saberghoff @althaea_flicek @lilithinzion well it could detect if the tallying machines counted the paper ballots correctly.
802400723497406465 2016-11-25 06:36:55 UTC <Vva10967> @Saberghoff true but maybe like the rest of us, she wasn't really expecting Trump to win. Or she could know those states WERE rigged.
802400197276041216 2016-11-25 06:34:49 UTC <Vva10967> @Saberghoff @althaea_flicek well if rigging occurred and HRC won those states, she gets their electoral votes and wins the election.
802397564595212288 2016-11-25 06:24:21 UTC <Vva10967> @MarlonASoto he's making lots of money off it. He'd have made $$$ off paid speeches if he wasn't prohibited by law as Senator/Congressman
802361058606325760 2016-11-25 03:59:18 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias don't be too sure.  Jill's recount could yield a December surprise.  Everything else about election has been "unprecedented"
802360256445771776 2016-11-25 03:56:06 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias @CorinneAM @MarlonASoto You realize that he's doing a BOOK TOUR, right? He signed a contract with his publisher & must do it.
802317035405475840 2016-11-25 01:04:22 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid thanks for always keeping everyone honest!  I can't stand the MSNBC morning lineup where they just let Trump surrogates go on.
802314218930401280 2016-11-25 00:53:10 UTC <Vva10967> @politicususa No Sh*t.  Rachel Maddow and Joy Reid reported on this BEFORE the Election. Rest of media didn't.
802313965204213760 2016-11-25 00:52:10 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra who is the schmuck? a white dude? he needs to look up Sierra Blanca and then revise his opinion as to Bernie's being so pure.
802313283680272384 2016-11-25 00:49:27 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper that bunny in the movie was a bit intense for young kids though
802312060273119232 2016-11-25 00:44:36 UTC <Vva10967> @nytpolitics no, you and rest of MSM made it all about HRC's emails.
802287236947525632 2016-11-25 23:05:57 UTC <Vva10967> @davidegreenwald so what is the difference now in votes between HRC and Trump in WI?
802277169984585729 2016-11-25 22:25:57 UTC <Vva10967> @leahmcelrath I'm pretty sure that Germany CAN regulate hate speech. No 1st Amendment there.
802276849971765248 2016-11-25 22:24:41 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 you underestimate the stupidity of the right. Saw Trump followers on FB arguing Pope had endorsed Trump & Snopes was lying.
802276437973569536 2016-11-25 22:23:03 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @Tim_Glinski Yeah, from Bannon.
802276337352216576 2016-11-25 22:22:39 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure he's not but Bannon is. How do you think he got elected?
802275762627710976 2016-11-25 22:20:22 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @jeffjarvis @fran_the_man apparently Obama wants a "smooth transition" for Trump.  #DemocratsAreWeak
802275152943718400 2016-11-25 22:17:56 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid yes, but the White House apparently told her to stand down bc she might disrupt Trump's transition. #DemocratsAreWeak
802274865780768770 2016-11-25 22:16:48 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid well she's not herself doing the manual recount, she's just the one w/standing willing to contest the counts.
802273093418819584 2016-11-25 22:09:45 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @Bosalto you mean the guy who refuses his daily Presidential briefings? lol. We'll likely get attacked bc he cant pay attention.
802272594376335360 2016-11-25 22:07:46 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @waltb31 Jill has filed, so no scam.
802269974995681280 2016-11-25 21:57:22 UTC <Vva10967> @ByronTau no wonder the guy lost the election.  Amazing that was the best Dems could do back then.
802269381241794560 2016-11-25 21:55:00 UTC <Vva10967> It's hard to fix stupid IMO.https://twitter.com/tripgabriel/status/802196650794033152
802267953487982593 2016-11-25 21:49:20 UTC <Vva10967> @sahilkapur not to rub it in, but perhaps if you all had spent less time on HRC's emails and more on real reporting you would have caught it

802210311612796928 2016-11-25 18:00:17 UTC <Vva10967> @KPhed yeah but the experts also felt that Trump couldn't win and here we are. Dems don't like to rock the boat, they lack a spine.
802209156526731264 2016-11-25 17:55:41 UTC <Vva10967> @greenhousenyt I thought Trump's slogan was to Drain the Swamp, not fill it up?
802198238791090177 2016-11-25 17:12:18 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC @TheDemocrats @WhiteHouse & @POTUS lack the backbone 2 take it on. @GOP @SpeakerRyan & @jasoninthehouse lack the morals 2 do it
802196795480805376 2016-11-25 17:06:34 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias what's infill housing?
802196707979182080 2016-11-25 17:06:13 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias she DID talk about electrical grid infrastructure. I think it went over people's heads. Maybe she should've used talking cats?
802196349122965504 2016-11-25 17:04:48 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias do U seriously think rural America understands antitrust laws & policy? Same people that bought his Only I Can Fix It? & MAGA?
802195506256642048 2016-11-25 17:01:27 UTC <Vva10967> @aravosis I thought I read somewhere that they were going to Nicaragua instead?
802194111663132673 2016-11-25 16:55:54 UTC <Vva10967> @BaltimorePolice @expandyourfocus since Hillary lost & Trump won, dead I guess. We'll now move to Law & Order aka Stop & Frisk instead.
802192312919093248 2016-11-25 16:48:46 UTC <Vva10967> @JesseFFerguson Samantha Bee's Full Frontal was only media 2 report it. MSM failed miserably, too busy with emails.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OauLuWXD_RI
802185666666827776 2016-11-25 16:22:21 UTC <Vva10967> @jimsciutto Sadly @SpeakerRyan @jasoninthehouse R only interested in political witch hunts against HRC. No morals or patriotism left in them
802183919877636096 2016-11-25 16:15:25 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost yet only media 2 report it PRIOR to Election was Samantha Bee's Full Frontal. Real media all failed.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OauLuWXD_RI
802183167142662144 2016-11-25 16:12:25 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost lol you all said the same thing about the possibility of Trump winning the Presidency and here we are. #AuditTheVote
802181658560655360 2016-11-25 16:06:25 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Take a look at Full Frontal's report on this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OauLuWXD_RI
802178308712566784 2016-11-25 15:53:07 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid and only one to report it in real time was Samantha Bee's Full Frontal. MSM ignored it, maybe assumed she was joking.
802177929346240516 2016-11-25 15:51:36 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro Only media 2 report this was @iamsambee's Full Frontal. Real MSM failed miserably. @nytimes @CNN @MSNBC were too busy w emails.
802176608480227328 2016-11-25 15:46:21 UTC <Vva10967> 3. @PoliticsWolf if it turns out that top vote was hacked, down ballot could have been hacked too.
802176364031918084 2016-11-25 15:45:23 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @PoliticsWolf bring into question if Senate wins were legit or not in WI & PA and maybe also NC and FL.
802176198327537664 2016-11-25 15:44:44 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @PoliticsWolf disagree, recount if successful (& with Russian hacking that's a real possibility) has higher payout chance and could also

801820248764743682 2016-11-24 16:10:19 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Thankful for you and @maddow too.
801817390258540544 2016-11-24 15:58:57 UTC <Vva10967> @GideonResnick maybe @BernieSanders is so white that he didn't see Hillary was standing for OUR civil rights & 4 an inclusive & hopeful USA
801815744115867648 2016-11-24 15:52:25 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure The hate of the Far Left 4 Hillary elected him. He got less than 46% of the votes cast. Would not have been enough. Hate Trumped Love
801813653838295044 2016-11-24 15:44:06 UTC <Vva10967> @rtraister but it is. Trump won EC thanks to 110,000 Berners voting 3rd party in MI PA & WI to say FU to Hillary. Our Far Left elected him.

801635773959311360 2016-11-23 03:57:16 UTC <Vva10967> @robreiner Republicans have become the Party of Trump.  They lack moral courage by definition. So no.
801635445981507584 2016-11-23 03:55:58 UTC <Vva10967> @johnpodesta please request the MI WI & PA recount. The damage Trump will do will be irreversible. Ignore the White House. They're 2 passive
801634622895484928 2016-11-23 03:52:42 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden if White House is telling Hillary NOT to request the recount, she should IGNORE THEM. We NEED the recount. She's our President.
801634283957977088 2016-11-23 03:51:21 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden why won't @HillaryClinton request the recount if it's as cheap as Jill Stein says? We'll never recover from a Trump presidency!
801484814968901632 2016-11-23 17:57:25 UTC <Vva10967> @nifkinjuice and the damage done by W to world peace proved to be irreversible. People need to own the consequences of their votes.
801484358947373057 2016-11-23 17:55:36 UTC <Vva10967> @nifkinjuice and union members will now get screwed by Trump when he appoints the NLRB members. And no, low skill manuf'g isn't coming back
801483991161438208 2016-11-23 17:54:09 UTC <Vva10967> @nifkinjuice You can now trace her loss to 55,000 third party votes COMBINED in MI WI & PA. Berners were even trading protest votes on FB.
801483337344962560 2016-11-23 17:51:33 UTC <Vva10967> @nifkinjuice I'm looking at the raw numbers. Facts matter. Berners elected Trump. Trump voters didn't.
801482888118206465 2016-11-23 17:49:46 UTC <Vva10967> @nifkinjuice she didn't expect Berners in MI PA & WI to vote 3rd party just to say FU to her. Thought their love of country would prevail.

801477821386387456 2016-11-23 17:29:38 UTC <Vva10967> @SarahEMcBride It's really the Berners, the same people who gave the election to Trump by voting 3rd party in MI PA & WI to say FU to HRC
801473879759847424 2016-11-23 17:13:58 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 as a New Yorker, he may not have understood her reply, lol.
801472314957320192 2016-11-23 17:07:45 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @busywriting @bipolarlioness extension 5 is not working.  Now you have to hit 0 to get the operator.
801318650795921408 2016-11-22 06:57:08 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @Cajsa No, if she wins it'll be because a majority of that state voted for her. State won't ignore the vote of its own citizens.
801317894546198529 2016-11-22 06:54:08 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @busywriting @bipolarlioness ext 4 is for leaving a message.  Apparently Ext 5 gets you a DOJ operator you can talk to.
801317433856376833 2016-11-22 06:52:18 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid they could appoint a Special Prosecutor, as was done to Bill Clinton i.e. Ken Starr.

801174763385262080 2016-11-22 21:25:23 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden what's alternative media?
801174142460383233 2016-11-22 21:22:55 UTC <Vva10967> @ElectProject one more Q, since FL has certified its vote count, can you still have a recount of Broward & Miami Dade or is that precluded?
801173719020355588 2016-11-22 21:21:14 UTC <Vva10967> @ElectProject can you clarify? I don't follow you here.
801172541498949632 2016-11-22 21:16:33 UTC <Vva10967> @ElectProject but in PA any 3 citizens of the county can trigger a recount in their county, correct? And where is Michigan in its counting?
801105193668640768 2016-11-22 16:48:56 UTC <Vva10967> @JeffreyToobin @DevlinBarrett There was NOTHING to prosecute AT ALL. The MSM made both into "scandals", ALL FOR RATINGS & to have horserace

801095068002222080 2016-11-22 16:08:42 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro well NBC owns Telemundo. As to Univision,I can't say I feel sorry for them. Jorge Ramos slandered Hillary & played false equiv 2
800940178093342720 2016-11-21 05:53:13 UTC <Vva10967> @MoveOn DEMAND A RECOUNT IN WI, MI, PA, AZ, NC and FL http://petitions.moveon.org/s/f9udkQ @moveon
800914440862502912 2016-11-21 04:10:57 UTC <Vva10967> @aravosis but we should have known as it's consistent with everything else we know about him. Trump University, not paying suppliers, etc.
800913822987014145 2016-11-21 04:08:30 UTC <Vva10967> So no, it wasn't her message of inclusion but 110,000 hateful Berners who voted 3rd party in MI WI & PA 2 screw her who lost us the electionhttps://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/800877825037312000

800912304590069760 2016-11-21 04:02:28 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs the difference was the Berners voting third party in MI PA & WI to say FU to Hillary.  THEY elected Trump, not his own supporters.
800911373052084224 2016-11-21 03:58:46 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh yeah but we lost the election due to 110,000 Berners voting 3rd party in MI PA & WI, NOT due to Trump's own supporters #truth
800910189775831040 2016-11-21 03:54:04 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra the Bernie Bros in MI PA & WI lost us the election, THEY elected Trump w their 3rd party votes. Cannot be rewarded for it.
800832442097692672 2016-11-21 22:45:07 UTC <Vva10967> So much for counting on the media to keep an eye on Trump! http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-network-anchors-meeting_us_583333f6e4b058ce7aac3fc0?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004 via @HuffPostMedia

800523370802581504 2016-11-20 02:16:59 UTC <Vva10967> @ElectProject are they still counting votes in PA?  how long before they certify vote count? Thanks!
800523177734483968 2016-11-20 02:16:13 UTC <Vva10967> @ElectProject what's the law for requesting recounts in Florida counties (e.g. Miami Dade & Broward)?  In Michigan?  In Wisconsin?  Thanks!
800521934672982016 2016-11-20 02:11:16 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid looks like CBS was shamed, they removed the false tweet.
800521078816800768 2016-11-20 02:07:52 UTC <Vva10967> 10. @JoyAnnReid unclassified work communications, i.e. things NOT marked classified. So no, she didn't lie. Media muddled the 2.
800520667619852288 2016-11-20 02:06:14 UTC <Vva10967> 9. @JoyAnnReid clouded, that everything MARKED classified was transmitted in the CLASSIFIED system & that her server only dealt with the
800520459884359680 2016-11-20 02:05:25 UTC <Vva10967> 8 @JoyAnnReid And when Hillary talked to foreign leaders she used the classified phone system. That's also something the media reports
800519129547599872 2016-11-20 02:00:08 UTC <Vva10967> 7. @JoyAnnReid today gmail offers a cloud service where you can get your own domain 4 email so you no longer need a personal server to do it
800517818194137088 2016-11-20 01:54:55 UTC <Vva10967> 6. @JoyAnnReid own domains to run your businesses (paid speeches, presidential library, CF) and not do it via a yahoo, aol or gmail account.
800517505823469568 2016-11-20 01:53:40 UTC <Vva10967> 5. @JoyAnnReid and either MacOS Server or Windows Server 2008 or 2012 as the operating system. And as a former President, you would get your
800516785653092356 2016-11-20 01:50:49 UTC <Vva10967> 4. @JoyAnnReid because it was out of the way, no other reason. And those servers were basically desktops with 2 hard drives & twice the RAM
800516462871920640 2016-11-20 01:49:32 UTC <Vva10967> 3. @JoyAnnReid install the software we needed and have everyone in our team be able to access the files they needed; why in the basement?

800110704128884736 2016-11-19 22:57:11 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid saw a Trump voter arguing on FB that the Pope had endorsed Trump & that Snopes was lying when it said that was false!
800106409102868480 2016-11-19 22:40:07 UTC <Vva10967> @OnlyWhiteTiger it sure feels that way every time I watch the news.  I end up feeling nauseous listening to his vile cabinet picks.
800105564818771969 2016-11-19 22:36:46 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT read this thread. You too should talk to W's ethics lawyer about how his DC hotel will make him violate US Constitution on day 1https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/800072169632002048
800104900596273152 2016-11-19 22:34:08 UTC <Vva10967> @jonlovett @Soulo_Guero would be ironic when Comey was the AG that put Martha in jail.

800046288171479040 2016-11-19 18:41:13 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller on the contrary, EC is supposed to prevent someone like Trump from becoming POTUS.  Read Federalist Paper 68.

800045606928580609 2016-11-19 18:38:31 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller but is anyone investigating the hacking? could vote tallying machines have been hacked in FL PA WI MI or NC?

800043790144770049 2016-11-19 18:31:18 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @SenSanders YOUR followers voted Trump in because you slandered Hillary wrt the speeches & donations. You knew you were lyinghttps://twitter.com/matteroffacttv/status/800039691605123072
800042013152411648 2016-11-19 18:24:14 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro it's actually a distraction from the media covering the Trump University $25 Million settlement.
800016562916835328 2016-11-19 16:43:06 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @AriBerman could these voters w/o ID have cast provisional ballots? did they know that? do we know if some did? has WI finished tallying?
800016164147658752 2016-11-19 16:41:31 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @AriBerman wasn't there a court order requiring WI to issue the IDs? who was the plaintiff in that lawsuit?
800014471838179328 2016-11-19 16:34:48 UTC <Vva10967> @AriBerman would your book cover which states have enacted voter suppression laws since SCOTUS gutted VRA? Couldn't tell from TOC. Thanks.
800013900771184640 2016-11-19 16:32:32 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @MalcolmNance and if so, who investigates that? consequences are too dire to let Russia win here
800013684948996096 2016-11-19 16:31:40 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @MalcolmNance is it possible that the voter tally machines in FL NC PA MI or WI were compromised? FL vote didn't match polls + early
800012898261155840 2016-11-19 16:28:33 UTC <Vva10967> @MalcolmNance why is Clapper resigning & not investigating Trump's communications w & ties to Russia during campaign?
799844745874907136 2016-11-18 05:20:22 UTC <Vva10967> And Hillary was supposed to appeal to these people? Seriously?https://twitter.com/KagroX/status/799834547756158976
799844113625608192 2016-11-18 05:17:51 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT they're reaping what they sowed.  Get used to it.
799822906998030336 2016-11-18 03:53:35 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs Bernie contradicts himself. One day he calls Trump an ally, the next he says he'll fight back. Dems need to learn from McConnell.
799821127912722432 2016-11-18 03:46:31 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs maybe Obama should have invited that fool to the White House after he won GOP primary and showed him what being POTUS entailed.
799820376209559553 2016-11-18 03:43:32 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro Maybe @mike_pence should read Hamilton in Federalist Paper #68, bet he'd find his thoughts about role of EC interesting.
799812693515440128 2016-11-18 03:13:00 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro I have to wonder if Trump didn't just bring him in to tease & humiliate him as payback. Guess we'll see.
799781850810122240 2016-11-18 01:10:27 UTC <Vva10967> @johnpodesta surely your team has looked into this possibility, no? Trump projects & told us election WOULD be rigged.Maybe Russia told him?https://twitter.com/Vva10967/status/799770995741655040
799781521896996867 2016-11-18 01:09:08 UTC <Vva10967> @yottapoint because it detracts from his Political Revolution/class warfare message
799777258454089729 2016-11-18 00:52:12 UTC <Vva10967> @AlexMohajer @StonZMGMT what's a Crosscheck purge list?
799775298841677824 2016-11-18 00:44:25 UTC <Vva10967> @johnpodesta could Trump have known Russia would hack some voting machines since he always projects & did say election was going tb rigged?https://twitter.com/AlexMohajer/status/799017677545086976
799772335364575232 2016-11-18 00:32:38 UTC <Vva10967> whatever happened to Trump's claim that he gets the best people???https://twitter.com/voxdotcom/status/799646030870429696
799771751433572356 2016-11-18 00:30:19 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @LawrenceHughes Trump has projected the entire election & was saying that the election was going to be rigged. Maybe he knew it?
799770995741655040 2016-11-18 00:27:19 UTC <Vva10967> Youre not just imagining it: the Hillary Clinton vs Donald Trump vote totals do look rigged http://www.palmerreport.com/opinion/youre-not-just-imagining-it-the-hillary-clinton-vs-donald-trump-vote-totals-do-look-rigged/104/
799765719751819264 2016-11-18 00:06:21 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro wow, maybe you should send a copy to @marcorubio
799743047185465344 2016-11-18 22:36:15 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid maybe Obama will give him a call to keep him from signing it.
799742164775403525 2016-11-18 22:32:45 UTC <Vva10967> @SenatorSchumer @SenatorReid @SenSanders "Not sure" is being kind here.https://twitter.com/SimonWDC/status/799599885087633408
799739423021744136 2016-11-18 22:21:51 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure how so? Because WWC hate powerful women? If Dems go that route they're going to lose progressive women from their coalition.
799738583477166080 2016-11-18 22:18:31 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 he should just switch parties, lol.
799737713486245890 2016-11-18 22:15:03 UTC <Vva10967> @KellieThomas8 Hope you enjoy the next 4 years of President Trump and AG Jeff Sessions who'll put BLM in terrorist org list. Should be fun.
799726763974782977 2016-11-18 21:31:33 UTC <Vva10967> @noamscheiber actually no, BernieBusters voting for Gary in those states account for it.  His voters didn't elect him, Bernie's did.

799351573382070272 2016-11-17 20:40:40 UTC <Vva10967> @PoliticsWolf why should she step down? She was the most effective speaker ever & position has no power if GOP is in control.
799351046137118721 2016-11-17 20:38:35 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko let's hope so.
799349993484283905 2016-11-17 20:34:24 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald it's about race and misogyny, WWC not liking to have a black man or a woman as POTUS.
799349149195964416 2016-11-17 20:31:03 UTC <Vva10967> @ZacFellows1 difference is our party cares, GOP doesn't. Maybe you should join GOP since you obviously wouldn't care?

799331710760615936 2016-11-17 19:21:45 UTC <Vva10967> @ZacFellows1 So you can get off your Bernie bubble here's some of the oppo research GOP did on him:http://bit.ly/2fSQAEH
799330434924576770 2016-11-17 19:16:41 UTC <Vva10967> @ZacFellows1 you mean the guy who wrote that women fantasize about being raped by 3 men? & that children should touch each other's genitalia
799138196357607424 2016-11-16 06:32:47 UTC <Vva10967> @chrsdcook you did & should own it. Facts matter but then again Berners sucked at math in primary. Hope you enjoy next 4 yrs of Trump.
799137579236990976 2016-11-16 06:30:20 UTC <Vva10967> @chrsdcook no he slandered her. And had been the nominee we would have president Bloomberg which I suppose is better than President Trump
799136914733404160 2016-11-16 06:27:42 UTC <Vva10967> @chrsdcook she won the popular vote by over 2 million. You Berners screwed us and the world with your hate. You don't deserve ANY reward.
799136007778140160 2016-11-16 06:24:06 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn @AP @STL_Blonde no CA has close to 4 million left to count.
799135714495578112 2016-11-16 06:22:56 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn @zionnenko CA has large mail in vote. Took full month to count primary votes.

799131495411630081 2016-11-16 06:06:10 UTC <Vva10967> @chrsdcook lol so you Berners believed Bernie's lies about Hillary & handed the world over to Trump!
799130527685025793 2016-11-16 06:02:19 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @carolhoernlein and the 110,000 Berners who voted for Gary in MI PA & WI just to say FU to Hillary elected Trump
799126479623880704 2016-11-16 05:46:14 UTC <Vva10967> @UniNoticias el no, sino los 110,000 burros seguidores de Bernie que votaron por Gary en MI PA y WI dandole el triunfo a Trump
799055659929059328 2016-11-16 01:04:49 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra to Sanders EVERYTHING is about class warfare and he's stuck in 2008 obsessed with breaking up the banks.
799055417536106496 2016-11-16 01:03:51 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra they were too privileged to care that Trump election would validate hate & bigotry & misogyny.
799054991998730245 2016-11-16 01:02:10 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra his followers lost us the election by casting 110,000 3rd party protest votes for Gary in MI, PA & WI because they hate HRC.
799044800741863425 2016-11-16 00:21:40 UTC <Vva10967> @jess_mc @allinwithchris @jason_w_simmons when Warren ran 4 Senator, the media covered her the same way they covered Hillary, as inauthentic
799022760634830862 2016-11-16 22:54:05 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @ZacFellows1 So he damaged her in the primary and never walked it back.  Also dragged primary saying it was rigged.
799022493310865418 2016-11-16 22:53:02 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @ZacFellows1 which 2 me suggests she's dishonest & doesn't believe what she's saying if HE says she has to be held  accountable
799022090074685441 2016-11-16 22:51:26 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @ZacFellows1 and his stump speech was more against Trump than FOR Hillary and focused on holding her accountable post Nov 9
799021820410261508 2016-11-16 22:50:21 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @ZacFellows1 he never told his followers that he had LIED when he told them she was a corporate sellout.
799021117126090752 2016-11-16 22:47:34 UTC <Vva10967> @ProgBlacksmith if we wanted someone who didn't advance fracking, we should have chosen HRC over Hope & Change. We didn't. So fracking rules
799020579844214784 2016-11-16 22:45:25 UTC <Vva10967> @ProgBlacksmith the Sec of State & the rest of the President's cabinet advances the POTUS' agenda, not their own. He was always pro-fracking
798790272364617729 2016-11-15 07:30:16 UTC <Vva10967> @MilesPerHoward @ahumorlessfem few people remember that Obama was pro-fracking while she was against it in the 2008 primary.
798783879070920706 2016-11-15 07:04:52 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @ZacFellows1 actually we didn't bet it. Bernie Busters did by casting 110,000 3rd party votes in MI PA & WI to get even at HRC.
798782948283555840 2016-11-15 07:01:10 UTC <Vva10967> Her final total of votes in the primary was 16.9 million.  California just took the full month to count its votes.https://twitter.com/Andabeat/status/798775382929391616
798782461559701504 2016-11-15 06:59:14 UTC <Vva10967> and he'll be defeated in the primary, lol.  And yes, it will be a HE because they'll also assume that a woman can't win.https://twitter.com/YarmondShore/status/798780645744857089
798782077143351296 2016-11-15 06:57:42 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra HRC has stood up for what's right her entire life. In 1999 &  2000 she stood w families of 2 unarmed black men killed by NYPD.
798777869786759169 2016-11-15 06:40:59 UTC <Vva10967> This is how I feel too.  We need to get rid of the Electoral College, NOT change our values and what we stand for in order to cater to WWC.https://twitter.com/smoothkobra/status/798753828640129025
798775469113888768 2016-11-15 06:31:27 UTC <Vva10967> @mckaycoppins a little too late or is it because they think that now that Trump's election has validated bullying it will only get worse?
798774197908426752 2016-11-15 06:26:23 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost some idiots are going to be VERY disappointed when they finally realize that they've been conned.
798773603281973248 2016-11-15 06:24:02 UTC <Vva10967> @markos @stretchdogg I still remember when in 1990s Republicans were livid because Bill Clinton delegated healthcare to Hillary.
798773094361931776 2016-11-15 06:22:00 UTC <Vva10967> @markos someone should tell SIL that it takes brainy Obama 6 hrs to just read them in the PM & he'll have to then explain them to Trump.
798768532435517441 2016-11-15 06:03:53 UTC <Vva10967> @markos wonder if Obama has told him yet about the thick binders he gets after dinner which take him from 8pm to 2am to read.
798767550158905345 2016-11-15 05:59:58 UTC <Vva10967> @markos @KatyTurNBC Press destroyed Hillary's campaign w/ email "scandal" & their "she's so untrustworthy & dislikable" nonsense it's KARMA.
798762772024569857 2016-11-15 05:40:59 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 and we need to get the Popular Vote Compact signed by states with 270 EC Votes.  The MAJORITY of the VOTERS agreed with HRC.
798689677989543936 2016-11-15 00:50:32 UTC <Vva10967> Thank you @SenatorReid for now bowing down to Trump.
798688712058085376 2016-11-15 00:46:42 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports Congrats Andrea! You all fought really hard 2 get him elected.The guy has attention deficit disorder & can't read briefings
798664728893493249 2016-11-15 23:11:24 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou and she stood up for Marriage Equality too.She stood up for inclusion and 4 OUR values & any call to compromise on those is wrong
798664363619938304 2016-11-15 23:09:57 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou she also had the guts to stand up with and for the Mothers of the Movement which not even Obama has done.
798663916784066560 2016-11-15 23:08:10 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou me too. She had the guts to stand up 4 the Dreamers & the children born here who fear their undocumented parents will be deported
798663313508986880 2016-11-15 23:05:47 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou & I consider each & every Bernie Supporter who cast a protest vote in MI, PA & WI to get even at Hillary a TRAITOR 2 this country

798659262448857088 2016-11-15 22:49:41 UTC <Vva10967> A little too late.And his dad, Bush Sr., negotiated and signed it.  Bill Clinton signed it AFTER it was ratified by Congress a year laterhttps://twitter.com/WSJ/status/798655831768174592

798656103613612032 2016-11-15 22:37:08 UTC <Vva10967> 1 @BenLaBolt but we shouldn't overlook that we lost against a white nationalist campaign that appealed 2 WWC's fear of muslims, BLM & LGBTs.
798655044128116736 2016-11-15 22:32:55 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller why won't @LorettaLynch & @SallyQYates appoint Special Prosecutor to investigate Trump & Russians contact during election?
798654395978104832 2016-11-15 22:30:20 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 getting the popular vote compact signed is easier & even then we need to 1st get the legislatures & governorships to reach 270
798652770769338368 2016-11-15 22:23:53 UTC <Vva10967> @edgoist your numbers are outdated.  Butrise in Other is the protest vote against HRC.The Republicans came home & voted 4 their racist king.
798652226700910592 2016-11-15 22:21:43 UTC <Vva10967> @antmay @kurteichenwald @JulieSelf right, the ones who voted third party are much worse.
798651386036531200 2016-11-15 22:18:23 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @Twizznit nop, 110,000 flipped PA, WI & MI.  That was it.  The blue wall.
798651193866252290 2016-11-15 22:17:37 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald definitely protest voters.
798433116696285184 2016-11-14 07:51:03 UTC <Vva10967> @MarkMorley5 @joanwalsh but was embraced by a majority of the voters. The ELectoral College just got in the way.
798426658227286016 2016-11-14 07:25:24 UTC <Vva10967> @NBCNews @JoyAnnReid will Trump be able to overrule them?
798424527193653248 2016-11-14 07:16:55 UTC <Vva10967> @will_knox lol I know. SHE sound like a Republican running as a Democrat. Berners like her bc she endorsed him.
798327227020673024 2016-11-14 00:50:17 UTC <Vva10967> @will_knox the GOP voters came home.  Party loyalty for them is so strong they voted for racist sexual predator who is unfit for office.
798326799453319168 2016-11-14 00:48:35 UTC <Vva10967> @will_knox Nop.  Cornell Belcher tracked Gary's increase to Clinton's decrease in Michigan & PA. WI had voter ID suppression, 300,000.
798325343388045312 2016-11-14 00:42:48 UTC <Vva10967> No folks, the Democratic Party cannot reach the whites that voted for Trump.  Just cannot.  We live in 2 different worlds.https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/798314593659613184

798320736331042816 2016-11-14 00:24:30 UTC <Vva10967> @Haunsie @Ontheotherhand Here, read this: http://bit.ly/2fSQAEH
798293785432166400 2016-11-14 22:37:24 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders too bad 110,000 of your followers in MI, PA & WI thought it was more important to say FU to HRC than to save the planet.
798292673505427456 2016-11-14 22:32:59 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @cbouzy No, math says otherwise.  The disgruntled Bernie voters wanted to say FU to her and they've fucked the country instead.
798292444039315456 2016-11-14 22:32:04 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @cbouzy seems that the RESULT of the election is now galvanizing them, now that it is too late and the damage can't be undone.
798292023589490688 2016-11-14 22:30:24 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @cbouzy she got overwhelming support from blacks and latinos, except for millenials who wanted to avenge Bernie's honor.
798291663307362312 2016-11-14 22:28:58 UTC <Vva10967> @sivadavi8 He lost by over 2 MILLION votes. He won the electoral college because 110,000 of our voters were entitled Bernie pricks.
798291350336589827 2016-11-14 22:27:44 UTC <Vva10967> @sivadavi8 I do, and also understand motives and how evil those voters were.  They put millions of people & vulnerable communities at risk.
798290804573925376 2016-11-14 22:25:33 UTC <Vva10967> @Ontheotherhand So maybe DNC screwed us all by letting Bernie run and slander Hillary during the primary.
798290617466060800 2016-11-14 22:24:49 UTC <Vva10967> @Ontheotherhand DNC and DWS actually ALLOWED Bernie to run as a Dem, which he isn't.  He'd never gotten ANY media attention as Independent.
798290407851511808 2016-11-14 22:23:59 UTC <Vva10967> @Ontheotherhand No, the 110,000 pricks who voted 3rd party instead of backing the Dem ticket are. She got 4 million more votes than Bernie.
798290101948321792 2016-11-14 22:22:46 UTC <Vva10967> @will_knox she's been a progressive her entire life, even to left of Obama. Her agenda was extremely progressive. You wanted a MAN.
798289190026768384 2016-11-14 22:19:09 UTC <Vva10967> @keithellison who votes for DNC chair?
798288907754356736 2016-11-14 22:18:01 UTC <Vva10967> @keithellison we need united Dem party that respects result of primary in 2020 & backs the candidate no matter what. Make Supers nonvoting.
798288420753707008 2016-11-14 22:16:05 UTC <Vva10967> @keithellison can DNC PLEASE make Supers non-voting so we avoid the in-fighting that occurs when the loser blames his loss on the Supers?
798287478901866496 2016-11-14 22:12:21 UTC <Vva10967> @oneunderscore__ Trump's followers will believe ANYTHING.  They swear the Pope endorsed Trump & that Snopes is "biased" in denying it.
798286680625057792 2016-11-14 22:09:10 UTC <Vva10967> @will_knox so Hillary capitulating to Bernie's demands wasn't enough?
798286343390498817 2016-11-14 22:07:50 UTC <Vva10967> @LauriLinnea @angryandliberal HE SLANDERED her and never walked it back. And he KNEW BETTER even if his followers believed his lies.
798285897628352512 2016-11-14 22:06:04 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @angryandliberal 110,000 Berners chose to vote third party in MI PA & WI to screw Hillary and now we're all screwed.
798284011235930112 2016-11-14 21:58:34 UTC <Vva10967> Maybe the media should remind folks who Bolton is? Remember that interviews show Americans barely know who the VP is.
798253440099057664 2016-11-14 19:57:05 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @cbouzy she HAD a message, one of inclusion.  Maybe it didn't appeal to you because you're too white and male?
798252939823484928 2016-11-14 19:55:06 UTC <Vva10967> MUST READ: Why Do Women Hate Each Other? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amy-siskind/why-do-women-hate-each-ot_b_12951078.html?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004 via @HuffPostPol
798080766517379072 2016-11-14 08:30:57 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @texlaker it doesn't. They also reject liberal values, marriage equality and BLM which we support
798080172025122816 2016-11-14 08:28:35 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @suebell49 you also cannot reward the Berners who lost us the election with their vindictive third party votes in FL MI PA & WI
798079569727254529 2016-11-14 08:26:11 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @truecolossus no it's about party loyalty. GOP came home. We got screwed by vindictive Berners voting third party.
798078919001964544 2016-11-14 08:23:36 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @cbouzy NO we lost because Hateful Berners voted 3rd party in FL MI PA & FL 2 screw Hillary as payback 4 defeat'g their Saviour
798077933256642560 2016-11-14 08:19:41 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @tonic516 Obama wouldn't want to. He's doing project with Eric Holder to rebuild party & get back governorships & legislatures
798077434293813249 2016-11-14 08:17:42 UTC <Vva10967> @RepTimRyan @krystalball @crl_fitzpatrick that's a good idea. Is Kasich term limited? OH went 4 Trump so he may get backlash 4 his bravery
798076684083859458 2016-11-14 08:14:43 UTC <Vva10967> @RepTimRyan @krystalball why? House Leader's job is to keep caucus together for votes. Nancy is excellent at it. You're thinking DNC Chair.
798075871106109440 2016-11-14 08:11:29 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 @CapitalismWorld the server was a bullshit story that the media blew out of proportion
798075659914477568 2016-11-14 08:10:39 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 that and the disgruntled Bernie Bots who voted third party to make her pay for their Saviour's defeat in primary
798074461543170048 2016-11-14 08:05:53 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes @Nate_Cohn they are also white and don't care about POC immigrants or Muslims.
798073810276745216 2016-11-14 08:03:18 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn and maybe Berners who voted third party lied to pollsters on purpose? They are a bitter vindictive bunch.
798072893083095040 2016-11-13 07:59:39 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn maybe Trump voters were too embarrassed to tell pollsters they were voting for the sexual predator?
798070361501958144 2016-11-13 07:49:36 UTC <Vva10967> @teddyschleifer @danmericaCNN @CNN who needs money when MSM will give you free 24/7 coverage and carry your rallies live for free?
798068811874217984 2016-11-13 07:43:26 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs in the meantime @davidaxelrod is normalizing this as well as Trump
798065271927779330 2016-11-13 07:29:22 UTC <Vva10967> @ianwilrel8 I'm not.  You may want to do some research on your Saviour. His writings and Sierra Blanca are particularly bad.
798061096166768640 2016-11-13 07:12:47 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller why wouldn't DOJ appoint a Special Prosecutor? why are @LorettaLynch and @SallyQYates acting so weak? Comey can't be trusted
798059947997040640 2016-11-13 07:08:13 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @AmLawAlumBR that voted third party in FL MI PA & WI that lost us the election. Trump voters didn't elect him, Bernie Dems did.
798059709534117890 2016-11-13 07:07:16 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @AmLawAlumBR Biden would NOT have fared better because he would have beat Bernie in the primary and it was the disgruntled Bernie Bros
798057845031698434 2016-11-13 06:59:52 UTC <Vva10967> Hey @davidaxelrod you've been spending so much time at CNN that you are now normalizing Trump.  Kasich staffer isn't. Learn from him.https://twitter.com/JWGOP/status/797918770136117248
798057067554578432 2016-11-13 06:56:46 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Obama is going to try to keep him from blowing up the world & NATO & from going after muslims and undocumented immigrants.
798054830925234177 2016-11-13 06:47:53 UTC <Vva10967> @BenjySarlin Thanks for not normalizing this as other media has.  Maybe going forward you should include in parens what Alt-Right is?
798053775164473344 2016-11-13 06:43:41 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @MikeJKeenan @AmLawAlumBR taken votes from both.  Sanders would also have ran on raising taxes on EVERYONE. Voters don't like that.
798045393132998656 2016-11-13 06:10:23 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh looks like the Bernie Bros are back.  I suggest you block MikeJKeenan
798044532340326400 2016-11-13 06:06:58 UTC <Vva10967> 3. @MikeJKeenan @joanwalsh he was in his 30s when he wrote those, so not a kid. and there's Sierra Blanca and how he profited from that?
798043928935198720 2016-11-13 06:04:34 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @MikeJKeenan @joanwalsh or that his writing about letting children explore their sexuality by touching each other's genitalia is bad?
798043635057037316 2016-11-13 06:03:24 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @MikeJKeenan @AmLawAlumBR @joanwalsh you don't think that his writings about women fantasizing about being raped by multiple men are bad?
798043248044322816 2016-11-13 06:01:51 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller actually @nytimes may be losing subscribers in response to its editor's "we'll be nice to Trump" letter. Ugh.

798035813485412353 2016-11-13 05:32:19 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @joanwalsh Not worried about the # just that they be non-voting so when Bernie runs again in 2020 he won't be able 2 blame loss on them
797947977931386880 2016-11-13 23:43:17 UTC <Vva10967> 5. @ianwilrel8 most low income whites went with Hillary. It wasn't about income, it was darker. But third party vote gave victory to Trump.
797947652482727936 2016-11-13 23:42:00 UTC <Vva10967> 4. @ianwilrel8 Trump voters also rejected Liberalism & would have rejected Bernie & would have worried about him raising taxes on everyone.
797947197266493440 2016-11-13 23:40:11 UTC <Vva10967> 3.@ianwilrel8 Bernie & Weaver would both have been hacked by Russia who wanted Trump to win & Bernie has a LOT of baggage to exploit.
797947005909639168 2016-11-13 23:39:26 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @ianwilrel8 if Bernie had run against Trump, Mike Bloomberg would have entered the race and would have pulled from both Bernie & Trump.
797946615499616256 2016-11-13 23:37:52 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @ianwilrel8 he did not.  Media played you. Hillary had a 17 MM loyal voter following in 2008 and 16 MM showed up to back her in 2016.
797945350053130240 2016-11-13 23:32:51 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald he thinks it's a Monday to Friday job too, maybe 9 to 5 too? Let's hope ISIS doesn't decide to attack us on a weekend.
797944847768260608 2016-11-13 23:30:51 UTC <Vva10967> Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania & Ohio, you won't be getting back those coal jobs that you were promised. Suckers!https://twitter.com/kurteichenwald/status/797933360513359873
797944201614741505 2016-11-13 23:28:17 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh thanks for saying it.  Two questions who votes for DNC Chairman?  Who decides if DNC will have Super Delegates?
797943674860609536 2016-11-13 23:26:11 UTC <Vva10967> @ianwilrel8 & she didn't "steal" his message, HE negotiated w/her to adopt his message so she'd implement it as POTUS. But you elected Trump
797942933622169600 2016-11-13 23:23:15 UTC <Vva10967> @crooksandliars @joanwalsh @ianwilrel8 OMG, MSNBC would show his ENTIRE rallies and not bother to cover Hillary's smaller events.
797941975949443072 2016-11-13 23:19:26 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald Florida will likely see a drop in tourism since Europeans, Canadians & Latin Americans will repudiate us.
797924816766398465 2016-11-13 22:11:15 UTC <Vva10967> @HuffPostPol the media better cover it and not give him a free pass again.
797914625220243457 2016-11-13 21:30:45 UTC <Vva10967> appreciate it, THANK YOU!

797880792449826817 2016-11-13 19:16:19 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid thank you. I can't stand the self-entitled Bernie pricks who voted for Jill & Gary because they wanted Hillary to fail.
797880020144246784 2016-11-13 19:13:15 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Republicans always come home, Dems do not, they in-fight. In 2014 they threw POTUS under the bus to cater to GOP voters & failed
797711931335385088 2016-11-13 08:05:19 UTC <Vva10967> @PensiveTM so are you saying that you are a Deplorable?
797708526038773764 2016-11-12 07:51:47 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid and you got pundits & media saying it was about economic anxiety.  Please!
797642602354999296 2016-11-12 03:29:50 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @MattMurph24 @WEMESQ yes but their anger is culture-driven, not economics & we can't cater to that without losing our values.
797641444756455424 2016-11-12 03:25:14 UTC <Vva10967> @northmiami you obviously don't have very many friends in rural America & MW. Go look at Dear Liberals trend & you'll see that Yes They Can.
797629185326022658 2016-11-12 02:36:31 UTC <Vva10967> @chucktodd right she should have blamed you all, the MSM for blowing the email story out of proportion & into a scandal
797614445480542208 2016-11-12 01:37:57 UTC <Vva10967> Media MUST cover this story more, re Trump's ties to Russia. @JoyAnnReid @maddow @kurteichenwald @jonfavs @Lawrence @jaketapper @60Minuteshttps://twitter.com/Vva10967/status/797613278105051136

797610561689309185 2016-11-12 01:22:31 UTC <Vva10967> OMG, Trump thinks that being POTUS is a Mon to Fri job & plans to spend weekends golfing in NYC or at Mar A Lago!  http://nyti.ms/2eq5BzC
797581507388968960 2016-11-12 23:27:04 UTC <Vva10967> @tinyyellowcandy it's certainly the fault of the Bernie crats that voted third party in FL, MI, PA & WI bc they didn't give a f*ck about POC
797580880462180353 2016-11-12 23:24:34 UTC <Vva10967> @tinyyellowcandy they did but weren't counting on backstabber Bernie crats in FL, MI, PA & WI. Aren't you a Republican anyway? or a Berner?
797580262318231552 2016-11-12 23:22:07 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro @philnorman exactly. Shows I used to love now make me nauseus since they remind me of our new reality.
797579695609053185 2016-11-12 23:19:52 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro he just forgot his own advice the minute McConnell said otherwise.
797578487951458304 2016-11-12 23:15:04 UTC <Vva10967> @thepacketrat # of electors per state is based on 2 senators + number of house members, which is why minimum is 3.
797578060426084352 2016-11-12 23:13:22 UTC <Vva10967> @deray @Sernett @thepacketrat it does NOT go to Congress if someone gets 270 or more.
797577389119307776 2016-11-12 23:10:42 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidOAtkins not unless she moved center right. Those voters rejected liberalism, poltical correctness, inclusiveness, etc not just Hillary
797576709805658112 2016-11-12 23:08:00 UTC <Vva10967> @JasonKander @TVMoJoe not a bad idea...
797574210889666564 2016-11-12 22:58:04 UTC <Vva10967> @VirgPatriot out of curiosity, how do you feel about muslims and the muslim ban? about the wall & the mass deportations?
797574065263349761 2016-11-12 22:57:30 UTC <Vva10967> @VirgPatriot you realize you're proving my point?  lol. We won't compromise on our core values so elections are really tribal contests now.
797573410029240320 2016-11-12 22:54:53 UTC <Vva10967> @LRoehnelt @VirgPatriot It is. CA is huge, blue and has > 4.5 million ballots to count.  WA has >700,000.
797572858058772480 2016-11-12 22:52:42 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @bill22204 @RoofBob We have nothing in common with people who believe Trump & what he stands for are okay. So yes, it's us and they.
797572320202199041 2016-11-12 22:50:33 UTC <Vva10967> 4. @Toure not to mention that if it had been Trump vs Sanders, Mike Bloomberg would have entered the race too & pulled from both.
797571986465681408 2016-11-12 22:49:14 UTC <Vva10967> 3. @Toure AND his emails would have been hacked by the Russians too and put on WikiLeaks if he had gotten any traction.
797571454112038912 2016-11-12 22:47:07 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @tinyyellowcandy then you didn't listen to her policies & message. Now you're stuck with Trump & the hate his election legitimized.
797570938808258560 2016-11-12 22:45:04 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @tinyyellowcandy her strategy of holding small events was misguided. She could have filled large venues had she dared to do it.
797567155583799296 2016-11-12 22:30:02 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @bill22204 @RoofBob it did, but the BLM movement developed after the 2012 election. Same with Marriage Equality. They reject both.
797565933413892096 2016-11-12 22:25:11 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @con2ken In other words, it's not just Hillary that they rejected, is the liberal values that she stands for that they abhor.
797565639657476096 2016-11-12 22:24:01 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @con2ken but it's true.  Look at the Dear Liberals trend on Twitter. They hate our values. And it's been true on FB as well.
797565214673829893 2016-11-12 22:22:19 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @MelodyWyles I agree but if we lost the midwest & rural America over OUR core values, I don't see how Hillary is to blame for it.
797560332667461632 2016-11-12 22:02:55 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @bill22204 they don't think they're giving up anything because they believe his slogans. Reality will eventually hit them.
797560124319666176 2016-11-12 22:02:06 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @AmirRagui a lot has changed since 2012. Marriage Equality & BLM are the biggest changes & they're rejecting the changes.
797559581601857536 2016-11-12 21:59:56 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @spyBUDDHA agreed.
797559463712620545 2016-11-12 21:59:28 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @roselaura100 but they don't view it that way. They think they are saying FU to liberals. Maybe they're too priviledged to care.
797558954448584704 2016-11-12 21:57:27 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure and those are irreconcilable differences.
797558657823150080 2016-11-12 21:56:16 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure Look at the Dear Liberals trend on Twitter. Trump voters mock our liberal values & political correctness. That's what angers them.
797557938902749184 2016-11-12 21:53:25 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @Toure right wing would have had a field day with Sierra Blanca & with his "women fantasize about being raped" writings from his 30s.
797556678912802818 2016-11-12 21:48:24 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @Toure Bernie would have done worse.  In addition to being Liberal he's a proud socialist, his emails would have been hacked too, & the
797556077189627904 2016-11-12 21:46:01 UTC <Vva10967> @LRoehnelt Illinois went for Hillary. No mandate at all. He will lose the popular vote by 2 to 3 million votes.
797555443136659457 2016-11-12 21:43:30 UTC <Vva10967> @AlecMacGillis agreed but 4 the record, Hillary's been a LIBERAL her ENTIRE LIFE.  Anything to contrary is a lie, a distortion of who she is
797554926545145857 2016-11-12 21:41:26 UTC <Vva10967> @AlecMacGillis @tspat04 we pandered to the GOP instead of going for the kill like they do. We're so divided that only tribal approach works.
797554463875760128 2016-11-12 21:39:36 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs @AlecMacGillis @fastjohnny Maybe what Midwest & Rural America rejected WAS Liberalism & not Hillary. Intraparty fighting sunk us.
797553598444007424 2016-11-12 21:36:10 UTC <Vva10967> 10. @jonfavs @davidplouffe I live in a blue state & think the country is doing great since Obama took office.I think we'll tank under Trump.
797553090274689025 2016-11-12 21:34:09 UTC <Vva10967> 9. @jonfavs @davidplouffe they're saying HELL NO but that's no reason to change OUR party's values of inclusion & of moving forward together
797552072216477697 2016-11-12 21:30:06 UTC <Vva10967> 8. @jonfavs @davidplouffe a lot has changed since 2012 & these folks take view that we're shoving our liberal values down their throats and
797551458623324161 2016-11-12 21:27:40 UTC <Vva10967> 7. @jonfavs @davidplouffe & the reason this part of America rejected HRC is that she & her campaign embodied these values that they reject
797550839883845632 2016-11-12 21:25:12 UTC <Vva10967> 6.@jonfavs @davidplouffe diversity, refugees, PC, yet all those are values that Liberal Dems cherish. Look at Dear Liberals trend on twitter
797550210889158657 2016-11-12 21:22:42 UTC <Vva10967> 5. @jonfavs @davidplouffe on social matters they reject post-2012 changes e.g. marriage equality, BLM, muslims, Kopernick flag protest,
797549086731800580 2016-11-12 21:18:14 UTC <Vva10967> 4 .@jonfavs @davidplouffe and on economic side that may be because those folks live in Republican-controlled states & can't connect the 2.
797548786377785344 2016-11-12 21:17:03 UTC <Vva10967> 3. @jonfavs @davidplouffe for months polls have been saying that a ton of people believe country is heading in wrong direction.
797548408261279749 2016-11-12 21:15:32 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @jonfavs @davidplouffe Hillary ran on promise of continuing Obama legacy & rural & midwest America rejected premise.
797547952319459328 2016-11-12 21:13:44 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @jonfavs @davidplouffe have U given any thougtht to the fact that rural & midwest America may just have rejected Liberalism?
797543449461395456 2016-11-12 20:55:50 UTC <Vva10967> @poniewozik @KevinMKruse lol, maybe King is a center-right guy & no matter what result is, he will say that the POTUS should govern that way
797542682356748288 2016-11-12 20:52:47 UTC <Vva10967> @poniewozik if that were true, Trump would have won the popular vote. Yet Hillary will win it by over 2 million votes.
797542285848309760 2016-11-12 20:51:13 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure has it occurred to you all that rural America & the midwest were rejecting Liberalism, marriage equality, BLM, inclusiveness & PC?
797536351344295940 2016-11-12 20:27:38 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert have they counted ALL the votes in those 3 states? any provisionals left? Also wasn't WI under court order to provide IDs?
797517681800921088 2016-11-12 19:13:27 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias however having done the job successfully in the past is also important. Maybe they should have co-chairs.
797517361960091648 2016-11-12 19:12:10 UTC <Vva10967> @daveweigel are you being sarcastic? or have you never seen a server?  do you really expected her to have used gmail, aol or yahoo? @jonfavs
797516551972913152 2016-11-12 19:08:57 UTC <Vva10967> @JuddLegum So HIllary's message of inclusion was too constructed & thus bad but Trump's message of hate was "authentic" & thus good?@jonfavs
797516210338430976 2016-11-12 19:07:36 UTC <Vva10967> @JuddLegum and it's extremely troubling to see you equate the garbage & hate that came out of Trump's mouth with "being authentic" @jonfavs
797515563832606720 2016-11-12 19:05:02 UTC <Vva10967> @JuddLegum @jonfavs The notion that Hillary isn't "authentic" was fabricated by the media & repeated so much that people believed it.
797513002153025536 2016-11-12 18:54:51 UTC <Vva10967> @pattonoswalt @somewhatalady @nycdp if we'd the legislatures & governorships in enough states we could have reached 270 btw now and 12/19=-(
797512235023220736 2016-11-12 18:51:48 UTC <Vva10967> @jryangolden CA alone has 4.5 million ballots to count and WA has >700,000.  NY has some too. CO is all mail in ballots.
797511230395154432 2016-11-12 18:47:49 UTC <Vva10967> @jag7337 media wanted a horse race for ratings so they normalized Trump and abnormalized Hillary. And they went too far.
797510347498328064 2016-11-12 18:44:18 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias @nolesfan2011 Not true.  The Republicans came home & voted for Trump.  The Bernie Dems did not. For them Hate Trumped Love.
797487119484809216 2016-11-12 17:12:00 UTC <Vva10967> Well at least in 2020 you won't have the sorry excuse of not knowing the voter registration deadlines.
797486715636170755 2016-11-12 17:10:24 UTC <Vva10967> you should google Hillary & Amadou Diallo
797485978852147200 2016-11-12 17:07:28 UTC <Vva10967> Don't count on it. https://twitter.com/seamusrex/status/797482845463777280
797485655299395584 2016-11-12 17:06:11 UTC <Vva10967> Saw it on MSNBC.  I've never had the desire to read The Art of the Deal which is where that appears. Apparently U did read it?
797484922877448193 2016-11-12 17:03:16 UTC <Vva10967> you do know that Bernie voted for that crime bill, no?  She was first lady and didn't get a vote.
797484372349820928 2016-11-12 17:01:05 UTC <Vva10967> she had a plan to fix it but now Trump will make it even worse.  Stocks of private prisons almost doubled on news of his election
797484064739655680 2016-11-12 16:59:52 UTC <Vva10967> the media didn't cover those stories until 2016, most of us don't read Trump bios.
797483729845452800 2016-11-12 16:58:32 UTC <Vva10967> @davidbrockdc @rzn2blv Wish I got paid, but no, I just stand for the TRUTH.  Hope President Trump thanks you Berners.
797483281319129088 2016-11-12 16:56:45 UTC <Vva10967> @rzn2blv no, people like U who hated her at all costs did.U didn't care that you'd be validating his racism & putting POC at risk
797482834969710592 2016-11-12 16:54:59 UTC <Vva10967> @rzn2blv Bernie will be too old in 2020. And HRC will defeat him again then. Or Elizabeth Warren will. #AlwaysWithHer
797482485613555712 2016-11-12 16:53:35 UTC <Vva10967> @rzn2blv LOL, let's hope U mature 1 day. Or maybe you'll become a Republican.  Their hate of HRC seems to be all that binds them
797482200673484801 2016-11-12 16:52:27 UTC <Vva10967> @rzn2blv actually Trump attacked the Mexicans first, on day 1 of his campaign so U have that backwards. He attacked BLM in 2016.
797481615182204929 2016-11-12 16:50:08 UTC <Vva10967> @rzn2blv she WON the popular vote.  Bernie Busters elected Trump. He didn't have enough voters to elect him.  Congrats!
797481295441985536 2016-11-12 16:48:51 UTC <Vva10967> 11 @seamusrex @rzn2blv reason NY FBI hates her is she stood with families of unarmed black men killed by NYPD in 1999 & 2000, before iphones
797481051396468736 2016-11-12 16:47:53 UTC <Vva10967> 10 @seamusrex @rzn2blv been a public servant fighting for women, children, families, the disabled, equal rights, healthcare, for over 30 yrs
797480609576873984 2016-11-12 16:46:08 UTC <Vva10967> 9 @seamusrex @rzn2blv she's been most admired woman for 20 yrs, she gets standing ovations at her speeches & will continue to do so. She's
797480395751165952 2016-11-12 16:45:17 UTC <Vva10967> 8 @seamusrex @rzn2blv & she gave 100s of paid speeches even to environmental groups & charged >$200K bc that's what celebs like her get paid
797480027562659840 2016-11-12 16:43:49 UTC <Vva10967> 7. @seamusrex @rzn2blv Bernie didn't give paid speeches BECAUSE IT'S AGAINST THE LAW for public officials to do so,not bc he was so virtuous
797479686523801600 2016-11-12 16:42:28 UTC <Vva10967> 6.@seamusrex @rzn2blv how donations get reported, by the field in which the INDIVIDUAL works.  Corporations can't give money to candidates.
797479502553214976 2016-11-12 16:41:44 UTC <Vva10967> 5. @seamusrex @rzn2blv her donations from "wall street" & "oil & gas industries" are donations from people who work in those fields. That's
797479307560030208 2016-11-12 16:40:58 UTC <Vva10967> 4. @seamusrex @rzn2blv had Bernie not been so arrogant, he would have told you that he LIED when he accused her of being a corporate sellout
797479232226131968 2016-11-12 16:40:40 UTC <Vva10967> 3. @seamusrex @rzn2blv your problem.  NYS has had the same rules for YEARS, didn't change them to suppress anything.
797478929707712512 2016-11-12 16:39:27 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @seamusrex @rzn2blv there was no voter suppression.  The primary rules are established by each state & if you can't follow them that's
797478336675061760 2016-11-12 16:37:06 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @seamusrex @rzn2blv All Wikileaks shows is DNC officials were (rightfully) angry at Bernie after he & Weaver attacked them on Sun shows.
797477317253730304 2016-11-12 16:33:03 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @jag7337 @BernieSanders he made her out to be in the primary; also that he lost because SHE got more 4 MILLION more votes than he did.
797477058569977857 2016-11-12 16:32:01 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @jag7337 @BernieSanders was too proud to tell his supporters that Hillary was a good & honest public servant & not the "corporate whore"
797476430246453248 2016-11-12 16:29:32 UTC <Vva10967> @SickInBed Scott, hope you aren't as brown in real life as in your photo or you'll end up profiled by Trump's stop & frisk program.
797334112159809536 2016-11-11 07:04:00 UTC <Vva10967> Wall Street was a problem in 2008 but isn't a problem in 2016. Trump & the bigotry he's unleashed &  damage he will do are.
797333656998178817 2016-11-11 07:02:12 UTC <Vva10967> and the one who was criticized about WV was HRC when she said that Clean Energy was going to put coal miners out of buz.
797333358850220032 2016-11-11 07:01:01 UTC <Vva10967> You guys are as bad as the Trump followers in viewing Bernie as a God. He isn't.  He's a politician obsessed w Wall Street.
797329324554776576 2016-11-11 06:44:59 UTC <Vva10967> Sadhttps://twitter.com/zellieimani/status/796807377945329664
797328815043280896 2016-11-11 06:42:57 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid true but it wasn't a majority that elected him. It was the Bernie Bros voting third party.Majority voted for HRC's inclusiveness
797328202674880513 2016-11-11 06:40:31 UTC <Vva10967> @pattonoswalt @somewhatalady difference will grow to between 2 and 3 million when CA is tallied. They're really slow. Lots of mail in
797327820863184896 2016-11-11 06:39:00 UTC <Vva10967> @pattonoswalt @nycdp @somewhatalady problem now is that GOP controls most state legislatures & must realize EC is only way they can win WH
797327137711751168 2016-11-11 06:36:17 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 I hope Trump is able to get his term limits for Congressmen promise through.  So many in Capitol Hill need to go.
797326622923878400 2016-11-11 06:34:15 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 I swear, someone in the media should get a copy of My New Order and read it to see if he is using it as a script.
797325445159092224 2016-11-11 06:29:34 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 they should have co-chairs. I favor Howard Dean bc he's done it before SUCCESSFULLY & can do it FT.  CoChair can add ideas.
797323748844195840 2016-11-11 06:22:49 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah I'm tired of his obsession to break up Wall Street. He's stuck in 2008 & we have bigger problems w/ bigotry under Trump today
797321324016390144 2016-11-11 06:13:11 UTC <Vva10967> @rzn2blv because that's a myth. HRC won primary bc she got 4 million more votes than he did. And she won the popular vote in general 2.
797319950805454848 2016-11-11 06:07:44 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN no one is discussing the 300,000 people who couldn't vote in WI because of voter ID law. First election after VRA gutting.
797319210036842496 2016-11-11 06:04:47 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN I agree w/ @johnpodesta, media was extremely hostile to HRC blowing email story way out of proportion while obsessing w Trump
797317190500413440 2016-11-11 05:56:46 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN she'll end up with a 2 to 3 million lead over Trump when CA is tallied. Lots of mail in ballots.
797316595345395712 2016-11-11 05:54:24 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN Trump LOVED both Clintons up until 2015 & praises them lavishly in 2003-13 interviews. Attended Trump's wedding to Melania 2.
797315543611166720 2016-11-11 05:50:13 UTC <Vva10967> no, the criticism was that Bernie automatically assumed that ALL blacks live in ghettos.  Trump believes that too. #stereotypes
797222729183281152 2016-11-11 23:41:24 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 @chrislhayes @mattyglesias @JHWeissmann No, it speaks to the double standard that the media took w her while Trump got a pass
797222551936233472 2016-11-11 23:40:42 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 Media is too busy normalizingTrump.
797222100738179072 2016-11-11 23:38:55 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn he has no plans, it's all slogans.

797214278541516804 2016-11-11 23:07:50 UTC <Vva10967> @Lawrence @MSNBC @TheLastWord technically yes but they have to be willing to do it.
797209494434545668 2016-11-11 22:48:49 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem @LaPajamas they are the reason Hillary was defeated on Tuesday, their third party votes in FL MI PA & WI to get even at HRCpic.twitter.com/1tFYFehrES
797208209757007872 2016-11-11 22:43:43 UTC <Vva10967> @Donna_West @Ricky11Slade Truth hurts?  Deep inside you, YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE.
797207605030567941 2016-11-11 22:41:19 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias do you mean vis a vis Trump or vis a vis the Democratic Party? For the 2nd: http://politi.co/2e8NrR4
797206910734843904 2016-11-11 22:38:33 UTC <Vva10967> @ElectProject are there any provisional ballots left in Florida? and is PA still counting its ballots?
797186828277268484 2016-11-11 21:18:45 UTC <Vva10967> @Donna_West @Ricky11Slade Berners elected President Trump with their 3rd party, Hate Hillary votes, not his own voters.
797183855136571392 2016-11-11 21:06:56 UTC <Vva10967> So no, it wasn't turn out. It was third party protest votes.https://twitter.com/ElectProject/status/796797779314085888
797098769632399361 2016-11-11 15:28:50 UTC <Vva10967> And you also underestimate the right wing smearing machine that has been after Hillary for past 30 years; it would have crushed Bernie toohttps://twitter.com/Smooth_Orator/status/796771118191431685
797095246219898880 2016-11-11 15:14:50 UTC <Vva10967> Hillary's popular vote lead will be between 2 and 3 million votes when all of CA is counted.https://twitter.com/gelliottmorris/status/796898990017183744
797094209417256960 2016-11-11 15:10:43 UTC <Vva10967> @dissentingj and no, they wouldn't back HER, they were Bernie supporters who should have backed the DEM Ticket which backed Bernie's IDEAS.
797093826636693505 2016-11-11 15:09:12 UTC <Vva10967> @dissentingj MI & WI were in the "safe" democratic states list promoted by this trading votes group.
797093540014813184 2016-11-11 15:08:03 UTC <Vva10967> @dissentingj There also was a list where people were trading pledges to vote Dem in swing states for voting 3rd party in safe Dem states 2/
797092664076365824 2016-11-11 15:04:35 UTC <Vva10967> @dissentingj it's not a secret that Bernie supporters were going to cast protest votes & Gary has run before & never gotten > 1% of the vote
796980821571801088 2016-11-10 07:40:09 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn the Third party vote was unusually high too in FL so we lost bc of protest vote. Had they voted for Dem ticket we would have won
796979058856890368 2016-11-10 07:33:09 UTC <Vva10967> @Monster4Gaga24 but by supporting him they are saying that they don't care that he is racist and intolerant because it doesn't affect them.
796897247107674112 2016-11-10 02:08:04 UTC <Vva10967> @dilemmv he'll lose the primary again.
796896182618431488 2016-11-10 02:03:50 UTC <Vva10967> @Smooth_Orator @TheMindOfManiac and no, it's not from both parties.  Her negatives are the GOP and the BernieBust people. Dems LOVE her.
796895892154580992 2016-11-10 02:02:40 UTC <Vva10967> @Smooth_Orator @TheMindOfManiac That's because the right wing has been attacking her for 30 years. They would have trashed Bernie by now.
796884920966795265 2016-11-10 01:19:05 UTC <Vva10967> Hey @HardballChris is this the economic anxiety that U keep saying is responsible for Trump's success among whites?http://bit.ly/2fBd64m

796839849538031616 2016-11-10 22:19:59 UTC <Vva10967> @CharlesMBlow @JoyAnnReid More important is that he campaigned on bigotry & bullying & his followers see his winning as validation of that.

796573867636641792 2016-11-09 04:43:04 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid 1 @BernieSanders voters can't accept that Hillary got 4 MM more votes than Bernie because despite media narrative, Dems love her

796479771811008512 2016-11-09 22:29:10 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @PostSurgeOp yes, that's probably what drove the 3rd party voters to hate her. But not just the media, the BernieBros also did.
796478950742626304 2016-11-09 22:25:54 UTC <Vva10967> @chefbscott yes but without the 3rd party voters in FL MI PA & WI, the racists and sexists would not have triumphed. Now they're emboldened.
796477390058848256 2016-11-09 22:19:42 UTC <Vva10967> @maggiesmithpoet no, it wasn't half. Hillary's popular vote is more than half. Trump would have lost but for 3rd party vote in FL MI PA & WI

794411004918722560 2016-11-03 05:28:37 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid For all the criticism Hillary gets from black millenials and BLM, she's been consistently outspoken on police brutality cases
794404558277591041 2016-11-03 05:03:00 UTC <Vva10967> @Parentella unarmed black men killed by NYPD before the iphone era.  Hillary took sides with the victims. Giuliani justified the killings.
794402364312682496 2016-11-03 04:54:17 UTC <Vva10967> Interesting.https://twitter.com/yashar/status/794359971597209600
794400469728825344 2016-11-03 04:46:45 UTC <Vva10967> @UniNoticias porque la prensa esta OBSESIONADA con ellos. No hay caso legal. Mejor deberian reportar sobre corrupcion de oficina del FBI-NY
794398525434056704 2016-11-03 04:39:02 UTC <Vva10967> Trump's campaign is playing dirty as usual.  Pretending that message is from Hillary.  It's NOT.https://twitter.com/MaddowBlog/status/794354337736638464
794336221954797568 2016-11-03 00:31:28 UTC <Vva10967> @allinwithchris @JoyAnnReid you were great! Giuliani needs to be investigated & locked up!
794305459792609280 2016-11-03 22:29:13 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 I think we ALL need to stay involved & make Republicans pay 4 embracing Trump & what he stands for.They can't just erase it.
794302587101216769 2016-11-03 22:17:48 UTC <Vva10967> @RobbyMook No because Comey's partisan & only obeys Republicans. Doesn't even obey his bosses @LorettaLynch & @SallyQYates.
794301280076361728 2016-11-03 22:12:37 UTC <Vva10967> @jasoninthehouse Saying you're voting for but not endorsing Trump is a FARCE. Women will remember whose side you were on when it mattered.https://twitter.com/TPM/status/794299100594323465

794299433773125638 2016-11-03 22:05:17 UTC <Vva10967> We cannot afford a Senate and House controlled by the Party of Trump.  Vote them out!  Vote DEMOCRATIC up & down the ticket.https://twitter.com/HawaiiDelilah/status/794294767093850112
794296495642202117 2016-11-03 21:53:36 UTC <Vva10967> @Reuters Bullshit.  FBI is partisan and has NO CREDIBILITY left. Comey's July press conference was first attack against Hillary & continued
794021013440839680 2016-11-02 03:38:56 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas @jdbalart bet he would do it too.https://twitter.com/danmericaCNN/status/794020113246785541
793931727110553600 2016-11-02 21:44:08 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost for the Deplorables? because it's NOT about the economy WAPO.  It's about racial resentment & wanting to go back to the 50s

793872311858425862 2016-11-02 17:48:03 UTC <Vva10967> @hollybdc so how does he know that unless his campaign is communicating with Assange?

793866221821231104 2016-11-02 17:23:51 UTC <Vva10967> @Newsweek Sorry @FBI but you've lost ALL CREDIBILITY.  Now when someone says CORRUPT, first thing that comes to mind is FBI & Comey.
793853738951778309 2016-11-02 16:34:15 UTC <Vva10967> @FernandoPeinado los seguidores de Trump tienden a ser Deplorables. Puedes estar seguro que su odio se extiende a los immigrantes y Latinos.
793708450563887104 2016-11-01 06:56:55 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes you guys have been obsessed with her emails from the getgo. Maybe you should get a techie & a classifications expert?
793705456371924993 2016-11-01 06:45:01 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN she was actually in DC on 9/11 (the date) which as U may recall is the other city that got attacked.  She meant 9/11 the event
793704020955238400 2016-11-01 06:39:19 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN you think she means the date but us New Yorkers refer to 9/11 as the event itself
793638816708001792 2016-11-01 02:20:13 UTC <Vva10967> @BraddJaffy lol, Trump campaign has bad grammar, it should say "its views" not "their views" and yes, its views represent Trump voters.
793636051654995970 2016-11-01 02:09:14 UTC <Vva10967> @ScottWalker or you live in a state that is prosperous because it's governed by @TheDemocrats

793511211967057921 2016-11-01 17:53:10 UTC <Vva10967> @JuddLegum Plus whatever happened to  Comey's new rule about having a press conference to share his personal opinions even if no indictment
793336395364458496 2016-10-31 06:18:30 UTC <Vva10967> @paulwaldman1 @LOLGOP @washingtonpost which is why we need to vote out every single GOP elected official. They need to be punished for Trump

793334602257530880 2016-10-31 06:11:23 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica de nosotros depende darle a Hillary un Congreso que la apoye y no uno que la obstruya. De eso depende la Reforma Migratoria.
793333907940843520 2016-10-31 06:08:37 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica por eso es importante votar por TODOS los democratas el la boleta y despedir a los del partido republicano
793330346309943296 2016-10-31 05:54:28 UTC <Vva10967> @yottapoint here is the link to POS Grassley's letter:  http://bit.ly/2eUFoG4  He's even more disgraceful than Comey.
793330063597010944 2016-10-31 05:53:21 UTC <Vva10967> @yottapoint You're giving him too much credit.  Read his letter, the POS senator keeps proving himself a POS.
793315125646204928 2016-10-31 04:53:59 UTC <Vva10967> @clintonemail @JoyAnnReid the private server was @ClintonEmail.com  The other one is the url that her campaign uses =-)
792978116176146432 2016-10-30 06:34:50 UTC <Vva10967> @AriMelber he blew it back in July when he decided to break DOJ rules just to crucify Hillary. He should resign.
792971099772481536 2016-10-30 06:06:57 UTC <Vva10967> @frankrichny he fucked up in July trying to crucify Hillary and it snowballed from there. Seems to believe he's above the law & DOJ rules.
792915050147250176 2016-10-30 02:24:14 UTC <Vva10967> @ddale8 I liked the article.  Just need to correct the spelling of Defense (you have it with a C) =-)
792892057639583744 2016-10-30 00:52:52 UTC <Vva10967> @ddale8 I think it's lower than 50 yo, probably 40 or 45. it's pretty much the women who watched her as FLOTUS.
792891044002226176 2016-10-30 00:48:50 UTC <Vva10967> @ABC @MariaESalinas This shouldn't be "news", it's a STANDARD LEGAL procedure required before the FBI can pry into Huma's emails.
792890549367898112 2016-10-30 00:46:52 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica el leer los correos electronicos de la asistente de Hillary es ahora Noticia de Ultima Hora??? En serio?
792890213907431424 2016-10-30 00:45:32 UTC <Vva10967> @UniNoticias ultima hora? en serio?  por que no mejor reportan sobre ComeyGate y los problemas internos q esta teniendo el FBI?
792865607800741889 2016-10-30 23:07:46 UTC <Vva10967> @joshtpm sounds to me like the ENTIRE @FBI needs to be investigated for possible Hatch Act violations @SenatorReid @WSJ @maddow @JoyAnnReid
792864241980215297 2016-10-30 23:02:20 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews no exactamente.  La orden judicial es para leer los correos electronicos en el laptop de la ASISTENTE de Hillary, Huma Abedin
792610416060923904 2016-10-29 06:13:43 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller maybe Comey has difficulty accepting orders from women? I don't recall him going rogue on Holder.
792261249010659328 2016-10-29 07:06:15 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN I'm pretty sure she has seen the polls for that race.  Not looking very promising.

792068804180320256 2016-10-28 18:21:33 UTC <Vva10967> @JohnJHarwood He is NOT.  He is a partisan hack trying to influence the outcome of the election: http://wapo.st/2eZX3eL
792068526668480516 2016-10-28 18:20:27 UTC <Vva10967> @JohnJHarwood so that's why he violated all department rules with Hillary???  BULLSHIT.  He should RESIGN.  He's a Partisan hack.

792059816286031872 2016-10-28 17:45:50 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert Comey needs to resign when Hillary wins the White House. He's clearly partisan.
791676002627878912 2016-10-27 16:20:42 UTC <Vva10967> Trump's campaign is using targeted social media ads to depress young AA turnout for Hillary.  Here's full article: http://bloom.bg/2eHFiBLhttps://twitter.com/JoshuaGreen/status/791587739246309376

791506949955256320 2016-10-26 05:08:57 UTC <Vva10967> @ScottPelley @60Minutes & yet she's VERY uninformed because the candidate with platform 2 protect & advance opportunities 4 disabled is HRC
791457117395947520 2016-10-26 01:50:56 UTC <Vva10967> @guycecil @prioritiesUSA should attack them for it.  Their agenda is one of more witch hunts and obstruction.

791075876381331457 2016-10-25 00:36:01 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @AmandaRenteria m Rubio should be targeted for retirement.  He is a traitor to Latinos. Help @PatrickMurphyFL defeat him.
790974127876280322 2016-10-25 17:51:42 UTC <Vva10967> @NPR Little Marco was as bad on deportation even of the Dreamers as Donald Trump is. Only cares about himself rising up in GOP #PartyOfTrump
790971143670886400 2016-10-25 17:39:50 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN True, but the outrage at Trump's attacks on Mexicans & Latinos has been felt since he started his campaign.  He built that.
790959690440138752 2016-10-25 16:54:20 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas a ver cuando reconoce que no debio haberse realizado, period. Trump nunca va a ser Presidente.
790740292601348097 2016-10-24 02:22:31 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid yep, they turned off the Dem base when they threw Obama under the bus, and the GOP base was always going to vote GOP.
790664110673387520 2016-10-24 21:19:48 UTC <Vva10967> @CapehartJ and if you are voting 3rd party, you ARE voting for Trump no matter what you tell yourself and you KNOW IT.
790417157746286592 2016-10-23 04:58:30 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost is this how you feel too?  Hacking is now an invaluable reporting tool according to your reporter?https://twitter.com/Vva10967/status/790416712755712000

790060080087597056 2016-10-22 05:19:36 UTC <Vva10967> @joshtpm @Teelin FB will outlive Twitter, both are US for-profit businesses with shareholders & no one wants to invest in or acquire Twitter

790043283489714176 2016-10-22 04:12:51 UTC <Vva10967> @joshtpm @mattbc there R no consequences when U insult & threaten behind an acronym. Not so when you do it under your real name.
790042774708097027 2016-10-22 04:10:50 UTC <Vva10967> @joshtpm @mattbc a name that isn't your REAL name.  FB requires you to use your real name & will delete your account if you do not.

789225679762104320 2016-10-20 22:03:59 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes unless you, the MSM, stop repeating the nonsense that nobody likes her. I, like millions of @HillaryClinton voters, LOVE HER.
788969116707192832 2016-10-19 05:04:30 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper Not true. She is brilliant.
788967786596995072 2016-10-19 04:59:13 UTC <Vva10967> @SecretService look at April LaJune's tweet below. https://twitter.com/alankestrel750/status/788966870351278080
788782795762065408 2016-10-19 16:44:08 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid I don't get why he's bringing Obama's half brother.  To remind people of his birtherism?  It's not like he's debating Obama.
788780656327331840 2016-10-19 16:35:37 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid and yet his poll numbers have been tanking since the Billy Bush tapes were released....maybe the polling is off?
788603291492028417 2016-10-18 04:50:50 UTC <Vva10967> How cool!https://twitter.com/MickyWhiteNV/status/788590590032285696
788593468977344512 2016-10-18 04:11:49 UTC <Vva10967> @MaddowBlog @maddow Look Rachel, Trump got a 4th endorsement, lol:http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/10/18/kkks-official-newspaper-just-endorsed-trump/
788465575097987072 2016-10-18 19:43:36 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper how's this news? 2 agencies, FBI saying retro-classified for FOIA, can't release, State saying release it, not classified.
788163111446511616 2016-10-17 23:41:43 UTC <Vva10967> @SecretService the guy in this video, Dan Bowman, needs a visit. Just threatened to kill our next President when she wins.https://twitter.com/JamilSmith/status/788042507414364162
788162477922119680 2016-10-17 23:39:12 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes maybe @realDonaldTrump can get Paul Ryan fired!
788130180107735040 2016-10-17 21:30:52 UTC <Vva10967> @AC360 sounds like she's still at the first stage of grief: Denial, lol.  Anger comes next.
788058475704250368 2016-10-17 16:45:56 UTC <Vva10967> @nancycordes 3/  problem is that the government's FOIA officials err on the side of overclassifying so as to NOT release most docs 2 public
788058058165460996 2016-10-17 16:44:17 UTC <Vva10967> @nancycordes 2/ had @HillaryClinton used a http://state.gov account, those emails would STILL have been RETROACTIVELY classified.
788057720574312448 2016-10-17 16:42:56 UTC <Vva10967> @nancycordes 1/ Your reporting re @HillaryClinton's emails is NONSENSE. Retroactive classification only affect what gets released under FOIA
788057037800370176 2016-10-17 16:40:13 UTC <Vva10967> @nancycordes STOP CREATING FAKE SCANDALS ABOUT @HillaryClinton.  She can ride with whomever the hell she wants.  Period.  So can POTUS.
788056834531885056 2016-10-17 16:39:25 UTC <Vva10967> @nancycordes that's NOT a scandal. I'm sure POTUS has his own preferences too as to who he rides with in the Beast when he travels.
787803722244034560 2016-10-16 23:53:38 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn @eddie2003PRT the latino vote is probably there but the tv market if probably too expensive.
787685933634187264 2016-10-16 16:05:35 UTC <Vva10967> @aterkel lol, bet Trump will say he hasn't talked to Pence and that he disagrees, as he did in the debate.
787684074995539968 2016-10-16 15:58:12 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert 2/ and that we need to give President Hillary Clinton a BLUE House and Senate to get things done & Stop the Witch Hunts
787683792442056705 2016-10-16 15:57:05 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert I think the message has to be that Trump needs to be defeated in a landslide to send clear message of rejecting Trumpism
787544123343601665 2016-10-15 06:42:05 UTC <Vva10967> @business thank god. At least they will have drinking water left.
787542884346109952 2016-10-15 06:37:10 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @amjoyshow loved it!  Not having to listen to their nonsense is refreshing and leaves more time for you and your smart guests!
787482762756362240 2016-10-15 02:38:16 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 to be fair, we have to thank Jeff Weaver for this.  He started it. Trump took it and ran with it.
787466541344448512 2016-10-15 01:33:48 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod if he doesn't show up & she does, @HillaryClinton can spend the full 90 minutes explaining her policies.
787466242919632896 2016-10-15 01:32:37 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod Trump projects, which tells you that HE would fail a drug test. That persistent & unexplained sniffling of his suggests coke.
787457093011996672 2016-10-15 00:56:15 UTC <Vva10967> @AnnieLinskey @lindadunderwood You obviously watch too much Faux News and live in an alternate reality. CNN is FULL of paid Trump surrogates
787343751463182337 2016-10-15 17:25:53 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller sounds like we need to keep Gitmo open for these domestic terrorists.
787342898517929984 2016-10-15 17:22:29 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica para que? Si Mitch McConnell y Paul Ryan le dieron vacaciones al Congreso hasta mediados de Noviembre.
787100794613014528 2016-10-14 01:20:27 UTC <Vva10967> @AnnieLinskey because the media will blow it out of proportion as they've done with Hillary's speeches?
787041474026278912 2016-10-14 21:24:44 UTC <Vva10967> @AGSchneiderman looks like the Trump Foundation has been engaging in shenanigans for years!https://twitter.com/Fahrenthold/status/787003180483764228

786460378955931649 2016-10-12 06:55:40 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN thought this was the best version yet of @HillaryClinton stump speech.  Covered most key policies & was high energy too
786457947685748737 2016-10-12 06:46:01 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs but he still needs to be defeated in a landslide so he can't claim that he lost because the election was "rigged"
785866350803779586 2016-10-11 15:35:13 UTC <Vva10967> @Tom_Winter it's one of the FOIA litigations by Judicial Watch demanding copies of Hillary's emails. Look at date. Not Comey one.
785856677694373888 2016-10-11 14:56:47 UTC <Vva10967> In a SWORN affidavit on Dec 23, 1998, Juanita Broaddrick denied allegations that Bill Clinton had raped her http://bit.ly/2dXiufV

785523100402188290 2016-10-10 16:51:16 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Hillary's unfavorables are now matching the number for Trump's Deplorables.
785505773187112961 2016-10-10 15:42:24 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto that's pretty stupid.
785340634609647616 2016-10-09 04:46:12 UTC <Vva10967> @AC360 So did Trump (attack the women that Bill Clinton was abusive to).  He LOVED Bill Clinton up until recently.

782735040497278976 2016-10-02 00:12:30 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid did you see this? Lebron James endorsed Hillary! http://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-why-endorsing-hillary-clinton-for-president-2016-9
782632234109001728 2016-10-02 17:23:59 UTC <Vva10967> @SopanDeb explanation makes no sense.  Trump owned the Miss Universe pageant, so the "they" is really "Trump". Trump wanted to fire her.
782630259120345088 2016-10-02 17:16:08 UTC <Vva10967> @NickKristof why is it so hard for journalists & media to admit that?  seems entire media struggles to say what is sooooo obvious.
782447920213819393 2016-10-01 05:11:36 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid he's been overweight for a while!  Almost as bad as Chris Christie.
782444685172367360 2016-10-01 04:58:44 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaTeresa1 I think it's just the way he views Latinas, assumes all R housekeepers, similar to how he views blacks, as all living in crime
782106679353761792 2016-09-30 06:35:37 UTC <Vva10967> @thefix LOL why is the media so freaked out by the notion that racism IS the main driver behind the Trump campaign?
782094101646901248 2016-09-30 05:45:39 UTC <Vva10967> @thefix maybe U & @HardballChris should go 2 a Trump Rally.  U both cannot bring yourselves 2 admit that motivation IS RACISM & XENOPHOBIA

778833957248913408 2016-09-21 05:51:00 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica porque es mujer.  Si hubiese sido hombre no hubiese dicho nada.
778743699710685185 2016-09-21 23:52:21 UTC <Vva10967> @jahnaberry and he wants to eliminate the Dept of Homeland Security because he doesn't know what they do.
778723541067767815 2016-09-21 22:32:14 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou and the Media should let viewers & readers know that THEY are even MORE disliked than Trump, which is saying a lot, lol!
778461417557020672 2016-09-20 05:10:39 UTC <Vva10967> @FiveThirtyEight @farai Hope he enjoys being racially profiled, stopped & frisked because that's what he'll get under Trump & Rudy Giuliani
778460885379534849 2016-09-20 05:08:32 UTC <Vva10967> @FiveThirtyEight @farai Seriously? Has he bothered to listen to Jill's VP? Sure he's black but he might as well not be.
778457651428548609 2016-09-20 04:55:41 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 compared to Warren, Kaine was the safe pick.  But he is a GOOD man & his values R consistent with Hillary's who's also good.

778454126321479680 2016-09-20 04:41:41 UTC <Vva10967> @KatyTurNBC Crooked Trump didn't mind when the media was obsessed with Hillary's emails. We need more JOURNALISTS like @Fahrenthold
778452844475129856 2016-09-20 04:36:35 UTC <Vva10967> @JasonMillerinDC @SopanDeb Question is whether the media will give Crooked Trump a pass.  They always believe the worst of Hillary.
778271638781562881 2016-09-20 16:36:32 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @UniPolitica @ColoniaUSA Ves demasiado Faux News.  Te ha freido el cerebro.

778116870419480576 2016-09-19 06:21:33 UTC <Vva10967> @SopanDeb what Trump calls political correctness is actually the US Constitution.
778113104555245573 2016-09-19 06:06:35 UTC <Vva10967> @HeerJeet And it would be better if Bernie came out clean and admitted to his supporters that he slandered Hillary during the primary
778112289660604416 2016-09-19 06:03:21 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica la prensa la borro con sus constantes ataques contra Hillary y su tolerancia y excusas al odio que profesa Trump

777264806655094784 2016-09-17 21:55:45 UTC <Vva10967> @60Minutes you just hate Hillary.  If you were fair, you would go through the nonsense that is the Libertarian Party platform. #BatshitCrazy

776277535659294721 2016-09-14 04:32:41 UTC <Vva10967> @JuddLegum The Twitter platform allows it by allowing fake accounts. That accounts for their business failure. Should learn from FB. @jack
776277024981807104 2016-09-14 04:30:39 UTC <Vva10967> @JuddLegum Hillary is right about Trump attracting and giving a voice to the Deplorables.

775917777014050816 2016-09-13 04:43:08 UTC <Vva10967> @aseitzwald didn't the Trump Foundation also give $200K to Citizens United which would have been illegal as well?

775574636490854400 2016-09-12 05:59:37 UTC <Vva10967> @ericbradner @danmericaCNN in the meantime you could all be reporting on the very real fact that Trump has no clue how the Fed Reserve works
775567993833218048 2016-09-12 05:33:13 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou Some like @HardballChris can't even bring themselves to say that Trump LIES when he lies, says it's an opinion when it's a FACT

775384099678814208 2016-09-12 17:22:29 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod I don't recall President Obama telling the press if/when he got sick and he must have been sick SOMETIME in the past 10 yrs?
775373219876470784 2016-09-12 16:39:16 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT why do you think it's a gaffe? she allowed the press to hear her comments & included them in Israeli interview. And they're TRUE.
775372132314411008 2016-09-12 16:34:56 UTC <Vva10967> @SopanDeb so putting the press in a pen & having supporters spit at reporters is "respecting what the press does" per @KellyannePolls ???
775210645180542977 2016-09-11 05:53:15 UTC <Vva10967> @UniNoticias that was the position of ALL the other GOP candidates too except Jeb and Kasich. The GOP is the problem not just Trump.
775085302658527233 2016-09-11 21:35:11 UTC <Vva10967> @ryanlcooper you do know that Trump is 70 years old, right?

774761659931959301 2016-09-10 00:09:08 UTC <Vva10967> @alecshea @Atmanne @Nate_Cohn Trump doubles and triples down on his statements. She also has apologized.  Trump never apologizes.
774761284768243712 2016-09-10 00:07:39 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn they ARE irredeemable, that's why nothing Trump says sways them away. It's probably 40% since about 30% just suffer from CDS.
774760436164100097 2016-09-10 00:04:16 UTC <Vva10967> @alecshea @Atmanne @Nate_Cohn she said it ONCE and it wasn't about ALL black Americans but about repeat offenders.

774754894276419584 2016-09-10 23:42:15 UTC <Vva10967> @JuddLegum it's probably like 10% so about 33MM.
774754556072824832 2016-09-10 23:40:55 UTC <Vva10967> @thedailybeast @JoyAnnReid They can't help themselves lol. And everyone in that photo qualifies for the basket lol. It's even missing folks!
774754033814863872 2016-09-10 23:38:50 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @traceeloran that's a parody (fake) account. It uses an uppercase i instead of a lowercase L in Real.
774731849918717952 2016-09-10 22:10:41 UTC <Vva10967> @Artizek nah, it's probably about 40%.She forgot the roughly 30% who have Clinton Derangement Syndrome but don't necessarily fall in basket.
774704819948949505 2016-09-10 20:23:17 UTC <Vva10967> @DKElections Yep, same as Trump's "apology" where he expressed "regret". She regrets rounding up since real number is about 40% not 50%. lol
774703106684809221 2016-09-10 20:16:28 UTC <Vva10967> @ABCLiz True, it's more like 40%, lol.

774014428354273281 2016-09-08 22:39:54 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN U would think that at the State Dept server level U'd be able to do a search for a particular employee's emails but maybe not

772560576446857216 2016-09-04 22:22:49 UTC <Vva10967> @aravosis lol, Trump should proclaim that Robert Byrd was a white supremacist at his next West Virginia rally.  That will go over well, lol
772559644552261632 2016-09-04 22:19:07 UTC <Vva10967> @Jose4nton10 ahora vas a comparar los sistemas corruptos de Latinoamerica con los de USA??? Por favor, EDUCATE.
772551367655391236 2016-09-04 21:46:14 UTC <Vva10967> @Jose4nton10 HIllary obtuvo mas de 18 MILLONES de votos en 2008 y 17.5 MILLONES en 2016.  Bernie solo obtuvo 13 Millones. #MathMatters.
772551030307491840 2016-09-04 21:44:53 UTC <Vva10967> @Jose4nton10 no seas bobo.Hillary gano porque Bernie NO PUDO lograr q mas personas votaran por el.Hillary obtuvo 3.5 MILLONES mas votos q el
772548834744471552 2016-09-04 21:36:10 UTC <Vva10967> @Hillary_esp @MariaESalinas @Jose4nton10 No seas bobo.  Eso lo dijo Bernie porque queria ganarle a Hillary. Trump es pro-fracking y pro-coal
772548338831003648 2016-09-04 21:34:11 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas it's all the fracking.
772547785228967936 2016-09-04 21:31:59 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas @tokonaire991 they had Soledad O'Brien who was excellent but Jeff Zucker got rid of her when he took over @CNN & ruined CNN.
771932240175570944 2016-09-02 04:46:02 UTC <Vva10967> Seems Trump forgot to mention that he plans to implement Guiliani's stop & frisk program for men of color nationwidehttps://twitter.com/SopanDeb/status/771925874925002754
771819763907440647 2016-09-02 21:19:06 UTC <Vva10967> @speechboy71 the GOP recognized early on that Hillary had the brains & the drive 2 become our first woman POTUS & set out to destroy her.
771781350298968064 2016-09-02 18:46:27 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @joanwalsh @jack And that is why Twitter has fallen way behind Facebook.  There is merit to not allowing anonymous/fake accounts.

771762850260017152 2016-09-02 17:32:56 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC not if he signed the non-compete for his $40 million severance.
771218203108216832 2016-08-31 05:28:42 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro @AmandaRenteria as to Dreamers I'm pretty sure he said he would repeal the president's executive actions so they get deported 2
771214816782397440 2016-08-31 05:15:15 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica y @EPN le dio una plataforma para lucir "presidencial" sin tener q pedir disculpas por insultar a Mexico
771197627689873408 2016-08-31 04:06:57 UTC <Vva10967> @EPN pues esta noche en Arizona Trump dijo que Mexico SI pagar por el muro. Lo unico q usted logr es darle credibilidad a ese payaso.
771195180980449282 2016-08-31 03:57:13 UTC <Vva10967> @SopanDeb got to wonder what Trump believes the word retainer means, lol. Can't figure it out. It's not warrants bc they're already arrested
771055285351907328 2016-08-31 18:41:20 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 too funny bc the Mexican president is as popular there as W was in 2008. And this trip is only going to sink his #s further.
771039923998748672 2016-08-31 17:40:17 UTC <Vva10967> @versharma Thank God!  This is the woman trying 12 yo kids as adults and seeking life sentences w/o parole for them.
771027363882729473 2016-08-31 16:50:23 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn I think it has more to do with the rise of Faux News.
771025188028837890 2016-08-31 16:41:44 UTC <Vva10967> @CapehartJ love your articles & appearances on @amjoyshow. Thanks 4 debunking the HRC conspiracy theories. Wish more journalists would do it
770848161409662976 2016-08-30 04:58:18 UTC <Vva10967> @EPN Trump lleva consigo a uno de los Senadores mas racistas de EEUU, Jeff Sessions de Alabama.
770399499604860928 2016-08-29 23:15:28 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper why? he's not HRC's staffer.  His wife is.
770325379282268164 2016-08-29 18:20:57 UTC <Vva10967> @jeffzeleny is the September 13 event a joint event of @POTUS & @HillaryClinton or just POTUS? Your article says joint, their listing doesnt
770322122572955648 2016-08-29 18:08:00 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN you DO know that Weiner is not on Hillary's staff, right? I mean, you follow her around and Huma, not Anthony, is her staffer.
770321866548453376 2016-08-29 18:06:59 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN if his argument is that men who cheat on their wives shouldn't have access to classified info, yeah, let's go for it.

769905547617394688 2016-08-28 14:32:41 UTC <Vva10967> @rev_rodriguez @AlPunto por favor, si Trump en su vida ha abierto y mucho menos ha leido una Biblia.  Ni siquiera va a misa.

769734915004956672 2016-08-27 03:14:39 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow well it would help if we are able to give her a Democratic Senate AND House. Her ratings do go WAY UP doing the job.
769691602155700224 2016-08-27 00:22:32 UTC <Vva10967> @SopanDeb I think it's time for the press to start asking if the Donald is mentally ill.  It isn't normal to ramble all the time.
769660011043774464 2016-08-27 22:17:00 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod actually it sounds like something the Breitbart guy would write, so no. Campaign CEO would probably cheer him on.
769659598143913985 2016-08-27 22:15:22 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh mmmm, they would have to kick out the Dixiecrats, the Tea Partiers and the Alt Right first.

766426361703653376 2016-08-18 00:07:38 UTC <Vva10967> Children like this one are the refugees that the Republicans are so scared of.https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/766421425280483328
766425583203082240 2016-08-18 00:04:33 UTC <Vva10967> @SopanDeb he defines "truth" as his conspiracy theories and other nonsense that comes to his mind.
766424972793348097 2016-08-18 00:02:07 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica lo que el define como "verdad" son las teorias de conspiracion y otras estupideces q se le ocurren en su cabeza loca.
766419511897681920 2016-08-18 23:40:25 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid At least in Libya we didn't let Gaddafi bomb the hell out of his people or we'd have another Syria there.
766311597648273408 2016-08-18 16:31:36 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas no pero si lo puede hundir mas, lol.
766308238711201792 2016-08-18 16:18:16 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller @SeaBassNeely She didn't violate the law and she didn't lie about it to Congress. Comey gave bullshit talking points to MSM.
766140106973380608 2016-08-17 05:10:10 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @MaddowBlog @SteveKornacki @JoyAnnReid Busy day today w Trump reshuffle but maybe U can cover this on Thurs?https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/766130262669455360
766113332206112768 2016-08-17 03:23:46 UTC <Vva10967> @JesseLehrich @MrsHuney8814 Obviously NOT watching Faux News nor reading Breitbart like you have been.  Don't forget to change your tin foil
766103757704794113 2016-08-17 02:45:44 UTC <Vva10967> @JesseLehrich @MrsHuney8814 No, she does NOT lie.pic.twitter.com/JtONM1d22i
766011498095374336 2016-08-17 20:39:07 UTC <Vva10967> @AC360 Don't forget to ask her about her Russian meeting, her antivaxx position and her "wifi gives you brain cancer" stance.
765985471608553472 2016-08-17 18:55:42 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper lol, @GovEdRendell being his typical unhelpful self.
765984907961241600 2016-08-17 18:53:28 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @Troutfisher67 She didn't rig the vote. Getting the vote out requires a good ground game & organization, not rallies.
765984457937547264 2016-08-17 18:51:40 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @XTopGearUKfan It looks like he is splitting the Republican vote with Trump.
765983860270239744 2016-08-17 18:49:18 UTC <Vva10967> @utham1507 her base in MS is black voters not southern whites like Bernie implied in the primary.  They're outnumbered by whites.
765939700423069697 2016-08-17 15:53:49 UTC <Vva10967> @JesseLehrich ethical rules for legal profession say that in defending a client you cannot allow the client to lie and/or perjure himself.
765939215439896576 2016-08-17 15:51:54 UTC <Vva10967> @JesseLehrich well no, the proper analogy would be if there were doctors who help people DO bad things as he is helping NC DO a bad thing.
765938531235758080 2016-08-17 15:49:10 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow all they're missing now are the white hoods and robes. Got to wonder if he's burning down the Republican party on purpose, lol.
765936965065773056 2016-08-17 15:42:57 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica Trump agrego mas payasos a su circo. Todos expertos en fabricar conspiraciones y fantasias y en promover el odio.
765935839599886336 2016-08-17 15:38:29 UTC <Vva10967> @SopanDeb Sad that @realDonaldTrump has no understanding at all of FOIA.
765934219449237504 2016-08-17 15:32:02 UTC <Vva10967> Hey @jorgeramosnews you should ask him if he would quit if he were indicted for smoking and/or possessing marijuana, as he is a regular user
765769161075220486 2016-08-16 04:36:09 UTC <Vva10967> @newtgingrich but then Trump would lose his white supremacist base, no? Would also require AAs to forget how much hate GOP has shown Obama.
765767137046695936 2016-08-16 04:28:07 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica nuevamente leyendo de un teleprompter lo que le escribieron. A el y a su padre los declararon CULPABLES de descriminar en NYC.
765766414624026628 2016-08-16 04:25:15 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn Republicans have demonized the first black POTUS & tried to make his presidency illegitimate with birtherism, all because of race
765659142371549184 2016-08-16 21:18:59 UTC <Vva10967> @CapehartJ He's in denial.pic.twitter.com/pTLPnsKtXx
765658199404011521 2016-08-16 21:15:14 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports @albamonica see, every time you get to ask @HillaryClinton something, it's about her emails or her unfavorability.
765611710032056320 2016-08-16 18:10:30 UTC <Vva10967> @CapehartJ @MichaelSteele is in denial as to what the Party of Trump stands 4r. Was he in a coma when GOP leaders were fostering Obama hate?
765604707536670721 2016-08-16 17:42:41 UTC <Vva10967> @SenJohnMcCain but instead of trying to fix it, you've been busy blocking everything @POTUS has proposed & criticizing his foreign policies
765328078906294274 2016-08-15 23:23:27 UTC <Vva10967> @PeterWSJ Aren't Trump Fundraisers closed to the press as well?
765327704145141760 2016-08-15 23:21:58 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilipRucker bet he plans 2 follow his GOP primary strategy. Let him. It'll be funny 2 watch the GOP establishment react 2 his performance
765264665081446400 2016-08-15 19:11:28 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper why is it ok to coordinate with the Trump campaign? can he admit that this is all about his grudge against BO & HRC?
765263895443468288 2016-08-15 19:08:25 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller Comey is no different than Trey Gowdy, salivating to nail her & disappointed when they can't so give BS speech for press.
765252773197799425 2016-08-15 18:24:13 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow did they miss Trump's plan to overhaul the fed civil service so he can fire whomever he wants? Christie said it at fundraiser.
765193259778007040 2016-08-15 14:27:44 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @washingtonpost Trump's & Manafort's Russian connections R far more troubling than SOS staff volunteering at Clinton Foundation
765192769124102144 2016-08-15 14:25:47 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @washingtonpost media want tight horse race 4 ratings but it's irresponsible & puts country at risk. This is a fake "scandal".

764626566584426496 2016-08-13 00:55:54 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @JoyAnnReid @TimDNiles Maddow is objective & Chris Hayes is ok too.  The one that LOVES Hugh Hewitt is Matthews YUK. And Giuliani.
764625193692196864 2016-08-13 00:50:26 UTC <Vva10967> @20committee @JoyAnnReid That's going to be an odd Thanksgiving Dinner this year, lol.
764623983073525760 2016-08-13 00:45:38 UTC <Vva10967> @oliverdarcy cool!  maybe then they'll spend their newfound free time investigating Trump, lol.

764521878643961856 2016-08-13 17:59:54 UTC <Vva10967> @danbalz @SopanDeb I bet he can go lower, lol.
764335015425605632 2016-08-12 05:37:22 UTC <Vva10967> @Slate @amjoyshow Funny how scared MSM is 2 publicly discuss that Trumpers' motive is to Make America White Again. Everyone dances around it

764304963078086656 2016-08-12 03:37:57 UTC <Vva10967> @JesseLehrich they have enough to override @GovRauner. Only need 60% (3/5th) and those margins are 74% and 72%.
764302129918013440 2016-08-12 03:26:42 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper have you updated this fact check? Saw a national security expert (CIA official I think) in last month say she was correct.
764301125138915328 2016-08-12 03:22:42 UTC <Vva10967> @rubycramer it actually is.  But the structure and resulting accounting aren't unique to their foundation. They should do a video w/ graphs.
764300079574515712 2016-08-12 03:18:33 UTC <Vva10967> @mj_lee Yeah, she never had this much attn paid to her lol.But her trip 2 Russia is suspicious, is self-financing & won't release tax return
764299205133336580 2016-08-12 03:15:05 UTC <Vva10967> @mj_lee LOL. @DrJillStein sounds like Scott Walker's "Being A Boy Scout prepared me to be POTUS."
764297416669589504 2016-08-12 03:07:58 UTC <Vva10967> @GovGaryJohnson @SabrinaSiddiqui no, a wasted vote is voting for someone who cannot possibly win given our Electoral College system #reality

763962601369800704 2016-08-11 04:57:32 UTC <Vva10967> @nickconfessore Maybe U should read @KatyTurNBC's account of her life covering the Trump campaign & needing Secret Service protection, lol
763961068272037889 2016-08-11 04:51:27 UTC <Vva10967> oh c'mon @nickconfessore all your questions would be about her emails & Comey and why people don't like her. Why bother.
763959134706282496 2016-08-11 04:43:46 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @SpeakOutGeezer which is why the Congress exempted themselves from FOIA so unless someone hacks them, we WON'T see them.
763951081227362304 2016-08-11 04:11:45 UTC <Vva10967> @MattMackowiak one can only hope, lol. But he's just exposing what your party has been harvesting these past 8 years.  Karma is a b*tch!
763948151401091072 2016-08-11 04:00:07 UTC <Vva10967> @aseitzwald @guff232 You sound like a Bernie Bro who cannot let go of your hate for an imaginary Hillary.  The real one is a good woman.
763946035735519232 2016-08-11 03:51:43 UTC <Vva10967> @aseitzwald @guff232 so? she wants him to come out & say that Trump's unfit & dangerous.That's how you win a landslide & take back the House
763945183033434112 2016-08-11 03:48:19 UTC <Vva10967> @Shizzletheland @guff232 oh, you're stuck in 1964?  how sad.
763903698695294976 2016-08-11 01:03:29 UTC <Vva10967> @aseitzwald @guff232 She's friends with him.  That isn't a secret. She's also friends with W.  Doesn't mean she agrees with their policies.
763861568484478976 2016-08-11 22:16:04 UTC <Vva10967> @HFA You should make it into a TShirt and magnet too.

763860060590268416 2016-08-11 22:10:04 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn her speeches and interviews from the 1990s when she was first lady are very similar. A lot of them are in YouTube.
763856452838629376 2016-08-11 21:55:44 UTC <Vva10967> @AC360 Yes, of course. But that was yesterday's news.  Did you just get back from vacation or something?

763854365132263425 2016-08-11 21:47:27 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN Someone should tell those Bernie supporters that Bernie has moved on.
763854086248796160 2016-08-11 21:46:20 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN she's the only one focusing on wall street quarterly reports & effect on stock as drivers for companies moving manufg abroad.
763852799197253632 2016-08-11 21:41:13 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN I'm pretty sure the Trump campaign changes its songs quite frequently due to the cease & desist letters it gets from artists
763850725877309440 2016-08-11 21:32:59 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN maybe U should trade places with your CNN colleague covering the Trump campaign? @KatyTurNBC can fill you in on their fun.

763514742627590144 2016-08-10 23:17:54 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN @jaketapper The 10% are the grants to 501c3s. The rest of their work is done by employees who fall under Admin Expenses.

763501725026250752 2016-08-10 22:26:11 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper how about if U explain 2 your viewers what a foundation is, that money goes to charity & that Clintons don't take a salary.
763501094806904833 2016-08-10 22:23:40 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJ she was always facing it, one reason she was so pissed with Bernie is that he was fundraising for her primary challenger.

763235593501478912 2016-08-09 04:48:40 UTC <Vva10967> @tribelaw It was Bernie who said that. Hillary said we have 1 POTUS at a time and she wouldn't  do it.

763117914916610049 2016-08-09 21:01:03 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh I think Trump just managed to grab the rest of the evening news' coverage w/his 2nd amendment suggestion to his followers re HRC

762487271907930112 2016-08-07 03:15:06 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn probably because of the down ballot Senate seat that would come with a large turnout for her.
762484336415289344 2016-08-07 03:03:26 UTC <Vva10967> @jmpalmieri been watching @HillaryClinton speeches & would suggest adding 5 min on her plans for military & vets as discussed in VFW speech.

762478844917886978 2016-08-07 02:41:37 UTC <Vva10967> @MarthaRaddatz curious why do you believe that the 2 phone call scripts for Sec Clinton with the (c) markings put US security at risk?
762478264895975424 2016-08-07 02:39:19 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk Thanks, I actually read this before and you should too as it proves my point. The 2 line summary says it all.
762452607415693317 2016-08-07 00:57:21 UTC <Vva10967> @state @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk The AOL server IS a private server owned by AOL. We don't know what he sent bc he never turned in his emails
762451273337614340 2016-08-07 00:52:03 UTC <Vva10967> @iluvbkk no, it's just trashy, period.  Even the Melania nude photos were trashy.
762450785242263552 2016-08-07 00:50:07 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk No, they knew before, about 2 months before wikileaks.
762450602332794880 2016-08-07 00:49:23 UTC <Vva10967> @state @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk did it bother you when Colin Powell did it and then told State that he didn't save ANY of his aol emails?
762450342181113857 2016-08-07 00:48:21 UTC <Vva10967> @iluvbkk You should try reading less trashy papers, just saying.
762449954778460160 2016-08-07 00:46:49 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk you're confusing the FOIA issue with the classified info issue. Read the Politifact article. It may enlighten you.
762449397598728196 2016-08-07 00:44:36 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk Thanks for the link."Had Clinton used an @state.gov email address, its very likely that it would have been hacked, 2"
762447636083281920 2016-08-07 00:37:36 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk they CAN, they could with State, DOD, White House, even DNC.
762446891036528641 2016-08-07 00:34:39 UTC <Vva10967> @ninaturner @JoyAnnReid @iluvbkk BOTTOM LINE is that @SenSanders LIED TO YOU.It's normal to earn that much $$$ in NYC speeches. Obama will 2
762446654322520064 2016-08-07 00:33:42 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @ninaturner @JoyAnnReid @iluvbkk YEP, for 20 minutes. She gave over 100 speeches, was most admired woman in the world for 20 yrs
762446230777569280 2016-08-07 00:32:01 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk they CAN tell when a system gets hacked, did so with State Dept, DOD and White House.  That was 100% Comey speculating
762445882415419393 2016-08-07 00:30:38 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk Whatever security it had was superior to security at the State Dept, DOD & White House. All 3 got hacked. Hers didn't.
762445003801042944 2016-08-07 00:27:09 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert they could start talking about the landslide that could take the House away from GOP too instead of boring us with her emails
762443764602253314 2016-08-07 00:22:13 UTC <Vva10967> @Beansiesdaddy Can't fix stupid so I'm not even gonna try.
762443390495498240 2016-08-07 00:20:44 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @ninaturner @JoyAnnReid @iluvbkk KNEW that NY has a speaking market, it's a NY thing & that getting paid $200K/ speech is normal
762442685936381952 2016-08-07 00:17:56 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk And it was NEVER hacked, unlike the State Department system, the DOD and the White House.
762442511780421632 2016-08-07 00:17:14 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk she used her husband's existing private server.  It's just a PC with more HDs and RAM & different OS.  Big F Deal.
762441981926617088 2016-08-07 00:15:08 UTC <Vva10967> @thefix @karin21201 No, You are Thinking of Trump.
762440512900964352 2016-08-07 00:09:18 UTC <Vva10967> @thefix why would she give U a press conference when all you're going to ask are about her unfavorability and emails? #HillaryCoverageIsCrap
762431840749707264 2016-08-07 23:34:50 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid i disagree with @ninaturner. @SenSanders HAS to explain to his followers how Electoral College works. Voting 3rd party = Trump.
762356143834460160 2016-08-07 18:34:03 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 key is that if we get the House, economic relief needs to be felt ASAP or we'll lose it in 2018. That was Obama's mistake.
762355816213143552 2016-08-07 18:32:45 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 also (1) student debt refinancing.It's easy to fix & will give economic relief to millions AND (2) minimum wage increase now
762355112648015873 2016-08-07 18:29:57 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 also fixing ACA since premiums are going up too quickly. Mistake in ACA was to have bulk of fixes kick in 2014 and not 2010.
762354822976827393 2016-08-07 18:28:48 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 both immigration reform AND infrastructure spending. Obama wasted time with ACA & IR by letting GOP write bills.  HRC won't.
762154879603314689 2016-08-06 05:14:18 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 media wants a horse race so keeps giving negative spin to all stories about Hillary,even misquotes her at Q& A
762154234544582656 2016-08-06 05:11:44 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 do you believe her negatives are justified? Because Trump's are, he's earned them with every word coming out of his mouth!
762153141903224832 2016-08-06 05:07:23 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @JoyAnnReid isn't it weird that Jill Stein is also friendly with Putin? Was at same dinner as Flynn!https://twitter.com/zatchry/status/762053019563282432

761654489552187392 2016-08-05 20:05:55 UTC <Vva10967> @edatpost @OpHaveItAll why would she if all media ever asks is about her emails & then repeats that she's untrustworthy and unlikable?
761653756396199936 2016-08-05 20:03:01 UTC <Vva10967> @edatpost no, she said (1) that Comey said her testimony was truthful and (2) that her testimony was consistent with her public statements.
761652912955285504 2016-08-05 19:59:39 UTC <Vva10967> @edatpost STOP THE SEXISM WITH HILLARY.  You've been asking the same STUPID question for 40 years.  ENOUGH.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSYZ12LGVxw
761306568461877248 2016-08-04 21:03:24 UTC <Vva10967> @rubycramer Hillary actually has a plan to protect animals:http://hrc.io/2aYD4go
761086790153281537 2016-08-03 06:30:05 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @UniPolitica porque esa ha sido la tactica del partido republicano, meterle miedo a la gente para ganar elecciones
760958035187621888 2016-08-03 21:58:28 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh the media has labelled Kaine boring. Not sure why they bother covering Pence who is just as boring, maybe 2 C if he's embarrassed
760585707337515008 2016-08-02 21:18:58 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow saw this clip of you with @HardballChris.  I would LOVE to see a full segment discussing sexism & HRC https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WVc-yn1pOI
760576192223346688 2016-08-02 20:41:09 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @AlanKestrel750 @GatorJoe74 They had the right to bitch back, but considering going after him on religious grounds crossed line.
760574413829988354 2016-08-02 20:34:05 UTC <Vva10967> @newrepublic @JoyAnnReid They all seem blind to the fact that the GOP has gone racist & that the accelerator was the election of Obama.
760358469098700800 2016-08-01 06:16:00 UTC <Vva10967> @fusion @jorgeramosnews Not far enough because they won't disavow him and still support him
760352617948209152 2016-08-01 05:52:45 UTC <Vva10967> @greenfield64 I would not, would make me barf the entire time to see @hughhewitt and I KNOW I am not alone.
760352258823421952 2016-08-01 05:51:19 UTC <Vva10967> @greenfield64 Republicans haven't been country first since Mitch McConnell said they would make Barack Obama a one term President in 2009.
760331346376060929 2016-08-01 04:28:13 UTC <Vva10967> @SenJohnMcCain @JoyAnnReid Party Over Country.  SAD!
760324535954571264 2016-08-01 04:01:10 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh Chicken Trump is good.  The Berners already made the GIFs of the chicken w the Trump head in front of Trump Tower, was cool.
760240524473298944 2016-08-01 22:27:20 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Sanders gets more credit for his 13MM voters than Hillary did for her 18MM voters in 2008.  Truth is he lost by a landslide.
760236738879127552 2016-08-01 22:12:17 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 she should get a bigger bounce next week as Trump & his surrogates continue to trash the Khans.
760236001008742400 2016-08-01 22:09:21 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein oh it will last, Trump can't manage to keep his mouth shut.  He and his surrogates are doubling down on disparaging the Khans.
760234662249791488 2016-08-01 22:04:02 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid it's pretty easy for his opponent to turn all the comments Little Marco made about Trump during the primary into a killer ad.
760234185990762496 2016-08-01 22:02:09 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Do we know how Little Marco is polling in Florida?
760232294531604480 2016-08-01 21:54:38 UTC <Vva10967> @ninaturner @joanwalsh would be the new Ralph Nader, aka DC pariah since W fiasco in 2000.
760153522935570433 2016-08-01 16:41:37 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @CNN @maddow @JoyAnnReid @chrislhayes @washingtonpost @cnn @msnbc Just when you thought the right couldn't sink any lowerhttps://twitter.com/dcexaminer/status/760145455875497985
760150760306962433 2016-08-01 16:30:38 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN but @SenJohnMcCain and the GOP STILL SUPPORT TRUMP.  You CANNOT have it BOTH WAYS.  Still Party over Country.
760004683360571393 2016-07-31 06:50:11 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid did you see that Jill Stein is now trying to talk Nina Turner into joining her as VP?
760001994648092673 2016-07-31 06:39:30 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow LOVED your show. U & @maddow are the best. Smart & engaging, a breath of fresh air in a sea of sexist election coverage elsewhere
759609062157914113 2016-07-30 04:38:07 UTC <Vva10967> @CornelWest @AlanKestrel750 @cornelwest is a priviledged SOB who like @SusanSarandon wants to get Trump elected just to see the country burn.
759607143741923329 2016-07-30 04:30:30 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 I don't understand why @billmaher gives him a mic to spew his nonsense and doesn't call him out 4 his hatred of POTUS & HRC
759275306914050052 2016-07-29 06:31:54 UTC <Vva10967> @eldiariony Es una charlatana como lo fue Ralph Nader en el 2000.
759275089783164928 2016-07-29 06:31:02 UTC <Vva10967> @eldiariony la que engana es ella. La eleccion la gana la candidata q obtenga 270 votos del colegio electoral y es todo o nada por estado
759201842945458176 2016-07-29 01:39:59 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Tim yes. Hillary no, I've always seen her as a super achiever.
759175780832317441 2016-07-29 23:56:25 UTC <Vva10967> @Snowden can Russia hack the voting machines to change the results of the US elections?
759167499808178177 2016-07-29 23:23:31 UTC <Vva10967> LOL https://twitter.com/awebbiz/status/759084531110379520
759166780522856448 2016-07-29 23:20:39 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid yeayyyy!  I just turned off @hardball after @HardballChris invited @hughhewitt.  Looking forward to seeing you @allinwithchris
759164860760518657 2016-07-29 23:13:02 UTC <Vva10967> @hardball @HardballChris @MichaelLaRosaDC Started watching @Hardball 2day & nearly barfed listening to @hughhewitt.I'm not alone he kills your ratings
759154664763977728 2016-07-29 22:32:31 UTC <Vva10967> @bamasevere but after getting 2 know her & working w/ her, he now ADMIRES her & believes she's the MOST QUALIFIED CANDIDATE for POTUS EVER.
758415125376278528 2016-07-27 21:33:51 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica es una minoria de sus seguidores.  El 90% de sus seguidores entienden el peligro q representa Trump y votaran por Hillary.
758196954782457856 2016-07-27 07:06:55 UTC <Vva10967> @marcorubio Little Marco you need to stop watching it on Faux. Try CSPAN.  Bet you would at least enjoy our A list celebrities & music.
758191164554108929 2016-07-26 06:43:54 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid She won NY in a landslide. NYers remembered her work following 911.
758056423817355264 2016-07-26 21:48:30 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh looks like our schools have been failing for a long time.
758049397942910976 2016-07-26 21:20:35 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh @ana_braveIN The BernieOrBust R just like the Trump followers, low information and RUDE. 3 MSNBC inter'vd last nite were stupid.
758048401976156160 2016-07-26 21:16:37 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh why can't they move the hecklers from the front? it's annoying for the TV viewers who want to watch & listen to the speeches.
758048054725533696 2016-07-26 21:15:14 UTC <Vva10967> @ZekeJMiller Apparently people have no clue about conventions.  The nominee does NOT appear until the 4th day.  Trump did bc he had no clue
757827569181798400 2016-07-25 06:39:06 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC maybe the same ones he sent to Hawaii to look for POTUS birth certificate in 2011 LOL
757826414364139520 2016-07-25 06:34:31 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports Hillary's governing style is to LISTEN to people to determine what THEIR problems are and solve them, not impose her views
757642483065053184 2016-07-25 18:23:38 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper or it signals that she won't throw U under bus like so many other politicians do to save their skin. Loyalty is a Hillary trait.
757637978483200002 2016-07-25 18:05:44 UTC <Vva10967> @Lee_in_Iowa lol, he forgot to tell them that in his 1pm speech today.
757637681543319552 2016-07-25 18:04:34 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein I think Kaine is a very nice guy but lacks the excitement that Warren brings 2 stage. Hillary was more exciting candidate in 2008
757634355888095232 2016-07-25 17:51:21 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 @BernieSanders needs to spend more time attacking Trump & telling supporters HRC is ONLY way Dem platform gets implemented.
757633664570327040 2016-07-25 17:48:36 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 He convinced them that she's a "corporate whore" now it's hard to walk it back without admitting that he lied.
757633233412579329 2016-07-25 17:46:53 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC He convinced them that she is a "corporate whore". Now he has to figure out how to undo damage.
757625014648729601 2016-07-25 17:14:14 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid that's a protester cooling off.  Philly PD opened up fire hydrants so these fools wouldn't pass out in the 95F to 100F heat.
757623988747198464 2016-07-25 17:10:09 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid but except 4 the Bernie is Atheist thread all the other emails show is a very pissed DWS reacting to Sanders & Weaver TV attacks
757620266654654466 2016-07-25 16:55:22 UTC <Vva10967> @HuffPostBlog @McFaul they also show discussion re Bernie being an atheist to affect WV & KY results but it was NOT carried out. 2/
757619592533569540 2016-07-25 16:52:41 UTC <Vva10967> @HuffPostBlog @McFaul did author read the emails? they show bad blood & a pissed DWS & staff in April after Sanders & Weaver TV attacks. 1/
757440236997775360 2016-07-24 04:59:59 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden it's a consequence of Sanders choosing to attack HRC for her paid speeches.  He should have been forced to come clean on that.
757431853280292864 2016-07-24 04:26:40 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 sounds false. Obama & Biden have both traveled to FL 2 campaign for DWS & she's being moved to HRC's 50 State effort
757272267906748417 2016-07-24 17:52:32 UTC <Vva10967> @DemConvention when is Senator Warren speaking? I can't find her on the schedule.  Thanks.
757267530071183360 2016-07-24 17:33:43 UTC <Vva10967> @dilemmv but Sanders' campaign kept scapegoating DWS & DNC for his failure to turn up more voterd than HRC, creating bad blood w them.
757261525426069504 2016-07-24 17:09:51 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto bueno, no es una "posibilidad," Trump ha dicho claramente q si gana VA a eliminar DACA y tambien DAPA (q sigue en litigio).
757251876840697856 2016-07-24 16:31:31 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 but poll is from last year & reflected how Latinos felt against Little Marco who is fluent & also Cruz who isn't too fluent
757251432630353921 2016-07-24 16:29:45 UTC <Vva10967> @edatpost @WPJohnWagner that poll is old and reflected sentiment against Cruz and Rubio who spoke Spanish but were against Latinos.
757244340011933696 2016-07-24 16:01:34 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @JoyAnnReid is getting under Assange's thin skin, lol.
757243967020883968 2016-07-24 16:00:05 UTC <Vva10967> @Billthemanhall Sanders campaign has scapegoated DWS since they got caught accessing HRC supporter database, so bad blood was 2 B expected
757242504874000384 2016-07-24 15:54:16 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper DNC leadership's bad blood towards Sanders campaign when Sanders has been scapegoating them 4 his failures is now a "scandal"?
757240729576075264 2016-07-24 15:47:13 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow and while they discussed it they did NOT carry it out.  Sanders lost KY regardless and won WV.
757240384384884737 2016-07-24 15:45:51 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow They've been scapegoating @RepDWStweets ever since they got caught accessing HRC supporter database so bad blood was 2 B expected
757239171400564736 2016-07-24 15:41:01 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill yeah but his followers R either w/ HRC or against her & those against her said they wouldn't vote for HRC even if she chose Warren
757062214272618496 2016-07-23 03:57:52 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @Alvarado4Senate @UniNoticias crear el mayor deficit fiscal en la historia del pais y duplicar la deuda nacional? nueva depresion?
757061782439690241 2016-07-23 03:56:09 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @Alvarado4Senate @UniNoticias deportar a los Dreamers y a los 11MM de indocumentados? No dejar entrar a ningun musulman?
756737853288288256 2016-07-22 06:28:58 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica Los hermanos Castro necesitan aprender espanol.
756615609211904000 2016-07-22 22:23:13 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Castro got in trouble this week for violating an arcane rule about campaigning during a K Couric int http://bloom.bg/29TVxw2
756614568793743360 2016-07-22 22:19:05 UTC <Vva10967> @aseitzwald Obama announced day before DNC started so she should announce on Sunday. She's in Miami area tomorrow (Sat) so unlikely.
756613381809995778 2016-07-22 22:14:22 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Warren told Colbert she's speaking on Mon yet program replaced her w Bernie 4 Mon so I hope media is wrong & HRC chooses her
756603797691101184 2016-07-22 21:36:17 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 announcing the VP pick today would shift media attention from fact checking the Donald's speech. Obama announced day bf DNC
756602213628272641 2016-07-22 21:29:59 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto El partido Republicano es ahora el partido de Trump, aceptenlo.  El voto Hispano y AfroAmericano puede vencerlo votando por Hillary
756381942296240128 2016-07-21 06:54:42 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid what is it with these campaigns this year self describing as "movements"?  Hillary got over 3MM more votes & she's not doing it.
756380729915875328 2016-07-21 06:49:53 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @KyleLeith and yet it was Ivanka & her brothers that chose Pence, the most anti gay & anti woman VP ever
756375356261687296 2016-07-21 06:28:32 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @johnpodesta THIS would really excite the base! #GoBigAndBold Warren also manages media well.https://twitter.com/colbertlateshow/status/756345494058696704
756364567278739456 2016-07-21 05:45:40 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Comey deserves it, violated DOJ rules & gave talking points in a case where he recommended NO charges.  One liner is norm.
756359993063006208 2016-07-21 05:27:29 UTC <Vva10967> @BrFleurantin I think it's more a combination of Faux News brainwashing its viewers, reality TV dumbing down people & failing schools.
756356595811057664 2016-07-21 05:13:59 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton Warren is also best person 4 talking to blue collar workers who feel left out & students in debt & explaining YOUR plans. 2/
756355945677123584 2016-07-21 05:11:24 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton just finished watching Warren on Colbert. PLEASE go BIG & BOLD. Trump is too dangerous & WARREN IS BEST AT DEBUNKING him 1/
756206954062704640 2016-07-21 19:19:22 UTC <Vva10967> @JasStanford They're all cabinet members. WH chief of staff issued directive prohibiting cabinet secys from speaking at 2016 DNC.
755997079000981504 2016-07-20 05:25:24 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton even POTUS Obama was unable to find an effective explainer in chief to sell Obamacare to public.  Warren has that skill. 3/
755996514779074560 2016-07-20 05:23:09 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton Warren's communication skills will also help U sell your agenda to the public once elected & mobilize support for it. 2/
755995712865861632 2016-07-20 05:19:58 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton look at Warren's FB page, she's a great communicator & able to explain things effectively to voters, like no other VP can.1/
755945140158664706 2016-07-20 01:59:00 UTC <Vva10967> @NPR because it is REPUBLICANS that view Clinton unfavorable since 90s.  Trump is Trump and has EARNED his unfavorables with his rhetoric.
755944439227572228 2016-07-20 01:56:13 UTC <Vva10967> @SenTedCruz @TelemundoNews omitio la parte donde los Dems firman ley de derechos civiles y de voto y los racistas se cambian a Republicanos
755943453347971072 2016-07-20 01:52:18 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica Republicans forget that Christianity should be about Christ's teachings, like helping the poor & sick, which they don't follow.
755942286127693824 2016-07-20 01:47:40 UTC <Vva10967> @Alvarado4Senate @UniPolitica Pero el charlatan q promueve una politica de dictador tercer mundista es Trump, no Hillary.
755941841766416385 2016-07-20 01:45:54 UTC <Vva10967> @Alvarado4Senate @UniPolitica fallado como? Si Hillary aun no es presidenta! Trump tu candidato promueve racismo y xenofobia contra Latinos.
755940013750251520 2016-07-20 01:38:38 UTC <Vva10967> @marcorubio @UniPolitica para poder implementar la deportacion de los Dreamers, 11MM de indocumentados y muro q propone Trump. No se olviden
755938421990981632 2016-07-20 01:32:19 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN White House probably doesn't want Warren bc she strongly opposes TPP BUT Warren gives @HillaryClinton credibility on TPP oppo
755937904019529728 2016-07-20 01:30:15 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid did you see this video from the Clinton Campaign trolling Christie? It's funny!https://twitter.com/danmericaCNN/status/755878690794397697
755931270958419968 2016-07-20 01:03:54 UTC <Vva10967> @finneyk @HillaryClinton's platform is already so far to the left that it makes sense to make Warren VP to sell it & bring out the vote 2

755928536205160448 2016-07-20 00:53:02 UTC <Vva10967> @benchmarkpol @CAAttorney1 I prefer to be courted by Warren in English, TY, lol. We're kind of past that after W courted us in Spanish.
755923183132352512 2016-07-20 00:31:45 UTC <Vva10967> @AC360 Trump's plan for firing people is not limited to politicians but includes the civil service too.
755922874402213888 2016-07-20 00:30:32 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica o sea un Presidente que nos divida con su retorica de odio y racismo y que provoque guerras insultando a otros mandatarios?
755832855503175680 2016-07-20 18:32:50 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid can you mention this or show it to @billmaher?  I think it needs attention.  The rhetoric has cross the line.
755832610878787584 2016-07-20 18:31:51 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid please tell @billmaher that if he continues attacking Hillary we'll end up with President Trump. They are NOT equals.
755830000306294784 2016-07-20 18:21:29 UTC <Vva10967> @Pandorabalks that's what people keep saying, yet here we are, and he's the Party of Trump's nominee.
755820714784133120 2016-07-20 17:44:35 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid She probably also admires Hillary, lol.  Up until recently so did Donald Trump.

755815982472585216 2016-07-20 17:25:47 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports what if the Donald himself did the plagiarizing 4 publicity & they're now throwing Melania & writer under bus? #JohnBarron
755814509202341889 2016-07-20 17:19:56 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 I'm inclined to believe that it was the Donald himself who did the plagiarizing as a publicity stunt in John Barron style.
755813903901351936 2016-07-20 17:17:31 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid and yes I know that a staffer has taken the blame but he who likes to fire people didn't fire the staffer, bet he did it himself
755813611805835264 2016-07-20 17:16:22 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Given his John Barron history, I'm inclined to believe that it was the Donald himself who did the plagiarizing for publicity.
755813293370052608 2016-07-20 17:15:06 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC given his John Barron history I am more inclined to believe that it was the Donald himself who did the plagiarizing.

755632370557018112 2016-07-19 05:16:10 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 He's always putting her down on MSNBC, not new.
755631964355436544 2016-07-19 05:14:33 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro do U ever look at yourself in the mirror & take responsibility for your role in helping Trump rise? YOU put Hillary down 24/7. STOP.
755630656579928070 2016-07-19 05:09:22 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro You keep parroting that. Why do you hate her so much? I always see you attacking her on MSNBC.  Are you a closeted Trump supporter?
755627301648404480 2016-07-19 04:56:02 UTC <Vva10967> @serena_alway he cannot get over it, @jbarro hates Hillary.  He's always undermining her credibility on MSNBC. Maybe he was a BernieBro?
755626822889566208 2016-07-19 04:54:08 UTC <Vva10967> @DrPizza @jbarro FOIA never gave YOU the right to read her private emails & under statute SHE got to decide what was personal & what wasn't.
755626404990025732 2016-07-19 04:52:28 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro Neither does YOUR constant undermining of Hillary nor the cheap shots you take whenever you speak of her.  Y do U hate her so much?

755268611556737024 2016-07-18 05:10:43 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica es consistente con el mensaje de Trump q explota el odio de la base Republicana hacia los immigrantes Latinos.

754728047841083393 2016-07-17 17:22:43 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow saying what you think is for 5 year olds. Most of us are taught manners by that age. He INHERITED his business
754726148773388288 2016-07-17 17:15:10 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh @ninaturner @amjoyshow one thing you didn't mention are Vilsack's ties to Monsanto & how that is viewed (badly!) by progressives.
754725784552693760 2016-07-17 17:13:43 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow respect him for what? not knowing what he's talking about? scamming people? being a trust fund baby? insulting?
754724856374198273 2016-07-17 17:10:02 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow what happens with the rest of your show?  was looking forward to the interviews from OH that you had previewed in your timeline
754724474184929281 2016-07-17 17:08:31 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow I would think she expected him to express more outrage and/or to visit with the families as he has done in the mass shootings
754553962771152896 2016-07-16 05:50:58 UTC <Vva10967> @NPR because Johnson & his party's platform R fringe & Jill is an opportunist. And it's Republicans that dislike Clinton. Dems love her.
754550401811316737 2016-07-16 05:36:49 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn Vilsack was behind Dark Act which preempts right of states to require GMO labeling & just passed Congress.  Not good.
754548336720478208 2016-07-16 05:28:36 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn Vilsack is also pro TPP & him being on ticket would reinforce belief that she is too even if she says she is not.
754539681623056384 2016-07-16 04:54:13 UTC <Vva10967> @mattmfm @Nate_Cohn yes but he would lose her credibility with youth & base. Vilsack = Monsanto
754537967209836544 2016-07-16 04:47:24 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn @riotwomennn Vilsack's name brings up Monsanto which greatly upsets youth & liberals esp Bernie camp
754536747174916096 2016-07-16 04:42:33 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn Vilsack = Monsanto, most evil corporation for base. Would lose her the youth vote.
754474796700884992 2016-07-16 00:36:23 UTC <Vva10967> @NoahCRothman maybe he needs to switch parties. He's talking about purging his party's base, lol.
754435628742414336 2016-07-16 22:00:45 UTC <Vva10967> @aseitzwald @albamonica Progressives associate Vilsack with Monsanto. Few things are more revolting to the left than Monsanto. Big NO.
754432649280753664 2016-07-16 21:48:54 UTC <Vva10967> @johnpodesta For Progressives  & youth, Vilsack = Monsanto, the evil corporation. PLEASE do NOT pick Vilsack. Lets not anger the base. TY.
754431493573935104 2016-07-16 21:44:19 UTC <Vva10967> @johnpodesta True but let's make sure WE don't pick Vilsack who to Progressives represents Monsanto, the evil corporation.

754006180054392832 2016-07-15 17:34:16 UTC <Vva10967> @michaelgoodin don't be too sure.  This election is unusual & the conventional wisdom isn't prevailing. HRC still needs the youth vote.
754000678767452162 2016-07-15 17:12:25 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Also even listening to Theresa May in the UK, we seem to be riding a strong populist wave & that's Warren, not Kaine.
754000316991807488 2016-07-15 17:10:58 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid She's staying to the far left in her post-Primary speeches so she might as well add Warren's excitement to the ticket.
753998845873364992 2016-07-15 17:05:08 UTC <Vva10967> @MFItrader that's clearly NOT Comey's testimony. Your hate for Hillary BLINDS you but it doesn't change fact that she's honest & will win.
753779006651113472 2016-07-14 02:31:34 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid he didn't just "suggest it", he posted a video to FB saying he didn't know about it & won't be going. https://www.facebook.com/TimTebow/?fref=ts
753773535139622912 2016-07-14 02:09:49 UTC <Vva10967> @MFItrader you must have missed the part where Comey says to the GOP buffoon that @HillaryClinton didn't lie.
753772248352325632 2016-07-14 02:04:43 UTC <Vva10967> @ErikWemple @jaketapper is right. Trump wants to ban you.Hillary just ignores you.She might stop ignoring you if you all stop attacking her.

753753054776848384 2016-07-14 00:48:26 UTC <Vva10967> @JackAnderson75 & I'm not saying they would succeed, but they would go through the effort just like they did with Bill over perjury.
753751946717196288 2016-07-14 00:44:02 UTC <Vva10967> @JackAnderson75 a President Warren to them is worse than a President HRC. They could live with a President Kaine.  They impeached Bill.
753712780084187141 2016-07-14 22:08:24 UTC <Vva10967> @JackAnderson75 yeah but that would also encourage the Deranged party to try to impeach Hillary once she's POTUS.  Not so with Warren as VP.
753688415934218240 2016-07-14 20:31:35 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @duke_gail Vilsack = Monsanto.  Even I would have a really HARD time defending that choice.
753687323406135297 2016-07-14 20:27:15 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid he's ok as a surrogate but lacks the excitement & energy of Warren. Don't see how he'd excite young voters. Even MSNBC moved on.
753686475254931456 2016-07-14 20:23:53 UTC <Vva10967> @dilemmv MSNBC was too, they stopped broadcasting the event in the middle of Kaine's remarks (speech?).
753684408872345601 2016-07-14 20:15:40 UTC <Vva10967> @gdebenedetti even MSNBC dropped their coverage in the middle of his speech, too boring.
753681295067213824 2016-07-14 20:03:18 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow she needs to listen to her own speech about needing to go big and bold, lol.
753612248191467520 2016-07-14 15:28:56 UTC <Vva10967> @JerryMarkon Nop.  Justice O'Connor didn't in Bush v Gore and she had spoken out against Gore.  #precedent.

753288416905814017 2016-07-13 18:02:08 UTC <Vva10967> @kasie she should have added the FBI & the DOJ, which as we've seen can be and ARE USED for political witch hunts.
753241188325552128 2016-07-13 14:54:28 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews GOP always plays on people's fears and anger.  Remember how Ebola was going to kill us all? Yet crisis went away day after election
753240636799713280 2016-07-13 14:52:17 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper & the media plays along.Why don't you instead answer RBG's question of How he's gotten away w/not turning over his tax returns?

753090016184860673 2016-07-12 04:53:46 UTC <Vva10967> @SenWarren @johnpodesta as VP would keep Deranged Republicans from trying to impeach @HillaryClinton once sworn in. They hate Warren more.
753088774347886592 2016-07-12 04:48:50 UTC <Vva10967> @johnpodesta Warren as VP is only effective deterrent against Deranged Republicans trying to impeach Hillary after she is sworn in.
753087613230342146 2016-07-12 04:44:13 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews @RalphNader @ThisIsAmerica said the man who gave us George W. Bush...
753071395609964544 2016-07-12 03:39:46 UTC <Vva10967> @fusion @jorgeramosnews you must be one of the few remaining outlets that give Nader a microphone. Everyone else blames him for W Bush.
753068644737900545 2016-07-12 03:28:50 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki @elizabethforma certainly could beat him.
752700389544394752 2016-07-11 03:05:32 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Saw a tweet from BernieOrBust earlier asking folks to show up in NH at 9am w "Don't Endorse" & "NeverHillary" signs.
752667099152211968 2016-07-11 00:53:14 UTC <Vva10967> @kasie also @elizabethforma ensures deranged Republicans won't try to impeach @HillaryClinton after she's sworn in.  They hate Warren more.
752666034902077440 2016-07-11 00:49:01 UTC <Vva10967> @kasie Probably right.  Hillary's staying to left & not pivoting to center so Y would she pick a center VP? Seems she's riding populist wave
752664188766552064 2016-07-11 00:41:41 UTC <Vva10967> @JebBush @UniPolitica No porque va a perder la eleccion.  De nosotros los Latinos depende q el pais no entre en una nueva recesion economica
752660232266997760 2016-07-11 00:25:57 UTC <Vva10967> The Republican witch hunts of @HillaryClinton will not stop until we vote them out Send message #VoteBlueNoMatterWhohttps://twitter.com/oliverdarcy/status/752624638543486976

752656729649840128 2016-07-11 00:12:02 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon Hillary needs @elizabethforma as her VP.  Only deterrent to deranged Republicans trying to impeach her after she wins in Nov.
752536217737199617 2016-07-11 16:13:10 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou aside from the content, the editing is awful.  A 10 yr old can edit videos better, lol.

752357618266566657 2016-07-10 04:23:28 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow we now know that @HillaryClinton will be speaking on Mon7/18 at NAACP's conference & that would be a high bar for Trump to follow
752355434850316288 2016-07-10 04:14:48 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @amjoyshow @JoyAnnReid LOVED the show!  You & @Maddow are the best @MSNBC shows.  Great choice of panelists too.
752353112917217280 2016-07-10 04:05:34 UTC <Vva10967> @thedailybeast so you prefer pie in the sky, fairies, pixie dust, unicorns & empty slogans instead of policies that are paid for? #ImWithHer
752348816330948612 2016-07-10 03:48:30 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @joanwalsh @amjoyshow you know @SenWarren would keep Republicans from trying to impeach @HillaryClinton once she becomes POTUS

751920587644153856 2016-07-09 23:26:52 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 she can explain it as she'd be decriminalizing it at fed level & letting states make their own decisions,which would be true
751919482285723648 2016-07-09 23:22:29 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Trudeau announced he'll be pardoning all Canadian prisoners convicted of a marijuana offense. Dems should do it too.
751916426164838400 2016-07-09 23:10:20 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 sounds like he needs psychiatric help BADLY.  What a loser.

751819406389473281 2016-07-09 16:44:49 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 2/ that he lost because the election was "rigged"? doesn't he have to expressly say that neither is true?
751819076087975937 2016-07-09 16:43:30 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 1/ so how does Bernie bring his followers into the tent after he convinced them that HRC is a "corporate whore" &

751631694491480065 2016-07-08 04:18:55 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou exactly, with emails media chose to parrot Comey's GOP talking points instead of investigating further including his motives.
751626548567048192 2016-07-08 03:58:28 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm Racism is alive and well and Faux and right wing keep it that way.
751620694837002240 2016-07-08 03:35:12 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 it's not new, she offered it right after he lost the primary on 6/7 but while stubborn, he isn't stupid & has ignored her.

751235641447514114 2016-07-07 02:05:08 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 and Chaffetz uses a freaking GMAIL address for official business, it's in his Congressional business card!
751235069960974340 2016-07-07 02:02:52 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 they're probably just going to rebuke Comey's public criticism of their email practices.
751234678649225216 2016-07-07 02:01:19 UTC <Vva10967> do you know where this photo was taken? Tx

751071255588143106 2016-07-07 15:11:56 UTC <Vva10967> Hey @SpeakerRyan time to investigate Rep Jason Chaffetz' email use.  He conducts OFFICIAL buz on GMAIL.https://twitter.com/brianefallon/status/751068819825844224

751063520670867456 2016-07-07 14:41:12 UTC <Vva10967> @RepCummings @OversightDems Comey needs to B questionned on why he provide talking points when DOJ rules prohibit it http://wapo.st/29xGl8W
751060784076165120 2016-07-07 14:30:19 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes here let me help you.Look into the CONTENT of the emails. Then you would understand why FBI had no case http://bit.ly/29y79Gf
751059046942343169 2016-07-07 14:23:25 UTC <Vva10967> @SpeakerRyan you need to read this since apparently Comey didn't brief you on content of "classified" emails: http://bit.ly/29y79Gf
751058316671979520 2016-07-07 14:20:31 UTC <Vva10967> @SpeakerRyan & the 8th thread was about a call to the President of Malawi & was classified bc all calls to heads of state are. 2/
751057881684930560 2016-07-07 14:18:47 UTC <Vva10967> @SpeakerRyan Comey did tell you that the 7 of 8 threads were classified BECAUSE they mentioned CIA's drone program which press knew about?1/
751057041926582272 2016-07-07 14:15:27 UTC <Vva10967> @SpeakerRyan So @realDonaldTrump can get these briefings and @HillaryClinton cannot?  SERIOUSLY?
750910581318844416 2016-07-06 04:33:28 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon oh that will go over well. I suppose that's one way for Dems to win back the House, lol.
750905246122139648 2016-07-06 04:12:16 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow can you do a story on Comey's remarks re Hillary's emails? They were misleading.  See article:  http://bit.ly/29y79Gf

750901079236304901 2016-07-06 03:55:43 UTC <Vva10967> @PolitikMasFina only Trump would think of making his golf caddy his campaign's social media director, lol.
750899007132667904 2016-07-06 03:47:28 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki here, read these 2 articles so you can LEARN what Comey was referring to: http://bit.ly/29jfQn5  & http://bit.ly/29y79Gf

750790652150112256 2016-07-06 20:36:55 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 So is he saying that Bernie supporters sound like Republicans? LOL
750785210787229696 2016-07-06 20:15:17 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon will Dems attend?  Seems that we need @RepCummings there to cross examine Comey.
750724315809718272 2016-07-06 16:13:19 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJ @WSJPolitics Looks like Comey accepted & the hearing will be Thurs.Not surprised since Comey is a witch hunting Republican like Gowdy.
750723882647187456 2016-07-06 16:11:36 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJPolitics @WSJ If we hadn't taken out Gaddafi we'd have another Syria in Libya & you'll all be bitching about THAT instead
750720976472666113 2016-07-06 16:00:03 UTC <Vva10967> @PaulBegala he cleared her because he had no case.  He still gave GOP a roadmap to attack her violating Dept Rules.
750720544962674689 2016-07-06 15:58:20 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJPolitics @WSJ They should decline.  Separation of powers.  And Republicans in House need to stop wasting taxpayer $$$ in witch hunts.
750378787544698880 2016-07-05 17:20:18 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto Trump es un burro.  El fiscal q llevo el caso de Petraeus explico claramente porque no hay comparacion http://usat.ly/1KW0POD
750378113901686784 2016-07-05 17:17:38 UTC <Vva10967> @Eugene_Robinson @pavehawk2007 Comey never said MARKED & 4 a reason. The classification fight is about mentioning drones & comes from CIA.
750377270246776832 2016-07-05 17:14:17 UTC <Vva10967> @RealBenCarson @mitchellreports bad judgement? From the guy who supports Trump for President? ROFL!
750376804955938816 2016-07-05 17:12:26 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC no, that's the media's fault.  Why don't you all concentrate your efforts on Trump?  That's FULL of REAL scandals.
750374121045889024 2016-07-05 17:01:46 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes keep in mind that the mere mention of drones is deemed "[top]secret" by gov agencies as if media & public didn't know drones exist.
750353028583198721 2016-07-05 15:37:57 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 H.A. Goodman must be having a nervous breakdown, LOL.
750352675024281600 2016-07-05 15:36:33 UTC <Vva10967> @allinwithchris @chrislhayes keep in mind that gov considers any mention of drones as top secret or secret, as if the public didn't know.
750008986058055680 2016-07-04 16:50:51 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou yes @jbarro @mitchellreports and @chucktodd come to mind. They're playing a dangerous game trying to keep election as horse race.

749720881744715776 2016-07-03 21:46:02 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid not to defend him, but it may be that the white supremacists follow him & he's stupid enough to retweet them or save their memes
749633187454877696 2016-07-03 15:57:34 UTC <Vva10967> @KeithOlbermann but Trump got the original meme from a Neo Nazi site:http://bit.ly/29n9eUX
749624087727734785 2016-07-03 15:21:24 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC @FaceTheNation @MittRomney as Trump would say, LOSER, lol. Lacks courage to stand up & actually DO something to derail Trump.
749451562095874048 2016-07-02 03:55:51 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton well it's code for Make America WHITE Again.  David Duke & the KKK certainly understand it that way. #NeverTrump #IMWithHer
749342213176451072 2016-07-02 20:41:20 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports why do you hate @HillaryClinton so much?
749097741507112960 2016-07-01 04:29:53 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon how about having @POTUS return the favor from 2008 and nominate @HillaryClinton at the DNC Convention?  THAT would be AWESOME!
749000387152244736 2016-07-01 22:03:02 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Nooooo. Too boring.  She needs someone exciting to get the vote out.  #ClintonWarren2016
748971081923461120 2016-07-01 20:06:35 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto no es la primera vez, Johnson es el eterno candidato del partido libertariano.  En 2012 obtuvo menos del 1% del voto.
748754772975505408 2016-06-30 05:47:03 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica sin embargo el mismo Sanders no se atrevio a desmentir a Biden cuando Chris Hayes le pregunto si Biden habia  mentido
748753524872187909 2016-06-30 05:42:06 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 I think Slanders is waiting for July 8 bc he still thinks that he won CA from reading all the BernieBot memes
748588024095600640 2016-06-30 18:44:27 UTC <Vva10967> @davelevinthal 45 days seems awfully long.Most he should get are 10 days.The Senate is not even in session now bc of the 4th of July holiday
748581459749904384 2016-06-30 18:18:22 UTC <Vva10967> @Wade_Turnbull You must be a BernieBro.  Go read the 1st Amendment, it may do you some good, assuming you can comprehend it.
748378317787631616 2016-06-29 04:51:09 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica porque no pueden invitar solo a la candidata Democrata y no al Republicano y les repugna invitar a Trump
748369528892104705 2016-06-29 04:16:14 UTC <Vva10967> @USATODAY @amjoyshow Dude sounds like a brainwashed BernieBro.  Very similar to the young black woman from 6/28 Los Angeles townhall.
748273155861520388 2016-06-29 21:53:17 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica y culpa a los recortes q los Republicanos hicieron al presupuesto del Departamento De Estado por el ataque en Benghazi 2/
748272636971593728 2016-06-29 21:51:13 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica y la hermana del embajador Stevens dice q los Republicanos deben de parar de explotar la muerte de su hermano 1/
748268040748474369 2016-06-29 21:32:57 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper did God tell @marcorubio that?  or was it Trump whom he supports but doesn't endorse??? #GOPFarce
748267080156319744 2016-06-29 21:29:08 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM he should ask Scott Brown how well that worked for him, lol.
748195565977075716 2016-06-29 16:44:58 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein With or WO headshaving? Maybe 4 Act 2 Trump can have Clint Eastwood do an encore talk with the chair? LOLpic.twitter.com/MW01AanMEt
748193103320846337 2016-06-29 16:35:11 UTC <Vva10967> @BrosforBillary Trump has sealed the fate of the Latino/Hispanic vote, lol.
748192291668402177 2016-06-29 16:31:57 UTC <Vva10967> @middleclassnumb I thought "moderate Republicans" were an extinct species, lol. I think Warren excites the Dem base & helps get Dem vote out
747997992649621504 2016-06-28 03:39:53 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro are you sure this is still your party?  that's the same response that @jorgeramosnews got from Trump's security back in Aug 2015
747969990834388998 2016-06-28 01:48:37 UTC <Vva10967> @finneyk not just about trade, also about Hillary lol.
747969363714646016 2016-06-28 01:46:07 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid if U have the platform folks on @amjoyshow again can U ask them Y this wouldn't solve Fracking issue? Txhttps://twitter.com/Vva10967/status/747966290430681093
747967390844092416 2016-06-28 01:38:17 UTC <Vva10967> .@finneyk @neeratanden @keithellison seems to me that problem w Fracking can be resolved by revoking 2005 exemptionshttps://twitter.com/Vva10967/status/747966290430681093
747966290430681093 2016-06-28 01:33:54 UTC <Vva10967> @RepCummings 2005 Energy Policy Act exempted Fracking from Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act & CERCLA.Y Not Revoke it?
747944470377816064 2016-06-28 00:07:12 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 that cannot end well for the UK....he's giving the EU every incentive to screw the UK on trade.
747923659973591040 2016-06-28 22:44:30 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports Yet conclusion was the same: Diplomats could NOT have been saved.  Nice try Andrea! @HillaryClinton @NBCNightlyNews
747913071964852229 2016-06-28 22:02:26 UTC <Vva10967> @vineetagupta1 lol & I suggest that you not be so gullible. Tulsi is a politician like the rest. She probably didn't even write the email.
747911187455676417 2016-06-28 21:54:57 UTC <Vva10967> @vineetagupta1 so she thinks we should let Assad kill the rest of his people?
747910674848817152 2016-06-28 21:52:55 UTC <Vva10967> @vineetagupta1 @l0milesniper W had him post-911 in Afghanistan but let him go, wasn't interested in catching him. Obama & Hillary were & did
747909407292403712 2016-06-28 21:47:52 UTC <Vva10967> @l0milesniper @vineetagupta1 you shouldn't believe fundraising emails.  They're generally BS and count on folks being gullible.
747905293632299009 2016-06-28 21:31:32 UTC <Vva10967> @vineetagupta1 @l0milesniper No the idiot who ignored CIA memo on BinLaden attacks was W.  Too busy vacationing in TX. Even Trump agrees.
747904585516322818 2016-06-28 21:28:43 UTC <Vva10967> @vineetagupta1 The Middle East is ungovernable thanks to W. Everybody wanted Gov to kill Gaddafi after he freed PanAm bomber in oil 4UK deal
747685679677726721 2016-06-27 06:58:52 UTC <Vva10967> @Wade_Turnbull he worked for them and got paid. What's the big deal?
747684362884386816 2016-06-27 06:53:38 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Obama announced that Biden was his pick 2 days before Dem convention
747682009955307520 2016-06-27 06:44:17 UTC <Vva10967> @Wade_Turnbull exactly so why is it even newsworthy that Sid Blumenthal made $200k?
747681575962288130 2016-06-27 06:42:33 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid after Brexit can't see Wall Street not going never trump. They don't want a repeat of 2008 economic collapse.
747680207822274560 2016-06-27 06:37:07 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @tresec29 @Spectricide HRC values loyalty. He endorsed Obama in 2008 after being a Clinton Sec of Energy & UN Secretary
747675697083187200 2016-06-27 06:19:11 UTC <Vva10967> @vineetagupta1 why?  3000+ people died in the WTC and W didn't resign nor apologize. Happened under his watch AND in the homeland.
747674876874457088 2016-06-27 06:15:56 UTC <Vva10967> @Wade_Turnbull newsflash:  $200K is not an unusual salary for DC or NY.
747672438905909249 2016-06-27 06:06:15 UTC <Vva10967> @mattizcoop Sherrod is a nice guy but pretty unexciting too. HRC's speech w Warren was farther left than campaign has been so far.
747567889293651968 2016-06-27 23:10:48 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @FoxNews @CBSNews @ABC GOP had enough votes to pass bill regardless of HRC not voting.
747567705792843777 2016-06-27 23:10:04 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @FoxNews @CBSNews @ABC HRC didnt vote on 2005 bill bc Bill Clinton was having heart surgery that day 6/
747567236383182849 2016-06-27 23:08:12 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @FoxNews @CBSNews @ABC Bill came back in 2005 when GOP controlled both Senate & House  & passed. 5/
747566812431261696 2016-06-27 23:06:31 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @FoxNews @CBSNews @ABC child support claims. House version of bill didn't have amdts & bill died in reconciliation. 4/
747566414970630144 2016-06-27 23:04:57 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @FoxNews @CBSNews @ABC in Senate bill came up again & Chuck Schumer had amendments added to address priority of 3/

747565700345171968 2016-06-27 23:02:06 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @FoxNews @CBSNews @ABC Warren had her facts wrong in that interview. She objected to creditors claims being senior /1
747564397715939329 2016-06-27 22:56:56 UTC <Vva10967> @HeidiKlein9 it's not meant to get Bernie bots on board just the reasonable progressives that voted for him. The Cult is a lost cause.
747563500541718533 2016-06-27 22:53:22 UTC <Vva10967> @mattizcoop nop, she lacks the excitement that Warren generates in the base & the populism that voters seek.
747562569615970304 2016-06-27 22:49:40 UTC <Vva10967> @instapundit @mattizcoop we're not saying HRC should choose her BECAUSE Warren is a woman but because of who she is & what she represents
747555070397526016 2016-06-27 22:19:52 UTC <Vva10967> @WorldForBernie @damnpamfromnamm go charge that battery you fool.
747554801165164544 2016-06-27 22:18:48 UTC <Vva10967> @WorldForBernie @damnpamfromnamm If VT had been attacked instead of NY, Bernie would have voted FOR THE WAR. HRC represented NY in Senate.
747553432853159936 2016-06-27 22:13:21 UTC <Vva10967> @WorldForBernie @damnpamfromnamm She never said settle for $12. She has the votes for $12 & some cities in the South would go BROKE at $15
747552483308879873 2016-06-27 22:09:35 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @yeomandroid To win against HRC, @BernieSanders needed to turn out >18 MM votes bc that's how many people voted 4 her in 2008.
747551920592658432 2016-06-27 22:07:21 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @jaketapper @yeomandroid she won fair & square.  There was NEVER a revolution, that was media nonsense created for ratings.
747551216884932608 2016-06-27 22:04:33 UTC <Vva10967> @WorldForBernie @damnpamfromnamm actually YOU are the ones who believe anything. All the nonsense that the GOP has been promoting for years.
747550745566785538 2016-06-27 22:02:41 UTC <Vva10967> @WorldForBernie @damnpamfromnamm Not true. You're either reading GOP nonsense or can't read financials.Get an education,may help U get a job
747550157038850048 2016-06-27 22:00:20 UTC <Vva10967> @damnpamfromnamm He's on his OWN side, along with his HUGE ego & the fools who make up his Cult. U worship a mythical Bernie.
747549376017477632 2016-06-27 21:57:14 UTC <Vva10967> @ninaturner how come @BernieSanders tolerates his followers calling HRC "a whore"? Comes from his slanders on HRC.https://twitter.com/CryBabyPrize/status/747471520646082560
747492933692186624 2016-06-27 18:12:57 UTC <Vva10967> @WorldForBernie Oh please, U need to learn the difference between corporations and foundations. The money is going for charity.
747310196381224960 2016-06-26 06:06:49 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon Hope Hillary chooses Warren. Tired of Sanders & his refusal to concede. Can't tell anymore whose side he is on. #ImWithHer
747161881731801088 2016-06-26 20:17:28 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid look at this one: http://nydn.us/28XHSFG Houston mom bitches about Obama & Dems wanting to take her guns away, kills daughters
747159221041508352 2016-06-26 20:06:54 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica bueno no, SI las propone pero no le gusta que las llamen asi.
747111021664473088 2016-06-26 16:55:22 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @jaketapper also needs to tell his followers that she won fair & square. She got 18MM votes in 2008 and 17MM in 2016.
747110142831923201 2016-06-26 16:51:53 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper No @BernieSanders slandered Hillary & should tell his followers that she is NOT the "corporate whore" that he painted her to be
747108726801375232 2016-06-26 16:46:15 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 actually a lot of people voted for him because he slandered Hillary & he needs to walk that back & admit he lied.
747095415229681664 2016-06-26 15:53:22 UTC <Vva10967> @Reforma @jorgeramosnews Los politicos que aplaudieron la decision de la Corte Supreme son todos Republicanos.
747093225916203008 2016-06-26 15:44:40 UTC <Vva10967> @HernandezGlobal @AlPunto yo no seria tan optimista, Donald Trump no es precisamente una persona logica. Mejor es salir a votar por Hillary.
747090582435209217 2016-06-26 15:34:09 UTC <Vva10967> @RepBecerra @AlPunto tiene razon en Noviembre tenemos q votar Democrata no solo por Presidenta sino tambien por Congresistas, Senadores, etc
747089530591805440 2016-06-26 15:29:59 UTC <Vva10967> @UnivisionNews and the triumph of Pride & Prejudice there is now tearing the UK apart, will lose them jobs & worsen the recession
746789355478487040 2016-06-25 19:37:11 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow we're in a populist wave. She needs Warren not Kaine.
746397479269179396 2016-06-24 17:40:01 UTC <Vva10967> @MetcalfeMegan He won't be.  He's playing U along but every now and then he slips & admits he will vote for her.  He likes the attention.
746393520496381952 2016-06-24 17:24:17 UTC <Vva10967> @MetcalfeMegan In 2008 Bernie said Obama WAS the nominee 2 days after last primary yet he needed 351 Supers to get to 2118.
746390150599573505 2016-06-24 17:10:53 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 yeah but he then went on the CBS morning show & said he wouldn't endorse HRC unless she agreed to his campaign proposals.
746387940557922304 2016-06-24 17:02:06 UTC <Vva10967> @jonlovett Maybe that's his strategy 4 our economy, he causes the dollar to crash & low & behold his golf courses in the US see a boom.
746387258085941248 2016-06-24 16:59:24 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews @AlPunto @Choco2273 No, la corte no decidio eso.  El caso sigue en marcha y talvez no se decida hasta el 2017.
746386938630901761 2016-06-24 16:58:08 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews @AlPunto Vi a muchos polticos aplaudir la decisin de la Corte Suprema- omites algo importante: que TODOS eran REPUBLICANOS
746385223387123712 2016-06-24 16:51:19 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid HIllary should just pick Warren as VP & leave Sanders behind w his Cult.  Bernie can't understand that he LOST & her ideas won.
746384520547545088 2016-06-24 16:48:31 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @MalyndaNyc @clary264 Arguing w BernieBots is pointless.They're a Cult that worships a mythical Bernie & hates a mythical HRC.
746382083988262912 2016-06-24 16:38:50 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews yes w/ Brexit, no w/ SCOTUS.  SCOTUS is the result of the Senate refusing to hold hearings to confirm 9th Justice, not fear.
746380671266992128 2016-06-24 16:33:13 UTC <Vva10967> @MetcalfeMegan @VinkayemKaren For the record, I AM NOT WITH BERNIE, NEVER HAVE BEEN, NEVER WILL BE.  #ImWithHer.
746380227492847616 2016-06-24 16:31:27 UTC <Vva10967> @MetcalfeMegan you've all created a mythical Bernie to worship and a mythical Hillary to hate. #ImWithHer #ShesOurNominee
746145179258626051 2016-06-23 00:57:28 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica seguro que Trump le paso sus datos lol
746125222814842881 2016-06-23 23:38:10 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica ironico que no reconozca el triunfo de la mujer que le gano la nominacion.
746106432735555585 2016-06-23 22:23:30 UTC <Vva10967> @MetcalfeMegan they're not concessions.  He's describing a Hillary Clinton presidency.  Left out the parts where they disagree.
746106016790642690 2016-06-23 22:21:51 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost @amjoyshow Funny Bernie's describing a Hillary Clinton presidency.  Left out free college, single payer healthcare & trade.
746103862021492736 2016-06-23 22:13:17 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica en que Trump y Boris Johnson parecen y suenan como gemelos separados al nacer, LOL.
746103196288942081 2016-06-23 22:10:38 UTC <Vva10967> @LesterHoltNBC @NBCNightlyNews In the National Enquirer, of course, LOL.
746097409588084736 2016-06-23 21:47:38 UTC <Vva10967> @KatyTurNBC sounds like Reagan when questionned about Iran-Contra but it turned out he had Alzheimer's... wonder if Trump does too?
746090284417753088 2016-06-23 21:19:20 UTC <Vva10967> @FiveThirtyEight but he's "supporting" Trump.
746051562284421120 2016-06-23 18:45:28 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @CCarlosorbe Bullsh*t, los Republicanos bloquean y seguiran bloqueando cualquier reforma migratoria al igual que DACA y DAPA.
746050683791618048 2016-06-23 18:41:58 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton tambien es importante votar Democratic por Senador, Congresista y puestos estatales y locales.
746050052293017600 2016-06-23 18:39:28 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Bernie Bots think the world revolves around them. Palin didn't lose McCain the election bc of gender but bc she was stupid.
746047027847569408 2016-06-23 18:27:26 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes Trump's twin separated at birth, aka Boris Johnson.
746046133336694784 2016-06-23 18:23:53 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM @CNN UGH, now with Lewandowski your election coverage just got more unbearable to watch!  Miss when CNN that was a news channel
746045047896936448 2016-06-23 18:19:34 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto Bueno, no los 8 jueces, solo los 4 que son Republicanos. Los Republicanos estan en contra de DACA y DAPA y de la Reforma Migratoria
746044076575834112 2016-06-23 18:15:43 UTC <Vva10967> @SusanDanzig219 I'm arguing that Warren should be the VP and I think that @_silversmith is too.  What are YOU arguing in all these tweets?
746042875805319168 2016-06-23 18:10:57 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @CCarlosorbe Lo tuvieron por 15 meses y no es culpa de los democratas q los votantes le entregaran el poder al GOP en 2010
746038702120538112 2016-06-23 17:54:21 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow So Warren SHOULD be her VP.
746038285315747840 2016-06-23 17:52:42 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow well he's just decoding Trump's slogan
746037294386266112 2016-06-23 17:48:46 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @mitchellreports why do you bother interviewing @RealBenCarson? R U desperate to fill in time? should have asked him about pyramids!
746007665160110080 2016-06-23 15:51:02 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto la solucion es votar Democrata no solo para Presidente sino tambien para el Senado y Casa de Representates y puestos estatales
746006945438568448 2016-06-23 15:48:10 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica No porque no hubo decision, lo que deja claro es que los Republicanos pueden obstruir las acciones ejecutivas del Presidente
746003113451069440 2016-06-23 15:32:56 UTC <Vva10967> @votolatino El partido Republicano es el enemigo.  Cada uno de los estados que se oponen a DAPA y a DACA tienen gobernadores Republicanos.
745475309529530368 2016-06-21 04:35:38 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @_silversmith Lol. Wall Street probably wants to protect its jobs & won't risk another Great Recession with Trump.
745474833522135040 2016-06-21 04:33:45 UTC <Vva10967> @_silversmith @JoyAnnReid @tmwinsett @SusanDanzig219 Bernie Bots are a lost cause but not all 12.5MM Bernie voters R bots. Most aren't.
745470647438966790 2016-06-21 04:17:07 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Also Warren started fundraising for Hillary today and did the Move On video that was released today as well which was quite good
745469939947954176 2016-06-21 04:14:18 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Bet it's Warren. Julian is too inexperienced and doesn't speak Spanish which is a liability if you want to excite Latino voters
745002035544731648 2016-06-20 21:15:01 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports @JoyAnnReid @maddow @lnteGritty He lost the election, time to lose the Secret Service protection that we, the taxpayers,pay
745000810522763264 2016-06-20 21:10:09 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @JoyAnnReid @mitchellreports How come no one's report'g how much $$$ Bernie's Secret Serv continues to cost?https://twitter.com/Amy_Siskind/status/744974559984685056
744999306864771072 2016-06-20 21:04:10 UTC <Vva10967> @FiveThirtyEight As bad as Nixon was, W still tops the list.  The damage he did will be with us for decades to come.
744997150749298688 2016-06-20 20:55:36 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki So now the media is going to build another Frankenstein, pushing Gary Johnson?  Trump wasn't enough?
744757576185843712 2016-06-19 05:03:37 UTC <Vva10967> @lovinabox @joanwalsh it's old from end of May. DNC said they're NOT removing Barney Frank nor Dan Molloy from the committees.
744751197769338884 2016-06-19 04:38:17 UTC <Vva10967> @MattReynolds615 Not at all.  Your sexism blinds you.  He would never pass vetting.  Media was lazy w Sanders and Hillary didn't pursue it.
744562375668473857 2016-06-19 16:07:58 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @MrDane1982 @goblackcentral 12.5MM shows that there was NO revolution, just a normal election where 1 candidate liked rallies.
744367735228989440 2016-06-18 03:14:32 UTC <Vva10967> @MattReynolds615 I am, HRC won in a landslide vs Bernie: 3X the # of pledged delegates that Obama had over her in 2008.There's no revolution
744046690039173120 2016-06-17 05:58:49 UTC <Vva10967> @MattReynolds615 ugh no. We voted for Hillary's ideas not Bernie's pie in the sky, plus he chose to slander her to drive up her negatives.
743934245400358912 2016-06-17 22:32:00 UTC <Vva10967> @business probably not, lol.
743931936004055040 2016-06-17 22:22:49 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 @LunaMoon137 well 4 days after but still. Last primary was on a Tues, Bernie endorsed Obama that Thurs & HRC conceded on Sat
743929484231970817 2016-06-17 22:13:05 UTC <Vva10967> @BestWestern @DrNealBarnard isn't that oily?
743929207588282368 2016-06-17 22:11:59 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein it's a stupid idea & shows she has never filled out a 1040 nor a Schedule A since she seems to have no F clue of what is in them.
743653406649294848 2016-06-16 03:56:03 UTC <Vva10967> @lizcgoodwin However, almost 4 million MORE voters rejected his ideas & voted for Hillary's. Why R we going to transform party to his image?
743651381047889920 2016-06-16 03:48:00 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM & she should learn how that 1040 and Schedule A work before drafting stupid bills. Unlike GOP, WE, Dems, CANNOT be the party of stupid.
743650651650031617 2016-06-16 03:45:06 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT Just what those GOP Senators needed, LOL.  Thanks W!
743551802516344832 2016-06-16 21:12:18 UTC <Vva10967> @FiveThirtyEight only reason ANYONE in media is going along w/that notion is bc HRC is a woman. In 2008 they told HRC you lost, GET OVER IT.
743550120319410177 2016-06-16 21:05:37 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 until Sanders confesses to his followers that he lied when he told them that the election was rigged,they won't accept loss.
743526799292895232 2016-06-16 19:32:57 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs @SenJohnMcCain never got over losing the presidency to a black man.
743526156658409480 2016-06-16 19:30:24 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC @SenJohnMcCain should re-read his concession speech & stop being such a sore loser. Hope Latino vote retires him in Nov.
743494372411457536 2016-06-16 17:24:06 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow Could U do a piece on how classified info is handled at Secs of State & Defense or even POTUS levels? i.e. email system vs SCIFs
743493152460410880 2016-06-16 17:19:15 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow would be powerful if in Sep-Oct Laura & Barbara Bush were to endorse Hillary.
743290263230095360 2016-06-15 03:53:03 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 I think once people get to know Johnson and Libertarian platform and see how fringe they are, his numbers go down.
743289076397281280 2016-06-15 03:48:20 UTC <Vva10967> @sahilkapur people in 2008 thought we weren't ready for a black POTUS either. #ClintonWarren2016
743188470777151489 2016-06-15 21:08:33 UTC <Vva10967> @guerrerosdegb by the way, I think you are wasting your time.  Trump's followers are driven by hate.  Let them be, just make sure U vote.
743183355600986112 2016-06-15 20:48:14 UTC <Vva10967> @MANNYDESANTIAGO @guerrerosdegb I would appreciate it if you would STOP including me on your thread.  TY.
742967827624263680 2016-06-14 06:31:48 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Hillary's win vs Sanders has been a landslide but media pretends it's been close. Her pledged del lead is 3x Obama's over her.
742960958797172736 2016-06-14 06:04:30 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki Hillary will be an awesome POTUS & will run for her 2nd term in 2020. Only question is what is left of the GOP after Nov lol
742844791885565952 2016-06-14 22:22:54 UTC <Vva10967> @jeffzeleny @jaketapper doubt it, you guys (the media) keep telling him that the race was close when it wasn't.  45% to 55% isn't close.
742839496908124161 2016-06-14 22:01:52 UTC <Vva10967> @UniNoticias @jorgeramosnews deeply troubled, uh?  but not deeply enough to boycott him and his campaign, lol.
742602024773095424 2016-06-13 06:18:14 UTC <Vva10967> @davidplouffe But Trump's a reflection of what GOP has become so wouldn't entire GOP have to be destroyed 4 his kind not to rise again?
742598010849361920 2016-06-13 06:02:17 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM ALL media outlets should boycott Trump campaign until he rescinds Washington Post revocation
742490402272468993 2016-06-13 22:54:41 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @NBCNews If press had guts, U would ALL boycott Trump campaign until Trump reinstalls Washington Post credentials.
742489686539657217 2016-06-13 22:51:50 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost @PostBaron If press had guts, they would ALL boycott Trump campaign until Trump reinstalls Washington Post credentials.
742489413821816832 2016-06-13 22:50:45 UTC <Vva10967> @Reuters @nytimes @USATODAY @MSNBC If press had guts, U would ALL boycott Trump campaign until Trump reinstalls Washington Post credentials.
742488933024550912 2016-06-13 22:48:51 UTC <Vva10967> @thedailybeast @JoyAnnReid @maddow If press had guts, U would ALL boycott Trump campaign until Trump reinstalls Washington Post credentials.
742488179303952384 2016-06-13 22:45:51 UTC <Vva10967> @nprpolitics If press had guts, U would ALL boycott Trump campaign until Trump reinstalls Washington Post credentials.
742487696250175492 2016-06-13 22:43:56 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews so is he now proposing that we expel from the country US Citizens who are muslim??? or that we put them in internment camps?
742486582041673730 2016-06-13 22:39:30 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost @CBSNews @CNN @ABC @NBCNews If press had guts, U would ALL boycott Trump campaign until Trump reinstalls WAPO's credentials.
742486077760536577 2016-06-13 22:37:30 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews maybe you should follow up & ask him if what he has in mind are internment camps for American muslims? Shooter was American-born.
742366185765900288 2016-06-13 14:41:05 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs yet consistent, Trump's entire campaign "ideas" are based on right wing hate radio shows with a few sprinkles of Faux News.
741664199064064000 2016-06-11 16:11:39 UTC <Vva10967> @CNNgo @CNN you continue to give him free press.  How is a political speech "news"???
741663369653018625 2016-06-11 16:08:21 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow surely you can find someone on the right that is less obnoxious than Hugh Hewitt?  Please? I love your show but can't stomach him
741512322548633600 2016-06-10 06:08:08 UTC <Vva10967> @lizcgoodwin @MikeMiguel the 90s were great, rising salaries, economic prosperity, budget surpluses, peace.The 50s on the other hand weren't
740786672145715201 2016-06-08 06:04:40 UTC <Vva10967> @CNBCnow @Nate_Cohn Bernie endorsed Obama 2 days after last primary in 2008. Didn't care that he'd met required # of delegates w/ supers.
740780684109860865 2016-06-08 05:40:52 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn Hillary's results in 2008 were much more impressive than Sanders' and she conceded & didn't call her campaign a "revolution"
740751407775649792 2016-06-08 03:44:32 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @metaquest it's not anti-TPP hysteria, the clause she objected to would allow corporations to sue our govt & should come out.
740750561285398528 2016-06-08 03:41:10 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid probably white men.  But Hillary needs someone who can excite the base like Warren and he's BORING.
740678759393681408 2016-06-08 22:55:52 UTC <Vva10967> @BuzzFeedAndrew Well, HE, Ed Rendell, should NEVER EVER be considered as he tends to put his foot in his mouth every time he speaks.
740675164405432322 2016-06-08 22:41:34 UTC <Vva10967> @mmfa but yet they think that Trump is ready to be POTUS.  Who cares what they think.
740674541568069632 2016-06-08 22:39:06 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC should he say "I made a mistake saying out loud what we're only supposed to say in code?"  LOL
740615518923718656 2016-06-08 18:44:34 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein sounds like Bernie is even thinner skinned than Trump.
740601156322353152 2016-06-08 17:47:30 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod @GlennThrush bc GOP excuse re Mexican R rapists comments is that they were directed at illegals.  Judge Curiel is US born.
740600244002521089 2016-06-08 17:43:52 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC we need TRUMP's taxes to see if he's successful in his businesses as he claims he is & to see if he has given $$$ to vet groups
740599532694740996 2016-06-08 17:41:02 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC Both are irrelevant.  Democratic race is over.  On to Trump and it is important that Trump release his taxes.
740599098806575104 2016-06-08 17:39:19 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews it shows that you put party ahead of country which is what the GOP has been doing for at least the past 8 years.
740429219579219968 2016-06-07 06:24:17 UTC <Vva10967> @AC360 apparently not but he IS very good at lying to his supporters
740403355277795328 2016-06-07 04:41:30 UTC <Vva10967> @ABCLiz no way. He chose to slander her to drive up her negatives when he knew better.
740317041803005952 2016-06-07 22:58:31 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki we are not confused, @SenSanders is.  Seems that he wasn't confused in 2008 when he said Obama had won WITH supers.
740040010531999744 2016-06-06 04:37:42 UTC <Vva10967> @latimes @TS13Creative in 2008 Sanders believed supers should be counted to reach required #.  He said Obama had won primary on June 5th.
739670052258127873 2016-06-05 04:07:37 UTC <Vva10967> @lightshallow Supers will not overturn the will of the voters & her lead by end of Tuesday will exceed 3 million votes and 300 pledged dels
739667916115836929 2016-06-05 03:59:08 UTC <Vva10967> @lightshallow they would switch if he had won in votes & pledged delegates as was case w/ Obama, but he didn't. He LOST.
739584282855931904 2016-06-05 22:26:48 UTC <Vva10967> @kasie or not. People forget that Hillary got close to 18 Million votes in 2008 & that those voters LOVE her. Sanders crowds R 1000s not MMs
739569905520005120 2016-06-05 21:29:40 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki but Bernie isn't, he is 3 million votes behind and that number will grow with NJ and NM, maybe even with CA if CA isn't a tie
739553272348966912 2016-06-05 20:23:35 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports I know this is hard for U 2 believe, but maybe Dem voters actually like Hillary? Her race against Obama in 2008 was way closer
739487114300100608 2016-06-05 16:00:41 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports @UAProgressives No, California voted for HILLARY in 2008 Democratic Primary.  #FeelTheFacts.
739483028293058560 2016-06-05 15:44:27 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto por favor sean serios, este pobre senor no tiene idea de lo costoso y dificil que es una candidatura por la presidencia en USA.
739316953689509888 2016-06-04 04:44:32 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports @UAProgressives Umm Hillary won California in 2008 & yet lost the primary. #FeelTheMath
739302055634964480 2016-06-04 03:45:20 UTC <Vva10967> @falconalina but it's not all Americans, it's Republican Americans that have that phobia, the same ones that follow Trump.
739275508630867968 2016-06-04 01:59:50 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews Clinton gana aun si pierde California. Gana la nominacion con NJ.  Sanders lo sabe. Cualquiera q pueda contar lo sabe.
739263793667182592 2016-06-04 01:13:17 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM did he not get the memo that the winner of the GOP primary defines the agenda?  GOP is now the Party of Trump.  He should accept it.
739263169294655488 2016-06-04 01:10:49 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs in 2008 Barack Obama did NOT reach 2118 with elected delegates alone, supers were in the count, so Bernie's argument is nonsense.
739262308279541760 2016-06-04 01:07:23 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports & that the winner of the election by over 3 million votes & over 250 elected delegates be denied the nomination she EARNED 3/
739261965642653696 2016-06-04 01:06:02 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports media also needs to spell for people that what @SenSanders proposes is that the loser of the election, him, be crowned king 2/
739261680136388608 2016-06-04 01:04:54 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports the media needs to call him on that, Barack Obama WON after the last 2008 primary WITH superdelegates counted to reach 2118 1/
739260731170902017 2016-06-04 01:01:07 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton don't forget his letters to NYC Mayors Giuliani & Bloomberg asking them to remove street vendors who were vets from 5th Ave.
739257337597308928 2016-06-04 00:47:38 UTC <Vva10967> @lizcgoodwin yes, code word for Make America White Again.  But media won't call him on it.
739256764785414144 2016-06-04 00:45:22 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews Trump's going to have SOME support among Latinos.  He has some among blacks too even though he rose in the GOP through Birtherism.
738804923563921408 2016-06-03 18:49:54 UTC <Vva10967> @politico @JoyAnnReid @LeahRigueur @bertha1957 well there are Blacks who support the GOP despite all the hate it spews on President Obama.
738584123506229248 2016-06-02 04:12:31 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC well he must have promised Ryan that he will sign his cut medicare & social security bills so he's bound to say it @ fundraiser
738573574114545664 2016-06-02 03:30:36 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn LOL if close Sanders will make CA do a recount just like he did in KY. Cannot accept that over 3MM voters prefer Hillary to him.
738572959640653824 2016-06-02 03:28:10 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn @LapGongLeong Dem contests R all proportional; she ends up with more than 2026 pledged no matter what happens in CA. #FeelTheMath
738533591756476417 2016-06-02 00:51:44 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki Hillary won California in 2008. Did it matter? No. Obama won California in the general.
738517566923014144 2016-06-02 23:48:03 UTC <Vva10967> @ABCLiz because that race is over. Only Bernie & his followers seem unable to do the math. #FeelTheMath
738456726786179072 2016-06-02 19:46:18 UTC <Vva10967> Seems no one told Trump's SuperPAC that coordination with his campaign is not allowed!  @brianefallon @maddow @HFAhttps://twitter.com/teddyschleifer/status/738452826087690240
738413383775584258 2016-06-02 16:54:04 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @ElNuevoDia puede proponerlo pero el Congreso lo controlan los Republicanos y su propuesta no va a ningun lado
738239248613187584 2016-06-01 05:22:07 UTC <Vva10967> @hardball @JoyAnnReid by the way whatever happened to Tad Devine?
738103697717272576 2016-06-01 20:23:29 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 only reason they are even in the news is the media trying to create a headline where there isn't one.Their platform is fringe
737761959630753792 2016-05-31 21:45:32 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes Y do U keep entertaining claim that 2383 must b met w/ pledged dels alone when BO won vs HRC w/o reaching 2118 w/pledged alone?
737751570725621762 2016-05-31 21:04:15 UTC <Vva10967> @mmurraypolitics no San Francisco?  How come?
737699656029851648 2016-05-31 17:37:58 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes if his leaks were a public service shouldn't he then get a Presidential pardon?
737698197989134336 2016-05-31 17:32:10 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJ so will this work & shut you up? or will you go after his lies & deceptions? how about his letters to remove vet vendors off 5th Ave?
737697502791602177 2016-05-31 17:29:25 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid maybe President Obama should have thought of that... oh wait, he has held rallies since elected and it hasn't worked! mmmm
737695205105754113 2016-05-31 17:20:17 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @maddow @chucktodd Shouldn't we get a disclaimer? Olbermann was fired over not disclosing much smaller amounthttps://twitter.com/Maggyw519/status/737172110141886465
737425943980068864 2016-05-30 23:30:20 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews no seria raro, a Trump lo apoyan el Sheriff Joe Arpaio y la gobernadora Brewer. Solo falta Pete Wilson.
737345421442420736 2016-05-30 18:10:22 UTC <Vva10967> @Beverlyb11 isn't that the Oklahoma governor? doesn't look like Susana Martinez who is the governor of New Mexico, just saying.
737062631077466112 2016-05-29 23:26:39 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM Trump repeats like a parrot what Limbaugh and the likes say. I'm surprised he didn't say he read it in the National Enquirer, lol.
736955958077870080 2016-05-29 16:22:47 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid sounds like he reads Trump's logo as Make America White Again, no?
736954389139689472 2016-05-29 16:16:32 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica el ataque al server de Clinton q se describe en el informe NO fue exitoso y los servers del State Dept SI han sido hackeados 5/

736951322096832517 2016-05-29 16:04:21 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica la controversia la crean los medios de comunicacion.  La ley de FOIA es sobre preservacion de documentos para el publico 1/
736755410317811712 2016-05-28 03:05:52 UTC <Vva10967> @benchmarkpol @Mypes45 although in tomorrow's Face The Nation interview Sanders finally admits that process isn't "rigged" (now it's "dumb")
736750787678904324 2016-05-28 02:47:30 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas @jorgeramosnews @jdbalart did you see this?https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/736620556938842112
736703649917898752 2016-05-28 23:40:12 UTC <Vva10967> @billmaher After June 8th, Bernie's security should be back to normal.  June 15th if he pushes it.
736701971755847680 2016-05-28 23:33:31 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @UniPolitica el candidato mas fuerte es el que obtiene la mayor cantidad de votos: @HillaryClinton, ganando por mas de 3MM!
736582692624596992 2016-05-28 15:39:33 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow can MSNBC make your show segments available somewhere? e.g FB or MSNBC YouTube channel? would love to share them w friends on FB
736582070105968644 2016-05-28 15:37:05 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow @amigoaguilar you're in denial, the GOP is now the Party of Trump and stands for what HE stands: Xenophobia, mysogeny & racism.
736581453912408064 2016-05-28 15:34:38 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow @maddow can U debunk myth that if no one gets reqd # of Dem dels w pledged dels alone U have a contested convention?e.g. BO & HRC
736579491921833984 2016-05-28 15:26:50 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews U DO know that classified business is conducted via secured connections & not email, right? This is a FOIA record keeping problem.
736578807507918848 2016-05-28 15:24:07 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews @Newsweek does much better job UNDERSTANDING what the report ACTUALLY says.
736578354485268480 2016-05-28 15:22:19 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews will you be scrutinizing Trump's claim that California drought is made up by the feds & that he can fix it?
736440990517624832 2016-05-27 06:16:29 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes @Newsweek has done a much better job on this story.FOIA is about record keeping not security & retroactive classification is stupid
736438715787182081 2016-05-27 06:07:26 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @billmaher the winner of the primary is the person with the most VOTES not the person who polls better.  Respect will of voters.
736438015053201408 2016-05-27 06:04:39 UTC <Vva10967> @billmaher Hillary has 3 million more votes than Bernie & the longer he stays in to weaken her, the more he strengthens Trump.
736436690856910848 2016-05-27 05:59:24 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @billmaher ignored that she who gets the most votes WINS the primary not he who polls better because no one has attacked him
736226827291758592 2016-05-27 16:05:28 UTC <Vva10967> @beccalenn and yet the press continues to give him free airtime and lets him get away with whatever he wants just for the ratings.
736005375284109312 2016-05-26 01:25:30 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas esa ha sido la posicion del partido Republicano - lo mismo propusieron Rubio y Cruz y hacerlo aun mas rapido.
736001694274838528 2016-05-26 01:10:52 UTC <Vva10967> @DanaBashCNN @AC360 so U think HRC should have printed every email when received & sent & put them in a box to be manually indexed & stored?
735987597634359296 2016-05-26 00:14:51 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid as much as I enjoy your wisdom @hughhewitt makes me barf Surely @TheLastWord @Lawrence can find someone less dislikable on right
735937150974341121 2016-05-26 20:54:24 UTC <Vva10967> @rauldemolina @ElGordoyLaFlaca This is one reason @Univision will continue to FAIL to attract the college educated Latino/as. #Barf.
735878682917638144 2016-05-26 17:02:04 UTC <Vva10967> @allinwithchris can you guys upload the segment about the Trump vitamins scheme?
735874660726902784 2016-05-26 16:46:05 UTC <Vva10967> @KatyTurNBC so does he stop campaigning now in California, New Mexico & NJ?
735872494939340800 2016-05-26 16:37:29 UTC <Vva10967> @Carrasquillo years? 2 at most, no? 2013 when GOP had its post-2012 election report to 2015 when Trump said Mexicans R rapists & criminals.
735864154473521152 2016-05-26 16:04:20 UTC <Vva10967> @TheBriefing2016 @dailybeast how was the investment part of the scheme not illegal under US Securities Laws? Can U find out w NYAG & US SEC?
735863741032587267 2016-05-26 16:02:42 UTC <Vva10967> @NYTNow @MariaESalinas But that's the press narrative & what the press keeps telling people.  Report said her 4 predecessors did same thing.
735629962317795328 2016-05-25 00:33:45 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod so what do you think is the difference between endorsing Trump and supporting him? @KellyAyotte will support but not endorse?
735540829335498752 2016-05-25 18:39:34 UTC <Vva10967> @FrankLuntz here, why don't you educate yourself about government servers:  http://www.newsweek.com/2016/02/19/colin-powell-emails-hillary-clinton-424187.html
735540623655206912 2016-05-25 18:38:45 UTC <Vva10967> @FrankLuntz AOL servers were private servers, owned by AOL, not the government, and that is what Powell used.
735523781234597888 2016-05-25 17:31:49 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein high-quality? Seriously? your bar for quality is extremely low, lol.
735521785425301504 2016-05-25 17:23:53 UTC <Vva10967> @KellyAyotte I can't figure out what the difference between "endorsing" and "supporting" @realDonaldTrump is.  Can you explain it?  Thanks.
735521020921188353 2016-05-25 17:20:51 UTC <Vva10967> @jonlovett what do you think is difference between endorsing and supporting Trump? Can't figure it out, lol.  eg. Kelly Ayotte
735506251673665536 2016-05-25 16:22:10 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM Jeff Weaver is such a jerk.  What would he know about how a woman would feel in that situation? male chauvinist pig.
735500158763454465 2016-05-25 15:57:57 UTC <Vva10967> @business your tweet is misleading, @SenSanders has no clout in a GOP controlled Congress.
735324474820661248 2016-05-24 04:19:51 UTC <Vva10967> @starledger funny that @HillaryClinton wins when turn out is high, which is the exact opposite of what @SenSanders tells the media happens
735323638535233537 2016-05-24 04:16:31 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica estaria muy mal si hubiese perdido considerando que es el UNICO candidato Republicano que queda en la contienda, no? lol
735227567440072704 2016-05-24 21:54:46 UTC <Vva10967> @eyi_rick keep telling yourself that, truth is @SenSanders is a sore loser who can't stand losing to a woman.  And no he ain't getting VP.
735222669713477632 2016-05-24 21:35:18 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @maddow why don't media outlets say that in 2008 neither BO nor HRC had # of pledged dels = number req'd for nom (then 2118)?
735220416634052608 2016-05-24 21:26:21 UTC <Vva10967> @eyi_rick last 2008 primary was Tues 6/3, she conceded Sat 6/7. Pledged del totals: BO 1767 vs HRC 1640, diff= 127. Magic # for nom = 2118.
735154021909024768 2016-05-24 17:02:31 UTC <Vva10967> @eyi_rick no, the 2008 California primary was held on the February 5 Super Tuesday.
735153222827008001 2016-05-24 16:59:21 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJD With all the rightwing conspiracy theories Trending Topics will end up like the Microsoft chatbot on twitter that had to be pulled lol
735149165508956161 2016-05-24 16:43:14 UTC <Vva10967> @eyi_rick CA wasn't this late in the schedule last time.
735138784753426437 2016-05-24 16:01:59 UTC <Vva10967> @HFA @ChelseaClinton Since @HillaryClinton is clinching the nomination as soon as NJ is called, will there be a celebration event?#NJPrimary
734594791544094721 2016-05-22 04:00:21 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM oh good, then she really has NOTHING to worry about since that will never happen, lol.
734547628336283650 2016-05-22 00:52:56 UTC <Vva10967> @60Minutes @NorahODonnell why is it so difficult to admit GOP treats Obama different than any prior POTUS & that YES IT IS BC of HIS RACE!
734546548923715585 2016-05-22 00:48:39 UTC <Vva10967> @vj44 @60Minutes @NorahODonnell you repeated all the Faux News BS, are you Republican and just couldn't hide your biases?
734545775389245440 2016-05-22 00:45:34 UTC <Vva10967> @condoqueenCS you do know that being sovereign means that you get to say NO to USA help & that diplomats killed abroad isn't unique to HRC?
734228076096262144 2016-05-21 03:43:09 UTC <Vva10967> @ABCLiz she's being kind, lol. Tanking not just ours but also the world's economy & starting WW3 as he nukes Iraq and Syria are far worse.
734130931250909189 2016-05-21 21:17:08 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @DavidCornDC Lying Trump.
734127218411114496 2016-05-21 21:02:22 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid did Sanders win DWS's district?  bc he lost badly to HRC in FL. Sanders scapegoats DWS when truth is more Dems voters prefer HRC
734122669268979712 2016-05-21 20:44:18 UTC <Vva10967> @mmfa p.s. Maria Celeste Arraras is Telemundo's anchor, not Univision's.
734121682206613508 2016-05-21 20:40:23 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid I think Sen Merkley will be able to talk sense into Bernie come 6/7- I just wonder how he walks back his 'process is rigged' lie
733716763276349440 2016-05-20 17:51:22 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @Eugene_Robinson @davidaxelrod has a hard time accepting that more Dem voters prefer Hillary over him. Reminds me of McCain & BO
733443554253668352 2016-05-19 23:45:44 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @mitchellreports it's clear millions of Americans can count & believe that she who wins the popular vote wins the primary.
733439694722236416 2016-05-19 23:30:24 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica @MANNYDESANTIAGO no, es anti-immigrante.  No te enganes, si un seguidor de Trump te ve en la calle, va a decirte Go Home
733353148035796992 2016-05-19 17:46:30 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica el ascenso de Trump dentro del partido Republicano ha fomentado desde el inicio el sentimiento anti-immigrante y anti-Latino.
733352800185372673 2016-05-19 17:45:07 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica porque es credulo y estupido y se deja enganar por los republicanos?  solo asi podria un hispano votar por Trump.
733140506088243200 2016-05-18 03:41:32 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica es una encuesta de Fox News, el canal de los Republicanos.
733089182101458944 2016-05-18 00:17:35 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC we'll see on June 7th.  Hillary becomes the presumptive Dem nominee at 8:01 EST, right after NJ is called.  It's MATH.
733088443283214336 2016-05-18 00:14:39 UTC <Vva10967> @NBCNightlyNews @VP @mitchellreports at this point that isn't an IF but a WHEN.  Hillary wins on June 7th at 8:01PM EST, once NJ is called
733031564670607360 2016-05-18 20:28:38 UTC <Vva10967> @MichaelLaRosaDC another distraction to keep the attention off his tax returns.  And of course media will run with it nonstop.
733030719950360576 2016-05-18 20:25:17 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto es puro teatro, a sus seguidores les dice otra cosa.
732983308884291584 2016-05-18 17:16:53 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod I think @SenSanders' brand will suffer if come 6/14 he's 2 to 3MM votes behind & still wants to flip primary vote result @DNC
732794006170677248 2016-05-17 04:44:40 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes On the contrary, Bernie was supposed to win Oregon in a landslide but has underperformed. Margin is in single digits.
732787307779067904 2016-05-17 04:18:03 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica no hay ningun obstaculo para que las personas se inscriban como miembros del partido democrata.  Es gratis inscribirse.
732733009129000960 2016-05-17 00:42:17 UTC <Vva10967> @MichaelLaRosaDC would have been nice if @hardball_chris would have told @clairecmc GOP primary result is from March lol
732731296926052357 2016-05-17 00:35:29 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @ehartman1975 @clairecmc just made the same mistake reading the GOP results!
732704744830062593 2016-05-17 22:49:58 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @davidaxelrod is contradicting himself, said about CA protests that interrupting meetings inside was NOT ok but now NV is ok?
732704220684619776 2016-05-17 22:47:53 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid since you'll have time to kill maybe you can speculate how much money Bernie may have left to burn in California? quite curious
732701937867608064 2016-05-17 22:38:49 UTC <Vva10967> @mmfa because if Bush hadn't destroyed it, Obama would not have had the opportunity to "improve" it?  LOL.
732699599144640512 2016-05-17 22:29:31 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @ehartman1975 that the KY GOP primary occurred March 5?  lol
732684235627241472 2016-05-17 21:28:29 UTC <Vva10967> @AC360 lol so what is in them that he doesn't want the world to see?  is he not as rich as he says he is? is he supporting Dem causes?
732630589640200193 2016-05-17 17:55:18 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid NC could go democratic if people there are fed up with effect of bathroom laws on economy.  May be able to flip governorship 2.
732627129041588225 2016-05-17 17:41:33 UTC <Vva10967> @UniNoticias @HillaryClinton @UniPolitica @MUDDLAW no, tendrian que escoger ser estado.
731714449413947392 2016-05-14 05:14:53 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid his cash on hand at 3/31 was low around $17MM + $26MM=$43MM & he spent heavily in NY & April 26 states Could end up in red
731282001374875649 2016-05-13 00:36:30 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid since U often get attacked by BernieBros when you discuss delegate math, I thought you might enjoy this: http://bit.ly/1Wwh6Er
731270606608605184 2016-05-13 23:51:13 UTC <Vva10967> @MaddowBlog @JoyAnnReid looks like @LindseyGrahamSC is caving in his opposition to Trump http://bit.ly/2262FXB
731191267154100224 2016-05-13 18:35:57 UTC <Vva10967> @bungdan disagree, the media REFUSES to call it what it is, racism & white resentment, & chooses instead to call it "anger & frustration"
731184255880048640 2016-05-13 18:08:06 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas Trump rose to prominence in GOP in 2011 by being a birther & GOP refused to say he was wrong to question POTUS' legitimacy
731183544832233472 2016-05-13 18:05:16 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas it's not like Trump's Build the Wall or Deport All Illegals are unique to him, Rubio & Cruz agreed w/ both ideas.
731183128384024576 2016-05-13 18:03:37 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas bc GOP chose to grow by embracing racists that left Dem Party after LBJ passed 1964 Civil Rights Act & 1965 Voting Rights Act
731181512910110721 2016-05-13 17:57:12 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost @RealBenCarson @mitchellreports right, so can we see his tax returns?  Be they show him donating to Planned Parenthood lol
730816916177223681 2016-05-12 17:48:25 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 also Bernie's downticket fundraising is to run against other Dems, not against Repub.
730806544745500672 2016-05-12 17:07:12 UTC <Vva10967> @Clyburn @mitchellreports actually @BernieSanders still isn't one, he doesn't call HIMSELF a Democrat ever & puts himself ahead of party.
730500373652373507 2016-05-11 20:50:35 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes would love to see the video or audio. Your headline seems misleading & half of story is about police & crime going up.
730179789781389312 2016-05-10 23:36:42 UTC <Vva10967> @PaulBegala why is it that the media always uses the most unflattering and/or angry or witchy photos of HIllary they can find?
730178022750466048 2016-05-10 23:29:41 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid fantasy that Trump'll bring back not just coal mining but labor intensive coal mining is like saying VHS players will  be back
730176393045217280 2016-05-10 23:23:12 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid hasn't Bernie also been playing Hillary's comment from the debate in his ads?  By "we" she clearly meant the market & it's true.
730175896578035712 2016-05-10 23:21:14 UTC <Vva10967> @AditiJuneja3 @JoyAnnReid the media has a really hard time calling Trumpism what it is, racism or white resentment.  They prefer "anger" lol
730097572480729088 2016-05-10 18:10:00 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein so America as a whole is a LOT more racist, xenophobic & misogynist than we thought? The Trump cancer has spread beyond GOP base?
729895974936715264 2016-05-09 04:48:55 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM however the platform isn't binding on the candidate and hardly anyone outside hard core party insiders read it or remember it after
729895206686994432 2016-05-09 04:45:52 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas Ryan is positioning himself to run for POTUS in 2020. He'll likely give in come Thurs so as to not anger the GOP base.
729837033095630853 2016-05-09 00:54:43 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJ her losing WV is not news nor will it have much impact on the pledged delegate tally.  Only Sanders is running ads there.
729797084086452225 2016-05-09 22:15:58 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJ so he's going to issue high interest debt to retire low interest debt?  seriously? bc w his tax plan we get deficits not surpluses
729796791105949696 2016-05-09 22:14:48 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJ aren't you supposed to be the financial experts & shouldn't you be fact checking him? with what money?
729714023634219008 2016-05-09 16:45:55 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 what a delusional LOSER this @HAGOODMANAUTHOR guy is! And he even admits to watching Faux! lol.
729514026020048896 2016-05-08 03:31:12 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid no, he reiterated the wall & the mass deportations on 5/4, the day before his Cinco De Mayo bowl tweet.
729049628654616580 2016-05-07 20:45:51 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid that used to be MSNBC in the Keith days, lol.  Problem is that the POTUS gives interviews to Faux but doesn't to MSNBC.
729040324329385984 2016-05-07 20:08:52 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto es la misma carcel que visito el Papa Francisco o diferente carcel?
729039537675108359 2016-05-07 20:05:45 UTC <Vva10967> @mmfa cnn has a hard time processing what @jonfavs is telling them, THEY seem to admire Trump, lol.
728818783377367040 2016-05-06 05:28:33 UTC <Vva10967> @benchmarkpol @krf7 WV & Guam R pretty irrelevant at this point & we already know that sanders will win WV. HC isn't even buying ads there
728816322877001728 2016-05-06 05:18:46 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs honestly I don't think your average voter noticed. Most people aren't that obsessed to watch every twit.
728814463646846976 2016-05-06 05:11:23 UTC <Vva10967> @POTUS @VP did Sophie Cruz tell you how much she fears that you will deport her parents? Raids separating families continue per news.
728449366696951808 2016-05-05 05:00:37 UTC <Vva10967> @KatieForBern don't kid yourself, the typical Trump voter views Sanders as a socialist/communist, an even greater threat than Hillary.
728448604919107584 2016-05-05 04:57:35 UTC <Vva10967> @Reuters those same people would vote for Trump to stop Bernie too if he were the nominee & w/ even greater force bc he'd be "the socialist"
728446238702460929 2016-05-05 04:48:11 UTC <Vva10967> @deborahamos yes & they continue to give him 24/7 free press & let him get away with nonsense & still won't call him out.
728443690520186880 2016-05-05 04:38:04 UTC <Vva10967> @FiveThirtyEight except that in Hillary's case the hate is from Republicans & Irrational,like their hate for Obama. For Trump he provoked it
728398768387821568 2016-05-05 01:39:34 UTC <Vva10967> @HFA GOP women believe Trump "worked hard & smart to be where he's today & didn't steal it from anyone"- you need ad dispelling that myth
728393754441355264 2016-05-05 01:19:38 UTC <Vva10967> @CNNPolitics @mkraju No, McCain said he'll support but not endorse Trump & if U were real journalists U would force him to clarify differenc
728392393058353153 2016-05-05 01:14:14 UTC <Vva10967> @FrankLuntz Rick Perry should define "capable and experienced" since Palin has said that  she'll be Trump's Secretary of Energy
728378652099022848 2016-05-05 00:19:37 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica dijo POR AHORA, lo que quiere decir que lo hara en unas semanas o talvez en la convencion republicana, es puro teatro politico
728300866869071872 2016-05-05 19:10:32 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas what a LOSER! Capaz le pide que lo contrate a el para construir el muro el mismo.
728298028969381893 2016-05-05 18:59:15 UTC <Vva10967> @MichaelLaRosaDC @MSNBC Dana Bash @CNN on the other hand whines, but we ask him tough questions and he refuses to answer, so unfair...
728295494976442368 2016-05-05 18:49:11 UTC <Vva10967> @flail01 @AlanKestrel750 Grassley sane?  the "Obamacare has death panels and pulls the plug on grandma" guy? lol  Guy needs to be retired.
728278056918487040 2016-05-05 17:39:54 UTC <Vva10967> @Morning_Joe so you think it's a COINCIDENCE that Trump's rise in the GOP started with his 2011 claims that Barack Obama was born in Kenya?
727901817535930373 2016-05-04 16:44:51 UTC <Vva10967> @JohnKasich you know, Disney might sue you for using their Star Wars music in your ad, lol.
727745143210651652 2016-05-03 06:22:17 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Indiana loves guns. That too likely favored Sanders over Hillary & Clinton camp would have known it.
727741535505256448 2016-05-03 06:07:57 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid shouldn't Sanders be running low on cash soon? He outspent her by a lot in ads in the April primaries & cash was $17.5MM at 3/31
727739650836697088 2016-05-03 06:00:28 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Clinton Super PACs said they would not spend on primary after she won NY, turning to general instead
727719818795880448 2016-05-03 04:41:39 UTC <Vva10967> @NettiePearl01 minority & poor are choosing Hillary.  Independents are choosing Bernie.  So affects both.
727716232309440512 2016-05-03 04:27:24 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica solo Mike Lee lo apoyo y el slogan que le pusieron en su mismo partido Republicano fue de We Lose With Cruz (perdemos con Cruz)
727712123418251264 2016-05-03 04:11:05 UTC <Vva10967> @NettiePearl01 those R GOP-enacted changes intended to help Republican candidates & disadvantage ALL Democratic candidates not just Bernie
727656012354879489 2016-05-03 00:28:07 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica porque Trump no lo ha atacado ni le ha puesto apodo todavia
727610084856082432 2016-05-03 21:25:37 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid no, it's just Karma for all the batsh*t crazy stuff the GOP has caused the Obamas to endure over the past 8 years.
727554475364388864 2016-05-03 17:44:38 UTC <Vva10967> @FisherBurton Barack Obama overcame that in 2008 and won, Bernie's revolution failed, attracted thousand but not millions. Facts matter.
727553779722293248 2016-05-03 17:41:53 UTC <Vva10967> @FisherBurton The Dem Party has been center-left since the 1990s & primary vote reflects that- it's not far left & neither is the USA
727552769197006852 2016-05-03 17:37:52 UTC <Vva10967> @FisherBurton and 3.5MM more voters have gone to the booths and said no thanks, we prefer Hillary. #ImWithHer.  Facts matter.
727551640069349380 2016-05-03 17:33:22 UTC <Vva10967> @FisherBurton manipulating supers? you know, people who actually know Hillary LIKE her & the supers that support her have worked w her & do
727549990248259585 2016-05-03 17:26:49 UTC <Vva10967> @RTJackson77 I think you're talking to @FisherBurton- I'm of the opinion that SANDERS should NOT steal the nomination from winner, Hillary.
727548952531341314 2016-05-03 17:22:42 UTC <Vva10967> @FisherBurton so DNC is changing SuperPAC rules too? C'mon, stop making excuses,Obama won vs Hillary w 17.5MM votes & same rules we have now
727547465113702401 2016-05-03 17:16:47 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Barack defeated Hillary w same primary rules we have now & got 17.5MM people to vote for him, Bernie is at 1/2 that, rev failed
727546444308205568 2016-05-03 17:12:44 UTC <Vva10967> @FisherBurton True but if she wins CA & entire primary, Bernie's plan forward is to disregard that fact & steal the nomination at convention
727543947313205248 2016-05-03 17:02:48 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid under Sanders logic we should start having general elections, take a poll after & award presidency to the winner of the poll lol
727543674331127808 2016-05-03 17:01:43 UTC <Vva10967> @BernIn2K16 no he still loses, he's going beyond that, saying he should win bc he polls better than Hillary even if 3.5MM voters prefer her
727365890417803264 2016-05-02 05:15:16 UTC <Vva10967> @Eugene_Robinson it's more likely that he just listened to 12 hours of right wing hate radio to figure out his talking points for GOP base
727174028356648961 2016-05-02 16:32:53 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid under current corporate law shareholder returns trump considerations for well-being of workers &/or communities corps operate in
727172995710636032 2016-05-02 16:28:47 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid it's not just free trade but also quarterly capitalism & notion that corporations' sole duty is to maximize shareholder return.
726474944150933504 2016-04-30 18:14:58 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews @SenJohnMcCain you lost, we elected Obama 2X, get over it.  Remember your concession speech, you were gracious then, not bitter
726275624382418946 2016-04-29 05:02:57 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews not quite, she said Hillary's hawkishness was scarier than Trump's wall but "that doesn't mean that I would vote for Trump".
725911139385643008 2016-04-28 04:54:37 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod @GOP has been putting party ahead of country since @POTUS got elected, no new shift.
725893792855932928 2016-04-28 03:45:41 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Trump is not a great campaigner, he's just exploiting the hate that already exists in GOP base to get their nomination
725891431236276224 2016-04-28 03:36:18 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 so now Jane is pandering to Republicans on Faux??? Is she seriously expecting Faux viewers to embrace socialism? LOL
725729770873491456 2016-04-28 16:53:55 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid sad that the charities he supported won't receive anything to be able to continue their missions.
725728816979652608 2016-04-28 16:50:08 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaCeleste bueno, es por fracking, y los rios en USA corren el mismo riesgo.
725019206903844864 2016-04-26 17:50:23 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid that's similar to 2008 when HC suggested BO be her VP & BO said how could 2nd place person offer VP to person who's in 1st place
725016218890063873 2016-04-26 17:38:31 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid but like she told @maddow she's WINNING & by a lot- the VOTERS have chosen HER ideas over @SenSanders'
724276935895998465 2016-04-24 16:40:52 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @MarioDB pero para q haya una solucion legislativa, Republicanos tienen q perder el control del Congreso ya que siguen diciendo NO.
723971971030069248 2016-04-23 20:29:03 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes how does he plan to keep the homeland safe from attacks like 9/11? what programs would he keep, expand and/or discontinue?
723971467906551808 2016-04-23 20:27:03 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes what would he do w/ NSA surveillance program? toss it?  keep it?  keep some of it?
723971182190534656 2016-04-23 20:25:55 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes what are his views on government whistleblowers?  on Snowden?  would he pardon him?
723970158683889665 2016-04-23 20:21:51 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes will he continue Obama's approach of killing terrorist leaders w/ drones in pre-emptive strikes in Pakistan, Iraq, Yemem etc.?
723889803289305089 2016-04-23 15:02:32 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod in HIllary's case, not being boring & bland are also key, lol.  She isn't a natural politician & needs to generate excitement.
723741725534072832 2016-04-22 05:14:08 UTC <Vva10967> @FiveThirtyEight if Bernie had plan 2 flip Senate & House to Dem his plans wouldn't be DOA & revolution's turning out thousands not millions
723740527569580034 2016-04-22 05:09:22 UTC <Vva10967> @FiveThirtyEight Bernie's running 4 POTUS & not dictator & has no plan 2 achieve his proposals. Ignores House & Senate R GOP controlled
722986355630829568 2016-04-20 03:12:34 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes agreed & he should admit that he hasn't gotten the millions & millions of people that he needed 4 his political revolution
722952620554342400 2016-04-20 00:58:31 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes this isn't the general election, it's a primary where the party's members choose the party's nominee. True of GOP as well.
722638322204569600 2016-04-19 04:09:36 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod you obviously haven't seen what Jeff Weaver told MSNBC about @SenSanders plan to overturn popular vote in Dem primary
722454973859119104 2016-04-19 16:01:02 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod yeah but that's bc @SenSanders hasn't been attacked by the GOP yet while @HillaryClinton has & for 25 years.
722229370367123457 2016-04-18 01:04:34 UTC <Vva10967> @PaulBegala @mattyglesias actually in 2016 we have a 24/7 media that turns every stupid comment made into "news".
722183273506598912 2016-04-18 22:01:24 UTC <Vva10967> Bueno el partido rival no trabaja con nadie pero eso no es culpa de Hillary. Asi fuera el mismo Jesus, los Republicanos le dirian que no
722182796177993728 2016-04-18 21:59:30 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews bueno realmente se discute que tanto poder tiene el Presidente de EEUU y si puede dar el alivio migratorio sin el Congreso
722177115785949185 2016-04-18 21:36:56 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein Hillary is winning the popular vote & pledged delegate count, we don't elect our nominee "by polls", you have to actually VOTE.
721743375444090880 2016-04-17 16:53:24 UTC <Vva10967> @KatyTurNBC I guess he is going with "Lying Ted" because Cruz uses "TrusTed" as own slogan but "Canadian Ted" fits better, just saying.
721505597565313024 2016-04-16 01:08:34 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews sounds like @SenTomCotton isn't fit for office if he is so scared of terrorism. Should worry about US gun shootings instead.
720837841010339842 2016-04-14 04:55:08 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs saying he'll convince superdelegates to steal nomination from Hillary even if she wins popular vote & pledged delegates is worse
720836504973512704 2016-04-14 04:49:49 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid her answer has been that we (USA) cannot force our will on a new sovereign nation & we offered help to Libya & they said NO.
720403425330987008 2016-04-13 00:08:55 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @Lawrence especially at the Democratic Debate tomorrow. @wolfblitzer. Bernie should tell us what happens to the banks' employees
720402799733776384 2016-04-13 00:06:26 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid wow, she managed to find someone WORSE than Scalia!  lol.
720133361092702208 2016-04-12 06:15:47 UTC <Vva10967> @newrepublic @NewRepublic @JoyAnnReid hate to tell you but international news say US names R being released in next couple weeks so this story is bogus
719327452498116608 2016-04-10 00:53:23 UTC <Vva10967> @politico so does Cruz (triggers general election bloodbath for GOP). Another case of the pot calling the kettle black, lol.
719225798830485505 2016-04-10 18:09:27 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews pero jefe de FBI Comey es Republicano y unica razon por K existe tal investigacion es K se trata de Hillary Clinton.
719221873968607232 2016-04-10 17:53:51 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica your translation of English headlines into Spanish leaves much to be desired. Jugar de locales? RU using Google Translator???
719219775453442048 2016-04-10 17:45:31 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod @SenSanders has a hard time admitting mistakes.  He read the WAPO headline & assumed it was true.  His bad.
718926598087581701 2016-04-09 22:20:32 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod so @Pontifex will be away while @SenSanders is there?
718925994355212288 2016-04-09 22:18:08 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @JorgeMarioCab ustedes pierden muchisimo tiempo analizando cada una de las estupideces que se le ocurren a Trump.
718507029359435776 2016-04-08 18:33:19 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 timing is very risky given NY primary.  Spanish news reported trip earlier as a normal event btw.
718495045435973632 2016-04-08 17:45:42 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid the bail & public defender systems R broken 2 & we make it impossible 4 people who leave jail to find jobs & housing & move on
718301145198960641 2016-04-07 04:55:13 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 problem 2 is his revolution isn't turning out the millions of people he says & GOP turnout in WI was 84000+ higher than Dem
718295020453961728 2016-04-07 04:30:52 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid problem is he went by  the wapo headline & like Trump can't admit when he is wrong and/or apologize. Maybe it's a male thing.
718242945837723649 2016-04-07 01:03:57 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes NY hot dogs?  lol
718242238212481025 2016-04-07 01:01:08 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews @BernieSanders @charlierose Actually the @washingtonpost attacked him not @HillaryClinton, THEIR headline said he was unqualified
718148487448293376 2016-04-07 18:48:36 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports @MSNBC apparently not, lol.
718148188612509700 2016-04-07 18:47:25 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 under that criteria, so did President Obama, lol.
717950625422708736 2016-04-06 05:42:22 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 @gdebenedetti w/ the exception of voting for Iraq war all the others apply to Obama 2 so is Obama not qualified either???
717946361082159104 2016-04-06 05:25:25 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports @HillaryClinton so did Pres Obama so according to @SenSanders Obama is not qualified to be POTUS either???
717943307511459841 2016-04-06 05:13:17 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein according to @SenSanders criteria Barack Obama was not "qualified" to be POTUS in 2012 since he too had a super PAC
717775875597578240 2016-04-06 18:07:59 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid but effects of not voting in 2010 midterm will last until at least 2021 due to GOP governorship gains & resulting gerrymandering
717564502355656704 2016-04-05 04:08:03 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @MSNBC @hardball_chris Ann Coulter, really? & Michele Bachmann the other day? & now Hugh Hewitt too?  who picks these people?
717561711667126272 2016-04-05 03:56:58 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid too late, had to turn off @MSNBC @maddow after seeing Hugh Hewitt there, as if having Ann Coulter earlier wasn't bad enough! YUK
717146715187494913 2016-04-04 00:27:55 UTC <Vva10967> @AC360 thought you all were going to stop giving Trump free press???
716648462058668032 2016-04-03 15:28:02 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @AdryanaBoyne No le mandaron el memo avisando q NO debia mencionar resultados logicos d politicas republicanas q asusten al publico
716645088185749509 2016-04-03 15:14:38 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto pero lo que dijo Trump es el resultado LOGICO de hacer el aborto ilegal.  En El Salvador mujeres son encarceladas por abortar.
716331136159453184 2016-04-02 18:27:06 UTC <Vva10967> @CoryBooker TY. I support labeling too & the right of consumers to decide. If others want to eat GMOs, hey, it's a free country- I don't.
716329879999004672 2016-04-02 18:22:06 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews pero ese odio no lo creo Trump, sino que viene siendo fomentado por el mismo partido republicano desde la eleccion de Obama
716032124596436992 2016-04-01 22:38:56 UTC <Vva10967> @luckybastard77 @JoyAnnReid Sherrod is a nice guy but BORING & Hillary needs someone who can ignite folks at rallies & on campaign trail
716031131540393984 2016-04-01 22:34:59 UTC <Vva10967> @CyEdmunds @JoyAnnReid  maybe she should offer Bernie USTR so he can negotiate fair trade agreements & monitor fairness of current ones, lol
716029934800646144 2016-04-01 22:30:14 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid I think Hillary will go for Julian Castro who is young and Latino & would be able to run for POTUS in 2024.
716029128047271936 2016-04-01 22:27:01 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Obama didn't choose Hillary for his VP either yet she put party first & not just endorsed Obama but nominated him to unite party
715939733063516161 2016-04-01 16:31:48 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein looks like NYS will pass $15 minimum too but w faster implementation in NYC: http://on.ny.gov/1PIHPEZ
715760382141460485 2016-03-31 04:39:07 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes no surprise there @Residente loves all the socialist regimes in Latin America & raps about social injustice all the time
715398735631491073 2016-03-30 04:42:04 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid too bad #maddow didn't ask him about his campaign's letter vilifying @HillaryClinton for doing just that w Clooney event.
715396405058113537 2016-03-30 04:32:49 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid and then they criticize @HillaryClinton for fundraising for the Democratic Party & down ticket candidates w George Clooney event
713231959921700864 2016-03-24 05:12:05 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @SidSeven777 nah Palin already said that she wants to be sec of energy lol so about those centrifuges & enriched uranium...
713077147951370240 2016-03-24 18:56:55 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews sorry but @FortuneMagazine is messed up! How are you a world's greatest leader? & they put Bezos as #1 & left Obama out???
713072942796697601 2016-03-24 18:40:12 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews lol Hannity's business model is to make white americans hate everybody else, that is how he makes his millions $$$
712420993113989121 2016-03-22 23:29:35 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica No, el ataque fue en Brussels y no en USA.  Que va a hacer en la Casa Blanca que no pueda hacer desde Air Force One?  Nada.
712420432998178816 2016-03-22 23:27:22 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC one can only hope that the voters will finally retire him from office, he's been sooooo bitter since he lost to Obama.
711586694257049601 2016-03-20 16:14:23 UTC <Vva10967> @POTUS why not seek injunctive relief from SCOTUS to force Senate to hold hearings & vote on #SCOTUSnominee as req'd by US Constitution?
711586025102036992 2016-03-20 16:11:43 UTC <Vva10967> @NinaTotenberg why can't @POTUS seek injunctive relief from SCOTUS to force Senate to hold hearings & vote on #SCOTUSnominee per US Constit?
711406896171847680 2016-03-19 04:19:56 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes mmmm could it be that the media covers everything he does as "news" 24/7 and for free???
709981346903552001 2016-03-15 05:55:18 UTC <Vva10967> @tamarakeithNPR @BernieSanders makes @HillaryClinton a better candidate w issues & debates & keeps media attention on dem platform #all good
709979597643890688 2016-03-15 05:48:21 UTC <Vva10967> @OnsightIT @JoyAnnReid a managing director is a title for investment bankers. Heidi Cruz is NOT on the Goldman Sachs board of directors.
709949414958301184 2016-03-15 03:48:25 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid plus the IRS elimination that Cruz' major donor Robert Mercer needs since he owes $6 BILLION in taxes.
709948797745496065 2016-03-15 03:45:58 UTC <Vva10967> @ariannahuff well the "abolish the IRS" has to do with the $6 billion in taxes that are owed by Cruz' major donor Robert Mercer
709943612436570112 2016-03-15 03:25:21 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid no she isn't.  Her title at GS was probably "Managing Director" which is an investment banker title.  http://bit.ly/1b0u9J8
709855927889952769 2016-03-15 21:36:56 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Dems should leave the GOP alone & concentrate in their own election.  Both Trump & Cruz R awful so what difference does it make
709818848430714881 2016-03-15 19:09:35 UTC <Vva10967> @KatyTurNBC actually Mitch says to Trump that "it might be a good idea to", lol.
709793061686145024 2016-03-15 17:27:07 UTC <Vva10967> @MaddowBlog would love to see a special report on whether USA can renegotiate or even repudiate trade agreements +/or impose import tariffs
709792226633715712 2016-03-15 17:23:48 UTC <Vva10967> @CronicasSabado por que no hacen programa analizando si USA puede o no repudiar tratados de libre comercio e imponer tarifas de importacion?
709492546217578496 2016-03-14 21:32:59 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto tiene gracia, como si a Ryan o a los demas Republicanos les importaran los immigrantes y/o los indocumentados.
708889940998889472 2016-03-12 05:38:27 UTC <Vva10967> @brakktonbooker @NPR @marcorubio seems "streak" consists of winning places that have no electoral votes in the general election lol
708004534119960576 2016-03-10 19:00:09 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein Hillary expected @jorgeramosnews to ask seriuos questions & not start attacking her with 100% FoxNews propaganda
708002174954049537 2016-03-10 18:50:47 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports you used to be a serious journalist, what happened to you?  Obama's only contribution to the rise of Trump is being black
708000267845894144 2016-03-10 18:43:12 UTC <Vva10967> @CrystalClarityy @jorgeramosnews bc HC is a lawyer & knows POTUS must enforce the law & that Bernie would say yes bc he makes empty promises
707997363776983041 2016-03-10 18:31:40 UTC <Vva10967> @spicetc @jorgeramosnews oh please! Jorge was being rude & both decided to go along, the law is the law & the POTUS has to enforce it
707995347331751936 2016-03-10 18:23:39 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews and it's meaningless, the POTUS has to uphold the law and if someone has an order of deportation he/she will get deported
707994364744744960 2016-03-10 18:19:45 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews very disappointed in you, felt like I was watching a Faux News debate where you expect unsubstantiated smears against HC
707686255367229440 2016-03-09 21:55:26 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Rubio has no accomplishments, doesn't show up for his Senate work, can't think on his feet, why would anybody want him as VP?
707636111544360961 2016-03-09 18:36:10 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump should go w/ Outsourcer-in-chief- outsourcing POTUS job to Canadian -no American job is safe from Carly, lol.
707625012669386752 2016-03-09 17:52:04 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein claims that Obama is muslim, was born in Kenya, is illegitimate POTUS, etc fuel Trump base as much as Obamacare #SouthernStrategy
707624183732314113 2016-03-09 17:48:47 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein it wasn't just GOP's response to Obamacare but GOP's response to the black presidency of which response to Obamacare was a part
707619542051241984 2016-03-09 17:30:20 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC Cheney made fracking exempt from Clean Air Act & Clean Water Act;exemption should be revoked to save our water; can't drink oil
707615812933328897 2016-03-09 17:15:31 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews hope you look into the effect of right wing radio in your HBO Special.
707059267539443712 2016-03-07 04:24:00 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid did anyone tell Rubio that FL is a closed primary and that MSNBC viewers are highly unlikely to be Republicans? too funny!
706973585097756672 2016-03-07 22:43:32 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid when you are white you don't know what it's like to be poor?  I'm pretty sure that southern whites would disagree with him...
706930993949712387 2016-03-07 19:54:17 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @taddevine I don't see NY being in play.  Hillary was a very effective Senator for NY and we came to see her as a fellow NYer.
706358866896949248 2016-03-05 06:00:52 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @JorgeGCastaneda eso seria entrar en el circo de Trump y darle aun mas cobetura gratis en los medios y prensa
705654349343555585 2016-03-03 07:21:21 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto la contaminacion de Flint la causo el governador Republicano de Michigan al cambiar la fuente de agua para ahorrar dinero
705646113873743873 2016-03-03 06:48:38 UTC <Vva10967> @BillKristol @davidaxelrod Rubio probably didn't rehearse that Q&A and he can't think on his feet if his life depended on it lol
705496643077083136 2016-03-03 20:54:41 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports @janeosanders @BernieSanders @HillaryClinton good for them, last thing we want is to make Dem debates trashy like GOP's
705476692098338818 2016-03-03 19:35:25 UTC <Vva10967> @AristeguiOnline Tanto @marcorubio como @realDonaldTrump quieren deportar a los 11 millones de indocumentados si ganan, incluyendo Dreamers
705472174883250177 2016-03-03 19:17:28 UTC <Vva10967> @UniNoticias Reforma migratoria, historia de un sueo detenido en el Congreso POR LOS REPUBLICANOS y DAPA detenida por GOP en cortes tambien
705470444825153536 2016-03-03 19:10:35 UTC <Vva10967> @njdotcom @GovChristie so he's just pretending to be one? lol
705469041931116544 2016-03-03 19:05:01 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod well Republicans like the "telling it like it is" approach, lol.
705103840568287232 2016-03-02 18:53:50 UTC <Vva10967> @HMFL85 @JoyAnnReid perhaps but GOP stopped contesting ideas on Jan 20 2009 & instead became party of No & are now reaping what they sowed
704545585207050240 2016-02-29 05:55:31 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid but in all fairness SHE was the senator from NY & got to see all the 9/11 destruction first hand for months to come
704035034982965249 2016-02-28 20:06:47 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 you mean voting eligible in that particular state, correct? can't imagine that NH would have 9.7% of the US voting-eligible
703469966343987200 2016-02-26 06:41:24 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews si Trump no puede ganar sin el voto Latino para que quieres que @EPN le responda y se meta en el circo Republicano?
703117234571386880 2016-02-25 07:19:46 UTC <Vva10967> @KatyTurNBC @NBCNews does he then drop out if he loses to Trump?  Lol
703115980617052161 2016-02-25 07:14:47 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews el de Cruz dijo es deportar a todos los ilegales y no permitirles volver mas si tienen hijos nacidos en USA #Decision2016
703113099864182784 2016-02-25 07:03:20 UTC <Vva10967> @ArturoNALEO even though @RealBenCarson said he gave @NALEO same canned speech he gives everyone else & didn't prepare anything special 4 u?
703110568148803584 2016-02-25 06:53:17 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews he won't deport them but will never let them become US citizens & vote thus keeping them as 2nd class citizens 4 ever.
703109086661910528 2016-02-25 06:47:24 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @CNN wait until you get to Maria Celeste's immigration question to Trump -it was like watching an sln sketch lol
702398793069760512 2016-02-23 07:44:56 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews @FusionNews Cruz has consistently said that he would deport all illegals even the dreamers that are protected now by DACA
702398025075924992 2016-02-23 07:41:53 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews por que excluyes a Rubio? El ya dijo que eliminara DACA el primer dia si llega a ser presidente
702391182974914560 2016-02-23 07:14:42 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @cleotiger17 @sahilkapur those who are Latino & still republican don't care about GOP's stand on immigration
701653380868009985 2016-02-21 06:22:56 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas @jorgeramosnews @jdbalart Marco Rubio now says that if elected POTUS he'll end DACA on day 1https://twitter.com/HuffingtonPost/status/701283834604744704
701643017049010176 2016-02-21 05:41:45 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJ the Mexican guy has no funding and no helpers, is doing all on his own.  Hope you don't think that was the case with Michaelangelo...
701641592013242368 2016-02-21 05:36:06 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod 2 cuban americans who show zero compassion for immigrants and are competing for which one can deport all the dreamers faster
701505234590375940 2016-02-21 20:34:15 UTC <Vva10967> Sad when Trump is the lesser of 2 evils:  Why I'm more worried about Marco Rubio than Donald Trump http://www.vox.com/2016/2/20/11067932/rubio-worse-than-trump?utm_campaign=vox&utm_content=article%3Atop&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter via @voxdotcom
701277247030874112 2016-02-20 05:28:19 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas la realidad es que su hermano dejo el pais en colapso economico, invadio el pais equivocado e ignoro memo sobre ataque d 9/11
701252426377072640 2016-02-20 03:49:41 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports when do you think that Ben Carson will drop out?  i.e. how much money does he have left?
699450861840420864 2016-02-15 04:30:55 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid was SC spared when the economy melted in September 2008?  How can he be popular there, or anywhere really?
698976202200117249 2016-02-14 21:04:47 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews look into right wing radio & their message of hate & you will understand why the GOP base hates Latinos so much
698975222658162690 2016-02-14 21:00:54 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews they have done more than turn their backs on hispanics, they want to cancel DACA & DAPA & deport all 11 million immigrants
698772608691601408 2016-02-13 07:35:47 UTC <Vva10967> @CNNPolitics do your homework! Justice Kennedy was confirmed in 1988 which was an election year by unanimous vote of Senate. Total BS
698762658531643392 2016-02-13 06:56:14 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews Al Gore hubiera leido el memo de la CIA q decia que Bin Laden nos iba a atacar y no hubiese invadido el pais equivocado, Iraq
698753823159033856 2016-02-13 06:21:08 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid both are traitors and latinos hold grudges, so no way.  GOP thinks Spanish surname is enough and are mistaken.
698750111577436160 2016-02-13 06:06:23 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC Trump wanted to take down W before W got to SC on Monday.  Seems to me that he did very well
698748731756322816 2016-02-13 06:00:54 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews El titulo de peor presidente pertenece a Bush q permitio el ataque de 9/11, invadio el pais equivocado y destruyo la economia
698747245693427714 2016-02-13 05:55:00 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews cierto @marcorubio porque Reagan creia en la amnistia y vos no.  Otra frase memorizada de robot.  #marcobot
698735618357125125 2016-02-13 05:08:47 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod so @tedcruz was talking about himself again? lol
698734617424220160 2016-02-13 05:04:49 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid But Cruz got called by moderator on his lie that no justice had been confirmed in election year when Justice Kennedy was in 1988
698683641405247489 2016-02-13 01:42:15 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid enraging the Left in an election yr would b bad 4 voter turnout. Better to nominate a liberal & make it about taking Senate back
698679694720442368 2016-02-13 01:26:34 UTC <Vva10967> @Aidansheart @SenateMajLdr Approve or Disapprove, not wait until we elect a new POTUS and deny the current POTUS the nomination.
698673570512293889 2016-02-13 01:02:14 UTC <Vva10967> @SenateMajLdr Mitch, WE, the American people, elected President Obama to fill all SCOTUS vacancies until he leaves office, remember?#Scalia
697871097954508801 2016-02-11 19:53:30 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJ whatever happened to the national debt being too large and needing to reduce it?  thought that was a Conservative Principle?
697464515806375936 2016-02-10 16:57:53 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto los Republicanos vienen fomentando odio hacia extranjeros y minorias desde que Obama gano en 2008 y ahora cosechan lo q sembraron
697285229820641280 2016-02-09 05:05:28 UTC <Vva10967> @eldiariony pero la reforma migratoria que ofrece Kasich NO incluye un camino a la ciudadania
696413180919209984 2016-02-07 19:20:15 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @FreddyBalsera 100% de acuerdo @marcorubio y @tedcruz son los Clarence Thomas de los Latinos.Suben por ser Latinos y meten cuchillo
696411120987459584 2016-02-07 19:12:04 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @adolfofrancoGOP El primer Presidente Latino de USA sera Julian Castro @SecretaryCastro en 2024.  Tener nombre Latino NO es enough.
696409369861345282 2016-02-07 19:05:07 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @adolfofrancoGOP Mas bien en Nov 2016 GOP repetira su analisis post-funeral preguntandose de nuevo porque perdieron la Casa Blanca
696407456579252224 2016-02-07 18:57:30 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @ottoreich talvez pero no es falso decir que Cruz, Rubio y Trump estan en contra y q la base Republicana los apoya y les aplaude
696405535411826689 2016-02-07 18:49:52 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto deberian explicarle al senor que a partir de Citizens United se necesita entre 1 y 2 BILLONES de dolares para ser Presidente de USA
696405015964033024 2016-02-07 18:47:49 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto parace que nadie le dijo al senor que ser Presidente en USA cuesta entre 1 y 2 BILLONES de dolares a causa de Citizens United
696404239636107268 2016-02-07 18:44:43 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @adolfofrancoGOP @ottoreich Dios no lo permita.  Eso es como haber nominado a Clarence Thomas a SCOTUS por ser afro americano.
696401971935322112 2016-02-07 18:35:43 UTC <Vva10967> @mariaramirezNY a los ninos les gustan los robots, lol, que pena q sus padres tengan el intelecto de un nino y no de adultos
696394892554170368 2016-02-07 18:07:35 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews a Rubio solo le interesa su futuro politico y si para alcanzarlo tiene que darle una patada a los hispanos, lo hace.
696236537059663873 2016-02-06 07:38:20 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas because according to Republicans Pres Obama should be deporting ALL 11 million undocumented just like they plan to do
696152389364097024 2016-02-06 02:03:58 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas @johnizonline Opportunism of course  Rubio will say & do anything to win GOP base and that will not change, even betrayed Jeb
696151043403595776 2016-02-06 01:58:37 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas and the reason the Immigration Reform didn't pass is because GOP refused to put it up for a vote!  Rubio lies.
696150650976104448 2016-02-06 01:57:03 UTC <Vva10967> @pewresearch @falconalina except for the Republicans who see immigration as a burden, and use it as a scapegoat
696149359461855232 2016-02-06 01:51:55 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews but Kasich would keep the 11MM as 2nd class citizens with no path to citizenship
695774425178836992 2016-02-05 01:02:04 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid that's no different than assuming women would vote for Palin because she was a woman.  Rubio and Cruz R Latinos' Clarence Thomas
695767333286113280 2016-02-05 00:33:53 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports wouldn't your husband have received similar fees for his speeches after he left office? Why demonize @HillaryClinton 4 it?
695766170276904960 2016-02-05 00:29:16 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @tedcruz @marcorubio ambos son unos traidores; es como haber escogido a Clarence Thomas como representante de Afr Amer en SCOTUS
695493709064962048 2016-02-04 06:26:36 UTC <Vva10967> @carl_chirinos @UniPolitica @HillaryClinton @BernieSanders Seamos francos si el hubiese sido el Senador de NY el tambien habria votado asi
695492427088527360 2016-02-04 06:21:30 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica @BernieSanders @HillaryClinton No porque los Republicanos gastarian billones en ads asustando a la gente sobre su socialismo
695491487472209920 2016-02-04 06:17:46 UTC <Vva10967> @carl_chirinos @UniPolitica @HillaryClinton porque los Republicanos inventan rumores de investigaciones falsas y la gente se los cree
693870840748843008 2016-01-31 18:57:54 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews @marcorubio como van a comparar a Rubio con JFK? JFK defendia a los pobres y a las minorias y Rubio les da una patada
693870434178199552 2016-01-31 18:56:17 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews @marcorubio miente- SI habian suficientes votos a favor de reforma migratoria y republicanos la bloquearon en el Congreso
693867792345534468 2016-01-31 18:45:47 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews @marcorubio es un mentiroso, a su base le dice que la legalizacion es amnistia y que el nunca apoyaria una amnistia.
692952516670144513 2016-01-28 06:08:49 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes you are kidding right? Report REAL news when you all can continue reporting on Trump's latest tantrum 24/7? Not gonna happen
692594406378082304 2016-01-27 06:25:48 UTC <Vva10967> @TheLastWord who cares but he sure has gotten tons of free coverage from the media for his tantrum You all treat everything he does as news
690217703714480128 2016-01-21 17:01:38 UTC <Vva10967> @jack any chance you could add a bookmark icon? I use the heart icon as a substitute even if I don't love a tweet, just to find it again.
970737426544103424 2018-03-05 19:06:52 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveSchmidtSES What if Trump is taking his marching orders from Putin?  Putin would LOVE to destroy the US economy.  #PutinsPuppet
970734112310022144 2018-03-05 18:53:42 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN Can somebody ask Bibi if he thinks he'll be indicted in Israel for corruption as the Israeli police recommended?  And can someone ask Trump if Putin told him to nix Romney as SOS and choose Tillerson instead? That should spark things.  
970731010051727360 2018-03-05 18:41:22 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid She sounds mentally unstable, like someone who should be barred from having a gun. 
970573860155416577 2018-03-05 08:16:55 UTC <Vva10967> @RVAwonk The pharma price scheme is so insane that it is possible for the uninsured GoodRx discounted price to be lower than the price you would pay WITH insurance.
970573163447967744 2018-03-05 08:14:09 UTC <Vva10967> @RVAwonk GoodRx has an app for your smartphone and you can see with the app if their program (which is free) will save you money. It works with coupons which get you their negotiated rate. And the app shows you the prices that pharmacies near you charge for the same med.
970445347247058945 2018-03-04 23:46:15 UTC <Vva10967> @jonathanvswan @PhilipRucker Damn, I was hoping Rudy Giuliani was trending because he was being indicted in the Mueller investigation.  #LockHimUp #RudyForPrison
970353240100556800 2018-03-04 17:40:15 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Says the guy who used Chinese steel for his buildings as American steel factories in the rust belt states were closing down... #GreedyTrump #DonTheCon #PutinsPuppet
970172313349050368 2018-03-03 05:41:19 UTC <Vva10967> @NastyCatWoman1 @NickMerrill Hes projecting on @HillaryClinton as usual. Hes the one who is terribly unhappy with his life.
970169319429738496 2018-03-03 05:29:25 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @HesalroadDawn @tedlieu Donald Trump CANT read. #TriggerTrumpIn4Words
970167889826369537 2018-03-03 05:23:44 UTC <Vva10967> @darlenewaters @BillKristol @realDonaldTrump always projects on Hillary what is true about himself. When he said she was crooked, HE was crooked. When he accused the Clinton Foundation of wrongdoing, HIS Trump Foundation was engaged in wrongdoing. Now HE is unhappy and says that she is.
970102002989576192 2018-03-03 01:01:55 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Hey Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ohio, it looks like you are REALLY going to regret your vote for Trump!  Looks like he is going to kill the auto industry that Barack Obama saved in 2009.  But why should that surprise us? He's bent on undoing EVERYTHING Obama accomplished.
970083344074539009 2018-03-03 23:47:47 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro It's a REPUBLICAN-CAUSED problem Ana. It will only be resolved by VOTING EVERY REPUBLICAN OUT of office in 2018. When Sandy Hook happened in 2012 and the GOP refused to do anything about it, we should all have understood that the GOP had no soul left. #BlueWave2018 #ChangeParties
970081828072771586 2018-03-03 23:41:45 UTC <Vva10967> @DonaldJTrumpJr You should google Bill and Hillary Clinton.  The attacks on THEM were unparalleled and still are.  The attacks on your dad have been brought on by his own hateful rhetoric and actions. And who the f*ck is Mark Levin and why would anyone care what the f*ck he has to say???
970071560865439744 2018-03-03 23:00:57 UTC <Vva10967> @PaulBegala @DevinNunes Americans who are unhappy with the economy vote Republican. They need to start voting Democratic if they want their lives to improve. Wait and see how rural America fares after Trump is done screwing  our trade agreements. It will be a disaster.

969802164104286208 2018-03-02 05:10:28 UTC <Vva10967> @tribelaw So who enforces it? DOJ?  This DOJ?
969759186509758465 2018-03-02 02:19:41 UTC <Vva10967> @NatashaBertrand McCabe and the @FBI are visited by Karma.
969708229306576896 2018-03-02 22:57:12 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines He does the same thing to Barron. Lets him and Melania get wet while HE carries a huge umbrella which he uses to keep HIMSELF dry.
969707683866701830 2018-03-02 22:55:02 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines @ibhaber Youre offending pigs with that comparison 
969707541692284928 2018-03-02 22:54:28 UTC <Vva10967> @ABCPolitics @PhilippeReines @TxsDem Nah. He was that way too when they arrived at the White House on Inauguration Day. He just walked up to greet the Obamas and left her behind.  She had to get out of the car by herself and catch up.
969706256222052352 2018-03-02 22:49:22 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines @callipygia1 I had the same reaction but its not Krogers that sells them but a chain owned by Krogers.
969705974637432834 2018-03-02 22:48:15 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines @etcpolitics I have. There were no guns in mine. I dont recall seeing them in their catalog either but then again I wouldnt be looking for one. Must be a red state thing.
969442494340567041 2018-03-01 05:21:16 UTC <Vva10967> @GOP @DNC @swingleft @DianEngelman @Criscoluv You still sound like a Russian bot. 
969416883719081984 2018-03-01 03:39:30 UTC <Vva10967> @GOP @DNC @swingleft @DianEngelman @Criscoluv He certainly is. From Moscow with love. Or more like it, from St Petersburg with love, since thats where the Agency is located, not Moscow. 
969293522296860673 2018-03-01 19:29:18 UTC <Vva10967> @EricLiptonNYT Comrade Putin? Or the famous John Barron of NYC? 
969084250292211714 2018-02-28 05:37:44 UTC <Vva10967> @PoliticsProse @LannyDavis Hope it was taped. Would love to see it on the Politics and Prose You Tube channel. 
969073198842163205 2018-02-28 04:53:49 UTC <Vva10967> @PhillyComptonMW @SusanBordo Theyre also ignoring the @LannyDavis book on the Comey effect because, like yours, it contradicts the she lost because she was a flawed candidate and didnt have any message narrative. They love Shattered because its narrative absolves them.
969067161254858753 2018-02-28 04:29:50 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh Its Karma. They all backed Trump knowing what a POS he was and how temperamentally, morally and mentally UNFIT he was.
968959895428100096 2018-02-28 21:23:36 UTC <Vva10967> @Acosta @k_brinst Remember that clock the press used to put up when it was obsessed about @HillaryClinton not holding more frequent press conferences? Seems they lost it or dont have the guts to harass him the way the harassed her. #sexism #misogyny
968946469876137984 2018-02-28 20:30:15 UTC <Vva10967> @marcorubio Its a shame that voters didnt kick you out in 2016 when they had the chance to get rid of you Little Marco! The only thing you stand for are your donors, including the NRA. You even bowed to Trump after telling us how dangerous he was. #NeverAgain
968724935744028672 2018-02-27 05:49:57 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko With the exception of @AprilDRyan, the rest of them deserve it. They built Trump & were total a-holes to @HillaryClinton.  Always saying she wasnt likable or trustworthy & always assuming the worst about her. Gave a total free pass to DonTheCon & his swamp. #Karma
968706139788644352 2018-02-27 04:35:16 UTC <Vva10967> @tribelaw The Republicans in the House wont impeach him. For them its Party over Country. Once Dems take over after the 2018 midterm they have to weaken Trump through hearings and then impeach. Or Mueller could find out that Trump and Pence conspired with Russia against the United States
968601671856205831 2018-02-27 21:40:08 UTC <Vva10967> @Acosta Only path forward is to vote out of office EVERY Republican in November 2018. #BlueWave
968572519564312578 2018-02-27 19:44:18 UTC <Vva10967> @kyledcheney it's without prejudice, so if he doesn't fulfill his part of the bargain, the charges can be brought back again.
968565971697979393 2018-02-27 19:18:17 UTC <Vva10967> @Ange_Amene @JZam411 All that is in Monica's book? If so I'll actually buy it and photograph the paragraphs. Her Vanity Fair article is total BS.
968562445844443136 2018-02-27 19:04:16 UTC <Vva10967> SPECIAL ELECTIONS TODAY!!!

968541170782605318 2018-02-27 17:39:44 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Ken Starr would have been all over Bill Clinton for obstruction of justice if Bill had fired FBI Director Louis Freeh and/or if Bill had asked Freeh to pledge loyalty to him when he hired him.
968540211490820096 2018-02-27 17:35:55 UTC <Vva10967> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Because Mueller has not presented the obstruction case yet.  And has not added your pals to the conspiracy against the United States case yet.  But it's coming.... and you know it.
968539699190157312 2018-02-27 17:33:53 UTC <Vva10967> @marthamaccallum @judgenapolitano @realDonaldTrump Napolitano is an ENTERTAINER. A bad entertainer, but an entertainer nonetheless. Fox News is ENTERTAINMENT, NOT real news.  That's why Fox is allowed to LIE, because the FCC mistakenly assumes that its idiot audience KNOWS it's entertainment.

968359550649847810 2018-02-26 05:38:02 UTC <Vva10967> @McFaul And the AFT (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) CANNOT use computers or searchable databases, including excel spreadsheets, to do background checks. They have to pretend we're all living in the 1980s and use microfiche and paper records.
968339594835046400 2018-02-26 04:18:44 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill Cadet Bone Spurs to the rescue!!! 
968337277045919744 2018-02-26 04:09:32 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines @RustyPatti @marconi_donna He voted No on both.

968015225978064896 2018-02-25 06:49:49 UTC <Vva10967> @CNNPolitics If Hillary had sent Chelsea to practice Diplomacy with the South Koreans you would all be calling it what it is: NEPOTISM and questioning why shes there when she isnt a diplomat and her only qualification is being the daughter of the POTUS.
968013097347768320 2018-02-25 06:41:21 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidKlion @davidslavick Yes you can tell how much those excusing Monika hate Hillary when they are rewriting history to excuse the mistress and pervert the MeToo movement, even though there is a transcript put out by Ken Starr to humiliate Bill Clinton detailing what and how it actually happened.
968009838667198464 2018-02-25 06:28:24 UTC <Vva10967> @MonicaLewinsky @DavidKlion @NanInKansas @Ramona2uimby Youre rewriting history as is she. She was 22 yo, had a crush on Bill Clinton, brought him pizza during a government shutdown, she lifted  her own skirt and proceeded to give him a blow job.  Thats NOT workplace sexual harassment.
968007456365441024 2018-02-25 06:18:56 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidKlion If thats the new standard then every old geezer who has had a consenting sexual relation with a woman over the age of 21 but who is 20 years his junior is now a sexual predator. Thats perverting #MeToo. @VanityFair @Monikalewinsky
968005418625757184 2018-02-25 06:10:51 UTC <Vva10967> @MonicaLewinsky @AlyssaMastro44 Except that we can all read the details of what happened & how it happened because Ken Starr made it public and shes the one who lifts her skirt after bringing Bill a pizza during a government shutdown so to compare her relationship with Bill to a MeToo abuse is just wrong.
967996805123379201 2018-02-25 05:36:37 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert The narrative is correct. A Republican Congress will not do anything on gun control and neither will a Republican State Legislature or a Republican Governor.  Which is why the GOP MUST ALL BE VOTED OUT in November 2018. #NeverAgain

Or not get paid because shes a woman? Bc those were 3 out of more than 100 speeches she gave & she got paid 6 figures for most of them. & only reason everyone knows that is that unlike Bernie & Trump SHE released her taxes

Bernie would always end his speeches reminding his audience that they would have to hold @HillaryClinton to her promises once she was elected POTUS, reinforcing the idea that she wasnt being honest when she said she backed the Dem platform.

967450873331843072 2018-02-24 17:27:17 UTC <Vva10967> @joshledermanAP @AP_Politics I think Jared Kushner should be named US ambassador to Israel once the new embassy opens. 
967449924961996800 2018-02-24 17:23:31 UTC <Vva10967> @KFILE Maybe it will force the members to elect new leaders who actually reflect the gun owners  views instead of the gun manufacturers views. Although its possible that the nomination process of the NRA prevents that. Some orgs have bylaws that entrench the power of the insiders.

Michael Steele caricatured and demonized @NancyPelosi in 2010 to win his racist Party the US House of Representatives. He KNEW that the GOP chose him to bring down Obama because it wouldnt look as racist if a black guy did it. And he agreed to do it.
967287111463424000 2018-02-23 06:36:33 UTC <Vva10967> @HesalroadDawn @chrislhayes I bet the dirt on Hillary Clinton was the DNC emails and the quid pro quo was the changing of the RNC platform. Manafort delivered, so Putin delivered.

966901740745367553 2018-02-22 05:05:13 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines I still find it too coincidental that Bernie adopted his rigged election narrative right around the time that the DNC emails were hacked (and thus, in Putins possession) and Putin needed a narrative to weaponize them, which Bernie conveniently provided. 
966898593582891010 2018-02-22 04:52:43 UTC <Vva10967> @IsaacDovere @MattAsherS @Evan_McMullin @harrypujols @SuzanneCEvans @LivesKuato @daralebrun And Stein sat at Putins table. No head of state did. Why?

Apparently NOTHING about civics because you clearly have no Fing clue what the Speaker of the House does! Google it. Maybe youll then learn to appreciate how talented Pelosi is and why Republicans keep trying to bring her down.
966574425880580096 2018-02-21 07:24:35 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill And in April and May 2016 Putin had the hacked DNC emails. He needed a narrative to weaponize them. He got one from Bernie who began peddling the nonsense that the primary was rigged. Coincidence or collusion?

965823869138370561 2018-02-19 05:42:09 UTC <Vva10967> @TomPerez @Stedeg90 Actually @HillaryClinton kicked his ass in the WA primary where most Washington voters participated. Caucuses are undemocratic because most people work and/or have families and dont have 3 hours to spend at a caucus. @SenSanders likes them because he cant win primaries.
965821605481009152 2018-02-19 05:33:09 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump is an illegitimate President. He knows it. We know it. #confess #TrumpColluded

And he can because he is an insane idiot and the Republicans in Congress are complicit with him and refuse to stop him. He can nuke a country, start a nuclear armageddon and bankrupt the country, which is really all he knows how to do
965680073155149824 2018-02-19 20:10:45 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill Why wont @HillaryClinton sue him? Seems thats the only language Trumpers understand.

We have the 2012 results from Gary Johnson and Jill Stein to measure the effect that Putin's sabotage & Bernie's slanders had. Putin couldn't have succeeded without Bernie's bizarre "election is rigged" claims which is what Putin needed & used to weaponize DNC emails.
965282621264670721 2018-02-18 17:51:25 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro @wlft1 @ValleyQuercus @AmyLaurenSomers And Trump registered his Make America Great Again trademark on November 19, 2012 so his claim that he hadn't announced that he was running in 2014 so how would Russia know is a LIE, like everything else that comes out of his mouth.
965281158983495681 2018-02-18 17:45:37 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro @wlft1 Examining the voting machines in the MI WI & PA districts that inexplicably went for Trump and in Southern FL would be a start. DHS has said in Congressional Testimony that they did NOT examine any voting machine to arrive at their assessment that votes weren't changed.
965280310874210304 2018-02-18 17:42:14 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro I wouldn't be shocked if Bernie's campaign were too. He came up with the "election is rigged" nonsense right after the DNC emails were hacked and were in Putin's possession, which is precisely the narrative that Putin needed (and used) to weaponize them.
965279150088114177 2018-02-18 17:37:38 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein @davidaxelrod @GrinsvenMatthew @RobinHoodReport @Statistar30 @bex0760 @erroltonysoma @monad1010 True, that's because of self-entitled pricks like you who keep getting Republicans elected by sabotaging the only party that can beat them.
965278459630059521 2018-02-18 17:34:53 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod Funny that the media keeps saying that Trump can win in 2020 when in 2016 he was an accidental POTUS who did NOT have enough voters of  his own to win but won thanks to the 3rd party protest voter idiots who thought MI, WI & PA were safe blue states. THEY MADE TRUMP POTUS.
965264569848532993 2018-02-18 16:39:41 UTC <Vva10967> @SenatorDurbin @SandraPfaff57 Im pretty sure he said because the Latino community considered him dangerous. We did. He was like Justice Thomas has been for the Black community. Someone who uses his ethnicity to advance and then eliminates the very same programs that helped him.
965119453246738432 2018-02-17 07:03:03 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @chrislhayes Unless Mueller were to examine the voting machines in the MI WI and PA precincts whose voting results didnt match the polls or the party registration of the voters. DHSs claim that the voting machines werent hacked is baseless.  It didnt examine any to know for sure.
965114594862780416 2018-02-17 06:43:45 UTC <Vva10967> @NBCNews Lol. Does @realDonaldTrump think that Mueller and his team would be investigating potential school shooters if they werent investigating Russias sabotage of our 2016 presidential election and his collusion with Putin? 
965113263456440326 2018-02-17 06:38:27 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @xchrisk5 And the media and Trump used the crowd size to reinforce the narrative that she was unpopular when in reality the venues chosen were too small and people who wanted to see her couldnt.
965112567118155776 2018-02-17 06:35:41 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @xchrisk5 Which unfortunately was a mistake in the general because the media wasnt covering her events or her policies and she could have reached thousands more. There were always long lines of people who couldnt get in at her events because the venue had reached capacity.
965106698762539009 2018-02-17 06:12:22 UTC <Vva10967> @NastyCatWoman1 @joanwalsh Obviously thats the lie he is making everyone who works for him say. And McMasters didnt say it. And its the reason Rosenstein said it in the presser limiting it to this indictment so it would be true.
965105534172106752 2018-02-17 06:07:44 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump So thats the lie you are making everyone in your administration repeat?  Your @DHSgov wont test the voting machines so they have NO basis for asserting that Russia didnt hack them. And you won because 78000 Berners voted 3rd Party in states they thought were safe blue.
965045685136523265 2018-02-17 02:09:55 UTC <Vva10967> Exactly.https://twitter.com/realNandanSage/status/964965668796948480
965030664797151232 2018-02-17 01:10:14 UTC <Vva10967> @GOPChairwoman And @SenMajLdr and @SpeakerRyan betrayed our country when they put Party first and didn't let Obama tell the country what Russia was doing. #Treason #TreasonousGOP #BlueWave2018 #VoteTheTraitorsOUT

965005494371999745 2018-02-17 23:30:13 UTC <Vva10967> @robjective Then why not show us the ads and let US decide?  Its the least @facebook can do. Plus Mark Zuckerberg says he believes in transparency. Time to prove it!
965003786535260160 2018-02-17 23:23:26 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @swain241 @AshaRangappa_ Even more interesting is the timing of his rigged claim. It starts after the Russians have hacked the DNC emails and coincidentally its precisely the narrative that Putin needed to weaponize them. 
964926761241804800 2018-02-17 18:17:22 UTC <Vva10967> @DesignDreamer1 Yeah but @DHSgov refuses to examine the voting machines and prefers to make a baseless claim that they werent hacked.
964757884331577345 2018-02-16 07:06:18 UTC <Vva10967> @riotwomennn @Sensata2014 @AuntieMM42 @hollymwchris But it could if Mueller uncovers collusion with Russia that takes down both Trump and Pence in 2019 and Nancy Pelosi is Speaker.
964696793492664321 2018-02-16 03:03:33 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes And by the way, all you pundits keep saying that Trump can win in 2020 and never stop to think that he is an accidental POTUS who got elected because enough idiots voted 3rd party in states they thought were safely blue.  Those idiots made Trump POTUS.
964696228847083520 2018-02-16 03:01:18 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes But it did change the outcome and Mueller and Rosenstein know that if they were to say so, Trump would fire them both. Trump didn't have enough voters of his own to win. He NEEDED the Berners to vote for Jill Stein and Gary Johnson and it worked, THEY elected him.
964676805696327682 2018-02-16 01:44:07 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @BrookLyn1825 do you know when and where he said that? Would love to get the video.
964675611775176704 2018-02-16 01:39:23 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @Social_1_Media That "data" is fake. School shootings began with Columbine in 1999.
964675129161723905 2018-02-16 01:37:28 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @cjcamp49 @Lauwomanator Pretty sure you're arguing with a bot.

964658642610982919 2018-02-16 00:31:57 UTC <Vva10967> @johnpodesta @JoshSchwerin @ThinSkinTrump Podesta got hacked in March 2016 as did the DNC. His speech asking Russia to find Hillarys emails was in late July.
964642677345214464 2018-02-16 23:28:31 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @tomwatson So how do you explain Bernie's "the election is rigged" accusation, which was bizarre yet new and began right after the Russians had hacked (and thus had in their possession) the DNC emails and was precisely what Russia needed (and used) to weaponize them?
964615172802400262 2018-02-16 21:39:13 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines @NefarusContrara The election is rigged? Bernie came up with that and it was what Putin needed to weaponize the DNC emails that Russia already had when Bernie started claiming that.
964614235757142017 2018-02-16 21:35:30 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports So all 130 will be out?
964378403120926721 2018-02-15 05:58:23 UTC <Vva10967> @awelab1956 @TheRynheart He probably assumes that because the shooter has a Spanish last name he must be a member of MS-13 
964327701933887488 2018-02-15 02:36:55 UTC <Vva10967> @ThePlumLineGS You mean THIS IS A LIE AND WE SHOULD ALL CALL IT A LIE.  There, I fixed it.
963934413443731462 2018-02-14 00:34:07 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilipRucker Elections have consequences. Trump is a sociopath and lacks empathy. WE knew that. Why are we surprised now?
963933992054611968 2018-02-14 00:32:27 UTC <Vva10967> @KatyTurNBC By electing Republicans?
963879806927556611 2018-02-14 20:57:08 UTC <Vva10967> @VABVOX @JulieAnderson01 @nasty_woman2 @PopessAllyBlue Lol. Immigrating to Canada is not as easy as PM Trudeau makes it sound. VICE recently did a report on how difficult it actually is. We need to stop electing Republicans. At all levels of government.
963878966816894976 2018-02-14 20:53:48 UTC <Vva10967> @VABVOX @RashmiGaur9 Because we choose to spend our tax revenue on military equipment that our military doesnt need or want and choose to give control of the Congress to the party that has no heart and only cares about profits.
963452020752637952 2018-02-13 16:37:16 UTC <Vva10967> @joshfoxfilm You just killed your credibility as far as Im concerned. If you can lie about the election to fit your desired outcome you can also lie about other things so Im not sure I believe what you showed in Gaslight anymore.
963450084259192832 2018-02-13 16:29:34 UTC <Vva10967> @SenFeinstein @DMRegister @ChuckGrassley @JoyAnnReid @JulieAnnLily Remember that in 2010 Chuck Grassley who had helped write Obamacare went home and campaigned on the LIE that Obamacare had death panels in it and pulled the plug on grandma, and he was allowed to get away with it. Not one Democrat called him on it! He has no moral compass.
963316815681204229 2018-02-12 07:40:01 UTC <Vva10967> @krassenstein And if the Dems win the House they can release Trumps Tax Returns to the public!
963314650065657856 2018-02-12 07:31:24 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Those same people made Trump President. He didnt have enough voters to win. But he won because the Revolutionary a-holes wanted to protest vote just to say FU to @HillaryClinton instead of doing everything they could to stop Trump.
963309940877258753 2018-02-12 07:12:41 UTC <Vva10967> @MyDaughtersArmy @RX7_Lover825 @jonalisag At least with President Obamas you look at it and you know its President Obama. With Michelles you look at it and go, who could that be? It doesnt look like her.
963194801884745729 2018-02-12 23:35:10 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidPriess So at what point does the IC recognize that we have a Manchurian candidate occupying the Oval Office? IC foks tend to be Republican, however the GOP under Trump has morphed into a treasonous party.
963193237618995200 2018-02-12 23:28:57 UTC <Vva10967> @leximccammond @TheBeatWithAri isn't it illegal to give access to classified information to people who do not have clearances and thus are not authorized to see it? And if so, who prosecutes it and if DOJ, what is the statute of limitations?
963192206176739329 2018-02-12 23:24:51 UTC <Vva10967> @MyDaughtersArmy @jonalisag @RX7_Lover825 Agreed. If it didn't say that it was Michelle, I would never have guessed. Barack's does look like him. But with Michelle, the artist missed.
962953237992177665 2018-02-11 07:35:17 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @jenpiotti The happy ending requires a Dem-controlled US House and Senate and a Dem Speaker who becomes POTUS, selects HRC as her VP, resigns and goes back to being Speaker.  Oh and the Illegitimate Orange Clown and his VP are sent to Gitmo for treason.
962951443471794176 2018-02-11 07:28:09 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @want2brd Oh I would watch! The trials would be AWESOME and the sentencing hearings would make America great again! 
962932321631469568 2018-02-11 06:12:10 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @joshfoxfilm Hillary was very nice to him. in 2016. Trump would have unmasked him. And whoever runs in 2020 WILL unmask him. #NeverBernie
962929276122263552 2018-02-11 06:00:04 UTC <Vva10967> @joshfoxfilm Hey Josh, if you just came back to planet Earth, the lawsuit was dismissed. The DNC is NOT a king making institution except in Bernies mind and I bet even he doesnt believe his own lies.
962923608061501442 2018-02-11 05:37:33 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro This proves that Trump is a symptom and not the cause, and that it is the REPUBLICAN PARTY and not just Trump that embraces White Supremacy. You really don't belong there.http://a.msn.com/01/en-us/BBJ0oum?ocid=st
962785316452163584 2018-02-11 20:28:01 UTC <Vva10967> @MikePettigano @djlavoie @SallyAlbright @JoshuaMZeitz But they have to call HER loser in the headline yet they dont do that with Romney. Probably not with Biden either who lost TWICE already and badly or with Kerry who lost BOTH the EC AND the popular vote.
962567945053507584 2018-02-10 06:04:16 UTC <Vva10967> @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @POTUS @JerryFalwellJr Oh my God, you are loony too and you run a University!
962566168539226112 2018-02-10 05:57:12 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill Who is going to buy that?  A crazy woman interviews a man with dementia who cant read? 
962565152976654336 2018-02-10 05:53:10 UTC <Vva10967> @VABVOX @martysullivanjr @bethecricket And @mitchellreports is also getting her share of karma. I think about how badly she treated @HillaryClinton during the campaign whenever Tillerson ignores her or makes her fly commercial
962551845930627072 2018-02-10 05:00:18 UTC <Vva10967> @Waitingfour4 @danpfeiffer And the reason the Dream Act was able to pass the House in 2010 is that @NancyPelosi was Speaker of the House and she got things done. Since Republicans took over the House in 2011 NOTHING gets done. #RepublicansAreIncompetents
962548400343437312 2018-02-10 04:46:36 UTC <Vva10967> @tribelaw @Sharonhotaling3 Nah. She let @Comey steal the election for Trump. She and Lynch both had the legal authority to stop him & knew what he was going to do. Chose not to.
962499396888924161 2018-02-10 01:31:53 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @ananavarro So Ana, George W. Bush wasn't POTUS in 2008???  And Boehner wasn't Speaker in 2011?  And GOP didn't contest Al Franken's Senate win until July 2009? And Scott Brown didn't win his MA Senate Seat in early 2010? Really??? And DACA somehow preceded President Obama's 2012 EO?
962498176656773120 2018-02-10 01:27:02 UTC <Vva10967> @BradMossEsq They're not a "watchdog" group, they're a "Hillary-hunting" group.  That is all they've done since they were created.
962493262853496832 2018-02-10 01:07:30 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump And DACA wasn't a thing until 2012 when Obama invented it with his Executive Order that YOU rescinded.
962492991419092992 2018-02-10 01:06:26 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Hey Dotard, George W. Bush was POTUS in 2008 and John Boehner was Speaker of the House in 2011.  And GOP fought Al Franken's election for 8 months to keep Dems from reaching 60 votes in the Senate and in early 2010 Dems lost Ted Kennedy's seat and thus their 60 vote control.
962491333456945152 2018-02-10 00:59:50 UTC <Vva10967> More families being torn apart by ICE because THIRD PARTY PROTEST VOTERS thought that saying FU to @HillaryClinton was more important than stopping Trump. @SenSanders this is also on you and your "rigged" BS.http://www.wfsb.com/story/37468643/rally-held-in-support-of-couple-facing-deportation#.Wn-VKzoSF5A.twitter

962478125908152320 2018-02-10 00:07:21 UTC <Vva10967> @BetsyGervasi @ABC Bet Chachi says the same thing!
962210058036793344 2018-02-09 06:22:09 UTC <Vva10967> @rtraister Well we didnt elect him. Hes an accidental President who lost the popular vote and only won the electoral college because the Berners and Bernettes decided that saying FU to @HillaryClinton with their 3rd Party votes was more important than stopping Trump and Trumpism. 
962090524684546052 2018-02-09 22:27:10 UTC <Vva10967> @kcbyrne @steve_vladeck Maddow said the other day that they had brought Boente back in some other job so he's not gone yet.
962040632473612291 2018-02-09 19:08:55 UTC <Vva10967> @ZarinaZabrisky @WendySiegelman Makes me wonder if the prostitutes from the PeePee tape wouldn't have uploaded the video to some web or video site back in 2013 when Trump was a businessman but not a presidential candidate or if they didn't write a book similar to the one that Navalny shows in the video?
962037148911222784 2018-02-09 18:55:04 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @Diego_Galaviz_ Only if Dems take the House and ideally also the Senate. We can't leave her exposed to Republican Congresssional shenanigans again.
962036348558479360 2018-02-09 18:51:53 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 And in a clip I saw yesterday @mitchellreports reminded us that the media has no problem w failed POTUS Candidate Biden going for a THIRD try in 2020!   And let's not forget John Kerry who LOST popular vote in 2004 in addition to EC & will be 76 in 2020 but plans to run anyway!
961832934339624960 2018-02-08 05:23:36 UTC <Vva10967> @RepBonnie As your constituent, I urge you to stand with @NancyPelosi and vote NO on the budget bill until Paul Ryan agrees to a clean DACA bill vote in the House. If the government shuts down, so be it.  Dems need to stand with the DACA kids. Thank you.
961831370845663233 2018-02-08 05:17:23 UTC <Vva10967> @NancyPelosi @ananavarro Ana, maybe you need to examine your own biases? Maybe it's internalized misogyny and sexism? Pretty sure that you would say the same thing about @HillaryClinton yet if you examine Hillary's and Nancy's roles in history, they're VERY inspiring.
961793472272400385 2018-02-08 02:46:47 UTC <Vva10967> @dfro @PhilippeReines Yeah but Kelly fired the bodyguard in September 2017.  I mean the bodyguard "resigned" in September 2017. 
961658310545018880 2018-02-08 17:49:42 UTC <Vva10967> @ApocalypticaNow No but sexism and misogyny do. The media covers @NancyPelosi the same way they cover @HillaryClinton focusing 100% on their voice & what they wore & never ever covering their policies or their achievements & always telling people that theyre unpopular.
961483959053049857 2018-02-07 06:16:54 UTC <Vva10967> @RWPUSA Mmmmm NO. Youre assuming hes imitating Putin. I think hes following Hitlers playbook which we know he kept by his bed in 1991. Presumably he was capable of reading back then.
961480246192234496 2018-02-07 06:02:08 UTC <Vva10967> @NancyPelosi @HillaryClinton @HillaryPix @Nasreen12292049 @therealDanaLynn You mean Cadet Bone Spurs? The draft dodger who thinks that POWs are losers and not war heroes because they got captured? The guy who pretends that his foundation gave money to vets? The one who calls states with opioid crisis drug infested dens? That guy? 
961475460797382656 2018-02-07 05:43:07 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh @EricRiback @moorehn Actually if that were true the Senate Immigration bill from 2014 would be law today. Its not. The then Speaker of the House John Boehner kept it from being voted on. Because he could.
961474737472987136 2018-02-07 05:40:15 UTC <Vva10967> @moorehn You may want to educate yourself on how impeachment works. Its spelled out in the US Constitution. Spoiler Alert: it must be started by the House. Guess who controls the agenda there? Hint: he aint a Democrat.
961429566022737920 2018-02-07 02:40:45 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Or Adolf Hitler. Remember this is the guy who back in 1991 when he could still read, kept a copy of Hitlers My New Order by his bed per the interview that his then wife Ivana gave to Vanity Fair.
961378356066504705 2018-02-07 23:17:16 UTC <Vva10967> So the rule about giving back the money donated by sexual predators only applies to Dems? @GOP #GOPisPartyOfSexualPredatorshttps://twitter.com/rebeccaballhaus/status/961245734933811203
961306735133843456 2018-02-07 18:32:40 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines @MeghanMcCain needs to be replaced on @TheView.  She's unbearable to watch & unlike her father she's ignorant & uninformed, AND uses Trump's White Supremacist term (Chain Migration) to refer to Family Reunification & says Dems should just CAVE to the Orange Hitler's MAWA plans!
961293766840733700 2018-02-07 17:41:08 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC Lindsey, YOU KNOW the Orange Fuhrer wants a military parade honoring HIM, not the troops. Like Hitler in Nazi Germany.  You know who read Hitler's My New Order in the 1990s? Donald Trump. His then wife Ivana told Vanity Fair in 1991. This is NOT a coincidence. #militaryparade
961136957161132033 2018-02-06 07:18:02 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines Actually I think Hitlers Nazi Germany is more like it. Remember that Ivana said in 1991 that the Orange Fuhrer kept a copy of Hitlers My New Order near his bed and he could still read back then.
961133085826961409 2018-02-06 07:02:39 UTC <Vva10967> @POTUS @davidaxelrod You assume that because someone has served in our armed forces he/she cant be a racist?  General Kelly agrees with Trump.
960655651209973760 2018-02-05 23:25:30 UTC <Vva10967> That's too bad.https://twitter.com/snopes/status/960649740164698113
960272505364770816 2018-02-04 22:03:00 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @orangedouche @sparriemcclary Same percentage in FL too.
960236585886380032 2018-02-04 19:40:17 UTC <Vva10967> @Scaramucci @emzorbit @ThisWeekABC No worries. We KNOW Donald Trump. He would be lying because that is who he is, a compulsive liar  and what he does. No chance that he would do it accidentally or unintentionally 
960182865882419201 2018-02-04 16:06:49 UTC <Vva10967> @Evan_McMullin But it's because Director @Comey agreed to politicize the @FBI to investigate @HillaryClinton for her use of Bill Clinton's email server to handle her non-classified State Dept emails, when W's administration had "lost" 22 MILLION emails & Colin Powell had put his emails on AOL.
960052007569674240 2018-02-03 07:26:50 UTC <Vva10967> @mamashenay @maggieNYT OMG! @realDonaldTrump is accidentally telling the truth for once!  
960051054044942336 2018-02-03 07:23:02 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump The memo is stupid. Its nothing more than Fox talking points. Its soooo stupid that if he were on The Apprentice, you would tell Nunes, Devin Youre Fired!!!   He really sucks!!!   And if YOU had read his memo, you would know that. Nunes is as stupid as his memo! 
960048467321253888 2018-02-03 07:12:46 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Wall Street Journal is owned by Rupert Murdoch, same guy that owns Fox.  BOTH are FAKE NEWS. Enough said. 
960047953267314688 2018-02-03 07:10:43 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Heck the @FBI hid that you were colluding with Russia AND Director @Comey went rogue on @HillaryClinton and got YOU elected POTUS.
960046309335031808 2018-02-03 07:04:11 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN @realDonaldTrump @WhoopiGoldberg @davidaxelrod Because Trump is an illegitimate President who won with @Comeys and a rogue FBIs help?
960018392097968128 2018-02-03 05:13:15 UTC <Vva10967> @danpfeiffer Maybe we should be asking about the political leanings of the @nytimes Executive Editor Dean Baquet. Is he a Republican? Every freaking NYT headline about Democrats is negative and yet when it comes to Trump the NY Times is always giving him passes and cant call his LIES, LIES!
959667800058023936 2018-02-02 06:00:07 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines @ChristinLuvsSno I bet Nunes Memo #2 will be on Uranium One. Trump is now quoting Tom Fitton, the Judicial Watch a-hole who should have been committed to a psychiatric ward a long time ago.
959618813829492737 2018-02-02 02:45:28 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu We know he does. He already said in a recent interview that he thinks he needs a 9-11 type of event to unite the country (supposedly behind him). I'm pretty sure the country would unite AGAINST him.
959599998328541186 2018-02-02 01:30:42 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Also, don't you think it's suspicious that there was a garbage truck standing on the tracks of the Amtrak train that was carrying the GOP Congressmen to their GOP retreat in West Virginia? Would Trump have expected to get a response similar to the 1 GOP got in baseball shooting?
959599184960778240 2018-02-02 01:27:28 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Trump already said out loud in a recent interview that he thinks a 9-11 type of attack would help him unite the country.  He IS thinking about it.
959318361329975296 2018-02-01 06:51:35 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @CindyPDX True. Just the BernieBros and Bernettes who voted third party to avenge their Messiah did.
959312972421087232 2018-02-01 06:30:10 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah But in the meantime I believe one of the House committees can get the Tax returns, Republicans just refuse to get them, so we should see them in 2019 when Dems are back in control of the House.
959312333339222020 2018-02-01 06:27:38 UTC <Vva10967> @SenFeinstein @kimfrederi @JulieAnnLily What do you expect Senator Feinstein to do? She sent Twitter a letter. As long as Dems are in the minority that is all she can do. Republicans control the hearings and who gets summoned to DC. Dems do not.
959309975481757696 2018-02-01 06:18:15 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidJollyFL What do you think would happen if Nunes releases his memo and there are massive resignations at the FBI in protest?
959220850191949824 2018-02-01 00:24:06 UTC <Vva10967> @MittRomney are you sure you don't want to take up knitting like @VanityFair says losing Presidential Candidates should???  
958956171272118273 2018-01-31 06:52:22 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill She knew wed need something to keep us occupied during Trumps SOTU since we were boycotting it. 
958954908883062784 2018-01-31 06:47:21 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @Comey @FBI @NickMerrill Similarly with Nunes memo, Nunes is accusing the FBI of abusing its surveillance powers & the FBI cant correct the record without disclosing the classified info that it included in the FISA warrant application /2
958954136455786496 2018-01-31 06:44:17 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill And Karma is hitting Strzok AND the FBI hard. Nunes is doing to the @FBI what @Comey did to @HillaryClinton in July 2016: falsely accusing her of being extremely careless knowing she couldnt defend herself without making public the emails that they had now labeled classified./1
958951707194556416 2018-01-31 06:34:38 UTC <Vva10967> @politico @TGowdySC got sick of selling his soul to the devil for power???  or is he going back home to collect his reward for having done so? Did Trump promise him a judgeship for betraying the @FBI with his vote to release the Nunes memo?
958942755148980225 2018-01-31 05:59:03 UTC <Vva10967> @morninggloria @samstein Press inability to just say Im sorry over obsessive coverage of @HillaryClintons emails, sexist and misogynistic coverage and false equivalencies reflects a weird trait of virtually every media outlet : the notion that apologizing is a sign of weakness.   #FixedIt4U
958922725610938368 2018-01-31 04:39:28 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh I dont. And frankly I think its more likely that Michael Wolff was referring to her than to Nikki Haley since it was Hope that was steaming Trumps pants while he was wearing them and shes the age that he finds attractive. 
958921068223389698 2018-01-31 04:32:53 UTC <Vva10967> @TGowdySC Returning to the justice system will be hard after betraying the FBI to protect the Orange Fuhrer, no?  How you sleep at night is a mistery to me. Youre so crooked!!! #PartyOverCountry
958732263981834240 2018-01-31 16:02:38 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines Melania's outfit was a strange choice for a birther.
958569822966738945 2018-01-30 05:17:09 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro @TheView Can you PLEASE replace @MeghanMcCain with Ana Navarro?  Meghan always sounds bitter and/or resentful. Ana on the other hand is very entertaining. Love her!
958476766745694208 2018-01-30 23:07:23 UTC <Vva10967> Since Trump believes in conspiracy theories, lets hope he isnt planning a 9-11.https://apple.news/ASXau0PkVSi6vUNHy-Kx95g
958468067662749699 2018-01-30 22:32:49 UTC <Vva10967> @willafrej Would love to know who his wife and adult children voted for in 2016. So many voted for Trump and showed NO empathy for the immigrants that Trump openly targeted, thinking that his anti-immigrant agenda would not affect them, and surprise, it has!

958385308323794944 2018-01-30 17:03:58 UTC <Vva10967> @PoliticsWolf Yeah but the Trump Tax Scams elimination of the SALT deduction will cost GOP their seats in CA NY and NJ because it raises taxes on the income brackets that typically vote Republican, to punish blue states.
958383983368261632 2018-01-30 16:58:42 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes Except that Democratic control of the House and Senate can expose and stop that. THAT was missing in the Benghazi and email witch hunts where Republicans ABUSED the governments power for political purposes.
958381049985236993 2018-01-30 16:47:02 UTC <Vva10967> Hey @CNN @cnnbrk @CNNPolitics one of your employees is using plagiarized data. #investigate https://twitter.com/redistrict/status/958370576191709190

958214220230873088 2018-01-29 05:44:07 UTC <Vva10967> @RepAdamSchiff FBI didnt find her handling of classified info extremely careless, Director @Comey did. And his history with the Clintons was long and suspect enough that he should have recused himself from the investigation and let his deputy (McCabe) handle it.
958189234816454657 2018-01-29 04:04:50 UTC <Vva10967> @Comey This was a really bad idea.  It looks like our country may not survive it.pic.twitter.com/XCU8wLuzCr

GOP Congressmen in CA, NY and NJ should ALL lose their seats due to GOP's eliminating the SALT deduction to punish blue states. It hits hard the income brackets that tend to vote Republican in these states (as in thousands of $$$ hard)
957887289555865600 2018-01-29 08:05:01 UTC <Vva10967> @JonahNRO @JustinRYoung @BarackObama @JoeNBC @YeYowYa Youre confused. What that explains is why the recovery was so slow. Mitch & Boehner were too busy blocking everything Obama proposed to make him a one term president. To hell with country, its Party First for the Republicans.
957821528565051392 2018-01-28 03:43:42 UTC <Vva10967> Love this!https://twitter.com/davidmackau/status/957811316852428800
957517495128264705 2018-01-27 07:35:35 UTC <Vva10967> @MikeLevinCA @AdamParkhomenko Now that Darrell Issa is out of the race, it is possible that you would have 2 Dems in the general election for his seat?

957423561576153089 2018-01-27 01:22:19 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem Sorry but I disagree. She didn't mess up. She followed the HR rules of 2008.  That's like when people accuse her of being against same-sex marriage in the 1990s. That's just the way it was. She evolved as society evolved. Nobody else is judged for their past actions like she is.
957419898417963010 2018-01-27 01:07:46 UTC <Vva10967> @ericgarland @FareedZakaria Trump is still a racist. NOTHING changes that. He is also a liar, an authoritarian and a sociopath. NOTHING changes that.  He also believes he is above the law. NOTHING changes that. Why would reading a teleprompter in Davos change our view of him???
957414484519342080 2018-01-27 00:46:15 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 The @washingtonpost headline is wrong. It's not the Classified Russia Memo that Trump wants to release but the Nunes Bullshit Memo. The Classified Russia Memo would be the one that Obama & Trump were given by the IC in January 2017 with sources & methods.
957292262949613569 2018-01-27 16:40:35 UTC <Vva10967> @RuthMarcus Your head must REALLY, REALLY, REALLY explode knowing that we have a sexual assaulter as @POTUS then! Just how infuriating do you find his denials? Surely you KNOW that a woman filed a complaint saying @realDonaldTrump raped her when she was 12 or 13 at a Jeffrey Epstein party?
957291000887742464 2018-01-27 16:35:34 UTC <Vva10967> @FLOTUS @secupp Shouldn't you be asking @Flotus Melania Trump to call Trump's 16 accusers? or is it more than 16, I can't keep track.  Including the girl who filed the lawsuit accusing Trump of raping her at a Jeffrey Epstein apartment when she was 12 or 13 years old???  #GOPisPARTYofTRUMP
957286082118406144 2018-01-27 16:16:02 UTC <Vva10967> @SenBobCasey No offense but you guys are REALLY BAD AT MESSAGING. During the shutdown Dems spoke of wanting something about Pensions, never mentioning that it was pensions for coal miners. In the meantime, the coal miners still think that Trump is their champion and that Dems are not! 
957032088355659777 2018-01-26 23:26:45 UTC <Vva10967> @marcolblackwell @KamalaHarris Dont they need 60 votes in which case Dems CAN block it?
956787000786505728 2018-01-25 07:12:51 UTC <Vva10967> @SenRonJohnson @jimsciutto Was his informant Devin Nunes??? 
956769635130515457 2018-01-25 06:03:51 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN Hey CNN, it's 2 EMPLOYEES of the @FBI, not @Comey and/or his deputy Andy McCabe, discussing the investigation.  2 REPUBLICAN EMPLOYEES who wanted JOHN KASICH to be POTUS, not Hillary, not Trump, not Sanders. Leave the Conspiracy Theories to CRAZY Fox!!!
956716156097843200 2018-01-25 02:31:21 UTC <Vva10967> @rachaelmbade Nah. The Blue Tsunami is coming regardless. They can point to the election of Donald J Trump and to their own missing backbones.
956710043839287296 2018-01-25 02:07:03 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko Although she flew to Florida today.  General Kelly also stayed behind and unlike Melania, he stayed in the White House....
956673925202808832 2018-01-25 23:43:32 UTC <Vva10967> @funder will you make the podcast available on Itunes?
956427171840561153 2018-01-24 07:23:01 UTC <Vva10967> @Montgomery_bjm @peterdaou Makes me wonder what Russia might have on Devin Nunes. They did hack the RNC servers.
956201876680335360 2018-01-24 16:27:47 UTC <Vva10967> @SenGillibrand @matthewjdowd @itsybitsydotsie @Rontildawn But she wont be. I dont see her motivating a large enough segment of the Dem base. I do like her as a Senator despite the Franken fiasco she pulled.
956082470964875264 2018-01-24 08:33:18 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias @hoosiemommy27 @sanblasena But it was the Berners that voted third party to avenge their Messiah that elected Trump. He didnt have enough voters to win without them. And it was Bernie who made them hate her, not Trump.
955944021553229825 2018-01-23 23:23:09 UTC <Vva10967> @reesetheone1 So @SenSanders was it worth it to demonize Hillary? All this suffering can be traced to your "she's corrupt" and "the election is rigged" narratives. You knew better.
955900269631549440 2018-01-23 20:29:18 UTC <Vva10967> @Slate so they should have let children with chronic conditions die??? because we all know that Mitch is a sociopath like Trump and would not have hesitated to let kids die for a good political ad.
955897346419773441 2018-01-23 20:17:41 UTC <Vva10967> @ReutersPolitics Real crime is that slow Mr. Sessions??? or are you a believer in GOP conspiracy theories? @jeffsessions
955655340225425408 2018-01-22 04:16:02 UTC <Vva10967> @MarkWarner @SenatorBurr How can Jared Kushner be receiving the Presidents Daily Briefing if he doesnt have the requisite security clearance??? Are security clearances optional now??? @KamalaHarris @AdamSchiffCA
955652018449866753 2018-01-22 04:02:51 UTC <Vva10967> @mviser Dont be so dramatic. Thats how  we ended up with Trump, because of disillusioned lefties who cant keep their eyes on the prize. Republicans on the other hand are VERY disciplined and thats how they win.
955616982514257920 2018-01-22 01:43:37 UTC <Vva10967> @patrickdmarley @mkraju It wasnt illegal. IG report already addressed that. Different rules cannot continue to be applied to @HillaryClinton because the Republicans need a distraction from the ineptitude & treason of Trump. Press needs to stop playing along.
955611634466254849 2018-01-22 01:22:22 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @TheSickness85 It helps if you actually get out and vote straight ticket for Democrats so these Senators that you are forcing to do the right thing control the Senate & House & can get the job done. The parties are NOT the same. One, GOP, is racist. The other one, Dems, cares about people.
955574984872792069 2018-01-22 22:56:44 UTC <Vva10967> @lsarsour We wouldnt be here if you Berners had fought to elect @HillaryClinton in the general election. She was the last thing standing between us and a Trump apocalypse which the 3rd party protest voters made possible. But of course chaos is good business and you are now profiting. Q
955562717795975169 2018-01-22 22:08:00 UTC <Vva10967> @T_FisherKing @HawaiiDelilah @briancheeek You did but I bet a LOT of those people marching now did not.  If there had been this much energy and outrage to PREVENT a Donald Trump presidency, we wouldn't be here.
955529045055365120 2018-01-22 19:54:11 UTC <Vva10967> Funny how the #TrumpShutdown coincided with the Women's Marches and kept the media reporting 24/7 on the #TrumpShutdown while ignoring the Marches. And lo and behold, the Marches ended and so did the #TrumpShutdown...https://twitter.com/Shareblue/status/955510919404113920
955521201635577857 2018-01-22 19:23:01 UTC <Vva10967> @SHSanders45 @JoyAnnReid doesn't the ad say at the end "I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message?"
955520650621440001 2018-01-22 19:20:50 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid why do you think that is?
955513276514922496 2018-01-22 18:51:32 UTC <Vva10967> @iSheyman @MoveOn but you have to admit that Mitch is a good hostage-taker & used CHIP to get his way. There's no CHIP hostage in the next CR.  Also Dems are TERRIBLE at messaging. They need to anticipate & prep for the worst from GOP & McConnell. @TomPerez @keithellison @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi
955511634520432640 2018-01-22 18:45:00 UTC <Vva10967> @RajShah45 @juliehdavis @maddezmom @CopyDan @Vince_WF @Sheryl_Lynn_NB proves that McConnell is a good hostage taker and forced Dems to choose between CHIP and DACA.  Next time, it's just DACA, no CHIP.
955509875500601350 2018-01-22 18:38:01 UTC <Vva10967> @joannalampert1 @ChrisJZullo Actually Trump got the media to focus 24/7 on his #TrumpShutdown #GOPShutdown and ignore the Women's Marches.  Maybe that was the plan all along?
955507681955057664 2018-01-22 18:29:18 UTC <Vva10967> @tomperriello This is what the self-entitled 3rd party voters brought on our country and on the Dreamers and other immigrants. We ALL KNEW Trump was RACIST and ANTI-IMMIGRANT from the moment he launched his campaign but 3rd party voters didn't care because THEY were not on the chopping block.
955246434693144576 2018-01-21 01:11:12 UTC <Vva10967> Hey @realDonaldTrump all these people HATE YOU.  You win MOST HATED POTUS EVER. And this is just the US.  There were marches against you ALL OVER THE WORLD!!!https://twitter.com/cnni/status/954900635819872256
955211889511944192 2018-01-21 22:53:56 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias And yes, people have short memories. How else do you explain electing another Republican to the White House after the last Republican took a booming economy from his Dem predecessor & collapsed it & almost collapsed the world's economy too? And W wasn't 1/10 as stupid as Trump!
955211236957880320 2018-01-21 22:51:20 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Also, as dangerous as W was, he didn't contemplate starting a nuclear holocaust.
955210649461776384 2018-01-21 22:49:00 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias They key word is "yet".  Trump has been riding Obama's economic recovery but that is over now that he has passed his Tax Cut. I bet he collapses the American economy a lot quicker than Bush! Bush at least had semi-decent staff.  Trump is surrounded by morons like himself.
955208775870361602 2018-01-21 22:41:33 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @keithellison I think it's a calculated ploy to lower the popularity of Democrats in the 2018 Midterms because they see a Blue Tsunami coming.  The Republicans are shamelessly holding CHIP, DACA and Military Pay hostage for partisan purposes. @MilitaryTimes @votevets
955198876826431488 2018-01-21 22:02:13 UTC <Vva10967> @Maggie_Klaus And during the weekend of the Womens Marches which he knew would be large and which have gotten very little coverage from the media because theyre all busy reporting 24/7 on the shutdown.
955196933097783296 2018-01-21 21:54:30 UTC <Vva10967> @Evan_McMullin He needs to be charged with obstruction of justice.
955177944187580416 2018-01-21 20:39:02 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @MSNBC @bj141cox @barbls23 There is also a thing that they don't understand and that is that the women marching aren't marching because of them, the 4 original organizers, but in spite of them.  A lot of the marchers are people inspired by Hillary, & others are Indivisible Group & Emerge & PP etc members.
955118560858210306 2018-01-21 16:43:04 UTC <Vva10967> @AriFleischer @phwarner @josnoss Lost? You cant lose that which you never had. 
954952986115149824 2018-01-20 05:45:08 UTC <Vva10967> @DanaHoule all the a-holes who voted for Trump assumed that his anti-immigrant rhetoric would apply only to illegals and didnt think that he would target everyone who looks brown.  Trumps support for the AZ show me your papers law should have made it clear where he was heading.
954775533547671553 2018-01-20 18:00:00 UTC <Vva10967> @CREWcrew And can he go to jail for it?
954598062709788673 2018-01-19 06:14:48 UTC <Vva10967> I feel sorry for the elites at DAVOS who have to put up with so many fing morons from the US this year, starting with @realDonaldTrump https://twitter.com/alivitali/status/951552524594622466
954585743967563777 2018-01-19 05:25:51 UTC <Vva10967> @GoAngelo Why not start a petition to have Dean Baquet removed?
954581126659690496 2018-01-19 05:07:30 UTC <Vva10967> @JudgeJeanine I hope a bear eats you.
954527754778750977 2018-01-19 01:35:25 UTC <Vva10967> @SecretService there is a deranged woman in the Chappaqua NY woods who is obsessed with @HillaryClinton.  She sounds dangerous and mentally unstable.https://twitter.com/JudgeJeanine/status/954476644919578625
954519165137752066 2018-01-19 01:01:17 UTC <Vva10967> @DonaldJTrumpJr @PhilippeReines Fox is melting Don Jr.'s brain, just like it melted @realDonaldTrump's. And there wasn't much to melt in the first place! 
954516032495988737 2018-01-19 00:48:50 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @goldlawny No, that's cloture.  It takes 51 to pass a bill once it proceeds to voting. Blame is on Trump because he SAID before the cameras that he would sign ANY bipartisan bill that the Congress put before him, and then he backtracked.
954392942042669061 2018-01-19 16:39:43 UTC <Vva10967> @verrit and yet we continue fracking in the USA.
954389450129334272 2018-01-19 16:25:51 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou and MEDIA (@MSNBC @CNN @nytimes @washingtonpost @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews , @realDonaldTrump is holding the government hostage over his stupid wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for. He won't sign anything that doesn't include $20 billion for his stupid wall.  REPORT IT.
954388714641412097 2018-01-19 16:22:55 UTC <Vva10967> @DonaldJTrumpJr you should stop watching Fox News.  Look how crazy it has made your father and he probably started watching in the last 10 years. He was always an a-hole but now he's delusional (even if he can still tell rhinos, lions and camels apart )
954247100459601920 2018-01-18 07:00:12 UTC <Vva10967> @MaddowBlog @maddow @Lawrence So as the federal government shuts down, @realDonaldTrump will be hosting a mega fundraiser at Mar-A-Lago!    (mmmm, wonder if Melania will be asked about The Stormy Daniels story...)https://twitter.com/thehill/status/954196745717800961
953882993239748608 2018-01-17 06:53:22 UTC <Vva10967> @jonallendc I can. Hillarys emails!!!!
953790532270125056 2018-01-17 00:45:58 UTC <Vva10967> @brianstelter Next time can @nytimes at least ask these morons (and include in heir profiles) their age, where they get their news, their 3 favorite TV shows, & if they have ever travelled abroad.
953725397715255296 2018-01-17 20:27:08 UTC <Vva10967> @gdebenedetti She persisted in lying under oath?  
953488099031572480 2018-01-16 04:44:12 UTC <Vva10967> @kthalps @joanwalsh @TinaMorphis Sounds like Katie and @realDonaldTrump have something in common 
953460650726035456 2018-01-16 02:55:08 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost And if so, he too is an enabler as he votes with Trump despite his rhetoric.
953315060730028034 2018-01-16 17:16:36 UTC <Vva10967> @womensmarch @bust_magazine What happens to the DC March if there is a government shutdown?  Is it possible thats what Trump is trying to avoid, the embarrassment of seeing a repeat of the hundreds of thousands marching against him in 2017?
953071862602457088 2018-01-15 01:10:13 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Funny, I remember people in WI during a post-election townhall hosted by @chrislhayes saying that they wouldn't let this happen.  I don't see them coming to help any of the deported nor their US born children? 
952804039565172736 2018-01-14 07:25:59 UTC <Vva10967> @themistocles_w @jdawsey1 Were @realDonaldTrumps dentures coming off again when he said it?  
952669887251480579 2018-01-14 22:32:55 UTC <Vva10967> @CandiceAiston LOL, she sounds like a female Steve Bannon!
952664349621047296 2018-01-14 22:10:55 UTC <Vva10967> @RandPaul @MeetThePress So we shouldn't tell the Emperor that he has NO clothes???  
952664084893315072 2018-01-14 22:09:52 UTC <Vva10967> @VanJones68 lol, bet that when Trump READS his State of the Union speech off the teleprompter later this month you'll say he's back to being Presidential! But Trump has always been a racist & at 71 he ain't going to change.  p.s. telling people to vote for Jill didn't work out too well, uh?
952597955982315521 2018-01-14 17:47:05 UTC <Vva10967> @pastormarkburns @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow Did your team miss this expose that CNN did on the pastor in 2016? He owes his rise to fame to Donald Trump and was caught by CNN falsifying his resume:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbIGBCcfKZg
952412483456823296 2018-01-13 05:30:05 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko When Dems take control of the House they should subpoena the Sep 2012 to Jan 2016 emails of Trey Gowdy, Kevin McCarthy, and Jason Chaffetz that relate to Benghazi and/or to @HillaryClinton. Bet they show conspiracy. @RepCummings
952362973259096064 2018-01-13 02:13:21 UTC <Vva10967> @FranCastric1 @MSNBC Be serious, he was likely told that the Brits couldnt assure that people wouldnt throw eggs and tomatoes at his car and entourage 
952214998952108032 2018-01-13 16:25:21 UTC <Vva10967> @pastormarkburns And you should find another occupation since you've aligned yourself with Trump who stands for everything that was repugnant to Jesus Christ.
952052581764870145 2018-01-12 05:39:58 UTC <Vva10967> @livemusic4me Are you a recent viewer? Did you watch his coverage of the 2008 Dem primary? It was Misogyny 101 
951635104190861318 2018-01-11 02:01:04 UTC <Vva10967> @sundarpichai @SusanWojcicki @karaswisher @AriMelber @TheBeatWithAri I have a question for YouTube. Are there any plans for combating fake news?  Its REALLY BAD on YouTube. Do a search for Hillary Clinton and you will see an alternate universe where she is being dragged to prison.
951542358436405249 2018-01-11 19:52:31 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 Mueller also needs to investigate Giuliani, Jim Kallstrom and the NY FBI Office.
951538009853349888 2018-01-11 19:35:14 UTC <Vva10967> @joncoopertweets Do you think that person that you spoke to will be called by Mueller's team to testify? ie. is he high enough in the totem pole to be called in?
951537184691060737 2018-01-11 19:31:58 UTC <Vva10967> @CNNPolitics Good thing @realDonaldTrump is working on fixing those libel laws to make it easier to sue POS like Joe Arpaio AND @realDonaldTrump himself. @HillaryClinton should become a billionaire suing Trump for all the times he has falsely called her "Crooked"!
951535582408314880 2018-01-11 19:25:36 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald You would think that they are required to file WARN notices with the Federal government, no?
951535013077676035 2018-01-11 19:23:20 UTC <Vva10967> This Thread shows that @realDonaldTrump is always reacting to the news he gets on TV.  The Right made their Crazy Fox-Watching Uncle POTUS!!!https://twitter.com/MattGertz/status/951108342205878272
951520927820472320 2018-01-11 18:27:22 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert But I don't think they (coal miners) have turned on Trump yet. Reality hasn't hit them yet. Or they refuse to believe they were conned.
951498625783336960 2018-01-11 16:58:45 UTC <Vva10967> @jodikantor @JaneSlavin Bill's and Monica's was a consensual affair. That has never been in dispute.
951498317036441600 2018-01-11 16:57:31 UTC <Vva10967> @jodikantor @mondiani @AditiJuneja3 only because there are too many of them to be able to remember their names.  If Congress had impeached Trump over the 20+ sexual assault allegations from those women as they did with with Clinton over the consensual affair he had with Monika Lewinski, we would ALL know the names.
951497166987649031 2018-01-11 16:52:57 UTC <Vva10967> @jodikantor The only victim of "the Bill Clinton scandal" was @HillaryClinton.  Bill's and Monica's was a CONSENSUAL affair.  You're doing false equivalencies, typical of the @nytimes. Do you have to be a Clinton hater to work there?
951345884121522176 2018-01-10 06:51:48 UTC <Vva10967> @sarahkendzior I was blocked by Univision's Jorge Ramos for telling him that the false equivalencies he kept creating in his Sunday show between @HillaryClinton and Trump would get Trump elected. And I was right.
951342877149409280 2018-01-10 06:39:51 UTC <Vva10967> @sarahkendzior I was blocked by Jake Tapper for calling him out after he and other CNN anchors ran @HillaryClinton Uranium One stories on Oct 27 2017 in response to a Trump tweet that ordered the media to do it.
951285270686633988 2018-01-10 02:50:57 UTC <Vva10967> @charlesbethea and the local press didn't do much diligence on Trump either? it's no secret that FOR DECADES Trump has been a con artist, been anti-union in his hotels, cheated contractors, filed 4 bankruptcy multiple times, used Chinese steel for his buildings & made his clothes lines in China
951276865716662272 2018-01-10 02:17:33 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC What are YOU smoking?  What achievements???  A tax scam bill that will cost GOP the House, tank the economy that Obama fixed, bring on another Great Recession and bankrupt us?  A Puerto Rico left in the dark that will cost GOP Florida?  #BlueWave
951139288925790209 2018-01-10 17:10:52 UTC <Vva10967> @GoAngelo But Bannon deserved it.  He and the Mercers financed the Clinton Cash book & movie that slanders the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation #karma
950772991788568576 2018-01-09 16:55:20 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump learning the words to the National Anthem would be a good start for you, no?   Or maybe you knew the words and you forgot them because you do have Alzheimer's? Your dad had it, and it runs in families. Prove you don't have it by taking a mental exam & releasing the results!
950771535442259968 2018-01-09 16:49:33 UTC <Vva10967> @TomArnold But I bet she didn't have Alzheimer's...... Trump was always an a-hole, but what he has now is dementia and it runs in his family.
950590582765838336 2018-01-08 04:50:30 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Or he doesnt REMEMBER the words because he has Alzheimers?
950501434025488384 2018-01-08 22:56:15 UTC <Vva10967> @POTUS @CharlesMBlow @cbeilinson @LuBonLez @_Seedsy_ @JudyWhaleCove @MichelleMarched We don't choose the GOP Candidates. The GOP idiots do.  And OUR candidates end up having to clean up the mess the GOP Presidents leave behind. And the 2020 Democratic POTUS will have the most cleaning up to do of any POTUS ever. A Great Depression, maybe even a nuclear holocaust.
950457921703497728 2018-01-08 20:03:21 UTC <Vva10967> @jonallendc Maybe you should write a book exploring and explaining what has caused the dumbing down of America and how that is holding us back? Its really really bad.
950402235200090113 2018-01-08 16:22:05 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs And that is why this great nation of ours, the United States of America, will never fulfill its potential.  Because we don't value knowledge, intelligence or experience. W connected with voters, look where that got us.
950268921713713152 2018-01-07 07:32:20 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs @EvanHandler @robertdsheridan Americans are soooo bad at learning anything from history! Obamas decision to pull Dem Senators and Governors into his Cabinet allowed the GOP to fill those seats with Republicans and now were screwed and extremely close to GOP being able to amend the US Constitution.
950190148758786048 2018-01-07 02:19:19 UTC <Vva10967> @Kasparov63 The Democratic Party is not broken. The 2 parties are NOT the same. Demagogues say they are to fundraise for their own benefit eg Our Revolution, but that doesnt make their claims true. The perpetuation of that LIE made Trump POTUS.  He couldnt have won without 3rd party votes.
950188988333219842 2018-01-07 02:14:43 UTC <Vva10967> @Kasparov63 How long have you lived here and you still dont fully grasp the racism, xenophobia, sexism and misogyny that are still prevalent in rural areas and in red states or the brainwashing of old people that Fox has been carrying out for the past 20 years?
949545196651499520 2018-01-05 07:36:31 UTC <Vva10967> @runforsomething @AndrewPaulJoyce @alexkotch @kgoebel The Trump Tax Scam could do the trick. It really raises taxes on CA NY and NJ.
949465537414946816 2018-01-05 02:19:58 UTC <Vva10967> @runforsomething @AndrewPaulJoyce @alexkotch @kgoebel yeah but in CA, if you manage to get 2 Democrats in the top 2 spots, the Republican is left out of the general.
949461363864293377 2018-01-05 02:03:23 UTC <Vva10967> @PreetBharara but it won't happen until we flip the House in November.  GOP is treasonous and will protect Trump over country. e.g. Nunes, Ryan, Grassley, Graham.
949459752337240064 2018-01-05 01:56:59 UTC <Vva10967> @POTUS @davidaxelrod Yeah but the same is true of the GOP Congressmen and Senators and look how THAT has turned out! All #TreasonousGOP
949452386459963392 2018-01-05 01:27:43 UTC <Vva10967> @davidfrum Its not the system of power but the Republican Party that is enabling Trump. #TreasonousGOP
949362044494598145 2018-01-05 19:28:44 UTC <Vva10967> @GovHowardDean what about treasonous @ChuckGrassley and @LindseyGrahamSC who just referred Christopher Steele for criminal investigation to DOJ? The ENTIRE @GOP is betraying their oaths to defend the US Constitution and have become the Party of Trump. #VoteGOPOut #TreasonousGOP
949358160011284480 2018-01-05 19:13:18 UTC <Vva10967> #GOPCorruption #GOPTreason How can any patriotic American still support the GOP?https://twitter.com/newtgingrich/status/948719733918101504
949356503462502401 2018-01-05 19:06:43 UTC <Vva10967> @Comey @benjaminwittes Do you think US Democracy survives a deranged POTUS, a treasonous @GOP, a treasonous @ChuckGrassley, a treasonous @LindseyGrahamSC, a corrupt AG Jeff Sessions & a corrupt Arkansas DOJ appointee? Seems we are heading Russia's & Putin's way. #HowUSDemocracyDied #Oct282016
949352680778010624 2018-01-05 18:51:31 UTC <Vva10967> So what exactly does Russia have on Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham? Remember that Russia hacked the RNC servers but didn't put contents on Wikileaks.https://nyti.ms/2F3GEUC
949336944273690624 2018-01-05 17:48:59 UTC <Vva10967> @timkaine I'm sure Dems will stand up to Trump.  Republicans on the other hand have proven that they will not.  What happens if he nukes millions?  War Crime?
949328668341555212 2018-01-05 17:16:06 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews @marebytes hey idiot, the US Government PROMOTES the sale of arms to other countries. It's part of its job, to promote US MANUFACTURING.  We manufacture weapons. e.g. Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, L3, etc.
949170370300596224 2018-01-04 06:47:05 UTC <Vva10967> @AlexMohajer Did @FoxNews not get an advanced copy of Fire and Fury?  
949167382685241344 2018-01-04 06:35:13 UTC <Vva10967> @SunflowerSoul71 @HRCpersists I think how much damage Trump does to our economy, institutions and standing in the world between now & 2020 & what Mueller uncovers about Trumps & others 2016 collusion w Russia will determine who the nominee will be in 2020. Its too early to tell.
949045685118226433 2018-01-04 22:31:38 UTC <Vva10967> @robertcaruso Who is going to finance him? For years it has been the Mercers and theyre apparently divorcing him. Maybe he takes revenge instead and tells Mueller how Jared, Don Jr, Brad Parscale and Cambridge Analytica collaborated with Russian hackers and bots.
948999542271303681 2018-01-04 19:28:17 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT Its not. It was never a big deal except to the media who never understood it and blew it out of proportion. Just like Benghazi. No crime was committed and investigating it 30x wont change outcome only waste money.
948753177402400769 2018-01-03 03:09:19 UTC <Vva10967> @KimStrassel Or there is someone else higher up in the food chain /Trump campaign who also said too much to our allies.
948733113466748929 2018-01-03 01:49:35 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @RepSwalwell @emmajaniejones Bernie did.  And Jill Stein did.
948719743422418949 2018-01-03 00:56:27 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod As can the people who vote 3rd Party. Trump didnt have enough voters to elect him POTUS. The Far Left made him POTUS with their 3rd Party votes in the swing States. Numbers dont lie.
948646146335039490 2018-01-03 20:04:00 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines lol, apparently Bannon is now a "staffer" -- not sure if that is above or below "coffee boy".  
948644573148049409 2018-01-03 19:57:45 UTC <Vva10967> @NatashaBertrand So, is staffer above or below "coffee boy"??? 
948439011542134784 2018-01-02 06:20:56 UTC <Vva10967> @Scout_Finch New Jersey is closer and bluer and not as freaking cold as MN. @HillaryClinton could easily beat Senator Bob Menendez who is up for re-election in 2018 if she wanted to join the Senate again...
948384278294953985 2018-01-02 02:43:26 UTC <Vva10967> @jdawsey1 No idiot. She had 3 SCIFs AND a CLASSIFIED GOVERNMENT account for communications LABELED CLASSIFIED. The Media was too inept to ever explain that the private server handled her NON-Classified communications, like discussions about front page NYT stories which is what Comey found.
948381911344402433 2018-01-02 02:34:02 UTC <Vva10967> @PragmaticObot The 3rd party voters in the swing states made him POTUS.  He didn't have enough voters of his own to win.  So here we are stuck with him for the foreseeable future since GOP won't remove him no matter how insane he is.
948237561666916353 2018-01-02 17:00:26 UTC <Vva10967> @Comey, still no regrets? you unleashed a madman on our country and the Republicans in Congress refuse to stop him.  BUT HER EMAILS!!!!! #Javerthttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948174033882927104
947892749654806528 2018-01-01 18:10:17 UTC <Vva10967> @peterbakernyt @neeratanden LOL, Peter knew that his Dec 31 piece was even worse and would be published only 2 days after that awful "interview"  As they say in reality television these days: SAD!https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/us/politics/trump-reinventing-presidency.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur
947889257259110402 2018-01-01 17:56:24 UTC <Vva10967> @SpeakerRyan Yeah, specially Americans living in CA, NY & NJ in the income brackets that typically vote Republican who will see their taxes rise by several thousand dollars thanks to the GOP Tax Scam.  The GOP said FU to the Blue States in 2017, and in 2018 the Blue States get to say FU back!
947888114592309248 2018-01-01 17:51:52 UTC <Vva10967> @mikefarb1 @ilovelightning No offense but you're guessing. I want to know for sure from a cyber security expert.
947880420934324224 2018-01-01 17:21:17 UTC <Vva10967> @TiffanyATrump @EricTrump @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @pastormarkburns You mean hiring nannies to help your wife and ex-wives raise them is YOUR standard for being a "REAL" father? Barack Obama was 1000X more real father to his girls and I never heard you praise him?
947879656153403392 2018-01-01 17:18:15 UTC <Vva10967> @Newsweek News organizations need to stop referring to Trump as the leader of the free world. That has been Angela Merkel since January 20, 2017.  Trump is just the US President.
947710301285376000 2017-12-31 06:05:18 UTC <Vva10967> @NBCNews Wheres the ball??
947709779664887808 2017-12-31 06:03:13 UTC <Vva10967> @RWPUSA Richard you and @ananavarro should both join the Democratic Party. The Republicans party that you remember no longer exists.
947604928763191296 2017-12-31 23:06:35 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes Dear New York Times and Peter Baker: You, like Trump, keep sinking lower. You're really making me think that I should NOT renew my subscription when it comes due in 2 months. If I wanted to read a pro-Trump tabloid, I would subscribe to the @WSJ.
947518058939207682 2017-12-31 17:21:23 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes can we get an explanation? if not, @washingtonpost can you investigate and let the public know how such egregious mistake was made?https://twitter.com/SusaMorgan/status/947240473470443520
947515783227297792 2017-12-31 17:12:21 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump They would be the same, likely higher. You have been riding the Obama economy. YOUR economy starts Jan 1, 2018, with the effects of YOUR tax bill on the economy and on domestic growth and increased deficits and HUGE ADDITIONAL debt.
947362234082254849 2017-12-30 07:02:12 UTC <Vva10967> @ebruenig @PhilippeReines Others have been fired for less. Showed extremely poor judgment. They should be fired. Freedom of speech doesnt mean that your actions will have no consequences, only that the government cant come after you for what you say.

And NO ONE called him on it, not the media, not Obama, not his fellow Senators. NOBODY. And that POS is still in the Senate trying to stop Mueller.
947246645707771904 2017-12-30 23:22:53 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @SenSanders @DNC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @keltickaty @urmadz @drdiegomyego @Cliff_M85 @JSException Until recently the Left's answer to the Right Wing propaganda has been to ignore it and that obviously hasn't worked. We allowed Hillary to be labelled flawed over a stupid server where she was discussing how to respond to questions about a front page NYT Story on CIA drones.
947246079195664385 2017-12-30 23:20:38 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @SenSanders @DNC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @keltickaty @urmadz @drdiegomyego @Cliff_M85 @JSException Yeah, I agree that we didn't do enough to contain the right wing propaganda or to defend Hillary.  Even Obama didn't do enough to defend himself from the right wing lies about Obamacare that lost us the House in 2010 and brought the implementation of his agenda to a virtual halt.
947244918908612609 2017-12-30 23:16:02 UTC <Vva10967> @Millennial_Dems @KaivanShroff @glendablue And her Joining Forces initiative was discontinued by Trump, you know, the guy who "loves the troops" Unfortunately Obama allowed Fox News to play in military bases and that probably accounts for why any military service person would vote for Trump or the GOP.
947244257055854592 2017-12-30 23:13:24 UTC <Vva10967> @Millennial_Dems @KaivanShroff @glendablue The Media also ignored Michelle's Reach Higher initiative launched in 2014 to encourage every student in America to pursue higher education and her Let Girls Learn initiative launched in 2015 to help adolescent girls worldwide obtain a quality education.
947243477171097600 2017-12-30 23:10:18 UTC <Vva10967> @Millennial_Dems @KaivanShroff @glendablue Basically the media focused on Michelle's Lets Move initiative (exercise) and her Partnership for a Healthier America (healthier meals for kids).  It ignored her Joining Forces initiative where she mobilized corporate America to retrain, recruit and hire returning military.
947242041863495685 2017-12-30 23:04:36 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @SenSanders @DNC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @keltickaty @urmadz @drdiegomyego @Cliff_M85 @JSException Yeah, just like those who didn't stop Hitler in Germany. They too were as responsible as Hitler for the millions he murdered. Trump is no different. You all knew that he was deranged and full of hate.  It's not like he hid it during the campaign.
947240993883123712 2017-12-30 23:00:26 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @SenSanders @DNC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @keltickaty @JSException @urmadz @drdiegomyego then YOU @Cliff_M85 are 1 of the 7MM RESPONSIBLE for EVERYTHING that Trump brings along. YOU KNEW BETTER. And made it about YOU. Let's hope he doesn't nuke millions, because he CAN and has never had any morals or empathy.  I find 3rd party voters like you REPULSIVE to be honest.
946993534808272896 2017-12-29 06:37:07 UTC <Vva10967> @Millennial_Dems @KaivanShroff @glendablue Actually she did a lot for the troops, and for getting kids to go on to higher education. Its more that the media chose to focus on her Lets Move and her Healthy Meals initiatives.
946991611745054720 2017-12-29 06:29:29 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @SenSanders @DNC @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @keltickaty @JSException @urmadz @drdiegomyego @Cliff_M85 Actually you Berners made Trumps presidency possible with your 3rd Party votes. He didnt have enough voters to win. Had the Left united to defeat him we would have a great POTUS, a competent Cabinet, criminal justice reform, DACA, left leaning judges filling court vacancies etc
946958931343101952 2017-12-29 04:19:37 UTC <Vva10967> @JoeNBC No, "Congress" has not been heartless towards our American brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico. REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS AND TRUMP have.  STOP THE FALSE EQUIVALENCIES. THE PARTIES ARE NOT THE SAME.
946885851254087680 2017-12-29 23:29:13 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko and they (NYT & WaPo) never clarified that Clinton Cash was financed by Steve Bannon & the Mercers. Hillary should have sued Peter Schweizer and Fox.
946644562335977472 2017-12-28 07:30:26 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @nytmike Its not the Russian inquiry, its him that makes us look bad. He would know if he flipped the channel to anything other than Fox. He is living in a Fox propaganda bubble.
946511810034851841 2017-12-28 22:42:55 UTC <Vva10967> @https @davidaxelrod This assumes his followers made him POTUS and that is NOT true. It was the BernieBros & Bernettes voting 3rd Party in the swing states to avenge their Messiah that made Trumps Presidency possible. Had the Left united to stop him, @HillaryClinton would be POTUS.
946295430568120320 2017-12-28 08:23:06 UTC <Vva10967> @renato_mariotti Tried??? How do you know they didnt succeed ? DHS assumes the voting machines werent penetrated but hasnt examined any to be sure. Its like they dont want to know.
945776222881148928 2017-12-26 21:59:57 UTC <Vva10967> @KatyTurNBC Not really. The people who made Trumps POTUS were the BernieBros and Bernettes who voted 3rd party in the swing states to make @HillaryClinton pay for having defeated their Messiah in the primary. He didnt have enough voters to get elected.
945775513418813440 2017-12-26 21:57:08 UTC <Vva10967> @NatashaBertrand Do all these Republican old geezers have dementia? Is it exacerbated by watching Fox all day? Sure seems so!
945107000387604480 2017-12-24 01:40:42 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump That's Obama's legacy.  Yours started when you signed the Trump Tax Scam.  If and when it tanks the economy you inherited from Obama, it's on you. And you can't declare bankruptcy like you did with your private businesses.
945030981202915329 2017-12-24 20:38:38 UTC <Vva10967> @ByronJohnson32 @Amy_Siskind @savannastc Theyre still not good at playing the political theater and speaking with one voice and staying on message.
945030615979741185 2017-12-24 20:37:11 UTC <Vva10967> @ByronJohnson32 @Amy_Siskind @savannastc They could play hardball and call out the treason by Trump & by their Republican colleagues. They still speak of bipartisanship after Mitch stole Obamas SCOTUS seat and told them to fuck off in drafting the Trump Tax Scam.
945029346330316800 2017-12-24 20:32:08 UTC <Vva10967> @benjaminwittes @Jinxy_Minxy @KathyMBI @mzjkbee Its white resentment and misogyny that drives them. Their hate of Obama and Hillary, of immigrants, of blacks, of Muslims, and of a world that is now accepting of LGBT people.
945028619029630976 2017-12-24 20:29:15 UTC <Vva10967> @benjaminwittes @Jinxy_Minxy @KathyMBI Or the help of the 7 million who voted third party particularly in the swing states.
944996811382706176 2017-12-24 18:22:51 UTC <Vva10967> @JeffFlake your votes prove that YOU ARE WITH TRUMP. You've ENABLED HIM. You voted FOR repealing Obamacare and kicking off MILLIONS of Americans off healthcare. You voted FOR the Trump Tax Scam. You voted to confirm Trump's unqualified nominees to the Cabinet & to the Judiciary.https://twitter.com/SocialPowerOne1/status/944969758952312832
944979576597417984 2017-12-24 17:14:22 UTC <Vva10967> @BarackObama @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SubodhChandra @linda_lindylou @NativeTexan74 @billyjoecain No, Dem policies are in the right place & the parties are NOT the same.  Problem is Dems allow demagogues to trash them for their own political gain. They lost the 1000 seats because Obama was too busy saving the economy to pay attention to the GOP's RedState Project.
944966646346780672 2017-12-24 16:22:59 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Because they are not. You didnt have enough voters to make you POTUS. @SenSanders followers made you POTUS by voting third party in the swing states to punish @HillaryClinton for defeating their hero in the primary.
944935634896113664 2017-12-24 14:19:46 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh Im going to miss your conversations with @JoyAnnReid on @amjoyshow. @MSNBC should have cancelled @hughhewitt instead. When will they understand that if we wanted right wing propaganda we would watch Faux instead? 
944251613119643648 2017-12-22 17:01:42 UTC <Vva10967> @marcorubio mmmm, that's your ENTIRE PARTY, the party formerly known as the Republican Party, now the Party of Trump.
944250587968888832 2017-12-22 16:57:38 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @cenkuygur and @mtaibbi could have been twins in 2000! Their writings are indistinguishable. They were male chauvinist Aholes then and were male chauvinist Aholes during the 2016 election.  They too bear responsibility for Trump, who is an older version of them.
944246320122023936 2017-12-22 16:40:40 UTC <Vva10967> That's what happens when you back a racist conman.https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/944198851690409984
944245656071307266 2017-12-22 16:38:02 UTC <Vva10967> @NYGovCuomo @tomholmes2016 @Hershell_Bryant @DickyMcgeesacks No they don't. They allow free-loaders to choose the party's nominee and to hijack the nomination, like it happened with Sheriff Clarke in WI. You can still vote in the general. If you want to vote in the primary, NOTHING prevents you from joining a party, it's free. Your choice.
944244759039827968 2017-12-22 16:34:28 UTC <Vva10967> @NYGovCuomo @tomholmes2016 They're disenfranchised by choice.  It doesn't cost anything to register as a Republican or as a Democrat.
944096837740396544 2017-12-21 06:46:41 UTC <Vva10967> @mrsmaris Sirota has been a Hillary hater for far longer than that.
944094333388681216 2017-12-21 06:36:44 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @pastormarkburns Pastor I have to assume you are an atheist because you have no fear of burning in Hell for all eternity when you die. And unlike Trump YOU have read the Bible!
944089461712982018 2017-12-21 06:17:22 UTC <Vva10967> @BarackObama @ValerieJarrett @VanJones68 And @HillaryClinton as POTUS could have continued Obamas work and enacted criminal justice reform but too many on the Far Left were more interested in bringing her down & making her pay for defeating Bernie and elected Trump with their 3rd Party votes in the swing states.
944087908801220609 2017-12-21 06:11:12 UTC <Vva10967> @PreetBharara can Nunes be charged with obstruction of justice?https://twitter.com/tburages/status/944065180098539520
944082961074458624 2017-12-21 05:51:32 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines Yet she could have stopped Comey after his July 5 press conf and/or  before his Oct 28th letter and didnt. Now we have Trump.  Im pretty sure Holder would have stopped him.
944062841388232704 2017-12-21 04:31:35 UTC <Vva10967> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson JFC. Are all Republicans stupid morons like @realDonaldTrump??? Has anyone told you that Russia sells us Uranium because we dont have enough deposits in the US and that it is used to power nuclear ENERGY plants that make electricity and not bombs??? 
944058021017280513 2017-12-21 04:12:26 UTC <Vva10967> @Acosta Do they realize they just took Christ out of Christmas??? 
943742209828032512 2017-12-20 07:17:31 UTC <Vva10967> @TheDemocrats @Lawrence @BCFoltz @JoyAnnReid @nunya_binnis @jimjamescomey The GOP will also likely try to privatize the VA in 2019 which wont go over well with vets. Trumps undiagnosed Alzheimers will get worse. The rural states will see their economies suffer come Jan 1st 2018 when Mexico stops buying its corn wheat and soy from the US. Not good.
943740419413889024 2017-12-20 07:10:24 UTC <Vva10967> @TheDemocrats @Lawrence @BCFoltz @JoyAnnReid @nunya_binnis @jimjamescomey By 2019 his support should be in the 20s and if Dems control both Houses of Congress they can reign him in. The sequester cuts to Medicare and Medicaid will have kicked in, there is no money left for infrastructure & the deficit will have ballooned because trickle down is a myth.
943737634534412288 2017-12-20 06:59:20 UTC <Vva10967> @Lawrence @JoyAnnReid @tizlock @Kjerstieb They internalized the philosophy of Ayn Rand and never outgrew it.
943736874220343302 2017-12-20 06:56:19 UTC <Vva10967> @TheDemocrats @Lawrence @BCFoltz @JoyAnnReid @nunya_binnis @jimjamescomey However Dems wont have veto proof majorities, at least not in the Senate even with a blue wave, so unless both Trump and Pence get impeached for collusion with Russia in 2019, the earliest the Trump Tax Scam can be repealed and replaced is 2021.
943694589717725184 2017-12-20 04:08:17 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @BobKerns Which is why we need to get control of the Senate in 2018 as well. AZ will have 2 seats open. In NV Heller is a goner, NE will be very unhappy with its economy come Jan 1st when Mexico stops buying its corn & other crops & TN and TX could turn into the next AL.
943630500257849344 2017-12-20 23:53:37 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @BobKerns No. The Speaker will not be a Republican in 2019.
943613843875430402 2017-12-20 22:47:26 UTC <Vva10967> @johnastoehr On what theory do you know?
943554391969353729 2017-12-20 18:51:12 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes @SpryGuy You're generalizing. Not all private schools are religious and most do a good job educating their students in math and science and civics. If you had to ban something for the good of the country it should be Citizens United and the Republican Party.
943549512261472256 2017-12-20 18:31:48 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @BobKerns it will, if it happens in 2019 and Pence goes down with Trump too.
943548835019874307 2017-12-20 18:29:07 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes @SpryGuy No, that's extreme. They simply should not be subsidized by taxpayers.
943543147132522496 2017-12-20 18:06:31 UTC <Vva10967>  The terrifying Trump robot, but with his actual speeches dubbed over ithttps://twitter.com/i/moments/943263153181179904
943396688919781376 2017-12-20 08:24:32 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill That must be why @HillaryClinton sells out every event she speaks at and gets standing ovations everywhere she goes & why thousands choose to wait in line for hours in the cold  just to say say hi to her & get their books signed. 
943394322480881666 2017-12-20 08:15:08 UTC <Vva10967> @RevDrBarber @RobinCook @RileyRae58 @JuneBuggieRants With all due respect this nonsense that the parties are the same and the purity tests are what put the GOP in charge and made Trump POTUS. God knows how much of their damage to our country well be able to reverse.
943382507348811777 2017-12-19 07:28:11 UTC <Vva10967> @RepBobGibbs You'll tank the economy and bring us another Great Depression, but hey, YOUR donors, the Kochs and the Mercers, are happy.  They got THEIR Return On Invesment.
943379822335623168 2017-12-19 07:17:31 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein @joshfoxfilm @QuinnsHere @SarcasmStardust Yet YOU enabled Trump by not voting or by voting 3rd party. The choice was always binary.  If you didn't vote for Hillary YOU directly or indirectly made Trump POTUS. WHAT DO YOU THINK HE IS DOING IN THE MIDDLE EAST? He is KILLING THOUSANDS of civilians. Because he's a SOCIOPATH.
943021621916336128 2017-12-18 07:34:09 UTC <Vva10967> @Amy_Siskind @MeganSutherlin @JW4Resistance @fotoeffex @MadmanIke @yesimrite Trump is a con artist.  Always has been, always will be. His fellow New Yorkers know him well and hate him. They also know his opponent @HillaryClinton well and voted overwhelmingly for her. She would have been a great POTUS.
942939462178353158 2017-12-18 02:07:41 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill At least the Speaker will be a Democrat when Trump & Pence get impeached.  And that's the only way the House impeaches Trump. GOP continues to put Party over Country. #TreasonousGOP (Dems should make HRC Speaker in 2019. She's our legit POTUS )
942937550834069504 2017-12-18 02:00:05 UTC <Vva10967> @TheRichWilkins No, that was Bernie who convinced his young followers that Hillary was a "corporate whore" and that the primary was "rigged". Trump took Bernie's words and used them against Hillary. She lost by 78,000 votes in 3 states, 3rd party idiots who wanted her 2 pay for defeating Bernie.
942935082255478784 2017-12-18 01:50:17 UTC <Vva10967> @TVietor08 The Karma is strong with @HillaryClinton.  She didn't deserve any of what was done to her to derail her presidency.
942871286182825984 2017-12-18 21:36:46 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @Acosta it also doesn't mention that Trump's budget CUTS Amtrak's budget to fix those tracks.
942841851110883329 2017-12-18 19:39:49 UTC <Vva10967> @SpeakerRyan @SenBobCorker @ajmeader @davidsirota A senile @OrrinHatch wrote that complicated provision??? His staff have to tell him where he is, what day it is and what time it is. 
942838713175986177 2017-12-18 19:27:20 UTC <Vva10967> @BillKristol Dont give him any ideas!
942838116624330752 2017-12-18 19:24:58 UTC <Vva10967> @Acosta Because @realDonaldTrump is a sociopath.
942833254155120640 2017-12-18 19:05:39 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Your Tax Scam assures that there will be NO MONEY left for infrastructure. Do you plan to put another trillion dollar on the credit card?
942641523119808512 2017-12-17 06:23:47 UTC <Vva10967> @TomPerez @amjoyshow You also need to combat the nonsense fed by Bernie to Millenials to push HIS agenda & fundraise for Our Revolution that the 2 parties are the same. They're NOT. It's a LIE. Call it out. One (the Dem Party) cares & protects, the other (GOP) is greedy & serves only the top 1%.
942638763037155333 2017-12-17 06:12:49 UTC <Vva10967> @TomPerez @amjoyshow Also, push should be to make ALL states hold PRIMARIES, not caucuses & count PRIMARY if they hold both eg. WA. And why penalize blue states like NY for having closed primaries when NY DETERMINES if the Democratic nominee for POTUS becomes POTUS or not? Dems cant reach 270 w/o NY.
942637593870635008 2017-12-17 06:08:10 UTC <Vva10967> @TomPerez @amjoyshow If non-Democrats are going to be allowed to choose OUR nominees, what is the point of joining the party? I can have my cake and eat it too under the Unity's proposals. Nothing in Life is Free. When you make it free, it is not valued.
942535468155064321 2017-12-17 23:22:21 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilipRucker Was the tip the name of a CIA spy at the Kremlin?
942231358503641088 2017-12-16 03:13:56 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @SteveKornacki @amjoyshow I would bet that EVERY GOP seat in CA, NY & NJ will flip in 2018 if the GOP Tax Scam becomes law. The income brackets that vote Republican in those states WILL get a SIGNIFICANT TAX INCREASE with the repeal of the State Tax Deduction & the income limit'n on the Healthcare Ded'n.
942230994953883648 2017-12-16 03:12:29 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump: look, youre the most hated POTUS ever!https://twitter.com/rawstory/status/942207745222115333

942115207408685056 2017-12-16 19:32:23 UTC <Vva10967> @AndyRichter @CNN and the MSM don't want to acknowledge the role THEY played in making Trump POTUS. They also don't want to acknowledge that 62MM people voted for a racist & sexual predator, either because they shared his views or because they lacked morals to care about his views.
942114102121582592 2017-12-16 19:28:00 UTC <Vva10967> @tribelaw You're assuming it's insecurity. What if it's guilt? What if the Steele Dossier is true? How do you explain that Trump didn't lose his wealth in the 1990s after all his businesses went belly up or even in the 2008 financial crisis when he was heavily invested in mortgages and RE?
942112920221245440 2017-12-16 19:23:18 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @marceelias do you think it's possible to get (via FOIA) the emails of the NY FBI agents working on the Weiner case and/or of the IC IG related to his decision to refer the emails matter to the FBI? All these should show a bias against @HillaryClinton .https://twitter.com/JohnCornyn/status/942055255516344320
941914578153279488 2017-12-15 06:15:10 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Which is why the Trump Tax Scam is a recipe for a Great Depression. He is increasing taxes on the people in the states responsible for 2/3 of our countrys GDP.
941913197451337729 2017-12-15 06:09:40 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Most people dont know about his women fantasize about being raped by 3 men essay or about the one where he says they get cancer due to lack of orgasms or that children should touch each others genitalia.
941908991013203969 2017-12-15 05:52:57 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @CWayneBull @susi_debra @hdot42 We can stop Trump by taking the House and Senate in 2018 and the GOP as a whole by taking the governorships and legislatures too. 2018 is a huge election year.
941864857351131136 2017-12-15 02:57:35 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines lol, whenever I see "Slanders" my mind jumps to Bernie Slanders and all the lies he told his followers about Hillary. His lies are the reason we have Trump in the White House.
941861877528846336 2017-12-15 02:45:45 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko Karma is a bitch. The @NewYorkFBI and @JamesComeyFBI made @realDonaldTrump POTUS & now he is turning on them.  @HillaryClinton could have gone after the @FBI after Comey violated every DOJ rule during his July 5th press conference but didn't because she respects the institution.
941401215535108096 2017-12-14 20:15:14 UTC <Vva10967> @AjitPaiFCC seems that your staff needs a shakeup... badly.https://twitter.com/juddlegum/status/941354380049223681
941354049286426624 2017-12-14 17:07:49 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko I know @HillaryClinton is not litigious but Tom Fitton and Judicial Watch have been harrassing the Clintons for over 20 years, non-stop, I think it'd money well spent to sue them for damages and for an injunction to cease and desist. Fitton's fixation with HRC crosses the line.
941351687931006977 2017-12-14 16:58:26 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko I don't buy it. I think he knows he colluded with Russia and that the claims in the Steele Dossier ARE true. The press is very afraid to go there and entertain the notion that he committed TREASON.
941350796591075330 2017-12-14 16:54:54 UTC <Vva10967> @NewYorkFBI this didn't turn out too well, uh?  President @HillaryClinton would never in a million years have gone after the @FBI because unlike Trump she respects the law. @JamesComeyFBI I have to wonder if the nation will survive the consequences of your Oct 28 letter.https://twitter.com/RVAwonk/status/941191170180501504
941060660284350464 2017-12-13 21:42:00 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald You expect the man who stole Obamas SCOTUS appointment because he could and lowered the vote required to confirm SCOTUS justices to 51 to get Gorsuch in to do the right thing now?  @SenMajLdr has shown us who he is. We should believe him.
940833315237527552 2017-12-12 06:38:36 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @Alfree7619 Actually she was in Portland, OR, on her book tour before a crowd of cheering fans. So even better.
940457155848736768 2017-12-11 05:43:53 UTC <Vva10967> @yottapoint Good thing Karma hit @RyanLizza
940108173066821632 2017-12-10 06:37:09 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @VABVOX Only if Dems control both The House and Senate after 2018. Otherwise GOP will do a repeat of their fake outrage and abusive investigations into her emails, server and Benghazi to bring her down.
939944000974475270 2017-12-10 19:44:47 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @TheDemocrats @AlasscanIsBack @OHenryHernandez Also Chuck Todds wife worked for Bernies campaign & got paid over $1.34 million.
939943392821350400 2017-12-10 19:42:22 UTC <Vva10967> @TheDemocrats @AlasscanIsBack @OHenryHernandez Its not the Democrats, its the media, the male pundits in the MSM to be exact. Have to wonder about Chuck Todd. He fits the profile of Matt Lauer, Mark Halperin, Charlie Rose, Glenn Thrush etc who were misogynist to @HillaryClinton & had skeletons in their closets.
939772338291331073 2017-12-10 08:22:40 UTC <Vva10967> @Zebop Lets keep it that way. Bernie is the kiss of death for the candidacies if the people he endorses. 
939044195062267905 2017-12-08 08:09:17 UTC <Vva10967> @GOP @Remy_Anne Maybe hes hoping that Putin will order his hackers to hack the voting machines in Alabama?
939040268812107778 2017-12-07 07:53:41 UTC <Vva10967> @PressSec @ElizLanders Good for @repjohnlewis who has called from the beginning Trumps illegitimacy as POTUS.
938628229363052544 2017-12-06 04:36:23 UTC <Vva10967> @alfranken Do NOT resign.  We need you. And this has Roger Stone written ALL OVER IT.  Media & Dems are again playing FALSE EQUIVALENCY GAME.  That brought down Hillary & gave us Trump. Don't let false equivalencies bring you down too.  @DNC @SenSchumer @TomPerezhttps://twitter.com/TomArnold/status/938600824866881536
938491890789470209 2017-12-06 19:34:37 UTC <Vva10967> @SenFeinstein It's clear that you guys in the Senate have a double standard when the Republicans are electing a PEDOPHILE to the Senate and NO ONE will hold the Pussy-Grabber-In-Chief that inhabits the White House accountable for his sexual assaults and alleged child rape because it's too soon
938491352681197568 2017-12-06 19:32:29 UTC <Vva10967> @SenBobCasey So you'll ask @alfranken to resign without an investigation into the truth of the allegations against him but you won't call on Trump's impeachment because "It's too soon" and "we need facts"???  Give me a break! Dems need to fight like Republicans and stop caving!!!
938306984335593473 2017-12-05 07:19:52 UTC <Vva10967> Is this like Trump University? https://twitter.com/thesandersinst/status/938155757618499584

938258948507004928 2017-12-05 04:08:59 UTC <Vva10967> @MalcolmNance @PartPhil @carolealana The press certainly should.
938258504300814336 2017-12-05 04:07:14 UTC <Vva10967> @RepStevenSmith I have watched the video. Have you?
938254029024620545 2017-12-05 03:49:27 UTC <Vva10967> @BenSasse Mmmm no. There is right and there is wrong and your Party supporting a pedophile for Senator is morally wrong. #GOPSupportsPedophiles
938240527765594117 2017-12-05 02:55:48 UTC <Vva10967> @RepStevenSmith She didnt. Unless YOU are jumping to the conclusion that all gang members are black? Because THAT is who she said were super predators. #GOPSupportsPedophiles
937950569989398528 2017-12-04 07:43:36 UTC <Vva10967> @SenFeinstein Maybe Utah should stop voting Republican. The parties are NOT alike. That is propaganda used by Mr. Sanders to grow his own PAC.
937949001940381696 2017-12-04 07:37:22 UTC <Vva10967> @MalcolmNance @PartPhil @carolealana No. Its My New Order. Still by Hitler. His then wife Ivanna said in 1991 to Vanity Fair that Trump kept a copy by his night table. Its available on google. We should probably all read it to see what comes next in his playbook.

937590685192130560 2017-12-03 07:53:33 UTC <Vva10967> @CapehartJ Loved your interview of @HillaryClinton. One of the best. Also loved the one you did of Donna Brazile.

937579450455248896 2017-12-03 07:08:55 UTC <Vva10967> @FBIAgentsAssoc In retrospect, intervening in the 2016 election to screw @HillaryClinton & elect Trump was not a great idea, uh? Hillary has respect for law enforcement, govt institutions & for the law. Trump does not. Never has, never will & at 71 yo he wont change.
937457930680619009 2017-12-03 23:06:02 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes @realmadpip @Vickybayless It was 62 million plus 7 million a-holes who knew better but wanted to punish HRC for defeating their messiah. Thats a lot of a-holes.
937218663555522560 2017-12-02 07:15:16 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Since you lie so much you should know. Your nickname should be Lying Donald or Don The Con.

He couldnt convince the Dem base to vote for him. What makes you think the Trumpers would have voted for a commie?  Plus Putin wouldve hacked his emails & put them on Wikileaks. And Bernies rape essays would have been widely discussed
937057924534489093 2017-12-02 20:36:33 UTC <Vva10967> @IAMDJLIVE Somebody is playing games with @realDonaldTrump They probably put the cockroaches, mice and ants there on January 20th.  Or he brought them from Trump Tower!  That place (Trump Tower) is OLD and hasn't been refurbished or redecorated since the 1990s.

937046712241319938 2017-12-02 19:52:00 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM Bullshit. He wants to be able to say that he fought for the Dreamers because he wants to run for POTUS in 2020. He's as bad as the rest of his party, the Party of Trump and other sexual assaulters and pedophiles.
936868999941332992 2017-12-02 08:05:50 UTC <Vva10967> @OrrinHatch @SenatorFischer @tedcruz @DeanHeller @ALT_DOJ @houndmom @emerald_aly Hatch is retiring. Already announced it. Romney is considering running for that seat. Best bet to get to 51 in 2018 are NV (Heller) and AZ. There will be 2 seats in AZ.

936730681543192576 2017-12-01 22:56:12 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 @SenFranken should resign ONLY AFTER the Pussy-Grabber-In-Chief resigns.  @realDonaldTrump has 16 women accuse him of sexual assault and 1 woman accuse him of child rape.  Press was too busy with Hillary's emails to investigate, especially the child rape case filed in court.

The CIA took the position that the existence of its drones program was classified even though the reason Hillary and 300 other high level diplomats & State Dept & WH staff were discussing it was because NY Times kept printing front page stories about it. 
936395363459784704 2017-11-30 00:43:46 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro Conyers is being pushed out by Dem leadership. Looks like the only 2 left are Trump and Moore. Both Republican. The rapist and the pedophile. Maybe you should rethink what you still have left in common with your party?

I think that given the new wave of zero tolerance, Bernie should be asked about the women fantasize about being raped by 3 men & similar essays he wrote in his 30s. Unlike Bill Clintons affairs, Bernies essays havent been investigated AT ALL.
936037820938022913 2017-11-29 01:03:01 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon @TruNewsNet Plus starting on Jan 1st 2018 Mexico stops buying its corn wheat rice and soy from the USA, hurting the rural states that voted for him. #karma
936037161664688128 2017-11-29 01:00:24 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon @TruNewsNet Bet Trump will make Ws 2008 Recession look good. He is currently riding Obamas economy since he hasnt passed any laws. Once he passes his Trump Tax Scam, the economy will start diving and fast because hes raising taxes on the states responsible for 2/3 of USAs GDP.

But you wouldn't know that. You believe all the memes and nonsense that Bernie fed you to get your $27 and all the nonsense and urban legends that Russia fed you.
935736814291292160 2017-11-28 05:06:56 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @lariti2 @Bernadette96 @MeMe23 @studiohq @Allon2324 No she lost because at least 78000 idiots like you in 3 swing states believed the memes the Russians fed you. Youre extremely easy to manipulate because you grew up believing memes and empty logos from false prophets who have never accomplished anything in life.
935733155436400641 2017-11-28 04:52:23 UTC <Vva10967> @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @realDonaldTrump You realize that YOUR own use of your cellphone during the transition endangered national security a hundred times more than Hillarys emails ever did and that youll be prosecuted for it by the next POTUS? #LockHIMUp
935694232492363776 2017-11-28 02:17:44 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh If tomorrow Trump were to say that the Earth is Flat, the cable shows would run segments asking, is he right? is the earth flat? why is he saying that the earth is flat? instead of calling it what it is, a LIE. Just like the "Obama wiretapped me" nonsense.
935693765083312128 2017-11-28 02:15:52 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh The cable news shows do the same thing with Trump's claim that the Access Hollywood video isn't real. They refuse to call it what it is: a LIE. And on top of that. they go on and on entertaining whatever nonsense comes out of his mouth!

934668927996702721 2017-11-25 06:23:32 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump You are SOOOOOO gullible!!!  Is it age? Alzheimers? Some other form of dementia?
934667409306390528 2017-11-25 06:17:30 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid I sure hope you are right. Karma needs to hit him hard.
934557428372426754 2017-11-25 23:00:28 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill Because @realDonaldTrump knows that no matter how ridiculous his claims are, the main stream media wont call it out for what it is: a LIE. You actually give it a headline that suggests his ludicrous claim is plausible. It isnt.
933953951292116992 2017-11-23 07:02:28 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill seriously HillaryClinton should sue this loser. Make him pay. Will be money well spent. And she can even donate the proceeds to Onward Together if she wishes to.https://twitter.com/dbongino/status/933871009333170177
933952213017341952 2017-11-23 06:55:34 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill Why doesnt @HillaryClinton just sue him?  If he was never assigned to her it should be a slam dunk case. Times v Sullivan doesnt even come into play. And really, thats the only way these right wing POS are going to stop making stuff up about her.
933600812881907712 2017-11-22 07:39:13 UTC <Vva10967> @jack @Twitter @PhilippeReines Actually @facebook I would like to see ALL the ads displayed on a page with a disclosure of how many likes and shares each got.

932494843707879424 2017-11-19 06:24:30 UTC <Vva10967> @tomwatson @al_arthofer Maybe when your taxes go up and grad students cant pay the taxes theyll be charged for their scholarships and Obamacare disintegrates and Trump plunges us into a Great Depression with his tax and trade policies youll feel energized uh?
932140318136381445 2017-11-18 06:55:44 UTC <Vva10967> Hey Berners, hope youre enjoying the Trump era since your stupid third party protest votes in the swing states got us here.

931400732426858496 2017-11-16 05:56:53 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Obviously you have no clue what is in your Republican tax bill. You even screw New Yorkers and New Jersians taking away the state tax deduction. But YOU get anywhere between a BILLION and FOUR BILLION out of your tax bill depending on how rich you really are.
930913336933351427 2017-11-15 21:40:09 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @Shareblue @CaryNovak Thats Fox bullshit. Facts are facts. Even in the Trump era.
930912991029186560 2017-11-15 21:38:47 UTC <Vva10967> @chelseahandler The third party protest voters in the swing states made him POTUS. Because they chose to make it about them and not about US and the country. Trump didnt have enough voters to win.
930912385724018688 2017-11-15 21:36:22 UTC <Vva10967> @frodofied @SethAbramson Trump knows THEY know hes really STUPID.
930890417201180674 2017-11-15 20:09:05 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @Shareblue @CaryNovak Neither us nor the Russians are making nuclear bombs anymore. We both have thousands of warheads stockpiled to blow up the world. Fox just feeds your ignorance.
930889935267225600 2017-11-15 20:07:10 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @Shareblue @CaryNovak In fact, we don't have enough uranium in our mines to meet our power plant needs so we have agreements WITH RUSSIA to IMPORT uranium to meet our deficit, ie. RUSSIA SELLS US THE URANIUM WE NEED.  And the uranium that the mine that was sold makes CANNOT BE EXPORTED.
930889250345816065 2017-11-15 20:04:27 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @Shareblue @CaryNovak What scandal? It was a routine CFIUS review of the sale of a Canadian company that happened to have a small uranium mine in the US.  We use that uranium for nuclear FUEL at our nuclear power plants, to make ELECTRICITY, NOT to make bombs.
930715659234922496 2017-11-15 08:34:39 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Hey bozo, wrong shooting! There are so many now that youre mixing them up! Yet you refuse to do anything about them because YOURE SCARED of the NRA!
930322845011464194 2017-11-13 06:33:45 UTC <Vva10967> @marceelias Also the media acts as if Trump had enough voters to elect him POTUS when reason he won is that Bernie convinced his followers that the primary was unfair to him & they in turn CHOSE to cast 3rd party protest votes in swing states to punish @HillaryClinton, thus electing Trump.
930264780438491138 2017-11-13 02:43:01 UTC <Vva10967> @NBCNews So we are now officially a third world country run by a dictator?

929223333366960128 2017-11-10 05:44:41 UTC <Vva10967> @MMFlint @RealTimers @SenSanders was promising ponies. Like Trump he had no F'g idea how to deliver the ponies but hey, he sounded authentic to you. And that is why the Rustbelt, Appalachia and the South are hurting, because those areas keep voting for authentic bozos who can't fix sh*t.
929222511128141824 2017-11-10 05:41:25 UTC <Vva10967> @MMFlint @RealTimers I'm tired of the bullshit that all of you pundits spew of wanting to elect a BOZO as POTUS because you can have a beer with him, and passing on the fucking brilliant candidate who can make our country prosperous, fair & truly great because she doesn't seem "authentic" to you. 
929221278355132416 2017-11-10 05:36:31 UTC <Vva10967> @MMFlint @RealTimers Actually in 2020 we'll need someone who's fucking brilliant to rebuild the federal government that Trump is decimating AND if the GOP tax cuts pass, also the US economy. Right now Trump is riding the Obama economy. The GOP tax increase on the 99% & on blue states will tank it.
929219227269128192 2017-11-10 05:28:22 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes I suggest you talk to @JoeConason and have him walk you through pages 60-66 of his book where he goes into detail on the Juanita story.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312245475/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_5?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A2ENLOCYXEFS31

928893414514528257 2017-11-09 07:53:42 UTC <Vva10967> @Truthbuster @RWPUSA Maybe a left wing billionaire can buy @CNN and return it to being the news network it was instead of the entertainment network that Jeff Zucker has turned it into. And he needs to go or stay back with Time Warner.

928833869121507328 2017-11-09 03:57:05 UTC <Vva10967> @TVietor08 The media does the exact same thing with Bernie Sanders for the Left.
928774160184217601 2017-11-09 23:59:50 UTC <Vva10967> @daveweigel Republicans haven't dumped Moore. They've been qualifying their replies with "IF the allegations are true, THEN he should step down." So no, Menendez should stay on at least until January, when Governor Murphy can appoint a Democrat to fill his seat.

926676503278051329 2017-11-03 05:04:29 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @TulsiGabbard @janekleeb @NomikiKonst @ninaturner @Jehmu @mydakini He was a man over 30 when he wrote it. A bum that stole electricity from his neighbor, but still an adult. And his other essays are similar.
926666448872886273 2017-11-03 04:24:32 UTC <Vva10967> A great thread from Joy Reid.https://twitter.com/JoyAnnReid/status/926329971588714496
926658641448534016 2017-11-03 03:53:31 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamSerwer I wouldnt say half. Its the Fox viewers, the Breitbart readers and the Limbaugh and InfoWars followers.
926645740704796672 2017-11-03 03:02:15 UTC <Vva10967> @AP @HillaryClinton @Jehmu @JimTragos @GrassrootsJill Nop. You Berners are as bad as the Trumpers at making up your own facts. He lost the primary on March 15. It was NEVER close. #Landslide
926331532486283264 2017-11-02 06:13:42 UTC <Vva10967> @pattonoswalt @clbirds @kimtcga @mhodson520 @alihatch @apeirophobic It wasnt an appearance. Bernie was mathematically eliminated on March 15. He knew it but kept milking you all for those $27 til June.
926330869287137280 2017-11-02 06:11:04 UTC <Vva10967> @pattonoswalt @clbirds @kimtcga @mhodson520 @alihatch @apeirophobic Nop. We simply didnt like his ponies and unicorns and we LOVED the Brilliant Woman with real plans to tackle Americas problems.

926321992642461696 2017-11-02 05:35:47 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Where is DOJ? investigating YOU for violation of Campaign Finance Laws and Money Laundering, no? AND collusion with Russia AND TREASON!!!
926319876947546112 2017-11-02 05:27:23 UTC <Vva10967> @TheLeadCNN @bflysmile @JusCallMeHerb @SwankyButters @j_buks @NickRigas2 @michaelfromolg Now the party that has several active KKK members TODAY is the GOP.  Anonymous was going to out them and apparently chickened out.
926232148796952578 2017-11-02 23:38:47 UTC <Vva10967> @TheLeadCNN @bflysmile @JusCallMeHerb @michaelfromolg Maybe if you tuned out of Fox for a week you could research how much Saudi money flows into the GOP. Why do U think Trump chose to go there?
926230528348520448 2017-11-02 23:32:21 UTC <Vva10967> @DNC @donnabrazile @JoyAnnReid Hillary didn't need it either, she was looking ahead to the general election where having a financially bankrupt DNC would be a problem

926205615315324930 2017-11-02 21:53:21 UTC <Vva10967> @donnabrazile @HillaryClinton @NickMerrill IMO it'd be money well spent, to keep others from taking cheap shots at HRC's reputation.  There need to be consequences or it won't stop.
926204977533550592 2017-11-02 21:50:49 UTC <Vva10967> @donnabrazile @HillaryClinton @NickMerrill I think that played a role in how the MSM treated Hillary vs. how they treated Trump. They knew there'd be NO consequences for trashing HRC.
926204626227159040 2017-11-02 21:49:25 UTC <Vva10967> @donnabrazile @HillaryClinton @NickMerrill With Trump, on the other hand, everyone is so careful not to call him a LIAR even when he is LYING because they're afraid he'll sue them. 3
926204371095949315 2017-11-02 21:48:24 UTC <Vva10967> @donnabrazile @HillaryClinton @NickMerrill The MSM does it, the Clinton Cash author did it, Dinesh Souza does it, InfoWars did, Flynn Jr & Mike Cernovich did it with Pizzagate, etc. 2
926203859885846528 2017-11-02 21:46:22 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill Why doesn't @HillaryClinton just sue @donnabrazile for defamation? Seems EVERYBODY believes there are no repercussions for LYING about her.
926200308103073793 2017-11-02 21:32:16 UTC <Vva10967> @TheLeadCNN @bflysmile @JusCallMeHerb 4 million MORE people voted for Hillary than for Bernie. Bernie even wanted to CHEAT by asking Super Delegates to overturn will of voters.
926200027890020352 2017-11-02 21:31:09 UTC <Vva10967> @TheLeadCNN @bflysmile @JusCallMeHerb No one has ever cared what the DNC does or doesn't do. We vote for the candidate that appeals to us, no matter who DNC backs.
926199719608635393 2017-11-02 21:29:55 UTC <Vva10967> @TheLeadCNN @bflysmile @JusCallMeHerb Bullshit. The DNC is a FUNDRAISING arm of the Dem Party, NOT a king-making entity, except in Bernie's and his followers' minds.
926125464061710336 2017-11-02 16:34:51 UTC <Vva10967> @donnabrazile Bernie's Fundraising Agreement with DNC was signed in Nov 2015. Why isn't THAT discussed in Politico article? Did you read it?https://twitter.com/mmurraypolitics/status/926083951906689025

926107784759955456 2017-11-02 15:24:36 UTC <Vva10967> @girlsreallyrule Bernie also signed the same funding arrangement with the DNC, he just never fundraised for the DNC so he didn't utilize it.

925842238730588160 2017-11-01 21:49:25 UTC <Vva10967> @MarkWarner Will the ads be posted all together somewhere so we can see them?
925608397520633856 2017-10-31 06:20:13 UTC <Vva10967> @ChadPergram At the White House? And without the so-called President?
925529082355384320 2017-10-31 01:05:03 UTC <Vva10967> @DKElections Well somebody is running ads in PA saying are you mad at [list of things Trump is doing] then send a message by voting for Democrat judges.

924012367767326720 2017-10-27 20:38:10 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @EricLiptonNYT @maisondechienvt It's Clinton Derangement Syndrome. The @nytimes has 25 yrs covering HRC that way. She's assumed guilty of the unimaginable no matter what.

922509068673183744 2017-10-23 17:04:36 UTC <Vva10967> @ericgarland lol, any idea when this all unfolds? 2018? 2019? 2020? Do we survive or are we all killed in Trump's Nuclear Armageddon?
922346785103908866 2017-10-22 06:19:44 UTC <Vva10967> @IrisRimon Maybe hes trying to flatter Trump so hell accept his offer to go to North Korea to negotiate with Kim Jung Un?

922242405038002176 2017-10-22 23:24:58 UTC <Vva10967> @NatashaBertrand Maybe @LindseyGrahamSC should read the Steele Dossier, it's very revealing even if you leave aside the pee pee tapes. 
922210645168263173 2017-10-22 21:18:46 UTC <Vva10967> @RepWilson @amjoyshow Has anyone in the media checked the video for General Kelly sightings? Did he actually attend that FBI Building inauguration?

922125663666098183 2017-10-22 15:41:05 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko I think they should highlight more the volunteer work that Ralph Northam as MD does in rural Virginia with the Remote Area Medical clinics.

921944008800309248 2017-10-21 03:39:15 UTC <Vva10967> @NerdyWonka President Obama is so eloquent, what a huge contrast to the Orange Fuhrer.
921622827186425856 2017-10-20 06:22:59 UTC <Vva10967> @JKH2 And she is getting the award on her birthday(October 26).
921618486929055745 2017-10-20 06:05:44 UTC <Vva10967> @damonbethea1 @kylegriffin1 They only need 51 votes to be confirmed. Will Republicans put country over party? They havent yet.
921447280942690311 2017-10-20 18:45:26 UTC <Vva10967> @RepWilson @Yamiche Because she is black and a woman? That is the pattern in the Trump Administration. Why not admit that Kelly is a TRUE believer of Trumpism?
921407832108556288 2017-10-20 16:08:40 UTC <Vva10967> @RepWilson @realDonaldTrump @NewDay @CNNPolitics @vee817 @glory_janson @themisrules @AzaniaJustice @ActosNonVerba @Bionic_T_Rex And his fucking travel ban is to blame for it. Chad's armed forces were keeping our troops in Niger safe & withdrew from Niger after Sep ban
921407402636869634 2017-10-20 16:06:58 UTC <Vva10967> @RepWilson @realDonaldTrump @NewDay @CNNPolitics @vee817 @glory_janson @themisrules @AzaniaJustice @ActosNonVerba @Bionic_T_Rex Because the widow DESERVED an apology. They also fucking abandoned Sgt Johnson ALIVE and didn't find him until 2 days later #TrumpsBenghazi
921406582025486336 2017-10-20 16:03:42 UTC <Vva10967> @CandiceAiston @revlupneb Maybe Susan Sarandon identifies with leaches??? 
921404322776305664 2017-10-20 15:54:44 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon @KazeSkyz Also, they were NOT speaking prior to his death. That's a fact that should have been publicized to understand her true motives for LYING.
921401649930883072 2017-10-20 15:44:06 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump we've found the source of the Fake News: It's FOX!!!https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/921345543074394114
921396414177005569 2017-10-20 15:23:18 UTC <Vva10967> @CNNPolitics @MooreHomes1 @ZenaRo ps Blair is a Russian troll. Look at his handle. 8 numbers.

But he can NEVER apologize. #Sociopath
921395501060194304 2017-10-20 15:19:40 UTC <Vva10967> Rep. Wilson is right, Sgt. Johnson did not die "surrounded by his friends". He was left behind, alive, and found dead 2 days later.https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/921337696282345472
921259391650803712 2017-10-19 06:18:49 UTC <Vva10967> @KenDilanianNBC The @nytimes story WAS based on the Clinton Cash book financed by Bannon & the Mercers. Also look up CFIUS review. You might learn something
921257723144146952 2017-10-19 06:12:11 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon @KazeSkyz She was reading off a Teleprompter, a speech that she didnt write & whose writer later said he regretted writing.
921170614697705473 2017-10-19 00:26:03 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Trump always projects.
921168212250722304 2017-10-19 00:16:30 UTC <Vva10967> @JanzforCongress Pretty sure they were not tricked when they did it.
921069477399232512 2017-10-19 17:44:10 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Ask your White House Counsel what a CFIUS Review is. Should enlighten you. You too will be signing off on many of these.
920871434116911104 2017-10-18 04:37:13 UTC <Vva10967> @PeterAlexander we have a follow up question for the next time you see Trump.https://twitter.com/joyannreid/status/920691829900800002
920865654105833472 2017-10-18 04:14:15 UTC <Vva10967> @isteintraum They both lost their 2016 primaries bigly. Neither is the Chair of the Committees in charge of healthcare or taxes. Why should anyone care?
920864129442893825 2017-10-18 04:08:11 UTC <Vva10967> @DHSgov @tedlieu Why are naturalized US Citizens being targeted without a warrant or probable cause & the Congress says NOTHING??? @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr
920862585615986690 2017-10-18 04:02:03 UTC <Vva10967> @Kaya985 @Acosta But her Emails!!!!
920821074589372417 2017-10-18 01:17:06 UTC <Vva10967> @Yahoo @AOL @CBS @nbc @thehill @politico @ABC @AP @PBS @MSNBC @CNN @ItsNorbitPeters Try THINKING.  The right wing media has fried your brain with memes and hate.
920820837418262528 2017-10-18 01:16:10 UTC <Vva10967> @CREWcrew @joyce_tyler Only if he indicts. What Comey did to Hillary in July and later in October was unprecedented & Mueller is unlikely to go rogue like Comey.
920820385037332480 2017-10-18 01:14:22 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN Seriously CNN, why would anyone care about the opinion of 2 men who were rejected by the voters bigly in the 2016 primaries???
920819480896397312 2017-10-18 01:10:46 UTC <Vva10967> @Yahoo @AOL @CBS @nbc @thehill @politico @ABC @AP @PBS @MSNBC @CNN @ItsNorbitPeters LOL, you should lay off Fox and Breitbart!  Or maybe it's InfoWars?  Hard to tell.
920818844905635840 2017-10-18 01:08:15 UTC <Vva10967> @CREWcrew @joyce_tyler Mueller and his team don't leak. And it would be illegal to leak the tax returns. Trump has to disclose them (or be forced to via lawsuits).
920810684333539328 2017-10-18 00:35:49 UTC <Vva10967> No offense but voting third party IS how we got Trump. #NoThanks
920810164663361536 2017-10-18 00:33:45 UTC <Vva10967> @Yahoo @AOL @CBS @nbc @thehill @politico @ABC @AP @PBS @MSNBC @CNN @ItsNorbitPeters Those are cities not states, most plagued by white flight. Better comparison is KS under Brownback (disaster!) & WI & NC (voter suppression)
920807653055520769 2017-10-18 00:23:46 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @Fahrenthold Lol I was expecting you to be the reporter on this story.
920804315102511104 2017-10-18 00:10:31 UTC <Vva10967> @selectedwisdom I miss that old @Google logo of "Do No Evil".
920803436177760256 2017-10-18 00:07:01 UTC <Vva10967> @coopah 100% consistent with GOP View that Healthcare is a Privilege and NOT a Right. Until Americans vote GOP out, we'll continue to see this.
920788617244626945 2017-10-18 23:08:08 UTC <Vva10967> @planetcivic yeah, let's start with @realDonaldTrump
920787120595329024 2017-10-18 23:02:11 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilMurphyNJ @Lonegan Bullshit. The Attorney Generals of all the blue states are suing Trump Admin to stop it. #TenthAmendment
920767871432773633 2017-10-18 21:45:42 UTC <Vva10967> @CBS @ABC @CNN @nytimes @NBCNews @chucktodd @abc @cbs Turns out that trashing HRC over emails & elevating Trump for ratings has consequences for you 2https://twitter.com/SariHorwitz/status/920717217137872896
920766491385061378 2017-10-18 21:40:13 UTC <Vva10967> @ChuckGrassley @benjaminwittes was Sen Grassley being Senile or just a partisan hack? He KNOWS that was a ROUTINE CFIUS review & that there were NO grounds 2 deny approval
920762678968188928 2017-10-18 21:25:04 UTC <Vva10967> @CREWcrew @joyce_tyler Oh I'm sure Mueller has Trump's tax returns but WE the public should have them too. We got Obama's & the Clinton's & W's. Should get Trump's
920762020215054336 2017-10-18 21:22:27 UTC <Vva10967> @HouseBenghazi @HillaryClinton @Irish_Pack @4YrsToday But it will not because Republicans are traitors and put Party Over Country. #VoteThemOut
920516284290396161 2017-10-17 05:05:59 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @Irish_Pack @4YrsToday The green berets deaths would fall under DOD so Mattis & the so-called Commander In Chief should be made to testify in 2019.
920440029499011072 2017-10-17 00:02:58 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill @HillaryClinton should consider suing Breitbart for libel. They're back to their uranium nonsense. Take them down like Thiel did w Gawker?
920387626078822400 2017-10-17 20:34:44 UTC <Vva10967> @SethAbramson @GOP has no morals left. This is the party that stole SCOTUS seat & wants to cover up RussiaGate. Ryan would keep presidency for himself. 
920364743189245952 2017-10-17 19:03:48 UTC <Vva10967> @brianbeutler Media should ask Gen Kelly if it's true, just like they've been asking Tillerson if he called Trump a moron. Let's see where Kelly stands.
920364111912894466 2017-10-17 19:01:18 UTC <Vva10967> And nop, this is NOT from the National Enquirer. She's one of 5 Republicans seeking to replace GOP's @RosLehtinen when she retires in 2018!https://twitter.com/NBCLA/status/920133780849020929
920359309967491072 2017-10-17 18:42:13 UTC <Vva10967> @kaitlancollins Well, are you going to ask him?
920355936123981824 2017-10-17 18:28:49 UTC <Vva10967> @Beyerstein @benwikler why does it only require 51 votes and not 60?
920333087673847808 2017-10-17 16:58:01 UTC <Vva10967> @AC360 Too bad he didn't say that during the 2016 campaign. Seems that Republicans will only speak up if they're not running for reelection.
920160811078873088 2017-10-16 05:33:27 UTC <Vva10967> @Newsweek lol, he still believes Republicans would do the right thing! The party that STOLE a SCOTUS seat? The party that refuses to impeach Trump?
919961059699634176 2017-10-16 16:19:43 UTC <Vva10967> @20committee She was a private citizen in 2013, why would the IC have continued to give her classified briefings as a private citizen???
919949511363096576 2017-10-16 15:33:50 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 Bannon should have added: I prefer a President that my bosses, the Mercers, own.  
919947288553943040 2017-10-16 15:25:00 UTC <Vva10967> @bravenak do we know if he ever paid the money back? I recall that he charged it to his campaign?
919689901943283718 2017-10-15 22:22:14 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat She was the last thing standing between us and the Apocalypse.  He's a deranged sociopath & has no one to stop him. He might kills us all.
919689474929582080 2017-10-15 22:20:32 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat & frankly everything she told us about Trump has turned out to be true.THAT ALONE should have made people do everything possible to stop him
919689199615438848 2017-10-15 22:19:26 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat She had an extensive economic agenda. Media chose to focus on her emails bc they wanted the ratings of a horse race & never thought he'd win
919688982581178370 2017-10-15 22:18:35 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat She was going to end Reaganomics which is still in our tax code. Trump will make the tax code Reagonomics on steroids, like she warned us.
919688396230053888 2017-10-15 22:16:15 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @seenorseems Not if she had gone after him in March, after it became mathematically impossible for him to catch up to her votes & elected delegates.
919688016192589824 2017-10-15 22:14:44 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat The media created that narrative and Bernie reinforced it.  Now the media is living to regret it.  Not sure about Bernie. He likes attention
919687682086920199 2017-10-15 22:13:25 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat Hillary understood it but only discussed it in Economic forums. Should have gone mainstream w/ it. Leaving/renegotiating NAFTA can't fix it.
919687205400047616 2017-10-15 22:11:31 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat Once DE did that, every corporation reincorporated in DE in the 1990s & employees & firing them became a non-issue. It wasn't bc of NAFTA.
919686774355644416 2017-10-15 22:09:48 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat Also Delaware played a big part as it changed its corporate laws saying only constituency for Board of Dir were shareholders not employees.
919686512266051584 2017-10-15 22:08:46 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat Manufacturing jobs began leaving after Reagan reformed the Tax Code. It's the tax code that makes it advantageous to leave.
919685872697659393 2017-10-15 22:06:13 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat Both Bernie & Trump lied about NAFTA. Sure, Hillary should have debunked their lies and didn't. So that was a mistake.
919685628584964097 2017-10-15 22:05:15 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat If/when Trump exits NAFTA, his rural voters will find out that just like the ACA, NAFTA has benefited them & their states.
919685035439153153 2017-10-15 22:02:54 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat No, a lot of them chose Trump and his politics of white resentment and white supremacy. The media keeps giving his voters excuses.
919682370512543745 2017-10-15 21:52:18 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat Your hate and that of the other Bernie Bros lost her the election. And Bernie fueled it with his lies about her character.
919681971068039169 2017-10-15 21:50:43 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat Everyone who voted 3rd party IS responsible for Trump and what he has done and will continue to do to our country & to the most vulnerable.
919681765115158529 2017-10-15 21:49:54 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat The 3rd party protest vote elected Trump. It went from less than 1% in 2008 & 2012, to 5% in 2016 with the same 3rd party candidates as 2012
919681346674536448 2017-10-15 21:48:14 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat lol, sorry that if it didn't fit into a bumper sticker you and Rust Belt voters couldn't comprehend it. Would cartoons have helped? 
919676608998445057 2017-10-15 21:29:25 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger You and the other Bernie Bros elected Donald Trump POTUS with your stupid Third Party protest votes. You screwed yourselves AND Bernie.
919676234874998784 2017-10-15 21:27:55 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @seenorseems That just proves that it was a bad decision for HRC to not expose the skeletons in his closet. He'd be polling in single digits if she had.
919675610108133377 2017-10-15 21:25:26 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger @brotherbeat Yeah, after he convinced them that she was corrupt and a "corporate whore". NEVER WALKED IT BACK.
919637370928091141 2017-10-15 18:53:29 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh I think @SenFeinstein is too used to the old ways of the Senate and is too nice to Republicans.  Senate has changed for the worse.
919633270438055937 2017-10-15 18:37:12 UTC <Vva10967> @IndieWire Only sad thing is that Woody Allen is still a member of the Academy.  He too should be kicked out!
919630251285778432 2017-10-15 18:25:12 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @NoMoreNeolibs She attacked him on the issues but NOT personally. And she could have but didn't.  Wish she had. Wish WE had. He'd be polling in single # s
919629467898740738 2017-10-15 18:22:05 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @NoMoreNeolibs I was going to say that if policies mattered more than labels Trump wouldn't be POTUS, but YOU BernieBros MADE HIM POTUS w 3rd party votes!
919628930512015360 2017-10-15 18:19:57 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @NoMoreNeolibs If policies mattered more than labels, YOU & your Bernie Bros would've voted 4 Hillary who developed policies & not just slogans like Bernie
919628274380271619 2017-10-15 18:17:21 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @NoMoreNeolibs Oh he has plenty of skeletons. The GOP Dossier on him is rather thick & has video too. And if he runs in 2020, it will come out EARLY.
919427389402353665 2017-10-14 04:59:06 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger HE LOST FAIR AND SQUARE AND IN A LANDSLIDE. 4 MILLION VOTES IS NOT CLOSE AT ALL. IF HE RUNS IN 2020 HE WILL LOSE AGAIN IN A LANDSLIDE.
919426417183649796 2017-10-14 04:55:14 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger The admission you cite is a motion to dismiss->defendants lawyer says ok lets assume EVERYTHING plaintiff alleges is true, STILL NO CASE
919425348143669248 2017-10-14 04:50:59 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger He continued to milk his followers for $27 donations when it was mathematically impossible for him to catch up in votes & elected delegates.
919424925491974144 2017-10-14 04:49:18 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @LondonEconomic @razorjogger Nobody robbed him. He however robbed his followers pretending that he wasnt mathematically eliminated after March 15 and after NY.
919343392823349248 2017-10-14 23:25:20 UTC <Vva10967> @LondonEconomic Nop. He lost primary by 4 million votes. And @HillaryClinton didnt bring out the skeletons in his closet but GOP would have for sure.

918510678754889728 2017-10-12 16:16:25 UTC <Vva10967> @POTUS @NancyPelosi @Flare5699 The Republicans will let Vets go homeless with or without illegals. They hate social programs & only care about Tax Cuts for the 1%.
918336822048063489 2017-10-11 04:45:34 UTC <Vva10967> @justapedn @DonnaNoble10th @elid955 @DragonStone1963 Right now Trump should be ordering his FEMA guy to do away with the red tape. Instead Brock is ignoring the San Juan Mayor to please Trump!
918336336515526656 2017-10-11 04:43:39 UTC <Vva10967> @justapedn @DonnaNoble10th @elid955 @DragonStone1963 You can't fix what you don't understand and Trump doesn't understand basic things, including how FEMA works. He IS a moron. #Fact
918335857760890880 2017-10-11 04:41:45 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah I did. It should say that Trump is a UPenn graduate with a BS in Economics.
918334831657914369 2017-10-11 04:37:40 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah It's NOT the same thing. The Wharton prestige is derived from the BUSINESS SCHOOL SIDE. He couldn't even get into UPenn straight out of HS.
918334284280336384 2017-10-11 04:35:29 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah His degree is from UPenn. Yes, it's an Ivy League. But to get a Wharton School degree you have to be enrolled in the Wharton Business School
918333484824973312 2017-10-11 04:32:19 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM @MalcolmNance @joshtpm Seems that NBC is working on a story/video that Trump wants to quash:https://twitter.com/TomArnold/status/918123740399112193
918332182644559872 2017-10-11 04:27:08 UTC <Vva10967> @justapedn @DonnaNoble10th @elid955 @DragonStone1963 The ineptitude comes from the top. We have an inept POTUS. FEMA did great during Sandy when Obama & his team were overseeing it.
918331862354886658 2017-10-11 04:25:52 UTC <Vva10967> @elid955 @justapedn That's exactly what San Juan Mayor @CarmenYulinCruz has been saying all along.
918331562680307713 2017-10-11 04:24:40 UTC <Vva10967> Maybe you should read @DavidCayJ's book on Trump?
918331341359452160 2017-10-11 04:23:48 UTC <Vva10967> He attended first 2 years of college at Fordham & transferred into UPenn as a junior. He took COURSES at Wharton, the UPenn Business School.
918330287263834112 2017-10-11 04:19:36 UTC <Vva10967> Another thing the media gets wrong (like the HRC emails story).https://twitter.com/davidcayj/status/774414176273989632
918323712901959680 2017-10-11 03:53:29 UTC <Vva10967> @NBCNews @nbc you should have released those Apprentice tapes last October.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/918267396493922304
918323238383493125 2017-10-11 03:51:36 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump And what your advisers wrote for you does NOT do any of that, it's just a tax cut for the top 1% that guts Medicare & Medicaid to pay 4 it.
918322405700984832 2017-10-11 03:48:17 UTC <Vva10967> He's not a Wharton graduate, he made that up.
918318271220387840 2017-10-11 03:31:52 UTC <Vva10967> @Bourdain So if the Weinstein stories were out there for years, wouldn't YOU have known about them too & if so, why didn't YOU speak out & out him?
918314233758089217 2017-10-11 03:15:49 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @SRuhle Great, one more thing he does NOT understand! He'll leave our country in financial ruin if he manages to pass his tax cut for the 1%.
918313758342205440 2017-10-11 03:13:56 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @chrislhayes Yet she's brilliant & would have been an awesome POTUS bc she understands America's problems & KNOWS how to solve them & prepared 4 the job.
918313305344749568 2017-10-11 03:12:08 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes Maybe now you understand. @HillaryClinton is maligned for things she hasn't done and has no control over  and have nothing to do with her.
918147663991676928 2017-10-11 16:13:56 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump If you could revoke a broadcaster's license over fake news, Fox would have lost theirs back in the late 1990s. Even morons should know that.
917988024440500224 2017-10-10 05:39:35 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @HillaryPix HRC should have done more of these large rallies. She fills up large venues. Would have killed the shes so unpopular false media narrative
917980654444392448 2017-10-10 05:10:17 UTC <Vva10967> @markfollman Isnt there an environmental group that can sue to stop him?
917768656720982016 2017-10-10 15:07:53 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Good luck Joy and stay safe. Will you be going to Puerto Rico too?
917768184010289152 2017-10-10 15:06:01 UTC <Vva10967> @owillis But they won't because the parties are NOT equal.
917765683546640384 2017-10-10 14:56:04 UTC <Vva10967> @voxdotcom Since he cannot understand policy, much less write it, who do you think is really behind his executive order "fixes"? Can't be Ryan or Mitch
917764619158065152 2017-10-10 14:51:51 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump That's what W thought too before he crashed the economy in 2008.
917764392879640576 2017-10-10 14:50:57 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump We SHOULD tax the NFL.No reason why they should get a tax exemption. Will make interesting conversation at your next NFL owners fundraiser
917763671174139904 2017-10-10 14:48:05 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump you read? or did you listen to the audible in between your golf outings, tweeting and watching Fox?
917763193971331073 2017-10-10 14:46:11 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @IsraelUSAforevr Trump with his ineptitude is going to piss off Iran and get you all nuked and you're thanking him!

917606619831291904 2017-10-09 04:24:01 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs @IrisRimon @turnageb Yeah Brad Parscale said in October that they were focusing on running anti-Hillary ads to convince young blacks & Latinos to stay home.
917604675087732736 2017-10-09 04:16:17 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs Lol. You still think the election was decided on issues & not on racial hate, xenophobia, misogyny & Bernies slanders of HRCs character.
917602101160759297 2017-10-09 04:06:03 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton speaking at UC Davis tonight!https://twitter.com/mondavicenter/status/917592704246099968
917568462616178688 2017-10-09 01:52:23 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryPix I think it will be a hard race if CA House Dems who are confronting Trump challenge her, e.g. Adam Schiff, Maxine Waters, Eric Swalwell
917566851592474624 2017-10-09 01:45:59 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @bravenak @viacampmimi @thepoliticalcat @ShouldRemain She's anti-Hillary & anti-Pelosi & pro-Tim Ryan, you know, the OH dude who took NRA contributions AFTER Sandy Hook & wanted to be Min Leader
917565449973452800 2017-10-09 01:40:25 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton & yet so many of those parents voted GOP for a POS who wants to end CHIP & if he could would also end the public schooling of disabled kids.
917564934422237184 2017-10-09 01:38:22 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton Truth is that every person with a disabled child that was able to attend public school or benefited from CHIP owed you a debt of gratitude.
917563865096896512 2017-10-09 01:34:07 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @ajalsevac Hope your kid is grownup and no longer your dependent since Trump is raising taxes on single moms.
917561053940191233 2017-10-09 01:22:57 UTC <Vva10967> @60Minutes @InvestigateRU Actually 60 Minutes, you should have watched the BBC Documentary BEFORE interviewing Parscale so you could catch his LIES and confront him.
917514870769291264 2017-10-09 22:19:26 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball STOP OBSESSING WITH HILLARY. SHE OWES US NOTHING. You wanted Tim Ryan to replace Pelosi & he took NRA money AFTER SANDY HOOK.
917513860873060352 2017-10-09 22:15:25 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @aj_mirabelle @ToyeLaura @emzorbit But at least there is a paper trail to go back to if in doubt.
917513062118297600 2017-10-09 22:12:15 UTC <Vva10967> @60Minutes @InvestigateRU BUT Brad Parscale tried to minimize the role that Cambridge Analytica played in the 60 Minutes Interview. Why? Compare it to BBC docu

917233935167389696 2017-10-08 03:43:06 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Then again Obama never threatened to nuke North Korea or to start a war with Iran nor decimated the State Department. #ClearAndPresentDanger
917231977790623745 2017-10-08 03:35:19 UTC <Vva10967> @rkuttner He told us to vote for Hillary.  The Far Left didn't listen & either voted third party or voted for Trump.  Not Obama's problem anymore.

916539356768333824 2017-10-06 05:43:05 UTC <Vva10967> @McFaul But if Putin ordered Trump to make Tillerson Sec of State, can Trump really fire him?  Trump didnt know Tillerson but Putin did & well.

916417506188853258 2017-10-06 21:38:54 UTC <Vva10967> @NatashaBertrand I'd be surprised if Trump & the Trump Organization didn't violate the FCPA multiple times. The media was too busy with HRC's emails to ask.
916363311951831040 2017-10-06 18:03:33 UTC <Vva10967> @JuddLegum Especially when the GOP nominated and elected the Pussy-Grabber-In-Chief as POTUS.  They have NO MORALS left to criticize ANYONE.
916348985258008576 2017-10-06 17:06:37 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost @seanspicer Maybe because when your party nominated & elected a Pussy-Grabber-In-Chief as POTUS, you normalized sexual assault & lost ALL moral ground.

915432549396176896 2017-10-03 04:25:02 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidBegnaud is it true that the morgues of all the hospitals in PR are full and not taking any more bodies?
915432266708475904 2017-10-03 04:23:54 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidBegnaud Also wouldn't diabetics who didn't get insulin in 2 weeks have died? Are they being counted as something other than hurricane fatalities?
915431936167989250 2017-10-03 04:22:36 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidBegnaud David how can the number of dead in PR be so low (now 34) when ALL hospitals were losing power & people on ICUs were reportedly dying?

914245111189557248 2017-09-30 21:46:35 UTC <Vva10967> @julito77 I find it hard to believe that with all the power outages in PR hospitals, people in ICUs haven't all died? Is govt hiding the truth?
914240002640564225 2017-09-30 21:26:17 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @NelsonMRosario Trump is a sociopath and cannot feel empathy. We New Yorkers knew that because we've watched him for decades. He is 71. Won't change now.
914234587793973248 2017-09-30 21:04:46 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Obama did much more to help Haiti & they weren't Americans. Instead of golfing you should be in Puerto Rico. You should be FIRED.#IneptPotus

914146302853869575 2017-09-30 15:13:57 UTC <Vva10967> @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @ChelseaClinton @KatherineAzaro @Stokes5513 @BTime4Truth Are you just plain stupid or a brain-washed RWNJ? You cannot be educated in 140 characters, that's for sure!  
913992413768757248 2017-09-29 05:02:27 UTC <Vva10967> @Nasreen12292049 It's 2 events. Hillary is raising money for the Democratic sane candidate & W is raising money for the Republican looney one.
913988990168125440 2017-09-29 04:48:51 UTC <Vva10967> @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @ChelseaClinton @KatherineAzaro @Stokes5513 The repeal and replacement of Obamacare was never about healthcare, it's always been a big GOP tax cut for their wealthy donors.
913988501200392192 2017-09-29 04:46:54 UTC <Vva10967> @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @ChelseaClinton @KatherineAzaro @Stokes5513 Dems fight for civil rights, for families, for children, for healthcare. GOP fights for tax breaks & deregulation for their corporate donors
913987993786044421 2017-09-29 04:44:53 UTC <Vva10967> @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @ChelseaClinton @KatherineAzaro @Stokes5513 Your false equivalencies are what put the GOP in the majority in Congress & Trump in the White House. The 2 parties are DIFFERENT. Dems care
913974163429298176 2017-09-29 03:49:56 UTC <Vva10967> @ManMet80 @RogueSNRadvisor Next one to go should be Scott Pruitt.  Why does he need an 18 person security detail? Does he think he's the POTUS or the VP? C'mon!
913623848645480448 2017-09-28 04:37:54 UTC <Vva10967> @TheBaxterBean The story ran on The Hill this morning. They have since retracted it.
913548955019091968 2017-09-28 23:40:18 UTC <Vva10967> @KellyO said the guy who thinks you can renovate a kitchen or buy a car with $1000!  #OutOfTouch
913528337695477760 2017-09-28 22:18:22 UTC <Vva10967> @isteintraum So deplorable   AND she proves Michelle Obama's point!
913524391597748224 2017-09-28 22:02:42 UTC <Vva10967> @tedlieu AND he also thinks that you can renovate your kitchen or buy a new car for $1,000 ! 
913521590616428544 2017-09-28 21:51:34 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes How is this not impeachable? How is it not obstruction of justice when he's interfering with the execution of the laws by the DOJ?
913520885830705153 2017-09-28 21:48:46 UTC <Vva10967> @ACLU will you be suing the Trump Administration over this? I sure hope so!https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedNews/status/912468823441260551
913516157898039296 2017-09-28 21:29:59 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT you guys should tell Trump that the bill Price worked out with Mitch is NOT what Trump promised his voters, which is why it's so unpopular.
913261586135109633 2017-09-27 04:38:24 UTC <Vva10967> @RalphNortham @HillaryClinton @gdebenedetti @BayleeB79 Of memes I'm sure there are. There is only one set of financial statements per calendar year. They're audited. Publicly available online.
913260452637036545 2017-09-27 04:33:54 UTC <Vva10967> @RalphNortham @HillaryClinton @gdebenedetti @BayleeB79 Both count on their readers/viewers being too stupid to realize they are being lied to and are being played for fools.
913259977548197888 2017-09-27 04:32:00 UTC <Vva10967> @RalphNortham @HillaryClinton @gdebenedetti @BayleeB79 Maybe you should try reading the ACTUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS of the Clinton Foundation instead of relying on stupid memes from Fox/Breitbart
913257471736762368 2017-09-27 04:22:03 UTC <Vva10967> @jmsexton_ @kurteichenwald @ignatzz And only someone as corrupt as Trump is, would agree to that deal. To Vlady lifting those sanctions is worth billion$.
913256919145512960 2017-09-27 04:19:51 UTC <Vva10967> @jmsexton_ @kurteichenwald @ignatzz That has been the narrative but the Steele Dossier also said that Vlady would give Trump 19.5% of Rosneft if he lifted the US sanctions. /1
913255544064012294 2017-09-27 04:14:23 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @mercurygirl7 Bernie had Tad Devine who worked with Manafort in Viktor Yanukovych'selection in Ukraine. Reporters should look into their "rigged" claims.
913105133562732544 2017-09-27 18:16:43 UTC <Vva10967> @mikefarb1 is there a way to tell if voting and/or tallying machines were hacked? I know DHS doesn't want to know.
913101727456534531 2017-09-27 18:03:11 UTC <Vva10967> @TheCut @herenowhere3 I don't mean the media. Hillary gave him a free pass. 2020 Candidates will not. And there's plenty of material. Assuming he's still alive.
913101076848680965 2017-09-27 18:00:35 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright Let's hope the same is true of GOP tax plan or they will bankrupt America and complain when the Dem POTUS cant fix it quickly enough 4 them.
913100576417894400 2017-09-27 17:58:36 UTC <Vva10967> @TheCut @herenowhere3 I'm pretty sure that Bernie won't get a free pass if he decides to run in 2020.
913097327564476416 2017-09-27 17:45:42 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @HoarseWisperer @Kaya985 Yes a lot of her rallies were in the morning & early afternoon on WEEKDAYS & still there were lines waiting to get in & people got cut off.
913096738172555264 2017-09-27 17:43:21 UTC <Vva10967> @HoarseWisperer @KMC4wauk Here's the schedule, says they may add events, sure hope so! http://www.hillaryclintonmemoir.com/events.html#book-signings
913096348932743170 2017-09-27 17:41:48 UTC <Vva10967> @HoarseWisperer @KMC4wauk All her book signings that have been announced to date are sold out. Tickets are $30 because you're buying the book. All independent stores.
912924131284455424 2017-09-26 06:17:28 UTC <Vva10967> @HoarseWisperer @KMC4wauk Montclair. Press says tickets were given out in August. She'll be signing books in Brooklyn tomorrow (Wed) but tickets are sold out too.
912920663219990530 2017-09-26 06:03:42 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @HoarseWisperer There were always long lines at her events. But venues her campaign chose were too small to accommodate the crowds that wanted to see her.
912920163556741120 2017-09-26 06:01:42 UTC <Vva10967> @HoarseWisperer Wish @HillaryClinton had done large rallies in the general. Her events filled to capacity quickly & tons of people couldn't get in.
912913849585717248 2017-09-26 05:36:37 UTC <Vva10967> @CandaceTX @brhodes Actually he is just responding to an article he mentioned in his prior tweet that said Kelly didn't approve, called it fake news.
912911916644921345 2017-09-26 05:28:56 UTC <Vva10967> @maria_secviar @JoyAnnReid Maybe Cambridge Analytica is showing them weird ads and stories on Facebook about that?
912703420729044993 2017-09-26 15:40:27 UTC <Vva10967> Surprised he didn't add "not very many people knew that"https://twitter.com/jbendery/status/912700009195409408
912547579795267584 2017-09-25 05:21:11 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines So were W Bush and Cheney (intentionally hiding things). Didn't bother the Republicans. Only mistake you guys made was apologize for it.
912546184790777856 2017-09-25 05:15:39 UTC <Vva10967> @roxydavis99 There is no bottom with the Trumps. Just today Howard Stern released the tapes of ALL his interviews with Trump. 
912535527378898944 2017-09-25 04:33:18 UTC <Vva10967> Trump and Pence are too busy with fundraisers this week to pay attention to the USVI and Puerto Rico.http://politi.co/2hvbi1x
912533727418478592 2017-09-25 04:26:09 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias That's not limited to @LindseyGrahamSC , it's a Republican problem. Only exceptions in GOP are @SenatorCollins & @lisamurkowski.
912530833826811904 2017-09-25 04:14:39 UTC <Vva10967> @ASlavitt Until @lisamurkowski says she is also a NO, it's not dead. Rand Paul is not reliable. He was a no in the prior repeals & became a yes.
912520184308600832 2017-09-25 03:32:20 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes loved the interview and your questions but most I loved @HillaryClinton's answers to them. She's so smart and knowledgeable, unlike DJT.
912518505853046784 2017-09-25 03:25:40 UTC <Vva10967> For the idiots who voted for Trump because they thought that his xenophobia would be limited to illegals and would not affect them:https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedNews/status/912468823441260551
912438927398711296 2017-09-25 22:09:27 UTC <Vva10967> @ReutersPolitics well yes, because it cuts Medicaid, that's where the "savings" is coming from!
912437718831026176 2017-09-25 22:04:39 UTC <Vva10967> @RVAwonk Unfortunately he can't launch it UNLESS & UNTIL Dems win back the House in 2018.
912437375875330048 2017-09-25 22:03:17 UTC <Vva10967> Of course. The Republicans don't want the Dreamers voting for 15 YEARS!https://twitter.com/ReutersPolitics/status/912433638222024705
912361311274758145 2017-09-25 17:01:02 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton So she's not saying that the National Guard & the Coast Guard have not been deployed but that this particular ship is needed to save lives/3
912357999267782657 2017-09-25 16:47:52 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton Hospitals in PR are closed because they can't get diesel due to flooded streets, debris & also drivers stuck in their homes. /2
912357699710521344 2017-09-25 16:46:41 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton The USNS Comfort is a Naval hospital ship which Trump & his inept govt may not know exists. /1
912195359656562688 2017-09-24 06:01:36 UTC <Vva10967> @RepStevenSmith @tedlieu Why isn't Trump's attack on NFL's players' freedom of speech an impeacheable offense? He swore to uphold the US Constitution incl 1st Amdt
912158482991910913 2017-09-24 03:35:04 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Hey @RealDonaldTrump @GOP & @TGowdySC, LOCK HIM UP???? Or does the rule only apply to HRC?http://wapo.st/2xpyZyA?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.b77f8106f44a
911981664519299074 2017-09-24 15:52:27 UTC <Vva10967> @Evan_McMullin mmm, have you been watching YOUR party, the GOP, over the last 30 years???  Trump didn't invent it, the GOP did & Trump put his name on it
911744322231525383 2017-09-23 00:09:20 UTC <Vva10967> @Khanoisseur can't somebody sue to stop them? like an environmental group? or even the govt of Alaska?
911742179529445376 2017-09-23 00:00:49 UTC <Vva10967> @yashar Why would a man that is still "With Her" want to go out with a Deplorable excuse for a human being???
911716438322368522 2017-09-23 22:18:32 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid LOVED the interview, you asked excellent questions. Would love to see Hillary as a regular guest on your show discussing policy 1:1 w you.

911709017982095360 2017-09-23 21:49:03 UTC <Vva10967> @awelab1956 @mikefarb1 @NatDialogues @LazyDogTweets @BCrawfordCA @cirizarryster They don't understand that to White nationalists, they are brown and would be racially profiled in time.
911708782434152448 2017-09-23 21:48:07 UTC <Vva10967> @awelab1956 @mikefarb1 @NatDialogues @LazyDogTweets @BCrawfordCA @cirizarryster The Latino vote probably reflects Texas & the old Cuban guard in FL. They think that Trump's rhetoric only affects illegals.
911456576124411904 2017-09-22 05:05:56 UTC <Vva10967> @girlsreallyrule Could be. But it would be higher without ACA. He might have a platinum plan that lets you see specialists without referrals.
911453573518589954 2017-09-22 04:54:00 UTC <Vva10967> @Shareblue @RVAwonk This feels like we are in a Harry Potter movie with Lord Voldemort and his allies running the US government!@JKRowlingss
911450622288941056 2017-09-22 04:42:16 UTC <Vva10967> @RepAdamSchiff DHS has yet to audit the voting and tallying machines to KNOW for sure they were not breached Claim of no breach is based on ASSUMPTIONS.
911449922641199104 2017-09-22 04:39:30 UTC <Vva10967> @APEastRegion @MYSTERIOUS043 @VeeCee30 @somecough210 @WNeilrlw12 DHS did not audit the voting or tallying machines to know if they were in fact breached. They simply ASSUMED they were not breached.
911449356028583936 2017-09-22 04:37:15 UTC <Vva10967> @APEastRegion DHS said they did not audit machines to know if they were in fact breached. DHS simply ASSUMED they were not breached. #Investigate
911309640838914048 2017-09-22 19:22:04 UTC <Vva10967> @allanbrauer The focus needs to be 2018. If we don't take back the House, we're screwed. Same with the Governorships & state legislatures.
911099261734969345 2017-09-21 05:26:06 UTC <Vva10967> @eafrederick521 @BarbaraLNewsome @SenSanders was likable until he let power & greed go to his head in primary. If he had stuck to issues & not slandered HRC she'd be POTUS.
911097105019691008 2017-09-21 05:17:31 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @HillaryClinton @amjoyshow Love it!  Can't wait to watch the interview!
911095814683951104 2017-09-21 05:12:24 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @DC4Hope @ZerlinaMaxwell Can you ask her what her thoughts are on where the fight against systemic racism goes & what happens to BLM with DOJ under Jeff Sessions?
911087663817437190 2017-09-21 04:40:00 UTC <Vva10967> @itsmebeccam @SallyAlbright @SoftSable79 To this date whenever I see any of the men that was on Senate Judiciary Committee then (e.g Hatch) my mind immediately jumps to Anita Hill.

910960530814324743 2017-09-21 20:14:50 UTC <Vva10967> @MaxBoot He inherited Obama's FEMA and FEMA has been doing a great job responding to the many hurricanes we've had.
910696512551874561 2017-09-20 02:45:43 UTC <Vva10967> @SecretService you should check out this Hillary Clinton stalker.https://twitter.com/LauraLoomer/status/910677910394167297
910694366238437376 2017-09-20 02:37:11 UTC <Vva10967> @PreetBharara @mlcalderone Poor Preet. He's going to join the CNN shouting matches that make the CNN newsroom resemble a circus.
910609284534284288 2017-09-20 20:59:06 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @SenSanders @MeetThePress @SusanBordo and he never walked back any of his slanders on her character. Nor walked back any of the "rigged election" nonsense.
910608885093928963 2017-09-20 20:57:31 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @SenSanders @MeetThePress @SusanBordo Bernie would always end his speech by saying 2 his base that post-election they'd NEED to hold HRC accountable 4 making good on her promises
910608366988382208 2017-09-20 20:55:27 UTC <Vva10967> @MeetThePress @SusanBordo the thing is that during stump speeches @SenSanders made for @HillaryClinton he'd REINFORCE claim that she couldn't be trusted by his base.
910595151239761921 2017-09-20 20:02:56 UTC <Vva10967> @DailyTrix @pennyw503 @jlms_qkw yes, and Trump's attorney general wants to go back to the Immigration Law of 1924 to make America White Again.

910592655058448384 2017-09-20 19:53:01 UTC <Vva10967> @DailyTrix @pennyw503 @jlms_qkw Dems also passed 1965 Voting Rights Act. Before that, minorities were denied right to vote by white supremacists, particularly in South /3

910371300144828416 2017-09-19 05:13:26 UTC <Vva10967> @yashar Yes.  They need to stop trying to please Bernie and his Cult.

910357250845364229 2017-09-19 04:17:36 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @JDiamond1 So why does a self-proclaimed billionaire need donations to pay his legal bills if he is as rich as he proclaims to be?

908909121809915904 2017-09-15 04:23:16 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @Row_Boat_Cop She COULD have contested the convention. But chose not to, because she wanted to see a Democrat win the White House. Bernie didn't care.
908908844037869569 2017-09-15 04:22:09 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @Row_Boat_Cop No, I think Mr. Dane is 100% correct. THEIRS was a tight race & HRC won the popular vote & lost delegates when MI & FL moved primaries up.

Dems should have built it up like GOP did w Fox.

908733540589764609 2017-09-15 16:45:34 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 waiting for Trump's tweet where he claims this and that Obama is the one doing it!!!

908541825270476807 2017-09-14 04:03:45 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes Didn't Bernie's bill omit its price tag like all his other prior single payer bills? If so how do you know how much would have to be raised?
908504965076934657 2017-09-14 01:37:17 UTC <Vva10967> @Amy_Siskind Listen to her Pod Save America podcast interview. What she says there is VERY close to what you've been saying, re Trump's authoritarianism.pic.twitter.com/zgQRDppOn4
908481076133339138 2017-09-14 00:02:21 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes but Gang of 8 bill was a really shitty bill, a militarization of our borders with no legalization unless and until GOP decided border=secure
908449985984942080 2017-09-14 21:58:49 UTC <Vva10967> @AhmedBaba_ @Jimi_Jammin true, but it proved that American voters will believe ANYTHING, no matter how absurd & that Dems shouldn't assume no one can be THAT dumb.
908447329631555584 2017-09-14 21:48:16 UTC <Vva10967> @AhmedBaba_ @Jimi_Jammin The 2010 election should have been a warning. Obama & Dems gave people HEALTHCARE and instead of being rewarded by voters they were punished

908087128139190273 2017-09-13 21:56:57 UTC <Vva10967> The full interview of Hillary airs today, Wednesday, at 8:00 p.m. during "Anderson Cooper 360."https://twitter.com/danmericaCNN/status/908069458807320577
908084666263068678 2017-09-13 21:47:10 UTC <Vva10967> @20committee @JoeUchill lol, reading that description, I thought you tweet was about Trump, didn't realize it was about Flynn!
908083921715417088 2017-09-13 21:44:12 UTC <Vva10967> @chucktodd @HillaryWarnedUs mmmm, I would say the answer is YES, he just wings it! 
908023222548840448 2017-09-13 17:43:01 UTC <Vva10967> @marcushjohnson @_celia_marie_ @dorolfe @owillis @JoshuaGuess @fawfulfan Yeah but this is being presented as a viable plan and it isn't. it's political theater and we still need to protect and fix the ACA.
908021781084155906 2017-09-13 17:37:17 UTC <Vva10967> @sarahkliff @anneelliott1818 So Dems are banking on voters being too dumb to realize they're being sold Snake Oil. It worked for Trump & Bernie but will Dem base buy it?
908000347192520704 2017-09-13 16:12:07 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Single payer can't work unless we're also willing to regulate prices of healthcare & we aren't. HC isn't free. SOMEONE's always paying. /9
907999585980833797 2017-09-13 16:09:05 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid They expect same people who were upset about losing their doctor under ACA 2 embrace losing their current health insurance for Medicare? /8
907999280757198848 2017-09-13 16:07:53 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Actually, never mind passing, it has zero chance of even getting a vote since Ryan & McConnell decide what gets a vote. /7
907998898349846530 2017-09-13 16:06:21 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid And this Medicare for All bill that has zero chance of passing could make the Resistance let down its guard and allow ACA to be repealed /6
907998625363644416 2017-09-13 16:05:16 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid I feel like the Dems are setting themselves up to walk into a 2010-like "Death Panels, Pulls the Plug On Grandma" trap in 2018. /5
907998243514191872 2017-09-13 16:03:45 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid And it would be prohibitively expensive because you're not doing anything to bring HC prices under control. Also it would NOT be FREE. /4
907997777178845185 2017-09-13 16:01:54 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid The Medicare people know is really Medicare with Advantage Plans. Medicare by itself is like a bronze ACA plan with 80% coverage. /3
907997391973994496 2017-09-13 16:00:22 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid They are very vocal, but the majority of the voters get their medical insurance through their employers and are happy with it. /2
907997187723972608 2017-09-13 15:59:33 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid But don't you think Dems are MISREADING the electorate? The folks who lack medical insurance are a small segment of the population. /1
907770362645172224 2017-09-12 00:58:14 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias You can say the same thing of Bernie. But you won't. He too opposed gay marriage in his 2006 Senate Campaign. It just wasn't popular.
907747543915929600 2017-09-12 23:27:34 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @AW2B12 They won't admit it until Mueller shows that Bernie's campaign colluded too.
907747037805981697 2017-09-12 23:25:33 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller But Comey SO DESERVES to be dragged through the mud by Trump.  He was such an a-hole to Hillary. I'm sure Mueller will rescue him in the end
907744654896050176 2017-09-12 23:16:05 UTC <Vva10967> @finneyk @robertNorth14 @Feagley What vote??? Ryan and McConnell DECIDE what gets a vote and what does not. Guess where Bernie's bills fall?
907712274630156288 2017-09-12 21:07:25 UTC <Vva10967> @TVietor08 and you don't? Seriously? She is 100% right about the GOP's intentions of changing the Constitution. Will likely make us a Christian nation.
907669756324524033 2017-09-12 18:18:28 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @jjz1600 it made no sense when Bernie made it as he was mathematically eliminated after NY & knew it.But it weaponized DNC emails hacked in Mar & Apr
907669261581275136 2017-09-12 18:16:30 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @jjz1600 Then explain Bernie's claim that election was rigged, made precisely at a time when Putin had DNC emails & needed to weaponize them.

907664126058536961 2017-09-12 17:56:05 UTC <Vva10967> @guycecil I don't think that is possible unless and until Bernie stops attacking the Dem Party & his Bros its upcoming stars like Kamala Harris.

907637745237061634 2017-09-12 16:11:16 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki @HillaryClinton is attacked for that vote as if she had been decisive vote or had been sole yes  (she wasn't, 77 of 100 Senators voted yes).
907637440487313408 2017-09-12 16:10:03 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki I don't remember ANYBODY pounding Kerry for YEARS for having voted FOR the Iraq War.

907621252671602690 2017-09-12 15:05:44 UTC <Vva10967> @MrTreyTony But sure, @HillaryClinton is so unpopular  & her appearances on The View (9/14), Colbert (9/18) & The Daily Show (11/1) are all sold out.
907618012743847936 2017-09-12 14:52:51 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill They (Russia) have probably been doing the same thing in Germany to attack Angela Merkel.
907614758530113536 2017-09-12 14:39:55 UTC <Vva10967> @rmiskimens @deray Because they know Jeff Sessions' DOJ agrees with them. @HillaryClinton's DOJ would have prosecuted this. #ElectionsHaveConsequences

907407078477717505 2017-09-11 00:54:40 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @JoyAnnReid @martinjdolan Had she used the State Dept server instead of her own, her emails would have been hacked because Russia hacked the State Dept in 2014.
907406644916768768 2017-09-11 00:52:57 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @martinjdolan And @HillaryClinton's server was NEVER HACKED. If it had been, her PRIVATE emails would be on Wikipedia. They're not.
907406387453599745 2017-09-11 00:51:56 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @martinjdolan Her server was set up for Bill Clinton & Clinton Foundation. She simply added a domain name to it (her tech did) for her email account.
907406024138805248 2017-09-11 00:50:29 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @martinjdolan emails PROPERLY marked CLASSIFIED (in accordance with manual) went into SCIF & into CLASSIFIED GOV SERVER ACCOUNT.
907405687264829441 2017-09-11 00:49:09 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @martinjdolan e.g. Did you know that the private server email account was ONLY for her UNCLASSIFIED emails & that she had a SCIF AND a CLASSIFIED account?
907405328018497539 2017-09-11 00:47:43 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @martinjdolan The story didn't go away because she apologized for having used a private server. BiG MISTAKE.  AND the press didn't understand servers.
907401654919720960 2017-09-11 00:33:07 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos And since the Berners hate the DNC, they also won't give it money. So DNC is failing at its key task: fundraising. /5
907401461314805760 2017-09-11 00:32:21 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos Now it's pissing off REGISTERED Dems with Unity Commission & the bowing down to Bernie so these Registered Dems don't give it money. /4
907400973089374210 2017-09-11 00:30:25 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos That's the reason Hillary had to pump money into it when she became the nominee. Other task is to plan debates & nominating convention  /3
907400490425647104 2017-09-11 00:28:30 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos People think it's a king-making entity because of Bernie's LIES. But it's not. And it hasn't been great at fundraising either. /2
907400277858422786 2017-09-11 00:27:39 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos The DNC is a FUNDRAISING ARM of the Dem Party, NOT a king-making entity. It raises money nationally & distributes it to Dem state parties 1/
907399406772736000 2017-09-11 00:24:11 UTC <Vva10967> @kkondik So we really should make the Supers non-voting. Otherwise Bernie will cry foul & blame his 2020 loss on the Supers AGAIN! And he WILL LOSE.
907398832434098176 2017-09-11 00:21:54 UTC <Vva10967> @kkondik you still have to clear a 10% threshold to get any delegates so no, it won't be inconclusive. Supers don't overturn the will of the voters.

906938958382329856 2017-09-10 17:54:32 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Also, it's odd that everytime Rick Scott starts speaking Spanish, both CNN and MSNBC switch off covering him!
906938774386552832 2017-09-10 17:53:48 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Like Christie, he sucks as a governor but did a good job with Sandy. But yeah, watching a Tea Party guy speak Spanish is odd.

906903024232263680 2017-09-10 15:31:45 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @dfoley75 No rigging. He was MATHEMATICALLY eliminated after NY but kept milking you for $27 contributions to keep having rallies & applause he loves.

906281843284209664 2017-09-08 22:23:23 UTC <Vva10967> @Morning_Joe @KaraCalavera @p_monticone @SoftSable79 @SER1897 yeah but it's odd that in all the swing states Trump won, his margin was just below 1% but not below the number that triggers a recount.
906279520591863809 2017-09-08 22:14:10 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn @3L3V3NTH @dark_wisdom_ @TrickFreee @CORLEBRA777 @hardhouz13 @isumrvl3 @JamesFourM @MrFelt_ @stlthjeff @ninaandtito @AZ_Wcats_fan @BarricadesBloom @LouiseMensch @andywigmore @lauferlaw @counterchekist @PeskyKidsAgain @dcpoll @TrueFactsStated @proudwarrior27 @ushadrons @emlas Parscale said Cambridge Analytica was telling them what profiles to target and the FB employees sent to HQs were helping them do it.

906277421435023360 2017-09-08 22:05:49 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright @Irish_Pack Voter ID & Russia's meddling w voter registrations kept true Dem voters from casting their ballots & allowed Bernie's Cult 2 make DJT POTUS.
906276397081088000 2017-09-08 22:01:45 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright @Irish_Pack yeah, but the 3rd party protest voters MADE it to the polls AND had the proper ID. They determined the outcome and made Trump POTUS.
906272377738276867 2017-09-08 21:45:47 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright Sexism must be addressed or female candidates for POTUS in 2020 will suffer same fate as Hillary. Sanders & Trump got away with LIES--> men.
906271972010725379 2017-09-08 21:44:10 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright Trump did NOT have enough voters to elect him POTUS. He needed Bernie's Cult to vote 3rd party in swing states to defeat HRC.
906271556237750272 2017-09-08 21:42:31 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright Democratic Party won popular vote. Needs to start acting like it. So much self pity. Trump has NO mandate. Only won because of Bernie's Cult
906271178259562497 2017-09-08 21:41:01 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright Hillary spared Bernie but GOP had a thick opposition dossier on him, with videos and audio, and Trump's nickname for him: Communist Bernie.
906270693939138562 2017-09-08 21:39:05 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright Bernie LOST Primary by 4 million votes. Primary was never rigged.  Bernie lost primary in mid-March & was mathematically excluded after NY.
906270355416809472 2017-09-08 21:37:45 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright Bernie attacks the Democratic Party for his own benefit, for his Revolution. But America is NOT socialist.
906270166891335681 2017-09-08 21:37:00 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright The Democratic party fights for the middle class. It passed Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, ACA. GOP opposed & wants to dismantle all.
906269850212990977 2017-09-08 21:35:44 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright Can't fix problems if we misdiagnose them. We lost because Bernie's Cult voted 3rd party or for Trump to punish HRC. It wasn't the message.
906269601343909889 2017-09-08 21:34:45 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright The Resistance is Female. Hillary's loss woke them up to the fact that the most qualified woman can lose to the least qualified man. #Sexism
906234377209827328 2017-09-08 19:14:47 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica And for that matter, shouldn't she have sued InfoWars and Alex Jones for PizzaGate? And Flynn and son? even just to get their depositions.
906234153225650177 2017-09-08 19:13:53 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica She's a public figure, sure, but Clinton Cash book & Breitbart interview of Erik Prince would still have met malice test of NYT v Sullivan.
906233891060633601 2017-09-08 19:12:51 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica Shouldn't she have sued the authors of Clinton Cash? And Erik Prince and Breitbart? And gotten their depositions in discovery?
906233321071443968 2017-09-08 19:10:35 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica Because Comey went rogue on Black Lives Matter & policing too but didn't go rogue on @EricHolder. He should have been fired then.
906232857219227648 2017-09-08 19:08:44 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica what's her opinion of (1) how Comey related to Loretta Lynch & Sally Yates (sexism?) & (2) why they let him get away w violating Dept Rules?
906232065464651777 2017-09-08 19:05:36 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica Trump projects. Was claim that he may not accept results a trick to ensure she would concede & not challenge election lost by <78,000 votes?
906231652107653121 2017-09-08 19:03:57 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica what did their internal polling show about Berners protest voting 3rd party or for Trump in the swing states?
906231327346892802 2017-09-08 19:02:40 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica were the classified emails discussions with her staff on how to deal with NYT front page stories on CIA drones program?
906230925062795264 2017-09-08 19:01:04 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica maybe she covers this in her book, but why didn't she do the large rallies in the general? The demand to see her was there. Events sold out.
906230586876076033 2017-09-08 18:59:43 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica why are the tickets to her book tour so high?
906230233073844225 2017-09-08 18:58:19 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica @PilotJz Because she doesn't want Bernie to crash us in 2018 since that's the last fair election we would have if GOP wins.
906229864310738944 2017-09-08 18:56:51 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica What does she think of Steele Dossier's claim that release of hacked DNC emails was quid pro quo 4 changing RNC platform on Russia-Ukraine?
906229555056267264 2017-09-08 18:55:37 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @PodSaveAmerica What does she think of Steele Dossier's claims that Dem Party was infiltrated too?
906227175657005056 2017-09-08 18:46:10 UTC <Vva10967> @TomPerez @keithellison @DNC @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi You need to clean up the DNC. This "Unity" thing ain't working. It's losing DNC $$$https://twitter.com/zatchry/status/906145181237432321
906223155718578176 2017-09-08 18:30:11 UTC <Vva10967> @steakhousegirl @JustAGurLnSwedn but then his followers complaint when the DNC doesn't send money to his candidates, lol.  Money that the DNC doesn't have & won't have w him
906222688452136960 2017-09-08 18:28:20 UTC <Vva10967> @daralebrun @JustAGurLnSwedn Bernie has made up a false narrative to fit & boost his socialist agenda from the 1960s & conveniently leaves out how he pays for it.
906190513254129664 2017-09-08 16:20:29 UTC <Vva10967> @TerencePlumb You should make this thread into a Moment.  Loved it!
906181959294087171 2017-09-08 15:46:29 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @leemwilliams oh, it's entertaining. They send you stuff and you can reply, "Dear DNC/Tom:You Won't See a Dime from Me Until You Dump Bernie & his Cult."
906180868678537216 2017-09-08 15:42:09 UTC <Vva10967> @gdebenedetti The Bernie Cult is a cancer on the Dem Party & needs to be removed. Treating it with home based remedies hoping it gets better won't work

906040592328646656 2017-09-07 06:24:45 UTC <Vva10967> @sahilkapur Sanders is a cancer on the Democratic Party and needs to be exposed and removed so the Democratic Party can heal back and win in 2018.
906039097713582080 2017-09-07 06:18:48 UTC <Vva10967> @sahilkapur She lost with @SenSanders' help. He even helped Putin weaponize hacked DNC emails with rigged election lie. He should be investigated.
906037552334856192 2017-09-07 06:12:40 UTC <Vva10967> @marcushjohnson May be going to fund Onward Together.

905661835034091520 2017-09-06 05:19:42 UTC <Vva10967> @Slate or until Mueller investigates Bernie and gets to the bottom of his "rigged election" claim that allowed Putin to weaponize stolen DNC emails
905601613590646784 2017-09-06 01:20:24 UTC <Vva10967> @DRichards13 Newsflash: He cannot. State has to do it.
905600887049027585 2017-09-06 01:17:31 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper they should remember that Speaker Ryan gets to decide whether or not Trump gets impeached....
905599835453186049 2017-09-06 01:13:20 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT @leeladaou @SophieInCT True. At least @mitchellreports is being hit by Karma as she covers the State Department and Trump's foreign trips.  
905594289606021120 2017-09-06 00:51:18 UTC <Vva10967> @leeladaou yeah, it even has a name, Clinton Derangement Syndrome. Seems to affect mostly male pundits plus @maggieNYT really really bad.
905592647406022657 2017-09-06 00:44:46 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilippeReines HRC lost by so few votes that I don't see how DJT gets reelected. He didn't have enough voters, the Sandernistas' protest votes elected him.
905568976230600705 2017-09-06 23:10:43 UTC <Vva10967> @JaredHuffman And Bernie came up with that narrative AFTER Russia did the hacking but before it went public with them on Wikileaks. #InvestigateSanders
905568732205998081 2017-09-06 23:09:45 UTC <Vva10967> @JaredHuffman Are you kidding? Bernie inexplicably came up with the "election is rigged" narrative that Putin needed to weaponized the hacked DNC emails.
905495605484642304 2017-09-06 18:19:10 UTC <Vva10967> @GOP He won't be convicted. McDonnell v. United States allows bribery. He should hold on until we get a new NJ Governor in Nov.  #McConnellRule
905494682934923264 2017-09-06 18:15:30 UTC <Vva10967> @ArthurSchwartz No, he is not. McDonnell v. United States allows what he did. He'll walk.
905493875917287427 2017-09-06 18:12:17 UTC <Vva10967> @AriMelber @russc63 No, it's the law of the land. And Congress has not changed it.
905493403214995457 2017-09-06 18:10:25 UTC <Vva10967> @AriMelber but even if the jury convicts, shouldn't the case be thrown out by the judge based on the McDonnell case? Indictment came before McD, no?

904408902049124353 2017-09-03 18:21:00 UTC <Vva10967> @EricHolder Shouldn't we do more (e.g. lawsuit? discovery?) to find out if hackers changed the election outcome & Trump is an illegitimate POTUS?

903099733480271872 2017-08-30 03:38:49 UTC <Vva10967> @Gus_802 @GrapefruitCorey if you mean Medicare, that's not really single payer. People like it because of Medicare Advantage. W/O it's like a Bronze Obamacare Plan.

901667301371645953 2017-08-26 04:46:51 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @GovHowardDean And Steele Dossier says Dem Party WAS infiltrated. Tulsi Gabbard should be investigated too. The timing of her DNC departure is suspect IMO
901666768724398080 2017-08-26 04:44:44 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @GovHowardDean Remember that Tad Devine worked with Paul Manafort in Viktor Yanukovich's Ukraine campaign so ties must be scrutinized too.

901468085881843712 2017-08-26 15:35:14 UTC <Vva10967> @Ange_Amene @FaceTheNation The media wants to convince us that Bernie is the future of the Dem Party. They must really hate the Dem Party! 
901281607339974656 2017-08-25 03:14:14 UTC <Vva10967> @LauraAJarrett So will Jeff Sessions say anything?
901250538544738304 2017-08-25 01:10:47 UTC <Vva10967> So one of the Benghazi guys is now going to turn into a Russian spy???https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/901074776059412480
901249571615117314 2017-08-25 01:06:56 UTC <Vva10967> So did Trump put the tariffs on Canadian lumber to help Russia? Everything Trump does ends up being related to Russia!https://twitter.com/christoq/status/900894537932980224
901248257589956608 2017-08-25 01:01:43 UTC <Vva10967> @POTUS @RepEspaillat @NancyPelosi @mrswineaux61 @MaxPowerNYC You DO realize that Dems are the minority party in the House, that House has no filibuster and that its agenda is controlled by Ryan, right?
901234967631597569 2017-08-25 00:08:55 UTC <Vva10967> @NomikiKonst 66MM People voted for our candidate. YOUR fringe side voted for Trump & made him POTUS to avenge St Bernard.NOTHING to do w closed primaries
901234102040498176 2017-08-25 00:05:28 UTC <Vva10967> Hey Arizona, @realDonaldTrump says Joe Arpaio is above the law!https://twitter.com/abbydphillip/status/901233198163775489
900938004910399490 2017-08-24 04:28:53 UTC <Vva10967> @nytopinion President Obama told everyone to vote for @HillaryClinton and warned everyone of the danger  that Trump represented. Did you miss it?
900827836482760704 2017-08-24 21:11:07 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh Next Q: WHY & HOW did Bernie Sanders come up with the "election is rigged" theme that Russia NEEDED to weaponize the hacked DNC emails?
900819600442617861 2017-08-24 20:38:23 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh But will MSM ever ask WHY & HOW did Bernie come up with the "election is rigged" narrative that Russia NEEDED to weaponize the DNC emails?
900819481743814656 2017-08-24 20:37:55 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou But will MSM ever ask WHY & HOW did Bernie come up with the "election is rigged" narrative that Russia NEEDED to weaponize the DNC emails?
900816220160749570 2017-08-24 20:24:57 UTC <Vva10967> So cool! Hillary is going to be the narrator in the Audible version of her book!https://twitter.com/SimonBooks/status/900356034891403265
900570355089240064 2017-08-23 04:07:59 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryPix Not that hard to understand. Linda Sarsoor was one of the 4 organizers of that march and she's a Bernette and Hillary hater.
900222617956884480 2017-08-22 05:06:12 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @nwg83 @bananabanana86 @drq95 That (not going to WI) is not why she lost.

900220596373651459 2017-08-22 04:58:10 UTC <Vva10967> @PhilipRucker Oh Phil! You're doing a @VanJones68!  That's so sad!
900041649732059136 2017-08-22 17:07:05 UTC <Vva10967> @Shakestweetz yeah but in all fairness Obama and Biden would eat out together and attend events together, so it's no longer a big deal.
899803512326017024 2017-08-21 01:20:49 UTC <Vva10967> Hope @VanJones68 doesn't go into his "Trump was so Presidential" rant today. 
899790031187046404 2017-08-21 00:27:15 UTC <Vva10967> @mashable @AdamParkhomenko Too bad he didn't stare at the eclipse longer. It would have been funny if he had not been able to read the teleprompter tonight.

899484164814188544 2017-08-20 04:11:51 UTC <Vva10967> @JesseBWatters @FoxNews yeah but in 1965 they all switched to the GOP because LBJ betrayed them.  Nixon & his Southern Strategy welcomed them & here we are: TRUMP!
899384419559116800 2017-08-20 21:35:30 UTC <Vva10967> @RWPUSA Did they replace the Editor-In-Chief at @Newsweek?  This is 3rd story in as many days which sounds like it came from the National Enquirer!
899142744593100800 2017-08-19 05:35:10 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @menjicm @dcpoll That doesn't make him a "Wharton Grad". And as I recall his dad made a substantial donation to UPenn to get him admitted.
899106914990272512 2017-08-19 03:12:47 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @menjicm @dcpoll Wharton is the business school of UPenn. He transferred to UPenn from Fordham in junior year & took classes at Wharton as an undergraduate.

898765238421475329 2017-08-18 04:35:05 UTC <Vva10967> @Newsweek This "former KKK leader & senator" is Sen Robert Byrd of WV & 98 other Senators were also "linked to him" as were Presidents. #Misleading

898348472331522056 2017-08-17 00:59:00 UTC <Vva10967> @marceelias All Democrats. The Republicans continue to put party over country.

898297795186016256 2017-08-17 21:37:38 UTC <Vva10967> @chucktodd & YOU'll be doing full hour reports on @MeetThePress that prove GOP hates her, right? Your OWN hate of Hillary becomes self-fulfilling, no?
898296182656651264 2017-08-17 21:31:14 UTC <Vva10967> @chucktodd Maybe if people in the media like YOU had not engaged in false equivalencies & had investigated Trump instead he wouldn't be POTUS now.
898295520027975680 2017-08-17 21:28:36 UTC <Vva10967> @chucktodd No. She lost because the BernieBusters hated her more than they loved our country & voted 3rd party in swing states to avenge St Bernie.
897942017510187014 2017-08-16 22:03:54 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump yeah, Heather Heyer will be remembered as the first victim of the hate that you and your campaign brought back.

895101469359255552 2017-08-08 01:56:35 UTC <Vva10967> @jmpalmieri I suppose they could do it again in 2020 since they're already attacking Kamala & Cory but we now know what to expect & can plan for it.
895100889517760513 2017-08-08 01:54:16 UTC <Vva10967> @jmpalmieri yeah but Trump didn't have enough voters to elect him POTUS in 2016. The BernieBusters made Trump POTUS w their 3rd party protest votes.

894763427398275072 2017-08-07 03:33:19 UTC <Vva10967> @gdebenedetti The problem is not the primary, they don't have the numbers to affect the outcome. The problem is that they'll get the Republican elected.
894662564516331520 2017-08-07 20:52:32 UTC <Vva10967> @AwardsDaily He won't. Trump's base isn't large enough 2 elect or reelect him. He won bc of the Berners. Now we know they'll backstab us & can plan 4 it.
894596905203847169 2017-08-07 16:31:37 UTC <Vva10967> @AwardsDaily They were all fake scandals. Trump's RussiaGate is real.

894591881379815424 2017-08-07 16:11:39 UTC <Vva10967> @Amy_Siskind Thiel's Palantir also played a key role in Trump's election, helping Cambridge Analytica sort the data they had collected.

894247644532441088 2017-08-06 17:23:47 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou Weird no? And he also came up with "election is rigged" narrative that allowed Moscow to weaponize DNC emails Russia ALREADY had hacked...
894074832203198464 2017-08-05 05:57:05 UTC <Vva10967> @moonpieluva @WindyCitySoft @bravenak Trump didn't invent the racism & hate he ran on, he merely exploited what the GOP has been brewing since Nixon's Southern Strategy.

But Americans don't want it. They want to keep the choices of doctor & hospital & meds they have now.

890330774377037826 2017-07-26 21:59:32 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @MSNBC @chrislhayes @BLUpfront @ItheMissingLink @euroclyde @quitfixngGAMES @Mr_RedPants @PotPolitics @bwolman perhaps, but people who have it like it and don't want their government to change it. And that's a majority of the voters.

It's painful to explain it on Twitter with the 140 character limit.

Total Bullshit.

Kind of defeats your argument that it was about economics, no?

It wasn't.

890323218090926081 2017-07-26 21:29:31 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @MSNBC @chrislhayes @euroclyde @BLUpfront @PotPolitics @quitfixngGAMES Her campaign was correct. If Bernie wanted them to play along & help him continue w his farce that he could still win, he had to pay up.

890306997240967169 2017-07-26 20:25:03 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @flipflop4u2 it was definitely the 3rd party vote in the swing states that made Trump president. And that was the Bernie Cult saying FU to HRC.

890303178192891908 2017-07-26 20:09:53 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @LadyTetta THAT was the party's mistake that cost us the election and not the bullshit that @SenSchumer is saying now about Dem Party message.
890302790924476418 2017-07-26 20:08:21 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @LadyTetta Neither did Obama. That point was crossed in Mid March & for sure on 4/20 after NY. But Dem Party continued trashing of HRC by Bernie.

890084256713715712 2017-07-25 05:39:58 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 No. Warren fully supported Hillary on the campaign trail. Told audience HRC was a good person w good heart. Bernie didn't. Only attacked DJT
890081956901396481 2017-07-25 05:30:50 UTC <Vva10967> @flipflop4u2 @JoyAnnReid And the man who lost the popular vote by 3 million will sign it. All bc the BernieBros in the swing states wanted to protest vote on Nov 8.

889632961649414146 2017-07-24 23:46:41 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports @jeffsessions should get Trump back and bring him down. Trump is being disloyal &. throwing him under the bus.
889602141056368642 2017-07-24 21:44:13 UTC <Vva10967> @jasoninthehouse @greenhousenyt Oh and Chaffetz, the Statute of Limitations for the Espionage Act is 10 years, so it won't be too late to prosecute you in 2021!

889597357247148032 2017-07-24 21:25:12 UTC <Vva10967> @ChelseaClinton @jasoninthehouse needs to be investigated. I bet the Oct 28th Comey memo was classified at the time he sent it even if it wasn't marked.

889547335214170112 2017-07-24 18:06:26 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer Trump won & @HillaryClinton lost because Dem leadership allowed @SenSanders to trash her. It was 3rd party vote in swing states.https://twitter.com/rudepundit/status/889487159039807488

889542982906544128 2017-07-24 17:49:08 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump Because @HillaryClinton is NOT Crooked, YOU ARE. The Russians helped YOU win, because your people said you'd lift their US sanctions.

889363607317884928 2017-07-23 05:56:22 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill @18major @CcitySuave27 He protested in college like all good hippies of his generation did, and moved to white VT and never lifted a finger again to help blacks.

889280124763467781 2017-07-23 00:24:38 UTC <Vva10967> @isteintraum if it makes you feel better, her being so quiet is probably because she has a tight publication deadline for her 500+ pp book- September 12.
889277104969396225 2017-07-23 00:12:38 UTC <Vva10967> @CapehartJ unless they're angry at blacks, gays, immigrants, muslims, asians, refugees & a guy named Barack Obama....which is WHY they voted for Trump.
889261713589227520 2017-07-23 23:11:28 UTC <Vva10967> @iowademocrats @Lee_in_Iowa @AndreaJPhillips Yes, both are Obama districts that flipped to Trump.
889259124109783041 2017-07-23 23:01:11 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @SenSchumer @neeratanden Because we're the nice party that goes high when Republicans go low??? F*CK THAT! Unless & until we learn to go subterranean, we'll lose!
889258702120906752 2017-07-23 22:59:30 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer @neeratanden & Dems in power let the FBI go rogue on @HillaryClinton knowing Comey had violated DOJ rules in making his July 5th presser & said NOTHING!
889258157083643905 2017-07-23 22:57:20 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer @neeratanden The Republicans stood by their pussy-grabber-in-chief. We, Dems, let our superbly qualified candidate be trashed by the media & by Trump.
889257453703057410 2017-07-23 22:54:33 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer @neeratanden or that Dems let Bernie convince his followers that HRC was corrupt? or that Dems went along w media narrative that she was "flawed"?
889256587487055872 2017-07-23 22:51:06 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer @neeratanden or that Obama's timing with TPP hurt her with Rust Belt voters? or that Dems were NEVER able to defend the ACA until Trump was sworn in?
889256130702127108 2017-07-23 22:49:17 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer @neeratanden or that standing up 4 common sense gun legislation was risky? or that taking the side of BLM & Mothers of the Movement was offensive to WWC?
889250926531366913 2017-07-23 22:28:37 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer @neeratanden At what point do we say that she lost because she didn't appeal to white nationalism & didn't trash Obama LGBT or immigrants like Trump did?
889250334954192897 2017-07-23 22:26:15 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden But shouldn't @SenSchumer be saying the same thing about the 16 Republicans that Trump beat in the primary?
889249062310039554 2017-07-23 22:21:12 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump If they protected you more we'd have to try them for treason.

889196118357180418 2017-07-23 18:50:49 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod but consistent with the Party of Trump (the one formerly known as the GOP).
889191872580767744 2017-07-23 18:33:57 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein @DonaldJTrumpJr @AlexMohajer And Jill, like Moscow Mike Flynn, attended RT Dinner with Putin and sat at his table.

888928103610843136 2017-07-22 01:05:50 UTC <Vva10967> @peterbakernyt @maggieNYT Apples & Oranges. Republicans then were demanding Bill's head over a blow job. Republicans now are silent over collusion w Russia & treason.
888926982947442688 2017-07-22 01:01:22 UTC <Vva10967> @GovHowardDean And yet Comey thought that telling us about emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop was more important than telling us about Russia's interference
888818064296378369 2017-07-22 17:48:34 UTC <Vva10967> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump So if China is NOT a currency manipulator after all, what the hell is keeping you and @IvankaTrump from making YOUR products in America???

888788868631326720 2017-07-22 15:52:33 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump So are you saying that Trump Jr. will release ALL his PERSONAL emails? because that's what the 33K emails that you talk so much about were.
888623765596360704 2017-07-21 04:56:30 UTC <Vva10967> @CierPR @InSpiteOfTrump @peterdaou @Maxiesid Least he could do. His slanders of Hillary is what got Trump elected. And he knows they were slanders.

888268283698233344 2017-07-20 05:23:56 UTC <Vva10967> @grandoftwo @MrDane1982 @pennyw503 Pelosi then resigns as POTUS 46 and goes back to being Speaker and HRC becomes POTUS 47 and the 2 fix the damage caused by Trump.
888267273583992833 2017-07-20 05:19:55 UTC <Vva10967> @grandoftwo @MrDane1982 @pennyw503 I think Trump lasts until Dems take back the House in 2018 and Pence gets impeached too so we end up w POTUS Pelosi who names HRC as her VP
888265136850391042 2017-07-20 05:11:26 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu But is a pardon issued by an illegitimate POTUS valid if it turns out that Russia hacked voting and/or tallying machines in swing states?
888263444721311744 2017-07-20 05:04:43 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost Also the Russian disinformation campaign was aimed at the Berners not at the Trumpers & it was the Berners who protest voted  electing DJT.
888262814778834944 2017-07-20 05:02:12 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost We don't know if the voting and/or tallying machines in the swing states were hacked because DHS refuses to find out & hasn't examined any.
888260755027394561 2017-07-20 04:54:01 UTC <Vva10967> @PreetBharara @Dr_G_Enigma NYAG can strike at any time. Before or after pardons since Trump pardons would only apply to federal crimes. State crimes fall under Cuomo.
888259708926124032 2017-07-20 04:49:52 UTC <Vva10967> @dollyp724 Actually it was the BernieBros with their 3rd party protest votes in the swing states that elected Trump. He didn't have enough Deplorables.
888258453713465344 2017-07-20 04:44:53 UTC <Vva10967> @AwardsDaily Don't be too sure. It's Mueller time. He and his team don't have sacred cows. And Russian money was likely pouring into Bernie's campaign.
888216876211462144 2017-07-20 01:59:40 UTC <Vva10967> @thedailybanter @AwardsDaily They need to add Bernie who came up w the "rigged election" soundbite that Putin needed to weaponize DNC emails already hacked.

888133889255931905 2017-07-20 20:29:54 UTC <Vva10967> @BraddJaffy Trump has got to have Alzheimer's and no one in the media dares to say it. It runs in his family. His dad had it. He is showing the symptoms

887843275788480513 2017-07-19 01:15:06 UTC <Vva10967> @KatyTurNBC So 3 Million people voted illegally?  if so, I bet it was in the Red States and @realDonaldTrump is an ILLEGITIMATE PRESIDENT!
887836243551289344 2017-07-19 00:47:10 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Frankly, any New Yorker could tell you the same thing. It wasn't a secret.

887831183626821633 2017-07-19 00:27:03 UTC <Vva10967> @GovHowardDean I think he's been suffering from Alzheimer's for a while (since at least 2011) and no one dares to say it.  But it runs in his family.

887186135373447168 2017-07-17 05:43:52 UTC <Vva10967> @NewDay Trump voters embraced who he is and what he represents. The very worst of America. A grifter. A pussy grabber. A racist. A swindler. A liar.

884937590377504768 2017-07-11 00:48:57 UTC <Vva10967> @NevilleLouann @DanaHoule The 3rd party vote was the result of Bernie staying on too long & slandering HRC AND not walking back his attacks. Russia targetted Berners.

878859425553035264 2017-06-24 06:16:30 UTC <Vva10967> @deanofcomedy @jensimeo She also proposed letting people 50 to 64 enroll in Medicare.
878859204244774912 2017-06-24 06:15:37 UTC <Vva10967> @deanofcomedy @jensimeo HRC proposed adding a public option to the ACA to bring competition to markets that had only one or no carriers left.
878858380009451521 2017-06-24 06:12:20 UTC <Vva10967> @deanofcomedy @IndivisibleClay @dtmfman Not quite how that works. The Defense companies do the selling after the feds approve the sale.

878659445059932160 2017-06-24 17:01:51 UTC <Vva10967> Looks like the Sanders will get to find out what it's like to be hunted down by the Right Wing like the Clintons have been for years.https://twitter.com/CBSThisMorning/status/878563087636418561
878658364825317376 2017-06-24 16:57:33 UTC <Vva10967> @deanofcomedy @jensimeo True but that's not the same thing as Medicare For All.
878658074785067010 2017-06-24 16:56:24 UTC <Vva10967> @deanofcomedy @IndivisibleClay @dtmfman Or she doesn't want to freak out the entire country with the price tag and lose the chance of getting back the House in 2018.
878657759620849664 2017-06-24 16:55:09 UTC <Vva10967> @deanofcomedy Talk is cheap. You should educate yourself on what Medicare for All entails particularly its cost before you criticize the Dems in the House
878657350906900480 2017-06-24 16:53:31 UTC <Vva10967> @deanofcomedy Medicaid, which TrumpCare is defunding, does more than provide healthcare.Besides Trump said he alone could fix it.Doesn't need or want Dems
878656540194082817 2017-06-24 16:50:18 UTC <Vva10967> @deanofcomedy @IndivisibleClay @dtmfman No, it's because the price tag will scare people in 2018 and hand the House to the Republicans again. #RealityCheck
878655941402664960 2017-06-24 16:47:55 UTC <Vva10967> @KyDems @VABVOX @NastyNastyVet @WithoutaTRACE I thought it was very odd of the Dem party in general to hide that Kynect & Obamacare were the same thing when so many people loved Kynect.
878653065846542338 2017-06-24 16:36:30 UTC <Vva10967> @VABVOX Who knew that little kid would do so much damage to our country when he grew up and aged! And he didn't look like a turtle back then.

878490921712668672 2017-06-23 05:52:11 UTC <Vva10967> @evansiegfried It's not the language but your party's actions. Trumpcare is cruel and will kill people. The phrase death panels was invented by GOP in 2010
878488524382769154 2017-06-23 05:42:40 UTC <Vva10967> @voxdotcom @washingtonpost @nytimes @maddow @Lawrence @JoyAnnReid Can one of you correct his claim? Is he naming post offices? https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/878200921980891136
878486682886168577 2017-06-23 05:35:21 UTC <Vva10967> @KyDems @VABVOX @NastyNastyVet If Mitch passes Trumpcare that will likely bring him down in 2020, along w the rest of the GOP, assuming he decides to run for reelection.
878484987925934080 2017-06-23 05:28:37 UTC <Vva10967> @KyDems @VABVOX @NastyNastyVet If Trumpcare passes, the 2020 election will likely be a repeal & replace Trumpcare election.
878484582944952320 2017-06-23 05:27:00 UTC <Vva10967> @KyDems @VABVOX @NastyNastyVet And yet until recently you had a Democratic governor in KY. And State AG & Sec of State are also both Dems.
878378706531753989 2017-06-23 22:26:17 UTC <Vva10967> @AlGiordano mmmm, the vote could be over come next Thurs.
878378017747161088 2017-06-23 22:23:33 UTC <Vva10967> @oscarmiked The @nytimes has a misogyny problem.  It gave us Trump w its false equivalencies. Or maybe bc it thought Trump would be good for business?
878377134611243009 2017-06-23 22:20:03 UTC <Vva10967> @JohnAvlon @JoyAnnReid ask @ananavarro how and where she took that selfie with Bill Clinton.  Why is he also in FL?
878374925463035904 2017-06-23 22:11:16 UTC <Vva10967> @KyDems @VABVOX @NastyNastyVet In total only 8 GOP senators are up for reelection in 2018.Other 4 GOP up R:  John Barrasso WY Roger Wicker MS Bob Corker TN Orrin Hatch UT
878374067845435392 2017-06-23 22:07:51 UTC <Vva10967> @KyDems @VABVOX @NastyNastyVet we would need to flip 3 senate seats in 2018- Dean Heller in NV, Jeff Flake in AZ, & maybe Deb Fischer in NE or Ted Cruz in TX #UphillBattle
878373298555547648 2017-06-23 22:04:48 UTC <Vva10967> @KyDems @VABVOX @NastyNastyVet Mitch is not up for reelection until 2020 & the outlook for taking the Senate back in  2018 isn't great as very few GOP senators are up.
878368230397550592 2017-06-23 21:44:40 UTC <Vva10967> @sarahkendzior @itsjasonborne @AmericanMOM01 and revealing & making public every detail of his investigation into the collusion w Russia like he did with the HRC email investigation.

878367261567983616 2017-06-23 21:40:49 UTC <Vva10967> @Shakestweetz @sarahkendzior @joynorr @shernansanz @pragovnj She lost by less than 78,000 votes in MI WI & PA. A lot of those millennials marching on 1/21 admitted they voted third party or not at all.
878366566135480320 2017-06-23 21:38:03 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid but if the cost shifts to the states, his constituents' STATE taxes will go up, probably by a lot.

877751147032788992 2017-06-21 04:52:35 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @carolealana And the ones taking their jobs are NOT illegal. They have visas because people like Trump abuse the system & hire foreigners to save money.
877749731665072132 2017-06-21 04:46:58 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @ScaryKlown Actually we need to focus on voter registration & on fighting back voter suppression.
877749374633353216 2017-06-21 04:45:33 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @TxsDem @Deborahtaxi No, we don't vote issues either. Our side is easily misled by the Right & is into purity tests & that is why we lose. Rs fall in line & win.
877746442479312896 2017-06-21 04:33:54 UTC <Vva10967> @sahilkapur If press had any self respect they would all boycott those briefings.
877687307767361536 2017-06-21 00:38:55 UTC <Vva10967> Did you check his timeline?  He is a BernieCrat. Even attended and spoke at PeopleSummit.
877681300118933505 2017-06-21 00:15:03 UTC <Vva10967> @ABCPolitics Actually the electoral college spoke. Russia spoke. The public chose Hillary Clinton by almost 3 million more votes.
877657151078092800 2017-06-21 22:39:05 UTC <Vva10967> @sethmoulton @jaketapper @18major @JohnnyFromGT And GA-06 has been Republican since at least 1992. You won't sell a district that is majority college-educated on socialism & min wage.
877656376473927680 2017-06-21 22:36:00 UTC <Vva10967> @sethmoulton @jaketapper @18major @JohnnyFromGT Dems need to register voters and fight voter suppression and stop being purists and self-sabotaging.  Our politics ARE tribal and Rs vote R.
877655965947969536 2017-06-21 22:34:22 UTC <Vva10967> @sethmoulton @jaketapper @18major or maybe we will in 2018, if Ossoff runs again and wins.
877655619397976064 2017-06-21 22:33:00 UTC <Vva10967> @sethmoulton @jaketapper @18major Ossoff may have won if media hadn't focused so much on the GA-06 race & made it a referendum on Trump that GOP then HAD to win at all co$t.
877654529239425024 2017-06-21 22:28:40 UTC <Vva10967> @LincolnsBible @JoyAnnReid Or Barack Obama. And Obama was young and a newcomer and became the person most vilified by the GOP, probably even more than HRC & Pelosi.
877654059045486593 2017-06-21 22:26:48 UTC <Vva10967> @LincolnsBible @JoyAnnReid Based on the comments you're getting, most Americans don't know what the Speaker and the Minority Leader do. Sad!
877653679909855232 2017-06-21 22:25:17 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @DianeBrewer99 @LincolnsBible The role of the Speaker & of the minority leader isn't to lead, it's to gather & count VOTES to pass legislation. And to fundraise 4 party.
877652879384956928 2017-06-21 22:22:07 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @LincolnsBible Republicans won control LYING about Obamacare in 2010, saying that it contained DEATH PANELS and obstructing Obama and his agenda.
877651462003621888 2017-06-21 22:16:29 UTC <Vva10967> @sethmoulton @jaketapper @18major GOP also won't be able to play defense in the large amounts that it spent on the GA-06 race when entire House is up for reelection in 2018.
877651063284748296 2017-06-21 22:14:54 UTC <Vva10967> @sethmoulton @jaketapper You can't win if your voters can't vote, no matter who House and Senate Dem leaders are.
877650431140401152 2017-06-21 22:12:23 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper Maybe @sethmoulton should be more concerned about GOP voter suppression efforts including voter ID, CrossCheck & intimidation of organizers.
877649116594970624 2017-06-21 22:07:09 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump's numbers must be bad if the poll that favors him has him down to 45%!https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/877648669734043649
877648172188913664 2017-06-21 22:03:24 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @MonicaChilton @GussRuralWA I also don't put Biden in the same category as HRC & Pelosi. If the choice were Biden or Sanders & anyone else, I'd pick anyone else.
877647637113167872 2017-06-21 22:01:17 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @MonicaChilton @GussRuralWA I prefer brilliant older leaders like HRC & Pelosi to inexperienced ones. And age hasn't kept Mitch from implementing GOP wet dream.
877646424372002816 2017-06-21 21:56:28 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @imwithher61 Bernie's Cult is now going after Kamala Harris, while GOP is trying to shut her up. It doesn't matter WHO the woman is, but that she is one.
877588645120573440 2017-06-21 18:06:52 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @MaddowBlog @Lawrence @JoyAnnReid @nytimes @washingtonpost @jaketapper This should be a HUGE story &  BIG SCANDAL & needs follow up!https://twitter.com/ByronTau/status/877534203163947008
877587525698801668 2017-06-21 18:02:25 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh @BookieStompers Yeah, that way we can end up with a House that has 400+ Republicans in 2018. 
877586681641054208 2017-06-21 17:59:04 UTC <Vva10967> @RepAdamSchiff Even with hack of voter registration systems, why not find out how many provisional ballots were cast and NOT counted in MI WI PA NC and FL?
877585968940896256 2017-06-21 17:56:14 UTC <Vva10967> @RepAdamSchiff Same with vote tallying machines. It's all based on assumptions, not physical evidence. As if Gov was afraid of finding out the truth?
877585610248040448 2017-06-21 17:54:48 UTC <Vva10967> @RepAdamSchiff why doesn't committee ever ask witnesses who say voting machines weren't compromised how they know that? No forensic audits were performed.
877585225743814665 2017-06-21 17:53:17 UTC <Vva10967> So Comey was ONLY one who knew of FBI investigation into Trump Campaign for Collusion & COVERED IT UP on Oct 28thhttp://to.pbs.org/2rCXLWd
877583613939695616 2017-06-21 17:46:52 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @KarenCisMe But they claim that the illegals are stealing their jobs.  Well, these are the jobs the illegals are "stealing", they should go fill them!
877583269776064513 2017-06-21 17:45:30 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @Lawrence @JoyAnnReid Can U do a follow up story on this Daily Beast report?Maybe ask @RepAdamSchiff why it isn't asked at hearings?https://twitter.com/thedailybeast/status/877500130261389314
877582360421609472 2017-06-21 17:41:54 UTC <Vva10967> It's like our government is afraid of the truth.Its assumption that votes weren't altered are based on suppositions & NOT audited machines!https://twitter.com/thedailybeast/status/877500130261389314
877581457404952576 2017-06-21 17:38:18 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill @neeratanden so if voting systems weren't audited, how can DHS or FBI affirm votes weren't altered to favor Trump & GOP?https://twitter.com/Khanoisseur/status/877576141783027712
877580944634466304 2017-06-21 17:36:16 UTC <Vva10967> @Amy_Siskind Seems that our government was afraid of finding out the truth or engaged in a cover up of the truth that vote result was altered to favor T
877576040507375617 2017-06-21 17:16:47 UTC <Vva10967> Hey, now all those Trump voters in coal country and in the Rustbelt that were promised jobs by Trump can move to Kansas! Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!!!https://twitter.com/BW/status/877193023469355010
877568257988939776 2017-06-21 16:45:51 UTC <Vva10967> @daveweigel The attention the race got nationally as a referendum on Trump is what sank Ossoff by attracting all that GOP PAC money. It wasn't 1:1 match
877566898790998016 2017-06-21 16:40:27 UTC <Vva10967> @FightingMad1 @davidfrum Not just any cake, Mar-A-Lago chocolate cake. Most beautiful cake.
877391114529116160 2017-06-20 05:01:57 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein Or more likely that we need to intensify voter registration efforts between now and Nov 2018 & maybe challenge ID law.
877379331701354496 2017-06-20 04:15:08 UTC <Vva10967> @harrisonjaime and this close result in SC-05 proves that you are right when you say that SC can be competitive is Dems invest money there.
877379163337797632 2017-06-20 04:14:28 UTC <Vva10967> @harrisonjaime it looks good for 2018 though. GOP won't be able to invest the high amounts they invested in these 4 special elections in 2018.
877376784265879552 2017-06-20 04:05:00 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias So if Dems take the House in 2018, will you publicly apologize to Nancy Pelosi for acting like a sexist pig?
877374912779964416 2017-06-20 03:57:34 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid They abstain because they want to fall in love.  Republicans fall in line, whether or not they like their candidate, and thus they win.
877374253355724801 2017-06-20 03:54:57 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid that they engaged in voter intimidation & threatened 2 jail group doing  registration & that they implemented CrossCheck to throw people off
877373841789636609 2017-06-20 03:53:19 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid You also ignore that Handel as Sec of State worked to defranchise voters, that they lost thousands of voter registration forms,
877373643638136832 2017-06-20 03:52:32 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid You assume that the Dems that live in GA-06 are Socialist BernieBots like you and not Center-Right Dems.
877372654310838276 2017-06-20 03:48:36 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden When they go low, we need to go subterranean. We really need to stop being the "nice" party.Republicans keep pushing and crossing all lines.
877371649619664897 2017-06-20 03:44:36 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid And Ossof did well considering how much money was thrown by GOP to defeat him because GA-06 race was made into a Referendum on Trump.
877371402327695361 2017-06-20 03:43:37 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Medicare-For-All has issues.  People in GA-06 understand that. They don't just go for logos like you Berners do.
877370799321174016 2017-06-20 03:41:13 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid The GA-06 IS a GOP district. Over half the people there have college degrees. They're NOT making minimum wage, they care about tax rates.
877369850498236416 2017-06-20 03:37:27 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @PracticalLefty Not to burst your bubble, but we don't have a Great Depression with 50%+ unemployment caused by the GOP POTUS to make everyone flip tribes.
877369129329508353 2017-06-20 03:34:35 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @saysthepea The SC race was surprisingly close.  2000 votes. A voter registration could flip it.
877368561324277760 2017-06-20 03:32:20 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid The country is center. Has been for the past oh, 50 years. Even Democrats don't want to be taxed at 90% rates.
877368021035122689 2017-06-20 03:30:11 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid The Republicans do, that's why they keep winning. They fall in line & win & get to implement their awful agenda & strip people's rights.
877311627556786176 2017-06-20 23:46:06 UTC <Vva10967> @TomPerez @keithellison you need to rethink your strategy or we are going to MISS our one & only chance to take the House back in 2018.https://twitter.com/MrDane1982/status/877296491521560576
877258683704651776 2017-06-20 20:15:43 UTC <Vva10967> @keithellison maybe you should have this conversation with @SenSanders?

876665794935103488 2017-06-18 04:59:47 UTC <Vva10967> @TomPerez & @DNC haven't figured that out yet. They seem willing to let the Young Turks reshape Dem Party so as to LOSE future elections. https://twitter.com/tomwatson/status/876439576465866757
876623096169549824 2017-06-18 02:10:07 UTC <Vva10967> @Gus_802 And while we are st it can you also fundraise for my candidates? 
876558722486734851 2017-06-18 21:54:19 UTC <Vva10967> Hey BernieBusters, this would NEVER have happened in a Hillary presidency. This is on you, YOU elected Trump w your 3rd party protest votes. https://twitter.com/hiphopsrevival/status/876088980697174017
876554194521554945 2017-06-18 21:36:20 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden I don't understand why @TomPerez and the DNC keep appeasing the Young Turks. They are funded by the GOP & keep attacking & undermining Dems.
876310063165693952 2017-06-17 05:26:14 UTC <Vva10967> @GeorgeTakei And the play is scheduled to end today. It was always scheduled to end today.

875147956676173825 2017-06-14 00:28:26 UTC <Vva10967> @chucktodd Hope most folks realize that shootings by angry men are an every day occurrence in a country with over 350 million guns. Y no reports on SF?

875143920488939520 2017-06-14 00:12:24 UTC <Vva10967> @KaraCalavera @reesetheone1 I think that's a photo of Seth Rich, the DNC staffer that Fox ( Hannity) is claiming was murdered by the Clintons. Far Left believes it too.
875043657031835651 2017-06-14 17:34:00 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Especially Florida. The early vote predicted she would win & GOP has made it impossible to request recounts. And FL was target of hacks.
875043078003929088 2017-06-14 17:31:41 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid And if the GOP knew or found out, they would hide it because they've proven that they will go to ANY length to win & put Party Over Country.
875042818934411265 2017-06-14 17:30:40 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid It's like our government is hiding something and/or is afraid to admit that the vote/tallies could have been tampered with.
875042465312636928 2017-06-14 17:29:15 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Also claim by FBI that hackers didn't change votes or tallies.  No one has stated that machines were forensically examined to prove it.
875042128384188416 2017-06-14 17:27:55 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid If registration rolls were changed by hackers, people would have been forced to cast provisional ballots & I bet GOP states would toss those
875041911303790597 2017-06-14 17:27:03 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid I don't think anyone has looked at the number of provisional ballots rejected in MI WI PA FL & NC? Were numbers unusually high?
874867657136377858 2017-06-13 05:54:38 UTC <Vva10967> @SenJohnMcCain @politico And if you pass TrumpCare without a hearing you could also lose the Senate.

874768203817287684 2017-06-13 23:19:26 UTC <Vva10967> @AwardsDaily AND when the candidates he endorses keep losing?
874758496608301056 2017-06-13 22:40:52 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @EricBoehlert So Hillary will remain only person in US history dragged through the mud by a rogue FBI Director who found she had NOT committed any crime!
874757831655870464 2017-06-13 22:38:13 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert They also fired Comey so Comey couldn't do to Trump what he did to @HillaryClinton upon concluding the email investigation on July 5, 2016.
874756794886742017 2017-06-13 22:34:06 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump You obviously didn't read the memo Rod wrote so you could fire Comey.  COMEY took the decision away from AG Lynch.

874741172014649344 2017-06-13 21:32:01 UTC <Vva10967> @angiedam2 Lol. No. They were outraged that Comey would treat Trump as badly as he treated @HillaryClinton so they stopped him before he would.

874510544925069312 2017-06-12 06:15:36 UTC <Vva10967> @BettieRose100 Actually if Perriello loses it will be bc he is now perceived as being tied to Bernie. Podesta & Valerie Jarrett back him.

873210666626232321 2017-06-09 16:10:21 UTC <Vva10967> @guardian And in all other countries, the person with the most votes is the winner of the election.  Not so in the US.
873210386211893248 2017-06-09 16:09:14 UTC <Vva10967> @guardian you also are comparing apples to oranges.  Hillary got 3 million more votes than Trump & because of Electoral College she still "lost".
873210159610441728 2017-06-09 16:08:20 UTC <Vva10967> @guardian We need to educate people in the US so they don't fall again for targeted Russian propaganda but with Fox here that is a higher climb.
873209881263788032 2017-06-09 16:07:13 UTC <Vva10967> @guardian No, they knew better. They were aware of Cambridge Analytical's game & its connection to Putin, the Mercers & Trump thanks to your reporting
873208253664153602 2017-06-09 16:00:45 UTC <Vva10967> @SenJohnMcCain Trump's Presidency & putting Party over Country has REALLY affected you.https://twitter.com/matthewamiller/status/872855048879050753
873205548245811202 2017-06-09 15:50:00 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @VABVOX @puppymnkey @jmbler I think she was poorly advised. She also should not have apologized for the server. That apology reinforced the must-be-guilty narrative.
873041743968477185 2017-06-08 04:59:06 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @VABVOX @purrfectmusic He presumed her guilty. Was clearly biased and should have recused himself from emails investigation.
873041164424826881 2017-06-08 04:56:48 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @VABVOX @puppymnkey @jmbler No one asked Comey why HE didn't recuse himself from emails investigation given long history he had with the Clintons.
873036541202845699 2017-06-08 04:38:26 UTC <Vva10967> @clapifyoulikeme And why do they continue to lose?  Their Latest casualty was John Wisniewski in the Dem primary for governor. Came in third.
873031684844683265 2017-06-08 04:19:08 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem How much would the endorsed candidates get?
873009089592393729 2017-06-08 02:49:21 UTC <Vva10967> @AriMelber Comey was an investigator in Whitewater & a prosecutor in Mark Rich & another case pardoned by WJC. Also spent years investigating pardons.
873008400908660736 2017-06-08 02:46:37 UTC <Vva10967> @AriMelber Why doesn't anyone ask Comey why HE didn't recuse himself from the emails investigation given his long history with the Clintons?
873003625081122817 2017-06-08 02:27:38 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @michaeldweiss @macmcd @saintmaggie @cheetahjr Women & POC are the base, NOT the WWC men Bernie is chasing after. Cash strapped candidates don't win elections & thus can't change laws.
872948279142739969 2017-06-08 22:47:42 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @SeanMichaelE That's the simple explanation he gives to the masses who don't even know what exactly Glass Steagall provides & what caused the 2008 crash.
872947641491099648 2017-06-08 22:45:10 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @SeanMichaelE It's not purity. It's against the law for him to accept speaking fees, something he conveniently failed to mention in the primary debates.
872947031379259392 2017-06-08 22:42:45 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @SeanMichaelE True No audience likes to be insulted so why would they invite him? And it is also ILLEGAL for a sitting Senator to get paid for a speech.
872946051329732609 2017-06-08 22:38:51 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @SeanMichaelE No matter what their topic is. HRC would sell out an event even if she were just reading Chelsea's She Persisted children's book.
872945002992869376 2017-06-08 22:34:41 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @SeanMichaelE Rich people tend to be busy & only go to meetings or conferences if they find the speaker(s) compelling.HRC is compelling as are both Obamas
872943801064718336 2017-06-08 22:29:55 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @SeanMichaelE Goldman Sachs will invite & pay anybody interesting & accomplished enough to get their target audience in the room. That is HRC Obama NOT BS
872942913482838020 2017-06-08 22:26:23 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @SeanMichaelE Lol. Wall Street does well when the economy does well & under the Clintons the economy did extremely well for everyone not just the top 1%.
872940944047341568 2017-06-08 22:18:34 UTC <Vva10967> @ericswalwell @CatchaRUSSpy Nor has anyone at hearings asked how many provisional ballots went uncounted in MI WI PA FL & NC since Russians hacked voting registrations.
872940161058918402 2017-06-08 22:15:27 UTC <Vva10967> @CatchaRUSSpy On the machines no one at hearings has asked if any machines in WI MI PA FL or NC were forensically examined by FBI. @ericswalwell
872863765460635648 2017-06-08 17:11:53 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @SeanMichaelE So the Speaker must be interesting and accomplished enough to sell out the event. Bernie ain't either for the audience sought.
872863266875244545 2017-06-08 17:09:54 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @SeanMichaelE Businesses conferences & fundraisers pay those fees when they think they can recover them & make a profit on top.
872862642226028545 2017-06-08 17:07:25 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @SeanMichaelE Nop. My argument is that reason Bernie won't get paid high fees after he leaves Senate is not purity but lack of paying audience interest.
872861633084870656 2017-06-08 17:03:24 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily "Tracey" is a Berner. I just blocked her. Too similar to Trumpers.
872857304978292736 2017-06-08 16:46:13 UTC <Vva10967> @morganarae @ericgarland @SenJohnMcCain is losing it. He also kept confusing Comey with Trump. Even called Comey "President Comey"
872856095211089921 2017-06-08 16:41:24 UTC <Vva10967> @AJentleson He also keeps calling Trump "President Comey" 
872855901371334658 2017-06-08 16:40:38 UTC <Vva10967> @AJentleson Or @SenJohnMcCain is showing signs of senility
872855469685174274 2017-06-08 16:38:55 UTC <Vva10967> @SenJohnMcCain is acting senile. Now he thinks @HillaryClinton coordinated with Russia to sabotage her own campaign! 
872697870738227200 2017-06-07 06:12:40 UTC <Vva10967> @MMwrites @SallyAlbright @UpNorth62 @jmbler The Steele Dossier speaks of Russia having assets in the Democratic Party side of things.
872695754271457281 2017-06-07 06:04:16 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @Skylar_Writer She visited PA tons of times & was winning the Philly suburbs until Comey sent his Oct 28 letter. Trump's win in FL also looks suspect.
872691846388035584 2017-06-07 05:48:44 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @IamDaveHobbs @notmemyego And Bernie's I haven't gotten paid for speeches purity was total bullshit!Sitting Senators are prohibited BY LAW from charging for speeches!
872691456582045697 2017-06-07 05:47:11 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @IamDaveHobbs @notmemyego Exactly and she said enough of the double standard and presumption of guilt.
872690510271569920 2017-06-07 05:43:26 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @IamDaveHobbs The type of people that GS wants to attract to its events will take the time to come when the speaker is HRC or Obama no matter the topic.
872689782190739456 2017-06-07 05:40:32 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @IamDaveHobbs And no, she isn't paid the big bucks for what she is going to say. She gets paid the big bucks for who she is and what she has accomplished.
872688880847343616 2017-06-07 05:36:57 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @IamDaveHobbs You Berners are so dumb. You think speakers like Hillary talk about some secret plot to take over the world when they talk to Goldman Sachs.
872688415472574464 2017-06-07 05:35:06 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily I can't imagine PAYING to go listen to Bernie scream about breaking up the banks and then proceeding to trash the Dem Party.
872687506197753856 2017-06-07 05:31:29 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily Every event that Hillary has spoken at this year has sold out after it's announced that she's speaking there. Same with Obamas.
872686968601280512 2017-06-07 05:29:21 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily To command a large fee, your presence must cause the event to sell out at rather high prices since most are conferences or fundraisers.
872686481223159808 2017-06-07 05:27:25 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily He probably will not. Hillary and Obama are extremely accomplished people. WJC was POTUS.  Bernie is a failed primary candidate & will fade.
872685951973195776 2017-06-07 05:25:19 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @Gregorygurley @NomikiKonst Bernie has Wall Street investments and makes money off them.  Bet there are some banks and "evil" corporations among them.
872685647089348609 2017-06-07 05:24:06 UTC <Vva10967> @WaywardWinifred @JoyAnnReid @NomikiKonst @AwardsDaily @IamDaveHobbs The speeches were not secret. You know about them because Hillary has published her tax returns w ALL attachments for the past 30 years.
872643247214137345 2017-06-07 02:35:37 UTC <Vva10967> @isteintraum Have you noticed that you have a lock icon next to your name & that your tweets cannot be retweeted?  Seems Twitter is censoring users?

872561225095409664 2017-06-07 21:09:42 UTC <Vva10967> @daveweigel So who is going to fund it? the BernieBros? 
872560592967565313 2017-06-07 21:07:11 UTC <Vva10967> @tedlieu which makes you wonder if Coats and Rogers took Trump's loyalty oath?
871936626515210244 2017-06-05 03:47:46 UTC <Vva10967> @marceelias They shouldn't have voted for Trump. He was clear on where he stood on climate change & on the Paris Agreement.
871935383189192704 2017-06-05 03:42:49 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump maybe you should take a briefing on how cases in general work and how the SCOTUS cases in particular do.
871930583676485632 2017-06-05 03:23:45 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou I hope @HillaryClinton ignores all these a-holes who continue to be afraid of a brilliant woman.We CANNOT let misogyny triumph.#StillWithHer

871878968345079808 2017-06-05 23:58:39 UTC <Vva10967> @politico Articles like this make me CHEER when the Orange Fuhrer and Spicer roll you over. You made him POTUS. You deserve him.  #karma.
871878645236867073 2017-06-05 23:57:22 UTC <Vva10967> @politico I wouldn't call male misogynist journos like JOSHUA ZEITZ "a large portion of America". Your journos' ego is as big as Trump's.

871603631698706432 2017-06-04 05:44:34 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost The MSM enabled the election of Trump with your character assassination, misogyny & sexism against Hillary so just stop.

871509938711011328 2017-06-04 23:32:15 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro No offense but none of those things sounds compelling. Even McCain is having a hard time finding his valor under Trump, all talk, no action.
871505254235467776 2017-06-04 23:13:39 UTC <Vva10967> @jmpalmieri The media so deserves it though.  Like @HillaryClinton said, they treated her email server like Pearl Harbor! They have lots of mea culpas.
871247514330157056 2017-06-03 06:09:29 UTC <Vva10967> @selectedwisdom What's mind boggling is that college educated Republicans voted 4 him. He showed us how ignorant, arrogant & stupid he was during campaign.

871170918340546560 2017-06-03 01:05:07 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow @JoyAnnReid why does @krystalball hate the Clintons so much?  She blames WJC for deregulation & income inequality that started under Reagan!
870877603758059520 2017-06-02 05:39:35 UTC <Vva10967> @Newsweek Putin probably ordered Trump to do it to prove to Europe that they cannot rely on the US keeping its word anymore. #PutinPuppet
870817384201891840 2017-06-02 01:40:18 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews The media acts like @HillaryClinton is somehow responsible for the > 1000 State & Federal losses Dems took in 2010, 2012 & 2014.
870816817819922435 2017-06-02 01:38:03 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews But what she said it's true, the DNC and the 50 State Strategy that brought Dems back to power in 2006 and 2008 was left to starve for cash.
870813687153610753 2017-06-02 01:25:36 UTC <Vva10967> I would bet that Trump has never opened the Bible and has no clue what's in it. https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/870693471677329409

870521966825881600 2017-06-01 06:06:25 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden Have you noticed how the BernieCrats & the Trumpers repeat the same right wing nonsense about Soros? Also about HRC.Hard to tell them apart!
870488829911736320 2017-06-01 03:54:44 UTC <Vva10967> @SethAbramson @danpfeiffer actually I think the reason Syria didn't sign is because they couldn't go to Paris due to sanctions, not because of Accord's terms.
870486592363704320 2017-06-01 03:45:51 UTC <Vva10967> @SethAbramson Is that the sale of the 19.5% Rosneft stake to the secret buyer which Steele Dossier says is Trump's reward for removing Russian sanctions?
870484506083561472 2017-06-01 03:37:33 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper So he touted Obama's accomplishments that Pruitt is trying his best to undo & proceeded to flat out LIE about what HE is proposing 4 future?
870480240879050756 2017-06-01 03:20:36 UTC <Vva10967> @RWPUSA But then again, steel workers in Pittsburgh knew that he was a con artist, Pittsburgh voted for @HillaryClinton and HER vision for America.

870290006816034821 2017-06-01 14:44:41 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias They even believe that trump is pro-labor union when he has fought unionization in his own casinos and hotels. But sure, her emails!!!!
870289429251969025 2017-06-01 14:42:23 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Thanks to awful media coverage people in rust belt believe Trump is a successful business man that can bring back jobs and prosperity.
870288887524052992 2017-06-01 14:40:14 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Maybe media should have exposed Trump's multiple frauds & cons & business fails AND ties to Russia instead of obsessing with HRC's emails.
870166396407304192 2017-05-31 06:33:30 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @AtlantaTANNT @flipflop4u2 @CNN is a joke now. Their CEO is a friend of Trump and only cares about ratings. He also ruined NBC until Comcast bought it and fired him.
870165586315235328 2017-05-31 06:30:17 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @flipflop4u2 That's crazy! They let Berners and Trumpers be abusive but they censor you for criticizing CNN??? @jack, that's messed up man!
870162312015040512 2017-05-31 06:17:16 UTC <Vva10967> @willmenaker Republicans and especially Trump always, always project. They need to see a shrink!
870145793755414529 2017-05-31 05:11:38 UTC <Vva10967> @NickMerrill I'm waiting for when HRC tells the world in a chat what we all know: that the reason Trump fails is that he's unfit, incompetent & inept.
870141921251012608 2017-05-31 04:56:15 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @Lawrence Congrats Lawrence! You, Rachel and @JoyAnnReid are Must-See-TV in the era of the Resistance.

869978079594110978 2017-05-31 18:05:12 UTC <Vva10967> @owillis The @nytimes used its credibility to validate EmailGate and the Uranium One claims in Clinton Cash book which was a routine CFIUS review.
869977676362113025 2017-05-31 18:03:36 UTC <Vva10967> @owillis I subscribe because of their RussiaGate coverage but like you said the current public editor failed the public in the 2016 election.
869976138067660800 2017-05-31 17:57:29 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow Marcus has a point.  Why is Krystal Ball going on air & writing books about what the Dem Party has to do to win?https://twitter.com/marcushjohnson/status/869962520118738945
869975149113692164 2017-05-31 17:53:33 UTC <Vva10967> @GeeOhPees2 yeah, keep telling yourself that. GOP has a 2 FT dossier on Bernie that it can deploy on him at anytime. Hillary spared him.

869970667114033152 2017-05-31 17:35:44 UTC <Vva10967> @RioSlade Still lost. And I'm pretty sure it's no longer being contested. She lost. Google it.
869970423584362499 2017-05-31 17:34:46 UTC <Vva10967> @RioSlade Quist had 16 years of unpaid debts. MT was winnable if Dems had run a viable candidate. Dem had just won Governorship in MT in November.
869969988446277632 2017-05-31 17:33:03 UTC <Vva10967> @RioSlade she was lucky that he didn't decide to show up to campaign for her

Bernie's FAR LEFT candidates continue to lose.

Hillary lost the election by 78,000 votes thanks to idiots who voted 3rd party. 66 million voted FOR her.

869791505736757248 2017-05-30 05:43:49 UTC <Vva10967> @rubycramer @edabny54 I miss her too & still feel nauseous when I remember that the pussy grabber is POTUS. Hope Comey burns in hell for having been such a dick.

869439103984705536 2017-05-29 06:23:30 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT @nytimes @RepDonBeyer So establishing a COVERT  COMMUNICATIONS CHANNEL with an enemy of the United States that has just attacked us is now legal? @MalcolmNance
869365737181372417 2017-05-29 01:31:58 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill yes, they also limit the hours that the places that issue drivers licenses are open in areas that are predominantly black, latino or poor.
869365077882830848 2017-05-29 01:29:21 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill so they'll say that a Hunter ID is okay bc most hunters love guns & vote Republican but a college ID is NOT okay bc young people vote Dem
869364303320817664 2017-05-29 01:26:16 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill the Democratic party and civil rights groups have to keep bringing lawsuits against the states but it is a long process that can take years.
869364019014103040 2017-05-29 01:25:08 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill not that hard but they are passing voter ID laws, that say that even if you register, you cannot vote unless you show a specified type of ID
869363653270794240 2017-05-29 01:23:41 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill And our voting laws change from state to state, so all the states that are controlled by Republicans are passing voter suppression laws,
869362825243889665 2017-05-29 01:20:24 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill We agree but the Republican party has discovered that they can only win if they suppress the vote, so they do.
869362143476539393 2017-05-29 01:17:41 UTC <Vva10967> @Freeyourmindkid maybe Raul Castro will offer Trump a hotel in Cuba and change his mind....
869361477412671488 2017-05-29 01:15:02 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill @astrtch2k especially when he is up for reelection in 2018.  He'll want to suppress the vote.
869361282130030596 2017-05-29 01:14:16 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill in the United States the Republican party tries to keep poor people, blacks, latinos, asians & women from voting bc they tend to vote Dem.
869360868945014784 2017-05-29 01:12:37 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill it's not a done deal yet, it still needs to go to their state senate and be signed by their Republican governor who is up for reelection.

869352523819253761 2017-05-29 00:39:28 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @mdeloge 77,759 if you want to be exact: 22,748 in WI, 44,307 in PA and 10,704 in MI.
869352135401627648 2017-05-29 00:37:55 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @mdeloge He even reinforced notion that she couldn't be trusted, often saying You All Will Have To Hold Her Accountable after the election is over.
869351894627561473 2017-05-29 00:36:58 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @mdeloge I listened to his post-convention rallies & he never walked back his slanders of HRC. Message was that Trump was bad, not that HRC was good.
869351511704432640 2017-05-29 00:35:26 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @mdeloge True that most did, but there were enough in MI WI & PA 78,000 to be exact who didn't & protest voted, delivering the Presidency to Trump.
869350320710844416 2017-05-29 00:30:42 UTC <Vva10967> @npfandos @reaDonaldTrump @Fahrenthold and I bet his voters believe it's true no matter what anyone else says!
869349536074002432 2017-05-29 00:27:35 UTC <Vva10967> What happens when you elect an incompetent man with zero attention span who cannot comprehend what he reads & thinks he knows it all anyway!https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/869176543381270528

869348000916803584 2017-05-29 00:21:29 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @IrfanSabrina Actually Dem Governor, not Senator =-) But yes, the problem was Quist who had 16 yrs of unpaid bills. Denise Juneau should have run instead.
869344578830299137 2017-05-29 00:07:53 UTC <Vva10967> @OGTedCruz @levitator1g All he does is attack the Democratic party and use that as a fundraiser. He's said numerous times that he is willing to work with Trump.
869343882185768961 2017-05-29 00:05:07 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko @mdeloge Too bad he chose to slander the one candidate who could make that happen. Now next POTUS is going to spend first 2 years fixing Trump's 4.
869343163265298434 2017-05-29 00:02:16 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko I thought his end game was to hijack the Dem Party, turn it into a Socialist party & make us all pander to the WWC men that voted for Trump?
869342635114233858 2017-05-29 00:00:10 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko I hope the article's right & Bernie FINALLY goes away! He cost us the 2016 election with his slanders of Hillary which he NEVER walked back!

869261088113786881 2017-05-29 18:36:08 UTC <Vva10967> @Purify_toast17 A lie that suggests that Bernie's campaign should be investigated by the FBI just like Trump's because it too was infiltrated. /3
869260749314699266 2017-05-29 18:34:47 UTC <Vva10967> @Purify_toast17 A lie that made NO sense but that was made up in May-June, AFTER Russia had gotten the DNC emails. /2
869260244354052096 2017-05-29 18:32:46 UTC <Vva10967> @Purify_toast17 The DNC leaks were not aimed at whites per se but at confirming a lie that Bernie had told his followers about the primary being rigged /1

862091488506896384 2017-05-09 23:46:42 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid But Trump can veto any statute Congress passes & there are few if any patriotic Republicans left in Congress. Maybe independent commission?
862090150532321280 2017-05-09 23:41:23 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes And that the Republicans in Congress will continue to put PARTY over country, including @SenJohnMcCain who fails to take ACTION  #treason
862089307397509120 2017-05-09 23:38:02 UTC <Vva10967> @tribelaw But since @SpeakerRyan has no integrity he won't.

862042317737394176 2017-05-09 20:31:19 UTC <Vva10967> @davidfrum Comey was happy to CONCEAL that Trump & his campaign were being investigated for collusion with Russia. He as clearly biased against HRC. 2/

862040981406875648 2017-05-09 20:26:00 UTC <Vva10967> @davidfrum Comey should have RECUSED himself from emails investigation. He was 100% biased against HRC. Worked on Whitewater & on Marc Rich prosecution

861450377438343172 2017-05-07 05:19:09 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright @Malinasaval Bernie also reinforced notion that HRC couldn't be trusted, telling his audience that after she won they would have to hold her accountable
861449743360282624 2017-05-07 05:16:38 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright @Malinasaval And the "rigged primary" lie came AFTER the DNC had been hacked so Putin probably had someone in Bernie's campaign suggest it to him.
861449120174755840 2017-05-07 05:14:09 UTC <Vva10967> @SallyAlbright @Malinasaval Bernie created false narrative that he lost because the DNC rigged the primary which was the narrative that Putin needed to weaponize emails

860959571858395136 2017-05-06 20:48:52 UTC <Vva10967> @Speaking_Plain @WillCaskey Hillary's campaign dismissed Cambridge Analytica as a threat. But they use FB likes to determine susceptibility to propaganda & it worked.
860907751832264704 2017-05-06 17:22:57 UTC <Vva10967> @Speaking_Plain @WillCaskey Difference btw 2012 and 2016 is that Mercers enabled GOP to catch up and surpass Dems in data analytics with Cambridge Analytica models.

858809306392793089 2017-04-30 22:24:29 UTC <Vva10967> @AwardsDaily Bernie also turned young people into 3rd party voters by convincing them that HRC was corrupt & his rigged election claims weaponized emails

858508193764388864 2017-04-29 02:27:58 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden It was actually worse in 2016 because @nytimes based its Clinton Foundation story on Clinton Cash book financed by Steve Bannon & Mercers.

857019497231912960 2017-04-25 23:52:25 UTC <Vva10967> @JustinTrudeau I'm rooting for Canada. So sorry for the maniac in the White House that the Republicans, 3rd party voters & Russia elected.https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/857018142282973184

856750812604846080 2017-04-24 06:04:46 UTC <Vva10967> @ChelseaClinton Chelsea, you really should use twitter's block feature w/ these aholes, haters, losers, trolls & bots. Keyboards empower them. Same on FB.

856631871068938245 2017-04-24 22:12:08 UTC <Vva10967> @MalcolmNance So do you think Trump plans to bomb North Korea on Day 100 because he hasn't accomplished anything?
856629588432236544 2017-04-24 22:03:03 UTC <Vva10967> @ericgarland Let me guess, Jared and Bannon didn't know either?   Are they throwing anyone else under the bus besides the 4 on the cover?
856569015149494273 2017-04-24 18:02:22 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost @nytimes @maddow @SopanDeb @graceloum AND that RIGHT WING BOOK turned out to have been financed by Steve Bannon and Robert & Rebekah Mercer, same machine behind Trump campaign!
856568672982355968 2017-04-24 18:01:00 UTC <Vva10967> @SopanDeb @graceloum exactly, @maddow was one of the few to call out @nytimes & @washingtonpost for basing their Clinton Foundation reporting on RIGHT WING BOOK
856564766919282688 2017-04-24 17:45:29 UTC <Vva10967> @SopanDeb @gmpadis Also @nytimes editorial board's decisions to cover Clinton Foundation based on Clinton Cash book financed by Bannon & the Mercers was AWFUL
856563976402030592 2017-04-24 17:42:20 UTC <Vva10967> @SopanDeb @Lollardfish NYT also owes a mea culpa 4 basing its reporting of Clinton Foundation on the Clinton Cash book which was financed by Bannon & the Mercers.
856562611650953216 2017-04-24 17:36:55 UTC <Vva10967> @owillis @erinscafe @mudshark23 And I've been in Western European countries on Sundays.  OMG, even supermarkets are closed!

856559361480683524 2017-04-24 17:24:00 UTC <Vva10967> @owillis @erinscafe @mudshark23 oh I agree it would help compared to what we have now of voting on a Tuesday. But European Sundays are truly "nothing-else-going-on" days.
856382509621407745 2017-04-23 05:41:15 UTC <Vva10967> @owillis @erinscafe Also keep in mind that EVERYTHING is closed on Sundays in France (and many other EU countries)

856367039556063232 2017-04-23 04:39:47 UTC <Vva10967> @MarkWarner @SenatorBurr This is unacceptable, what happened to the REAL & SERIOUS investigation you promised?http://thebea.st/2p7mWPY
856315529937793024 2017-04-23 01:15:06 UTC <Vva10967> @FEC @gabenascar @BettieRose100 @geokaren @hyphenrr His campaign didn't file a final FEC report (found loophole) so not clear if he refunded the excess contributions bc FEC was dysfuntional 2.
856314489637150721 2017-04-23 01:10:58 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer @TomPerez @KaraCalavera @morganarae Elizabeth Warren is a regular Dem with a clear and morally compelling message who doesn't trash the party. And she's actually a member.
856314092973436928 2017-04-23 01:09:23 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer @TomPerez @morganarae If I wanted a party led by someone who says Dems are the problem, civil rights don't matter & only economic rights do, I would join the GOP!
856313270327750656 2017-04-23 01:06:07 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer @TomPerez @morganarae Seeing the DNC fundraising drop should do the trick & force them to reorient. Money talks and fundraising IS the DNC's main function.
856310761181904896 2017-04-23 00:56:09 UTC <Vva10967> @ABCPolitics and the other 39% are Trump's loyal base? 
856309184433991680 2017-04-23 00:49:53 UTC <Vva10967> @RVAwonk @neeratanden @smenor 78,000 is a tiny minority of 136 Million voters. The BernieBros made Trump POTUS. Sorry to offend your white male sensitivities. Not really

856299431485988864 2017-04-23 00:11:08 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports oh, so we're going to be watching the @GOP commit suicide this week?

856274040591441920 2017-04-23 22:30:14 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports Lol does he watch Maddow?
856227081310654467 2017-04-23 19:23:38 UTC <Vva10967> @danpfeiffer Let's hope the French are smarter than the US and choose correctly in May.
856223519440502784 2017-04-23 19:09:29 UTC <Vva10967> @RVAwonk @neeratanden @smenor However it's the truth. You had BernieBros in your camp. They screwed the USA. Only took 78,000 across 3 states. Now Trump will screw them.
856222714297798657 2017-04-23 19:06:17 UTC <Vva10967> @tribelaw Probably not. Palmer isn't reliable, he reads what is in the newspapers and sensationalizes it.
856172631137144832 2017-04-23 15:47:16 UTC <Vva10967> @TomPerez @SenSchumer @keithellison Looks like the Outreach Chair's message is getting through!  Congrats! @NancyPelosihttps://twitter.com/KaraCalavera/status/856147448041017345

856168448463953920 2017-04-23 15:30:39 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisMurphyCT Let him show the world that Republicans are inept at governing. #IneptGOP If @GOP wants the wall, THEY have to vote for it, not Dems.

856024225416699905 2017-04-22 05:57:34 UTC <Vva10967> @CNNPolitics @JacquiUpNorth44 That's the one with all the regressive losers who got Trump elected: Nina Turner, Susan Sarandon, Michael Moore, Van Jones, etc.
856021924706648064 2017-04-22 05:48:25 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @michaeldweiss @macmcd @saintmaggie The DNC is a fundraising and candidate recruiting entity and if it pisses off the real base it will be cash strapped.

855955782273290240 2017-04-22 01:25:36 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 they also started trashing HRC in April 2015 based on Clinton Cash, the book that Steve Bannon & the Mercers financed =Right wing propaganda
855954970167971840 2017-04-22 01:22:22 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 you would think she had killed someone the way they were covering the letter! and yet the one under FBI investigation was Trump! #treason
855954695688380416 2017-04-22 01:21:16 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 the media went 24/7 nonstop covering the Comey letter from the moment it came out while Florida and NC were still having early voting. 1/
855953826158923777 2017-04-22 01:17:49 UTC <Vva10967> @bitchyologist especially when THEY, the MSM, HELPED bigly with their sick obsession with her emails and their TOTAL MISS of RussiaGate!
855952625216499712 2017-04-22 01:13:03 UTC <Vva10967> @KaraCalavera @neeratanden maybe you should write a CAP piece explaining to Sanders crowd why healthcare is complicated, they seem to be in same boat as Trump 
855951705841774592 2017-04-22 01:09:24 UTC <Vva10967> @marceelias Didn't principled Republicans go extinct when they nominated Trump in July 2016? principled Republicans is now an oxymoron!

855919175272988672 2017-04-22 23:00:08 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem He's now the NYT WH Press Correspondent & is the one who laughed when Spicer said that now the unemployment numbers were real.
855918708434317313 2017-04-22 22:58:16 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem and Hillary gave him an interview for his podcast (Politico), as did Robby Mook and Jen Palmieri.

855912527468929024 2017-04-22 22:33:43 UTC <Vva10967> @GlennThrush and yet, NYT & other MSM managed to convince the voters that she was untrustworthy & drove her approval ratings from 69% to less than 50%!
855911466616188930 2017-04-22 22:29:30 UTC <Vva10967> @AristotleJones @InxsyS @sw6blues11 Other countries aren't like us. We've developed a complex healthcare matrix that cannot be just wiped out. Pols who say otherwise are lying.

855816748909678593 2017-04-22 16:13:07 UTC <Vva10967> And the country back then WAS very much center right. Part of why HillaryCare failed to even get a vote & why GOP had WH for 1980-1992  2/
855816297317355520 2017-04-22 16:11:20 UTC <Vva10967> She was removed from policy-making after HillaryCare failed and the Dems lost the 1994 midterms. Then Clinton Admin moved center right. 1/
855815358317547522 2017-04-22 16:07:36 UTC <Vva10967> Which is essentially what ALL Republicans in Congress believe. https://twitter.com/InxsyS/status/855803111356735490

850487072242761728 2017-04-07 23:14:53 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes Obama resisted it because he, like Trump, had no authority from Congress to strike Syria. He's violating US Constitution. FOCUS!!!

849848166442831873 2017-04-05 04:56:06 UTC <Vva10967> @RepCummings @SopanDeb @obbiecole We should worry that Trump hears voices.... it's a sign he suffers from schizophrenia.
849679232410300416 2017-04-05 17:44:49 UTC <Vva10967> @Newsweek that didn't stop them when they went after her for Benghazi. Or when they went after HRC for Benghazi. Media has let them get away with lies

849505502128214017 2017-04-04 06:14:29 UTC <Vva10967> @AnitaFinlay @LouiseMensch Another reason why Putin feared Hillary.

849121341538226176 2017-04-03 04:47:58 UTC <Vva10967> FBI has not said that they did any forensic examination of voting or tallying machines to back their no tamper claimhttps://medium.com/@keeltyc/russians-didnt-hack-voting-machines-is-fake-news-59846acc286c

849109902538801152 2017-04-03 04:02:31 UTC <Vva10967> @Newsweek @SenWarren Bernie will alienate your followers too.  And he'll attack you if you take his spotlight like he did with HRC. #HeIsNotADemocrat
849109443858092032 2017-04-03 04:00:41 UTC <Vva10967> @Newsweek Bet @SenSanders will find out that his campaign was as compromised as Trump's when the FBI's investigation is concluded.
849101246128640009 2017-04-03 03:28:07 UTC <Vva10967> @StevenTDennis does @kwelkernbc not realize that Trump has no clue what is in either the ACA or in Trumpcare and has no clue how US healthcare works?

848915425136185345 2017-04-03 15:09:44 UTC <Vva10967> @ezlusztig That's too complicated for a one-time event. After Trump is removed, Pence should name HRC as VP and once she's confirmed, step down.

847135663023669248 2017-03-29 17:17:35 UTC <Vva10967> @bitchyologist @CindyDPishere they want to hear slogans from old men yelling & claiming that it's easy & not complicated.
847134467294670849 2017-03-29 17:12:50 UTC <Vva10967> @cryanhyde I think that an independent commission WOULD ask the questions & not be afraid of the answers. Even our side seems to be afraid.
847130965654810624 2017-03-29 16:58:55 UTC <Vva10967> @cryanhyde yes until Comey confirms that they've looked at the machines & done forensic examinations I don't see how he can say no tampering

846771281634709504 2017-03-28 17:09:40 UTC <Vva10967> @yashar that's because they run with his nonsense, instead of calling it out as nonsense and lies from getgo, eg.Obama wiredtapped me tweets

846230817416339456 2017-03-26 05:22:03 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT @nytimes see, she tried to tell us. Neither the audience nor the media believed her. And she didn't get to Trump-Putin collusion.https://twitter.com/Casey_Clemmons/status/844732315653869572
846227193768411138 2017-03-26 05:07:39 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @JBPNW9 @LaPajamas Yes Tulsi Gabbard was Vice-Chair of the DNC & quit to endorse Bernie on Feb 28 2016. Devine worked w Manafort
846226549493977090 2017-03-26 05:05:06 UTC <Vva10967> The Steele Dossier claims that Russia had "agents/facilitators within the Democratic Party structure itself". @RepSwalwell @RepAdamSchiffhttps://twitter.com/JoyAnnReid/status/846119616078319618
846219881985036288 2017-03-26 04:38:36 UTC <Vva10967> @impeach_d_trump I think she has great integrity but I am troubled by the fact that she COULD have stopped Comey's Oct 28 letter & didn't.
846071247930884098 2017-03-26 18:47:59 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @cryanhyde no one has asked Comey that. And it would have been done by the FBI not the NSA or CIA.
846069342261460993 2017-03-26 18:40:25 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou however no one has asked FBI director if machines were forensically examined to reach that conclusion. Doesn't seem they were.
846068876991500288 2017-03-26 18:38:34 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou I think that if FBI looks, they will also find that Jill Stein's and Sanders' campaign colluded too.
846068138311602181 2017-03-26 18:35:38 UTC <Vva10967> @stphil Unlike Trump, both Sanders and Devine were smart, could count elected delegates & understood presidential primary system. Yet LIED.
846067679995854850 2017-03-26 18:33:48 UTC <Vva10967> @stphil The polarization was done by Sanders. He and Devine KNEW race was over in March, definitely in April but chose to LIE to followers.
846067147570921472 2017-03-26 18:31:41 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN @MSNBC @maddow @JoyAnnReid @Lawrence @jaketapper @msnbc @cnn can you follow up on this story on your shows? Also @nytimes @washingtonposthttps://twitter.com/mattmfm/status/845986821888753664
846066694900629509 2017-03-26 18:29:53 UTC <Vva10967> @stphil @Teknogrot @fawfulfan However Pence was chosen by Manafort. Trump wanted Chris Christie. So he must have some ties to RussiaGate.
846065451356557312 2017-03-26 18:24:57 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan @stphil & Devine worked for Manafort in Ukraine. Both need to be called to testify under oath & their bank accounts investigated.
846064902825545728 2017-03-26 18:22:46 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan @stphil Sanders campaign needs to be investigated too. Their attacks on HRC & DNC coincide w Manafort arrival in Trump campaign.
846064006490140673 2017-03-26 18:19:12 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan @stphil whose malfeasance? Sanders campaign fabricated its rigged lies AFTER DNC had been hacked & Russia knew what was in emails
846063055314325508 2017-03-26 18:15:26 UTC <Vva10967> @LouiseMensch what does it mean in UK to "offer the brokerage of up to a 19% stake in Rosneft"? is it an offer for 19% or 4 a brokerage fee?https://twitter.com/Vva10967/status/825043652112166912

846022854764302336 2017-03-26 15:35:41 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT Look at Salon's coverage:http://www.salon.com/2016/07/25/shades_of_the_cold_war_how_the_dnc_fabricated_a_russian_hacker_conspiracy_to_deflect_blame_for_its_email_scandal/
846017202243485696 2017-03-26 15:13:13 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT maybe at the time the Russian interference felt 2 much like a badly written spy novel so media ignored it? Same w Steele dossier
846016597378711552 2017-03-26 15:10:49 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT the media was too busy reporting on the content of the hacked DNC emails & ignored all reports about their source i.e. Russia. 2/
846016362061418496 2017-03-26 15:09:53 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT it was the media's failure. The information was out there. Look at reports of DNC hack from day 1 of Dem convention. 1/
846014888644415490 2017-03-26 15:04:02 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill @kathleenn & Joe had the same chance of being attacked by Russia in the general election bc he like HRC is pro-NATO & pro-sanctions
846014451996332033 2017-03-26 15:02:18 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill @kathleenn yes, he was on the ballot in 2008 along with Obama & Hillary and lost badly. He would have lost to Hillary in 2016.

845874616686039040 2017-03-25 05:46:38 UTC <Vva10967> @AndreaChalupa but don't we then risk getting Trey Gowdy as chair?

845868945991254016 2017-03-25 05:24:06 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill lately every Democratic alpha male wants to throw Hillary under the bus.

845867838141288448 2017-03-25 05:19:42 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill Biden was on the ballot in 2008 & lost badly to both Obama & Hillary. And like Hillary, he'd not have been able 2 anticipate Putin.
845849568403247104 2017-03-25 04:07:06 UTC <Vva10967> Jill Stein needs to be investigated too @RepSwalwell @RepAdamSchiffhttps://twitter.com/Khanoisseur/status/821286190733066241

845764281538924544 2017-03-25 22:28:12 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @janeinak Bernie had choice of campaigning FOR Hillary or campaigning AGAINST Trump. He chose #2. And never took back his lies.
845749895755632640 2017-03-25 21:31:03 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou they need to be investigated too. Podesta got hacked in mid March, DNC in summer of 2015 & hackers stayed in system til July 2016
845749352547143685 2017-03-25 21:28:53 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou they also created the "election is rigged" narrative which IS what weaponized the DNC emails & did so in April 2016, AFTER hacks.

845736369905381377 2017-03-25 20:37:18 UTC <Vva10967> @MilitaryTimes @vanambb Trump has even discontinued Joining Forces, the Obama program that helped vets get jobs in private sector. /4
845735957282373637 2017-03-25 20:35:39 UTC <Vva10967> @MilitaryTimes @vanambb @YyvetteW and they are affecting services on military bases as well as job opportunities for vets in fed govt.
845735525445242882 2017-03-25 20:33:56 UTC <Vva10967> @MilitaryTimes @vanambb @YyvetteW agreed but I think Dems in the Senate can stop the VA privatization. Not so with the hiring freezes.
845734877681127424 2017-03-25 20:31:22 UTC <Vva10967> @MilitaryTimes @vanambb vets who voted for Trump are reaping what they sowed. Biggest con perpetrated in US history. AND a Russian mole too.

845508942570688512 2017-03-24 05:33:35 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes apparently not. The media thought emails were more important than being competent and brilliant.

843260154653163520 2017-03-18 00:37:42 UTC <Vva10967> @redsteeze that is true of trade, tariffs, the trade deficit which he seems to confuse with the budget deficit, healthcare, nukes, etc. etc.

842858224197996548 2017-03-17 22:00:34 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @Ssimms777 "Cattell, Rybolovlevs spokesman, used to write for Breitbart. He said he never met Mercer." BUT did he meet Bannon??

842856644128194560 2017-03-17 21:54:18 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid question is, does Kellyanne Conway share Mercer's and Bannon's views on race and white identity?
842856204871393281 2017-03-17 21:52:33 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Also named Bannon 2 Board of Cambridge Analytica so Bannon is his guy. IF Mercer not associated w Putin then Trump has 2 masters
842855702536306688 2017-03-17 21:50:33 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Mercer has been associated w Bannon for a LONG time so not surprising. He financed Breitbart & Clinton Cash book & movie.

842236903491567617 2017-03-15 04:51:40 UTC <Vva10967> @mckaycoppins problem is that Trump gets his "news" and alternative facts from Faux, Infowars and Breitbart.

838544341618524160 2017-03-05 00:18:45 UTC <Vva10967> @boofontheloose @_Ms_J however Trump would fear Comey will simply spill the beans on him "to get even" if he fires him.

838529246968561665 2017-03-05 23:18:46 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid I don't think that's what Comey is saying, just that Obama didn't order the tapping of Trump's phones as Trump claims.
838487119052046338 2017-03-05 20:31:22 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem oh it would have been Comey. I don't think Comey is letting too many people know status of his investigation.
838486162889191424 2017-03-05 20:27:34 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper shouldn't most reporters be looking into his mental insanity instead? 
838484885312524288 2017-03-05 20:22:29 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem in Senate investigation is with Intelligence Committee & Sessions wasn't a part of it & would look odd for him to ask status.
838484608945618944 2017-03-05 20:21:23 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem but investigation is at the FBI level, with Comey, who but for the recusal would have been obligated to update him on status
838483659569102848 2017-03-05 20:17:37 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem who would give him a status report at the FBI or DOJ? They all know he has recused himself from investigation.
838483290407456770 2017-03-05 20:16:09 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem So Comey probably leaked meetings with Russian ambassador, to force Sessions to recuse himself.
838483074258251776 2017-03-05 20:15:17 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem he can't. After recusal, he can't ask questions about investigation & Comey doesn't have to give him status reports either.

837903428382777344 2017-03-03 05:51:59 UTC <Vva10967> @jonlovett @mattyglesias @JoyceCarolOates @rushmc @indiblue4 Exactly. Trump voters couldn't do it by themselves. They needed helpful idiots.
837365794845691904 2017-03-02 18:15:37 UTC <Vva10967> Trump LIED and used the fallen Navy Seal's widow as a prop for his speech.https://twitter.com/NBCNightlyNews/status/837083908957167616
837365282800795649 2017-03-02 18:13:35 UTC <Vva10967> @lrozen no, it just suggests that unlike with HRC's email investigation, he's following DOJ rules applicable to counterintel investigations
837364695044620290 2017-03-02 18:11:15 UTC <Vva10967> @loosebricks @sherean @jdh you do realize that @davidfrum is a Republican, right? he doesn't want GOP to lose control of House &/or Senate.
837358665149648896 2017-03-02 17:47:17 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon after all the conflicts the Senate Republicans have overlooked in Trump's nominees, it's hard to believe they have any ethics.
837204296483627013 2017-03-01 07:33:53 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon I think he should run against Mitch in 2020. He can unseat him. And after stealing SCOTUS seat Mitch has to go.
837052608678408192 2017-03-01 21:31:08 UTC <Vva10967> @jasoninthehouse @RepCummings The American people deserve to know the truth. Did Trump LIE last night about Yemen? http://nbcnews.to/2lNFDbk
837038734105325568 2017-03-01 20:36:00 UTC <Vva10967> @VanJones68 you need to focus man: substance. You keep trying so hard to find good in Trump. There ain't any.https://twitter.com/yottapoint/status/836827684919525377
837004837774639109 2017-03-01 18:21:18 UTC <Vva10967> @JuddLegum your definition of "journalist" is very kind to CNN. 
836826772784168960 2017-02-28 06:33:44 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Dems should run him against Mitch in 2020.
836826190899970048 2017-02-28 06:31:26 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah Van Jones is a Bernie guy.
836823292501757953 2017-02-28 06:19:55 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisMurphyCT he is LYING about the Intel they got. He needs to be exposed for what he did.
836822448737759232 2017-02-28 06:16:33 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid & that Trump is LYING about the Intel they got & that he didn't bother to watch the raid as it happened because he was tweeting
836722985155297280 2017-02-28 23:41:19 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN DeVos and Trump have now proven that money can't cure stupid!

836673658810744833 2017-02-28 20:25:19 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias she is soooo unpopular that she keeps getting standing ovations everywhere she goes.

836671943134887937 2017-02-28 20:18:30 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias and yet if she were to say on FB tomorrow Sign Up with my new Org she'd get at least 5 million people to sign up on Day ONE.
836473622537596933 2017-02-27 07:10:27 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 @KCMFA lol I don't think Bernie wants to give up his cushy Senate seat & salary to go head a Revolution with 47k followers 
836462378682363905 2017-02-27 06:25:46 UTC <Vva10967> @Canada4Bernie @ActualFlatticus @DavidMizner @TheTylt GWB was stupid but not evil. Trump is evil & lacks empathy. Thinks about using nukes.
836461655080984577 2017-02-27 06:22:53 UTC <Vva10967> @kitkat9301 he certainly didn't change his GOP registration when GWB was POTUS. Republicans hate HRC....until they meet her.
836459374675701761 2017-02-27 06:13:50 UTC <Vva10967> @JessikaJayne actually @ProgBlacksmith is a raving BernieBro. The kind that Cambridge Analytica targeted to vote 3rd party & elect Trump.
836353117008642048 2017-02-27 23:11:36 UTC <Vva10967> I know, I wish @HillaryClinton were POTUS but we're stuck with you thanks to Bernie's Cult voting 3rd party & electing you accidentally. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/498008486551506945
836347274007572480 2017-02-27 22:48:23 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro It's YOUR Republican upbringing that makes you see her as flawed. Bet you've hated her your whole life & have never met her.
836346896109154305 2017-02-27 22:46:53 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro Clinton Foundation, saves MILLIONS of LIVES, media says "looks bad" Trump Foundation, under investigation 4 self-dealing. That's ok.
836346188173611008 2017-02-27 22:44:04 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro Benghazi, 4 Americans get killed,OMG, OMG HRC has blood on her hands!!! HUNDREDS got killed under Reagan, Bush Sr., and W. That's ok
836345836896456705 2017-02-27 22:42:40 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro right now Trump still uses a freaking unsecured Android phone and that's ok. If it were HRC, she'd be "extremely careless".
836345578112024576 2017-02-27 22:41:39 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro HRC is "flawed" only because media treats EVERYTHING she does differently. e.g. her emails. W deleted MILLIONS & no one complained
836344167529840642 2017-02-27 22:36:02 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro you don't think that the country deserved to have the most qualified candidate to ever run for that office as POTUS?
836340126997442561 2017-02-27 22:19:59 UTC <Vva10967> Next statement will be: Nobody knew that being POTUS could be so complicated. https://twitter.com/DavidCornDC/status/836238458444115973
836339764173373440 2017-02-27 22:18:32 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou and he's NOT a Democrat.
836338702775435265 2017-02-27 22:14:19 UTC <Vva10967> @leahmcelrath and where exactly does Robert Mercer fit in? He has been enabling Banner for YEARS yet media focuses only on Banner.
836334329542365184 2017-02-27 21:56:57 UTC <Vva10967> @LouiseMensch he certainly has practice.
836328491482288129 2017-02-27 21:33:45 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 He's not a BernieBro, but a NeverTrump Republican. Changed registration to Indep when Trump got nominated but Repub at heart.
836295208262381571 2017-02-27 19:21:29 UTC <Vva10967> Because Republicans in Congress are covering up for Trump and don't want to learn the truth. #RussiaGate #Treason #TreasonousTrumphttps://twitter.com/ananavarro/status/836206887918002177

836027972264022017 2017-02-26 01:39:35 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou Trump's Party wants to perpetuate @BernieSanders's fantasy as to why he lost because that elected Trump. Cult eats it with gusto.
835930610539589633 2017-02-26 19:12:43 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @keithellison needs to have a conversation with @BernieSanders who is helping Trump now just like he helped him in defeating HRC.
835930146775449601 2017-02-26 19:10:52 UTC <Vva10967> @MichaelLaRosaDC the one he originally stole from @HillaryClinton? lol.

835924691294511104 2017-02-26 18:49:11 UTC <Vva10967> @bannerite his theory is too simplistic. Trump used Mercer's Cambridge Analytica which determined from FB likes who's gullible to fake ads.
835923070787420162 2017-02-26 18:42:45 UTC <Vva10967> @MattBruenig @ahumorlessfem @kaydeelex Seriously. How many voters can even tell you WHO was the DNC Chair from 2001 to 2016? #BernieMyths
835921055420133376 2017-02-26 18:34:44 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper PLEASE stop giving @BernieSanders a mike? He's irrelevant & is Trump's best weapon to destroy Dem party. HE got Trump elected.

835894861706452992 2017-02-26 16:50:39 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN @MSNBC @maddow @Lawrence @amjoyshow @jaketapper @chucktodd @hardball seems to me Trump is confusing Deficit with National Debt?https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/835479283699224576
835894411284348928 2017-02-26 16:48:52 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon He's quoting Herman Cain appearance on Faux & Friends. And I think he's confusing deficit with national debt.
835894100717076480 2017-02-26 16:47:38 UTC <Vva10967> @amyklobuchar if you read in between the lines, WaPo is suggesting that CIA Director Pompeo complied with Trump's orders to downplay story.
835892012436049920 2017-02-26 16:39:20 UTC <Vva10967> @jasoninthehouse @RepCummings So, when can we expect the botched Yemeni raid hearings to start?http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article135064074.html

835888588952858625 2017-02-26 16:25:44 UTC <Vva10967> From September 2016.  MSM largely ignored the story.https://twitter.com/ericgeller/status/779386469437808640

835716323619532800 2017-02-25 05:01:13 UTC <Vva10967> Trump got his "I reduced the National Debt" nonsense from Herman Cain who said it on Faux & Friends @maddow @amjoyshow @jaketapper @Lawrencehttps://twitter.com/WillOremus/status/835498773623238657
835715412255977472 2017-02-25 04:57:35 UTC <Vva10967> @TheRickWilson is Trump confusing the deficit with the national debt?

835710838921129984 2017-02-25 04:39:25 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden because it was their pay for trashing Hillary and getting Trump elected?
835710363027009536 2017-02-25 04:37:31 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Midwesterners would also get to experience what is like working without a minimum wage since it doesn't apply to farm workers
835707899552870400 2017-02-25 04:27:44 UTC <Vva10967> @TomPerez_DNC @peterdaou @mexicanfoodfrea agree that DNC should be more hands-off. That way LOSERS can't blame their loss on DNC.
835707519553122307 2017-02-25 04:26:14 UTC <Vva10967> @TomPerez_DNC @peterdaou @mexicanfoodfrea Obviously the ACA wasn't explained well.  Seems people love it now that they can lose it.
835707162735349761 2017-02-25 04:24:48 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @TomPerez_DNC @peterdaou @mexicanfoodfrea Nop, the Dem primary was OVER after NY. @SenSanders LIED to his followers.
835663179808182273 2017-02-25 01:30:02 UTC <Vva10967> @Shakestweetz no, that'd be doing the work without the title. Better if @AlecBaldwin attends in Trump's place & turns it into full SNL.
835662309615861760 2017-02-25 01:26:35 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 it doesn't sound like him, it's missing the "losers, haters and enemies" references that he loves so much.
835661823290507264 2017-02-25 01:24:39 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou even more absurd, they believe his claim that the DNC rigs the primary for its chosen candidate. 
835660778007117824 2017-02-25 01:20:29 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro @damon_musha they were both on the ballot in 2008. Not even close.

835595663974989826 2017-02-25 21:01:45 UTC <Vva10967> @gdebenedetti Keith didn't falsely accuse Tom of having rigged the election or of being corrupt nor did he refuse to accept his loss.
835594103349981184 2017-02-25 20:55:33 UTC <Vva10967> @SarahLerner Josh Barro is a NeverTrump Republican so like all Republicans hates Hillary.
835592162863644674 2017-02-25 20:47:50 UTC <Vva10967> @sahilkapur he speaks for the Democratic Party's base. That's how we feel.

835589668779470848 2017-02-25 20:37:56 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro Biden would have lost the primary to Hillary.  We, the Dem primary voters, LOVED HER. Still do.
835589121087270912 2017-02-25 20:35:45 UTC <Vva10967> @imillhiser exactly but the Bernie Cult believes it's the person who rigs the primary & puts in place the candidate of his choice. 
835587325455450117 2017-02-25 20:28:37 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost both Tom Perez and Keith Ellison are liberals. What you meant to say is "in blow to Sanders' hard core followers".

835586340012056577 2017-02-25 20:24:42 UTC <Vva10967> @markos also the vote in Delaware today for control of that State's Senate matters more than the DNC chair vote!
835584807635681281 2017-02-25 20:18:37 UTC <Vva10967> @donnabrazile will it be made available to the public and media on the DNC website?
835584021350404096 2017-02-25 20:15:29 UTC <Vva10967> @aravosis Hillary lost by less than 78K votes & got 2.86MM more votes than Trump. Bernie Cult is small but very loud. Can be overcomed
835582718826196998 2017-02-25 20:10:19 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @MoElleithee local press was reporting in 2009-14 on efforts by FWs & AFP. Nat Press wasn't so Dems ignored it. Esp. in MI & WI 2
835581868082933761 2017-02-25 20:06:56 UTC <Vva10967> @MoElleithee @peterdaou actually Dems understimated & still do what Freedom Works & AFP did.  That accounts for the 1000 lost state seats. 1
835580328752345088 2017-02-25 20:00:49 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @MoElleithee the RNC didn't rebuild the GOP infrastructure. Freedom Works & AFP did. They supported Tea Party to electoral wins.
835579247502716930 2017-02-25 19:56:31 UTC <Vva10967> @DNC @KaraCalavera @s1_se_puede you can't work with petulant children. They'll be back when they grow up & their "revolution" fades.
835578839656968192 2017-02-25 19:54:54 UTC <Vva10967> @amyzworldamy that's what Trump and his followers say when they make up numbers and facts.,,,OurRevolution barely has 47K followers.
835578183164522498 2017-02-25 19:52:17 UTC <Vva10967> @gdebenedetti curious, how do you get a half vote?
835577546905366529 2017-02-25 19:49:46 UTC <Vva10967> @TagAmericaBlue @ChrisJZullo Bernie's Cult cares because he told them that DNC & DWS made Hillary the candidate. Not true. Voters did.
835577265635409921 2017-02-25 19:48:39 UTC <Vva10967> @TagAmericaBlue @ChrisJZullo Whole thing is silly. No one has ever cared who the heck is DNC Chair, eg. didn't care when Tim Kaine was Chair
835576731998224384 2017-02-25 19:46:31 UTC <Vva10967> @TagAmericaBlue @ChrisJZullo @westernUS2016 DNC's main function is to fundraise, recruit candidates & support local Dem parties. Not policy.
835576275909636103 2017-02-25 19:44:43 UTC <Vva10967> @amyzworldamy LOL where are you getting your numbers? InfoWars??? 
835574411814137858 2017-02-25 19:37:18 UTC <Vva10967> Have fun!  
835573770517622786 2017-02-25 19:34:45 UTC <Vva10967> @Noneya_Mindyers they are loud but not large in numbers.  Look at their OurRevolution handle, barely has 47K followers in 8 months.
835570477670285320 2017-02-25 19:21:40 UTC <Vva10967> @VABVOX do you know if there is a list of who actually votes? i.e. who the 442 are? I can't imagine that Nina & Weaver & Michael Moore vote?
835569298387038208 2017-02-25 19:16:59 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden lol, next thing you know @itomkowiak is going to say that Joe Manchin is a lefty liberal!
835568933038075904 2017-02-25 19:15:32 UTC <Vva10967> the people Sandaron represents lost Democrats the 2000 election and the 2016 one. Time for her to go join Jill for good.
835562855697170432 2017-02-25 18:51:23 UTC <Vva10967> @KaraCalavera @DNC let Berners walk away.  They aren't the Dem party & their #s R actually small. Their "revolution" will fade like Occupy.
835562267425005568 2017-02-25 18:49:03 UTC <Vva10967> @MichaelLaRosaDC Bernie would fade if @MSNBC stops portraying him like he's the savior of the Dem Party. He isn't. You built him like Trump.
835560005776572419 2017-02-25 18:40:03 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou Bernie's so called "Revolution" will fade.  Like Occupy. Even OFA has faded. Hillary endures and persists. #StillWithHer
835557164982878213 2017-02-25 18:28:46 UTC <Vva10967> @JordanUhl @jasoninthehouse of all people uses one, gmail.  Apparently that's ok. Even lists it on his gov business card.

835350752797343744 2017-02-24 04:48:34 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid BTW, @OurRevolution has barely 47K followers & has been around since July.  Loud but not big. Bet it dissipates like Occupy.
835349337018359809 2017-02-24 04:42:56 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid what Dems need now is their own Freedom Works which is what trained & supported the Tea Party activists to electoral success. /4
835348565866262528 2017-02-24 04:39:52 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid if Keith wins & follows purist approach, I'm not sure how DNC will fund Keith's initiatives w/ only grass-root donations /3
835347950977040384 2017-02-24 04:37:26 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid its job is organize, fundraise & recruit candidates, not make policy. If Perez wins, will also include defending voting rights.2
835347512605229058 2017-02-24 04:35:41 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid except that the DNC is NOT the all-powerful, king-making entity that Bernie made it out to be.  NO ONE cares what DNC thinks. 1/
835347163005796352 2017-02-24 04:34:18 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid And this is part 2, on Jefferson Sessions and how HE fits into the puzzle:https://patribotics.wordpress.com/2017/02/07/jeff-sessions-attorney-general-suspect/
835347010689564672 2017-02-24 04:33:42 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Her other 2 puzzles are good too.  This is part 1.https://patribotics.wordpress.com/2017/01/17/dear-mr-putin-lets-play-chess-louise-mensch-trump-russia/

835277379446648832 2017-02-24 23:57:00 UTC <Vva10967> @TomPerez @rubycramer @sandearl exactly and whoever loses will work with the other. That is what SHOULD have happened on Nov 8.
835276469718892545 2017-02-24 23:53:23 UTC <Vva10967> @rubycramer frankly I am tired of Bernie's Cult and Weaver and Michael Moore being so dramatic about this. @TomPerez is a great organizer.
835275544547704833 2017-02-24 23:49:43 UTC <Vva10967> @rubycramer @OurRevolution @TomPerez regardless of who wins DNC is not the king-making all powerful institution Bernie made it out to be.
835274385472761856 2017-02-24 23:45:06 UTC <Vva10967> @KaraCalavera NY adores Hillary too. She gets standing ovations everywhere she goes now. Trump would get boo'd in NY.
835207384150781952 2017-02-24 19:18:52 UTC <Vva10967> @realDonaldTrump may want to read up on the Fall of Richard Nixon... https://twitter.com/tackettdc/status/835205982565371904

835205900596047872 2017-02-24 19:12:58 UTC <Vva10967> I sure hope so.  Only Trump can destroy the GOP at the national level, just like Gov Pete Wilson did in CA implementing Prop 187.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/835204417817362432
835205083893743618 2017-02-24 19:09:44 UTC <Vva10967> @PaulBegala @CNN should continue probing into Trump's Russian ties and bring him down.  Other REPUTABLE news outlets should too.

835029431731249152 2017-02-23 07:31:45 UTC <Vva10967> @MrDane1982 the so called progressive left. They gave us Trump with their third party votes.  True progressives would have voted for HRC.
835024588316737536 2017-02-23 07:12:30 UTC <Vva10967> @CarolMerritt @MrDane1982 @MacMargi @LJYanney but in the end the DNC doesn't determine policy except in Bernie's & Cult's mind.
835023901797322752 2017-02-23 07:09:46 UTC <Vva10967> @HuffPostPol @MrDane1982 Ellison however IS a Democrat and will back Perez if Perez wins.
835019641361686528 2017-02-23 06:52:51 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes nah. He IS Putin's Puppet. It's just a matter of when it all comes out.  And what WE THE PEOPLE do about it. #TreasonousTrump
835018756980158465 2017-02-23 06:49:20 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou you forgot Putin and Robert Mercer. Mercer put Bannon & Kellyanne in charge of Trump's campaign when Cruz' sank.
834902001737674753 2017-02-23 23:05:23 UTC <Vva10967> The SNL jokes now write themselves, as they did when Palin was @SenJohnMcCain's VP running mate.https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/834862661007507456

834900276217798661 2017-02-23 22:58:32 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper maybe they are troubled by having to falsify data to please the so-called President?
834899287045734400 2017-02-23 22:54:36 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC and the only reason Trump won is that the Bernie Cult decided that voting third party to punish HRC was more important.
834898133536636932 2017-02-23 22:50:01 UTC <Vva10967> @Evan_McMullin Nunes was part of Trump's transition team, party over country. They need to be voted out in 2018.
834897730900217857 2017-02-23 22:48:25 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews your headline is misleading, it should say "Attorney General Jeff Sessions indicates feds will again be using private prisons"
834853217724923904 2017-02-23 19:51:32 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid The Resistance must stand up for Warren.  We let the Right (and the media!) trash Hillary while GOP stood by indefensible Trump.
834852510099701760 2017-02-23 19:48:43 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid they always pick a powerful woman, Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton, and now Elizabeth Warren.
834851223387922432 2017-02-23 19:43:37 UTC <Vva10967> Change would require Arizona voter approval because it changes the State Constitution. It's a GOP power grab & must be rejected by voters.https://twitter.com/VotingMatters/status/834838240138035200

834656130408259585 2017-02-22 06:48:23 UTC <Vva10967> @StillLes4Hill or they will find out that the DNC has no power and that Bernie lied to them, lol.

833821557600436227 2017-02-20 23:32:05 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou but if Russia had planted someone in Bernie's campaign to attack HRC & DNC & Dem Party & say election was "rigged" = dispositive

817971018388111360 2017-01-07 05:47:42 UTC <Vva10967> @Khanoisseur @drloisweiner No, it was easy for Republicans because PRIOR to Nov 2013 ANY nominee could be filibustered. Dems changed rule.

817621666071281664 2017-01-06 06:39:30 UTC <Vva10967> @LorettaLynch @SallyQYates from a former US Solicitor General- it's the least you could do for our country before leaving office.#RogueComeyhttps://twitter.com/walterdellinger/status/817505945295130624
817620582133022726 2017-01-06 06:35:12 UTC <Vva10967> But it won't go anywhere because @SpeakerRyan puts PARTY over Country and will block it.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/817461753105838081
817620194285780993 2017-01-06 06:33:39 UTC <Vva10967> did FBI go rogue again and kept this out of the report on purpose?https://twitter.com/DavidCornDC/status/817512696442658816
817620000554950656 2017-01-06 06:32:53 UTC <Vva10967> @RepAdamSchiff this- why didn't IC include this in its report? did FBI not look into it? or is FBI going rogue again?https://twitter.com/DavidCornDC/status/817512696442658816
817615973129814016 2017-01-06 06:16:53 UTC <Vva10967> @RepAdamSchiff this too, why didn't IC report look into it? Seems IC skipped the obvious, the collusion between Kremlin & Trump's campaign.https://twitter.com/sarahkendzior/status/817538387053858821
817614481383714820 2017-01-06 06:10:57 UTC <Vva10967> @RepAdamSchiff why didn't IC investigate if Putin had met Trump before? Tom Arnold says they met. Trump said he'd met Putin, then denied it.
817614082186559488 2017-01-06 06:09:22 UTC <Vva10967> @RepAdamSchiff why didn't FBI investigate how Roger Stone w/ Trump campaign was 2 steps ahead of wikileaks disclosures of hacked emails?
817613785175355392 2017-01-06 06:08:11 UTC <Vva10967> @RepAdamSchiff why didn't FBI look into or report on memo it got from spy over summer saying Putin was blackmailing Trump?
817495390731767808 2017-01-06 22:17:44 UTC <Vva10967> @KaraCalavera if voting machines had been tampered with, would our government know? and would they tell us?
817495034178244608 2017-01-06 22:16:19 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes @bruceanderson @KaraCalavera @AngelaRoss1 yeah that was too coincidental. And just as Manafort had gotten back in town.
817494790317162497 2017-01-06 22:15:20 UTC <Vva10967> @KaraCalavera well Podesta's & DNC hacked emails were clearly targetted @ Bernie's angry supporters & 3rd party vote collapsed HRC blue wall
817494014169583620 2017-01-06 22:12:15 UTC <Vva10967> @modestpassion yes, bad timing, only nominees subject to filibuster are SCOTUS justices, look:  http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/harry-reid-nuclear-option-100199
817493454074822656 2017-01-06 22:10:02 UTC <Vva10967> @modestpassion I'm pretty sure the Dems changed the rules for cabinet appointments in 2014 before they lost control of the Senate. Now =51.
817492911969497089 2017-01-06 22:07:53 UTC <Vva10967> @modestpassion I'm pretty sure that the Dems don't have the votes to stop his Cabinet picks & need 3 Republicans to block any 1 nominee. 1/
817492537124470785 2017-01-06 22:06:23 UTC <Vva10967> @modestpassion if you work with him, you legitimize him and what he stands for and campaigned on.
817491679926226945 2017-01-06 22:02:59 UTC <Vva10967> @modestpassion Obama's failure has been his bipartisan kumbaya. Comey as FBI Dir also came from that as did failed immigration reform bill.
817490942353666048 2017-01-06 22:00:03 UTC <Vva10967> @modestpassion he let the Republicans in Congress write it because he believed in bipartisan BS. And they wrote it to make the bill fail.1/

817481736552648706 2017-01-06 21:23:28 UTC <Vva10967> @modestpassion or she is a patriot who puts country first and believes in the peaceful transfer of power.  Obama does too, he's going too.
817481497292767233 2017-01-06 21:22:31 UTC <Vva10967> @modestpassion Same Bernie that said he could work with Trump too. 2/
817481412542627840 2017-01-06 21:22:11 UTC <Vva10967> @modestpassion has Bernie done that? Could swear I saw him praising Cuomo just the other day when Cuomo passed free tuition bill. 1/
817480988985032705 2017-01-06 21:20:30 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion @FiliaultFrance he voted for it, no? didn't try repeal. He didn't vote for Iraq War. THAT mattered to him.
817480369310171136 2017-01-06 21:18:02 UTC <Vva10967> @modestpassion since 2010.  Under Obama's watch. He moved red state governors & senators into his Cabinet & never fought 2010 Obamacare lies

817476083167666178 2017-01-06 21:01:00 UTC <Vva10967> @modestpassion or just a vested interest in keeping Trump from killing us all and/or collapsing the economy.

817418234337099777 2017-01-06 17:11:08 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion lol, back in the 1990s she meant the gangs.  They were a real problem since Reagan who didn't want to deal w them.
817416060265697281 2017-01-06 17:02:30 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion in 1990s gangs WERE killing blacks 2. U had marches going on in predominantly black neighborhoods protesting gangs
817415639430270976 2017-01-06 17:00:49 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion and it wasn't "open racism".  She said gang members were super predators. She didn't say blacks were. 1/
817415164869877760 2017-01-06 16:58:56 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion in 1990s even Rev Al Sharpton was FOR that crime bill. Had unintended consequences which HRC was going to fix.
817414598039138306 2017-01-06 16:56:41 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion there is also a project to revitalize Detroit and lend money to buy & fix homes. Work sponsored by Clinton Foundat
817414216067977216 2017-01-06 16:55:10 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion Sanders is stuck in 2008. She's working w/ banks to address racism & get them to lend to minority owned businesses
817412744324481025 2017-01-06 16:49:19 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion Bernie's coat of paint on it was even fresher. He's never had a relationship w black community. VT is too white.
817412295651446784 2017-01-06 16:47:32 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion Bernie voted FOR that bill that you all excoriate Hillary for.  She was FLOTUS and didn't have a vote.
817412028763688961 2017-01-06 16:46:29 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion since HRC lost, she won't be able to reform the criminal justice system and Trump will make things worse.

817409448683732992 2017-01-06 16:36:13 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion Bernie thought and still thinks of issues of race as "identity politics" that take back seat to class warfare. 3/
817409133641158656 2017-01-06 16:34:58 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion could have gotten done what Obama couldn't because he backed down every time he touched race & racism. She didn't.
817408938538893316 2017-01-06 16:34:12 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 @modestpassion she's the ONLY candidate for POTUS willing to take on systemic racism, support BLM & Mothers of Movement. 1/
817405962181050368 2017-01-06 16:22:22 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou agreed he went so far that when he FINALLY endorsed her, his hard core brain-washed supporters called HIM a sellout & walked away
817405499574546432 2017-01-06 16:20:32 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 Unlike Warren, Bernie could NEVER bring himself to say HRC has a good heart, will fight 4 us & is champion we need in WH.  2/
817405030588448770 2017-01-06 16:18:40 UTC <Vva10967> @ihearthk4 but SHE was to Obama when she endorsed him because goal was winning the White House. Bernie never took back his claims on HRC. 1/
817396637404450816 2017-01-06 15:45:19 UTC <Vva10967> @Mas5665 Single payer was never on the table.  What Lieberman stopped was the public option. Obamacare was always Romneycare with diff name.
817253111785930756 2017-01-05 06:15:00 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon and that's probably because Putin is blackmailing Trump per the spy memo that the FBI got over the summer and chose to ignore.

817235183632052230 2017-01-05 05:03:45 UTC <Vva10967> @armandodkos She's a Bernie Sanders follower. Doesn't care about the Dem party, probably isn't a Democrat. Willing to normalize Trump.
817232401407574016 2017-01-05 04:52:42 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes @joanwalsh seems to believe that @HillaryClinton has nothing better to do with her life! Her Foundation work alone would be 24/7.
817230771421331456 2017-01-05 04:46:13 UTC <Vva10967> @colbertlateshow maybe because we excoriated the most qualified candidate ever over some stupid emails (or allowed it to happen)?

816543410068844544 2017-01-03 07:14:54 UTC <Vva10967> @RBReich @HillaryClinton will always put country first. Always has, always will. She believes in the peaceful transfer of power.

816324670815424513 2017-01-03 16:45:42 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias strongly disagree. But then again, the notion that the DNC is an all-powerful king-making institution is a Bernie myth.

815692512182542336 2017-01-01 22:53:44 UTC <Vva10967> Exactly.  Stop making excuses for the Trump enablers. The Nazis were as guilty as Hitler. @ChrisCuomohttps://twitter.com/owillis/status/815609650653630466
815690762239299585 2017-01-01 22:46:47 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN @VanJones68 you just described the Trump Platform while grossly distorting Hillary's.  And Trump won the WWC with that platform.

815650980738043905 2017-01-01 20:08:42 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou should say the "CNN days are over" The Right hates them and now the Left does too. @jaketapper is the only journalist left there.
815650216468742145 2017-01-01 20:05:40 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou I miss her. So wish she were our President. 
815331269110362112 2016-12-31 22:58:17 UTC <Vva10967> @Evan_McMullin @Gabbiedrice78K it would contradict his explanation of why Hillary lost (didn't reach out to the WWC). Can't have that, lol.
815326648820203520 2016-12-31 22:39:55 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @keithchaput You might as well, you already gave us Trump as POTUS with your third party votes.
815326064381661185 2016-12-31 22:37:36 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders why not? Trump did it and the WWC voted for him. He's now rewarding his donors with Cabinet positions & WWC is okay with it.
815262537008775169 2016-12-31 18:25:10 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou was looking at one of your Oct 2015 articles. Tad Devine corrupted Bernie after all & created HH-Left.http://www.hillarymen.com/latest/bernie-dont-go-down-that-anti-hillary-road
815260506927861760 2016-12-31 18:17:06 UTC <Vva10967> @davidfolkenflik yeah but you guys in the media, and particularly the NYT, elected him with your Clinton Derangement Syndrome & EmailGate.
815258966259339266 2016-12-31 18:10:58 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou is there a difference between the 2 groups? 
815258191776849920 2016-12-31 18:07:54 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem @KaraCalavera and Comey reported to @LorettaLynch who allowed him to break DOJ rules & protocol to go ONLY after HRC.
815257934645133312 2016-12-31 18:06:53 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem @KaraCalavera except that he nominated Comey to be his FBI director knowing Comey was a Republican, bc of bipartisan kumbaya.
815243930933440512 2016-12-31 17:11:14 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro in your examples, what the voters you point out are revolting against is change & the browness of the new immigrants, the "other" 3/
815243237757571078 2016-12-31 17:08:29 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro you're reading too much into the Presidential election result. Almost 3 million more people voted for HRC & her platform. 2/2
815242906164338689 2016-12-31 17:07:09 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro Trump won because at least 80,000 Bernie fools in MI PA & WI fell for the info Russia fed them in Podesta's & DNC hacked emails. 1/
815042621051666433 2016-12-30 03:51:18 UTC <Vva10967> @CatchaRUSSpy then again, Trump could get US there easily, lol.
814890454491729920 2016-12-30 17:46:38 UTC <Vva10967> It's sad how the Alt Right, the MSM & Trump were able to slander the Clinton Foundation @ClintonFdnhttps://medium.com/clintonfoundation/clinton-foundation-what-you-need-to-know-now-df0b1aa865a5#.fdq511pc9
814727081758248961 2016-12-29 06:57:27 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @dstreamdiver winning for presidential election or for getting back the U.S. House and the State Govs & Legislatures? Not same.
814726311704936448 2016-12-29 06:54:24 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @dstreamdiver & it's more what Trump & right wing repeat i.e. immigration = more terrorists, criminals, rapists & gang members
814699412970700801 2016-12-29 05:07:31 UTC <Vva10967> @McFaul but they were able to hack FL machines before the election? When FBI interfered in the election how can it be trusted to tell truth?
814697354670571520 2016-12-29 04:59:20 UTC <Vva10967> @TomPerez @EllisonCampaign thinking I should have used these addresses instead for my question.  See below, thanks!https://twitter.com/Vva10967/status/814693564051587074

814693564051587074 2016-12-29 04:44:16 UTC <Vva10967> @LaborSec @keithellison I think caucuses should go & be replaced w/ normal primaries 2 make voting easier 4 everyone. What's your position?
814682904135602177 2016-12-29 04:01:55 UTC <Vva10967> @CatchaRUSSpy @NavyvetPC true, but my point is that no, Wikileaks is not stopping. What we saw here IS now being repeated in Germany.
814675729011056641 2016-12-29 03:33:24 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @AC360 @NBCNews @ABC @CBSNews @washingtonpost @nytimes @MSNBC Are you all going to get this story right or just parrot Trump? https://twitter.com/TonyRomm/status/814260720443490304
814675092911308800 2016-12-29 03:30:52 UTC <Vva10967> @CatchaRUSSpy Trump didn't have enough voters to elect him. He won because enough in the Far Left (70,000) voted 3rd party in MI, WI & PA
814674691638042624 2016-12-29 03:29:17 UTC <Vva10967> @NavyvetPC @CatchaRUSSpy they started leaking emails targeting Angela Merkel a couple of weeks ago so MO seems to be the same & not stopping
814674361630281733 2016-12-29 03:27:58 UTC <Vva10967> @CatchaRUSSpy actually it was the Far Left that elected Trump & the hacked emails were directed at them & at their myths
814673887510327296 2016-12-29 03:26:05 UTC <Vva10967> @maslaniks @CatchaRUSSpy why hasn't the US government ever taken down the Wikileaks website? It's put US personnel at risk in the past.

814346274170404864 2016-12-28 05:44:16 UTC <Vva10967> @v1ss_a_v Bernie by the way is not as dirt poor as he pretends to be.
814345833764323328 2016-12-28 05:42:31 UTC <Vva10967> @v1ss_a_v she wasn't born wealthy but she was born brilliant. & she built those connections w yrs of hard work. Y do you resent her success?
814345163569070084 2016-12-28 05:39:51 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCayJ has Trump always sounded like he has a cognitive & expressive disability? is it possible he's getting Alzheimer's?
814343638188756992 2016-12-28 05:33:47 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @thenation is also a good one.

814241320793477122 2016-12-28 22:47:13 UTC <Vva10967> @OrenCNN @jaketapper or he may be trying to distract from the fact that the Israeli AG is now investigating him for fraud and corruption.
814236805251952641 2016-12-28 22:29:16 UTC <Vva10967> @Freeyourmindkid his voters are really stupid.  It's not like his anti-union record was a secret.

814006266184036352 2016-12-27 07:13:12 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan @RBRadio1 Berners were "trading" 3rd party votes in swing states for 3rd party votes in safe states wk bf election.
814005922578239488 2016-12-27 07:11:50 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan @RBRadio1 there are no coal miners in those states. And she had the only plan to actually help them.
814005270225502209 2016-12-27 07:09:14 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan @RBRadio1 She would have survived Comey, the rogue NY FBI & the Russian hackers but/for the Alt Left sabotage.
814005068202708995 2016-12-27 07:08:26 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan @RBRadio1 yeah but it was the Alt Left protest vote in MI PA & WI that blew her wall, <78.000 across those 3 states.
814003779523772417 2016-12-27 07:03:19 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan @RBRadio1 & his stump speeches for her were weak & focused on how bad Trump was, not on how good she was.
814003306204950528 2016-12-27 07:01:26 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan @RBRadio1 after he trashed her so badly that his hard core followers called HIM a sold out.
814002896186540032 2016-12-27 06:59:48 UTC <Vva10967> @fawfulfan maybe she was tired of ALWAYS being presumed guilty until proven innocent & rules only applying to her.
814000555781685248 2016-12-27 06:50:30 UTC <Vva10967> @rcwissert @madortiz1 @Freeyourmindkid @JoyWebDeveloper Obviously the Republican base.
814000190449483777 2016-12-27 06:49:03 UTC <Vva10967> @KevinDarryl lol, like Trump will sign that as President, even if Ryan & McConnell found the courage to put it up for a vote & passed it.
813997529629073408 2016-12-27 06:38:29 UTC <Vva10967> @FoxNews sure why not.  Along with Obamacare, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.  That's the Paul Ryan agenda & now he can implement it
813933568233799680 2016-12-27 02:24:19 UTC <Vva10967> @warrenforpres20 Patr Act was a mistake.But we now know better & won't repeat it when we get attacked bc Trump won't pay attn to briefings.
813932800852246532 2016-12-27 02:21:16 UTC <Vva10967> @warrenforpres20 the Wall Street Bailout was voting for it or letting the economy sink into a Great Depression.& it was paid back w interest
813932465454743552 2016-12-27 02:19:56 UTC <Vva10967> @warrenforpres20 77 Senators voted for the Iraq War and it wasn't a vote to go to War.  Look at the tape & at her remarks.
813929958859010048 2016-12-27 02:09:58 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid It's like finding out they have a KKK outfit hidden in their closet. 2/2
813929869247713280 2016-12-27 02:09:37 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid No, because voting for Trump revealed who they are and how they really feel about POC, women, LGBT, etc. etc. 1/2
813927392188178436 2016-12-27 01:59:46 UTC <Vva10967> @warrenforpres20 Also liberal while she was pursuing HillaryCare. Until the Dems shut her off when they lost the Congress in the midterm.
813927135966543872 2016-12-27 01:58:45 UTC <Vva10967> @warrenforpres20 Hillary's public service record has been liberal. To the left of Obama's in the Senate.  For women, children & LGBT as SOS.

812062137661222912 2016-12-22 22:27:55 UTC <Vva10967> @izzydanzer @protanope @Khanoisseur but I don't believe they are exempt from the Espionage Act?
811766845548150784 2016-12-21 02:54:32 UTC <Vva10967> @pbump bet he sexually assaults her. His other sexual assaults happened in Mar-A-Lago when Melania was PG & she's staying in NYC.
811748677463265280 2016-12-21 01:42:20 UTC <Vva10967> Of course he was! http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/was-rudy-giuliani-at-the-center-of-an-fbi-trump-campaign_us_585ad14ce4b014e7c72ed993?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004 via @HuffPostBlog
811722864621658112 2016-12-21 23:59:46 UTC <Vva10967> isn't their unspoken issue that Keith is Muslim and the WWC that voted for Trump believes all Muslims are trying to kill us?
811721426482954240 2016-12-21 23:54:03 UTC <Vva10967> @sahilkapur this is why the Dem Party has gotten DECIMATED under Barack Obama's tenure. She's wrong. If he succeeds, we go back to the 1950s
811720034276048900 2016-12-21 23:48:31 UTC <Vva10967> who will do the asking?  via Twitter?
811719291598995458 2016-12-21 23:45:34 UTC <Vva10967> @Lis_Smith also Faux convinced its viewers that "the country was heading in the wrong direction" & they don't believe in facts.
811613969555329025 2016-12-21 16:47:04 UTC <Vva10967> @sahilkapur he's not including the $3 Billion of free media he got from the MSM nor the value of Comey's rogueness and Russia's assistance.
811612340571537412 2016-12-21 16:40:35 UTC <Vva10967> @Amy_Siskind but this ignores that the bill can be stopped in the Senate.

811439768793993216 2016-12-20 05:14:51 UTC <Vva10967> @joshtpm The Russian-hacked emails from Podesta & the DNC gave the Alt-Left an excuse to cast protest votes and made Trump POTUS.

811439329251889152 2016-12-20 05:13:06 UTC <Vva10967> And yes it was the 3rd party protest vote that made Trump POTUS. Congrats Alt-Left, your hate for Hillary Trumped your love of country!https://twitter.com/CookPolitical/status/811329679873417216
811418223606382598 2016-12-20 03:49:14 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid agree 100% & 2018 is a make-or-break year for Democratic party as those state elections will determine gerrymandering after 2020
811365053047930881 2016-12-20 00:17:57 UTC <Vva10967> @marceelias but if investigation was closed on 7/6 per @LorettaLynch's statement on DOJ web & Comey didn't reopen it Y is FBI read'g emails?

810894016019566594 2016-12-19 17:06:13 UTC <Vva10967> @ezralevant but Bush Sr. didn't lose with 2.9 MILLION more votes. Nor was he aided by a rogue FBI, Russian hackers & Wikileaks.
810885753433636864 2016-12-19 16:33:23 UTC <Vva10967> She won against Bernie by 3.7 MILLION votes and over 300 ELECTED delegates.  Stop spreading the lies he fed you.
810738693266927616 2016-12-18 06:49:01 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 @mequantum that number is down to 78K
810738146019278848 2016-12-18 06:46:51 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 actually NAFTA was negotiated & signed by Bush Sr. What Bill signed was its ratification by Senate a year later.

809900378468872192 2016-12-16 23:17:52 UTC <Vva10967> @PoliticsQNA yeah, she rigged it by getting 4 million more votes. Right, because the DNC is so powerful it tells people how to vote.

809168510924554244 2016-12-14 22:49:41 UTC <Vva10967> @yottapoint too bad this didn't come out during the campaign.
809166869739569153 2016-12-14 22:43:09 UTC <Vva10967> She adopted MOST of your losing candidate's platform. He lost the primary by 4 million votes.  Now all Berners get Trump.
809165551440457728 2016-12-14 22:37:55 UTC <Vva10967> @lw_populist Bernie was raised in NY. Yet I never saw him at Ground Zero on the days and months that followed 9/11. I saw Hillary there.
809164636562063364 2016-12-14 22:34:17 UTC <Vva10967> @lw_populist if someone insults you 24/7 you may not like them either. Hillary was NY's senator & worked hard to rebuild NYC after 9/11
809163869230919680 2016-12-14 22:31:14 UTC <Vva10967> @bluelighttv Independents are Right Leaning or Left Leaning. Most Left Leaning Indys did right thing & went with Hillary. Busters didn't
809163187627102209 2016-12-14 22:28:32 UTC <Vva10967> @bluelighttv your hate for her makes you hear everything she says as an insult. She said she understood millenials' economic frustrations.
809099973296058368 2016-12-14 18:17:20 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm she adopted most of Bernie's wishlist. They owed the country their vote. It's called Love of Country.
809099523230494720 2016-12-14 18:15:33 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @andrew_029 @JenGranholm Most Bernie supporters put country first. But enough didn't, their hate 4 HRC was stronger than love of country.
809099283664437248 2016-12-14 18:14:36 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @andrew_029 @JenGranholm she lost WI by 22K and the election by < 80K. I'm talking about the Bernie Busters not all Bernie supporters.
809098602563903488 2016-12-14 18:11:53 UTC <Vva10967> @laureldavilacpa apparently the Republicans are okay with it so long as their side wins.
809098310963306496 2016-12-14 18:10:44 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm so did 4MM more Dem voters. And Berners f*cked the country to avenge Bernie.
809097386148642816 2016-12-14 18:07:03 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm @lw_populist He lied. He made himself look pure about not giving paid speeches when he knew he'd be in jail if he'd given one.
808925719971713026 2016-12-13 06:44:55 UTC <Vva10967> @CapehartJ did you ask her why she let Comey go rogue in July & breach DOJ rules & protocol and treat HRC unlike any other citizen?
808923628893044736 2016-12-13 06:36:36 UTC <Vva10967> @HamiltonElector They are. They should be fighting to convert the Republican electors, anything else is a waste of time & energy.
808922936413487108 2016-12-13 06:33:51 UTC <Vva10967> Because they're misguided Berners. No wonder we lose! ur side doesn't know how to fight. Until it learns, GOP will continue winning
808922447126953986 2016-12-13 06:31:55 UTC <Vva10967> so @HamiltonElector is a bunch of weak Democrats who can't hold the line plus 1 GOP? Dems shooting themselves in the foot again!Sad
808921398160871424 2016-12-13 06:27:45 UTC <Vva10967> at one point they have to decide if COUNTRY matters to them more than party or not. If it does only Hillary can stop Trump #reality
808921165590827008 2016-12-13 06:26:49 UTC <Vva10967> and you're missing the point. 270 is too high a number to swing. 38 is a stretch as is, but not unsurmountable. 1/2
808920790200647680 2016-12-13 06:25:20 UTC <Vva10967> It's a useless exercise that will end up the same way as the NeverTrump movement: With Trump being elected POTUS.
808920244546846720 2016-12-13 06:23:09 UTC <Vva10967> Seems you are.  They will never get 270 to defect.  38 IS a stretch. And you either get to 270 at the EC or the House elects Trump.
808910918813941760 2016-12-13 05:46:06 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm Bernie convinced them during primary that the Democratic party is corrupt. Don't think he walked it back either. Reason we lost
808910016812089345 2016-12-13 05:42:31 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm @TabrisThe17th HRC's platform was most progressive in history. Far Left torched it and elected Trump instead out of hate 4 HRC.
808909511838863361 2016-12-13 05:40:31 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm @lw_populist Bernie's lies regarding Hillary's character, which he never walked back, gave us Trump.
808908680477417472 2016-12-13 05:37:12 UTC <Vva10967> didn't mean to copy you, sorry.
808908333344235521 2016-12-13 05:35:50 UTC <Vva10967> @lessig but if they don't vote for @HillaryClinton they will fail, just like the NeverTrumpers failed. Only Hillary can reach 270.
808907792123826176 2016-12-13 05:33:41 UTC <Vva10967> @TheChrisSuprun You MUST put COUNTRY above party.  Putin's Puppet CANNOT keep us safe. Will get us attacked & get troops killed w/o briefing
808907485914558464 2016-12-13 05:32:28 UTC <Vva10967> @TheChrisSuprun Hillary will be restrained by the GOP majorities in House & Senate. Country will be saved as will Western World & NATO.
808907196503392257 2016-12-13 05:31:19 UTC <Vva10967> @TheChrisSuprun If you want to save this country from Putin's Puppet, you MUST vote for @HillaryClinton who has 232 EC & can get to 270.
808906934132899841 2016-12-13 05:30:16 UTC <Vva10967> @TheChrisSuprun you're going to FAIL just like the NeverTrumpers failed. Only person who can stop Trump IS Hillary. She has 232 EC.
808905899175739392 2016-12-13 05:26:09 UTC <Vva10967> @tribelaw but GOP controls >30 so Trump wins anyway since GOP puts party above country. Better 4 38 to have courage 2 vote 4 @HillaryClinton
808895616906575872 2016-12-13 04:45:18 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNewYork what happened to the "tens of thousands" he said would come? Looks like a high school gym?pic.twitter.com/OknkeQiULS
808857007243595786 2016-12-13 02:11:53 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm @TabrisThe17th That attitude elected Trump. Hope you enjoy him 4 the next 4 years. Corporate America will do great under Trump.
808854736258600960 2016-12-13 02:02:51 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm at the presidential level we lost by <80,000 votes & seems lesson is don't underestimate Far Left's hate & grudges?
808851745107542021 2016-12-13 01:50:58 UTC <Vva10967> @HillarysMen Which is why @HamiltonElector should vote for @HillaryClinton and defeat him.  Anything else fails and makes Trump POTUS.
808850846884757505 2016-12-13 01:47:24 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 @TooMuch__0 yes. May hope that if the CIA agrees to give briefing it'll be made available 2 all electors forcing GOP to listen
808820130310455300 2016-12-13 23:45:20 UTC <Vva10967> @MaddowBlog @maddow ask her why she won't appoint Special Prosecutor to investigate NY FBI leaks & Comey interference w election.
808819444336181249 2016-12-13 23:42:37 UTC <Vva10967> @MaddowBlog @maddow please ask her why she allowed Comey 2 break DOJ rules & protocol w July press conference & treat HRC unlike any citizen
808818594146635778 2016-12-13 23:39:14 UTC <Vva10967> @poniewozik @Ka5hBrokeDaBanK the west coast and also NY. You should educate yourself about state populations.
808818101882122244 2016-12-13 23:37:17 UTC <Vva10967> @poniewozik @Ka5hBrokeDaBanK there is only one recount the WI one. The others were ended by Trump's lawyers and GOP
808727968365170688 2016-12-13 17:39:07 UTC <Vva10967> @eldiariony Noticia: Trump no es religioso. No tiene idea que dice la biblia ni va nunca a misa.
808574285728141312 2016-12-12 07:28:26 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @NurseBoyStanley GOP voters vote straight party ticket no matter who the candidates are. Dems won't win until they do same.
808572374127931393 2016-12-12 07:20:51 UTC <Vva10967> what do you think made Arkansas turn red post Clinton?
808571989153710080 2016-12-12 07:19:19 UTC <Vva10967> why are the Clintons unpopular in Arkansas if they had a good track record when Bill was governor?
808563107975012353 2016-12-12 06:44:01 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou or it's proof that Putin is blackmailing Trump as report spy gave to FBI claimed he could do.
808562648380047360 2016-12-12 06:42:12 UTC <Vva10967> @cnnbrk and how would anyone know that if he hasn't released his tax returns?
808562368712245248 2016-12-12 06:41:05 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 agreed but then why make them voting? if they want spots to be able to attend convention, make them non-voting.
808559901152833536 2016-12-12 06:31:17 UTC <Vva10967> @StillLes4Hill If she had won 37 states she would have >270 EC votes. Wish she had. She won 20 states plus DC. Trump won 30.
808555569925804032 2016-12-12 06:14:04 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @karliw what, did she take their IDs away?  Give me a break. The "failing NYT" deserves Trump. Takes cheap shots at HRC.
808545812829601793 2016-12-12 05:35:18 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon Jeff Sessions is much worse.
808545599859654656 2016-12-12 05:34:27 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @naveman Bernie won't admit that Trump's xenophobic and islamophobic message resonated with the WWC in the rust belt states.
808545250486747140 2016-12-12 05:33:04 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @jmkofan yes, but that would interfere with Bernie's theory that Clinton lost because she didn't appeal to the WWC men, lol.
808544565875658752 2016-12-12 05:30:21 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert if people listen to Bernie we'll get killed in 2018 and that will decimate the party until 2030.
808543386315751424 2016-12-12 05:25:39 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @karliw WI had voter ID laws this election.  300,000 people in Milwaukee couldn't get proper IDs in time from DMV.
808494210861191168 2016-12-12 02:10:15 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @silveroinks The LEFT outnumbered the right, but failed because the Berners couldn't overcome their HATE for HRC.
808493606285746180 2016-12-12 02:07:51 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @silveroinks That's the thing, there were NOT ENOUGH Trump voters to elect him POTUS IF the Left had all voted Democratic.
808483597904707584 2016-12-12 01:28:05 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @silveroinks But it's true. There weren't enough of them. But they won because the Far Left refused to vote for Dem ticket.

808480641176260608 2016-12-12 01:16:20 UTC <Vva10967> @tribelaw but this Congress is corrupt.  They finally closed Benghazi hearings bc their goal of defeating HRC was met.
808479423255244800 2016-12-12 01:11:29 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @silveroinks There were not enough Trump voters to defeat the Left IF the Left had voted for the Democratic ticket.
808479292623622144 2016-12-12 01:10:58 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @silveroinks Maybe but they, the Trump voters, didn't elect Trump. The Berners in MI WI & PA did with their protest votes.
808478786907963392 2016-12-12 01:08:58 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @JasperQNoob The Bernie Bros gave MI PA & WI to Trump.  She won popular vote by 2.85 MILLION votes. THEY elected Trump.
808478428680830976 2016-12-12 01:07:32 UTC <Vva10967> @TimDNiles @kurteichenwald @AlwaysThinkHow But it would have been overcome if Berners hadn't voted 3rd party in MI WI & PA. It's on them.
808477892791373824 2016-12-12 01:05:25 UTC <Vva10967> The Berners did and elected Trump.https://twitter.com/kurteichenwald/status/808437743009353728

808352331284758532 2016-12-12 16:46:28 UTC <Vva10967> @JoeConason he especially told us that Pennsylvania would be rigged.
808352196924477440 2016-12-12 16:45:56 UTC <Vva10967> @JoeConason which is why the Clinton Campaign should have challenged the vote counts in MI PA & WI. He told us the election would be rigged.
808346199744974848 2016-12-12 16:22:07 UTC <Vva10967> @poniewozik @Ka5hBrokeDaBanK Hillary got 2.85 MILLION more votes than Trump.  10% of the vote is roughly 13 MILLION that were left to count.

808080880757575680 2016-12-11 22:47:50 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @HamiltonElector is another stupid NeverTrump movement that LACKS the courage to vote FOR @HillaryClinton to stop Trump.
808071740815474688 2016-12-11 22:11:30 UTC <Vva10967> @ezlusztig but he still ignored the intel. Trump won't even bother listening or reading the reports.
808010328428707840 2016-12-11 18:07:29 UTC <Vva10967> Trump thinks "intelligence" in "intelligence briefings" refers to being smart!  oi!https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/807994453650710528
808009037015027713 2016-12-11 18:02:21 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 or maybe Putin IS blackmailing Trump like the Spy report that the FBI got in August said.  http://www.motherjones.com/print/317801

807712713870872576 2016-12-10 22:24:52 UTC <Vva10967> @yashar however this approach requires that you be known for murdering your enemies so you truly instill fear in everyone else.
807711541181218816 2016-12-10 22:20:12 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn may go down now that we know that he chose to stay silent over Russian interference because of his obsession w/ bipartisanship.
807709802579238912 2016-12-10 22:13:18 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 they should have gone after Comey when he FIRST breached protocol & broke DOJ rules in JULY press conference. Dems R too nice

807698777356271616 2016-12-10 21:29:29 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @SenSanders if you'd admitted you were lying when you said @hillaryclinton was corrupt & primary was rigged, we wouldn't have this problem.
807697890558799876 2016-12-10 21:25:58 UTC <Vva10967> @LindseyGrahamSC or as @HillaryClinton said in debate, they want a Puppet in the White House to lift all sanctions & take Ukraine back.
807696878649360384 2016-12-10 21:21:56 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh maybe a sex tape of him cheating on Melania while he was in Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant?
807671176868798465 2016-12-10 19:39:49 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @HillaryClinton DID warn us that @realDonaldTrump would be Putin's Puppet. He's proving her right with this appointment.
807643468042563584 2016-12-10 17:49:42 UTC <Vva10967> @FBIRecordsVault @kurteichenwald This too should be investigated.  Likely Russian hacked system.  Too much coincidence.

807639862304075778 2016-12-10 17:35:23 UTC <Vva10967> @FranklinFoer if you're talking about Paul Manafort, he also has lived in Trump Tower's 43rd floor since 2006.
807638147744092160 2016-12-10 17:28:34 UTC <Vva10967> @jasoninthehouse U investigated @HillaryClinton endlessly 4 MUCH less than this. @NancyPelosi @RepCummings @SpeakerRyan #DemandInvestigationhttps://twitter.com/grudging1/status/807588063656509440

807477375999033344 2016-12-09 06:49:43 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah @AlanKestrel750 or the 6 dipshit Democratic Electors in CO and WA who are Bernie worshipers and want to vote for Kasich.

807475030665940992 2016-12-09 06:40:24 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid BUT @KamalaHarris and/or @AGSchneiderman COULD save us if they file the Equal Protection lawsuit re EC with the SCOTUS

807472033235869696 2016-12-09 06:28:29 UTC <Vva10967> @marceelias so only @POTUS & Intel agencies will know beyond reasonable doubt that Trump stole the election? We need 9-11 type of hearings!
807466878876663808 2016-12-09 06:08:00 UTC <Vva10967> @jmpalmieri I find it more upsetting that @POTUS didn't stand up for @HillaryClinton and let this happen seeking "bipartisanship" again.

807370030069465089 2016-12-09 23:43:10 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewstoller Fake News are fabricated by Republicans. Iraq War was. What's your point?
807358418570924032 2016-12-09 22:57:01 UTC <Vva10967> @billmaher @TySabs @krschu00 So you all got Trump elected instead? He's 1000X worse on all those fronts.
807357731241922560 2016-12-09 22:54:17 UTC <Vva10967> @billmaher The one you shouldn't want to see again is Bernie, HIS followers made Trump POTUS with their 3rd party votes in MI PA & WI
807341585281282048 2016-12-09 21:50:08 UTC <Vva10967> @yottapoint I think the hate for Hillary & Dem Party that Bernie instilled in his followers explains this. May not have realized it'd last.

807127632060018688 2016-12-08 07:39:57 UTC <Vva10967> @soledadobrien @dandrezner but she lost election because < 80,000 Berners cast third party protest votes in MI PA & WI to say FU to her
807108316883255296 2016-12-08 06:23:12 UTC <Vva10967> And the hate for America has started and he hasn't even been sworn in yet.https://twitter.com/ReutersPolitics/status/807097468106264576

806743010599833602 2016-12-07 06:11:36 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah @DonnaDiva Actually US intel professionals should thank Comey for the disrespect they are now getting from both sides.

806740748389400577 2016-12-07 06:02:37 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 the Superdelegates should be non-voting. Then we don't have to argue that the person who got 4MM more votes "cheated".

806546328402661376 2016-12-07 17:10:04 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid they would be filing this lawsuit with the SCOTUS asap: https://medium.com/@lessig/the-equal-protection-argument-against-winner-take-all-in-the-electoral-college-b09e8a49d777#.b7oo1t1fc @KamalaHarris
806537633430126593 2016-12-07 16:35:31 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @Maverik877 they must either show courage & patriotism by voting for the ONLY candidate who CAN defeat him in the EC, Hillary, or shut up
806537194152267777 2016-12-07 16:33:46 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @Maverik877 oh I do.  I also understand that the NeverTrumpers have been trying to defeat Trump 4 over a year and keep failing.
806536649081495556 2016-12-07 16:31:36 UTC <Vva10967> @marceelias @KamalaHarris speaking of CA, have you looked at this? His argument seems consistent with Bush v Gore.https://medium.com/@lessig/the-equal-protection-argument-against-winner-take-all-in-the-electoral-college-b09e8a49d777#.78igtwo5d
806535822719729664 2016-12-07 16:28:19 UTC <Vva10967> @TheChrisSuprun @lutherlowe @Maverik877 2.7 MILLION more people voted 4 Hillary than Trump. Kasich was defeated in the primary. Not a choice
806345876331524096 2016-12-06 03:53:32 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN @VanJones68 you're in denial. Michael Moore is right.  Trump doesn't even understand trade. Has never read Nafta. Carrier deal was sham
806344628152791044 2016-12-06 03:48:35 UTC <Vva10967> @TheChrisSuprun @lutherlowe BULLSHIT. If the Electors want to stop Trump, they must vote for HILLARY.  It's called COURAGE & LOVE OF COUNTRY
806342347588009984 2016-12-06 03:39:31 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid She's actually over 2.7 Million.
806340613759176704 2016-12-06 03:32:38 UTC <Vva10967> @KFILE only the Democrats.  @jasoninthehouse is pretending he's blind.
806339841910775808 2016-12-06 03:29:34 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost what about Gen Flynn himself? He retwitted the PizzaGate story claiming it was true on Nov 2nd. Should disqualify him.
806215077946945536 2016-12-06 19:13:47 UTC <Vva10967> @ReutersPolitics maybe you should add that Trump's tweet came 22 minutes after story that Boeing criticized him for how he's handling China
806214396666138624 2016-12-06 19:11:05 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou they're as deplorable as the Trump followers.
806212538962759685 2016-12-06 19:03:42 UTC <Vva10967> @Unashamed_Chuck and you consume fake news.
806187907811831810 2016-12-06 17:25:50 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @whitegalvin @ShelbyEmerald maybe @Lawrence or @maddow @MaddowBlog or @JoyAnnReid  or @jaketapper (only good one left at CNN)
806186000783392768 2016-12-06 17:18:15 UTC <Vva10967> @patysq73 IF enough votes are flipped in a state, she gets the Electoral College votes of that state and wins if she reaches 270 EC total.
806185589041168384 2016-12-06 17:16:37 UTC <Vva10967> @MesMitch their argument is that no recount has ever flipped > 10,000 votes. But this election has been like no other so who knows.
806184339201462272 2016-12-06 17:11:39 UTC <Vva10967> @CNBC @kylegriffin1 wonder if @realDonaldTrump will do same with Lockeed Martin,Northrop Grumman & other defense contractors paid billions?
806028969153822721 2016-12-05 06:54:16 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @teeging @realcaptainmorg Bernie had even less chance. The amount of opposition research on him was HUGE.
806012830252232704 2016-12-05 05:50:08 UTC <Vva10967> @ElectProject which 18 haven't certified yet?
806008853896773632 2016-12-05 05:34:20 UTC <Vva10967> @MMFlint never mind the Trump voters. If just 2 BernBusters hadn't voted third party, Trump wouldn't be President Elect.
806008259941376000 2016-12-05 05:31:58 UTC <Vva10967> @MMFlint yeah but what's ahead will be under Trump, not under Obama. Could have been under Hillary if BernBusters hadn't voted 3rd party.
806007839760273408 2016-12-05 05:30:18 UTC <Vva10967> @MMFlint but he's saying that he'll cast his vote for a Republican like Kasich. If no one gets 270 it goes to House where each state= 1 vote
806000768465698816 2016-12-05 05:02:12 UTC <Vva10967> Trump continues to be afraid of the Michigan recount.  What is he hiding???https://twitter.com/paulegan4/status/805878073035988992
805997216456470533 2016-12-05 04:48:05 UTC <Vva10967> @Lawrence @maddow @JoyAnnReid I don't understand why @washingtonpost & @nytimes pretend they treated Hillary fairlyhttp://politi.co/1Ho8V4a
805996723227258880 2016-12-05 04:46:08 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost @nytimes how can you deny your role in Trump's election when you purposefully trashed Hillary?  http://politi.co/1Ho8V4a
805984678343823360 2016-12-05 03:58:16 UTC <Vva10967> @JuddLegum problem is that he is contemplating voting for Kasich. If no one gets 270 it goes to the House where they get 1 vote per state.
805984451826241536 2016-12-05 03:57:22 UTC <Vva10967> @JuddLegum @hillofbeans17 @politibeast we don't run dangerous demagogues willing to start a war with China on twitter.
805945255585546240 2016-12-05 01:21:37 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro Since Trump has no core beliefs and loves celebrities we should send Leonardo DeCaprio next, lol.
805856006664228864 2016-12-05 19:26:58 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid did Holder say why @LorettaLynch has NOT prosecuted any cases since taking over? eg WI & NC come to mind.
805851123949170690 2016-12-05 19:07:34 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @Physicstocks how's a narrative of reality "committing treason"?
805820997916065800 2016-12-05 17:07:51 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro He's not different than Clarence Thomas who fights tooth and nail the very system of civil rights that got him there.
805819736307142656 2016-12-05 17:02:51 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou I think the real cult is not Trump's but Bernie's. The Berners gave the election to Trump to avenge their "wronged saviour".
805819018561077248 2016-12-05 17:00:00 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @xwex Not all those years, Bernie's attacks during the primary plus media's relentless obsession over her emails. Plus Comey.
805818542956363776 2016-12-05 16:58:06 UTC <Vva10967> @cbouzy @JenGranholm @JoyAnnReid specially when MI didn't even have a Senate race.  Why go vote at all if you're not voting for POTUS?
805664786595872768 2016-12-04 06:47:08 UTC <Vva10967> @SpeakerRyan How do you sleep at night??? You have no conscience, no heart, no moral code, no ethics, only partisanship left.
805663968522104832 2016-12-04 06:43:53 UTC <Vva10967> Ryan showing again that he is not for the little guy.https://twitter.com/speakerryan/status/805562892921831424
805663107263643648 2016-12-04 06:40:27 UTC <Vva10967> @mathieuvonrohr @deray @williamjordann and Assange has already started his wiki leaks attack on her. He has become an enemy of democracy.
805647870540058624 2016-12-04 05:39:55 UTC <Vva10967> @ByronTau You do know that Breitbart is a neo nazi white supremacist site, don't you? That's what "Alt Right" is.
805647419602046978 2016-12-04 05:38:07 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou Heck, he told us to elect Hillary.  Not his fault that the Berners voted 3rd party in MI PA & WI and elected Trump.
805643250442924032 2016-12-04 05:21:33 UTC <Vva10967> The MI recount is back on! And Judge says state must "assemble necessary staff to work sufficient hours" to make sure it's done by Dec 13!https://twitter.com/paulegan4/status/805640496823603200
805531506198347776 2016-12-04 21:57:31 UTC <Vva10967> @GovMikeHuckabee Then the recounts will show that, no? If he won fair & square, what are you afraid of?
805528658949574656 2016-12-04 21:46:12 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 you never think it could happen in super liberal blue NYC.
805528250554392576 2016-12-04 21:44:35 UTC <Vva10967> Thanks! Didn't realize it was the same guy you blocked, lol. Just blocked him too.
805526207747989505 2016-12-04 21:36:28 UTC <Vva10967> @tristanwalker @blykmyk44 @jonfavs yeah I'd understand that he means that the black guy in the White House destroyed America, like Faux says
805525504761753600 2016-12-04 21:33:40 UTC <Vva10967> @thatmattwade @jonfavs yes, in a conversation about Making America White Again, like in the 1950s.
805525344191152131 2016-12-04 21:33:02 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs @kaaawababy @tristanwalker So if you buy into the media narrative that HRC is inauthentic and untrustworthy, nothing matters, no?
805524094867374080 2016-12-04 21:28:04 UTC <Vva10967> @thethriftygene OR he got the Dem Party DECIMATED because he couldn't communicate to voters the good he and the Dems did passing the ACA.
805521386143879168 2016-12-04 21:17:18 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @eee_eff Dems lose elections over purity tests and infighting. Unless & until that stops, GOP will continue to win
805520985722068992 2016-12-04 21:15:43 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @eee_eff @LBTheDemocrat @peterdaou The "OMG, no press conferences" was media bullshit.  It didn't apply to Trump & still doesn't.
805520638291181568 2016-12-04 21:14:20 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @eee_eff @LBTheDemocrat @peterdaou She was tired of being presumed guilty until proven innocent and drew a line in the sand.
805520301924749312 2016-12-04 21:13:00 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @eee_eff LOL, could it be that she's actually HONEST? She could have lied to win and didn't.
805519837204250624 2016-12-04 21:11:09 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @eee_eff It doesn't matter WHAT the issue is, Hillary gets treated differently, as guilty until proven innocent.
805519527710720000 2016-12-04 21:09:55 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @eee_eff nah, he would get a break. Just like he did in 2008 & in 2012. He's promoted fracking his entire 2 terms.
805498016882946049 2016-12-04 19:44:27 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @eee_eff but only one gets excoriated for it by the same voters.
805497325590298624 2016-12-04 19:41:42 UTC <Vva10967> @Evan_McMullin The GOP has lost its soul & become the Party of Trump.  @jasoninthehouse refuses 2 investigate Trump's conflicts of interest
805496289903448064 2016-12-04 19:37:35 UTC <Vva10967> @centojack81 @jonfavs and the damage Bush caused in the Middle East has been irreversible.  And Bush wasn't nearly as bad as Trump is.
805495928832589824 2016-12-04 19:36:09 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs Not as much as Bernie did during the primary. To date, he's still trashing the Democratic party as corrupt. Not great for GOTV.
805495295572320258 2016-12-04 19:33:38 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias @jonfavs @danpfeiffer Hillary ran as continuation of Obama's legacy, Trump ran as repudiation of it. But for Berners she'd won
805493933702860800 2016-12-04 19:28:13 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias @jonfavs @danpfeiffer or in 2010 or in 2014.  The Democratic party got DECIMATED under Obama despite all the good he did.
805492486588268545 2016-12-04 19:22:28 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @eee_eff So the Democratic voters in 2008 CHOSE "Hope and Fracking" and as SOS HRC marketed HIS agenda bc he won.
805492066142842880 2016-12-04 19:20:48 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @eee_eff Hillary voted AGAINST 2005 Energy Bill that exempts fracking from Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act & CERCLA
805491930968850432 2016-12-04 19:20:16 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @eee_eff Obama voted FOR 2005 Energy Bill that exempts fracking from Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act & CERCLA.
805491520593940481 2016-12-04 19:18:38 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @eee_eff and in the 2008 primary she was anti-fracking while Obama was pro-fracking and people didn't give a f*ck.
805490861962305536 2016-12-04 19:16:01 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @noiserawker AND because he wasn't the nominee so GOP never attacked him. They've attacked HRC for 30 years.
805489930751320065 2016-12-04 19:12:19 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 @PeterSzucs90 He IS wrong. WI counts Milwaukee absentee & provisional last. So numbers reflect election night results 4 now.
805489270064640000 2016-12-04 19:09:41 UTC <Vva10967> @TVietor08 actually he is. WI counts Milwaukee absentee & provisional ballots last. Numbers will track election night results before that.
805488571503247360 2016-12-04 19:06:55 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou The notion that a 75 socialist is the future of a party that he is NOT a member of is mind boggling. They're a mindless cult.
805487904176869376 2016-12-04 19:04:16 UTC <Vva10967> @bagglo @NeuOligarch so she shouldn't have given speeches because it offends your purity test?  ahhhh.
805464044534722560 2016-12-04 17:29:27 UTC <Vva10967> @bagglo @NeuOligarch Bernie would have gone to JAIL had he given a paid speech to anyone not bc he's "pure" but bc law prohibits it.
805463663486320640 2016-12-04 17:27:56 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @bagglo @NeuOligarch her speeches were given AFTER she left her SOS post and BEFORE she decided to run again for POTUS.
805461465125847041 2016-12-04 17:19:12 UTC <Vva10967> @bagglo @NeuOligarch Bc Bernie convinced U of that. She gave > 100 speeches. Agency that represented her had >50 other speakers w same rate.
805461051944869888 2016-12-04 17:17:34 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @bagglo @NeuOligarch only bc Dems allowed it to be an issue. Former Presidents & SOSs have given paid speeches for decades.
805460189101064192 2016-12-04 17:14:08 UTC <Vva10967> @aravosis @roselaura100 there weren't enough of them to elect Trump. He couldn't have won if protest voters had voted for Dem ticket.
805457847517671425 2016-12-04 17:04:50 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper has Comey resurfaced? is he in hiding or something? why isn't he being hunted down by the media for a comment?
805311364164190208 2016-12-03 07:22:45 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm the hate for Hillary that Bernie instilled in his followers is strong and elected Trump. Bernie never walked slanders back.
805303831043129344 2016-12-03 06:52:49 UTC <Vva10967> @Amy_Siskind Maybe we can all do this for Hillary? I already submitted my nomination.https://twitter.com/stylistkavin/status/805231786657624064
805111946848702466 2016-12-03 18:10:21 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou LOL, these are the same people who attacked Warren 4 not backing their saviour in the primary & endorsing Hillary in the general
804912765504802816 2016-12-02 04:58:52 UTC <Vva10967> @thefix @washingtonpost articles like this make me question the wisdom of subscribing to you.  You need to rethink keeping @TheFix
804912117212127232 2016-12-02 04:56:17 UTC <Vva10967> @AriBerman MI AG is also opposing it and Trump SuperPACs are opposing the recount in WI. They sure fear something.
804909927277989889 2016-12-02 04:47:35 UTC <Vva10967> @Saberghoff did you see this? https://protectourelections.nationbuilder.com/florida_recount I don't know if they filed today but they did reach their fundraising goal.
804905586425032704 2016-12-02 04:30:20 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah He makes W look good, lol.
804904750324060160 2016-12-02 04:27:01 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou and by voting third party just to say FU to her. We lost WI by 22,177 votes, PA by 46,435 and MI by 10,707, total of 79,319.
804901318854852608 2016-12-02 04:13:23 UTC <Vva10967> THIS IS FALSE:  Trump Won 3,084 of 3,141 Counties, Clinton Won 57http://www.snopes.com/trump-won-3084-of-3141-counties-clinton-won-57/
804900183704305664 2016-12-02 04:08:52 UTC <Vva10967> @AriBerman the Dems can block him and keep the vacancy vacant.  The Republicans said they were going to do it to Hillary, so why not?
804794531011055616 2016-12-02 21:09:03 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @maddow @Lawrence @amjoyshow Please cover this story. Thanks!https://twitter.com/Amy_Siskind/status/804730602352214017
804756690449158145 2016-12-02 18:38:41 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure If he had meant his BS about unity, he wouldn't have nominated Jeff Sessions as AG. Or be meeting with Chris Kovack or crazy sheriff.
804731771569008641 2016-12-02 16:59:40 UTC <Vva10967> @NancyPelosi @keithellison Dems need to stop pretending Election Result was about Economics.  It was about white nationalism.https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/804717302944006144
804730571851239424 2016-12-02 16:54:54 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @SenSchumer @timkaine @SenWarren @SenatorReid The election was a referendum on White identity, NOT economics. HRC was right.https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/804717302944006144
804724045610700800 2016-12-02 16:28:58 UTC <Vva10967> If you live in Michigan, please call.  Something fishy going on there that Trump is trying to cover up.  Also share widely.https://twitter.com/leahmcelrath/status/804713760304799744
804722332610785280 2016-12-02 16:22:09 UTC <Vva10967> @MIAttyGen what are you afraid of? If Trump won fair and square the result won't change.  On the other hand if GOP cheated, it will.
804720601915125762 2016-12-02 16:15:17 UTC <Vva10967> @AlyssaMastro44 maybe Trump saw that didn't keep McCain from being an assh*ole to Obama for the past 8 years.
804578537101463552 2016-12-01 06:50:46 UTC <Vva10967> @thefix @joanwalsh Thing is that @TheFix has always hated Hillary. He was one of the worse going after her character. Everything was negative
804577615931645953 2016-12-01 06:47:06 UTC <Vva10967> @thefix @ahumorlessfem @TheFix has always hated Hillary.
804556053107118080 2016-12-01 05:21:25 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon has Comey gone MIA? He should have been excoriated back in July when he first went rogue breaking DOJ rules & precedent.
804539402798174209 2016-12-01 04:15:15 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou how large do you think the Hillary-hating Berner group is? They are active on social media but I wonder how many there are 4 real
804538419313606658 2016-12-01 04:11:21 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @amandablount2 @ReedItAnWeep you must have missed the "I will compromise with him" portion of his speech & the $10 min wage is ok
804538063141605376 2016-12-01 04:09:56 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @IJefTomI @jim_mcallen so she should have gone racist xenophobic islamophobic homophobic & misogynist like Trump? lol
804524648650174465 2016-12-01 03:16:38 UTC <Vva10967> @Shakestweetz while he tells us how great his AG nominee is.
804520804813832197 2016-12-01 03:01:21 UTC <Vva10967> @CapehartJ the "emails are a crime" story is bogus. He knows it. Comey knows it. The media is again providing a FALSE narrative about it.
804520147000184832 2016-12-01 02:58:44 UTC <Vva10967> @ToddCmii that creates trillion $$$ deficits that R piled on 2 the national debt. Hope U like currency devaluations when he defaults on debt
804466174331420676 2016-12-01 23:24:16 UTC <Vva10967> Trump is afraid of the Recounts.  Does he know something we don't? @JoyAnnReid @Lawrence @maddow @jaketapperhttp://www.rawstory.com/2016/12/trump-campaign-files-objection-to-jill-steins-lawless-insulting-michigan-recount/#.WECwsAB0VJo.twitter
804464608450854912 2016-12-01 23:18:03 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah HRC should have ran ads spelling it out and maybe added some cats to the ads too.  Low info voters generally don't read.
804460586813767680 2016-12-01 23:02:04 UTC <Vva10967> @samsteinhp @peterdaou @annaleclaire People like you are the problem.  Hope you enjoy Trump. You elected him with your hate for Hillary.
804459480301916160 2016-12-01 22:57:40 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou I agree with U but Sam Stein's numbers R off. The recount needs to flip the full 79,319 votes that Trump is ahead by to celebrate
804433418972839937 2016-12-01 21:14:07 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod CNN is having an effect on you, lol.  No offense but it seems it's frying your brain. Quit it before it's too late.
804431490180268033 2016-12-01 21:06:27 UTC <Vva10967> @guycecil which explains why HRC running to continue Obama legacy didn't appeal at all to Trump voters, they live in an alternate reality.
804429714383192064 2016-12-01 20:59:24 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes You're such a Bernie fan.
804429344277872640 2016-12-01 20:57:55 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow Thank God! @hardball with Chris Matthews is unbearable to watch @MSNBC, he's sooo giddy about Trump, makes me puke.
804428714867978240 2016-12-01 20:55:25 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald Gary's vote was way larger than Jill's. Likely Berners voting against Hillary because Bernie told them she was corrupt.
804427937449549824 2016-12-01 20:52:20 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald Bet most of her voters are Bernie supporters who were convinced by Bernie that Hillary is corrupt & blamed HRC for his loss
804412678525435904 2016-12-01 19:51:42 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs I would bet they were Bernie voters who blame Hillary for his loss.
804411918148464640 2016-12-01 19:48:41 UTC <Vva10967> @JerryBrownGov @RepBecerra Congratulations!
804411099932082176 2016-12-01 19:45:26 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Trump is apparently worried about those recounts. WI margin is 22.177, PA is down to 46,435 & MI is 10,707. Total 79,319.
804410763662139392 2016-12-01 19:44:05 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Gary Johnson is the Ralph Nader.  She's roughly at the typical !% or under that Green party gets. He's not. He's way up.
804410251474653185 2016-12-01 19:42:03 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah he's also term limited as Governor. Election is in 2017,
804407511600209920 2016-12-01 19:31:10 UTC <Vva10967> @docwindprod It was always like he was afraid 2 take sides w/ African Americans. HRC didn't have that fear & didn't have it in Senate either
804407107160342528 2016-12-01 19:29:34 UTC <Vva10967> @docwindprod HRC would have been a better leader than Obama. Obama never really stood up for the African Americans who elected him.
804406705551351808 2016-12-01 19:27:58 UTC <Vva10967> @docwindprod You are SO bitter.  The Dems need to shake up the bitter people like you, it's unproductive. You should go form your own party.
804406370422390784 2016-12-01 19:26:38 UTC <Vva10967> @docwindprod Nop. Johnson votes tracks Dem losses in votes.  Jill stayed at the normal 1% or under that the Green party typically gets.
804403742703554560 2016-12-01 19:16:12 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn please tell me it's a joke? Trump didn't actually say that, did he?
804402591132188674 2016-12-01 19:11:37 UTC <Vva10967> @richardmskinner @Nate_Cohn @Joseph100960 Now they get to find out what that entailed. And on top of that they want to hijack the Dem party!
804399962608074753 2016-12-01 19:01:10 UTC <Vva10967> @docwindprod The Party is NOT Dying.  She won over 65 MILLION VOTES. Berners screwed her with 3rd party votes. That's a fact.
804398721710649344 2016-12-01 18:56:14 UTC <Vva10967> @wisgop @RDHague You can't steal what isn't yours.  And they seem a bit fearful, no?
804227709341724672 2016-11-30 07:36:42 UTC <Vva10967> @ElectProject but if Gov is Democrat will decision still be appealed?
804223981817565184 2016-11-30 07:21:53 UTC <Vva10967> @marceelias can't believe you gave this reporter an interview. He's such a Hillary hater. Can never say a single positive thing about her.
804178102624649216 2016-11-30 04:19:35 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Chris Matthews is unwatchable though. He was always giddy about Trump becoming POTUS, his secret cheerleader.
804176919335993344 2016-11-30 04:14:53 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou agree 100% with you and he never walked it back.
804176064012582912 2016-11-30 04:11:29 UTC <Vva10967> @jonlovett @jonfavs did you know that 1000s of Berners "traded" 3rd party votes in swing states for 3rd party votes in safe blue states?pic.twitter.com/59RO5yZv9u
804170008138018816 2016-11-30 03:47:25 UTC <Vva10967> @jonlovett actually true.  For them the primary didn't end until Election Day and they voted for Gary to say FU to HRC, making Trump POTUS
804161702686236673 2016-11-30 03:14:25 UTC <Vva10967> @ToddCmii it's spelled "since" not sense. And as to Carrier Pence offered them incentives to stay which Trump has said is stupid thing to do
804160815184117760 2016-11-30 03:10:53 UTC <Vva10967> @dsgoldfield22 That's what happens when your leader feeds you a myth. He lost by 4 million votes. No stealing.
804160343807295488 2016-11-30 03:09:01 UTC <Vva10967> @Redistrict CA has 600,000 left to go.
804160241818599424 2016-11-30 03:08:36 UTC <Vva10967> @Redistrict have WA, OR and CO finished counting their ballots?
804098515291033602 2016-11-30 23:03:20 UTC <Vva10967> @ToddCmii I read their signs, most can't spell. Seems to be a common trait among them. Not so on the left. Just the facts.
804098087845318671 2016-11-30 23:01:38 UTC <Vva10967> @ToddCmii lol, should be "could not spell well".
804097876041355269 2016-11-30 23:00:47 UTC <Vva10967> @ToddCmii LOL, then you should criticize Trump & the GOP leadership, not ours. That's like Bernie criticizing the Dems when he isn't one.
804096341538381824 2016-11-30 22:54:41 UTC <Vva10967> no, disgruntled Bernie voters choosing to vote third party in MI, PA & WI just to say FU to Hillary. They elected Trump.
804096040483901443 2016-11-30 22:53:30 UTC <Vva10967> @dccc @abigailgardner @JoyAnnReid @YusefFarrell actually they gained 6 seats in the House.
804094560796364800 2016-11-30 22:47:37 UTC <Vva10967> @ToddCmii In which case I don't get why you're opining on who the Dems elect or not?
804094349755764743 2016-11-30 22:46:46 UTC <Vva10967> @ToddCmii No offense but you should learn to spell. You're sounding like a Trumper.  Maybe you are?
804093966627065859 2016-11-30 22:45:15 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @Chrispydoggy Better than the Bernie fools who cast 3rd party protest votes in MI PA & WI and elected Trump.
804021359642812417 2016-11-30 17:56:44 UTC <Vva10967> @ToddCmii what's the "new blood" going to do? Ryan controls the House for the next 2 years. At least in Senate they can filibuster & block
804020186806448128 2016-11-30 17:52:05 UTC <Vva10967> @ToddCmii at what? she pulls her caucus, fundraises, stands up for progressive values. House doesn't have filibuster or procedural tools.
804015325230596101 2016-11-30 17:32:46 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @kasie @NancyPelosi @TamronMSNBC last time I checked 68% IS more than 2/3, lol. You approach Nancy as you approached Hillary. BAD.
804012557719797760 2016-11-30 17:21:46 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Thank God. I would have lost faith in the Democratic party had Nancy too been pushed aside.

803830040375001089 2016-11-29 05:16:30 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh Hillary is looking good. Attended a Unicef gala honoring Katy Perry.https://twitter.com/joyce_tyler/status/803828308530122752
803828965706203137 2016-11-29 05:12:14 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh it's really hard to tell apart Trumpers from Berners just by looking at their twits.These 2 old white men attracted similar types
803819594662158336 2016-11-29 04:35:00 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh you have more patience than me, lol. She's a Trump troll so I blocked her.  Deplorables will be Deplorables.
803785493053927424 2016-11-29 02:19:29 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost So they're only moving half of the jobs they were going to move? Original number was 2,000.
803783966331457544 2016-11-29 02:13:25 UTC <Vva10967> Of course he won't.  Would have to have ethics to do so. Mitch has none.https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/803760218807078913
803660695527165953 2016-11-29 18:03:35 UTC <Vva10967> @ZackShapiro shouldn't you build one for the Senate also since it is the Senate that confirms the POTUS' Cabinet and not the House?
803654513861267456 2016-11-29 17:39:01 UTC <Vva10967> @JenniferJJacobs @priv8is her family runs a giant shipping empire so even more conflicts of interest there.
803638888115802112 2016-11-29 16:36:56 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost You've omitted from your headline that she's Mitch McConnell's wife. How's that "draining the swamp"???
803636847935000576 2016-11-29 16:28:50 UTC <Vva10967> @Redistrict who are those 40.3%? are they even registered to vote or are you just counting all US citizens over 18 yo?
803635929223086080 2016-11-29 16:25:11 UTC <Vva10967> @StevenTDennis AND she's Mitch McConnell's WIFE.  How's that "draining the swamp"???
803635794560708609 2016-11-29 16:24:38 UTC <Vva10967> @JenniferJJacobs You forgot to mention that she also happens to be Mitch McConnell's WIFE. How's that "draining the swamp"???
803478969936912384 2016-11-28 06:01:29 UTC <Vva10967> @objkshn not true. Each is a separate, publicly-traded company. And his nearest airport may not be serviced by other airlines.

803394006239576064 2016-11-28 00:23:52 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh yeah but Republicans have no conscience and no love of country left. Party comes first for them.
803392075626586112 2016-11-28 00:16:11 UTC <Vva10967> Nop, no landslide. And nop, no mandate either since Hillary is winning the popular vote by over 2.3 million votes. Just an accidental POTUS.https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/803351590342131712

803132599757479936 2016-11-27 07:05:07 UTC <Vva10967> @blakehounshell apparently the "elsewhere" is Alex Jones' InfoWars
803097540178640896 2016-11-27 04:45:49 UTC <Vva10967> @marceelias he's obviously scared. He did tell us that the election would be rigged & he always projects so maybe we'll have a Dec surprise
803096671995498496 2016-11-27 04:42:22 UTC <Vva10967> LOL https://twitter.com/marceelias/status/803071609330397184
803064229771083776 2016-11-27 02:33:27 UTC <Vva10967> @paulkrugman maybe Putin is having buyer's remorse and plans to out him. We'll find out for sure over the next 3 weeks.
803056713007972353 2016-11-27 02:03:35 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh wonder when he'll realize that Hillary's concession isn't binding, lol.  Love seeing you on Joy Reid's show by the way.
803056210656120832 2016-11-27 02:01:35 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh he sounds scared, lol.  Maybe he knows Putin rigged those states for him and will be found out.
803055196691722240 2016-11-27 01:57:33 UTC <Vva10967> @AriBerman does your book list the voter suppression laws in the various states?
803040405344448516 2016-11-27 00:58:47 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews you are failing to mention that his source is Alex Jones' InfoWars. No, I'm not kidding.
803038968342310912 2016-11-27 00:53:04 UTC <Vva10967> The "Hillary Bitches" guy from the Delta flight video has been ID'd. His name is Jamie Finnefrock, lives in PA & works for @RockwellCollins https://twitter.com/yashar/status/803020477509804036
803036605279670272 2016-11-27 00:43:41 UTC <Vva10967> @Reuters maybe you should note that Trump is getting his news on this from Alex Jones' InfoWars.  Bet that'd be newsworthy to most.

802985404106469380 2016-11-27 21:20:13 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn seems that losing the popular vote is getting into his thin skin.

802982695231844352 2016-11-27 21:09:27 UTC <Vva10967> @billmaher that thinking IS what lost us the election.  Berners voted Trump as POTUS to say FU to HRC. For them primary never ended.
802980813449072640 2016-11-27 21:01:59 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn @RocketHamster03 Actually when they do, they vote GOP because they believe all the right wing nonsense about not getting caught.
802980295469318144 2016-11-27 20:59:55 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn Remember that Trump projects. He told us election would be rigged. Now he's telling us that there were millions of illegal votes.
802978260787331072 2016-11-27 20:51:50 UTC <Vva10967> @freedom4all117 The Senate was meant to ensure states got treated equally.  The EC wasn't. The House wasn't either.
802977562683211776 2016-11-27 20:49:04 UTC <Vva10967> @Spkr2theDead that is true now under the Electoral College. The candidates visit only the "swing states" and ignore the rest.
802763953558392832 2016-11-26 06:40:15 UTC <Vva10967> and it's obvious that you (and the Donald) are afraid of the recount.
802761645730709504 2016-11-26 06:31:05 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein because Republicans can only win by cheating? Too afraid of 1 person 1 vote?
802761125859237889 2016-11-26 06:29:01 UTC <Vva10967> We should have taken care of the EC the first time it happened in 2000 with Gore. So our bad. But we can't let it happen again. Compact 2018https://twitter.com/vva10967/status/802720622899957762
802759220605157376 2016-11-26 06:21:27 UTC <Vva10967> @WDFx2EU16 @spacecalls oh look an angry egg!
802757880839553024 2016-11-26 06:16:07 UTC <Vva10967> Were you absent the day Federalist papers were taught?  EC was intended to stop someone like Trump not rubber stamp him. Read # 69.
802756850131275777 2016-11-26 06:12:02 UTC <Vva10967> @spacecalls @WDFx2EU16 Educate yourself: most of that redness is empty land and cows. They don't vote.
802727715690446848 2016-11-26 04:16:16 UTC <Vva10967> @jonlovett she's not terribly different than Comrade Bernie.  I'm surprise he hasn't issued a statement praising Fidel and HIS revolution.
802726340189421568 2016-11-26 04:10:48 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @nytimes was too busy with HRC's emails and Comey's letter to pay attention to Trump's conflicts.
802726013033730048 2016-11-26 04:09:30 UTC <Vva10967> And I seem to recall that he said NO, it shouldn't be accepted unless you yourself win.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802723588759375873
802721326918156288 2016-11-26 03:50:52 UTC <Vva10967> @spacecalls you're confusing the recount/audit petition w the Popular Vote Compact.  The Compact can't happen before 2018 or 2020.
802720622899957762 2016-11-26 03:48:04 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein @spacecalls Nop. Whoever wins the most votes should win the office he/she is running for.
802715244598611969 2016-11-26 03:26:42 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein @spacecalls oh the signing of the compact is for 2020.  States w 165 EC votes have signed, need states with total of 105 more
802711500775424000 2016-11-26 03:11:50 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein Hillary would do it. She was after all the plaintiff in the Citizens United lawsuit. Hell would freeze over before Trump would.
802710898645180416 2016-11-26 03:09:26 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein well we could ALL work to get the Popular Vote Compact signed by sufficient states to reach 270 electoral college votes.
802710443198443520 2016-11-26 03:07:37 UTC <Vva10967> @RobertsDan what assh*les! Both of them. And @BernieSanders isn't even a Democrat and wants to hijack the party. @SpikeLee sounds like a WLB
802707798605856768 2016-11-26 02:57:07 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah LOL. I'm surprised Comrade Bernie hasn't issued a similar statement yet.
802634703455059968 2016-11-26 22:06:40 UTC <Vva10967> @DecisionDeskHQ @EsotericCD but U know, prior 2 this election MSM had lost all credibility from the right. Now you've lost all from the left
802624636039155712 2016-11-26 21:26:39 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem actually I was listening to a 2015 podcast interview of HRC where she's asked what she does to relax and that was her answer
802624148849573888 2016-11-26 21:24:43 UTC <Vva10967> @CornFedIABoy same type. Sams is owned by Walmart. Costco's its own publicly traded company. Bet @mattyglesias would be as happy at SamsClub
802619449891233792 2016-11-26 21:06:03 UTC <Vva10967> HFA's statement announcing their participation in the WI, PA & MI vote recounts. https://medium.com/@marceelias/listening-and-responding-to-calls-for-an-audit-and-recount-2a904717ea39#.b41kyr2o9
802597161036840960 2016-11-26 19:37:29 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias maybe Trump voters don't have Costcos nearby?  LOL. Their problem is that they elect Republicans at state level so remain poor
802596627911475200 2016-11-26 19:35:22 UTC <Vva10967> Yeay! Yes We Can! #StrongerTogether #StillWithHerhttps://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/802552154833698818
802596193935257603 2016-11-26 19:33:38 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro @ahumorlessfem lol, to be fair, she's always said that she hikes with Bill and her dogs to relax. Not a new thing for her.
802591172506058753 2016-11-26 19:13:41 UTC <Vva10967> mmmm, actually Raul Castro has been governing Cuba for the past few years. He's still alive and in power. So not quite there yet.https://twitter.com/mike_pence/status/802557437786066944
802590409348304896 2016-11-26 19:10:39 UTC <Vva10967> @Saberghoff @althaea_flicek @lilithinzion well it could detect if the tallying machines counted the paper ballots correctly.
802400723497406465 2016-11-25 06:36:55 UTC <Vva10967> @Saberghoff true but maybe like the rest of us, she wasn't really expecting Trump to win. Or she could know those states WERE rigged.
802400197276041216 2016-11-25 06:34:49 UTC <Vva10967> @Saberghoff @althaea_flicek well if rigging occurred and HRC won those states, she gets their electoral votes and wins the election.
802397564595212288 2016-11-25 06:24:21 UTC <Vva10967> @MarlonASoto he's making lots of money off it. He'd have made $$$ off paid speeches if he wasn't prohibited by law as Senator/Congressman
802361058606325760 2016-11-25 03:59:18 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias don't be too sure.  Jill's recount could yield a December surprise.  Everything else about election has been "unprecedented"
802360256445771776 2016-11-25 03:56:06 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias @CorinneAM @MarlonASoto You realize that he's doing a BOOK TOUR, right? He signed a contract with his publisher & must do it.
802317035405475840 2016-11-25 01:04:22 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid thanks for always keeping everyone honest!  I can't stand the MSNBC morning lineup where they just let Trump surrogates go on.
802314218930401280 2016-11-25 00:53:10 UTC <Vva10967> @politicususa No Sh*t.  Rachel Maddow and Joy Reid reported on this BEFORE the Election. Rest of media didn't.
802313965204213760 2016-11-25 00:52:10 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra who is the schmuck? a white dude? he needs to look up Sierra Blanca and then revise his opinion as to Bernie's being so pure.
802313283680272384 2016-11-25 00:49:27 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper that bunny in the movie was a bit intense for young kids though
802312060273119232 2016-11-25 00:44:36 UTC <Vva10967> @nytpolitics no, you and rest of MSM made it all about HRC's emails.
802287236947525632 2016-11-25 23:05:57 UTC <Vva10967> @davidegreenwald so what is the difference now in votes between HRC and Trump in WI?
802277169984585729 2016-11-25 22:25:57 UTC <Vva10967> @leahmcelrath I'm pretty sure that Germany CAN regulate hate speech. No 1st Amendment there.
802276849971765248 2016-11-25 22:24:41 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 you underestimate the stupidity of the right. Saw Trump followers on FB arguing Pope had endorsed Trump & Snopes was lying.
802276437973569536 2016-11-25 22:23:03 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @Tim_Glinski Yeah, from Bannon.
802276337352216576 2016-11-25 22:22:39 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure he's not but Bannon is. How do you think he got elected?
802275762627710976 2016-11-25 22:20:22 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @jeffjarvis @fran_the_man apparently Obama wants a "smooth transition" for Trump.  #DemocratsAreWeak
802275152943718400 2016-11-25 22:17:56 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid yes, but the White House apparently told her to stand down bc she might disrupt Trump's transition. #DemocratsAreWeak
802274865780768770 2016-11-25 22:16:48 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid well she's not herself doing the manual recount, she's just the one w/standing willing to contest the counts.
802273093418819584 2016-11-25 22:09:45 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @Bosalto you mean the guy who refuses his daily Presidential briefings? lol. We'll likely get attacked bc he cant pay attention.
802272594376335360 2016-11-25 22:07:46 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @waltb31 Jill has filed, so no scam.
802269974995681280 2016-11-25 21:57:22 UTC <Vva10967> @ByronTau no wonder the guy lost the election.  Amazing that was the best Dems could do back then.

802267953487982593 2016-11-25 21:49:20 UTC <Vva10967> @sahilkapur not to rub it in, but perhaps if you all had spent less time on HRC's emails and more on real reporting you would have caught it

802210311612796928 2016-11-25 18:00:17 UTC <Vva10967> @KPhed yeah but the experts also felt that Trump couldn't win and here we are. Dems don't like to rock the boat, they lack a spine.
802209156526731264 2016-11-25 17:55:41 UTC <Vva10967> @greenhousenyt I thought Trump's slogan was to Drain the Swamp, not fill it up?

802196707979182080 2016-11-25 17:06:13 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias she DID talk about electrical grid infrastructure. I think it went over people's heads. Maybe she should've used talking cats?
802196349122965504 2016-11-25 17:04:48 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias do U seriously think rural America understands antitrust laws & policy? Same people that bought his Only I Can Fix It? & MAGA?

802183919877636096 2016-11-25 16:15:25 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost yet only media 2 report it PRIOR to Election was Samantha Bee's Full Frontal. Real media all failed. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OauLuWXD_RI

802181658560655360 2016-11-25 16:06:25 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Take a look at Full Frontal's report on this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OauLuWXD_RI
802178308712566784 2016-11-25 15:53:07 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid and only one to report it in real time was Samantha Bee's Full Frontal. MSM ignored it, maybe assumed she was joking.
802177929346240516 2016-11-25 15:51:36 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro Only media 2 report this was @iamsambee's Full Frontal. Real MSM failed miserably. @nytimes @CNN @MSNBC were too busy w emails.

802176364031918084 2016-11-25 15:45:23 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @PoliticsWolf bring into question if Senate wins were legit or not in WI & PA and maybe also NC and FL.

801815744115867648 2016-11-24 15:52:25 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure The hate of the Far Left 4 Hillary elected him. He got less than 46% of the votes cast. Would not have been enough. Hate Trumped Love
801813653838295044 2016-11-24 15:44:06 UTC <Vva10967> @rtraister but it is. Trump won EC thanks to 110,000 Berners voting 3rd party in MI PA & WI to say FU to Hillary. Our Far Left elected him.
801648607430582272 2016-11-23 04:48:16 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden @david_stoops Not if it was the result of cheating. Trump KNEW it'd be rigged, he projects, so there's more to it.

801635773959311360 2016-11-23 03:57:16 UTC <Vva10967> @robreiner Republicans have become the Party of Trump.  They lack moral courage by definition. So no.
801635445981507584 2016-11-23 03:55:58 UTC <Vva10967> @johnpodesta please request the MI WI & PA recount. The damage Trump will do will be irreversible. Ignore the White House. They're 2 passive
801634622895484928 2016-11-23 03:52:42 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden if White House is telling Hillary NOT to request the recount, she should IGNORE THEM. We NEED the recount. She's our President.
801634283957977088 2016-11-23 03:51:21 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden why won't @HillaryClinton request the recount if it's as cheap as Jill Stein says? We'll never recover from a Trump presidency!
801484814968901632 2016-11-23 17:57:25 UTC <Vva10967> @nifkinjuice and the damage done by W to world peace proved to be irreversible. People need to own the consequences of their votes.
801484358947373057 2016-11-23 17:55:36 UTC <Vva10967> @nifkinjuice and union members will now get screwed by Trump when he appoints the NLRB members. And no, low skill manuf'g isn't coming back
801483991161438208 2016-11-23 17:54:09 UTC <Vva10967> @nifkinjuice You can now trace her loss to 55,000 third party votes COMBINED in MI WI & PA. Berners were even trading protest votes on FB.
801483337344962560 2016-11-23 17:51:33 UTC <Vva10967> @nifkinjuice I'm looking at the raw numbers. Facts matter. Berners elected Trump. Trump voters didn't.
801482888118206465 2016-11-23 17:49:46 UTC <Vva10967> @nifkinjuice she didn't expect Berners in MI PA & WI to vote 3rd party just to say FU to her. Thought their love of country would prevail.

801174142460383233 2016-11-22 21:22:55 UTC <Vva10967> @ElectProject one more Q, since FL has certified its vote count, can you still have a recount of Broward & Miami Dade or is that precluded?
801173719020355588 2016-11-22 21:21:14 UTC <Vva10967> @ElectProject can you clarify? I don't follow you here.
801172541498949632 2016-11-22 21:16:33 UTC <Vva10967> @ElectProject but in PA any 3 citizens of the county can trigger a recount in their county, correct? And where is Michigan in its counting?

800912304590069760 2016-11-21 04:02:28 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs the difference was the Berners voting third party in MI PA & WI to say FU to Hillary.  THEY elected Trump, not his own supporters.
800911373052084224 2016-11-21 03:58:46 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh yeah but we lost the election due to 110,000 Berners voting 3rd party in MI PA & WI, NOT due to Trump's own supporters #truth

800521934672982016 2016-11-20 02:11:16 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid looks like CBS was shamed, they removed the false tweet.

800510059528658946 2016-11-20 01:24:05 UTC <Vva10967> Question is, will the Republicans go along? Doubt it but you never know.https://twitter.com/RealMuckmaker/status/800458592788905984

800208967720910848 2016-11-19 05:27:39 UTC <Vva10967> @Luvs2Laff6 @JoyAnnReid @aaamanda Comey broke DOJ rules & Precedent when he did his July press conference.

800204971312615424 2016-11-19 05:11:46 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid this @cuntlorrd account looks like a Russian troll account. You may want to block it. I am.
800110704128884736 2016-11-19 22:57:11 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid saw a Trump voter arguing on FB that the Pope had endorsed Trump & that Snopes was lying when it said that was false!
800106409102868480 2016-11-19 22:40:07 UTC <Vva10967> @OnlyWhiteTiger it sure feels that way every time I watch the news.  I end up feeling nauseous listening to his vile cabinet picks.
800105564818771969 2016-11-19 22:36:46 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT read this thread. You too should talk to W's ethics lawyer about how his DC hotel will make him violate US Constitution on day 1https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/800072169632002048
800104900596273152 2016-11-19 22:34:08 UTC <Vva10967> @jonlovett @Soulo_Guero would be ironic when Comey was the AG that put Martha in jail.
800103764598390784 2016-11-19 22:29:37 UTC <Vva10967> @SenatorSchumer @SenSanders @SenWarren I'm sure you read the news but in case you've missed this.https://twitter.com/AJentleson/status/800004432897261568
800102855277445120 2016-11-19 22:26:00 UTC <Vva10967> @JuddLegum who would impeach him? McConnell & Ryan?  AG Sessions?
800046288171479040 2016-11-19 18:41:13 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller on the contrary, EC is supposed to prevent someone like Trump from becoming POTUS.  Read Federalist Paper 68.
800045803482005504 2016-11-19 18:39:18 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller @tjdva @WonderWoman934 @UDbmas @OnlyWhiteTiger in this case, it looks like they won the war.
800045606928580609 2016-11-19 18:38:31 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller but is anyone investigating the hacking? could vote tallying machines have been hacked in FL PA WI MI or NC?
800045092543361028 2016-11-19 18:36:28 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller who would normally do the disqualifying? the media?
800043790144770049 2016-11-19 18:31:18 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @SenSanders YOUR followers voted Trump in because you slandered Hillary wrt the speeches & donations. You knew you were lyinghttps://twitter.com/matteroffacttv/status/800039691605123072
800042013152411648 2016-11-19 18:24:14 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro it's actually a distraction from the media covering the Trump University $25 Million settlement.
800016562916835328 2016-11-19 16:43:06 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @AriBerman could these voters w/o ID have cast provisional ballots? did they know that? do we know if some did? has WI finished tallying?
800016164147658752 2016-11-19 16:41:31 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @AriBerman wasn't there a court order requiring WI to issue the IDs? who was the plaintiff in that lawsuit?
800014471838179328 2016-11-19 16:34:48 UTC <Vva10967> @AriBerman would your book cover which states have enacted voter suppression laws since SCOTUS gutted VRA? Couldn't tell from TOC. Thanks.
800013900771184640 2016-11-19 16:32:32 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @MalcolmNance and if so, who investigates that? consequences are too dire to let Russia win here
800013684948996096 2016-11-19 16:31:40 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @MalcolmNance is it possible that the voter tally machines in FL NC PA MI or WI were compromised? FL vote didn't match polls + early
800012898261155840 2016-11-19 16:28:33 UTC <Vva10967> @MalcolmNance why is Clapper resigning & not investigating Trump's communications w & ties to Russia during campaign?
799844745874907136 2016-11-18 05:20:22 UTC <Vva10967> And Hillary was supposed to appeal to these people? Seriously?https://twitter.com/KagroX/status/799834547756158976
799844113625608192 2016-11-18 05:17:51 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT they're reaping what they sowed.  Get used to it.
799822906998030336 2016-11-18 03:53:35 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs Bernie contradicts himself. One day he calls Trump an ally, the next he says he'll fight back. Dems need to learn from McConnell.
799821127912722432 2016-11-18 03:46:31 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs maybe Obama should have invited that fool to the White House after he won GOP primary and showed him what being POTUS entailed.
799820376209559553 2016-11-18 03:43:32 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro Maybe @mike_pence should read Hamilton in Federalist Paper #68, bet he'd find his thoughts about role of EC interesting.
799812693515440128 2016-11-18 03:13:00 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro I have to wonder if Trump didn't just bring him in to tease & humiliate him as payback. Guess we'll see.
799781850810122240 2016-11-18 01:10:27 UTC <Vva10967> @johnpodesta surely your team has looked into this possibility, no? Trump projects & told us election WOULD be rigged.Maybe Russia told him?https://twitter.com/Vva10967/status/799770995741655040
799781521896996867 2016-11-18 01:09:08 UTC <Vva10967> @yottapoint because it detracts from his Political Revolution/class warfare message

799775298841677824 2016-11-18 00:44:25 UTC <Vva10967> @johnpodesta could Trump have known Russia would hack some voting machines since he always projects & did say election was going tb rigged?https://twitter.com/AlexMohajer/status/799017677545086976
799772335364575232 2016-11-18 00:32:38 UTC <Vva10967> whatever happened to Trump's claim that he gets the best people???https://twitter.com/voxdotcom/status/799646030870429696
799771751433572356 2016-11-18 00:30:19 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @LawrenceHughes Trump has projected the entire election & was saying that the election was going to be rigged. Maybe he knew it?
799770995741655040 2016-11-18 00:27:19 UTC <Vva10967> Youre not just imagining it: the Hillary Clinton vs Donald Trump vote totals do look rigged http://www.palmerreport.com/opinion/youre-not-just-imagining-it-the-hillary-clinton-vs-donald-trump-vote-totals-do-look-rigged/104/
799765719751819264 2016-11-18 00:06:21 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro wow, maybe you should send a copy to @marcorubio
799743047185465344 2016-11-18 22:36:15 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid maybe Obama will give him a call to keep him from signing it.
799742164775403525 2016-11-18 22:32:45 UTC <Vva10967> @SenatorSchumer @SenatorReid @SenSanders "Not sure" is being kind here.https://twitter.com/SimonWDC/status/799599885087633408
799739423021744136 2016-11-18 22:21:51 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure how so? Because WWC hate powerful women? If Dems go that route they're going to lose progressive women from their coalition.
799738583477166080 2016-11-18 22:18:31 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 he should just switch parties, lol.
799737713486245890 2016-11-18 22:15:03 UTC <Vva10967> @KellieThomas8 Hope you enjoy the next 4 years of President Trump and AG Jeff Sessions who'll put BLM in terrorist org list. Should be fun.
799726763974782977 2016-11-18 21:31:33 UTC <Vva10967> @noamscheiber actually no, BernieBusters voting for Gary in those states account for it.  His voters didn't elect him, Bernie's did.

799351573382070272 2016-11-17 20:40:40 UTC <Vva10967> @PoliticsWolf why should she step down? She was the most effective speaker ever & position has no power if GOP is in control.
799351046137118721 2016-11-17 20:38:35 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamParkhomenko let's hope so.
799349993484283905 2016-11-17 20:34:24 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald it's about race and misogyny, WWC not liking to have a black man or a woman as POTUS.
799349149195964416 2016-11-17 20:31:03 UTC <Vva10967> @ZacFellows1 difference is our party cares, GOP doesn't. Maybe you should join GOP since you obviously wouldn't care?

799330434924576770 2016-11-17 19:16:41 UTC <Vva10967> @ZacFellows1 you mean the guy who wrote that women fantasize about being raped by 3 men? & that children should touch each other's genitalia
799138196357607424 2016-11-16 06:32:47 UTC <Vva10967> @chrsdcook you did & should own it. Facts matter but then again Berners sucked at math in primary. Hope you enjoy next 4 yrs of Trump.
799137579236990976 2016-11-16 06:30:20 UTC <Vva10967> @chrsdcook no he slandered her. And had been the nominee we would have president Bloomberg which I suppose is better than President Trump
799136914733404160 2016-11-16 06:27:42 UTC <Vva10967> @chrsdcook she won the popular vote by over 2 million. You Berners screwed us and the world with your hate. You don't deserve ANY reward.
799136007778140160 2016-11-16 06:24:06 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn @AP @STL_Blonde no CA has close to 4 million left to count.

799130527685025793 2016-11-16 06:02:19 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @carolhoernlein and the 110,000 Berners who voted for Gary in MI PA & WI just to say FU to Hillary elected Trump
799126479623880704 2016-11-16 05:46:14 UTC <Vva10967> @UniNoticias el no, sino los 110,000 burros seguidores de Bernie que votaron por Gary en MI PA y WI dandole el triunfo a Trump
799055659929059328 2016-11-16 01:04:49 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra to Sanders EVERYTHING is about class warfare and he's stuck in 2008 obsessed with breaking up the banks.
799055417536106496 2016-11-16 01:03:51 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra they were too privileged to care that Trump election would validate hate & bigotry & misogyny.
799054991998730245 2016-11-16 01:02:10 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra his followers lost us the election by casting 110,000 3rd party protest votes for Gary in MI, PA & WI because they hate HRC.
799044800741863425 2016-11-16 00:21:40 UTC <Vva10967> @jess_mc @allinwithchris @jason_w_simmons when Warren ran 4 Senator, the media covered her the same way they covered Hillary, as inauthentic
799022760634830862 2016-11-16 22:54:05 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @ZacFellows1 So he damaged her in the primary and never walked it back.  Also dragged primary saying it was rigged.
799022493310865418 2016-11-16 22:53:02 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @ZacFellows1 which 2 me suggests she's dishonest & doesn't believe what she's saying if HE says she has to be held  accountable
799022090074685441 2016-11-16 22:51:26 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @ZacFellows1 and his stump speech was more against Trump than FOR Hillary and focused on holding her accountable post Nov 9
799021820410261508 2016-11-16 22:50:21 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @ZacFellows1 he never told his followers that he had LIED when he told them she was a corporate sellout.
799021117126090752 2016-11-16 22:47:34 UTC <Vva10967> @ProgBlacksmith if we wanted someone who didn't advance fracking, we should have chosen HRC over Hope & Change. We didn't. So fracking rules
799020579844214784 2016-11-16 22:45:25 UTC <Vva10967> @ProgBlacksmith the Sec of State & the rest of the President's cabinet advances the POTUS' agenda, not their own. He was always pro-fracking
798790272364617729 2016-11-15 07:30:16 UTC <Vva10967> @MilesPerHoward @ahumorlessfem few people remember that Obama was pro-fracking while she was against it in the 2008 primary.
798783879070920706 2016-11-15 07:04:52 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra @ZacFellows1 actually we didn't bet it. Bernie Busters did by casting 110,000 3rd party votes in MI PA & WI to get even at HRC.
798782948283555840 2016-11-15 07:01:10 UTC <Vva10967> Her final total of votes in the primary was 16.9 million.  California just took the full month to count its votes.https://twitter.com/Andabeat/status/798775382929391616
798782461559701504 2016-11-15 06:59:14 UTC <Vva10967> and he'll be defeated in the primary, lol.  And yes, it will be a HE because they'll also assume that a woman can't win.https://twitter.com/YarmondShore/status/798780645744857089
798782077143351296 2016-11-15 06:57:42 UTC <Vva10967> @smoothkobra HRC has stood up for what's right her entire life. In 1999 &  2000 she stood w families of 2 unarmed black men killed by NYPD.
798777869786759169 2016-11-15 06:40:59 UTC <Vva10967> This is how I feel too.  We need to get rid of the Electoral College, NOT change our values and what we stand for in order to cater to WWC.https://twitter.com/smoothkobra/status/798753828640129025
798775469113888768 2016-11-15 06:31:27 UTC <Vva10967> @mckaycoppins a little too late or is it because they think that now that Trump's election has validated bullying it will only get worse?
798774197908426752 2016-11-15 06:26:23 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost some idiots are going to be VERY disappointed when they finally realize that they've been conned.
798773603281973248 2016-11-15 06:24:02 UTC <Vva10967> @markos @stretchdogg I still remember when in 1990s Republicans were livid because Bill Clinton delegated healthcare to Hillary.
798773094361931776 2016-11-15 06:22:00 UTC <Vva10967> @markos someone should tell SIL that it takes brainy Obama 6 hrs to just read them in the PM & he'll have to then explain them to Trump.
798768532435517441 2016-11-15 06:03:53 UTC <Vva10967> @markos wonder if Obama has told him yet about the thick binders he gets after dinner which take him from 8pm to 2am to read.
798767550158905345 2016-11-15 05:59:58 UTC <Vva10967> @markos @KatyTurNBC Press destroyed Hillary's campaign w/ email "scandal" & their "she's so untrustworthy & dislikable" nonsense it's KARMA.
798762772024569857 2016-11-15 05:40:59 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 and we need to get the Popular Vote Compact signed by states with 270 EC Votes.  The MAJORITY of the VOTERS agreed with HRC.
798689677989543936 2016-11-15 00:50:32 UTC <Vva10967> Thank you @SenatorReid for now bowing down to Trump.
798688712058085376 2016-11-15 00:46:42 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports Congrats Andrea! You all fought really hard 2 get him elected.The guy has attention deficit disorder & can't read briefings
798664728893493249 2016-11-15 23:11:24 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou and she stood up for Marriage Equality too.She stood up for inclusion and 4 OUR values & any call to compromise on those is wrong
798664363619938304 2016-11-15 23:09:57 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou she also had the guts to stand up with and for the Mothers of the Movement which not even Obama has done.
798663916784066560 2016-11-15 23:08:10 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou me too. She had the guts to stand up 4 the Dreamers & the children born here who fear their undocumented parents will be deported
798663313508986880 2016-11-15 23:05:47 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou & I consider each & every Bernie Supporter who cast a protest vote in MI, PA & WI to get even at Hillary a TRAITOR 2 this country
798661356534673408 2016-11-15 22:58:00 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @Lawrence @chrislhayes @amjoyshow @JoyAnnReid  Can MSNBC PLEASE cover this? We all need a respite from the Trump nightmare. Thanks.https://twitter.com/danmericaCNN/status/798358476258938881
798659262448857088 2016-11-15 22:49:41 UTC <Vva10967> A little too late.And his dad, Bush Sr., negotiated and signed it.  Bill Clinton signed it AFTER it was ratified by Congress a year laterhttps://twitter.com/WSJ/status/798655831768174592
798657861706514432 2016-11-15 22:44:07 UTC <Vva10967> Hope White Working Class Americans will go pick up our fruits & veggies in the fields or we'll have a food shortage after mass deportations!https://twitter.com/UniNoticias/status/798650557065900032
798656830121512961 2016-11-15 22:40:01 UTC <Vva10967> 2 @BenLaBolt & that's NOT who WE R nor who a MAJORITY of voters R. Had Bernie protest voters not screwed us in MI, PA & WI HRC would be Pres
798656103613612032 2016-11-15 22:37:08 UTC <Vva10967> 1 @BenLaBolt but we shouldn't overlook that we lost against a white nationalist campaign that appealed 2 WWC's fear of muslims, BLM & LGBTs.
798655044128116736 2016-11-15 22:32:55 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller why won't @LorettaLynch & @SallyQYates appoint Special Prosecutor to investigate Trump & Russians contact during election?
798654395978104832 2016-11-15 22:30:20 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 getting the popular vote compact signed is easier & even then we need to 1st get the legislatures & governorships to reach 270
798652770769338368 2016-11-15 22:23:53 UTC <Vva10967> @edgoist your numbers are outdated.  Butrise in Other is the protest vote against HRC.The Republicans came home & voted 4 their racist king.
798652226700910592 2016-11-15 22:21:43 UTC <Vva10967> @antmay @kurteichenwald @JulieSelf right, the ones who voted third party are much worse.
798651386036531200 2016-11-15 22:18:23 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald @Twizznit nop, 110,000 flipped PA, WI & MI.  That was it.  The blue wall.
798651193866252290 2016-11-15 22:17:37 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald definitely protest voters.
798433116696285184 2016-11-14 07:51:03 UTC <Vva10967> @MarkMorley5 @joanwalsh but was embraced by a majority of the voters. The ELectoral College just got in the way.
798426658227286016 2016-11-14 07:25:24 UTC <Vva10967> @NBCNews @JoyAnnReid will Trump be able to overrule them?
798424527193653248 2016-11-14 07:16:55 UTC <Vva10967> @will_knox lol I know. SHE sound like a Republican running as a Democrat. Berners like her bc she endorsed him.
798327227020673024 2016-11-14 00:50:17 UTC <Vva10967> @will_knox the GOP voters came home.  Party loyalty for them is so strong they voted for racist sexual predator who is unfit for office.
798326799453319168 2016-11-14 00:48:35 UTC <Vva10967> @will_knox Nop.  Cornell Belcher tracked Gary's increase to Clinton's decrease in Michigan & PA. WI had voter ID suppression, 300,000.
798325343388045312 2016-11-14 00:42:48 UTC <Vva10967> No folks, the Democratic Party cannot reach the whites that voted for Trump.  Just cannot.  We live in 2 different worlds.https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/798314593659613184

798322149756981249 2016-11-14 00:30:07 UTC <Vva10967> @DrJillStein @will_knox Frankly, I feel the same way as Kurt Eichenwald does in this article:http://bit.ly/2fSQAEH
798321861222400000 2016-11-14 00:28:58 UTC <Vva10967> @Ontheotherhand @SocialPowerOne1 most came over, but the Bernie Bust didn't & they're as vindictive & vicious as the GOP's Tea Party.
798320736331042816 2016-11-14 00:24:30 UTC <Vva10967> @Haunsie @Ontheotherhand Here, read this: http://bit.ly/2fSQAEH
798293785432166400 2016-11-14 22:37:24 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders too bad 110,000 of your followers in MI, PA & WI thought it was more important to say FU to HRC than to save the planet.
798292673505427456 2016-11-14 22:32:59 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @cbouzy No, math says otherwise.  The disgruntled Bernie voters wanted to say FU to her and they've fucked the country instead.
798292444039315456 2016-11-14 22:32:04 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @cbouzy seems that the RESULT of the election is now galvanizing them, now that it is too late and the damage can't be undone.
798292023589490688 2016-11-14 22:30:24 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @cbouzy she got overwhelming support from blacks and latinos, except for millenials who wanted to avenge Bernie's honor.
798291663307362312 2016-11-14 22:28:58 UTC <Vva10967> @sivadavi8 He lost by over 2 MILLION votes. He won the electoral college because 110,000 of our voters were entitled Bernie pricks.
798291350336589827 2016-11-14 22:27:44 UTC <Vva10967> @sivadavi8 I do, and also understand motives and how evil those voters were.  They put millions of people & vulnerable communities at risk.
798290804573925376 2016-11-14 22:25:33 UTC <Vva10967> @Ontheotherhand So maybe DNC screwed us all by letting Bernie run and slander Hillary during the primary.
798290617466060800 2016-11-14 22:24:49 UTC <Vva10967> @Ontheotherhand DNC and DWS actually ALLOWED Bernie to run as a Dem, which he isn't.  He'd never gotten ANY media attention as Independent.
798290407851511808 2016-11-14 22:23:59 UTC <Vva10967> @Ontheotherhand No, the 110,000 pricks who voted 3rd party instead of backing the Dem ticket are. She got 4 million more votes than Bernie.
798290101948321792 2016-11-14 22:22:46 UTC <Vva10967> @will_knox she's been a progressive her entire life, even to left of Obama. Her agenda was extremely progressive. You wanted a MAN.
798289190026768384 2016-11-14 22:19:09 UTC <Vva10967> @keithellison who votes for DNC chair?
798288907754356736 2016-11-14 22:18:01 UTC <Vva10967> @keithellison we need united Dem party that respects result of primary in 2020 & backs the candidate no matter what. Make Supers nonvoting.
798288420753707008 2016-11-14 22:16:05 UTC <Vva10967> @keithellison can DNC PLEASE make Supers non-voting so we avoid the in-fighting that occurs when the loser blames his loss on the Supers?
798287478901866496 2016-11-14 22:12:21 UTC <Vva10967> @oneunderscore__ Trump's followers will believe ANYTHING.  They swear the Pope endorsed Trump & that Snopes is "biased" in denying it.
798286680625057792 2016-11-14 22:09:10 UTC <Vva10967> @will_knox so Hillary capitulating to Bernie's demands wasn't enough?
798286343390498817 2016-11-14 22:07:50 UTC <Vva10967> @LauriLinnea @angryandliberal HE SLANDERED her and never walked it back. And he KNEW BETTER even if his followers believed his lies.
798285897628352512 2016-11-14 22:06:04 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @angryandliberal 110,000 Berners chose to vote third party in MI PA & WI to screw Hillary and now we're all screwed.
798284011235930112 2016-11-14 21:58:34 UTC <Vva10967> Maybe the media should remind folks who Bolton is? Remember that interviews show Americans barely know who the VP is.
798253440099057664 2016-11-14 19:57:05 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @cbouzy she HAD a message, one of inclusion.  Maybe it didn't appeal to you because you're too white and male?

798080172025122816 2016-11-14 08:28:35 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @suebell49 you also cannot reward the Berners who lost us the election with their vindictive third party votes in FL MI PA & WI
798079569727254529 2016-11-14 08:26:11 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @truecolossus no it's about party loyalty. GOP came home. We got screwed by vindictive Berners voting third party.
798078919001964544 2016-11-14 08:23:36 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @cbouzy NO we lost because Hateful Berners voted 3rd party in FL MI PA & FL 2 screw Hillary as payback 4 defeat'g their Saviour
798077933256642560 2016-11-14 08:19:41 UTC <Vva10967> @krystalball @tonic516 Obama wouldn't want to. He's doing project with Eric Holder to rebuild party & get back governorships & legislatures
798077434293813249 2016-11-14 08:17:42 UTC <Vva10967> @RepTimRyan @krystalball @crl_fitzpatrick that's a good idea. Is Kasich term limited? OH went 4 Trump so he may get backlash 4 his bravery
798076684083859458 2016-11-14 08:14:43 UTC <Vva10967> @RepTimRyan @krystalball why? House Leader's job is to keep caucus together for votes. Nancy is excellent at it. You're thinking DNC Chair.

798073810276745216 2016-11-14 08:03:18 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn and maybe Berners who voted third party lied to pollsters on purpose? They are a bitter vindictive bunch.
798072893083095040 2016-11-13 07:59:39 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn maybe Trump voters were too embarrassed to tell pollsters they were voting for the sexual predator?

798061096166768640 2016-11-13 07:12:47 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller why wouldn't DOJ appoint a Special Prosecutor? why are @LorettaLynch and @SallyQYates acting so weak? Comey can't be trusted
798059947997040640 2016-11-13 07:08:13 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @AmLawAlumBR that voted third party in FL MI PA & WI that lost us the election. Trump voters didn't elect him, Bernie Dems did.
798059709534117890 2016-11-13 07:07:16 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @AmLawAlumBR Biden would NOT have fared better because he would have beat Bernie in the primary and it was the disgruntled Bernie Bros
798057845031698434 2016-11-13 06:59:52 UTC <Vva10967> Hey @davidaxelrod you've been spending so much time at CNN that you are now normalizing Trump.  Kasich staffer isn't. Learn from him.https://twitter.com/JWGOP/status/797918770136117248
798057067554578432 2016-11-13 06:56:46 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Obama is going to try to keep him from blowing up the world & NATO & from going after muslims and undocumented immigrants.
798054830925234177 2016-11-13 06:47:53 UTC <Vva10967> @BenjySarlin Thanks for not normalizing this as other media has.  Maybe going forward you should include in parens what Alt-Right is?
798053775164473344 2016-11-13 06:43:41 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @MikeJKeenan @AmLawAlumBR taken votes from both.  Sanders would also have ran on raising taxes on EVERYONE. Voters don't like that.
798045393132998656 2016-11-13 06:10:23 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh looks like the Bernie Bros are back.  I suggest you block MikeJKeenan

797947977931386880 2016-11-13 23:43:17 UTC <Vva10967> 5. @ianwilrel8 most low income whites went with Hillary. It wasn't about income, it was darker. But third party vote gave victory to Trump.
797947652482727936 2016-11-13 23:42:00 UTC <Vva10967> 4. @ianwilrel8 Trump voters also rejected Liberalism & would have rejected Bernie & would have worried about him raising taxes on everyone.

797947005909639168 2016-11-13 23:39:26 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @ianwilrel8 if Bernie had run against Trump, Mike Bloomberg would have entered the race and would have pulled from both Bernie & Trump.
797946615499616256 2016-11-13 23:37:52 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @ianwilrel8 he did not.  Media played you. Hillary had a 17 MM loyal voter following in 2008 and 16 MM showed up to back her in 2016.
797945350053130240 2016-11-13 23:32:51 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald he thinks it's a Monday to Friday job too, maybe 9 to 5 too? Let's hope ISIS doesn't decide to attack us on a weekend.
797944847768260608 2016-11-13 23:30:51 UTC <Vva10967> Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania & Ohio, you won't be getting back those coal jobs that you were promised. Suckers!https://twitter.com/kurteichenwald/status/797933360513359873
797944201614741505 2016-11-13 23:28:17 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh thanks for saying it.  Two questions who votes for DNC Chairman?  Who decides if DNC will have Super Delegates?
797943674860609536 2016-11-13 23:26:11 UTC <Vva10967> @ianwilrel8 & she didn't "steal" his message, HE negotiated w/her to adopt his message so she'd implement it as POTUS. But you elected Trump
797942933622169600 2016-11-13 23:23:15 UTC <Vva10967> @crooksandliars @joanwalsh @ianwilrel8 OMG, MSNBC would show his ENTIRE rallies and not bother to cover Hillary's smaller events.
797941975949443072 2016-11-13 23:19:26 UTC <Vva10967> @kurteichenwald Florida will likely see a drop in tourism since Europeans, Canadians & Latin Americans will repudiate us.
797924816766398465 2016-11-13 22:11:15 UTC <Vva10967> @HuffPostPol the media better cover it and not give him a free pass again.
797914625220243457 2016-11-13 21:30:45 UTC <Vva10967> appreciate it, THANK YOU!
797903028808355840 2016-11-13 20:44:41 UTC <Vva10967> do you have the article/source for this warning? Thanks!
797880792449826817 2016-11-13 19:16:19 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid thank you. I can't stand the self-entitled Bernie pricks who voted for Jill & Gary because they wanted Hillary to fail.
797880020144246784 2016-11-13 19:13:15 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Republicans always come home, Dems do not, they in-fight. In 2014 they threw POTUS under the bus to cater to GOP voters & failed
797711931335385088 2016-11-13 08:05:19 UTC <Vva10967> @PensiveTM so are you saying that you are a Deplorable?
797708526038773764 2016-11-12 07:51:47 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid and you got pundits & media saying it was about economic anxiety.  Please!
797642602354999296 2016-11-12 03:29:50 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @MattMurph24 @WEMESQ yes but their anger is culture-driven, not economics & we can't cater to that without losing our values.
797641444756455424 2016-11-12 03:25:14 UTC <Vva10967> @northmiami you obviously don't have very many friends in rural America & MW. Go look at Dear Liberals trend & you'll see that Yes They Can.
797629185326022658 2016-11-12 02:36:31 UTC <Vva10967> @chucktodd right she should have blamed you all, the MSM for blowing the email story out of proportion & into a scandal
797614445480542208 2016-11-12 01:37:57 UTC <Vva10967> Media MUST cover this story more, re Trump's ties to Russia. @JoyAnnReid @maddow @kurteichenwald @jonfavs @Lawrence @jaketapper @60Minuteshttps://twitter.com/Vva10967/status/797613278105051136
797613278105051136 2016-11-12 01:33:19 UTC <Vva10967> OMG! This petition on WH web 2 investigate Trump's ties to Russia got hacked this PM. Had 1000's of signatures. http://bit.ly/2eTbZOD
797612490343518209 2016-11-12 01:30:11 UTC <Vva10967> And this guy will be the champion of vets? C'mon Man!https://twitter.com/KevinDarryl/status/797570843563986946
797610561689309185 2016-11-12 01:22:31 UTC <Vva10967> OMG, Trump thinks that being POTUS is a Mon to Fri job & plans to spend weekends golfing in NYC or at Mar A Lago!  http://nyti.ms/2eq5BzC
797581507388968960 2016-11-12 23:27:04 UTC <Vva10967> @tinyyellowcandy it's certainly the fault of the Bernie crats that voted third party in FL, MI, PA & WI bc they didn't give a f*ck about POC
797580880462180353 2016-11-12 23:24:34 UTC <Vva10967> @tinyyellowcandy they did but weren't counting on backstabber Bernie crats in FL, MI, PA & WI. Aren't you a Republican anyway? or a Berner?
797580262318231552 2016-11-12 23:22:07 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro @philnorman exactly. Shows I used to love now make me nauseus since they remind me of our new reality.
797579695609053185 2016-11-12 23:19:52 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro he just forgot his own advice the minute McConnell said otherwise.
797578487951458304 2016-11-12 23:15:04 UTC <Vva10967> @thepacketrat # of electors per state is based on 2 senators + number of house members, which is why minimum is 3.
797578060426084352 2016-11-12 23:13:22 UTC <Vva10967> @deray @Sernett @thepacketrat it does NOT go to Congress if someone gets 270 or more.
797577389119307776 2016-11-12 23:10:42 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidOAtkins not unless she moved center right. Those voters rejected liberalism, poltical correctness, inclusiveness, etc not just Hillary
797576709805658112 2016-11-12 23:08:00 UTC <Vva10967> @JasonKander @TVMoJoe not a bad idea...
797574210889666564 2016-11-12 22:58:04 UTC <Vva10967> @VirgPatriot out of curiosity, how do you feel about muslims and the muslim ban? about the wall & the mass deportations?
797574065263349761 2016-11-12 22:57:30 UTC <Vva10967> @VirgPatriot you realize you're proving my point?  lol. We won't compromise on our core values so elections are really tribal contests now.
797573410029240320 2016-11-12 22:54:53 UTC <Vva10967> @LRoehnelt @VirgPatriot It is. CA is huge, blue and has > 4.5 million ballots to count.  WA has >700,000.
797572858058772480 2016-11-12 22:52:42 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @bill22204 @RoofBob We have nothing in common with people who believe Trump & what he stands for are okay. So yes, it's us and they.
797572320202199041 2016-11-12 22:50:33 UTC <Vva10967> 4. @Toure not to mention that if it had been Trump vs Sanders, Mike Bloomberg would have entered the race too & pulled from both.
797571986465681408 2016-11-12 22:49:14 UTC <Vva10967> 3. @Toure AND his emails would have been hacked by the Russians too and put on WikiLeaks if he had gotten any traction.
797571454112038912 2016-11-12 22:47:07 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @tinyyellowcandy then you didn't listen to her policies & message. Now you're stuck with Trump & the hate his election legitimized.
797570938808258560 2016-11-12 22:45:04 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @tinyyellowcandy her strategy of holding small events was misguided. She could have filled large venues had she dared to do it.
797567155583799296 2016-11-12 22:30:02 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @bill22204 @RoofBob it did, but the BLM movement developed after the 2012 election. Same with Marriage Equality. They reject both.
797565933413892096 2016-11-12 22:25:11 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @con2ken In other words, it's not just Hillary that they rejected, is the liberal values that she stands for that they abhor.
797565639657476096 2016-11-12 22:24:01 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @con2ken but it's true.  Look at the Dear Liberals trend on Twitter. They hate our values. And it's been true on FB as well.
797565214673829893 2016-11-12 22:22:19 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @MelodyWyles I agree but if we lost the midwest & rural America over OUR core values, I don't see how Hillary is to blame for it.
797560332667461632 2016-11-12 22:02:55 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @bill22204 they don't think they're giving up anything because they believe his slogans. Reality will eventually hit them.
797560124319666176 2016-11-12 22:02:06 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @AmirRagui a lot has changed since 2012. Marriage Equality & BLM are the biggest changes & they're rejecting the changes.
797559581601857536 2016-11-12 21:59:56 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @spyBUDDHA agreed.
797559463712620545 2016-11-12 21:59:28 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure @roselaura100 but they don't view it that way. They think they are saying FU to liberals. Maybe they're too priviledged to care.
797558954448584704 2016-11-12 21:57:27 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure and those are irreconcilable differences.
797558657823150080 2016-11-12 21:56:16 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure Look at the Dear Liberals trend on Twitter. Trump voters mock our liberal values & political correctness. That's what angers them.
797557938902749184 2016-11-12 21:53:25 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @Toure right wing would have had a field day with Sierra Blanca & with his "women fantasize about being raped" writings from his 30s.
797556678912802818 2016-11-12 21:48:24 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @Toure Bernie would have done worse.  In addition to being Liberal he's a proud socialist, his emails would have been hacked too, & the
797556077189627904 2016-11-12 21:46:01 UTC <Vva10967> @LRoehnelt Illinois went for Hillary. No mandate at all. He will lose the popular vote by 2 to 3 million votes.
797555443136659457 2016-11-12 21:43:30 UTC <Vva10967> @AlecMacGillis agreed but 4 the record, Hillary's been a LIBERAL her ENTIRE LIFE.  Anything to contrary is a lie, a distortion of who she is
797554926545145857 2016-11-12 21:41:26 UTC <Vva10967> @AlecMacGillis @tspat04 we pandered to the GOP instead of going for the kill like they do. We're so divided that only tribal approach works.
797554463875760128 2016-11-12 21:39:36 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs @AlecMacGillis @fastjohnny Maybe what Midwest & Rural America rejected WAS Liberalism & not Hillary. Intraparty fighting sunk us.
797553598444007424 2016-11-12 21:36:10 UTC <Vva10967> 10. @jonfavs @davidplouffe I live in a blue state & think the country is doing great since Obama took office.I think we'll tank under Trump.
797553090274689025 2016-11-12 21:34:09 UTC <Vva10967> 9. @jonfavs @davidplouffe they're saying HELL NO but that's no reason to change OUR party's values of inclusion & of moving forward together
797552072216477697 2016-11-12 21:30:06 UTC <Vva10967> 8. @jonfavs @davidplouffe a lot has changed since 2012 & these folks take view that we're shoving our liberal values down their throats and
797551458623324161 2016-11-12 21:27:40 UTC <Vva10967> 7. @jonfavs @davidplouffe & the reason this part of America rejected HRC is that she & her campaign embodied these values that they reject
797550839883845632 2016-11-12 21:25:12 UTC <Vva10967> 6.@jonfavs @davidplouffe diversity, refugees, PC, yet all those are values that Liberal Dems cherish. Look at Dear Liberals trend on twitter
797550210889158657 2016-11-12 21:22:42 UTC <Vva10967> 5. @jonfavs @davidplouffe on social matters they reject post-2012 changes e.g. marriage equality, BLM, muslims, Kopernick flag protest,
797549086731800580 2016-11-12 21:18:14 UTC <Vva10967> 4 .@jonfavs @davidplouffe and on economic side that may be because those folks live in Republican-controlled states & can't connect the 2.
797548786377785344 2016-11-12 21:17:03 UTC <Vva10967> 3. @jonfavs @davidplouffe for months polls have been saying that a ton of people believe country is heading in wrong direction.
797548408261279749 2016-11-12 21:15:32 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @jonfavs @davidplouffe Hillary ran on promise of continuing Obama legacy & rural & midwest America rejected premise.
797547952319459328 2016-11-12 21:13:44 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @jonfavs @davidplouffe have U given any thougtht to the fact that rural & midwest America may just have rejected Liberalism?
797543449461395456 2016-11-12 20:55:50 UTC <Vva10967> @poniewozik @KevinMKruse lol, maybe King is a center-right guy & no matter what result is, he will say that the POTUS should govern that way
797542682356748288 2016-11-12 20:52:47 UTC <Vva10967> @poniewozik if that were true, Trump would have won the popular vote. Yet Hillary will win it by over 2 million votes.
797542285848309760 2016-11-12 20:51:13 UTC <Vva10967> @Toure has it occurred to you all that rural America & the midwest were rejecting Liberalism, marriage equality, BLM, inclusiveness & PC?
797536351344295940 2016-11-12 20:27:38 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert have they counted ALL the votes in those 3 states? any provisionals left? Also wasn't WI under court order to provide IDs?
797517681800921088 2016-11-12 19:13:27 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias however having done the job successfully in the past is also important. Maybe they should have co-chairs.
797517361960091648 2016-11-12 19:12:10 UTC <Vva10967> @daveweigel are you being sarcastic? or have you never seen a server?  do you really expected her to have used gmail, aol or yahoo? @jonfavs
797516551972913152 2016-11-12 19:08:57 UTC <Vva10967> @JuddLegum So HIllary's message of inclusion was too constructed & thus bad but Trump's message of hate was "authentic" & thus good?@jonfavs
797516210338430976 2016-11-12 19:07:36 UTC <Vva10967> @JuddLegum and it's extremely troubling to see you equate the garbage & hate that came out of Trump's mouth with "being authentic" @jonfavs
797515563832606720 2016-11-12 19:05:02 UTC <Vva10967> @JuddLegum @jonfavs The notion that Hillary isn't "authentic" was fabricated by the media & repeated so much that people believed it.
797513002153025536 2016-11-12 18:54:51 UTC <Vva10967> @pattonoswalt @somewhatalady @nycdp if we'd the legislatures & governorships in enough states we could have reached 270 btw now and 12/19=-(
797512235023220736 2016-11-12 18:51:48 UTC <Vva10967> @jryangolden CA alone has 4.5 million ballots to count and WA has >700,000.  NY has some too. CO is all mail in ballots.
797511230395154432 2016-11-12 18:47:49 UTC <Vva10967> @jag7337 media wanted a horse race for ratings so they normalized Trump and abnormalized Hillary. And they went too far.
797510347498328064 2016-11-12 18:44:18 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias @nolesfan2011 Not true.  The Republicans came home & voted for Trump.  The Bernie Dems did not. For them Hate Trumped Love.
797487119484809216 2016-11-12 17:12:00 UTC <Vva10967> Well at least in 2020 you won't have the sorry excuse of not knowing the voter registration deadlines.
797486715636170755 2016-11-12 17:10:24 UTC <Vva10967> you should google Hillary & Amadou Diallo
797485978852147200 2016-11-12 17:07:28 UTC <Vva10967> Don't count on it. https://twitter.com/seamusrex/status/797482845463777280
797485655299395584 2016-11-12 17:06:11 UTC <Vva10967> Saw it on MSNBC.  I've never had the desire to read The Art of the Deal which is where that appears. Apparently U did read it?
797484922877448193 2016-11-12 17:03:16 UTC <Vva10967> you do know that Bernie voted for that crime bill, no?  She was first lady and didn't get a vote.
797484372349820928 2016-11-12 17:01:05 UTC <Vva10967> she had a plan to fix it but now Trump will make it even worse.  Stocks of private prisons almost doubled on news of his election
797484064739655680 2016-11-12 16:59:52 UTC <Vva10967> the media didn't cover those stories until 2016, most of us don't read Trump bios.
797483729845452800 2016-11-12 16:58:32 UTC <Vva10967> @davidbrockdc @rzn2blv Wish I got paid, but no, I just stand for the TRUTH.  Hope President Trump thanks you Berners.
797483281319129088 2016-11-12 16:56:45 UTC <Vva10967> @rzn2blv no, people like U who hated her at all costs did.U didn't care that you'd be validating his racism & putting POC at risk
797482834969710592 2016-11-12 16:54:59 UTC <Vva10967> @rzn2blv Bernie will be too old in 2020. And HRC will defeat him again then. Or Elizabeth Warren will. #AlwaysWithHer
797482485613555712 2016-11-12 16:53:35 UTC <Vva10967> @rzn2blv LOL, let's hope U mature 1 day. Or maybe you'll become a Republican.  Their hate of HRC seems to be all that binds them
797482200673484801 2016-11-12 16:52:27 UTC <Vva10967> @rzn2blv actually Trump attacked the Mexicans first, on day 1 of his campaign so U have that backwards. He attacked BLM in 2016.
797481615182204929 2016-11-12 16:50:08 UTC <Vva10967> @rzn2blv she WON the popular vote.  Bernie Busters elected Trump. He didn't have enough voters to elect him.  Congrats!
797481295441985536 2016-11-12 16:48:51 UTC <Vva10967> 11 @seamusrex @rzn2blv reason NY FBI hates her is she stood with families of unarmed black men killed by NYPD in 1999 & 2000, before iphones
797481051396468736 2016-11-12 16:47:53 UTC <Vva10967> 10 @seamusrex @rzn2blv been a public servant fighting for women, children, families, the disabled, equal rights, healthcare, for over 30 yrs
797480609576873984 2016-11-12 16:46:08 UTC <Vva10967> 9 @seamusrex @rzn2blv she's been most admired woman for 20 yrs, she gets standing ovations at her speeches & will continue to do so. She's
797480395751165952 2016-11-12 16:45:17 UTC <Vva10967> 8 @seamusrex @rzn2blv & she gave 100s of paid speeches even to environmental groups & charged >$200K bc that's what celebs like her get paid
797480027562659840 2016-11-12 16:43:49 UTC <Vva10967> 7. @seamusrex @rzn2blv Bernie didn't give paid speeches BECAUSE IT'S AGAINST THE LAW for public officials to do so,not bc he was so virtuous
797479686523801600 2016-11-12 16:42:28 UTC <Vva10967> 6.@seamusrex @rzn2blv how donations get reported, by the field in which the INDIVIDUAL works.  Corporations can't give money to candidates.
797479502553214976 2016-11-12 16:41:44 UTC <Vva10967> 5. @seamusrex @rzn2blv her donations from "wall street" & "oil & gas industries" are donations from people who work in those fields. That's
797479307560030208 2016-11-12 16:40:58 UTC <Vva10967> 4. @seamusrex @rzn2blv had Bernie not been so arrogant, he would have told you that he LIED when he accused her of being a corporate sellout
797479232226131968 2016-11-12 16:40:40 UTC <Vva10967> 3. @seamusrex @rzn2blv your problem.  NYS has had the same rules for YEARS, didn't change them to suppress anything.
797478929707712512 2016-11-12 16:39:27 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @seamusrex @rzn2blv there was no voter suppression.  The primary rules are established by each state & if you can't follow them that's
797478336675061760 2016-11-12 16:37:06 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @seamusrex @rzn2blv All Wikileaks shows is DNC officials were (rightfully) angry at Bernie after he & Weaver attacked them on Sun shows.
797477317253730304 2016-11-12 16:33:03 UTC <Vva10967> 2. @jag7337 @BernieSanders he made her out to be in the primary; also that he lost because SHE got more 4 MILLION more votes than he did.
797477058569977857 2016-11-12 16:32:01 UTC <Vva10967> 1. @jag7337 @BernieSanders was too proud to tell his supporters that Hillary was a good & honest public servant & not the "corporate whore"
797476430246453248 2016-11-12 16:29:32 UTC <Vva10967> @SickInBed Scott, hope you aren't as brown in real life as in your photo or you'll end up profiled by Trump's stop & frisk program.
797334112159809536 2016-11-11 07:04:00 UTC <Vva10967> Wall Street was a problem in 2008 but isn't a problem in 2016. Trump & the bigotry he's unleashed &  damage he will do are.
797333656998178817 2016-11-11 07:02:12 UTC <Vva10967> and the one who was criticized about WV was HRC when she said that Clean Energy was going to put coal miners out of buz.
797333358850220032 2016-11-11 07:01:01 UTC <Vva10967> You guys are as bad as the Trump followers in viewing Bernie as a God. He isn't.  He's a politician obsessed w Wall Street.

797328815043280896 2016-11-11 06:42:57 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid true but it wasn't a majority that elected him. It was the Bernie Bros voting third party.Majority voted for HRC's inclusiveness
797328202674880513 2016-11-11 06:40:31 UTC <Vva10967> @pattonoswalt @somewhatalady difference will grow to between 2 and 3 million when CA is tallied. They're really slow. Lots of mail in
797327820863184896 2016-11-11 06:39:00 UTC <Vva10967> @pattonoswalt @nycdp @somewhatalady problem now is that GOP controls most state legislatures & must realize EC is only way they can win WH
797327137711751168 2016-11-11 06:36:17 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 I hope Trump is able to get his term limits for Congressmen promise through.  So many in Capitol Hill need to go.
797326622923878400 2016-11-11 06:34:15 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 I swear, someone in the media should get a copy of My New Order and read it to see if he is using it as a script.
797325445159092224 2016-11-11 06:29:34 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 they should have co-chairs. I favor Howard Dean bc he's done it before SUCCESSFULLY & can do it FT.  CoChair can add ideas.
797323748844195840 2016-11-11 06:22:49 UTC <Vva10967> @HawaiiDelilah I'm tired of his obsession to break up Wall Street. He's stuck in 2008 & we have bigger problems w/ bigotry under Trump today
797321324016390144 2016-11-11 06:13:11 UTC <Vva10967> @rzn2blv because that's a myth. HRC won primary bc she got 4 million more votes than he did. And she won the popular vote in general 2.
797319950805454848 2016-11-11 06:07:44 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN no one is discussing the 300,000 people who couldn't vote in WI because of voter ID law. First election after VRA gutting.
797319210036842496 2016-11-11 06:04:47 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN I agree w/ @johnpodesta, media was extremely hostile to HRC blowing email story way out of proportion while obsessing w Trump
797317190500413440 2016-11-11 05:56:46 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN she'll end up with a 2 to 3 million lead over Trump when CA is tallied. Lots of mail in ballots.
797316595345395712 2016-11-11 05:54:24 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN Trump LOVED both Clintons up until 2015 & praises them lavishly in 2003-13 interviews. Attended Trump's wedding to Melania 2.
797315543611166720 2016-11-11 05:50:13 UTC <Vva10967> no, the criticism was that Bernie automatically assumed that ALL blacks live in ghettos.  Trump believes that too. #stereotypes

797222551936233472 2016-11-11 23:40:42 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 Media is too busy normalizingTrump.

797214278541516804 2016-11-11 23:07:50 UTC <Vva10967> @Lawrence @MSNBC @TheLastWord technically yes but they have to be willing to do it.
797209494434545668 2016-11-11 22:48:49 UTC <Vva10967> @ahumorlessfem @LaPajamas they are the reason Hillary was defeated on Tuesday, their third party votes in FL MI PA & WI to get even at HRCpic.twitter.com/1tFYFehrES
797208209757007872 2016-11-11 22:43:43 UTC <Vva10967> @Donna_West @Ricky11Slade Truth hurts?  Deep inside you, YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE.
797207605030567941 2016-11-11 22:41:19 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias do you mean vis a vis Trump or vis a vis the Democratic Party? For the 2nd: http://politi.co/2e8NrR4
797206910734843904 2016-11-11 22:38:33 UTC <Vva10967> @ElectProject are there any provisional ballots left in Florida? and is PA still counting its ballots?
797186828277268484 2016-11-11 21:18:45 UTC <Vva10967> @Donna_West @Ricky11Slade Berners elected President Trump with their 3rd party, Hate Hillary votes, not his own voters.
797183855136571392 2016-11-11 21:06:56 UTC <Vva10967> So no, it wasn't turn out. It was third party protest votes.https://twitter.com/ElectProject/status/796797779314085888
797098769632399361 2016-11-11 15:28:50 UTC <Vva10967> And you also underestimate the right wing smearing machine that has been after Hillary for past 30 years; it would have crushed Bernie toohttps://twitter.com/Smooth_Orator/status/796771118191431685
797095246219898880 2016-11-11 15:14:50 UTC <Vva10967> Hillary's popular vote lead will be between 2 and 3 million votes when all of CA is counted.https://twitter.com/gelliottmorris/status/796898990017183744
797094209417256960 2016-11-11 15:10:43 UTC <Vva10967> @dissentingj and no, they wouldn't back HER, they were Bernie supporters who should have backed the DEM Ticket which backed Bernie's IDEAS.
797093826636693505 2016-11-11 15:09:12 UTC <Vva10967> @dissentingj MI & WI were in the "safe" democratic states list promoted by this trading votes group.
797093540014813184 2016-11-11 15:08:03 UTC <Vva10967> @dissentingj There also was a list where people were trading pledges to vote Dem in swing states for voting 3rd party in safe Dem states 2/
797092664076365824 2016-11-11 15:04:35 UTC <Vva10967> @dissentingj it's not a secret that Bernie supporters were going to cast protest votes & Gary has run before & never gotten > 1% of the vote
796980821571801088 2016-11-10 07:40:09 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn the Third party vote was unusually high too in FL so we lost bc of protest vote. Had they voted for Dem ticket we would have won
796979058856890368 2016-11-10 07:33:09 UTC <Vva10967> @Monster4Gaga24 but by supporting him they are saying that they don't care that he is racist and intolerant because it doesn't affect them.
796897247107674112 2016-11-10 02:08:04 UTC <Vva10967> @dilemmv he'll lose the primary again.
796896182618431488 2016-11-10 02:03:50 UTC <Vva10967> @Smooth_Orator @TheMindOfManiac and no, it's not from both parties.  Her negatives are the GOP and the BernieBust people. Dems LOVE her.
796895892154580992 2016-11-10 02:02:40 UTC <Vva10967> @Smooth_Orator @TheMindOfManiac That's because the right wing has been attacking her for 30 years. They would have trashed Bernie by now.
796884920966795265 2016-11-10 01:19:05 UTC <Vva10967> Hey @HardballChris is this the economic anxiety that U keep saying is responsible for Trump's success among whites?http://bit.ly/2fBd64m
796871376409923584 2016-11-10 00:25:15 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders because ALL billionaires are bad? what if some just want to preserve our civil rights which are under attack by the GOP?

796839849538031616 2016-11-10 22:19:59 UTC <Vva10967> @CharlesMBlow @JoyAnnReid More important is that he campaigned on bigotry & bullying & his followers see his winning as validation of that.

796479771811008512 2016-11-09 22:29:10 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @PostSurgeOp yes, that's probably what drove the 3rd party voters to hate her. But not just the media, the BernieBros also did.
796478950742626304 2016-11-09 22:25:54 UTC <Vva10967> @chefbscott yes but without the 3rd party voters in FL MI PA & WI, the racists and sexists would not have triumphed. Now they're emboldened.

795100750665908225 2016-11-05 03:09:25 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert @HardballChris also argues this, seems he can't face that it's racial resentment that motivates Trump supporters.

794782109458202624 2016-11-04 06:03:15 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid U suggest that Comey is not part of the right wing faction of the FBI but if that's the case why doesn't he clean up the house?
794778781479305217 2016-11-04 05:50:02 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn @ShaneGoldmacher he likes to hold large rallies, seems to equate them with votes.

794570776355684352 2016-11-04 16:03:30 UTC <Vva10967> @mikepshannon in Hillary's case you're confusing unpopularity with tribalism.  Hillary is hated by GOP.  Dems love her & the world loves her

793704020955238400 2016-11-01 06:39:19 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN you think she means the date but us New Yorkers refer to 9/11 as the event itself
793638816708001792 2016-11-01 02:20:13 UTC <Vva10967> @BraddJaffy lol, Trump campaign has bad grammar, it should say "its views" not "their views" and yes, its views represent Trump voters.

792971099772481536 2016-10-30 06:06:57 UTC <Vva10967> @frankrichny he fucked up in July trying to crucify Hillary and it snowballed from there. Seems to believe he's above the law & DOJ rules.

791455631530156032 2016-10-26 01:45:01 UTC <Vva10967> What a pathetic coward.  Utah should vote him out for lacking a spine and standing with Trump. Not endorsing but voting for Trump IS A FARCEhttps://twitter.com/jasoninthehouse/status/791445788656226304
791454593989373953 2016-10-26 01:40:54 UTC <Vva10967> @jasoninthehouse You're a coward.  Trump stands AGAINST everything your religion stands for.  And you voted to cut the State Dept's budget.
791333258948644864 2016-10-26 17:38:45 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSchumer why not do a Retire Rubio fundraiser?  Bet people would give money to it.https://twitter.com/DKElections/status/791328583683891200
791077873264254977 2016-10-25 00:43:57 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper until you rid your panels of Trump surrogates, they will continue to be meaningless even if you are heading them.
791075876381331457 2016-10-25 00:36:01 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @AmandaRenteria m Rubio should be targeted for retirement.  He is a traitor to Latinos. Help @PatrickMurphyFL defeat him.
790974127876280322 2016-10-25 17:51:42 UTC <Vva10967> @NPR Little Marco was as bad on deportation even of the Dreamers as Donald Trump is. Only cares about himself rising up in GOP #PartyOfTrump
790971143670886400 2016-10-25 17:39:50 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN True, but the outrage at Trump's attacks on Mexicans & Latinos has been felt since he started his campaign.  He built that.
790959690440138752 2016-10-25 16:54:20 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas a ver cuando reconoce que no debio haberse realizado, period. Trump nunca va a ser Presidente.
790740292601348097 2016-10-24 02:22:31 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid yep, they turned off the Dem base when they threw Obama under the bus, and the GOP base was always going to vote GOP.
790664110673387520 2016-10-24 21:19:48 UTC <Vva10967> @CapehartJ and if you are voting 3rd party, you ARE voting for Trump no matter what you tell yourself and you KNOW IT.
790417157746286592 2016-10-23 04:58:30 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost is this how you feel too?  Hacking is now an invaluable reporting tool according to your reporter?https://twitter.com/Vva10967/status/790416712755712000
790416712755712000 2016-10-23 04:56:44 UTC <Vva10967> @anu_narayan @mateagold @edatpost so hacking emails is now "an invaluable reporting tool"??? Seriously?  So much for ethics???
790065204356939776 2016-10-22 05:39:58 UTC <Vva10967> @joshtpm @Teelin yes but it's not a safe platform so it makes advertisers uneasy. It isn't even growing it's user base anymore
790062034008301572 2016-10-22 05:27:22 UTC <Vva10967> @joshtpm @Teelin they (Twitter) have bills to pay, lol.  Rent and servers aren't free, and neither are employees.

790060080087597056 2016-10-22 05:19:36 UTC <Vva10967> @joshtpm @Teelin FB will outlive Twitter, both are US for-profit businesses with shareholders & no one wants to invest in or acquire Twitter
790059664805429248 2016-10-22 05:17:57 UTC <Vva10967> @jack @joshtpm @mattbc @Christalsea @Teelin No, first world is too broad, lol.  US problems first.  And Twitter is running out of money.
790058233037725696 2016-10-22 05:12:15 UTC <Vva10967> @joshtpm @mattbc @Christalsea @Teelin Arab Spring = disaster. Twitter's still tanking & unlikely 2 still B around in another year.  @jack
790057284294569984 2016-10-22 05:08:29 UTC <Vva10967> @joshtpm @mattbc they're both publicly traded companies, with shareholders. One continues to grow, one is tanking "bigly".  @jack
790055673237299200 2016-10-22 05:02:05 UTC <Vva10967> @joshtpm @mattbc Facebook works just fine with real names and is a safer environment than Twitter.
790043283489714176 2016-10-22 04:12:51 UTC <Vva10967> @joshtpm @mattbc there R no consequences when U insult & threaten behind an acronym. Not so when you do it under your real name.
790042774708097027 2016-10-22 04:10:50 UTC <Vva10967> @joshtpm @mattbc a name that isn't your REAL name.  FB requires you to use your real name & will delete your account if you do not.

790029028547780608 2016-10-22 03:16:13 UTC <Vva10967> @joshtpm it would help if Twitter didn't allow fake accounts. That's one reason why Twitter is so far behind FB.  @jack
789696043139072000 2016-10-21 05:13:03 UTC <Vva10967> @tomforemancnn @AC360 Don't worry, Hillary'll win in a landslide. America's great because America's good & we'll prove it on 11/8 #IMWithHer
789694182466187264 2016-10-21 05:05:39 UTC <Vva10967> @AdamPlatt1999 maybe he thinks that a President Trump will pardon him, lol.  NOT.

789520235611185152 2016-10-21 17:34:27 UTC <Vva10967> @AndreaWNYC why can't the government bring charges against the governor and lock him up?
789343182765064192 2016-10-20 05:50:54 UTC <Vva10967> @mariaramirezNY @UniPolitica aunque el mono se vista de sedan mono se queda. Trump no puede comprar la clase que le falta.
789341412026376192 2016-10-20 05:43:52 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid he confused the dinner with one of his trashy rallies & the elites there with his deplorables. In gutter after watergate "joke".
789340122521210880 2016-10-20 05:38:45 UTC <Vva10967> @RosieGray he confused the dinner with his trashy rallies & hit the gutter starting with his watergate "joke" #unfit
789225679762104320 2016-10-20 22:03:59 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes unless you, the MSM, stop repeating the nonsense that nobody likes her. I, like millions of @HillaryClinton voters, LOVE HER.
788969116707192832 2016-10-19 05:04:30 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper Not true. She is brilliant.
788967786596995072 2016-10-19 04:59:13 UTC <Vva10967> @SecretService look at April LaJune's tweet below. https://twitter.com/alankestrel750/status/788966870351278080
788782795762065408 2016-10-19 16:44:08 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid I don't get why he's bringing Obama's half brother.  To remind people of his birtherism?  It's not like he's debating Obama.
788780656327331840 2016-10-19 16:35:37 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid and yet his poll numbers have been tanking since the Billy Bush tapes were released....maybe the polling is off?

788593468977344512 2016-10-18 04:11:49 UTC <Vva10967> @MaddowBlog @maddow Look Rachel, Trump got a 4th endorsement, lol:http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/10/18/kkks-official-newspaper-just-endorsed-trump/
788465575097987072 2016-10-18 19:43:36 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper how's this news? 2 agencies, FBI saying retro-classified for FOIA, can't release, State saying release it, not classified.
788163111446511616 2016-10-17 23:41:43 UTC <Vva10967> @SecretService the guy in this video, Dan Bowman, needs a visit. Just threatened to kill our next President when she wins.https://twitter.com/JamilSmith/status/788042507414364162
788162477922119680 2016-10-17 23:39:12 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes maybe @realDonaldTrump can get Paul Ryan fired!
788130180107735040 2016-10-17 21:30:52 UTC <Vva10967> @AC360 sounds like she's still at the first stage of grief: Denial, lol.  Anger comes next.
788058475704250368 2016-10-17 16:45:56 UTC <Vva10967> @nancycordes 3/  problem is that the government's FOIA officials err on the side of overclassifying so as to NOT release most docs 2 public
788058058165460996 2016-10-17 16:44:17 UTC <Vva10967> @nancycordes 2/ had @HillaryClinton used a http://state.gov account, those emails would STILL have been RETROACTIVELY classified.
788057720574312448 2016-10-17 16:42:56 UTC <Vva10967> @nancycordes 1/ Your reporting re @HillaryClinton's emails is NONSENSE. Retroactive classification only affect what gets released under FOIA
788057037800370176 2016-10-17 16:40:13 UTC <Vva10967> @nancycordes STOP CREATING FAKE SCANDALS ABOUT @HillaryClinton.  She can ride with whomever the hell she wants.  Period.  So can POTUS.
788056834531885056 2016-10-17 16:39:25 UTC <Vva10967> @nancycordes that's NOT a scandal. I'm sure POTUS has his own preferences too as to who he rides with in the Beast when he travels.
787803722244034560 2016-10-16 23:53:38 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn @eddie2003PRT the latino vote is probably there but the tv market if probably too expensive.
787685933634187264 2016-10-16 16:05:35 UTC <Vva10967> @aterkel lol, bet Trump will say he hasn't talked to Pence and that he disagrees, as he did in the debate.
787684074995539968 2016-10-16 15:58:12 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert 2/ and that we need to give President Hillary Clinton a BLUE House and Senate to get things done & Stop the Witch Hunts
787683792442056705 2016-10-16 15:57:05 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert I think the message has to be that Trump needs to be defeated in a landslide to send clear message of rejecting Trumpism
787544123343601665 2016-10-15 06:42:05 UTC <Vva10967> @business thank god. At least they will have drinking water left.
787542884346109952 2016-10-15 06:37:10 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @amjoyshow loved it!  Not having to listen to their nonsense is refreshing and leaves more time for you and your smart guests!
787482762756362240 2016-10-15 02:38:16 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 to be fair, we have to thank Jeff Weaver for this.  He started it. Trump took it and ran with it.
787466541344448512 2016-10-15 01:33:48 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod if he doesn't show up & she does, @HillaryClinton can spend the full 90 minutes explaining her policies.
787466242919632896 2016-10-15 01:32:37 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod Trump projects, which tells you that HE would fail a drug test. That persistent & unexplained sniffling of his suggests coke.
787457093011996672 2016-10-15 00:56:15 UTC <Vva10967> @AnnieLinskey @lindadunderwood You obviously watch too much Faux News and live in an alternate reality. CNN is FULL of paid Trump surrogates
787343751463182337 2016-10-15 17:25:53 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller sounds like we need to keep Gitmo open for these domestic terrorists.
787342898517929984 2016-10-15 17:22:29 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica para que? Si Mitch McConnell y Paul Ryan le dieron vacaciones al Congreso hasta mediados de Noviembre.
787100794613014528 2016-10-14 01:20:27 UTC <Vva10967> @AnnieLinskey because the media will blow it out of proportion as they've done with Hillary's speeches?

786460378955931649 2016-10-12 06:55:40 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN thought this was the best version yet of @HillaryClinton stump speech.  Covered most key policies & was high energy too
786457947685748737 2016-10-12 06:46:01 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs but he still needs to be defeated in a landslide so he can't claim that he lost because the election was "rigged"
785866350803779586 2016-10-11 15:35:13 UTC <Vva10967> @Tom_Winter it's one of the FOIA litigations by Judicial Watch demanding copies of Hillary's emails. Look at date. Not Comey one.
785856677694373888 2016-10-11 14:56:47 UTC <Vva10967> In a SWORN affidavit on Dec 23, 1998, Juanita Broaddrick denied allegations that Bill Clinton had raped her http://bit.ly/2dXiufV

785505773187112961 2016-10-10 15:42:24 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto that's pretty stupid.
785340634609647616 2016-10-09 04:46:12 UTC <Vva10967> @AC360 So did Trump (attack the women that Bill Clinton was abusive to).  He LOVED Bill Clinton up until recently.
785277939696988161 2016-10-09 00:37:05 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica El comal le dijo a la olla, que tilosa estas!  O en Ingles, the Pot Calling the Kettle Black!

782735040497278976 2016-10-02 00:12:30 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid did you see this? Lebron James endorsed Hillary! http://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-why-endorsing-hillary-clinton-for-president-2016-9
782632234109001728 2016-10-02 17:23:59 UTC <Vva10967> @SopanDeb explanation makes no sense.  Trump owned the Miss Universe pageant, so the "they" is really "Trump". Trump wanted to fire her.
782630259120345088 2016-10-02 17:16:08 UTC <Vva10967> @NickKristof why is it so hard for journalists & media to admit that?  seems entire media struggles to say what is sooooo obvious.
782447920213819393 2016-10-01 05:11:36 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid he's been overweight for a while!  Almost as bad as Chris Christie.
782444685172367360 2016-10-01 04:58:44 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaTeresa1 I think it's just the way he views Latinas, assumes all R housekeepers, similar to how he views blacks, as all living in crime
782106679353761792 2016-09-30 06:35:37 UTC <Vva10967> @thefix LOL why is the media so freaked out by the notion that racism IS the main driver behind the Trump campaign?
782094101646901248 2016-09-30 05:45:39 UTC <Vva10967> @thefix maybe U & @HardballChris should go 2 a Trump Rally.  U both cannot bring yourselves 2 admit that motivation IS RACISM & XENOPHOBIA

778743699710685185 2016-09-21 23:52:21 UTC <Vva10967> @jahnaberry and he wants to eliminate the Dept of Homeland Security because he doesn't know what they do.
778723541067767815 2016-09-21 22:32:14 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou and the Media should let viewers & readers know that THEY are even MORE disliked than Trump, which is saying a lot, lol!

778452844475129856 2016-09-20 04:36:35 UTC <Vva10967> @JasonMillerinDC @SopanDeb Question is whether the media will give Crooked Trump a pass.  They always believe the worst of Hillary.

775372132314411008 2016-09-12 16:34:56 UTC <Vva10967> @SopanDeb so putting the press in a pen & having supporters spit at reporters is "respecting what the press does" per @KellyannePolls ???
775210645180542977 2016-09-11 05:53:15 UTC <Vva10967> @UniNoticias that was the position of ALL the other GOP candidates too except Jeb and Kasich. The GOP is the problem not just Trump.

774754556072824832 2016-09-10 23:40:55 UTC <Vva10967> @thedailybeast @JoyAnnReid They can't help themselves lol. And everyone in that photo qualifies for the basket lol. It's even missing folks!
774754033814863872 2016-09-10 23:38:50 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @traceeloran that's a parody (fake) account. It uses an uppercase i instead of a lowercase L in Real.
774731849918717952 2016-09-10 22:10:41 UTC <Vva10967> @Artizek nah, it's probably about 40%.She forgot the roughly 30% who have Clinton Derangement Syndrome but don't necessarily fall in basket.
774704819948949505 2016-09-10 20:23:17 UTC <Vva10967> @DKElections Yep, same as Trump's "apology" where he expressed "regret". She regrets rounding up since real number is about 40% not 50%. lol
774703106684809221 2016-09-10 20:16:28 UTC <Vva10967> @ABCLiz True, it's more like 40%, lol.

774467426947887104 2016-09-09 04:39:58 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid FB is now including Breitbart "news" in Trending Topics & having the Alt Right appear there makes my skin cringe & can't opt out

774101790925004800 2016-09-08 04:27:03 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Junior is quite gullible.  Not the first time he retweets a conspiracy theory.
774015126215204864 2016-09-08 22:42:41 UTC <Vva10967> @rubycramer I think she is referring to GOP elected officials like Ryan & McConnell who could have disavowed Trump but chose not to.
774014428354273281 2016-09-08 22:39:54 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN U would think that at the State Dept server level U'd be able to do a search for a particular employee's emails but maybe not
773762335378931713 2016-09-07 05:58:11 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod not that odd when they barely had time to answer audience's questions.
773756401910972416 2016-09-07 05:34:36 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid the Mexican TV coverage of Trump's visit has been brutal.  Pena Nieto was told by interviewer that he let Trump vomit on Mexico
773671308081111040 2016-09-07 23:56:28 UTC <Vva10967> @matthewamiller funny that Comey chastises Hillary while he untentionally breaks the DOJ's own rulespic.twitter.com/ykGpQ7dA2S

773217254238552064 2016-09-06 17:52:13 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN is there a video of today's Q&A? there was one of Monday's Q&A uploaded by CNN to YouTube.
773216922561196032 2016-09-06 17:50:54 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN doesn't have to. I'm pretty sure I heard @mitchellreports start to ask Q re FBI emails report yesterday but HRC didn't take Q
773215395033513984 2016-09-06 17:44:50 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon that's a great ad (Sacrifices). Last TX poll has Hillary tied with Trump and even SC looks close.
773200843680129024 2016-09-06 16:47:01 UTC <Vva10967> @ElGalopeFinca y por si fuera poco hay una entrevista de los 90 donde el mismo dice que los negros son ladrones y haraganes y los judios no.
773200614738264064 2016-09-06 16:46:06 UTC <Vva10967> @ElGalopeFinca ademas en 1973 el Departamento de Justicia de Nixon lo cacho descriminando contra negros en el alquiler de sus apts en NYC.
773200287494537217 2016-09-06 16:44:48 UTC <Vva10967> @ElGalopeFinca el muro es lo de menos.  Como explicas q diga q los Mexicanos son criminales y violadores y que el Juez Curiel es Mexicano.
773199813206835200 2016-09-06 16:42:55 UTC <Vva10967> @QuinnLisaq pues parece que aoras ese tipo de regimen ya que apoyas a Trump a quien admiran tanto David Duke como Putin y Kim-Jong Un
773043405341548544 2016-09-05 06:21:24 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica @ElGalopeFinca el partido Republicano de ahora hubiera expulsado a Reagan por esa amnistia. Se ha vuelto extremista y racista
773042709766561792 2016-09-05 06:18:39 UTC <Vva10967> @QuinnLisaq y tu como que te saltaste la historia de 1965 en adelante cuando los racistas del partido Democrata se pasaron al Republicano
773040102222262272 2016-09-05 06:08:17 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 @peterdaou @jack + fact that unlike Facebook Twitter allows fake accounts results in bullying & stalls growth tanking stock
772846766878253057 2016-09-05 17:20:02 UTC <Vva10967> @kylegriffin1 he needs to tell his followers that voting third party helps Trump. Some apparently don't understand Electoral College system.
772839972017729536 2016-09-05 16:53:02 UTC <Vva10967> @joshtpm Comey's always been overzealous (eg Martha Stewart) & like Trey Gowdy he wanted to nail Hillary but couldn't so gave talking points
772560576446857216 2016-09-04 22:22:49 UTC <Vva10967> @aravosis lol, Trump should proclaim that Robert Byrd was a white supremacist at his next West Virginia rally.  That will go over well, lol
772559644552261632 2016-09-04 22:19:07 UTC <Vva10967> @Jose4nton10 ahora vas a comparar los sistemas corruptos de Latinoamerica con los de USA??? Por favor, EDUCATE.
772551367655391236 2016-09-04 21:46:14 UTC <Vva10967> @Jose4nton10 HIllary obtuvo mas de 18 MILLONES de votos en 2008 y 17.5 MILLONES en 2016.  Bernie solo obtuvo 13 Millones. #MathMatters.

772548834744471552 2016-09-04 21:36:10 UTC <Vva10967> @Hillary_esp @MariaESalinas @Jose4nton10 No seas bobo.  Eso lo dijo Bernie porque queria ganarle a Hillary. Trump es pro-fracking y pro-coal
772548338831003648 2016-09-04 21:34:11 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas it's all the fracking.
772547785228967936 2016-09-04 21:31:59 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas @tokonaire991 they had Soledad O'Brien who was excellent but Jeff Zucker got rid of her when he took over @CNN & ruined CNN.
771932240175570944 2016-09-02 04:46:02 UTC <Vva10967> Seems Trump forgot to mention that he plans to implement Guiliani's stop & frisk program for men of color nationwidehttps://twitter.com/SopanDeb/status/771925874925002754
771819763907440647 2016-09-02 21:19:06 UTC <Vva10967> @speechboy71 the GOP recognized early on that Hillary had the brains & the drive 2 become our first woman POTUS & set out to destroy her.
771781350298968064 2016-09-02 18:46:27 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou @joanwalsh @jack And that is why Twitter has fallen way behind Facebook.  There is merit to not allowing anonymous/fake accounts.
771764709020340224 2016-09-02 17:40:19 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow @joanwalsh @MariaESalinas @jdbalart did you all see this?  OUCH! http://remezcla.com/film/alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu-op-ed-pena-nieto-trump-mexico-visit/
771762850260017152 2016-09-02 17:32:56 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC not if he signed the non-compete for his $40 million severance.
771218203108216832 2016-08-31 05:28:42 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro @AmandaRenteria as to Dreamers I'm pretty sure he said he would repeal the president's executive actions so they get deported 2
771214816782397440 2016-08-31 05:15:15 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica y @EPN le dio una plataforma para lucir "presidencial" sin tener q pedir disculpas por insultar a Mexico
771197627689873408 2016-08-31 04:06:57 UTC <Vva10967> @EPN pues esta noche en Arizona Trump dijo que Mexico SI pagar por el muro. Lo unico q usted logr es darle credibilidad a ese payaso.
771195180980449282 2016-08-31 03:57:13 UTC <Vva10967> @SopanDeb got to wonder what Trump believes the word retainer means, lol. Can't figure it out. It's not warrants bc they're already arrested
771055285351907328 2016-08-31 18:41:20 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 too funny bc the Mexican president is as popular there as W was in 2008. And this trip is only going to sink his #s further.
771039923998748672 2016-08-31 17:40:17 UTC <Vva10967> @versharma Thank God!  This is the woman trying 12 yo kids as adults and seeking life sentences w/o parole for them.
771027363882729473 2016-08-31 16:50:23 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn I think it has more to do with the rise of Faux News.
771025188028837890 2016-08-31 16:41:44 UTC <Vva10967> @CapehartJ love your articles & appearances on @amjoyshow. Thanks 4 debunking the HRC conspiracy theories. Wish more journalists would do it
770848161409662976 2016-08-30 04:58:18 UTC <Vva10967> @EPN Trump lleva consigo a uno de los Senadores mas racistas de EEUU, Jeff Sessions de Alabama.
770399499604860928 2016-08-29 23:15:28 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper why? he's not HRC's staffer.  His wife is.
770325379282268164 2016-08-29 18:20:57 UTC <Vva10967> @jeffzeleny is the September 13 event a joint event of @POTUS & @HillaryClinton or just POTUS? Your article says joint, their listing doesnt
770322122572955648 2016-08-29 18:08:00 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN you DO know that Weiner is not on Hillary's staff, right? I mean, you follow her around and Huma, not Anthony, is her staffer.
770321866548453376 2016-08-29 18:06:59 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN if his argument is that men who cheat on their wives shouldn't have access to classified info, yeah, let's go for it.
770095716542939139 2016-08-28 03:08:21 UTC <Vva10967> @amJoy @MSNBC @msnbc @joyreid @amjoy why do you still have @hughhewitt??? he lowers your ratings and speaks nonsense.
770093232332140550 2016-08-28 02:58:28 UTC <Vva10967> @rev_rodriguez @AlPunto @Slick15Rk o eres un fanatico religioso O un credulo q se deja enganar por Faux y sus teorias de conspiracion.

769906709804572673 2016-08-28 14:37:18 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @jorgeramosnews sigues MALinformando sobre los correos electronicos de Hillary. NO SON NUEVOS, Comey los menciono en Julio.
769905547617394688 2016-08-28 14:32:41 UTC <Vva10967> @rev_rodriguez @AlPunto por favor, si Trump en su vida ha abierto y mucho menos ha leido una Biblia.  Ni siquiera va a misa.
769905137347391488 2016-08-28 14:31:03 UTC <Vva10967> @rev_rodriguez @AlPunto @jorgeramosnews estas atrasado de noticias, ayer Trump volvio a su antigua postura de deportar a los 11 millones+
769734915004956672 2016-08-27 03:14:39 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow well it would help if we are able to give her a Democratic Senate AND House. Her ratings do go WAY UP doing the job.
769691602155700224 2016-08-27 00:22:32 UTC <Vva10967> @SopanDeb I think it's time for the press to start asking if the Donald is mentally ill.  It isn't normal to ramble all the time.
769660011043774464 2016-08-27 22:17:00 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod actually it sounds like something the Breitbart guy would write, so no. Campaign CEO would probably cheer him on.
769659598143913985 2016-08-27 22:15:22 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh mmmm, they would have to kick out the Dixiecrats, the Tea Partiers and the Alt Right first.

767890774134587392 2016-08-22 01:06:41 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN we need a special prosecutor to investigate Trump's ties to Russia PLUS his bribes to FL AG & TX AG re Trump University cases

766513261365850112 2016-08-18 05:52:57 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports since he didn't turn ANY of his emails in we don't know if his unmarked emails would have been deemed classified by CIA
766511908258189312 2016-08-18 05:47:34 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports Another difference is that Powell NEVER turned in ANY of his work related emails sent or received in his AOL account. NONE.

765983860270239744 2016-08-17 18:49:18 UTC <Vva10967> @utham1507 her base in MS is black voters not southern whites like Bernie implied in the primary.  They're outnumbered by whites.
765939700423069697 2016-08-17 15:53:49 UTC <Vva10967> @JesseLehrich ethical rules for legal profession say that in defending a client you cannot allow the client to lie and/or perjure himself.
765939215439896576 2016-08-17 15:51:54 UTC <Vva10967> @JesseLehrich well no, the proper analogy would be if there were doctors who help people DO bad things as he is helping NC DO a bad thing.

765934219449237504 2016-08-17 15:32:02 UTC <Vva10967> Hey @jorgeramosnews you should ask him if he would quit if he were indicted for smoking and/or possessing marijuana, as he is a regular user
765769161075220486 2016-08-16 04:36:09 UTC <Vva10967> @newtgingrich but then Trump would lose his white supremacist base, no? Would also require AAs to forget how much hate GOP has shown Obama.

763951081227362304 2016-08-11 04:11:45 UTC <Vva10967> @MattMackowiak one can only hope, lol. But he's just exposing what your party has been harvesting these past 8 years.  Karma is a b*tch!
763948151401091072 2016-08-11 04:00:07 UTC <Vva10967> @aseitzwald @guff232 You sound like a Bernie Bro who cannot let go of your hate for an imaginary Hillary.  The real one is a good woman.
763946035735519232 2016-08-11 03:51:43 UTC <Vva10967> @aseitzwald @guff232 so? she wants him to come out & say that Trump's unfit & dangerous.That's how you win a landslide & take back the House
763945183033434112 2016-08-11 03:48:19 UTC <Vva10967> @Shizzletheland @guff232 oh, you're stuck in 1964?  how sad.
763903698695294976 2016-08-11 01:03:29 UTC <Vva10967> @aseitzwald @guff232 She's friends with him.  That isn't a secret. She's also friends with W.  Doesn't mean she agrees with their policies.
763861568484478976 2016-08-11 22:16:04 UTC <Vva10967> @HFA You should make it into a TShirt and magnet too.
763860475964719105 2016-08-11 22:11:43 UTC <Vva10967> @jack and that in a nutshell is the problem with Twitter, which Facebook doesn't have.https://twitter.com/PeterKerwin26/status/763856833392041984
763860060590268416 2016-08-11 22:10:04 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn her speeches and interviews from the 1990s when she was first lady are very similar. A lot of them are in YouTube.
763856452838629376 2016-08-11 21:55:44 UTC <Vva10967> @AC360 Yes, of course. But that was yesterday's news.  Did you just get back from vacation or something?

763854365132263425 2016-08-11 21:47:27 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN Someone should tell those Bernie supporters that Bernie has moved on.
763854086248796160 2016-08-11 21:46:20 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN she's the only one focusing on wall street quarterly reports & effect on stock as drivers for companies moving manufg abroad.
763852799197253632 2016-08-11 21:41:13 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN I'm pretty sure the Trump campaign changes its songs quite frequently due to the cease & desist letters it gets from artists
763850725877309440 2016-08-11 21:32:59 UTC <Vva10967> @danmericaCNN maybe U should trade places with your CNN colleague covering the Trump campaign? @KatyTurNBC can fill you in on their fun.
763842024781078528 2016-08-11 20:58:24 UTC <Vva10967> @ShimonPro @DrewGriffinCNN @danmericaCNN also this is completely MOOT under the Bob McDonnell SCOTUS decision. Stop creating fake scandals.

763749003569799168 2016-08-11 14:48:46 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @kilshaw_81 or are you a stupid Bernie Bro?  It's hard to tell you guys apart from the Trumpers, both stupid as a rock.
763748836078657536 2016-08-11 14:48:06 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @kilshaw_81 are you saying that  you believe Trump and/or the Republican party to be ethical? if so, I have a bridge to sell you
763615041702756352 2016-08-10 05:56:27 UTC <Vva10967> And then they wonder how they ended up with Trump as their nominee!https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/763491391855026176
763614091915194368 2016-08-10 05:52:41 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @kilshaw_81 and you should stop watching Faux. It's frying your brain. The 10% is grants. The 90% is work done by CGI employees.
763613130501029892 2016-08-10 05:48:52 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @kilshaw_81 newsflash: as SOS she was tasked with promoting American goods & that included military equipment , fracking, etc.

763610677583998976 2016-08-10 05:39:07 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn @KatyTurNBC according to @jaketapper and @CNN YES

763521761338134528 2016-08-10 23:45:48 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @kilshaw_81 You're confusing grants to 501c3s (the 10%) with the work done by the foundation itself, with PAID STAFF (the rest)
763517217589882880 2016-08-10 23:27:44 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @IlladelphAC @weatherfordbm Hillary and Bernie do.  Trump does not. He wrote letters to kick vet vendors off 5th Avenue in NYC.
763516780858015744 2016-08-10 23:26:00 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN @jaketapper Some charities are grantors, some do the work themselves and have payrolls. Clinton Found mixes 2 models.

763514742627590144 2016-08-10 23:17:54 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN @jaketapper The 10% are the grants to 501c3s. The rest of their work is done by employees who fall under Admin Expenses.
763513905595506689 2016-08-10 23:14:35 UTC <Vva10967> @HardballChris you SUCK interviewing Giuliani.  You let him get away with murder, not answer your questions and slander Hillary.

763501725026250752 2016-08-10 22:26:11 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper how about if U explain 2 your viewers what a foundation is, that money goes to charity & that Clintons don't take a salary.
763501094806904833 2016-08-10 22:23:40 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJ she was always facing it, one reason she was so pissed with Bernie is that he was fundraising for her primary challenger.
763497328573607936 2016-08-10 22:08:42 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews  Former Commerce Secretary and Kellogg CEO Carlos Gutierrez is now with Hillary. Gave up on Republican nominee.

763235593501478912 2016-08-09 04:48:40 UTC <Vva10967> @tribelaw It was Bernie who said that. Hillary said we have 1 POTUS at a time and she wouldn't  do it.

763119610942070789 2016-08-09 21:07:47 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica they don't do any preclearance for campaign events.  Pretty sure Trump doesn't either.  Not practical.
763118425522728961 2016-08-09 21:03:05 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou & why is @realDonaldTrump so worried about death taxes? is he terminally ill or something?
763117914916610049 2016-08-09 21:01:03 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh I think Trump just managed to grab the rest of the evening news' coverage w/his 2nd amendment suggestion to his followers re HRC

762487271907930112 2016-08-07 03:15:06 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn probably because of the down ballot Senate seat that would come with a large turnout for her.
762484336415289344 2016-08-07 03:03:26 UTC <Vva10967> @jmpalmieri been watching @HillaryClinton speeches & would suggest adding 5 min on her plans for military & vets as discussed in VFW speech.

762478264895975424 2016-08-07 02:39:19 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk Thanks, I actually read this before and you should too as it proves my point. The 2 line summary says it all.
762452607415693317 2016-08-07 00:57:21 UTC <Vva10967> @state @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk The AOL server IS a private server owned by AOL. We don't know what he sent bc he never turned in his emails
762451273337614340 2016-08-07 00:52:03 UTC <Vva10967> @iluvbkk no, it's just trashy, period.  Even the Melania nude photos were trashy.
762450785242263552 2016-08-07 00:50:07 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk No, they knew before, about 2 months before wikileaks.
762450602332794880 2016-08-07 00:49:23 UTC <Vva10967> @state @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk did it bother you when Colin Powell did it and then told State that he didn't save ANY of his aol emails?
762450342181113857 2016-08-07 00:48:21 UTC <Vva10967> @iluvbkk You should try reading less trashy papers, just saying.
762449954778460160 2016-08-07 00:46:49 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk you're confusing the FOIA issue with the classified info issue. Read the Politifact article. It may enlighten you.

762447636083281920 2016-08-07 00:37:36 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk they CAN, they could with State, DOD, White House, even DNC.
762446891036528641 2016-08-07 00:34:39 UTC <Vva10967> @ninaturner @JoyAnnReid @iluvbkk BOTTOM LINE is that @SenSanders LIED TO YOU.It's normal to earn that much $$$ in NYC speeches. Obama will 2
762446654322520064 2016-08-07 00:33:42 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @ninaturner @JoyAnnReid @iluvbkk YEP, for 20 minutes. She gave over 100 speeches, was most admired woman in the world for 20 yrs
762446230777569280 2016-08-07 00:32:01 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk they CAN tell when a system gets hacked, did so with State Dept, DOD and White House.  That was 100% Comey speculating
762445882415419393 2016-08-07 00:30:38 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk Whatever security it had was superior to security at the State Dept, DOD & White House. All 3 got hacked. Hers didn't.
762445003801042944 2016-08-07 00:27:09 UTC <Vva10967> @EricBoehlert they could start talking about the landslide that could take the House away from GOP too instead of boring us with her emails
762443764602253314 2016-08-07 00:22:13 UTC <Vva10967> @Beansiesdaddy Can't fix stupid so I'm not even gonna try.

762442685936381952 2016-08-07 00:17:56 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk And it was NEVER hacked, unlike the State Department system, the DOD and the White House.
762442511780421632 2016-08-07 00:17:14 UTC <Vva10967> @ChrisJZullo @iluvbkk she used her husband's existing private server.  It's just a PC with more HDs and RAM & different OS.  Big F Deal.

762440512900964352 2016-08-07 00:09:18 UTC <Vva10967> @thefix why would she give U a press conference when all you're going to ask are about her unfavorability and emails? #HillaryCoverageIsCrap
762431840749707264 2016-08-07 23:34:50 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid i disagree with @ninaturner. @SenSanders HAS to explain to his followers how Electoral College works. Voting 3rd party = Trump.
762356143834460160 2016-08-07 18:34:03 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 key is that if we get the House, economic relief needs to be felt ASAP or we'll lose it in 2018. That was Obama's mistake.
762355816213143552 2016-08-07 18:32:45 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 also (1) student debt refinancing.It's easy to fix & will give economic relief to millions AND (2) minimum wage increase now
762355112648015873 2016-08-07 18:29:57 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 also fixing ACA since premiums are going up too quickly. Mistake in ACA was to have bulk of fixes kick in 2014 and not 2010.
762354822976827393 2016-08-07 18:28:48 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 both immigration reform AND infrastructure spending. Obama wasted time with ACA & IR by letting GOP write bills.  HRC won't.
762154879603314689 2016-08-06 05:14:18 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 media wants a horse race so keeps giving negative spin to all stories about Hillary,even misquotes her at Q& A
762154234544582656 2016-08-06 05:11:44 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 do you believe her negatives are justified? Because Trump's are, he's earned them with every word coming out of his mouth!
762153141903224832 2016-08-06 05:07:23 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @JoyAnnReid isn't it weird that Jill Stein is also friendly with Putin? Was at same dinner as Flynn!https://twitter.com/zatchry/status/762053019563282432
762151789860888576 2016-08-06 05:02:01 UTC <Vva10967> Hey @jaketapper maybe you should investigate this. She's spending big on advertising toohttps://twitter.com/vabvox/status/762069027975987201
762141687401574402 2016-08-06 04:21:52 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica @sandrabarahonam Obama paso el DACA y el DAPA y los Republicanos le bloquearon el DAPA.  E insisto, que amargada que estas.
762139610810023936 2016-08-06 04:13:37 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica @sandrabarahonam No, Obama es quien ha expulsado mas ilegales.  Los democratas han apoyado y apoyan una reforma migratoria.
762138852224036864 2016-08-06 04:10:36 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica @sandrabarahonam y tu, que amargada estas. Ojala no seas ilegal porque el Donald te va a botar si lo eligen.
762138446102233088 2016-08-06 04:09:00 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica @sandrabarahonam oh Donald Trump y los Republicanos si van a hacer algo, DEPORTAR a los 11 millones de ilegales ASAP.
762137934959087616 2016-08-06 04:06:58 UTC <Vva10967> @thefix @peterdaou Chris Cilliza @TheFix must be a very bitter person, he's always spewing venom while pretending to be a journalist.
762119472719224832 2016-08-06 02:53:36 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica Los Republicanos ya mataron la Reforma Migratoria una vez, y si no votan por Democratas para el Congreso, lo haran de nuevo. 3/
762119096821510145 2016-08-06 02:52:06 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica el partido que controla la Casa de Representantes controla su agenda legislativa y si no votan democrata sera Paul Ryan 2/
762118598676611072 2016-08-06 02:50:08 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica el DACA y el DAPA dependen 100% de quien sea elegido Presidente.  Si es Hillary, sobreviven. Si es Trump los elimina.
762117987298082816 2016-08-06 02:47:42 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica por eso tienen que votar DEMOCRATA en TODA la boleta, aunque les gusten sus actuales Congresistas Republicanos. 1/

762056402814824448 2016-08-06 22:42:59 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper And No Questions that Jill Stein is crazier and far more dangerous than even Trump. She also believes WiFi gives U brain cancer!
762055614512201728 2016-08-06 22:39:51 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes @DwarfToss And who do you think that the Republican led House is going to choose? DUH!
762022398464036864 2016-08-06 20:27:52 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes Electoral College makes it a binary choice. Third party votes are Votes For Trump. Only voting for Hillary can stop Trump.
761934879315615745 2016-08-06 14:40:05 UTC <Vva10967> @nytpolitics @nytimes she said she may have short-circuit IT, not that SHE short-circuited.  READ the F TRANSCRIPT!

761711157254193152 2016-08-05 23:51:06 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas Si queremos ver una reforma migratoria, debemos votar Democrata no solo por Presidente sino tambien por Senado y Congreso
761710932879966208 2016-08-05 23:50:12 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas Obama perdio tiempo tratando de convencer a Republicanos q trabajaran con el de modo bipartidista. Hillary sabe a q atenerce.

761654489552187392 2016-08-05 20:05:55 UTC <Vva10967> @edatpost @OpHaveItAll why would she if all media ever asks is about her emails & then repeats that she's untrustworthy and unlikable?
761653756396199936 2016-08-05 20:03:01 UTC <Vva10967> @edatpost no, she said (1) that Comey said her testimony was truthful and (2) that her testimony was consistent with her public statements.
761652912955285504 2016-08-05 19:59:39 UTC <Vva10967> @edatpost STOP THE SEXISM WITH HILLARY.  You've been asking the same STUPID question for 40 years.  ENOUGH.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSYZ12LGVxw

760958035187621888 2016-08-03 21:58:28 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh the media has labelled Kaine boring. Not sure why they bother covering Pence who is just as boring, maybe 2 C if he's embarrassed
760585707337515008 2016-08-02 21:18:58 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow saw this clip of you with @HardballChris.  I would LOVE to see a full segment discussing sexism & HRC https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WVc-yn1pOI
760576192223346688 2016-08-02 20:41:09 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @AlanKestrel750 @GatorJoe74 They had the right to bitch back, but considering going after him on religious grounds crossed line.
760574413829988354 2016-08-02 20:34:05 UTC <Vva10967> @newrepublic @JoyAnnReid They all seem blind to the fact that the GOP has gone racist & that the accelerator was the election of Obama.
760358469098700800 2016-08-01 06:16:00 UTC <Vva10967> @fusion @jorgeramosnews Not far enough because they won't disavow him and still support him
760352617948209152 2016-08-01 05:52:45 UTC <Vva10967> @greenfield64 I would not, would make me barf the entire time to see @hughhewitt and I KNOW I am not alone.
760352258823421952 2016-08-01 05:51:19 UTC <Vva10967> @greenfield64 Republicans haven't been country first since Mitch McConnell said they would make Barack Obama a one term President in 2009.
760331346376060929 2016-08-01 04:28:13 UTC <Vva10967> @SenJohnMcCain @JoyAnnReid Party Over Country.  SAD!
760324535954571264 2016-08-01 04:01:10 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh Chicken Trump is good.  The Berners already made the GIFs of the chicken w the Trump head in front of Trump Tower, was cool.
760240524473298944 2016-08-01 22:27:20 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Sanders gets more credit for his 13MM voters than Hillary did for her 18MM voters in 2008.  Truth is he lost by a landslide.
760236738879127552 2016-08-01 22:12:17 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 she should get a bigger bounce next week as Trump & his surrogates continue to trash the Khans.
760236001008742400 2016-08-01 22:09:21 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein oh it will last, Trump can't manage to keep his mouth shut.  He and his surrogates are doubling down on disparaging the Khans.
760234662249791488 2016-08-01 22:04:02 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid it's pretty easy for his opponent to turn all the comments Little Marco made about Trump during the primary into a killer ad.
760234185990762496 2016-08-01 22:02:09 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Do we know how Little Marco is polling in Florida?
760232294531604480 2016-08-01 21:54:38 UTC <Vva10967> @ninaturner @joanwalsh would be the new Ralph Nader, aka DC pariah since W fiasco in 2000.

760150760306962433 2016-08-01 16:30:38 UTC <Vva10967> @CNN but @SenJohnMcCain and the GOP STILL SUPPORT TRUMP.  You CANNOT have it BOTH WAYS.  Still Party over Country.
760004683360571393 2016-07-31 06:50:11 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid did you see that Jill Stein is now trying to talk Nina Turner into joining her as VP?
760001994648092673 2016-07-31 06:39:30 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow LOVED your show. U & @maddow are the best. Smart & engaging, a breath of fresh air in a sea of sexist election coverage elsewhere
759609062157914113 2016-07-30 04:38:07 UTC <Vva10967> @CornelWest @AlanKestrel750 @cornelwest is a priviledged SOB who like @SusanSarandon wants to get Trump elected just to see the country burn.
759607143741923329 2016-07-30 04:30:30 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 I don't understand why @billmaher gives him a mic to spew his nonsense and doesn't call him out 4 his hatred of POTUS & HRC
759275306914050052 2016-07-29 06:31:54 UTC <Vva10967> @eldiariony Es una charlatana como lo fue Ralph Nader en el 2000.
759275089783164928 2016-07-29 06:31:02 UTC <Vva10967> @eldiariony la que engana es ella. La eleccion la gana la candidata q obtenga 270 votos del colegio electoral y es todo o nada por estado
759201842945458176 2016-07-29 01:39:59 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Tim yes. Hillary no, I've always seen her as a super achiever.
759175780832317441 2016-07-29 23:56:25 UTC <Vva10967> @Snowden can Russia hack the voting machines to change the results of the US elections?

759164860760518657 2016-07-29 23:13:02 UTC <Vva10967> @hardball @HardballChris @MichaelLaRosaDC Started watching @Hardball 2day & nearly barfed listening to @hughhewitt.I'm not alone he kills your ratings
759154664763977728 2016-07-29 22:32:31 UTC <Vva10967> @bamasevere but after getting 2 know her & working w/ her, he now ADMIRES her & believes she's the MOST QUALIFIED CANDIDATE for POTUS EVER.
758415125376278528 2016-07-27 21:33:51 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica es una minoria de sus seguidores.  El 90% de sus seguidores entienden el peligro q representa Trump y votaran por Hillary.
758196954782457856 2016-07-27 07:06:55 UTC <Vva10967> @marcorubio Little Marco you need to stop watching it on Faux. Try CSPAN.  Bet you would at least enjoy our A list celebrities & music.
758191164554108929 2016-07-26 06:43:54 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid She won NY in a landslide. NYers remembered her work following 911.
758056423817355264 2016-07-26 21:48:30 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh looks like our schools have been failing for a long time.

758048401976156160 2016-07-26 21:16:37 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh why can't they move the hecklers from the front? it's annoying for the TV viewers who want to watch & listen to the speeches.
758048054725533696 2016-07-26 21:15:14 UTC <Vva10967> @ZekeJMiller Apparently people have no clue about conventions.  The nominee does NOT appear until the 4th day.  Trump did bc he had no clue
757827569181798400 2016-07-25 06:39:06 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC maybe the same ones he sent to Hawaii to look for POTUS birth certificate in 2011 LOL
757826414364139520 2016-07-25 06:34:31 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports Hillary's governing style is to LISTEN to people to determine what THEIR problems are and solve them, not impose her views
757642483065053184 2016-07-25 18:23:38 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper or it signals that she won't throw U under bus like so many other politicians do to save their skin. Loyalty is a Hillary trait.
757637978483200002 2016-07-25 18:05:44 UTC <Vva10967> @Lee_in_Iowa lol, he forgot to tell them that in his 1pm speech today.
757637681543319552 2016-07-25 18:04:34 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein I think Kaine is a very nice guy but lacks the excitement that Warren brings 2 stage. Hillary was more exciting candidate in 2008
757634355888095232 2016-07-25 17:51:21 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 @BernieSanders needs to spend more time attacking Trump & telling supporters HRC is ONLY way Dem platform gets implemented.
757633664570327040 2016-07-25 17:48:36 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 He convinced them that she's a "corporate whore" now it's hard to walk it back without admitting that he lied.
757633233412579329 2016-07-25 17:46:53 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC He convinced them that she is a "corporate whore". Now he has to figure out how to undo damage.
757625014648729601 2016-07-25 17:14:14 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid that's a protester cooling off.  Philly PD opened up fire hydrants so these fools wouldn't pass out in the 95F to 100F heat.
757623988747198464 2016-07-25 17:10:09 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid but except 4 the Bernie is Atheist thread all the other emails show is a very pissed DWS reacting to Sanders & Weaver TV attacks
757620266654654466 2016-07-25 16:55:22 UTC <Vva10967> @HuffPostBlog @McFaul they also show discussion re Bernie being an atheist to affect WV & KY results but it was NOT carried out. 2/
757619592533569540 2016-07-25 16:52:41 UTC <Vva10967> @HuffPostBlog @McFaul did author read the emails? they show bad blood & a pissed DWS & staff in April after Sanders & Weaver TV attacks. 1/
757440236997775360 2016-07-24 04:59:59 UTC <Vva10967> @neeratanden it's a consequence of Sanders choosing to attack HRC for her paid speeches.  He should have been forced to come clean on that.
757431853280292864 2016-07-24 04:26:40 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 sounds false. Obama & Biden have both traveled to FL 2 campaign for DWS & she's being moved to HRC's 50 State effort
757272267906748417 2016-07-24 17:52:32 UTC <Vva10967> @DemConvention when is Senator Warren speaking? I can't find her on the schedule.  Thanks.
757267530071183360 2016-07-24 17:33:43 UTC <Vva10967> @dilemmv but Sanders' campaign kept scapegoating DWS & DNC for his failure to turn up more voterd than HRC, creating bad blood w them.
757261525426069504 2016-07-24 17:09:51 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto bueno, no es una "posibilidad," Trump ha dicho claramente q si gana VA a eliminar DACA y tambien DAPA (q sigue en litigio).
757251876840697856 2016-07-24 16:31:31 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 but poll is from last year & reflected how Latinos felt against Little Marco who is fluent & also Cruz who isn't too fluent
757251432630353921 2016-07-24 16:29:45 UTC <Vva10967> @edatpost @WPJohnWagner that poll is old and reflected sentiment against Cruz and Rubio who spoke Spanish but were against Latinos.
757244340011933696 2016-07-24 16:01:34 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @JoyAnnReid is getting under Assange's thin skin, lol.
757243967020883968 2016-07-24 16:00:05 UTC <Vva10967> @Billthemanhall Sanders campaign has scapegoated DWS since they got caught accessing HRC supporter database, so bad blood was 2 B expected
757242504874000384 2016-07-24 15:54:16 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper DNC leadership's bad blood towards Sanders campaign when Sanders has been scapegoating them 4 his failures is now a "scandal"?
757240729576075264 2016-07-24 15:47:13 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow and while they discussed it they did NOT carry it out.  Sanders lost KY regardless and won WV.
757240384384884737 2016-07-24 15:45:51 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow They've been scapegoating @RepDWStweets ever since they got caught accessing HRC supporter database so bad blood was 2 B expected
757239171400564736 2016-07-24 15:41:01 UTC <Vva10967> @thehill yeah but his followers R either w/ HRC or against her & those against her said they wouldn't vote for HRC even if she chose Warren
757062214272618496 2016-07-23 03:57:52 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @Alvarado4Senate @UniNoticias crear el mayor deficit fiscal en la historia del pais y duplicar la deuda nacional? nueva depresion?
757061782439690241 2016-07-23 03:56:09 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @Alvarado4Senate @UniNoticias deportar a los Dreamers y a los 11MM de indocumentados? No dejar entrar a ningun musulman?
756737853288288256 2016-07-22 06:28:58 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica Los hermanos Castro necesitan aprender espanol.
756615609211904000 2016-07-22 22:23:13 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Castro got in trouble this week for violating an arcane rule about campaigning during a K Couric int http://bloom.bg/29TVxw2
756614568793743360 2016-07-22 22:19:05 UTC <Vva10967> @aseitzwald Obama announced day before DNC started so she should announce on Sunday. She's in Miami area tomorrow (Sat) so unlikely.
756613381809995778 2016-07-22 22:14:22 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Warren told Colbert she's speaking on Mon yet program replaced her w Bernie 4 Mon so I hope media is wrong & HRC chooses her
756603797691101184 2016-07-22 21:36:17 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 announcing the VP pick today would shift media attention from fact checking the Donald's speech. Obama announced day bf DNC
756602213628272641 2016-07-22 21:29:59 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto El partido Republicano es ahora el partido de Trump, aceptenlo.  El voto Hispano y AfroAmericano puede vencerlo votando por Hillary
756381942296240128 2016-07-21 06:54:42 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid what is it with these campaigns this year self describing as "movements"?  Hillary got over 3MM more votes & she's not doing it.
756380729915875328 2016-07-21 06:49:53 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @KyleLeith and yet it was Ivanka & her brothers that chose Pence, the most anti gay & anti woman VP ever
756375356261687296 2016-07-21 06:28:32 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @johnpodesta THIS would really excite the base! #GoBigAndBold Warren also manages media well.https://twitter.com/colbertlateshow/status/756345494058696704
756364567278739456 2016-07-21 05:45:40 UTC <Vva10967> @mattyglesias Comey deserves it, violated DOJ rules & gave talking points in a case where he recommended NO charges.  One liner is norm.
756359993063006208 2016-07-21 05:27:29 UTC <Vva10967> @BrFleurantin I think it's more a combination of Faux News brainwashing its viewers, reality TV dumbing down people & failing schools.
756356595811057664 2016-07-21 05:13:59 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton Warren is also best person 4 talking to blue collar workers who feel left out & students in debt & explaining YOUR plans. 2/
756355945677123584 2016-07-21 05:11:24 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton just finished watching Warren on Colbert. PLEASE go BIG & BOLD. Trump is too dangerous & WARREN IS BEST AT DEBUNKING him 1/
756206954062704640 2016-07-21 19:19:22 UTC <Vva10967> @JasStanford They're all cabinet members. WH chief of staff issued directive prohibiting cabinet secys from speaking at 2016 DNC.
755997079000981504 2016-07-20 05:25:24 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton even POTUS Obama was unable to find an effective explainer in chief to sell Obamacare to public.  Warren has that skill. 3/
755996514779074560 2016-07-20 05:23:09 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton Warren's communication skills will also help U sell your agenda to the public once elected & mobilize support for it. 2/
755995712865861632 2016-07-20 05:19:58 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton look at Warren's FB page, she's a great communicator & able to explain things effectively to voters, like no other VP can.1/
755945140158664706 2016-07-20 01:59:00 UTC <Vva10967> @NPR because it is REPUBLICANS that view Clinton unfavorable since 90s.  Trump is Trump and has EARNED his unfavorables with his rhetoric.
755944439227572228 2016-07-20 01:56:13 UTC <Vva10967> @SenTedCruz @TelemundoNews omitio la parte donde los Dems firman ley de derechos civiles y de voto y los racistas se cambian a Republicanos
755943453347971072 2016-07-20 01:52:18 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica Republicans forget that Christianity should be about Christ's teachings, like helping the poor & sick, which they don't follow.
755942286127693824 2016-07-20 01:47:40 UTC <Vva10967> @Alvarado4Senate @UniPolitica Pero el charlatan q promueve una politica de dictador tercer mundista es Trump, no Hillary.
755941841766416385 2016-07-20 01:45:54 UTC <Vva10967> @Alvarado4Senate @UniPolitica fallado como? Si Hillary aun no es presidenta! Trump tu candidato promueve racismo y xenofobia contra Latinos.

755923183132352512 2016-07-20 00:31:45 UTC <Vva10967> @AC360 Trump's plan for firing people is not limited to politicians but includes the civil service too.

755832855503175680 2016-07-20 18:32:50 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid can you mention this or show it to @billmaher?  I think it needs attention.  The rhetoric has cross the line.
755832610878787584 2016-07-20 18:31:51 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid please tell @billmaher that if he continues attacking Hillary we'll end up with President Trump. They are NOT equals.
755830000306294784 2016-07-20 18:21:29 UTC <Vva10967> @Pandorabalks that's what people keep saying, yet here we are, and he's the Party of Trump's nominee.
755820714784133120 2016-07-20 17:44:35 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid She probably also admires Hillary, lol.  Up until recently so did Donald Trump.

755814509202341889 2016-07-20 17:19:56 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 I'm inclined to believe that it was the Donald himself who did the plagiarizing as a publicity stunt in John Barron style.
755813903901351936 2016-07-20 17:17:31 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid and yes I know that a staffer has taken the blame but he who likes to fire people didn't fire the staffer, bet he did it himself
755813611805835264 2016-07-20 17:16:22 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Given his John Barron history, I'm inclined to believe that it was the Donald himself who did the plagiarizing for publicity.
755813293370052608 2016-07-20 17:15:06 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC given his John Barron history I am more inclined to believe that it was the Donald himself who did the plagiarizing.

755631964355436544 2016-07-19 05:14:33 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro do U ever look at yourself in the mirror & take responsibility for your role in helping Trump rise? YOU put Hillary down 24/7. STOP.
755630656579928070 2016-07-19 05:09:22 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro You keep parroting that. Why do you hate her so much? I always see you attacking her on MSNBC.  Are you a closeted Trump supporter?
755627301648404480 2016-07-19 04:56:02 UTC <Vva10967> @serena_alway he cannot get over it, @jbarro hates Hillary.  He's always undermining her credibility on MSNBC. Maybe he was a BernieBro?
755626822889566208 2016-07-19 04:54:08 UTC <Vva10967> @DrPizza @jbarro FOIA never gave YOU the right to read her private emails & under statute SHE got to decide what was personal & what wasn't.
755626404990025732 2016-07-19 04:52:28 UTC <Vva10967> @jbarro Neither does YOUR constant undermining of Hillary nor the cheap shots you take whenever you speak of her.  Y do U hate her so much?

755268611556737024 2016-07-18 05:10:43 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica es consistente con el mensaje de Trump q explota el odio de la base Republicana hacia los immigrantes Latinos.

754724856374198273 2016-07-17 17:10:02 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow what happens with the rest of your show?  was looking forward to the interviews from OH that you had previewed in your timeline
754724474184929281 2016-07-17 17:08:31 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow I would think she expected him to express more outrage and/or to visit with the families as he has done in the mass shootings
754553962771152896 2016-07-16 05:50:58 UTC <Vva10967> @NPR because Johnson & his party's platform R fringe & Jill is an opportunist. And it's Republicans that dislike Clinton. Dems love her.
754550401811316737 2016-07-16 05:36:49 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn Vilsack was behind Dark Act which preempts right of states to require GMO labeling & just passed Congress.  Not good.
754548336720478208 2016-07-16 05:28:36 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn Vilsack is also pro TPP & him being on ticket would reinforce belief that she is too even if she says she is not.

754435628742414336 2016-07-16 22:00:45 UTC <Vva10967> @aseitzwald @albamonica Progressives associate Vilsack with Monsanto. Few things are more revolting to the left than Monsanto. Big NO.

754431493573935104 2016-07-16 21:44:19 UTC <Vva10967> @johnpodesta True but let's make sure WE don't pick Vilsack who to Progressives represents Monsanto, the evil corporation.
754065581511499776 2016-07-15 21:30:19 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 @kpoldy given how unpopular Pence is in IN, there should be no effect, lol.  Similar to Christie in NJ.
754021914906099712 2016-07-15 18:36:48 UTC <Vva10967> @joanwalsh and they've substituted Elizabeth Warren with Bernie for Monday, so there's still hope she can be chosen as the VP!
754018325907267588 2016-07-15 18:22:32 UTC <Vva10967> @POTUS please keep your campaign promise & #vetoDarkActhttps://twitter.com/OrganicConsumer/status/754017713434005505
754017544122593284 2016-07-15 18:19:26 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Warren is off the Monday speaking lineup!  Has been substituted by Bernie. http://bit.ly/29WMmfH Maybe Go Bold is winning?
754015998571864068 2016-07-15 18:13:17 UTC <Vva10967> Too funny!https://twitter.com/FullFrontalSamB/status/754005058786910208
754012354103377921 2016-07-15 17:58:48 UTC <Vva10967> @POTUS please veto the Dark Act.  We have the right to know in plain English what is in our food.  Thank You.https://twitter.com/OrganicConsumer/status/754003878731980800
754008653301157889 2016-07-15 17:44:06 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews tambien esta en contra de una reforma migratoria.
754006180054392832 2016-07-15 17:34:16 UTC <Vva10967> @michaelgoodin don't be too sure.  This election is unusual & the conventional wisdom isn't prevailing. HRC still needs the youth vote.
754000678767452162 2016-07-15 17:12:25 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Also even listening to Theresa May in the UK, we seem to be riding a strong populist wave & that's Warren, not Kaine.
754000316991807488 2016-07-15 17:10:58 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid She's staying to the far left in her post-Primary speeches so she might as well add Warren's excitement to the ticket.
753998845873364992 2016-07-15 17:05:08 UTC <Vva10967> @MFItrader that's clearly NOT Comey's testimony. Your hate for Hillary BLINDS you but it doesn't change fact that she's honest & will win.
753779006651113472 2016-07-14 02:31:34 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid he didn't just "suggest it", he posted a video to FB saying he didn't know about it & won't be going. https://www.facebook.com/TimTebow/?fref=ts
753773535139622912 2016-07-14 02:09:49 UTC <Vva10967> @MFItrader you must have missed the part where Comey says to the GOP buffoon that @HillaryClinton didn't lie.
753772248352325632 2016-07-14 02:04:43 UTC <Vva10967> @ErikWemple @jaketapper is right. Trump wants to ban you.Hillary just ignores you.She might stop ignoring you if you all stop attacking her.
753765052457648128 2016-07-14 01:36:07 UTC <Vva10967> @wcbs880 you must not be polling the 17 million that voted for @HillaryClinton.  I assure you we are VERY EXCITED that #SheIsOurNominee
753764919749799936 2016-07-14 01:35:35 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNewYork you must not be polling the 17 million that voted for @HillaryClinton.  I assure you we are VERY EXCITED that #SheIsOurNominee
753753054776848384 2016-07-14 00:48:26 UTC <Vva10967> @JackAnderson75 & I'm not saying they would succeed, but they would go through the effort just like they did with Bill over perjury.
753751946717196288 2016-07-14 00:44:02 UTC <Vva10967> @JackAnderson75 a President Warren to them is worse than a President HRC. They could live with a President Kaine.  They impeached Bill.
753712780084187141 2016-07-14 22:08:24 UTC <Vva10967> @JackAnderson75 yeah but that would also encourage the Deranged party to try to impeach Hillary once she's POTUS.  Not so with Warren as VP.
753688415934218240 2016-07-14 20:31:35 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @duke_gail Vilsack = Monsanto.  Even I would have a really HARD time defending that choice.
753687323406135297 2016-07-14 20:27:15 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid he's ok as a surrogate but lacks the excitement & energy of Warren. Don't see how he'd excite young voters. Even MSNBC moved on.
753686475254931456 2016-07-14 20:23:53 UTC <Vva10967> @dilemmv MSNBC was too, they stopped broadcasting the event in the middle of Kaine's remarks (speech?).
753684408872345601 2016-07-14 20:15:40 UTC <Vva10967> @gdebenedetti even MSNBC dropped their coverage in the middle of his speech, too boring.
753681295067213824 2016-07-14 20:03:18 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow she needs to listen to her own speech about needing to go big and bold, lol.
753612248191467520 2016-07-14 15:28:56 UTC <Vva10967> @JerryMarkon Nop.  Justice O'Connor didn't in Bush v Gore and she had spoken out against Gore.  #precedent.
753451952416157696 2016-07-13 04:51:58 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Like in Back to the Future, lol.  With the Donald playing Biff Tannen.
753391087822274560 2016-07-13 00:50:07 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 lol they must really want to isolate themselves from the rest of the world.
753288416905814017 2016-07-13 18:02:08 UTC <Vva10967> @kasie she should have added the FBI & the DOJ, which as we've seen can be and ARE USED for political witch hunts.
753241188325552128 2016-07-13 14:54:28 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews GOP always plays on people's fears and anger.  Remember how Ebola was going to kill us all? Yet crisis went away day after election
753240636799713280 2016-07-13 14:52:17 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper & the media plays along.Why don't you instead answer RBG's question of How he's gotten away w/not turning over his tax returns?
753094855589556224 2016-07-12 05:13:00 UTC <Vva10967> @StephenAtHome @colbertlateshow Those were really cheap shots, expected a lot better from you & your writers. Neither clever nor funny.
753092624236548096 2016-07-12 05:04:08 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow @JoyAnnReid Looks like only @HillaryClinton will be addressing the NAACP convention after all.https://twitter.com/paleblueeyes24/status/753079324597743616
753090016184860673 2016-07-12 04:53:46 UTC <Vva10967> @SenWarren @johnpodesta as VP would keep Deranged Republicans from trying to impeach @HillaryClinton once sworn in. They hate Warren more.
753088774347886592 2016-07-12 04:48:50 UTC <Vva10967> @johnpodesta Warren as VP is only effective deterrent against Deranged Republicans trying to impeach Hillary after she is sworn in.
753087613230342146 2016-07-12 04:44:13 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews @RalphNader @ThisIsAmerica said the man who gave us George W. Bush...
753071395609964544 2016-07-12 03:39:46 UTC <Vva10967> @fusion @jorgeramosnews you must be one of the few remaining outlets that give Nader a microphone. Everyone else blames him for W Bush.
753068644737900545 2016-07-12 03:28:50 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki @elizabethforma certainly could beat him.
752700389544394752 2016-07-11 03:05:32 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Saw a tweet from BernieOrBust earlier asking folks to show up in NH at 9am w "Don't Endorse" & "NeverHillary" signs.
752667099152211968 2016-07-11 00:53:14 UTC <Vva10967> @kasie also @elizabethforma ensures deranged Republicans won't try to impeach @HillaryClinton after she's sworn in.  They hate Warren more.
752666034902077440 2016-07-11 00:49:01 UTC <Vva10967> @kasie Probably right.  Hillary's staying to left & not pivoting to center so Y would she pick a center VP? Seems she's riding populist wave
752664188766552064 2016-07-11 00:41:41 UTC <Vva10967> @JebBush @UniPolitica No porque va a perder la eleccion.  De nosotros los Latinos depende q el pais no entre en una nueva recesion economica
752660232266997760 2016-07-11 00:25:57 UTC <Vva10967> The Republican witch hunts of @HillaryClinton will not stop until we vote them out Send message #VoteBlueNoMatterWhohttps://twitter.com/oliverdarcy/status/752624638543486976

752656729649840128 2016-07-11 00:12:02 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon Hillary needs @elizabethforma as her VP.  Only deterrent to deranged Republicans trying to impeach her after she wins in Nov.
752536217737199617 2016-07-11 16:13:10 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou aside from the content, the editing is awful.  A 10 yr old can edit videos better, lol.
752531102665965568 2016-07-11 15:52:50 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports Never noticed how short Christie is lol. Also don't understand how he cannot lose weight w/ gastric band that he had put in?
752357618266566657 2016-07-10 04:23:28 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow we now know that @HillaryClinton will be speaking on Mon7/18 at NAACP's conference & that would be a high bar for Trump to follow
752355434850316288 2016-07-10 04:14:48 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @amjoyshow @JoyAnnReid LOVED the show!  You & @Maddow are the best @MSNBC shows.  Great choice of panelists too.
752353112917217280 2016-07-10 04:05:34 UTC <Vva10967> @thedailybeast so you prefer pie in the sky, fairies, pixie dust, unicorns & empty slogans instead of policies that are paid for? #ImWithHer
752348816330948612 2016-07-10 03:48:30 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @joanwalsh @amjoyshow you know @SenWarren would keep Republicans from trying to impeach @HillaryClinton once she becomes POTUS

752174791193403392 2016-07-10 16:16:59 UTC <Vva10967> @JustAnotherRich @nytimesdowd hope you're able to handle Bernie's endorsement of HRC on Tuesday, LOL. #PresidentObamaNotBarry #ImWithHer

751920587644153856 2016-07-09 23:26:52 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 she can explain it as she'd be decriminalizing it at fed level & letting states make their own decisions,which would be true
751919482285723648 2016-07-09 23:22:29 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Trudeau announced he'll be pardoning all Canadian prisoners convicted of a marijuana offense. Dems should do it too.
751916426164838400 2016-07-09 23:10:20 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 sounds like he needs psychiatric help BADLY.  What a loser.

751819406389473281 2016-07-09 16:44:49 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 2/ that he lost because the election was "rigged"? doesn't he have to expressly say that neither is true?
751819076087975937 2016-07-09 16:43:30 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 1/ so how does Bernie bring his followers into the tent after he convinced them that HRC is a "corporate whore" &
751648548580712448 2016-07-08 05:25:53 UTC <Vva10967> @benchmarkpol HRC - Warren & Trump-Gingrich
751631694491480065 2016-07-08 04:18:55 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou exactly, with emails media chose to parrot Comey's GOP talking points instead of investigating further including his motives.
751626548567048192 2016-07-08 03:58:28 UTC <Vva10967> @JenGranholm Racism is alive and well and Faux and right wing keep it that way.

751235641447514114 2016-07-07 02:05:08 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 and Chaffetz uses a freaking GMAIL address for official business, it's in his Congressional business card!
751235069960974340 2016-07-07 02:02:52 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 they're probably just going to rebuke Comey's public criticism of their email practices.

751064937087336449 2016-07-07 14:46:49 UTC <Vva10967> @MaddowBlog @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow @CNN @MSNBC @chrislhayes @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews @AC360 & http://wapo.st/29xGl8Whttps://twitter.com/matthewamiller/status/750761605567287296
751063520670867456 2016-07-07 14:41:12 UTC <Vva10967> @RepCummings @OversightDems Comey needs to B questionned on why he provide talking points when DOJ rules prohibit it http://wapo.st/29xGl8W
751060784076165120 2016-07-07 14:30:19 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes here let me help you.Look into the CONTENT of the emails. Then you would understand why FBI had no case http://bit.ly/29y79Gf
751059046942343169 2016-07-07 14:23:25 UTC <Vva10967> @SpeakerRyan you need to read this since apparently Comey didn't brief you on content of "classified" emails: http://bit.ly/29y79Gf
751058316671979520 2016-07-07 14:20:31 UTC <Vva10967> @SpeakerRyan & the 8th thread was about a call to the President of Malawi & was classified bc all calls to heads of state are. 2/
751057881684930560 2016-07-07 14:18:47 UTC <Vva10967> @SpeakerRyan Comey did tell you that the 7 of 8 threads were classified BECAUSE they mentioned CIA's drone program which press knew about?1/
751057041926582272 2016-07-07 14:15:27 UTC <Vva10967> @SpeakerRyan So @realDonaldTrump can get these briefings and @HillaryClinton cannot?  SERIOUSLY?
750910581318844416 2016-07-06 04:33:28 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon oh that will go over well. I suppose that's one way for Dems to win back the House, lol.
750905246122139648 2016-07-06 04:12:16 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow can you do a story on Comey's remarks re Hillary's emails? They were misleading.  See article:  http://bit.ly/29y79Gf
750904837081014272 2016-07-06 04:10:38 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow Thought you'd be hosting @hardball tonight too?  was mostly Trump's Cincinnati speech =-(
750904211546726400 2016-07-06 04:08:09 UTC <Vva10967> @RepCummings in case you end up interrogating Comey tomorrow, please ask him about this: http://bit.ly/29y79Gf
750901079236304901 2016-07-06 03:55:43 UTC <Vva10967> @PolitikMasFina only Trump would think of making his golf caddy his campaign's social media director, lol.
750899007132667904 2016-07-06 03:47:28 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki here, read these 2 articles so you can LEARN what Comey was referring to: http://bit.ly/29jfQn5  & http://bit.ly/29y79Gf
750890812599394304 2016-07-06 03:14:55 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica David Duke, el lider del KKK, no opina asi. Lo retuitio y le agrego nombres de donantes judios.
750790652150112256 2016-07-06 20:36:55 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 So is he saying that Bernie supporters sound like Republicans? LOL
750785210787229696 2016-07-06 20:15:17 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon will Dems attend?  Seems that we need @RepCummings there to cross examine Comey.
750724315809718272 2016-07-06 16:13:19 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJ @WSJPolitics Looks like Comey accepted & the hearing will be Thurs.Not surprised since Comey is a witch hunting Republican like Gowdy.
750723882647187456 2016-07-06 16:11:36 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJPolitics @WSJ If we hadn't taken out Gaddafi we'd have another Syria in Libya & you'll all be bitching about THAT instead
750720976472666113 2016-07-06 16:00:03 UTC <Vva10967> @PaulBegala he cleared her because he had no case.  He still gave GOP a roadmap to attack her violating Dept Rules.
750720544962674689 2016-07-06 15:58:20 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJPolitics @WSJ They should decline.  Separation of powers.  And Republicans in House need to stop wasting taxpayer $$$ in witch hunts.
750378787544698880 2016-07-05 17:20:18 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto Trump es un burro.  El fiscal q llevo el caso de Petraeus explico claramente porque no hay comparacion http://usat.ly/1KW0POD
750378113901686784 2016-07-05 17:17:38 UTC <Vva10967> @Eugene_Robinson @pavehawk2007 Comey never said MARKED & 4 a reason. The classification fight is about mentioning drones & comes from CIA.
750377270246776832 2016-07-05 17:14:17 UTC <Vva10967> @RealBenCarson @mitchellreports bad judgement? From the guy who supports Trump for President? ROFL!
750376804955938816 2016-07-05 17:12:26 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC no, that's the media's fault.  Why don't you all concentrate your efforts on Trump?  That's FULL of REAL scandals.
750374121045889024 2016-07-05 17:01:46 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes keep in mind that the mere mention of drones is deemed "[top]secret" by gov agencies as if media & public didn't know drones exist.
750353028583198721 2016-07-05 15:37:57 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 H.A. Goodman must be having a nervous breakdown, LOL.
750352675024281600 2016-07-05 15:36:33 UTC <Vva10967> @allinwithchris @chrislhayes keep in mind that gov considers any mention of drones as top secret or secret, as if the public didn't know.
750008986058055680 2016-07-04 16:50:51 UTC <Vva10967> @peterdaou yes @jbarro @mitchellreports and @chucktodd come to mind. They're playing a dangerous game trying to keep election as horse race.
750004024104091648 2016-07-04 16:31:08 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Nate Silver had best reply, lolpic.twitter.com/u8tGC5maaS
750003910186766336 2016-07-04 16:30:41 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Trump now says star was a Sheriff's star, LOL!pic.twitter.com/tp0TjOMKNj
750003302482542592 2016-07-04 16:28:16 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow but it gets better, LOL, Trump today is tweeting that the star is a Sheriff's star!pic.twitter.com/XRCWQUN8MT
749730183851151360 2016-07-03 22:22:59 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Dems are but Repubs aren't.  They have been fostering racism & xenophobia for decades & really strongly since Obama got elected.
749721511309737984 2016-07-03 21:48:32 UTC <Vva10967> @LaCasaBlanca @AlPunto si los medios les siguen dando tanta cobertura el que va a llegar a la Casa Blanca va a ser Trump.
749720881744715776 2016-07-03 21:46:02 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid not to defend him, but it may be that the white supremacists follow him & he's stupid enough to retweet them or save their memes
749633187454877696 2016-07-03 15:57:34 UTC <Vva10967> @KeithOlbermann but Trump got the original meme from a Neo Nazi site:http://bit.ly/29n9eUX
749624087727734785 2016-07-03 15:21:24 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC @FaceTheNation @MittRomney as Trump would say, LOSER, lol. Lacks courage to stand up & actually DO something to derail Trump.
749451562095874048 2016-07-02 03:55:51 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton well it's code for Make America WHITE Again.  David Duke & the KKK certainly understand it that way. #NeverTrump #IMWithHer
749342213176451072 2016-07-02 20:41:20 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports why do you hate @HillaryClinton so much?
749097741507112960 2016-07-01 04:29:53 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon how about having @POTUS return the favor from 2008 and nominate @HillaryClinton at the DNC Convention?  THAT would be AWESOME!
749000387152244736 2016-07-01 22:03:02 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Nooooo. Too boring.  She needs someone exciting to get the vote out.  #ClintonWarren2016
748971081923461120 2016-07-01 20:06:35 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto no es la primera vez, Johnson es el eterno candidato del partido libertariano.  En 2012 obtuvo menos del 1% del voto.
748754772975505408 2016-06-30 05:47:03 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica sin embargo el mismo Sanders no se atrevio a desmentir a Biden cuando Chris Hayes le pregunto si Biden habia  mentido
748753524872187909 2016-06-30 05:42:06 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 I think Slanders is waiting for July 8 bc he still thinks that he won CA from reading all the BernieBot memes
748588024095600640 2016-06-30 18:44:27 UTC <Vva10967> @davelevinthal 45 days seems awfully long.Most he should get are 10 days.The Senate is not even in session now bc of the 4th of July holiday
748581459749904384 2016-06-30 18:18:22 UTC <Vva10967> @Wade_Turnbull You must be a BernieBro.  Go read the 1st Amendment, it may do you some good, assuming you can comprehend it.
748378317787631616 2016-06-29 04:51:09 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica porque no pueden invitar solo a la candidata Democrata y no al Republicano y les repugna invitar a Trump
748369528892104705 2016-06-29 04:16:14 UTC <Vva10967> @USATODAY @amjoyshow Dude sounds like a brainwashed BernieBro.  Very similar to the young black woman from 6/28 Los Angeles townhall.
748273155861520388 2016-06-29 21:53:17 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica y culpa a los recortes q los Republicanos hicieron al presupuesto del Departamento De Estado por el ataque en Benghazi 2/
748272636971593728 2016-06-29 21:51:13 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica y la hermana del embajador Stevens dice q los Republicanos deben de parar de explotar la muerte de su hermano 1/
748268040748474369 2016-06-29 21:32:57 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper did God tell @marcorubio that?  or was it Trump whom he supports but doesn't endorse??? #GOPFarce
748267080156319744 2016-06-29 21:29:08 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM he should ask Scott Brown how well that worked for him, lol.
748195565977075716 2016-06-29 16:44:58 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein With or WO headshaving? Maybe 4 Act 2 Trump can have Clint Eastwood do an encore talk with the chair? LOLpic.twitter.com/MW01AanMEt
748193103320846337 2016-06-29 16:35:11 UTC <Vva10967> @BrosforBillary Trump has sealed the fate of the Latino/Hispanic vote, lol.
748192291668402177 2016-06-29 16:31:57 UTC <Vva10967> @middleclassnumb I thought "moderate Republicans" were an extinct species, lol. I think Warren excites the Dem base & helps get Dem vote out
747997992649621504 2016-06-28 03:39:53 UTC <Vva10967> @ananavarro are you sure this is still your party?  that's the same response that @jorgeramosnews got from Trump's security back in Aug 2015
747969990834388998 2016-06-28 01:48:37 UTC <Vva10967> @finneyk not just about trade, also about Hillary lol.
747969363714646016 2016-06-28 01:46:07 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid if U have the platform folks on @amjoyshow again can U ask them Y this wouldn't solve Fracking issue? Txhttps://twitter.com/Vva10967/status/747966290430681093
747967390844092416 2016-06-28 01:38:17 UTC <Vva10967> .@finneyk @neeratanden @keithellison seems to me that problem w Fracking can be resolved by revoking 2005 exemptionshttps://twitter.com/Vva10967/status/747966290430681093
747966290430681093 2016-06-28 01:33:54 UTC <Vva10967> @RepCummings 2005 Energy Policy Act exempted Fracking from Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act & CERCLA.Y Not Revoke it?
747944470377816064 2016-06-28 00:07:12 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 that cannot end well for the UK....he's giving the EU every incentive to screw the UK on trade.
747923659973591040 2016-06-28 22:44:30 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports Yet conclusion was the same: Diplomats could NOT have been saved.  Nice try Andrea! @HillaryClinton @NBCNightlyNews
747913071964852229 2016-06-28 22:02:26 UTC <Vva10967> @vineetagupta1 lol & I suggest that you not be so gullible. Tulsi is a politician like the rest. She probably didn't even write the email.
747911187455676417 2016-06-28 21:54:57 UTC <Vva10967> @vineetagupta1 so she thinks we should let Assad kill the rest of his people?
747910674848817152 2016-06-28 21:52:55 UTC <Vva10967> @vineetagupta1 @l0milesniper W had him post-911 in Afghanistan but let him go, wasn't interested in catching him. Obama & Hillary were & did
747909407292403712 2016-06-28 21:47:52 UTC <Vva10967> @l0milesniper @vineetagupta1 you shouldn't believe fundraising emails.  They're generally BS and count on folks being gullible.
747905293632299009 2016-06-28 21:31:32 UTC <Vva10967> @vineetagupta1 @l0milesniper No the idiot who ignored CIA memo on BinLaden attacks was W.  Too busy vacationing in TX. Even Trump agrees.
747904585516322818 2016-06-28 21:28:43 UTC <Vva10967> @vineetagupta1 The Middle East is ungovernable thanks to W. Everybody wanted Gov to kill Gaddafi after he freed PanAm bomber in oil 4UK deal
747685679677726721 2016-06-27 06:58:52 UTC <Vva10967> @Wade_Turnbull he worked for them and got paid. What's the big deal?
747684362884386816 2016-06-27 06:53:38 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Obama announced that Biden was his pick 2 days before Dem convention
747682009955307520 2016-06-27 06:44:17 UTC <Vva10967> @Wade_Turnbull exactly so why is it even newsworthy that Sid Blumenthal made $200k?
747681575962288130 2016-06-27 06:42:33 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid after Brexit can't see Wall Street not going never trump. They don't want a repeat of 2008 economic collapse.
747680207822274560 2016-06-27 06:37:07 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @tresec29 @Spectricide HRC values loyalty. He endorsed Obama in 2008 after being a Clinton Sec of Energy & UN Secretary
747675697083187200 2016-06-27 06:19:11 UTC <Vva10967> @vineetagupta1 why?  3000+ people died in the WTC and W didn't resign nor apologize. Happened under his watch AND in the homeland.
747674876874457088 2016-06-27 06:15:56 UTC <Vva10967> @Wade_Turnbull newsflash:  $200K is not an unusual salary for DC or NY.
747672438905909249 2016-06-27 06:06:15 UTC <Vva10967> @mattizcoop Sherrod is a nice guy but pretty unexciting too. HRC's speech w Warren was farther left than campaign has been so far.
747567889293651968 2016-06-27 23:10:48 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @FoxNews @CBSNews @ABC GOP had enough votes to pass bill regardless of HRC not voting.
747567705792843777 2016-06-27 23:10:04 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @FoxNews @CBSNews @ABC HRC didnt vote on 2005 bill bc Bill Clinton was having heart surgery that day 6/
747567236383182849 2016-06-27 23:08:12 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @FoxNews @CBSNews @ABC Bill came back in 2005 when GOP controlled both Senate & House  & passed. 5/
747566812431261696 2016-06-27 23:06:31 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @FoxNews @CBSNews @ABC child support claims. House version of bill didn't have amdts & bill died in reconciliation. 4/
747566414970630144 2016-06-27 23:04:57 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @FoxNews @CBSNews @ABC in Senate bill came up again & Chuck Schumer had amendments added to address priority of 3/

747565700345171968 2016-06-27 23:02:06 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @FoxNews @CBSNews @ABC Warren had her facts wrong in that interview. She objected to creditors claims being senior /1
747564397715939329 2016-06-27 22:56:56 UTC <Vva10967> @HeidiKlein9 it's not meant to get Bernie bots on board just the reasonable progressives that voted for him. The Cult is a lost cause.
747563500541718533 2016-06-27 22:53:22 UTC <Vva10967> @mattizcoop nop, she lacks the excitement that Warren generates in the base & the populism that voters seek.
747562569615970304 2016-06-27 22:49:40 UTC <Vva10967> @instapundit @mattizcoop we're not saying HRC should choose her BECAUSE Warren is a woman but because of who she is & what she represents
747555070397526016 2016-06-27 22:19:52 UTC <Vva10967> @WorldForBernie @damnpamfromnamm go charge that battery you fool.
747554801165164544 2016-06-27 22:18:48 UTC <Vva10967> @WorldForBernie @damnpamfromnamm If VT had been attacked instead of NY, Bernie would have voted FOR THE WAR. HRC represented NY in Senate.
747553432853159936 2016-06-27 22:13:21 UTC <Vva10967> @WorldForBernie @damnpamfromnamm She never said settle for $12. She has the votes for $12 & some cities in the South would go BROKE at $15
747552483308879873 2016-06-27 22:09:35 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper @yeomandroid To win against HRC, @BernieSanders needed to turn out >18 MM votes bc that's how many people voted 4 her in 2008.
747551920592658432 2016-06-27 22:07:21 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @jaketapper @yeomandroid she won fair & square.  There was NEVER a revolution, that was media nonsense created for ratings.
747551216884932608 2016-06-27 22:04:33 UTC <Vva10967> @WorldForBernie @damnpamfromnamm actually YOU are the ones who believe anything. All the nonsense that the GOP has been promoting for years.
747550745566785538 2016-06-27 22:02:41 UTC <Vva10967> @WorldForBernie @damnpamfromnamm Not true. You're either reading GOP nonsense or can't read financials.Get an education,may help U get a job
747550157038850048 2016-06-27 22:00:20 UTC <Vva10967> @damnpamfromnamm He's on his OWN side, along with his HUGE ego & the fools who make up his Cult. U worship a mythical Bernie.
747549376017477632 2016-06-27 21:57:14 UTC <Vva10967> @ninaturner how come @BernieSanders tolerates his followers calling HRC "a whore"? Comes from his slanders on HRC.https://twitter.com/CryBabyPrize/status/747471520646082560
747492933692186624 2016-06-27 18:12:57 UTC <Vva10967> @WorldForBernie Oh please, U need to learn the difference between corporations and foundations. The money is going for charity.
747310196381224960 2016-06-26 06:06:49 UTC <Vva10967> @brianefallon Hope Hillary chooses Warren. Tired of Sanders & his refusal to concede. Can't tell anymore whose side he is on. #ImWithHer
747161881731801088 2016-06-26 20:17:28 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid look at this one: http://nydn.us/28XHSFG Houston mom bitches about Obama & Dems wanting to take her guns away, kills daughters
747159221041508352 2016-06-26 20:06:54 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica bueno no, SI las propone pero no le gusta que las llamen asi.
747111021664473088 2016-06-26 16:55:22 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @jaketapper also needs to tell his followers that she won fair & square. She got 18MM votes in 2008 and 17MM in 2016.
747110142831923201 2016-06-26 16:51:53 UTC <Vva10967> @jaketapper No @BernieSanders slandered Hillary & should tell his followers that she is NOT the "corporate whore" that he painted her to be
747108726801375232 2016-06-26 16:46:15 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 actually a lot of people voted for him because he slandered Hillary & he needs to walk that back & admit he lied.
747095415229681664 2016-06-26 15:53:22 UTC <Vva10967> @Reforma @jorgeramosnews Los politicos que aplaudieron la decision de la Corte Supreme son todos Republicanos.
747093225916203008 2016-06-26 15:44:40 UTC <Vva10967> @HernandezGlobal @AlPunto yo no seria tan optimista, Donald Trump no es precisamente una persona logica. Mejor es salir a votar por Hillary.
747090582435209217 2016-06-26 15:34:09 UTC <Vva10967> @RepBecerra @AlPunto tiene razon en Noviembre tenemos q votar Democrata no solo por Presidenta sino tambien por Congresistas, Senadores, etc
747089530591805440 2016-06-26 15:29:59 UTC <Vva10967> @UnivisionNews and the triumph of Pride & Prejudice there is now tearing the UK apart, will lose them jobs & worsen the recession
746789355478487040 2016-06-25 19:37:11 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow we're in a populist wave. She needs Warren not Kaine.
746397479269179396 2016-06-24 17:40:01 UTC <Vva10967> @MetcalfeMegan He won't be.  He's playing U along but every now and then he slips & admits he will vote for her.  He likes the attention.
746393520496381952 2016-06-24 17:24:17 UTC <Vva10967> @MetcalfeMegan In 2008 Bernie said Obama WAS the nominee 2 days after last primary yet he needed 351 Supers to get to 2118.
746390150599573505 2016-06-24 17:10:53 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 yeah but he then went on the CBS morning show & said he wouldn't endorse HRC unless she agreed to his campaign proposals.
746387940557922304 2016-06-24 17:02:06 UTC <Vva10967> @jonlovett Maybe that's his strategy 4 our economy, he causes the dollar to crash & low & behold his golf courses in the US see a boom.
746387258085941248 2016-06-24 16:59:24 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews @AlPunto @Choco2273 No, la corte no decidio eso.  El caso sigue en marcha y talvez no se decida hasta el 2017.
746386938630901761 2016-06-24 16:58:08 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews @AlPunto Vi a muchos polticos aplaudir la decisin de la Corte Suprema- omites algo importante: que TODOS eran REPUBLICANOS
746385223387123712 2016-06-24 16:51:19 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid HIllary should just pick Warren as VP & leave Sanders behind w his Cult.  Bernie can't understand that he LOST & her ideas won.
746384520547545088 2016-06-24 16:48:31 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @MalyndaNyc @clary264 Arguing w BernieBots is pointless.They're a Cult that worships a mythical Bernie & hates a mythical HRC.
746382083988262912 2016-06-24 16:38:50 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews yes w/ Brexit, no w/ SCOTUS.  SCOTUS is the result of the Senate refusing to hold hearings to confirm 9th Justice, not fear.
746380671266992128 2016-06-24 16:33:13 UTC <Vva10967> @MetcalfeMegan @VinkayemKaren For the record, I AM NOT WITH BERNIE, NEVER HAVE BEEN, NEVER WILL BE.  #ImWithHer.
746380227492847616 2016-06-24 16:31:27 UTC <Vva10967> @MetcalfeMegan you've all created a mythical Bernie to worship and a mythical Hillary to hate. #ImWithHer #ShesOurNominee
746145179258626051 2016-06-23 00:57:28 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica seguro que Trump le paso sus datos lol
746125222814842881 2016-06-23 23:38:10 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica ironico que no reconozca el triunfo de la mujer que le gano la nominacion.
746106432735555585 2016-06-23 22:23:30 UTC <Vva10967> @MetcalfeMegan they're not concessions.  He's describing a Hillary Clinton presidency.  Left out the parts where they disagree.
746106016790642690 2016-06-23 22:21:51 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost @amjoyshow Funny Bernie's describing a Hillary Clinton presidency.  Left out free college, single payer healthcare & trade.
746103862021492736 2016-06-23 22:13:17 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica en que Trump y Boris Johnson parecen y suenan como gemelos separados al nacer, LOL.
746103196288942081 2016-06-23 22:10:38 UTC <Vva10967> @LesterHoltNBC @NBCNightlyNews In the National Enquirer, of course, LOL.
746097409588084736 2016-06-23 21:47:38 UTC <Vva10967> @KatyTurNBC sounds like Reagan when questionned about Iran-Contra but it turned out he had Alzheimer's... wonder if Trump does too?
746090284417753088 2016-06-23 21:19:20 UTC <Vva10967> @FiveThirtyEight but he's "supporting" Trump.
746051562284421120 2016-06-23 18:45:28 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @CCarlosorbe Bullsh*t, los Republicanos bloquean y seguiran bloqueando cualquier reforma migratoria al igual que DACA y DAPA.
746050683791618048 2016-06-23 18:41:58 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton tambien es importante votar Democratic por Senador, Congresista y puestos estatales y locales.
746050052293017600 2016-06-23 18:39:28 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Bernie Bots think the world revolves around them. Palin didn't lose McCain the election bc of gender but bc she was stupid.
746047027847569408 2016-06-23 18:27:26 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes Trump's twin separated at birth, aka Boris Johnson.
746046133336694784 2016-06-23 18:23:53 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM @CNN UGH, now with Lewandowski your election coverage just got more unbearable to watch!  Miss when CNN that was a news channel
746045047896936448 2016-06-23 18:19:34 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto Bueno, no los 8 jueces, solo los 4 que son Republicanos. Los Republicanos estan en contra de DACA y DAPA y de la Reforma Migratoria
746044076575834112 2016-06-23 18:15:43 UTC <Vva10967> @SusanDanzig219 I'm arguing that Warren should be the VP and I think that @_silversmith is too.  What are YOU arguing in all these tweets?
746042875805319168 2016-06-23 18:10:57 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @CCarlosorbe Lo tuvieron por 15 meses y no es culpa de los democratas q los votantes le entregaran el poder al GOP en 2010
746038702120538112 2016-06-23 17:54:21 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow So Warren SHOULD be her VP.
746038285315747840 2016-06-23 17:52:42 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow well he's just decoding Trump's slogan
746037294386266112 2016-06-23 17:48:46 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @mitchellreports why do you bother interviewing @RealBenCarson? R U desperate to fill in time? should have asked him about pyramids!
746007665160110080 2016-06-23 15:51:02 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto la solucion es votar Democrata no solo para Presidente sino tambien para el Senado y Casa de Representates y puestos estatales
746006945438568448 2016-06-23 15:48:10 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica No porque no hubo decision, lo que deja claro es que los Republicanos pueden obstruir las acciones ejecutivas del Presidente
746003113451069440 2016-06-23 15:32:56 UTC <Vva10967> @votolatino El partido Republicano es el enemigo.  Cada uno de los estados que se oponen a DAPA y a DACA tienen gobernadores Republicanos.
745475309529530368 2016-06-21 04:35:38 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @_silversmith Lol. Wall Street probably wants to protect its jobs & won't risk another Great Recession with Trump.
745474833522135040 2016-06-21 04:33:45 UTC <Vva10967> @_silversmith @JoyAnnReid @tmwinsett @SusanDanzig219 Bernie Bots are a lost cause but not all 12.5MM Bernie voters R bots. Most aren't.
745470647438966790 2016-06-21 04:17:07 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Also Warren started fundraising for Hillary today and did the Move On video that was released today as well which was quite good
745469939947954176 2016-06-21 04:14:18 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Bet it's Warren. Julian is too inexperienced and doesn't speak Spanish which is a liability if you want to excite Latino voters
745002035544731648 2016-06-20 21:15:01 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports @JoyAnnReid @maddow @lnteGritty He lost the election, time to lose the Secret Service protection that we, the taxpayers,pay
745000810522763264 2016-06-20 21:10:09 UTC <Vva10967> @maddow @JoyAnnReid @mitchellreports How come no one's report'g how much $$$ Bernie's Secret Serv continues to cost?https://twitter.com/Amy_Siskind/status/744974559984685056
744999306864771072 2016-06-20 21:04:10 UTC <Vva10967> @FiveThirtyEight As bad as Nixon was, W still tops the list.  The damage he did will be with us for decades to come.
744997150749298688 2016-06-20 20:55:36 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki So now the media is going to build another Frankenstein, pushing Gary Johnson?  Trump wasn't enough?
744757576185843712 2016-06-19 05:03:37 UTC <Vva10967> @lovinabox @joanwalsh it's old from end of May. DNC said they're NOT removing Barney Frank nor Dan Molloy from the committees.
744751197769338884 2016-06-19 04:38:17 UTC <Vva10967> @MattReynolds615 Not at all.  Your sexism blinds you.  He would never pass vetting.  Media was lazy w Sanders and Hillary didn't pursue it.
744562375668473857 2016-06-19 16:07:58 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @MrDane1982 @goblackcentral 12.5MM shows that there was NO revolution, just a normal election where 1 candidate liked rallies.
744367735228989440 2016-06-18 03:14:32 UTC <Vva10967> @MattReynolds615 I am, HRC won in a landslide vs Bernie: 3X the # of pledged delegates that Obama had over her in 2008.There's no revolution
744046690039173120 2016-06-17 05:58:49 UTC <Vva10967> @MattReynolds615 ugh no. We voted for Hillary's ideas not Bernie's pie in the sky, plus he chose to slander her to drive up her negatives.
743934245400358912 2016-06-17 22:32:00 UTC <Vva10967> @business probably not, lol.
743931936004055040 2016-06-17 22:22:49 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 @LunaMoon137 well 4 days after but still. Last primary was on a Tues, Bernie endorsed Obama that Thurs & HRC conceded on Sat
743929484231970817 2016-06-17 22:13:05 UTC <Vva10967> @BestWestern @DrNealBarnard isn't that oily?
743929207588282368 2016-06-17 22:11:59 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein it's a stupid idea & shows she has never filled out a 1040 nor a Schedule A since she seems to have no F clue of what is in them.
743653406649294848 2016-06-16 03:56:03 UTC <Vva10967> @lizcgoodwin However, almost 4 million MORE voters rejected his ideas & voted for Hillary's. Why R we going to transform party to his image?
743651381047889920 2016-06-16 03:48:00 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM & she should learn how that 1040 and Schedule A work before drafting stupid bills. Unlike GOP, WE, Dems, CANNOT be the party of stupid.
743650651650031617 2016-06-16 03:45:06 UTC <Vva10967> @maggieNYT Just what those GOP Senators needed, LOL.  Thanks W!
743551802516344832 2016-06-16 21:12:18 UTC <Vva10967> @FiveThirtyEight only reason ANYONE in media is going along w/that notion is bc HRC is a woman. In 2008 they told HRC you lost, GET OVER IT.
743550120319410177 2016-06-16 21:05:37 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 until Sanders confesses to his followers that he lied when he told them that the election was rigged,they won't accept loss.
743526799292895232 2016-06-16 19:32:57 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs @SenJohnMcCain never got over losing the presidency to a black man.
743526156658409480 2016-06-16 19:30:24 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC @SenJohnMcCain should re-read his concession speech & stop being such a sore loser. Hope Latino vote retires him in Nov.
743494372411457536 2016-06-16 17:24:06 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow Could U do a piece on how classified info is handled at Secs of State & Defense or even POTUS levels? i.e. email system vs SCIFs
743493152460410880 2016-06-16 17:19:15 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow would be powerful if in Sep-Oct Laura & Barbara Bush were to endorse Hillary.
743290263230095360 2016-06-15 03:53:03 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 I think once people get to know Johnson and Libertarian platform and see how fringe they are, his numbers go down.
743289076397281280 2016-06-15 03:48:20 UTC <Vva10967> @sahilkapur people in 2008 thought we weren't ready for a black POTUS either. #ClintonWarren2016
743188470777151489 2016-06-15 21:08:33 UTC <Vva10967> @guerrerosdegb by the way, I think you are wasting your time.  Trump's followers are driven by hate.  Let them be, just make sure U vote.
743183355600986112 2016-06-15 20:48:14 UTC <Vva10967> @MANNYDESANTIAGO @guerrerosdegb I would appreciate it if you would STOP including me on your thread.  TY.
742967827624263680 2016-06-14 06:31:48 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Hillary's win vs Sanders has been a landslide but media pretends it's been close. Her pledged del lead is 3x Obama's over her.
742960958797172736 2016-06-14 06:04:30 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki Hillary will be an awesome POTUS & will run for her 2nd term in 2020. Only question is what is left of the GOP after Nov lol
742844791885565952 2016-06-14 22:22:54 UTC <Vva10967> @jeffzeleny @jaketapper doubt it, you guys (the media) keep telling him that the race was close when it wasn't.  45% to 55% isn't close.
742839496908124161 2016-06-14 22:01:52 UTC <Vva10967> @UniNoticias @jorgeramosnews deeply troubled, uh?  but not deeply enough to boycott him and his campaign, lol.
742602024773095424 2016-06-13 06:18:14 UTC <Vva10967> @davidplouffe But Trump's a reflection of what GOP has become so wouldn't entire GOP have to be destroyed 4 his kind not to rise again?
742598010849361920 2016-06-13 06:02:17 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM ALL media outlets should boycott Trump campaign until he rescinds Washington Post revocation
742490402272468993 2016-06-13 22:54:41 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @NBCNews If press had guts, U would ALL boycott Trump campaign until Trump reinstalls Washington Post credentials.
742489686539657217 2016-06-13 22:51:50 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost @PostBaron If press had guts, they would ALL boycott Trump campaign until Trump reinstalls Washington Post credentials.
742489413821816832 2016-06-13 22:50:45 UTC <Vva10967> @Reuters @nytimes @USATODAY @MSNBC If press had guts, U would ALL boycott Trump campaign until Trump reinstalls Washington Post credentials.
742488933024550912 2016-06-13 22:48:51 UTC <Vva10967> @thedailybeast @JoyAnnReid @maddow If press had guts, U would ALL boycott Trump campaign until Trump reinstalls Washington Post credentials.
742488179303952384 2016-06-13 22:45:51 UTC <Vva10967> @nprpolitics If press had guts, U would ALL boycott Trump campaign until Trump reinstalls Washington Post credentials.
742487696250175492 2016-06-13 22:43:56 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews so is he now proposing that we expel from the country US Citizens who are muslim??? or that we put them in internment camps?
742486582041673730 2016-06-13 22:39:30 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost @CBSNews @CNN @ABC @NBCNews If press had guts, U would ALL boycott Trump campaign until Trump reinstalls WAPO's credentials.
742486077760536577 2016-06-13 22:37:30 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews maybe you should follow up & ask him if what he has in mind are internment camps for American muslims? Shooter was American-born.
742366185765900288 2016-06-13 14:41:05 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs yet consistent, Trump's entire campaign "ideas" are based on right wing hate radio shows with a few sprinkles of Faux News.
741664199064064000 2016-06-11 16:11:39 UTC <Vva10967> @CNNgo @CNN you continue to give him free press.  How is a political speech "news"???
741663369653018625 2016-06-11 16:08:21 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow surely you can find someone on the right that is less obnoxious than Hugh Hewitt?  Please? I love your show but can't stomach him
741512322548633600 2016-06-10 06:08:08 UTC <Vva10967> @lizcgoodwin @MikeMiguel the 90s were great, rising salaries, economic prosperity, budget surpluses, peace.The 50s on the other hand weren't
740786672145715201 2016-06-08 06:04:40 UTC <Vva10967> @CNBCnow @Nate_Cohn Bernie endorsed Obama 2 days after last primary in 2008. Didn't care that he'd met required # of delegates w/ supers.
740780684109860865 2016-06-08 05:40:52 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn Hillary's results in 2008 were much more impressive than Sanders' and she conceded & didn't call her campaign a "revolution"
740751407775649792 2016-06-08 03:44:32 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @metaquest it's not anti-TPP hysteria, the clause she objected to would allow corporations to sue our govt & should come out.
740750561285398528 2016-06-08 03:41:10 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid probably white men.  But Hillary needs someone who can excite the base like Warren and he's BORING.
740678759393681408 2016-06-08 22:55:52 UTC <Vva10967> @BuzzFeedAndrew Well, HE, Ed Rendell, should NEVER EVER be considered as he tends to put his foot in his mouth every time he speaks.
740675164405432322 2016-06-08 22:41:34 UTC <Vva10967> @mmfa but yet they think that Trump is ready to be POTUS.  Who cares what they think.
740674541568069632 2016-06-08 22:39:06 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC should he say "I made a mistake saying out loud what we're only supposed to say in code?"  LOL
740615518923718656 2016-06-08 18:44:34 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein sounds like Bernie is even thinner skinned than Trump.
740601156322353152 2016-06-08 17:47:30 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod @GlennThrush bc GOP excuse re Mexican R rapists comments is that they were directed at illegals.  Judge Curiel is US born.
740600244002521089 2016-06-08 17:43:52 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC we need TRUMP's taxes to see if he's successful in his businesses as he claims he is & to see if he has given $$$ to vet groups
740599532694740996 2016-06-08 17:41:02 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC Both are irrelevant.  Democratic race is over.  On to Trump and it is important that Trump release his taxes.
740599098806575104 2016-06-08 17:39:19 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews it shows that you put party ahead of country which is what the GOP has been doing for at least the past 8 years.
740429219579219968 2016-06-07 06:24:17 UTC <Vva10967> @AC360 apparently not but he IS very good at lying to his supporters
740403355277795328 2016-06-07 04:41:30 UTC <Vva10967> @ABCLiz no way. He chose to slander her to drive up her negatives when he knew better.
740317041803005952 2016-06-07 22:58:31 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki we are not confused, @SenSanders is.  Seems that he wasn't confused in 2008 when he said Obama had won WITH supers.
740040010531999744 2016-06-06 04:37:42 UTC <Vva10967> @latimes @TS13Creative in 2008 Sanders believed supers should be counted to reach required #.  He said Obama had won primary on June 5th.
739670052258127873 2016-06-05 04:07:37 UTC <Vva10967> @lightshallow Supers will not overturn the will of the voters & her lead by end of Tuesday will exceed 3 million votes and 300 pledged dels
739667916115836929 2016-06-05 03:59:08 UTC <Vva10967> @lightshallow they would switch if he had won in votes & pledged delegates as was case w/ Obama, but he didn't. He LOST.
739584282855931904 2016-06-05 22:26:48 UTC <Vva10967> @kasie or not. People forget that Hillary got close to 18 Million votes in 2008 & that those voters LOVE her. Sanders crowds R 1000s not MMs
739569905520005120 2016-06-05 21:29:40 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki but Bernie isn't, he is 3 million votes behind and that number will grow with NJ and NM, maybe even with CA if CA isn't a tie
739553272348966912 2016-06-05 20:23:35 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports I know this is hard for U 2 believe, but maybe Dem voters actually like Hillary? Her race against Obama in 2008 was way closer
739487114300100608 2016-06-05 16:00:41 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports @UAProgressives No, California voted for HILLARY in 2008 Democratic Primary.  #FeelTheFacts.
739483028293058560 2016-06-05 15:44:27 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto por favor sean serios, este pobre senor no tiene idea de lo costoso y dificil que es una candidatura por la presidencia en USA.
739316953689509888 2016-06-04 04:44:32 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports @UAProgressives Umm Hillary won California in 2008 & yet lost the primary. #FeelTheMath
739302055634964480 2016-06-04 03:45:20 UTC <Vva10967> @falconalina but it's not all Americans, it's Republican Americans that have that phobia, the same ones that follow Trump.
739275508630867968 2016-06-04 01:59:50 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews Clinton gana aun si pierde California. Gana la nominacion con NJ.  Sanders lo sabe. Cualquiera q pueda contar lo sabe.
739263793667182592 2016-06-04 01:13:17 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM did he not get the memo that the winner of the GOP primary defines the agenda?  GOP is now the Party of Trump.  He should accept it.
739263169294655488 2016-06-04 01:10:49 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs in 2008 Barack Obama did NOT reach 2118 with elected delegates alone, supers were in the count, so Bernie's argument is nonsense.
739262308279541760 2016-06-04 01:07:23 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports & that the winner of the election by over 3 million votes & over 250 elected delegates be denied the nomination she EARNED 3/
739261965642653696 2016-06-04 01:06:02 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports media also needs to spell for people that what @SenSanders proposes is that the loser of the election, him, be crowned king 2/
739261680136388608 2016-06-04 01:04:54 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports the media needs to call him on that, Barack Obama WON after the last 2008 primary WITH superdelegates counted to reach 2118 1/
739260731170902017 2016-06-04 01:01:07 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton don't forget his letters to NYC Mayors Giuliani & Bloomberg asking them to remove street vendors who were vets from 5th Ave.
739257337597308928 2016-06-04 00:47:38 UTC <Vva10967> @lizcgoodwin yes, code word for Make America White Again.  But media won't call him on it.
739256764785414144 2016-06-04 00:45:22 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews Trump's going to have SOME support among Latinos.  He has some among blacks too even though he rose in the GOP through Birtherism.
738804923563921408 2016-06-03 18:49:54 UTC <Vva10967> @politico @JoyAnnReid @LeahRigueur @bertha1957 well there are Blacks who support the GOP despite all the hate it spews on President Obama.
738584123506229248 2016-06-02 04:12:31 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC well he must have promised Ryan that he will sign his cut medicare & social security bills so he's bound to say it @ fundraiser
738573574114545664 2016-06-02 03:30:36 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn LOL if close Sanders will make CA do a recount just like he did in KY. Cannot accept that over 3MM voters prefer Hillary to him.
738572959640653824 2016-06-02 03:28:10 UTC <Vva10967> @Nate_Cohn @LapGongLeong Dem contests R all proportional; she ends up with more than 2026 pledged no matter what happens in CA. #FeelTheMath
738533591756476417 2016-06-02 00:51:44 UTC <Vva10967> @SteveKornacki Hillary won California in 2008. Did it matter? No. Obama won California in the general.
738517566923014144 2016-06-02 23:48:03 UTC <Vva10967> @ABCLiz because that race is over. Only Bernie & his followers seem unable to do the math. #FeelTheMath
738456726786179072 2016-06-02 19:46:18 UTC <Vva10967> Seems no one told Trump's SuperPAC that coordination with his campaign is not allowed!  @brianefallon @maddow @HFAhttps://twitter.com/teddyschleifer/status/738452826087690240
738413383775584258 2016-06-02 16:54:04 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @ElNuevoDia puede proponerlo pero el Congreso lo controlan los Republicanos y su propuesta no va a ningun lado
738239248613187584 2016-06-01 05:22:07 UTC <Vva10967> @hardball @JoyAnnReid by the way whatever happened to Tad Devine?
738103697717272576 2016-06-01 20:23:29 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 only reason they are even in the news is the media trying to create a headline where there isn't one.Their platform is fringe
737761959630753792 2016-05-31 21:45:32 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes Y do U keep entertaining claim that 2383 must b met w/ pledged dels alone when BO won vs HRC w/o reaching 2118 w/pledged alone?
737751570725621762 2016-05-31 21:04:15 UTC <Vva10967> @mmurraypolitics no San Francisco?  How come?
737699656029851648 2016-05-31 17:37:58 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes if his leaks were a public service shouldn't he then get a Presidential pardon?
737698197989134336 2016-05-31 17:32:10 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJ so will this work & shut you up? or will you go after his lies & deceptions? how about his letters to remove vet vendors off 5th Ave?
737697502791602177 2016-05-31 17:29:25 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid maybe President Obama should have thought of that... oh wait, he has held rallies since elected and it hasn't worked! mmmm
737695205105754113 2016-05-31 17:20:17 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @maddow @chucktodd Shouldn't we get a disclaimer? Olbermann was fired over not disclosing much smaller amounthttps://twitter.com/Maggyw519/status/737172110141886465
737425943980068864 2016-05-30 23:30:20 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews no seria raro, a Trump lo apoyan el Sheriff Joe Arpaio y la gobernadora Brewer. Solo falta Pete Wilson.
737345421442420736 2016-05-30 18:10:22 UTC <Vva10967> @Beverlyb11 isn't that the Oklahoma governor? doesn't look like Susana Martinez who is the governor of New Mexico, just saying.
737062631077466112 2016-05-29 23:26:39 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM Trump repeats like a parrot what Limbaugh and the likes say. I'm surprised he didn't say he read it in the National Enquirer, lol.
736955958077870080 2016-05-29 16:22:47 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid sounds like he reads Trump's logo as Make America White Again, no?
736954389139689472 2016-05-29 16:16:32 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica el ataque al server de Clinton q se describe en el informe NO fue exitoso y los servers del State Dept SI han sido hackeados 5/

736755410317811712 2016-05-28 03:05:52 UTC <Vva10967> @benchmarkpol @Mypes45 although in tomorrow's Face The Nation interview Sanders finally admits that process isn't "rigged" (now it's "dumb")
736750787678904324 2016-05-28 02:47:30 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas @jorgeramosnews @jdbalart did you see this?https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/736620556938842112
736703649917898752 2016-05-28 23:40:12 UTC <Vva10967> @billmaher After June 8th, Bernie's security should be back to normal.  June 15th if he pushes it.
736701971755847680 2016-05-28 23:33:31 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @UniPolitica el candidato mas fuerte es el que obtiene la mayor cantidad de votos: @HillaryClinton, ganando por mas de 3MM!
736582692624596992 2016-05-28 15:39:33 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow can MSNBC make your show segments available somewhere? e.g FB or MSNBC YouTube channel? would love to share them w friends on FB
736582070105968644 2016-05-28 15:37:05 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow @amigoaguilar you're in denial, the GOP is now the Party of Trump and stands for what HE stands: Xenophobia, mysogeny & racism.
736581453912408064 2016-05-28 15:34:38 UTC <Vva10967> @amjoyshow @maddow can U debunk myth that if no one gets reqd # of Dem dels w pledged dels alone U have a contested convention?e.g. BO & HRC
736579491921833984 2016-05-28 15:26:50 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews U DO know that classified business is conducted via secured connections & not email, right? This is a FOIA record keeping problem.
736578807507918848 2016-05-28 15:24:07 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews @Newsweek does much better job UNDERSTANDING what the report ACTUALLY says.
736578354485268480 2016-05-28 15:22:19 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews will you be scrutinizing Trump's claim that California drought is made up by the feds & that he can fix it?
736440990517624832 2016-05-27 06:16:29 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes @Newsweek has done a much better job on this story.FOIA is about record keeping not security & retroactive classification is stupid
736438715787182081 2016-05-27 06:07:26 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @billmaher the winner of the primary is the person with the most VOTES not the person who polls better.  Respect will of voters.
736438015053201408 2016-05-27 06:04:39 UTC <Vva10967> @billmaher Hillary has 3 million more votes than Bernie & the longer he stays in to weaken her, the more he strengthens Trump.
736436690856910848 2016-05-27 05:59:24 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @billmaher ignored that she who gets the most votes WINS the primary not he who polls better because no one has attacked him
736226827291758592 2016-05-27 16:05:28 UTC <Vva10967> @beccalenn and yet the press continues to give him free airtime and lets him get away with whatever he wants just for the ratings.
736005375284109312 2016-05-26 01:25:30 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas esa ha sido la posicion del partido Republicano - lo mismo propusieron Rubio y Cruz y hacerlo aun mas rapido.
736001694274838528 2016-05-26 01:10:52 UTC <Vva10967> @DanaBashCNN @AC360 so U think HRC should have printed every email when received & sent & put them in a box to be manually indexed & stored?
735987597634359296 2016-05-26 00:14:51 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid as much as I enjoy your wisdom @hughhewitt makes me barf Surely @TheLastWord @Lawrence can find someone less dislikable on right
735937150974341121 2016-05-26 20:54:24 UTC <Vva10967> @rauldemolina @ElGordoyLaFlaca This is one reason @Univision will continue to FAIL to attract the college educated Latino/as. #Barf.
735878682917638144 2016-05-26 17:02:04 UTC <Vva10967> @allinwithchris can you guys upload the segment about the Trump vitamins scheme?
735874660726902784 2016-05-26 16:46:05 UTC <Vva10967> @KatyTurNBC so does he stop campaigning now in California, New Mexico & NJ?
735872494939340800 2016-05-26 16:37:29 UTC <Vva10967> @Carrasquillo years? 2 at most, no? 2013 when GOP had its post-2012 election report to 2015 when Trump said Mexicans R rapists & criminals.
735864154473521152 2016-05-26 16:04:20 UTC <Vva10967> @TheBriefing2016 @dailybeast how was the investment part of the scheme not illegal under US Securities Laws? Can U find out w NYAG & US SEC?
735863741032587267 2016-05-26 16:02:42 UTC <Vva10967> @NYTNow @MariaESalinas But that's the press narrative & what the press keeps telling people.  Report said her 4 predecessors did same thing.
735629962317795328 2016-05-25 00:33:45 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod so what do you think is the difference between endorsing Trump and supporting him? @KellyAyotte will support but not endorse?
735540829335498752 2016-05-25 18:39:34 UTC <Vva10967> @FrankLuntz here, why don't you educate yourself about government servers:  http://www.newsweek.com/2016/02/19/colin-powell-emails-hillary-clinton-424187.html
735540623655206912 2016-05-25 18:38:45 UTC <Vva10967> @FrankLuntz AOL servers were private servers, owned by AOL, not the government, and that is what Powell used.
735523781234597888 2016-05-25 17:31:49 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein high-quality? Seriously? your bar for quality is extremely low, lol.
735521785425301504 2016-05-25 17:23:53 UTC <Vva10967> @KellyAyotte I can't figure out what the difference between "endorsing" and "supporting" @realDonaldTrump is.  Can you explain it?  Thanks.
735521020921188353 2016-05-25 17:20:51 UTC <Vva10967> @jonlovett what do you think is difference between endorsing and supporting Trump? Can't figure it out, lol.  eg. Kelly Ayotte
735506251673665536 2016-05-25 16:22:10 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM Jeff Weaver is such a jerk.  What would he know about how a woman would feel in that situation? male chauvinist pig.
735500158763454465 2016-05-25 15:57:57 UTC <Vva10967> @business your tweet is misleading, @SenSanders has no clout in a GOP controlled Congress.
735324474820661248 2016-05-24 04:19:51 UTC <Vva10967> @starledger funny that @HillaryClinton wins when turn out is high, which is the exact opposite of what @SenSanders tells the media happens
735323638535233537 2016-05-24 04:16:31 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica estaria muy mal si hubiese perdido considerando que es el UNICO candidato Republicano que queda en la contienda, no? lol
735227567440072704 2016-05-24 21:54:46 UTC <Vva10967> @eyi_rick keep telling yourself that, truth is @SenSanders is a sore loser who can't stand losing to a woman.  And no he ain't getting VP.
735222669713477632 2016-05-24 21:35:18 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @maddow why don't media outlets say that in 2008 neither BO nor HRC had # of pledged dels = number req'd for nom (then 2118)?
735220416634052608 2016-05-24 21:26:21 UTC <Vva10967> @eyi_rick last 2008 primary was Tues 6/3, she conceded Sat 6/7. Pledged del totals: BO 1767 vs HRC 1640, diff= 127. Magic # for nom = 2118.
735154021909024768 2016-05-24 17:02:31 UTC <Vva10967> @eyi_rick no, the 2008 California primary was held on the February 5 Super Tuesday.
735153222827008001 2016-05-24 16:59:21 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJD With all the rightwing conspiracy theories Trending Topics will end up like the Microsoft chatbot on twitter that had to be pulled lol
735149165508956161 2016-05-24 16:43:14 UTC <Vva10967> @eyi_rick CA wasn't this late in the schedule last time.
735138784753426437 2016-05-24 16:01:59 UTC <Vva10967> @HFA @ChelseaClinton Since @HillaryClinton is clinching the nomination as soon as NJ is called, will there be a celebration event?#NJPrimary
734594791544094721 2016-05-22 04:00:21 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM oh good, then she really has NOTHING to worry about since that will never happen, lol.
734547628336283650 2016-05-22 00:52:56 UTC <Vva10967> @60Minutes @NorahODonnell why is it so difficult to admit GOP treats Obama different than any prior POTUS & that YES IT IS BC of HIS RACE!
734546548923715585 2016-05-22 00:48:39 UTC <Vva10967> @vj44 @60Minutes @NorahODonnell you repeated all the Faux News BS, are you Republican and just couldn't hide your biases?
734545775389245440 2016-05-22 00:45:34 UTC <Vva10967> @condoqueenCS you do know that being sovereign means that you get to say NO to USA help & that diplomats killed abroad isn't unique to HRC?
734228076096262144 2016-05-21 03:43:09 UTC <Vva10967> @ABCLiz she's being kind, lol. Tanking not just ours but also the world's economy & starting WW3 as he nukes Iraq and Syria are far worse.
734130931250909189 2016-05-21 21:17:08 UTC <Vva10967> @HillaryClinton @DavidCornDC Lying Trump.
734127218411114496 2016-05-21 21:02:22 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid did Sanders win DWS's district?  bc he lost badly to HRC in FL. Sanders scapegoats DWS when truth is more Dems voters prefer HRC
734122669268979712 2016-05-21 20:44:18 UTC <Vva10967> @mmfa p.s. Maria Celeste Arraras is Telemundo's anchor, not Univision's.
734121682206613508 2016-05-21 20:40:23 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid I think Sen Merkley will be able to talk sense into Bernie come 6/7- I just wonder how he walks back his 'process is rigged' lie
733716763276349440 2016-05-20 17:51:22 UTC <Vva10967> @SenSanders @Eugene_Robinson @davidaxelrod has a hard time accepting that more Dem voters prefer Hillary over him. Reminds me of McCain & BO
733443554253668352 2016-05-19 23:45:44 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @mitchellreports it's clear millions of Americans can count & believe that she who wins the popular vote wins the primary.
733439694722236416 2016-05-19 23:30:24 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica @MANNYDESANTIAGO no, es anti-immigrante.  No te enganes, si un seguidor de Trump te ve en la calle, va a decirte Go Home
733353148035796992 2016-05-19 17:46:30 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica el ascenso de Trump dentro del partido Republicano ha fomentado desde el inicio el sentimiento anti-immigrante y anti-Latino.
733352800185372673 2016-05-19 17:45:07 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica porque es credulo y estupido y se deja enganar por los republicanos?  solo asi podria un hispano votar por Trump.
733140506088243200 2016-05-18 03:41:32 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica es una encuesta de Fox News, el canal de los Republicanos.
733089182101458944 2016-05-18 00:17:35 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC we'll see on June 7th.  Hillary becomes the presumptive Dem nominee at 8:01 EST, right after NJ is called.  It's MATH.
733088443283214336 2016-05-18 00:14:39 UTC <Vva10967> @NBCNightlyNews @VP @mitchellreports at this point that isn't an IF but a WHEN.  Hillary wins on June 7th at 8:01PM EST, once NJ is called
733031564670607360 2016-05-18 20:28:38 UTC <Vva10967> @MichaelLaRosaDC another distraction to keep the attention off his tax returns.  And of course media will run with it nonstop.
733030719950360576 2016-05-18 20:25:17 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto es puro teatro, a sus seguidores les dice otra cosa.
732983308884291584 2016-05-18 17:16:53 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod I think @SenSanders' brand will suffer if come 6/14 he's 2 to 3MM votes behind & still wants to flip primary vote result @DNC
732794006170677248 2016-05-17 04:44:40 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes On the contrary, Bernie was supposed to win Oregon in a landslide but has underperformed. Margin is in single digits.
732787307779067904 2016-05-17 04:18:03 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica no hay ningun obstaculo para que las personas se inscriban como miembros del partido democrata.  Es gratis inscribirse.
732733009129000960 2016-05-17 00:42:17 UTC <Vva10967> @MichaelLaRosaDC would have been nice if @hardball_chris would have told @clairecmc GOP primary result is from March lol
732731296926052357 2016-05-17 00:35:29 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @ehartman1975 @clairecmc just made the same mistake reading the GOP results!
732704744830062593 2016-05-17 22:49:58 UTC <Vva10967> @BernieSanders @davidaxelrod is contradicting himself, said about CA protests that interrupting meetings inside was NOT ok but now NV is ok?
732704220684619776 2016-05-17 22:47:53 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid since you'll have time to kill maybe you can speculate how much money Bernie may have left to burn in California? quite curious
732701937867608064 2016-05-17 22:38:49 UTC <Vva10967> @mmfa because if Bush hadn't destroyed it, Obama would not have had the opportunity to "improve" it?  LOL.
732699599144640512 2016-05-17 22:29:31 UTC <Vva10967> @MSNBC @ehartman1975 that the KY GOP primary occurred March 5?  lol
732684235627241472 2016-05-17 21:28:29 UTC <Vva10967> @AC360 lol so what is in them that he doesn't want the world to see?  is he not as rich as he says he is? is he supporting Dem causes?
732630589640200193 2016-05-17 17:55:18 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid NC could go democratic if people there are fed up with effect of bathroom laws on economy.  May be able to flip governorship 2.
732627129041588225 2016-05-17 17:41:33 UTC <Vva10967> @UniNoticias @HillaryClinton @UniPolitica @MUDDLAW no, tendrian que escoger ser estado.
731714449413947392 2016-05-14 05:14:53 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid his cash on hand at 3/31 was low around $17MM + $26MM=$43MM & he spent heavily in NY & April 26 states Could end up in red
731282001374875649 2016-05-13 00:36:30 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid since U often get attacked by BernieBros when you discuss delegate math, I thought you might enjoy this: http://bit.ly/1Wwh6Er
731270606608605184 2016-05-13 23:51:13 UTC <Vva10967> @MaddowBlog @JoyAnnReid looks like @LindseyGrahamSC is caving in his opposition to Trump http://bit.ly/2262FXB
731191267154100224 2016-05-13 18:35:57 UTC <Vva10967> @bungdan disagree, the media REFUSES to call it what it is, racism & white resentment, & chooses instead to call it "anger & frustration"
731184255880048640 2016-05-13 18:08:06 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas Trump rose to prominence in GOP in 2011 by being a birther & GOP refused to say he was wrong to question POTUS' legitimacy
731183544832233472 2016-05-13 18:05:16 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas it's not like Trump's Build the Wall or Deport All Illegals are unique to him, Rubio & Cruz agreed w/ both ideas.
731183128384024576 2016-05-13 18:03:37 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas bc GOP chose to grow by embracing racists that left Dem Party after LBJ passed 1964 Civil Rights Act & 1965 Voting Rights Act
731181512910110721 2016-05-13 17:57:12 UTC <Vva10967> @washingtonpost @RealBenCarson @mitchellreports right, so can we see his tax returns?  Be they show him donating to Planned Parenthood lol
730816916177223681 2016-05-12 17:48:25 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 also Bernie's downticket fundraising is to run against other Dems, not against Repub.
730806544745500672 2016-05-12 17:07:12 UTC <Vva10967> @Clyburn @mitchellreports actually @BernieSanders still isn't one, he doesn't call HIMSELF a Democrat ever & puts himself ahead of party.
730500373652373507 2016-05-11 20:50:35 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes would love to see the video or audio. Your headline seems misleading & half of story is about police & crime going up.
730179789781389312 2016-05-10 23:36:42 UTC <Vva10967> @PaulBegala why is it that the media always uses the most unflattering and/or angry or witchy photos of HIllary they can find?
730178022750466048 2016-05-10 23:29:41 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid fantasy that Trump'll bring back not just coal mining but labor intensive coal mining is like saying VHS players will  be back
730176393045217280 2016-05-10 23:23:12 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid hasn't Bernie also been playing Hillary's comment from the debate in his ads?  By "we" she clearly meant the market & it's true.
730175896578035712 2016-05-10 23:21:14 UTC <Vva10967> @AditiJuneja3 @JoyAnnReid the media has a really hard time calling Trumpism what it is, racism or white resentment.  They prefer "anger" lol
730097572480729088 2016-05-10 18:10:00 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein so America as a whole is a LOT more racist, xenophobic & misogynist than we thought? The Trump cancer has spread beyond GOP base?
729895974936715264 2016-05-09 04:48:55 UTC <Vva10967> @TPM however the platform isn't binding on the candidate and hardly anyone outside hard core party insiders read it or remember it after
729895206686994432 2016-05-09 04:45:52 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas Ryan is positioning himself to run for POTUS in 2020. He'll likely give in come Thurs so as to not anger the GOP base.
729837033095630853 2016-05-09 00:54:43 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJ her losing WV is not news nor will it have much impact on the pledged delegate tally.  Only Sanders is running ads there.
729797084086452225 2016-05-09 22:15:58 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJ so he's going to issue high interest debt to retire low interest debt?  seriously? bc w his tax plan we get deficits not surpluses
729796791105949696 2016-05-09 22:14:48 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJ aren't you supposed to be the financial experts & shouldn't you be fact checking him? with what money?
729714023634219008 2016-05-09 16:45:55 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 what a delusional LOSER this @HAGOODMANAUTHOR guy is! And he even admits to watching Faux! lol.
729514026020048896 2016-05-08 03:31:12 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid no, he reiterated the wall & the mass deportations on 5/4, the day before his Cinco De Mayo bowl tweet.
729049628654616580 2016-05-07 20:45:51 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid that used to be MSNBC in the Keith days, lol.  Problem is that the POTUS gives interviews to Faux but doesn't to MSNBC.
729040324329385984 2016-05-07 20:08:52 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto es la misma carcel que visito el Papa Francisco o diferente carcel?
729039537675108359 2016-05-07 20:05:45 UTC <Vva10967> @mmfa cnn has a hard time processing what @jonfavs is telling them, THEY seem to admire Trump, lol.
728818783377367040 2016-05-06 05:28:33 UTC <Vva10967> @benchmarkpol @krf7 WV & Guam R pretty irrelevant at this point & we already know that sanders will win WV. HC isn't even buying ads there
728816322877001728 2016-05-06 05:18:46 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs honestly I don't think your average voter noticed. Most people aren't that obsessed to watch every twit.
728814463646846976 2016-05-06 05:11:23 UTC <Vva10967> @POTUS @VP did Sophie Cruz tell you how much she fears that you will deport her parents? Raids separating families continue per news.
728449366696951808 2016-05-05 05:00:37 UTC <Vva10967> @KatieForBern don't kid yourself, the typical Trump voter views Sanders as a socialist/communist, an even greater threat than Hillary.
728448604919107584 2016-05-05 04:57:35 UTC <Vva10967> @Reuters those same people would vote for Trump to stop Bernie too if he were the nominee & w/ even greater force bc he'd be "the socialist"
728446238702460929 2016-05-05 04:48:11 UTC <Vva10967> @deborahamos yes & they continue to give him 24/7 free press & let him get away with nonsense & still won't call him out.
728443690520186880 2016-05-05 04:38:04 UTC <Vva10967> @FiveThirtyEight except that in Hillary's case the hate is from Republicans & Irrational,like their hate for Obama. For Trump he provoked it
728398768387821568 2016-05-05 01:39:34 UTC <Vva10967> @HFA GOP women believe Trump "worked hard & smart to be where he's today & didn't steal it from anyone"- you need ad dispelling that myth
728393754441355264 2016-05-05 01:19:38 UTC <Vva10967> @CNNPolitics @mkraju No, McCain said he'll support but not endorse Trump & if U were real journalists U would force him to clarify differenc
728392393058353153 2016-05-05 01:14:14 UTC <Vva10967> @FrankLuntz Rick Perry should define "capable and experienced" since Palin has said that  she'll be Trump's Secretary of Energy
728378652099022848 2016-05-05 00:19:37 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica dijo POR AHORA, lo que quiere decir que lo hara en unas semanas o talvez en la convencion republicana, es puro teatro politico
728300866869071872 2016-05-05 19:10:32 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas what a LOSER! Capaz le pide que lo contrate a el para construir el muro el mismo.
728298028969381893 2016-05-05 18:59:15 UTC <Vva10967> @MichaelLaRosaDC @MSNBC Dana Bash @CNN on the other hand whines, but we ask him tough questions and he refuses to answer, so unfair...
728295494976442368 2016-05-05 18:49:11 UTC <Vva10967> @flail01 @AlanKestrel750 Grassley sane?  the "Obamacare has death panels and pulls the plug on grandma" guy? lol  Guy needs to be retired.
728278056918487040 2016-05-05 17:39:54 UTC <Vva10967> @Morning_Joe so you think it's a COINCIDENCE that Trump's rise in the GOP started with his 2011 claims that Barack Obama was born in Kenya?
727901817535930373 2016-05-04 16:44:51 UTC <Vva10967> @JohnKasich you know, Disney might sue you for using their Star Wars music in your ad, lol.
727745143210651652 2016-05-03 06:22:17 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Indiana loves guns. That too likely favored Sanders over Hillary & Clinton camp would have known it.
727741535505256448 2016-05-03 06:07:57 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid shouldn't Sanders be running low on cash soon? He outspent her by a lot in ads in the April primaries & cash was $17.5MM at 3/31
727739650836697088 2016-05-03 06:00:28 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Clinton Super PACs said they would not spend on primary after she won NY, turning to general instead
727719818795880448 2016-05-03 04:41:39 UTC <Vva10967> @NettiePearl01 minority & poor are choosing Hillary.  Independents are choosing Bernie.  So affects both.
727716232309440512 2016-05-03 04:27:24 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica solo Mike Lee lo apoyo y el slogan que le pusieron en su mismo partido Republicano fue de We Lose With Cruz (perdemos con Cruz)
727712123418251264 2016-05-03 04:11:05 UTC <Vva10967> @NettiePearl01 those R GOP-enacted changes intended to help Republican candidates & disadvantage ALL Democratic candidates not just Bernie
727656012354879489 2016-05-03 00:28:07 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica porque Trump no lo ha atacado ni le ha puesto apodo todavia
727610084856082432 2016-05-03 21:25:37 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid no, it's just Karma for all the batsh*t crazy stuff the GOP has caused the Obamas to endure over the past 8 years.
727554475364388864 2016-05-03 17:44:38 UTC <Vva10967> @FisherBurton Barack Obama overcame that in 2008 and won, Bernie's revolution failed, attracted thousand but not millions. Facts matter.
727553779722293248 2016-05-03 17:41:53 UTC <Vva10967> @FisherBurton The Dem Party has been center-left since the 1990s & primary vote reflects that- it's not far left & neither is the USA
727552769197006852 2016-05-03 17:37:52 UTC <Vva10967> @FisherBurton and 3.5MM more voters have gone to the booths and said no thanks, we prefer Hillary. #ImWithHer.  Facts matter.
727551640069349380 2016-05-03 17:33:22 UTC <Vva10967> @FisherBurton manipulating supers? you know, people who actually know Hillary LIKE her & the supers that support her have worked w her & do
727549990248259585 2016-05-03 17:26:49 UTC <Vva10967> @RTJackson77 I think you're talking to @FisherBurton- I'm of the opinion that SANDERS should NOT steal the nomination from winner, Hillary.
727548952531341314 2016-05-03 17:22:42 UTC <Vva10967> @FisherBurton so DNC is changing SuperPAC rules too? C'mon, stop making excuses,Obama won vs Hillary w 17.5MM votes & same rules we have now
727547465113702401 2016-05-03 17:16:47 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Barack defeated Hillary w same primary rules we have now & got 17.5MM people to vote for him, Bernie is at 1/2 that, rev failed
727546444308205568 2016-05-03 17:12:44 UTC <Vva10967> @FisherBurton True but if she wins CA & entire primary, Bernie's plan forward is to disregard that fact & steal the nomination at convention
727543947313205248 2016-05-03 17:02:48 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid under Sanders logic we should start having general elections, take a poll after & award presidency to the winner of the poll lol
727543674331127808 2016-05-03 17:01:43 UTC <Vva10967> @BernIn2K16 no he still loses, he's going beyond that, saying he should win bc he polls better than Hillary even if 3.5MM voters prefer her
727365890417803264 2016-05-02 05:15:16 UTC <Vva10967> @Eugene_Robinson it's more likely that he just listened to 12 hours of right wing hate radio to figure out his talking points for GOP base
727174028356648961 2016-05-02 16:32:53 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid under current corporate law shareholder returns trump considerations for well-being of workers &/or communities corps operate in
727172995710636032 2016-05-02 16:28:47 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid it's not just free trade but also quarterly capitalism & notion that corporations' sole duty is to maximize shareholder return.
726474944150933504 2016-04-30 18:14:58 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews @SenJohnMcCain you lost, we elected Obama 2X, get over it.  Remember your concession speech, you were gracious then, not bitter
726275624382418946 2016-04-29 05:02:57 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews not quite, she said Hillary's hawkishness was scarier than Trump's wall but "that doesn't mean that I would vote for Trump".
725911139385643008 2016-04-28 04:54:37 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod @GOP has been putting party ahead of country since @POTUS got elected, no new shift.
725893792855932928 2016-04-28 03:45:41 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 Trump is not a great campaigner, he's just exploiting the hate that already exists in GOP base to get their nomination
725891431236276224 2016-04-28 03:36:18 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 so now Jane is pandering to Republicans on Faux??? Is she seriously expecting Faux viewers to embrace socialism? LOL
725729770873491456 2016-04-28 16:53:55 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid sad that the charities he supported won't receive anything to be able to continue their missions.
725728816979652608 2016-04-28 16:50:08 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaCeleste bueno, es por fracking, y los rios en USA corren el mismo riesgo.
725019206903844864 2016-04-26 17:50:23 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid that's similar to 2008 when HC suggested BO be her VP & BO said how could 2nd place person offer VP to person who's in 1st place
725016218890063873 2016-04-26 17:38:31 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid but like she told @maddow she's WINNING & by a lot- the VOTERS have chosen HER ideas over @SenSanders'
724276935895998465 2016-04-24 16:40:52 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @MarioDB pero para q haya una solucion legislativa, Republicanos tienen q perder el control del Congreso ya que siguen diciendo NO.
723971971030069248 2016-04-23 20:29:03 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes how does he plan to keep the homeland safe from attacks like 9/11? what programs would he keep, expand and/or discontinue?
723971467906551808 2016-04-23 20:27:03 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes what would he do w/ NSA surveillance program? toss it?  keep it?  keep some of it?
723971182190534656 2016-04-23 20:25:55 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes what are his views on government whistleblowers?  on Snowden?  would he pardon him?
723970158683889665 2016-04-23 20:21:51 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes will he continue Obama's approach of killing terrorist leaders w/ drones in pre-emptive strikes in Pakistan, Iraq, Yemem etc.?
723889803289305089 2016-04-23 15:02:32 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod in HIllary's case, not being boring & bland are also key, lol.  She isn't a natural politician & needs to generate excitement.
723741725534072832 2016-04-22 05:14:08 UTC <Vva10967> @FiveThirtyEight if Bernie had plan 2 flip Senate & House to Dem his plans wouldn't be DOA & revolution's turning out thousands not millions
723740527569580034 2016-04-22 05:09:22 UTC <Vva10967> @FiveThirtyEight Bernie's running 4 POTUS & not dictator & has no plan 2 achieve his proposals. Ignores House & Senate R GOP controlled
722986355630829568 2016-04-20 03:12:34 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes agreed & he should admit that he hasn't gotten the millions & millions of people that he needed 4 his political revolution
722952620554342400 2016-04-20 00:58:31 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes this isn't the general election, it's a primary where the party's members choose the party's nominee. True of GOP as well.
722638322204569600 2016-04-19 04:09:36 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod you obviously haven't seen what Jeff Weaver told MSNBC about @SenSanders plan to overturn popular vote in Dem primary
722454973859119104 2016-04-19 16:01:02 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod yeah but that's bc @SenSanders hasn't been attacked by the GOP yet while @HillaryClinton has & for 25 years.
722229370367123457 2016-04-18 01:04:34 UTC <Vva10967> @PaulBegala @mattyglesias actually in 2016 we have a 24/7 media that turns every stupid comment made into "news".
722183273506598912 2016-04-18 22:01:24 UTC <Vva10967> Bueno el partido rival no trabaja con nadie pero eso no es culpa de Hillary. Asi fuera el mismo Jesus, los Republicanos le dirian que no
722182796177993728 2016-04-18 21:59:30 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews bueno realmente se discute que tanto poder tiene el Presidente de EEUU y si puede dar el alivio migratorio sin el Congreso
722177115785949185 2016-04-18 21:36:56 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein Hillary is winning the popular vote & pledged delegate count, we don't elect our nominee "by polls", you have to actually VOTE.
721743375444090880 2016-04-17 16:53:24 UTC <Vva10967> @KatyTurNBC I guess he is going with "Lying Ted" because Cruz uses "TrusTed" as own slogan but "Canadian Ted" fits better, just saying.
721505597565313024 2016-04-16 01:08:34 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews sounds like @SenTomCotton isn't fit for office if he is so scared of terrorism. Should worry about US gun shootings instead.
720837841010339842 2016-04-14 04:55:08 UTC <Vva10967> @jonfavs saying he'll convince superdelegates to steal nomination from Hillary even if she wins popular vote & pledged delegates is worse
720836504973512704 2016-04-14 04:49:49 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid her answer has been that we (USA) cannot force our will on a new sovereign nation & we offered help to Libya & they said NO.
720403425330987008 2016-04-13 00:08:55 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @Lawrence especially at the Democratic Debate tomorrow. @wolfblitzer. Bernie should tell us what happens to the banks' employees
720402799733776384 2016-04-13 00:06:26 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid wow, she managed to find someone WORSE than Scalia!  lol.
720133361092702208 2016-04-12 06:15:47 UTC <Vva10967> @newrepublic @NewRepublic @JoyAnnReid hate to tell you but international news say US names R being released in next couple weeks so this story is bogus
719327452498116608 2016-04-10 00:53:23 UTC <Vva10967> @politico so does Cruz (triggers general election bloodbath for GOP). Another case of the pot calling the kettle black, lol.
719225798830485505 2016-04-10 18:09:27 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews pero jefe de FBI Comey es Republicano y unica razon por K existe tal investigacion es K se trata de Hillary Clinton.
719221873968607232 2016-04-10 17:53:51 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica your translation of English headlines into Spanish leaves much to be desired. Jugar de locales? RU using Google Translator???
719219775453442048 2016-04-10 17:45:31 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod @SenSanders has a hard time admitting mistakes.  He read the WAPO headline & assumed it was true.  His bad.
718926598087581701 2016-04-09 22:20:32 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod so @Pontifex will be away while @SenSanders is there?
718925994355212288 2016-04-09 22:18:08 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @JorgeMarioCab ustedes pierden muchisimo tiempo analizando cada una de las estupideces que se le ocurren a Trump.
718507029359435776 2016-04-08 18:33:19 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 timing is very risky given NY primary.  Spanish news reported trip earlier as a normal event btw.
718495045435973632 2016-04-08 17:45:42 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid the bail & public defender systems R broken 2 & we make it impossible 4 people who leave jail to find jobs & housing & move on
718301145198960641 2016-04-07 04:55:13 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 problem 2 is his revolution isn't turning out the millions of people he says & GOP turnout in WI was 84000+ higher than Dem
718295020453961728 2016-04-07 04:30:52 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid problem is he went by  the wapo headline & like Trump can't admit when he is wrong and/or apologize. Maybe it's a male thing.
718242945837723649 2016-04-07 01:03:57 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes NY hot dogs?  lol
718242238212481025 2016-04-07 01:01:08 UTC <Vva10967> @CBSNews @BernieSanders @charlierose Actually the @washingtonpost attacked him not @HillaryClinton, THEIR headline said he was unqualified
718148487448293376 2016-04-07 18:48:36 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports @MSNBC apparently not, lol.
718148188612509700 2016-04-07 18:47:25 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 under that criteria, so did President Obama, lol.
717950625422708736 2016-04-06 05:42:22 UTC <Vva10967> @AlanKestrel750 @gdebenedetti w/ the exception of voting for Iraq war all the others apply to Obama 2 so is Obama not qualified either???
717946361082159104 2016-04-06 05:25:25 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports @HillaryClinton so did Pres Obama so according to @SenSanders Obama is not qualified to be POTUS either???
717943307511459841 2016-04-06 05:13:17 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein according to @SenSanders criteria Barack Obama was not "qualified" to be POTUS in 2012 since he too had a super PAC
717775875597578240 2016-04-06 18:07:59 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid but effects of not voting in 2010 midterm will last until at least 2021 due to GOP governorship gains & resulting gerrymandering
717564502355656704 2016-04-05 04:08:03 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @MSNBC @hardball_chris Ann Coulter, really? & Michele Bachmann the other day? & now Hugh Hewitt too?  who picks these people?
717561711667126272 2016-04-05 03:56:58 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid too late, had to turn off @MSNBC @maddow after seeing Hugh Hewitt there, as if having Ann Coulter earlier wasn't bad enough! YUK
717146715187494913 2016-04-04 00:27:55 UTC <Vva10967> @AC360 thought you all were going to stop giving Trump free press???
716648462058668032 2016-04-03 15:28:02 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @AdryanaBoyne No le mandaron el memo avisando q NO debia mencionar resultados logicos d politicas republicanas q asusten al publico
716645088185749509 2016-04-03 15:14:38 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto pero lo que dijo Trump es el resultado LOGICO de hacer el aborto ilegal.  En El Salvador mujeres son encarceladas por abortar.
716331136159453184 2016-04-02 18:27:06 UTC <Vva10967> @CoryBooker TY. I support labeling too & the right of consumers to decide. If others want to eat GMOs, hey, it's a free country- I don't.
716329879999004672 2016-04-02 18:22:06 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews pero ese odio no lo creo Trump, sino que viene siendo fomentado por el mismo partido republicano desde la eleccion de Obama
716032124596436992 2016-04-01 22:38:56 UTC <Vva10967> @luckybastard77 @JoyAnnReid Sherrod is a nice guy but BORING & Hillary needs someone who can ignite folks at rallies & on campaign trail
716031131540393984 2016-04-01 22:34:59 UTC <Vva10967> @CyEdmunds @JoyAnnReid  maybe she should offer Bernie USTR so he can negotiate fair trade agreements & monitor fairness of current ones, lol
716029934800646144 2016-04-01 22:30:14 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid I think Hillary will go for Julian Castro who is young and Latino & would be able to run for POTUS in 2024.
716029128047271936 2016-04-01 22:27:01 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Obama didn't choose Hillary for his VP either yet she put party first & not just endorsed Obama but nominated him to unite party
715939733063516161 2016-04-01 16:31:48 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein looks like NYS will pass $15 minimum too but w faster implementation in NYC: http://on.ny.gov/1PIHPEZ
715760382141460485 2016-03-31 04:39:07 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes no surprise there @Residente loves all the socialist regimes in Latin America & raps about social injustice all the time
715398735631491073 2016-03-30 04:42:04 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid too bad #maddow didn't ask him about his campaign's letter vilifying @HillaryClinton for doing just that w Clooney event.
715396405058113537 2016-03-30 04:32:49 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid and then they criticize @HillaryClinton for fundraising for the Democratic Party & down ticket candidates w George Clooney event
713231959921700864 2016-03-24 05:12:05 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @SidSeven777 nah Palin already said that she wants to be sec of energy lol so about those centrifuges & enriched uranium...
713077147951370240 2016-03-24 18:56:55 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews sorry but @FortuneMagazine is messed up! How are you a world's greatest leader? & they put Bezos as #1 & left Obama out???
713072942796697601 2016-03-24 18:40:12 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews lol Hannity's business model is to make white americans hate everybody else, that is how he makes his millions $$$
712420993113989121 2016-03-22 23:29:35 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica No, el ataque fue en Brussels y no en USA.  Que va a hacer en la Casa Blanca que no pueda hacer desde Air Force One?  Nada.
712420432998178816 2016-03-22 23:27:22 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC one can only hope that the voters will finally retire him from office, he's been sooooo bitter since he lost to Obama.
711586694257049601 2016-03-20 16:14:23 UTC <Vva10967> @POTUS why not seek injunctive relief from SCOTUS to force Senate to hold hearings & vote on #SCOTUSnominee as req'd by US Constitution?
711586025102036992 2016-03-20 16:11:43 UTC <Vva10967> @NinaTotenberg why can't @POTUS seek injunctive relief from SCOTUS to force Senate to hold hearings & vote on #SCOTUSnominee per US Constit?
711406896171847680 2016-03-19 04:19:56 UTC <Vva10967> @nytimes mmmm could it be that the media covers everything he does as "news" 24/7 and for free???
709981346903552001 2016-03-15 05:55:18 UTC <Vva10967> @tamarakeithNPR @BernieSanders makes @HillaryClinton a better candidate w issues & debates & keeps media attention on dem platform #all good
709979597643890688 2016-03-15 05:48:21 UTC <Vva10967> @OnsightIT @JoyAnnReid a managing director is a title for investment bankers. Heidi Cruz is NOT on the Goldman Sachs board of directors.
709949414958301184 2016-03-15 03:48:25 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid plus the IRS elimination that Cruz' major donor Robert Mercer needs since he owes $6 BILLION in taxes.
709948797745496065 2016-03-15 03:45:58 UTC <Vva10967> @ariannahuff well the "abolish the IRS" has to do with the $6 billion in taxes that are owed by Cruz' major donor Robert Mercer
709943612436570112 2016-03-15 03:25:21 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid no she isn't.  Her title at GS was probably "Managing Director" which is an investment banker title.  http://bit.ly/1b0u9J8
709855927889952769 2016-03-15 21:36:56 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Dems should leave the GOP alone & concentrate in their own election.  Both Trump & Cruz R awful so what difference does it make
709818848430714881 2016-03-15 19:09:35 UTC <Vva10967> @KatyTurNBC actually Mitch says to Trump that "it might be a good idea to", lol.
709793061686145024 2016-03-15 17:27:07 UTC <Vva10967> @MaddowBlog would love to see a special report on whether USA can renegotiate or even repudiate trade agreements +/or impose import tariffs
709792226633715712 2016-03-15 17:23:48 UTC <Vva10967> @CronicasSabado por que no hacen programa analizando si USA puede o no repudiar tratados de libre comercio e imponer tarifas de importacion?
709492546217578496 2016-03-14 21:32:59 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto tiene gracia, como si a Ryan o a los demas Republicanos les importaran los immigrantes y/o los indocumentados.
708889940998889472 2016-03-12 05:38:27 UTC <Vva10967> @brakktonbooker @NPR @marcorubio seems "streak" consists of winning places that have no electoral votes in the general election lol
708004534119960576 2016-03-10 19:00:09 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein Hillary expected @jorgeramosnews to ask seriuos questions & not start attacking her with 100% FoxNews propaganda
708002174954049537 2016-03-10 18:50:47 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports you used to be a serious journalist, what happened to you?  Obama's only contribution to the rise of Trump is being black
708000267845894144 2016-03-10 18:43:12 UTC <Vva10967> @CrystalClarityy @jorgeramosnews bc HC is a lawyer & knows POTUS must enforce the law & that Bernie would say yes bc he makes empty promises
707997363776983041 2016-03-10 18:31:40 UTC <Vva10967> @spicetc @jorgeramosnews oh please! Jorge was being rude & both decided to go along, the law is the law & the POTUS has to enforce it
707995347331751936 2016-03-10 18:23:39 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews and it's meaningless, the POTUS has to uphold the law and if someone has an order of deportation he/she will get deported
707994364744744960 2016-03-10 18:19:45 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews very disappointed in you, felt like I was watching a Faux News debate where you expect unsubstantiated smears against HC
707686255367229440 2016-03-09 21:55:26 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid Rubio has no accomplishments, doesn't show up for his Senate work, can't think on his feet, why would anybody want him as VP?
707636111544360961 2016-03-09 18:36:10 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump should go w/ Outsourcer-in-chief- outsourcing POTUS job to Canadian -no American job is safe from Carly, lol.
707625012669386752 2016-03-09 17:52:04 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein claims that Obama is muslim, was born in Kenya, is illegitimate POTUS, etc fuel Trump base as much as Obamacare #SouthernStrategy
707624183732314113 2016-03-09 17:48:47 UTC <Vva10967> @ezraklein it wasn't just GOP's response to Obamacare but GOP's response to the black presidency of which response to Obamacare was a part
707619542051241984 2016-03-09 17:30:20 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC Cheney made fracking exempt from Clean Air Act & Clean Water Act;exemption should be revoked to save our water; can't drink oil
707615812933328897 2016-03-09 17:15:31 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews hope you look into the effect of right wing radio in your HBO Special.
707059267539443712 2016-03-07 04:24:00 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid did anyone tell Rubio that FL is a closed primary and that MSNBC viewers are highly unlikely to be Republicans? too funny!
706973585097756672 2016-03-07 22:43:32 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid when you are white you don't know what it's like to be poor?  I'm pretty sure that southern whites would disagree with him...
706930993949712387 2016-03-07 19:54:17 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @taddevine I don't see NY being in play.  Hillary was a very effective Senator for NY and we came to see her as a fellow NYer.
706358866896949248 2016-03-05 06:00:52 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @JorgeGCastaneda eso seria entrar en el circo de Trump y darle aun mas cobetura gratis en los medios y prensa
705654349343555585 2016-03-03 07:21:21 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto la contaminacion de Flint la causo el governador Republicano de Michigan al cambiar la fuente de agua para ahorrar dinero
705646113873743873 2016-03-03 06:48:38 UTC <Vva10967> @BillKristol @davidaxelrod Rubio probably didn't rehearse that Q&A and he can't think on his feet if his life depended on it lol
705496643077083136 2016-03-03 20:54:41 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports @janeosanders @BernieSanders @HillaryClinton good for them, last thing we want is to make Dem debates trashy like GOP's
705476692098338818 2016-03-03 19:35:25 UTC <Vva10967> @AristeguiOnline Tanto @marcorubio como @realDonaldTrump quieren deportar a los 11 millones de indocumentados si ganan, incluyendo Dreamers
705472174883250177 2016-03-03 19:17:28 UTC <Vva10967> @UniNoticias Reforma migratoria, historia de un sueo detenido en el Congreso POR LOS REPUBLICANOS y DAPA detenida por GOP en cortes tambien
705470444825153536 2016-03-03 19:10:35 UTC <Vva10967> @njdotcom @GovChristie so he's just pretending to be one? lol
705469041931116544 2016-03-03 19:05:01 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod well Republicans like the "telling it like it is" approach, lol.
705103840568287232 2016-03-02 18:53:50 UTC <Vva10967> @HMFL85 @JoyAnnReid perhaps but GOP stopped contesting ideas on Jan 20 2009 & instead became party of No & are now reaping what they sowed
704545585207050240 2016-02-29 05:55:31 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid but in all fairness SHE was the senator from NY & got to see all the 9/11 destruction first hand for months to come
704035034982965249 2016-02-28 20:06:47 UTC <Vva10967> @NateSilver538 you mean voting eligible in that particular state, correct? can't imagine that NH would have 9.7% of the US voting-eligible
703469966343987200 2016-02-26 06:41:24 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews si Trump no puede ganar sin el voto Latino para que quieres que @EPN le responda y se meta en el circo Republicano?
703117234571386880 2016-02-25 07:19:46 UTC <Vva10967> @KatyTurNBC @NBCNews does he then drop out if he loses to Trump?  Lol
703115980617052161 2016-02-25 07:14:47 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews el de Cruz dijo es deportar a todos los ilegales y no permitirles volver mas si tienen hijos nacidos en USA #Decision2016
703113099864182784 2016-02-25 07:03:20 UTC <Vva10967> @ArturoNALEO even though @RealBenCarson said he gave @NALEO same canned speech he gives everyone else & didn't prepare anything special 4 u?
703110568148803584 2016-02-25 06:53:17 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews he won't deport them but will never let them become US citizens & vote thus keeping them as 2nd class citizens 4 ever.
703109086661910528 2016-02-25 06:47:24 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @CNN wait until you get to Maria Celeste's immigration question to Trump -it was like watching an sln sketch lol
702398793069760512 2016-02-23 07:44:56 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews @FusionNews Cruz has consistently said that he would deport all illegals even the dreamers that are protected now by DACA
702398025075924992 2016-02-23 07:41:53 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews por que excluyes a Rubio? El ya dijo que eliminara DACA el primer dia si llega a ser presidente
702391182974914560 2016-02-23 07:14:42 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid @cleotiger17 @sahilkapur those who are Latino & still republican don't care about GOP's stand on immigration
701653380868009985 2016-02-21 06:22:56 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas @jorgeramosnews @jdbalart Marco Rubio now says that if elected POTUS he'll end DACA on day 1https://twitter.com/HuffingtonPost/status/701283834604744704
701643017049010176 2016-02-21 05:41:45 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJ the Mexican guy has no funding and no helpers, is doing all on his own.  Hope you don't think that was the case with Michaelangelo...
701641592013242368 2016-02-21 05:36:06 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod 2 cuban americans who show zero compassion for immigrants and are competing for which one can deport all the dreamers faster
701505234590375940 2016-02-21 20:34:15 UTC <Vva10967> Sad when Trump is the lesser of 2 evils:  Why I'm more worried about Marco Rubio than Donald Trump http://www.vox.com/2016/2/20/11067932/rubio-worse-than-trump?utm_campaign=vox&utm_content=article%3Atop&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter via @voxdotcom
701277247030874112 2016-02-20 05:28:19 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas la realidad es que su hermano dejo el pais en colapso economico, invadio el pais equivocado e ignoro memo sobre ataque d 9/11
701252426377072640 2016-02-20 03:49:41 UTC <Vva10967> @costareports when do you think that Ben Carson will drop out?  i.e. how much money does he have left?
699450861840420864 2016-02-15 04:30:55 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid was SC spared when the economy melted in September 2008?  How can he be popular there, or anywhere really?
698976202200117249 2016-02-14 21:04:47 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews look into right wing radio & their message of hate & you will understand why the GOP base hates Latinos so much
698975222658162690 2016-02-14 21:00:54 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews they have done more than turn their backs on hispanics, they want to cancel DACA & DAPA & deport all 11 million immigrants
698772608691601408 2016-02-13 07:35:47 UTC <Vva10967> @CNNPolitics do your homework! Justice Kennedy was confirmed in 1988 which was an election year by unanimous vote of Senate. Total BS
698762658531643392 2016-02-13 06:56:14 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews Al Gore hubiera leido el memo de la CIA q decia que Bin Laden nos iba a atacar y no hubiese invadido el pais equivocado, Iraq
698753823159033856 2016-02-13 06:21:08 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid both are traitors and latinos hold grudges, so no way.  GOP thinks Spanish surname is enough and are mistaken.
698750111577436160 2016-02-13 06:06:23 UTC <Vva10967> @DavidCornDC Trump wanted to take down W before W got to SC on Monday.  Seems to me that he did very well
698748731756322816 2016-02-13 06:00:54 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews El titulo de peor presidente pertenece a Bush q permitio el ataque de 9/11, invadio el pais equivocado y destruyo la economia
698747245693427714 2016-02-13 05:55:00 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews cierto @marcorubio porque Reagan creia en la amnistia y vos no.  Otra frase memorizada de robot.  #marcobot
698735618357125125 2016-02-13 05:08:47 UTC <Vva10967> @davidaxelrod so @tedcruz was talking about himself again? lol
698734617424220160 2016-02-13 05:04:49 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid But Cruz got called by moderator on his lie that no justice had been confirmed in election year when Justice Kennedy was in 1988
698683641405247489 2016-02-13 01:42:15 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid enraging the Left in an election yr would b bad 4 voter turnout. Better to nominate a liberal & make it about taking Senate back
698679694720442368 2016-02-13 01:26:34 UTC <Vva10967> @Aidansheart @SenateMajLdr Approve or Disapprove, not wait until we elect a new POTUS and deny the current POTUS the nomination.
698673570512293889 2016-02-13 01:02:14 UTC <Vva10967> @SenateMajLdr Mitch, WE, the American people, elected President Obama to fill all SCOTUS vacancies until he leaves office, remember?#Scalia
697871097954508801 2016-02-11 19:53:30 UTC <Vva10967> @WSJ whatever happened to the national debt being too large and needing to reduce it?  thought that was a Conservative Principle?
697464515806375936 2016-02-10 16:57:53 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto los Republicanos vienen fomentando odio hacia extranjeros y minorias desde que Obama gano en 2008 y ahora cosechan lo q sembraron
697285229820641280 2016-02-09 05:05:28 UTC <Vva10967> @eldiariony pero la reforma migratoria que ofrece Kasich NO incluye un camino a la ciudadania
696413180919209984 2016-02-07 19:20:15 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @FreddyBalsera 100% de acuerdo @marcorubio y @tedcruz son los Clarence Thomas de los Latinos.Suben por ser Latinos y meten cuchillo
696411120987459584 2016-02-07 19:12:04 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @adolfofrancoGOP El primer Presidente Latino de USA sera Julian Castro @SecretaryCastro en 2024.  Tener nombre Latino NO es enough.
696409369861345282 2016-02-07 19:05:07 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @adolfofrancoGOP Mas bien en Nov 2016 GOP repetira su analisis post-funeral preguntandose de nuevo porque perdieron la Casa Blanca
696407456579252224 2016-02-07 18:57:30 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @ottoreich talvez pero no es falso decir que Cruz, Rubio y Trump estan en contra y q la base Republicana los apoya y les aplaude
696405535411826689 2016-02-07 18:49:52 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto deberian explicarle al senor que a partir de Citizens United se necesita entre 1 y 2 BILLONES de dolares para ser Presidente de USA
696405015964033024 2016-02-07 18:47:49 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto parace que nadie le dijo al senor que ser Presidente en USA cuesta entre 1 y 2 BILLONES de dolares a causa de Citizens United
696404239636107268 2016-02-07 18:44:43 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @adolfofrancoGOP @ottoreich Dios no lo permita.  Eso es como haber nominado a Clarence Thomas a SCOTUS por ser afro americano.
696401971935322112 2016-02-07 18:35:43 UTC <Vva10967> @mariaramirezNY a los ninos les gustan los robots, lol, que pena q sus padres tengan el intelecto de un nino y no de adultos
696394892554170368 2016-02-07 18:07:35 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews a Rubio solo le interesa su futuro politico y si para alcanzarlo tiene que darle una patada a los hispanos, lo hace.
696236537059663873 2016-02-06 07:38:20 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas because according to Republicans Pres Obama should be deporting ALL 11 million undocumented just like they plan to do
696152389364097024 2016-02-06 02:03:58 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas @johnizonline Opportunism of course  Rubio will say & do anything to win GOP base and that will not change, even betrayed Jeb
696151043403595776 2016-02-06 01:58:37 UTC <Vva10967> @MariaESalinas and the reason the Immigration Reform didn't pass is because GOP refused to put it up for a vote!  Rubio lies.
696150650976104448 2016-02-06 01:57:03 UTC <Vva10967> @pewresearch @falconalina except for the Republicans who see immigration as a burden, and use it as a scapegoat
696149359461855232 2016-02-06 01:51:55 UTC <Vva10967> @TelemundoNews but Kasich would keep the 11MM as 2nd class citizens with no path to citizenship
695774425178836992 2016-02-05 01:02:04 UTC <Vva10967> @JoyAnnReid that's no different than assuming women would vote for Palin because she was a woman.  Rubio and Cruz R Latinos' Clarence Thomas
695767333286113280 2016-02-05 00:33:53 UTC <Vva10967> @mitchellreports wouldn't your husband have received similar fees for his speeches after he left office? Why demonize @HillaryClinton 4 it?
695766170276904960 2016-02-05 00:29:16 UTC <Vva10967> @AlPunto @tedcruz @marcorubio ambos son unos traidores; es como haber escogido a Clarence Thomas como representante de Afr Amer en SCOTUS
695493709064962048 2016-02-04 06:26:36 UTC <Vva10967> @carl_chirinos @UniPolitica @HillaryClinton @BernieSanders Seamos francos si el hubiese sido el Senador de NY el tambien habria votado asi
695492427088527360 2016-02-04 06:21:30 UTC <Vva10967> @UniPolitica @BernieSanders @HillaryClinton No porque los Republicanos gastarian billones en ads asustando a la gente sobre su socialismo
695491487472209920 2016-02-04 06:17:46 UTC <Vva10967> @carl_chirinos @UniPolitica @HillaryClinton porque los Republicanos inventan rumores de investigaciones falsas y la gente se los cree
693870840748843008 2016-01-31 18:57:54 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews @marcorubio como van a comparar a Rubio con JFK? JFK defendia a los pobres y a las minorias y Rubio les da una patada
693870434178199552 2016-01-31 18:56:17 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews @marcorubio miente- SI habian suficientes votos a favor de reforma migratoria y republicanos la bloquearon en el Congreso
693867792345534468 2016-01-31 18:45:47 UTC <Vva10967> @jorgeramosnews @marcorubio es un mentiroso, a su base le dice que la legalizacion es amnistia y que el nunca apoyaria una amnistia.
692952516670144513 2016-01-28 06:08:49 UTC <Vva10967> @chrislhayes you are kidding right? Report REAL news when you all can continue reporting on Trump's latest tantrum 24/7? Not gonna happen
692594406378082304 2016-01-27 06:25:48 UTC <Vva10967> @TheLastWord who cares but he sure has gotten tons of free coverage from the media for his tantrum You all treat everything he does as news
690217703714480128 2016-01-21 17:01:38 UTC <Vva10967> @jack any chance you could add a bookmark icon? I use the heart icon as a substitute even if I don't love a tweet, just to find it again.
