967848594815569921 2018-02-25 19:47:41 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @funder When the young gentleman asked if Rubio would stop taking money from the NRA Rubio actually smiled. He immediatedly started using every conservative talking point in order to defuse the question. It's all about the money.
967846503992774658 2018-02-25 19:39:22 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @CNN PELOSI, YES....Feinstein, NO. Anyone who has heart surgery one day and the next day she's back to work is one tough cookie. I like Feinstein, she's a fighter! Pelosi needs to go and should be replaced, no doubt.

Ur budget actually takes $ away from people with low incomes in way of treatment facilities. Session's idea is to stop prescribing pain meds making asprin the substitute. STUPID.

Quote: "We have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memos accuracy. Which means: This is a partisan hit job to FALSELY smear the FBI/DOJ.
959233582052118529 2018-02-01 01:14:42 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @realDonaldTrump @GOP So... what the GOP is saying is that the media is only "fake" when you don't like what they report. Hmmm

959215468178563072 2018-02-01 00:02:43 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @StephenMilIer @Elfinmirror Y r u taking this whole matter so lightly? Nunes, (a member of the Trump transition team) made a deal with the DOJ/FBI when they gave him the classified info to scan. He was told NOT to share the info in public. He did it anyway..no honor no trust.
959214368176181250 2018-02-01 23:58:21 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @StephenMilIer @Elfinmirror According to the FBI Chief, "we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy." I don't know about you but, "grave concerns" and "fundamentally impact" are strong words.
959182189010259968 2018-02-01 21:50:29 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @politvidchannel What ever makes them sleep at night...
959182017949831168 2018-02-01 21:49:48 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @politvidchannel They r saving all their energy to scream about the "deep state" and "fake news". The rest of the time they parrot talking points like: "There is no collusion", "this investigation is a witch hunt" and of course, "this whole thing is a big nothing burger". lol
959179875356692481 2018-02-01 21:41:17 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats @FrankLuntz @FoxNews How do you sleep at night @IngrahamAngle ? Oh wait, I know...You get paid the big bucks to lie and distort reality. How's it feel to be a souless opinion journalist who's job it is to screw with your viewer's head's??
959177074664792064 2018-02-01 21:30:09 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @StephenMilIer Did you conviently forget that TRUMP hand picked Christopher Wray to head the FBI?? Does that mean Trump is the master of the so called "deep state"?
959176602344189953 2018-02-01 21:28:17 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> You are coming unglued there, @StephenMilIer. Flailing and thrashing out by spouting more conspiracy theories is not going to save you or Trump from being taken out in HANDCUFF'S!
959174494492471296 2018-02-01 21:19:54 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @StephenMilIer @Elfinmirror The entire smear campaign is an effort to discredit the FBI & the DOJ in order to prove Trump is being targeted unfairly by both depts. It's clear they do not care who they hurt in the process. Anyone associated with the intelligence agency's r under fire.
958897930483716096 2018-01-31 03:00:56 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> Trump loyalists who do his bidding are apparently as smart as a box of rocks.https://twitter.com/OfficialJonZal/status/958894264972439555
958896807433658368 2018-01-31 02:56:28 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @RepAdamSchiff The "President" probably told Nunes to put this group of republican's together in the first place. Of course he is going to put that memo out. Four pages of Info War type script designed to contort facts and create conspiracy theories..right up Trump's alley.
958894800387952640 2018-01-31 02:48:30 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> Of course David Duke would tweet about his favorite President..https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/958708466360733696

958396722409099265 2018-01-30 17:49:19 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @SenBlumenthal Trump is the new O.J. Just like the "dream team" who claimed the DNA evidence was tampered with and the detective collecting evidence was deemed a racist in order to get O.J. off. We are seeing an eerie comparison. The GOP is the new dream team.
958391116843356160 2018-01-30 17:27:02 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @MorningEdition So many country's including the U.S. have had a dark past that we regret. Looking back it's spine chilling. With each generation we have learned not to repeat our past but, to move forward...at least we did. On Nov. 8th 2016 that all changed..
958388662567399426 2018-01-30 17:17:17 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @StephenMilIer You are a total joke!! You and your cronies would rather destroy the entire Federal Intellegence agency including the department of justice and the 100s of thousands that work to protect the U.S. and it's citizens just to protect the Lord of chaos!
958109097731198977 2018-01-29 22:46:24 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @JesseBWatters @FoxNews Who care's? As long as Mueller continues doing exactly what he was hired to do.. Investigate the Russian interferrence/collusion with the Trump campaign, obstruction and possible money laundering. Trump certainly hasn't done anything to stop Russia.
958106086363615232 2018-01-29 22:34:26 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @nikkihaley You certainly have done a 180 since you delivered this speech in 2016.

955679755571007488 2018-01-22 05:53:04 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> Once Nunes says YES to HIMSELF..he can then "decide to bring the committee back together for a vote." 3rd, "If the majority of the committee votes to release the memo, it would then be up to President Trump.  If he says yes, the memo can be released."....

955675528673054721 2018-01-22 05:36:16 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @FoxNews 2nd "If the majority of the committee votes to release the memo, it would then be up to President Trump." OOOOH, that's a huge hurdle...NOT! 3rd. If the President say's YES then these idiot's can stop the suspence and release their stupid memo.
955674868695097344 2018-01-22 05:33:38 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @FoxNews "The documents release would 1st need approval from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif." SINCE HE'S the head of the commitee HE CAN RELEASE IT! The 2nd stupid hurdle is as follow's...
955673269398654977 2018-01-22 05:27:17 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @FoxNews Y the suspence?? Isn't this a Repub. memo, written by a team of House Republican's?? Why are they pretending they can't release it or that someone is stopping them from releasing it? This is the most rediculous bunch of bullshit I have ever seen in my life.

955518231392980992 2018-01-22 19:11:13 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @FoxNews Which is why Trump is sending mixed signals about DACA and is leaving the immigration bill to congress...he can blame them if the sh*t hit's the fan. Typical Donny, he will never take responsibility for anything.
955516699947741185 2018-01-22 19:05:08 UTC <LeeAnneJarrett5> @realDonaldTrump @HalewoodJ Give it time...Trump has only been in office for a year.  His leadership role around the world has plummeted & has bowed out of the new industrial revolution on energy but, he's totally on board with allowing people from predominately white countries to come to America.
