970446587301306368 2018-03-04 23:51:11 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SethSharp35 Vegas in person is a great race. Today was boring IMO
970423939670294528 2018-03-04 22:21:11 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass Personally I dont think they ought to count laps between stages. Kinda like on the Saturday night short track racing of old

968874152009465857 2018-02-28 15:42:53 UTC <dalefan34ever> @StrokerAceKid @J_Milliken Oh yea ok. Ive hunted them several times in California but always used bigger calibers. You know, just in case 
968681526744432640 2018-02-27 02:57:27 UTC <dalefan34ever> @hannity Dont worry @ChelseaClinton he follows @Hannity
968681259986665472 2018-02-27 02:56:24 UTC <dalefan34ever> @ChelseaClinton Wow @Fredhowardfan thats awfully narrow minded of you. Have a wonderful night.
968650824623603712 2018-02-27 00:55:27 UTC <dalefan34ever> @guskenworthy I forgot to say THANK YOU for representing the United States so well!
968650326159929344 2018-02-27 00:53:29 UTC <dalefan34ever> @guskenworthy Id report each of those accounts individually. They explicitly break @Twitter rules. Theres no place for that behavior in this world
968647202468806656 2018-02-27 00:41:04 UTC <dalefan34ever> @StrokerAceKid @jayjensix Im a fan of the old fashioned double barrel 12.  Nothing quite like the sound racking a shotgun.
968615642940129280 2018-02-27 22:35:39 UTC <dalefan34ever> @StrokerAceKid Ok. Thanks.
968615070858018816 2018-02-27 22:33:23 UTC <dalefan34ever> @StrokerAceKid I cant remember. Do they shoot 223 or 5.56?
968614876854669312 2018-02-27 22:32:37 UTC <dalefan34ever> @StrokerAceKid Oh I have no doubt. Havent shot one yet.
968614409042980864 2018-02-27 22:30:45 UTC <dalefan34ever> @StrokerAceKid In a non argumentative, debating way, I somewhat agree. I think an AR shoots .223(?) As far as I know you cant hunt big game with it. And clips of 30 and 50 rounds arent needed. Ban bump stocks too. IMO. Not meaning to argue.

968502414016835584 2018-02-27 15:05:44 UTC <dalefan34ever> @jeff_gluck I wonder why the switch away from Smithfield. Issues with RPM?
968361051350798336 2018-02-26 05:44:00 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNNStyle @CNN I dunno why but this looks like you @colepearn
968248624445505536 2018-02-26 22:17:15 UTC <dalefan34ever> @mikejoy500 It absolutely astonishes me how, on every Monday, you get attacked for the previous weekends race commentary. Heres another spin. I think you @LarryMac28 and @AllWaltrip do a great job along with your crew!
968203623812317184 2018-02-26 19:18:26 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MartySmithESPN I saw it over the weekend. Outstanding movie. Definitely appreciate our men and women

967503935450722305 2018-02-24 20:58:08 UTC <dalefan34ever> @RookieCityCop I hear that! Explaining jokes is the worst.

966701604412862466 2018-02-22 15:49:57 UTC <dalefan34ever> Dear @waynelapierrejr @NRA you slighted politicians several times for not doing enough in Washington. Why then do you keep sending them donations? Hmm?
966126137721016320 2018-02-20 01:43:15 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN Then prove it @POTUS. Pass STRICT gun legislation. Otherwise youre nothing more than a spineless liar.

965997337771368448 2018-02-20 17:11:27 UTC <dalefan34ever> @IronStache Im also a gun owner and support the second amendment. California has or at least used to have a fourteen day waiting period. Works for me. We MUST address mental health issues.

963837171781152768 2018-02-14 18:07:43 UTC <dalefan34ever> @goodyear @DaleJr Saw this a little while ago. Brought a little tear to my eye. Great @Goodyear spot!

963446377089912833 2018-02-13 16:14:50 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NFLPlayFootball CTE and lifelong trouble. Is it worth it? Ask Junior Seaus widow. Or Frank Gifford. Or Ken Stablers. The list sadly goes on and on...

962016019244920833 2018-02-09 17:31:07 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass are Mark Thompson and Brendan Gaughan really running triple digit numbers? Didnt think Cup did that.

947180149039968256 2017-12-30 18:58:39 UTC <dalefan34ever> @cnnbrk @TaylorL07 Because police responded with information that it was indeed a hostage situation. They cant guess.

911682188680224769 2017-09-23 20:02:26 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SteveLetarte I agree with taking away practice time. They were bad boys. But the whole thing? And then making him sit in car with no communication. Nope.
911680389642559488 2017-09-23 19:55:17 UTC <dalefan34ever> @KeithOlbermann Took the words right out of my mouth

911660904348925952 2017-09-23 18:37:52 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SteveLetarte I do not get putting him in the car with no phone. So he cant even TALK about the car? Nascar is turning into a joke
911656991474335744 2017-09-23 18:22:19 UTC <dalefan34ever> @gamedaynation @SteveLetarte I agree with @GamedayNation making him sit out practice is one thing but making him sit IN THE CAR and strapped in is BS!
911653867112169472 2017-09-23 18:09:54 UTC <dalefan34ever> @jeff_gluck how many times did Logano fail tech yesterday? Im not a fan of his at all but thats crap to put him on pit road.

907979448024104961 2017-09-13 14:49:04 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SethSharp35 Stats be damned, she's been great for NASCAR. IMHO #NASCAR needs to expand gender and ethnicity. Soon
907738945265459200 2017-09-12 22:53:24 UTC <dalefan34ever> @dustinlong I think it was huge in the beginning but with her not improving it's gotten less.

905590569841201152 2017-09-06 00:36:31 UTC <dalefan34ever> @uofracing My curiosity is, should the CHAMPIONSHIP be taken away if penalty warranted. Lugs not included but suspension etc
905589818876297216 2017-09-06 00:33:32 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass But would they strip the championship team if there was a penalty? Lug nuts wouldn't be good enough reason imo in that circumstance
905539901138993153 2017-09-06 21:15:11 UTC <dalefan34ever> @Acosta Have the checks clears the bank ?
905520200518270976 2017-09-06 19:56:54 UTC <dalefan34ever> @jeff_gluck So neither Hamlin or Logano are in the playoffs as it stands?
905483224557559808 2017-09-06 17:29:58 UTC <dalefan34ever> @dustinlong Absolutely. Wreck driver in front of me or miss playoffs? Yes. Unless it's a teammate but otherwise yes.
905464708303511552 2017-09-06 16:16:23 UTC <dalefan34ever> @jemelehill It should have never happened. This country is better than this. Cmon people.

896108410118094848 2017-08-11 20:37:48 UTC <dalefan34ever> @JamieLittleTV There are tons. I'm still narrowing down the choices between the young guns.
895824369414422528 2017-08-10 01:49:07 UTC <dalefan34ever> @ChelseaClinton Expecting mothers that are drug free should be covered no matter what

895784462100840449 2017-08-10 23:10:33 UTC <dalefan34ever> @jeff_gluck I've said that since day one. HOPEFULLY NASCAR won't see a major decline in attendance next year

895667282294198272 2017-08-10 15:24:55 UTC <dalefan34ever> @JoyAnnReid I guess while our skin is melting and we're suffocating we'll have some time to think about the emails.
895657062704726016 2017-08-10 14:44:18 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN Yea that's priority. Emails over nuclear weapons
895646056066629632 2017-08-10 14:00:34 UTC <dalefan34ever> @nascarcasm Young empty glass
895436933169520641 2017-08-09 00:09:35 UTC <dalefan34ever> @jeff_gluck I think he did it right. He has two 500 wins several at Dega and is a fan fave. Case closed.
895400590649446402 2017-08-09 21:45:11 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN That's BS. Just because it's 'unarmed' means nothing. They use planes as weapons now.
895400251170766848 2017-08-09 21:43:50 UTC <dalefan34ever> @KeithOlbermann WTF?! Why can other countries fly over D.C.? Do they not remember 9/11?

893497430242611200 2017-08-04 15:42:42 UTC <dalefan34ever> @nascarcasm Yea but at least there you can lean on a Daytona 500 winning car.

893262262718185473 2017-08-03 00:08:14 UTC <dalefan34ever> @GeorgeTakei I used to be incredibly proud to be an American. I'm losing that with this President.
893214527700975616 2017-08-03 20:58:33 UTC <dalefan34ever> @seanhannity Nope only one needs to go is you.

892949780124401664 2017-08-02 03:26:32 UTC <dalefan34ever> @Acosta IMHO today was anything but inviting. It sounded like their goal was to make a more pure nation as a certain race group calls it.
892750924703186945 2017-08-02 14:16:21 UTC <dalefan34ever> @BlackGirlNerds @candaceable @SFdirewolf I remember making the sports page as a teen and always being embarrassed. Of course I always gave a shoutout to my good friend @Candace !
892563417541652480 2017-08-01 01:51:16 UTC <dalefan34ever> @DavidRagan the point you just raised about cup drivers/teams is spot on. Teams owners and drivers should be registered in one series.
892562754317369344 2017-08-01 01:48:38 UTC <dalefan34ever> @DavidRagan David I completely agree. Go where the money is less
892543183439122432 2017-08-01 00:30:52 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN Thats almost as bad as F1 quieting the cars!
892537140843749376 2017-08-01 00:06:51 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SethSharp35 I hear ya. I went to a truck race in 2001 and some of the haulers were blank white rigs pulled by pickups. It's gone awfully Hollywood
892534981607555072 2017-08-01 23:58:16 UTC <dalefan34ever> @Motorsport @jim_utter Dick move by Kyle IMO. If he closes KBM, that takes an up and coming driver butt out of the seat. For a good team. It's a shame.
892532474231701504 2017-08-01 23:48:18 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass What do you mean? Less races? More? Timing of schedule?

892071652971880452 2017-07-31 17:17:10 UTC <dalefan34ever> @KyleBusch @DavidW_Light Good point
892066482661629956 2017-07-31 16:56:37 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass I gotta agree. When a driver has won at all points paying tracks but one it becomes a thing.
892065327068008450 2017-07-31 16:52:02 UTC <dalefan34ever> @KelseyKKahne This guy beats the Charlotte fence climber by a mile but nothing beats the stolen pace car at Dega

871485820351397888 2017-06-04 21:56:25 UTC <dalefan34ever> Should NASCAR have cleaned the track off more at the end of the race? Would it have made a difference?

850503352572010496 2017-04-07 00:19:35 UTC <dalefan34ever> @GeorgeTakei Mr Takei I agree. McMaster and Mattis are experienced. @POTUS doesn't know what he's doing
850475531065671680 2017-04-07 22:29:02 UTC <dalefan34ever> @FiredupBethy @MalcolmNance I'm glad @VP gets to sir Dian with his family while thousands of Syrian families...???

850468495884034048 2017-04-07 22:01:05 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NastyMindy Ok that confirmed it. I have heard this from several sources that planes were moved. Ugh
850461111933575168 2017-04-07 21:31:44 UTC <dalefan34ever> @FiredupBethy 
850384599976779776 2017-04-07 16:27:42 UTC <dalefan34ever> @StewartHaasRcng Said owner of concrete company can now retire COMFORTABLY
850367598327775232 2017-04-07 15:20:09 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MattYocum His CC is probably getting an earful for that. Wreckin' loose!
850157957006241792 2017-04-06 01:27:06 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN everybody RT @POTUS this.
850153981334609920 2017-04-06 01:11:18 UTC <dalefan34ever> @KeithOlbermann Is there video because 
850091912753070080 2017-04-06 21:04:40 UTC <dalefan34ever> @realDonaldTrump @KeithOlbermann Proof he's corrupt
850086647941091328 2017-04-06 20:43:45 UTC <dalefan34ever> @FiredupBethy Remember that show where those crazies built bunkers into the side of hill? 
850080047134154752 2017-04-06 20:17:31 UTC <dalefan34ever> @nateryan Love it. Reminds me of the days of old
850079146348748800 2017-04-06 20:13:56 UTC <dalefan34ever> @TXMotorSpeedway Fake news! lol funny though
850078135500521472 2017-04-06 20:09:55 UTC <dalefan34ever> @PGA_JohnDaly @Ron_White Wait for it...but we didn't have the ability!
850077814153818112 2017-04-06 20:08:39 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN Everyone should RT this to @POTUS
850077617373839360 2017-04-06 20:07:52 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN @POTUS watch this video over and over
850047788674981888 2017-04-06 18:09:20 UTC <dalefan34ever> @FiredupBethy @JuddLegum So his shows are effectively direct to tape now?
850036123405434880 2017-04-06 17:22:59 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MartySmithESPN @bhofheimer_espn If I had to gage my knowledge and passion for golf I would be a hack but this article is outstanding
850033179301863424 2017-04-06 17:11:17 UTC <dalefan34ever> @thebulletin liquor bottles aren't the problem. I see WAY more cigarettes soda cans and don't get me started with the dog poop. Disgusting
850024183513743360 2017-04-06 16:35:32 UTC <dalefan34ever> @realDonaldTrump @KeithOlbermann Are they talking Trey Gowdy because he's been crooked since way back in his private practice! #slimebag

850007181386670083 2017-04-06 15:27:59 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MensHumor As long as there OL afterwards I'm good!
850005191780777986 2017-04-06 15:20:04 UTC <dalefan34ever> @HeyJasonSchultz Absolutely! Even if it takes each stage length down it would still be awesome
850002126948360192 2017-04-06 15:07:53 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NBCSports @NASCARonNBC @JeffBurton Same here I get tired of the glitz and glamour of the big tracks. I miss the let's drop the rag boys!
849769615198531584 2017-04-05 23:43:58 UTC <dalefan34ever> @Lizallison28 Good evening Mrs Alison. I voted for your wonderful husband and it's sure time he gets in the hall of fame! Have a good evening
849736663710314496 2017-04-05 21:33:02 UTC <dalefan34ever> @drjudymelinek @_TheRealDeath Wow so that was terrifying!

849401573969190914 2017-04-04 23:21:31 UTC <dalefan34ever> @GeorgeTakei Am I wrong or out of line when I say that I think we're headed toward a dictatorship?
849400809418829827 2017-04-04 23:18:28 UTC <dalefan34ever> @FiredupBethy  oh wait she's serious
849398297324290048 2017-04-04 23:08:29 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass So now cars go back to shop when will they get there? Obviously won't be used @TXMotorSpeedway
849367466367234049 2017-04-04 21:05:59 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MensHumor Isn't that Tigers place?
849366187918192640 2017-04-04 21:00:54 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MensHumor Never had a Fanta in my life. CHA CHING. Diet Pepsi is a different story. And whiskey
849309815486771200 2017-04-04 17:16:54 UTC <dalefan34ever> @FiredupBethy She's too stupid to know what he's talking about
849309069378809856 2017-04-04 17:13:56 UTC <dalefan34ever> @jeff_gluck @stevenspears96 Thank you got the help but I'm using an iPhone  Appreciate it though
849303847155765250 2017-04-04 16:53:11 UTC <dalefan34ever> @jeff_gluck Awesome game can I make a small recommendation for next year maybe a search box so players don't have to scroll to find their name
849302875826212864 2017-04-04 16:49:19 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass So now we're combining/confusing @NASCAR with fake choreographed "fights"?
849302349382340610 2017-04-04 16:47:14 UTC <dalefan34ever> @cnnbrk I just can't even.
849277273794424832 2017-04-04 15:07:35 UTC <dalefan34ever> @Rbroady35 Have you been to Sonoma? Great track I thought
849276694716235776 2017-04-04 15:05:17 UTC <dalefan34ever> @TalladegaSuperS @tomjensen100 That camper would probably fit in the trunk of the caddy #lotsaroom
849275407215902720 2017-04-04 15:00:10 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass I agree with @drmino88 @MartinsvilleSwy was the first really good race this year beginning to end
849272544729284612 2017-04-04 14:48:48 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass It sounds like that's what new or young fans want less Super speedway and more short track bang em up.
849272019984171008 2017-04-04 14:46:42 UTC <dalefan34ever> @KingJames I mean bruh? Wth is that come outta the hood man
849271021626564609 2017-04-04 14:42:44 UTC <dalefan34ever> @nateryan Was the dog named doggy mcdogface? Maybe the car was Indy mccarface!
849270537071190016 2017-04-04 14:40:49 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass I'm onboard with that. I don't quite understand the points system yet I LOVE the segment racing but imo the crash clock makes no sense
849263312554426368 2017-04-04 14:12:06 UTC <dalefan34ever> @Crazzyintheusa Snope! Sorry. Funny though
849093489988186113 2017-04-03 02:57:18 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NastyMindy Impeach this dictator. NOW #TrumpImpeachment
849040127183659008 2017-04-03 23:25:15 UTC <dalefan34ever> @nascarcasm I owe you an apology regarding the earlier tweet about the address on the check. My bad sorry
849023959806787584 2017-04-03 22:21:00 UTC <dalefan34ever> @TXMotorSpeedway @NASCAR_Xfinity @DaleJr @nascarcasm Not picking but maybe should have blocked the street address
849023509850341376 2017-04-03 22:19:13 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SteveLetarte Same here. Reminds me of Saturday night heat races.
849021813988368384 2017-04-03 22:12:29 UTC <dalefan34ever> @lmj022180 @sheltiemompat I bet he  himself!
849021631703928832 2017-04-03 22:11:45 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SteveLetarte you're quote of the best driver is a selfish driver was spot on. There is no sensitivity once they drop the rag
848919776931926016 2017-04-03 15:27:01 UTC <dalefan34ever> @AllWaltrip on yesterday's broadcast when you're mouth got away from you and you flubbed a word out of excitement, SUPER FUNNY
848334163124011008 2017-04-01 00:40:00 UTC <dalefan34ever> @StenhouseJr @DanicaPatrick @TXMotorSpeedway I fell for it. Big time. #aprilfoolsday
848316835489390593 2017-04-01 23:31:09 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NastyMindy @JohnFugelsang President Pussy Grabber. Hypocrite
848301004407808000 2017-04-01 22:28:14 UTC <dalefan34ever> @FiredupBethy @MalcolmNance Nances law? FSB? Thank you and sorry
848256944326320128 2017-04-01 19:33:10 UTC <dalefan34ever> @nascarcasm My sister got MARRIED on this day. Can you imagine the proposal
847832989077716993 2017-03-31 15:28:31 UTC <dalefan34ever> @DocPunchESPN Thank you Doc for all you do both in NASCAR and medicine!
847817436812288000 2017-03-31 14:26:43 UTC <dalefan34ever> @joeylogano @nascarcasm Hood slide!
847602227439058945 2017-03-30 00:11:33 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MartinsvilleSwy @AxaltaRacing Now is it secured when it's in? Tie down?
847601643872899072 2017-03-30 00:09:14 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NastyMindy this so called movement that Chump administration is calling itself just reminds me of the shit I took this morning
847596427488382976 2017-03-30 23:48:30 UTC <dalefan34ever> @FiredupBethy @pattonoswalt And every veteran has more badass in them on any given day
847544052794904577 2017-03-30 20:20:23 UTC <dalefan34ever> @_youhadonejob1 Probably why he drives a forklit
847543745306271744 2017-03-30 20:19:10 UTC <dalefan34ever> @nascarcasm Damn he went all the way up and got some! Hey how's the shoulder? Did they tell you how long you had? #praying
847465271811952643 2017-03-30 15:07:20 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SteveLetarte fall 14 was awesome
847462006198222848 2017-03-30 14:54:22 UTC <dalefan34ever> @nascarcasm you too buddy we'll get through this together #FistBump #ouchthathurt
847461274438909954 2017-03-30 14:51:27 UTC <dalefan34ever> @nascarcasm yea been there. Too many years of racing wheelchairs but surgery means no pushing my chair. #irony
847456882935463937 2017-03-30 14:34:00 UTC <dalefan34ever> @kaseykahne s'cuse me where's y'alls bathroom?
847093685946728448 2017-03-29 14:30:47 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NASCAR_WXMAN decent at best. Finishes have been good but for some reason mid race every week has been boring
846869428738318336 2017-03-28 23:39:40 UTC <dalefan34ever> @DavidCornDC I didn't know he was allowed to be all by himself
846863484348354560 2017-03-28 23:16:03 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN state run media
846827944437661696 2017-03-28 20:54:49 UTC <dalefan34ever> @JoyAnnReid @FiredupBethy @FoxNews he solely just blew the fair and balanced motto out the window and stepped on it
846826940275175424 2017-03-28 20:50:50 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NancyLeeGrahn @FiredupBethy fair and balanced? NO
846824401047764993 2017-03-28 20:40:45 UTC <dalefan34ever> @TheRickWilson take his security clearance... now!
846803969460518912 2017-03-28 19:19:33 UTC <dalefan34ever> @FOXSports @FOXSoccer insulting a ref? We've gone soft
846803386695532545 2017-03-28 19:17:14 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SethSharp35 wth? Photoshop or old game?
846801130373898240 2017-03-28 19:08:16 UTC <dalefan34ever> @oreillyfactor @KeithOlbermann ...begging to be put back on air
846799587071307776 2017-03-28 19:02:08 UTC <dalefan34ever> @mikejoy500 have either you or any colleagues sworn or come close to swearing on live TV? Always wondered this.
846796666267099136 2017-03-28 18:50:32 UTC <dalefan34ever> @JennaFryer yes! I mean NOTHING against the prerace commentators but post race is better imo
846748283137474560 2017-03-28 15:38:17 UTC <dalefan34ever> @GeorgeTakei nervous tick? Can't sit still because of guilty conscience?
846740113170219008 2017-03-28 15:05:49 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SethSharp35 gotta pay bills
846738702084718593 2017-03-28 15:00:12 UTC <dalefan34ever> @nascarcasm @DaleJr @WaffleHouse @JRMotorsports I was married and lived in the Midwest I have had @WaffleHouse I only miss @WaffleHouse
846563811909746688 2017-03-27 03:25:15 UTC <dalefan34ever> @HeyJasonSchultz I love the segments that are 60-80 laps. Keep distance add a segment?
846552620269416449 2017-03-27 02:40:47 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MartySmithESPN Chris Ledoux.
846510628642537472 2017-03-27 23:53:55 UTC <dalefan34ever> @keselowski they have to learn how to be under water. My dad was a pool man and taught me early
846509436248121344 2017-03-27 23:49:11 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SherryPollex how long have y'all been together? Cute couple no matter the situation
846458138630864897 2017-03-27 20:25:21 UTC <dalefan34ever> @GeorgeTakei you and I both
846457514396856320 2017-03-27 20:22:52 UTC <dalefan34ever> @GeorgeTakei we're all gonna die
846446775401525248 2017-03-27 19:40:12 UTC <dalefan34ever> Just found out my county is a #sanctuarycities go @DeschutesCounty !
846429270243082240 2017-03-27 18:30:38 UTC <dalefan34ever> @jeff_gluck I swear I heard a SAM I AM at the end.
846371180739121153 2017-03-27 14:39:48 UTC <dalefan34ever> @realDonaldTrump said during campaign he would drain the swamp. Would that make he and his cabinet swamp things? #justathought
846366150166405120 2017-03-27 14:19:49 UTC <dalefan34ever> @jeff_gluck so it wasn't just me who thought the number of commercials was way up.
846364584772616192 2017-03-27 14:13:36 UTC <dalefan34ever> @markmartin @AlanIvey84 where can I find more info on this car? It's beautiful
846351356969467904 2017-03-27 13:21:02 UTC <dalefan34ever> @ericgarland @FiredupBethy let alone violate it several times
846189699534245892 2017-03-26 02:38:40 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MartySmithESPN imo they're so useless. What say you?
846189334944366592 2017-03-26 02:37:13 UTC <dalefan34ever> @FiredupBethy I've wondered the same thing. He's like an inmate running the asylum. And he's gonna get us killed
846186455118471169 2017-03-26 02:25:46 UTC <dalefan34ever> @gopuck @MattYocum getcha an @AnkerOfficial charger we've had ours several years and still tickin'!
846185844583018496 2017-03-26 02:23:21 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MattYocum desperately! I love Fontana and the like but Bristol and martinsville features better racing no matter what series
846169172996374528 2017-03-26 01:17:06 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CoachHuggs @JennaFryer @FrankMartin_SC very true. Huge respect coach Huggs!'
846168010578546689 2017-03-26 01:12:29 UTC <dalefan34ever> @nascarcasm how bout @OregonMBB vs UNC. Give a gimp some love
846118230657720320 2017-03-26 21:54:40 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass I'll include @SherryPollex on this why so many VIPs? Roughly double that number of DRIVERS? #makesnosense
846064953027014656 2017-03-26 18:22:58 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SherryPollex YES
846062752334426112 2017-03-26 18:14:13 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SherryPollex kinda like the door marked employees only
846062383344709632 2017-03-26 18:12:45 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SherryPollex there should be some things off limits to fans. This is drivers' jobs
846062092352348161 2017-03-26 18:11:36 UTC <dalefan34ever> @jim_utter yep as a huge Jr fan every rule seems to be even worse if it impacts Jr
846060909415981056 2017-03-26 18:06:54 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass I'd almost rather cut a RF and get a new one 
846060634991079424 2017-03-26 18:05:49 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SherryPollex I completely agree The monster energy girls are useless. I thought the same of the sprint girls.
846058567815745536 2017-03-26 17:57:36 UTC <dalefan34ever> @tomjensen100 what's the front clip off of?

842175388818190336 2017-03-15 00:47:14 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass was there evidence of the alleged foot stomp?

842163922530525184 2017-03-15 00:01:40 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass so it's very much not 'by a rule' it's subjective

841485521700311040 2017-03-13 03:05:57 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SpotterBrett I've had that same argument with myself. I wish it would be like the 80s. They should all be suspended
841483182847418368 2017-03-13 02:56:39 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NastyMindy exactly
841481091785547776 2017-03-13 02:48:20 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NastyMindy yours too? Because I'm afraid to vacuum or use the garbage disposal!
841476856394080256 2017-03-13 02:31:31 UTC <dalefan34ever> @LVMotorSpeedway @NASCARONFOX at what point will driver actions that are detrimental outweigh the almighty dollar
841407457968578560 2017-03-13 21:55:45 UTC <dalefan34ever> @GeorgeTakei sorry to those who read this for the language but @POTUS fucking delusional
841403549816774656 2017-03-13 21:40:13 UTC <dalefan34ever> @nascarcasm remember harvicking? That was awesome
841403133322391553 2017-03-13 21:38:34 UTC <dalefan34ever> @_youhadonejob1 this kid should be president
841354288051834881 2017-03-13 18:24:28 UTC <dalefan34ever> @DavidW_Light yep kinda like Earnhardt Sr you either loved him or hated him there was no middle ground imo
841352176848912384 2017-03-13 18:16:05 UTC <dalefan34ever> @DavidW_Light I agree because he is so much the bad guy in NASCAR when he does or says anything he's vilified
841296709925793792 2017-03-13 14:35:40 UTC <dalefan34ever> @keselowski ok so four passes and good ten minutes if that over three hours? Boring
841294980769439746 2017-03-13 14:28:48 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NASCAR @SteveLetarte in this situation imo wreck was accidental unlike Kenseth Logano a few years ago. Suspend fine or take Busch points
841294333030547457 2017-03-13 14:26:14 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SethSharp35 how did @KyleBusch throw the punch  and then HE ends up bleeding?
841293180767100928 2017-03-13 14:21:39 UTC <dalefan34ever> @KyleBusch @DavidW_Light his comments about @GoodyearRacing giving him a tire that wouldn't hold air being an example
841292948314574849 2017-03-13 14:20:44 UTC <dalefan34ever> @KyleBusch @DavidW_Light but he'll never take credit for them and throws his crew under the bus constantly.
841156922409549824 2017-03-12 05:20:12 UTC <dalefan34ever> @estradawriting @dustinlong @danielmcfadin I hope it's not the last. @NASCAR needs it
841094374104551424 2017-03-12 01:11:40 UTC <dalefan34ever> @keselowski then why don't you dissuade your guys from getting into it? Seen the 2 crew fight many times
841090662971785217 2017-03-12 00:56:55 UTC <dalefan34ever> @PaigeKeselowski Mrs Keselowski you could turn down the b!tvh mode some @JamieLittleTV meant nothing by it
841068462311067648 2017-03-12 23:28:42 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass I thought crew chief role was to control crew? Didn't happen there
841067482358079488 2017-03-12 23:24:48 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SethSharp35 anger problems
841064525847654400 2017-03-12 23:13:03 UTC <dalefan34ever> @DavidW_Light  you too. Have a good Sunday
841062852609753088 2017-03-12 23:06:24 UTC <dalefan34ever> @DavidW_Light I completely agree. Gotta be able to show feelings both ways. '79 Daytona 500
841062351650480128 2017-03-12 23:04:25 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MonsterEnergy @HeyJasonSchultz I COMPLETELY agree. They have it to where you can't show feelings. Definitely not the old #NASCAR
841061910497882113 2017-03-12 23:02:40 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SethSharp35 I don't think there was any intentional squeezing but Joey got loose and into Kyle. Can't stand either but unintentional
841061486894047233 2017-03-12 23:00:59 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SethSharp35 @DavidW_Light brad could've moved joey could've lifted but nobody was obligated
841051610230865920 2017-03-12 22:21:44 UTC <dalefan34ever> @PRNlive @SteveLetarte don't get me wrong Stevie I LOVE NASCAR but is it a little more boring except the end of the segments and race end?
841035471308259328 2017-03-12 21:17:36 UTC <dalefan34ever> @JoeGibbsRacing @dustinlong @KyleBusch 
841032527607287808 2017-03-12 21:05:54 UTC <dalefan34ever> @KevinHarvick @tomjensen100 I understand the thought but the words were harsh. Will he be spanked?
841016744013586433 2017-03-12 20:03:11 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass @jeff_gluck who did the National Anthem?
841001722419986432 2017-03-12 19:03:30 UTC <dalefan34ever> @DaleJr @nationwide88 RT number three always an Earnhardt fan go Dale!

840778507936399360 2017-03-11 04:16:31 UTC <dalefan34ever> @JeffGordonWeb is @NHRA next because those are much louder than NASCAR
840759367150395392 2017-03-11 03:00:28 UTC <dalefan34ever> @RickAllenracing I agree!
840710509519294464 2017-03-11 23:46:19 UTC <dalefan34ever> @jeff_gluck wow. Pull him out
840709737482076160 2017-03-11 23:43:15 UTC <dalefan34ever> @TXMotorSpeedway yes but TMS is the real winner here!
840691936637853696 2017-03-11 22:32:31 UTC <dalefan34ever> @LauraMRutledge @KayleeHartung @MartySmithESPN @evangconard @infamous04 so many choices! 
840691465445638145 2017-03-11 22:30:39 UTC <dalefan34ever> @KayleeHartung @MartySmithESPN @infamous04 @evangconard Evan wins

840685304772096000 2017-03-11 22:06:10 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MikeCranston1 @jeff_gluck that's also the problem
840678332890939394 2017-03-11 21:38:28 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MartySmithESPN @evangconard @DanicaPatrick as Daisy. Or @DanielleTrotta
840676954143571969 2017-03-11 21:32:59 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN why would @POTUS want someone in that goes after corruption that's against his agenda
840672478435262464 2017-03-11 21:15:12 UTC <dalefan34ever> @GeorgeTakei nor is it normal to repeal health care with nothing in place already #offhisrocker
840657753290891264 2017-03-11 20:16:41 UTC <dalefan34ever> @PreetBharara I'm sorry @POTUS is such a madman Thank you for your service
840655437364002816 2017-03-11 20:07:29 UTC <dalefan34ever> @KarsynElledge3 could you tell any in 140 characters?
840654919820488705 2017-03-11 20:05:26 UTC <dalefan34ever> @keselowski @jeff_gluck hey hey hey umm Mr president can I get a selfie with you?
840650936468955137 2017-03-11 19:49:36 UTC <dalefan34ever> @DaleJr awesome pics Jr but be careful see blackmail in your future with that last one!
840649687614930944 2017-03-11 19:44:38 UTC <dalefan34ever> @erik_jones @jeff_gluck wow GREAT article Jeff. Ive liked Eric jones since he came onto the scene but even a bigger fan now
840617596613414912 2017-03-11 17:37:07 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN it's ok they can get cheap clothing at Walmart that is made by her people
840396029740515331 2017-03-10 02:56:41 UTC <dalefan34ever> @jim_utter will there be any other penalties than loss practice time
840331375374815235 2017-03-10 22:39:47 UTC <dalefan34ever> @nascarcasm @NASCAR_Wonka such a happy couple
840323392989421568 2017-03-10 22:08:03 UTC <dalefan34ever> @JennaFryer @mikejoy500 may be interested
840322829144879105 2017-03-10 22:05:49 UTC <dalefan34ever> @tomjensen100 I got RT number 4 go @KevinHarvick !
840229978377666560 2017-03-10 15:56:52 UTC <dalefan34ever> @AwardsDarwin @ceedawn10 Kevin I'm with you on that one. Not this one though it hurts
840228775170211840 2017-03-10 15:52:05 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SteveLetarte it reminds me of heat races. Love it!
840228101376294912 2017-03-10 15:49:24 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN John, define obfuscate. Oh wait you can't.
840219955853312000 2017-03-10 15:17:02 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN Americas First Lady aka 2000 playboy playmate
840031288090284032 2017-03-09 02:47:20 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN birds of a feather collude together
840029868217659395 2017-03-09 02:41:42 UTC <dalefan34ever> @AAN so repealing the ACA will magically fix everything and replacing it with a plan that works ONLY if you are wealthy rich and employed. 
840017005688238080 2017-03-09 01:50:35 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NASCARONFOX I couldn't care less.
839950115427139584 2017-03-09 21:24:47 UTC <dalefan34ever> @nascarcasm hopefully that cane across as humorous because it was certainly meant that way. Good luck on the rotator cuff thing those suck
839949551314227200 2017-03-09 21:22:33 UTC <dalefan34ever> @nascarcasm yep totally recovered
839948265093152768 2017-03-09 21:17:26 UTC <dalefan34ever> @nascarcasm i just had brain surgery you go 
839944823079493632 2017-03-09 21:03:45 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MensHumor I'd fall on the grass and end up in the river. Not sure how but I would
839908297008275456 2017-03-09 18:38:37 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MensHumor shut twitter down this wins!
839856027533127680 2017-03-09 15:10:55 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MensHumor nothing to see here just your regular dog and pony show
839852975635890176 2017-03-09 14:58:47 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SethSharp35 I hear that! Super speedways are great racing but nothing beats Saturday night beating and banging
839850886864105472 2017-03-09 14:50:29 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SethSharp35 it's time Davey Allison is in!
839700565793759232 2017-03-08 04:53:10 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MensHumor there's only two good types of music. Country and western.
839654177873678337 2017-03-08 01:48:50 UTC <dalefan34ever> @LVMotorSpeedway @TeamHendrick in pics 7&8 what are the metal plates the cars are sitting on?
839481711612157953 2017-03-08 14:23:31 UTC <dalefan34ever> @GeorgeTakei he can't even put his own unsecured device down now! Imagine we have a @POTUS with a smart phone when he isn't.
839480475513053185 2017-03-08 14:18:36 UTC <dalefan34ever> @garthbrooks @liamgk wow this probably can get enough RT thank you for your service sir
839322635670429697 2017-03-07 03:51:24 UTC <dalefan34ever> @GeorgeTakei he does *trust him* 
839249268552523776 2017-03-07 22:59:52 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SpotterBrett forget chills man, first time by at my first race brought me tears
839202755696713728 2017-03-07 19:55:03 UTC <dalefan34ever> @jeff_gluck @Tenayaway hey oh wait it's loud HOW ARE NANCY AND THE BABY!! WHAT?!
839202460895866880 2017-03-07 19:53:52 UTC <dalefan34ever> @RaceSonoma @MartinsvilleSwy @BMSupdates @bobpockrass @JamesAGentry then don't go 
839202284714110976 2017-03-07 19:53:10 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN if Chump has "proof" that President Obama wire tapped him, prove it no need to use congress
839195437814833153 2017-03-07 19:25:58 UTC <dalefan34ever> @animalfndlv @JamieLittleTV Mike Vick put an ugly probably non reversible tag on Pits. Sad.
839181817185906688 2017-03-07 18:31:51 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass I can understand @BMSupdates and @MartinsvilleSwy but @RaceSonoma isn't loud
839154029728968705 2017-03-07 16:41:26 UTC <dalefan34ever> @AllWaltrip never thought of that. Simply moving it would decrease noise and still be loud without any major change to the cars
839153618234163200 2017-03-07 16:39:47 UTC <dalefan34ever> @Chris_Buescher @barstoolsports @TXMotorSpeedway wooow that'd make a great 'over pool table light'
839150982386724864 2017-03-07 16:29:19 UTC <dalefan34ever> @kristavoda thanks for this Krista. It's hard to have a good outlook past all the craziness

839140989017022464 2017-03-07 15:49:36 UTC <dalefan34ever> @mikejoy500 Mike I get your point but if that fifty lap car down car needs one point to advance in playoffs yes
839138453707096064 2017-03-07 15:39:32 UTC <dalefan34ever> @AllWaltrip I wondered the same thing I thought last years racing was pretty good
838867100642881536 2017-03-06 21:41:16 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN I just can't even
838857487063244801 2017-03-06 21:03:04 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN did trump had myself write this?

838777586972938240 2017-03-06 15:45:35 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NASFACTS @jeff_gluck can't win more races than there is
838558886219001856 2017-03-05 01:16:32 UTC <dalefan34ever> @amsupdates @HeyJasonSchultz I totally agree this years raceways kind of a snore except the last 30 laps
838499587681722368 2017-03-05 21:20:54 UTC <dalefan34ever> @Hendrick88Team tough day for the 88 camp but they'll persevere
838498491265511424 2017-03-05 21:16:33 UTC <dalefan34ever> @austindillon3 @chaseelliott @JerryBonkowski it's gonna be hard to go against the 4
838479148850958339 2017-03-05 19:59:41 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SethSharp35 I agree they just took a whatever approach at it
838464448146767873 2017-03-05 19:01:17 UTC <dalefan34ever> @tomjensen100 that's two words gave you been drinking already not that I would blame you

835983833451241472 2017-02-26 22:44:12 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SethSharp35 I agree @NASCAR is way to secretive with that and the rule book

829837691680219138 2017-02-09 23:41:37 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN republicans are taking the country back to how it was run 200+ years ago

829768460137701376 2017-02-09 19:06:31 UTC <dalefan34ever> @espn @bobpockrass @johnnynuke I agree with John. My mindset is oh I gotta be careful if I damage it we're done
829762217465614337 2017-02-09 18:41:43 UTC <dalefan34ever> @JimmieJohnson @McBainSam TROLLED. BOOM
829508966862319616 2017-02-08 01:55:23 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass @SteveLetarte @nateryan So if ballast comes out of car as happened in the past and goes through radiator, the car is out?
829368807151935489 2017-02-08 16:38:27 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NASCAR @tomjensen100 good point Tom

829362322095222784 2017-02-08 16:12:41 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SteveLetarte @DGodfatherMoody @nateryan what is fuel window at @DISupdates? I thought it was 52-55 laps?
829360852574679045 2017-02-08 16:06:50 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NASCAR @tomjensen100 I unholy I disagree. I've seen damaged cars win races. I get if damage is heavy yes but 5 minutes is too short.
829358478841876480 2017-02-08 15:57:24 UTC <dalefan34ever> @JeffGordonWeb PLEASE take it for a 'test drive' with dealer employee 
829355158215667712 2017-02-08 15:44:13 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NASCAR might as well cut @BMSupdates and @MartinsvilleSwy races by half. No one will be left.
829351298587729920 2017-02-08 15:28:52 UTC <dalefan34ever> @TXMotorSpeedway this is HORRIBLE? Bristol won't have any cars left!
829048428348911616 2017-02-07 19:25:22 UTC <dalefan34ever> @BonhamChrysler2 listen to the car alarm 
828990563865161728 2017-02-07 15:35:26 UTC <dalefan34ever> @tomjensen100 didn't trump say same thing during election?  #kidding
828740242530197507 2017-02-06 23:00:45 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN best commercial yesterday. We're ALL immigrants except Native Americans. We ALL immigrated
828673116641521664 2017-02-06 18:34:01 UTC <dalefan34ever> @JeffGordonWeb @ivandebosch 
828647971675791360 2017-02-06 16:54:06 UTC <dalefan34ever> @mikejoy500 the two @DaleJr 500's being that low befuddled me. Seniors did too.
828647059322400770 2017-02-06 16:50:29 UTC <dalefan34ever> @FOXSports are you just going to leave it live that? Nothing about how IT WAS FOUND and that a TEAM EQUIPMENT MANAGER moved it? Shame.
828462927669628928 2017-02-05 04:38:48 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NASCAR_WXMAN biggest choke was either Alabama or whoever lost to the cubs

828028741410398208 2017-02-04 23:53:30 UTC <dalefan34ever> @SInow albeit a very dark subject matter this was a good article. I'd have taken the entire coaching staff the AD and program.
828004109303181312 2017-02-04 22:15:37 UTC <dalefan34ever> @JustinMarksDG makes sense but with expenses going up it's hard to spend that $$
827988993744646145 2017-02-04 21:15:34 UTC <dalefan34ever> @FoxNews @mcuban the world needs more @ShepNewsTeam!
827621106265624576 2017-02-03 20:53:42 UTC <dalefan34ever> @CNN because Canada's prime minister condemned Trumps many many bad ideas

827191588069601280 2017-02-02 16:26:57 UTC <dalefan34ever> @TXMotorSpeedway to me the one color represents one people unity not segregation or discrimination

826814188752236544 2017-02-01 15:27:18 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NASCAR are the practices on February 17th televised?
826478790779957250 2017-01-31 17:14:33 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass some sort of gif would be helpful to show tracks proposed changes and S/F line area

825816596434149377 2017-01-29 21:23:14 UTC <dalefan34ever> @tomjensen100 just curious does that hurt? It looks horribly uncomfortable
825778285892169728 2017-01-29 18:51:00 UTC <dalefan34ever> @DanielleTrotta fly swatter for the people around me who annoy me

825530629982793728 2017-01-28 02:26:54 UTC <dalefan34ever> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @sheltiemompat @StephenKing it's racism. Clear and simple.
825504305725599744 2017-01-28 00:42:18 UTC <dalefan34ever> @elonmusk if he's going against one group or entire countries, not just a few, that is the definition of racist.
825485019577593856 2017-01-28 23:25:40 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MensHumor otter pops
825430206491942912 2017-01-28 19:47:51 UTC <dalefan34ever> @NASCARMemories one of my favorite NASCAR driver pictures ever
825147656531898368 2017-01-27 01:05:06 UTC <dalefan34ever> @cnnbrk because that's not biased. "I'm going to be a everyone's president. Bullshit. Excuse me #alternativefacts
825022879158800384 2017-01-27 16:49:17 UTC <dalefan34ever> @nascarcasm @colepearn maybe they'll catch him in a foot race with @MartinTruex_Jr to the porta potties!

824778650398580736 2017-01-26 00:38:48 UTC <dalefan34ever> @DaleJr @RockyD821 looks like a Bristol car now.
824707322249244672 2017-01-26 19:55:22 UTC <dalefan34ever> @gumby61184 @stu11orlando could HAVE

824688251701121024 2017-01-26 18:39:35 UTC <dalefan34ever> @Kyle_Leeuw @mikejoy500 @wvwllw absolutely. Jimmie Johnson has. Why not Sr.? And I'm a HUGE Sr fan
824687971068620800 2017-01-26 18:38:28 UTC <dalefan34ever> @Kyle_Leeuw @mikejoy500 @wvwllw I agree with that sort of. If the cars are very different the racing isn't as good.
824687131385749504 2017-01-26 18:35:08 UTC <dalefan34ever> @wvwllw @mikejoy500 @Kyle_Leeuw and the world continues to evolve. Evidently you were left behind.
824685698678611969 2017-01-26 18:29:27 UTC <dalefan34ever> @mikejoy500 @Kyle_Leeuw @wvwllw because I when the last race rolls around, in the old format, and the leader has a 381 point lead 
824360879953104896 2017-01-25 20:58:44 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass I thought charters were gone altogether with the new system?
824024715463311360 2017-01-24 22:42:56 UTC <dalefan34ever> @DaleJr @ATLcoxbaby keep it. It's a beautiful picture
823913261233909761 2017-01-24 15:20:03 UTC <dalefan34ever> @DaleJr @sambassartist @AxaltaRacing Very easy to see! Across track at Dega maybe through pagoda @IMS! Beautiful though
823744855301984256 2017-01-23 04:10:52 UTC <dalefan34ever> @RickAllenracing Me thinks this years points system will be revamped in the '18 offseason. Too confusing
823686381041922050 2017-01-23 00:18:31 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass so does 'segments' mean something akin to the caution clock or quarters in football?
823685278019690496 2017-01-23 00:14:08 UTC <dalefan34ever> @MartySmithESPN I like chase. It makes NASCAR its own sport. But please blend into the background
823684662090289152 2017-01-23 00:11:41 UTC <dalefan34ever> @TXMotorSpeedway not sure I understand it yet. I'll read itvs few more times. What constitutes a 'segment'?
823671652764372992 2017-01-23 23:19:59 UTC <dalefan34ever> @bobpockrass of course it is. Blend into every other sport don't stand out! Ugh
823570408406294528 2017-01-23 16:37:41 UTC <dalefan34ever> @jaybusbee @keselowski @jeff_gluck greatest of luck Jeff!

823381164807204864 2017-01-22 04:05:42 UTC <dalefan34ever> @DaleJr @TXMotorSpeedway I'd be up for that!  @eddiegossage and TMS always put on a great event!

821799836731064321 2017-01-18 19:22:04 UTC <dalefan34ever> @cnnbrk @Sekhmara yes. That's got to be awfully uncomfortable
821798281051127808 2017-01-18 19:15:53 UTC <dalefan34ever> @cnnbrk sounds like he's been intubated. Prayers to him.
