785290311778111489 2016-10-09 01:26:14 UTC <MastersTower> Trump says he'd assign special prosecutor on Hillary as prez. He compares her to "devil." Audience goes wild. #trump #Debates2016 #debates

785289065331617792 2016-10-09 01:21:17 UTC <MastersTower> Trump attacked Clinton on her, her husband's actions. Hillary avoids the issue.
785288400320462848 2016-10-09 01:18:39 UTC <MastersTower> The moderators are pushing the #trumpvideo. Trump continues to call it "locker room" talk, says it was "words" vs. Clinton's actions

785286058103672833 2016-10-09 01:09:20 UTC <MastersTower> A question on role models--Hillary cites diversity, togetherness, Trump seems to be avoiding and dwelling on unrelated talking points.

783497889699995648 2016-10-04 02:43:48 UTC <MastersTower> What a debate! #VPDebate
783497815498625025 2016-10-04 02:43:30 UTC <MastersTower> A final poll--who won? #VPDebate #Kaine #Pence #KaineVsPence #kainewon #pencewins
783497445602918400 2016-10-04 02:42:02 UTC <MastersTower> In light of what @PolitiFact found, perhaps the best #VPDebateActionMovie would be "True Lies"
783496756256448512 2016-10-04 02:39:18 UTC <MastersTower> Awkward moments abounded in this #VPDebate . I especially liked when Kaine interrupted Pence to thank the moderator.
783496591751741442 2016-10-04 02:38:38 UTC <MastersTower> I've never seen this before--Kaine and Pence's families are having some sort of circle discussion. Good day for bipartisan understanding.
783496165505589253 2016-10-04 02:36:57 UTC <MastersTower> The #VPDebate has concluded. Lively but respectful, especially in light of this year's uncivil politics. Both knew their stuff.
783495471050461184 2016-10-04 02:34:11 UTC <MastersTower> #VPDebate #Pence #Kaine #KaineVsPence @timkaine talking about unity. He's very popular with D.C. Republicans: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/republicans-congress-tim-kaine-227952
783494940848484353 2016-10-04 02:32:05 UTC <MastersTower> #VPDebate wow--a sincere, calm discussion of abortion rights and being Christian in 2016
783494099097780224 2016-10-04 02:28:44 UTC <MastersTower> Kaine is coming into his own right now--doing better than earlier, more austere & serious #VPDebate
783493911708856320 2016-10-04 02:27:59 UTC <MastersTower> Kaine's position is more popular with voters, according to Gallup:http://www.gallup.com/poll/183434/americans-choose-pro-choice-first-time-seven-years.aspx
783493149687709697 2016-10-04 02:24:58 UTC <MastersTower> Abortion could be a minefield for Kaine:http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/tim-kaine-abortion-predicament-225053
783492813442912256 2016-10-04 02:23:37 UTC <MastersTower> #VPDebate We now turn to social issues. Pence is seen as a Christian conservative in the George W. Bush mold, Kaine as a moderate liberal.
783492581112111105 2016-10-04 02:22:42 UTC <MastersTower> #VPDebate #Pence #Kaine #KaineVsPence Who's winning the VP debate right now?
783492242652663808 2016-10-04 02:21:21 UTC <MastersTower> "I would remind you--this is about North Korea." The mod is less stringent on keeping on topic than @LesterHoltNBC was
783490945698435072 2016-10-04 02:16:12 UTC <MastersTower> They're not always important, but VP debates can make a big difference sometimes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator,_you%27re_no_Jack_Kennedy
783489803123851264 2016-10-04 02:11:40 UTC <MastersTower> #VPDebate Kaine is trying to beat Pence on Russia, taxes, or nuclear proliferation, but he can't stick to one of them and Pence is avoiding
783489250511781888 2016-10-04 02:09:28 UTC <MastersTower> Russia 65% unfavorable amongst Americans (http://www.gallup.com/poll/1642/russia.aspx)--that's why both are trying to pin Putin to the other #VPDebate
783488616202928128 2016-10-04 02:06:57 UTC <MastersTower> Kaine is trying to get under Pence's skin, but Pence keeps on retreating to different topics #VPDebate
783487888428236801 2016-10-04 02:04:03 UTC <MastersTower> At #VPDebate @timkaine and @mike_pence have agreed on community policing and humanitarian safe zone in #Syria.
783487376375119872 2016-10-04 02:02:01 UTC <MastersTower> #VPDebate In 2012, after @BarackObama's panned 1st debate, @JoeBiden allayed allies' fears through the VP debate. Is Pence pulling a Biden?
783486819878989826 2016-10-04 01:59:48 UTC <MastersTower> #VPDebate Pence is trying to turn the Russia albatross on Clinton and Kaine--will it work?
783485965444718592 2016-10-04 01:56:25 UTC <MastersTower> Kaine had a pretty weak first 30 minutes, but he's certainly running better now. Pushing Pence hard on @realDonaldTrump's statements
783485490532081664 2016-10-04 01:54:32 UTC <MastersTower> Who holds the more popular position on refugees? According to Gallup, Pence does: http://www.gallup.com/poll/186866/americans-again-opposed-taking-refugees.aspx #VPDebate
783485255806222337 2016-10-04 01:53:36 UTC <MastersTower> #VPDebate Pence seems to be getting his points across better. Pence is talking slower; Kaine is speeding through
783484451275862020 2016-10-04 01:50:24 UTC <MastersTower> #VPDebate Kaine and Pence are certainly having a far more cordial debate than that of Trump & Clinton.
783483614390521856 2016-10-04 01:47:04 UTC <MastersTower> #VPDebate Quijado (the mod) isn't fact-checking like Lester Holt was. Certainly resulted in a different debate.
783482868341346304 2016-10-04 01:44:06 UTC <MastersTower> #VPDebate @mike_pence is incorrect about ICE's "endorsement." ICE is a gov agency; it can't endorse candidates. The union endorsed Trump.
783482583157968896 2016-10-04 01:42:58 UTC <MastersTower> Who's winning?
783482418867081216 2016-10-04 01:42:19 UTC <MastersTower> #VPDebate Pence is having a better night than @realDonaldTrump was at the first debate. But VP debates rarely make too much of a difference.
783481675799994368 2016-10-04 01:39:22 UTC <MastersTower> #VPDebate Pence is being extremely restrained compared to @realDonaldTrump on how he describes a Trump presidency immigration policy.
783481428608688128 2016-10-04 01:38:23 UTC <MastersTower> #VPDebate Kaine brings up Trump's sordid racial history in race/justice conversation. "Insult-driven" comes up again.
783480849996152833 2016-10-04 01:36:05 UTC <MastersTower> #VPDebate Kaine & Pence came to an area of agreement w/ community policing earlier. Hard to imagine this would happen with Trump & Clinton.
