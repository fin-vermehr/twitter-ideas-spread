932788304650661888 2017-11-20 01:50:36 UTC <megnanimous42> @BostonGlobe @LibertyDoctrine I'm not going to say I'm still waiting on your sources, because I've long since given up on believing that you have any to provide.
932786574558769152 2017-11-20 01:43:44 UTC <megnanimous42> @BostonGlobe @LibertyDoctrine You can't have given me any truth without sources . And the data proved my point - definitely didn't prove me wrong. Ah well, you can lead a horse to data-based facts, but you can't make it understand how to read graphs or comprehend logic
932785300371275776 2017-11-20 01:38:40 UTC <megnanimous42> @BostonGlobe @LibertyDoctrine Lol do you understand how data works? 2016 isn't old data (2014 isn't either, but 2016 certainly isn't). And I don't place any stock in your opinion, which you've backed up with no sources of any type, let alone with data. I didn't give you my opinion; I gave you facts.
932784382024257537 2017-11-20 01:35:01 UTC <megnanimous42> @BostonGlobe @LibertyDoctrine Like I said, you can keep your confirmation bias; I prefer data.
932769939580182528 2017-11-20 00:37:38 UTC <megnanimous42> @BostonGlobe @LibertyDoctrine And regardless of the dates (given that Census data comes every decade, 1-3 years is quite valid), the data clearly proves my original point that there are plenty of Christians who lean Democrat, so the categories aren't mutually exclusive.
932769240914059266 2017-11-20 00:34:51 UTC <megnanimous42> @BostonGlobe @LibertyDoctrine No, the Pew one is from 2014, as I said, and the PRRI one is from 2016, as I said. They both say the dates right in those footnotes that you think I didn't read.
932737915758825477 2017-11-20 22:30:23 UTC <megnanimous42> @Jossfjh @tutticontenti Koreans don't kill dogs for the fun of it; they eat the dogs. It's a dying practice because most young Koreans don't want to continue it, and it has nothing to do with whether SK should host the Olympics.
932734353699999744 2017-11-20 22:16:13 UTC <megnanimous42> @BostonGlobe @LibertyDoctrine Ok, here's data from PPRI from 2016. It's not broken down as much by denomination as the Pew data, and it differentiates between independent and "other," but it basically shows similar data.pic.twitter.com/iZYSx3VnLx

932698244488089601 2017-11-20 19:52:44 UTC <megnanimous42> @BostonGlobe @LibertyDoctrine Hey, if you want to let your confirmation bias rule your brain, I can't stop you. But I'm not going to ignore the data that shows that many adherents of mainline and historically black churches lean Democrat, while most evangelicals lean Republican - as of a 2014 Pew survey.
932696083523866624 2017-11-20 19:44:09 UTC <megnanimous42> @BostonGlobe @LibertyDoctrine Nice attempt to pull a "projection" argument, but no. Your post juxtaposed Christians and Democrats as if there was no overlap between those groups. I'm not sorry for reminding you that there are Christian Democrats. I, personally, am not one of them (I fall into neither group).
932564439013916673 2017-11-20 11:01:03 UTC <megnanimous42> @BostonGlobe Thank goodness POTUS doesn't routinely act like an elementary school bully...oh wait.

931877832514588674 2017-11-18 13:32:43 UTC <megnanimous42> @BostonGlobe @Hasana45160079 The headline doesn't tell the whole story: Douglas RT'd Aly Raisman's tweet about being sexually abused by the team doctor and added her comments about dressing modestly.
