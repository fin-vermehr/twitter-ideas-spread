951542647277137922 2018-01-11 19:53:40 UTC <Stephlee77> @spntrashftw I liked Last Jedi despite some problems.I just wish they could have given the Princess theheroic death she deserves. It wasnt handled here
951540889830207491 2018-01-11 19:46:41 UTC <Stephlee77> @spntrashftw She was definitely MY Princess!
951540707751288834 2018-01-11 19:45:58 UTC <Stephlee77> @spntrashftw Me too. I still cry almost every time I see her. Last Jedi was tough for me. I literally cried when she was on. When credits rolled I bawledpic.twitter.com/k5ugi6ZbJz

951452937599029248 2018-01-11 13:57:12 UTC <Stephlee77> @spntrashftw Im pretty sure I was the same age when I saw it! Han Solo is STILL my crush and Princess Leia my ultimate hero. I have loved Carrie since!

950364344038158336 2018-01-08 13:51:31 UTC <Stephlee77> @JDMorgan God lord.   Both of you are adorable!!
950206516589678592 2018-01-07 03:24:22 UTC <Stephlee77> @jumblejim You are so awesome!!
950199828885200896 2018-01-07 02:57:47 UTC <Stephlee77> @ajbends But good luck with the new direction.  I hope you are all happy with the decision and can make it work.
950199619170045952 2018-01-07 02:56:57 UTC <Stephlee77> @ajbends I honestly hope the best for all of you. Just dont think it will be the same. & reading Michaels statement made it feel like he was booted
950199066385965056 2018-01-07 02:54:45 UTC <Stephlee77> @ajbends Im not trying to be mean or dis you in any way. My daughters & I have been fans for a long time. Just thought ur comment was a little harsh
950197189984313345 2018-01-07 02:47:18 UTC <Stephlee77> @ajbends And dont get pissy when fans choose to NOT listen to the new sound or like the direction. Issues WAS a collective of voices. Now 1 short.
950196791189954562 2018-01-07 02:45:43 UTC <Stephlee77> @ajbends My point is that with social media today & bands that do multiple, for profit, meet & greets fans have the idea they r part of the family
950194624177590272 2018-01-07 02:37:06 UTC <Stephlee77> @ajbends No artists shouldnt at all sell out.  But they should understand when the fans are upset and not think they are entitled.
950157039459864576 2018-01-07 00:07:45 UTC <Stephlee77> Somebody PLEASE in Texas.  Help this poor dog.  My heart is breakinghttps://twitter.com/ellenhopkinslit/status/950142216554491904
950076674502209536 2018-01-07 18:48:25 UTC <Stephlee77> Oh @LindseyGrahamSC. What happened to you? Damn you SOLD OUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR MONEY. SHAME on you!!https://twitter.com/funder/status/949681248011726848
950071348893765635 2018-01-07 18:27:15 UTC <Stephlee77> @ajbends If it wasnt for fans there would be no BANDS. The bands are the ones that put themselves on social media. How are fans supposed to react?
950070965656064002 2018-01-07 18:25:44 UTC <Stephlee77> @ajbends My personal opinion is fans spend money and heart on bands. They have a right to express opinions & feel betrayed.
950068863743479808 2018-01-07 18:17:23 UTC <Stephlee77> This is the main reason @SpeakerRyan MUST GO! He doesnt give two shits about America. He only cares about what is going into HIS pocket!https://twitter.com/ironstache/status/949398568141549568

944682876271984640 2017-12-23 21:35:23 UTC <Stephlee77> Sorry but @SenBobCorker is such a fraud. Worse than Trump by making the public think he was a stand up guy only to be worse than any of themhttps://twitter.com/akarmutt/status/944198570286120960
944682408879812611 2017-12-23 21:33:32 UTC <Stephlee77> I'd like to think that @RandPaul wasn't such a dick, and actually had the balls to stand up to Donald Trump. But that isn't happening.https://twitter.com/goldengateblond/status/944441992238350336
944214662266179586 2017-12-22 14:34:52 UTC <Stephlee77> @marchbooks I have never in my life seen such blatant hypocrisy! It's disgusting and I want every single one of them to lose their next election

943775971978641408 2017-12-21 09:31:40 UTC <Stephlee77> @dbongino @nyinvesting @RepubBillCan IF you can't see that, especially how much it will make for our "president" then YOU are definitely the problem. Open those blind eyes & SEE
943775462890799104 2017-12-21 09:29:39 UTC <Stephlee77> @dbongino @nyinvesting @RepubBillCan The only ones getting voted out are the "conservatives" that the #CorkerKickback is making richer! A disgusting blatant money-grab!

921239607206744065 2017-10-19 05:00:12 UTC <Stephlee77> @Proud_Mother85 You should definitely check it out. Its nice. Chicago is all kinds of busy. I love it but it's just not the place to raise kids for sure
921232168096899073 2017-10-19 04:30:39 UTC <Stephlee77> @Proud_Mother85 Davenport would definitely be nice.  It's a pretty town.  I don't know much about Cincinnati. Peoria is boring as all hell!
921231569032962049 2017-10-19 04:28:16 UTC <Stephlee77> @Proud_Mother85 The quad cities are about an hour maybe an hour 1/2 from here.  It's a nice town.
921230327854481408 2017-10-19 04:23:20 UTC <Stephlee77> @Proud_Mother85 I live in Peoria, Ill.  Chicago is def the closest but Nashville isn't too far and might actually be cheaper! I just want to go!!
921229328221798401 2017-10-19 04:19:22 UTC <Stephlee77> @Proud_Mother85 Where do you live?
921225670058942464 2017-10-19 04:04:49 UTC <Stephlee77> @Proud_Mother85 I'm saving a little bit of money from each week's checks
921225530904420353 2017-10-19 04:04:16 UTC <Stephlee77> @Proud_Mother85 I want to.  So bad.  It would have to be Chicago.  Or Nashville.   Those are the closest to me
921225369541156864 2017-10-19 04:03:38 UTC <Stephlee77> @MarkRPellegrino Signed!!!
921222533738782720 2017-10-19 03:52:22 UTC <Stephlee77> @Proud_Mother85 Sister I am right there with you. I have to pay my own way.  After everything else. I haven't been able to afford one. Hoping next year.
921221416535461889 2017-10-19 03:47:55 UTC <Stephlee77> @Proud_Mother85 Unless mommy and daddy are buying
921221329830912000 2017-10-19 03:47:35 UTC <Stephlee77> @Proud_Mother85 You can be a true fan and just not have the money.  Like me. I have actual responsibilities! I have no idea how a person can go to so many!
921217870213853184 2017-10-19 03:33:50 UTC <Stephlee77> @Proud_Mother85 My parents money on cons but some of us have actual real life responsibilities!!
921217697874051072 2017-10-19 03:33:09 UTC <Stephlee77> @Proud_Mother85 Does going to all the cons make you more special than the rest of us?  Sorry I work hard to pay for mortgage/kids. Would love to drop all
921217472983977984 2017-10-19 03:32:15 UTC <Stephlee77> @Proud_Mother85 Honestly I don't even know how this started! But I do know, as I've said, certain people feel an entitlement and I wish I knew why.
921215799800614912 2017-10-19 03:25:36 UTC <Stephlee77> @Proud_Mother85 Get over yourselves.  You are not more important than anyone else here. And that to me is the kicker. They feel entitlement.
921215567444537345 2017-10-19 03:24:41 UTC <Stephlee77> @Proud_Mother85 Agreed. I love this fandom. I respect most of the people here. This little tirade just showed me who is worth friending and who is not
921214189452001280 2017-10-19 03:19:12 UTC <Stephlee77> @RVAwonk @MalcolmNance Kelly lies as much as trump does so how is that even an argument.
921213830784528384 2017-10-19 03:17:47 UTC <Stephlee77> @Proud_Mother85 With each other that shows the ra character in a relationship/friendship/family!  You were spot on!
921213673074561024 2017-10-19 03:17:09 UTC <Stephlee77> @Proud_Mother85 I absolutely agree.  I find it incredibly hypocritical of people that Tout the "SPN Family" love then so this crap. It's how you disagree
921192029199233026 2017-10-19 01:51:09 UTC <Stephlee77> @Sunyasue Damn straight! Trump is bad enough.  This guy is worse & I can't believe I'm saying that. He MUST BE DEFEATED!Glad I'm not the only 2 see it
921185983856508930 2017-10-19 01:27:08 UTC <Stephlee77> @MarkRPellegrino @ArchangelCas457 See?  Hypocrites. That makes me crazy!

921169802797780994 2017-10-19 00:22:50 UTC <Stephlee77> @MarkRPellegrino @ArchangelCas457 Am I wrong? There will always be disagreements between friends/fam. Human nature but the way you deal with it sets you apart. #OnlyLove
921169049068847104 2017-10-19 00:19:50 UTC <Stephlee77> @MarkRPellegrino @ArchangelCas457 I mean.....am I wrong? There are always going to be disagreements amongst friends/fam but it's how you deal with it that counts. #OnlyLove

904250717300559872 2017-09-03 07:52:25 UTC <Stephlee77> @TheNew76 Since the people from Hurricane Sandy are STILL awaiting the money trump pledged, it is not wrong of the American people to be leary of him!

891712598252695553 2017-07-30 17:30:25 UTC <Stephlee77> @realDonaldTrump @ColumbiaBugle John McCain is a TRUE AMERICAN HERO. He fought for your right to question him. And YOUR freedom.  Show him the respect he deserves!

870710007775416320 2017-06-02 18:33:37 UTC <Stephlee77> I would move to Wisconsin just to vote against this POS!  When he is sitting home in his boxers after losing in 2018 and wonders why......https://twitter.com/stinkshovel/status/870611460606509057
870709351148802049 2017-06-02 18:31:00 UTC <Stephlee77> @POTUS @SpeakerRyan You are both weak simple little men. Real men like Justin Trudeau and Marcon know the truth. Marcon is the MAN.  and that handshake!   fire
870708962743668736 2017-06-02 18:29:28 UTC <Stephlee77> @SpeakerRyan This is utter bullshit. Glad to know the people Of this country can count on you....to stab them all in the back for the sake of the rich!
870518405480169473 2017-06-01 05:52:15 UTC <Stephlee77> @adamfergus @DavidHaydnJones @little_pop_work Hmmmmmm. Give me that dodgy Ketch any day! He would look sitting on my shelf!  
870483207610933248 2017-06-01 03:32:24 UTC <Stephlee77> @Shoshannah7 FYI.  You ARE a firework!! 
870482902605279233 2017-06-01 03:31:11 UTC <Stephlee77> @WinchesterBros @eldwenne I will keep you bookmarked. I can buy myself something maybe later in the year!  It's all beautiful
870482765745197056 2017-06-01 03:30:38 UTC <Stephlee77> @WinchesterBros @eldwenne I want something SO bad.  But unfortunate I have to pay my mortgage and my utilities this month.  Single motherhood is a bitch!
870475461553528832 2017-06-01 03:01:37 UTC <Stephlee77> @whatsheread Absolutely agreed. I have never felt such intense hatred for a person in my life. I can't even.
870475185333428225 2017-06-01 03:00:31 UTC <Stephlee77> @Fizzhogg Ewwwwwww
870475009285914624 2017-06-01 02:59:49 UTC <Stephlee77> @WaywardDaughtrs @curtisisbooger Congrats!!

870474298254819329 2017-06-01 02:56:59 UTC <Stephlee77> @realDonaldTrump @TheAuthorGuy Our president is insane.  And a little little man. Shame on all of those who voted for him.  How many times can I say I TOLD YOU SO
870473889868021761 2017-06-01 02:55:22 UTC <Stephlee77> @marimancusi @CoryBooker You have no room to talk! I liked you it you have lost all my respect by defending Kushner. I know he donated to you, but treason is illegal
870473443497709569 2017-06-01 02:53:36 UTC <Stephlee77> @MichaelGrantBks I think Trump pulled out of Paris Accord for sole reason he is intimidated by Marcon. The handshake heard around the world! He is bonkers!
870472480644845568 2017-06-01 02:49:46 UTC <Stephlee77> @Shoshannah7 I just watched Into the Mystic today!  What a great episode.  Loved you in this role. You are definitely Wayward AF!  #WaywardAF
870472054939713536 2017-06-01 02:48:05 UTC <Stephlee77> @whatsheread I think he pulled out of the Paris Accord because he felt threatened by Marcon!  The man is completely fucking bonkers! Such a tiny man
870471736894029826 2017-06-01 02:46:49 UTC <Stephlee77> @DavidHaydnJones I already own two of these.   But maybe I should get just one more.    And donate to a friend??
870470833940164608 2017-06-01 02:43:14 UTC <Stephlee77> @feliciaday You are not the only one.  #resist. But we use stand up to this. I'm one little person but I will use my voice and my vote for good!!
870470057658286081 2017-06-01 02:40:08 UTC <Stephlee77> @kayeholl Yeah.  I'm with the Urban Decay.  May be $20 but best damned lipstick  I've ever owned!
870374913248514048 2017-06-01 20:22:04 UTC <Stephlee77> Watching the #spellingbee at lunch is stressing me out.  I don't know how these kids are surviving!
870374913135300610 2017-06-01 20:22:04 UTC <Stephlee77> Watching the #spellingbee. Damn hear kids are smart.  Go Alice!  She is my favorite!

870116114478583810 2017-05-31 03:13:42 UTC <Stephlee77> @MarkRPellegrino You are a very intelligent man.
870074500183986180 2017-05-31 00:28:20 UTC <Stephlee77> @twindian2 It is So NOT a waste of money. It is literally the only thing keeping me sane. Do what feels right for YOU and no 1 else. U will be happier

869747761889107969 2017-05-30 02:50:00 UTC <Stephlee77> @JenHartling I think all of us "readers" do the same thing!
869726853036199939 2017-05-30 01:26:55 UTC <Stephlee77> @johncusack Talk about having no idea what REAL Americans are going through.  Champagne popsicles?  Really? I just lost my health coverage but why not!
869725019684917250 2017-05-30 01:19:38 UTC <Stephlee77> @JenHartling This is interesting, but I liked them all!  My mom said I would read a cereal box if it was all I had!!
869724143079624705 2017-05-30 01:16:09 UTC <Stephlee77> @WaywardDaughtrs @Nikki_Novak Well  thank you!  It was a long road for me and I had people I didn't know do nice things for me.  I'm only trying to pay it back.
869723079131451392 2017-05-30 01:11:55 UTC <Stephlee77> This is definitely something we should all take part inhttps://twitter.com/nikki_novak/status/869639892640432128

869402521923715072 2017-05-29 03:58:08 UTC <Stephlee77> @DestielLove1 @Mark_Sheppard But we don't want you to go!!   if I hold my breath and throw a tantrum will you please come back??

868460804940673024 2017-05-27 13:36:05 UTC <Stephlee77> @DavidHaydnJones It's good that you are so nice to your fans.  Makes up for being so villainous in tv!!  
868314763318702080 2017-05-26 03:55:46 UTC <Stephlee77> @Shoshannah7 Congrats!!!   It will be amazing!!
868304031348871168 2017-05-26 03:13:08 UTC <Stephlee77> @MichaelGrantBks I may be wrong but I thought treason was punishable by death? I don't advocate for the death penalty but I'd happily give him life!
868300607437910016 2017-05-26 02:59:31 UTC <Stephlee77> @Mark_Sheppard you are amazing and an inspiration! You will be sorely missed. And I am buying a shirt as soon as I can pool the $ for it
868300131808014336 2017-05-26 02:57:38 UTC <Stephlee77> @TrueFactsStated Agreed. Treason is a CRIME. I'm sure there is a jail cell with his name on it!
868299170360307712 2017-05-26 02:53:49 UTC <Stephlee77> @MichaelGrantBks thanks! Most of my heroes are authors and you sir are one. Next book tour I'd like to get my Gone books signed! Nice to know you're aces IRL

868290434023477248 2017-05-26 02:19:06 UTC <Stephlee77> @chrislhayes @johncusack This is treason plain and simple.  This man is a criminal and something needs To be done.  Swiftly.
868290207933714432 2017-05-26 02:18:12 UTC <Stephlee77> Amenhttps://twitter.com/hollow_raven/status/868261773140529152
868289194485059584 2017-05-26 02:14:10 UTC <Stephlee77> @sedonalipstick @McFaul No he would rather alienate our country to the actual allies we have.  Or had. I would say past tense is probably accurate
868288708822401027 2017-05-26 02:12:14 UTC <Stephlee77> @FoxNews @MichaelGrantBks You know she Fox News is reporting it, there is nothing left to deny!
868288460863533056 2017-05-26 02:11:15 UTC <Stephlee77> @tmorello I'm seriously crying  right now.  The utter sadness of this is almost breaking me.
868288261361471488 2017-05-26 02:10:28 UTC <Stephlee77> Happy happy birthday!!https://twitter.com/rachelcaine/status/868250868570783744
868288057681883141 2017-05-26 02:09:39 UTC <Stephlee77> @sedonalipstick @BeauWillimon Ummmmm. Treason???
868287441664446465 2017-05-26 02:07:12 UTC <Stephlee77> And I say one more time.   This man could have been our POTUS. Breaks my heart.  Because he is smart and FOR THE REAL AMERICAN PEOPLE!https://twitter.com/sensanders/status/867828593719738369
868276834928128002 2017-05-26 01:25:03 UTC <Stephlee77> Just a reminder. THIS MAN could have been your POTUS. At least he wouldn't be shoving his way to the front of the photo-op! He has class!https://twitter.com/sensanders/status/867828593719738369
868275959325237249 2017-05-26 01:21:35 UTC <Stephlee77> @stacylwhitman @scalzi We did.  And this time the Majority of the American people voted for one as well. We are so screwed now though. It's downright embarrassing
868275326333407232 2017-05-26 01:19:04 UTC <Stephlee77> @FreddyInSpace @elizabethscraig Love it!
868269867346132994 2017-05-26 00:57:22 UTC <Stephlee77> @HouseGOP @GOP @MichaelGrantBks You are absolutely right. I am ashamed to be an American right now. I have never felt like this before. Shame on the entire Republican Party
868269559446425600 2017-05-26 00:56:09 UTC <Stephlee77> @crystalchappell @BBCNews This brings tears to my eyes. Such a sick and senseless attack
868269035372392449 2017-05-26 00:54:04 UTC <Stephlee77> @sarahdessen @melissacwalker I ask myself his question with ever news report I see.  When will it be enough?  Seriously it's treason to collude with another country
868268691795963904 2017-05-26 00:52:42 UTC <Stephlee77> @whatsheread I get party lines but come on!  Enough is enough and anyone that still supports this criminal should lose their seat next election. EOS
868268486216359936 2017-05-26 00:51:53 UTC <Stephlee77> @whatsheread I'm am still blown away by the GOP. Hilary sent emails from the wrong server and they screamed PRISON. This is so much worse and nothing.
868268018559844352 2017-05-26 00:50:01 UTC <Stephlee77> @MichaelGrantBks It's such a blatant slap in the face to the country. Hilary sent emails on the wrong. Server and they screamed PRISON. This is SO much worse
868267794399363073 2017-05-26 00:49:08 UTC <Stephlee77> @MichaelGrantBks I quite literally just said that to someone.  I am blown away by the fact hat the GOP is making no efforts to do anything about it
868264004766060544 2017-05-26 00:34:04 UTC <Stephlee77> @whatsheread This election should be voided for collusion with the Russians.  Isn't that treason?

823700940221980672 2017-01-23 01:16:22 UTC <Stephlee77> @mimi_albert @IreadYA Mother/daughter read?  Yay!  My daughter and I are starting a blog together and looking for the first great book!
823692543703609344 2017-01-23 00:43:00 UTC <Stephlee77> @Pam_Vickers I know!  The kids have no say in anything.  I always felt sorry for young ones at the White House. People can be cruel
823672375770251266 2017-01-23 23:22:52 UTC <Stephlee77> @Pam_Vickers I agree but I bet Sasha and Malia are loving this just a little bit!  They were the butt of some horrific jokes. And words.
823668376824332289 2017-01-23 23:06:58 UTC <Stephlee77> Just when I thought Fox's Lucifer couldn't get any better, they went out and brought on @Omundson as God!  Who knew God would be dead sexy?
823663971039408130 2017-01-23 22:49:28 UTC <Stephlee77> @PrettyMissThea AMEN sister!  I am signing on to help!!

823661784359960577 2017-01-23 22:40:46 UTC <Stephlee77> @IreadYA even though it's on tv, I would still have to say Rory Gilmore!!  But Hermoine is a close second!
823660963996037120 2017-01-23 22:37:31 UTC <Stephlee77> @rachelcaine and just a see note. My daughter and I LOVE your Morganville series!  I think it was the 1st series we started reading together
823660503075590144 2017-01-23 22:35:41 UTC <Stephlee77> @rachelcaine when the insurance changed and wouldn't pay for it 2 years ago, there wasn't a generic.  I should really see if there is now!
823645273192800256 2017-01-23 21:35:10 UTC <Stephlee77> Watching This Is Us on dvr.  I'm so in love with Jack!  He is the greatest dad/husband. Ever!!  #ThisIsUs #ilovejack

823528726260498433 2017-01-23 13:52:03 UTC <Stephlee77> @rachelcaine Now I get them regularly. I just hate it. When my insur. dropped Maxalt tht I would buy outright till I found out $395/6 pills!
823528467983695873 2017-01-23 13:51:01 UTC <Stephlee77> @rachelcaine that's crazy! I have had headaches all my life: bad eyes/too many books! Only got migraines after epidural with daughter!

823409527550640129 2017-01-22 05:58:24 UTC <Stephlee77> @rachelcaine really? Maxalt didn't work? Man I thought it was a wonder drug! Never had any luck with imitrex. Hope you are feeling better!

823355910332489729 2017-01-22 02:25:20 UTC <Stephlee77> @sebroche yes but you realize now there are Alternative facts, or truths. Just so we can be crystal clear!Genius way of legitimizing a lie!

820538143443009537 2017-01-14 07:48:32 UTC <Stephlee77> @jumblejim @Radioroger It doesn't make mainline Christians RIGHT. It just means they don't practice what they preach! That = hypocrisy.

800200694405984256 2016-11-19 04:54:47 UTC <Stephlee77> @Jolena3 we finally agree on something. My kids DO deserve better. They most certainly deserve better than Trump.The world IS LAUGHING AT US
800199784510406656 2016-11-19 04:51:10 UTC <Stephlee77> @MichaelAusiello @Peace_Janise No, I was seeing and hearing what ACTUALLY happened.   Just ask the other million people that watched video!
800199406918062080 2016-11-19 04:49:40 UTC <Stephlee77> @Jolena3 if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck....if you aren't a racist, you SUPPORT a racist.  Sorry but that makes u a racist

800196383592640517 2016-11-19 04:37:39 UTC <Stephlee77> @Jolena3 the last time AMERICA wasn't safe was 9/11. Correct me if I'm wrong but that was Bush's watch not Obama. He has done wonders for US
800195696548642816 2016-11-19 04:34:55 UTC <Stephlee77> @MichaelAusiello @Peace_Janise Seriously? The audience was booing Pense. Did you WATCH the video?Audience LOVED the actor/hated the VPelect!
800195025942417408 2016-11-19 04:32:15 UTC <Stephlee77> @Jolena3 and Donald Trump is a disgrace.  To the human race.  Obama is the epitome of class and grace.  And he doesn't tweet like a moron!

800187930765561856 2016-11-19 04:04:04 UTC <Stephlee77> @Momcat2111 @Jolena3 we might as well agree to disagree because u will NEVER change my mind.pic.twitter.com/5EDIVPx4fB
800187751425601537 2016-11-19 04:03:21 UTC <Stephlee77> @Jolena3 delusional if you think that 3500 lawsuits is "poor work". http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/

800183721789890561 2016-11-19 03:47:20 UTC <Stephlee77> @Momcat2111 @Jolena3 Does that # include all the people he DIDNT pay or the ones he defrauded?  Fact check dear
800183287230693380 2016-11-19 03:45:37 UTC <Stephlee77> @Momcat2111 @Jolena3 you are seriously delusional if you actually believe that. Trump is good though.He has almost half the country snowed
800170376747745280 2016-11-19 02:54:18 UTC <Stephlee77> @Peace_Janise @MichaelAusiello You are so right. Cast went so far as to ask the audience to stop booing. It's more than I would have done!

800162213382090752 2016-11-19 02:21:52 UTC <Stephlee77> @Momcat2111 @Jolena3 wake up!!! Trump has only EVER put himself first.  Why would he start now thinking of anyone else? Ask his 1st 2 wives!
800122154608050177 2016-11-19 23:42:41 UTC <Stephlee77> @YouTube @SenSanders @DimitriNosarev hahahahaha.  You sir are laughable.   But thank you for making my day!!   I needed a good laugh
