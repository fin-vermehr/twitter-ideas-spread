970157455706554368 2018-03-03 04:42:16 UTC <jakebecknation> It has to do with so many of the jobs being jockeyed for by people who love it. And so you distance yourself from the love of it to express your distance from the crowd of people who aren't there yet, and bc the people who made it are jaded so you parrot them.
970157454142078976 2018-03-03 04:42:16 UTC <jakebecknation> There's this thing in this industry where being a fan feels really dangerous and potentially delegitimizing to your rep as a professional, and I hate that. Some of it is just me being me and seeing pitholes where there aren't any. But it's not nothing.
970009222573445121 2018-03-03 18:53:15 UTC <jakebecknation> The question of focusing on MLS cup, supporters shield, or open cup poses a real Trophies Choice to @NYCFC and I will nycf-see my way out @BlueBallsPod

968610461632614400 2018-02-27 22:15:04 UTC <jakebecknation> I don't think Free For All mentioned how the Shuberts fucking saved the public, Joe Papp, A Chorus Line, and literally the entire city of new york. This is a hell of a story from Michael Riedel #TEDxBway
968608731427635200 2018-02-27 22:08:12 UTC <jakebecknation> "Broadway does not get the credit it deserves for saving this city in its hour of need" ok Riedel I see you #tedxbway

968593423145078785 2018-02-27 21:07:22 UTC <jakebecknation> Staci Slaughter has the best lesson for directors so far - let the fun live and the work gets better. Real in the front-facing element and real in the rehearsal room. #TEDxBway

968583801935982592 2018-02-27 20:29:08 UTC <jakebecknation> Here's my take from Karen Brooks Hopkins: artists, invite development directors into your rooms. Join them to your process. Fundraising starts with the product. Everyone wants to touch greatness. #TEDxBway
968583070843535360 2018-02-27 20:26:14 UTC <jakebecknation> If anyone at the #TEDxBway audience is becoming inspired to start fundraising hmu.
968582552473743366 2018-02-27 20:24:10 UTC <jakebecknation> "we need fundraising talent. We need a lot of it and it's in short supply." 120 resumes for an associate programmer 3 for a development director.  How do we sex up begging for funds?
968582159652057088 2018-02-27 20:22:36 UTC <jakebecknation> Obsessed with Karen Brooks Hopkins insisting we keep pursuing public funding for the arts ||because the arts deserve it|| #TEDxBway
968580722406682624 2018-02-27 20:16:54 UTC <jakebecknation> Very exciting stats on 2017 for diversity, accessibility, and investment. Our industry is going in the right direction. Nice to work in a utopian  art form. Plus Neil Labute lost another production today so good news all around. #tedxbway
968576819678138369 2018-02-27 20:01:23 UTC <jakebecknation> @IoneLloyd I am a director, and I'm at #tedxbway and I want to read your work how do I do it??

968572681565147136 2018-02-27 19:44:57 UTC <jakebecknation> Theater allows us to love ourselves more fully, from Julie Stroud. I have thoughts about this and the economic privilege of theater audiences, but it is a beautiful notion about theater and redemption. #tedxbway

947634131835539456 2017-12-31 01:02:37 UTC <jakebecknation> 1 - Kendrick Lamar - DAMN. a grower, and exponentially. Rewards relistens, rewards obsession. The most carefully wrought of his big three. Flow has never been so unlabored. Humble video is perfect. Choose to feel lucky you're alive to watch him work.
947631829942665216 2017-12-31 00:53:29 UTC <jakebecknation> 2 - SZA - Ctrl. Feels like a distillation of decades of R&B. SZA an instant star act + care-measured tsps of wink and kink in the album.
947630277865754624 2017-12-31 00:47:19 UTC <jakebecknation> 3 - King Krule - The OOZ. what the fuck? Even when playing at aggression, its so lethargic. I wanted to tell him "Shut up, man. Go to bed."
947608469661765635 2017-12-31 23:20:39 UTC <jakebecknation> @TreyFillmore I know it's a serious rebrand for me

947600833650331649 2017-12-31 22:50:18 UTC <jakebecknation> This year I resolve to stop talking so much shit, especially about people that fundamentally I like, and ESPECIALLY about people in the industry.
947600699034165249 2017-12-31 22:49:46 UTC <jakebecknation> This year I resolve to answer my emails with more promptness and cultivate relationships of responsibility with artists I admire.
947600572349378560 2017-12-31 22:49:16 UTC <jakebecknation> This year I resolve to see more theater that surprises me and challenge my own sense of taste and value.

946791802367029249 2017-12-29 17:15:30 UTC <jakebecknation> 5 - Lorde - Melodrama. Best album of the year. Every song is a gift from Lorde, my mom, and Jack Antonoff, my dad, & makes it easier to be alive.
946791200631246848 2017-12-29 17:13:07 UTC <jakebecknation> 6 - Moses Sumney - Aromanticism. Warm saline veinbath. Best sense of tension-release on this list. Tantric often, like d'ang at his best. Save.
946790634400178176 2017-12-29 17:10:52 UTC <jakebecknation> 7 - Vince Staples - Big Fish Theory. Vince a genius. Need more time with this one but  that someone so prolific still has his best yet to come.
946790249644085248 2017-12-29 17:09:20 UTC <jakebecknation> 8 - Tyler, the Creator - Flower Boy. To paraphrase Achewood, TtC music feels to me like a perfectly good used car I sold to a stranger. Next.
946789193493172224 2017-12-29 17:05:08 UTC <jakebecknation> 9 - Fever Ray - Plunge. Honestly brutal, like how Depeche Mode was brutal - subversively. Fever Ray will demolish you with her wet dreams.
946788590813663232 2017-12-29 17:02:45 UTC <jakebecknation> 10 - Jlin - Black Origami. BREAKNECK. Perpetual disruption and still danceable. Footwork meets kraftwerk. This is futurmusik.
946603088093372416 2017-12-28 04:45:37 UTC <jakebecknation> Socialist bonus:  -poverty of individual by withholding financial freedom or general poverty of family And finally: -disagree about star wars

Everyone's like it's a new Jay-Z no mfers it's the old Jay-Z grown up. Raw and real and sharp as ever but with new shit to say. I broke the rule but it's Jay.
944009232181055488 2017-12-21 00:58:34 UTC <jakebecknation> @kevinmccauley Thas how u make more socialists baby
943974177467486214 2017-12-21 22:39:16 UTC <jakebecknation> 14 - Mount Eerie - A Crow Looked At Me. Like "Death Be Not Proud," a broadcast from the war zone of grief. also like dbnp - a miracle.
943973350900224005 2017-12-21 22:35:59 UTC <jakebecknation> 15 - Sampha - Process. Haunting and apologetic, but not in a shirking way. A scouting camp on the edge of wellness.

943952375156543490 2017-12-21 21:12:38 UTC <jakebecknation> 17 - Charlotte Gainsbourg - Rest. She puts on hats worn by Fiona Apple, Robyn, and her own pop pop,  but never really finds her chapeau.
943951134422654976 2017-12-21 21:07:42 UTC <jakebecknation> 18 - Julien Baker - Turn Out the Lights. Primal, thunderous need. Baker sings from the bottom of a pit & transforms it to an amphitheater.
943950581550510080 2017-12-21 21:05:31 UTC <jakebecknation> 19 - Migos - Culture. Honestly who would complain? Makes you feel invincible end to end, and never stops being fun. All hail the ATL.

943576923048988675 2017-12-20 20:20:43 UTC <jakebecknation> 20 - Bjork - Utopia. Cool but also exhausting. I haven't had my Bjork moment yet and this isn't where it starts.
943576558807277568 2017-12-20 20:19:17 UTC <jakebecknation> 21 - Arca - s/t. Ridley Scott OSTs meets Burial. Rich, even sensual, and occasionally with real surprises in the wash of dread.

942597440863178752 2017-12-17 03:28:37 UTC <jakebecknation> 29 - Run The Jewels - RTJ3. These dudes are so important but this is my least fave of all 3 RTJs. But I'm still so glad it happened.

941784722094592000 2017-12-15 21:39:09 UTC <jakebecknation> 48 - (Sandy) Alex G - Rocket. At first you're like, more nu-folk bs - but then it gets weird. PF says: listen multiple times. No thanks.
941784307709947904 2017-12-15 21:37:31 UTC <jakebecknation> 49 - Open Mike Eagle - Brick Body Kids Still Daydream. this is hipster rap tho. OME guested on Improv4Humans and I'm like :-/ . Bookmarked.
941783862551760896 2017-12-15 21:35:44 UTC <jakebecknation> 50 - Yaeji - EP/EP2. EP2 way better than EP. Single is good. Solid party music. Spooky, a little! Bookmarked.

937569173059899393 2017-12-03 06:28:04 UTC <jakebecknation> @NYCTSubway well here we are again, with you failing to report train stoppages and me stuck on the subway with nothing to do but scream at you.
937520089582260224 2017-12-03 03:13:02 UTC <jakebecknation> @Ohmaar1 As aforementioned, this nonsense was never a tax bill mtg in the first place.
937363752281935872 2017-12-03 16:51:48 UTC <jakebecknation> @SenSchumer @Ohmaar1 Mm that meeting was fully about government funding, not the tax bill in any sense, which the president had no hand in writing.
937105704439214080 2017-12-02 23:46:25 UTC <jakebecknation> @BillKristol @RBPundit @eggasalad Breh it's a thought but Trump had nothing to do with this thing. This is a McConnell-RINO-lobbyist state bill passed by a drowning Republican party in the hopes of getting a lifeline. Don't forget: Rubio voted yes bb.
937096366228230144 2017-12-02 23:09:18 UTC <jakebecknation> @NYCTSubway It's twenty fuckin' seventeen. You have free software which enables quick and ubiquitous alerts about these things. Don't tell people trains are running "with delays". They are stopped, until further notice. People spend their money. Your admin and your mothers should be ashamed.
937094599583072259 2017-12-02 23:02:17 UTC <jakebecknation> @NYCTSubway Example 3: people on either side of me are restlessly moving in and out of the doors, which suggests the train is not moving. Example 4: the conductor has been pacing up and down the train in lieu of your cheap unmaintained intercom system, assuring us the train is not moving.
937094066097065984 2017-12-02 23:00:10 UTC <jakebecknation> @NYCTSubway I am sitting on a train which is for sure not moving. I can provide several measures of accuracy. Example 1: the train is not moving. Example 2: snapchat's mph filter reads zero because the train is not moving.
937093425672982528 2017-12-02 22:57:37 UTC <jakebecknation> @NYCTSubway This is not true, no trains are running. Please update.

936665689565401088 2017-12-01 18:37:57 UTC <jakebecknation> @Ohmaar1 this is SUMMARILY debunkable on multiple levels but the main one for me is: the problems in these cities are deeper-rooted than the last 20 or even the last 40 years of politics.  Correlation =/= causation, and all that.
936662533435424768 2017-12-01 18:25:24 UTC <jakebecknation> @Ohmaar1 you sure that's not a population density thing rather than a political policy thing?

I'm not interested in one where any dead cops are either but this is the problem at hand and to pretend that number is not a problem is deeply cruel.

931920508374876160 2017-11-18 16:22:18 UTC <jakebecknation> @NolteNC @Ohmaar1 It's wishful thinking. It's not just the accusers. People from the town. People from the mall. Former friends of the judge. The argument is it doesn't fit his pattern of behavior but the longer you look, the more it does. Believe women.

861298134265344000 2017-05-07 19:14:12 UTC <jakebecknation> the story, once again, is Pirlo benched for 19-year-old Herrera. or is he 20 now?https://twitter.com/NYCFC/status/861297809622020097
861290176626216960 2017-05-07 18:42:34 UTC <jakebecknation> it's not too late for danladi to win rookie of the year if he puts goals away like that last one @MNUFC

858493622618136577 2017-04-29 01:30:04 UTC <jakebecknation> honestly, nycfc playing with fucking fire in these last few minutes. to columbus' credit, they're not making this an easy 3.
858493372369182721 2017-04-29 01:29:04 UTC <jakebecknation> vieira ends the drought and brings RJ out of the Mix-Nay Zone for 2.5 minutes of play. is this the end of RJGate?
858492472619655168 2017-04-29 01:25:30 UTC <jakebecknation> pun-wise, i mean.
858492436083068929 2017-04-29 01:25:21 UTC <jakebecknation> finally we get the most important matchup of the league: brilliant v afful  #NYCFC
858491719440105473 2017-04-29 01:22:30 UTC <jakebecknation> okoli out, he will be pissed he couldn't open his account for @NYCFC. but real promising. pulled a lot of defenders off their marks tonight.
858490346954739712 2017-04-29 01:17:03 UTC <jakebecknation> good tackles have been so key in this match. it's how nycfc has maintained control of the game despite possession feeling less confident.
858490067454767104 2017-04-29 01:15:56 UTC <jakebecknation> can you just feel how beaming villa must be right now from his sickbed
858488975274717185 2017-04-29 01:11:36 UTC <jakebecknation> oh my god this is a fucking joy
858488628447719425 2017-04-29 01:10:13 UTC <jakebecknation> maxi is the header-hungriest five footer in the history of the game
858487827922919426 2017-04-29 01:07:02 UTC <jakebecknation> lol @ homegame v atlanta ad seconds later
858487276736794625 2017-04-29 01:04:51 UTC <jakebecknation> and not for nothin', but it came from a cross that was weighted like a dream. young guns, take a breath & it pays off. alleycat strike shit.
858486184519098368 2017-04-29 01:00:30 UTC <jakebecknation> DADDY YANGKEE
858486124083388416 2017-04-29 01:00:16 UTC <jakebecknation> YANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD
858484564859252737 2017-04-29 00:54:04 UTC <jakebecknation> but not if we keep fucking wasting chances with frantic overpowered high crosses in.
858484434466746368 2017-04-29 00:53:33 UTC <jakebecknation> more pros - disposession was stellar in the end of the first half. no reason not to expect 1 to 2 more goals from NYCFC in this half.

841647720624463872 2017-03-14 13:50:28 UTC <jakebecknation> @adafruit thread inspired by 'tech literacy' reading this morning. have we heard from anyone marrying tech and theater using adafruit tools?
841647241060323328 2017-03-14 13:48:33 UTC <jakebecknation> 4) asking how the live experience can be amplified, not substituted, by the addition of contemporary tech solutions. [10]
841646801014927360 2017-03-14 13:46:49 UTC <jakebecknation> 3) rewarding spaces, academic and nonprofit, that make room for technological experimentation in theater (see: Complicite, 'the encounter')
841646392162549760 2017-03-14 13:45:11 UTC <jakebecknation> we should be: 1) mandating tech literacy in theater design majors. 2) building partnerships between theaters and tech firms
841645901298991105 2017-03-14 13:43:14 UTC <jakebecknation> but it's just the beginning! media is just one small facet of the tech landscape! there's much more creative problem-solving available! [7]
841645596779958273 2017-03-14 13:42:01 UTC <jakebecknation> but obviously we've reached one turning point by learning to integrate a variety of media simultaneously in storytelling, e.g. wooster [6]
841645359805919232 2017-03-14 13:41:05 UTC <jakebecknation> see: 'poor theater' purism, drama's constantly renewed pledge to the trappings of its antiquated forms [elizabethan+greek esp] [5]
841645170793799682 2017-03-14 13:40:20 UTC <jakebecknation> theater academia, especially the less rigorous depts, would have you believe the theater is inherently for luddites [4]
841644816190574593 2017-03-14 13:38:55 UTC <jakebecknation> how long was it for instance before theaters invested in LED grids?? 100 times more versatile, efficient, cost-effective, and yet. [3]
841644570974814208 2017-03-14 13:37:57 UTC <jakebecknation> If we take design as a logical entry point for practical technology application it's amazing how long it's taken for designers to use it [2]
841644262550863872 2017-03-14 13:36:43 UTC <jakebecknation> reading some amazing stuff about technology integration this morning. this is a challenge the theater has never known how to live up to [1]pic.twitter.com/GUMwFY06Te

811480537756004352 2016-12-20 07:56:51 UTC <jakebecknation> ...when people say this is a great time for artists, this is what they mean. people are blood hungry for meaning. your cue. [/thread]
811480233941594113 2016-12-20 07:55:39 UTC <jakebecknation> ...but also very dangerous and usually boring in school. make art that gleefully creates, shapes meaning. it becomes a beacon. it enervates.
811479789546721280 2016-12-20 07:53:53 UTC <jakebecknation> meaninglessness is a big fucking hallmark of traumatic times. art obsessed with meaninglessness is important...
811479236468965376 2016-12-20 07:51:41 UTC <jakebecknation> haha just realized i'm doing these decimals wrong 4.2) strive for mutualism. you are inspiring. activists are front-liners. they need you.
811478801783853056 2016-12-20 07:49:57 UTC <jakebecknation> 4) who can you co-op with? pair with organizers, advocacy groups, activist orgs. fundraise aggressively. share audience resources. strive fr
811478341555519489 2016-12-20 07:48:07 UTC <jakebecknation> 3.3) but emphatic individualism & self-love are only effective when paired with radical empathy. and that means making with others in mind.
811478120570224640 2016-12-20 07:47:15 UTC <jakebecknation> 3) what is your art supposed to do? What are you asking for answers to? What is your litmus test for success? avoiding this q is tempting.
811477886603563008 2016-12-20 07:46:19 UTC <jakebecknation> 2.2) and how can you build a sense of immediate or long-term community with performance? everything feels less foolish with friends.
811477759121911808 2016-12-20 07:45:48 UTC <jakebecknation> 2) what surrounds your art? how is the event part and parcel with performance? what opportunities for exchange and solidarity do you provide
811477614623883264 2016-12-20 07:45:14 UTC <jakebecknation> 1) who is your audience? this one particularly impt and particularly impossible. downtown theater esp is 99.9repeating religiously leftist.
811477367914958848 2016-12-20 07:44:15 UTC <jakebecknation> we all need to be working on making art that incurs, not satisfies, the need for active participation. how do we determine the difference?

800355460297596928 2016-11-20 15:09:46 UTC <jakebecknation> @Lin_Manuel mentioning that the whole controversy is a deliberate distraction from a $25 million fraud settlement. could do so much good.

799661762077454336 2016-11-18 17:13:15 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy and social leftists thought it was more important that they stand behind the bad-telling than invite the bad-told in.
799661312682901504 2016-11-18 17:11:28 UTC <jakebecknation> @hamandcheese @rydyguy also fair, and v good news.
799661082080149504 2016-11-18 17:10:33 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy v much agreed. and i'm not pitching a morgan freeman anti-identity mvmt. but taking a stern-teacher attitude abt privilege failed.
799660683889623044 2016-11-18 17:08:58 UTC <jakebecknation> @hamandcheese @rydyguy BEFORE you get there i KNOW part of that is DNC horseshit
799660600532013056 2016-11-18 17:08:38 UTC <jakebecknation> @hamandcheese @rydyguy and bernie failed to reach black voters -- is it in part because he tried pitching that message? it's a tightrope.
799660367412600833 2016-11-18 17:07:43 UTC <jakebecknation> @hamandcheese @rydyguy i.e. disenfranchised minorities & disenfranchised whites - are oppressed by the same economic factors (2/2)

799660121550966785 2016-11-18 17:06:44 UTC <jakebecknation> @hamandcheese @rydyguy dems been looking for a "yes and" approach 8 years but something about their approach has turned off constituents.
799659973408071681 2016-11-18 17:06:09 UTC <jakebecknation> @hamandcheese @rydyguy yeah i agree. so shouldn't we be critiquing the rhetoric to make that possible?
799659718146826240 2016-11-18 17:05:08 UTC <jakebecknation> @hamandcheese @rydyguy but it does in the sense that alienating a constituency makes it difficult to create a coalition with them
799659216239726592 2016-11-18 17:03:08 UTC <jakebecknation> @hamandcheese @rydyguy slash isn't there a difference between a pro-diversity sentiment and a "rhetoric of identity"?

796380453641056258 2016-11-09 15:54:30 UTC <jakebecknation> why stick your head in the sand when you can stick it in a half-empty audience where everyone agrees with you
796380364910592001 2016-11-09 15:54:09 UTC <jakebecknation> yes thank goodness we all get to see some totally ineffective echo chamber theater tonight don't miss a beat theater marketers
796376082454839296 2016-11-09 15:37:08 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy ugh but those death penalty measures were piss flavored icing on a shit cupcake
796372744963244032 2016-11-09 15:23:52 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy the dsa meetings i went to felt so neutered. but i guess that also is part of the work.
796372607503319040 2016-11-09 15:23:20 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy do you feel like bernie's post-elec campaign is going to bear fruit? people were pretty pessimistic but. it would be nice.
796371745573834752 2016-11-09 15:19:54 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy yeah. i've been scrolling through jacobin.
796371666817400832 2016-11-09 15:19:35 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy so it behooves those people to understand that this is not the bush years part 2. this changes duty to justice fundamentally.
796371360813613056 2016-11-09 15:18:22 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy and that we are entering a moment fundamentally different enough from other moments in living memory.
796371202872840192 2016-11-09 15:17:45 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy i know we're just quibbling about rhetoric. and i'm not advocating armed revolution, but i am advocating constant resistance.
796370723291926528 2016-11-09 15:15:50 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy resolution is great but not at the cost of accepting some degree of violence on sick bodies, brown bodies, queer bodies.
796370519721385984 2016-11-09 15:15:02 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy but the violence is already happening. there is a history of violence and a pledge of violence. it has to be resisted.
796368544736878592 2016-11-09 15:07:11 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy war precludes complacency. that's why i don't find it "unhelpful." i don't ever want to forget the present threat.
796368199772176384 2016-11-09 15:05:49 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy i don't think so. because you have to see yourself under siege. you have to see every inch of ground as defensible.
796367729334906880 2016-11-09 15:03:57 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy i don't know yet. i'm not advocating violence, i'm not going all weather underground or anything.
796366679622164480 2016-11-09 14:59:46 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy they are the same people who fed men to machines from 1914 to 1918. they are the arbiters of a civil war.
796366478736031744 2016-11-09 14:58:58 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy and those are the classes that really declared war. those are the colonizing classes.
796366377489666048 2016-11-09 14:58:34 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy and their violence was only possible thanks to the violence of privileged classes on the right.
796366050677981184 2016-11-09 14:57:16 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy absolutely agreed. but that makes it no less true that to reclaim what disaffecteds felt was lost, they acted in violence.
796365019218870272 2016-11-09 14:53:10 UTC <jakebecknation> i talked for friends for months about the need to reconcile with the disaffected in this country. but this was a declaration of war.
796364446465716224 2016-11-09 14:50:54 UTC <jakebecknation> i don't know what's required now but i don't know if it makes any sense to continue on the way we have been. as if our lives are ours alone.
796364318262657024 2016-11-09 14:50:23 UTC <jakebecknation> writing is not enough. making more things is not enough. it is good. take care. take care of yourself and your friends. it is not enough.
796361678904496128 2016-11-09 14:39:54 UTC <jakebecknation> this is the definition of appeasement. this is not a shift in leadership. half the country has declared war on the other half.https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/796262780550586368

703216614687318016 2016-02-26 13:54:40 UTC <jakebecknation> @toomuchnick yes - matchup polls don't mean anything this early & trump's "unfavorability" rating among indys is wa-a-a-ay higher than hill.

702179140804415489 2016-02-23 17:12:07 UTC <jakebecknation> @rydyguy point of the article is that the line should be drawn earlier. which is not a dumb premise but it's written terribly. @jackshafer

701279336440135680 2016-02-20 05:36:37 UTC <jakebecknation> I think the rubio-trump slugfest is going to be extremely interesting. even more so depending on where cruz aims his attacks.
