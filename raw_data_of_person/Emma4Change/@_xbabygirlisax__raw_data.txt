961400711773900800 2018-02-07 00:46:06 UTC <_xbabygirlisax_> @ABC11_WTVD @MaryEM106 And officer is only supposed to use their mace, gun , or taser if they feel threatened and cant take the Individual down. SO THIS OFFICER COULDNT OVER POWER FRANK ? YOURE TELLING ME HE FELT THREATENED BY THIS KID. Ok Mary. Talk to me when that makes sense
961400184541466624 2018-02-07 00:44:00 UTC <_xbabygirlisax_> @ABC11_WTVD @MaryEM106 you mustve seen the video am I right ? Do you see how large in size this man who maybe is in his late 30s is. He is a grown , built man who couldve EASILY overpowered a 15 , 16 year old boy. Who might i add is not some big huge body builder that is impossible to take down
961399649444810754 2018-02-07 00:41:53 UTC <_xbabygirlisax_> @ABC11_WTVD @MaryEM106 OH DONT GET ME STARTED ON YOU MARY. FIRST OFF HE WASNT FIGHTING HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO STOP A FIGHT WITH SOMEONE HE IS CLOSE WITH. He never was gonna fight. So before you start saying  dont fight thats how you dont get pepper sprayed  SECOND OFF
961398719605338112 2018-02-07 00:38:11 UTC <_xbabygirlisax_> @ABC11_WTVD @luvinmysweetpea @pittdaddy98_big Get your facts straight before you one , try to come for how he was raised ( CAUSE HE WAS RAISED RIGHT HIS FAMILY IS AMAZING ). And try to input your opinion on a situation that you obviously dont know shit about.
961398033538797569 2018-02-07 00:35:27 UTC <_xbabygirlisax_> @ABC11_WTVD @luvinmysweetpea @pittdaddy98_big It was sprayed FOUR times. Even after Frank relaxed and stopped resisting  and second of all if someone was grabbing you by your shirt your first instinct wouldnt to try to pull them off ? And i repeat he got his glasses knocked off so he COULDNT EVEN SEE
961397568235327488 2018-02-07 00:33:36 UTC <_xbabygirlisax_> @ABC11_WTVD @luvinmysweetpea @pittdaddy98_big Spraying that pepper spray in a close proximity of his face made It worse. Cause like this lady said. The officer has to be standing a good proximity away. You see how clumped the mace was on his face. And you see he sprayed him like 4 times. And all the kids there can tell you
961397160192421888 2018-02-07 00:31:59 UTC <_xbabygirlisax_> @ABC11_WTVD @luvinmysweetpea @pittdaddy98_big Would know that he was not fighting. No fights even occurred. This officer was way bigger and completely capable of physically taking him down if he felt threatened. And the kid, wears glasses and in the video you see they got knocked off. So he couldnt see for shit. And
961396723930279936 2018-02-07 00:30:15 UTC <_xbabygirlisax_> @ABC11_WTVD @luvinmysweetpea @pittdaddy98_big FIRST OFF. Do you know the child ? No you dont we do. And saying that hes not disciplined and wasnt  taught respect. WRONG. He has always been taught to respect people. Hes always been taught the right thing. And another question, where you there ? NOPE. If you where you
