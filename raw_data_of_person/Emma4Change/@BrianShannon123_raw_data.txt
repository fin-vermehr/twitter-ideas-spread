The Gen 2 car might have already outgrown some of the existing circuits and battery development is coming in 2025 (a long way off...).  I think they've gotten it right for now though. Low costs are probably a factor in the manufacturer interest.
967721821746466816 2018-02-25 11:23:56 UTC <BrianShannon123> @FIAFormulaE @keith__johnston @ANHurst Formula E has focused on being a cost controlled series with tight street racing in small, lower performance cars.  To compete with F1, they'd need to open up battery development, allow heavier cars with bigger batteries and have dedicated racing circuits.

When capacity drops below 75%, you're entitled to a free replacement. I'd like to think you'd get a 41kWh upgrade. No one knows Battery cooling ensures the battery lasts too long for the battery hire to be cost effective.

We didn't use all this plastic before and it's not used elsewhere. It shouldn't take 10-15 years to keep plastic off fruit and veg.

That's the cost of reaching out to Daily Mail readers to save the animals they kill. Do you want liberals to stop killing animals or everyone? At some point, a choice has to be made.

964769360102547456 2018-02-16 07:51:54 UTC <BrianShannon123> @ElecVehicleGuy Good article but public charging is going to be more expensive for most. 300+ mile batteries will always be more expensive than 150 mile batteries. Electric cars already struggle on price for many home owners. This will be one of the last markets taken over by EV's.
964598686083928064 2018-02-16 20:33:42 UTC <BrianShannon123> Odd day today. On my commute I saw an Outlander PHEV, a BMW i3 and a 1st gen Leaf.pic.twitter.com/XFjERb3ZA0

964593409150287878 2018-02-16 20:12:44 UTC <BrianShannon123> @She_sElectric @Nissan 60kW? Unimpressive. The peak output of the current Leaf battery is at least 110kW. #UnitPolice

964583317659176961 2018-02-16 19:32:38 UTC <BrianShannon123> @StopFundingHate @QuornFoods @helencg1 Oddly I found a reasonable and recent article by the Daily Mail about veganism.

964577488394510336 2018-02-16 19:09:28 UTC <BrianShannon123> @matt303 RCI has consistently proven themselves to be a joke so I'm not looking forward to transferring the battery hire on my Zoe when the day comes.

964570356949405698 2018-02-16 18:41:08 UTC <BrianShannon123> @StopFundingHate @QuornFoods @helencg1 I support Quorn and their decision to remove their advert from this article. However vegetarians have a liberal bias and Quorn needs to appeal to everyone for the animals and the planet. They need to be willing to advertise in media they (and we) disagree with.

958771041832194048 2018-01-31 18:36:44 UTC <BrianShannon123> @ecarstrading @Evi3Girl 100% agree. I've yet to become a customer because plugging in is not quick enough (app issues) and they require a 20 minimum top up for a service I don't regularly use

958758683533565952 2018-01-31 17:47:37 UTC <BrianShannon123> @WiredUK 100kW charging becoming "mainstream" is pretty exciting. It's the main reason I'm flip flopping on buying this year's Zoe. That and the depreciation on a car that doesn't support government mandated charge points (not yet confirmed which standards will be required in the UK)

958454642182107137 2018-01-30 21:39:28 UTC <BrianShannon123> I decided to try @ChargemasterPlc again today because it was convenient. After 20 minutes of trying to log in (not sure password reset does anything??), I'm forced to leave the car before the shop closes.

958348695933804544 2018-01-30 14:38:29 UTC <BrianShannon123> Well this is a new development. The @RenaultZoeClub dealer won't take my car as they "have no market for used ZOE's." But I thought battery hire was popular @RenaultZE ?

So what is your problem with Zoe's?
958067974774165505 2018-01-29 20:02:59 UTC <BrianShannon123> @brheading I would but I don't have a driveway. And Belfast isn't using the on street residential charge point grants available.
958066171269603329 2018-01-29 19:55:49 UTC <BrianShannon123> @brheading Now that I think about it, what I'd really like is a CO2/kWh forecast but I'm sure that's far more complicated. AFAIK I should generally use the charge scheduler on my car and charge in the middle of the night. I've never tried it but I will on a public charge point tonight.
958058915488559104 2018-01-29 19:26:59 UTC <BrianShannon123> @brheading Now I'm wondering if there's any wind power forecasting so I can charge my car at the optimum times.

957569662480535552 2018-01-28 11:02:52 UTC <BrianShannon123> @fraserspeirs @plugincarguy I guess that's the average. Same story with the 2018 Leaf, 40-60 minutes from alert to 80%
957565172356444160 2018-01-28 10:45:02 UTC <BrianShannon123> @fraserspeirs @plugincarguy I'm basing that on Zoe charge times to 80%. 30 minutes for the 22kWh battery, 65 minutes for the 40kWh battery.
957563589585522688 2018-01-28 10:38:45 UTC <BrianShannon123> @fraserspeirs @plugincarguy Yes but you stop for a full hour vs half an hour which is far longer than I'd typically stop for.

955021424544174080 2018-01-21 10:17:05 UTC <BrianShannon123> @RenaultZE @martinjguk I know. I'm sitting in my Zoe now. I'm also spending about 2k/year rental on a battery that was worth 6k new. And mine is a used 22kWh battery, not the 40kWh battery of the same value.
955000510217687040 2018-01-21 08:53:59 UTC <BrianShannon123> @RenaultZE @martinjguk I don't follow. The battery isn't included in the price.
954997638067302400 2018-01-21 08:42:34 UTC <BrianShannon123> @martinjguk Clearly not relevant to EV's. But yes, aging cars pollute just as replacing cars does. I know several people who drive 14+ year old cars. Although I wouldn't expect most EV drivers to be in touch with that segment of society.
954991592389128193 2018-01-21 08:18:33 UTC <BrianShannon123> @NissanEV_UK @BMWi @martinjguk I hope the battery lasts longer than that. "The average age of a car at scrappage in 2015 reached 13.9 years"https://www.smmt.co.uk/industry-topics/sustainability/average-vehicle-age/

949678847796170753 2018-01-06 16:27:36 UTC <BrianShannon123> @NissanElectric @InsideEVs @pluginamerica At this point I'm not expecting more than a 50kWh battery with 50-80kW DC, the current onboard charger and motor. Nissan have positioned themselves for affordability believing what they offer now is good enough.
949617986607992832 2018-01-06 12:25:45 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy @melectriccar I was doing that occasionally at my previous workplace but the new one has been dancing around the issue sadly. Also the Q Zoe is only 60% efficient charging at that rate so I'd get about 50% over 8 hours. Certainly helpful but not enough in cold temps.
949604029793005574 2018-01-06 11:30:18 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy My nearest charge point from home was Lower Crescent St which has been out of service often and for long periods of time. I'll be travelling west where my nearest rapid CP is Dungannon. Getting to work then to that rapid in winter is tight. I waited for 70+mins charging yesterday
949576935721533440 2018-01-06 09:42:38 UTC <BrianShannon123> I'm gonna check how much I can get for my Zoe today. Started a new job this week and a 100 mile roundtrip commute without a charge point on either end doesn't really suit the car.

941961373894004736 2017-12-16 09:21:06 UTC <BrianShannon123> @VDA_online @auto_schmidt Fossil fuel mentality. You don't plug in to get a full charge. You charge while you do other things to get enough to make it to your destination (or a rapid, failing that). At rapids, only charge as much as you need up to 80%. AC charging will be the most commonly used.
941957853266481152 2017-12-16 09:07:07 UTC <BrianShannon123> @keith__johnston I don't think this is an about turn. Out of that 5.5m, they expect to sell 4.5m hybrids by 2030 which has been their focus so far. The remainder is a mix of BEV and FCEV.

I also believe it is possible to eat a healthy omnivorous diet with enough plants (much more than national minimum recommendations).
939803531841818624 2017-12-10 10:26:37 UTC <BrianShannon123> @veganoutreach @Rod_Noir That's a very human centric view which misses the point. The question is about their internal/emotional lives and the consequences of the answer on how we treat them.

It'd be nice to see higher specs in this series even though it is street racing.

My colleagues used your article to "prove" that electric cars aren't green at all. Further, I believe this was a deliberate consequence of your headline.

929800621112352774 2017-11-12 19:58:37 UTC <BrianShannon123> @AutoExpress @106Euan @LiamNCawley IIRC the battery rental on a Twizy isn't much less than a Zoe. And you can buy a used Zoe for just a few hundred more than a Twizy. It's a bit of a joke really.
929797460465213440 2017-11-12 19:46:04 UTC <BrianShannon123> @AutoExpress @LiamNCawley @106Euan Certainly for high mileage drivers, an EV with battery is a no brainer if charging suits the driver. I have my doubts about others.
929790216164073473 2017-11-12 19:17:16 UTC <BrianShannon123> @AutoExpress @LiamNCawley @106Euan A used ICE car goes for thousands less than a comparable EV. At typical mileage the payback period is long enough that the cost of a new battery comes into play
929787428537323520 2017-11-12 19:06:12 UTC <BrianShannon123> @AutoExpress @106Euan @LiamNCawley I wonder if the smart move financially is to buy a cheap diesel while EV's get cheaper and hopefully trade it in with a scrappage scheme in a few years

928160363815886850 2017-11-07 07:20:49 UTC <BrianShannon123> @ecotricity @meltymcface  The same trip would have cost 25 @ 50 MPG & 114.9p/L fuel.  In my Zoe, including battery hire and your electricity bill, it would cost 34.

926061480478470145 2017-11-02 12:20:36 UTC <BrianShannon123> @bobbyllew @Scheenagh In general, yes, they are either higher in purchase costs or running costs (in the case of battery hire + electricity). That'll change.

924767011380645889 2017-10-29 22:36:51 UTC <BrianShannon123> @nytclimate @melectriccar In that case, the effective charge time is the seconds it takes to plug in but I like to think we will easily use EV's for longer trips too.

923206006158561280 2017-10-25 15:13:58 UTC <BrianShannon123> @businessinsider But can we use them in spore drives?

922935433402683392 2017-10-24 21:18:49 UTC <BrianShannon123> @matt303 I can change the colour with both Alexa and Google Assistant. Works on the voice activated speakers and phone apps. It's nice and responsive
922765292622761984 2017-10-24 10:02:44 UTC <BrianShannon123> @keith__johnston No connection fee - good. Contactless - good. 100% Per kWh - Not sure. No overstay charges - bad.
922556969042538496 2017-10-23 20:14:56 UTC <BrianShannon123> @matt303 Fair. The batteries in particular will be getting very significantly cheaper in the near future. It probably does make sense to wait.
922554498953904128 2017-10-23 20:05:07 UTC <BrianShannon123> @matt303 That's a great price in my view. Isn't it well within the warranty period of the solar PV - even before incentives?
922551474374217731 2017-10-23 19:53:06 UTC <BrianShannon123> 5-7k for 4kW solar PV & 6kWh battery (50% of current prices, 3.5k solar with 350/kWh battery) is when I see home solar really taking off.
922549453441110018 2017-10-23 19:45:04 UTC <BrianShannon123> @The_PlugSeeker @H2Europe 15 minutes/200 miles (0.35 megawatts) is far more than sufficient. 200+ miles daily w/o rapid charging, plenty. 10 acres to charge cars? No.

922390325632667648 2017-10-23 09:12:45 UTC <BrianShannon123> @matt303 No question, I have Hue & it is better but you pay for it. Starting over now, I'd get the Home Mini and probably the IKEA lights (not tried)

922016719526334464 2017-10-22 08:28:10 UTC <BrianShannon123> @The_PlugSeeker @evmeerkat Between the Mission E, the Jaguar I-Pace and the 350kW European charge network, Tesla's monopoly might see some genuine competition.

921819411232804864 2017-10-21 19:24:08 UTC <BrianShannon123> @The_PlugSeeker @justevs_ Beautiful car. With good 70+ kW CCS infrastructure (and maybe 22kW AC depending again on CCS infrastructure) I'd love it

920521550792675328 2017-10-17 05:26:54 UTC <BrianShannon123> @MyEnergiLTD @dafmeuk In that case your Zoe is suited to 7kW or greater charging speeds so I'd avoid the export only modehttp://pushevs.com/2016/12/17/renault-zoe-charging-time-efficiency/
920518645851320320 2017-10-17 05:15:22 UTC <BrianShannon123> @BBCNewsNI @andrewdcharles Because we're removing ourselves from a larger trading block that includes all our neighbours. When we want back in, we'll be worse off.

919868348502040576 2017-10-16 10:11:19 UTC <BrianShannon123> @ecotricity @Shell @The_PlugSeeker You would think so. Investing early in charge points only to let them rust would be a strange business decision.
919861325496545280 2017-10-16 09:43:24 UTC <BrianShannon123> @ecotricity @Shell @The_PlugSeeker Well I suppose there won't be too many support issues with Shell's network if it's completely unused. #brightside

919579114553708544 2017-10-15 15:02:00 UTC <BrianShannon123> @MyEnergiLTD @dafmeuk Is that a Q Zoe (quick charge) or R Zoe (range, efficient charge)? In my Q Zoe, I've measured charging efficiency to be only 60.8% @ 2.3kW.
919572151589658625 2017-10-15 14:34:20 UTC <BrianShannon123> @businessinsider It's not surprising that making money from spare capacity in cars and homes doesn't appeal to millionaires.
919546015665000448 2017-10-15 12:50:29 UTC <BrianShannon123> @bobbyllew @VMwareBrendanR I'd ask for an offer if you're really interested. I made the mistake of comparing against RRP too but Zoe offers massively undercut the RRP.

919513043616268288 2017-10-15 10:39:27 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy @matt303 The idea is BEV for people who take short journeys & PHEV for others but you don't regen on long trips so the added weight makes PHEV worse.

916570226547920896 2017-10-07 07:45:45 UTC <BrianShannon123> @The_PlugSeeker If the point of having a long range EV is that you regularly do long trips, the Supercharger network is probably still huge.

907890583338979328 2017-09-13 08:55:57 UTC <BrianShannon123> @autocar @routundroulleur Do you drive 400 miles per day? That's about 5-6 hoursb non stop driving at motorway speeds. Why buy a battery that size?
907886137615757318 2017-09-13 08:38:17 UTC <BrianShannon123> Apparently charging bays are parking bays for hybrids even in empty car parks.pic.twitter.com/rlOh7rAXXM
907882265232990208 2017-09-13 08:22:54 UTC <BrianShannon123> @RenaultZoeClub That's pretty cool but most providers want triple standard. Above 22kW Renault needs to be thinking about DC power (and I believe they are)

907614861915541505 2017-09-12 14:40:20 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy @ToyotaPR Is there a need to plug in any hybrid?
907149967231520770 2017-09-11 07:53:00 UTC <BrianShannon123> @ESBGroup C8V2J in Ballaghaderreen has a Chademo connector as I informed you by email in July. Please update the app to reflect this.

906617453400281089 2017-09-09 20:36:59 UTC <BrianShannon123> @ESBGroup @melectriccar Unfortunately this model of charge point can't reboot each side individually so ESB won't reboot it with a car plugged in.
906609791849697280 2017-09-09 20:06:33 UTC <BrianShannon123> Couldn't charge today on 2 occasions @ESBGroup. Each time an EV was plugged in, the other side wasn't working (SC21 & SC45). Running low now
906244662893178880 2017-09-08 19:55:39 UTC <BrianShannon123> Assuming you get 150kW up to about 50% SOC in a 40kWh battery, my view is the main draw of a bigger battery is faster charging for longer.
906065065887100928 2017-09-08 08:02:00 UTC <BrianShannon123> Rapid charging Zoe, empty to 75 miles  30 minutes. 150kW charging 2018 Leaf, empty to 75 miles  10 minutes. This is what we need.
905847077921574912 2017-09-07 17:35:47 UTC <BrianShannon123> @autocar Stupid car. 435 miles @ avg 70mph is 5-6 hours driving (less range at that speed). Get a smaller battery and stop for other drivers' sake.

905835021960970241 2017-09-07 16:47:53 UTC <BrianShannon123> @autocar @ElecVehicleGuy I suspect most people won't want to buy a battery with that kind of range. They'll know they don't need it but faster charging is a must

905542490731798529 2017-09-06 21:25:28 UTC <BrianShannon123> @InsideEVs H2 @ 15p/mile is financially equivalent to 35 UK MPG @ 112.9p/L.

905290082122334209 2017-09-05 04:42:29 UTC <BrianShannon123> No 22kW AC recharging and identical range means the Zoe remains attractive in IE/NI. No 150kW DC is also a shame even if less relevant to ushttps://twitter.com/nievowners/status/905248561767604228

904085383142617088 2017-09-02 20:55:27 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy See the Texaco map to see what I mean https://texaco.co.uk/pages/store-locator.aspx

904079106588991490 2017-09-02 20:30:30 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy I dunno about that. The group includes Texaco which does operate here.

893784874125062144 2017-08-05 10:44:54 UTC <BrianShannon123> @nievowners @ESBGroup @desperate__dan The two limiting factors are likely CP unit and installation cost and space (though not all CP spaces need to be reserved).
893783545600241666 2017-08-05 10:39:37 UTC <BrianShannon123> @nievowners @ESBGroup @desperate__dan That may be the case for you but there's no reason to artificially limit charging speeds to 7kW.
893777809012920320 2017-08-05 10:16:49 UTC <BrianShannon123> @nievowners @ESBGroup @desperate__dan Twenty 7 kW CP's? See for yourself.https://evonestop.co.uk/collections/all/autocharge-ev-superfast
893777141153878017 2017-08-05 10:14:10 UTC <BrianShannon123> @nievowners @ESBGroup @desperate__dan Yes but you're assuming the cause is 22kW power. The cost of one 22kW CP is close to the cost of a 7kW CP and I doubt power is limited.
893532903740780544 2017-08-04 18:03:39 UTC <BrianShannon123> @candctaxis @OLEVgovuk @oxfordteddy @W1Cab @markcjclemence @PaulHornchurch @Lukafoto Formula E drivers will have one car each as of season 5 due to improved energy density.
893484670666420224 2017-08-04 14:52:00 UTC <BrianShannon123> @spectator @markcjclemence A hybrid does though, not that I believe that's the solution. But now I have to ask, why do you have a diesel on hire?
893482967603040256 2017-08-04 14:45:14 UTC <BrianShannon123> @spectator @markcjclemence I agree. EV's are the future. I'm just saying there are plenty of achievable improvements that need to be made.
893481871383945217 2017-08-04 14:40:52 UTC <BrianShannon123> @spectator @markcjclemence I agree with you on everything but cost. That's coming though.
893480151283060738 2017-08-04 14:34:02 UTC <BrianShannon123> @spectator @markcjclemence I rent without off street parking, a home charge point or PV's and my situation is much more common than yours.
893467593398505477 2017-08-04 13:44:08 UTC <BrianShannon123> @Lukafoto @riversimple It's not clear to me that the difference in health effects is large enough to be concerned about. This needs to be studied.
893460662130757632 2017-08-04 13:16:36 UTC <BrianShannon123> @nievowners @ESBGroup @desperate__dan I would be interested to know if these sites are limited to one 22kW CP due to power available.
893459364136333312 2017-08-04 13:11:26 UTC <BrianShannon123> @nievowners @ESBGroup @desperate__dan I understand your frustration but I own a car that does 22kW charging and I'm grateful for it. 7kW wouldn't get me even near a full charge.
893458121720565760 2017-08-04 13:06:30 UTC <BrianShannon123> @spectator @markcjclemence Actually no, I take back range. 150 miles is plenty in my view and some EV's are capable of much more than that, as you know.
893454069204955136 2017-08-04 12:50:24 UTC <BrianShannon123> @spectator @markcjclemence A lot of variables must improve including cost, range, charging speed, charging infrastructure and more renewables. Fair article IMO
893448546720129025 2017-08-04 12:28:27 UTC <BrianShannon123> @Lukafoto @riversimple Have the heath effects of small particle pollution by EV's been assessed relative to H2 and ICE vehicles?
893181175606411264 2017-08-03 18:46:01 UTC <BrianShannon123> @driveEV @ElecVehicleGuy Definitely. A premium brand shouldn't let itself fall behind.

891934584232955904 2017-07-31 08:12:30 UTC <BrianShannon123> @Groupe_Renault @RenaultZE @RenaultZoeClub @The_PlugSeeker Definitely a PITA. I wanted to charge near a rapid I BCI'd on (Boucher Rd). Was told the only person with the card was on holiday. Nonsense
891796047302938624 2017-07-30 23:02:01 UTC <BrianShannon123> @Lukafoto If Riversimple is better at 100+ miles of range and solid state batteries double energy density, will that make BEV's better at 200 miles?

889225645242421248 2017-07-23 20:48:09 UTC <BrianShannon123> @BBCNewsNI @dermot_curran The article states the ban is being lifted due to lack of evidence. Did you read it or just go straight to anti LGBT rant? #GetALife
889170024862289921 2017-07-23 17:07:08 UTC <BrianShannon123> @BBCNewsNI @dermot_curran That assumes the ban was created without prejudice and that doesn't appear to be the case.

888413807349030912 2017-07-21 15:02:12 UTC <BrianShannon123> I can be critical of EV's but the @whatcar  long term Zoe review is just anti EV drivel. I refuse to even link to it.

888397770138284036 2017-07-21 13:58:28 UTC <BrianShannon123> @Pavegen @FastCompany @driveEV That depends. In NI, streetlights are typically along the buildings/fences rather than along the kerb which isn't ideal for pedestrians.
887812744652574724 2017-07-19 23:13:47 UTC <BrianShannon123> @pluginadventure @otleyshev68 I'm honestly getting a bit bored with these tidbits. I want confirmed EPA range and charging rate. The rest is gimmicky by comparison.

887249965688422400 2017-07-18 09:57:30 UTC <BrianShannon123> @ESBGroup A quick search indicates it's possible that there's an earthing issue at the charge point that only the Zoe detectshttp://myrenaultzoe.com/index.php/topic/zoe-check-charging-post/
887248647242567681 2017-07-18 09:52:16 UTC <BrianShannon123> @ESBGroup Yes but currently the only cars that charge at 22kW are Teslas which would use the DC cable and Zoes that might not be able to charge here.
887073153494773762 2017-07-17 22:14:55 UTC <BrianShannon123> @OLEVgovuk @NicLutsey I doubt non EV manufacturers can ramp up EV production so quickly and there's the (rather important) Supercharging network to consider.

886982466048864256 2017-07-17 16:14:33 UTC <BrianShannon123> @ESBGroup Does your system measure the power delivered to each make/model of car? It states the charge is finished without delivering power.pic.twitter.com/qAPzhhXXw3
886910675318165506 2017-07-17 11:29:17 UTC <BrianShannon123> @hellolanemoore @TheLadyLycan Sure but that has nothing to do with believing the Doctor as a character suits a female actor.

886675313182289920 2017-07-16 19:54:02 UTC <BrianShannon123> @nievowners I've seen 3 of these in NI. Good to see but I'll be more excited when they're all electric.
886154126714957824 2017-07-15 09:23:02 UTC <BrianShannon123> @nievowners Plus the lack of redundancy and reliability is a serious problem already. This week I hit two out of service and one malfunctioning.
886151869797629952 2017-07-15 09:14:04 UTC <BrianShannon123> @nievowners I'm concerned that charge points I rely on will be moved, near my home or work, or along routes that are only feasible with these CP's.

882510267837554688 2017-07-05 08:03:38 UTC <BrianShannon123> @theLowCVP @Shell @OLEVgovuk @Lukafoto Sure but they use the established infrastructure, get people used to motors and plugging in, eliminate range anxiety and reduce fuel usage.
882366959584718850 2017-07-04 22:34:11 UTC <BrianShannon123> @fionabelfast I'm the first person to say EV's are (currently) expensive but this is still a real shame. Hopefully the costs come down before next time.

881870457548439553 2017-07-03 13:41:16 UTC <BrianShannon123> @theLowCVP @Shell @OLEVgovuk @Lukafoto They've built a tiny H2 vehicle that can barely take a payload and compared it to past or current EV's even though weight is dropping fast.

881778809120456704 2017-07-03 07:37:05 UTC <BrianShannon123> @theLowCVP @Shell @OLEVgovuk @Lukafoto I can put 250kg in my car without getting only 1/3 of the range. That's good enough evidence for me.

881462148483952640 2017-07-02 10:38:47 UTC <BrianShannon123> @theLowCVP @Shell @OLEVgovuk @Lukafoto The weight of EV's may be reduced w/ solid state batteries shortly due to 3x energy density and (low power) fuel cells exist w/o rare metals
881461013098483712 2017-07-02 10:34:16 UTC <BrianShannon123> @theLowCVP @Shell @OLEVgovuk @Lukafoto Yes but we're concerned with whether the loses by using H2 are offset by the reduction in weight and that doesn't appear to be the case.

880764128377413632 2017-06-30 12:25:06 UTC <BrianShannon123> @theLowCVP @Shell @OLEVgovuk @Lukafoto True but I believe the battery represents the bulk of increases in both cost and weight.
880736988307083264 2017-06-30 10:37:15 UTC <BrianShannon123> @theLowCVP @Shell @OLEVgovuk @Lukafoto Keeping small battery (22kWh?) 90% of the time and swapping in large battery (60kWh+) for longer trips mitigates weight loses

880708860197167107 2017-06-30 08:45:29 UTC <BrianShannon123> @theLowCVP @Shell @OLEVgovuk @Lukafoto This definitely needs to be resolved but I don't see H2 being a solution.
880707470343229440 2017-06-30 08:39:58 UTC <BrianShannon123> @theLowCVP @Shell @OLEVgovuk @Lukafoto True. Electric cars with rapid charging will come first. Some will hopefully have battery swapping option. Then infrastructure can improve.
880706655758974976 2017-06-30 08:36:44 UTC <BrianShannon123> @theLowCVP @Shell @OLEVgovuk @Lukafoto I'm aware of those attempts. I disagree that it's impractical but definitely in low demand and therefore unprofitable at the moment.

880704886186356736 2017-06-30 08:29:42 UTC <BrianShannon123> @theLowCVP @Shell @OLEVgovuk @Lukafoto Long charges of (swapped) batteries makes the most sense, I agree.
880704199499149317 2017-06-30 08:26:58 UTC <BrianShannon123> @theLowCVP @Shell @OLEVgovuk @Lukafoto A plug in H2 car with 100+ miles of all electric range and no rare metals is ok but pricey and battery swapping solves the problem better.

880699317069238273 2017-06-30 08:07:34 UTC <BrianShannon123> @theLowCVP @Shell @OLEVgovuk @Lukafoto Yes, and it still doesn't make up the difference. Where do fuel cells come from? They don't grow on trees.

877572180585967620 2017-06-21 17:01:27 UTC <BrianShannon123> @OLEVgovuk @cgiAlexis That's a possibility but that won't sway anyone's view of EV's in the meantime if they see people recharging for 4h at a fuel station.
877565394399232000 2017-06-21 16:34:29 UTC <BrianShannon123> @OLEVgovuk @cgiAlexis If it's anything less than 43kW AC and 50kW DC it's nearly a waste of time. As it's been said before, who wants to stay at a fuel station?
877553030048206848 2017-06-21 15:45:21 UTC <BrianShannon123> @OLEVgovuk @dsl4life It may be because certain climate change denying NI representatives suddenly have some leverage and this would be an easy win. Who knows.

864171028909629440 2017-05-15 17:30:03 UTC <BrianShannon123> @Fuel_Included @driveEV In this 15k analysis, savings from parking are 81.33 and the total monthly saving of the EV is 83.36. That's representative?
864167199581319168 2017-05-15 17:14:50 UTC <BrianShannon123> @Fuel_Included @driveEV An ICE is cheaper. At 15k miles, cheaper petrol, home electric costs and parking fees more than make up the difference. This is dishonest.
864159370929733633 2017-05-15 16:43:43 UTC <BrianShannon123> @driveEV @Fuel_Included Biased analysis. Try 4500 miles, petrol at current prices (112.9p/L), equal parking costs, increased cost of home electric on economy 7 plan
863826936124067844 2017-05-14 18:42:45 UTC <BrianShannon123> Problem: Expensive, heavy BEV's that can't do long journeys without long charging times. Solution: Small batteries, add capacity as needed.
863812514336956418 2017-05-14 17:45:26 UTC <BrianShannon123> We need BEV's sold with a 22kWh+ battery with tech to add/swap hired 22kWh+ auxiliary batteries on our routes. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PXf8E0gsPPc54DrMDMPM11tyNGGiTZMDizG5cO7RNB0/edit?usp=drivesdk
863675211673198592 2017-05-14 08:39:51 UTC <BrianShannon123> @RenaultZE @RenaultZoeClub @kevinb3510 AFAIK to protect the 26kWh battery, discharging under 2kWh/charging above 24kWh isn't possible. Does anyone know if 2kWh can be unlocked?
863501975324942336 2017-05-13 21:11:28 UTC <BrianShannon123> @RenaultZE @RenaultZoeClub @kevinb3510 Very close but strictly speaking 100 miles / 22kWh = 4.545 miles / kWh so at 4.4 miles / kWh you're just shy. Good luck for your next run!
862718711500869634 2017-05-11 17:19:04 UTC <BrianShannon123> @OLEVgovuk @nievowners I found the same. No progress at work after 3 months. Limited interest due to no benefits, little demand, cost and giving away electric.
862197109524754432 2017-05-09 06:46:24 UTC <BrianShannon123> @nievowners @ESBGroup @melectriccar Why putting en route CP's near supermarkets is a bad idea. CP locations need to be geared towards short stops - motorway service stations

859712396784435200 2017-05-03 10:13:02 UTC <BrianShannon123> @nievowners @plugincarguy I do feel like this is an especially silly thing to say after Renault announced battery upgrades to 120+ mile versions. EV's aren't fragile
859504402704588807 2017-05-02 20:26:33 UTC <BrianShannon123> Interesting remark: My dealer doesn't think Zoes are designed to handle 100 mile round trips with destination charging. Agree? @nievowners
859480221631877122 2017-05-02 18:50:27 UTC <BrianShannon123> Couldn't do it. I <3 my EV. Gave dealer another chance to fix it. They paid the insurance admin fee and said they'd stand by the car.
859409818297270273 2017-05-02 14:10:42 UTC <BrianShannon123> @markcjclemence My experience does show there's a lot to be desired in terms of EV readiness but it's the maths that shows it's not cheap enough - yet
859363934750605312 2017-05-02 11:08:22 UTC <BrianShannon123> @markcjclemence These are annual lease costs for the battery for the given mileage, not monthly costs for the car.
859348722534297602 2017-05-02 10:07:56 UTC <BrianShannon123> @markcjclemence I'm paying high lease costs? I bought an ex-demo Zoe and I'd buy an old ICE outright. My last ICE was 400 and I regret selling it
859339642214260736 2017-05-02 09:31:51 UTC <BrianShannon123> @markcjclemence 22kWh Zoe 4500 miles, 588. 41kWh Zoe, 708. 10 yr old diesel, 55 mpg, 114.9p/L, 427.37. 1000's cheaper to buy too.
859334844630929408 2017-05-02 09:12:47 UTC <BrianShannon123> @markcjclemence You're leasing a BMW. I can't afford to save that much on fossil fuel. My battery hire alone costs more than diesel.
859330230921678848 2017-05-02 08:54:27 UTC <BrianShannon123> In work for an hour, been told EV's are impractical, expensive and to get a diesel. Can't even argue. Diesel is cheaper to run than mine

857683557258584064 2017-04-27 19:51:09 UTC <BrianShannon123> @AgainstSugarTax I think you've failed to understand the relationship between correlation & causation. This correlation is evidence but it's exceedingly weak
857615347180085252 2017-04-27 15:20:07 UTC <BrianShannon123> EU governments and *businesses* know it's in their interest for the EU to stay strong and that means taking a hard line on #Brexit.
856584059971141633 2017-04-24 19:02:09 UTC <BrianShannon123> @BBCNewsNI We do not pay 12B net to be part of the customs union. You might be confusing that with another union.

854350294871924737 2017-04-18 15:05:58 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy It gets worse. I asked the driver of the left car if he could move so I could charge and got a snarky comment about not owning the car park

854066523081777154 2017-04-17 20:18:21 UTC <BrianShannon123> @evchels @plugincarguy @markcjclemence That depends on the terms of the battery hire. The minimum for the 22kWh Renault Zoe is <4500 miles costing 49/month, more than 13p/mile
854060575139270671 2017-04-17 19:54:43 UTC <BrianShannon123> @oxfordteddy @riversimple Cable gullies and charging street lamps are available. Going dozens of miles out of your way for more expensive fuel is not more suitable.
854059523904090113 2017-04-17 19:50:32 UTC <BrianShannon123> @riversimple @dave_luscombe A generation away? 30 years? No. I believe most new vehicles will be electric in 10 years. The tech is already on the market.
853986414589095936 2017-04-17 15:00:02 UTC <BrianShannon123> @ivebeeniced You'd have trouble charging in Newcastle today. Message me if stuck.pic.twitter.com/81LjafnMiy
853985796390612993 2017-04-17 14:57:34 UTC <BrianShannon123> @riversimple @dave_luscombe On top of that, the chicken and egg problem is worse for hydrogen. The infrastructure is much more expensive and you'd travel far to refuel.
853984680286314496 2017-04-17 14:53:08 UTC <BrianShannon123> @riversimple @dave_luscombe Have you checked for charge points in your area? Check out Zap Map. If you have off street parking you can charge at home too.
853767987853238275 2017-04-16 00:32:05 UTC <BrianShannon123> @riversimple @dave_luscombe As BEV's become more popular it won't.
853703197038346241 2017-04-16 20:14:37 UTC <BrianShannon123> @riversimple @dave_luscombe That's not the way BEV's are intended to work. You're supposed to charge while you sleep, work, eat, etc. You don't wait.

853616603992346624 2017-04-16 14:30:32 UTC <BrianShannon123> @OLEVgovuk @riversimple A petrol refuels as fast for less and with better infrastructure. Better, you can start every day with 300 mile range in a BEV for less

852887374090711040 2017-04-14 14:12:50 UTC <BrianShannon123> @Noa10Dana I think probably not. Most murders committed by Christians aren't religiously motivated, for example, and I say that as an atheist.

845234501483683849 2017-03-24 11:23:03 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy @markcjclemence In this case it was a forced stop in a park and ride with no services. I feel like those are misplaced.

845225578739515392 2017-03-24 10:47:36 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy There's a mixed experience. I've spoken to a Leaf owner and a Zoe owner, neither would buy again. The i3 rex guy seemed happy.

845221923667742721 2017-03-24 10:33:04 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy This is why I can't recommend BEV until range >200 and en route charging speeds hit 25mile/5min. We're getting close.
845216909549359104 2017-03-24 10:13:09 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy There's no personal reason they should buy an EV and rent for long distances when they can just buy one car for both.
845213248743976960 2017-03-24 09:58:36 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy People aren't willing to sacrifice the *option* of taking longer journeys without long charge times. That's what you don't get
845208576918540288 2017-03-24 09:40:02 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy Obviously that only applies if they have a long commute. I'd say most just want to exceed their needs by a comfortable margin
844916869605871616 2017-03-23 14:20:54 UTC <BrianShannon123> @leo_bruka You should check out the No True Scotsman fallacy.
844916579334807552 2017-03-23 14:19:44 UTC <BrianShannon123> @TelegraphNews @leo_bruka @Bishocon95 Yes but usually you would say Middle Eastern, not Asian, in that case.
844888023615655940 2017-03-23 12:26:16 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy @takerhandy @melectriccar Couldn't agree more.
844886459907801089 2017-03-23 12:20:03 UTC <BrianShannon123> @nievowners I'd go for a third option, "no home charging", as I don't have off street parking. I'd switch to economy if I charged at home
844683471981330432 2017-03-22 22:53:27 UTC <BrianShannon123> @leo_bruka Just looked it up. Apparently Islam is the biggest religion in Asia. You learn something new...
844682011117834248 2017-03-22 22:47:39 UTC <BrianShannon123> @leo_bruka Was the attacker Muslim? I imagine that's unlikely given the Asian ethnicity?http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/22/westminster-terror-attack-everything-know-far/
844680217515962368 2017-03-22 22:40:31 UTC <BrianShannon123> @SouthLoneStar #BanIslam is the least American hashtag you could use. Do you even know why?
844515972719558660 2017-03-22 11:47:52 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy But to be clear, there is definitely a line where I will get rid of the car for economic reasons.
844515238233944065 2017-03-22 11:44:57 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy No I couldn't economically justify getting the car and I knew it. I also spent about 5000 more than I usually do on a car.
844508681534410752 2017-03-22 11:18:54 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy I own outright. That is only the cost of my battery hire for my 22kWh Zoe. It's about the cost of fuel with a small engine
844507790282510336 2017-03-22 11:15:22 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy Thinking about this, with my Zoe that's ~15.6p/mile without considering anything else including membership and battery hire
844125288393048065 2017-03-21 09:55:26 UTC <BrianShannon123> @nievowners @RolecEV My company won't be buying any Rolec CP.
844116141412945920 2017-03-21 09:19:05 UTC <BrianShannon123> @HurstRenault @EVrenaultzoeni I BCI'd near Hurst on Boucher rd yesterday. They wouldn't let me use their public CP. Waited half an hour too
844103289587322880 2017-03-21 08:28:01 UTC <BrianShannon123> @ESBGroup @nievowners I need an update on this too please. This CP makes my longest trip possible.
841753519900225536 2017-03-14 20:50:52 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy I don't agree. My battery hire is itself 10.5p/mile. That's not "very low." That's if you *never* take unusual journeys.
841739404481826821 2017-03-14 19:54:47 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy Trips around GB from people in GB isn't and I expect the problem here. However I personally do take those trips.
841417280332402688 2017-03-13 22:34:47 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy For now IE & NI are fine (changing?) but trips to GB & FR seem to require annual memberships with several brands.
841277597388570624 2017-03-13 13:19:44 UTC <BrianShannon123> @dsl4life Yes I contacted my local council who put me in touch with the ecar project manager. The gist was it was still too expensive
841266471435173888 2017-03-13 12:35:31 UTC <BrianShannon123> @dsl4life On street residential charge points. I was told there wasn't enough demand in any one area to use this scheme in NI.
841264385272238080 2017-03-13 12:27:14 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy I can charge near my work but I drive more Fri-Sun. IMO EV's can't yet be said to be cheap to run given battery hire + cards
841234892365127680 2017-03-13 10:30:02 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy ~60-70%. I use rapids to have charge the next morning and towards the end of my longer trips.
841226665242042370 2017-03-13 09:57:20 UTC <BrianShannon123> @OLEVgovuk @energyUlster @EVrenaultzoeni @brheading @melectriccar @nievowners @dsl4life @plugincarguy I was rejected due to lack of demand.
841183845105979392 2017-03-13 07:07:11 UTC <BrianShannon123> @plugincarguy I exclusively use public chargers as I have no choice. I use both rapid and on street on a regular basis.
841035143263453184 2017-03-12 21:16:18 UTC <BrianShannon123> @ESBGroup @plugincarguy To keep my EV I need on street residential charging before this happens or slow charging at home charging prices.
829991535009726465 2017-02-10 09:52:57 UTC <BrianShannon123> @CNNweather @SkaggsRaskaggs1 What are your qualifications? Why do you believe climate scientists haven't thought of this possibility?
828564737793392640 2017-02-06 11:23:22 UTC <BrianShannon123> @BigIssue @Ali_Schofield @AnimalAid I would advise against demonizing the public and having a defeatist attitude if u want change
827506733446725632 2017-02-03 13:19:14 UTC <BrianShannon123> @VP @POTUS @PressSec @FoxNews If anything Trump will walk over the bodies of peaceful Muslims enough to create more radicals
827099538846515200 2017-02-02 10:21:11 UTC <BrianShannon123> @missgemcollins @PETAUK I don't know where you are but 75% of people aged 65-74 are overweight here.http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c3585
826568745602650113 2017-01-31 23:12:00 UTC <BrianShannon123> @sainsburys @Social_Jamie I'd like to express my gratitude for what options there are and no doubt will be. Thanks Daryl
826520429913309186 2017-01-31 20:00:01 UTC <BrianShannon123> @stormontweets @Asitseemstome With only 3% of UK voters in NI it's hard to argue otherwise. The DUP even put Brexit ads in England
826515986262138880 2017-01-31 19:42:21 UTC <BrianShannon123> @LibDemPress @Rob_Merrick @Kimila111 That's intellectual laziness. You still have information and you can have an informed opinion.
826515289558962178 2017-01-31 19:39:35 UTC <BrianShannon123> @Rob_Merrick @g_bigcon97 You are in the minority for young people. Every age group up to and including 35-44 voted to remain.
825451361747734531 2017-01-28 21:11:55 UTC <BrianShannon123> @FinancialTimes @FT @SteveCasada I'm British in Northern Ireland. Does that mean I shoot the Irish? Should I be banned from ROI?
825437726124171264 2017-01-28 20:17:44 UTC <BrianShannon123> @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn @labourpress @mwengway 25% support the US ban on Muslim immigration as of Dec 2015https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/12/09/brits-oppose-muslim-policy-pockets-approval/
824878017658789889 2017-01-26 07:13:39 UTC <BrianShannon123> @SkyNewsTonight @Kimila111 Trump has the ex CEO of an oil company as head of the EPA. That's just one. Chances have been given and lost.
824875900009226240 2017-01-26 07:05:14 UTC <BrianShannon123> @SkyNewsTonight For now Britain has veto powers over that decision and has always been opposed to it. That will soon change.
823977865758834689 2017-01-24 19:36:46 UTC <BrianShannon123> @PETAUK It's been a while but I believe the naan at Wetherspoons contains dairy. Order without it though!
