808953407168020480 2016-12-14 08:34:56 UTC <Selfvertroue91> actually I think this cartoon is hilarious and funny.
808952156745297920 2016-12-14 08:29:58 UTC <Selfvertroue91> I will research this subject and contact you within 48 working days.
808949993608540160 2016-12-14 08:21:22 UTC <Selfvertroue91> maybe you should contact all British people abroad who claim benefits and tell them you think they are 'drain'?
808949681803984896 2016-12-14 08:20:08 UTC <Selfvertroue91> no, not at all. Why would you call a single mother a drain?
808948263403581440 2016-12-14 08:14:30 UTC <Selfvertroue91> wow is for being surprised by the scale of this. Don't think anyone shld be judged harshly for claiming benefits if they need.
808946998929920000 2016-12-14 08:09:28 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @UKIP @BoruPatrick is this not how Boris described Brexit?
808946636525277184 2016-12-14 08:08:02 UTC <Selfvertroue91> absolutely, unless you are under some agreement.
808944623146123264 2016-12-14 08:00:02 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @SE25A not very revolutionary really, is it?
808944090859638784 2016-12-13 07:57:55 UTC <Selfvertroue91> I think it proves that if you want to control or restrict something you need to consider that it will work both ways. You?
808943476855422976 2016-12-13 07:55:28 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @markcarline44 yes, true. You can't really blame someone for the lack of specific knowledge, they have been brainwashed.
808943231933288448 2016-12-13 07:54:30 UTC <Selfvertroue91> so this is true, what Nigel Fromage said about you guys?
808942629706670080 2016-12-13 07:52:07 UTC <Selfvertroue91> I would say that they probably lack of motivation too. And I don't blame them. No one is keen on economic suicide.https://twitter.com/instituteforgov/status/808929685749006336

777654125081296896 2016-09-18 23:42:46 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @pleaseletmevote whole Leave campaign was built on the fear of terrorism, immigration, criminals, etc Wake up!
777653851885342721 2016-09-18 23:41:41 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb that's strange, I remember showing my passport at the airport last time, but never mind.

777650323196407808 2016-09-18 23:27:39 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb it says "instead"
777650144510668800 2016-09-18 23:26:57 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb very very small? tiny cost of Brexit? Like 10?

777649534570725377 2016-09-18 23:24:31 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb don't worry Nick, I lost too twice today...

777648806599032832 2016-09-18 23:21:38 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @pleaseletmevote only hate crime, better than repatriation. Especially killing for speaking foreign languages

777647595304943617 2016-09-18 23:16:49 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb @juliancik EU will be even more to blame now. When ee see that cooperation changes to competition
777647239321780224 2016-09-18 23:15:24 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb British are all immigrants, did you know?
777647049068150784 2016-09-18 23:14:39 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 great plan and strategy described in three words "we just leave". Masterpiece!
777646762509172736 2016-09-18 23:13:30 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb apparently brexit will be more expensive than contributing to EU, so let's borrow more?
777646347545612288 2016-09-18 23:11:51 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb .... Equality, standard of life etc

777645979235454978 2016-09-18 23:10:24 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @Essexdb @juliancik @NickStevenson63 nope  not even one crime. Never heard of.
777645776231133184 2016-09-18 23:09:35 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @pleaseletmevote hate crime up, extreme right wing xenophobic propaganda won, sad times. Very bad for the global image.
777645394910179328 2016-09-18 23:08:04 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb that's true, they did. EU is a guarantee of peace.
777645083864731648 2016-09-18 23:06:50 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @MasterofOrion @Essexdb congratulations, well done!

777644615562387456 2016-09-18 23:04:58 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb again? Shit! That's 2 times today.

777643943647404033 2016-09-18 23:02:18 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 for example the schedule, when?
777643835484758017 2016-09-18 23:01:52 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @NickStevenson63 @juliancik @Essexdb absolutely stupid, and childish
777643723849101312 2016-09-18 23:01:26 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 I wonder how Welsh farmers will take control when EU funding ends?
777643481149956096 2016-09-18 23:00:28 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb of course, especially North Korea. Also Mars is quite good and Narnia too.
777643296051134464 2016-09-18 22:59:44 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 @juliancik only EU citizens are criminals, that's obvious.
777643130908766208 2016-09-18 22:59:04 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 except that it is a biggest illusion ever. You don't even know what is the plan.
777642838909657088 2016-09-18 22:57:55 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb who?
777642716637331456 2016-09-18 22:57:26 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb fantastic! Do we know the date when it will be better than now?
777642438445916161 2016-09-18 22:56:19 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb so it won't be better than within EU?
777641738529824769 2016-09-18 22:53:33 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb but after we Brexit we'll get everything better than EU right? Even the weather.
777639373781233664 2016-09-18 22:44:09 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 @juliancik I don't. I choose valuable sources of information and good quality media.

777569004693123073 2016-09-18 18:04:31 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @Far_Right_Watch @SexyUkip it's quite obvious that these immigrants eat most of our food. They spend all benefits on our food!
777567419560787969 2016-09-18 17:58:13 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @Far_Right_Watch @SexyUkip farmers should not need more money, when we stop all immigration we won't need that much food anyway #Brexit
777566897856471041 2016-09-18 17:56:09 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @LSEpoliticsblog but.. but... They are stealing our jobs while claiming benefits!
777566086321606656 2016-09-18 17:52:56 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @semperfidem2004 I do not know. Ask them, I don't speak with them.
777555303340642305 2016-09-18 17:10:05 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @steviweavi @NickStevenson63 especially interesting in relation to the Government Administration.

777149175192494080 2016-09-17 14:16:16 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @mycountryeurope that will obviously help with the negotiations.

769188075352236033 2016-08-26 15:01:42 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @FergusMason1 @pmg_motors it's misleading to say that unelected bureaucrats make decisions in EU. Google it.

769182941033406464 2016-08-26 14:41:18 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @dailyagendauk @CallumJCParr That is correct!

808953407168020480 2016-12-14 08:34:56 UTC <Selfvertroue91> actually I think this cartoon is hilarious and funny.
808952156745297920 2016-12-14 08:29:58 UTC <Selfvertroue91> I will research this subject and contact you within 48 working days.
808949993608540160 2016-12-14 08:21:22 UTC <Selfvertroue91> maybe you should contact all British people abroad who claim benefits and tell them you think they are 'drain'?
808949681803984896 2016-12-14 08:20:08 UTC <Selfvertroue91> no, not at all. Why would you call a single mother a drain?
808948263403581440 2016-12-14 08:14:30 UTC <Selfvertroue91> wow is for being surprised by the scale of this. Don't think anyone shld be judged harshly for claiming benefits if they need.

808946636525277184 2016-12-14 08:08:02 UTC <Selfvertroue91> absolutely, unless you are under some agreement.
808944623146123264 2016-12-14 08:00:02 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @SE25A not very revolutionary really, is it?
808944090859638784 2016-12-13 07:57:55 UTC <Selfvertroue91> I think it proves that if you want to control or restrict something you need to consider that it will work both ways. You?
808943476855422976 2016-12-13 07:55:28 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @markcarline44 yes, true. You can't really blame someone for the lack of specific knowledge, they have been brainwashed.
808943231933288448 2016-12-13 07:54:30 UTC <Selfvertroue91> so this is true, what Nigel Fromage said about you guys?
808942629706670080 2016-12-13 07:52:07 UTC <Selfvertroue91> I would say that they probably lack of motivation too. And I don't blame them. No one is keen on economic suicide.https://twitter.com/instituteforgov/status/808929685749006336

777675975635197952 2016-09-18 01:09:35 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb we could build a huge maze and they would get lost inside.
777675447119339525 2016-09-18 01:07:29 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb maybe we should meanwhile quickly go to their countries?
777674692207542276 2016-09-18 01:04:29 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb so that's 570m coming here and living and most of them criminals?
777674113871675392 2016-09-18 01:02:11 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @joeblogsnews @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 it's not easy, all these diplomatic relationships...
777673925073465344 2016-09-18 01:01:26 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb and 70m Turkish people, don't forget

777673189623201792 2016-09-18 00:58:31 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb Britain? Are you sure??
777672138207666177 2016-09-18 00:54:20 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 no, it's the official numbers!
777671934926589952 2016-09-18 00:53:32 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 and you are projecting brexit on what? 
777671749148282880 2016-09-18 00:52:48 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb coming here? You mean tourists? Yeah, big problem. Always ask me where is what...
777671503949291520 2016-09-18 00:51:49 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 apparently they are very profitable - paying more into the budget than cost.
777671150059085825 2016-09-18 00:50:25 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 And this is the beauty of it! Especially for students and young people!

777667494576259072 2016-09-18 00:35:53 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb tell her. I think she is powerful and Charles is top Londoner.
777667254892855296 2016-09-18 00:34:56 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb I have better example: you won't see even 50 pence of it.

777666720974635008 2016-09-18 00:32:49 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb not exactly. It is now, not after Brexit is implemented.

777665668393103360 2016-09-18 00:28:38 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 and?
777665246987186176 2016-09-18 00:26:57 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 "Let's fund our NHS for example"
777665031156666368 2016-09-18 00:26:06 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 of course I remember that PM is Remainer. That's why Brexit won't happen ;)

777663339782701056 2016-09-18 00:19:23 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 exactly as every Scottish person can come and live in London for example.
777662523285864448 2016-09-18 00:16:08 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb yes she has! get over it! Besides it's disrespectful to say that.
777662143365836801 2016-09-18 00:14:37 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @MasterofOrion @Essexdb this is actually how your country works. Do you pay taxes?

777660623731691525 2016-09-18 00:08:35 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 Rod, we should ask them to return the money back! I think Brexit could be getting our money back

777659721629200386 2016-09-18 00:05:00 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb I think you should join Liam Fox and Davies because you seem passionate about it.
777659539969675265 2016-09-18 00:04:17 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 yes, she is German. And she is controlling you.
777659313280155649 2016-09-18 00:03:23 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @pleaseletmevote @MasterofOrion of course, especially for some selected people. Like the ones who will know what will happn
777658919883776000 2016-09-18 00:01:49 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @joeblogsnews @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb you mean WE as EU, we have started conflict in Ukraine?

777658574621253632 2016-09-18 00:00:27 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 but the cuts were already announced, did you miss it?
777658155849412608 2016-09-18 23:58:47 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb by the way? Are you going to actually help deliver it? I mean professionally.

777654967637278720 2016-09-18 23:46:07 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @pleaseletmevote we need a source. Amount of Hate crimes reported per X of population on the monthly basis
777654724921331712 2016-09-18 23:45:09 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @pleaseletmevote Brexit is isolation

777654125081296896 2016-09-18 23:42:46 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @pleaseletmevote whole Leave campaign was built on the fear of terrorism, immigration, criminals, etc Wake up!
777653851885342721 2016-09-18 23:41:41 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb that's strange, I remember showing my passport at the airport last time, but never mind.
777653589611257856 2016-09-18 23:40:38 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb that is terrible vision Dan!

777650722343124994 2016-09-18 23:29:14 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb can survive? It does not sound very ambitious...
777650490175782917 2016-09-18 23:28:19 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @pleaseletmevote you tell me? What is causing the frustration?
777650323196407808 2016-09-18 23:27:39 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb it says "instead"
777650144510668800 2016-09-18 23:26:57 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb very very small? tiny cost of Brexit? Like 10?
777649831103922178 2016-09-18 23:25:42 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 get over it!
777649698018656256 2016-09-18 23:25:10 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 I know how. To cover the costs of Brexit
777649534570725377 2016-09-18 23:24:31 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb don't worry Nick, I lost too twice today...

777648806599032832 2016-09-18 23:21:38 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @pleaseletmevote only hate crime, better than repatriation. Especially killing for speaking foreign languages
777648532740272128 2016-09-18 23:20:32 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb in your garden

777647595304943617 2016-09-18 23:16:49 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb @juliancik EU will be even more to blame now. When ee see that cooperation changes to competition
777647239321780224 2016-09-18 23:15:24 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb British are all immigrants, did you know?
777647049068150784 2016-09-18 23:14:39 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 great plan and strategy described in three words "we just leave". Masterpiece!
777646762509172736 2016-09-18 23:13:30 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb apparently brexit will be more expensive than contributing to EU, so let's borrow more?
777646347545612288 2016-09-18 23:11:51 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb .... Equality, standard of life etc

777645979235454978 2016-09-18 23:10:24 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @Essexdb @juliancik @NickStevenson63 nope  not even one crime. Never heard of.
777645776231133184 2016-09-18 23:09:35 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @pleaseletmevote hate crime up, extreme right wing xenophobic propaganda won, sad times. Very bad for the global image.
777645394910179328 2016-09-18 23:08:04 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb that's true, they did. EU is a guarantee of peace.
777645083864731648 2016-09-18 23:06:50 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @MasterofOrion @Essexdb congratulations, well done!
777644887294480386 2016-09-18 23:06:03 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 @essexdb @juliancik and now government will decide what to do with it? Like 350m for NHS? Ha ha ha
777644615562387456 2016-09-18 23:04:58 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb again? Shit! That's 2 times today.
777644461304184833 2016-09-18 23:04:22 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @Essexdb @essexdb @NickStevenson63 @juliancik of course, there are many happy places on Earth.
777644093178540032 2016-09-18 23:02:54 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 @MasterofOrion best plan ever. Brexit is Brexit!
777643943647404033 2016-09-18 23:02:18 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 for example the schedule, when?
777643835484758017 2016-09-18 23:01:52 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @NickStevenson63 @juliancik @Essexdb absolutely stupid, and childish
777643723849101312 2016-09-18 23:01:26 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 I wonder how Welsh farmers will take control when EU funding ends?
777643481149956096 2016-09-18 23:00:28 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb of course, especially North Korea. Also Mars is quite good and Narnia too.
777643296051134464 2016-09-18 22:59:44 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 @juliancik only EU citizens are criminals, that's obvious.
777643130908766208 2016-09-18 22:59:04 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 except that it is a biggest illusion ever. You don't even know what is the plan.

777642716637331456 2016-09-18 22:57:26 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb fantastic! Do we know the date when it will be better than now?
777642438445916161 2016-09-18 22:56:19 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb so it won't be better than within EU?
777641738529824769 2016-09-18 22:53:33 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @juliancik @NickStevenson63 @Essexdb but after we Brexit we'll get everything better than EU right? Even the weather.
777639373781233664 2016-09-18 22:44:09 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @Essexdb @NickStevenson63 @juliancik I don't. I choose valuable sources of information and good quality media.

777569004693123073 2016-09-18 18:04:31 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @Far_Right_Watch @SexyUkip it's quite obvious that these immigrants eat most of our food. They spend all benefits on our food!
777567419560787969 2016-09-18 17:58:13 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @Far_Right_Watch @SexyUkip farmers should not need more money, when we stop all immigration we won't need that much food anyway #Brexit
777566897856471041 2016-09-18 17:56:09 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @LSEpoliticsblog but.. but... They are stealing our jobs while claiming benefits!
777566086321606656 2016-09-18 17:52:56 UTC <Selfvertroue91> @semperfidem2004 I do not know. Ask them, I don't speak with them.
