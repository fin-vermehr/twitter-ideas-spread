957997263875342336 2018-01-29 15:22:01 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Not true, Donald. Your fake news.
952517497009397760 2018-01-14 12:27:22 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump Where is your tweet reassuring the people of Hawaii about the false missile strike report? Your priorities are totally out of whack.

943118176493109248 2017-12-19 13:57:50 UTC <KarenMuessig> @MSNBC @Morning_Joe @RepKevinBrady @WaysandMeansGOP Just saw your disrespectful, smirking and condescending performance on Morning Joe. You would be surprised to know how much of their viewership understands carried interest, and you should have addressed the issue instead of insulting us.

938931825065504769 2017-12-07 00:42:46 UTC <KarenMuessig> @DonaldJTrumpJr Can you get anything right, you dope? It's "Doggone it." And who are you to gloat over Franken's resignation. Impeachment for dad will be much worse.

901930417116381184 2017-08-27 22:12:23 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump @EdKrassen He lost the popular vote if you recall. Most Americans did not vote for him and we will not shut up or sit down. Get used to it.
901929762763014147 2017-08-27 22:09:47 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump Grow up - the election is over. So are your glory days.

888728319180627970 2017-07-22 11:51:57 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump Operative phrase - "so far." Your words.
888727963809796096 2017-07-22 11:50:32 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump That has been investigated. Now it's your turn under the microscope.

887764373917380608 2017-07-19 20:01:35 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump A completely nauseating message.
887763830088052737 2017-07-19 19:59:25 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump @Team_Trump45 That is in very bad taste. It conjures up very painful memories for many Americans. You should know better.

885135633341186048 2017-07-12 13:55:54 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump @adamcbest And his fat rear end is evidence of that.
885135204322553857 2017-07-12 13:54:12 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump @getongab That is s problem. They had better start watching and listening to the news which sadly is all too real.
885134833596456961 2017-07-12 13:52:43 UTC <KarenMuessig> @most @realDonaldTrump @Most people who work for a living are too busy to watch TV.
885134003715678209 2017-07-12 13:49:26 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump I have never in my life heard a President say they had little time to watch TV! It was assumed they didn't but thanks for letting us know.
885082715862728705 2017-07-12 10:25:38 UTC <KarenMuessig> @iraziggy So much fun! My blood pressure has gone down 20 points since I am able to vent.
884766248558632961 2017-07-11 13:28:06 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Every time one of their apologists uses the term 'nothing burger' I take a shot of Stoli.
884763019695226880 2017-07-11 13:15:16 UTC <KarenMuessig> @RawStory Copying daddy's idea. Can you think up anything in your own?
884762699439239168 2017-07-11 13:14:00 UTC <KarenMuessig> @DonnyTomlinson Are you living in an alternate universe Donny?
884756579052134401 2017-07-11 12:49:41 UTC <KarenMuessig> @DonaldJTrumpJr It's not done yet. Lots more to learn about what you were up to with your Russian pals.
884756099538325504 2017-07-11 12:47:46 UTC <KarenMuessig> @DonaldJTrumpJr You are so arrogant! Everything has been handed to you & you've accomplished nothing. You're out of your league. A real nothingburger.
884729666107568129 2017-07-11 11:02:44 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump Go back to sleep Donald. Give your tweeting fingers a rest.
884729354940542976 2017-07-11 11:01:30 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump The pot calling the kettle black!
884726807135735808 2017-07-11 10:51:22 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends What is Trump going to be doing in August - golf anyone?
884541596246708224 2017-07-10 22:35:25 UTC <KarenMuessig> @EricBoehlert @JoiseyJoh Mike not Matt
884472770213621760 2017-07-10 18:01:55 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump Is it beautiful to throw millions of Americans off healthcare? You are so out of touch. SAD.
884472211339345921 2017-07-10 17:59:42 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump Schizophrenic much?
884471813119586304 2017-07-10 17:58:07 UTC <KarenMuessig> @PGAngie1 Your 4 year old doesn't know any better but what's your excuse?
884470115357556739 2017-07-10 17:51:22 UTC <KarenMuessig> @seanhannity @Asheru You are quite delusional.
884467889562112001 2017-07-10 17:42:32 UTC <KarenMuessig> @peaceandjoy101 @BlaserJoan Envious of what? Really, I want to know.
884467646355451906 2017-07-10 17:41:34 UTC <KarenMuessig> @peaceandjoy101 @clivebushjd You are brainwashed apparently. Wake up.
884464514657382401 2017-07-10 17:29:07 UTC <KarenMuessig> @peaceandjoy101 The speech was good because it was written for him. What about the rest of the trip especially when he criticized the US on foreign soil?
884463512461955074 2017-07-10 17:25:08 UTC <KarenMuessig> Don't speak for me. I don't stand with him and can't stand him either. Lying SOS.
884388713232519168 2017-07-10 12:27:55 UTC <KarenMuessig> @nytimes Donnie Jr apparently learned from dad to double down when he lies. How's that working out for you, Junior?
884172106795298816 2017-07-09 22:07:12 UTC <KarenMuessig> @Reince45 @nytimes @CitizenSnap Super sized.
884171433227800577 2017-07-09 22:04:31 UTC <KarenMuessig> @nytimes @OshaDavidson @4everNeverTrump No, that's the expression.

884170180183633924 2017-07-09 21:59:32 UTC <KarenMuessig> @laurenduca @nytimes @sarahcpr Wake up!
884112259840192513 2017-07-09 18:09:23 UTC <KarenMuessig> @nytimes @newtgingrich Your profile should say Husband x 3 or just Husbands. Super Husband? Gift to Women?
884110629849759745 2017-07-09 18:02:54 UTC <KarenMuessig> @McFaul @iraziggy When we all start speaking Russian?
884109649796116481 2017-07-09 17:59:01 UTC <KarenMuessig> @nytimes @SecularSpicoli @valeriecalkins @KelleySuzanneW Probably more qualified even at 10.
884108801129013248 2017-07-09 17:55:38 UTC <KarenMuessig> @iraziggy @McFaul Gee, who could be more qualified than the President's daughter? Should we make a list?
884052350176038914 2017-07-09 14:11:19 UTC <KarenMuessig> @IGGYAZALEA @newsdistortion Iggy, takes no talent to show off your rear end.
884051374937432064 2017-07-09 14:07:27 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump In that case I'll guess you'll be a one-term President.
884050645279531009 2017-07-09 14:04:33 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump @NikLentz Yes, lock up Trump and his compatriots. He'll be thrilled to work on the wall!!
884050130286112768 2017-07-09 14:02:30 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump Stop trash-talking our country on the world stage!
884049805261107200 2017-07-09 14:01:13 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump Whose side are you on in this world, Donald? Stop trash-talking the USA and supporting Russia. This does not MAGA.
883993399837286400 2017-07-09 10:17:04 UTC <KarenMuessig> @News12NJ @todayitstops What about some gun regulations? Ever thought of that?
883993080533315585 2017-07-09 10:15:48 UTC <KarenMuessig> @News12NJ @SonsofReagan All these idiots parroting Trump's fake news phrase. Think for yourselves!!
883992692690227200 2017-07-09 10:14:16 UTC <KarenMuessig> @News12NJ @SonsofReagan They do keep statistics on how many Americans are killed by gunfire, but no one  wants to do anything about it.
883848235651149826 2017-07-08 00:40:15 UTC <KarenMuessig> @SenatorDole @realDonaldTrump Yeah, but who has his brain?
883847958109835269 2017-07-08 00:39:08 UTC <KarenMuessig> @SenatorDole @realDonaldTrump @NYCMAGA You must have low standards. One speech does not a President make.
883284868364455936 2017-07-07 11:21:37 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump Check out your news coverage around the world. Guess everyone is fake except you.
883284244033933312 2017-07-07 11:19:09 UTC <KarenMuessig> @GovChristie Then you should be investigating your role in it, Governor.
883283859126845444 2017-07-07 11:17:37 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump Pay attention to what you're supposed to accomplish today, Donald!
883283551487229952 2017-07-07 11:16:23 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump Yes, the speech writers provided a great speech for you to read.
883097240910401536 2017-07-06 22:56:04 UTC <KarenMuessig> @njdotcom What is his expertise? Dodging the truth, lolling about on the beach or licking 45s boots?
883066338113187840 2017-07-06 20:53:16 UTC <KarenMuessig> @THETRUMPBUREAU @McmortonMichael At least you're consistent.
883064617802530816 2017-07-06 20:46:26 UTC <KarenMuessig> @FLOTUS @VeeVee @Tseeker919 @uluvsaz @ggary59 @Itzaturbojet @DannyNick77 The other one hasn't been - yet. Give it some time.
883063715289018368 2017-07-06 20:42:50 UTC <KarenMuessig> @FLOTUS @VeeVee @Tseeker919 @ggary59 @uluvsaz @Itzaturbojet They don't need proof. They'll say anything like their idol.
883063313378226181 2017-07-06 20:41:15 UTC <KarenMuessig> @FLOTUS @VeeVee @Tseeker919 @ggary59 @Itzaturbojet @uluvsaz No, Trump just talks about molesting women. Hasn't gotten caught doing more.
883055790394945536 2017-07-06 20:11:21 UTC <KarenMuessig> @THETRUMPBUREAU @McmortonMichael Are you among the 'patriots' outraged when the Dixie Chicks criticized Bush on foreign soil? Trump supporters have selective memory.
883053456310898689 2017-07-06 20:02:04 UTC <KarenMuessig> @FLOTUS @VeeVee @Tseeker919 @ggary59 @Itzaturbojet @uluvsaz Right, Trump is only raping our country.
883053249070333952 2017-07-06 20:01:15 UTC <KarenMuessig> @FLOTUS @VeeVee @Tseeker919 @uluvsaz @ggary59 @Itzaturbojet Live in the present, not 20 years ago.
883052925576253441 2017-07-06 19:59:58 UTC <KarenMuessig> @FLOTUS @VeeVee @Tseeker919 That's an intelligent response.
883052535900246017 2017-07-06 19:58:25 UTC <KarenMuessig> @FLOTUS Hopefully Donald will learn some science from the experience there. Did they cover climate change by any chance?
882946034313383937 2017-07-06 12:55:13 UTC <KarenMuessig> @THETRUMPBUREAU Were you proud of Trump's attacks on our media, intelligence organizations and former President on foreign soil? Shameful and SAD!
882567683467870208 2017-07-05 11:51:47 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump @Pavox Stop being a Donald Trump parrot and educate yourself on how he is trying to screw you. Need healthcare much?
882309205172113408 2017-07-04 18:44:41 UTC <KarenMuessig> @BuzzFeed Christie said this would be a story if he was caught on the beach with a 25-year-old blonde. That's not a story-it's a fantasy.
881194195809169411 2017-07-01 16:54:02 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump @MarkDice Wow, aren't you clever?
881193522141028352 2017-07-01 16:51:22 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump @bdgrabinski Who has the rage issues?
881192133528612864 2017-07-01 16:45:51 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump @Mike_P_Williams @bilwil1963 Good luck with that!
881191767210635265 2017-07-01 16:44:23 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump I would test her IQ against yours any day. She is well-spoken while you can't string more than five words together to form a sentence.
881186771521986560 2017-07-01 16:24:32 UTC <KarenMuessig> @realDonaldTrump And what are your ratings, President Twitter, I mean Tweet. Approval ratings in the 30th percentile. Who are you to criticize their ratings?
