962395252844773377 2018-02-10 18:38:03 UTC <cassidyhall> @IPOSfilm @silencepodcast @artsyanthonym I think another great sentiment for silence is coming to it/encountering it with Shoshin/"beginner's mind" kind of stance...

962385588987940864 2018-02-10 17:59:39 UTC <cassidyhall> @IPOSfilm @silencepodcast @artsyanthonym I concur with your sentiment on selflessness as a better word choice than purity (which has been a word corrupted by my past experience with its use)
962381607775555584 2018-02-10 17:43:50 UTC <cassidyhall> @IPOSfilm @silencepodcast @artsyanthonym I don't think loving silence takes skill, but I do think it take attention and intention. Great question ... I wonder if this goes to purity of heart in some sense. Or purity of intention. What do you think?
961994038172790784 2018-02-09 16:03:46 UTC <cassidyhall> @IPOSfilm @silencepodcast @artsyanthonym And I might add that for me (!) negative silence (destructive, toxic, unkind) is a misuse of silence.

961989408596533248 2018-02-09 15:45:22 UTC <cassidyhall> @IPOSfilm @silencepodcast @artsyanthonym Agreed! As are translations. In this sense silence as peace or inactivity is as true as silence as destruction or violence as true as silence creativity and love... Certainly we focus more on the latter in the podcast!
961988208618717184 2018-02-09 15:40:36 UTC <cassidyhall> @IPOSfilm @silencepodcast @artsyanthonym Thanks! No, I think defining silence holds it back from its infinite, boundless, vastness ... (there I go defining it!) But I think were always grasping at metaphors for the unknown mysteries of life.
961987467632001024 2018-02-09 15:37:39 UTC <cassidyhall> @IPOSfilm @silencepodcast @artsyanthonym I love what you said language is always emotionally stitched. May I quote you? Also thanks for telling folks about the pc!
961985964070510592 2018-02-09 15:31:41 UTC <cassidyhall> @IPOSfilm @silencepodcast @artsyanthonym I think we agree, just host different definitions! One persons sound is another persons noise. And the pc frequently discuss negative silence - i.e. toxic silence, silence that holds us still in the midst of needing to stand up (example being issues related to social justice)
961979770513768448 2018-02-09 15:07:04 UTC <cassidyhall> @IPOSfilm @silencepodcast I might also add that sounds seem to become noise when they disturb, intrude, annoy, interrupt, or disrupt. Of course this all hangs on our individual interpretations of sound and noise
