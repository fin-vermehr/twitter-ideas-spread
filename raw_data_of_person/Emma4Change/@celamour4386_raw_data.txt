970313584461873152 2018-03-04 15:02:40 UTC <celamour4386> @theamazingdena I think you just need him to answer a few basic questions like, what year is it, and then flash the kitty laser to see how he responds to it.
968659137549697024 2018-02-27 01:28:29 UTC <celamour4386> @benjaminwittes @lawfarepodcast @CyMastersGirl Perhaps that reality star con artist would benefit from seeing a Euro-Russian eye doctor circa 1870.  Maybe we all would.  
968278330939269121 2018-02-26 00:15:18 UTC <celamour4386> @lawfarepodcast @benjaminwittes I couldn't agree more with your comment on 1870s euro-Russian opthamology being terrifying!!
