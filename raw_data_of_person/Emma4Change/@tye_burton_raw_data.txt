720660636120670208 2016-04-14 17:10:59 UTC <tye_burton> @DaAbsoluteBest we gotta pick between Julius & DLo because neither of them are gonna be superstars imo but only time will tell. One of
720660421699473408 2016-04-14 17:10:08 UTC <tye_burton> @DaAbsoluteBest yeah I definitely agree Clarkson shows more heart to me but he's definitely a shooting!!! guard lol I just honestly think
