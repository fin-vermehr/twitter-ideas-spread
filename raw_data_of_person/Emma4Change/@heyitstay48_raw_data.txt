Odell, she says, is so secure in his own self and how he views affection toward other men -

911589084535148544 2017-09-23 13:52:28 UTC <heyitstay48> @CCOT_MAGA @RebelYellUSA Anthem shouldn't matter because he's not getting paid to stand for the anthem. He's getting paid to play football

911576902892183552 2017-09-23 13:04:04 UTC <heyitstay48> @CCOT_MAGA @RebelYellUSA Doing a protest where no one can see you is pointless and doesn't solve anything or get any conversations started on the issue

911575047512510464 2017-09-23 12:56:42 UTC <heyitstay48> @TheMarkPantano So Colin is anti-brutal treatment of black people, and you say he's anti-American. So "American" = unfair treatment of black people? Got it
