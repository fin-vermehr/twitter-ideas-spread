But Mockingbird, while cut short, was a great series, but of course, they only complain when a woman writes something about a woman.

937498221496143873 2017-12-03 01:46:08 UTC <chocolatenebula> I finally got around to reading the Mockingbird comics. I really enjoyed them! I also scrolled down in the comics sections and it was just a bunch of men complaining that she had a feminist shirt and how a woman was writing it. (@ChelseaCain ) and they call women sensitive!

914804112138612736 2017-10-02 10:47:51 UTC <chocolatenebula> people are saying that there's already gun control laws here to prevent ownership of these guns, sure, but where is the gov to monitor it?

911665639756050432 2017-09-23 18:56:41 UTC <chocolatenebula> Those football players didn't do anything wrong. When you have a country that's against you, lead by a president who is also? #TakeAKnee.

779138923737993216 2016-09-22 02:02:49 UTC <chocolatenebula> Breakdown city here we come
779130837887426560 2016-09-22 01:30:41 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula this year it's the opposite, I feel lonely but I'd take an invitation out. Last year i'd just say no and stay miserable.
779130486203428864 2016-09-22 01:29:18 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula I think I'm digging myself the little hole I was in last year, which really sucks.
779129650882555904 2016-09-22 01:25:58 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula Like, I never see anyone outside of school. Not since my friend moved and people generally just stopped contacting me.
779129496062468097 2016-09-22 01:25:22 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula I mean, I have the worst feeling that I only have friends AT school, and I'm pretty sure it's true.
779129314251984896 2016-09-22 01:24:38 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula My chill days are usually me doing nothing. That's every weekend, and it doesn't get rid of the lingering school stress.
779128988362878976 2016-09-22 01:23:20 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula I guess I'm an introvert, so maybe people got so used to me denying invitations that they just stopped inviting me?
779128855067889666 2016-09-22 01:22:49 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula I'd like to have friends or even just a friend I regularly hang with. Preferably someone who can just sit with me and talk.
779128616974061568 2016-09-22 01:21:52 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula tbh I don't remember the last time I went out and had fun with friends over the weekend, it's always soccer games.
779128473784754176 2016-09-22 01:21:18 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula school is a lot. It's creeping up on me. My grades aren't horrible but there's also just the workload and social aspect.
779128359422795776 2016-09-22 01:20:51 UTC <chocolatenebula> I'm trying to stay calm on the surface, but I'm actually really stressed out.
778733054189670400 2016-09-21 23:10:02 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula probably will keep identifying as gay until things are completely figured out
778732955879378946 2016-09-21 23:09:39 UTC <chocolatenebula> I think there's a possibility that I may be bi ?? With a very VERY strong preference to females
778715916490067976 2016-09-21 22:01:56 UTC <chocolatenebula> Exactly, that's why I should be lovvEDDDhttps://twitter.com/goshsavannah/status/775865555328696320

778180873564880898 2016-09-20 10:35:52 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula and that's not even it. I //LOVE// to learn. I shouldn't have to dread going to a place of LEARNING.
778180696389148677 2016-09-20 10:35:10 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula kinda sucks that grades are put over my own mental health when it comes to importance.
778180515274817536 2016-09-20 10:34:27 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula So I guess that's even worse? I feel exhausted and there's no obvious reason why. I'm constantly worrying about my grades.
778180265902473216 2016-09-20 10:33:27 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula my parents are like "get a scholarship lol" but honestly, despite having okay looking grades, I know they'll slip.
778180135325462528 2016-09-20 10:32:56 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula and the worst part is that this isn't the only way I've felt like this. This kind of stress seems normal at Paxon.
778179785264594944 2016-09-20 10:31:33 UTC <chocolatenebula> so honestly I'm exhausted and haven't done half the homework I need to do   I embrace death w open arms now.

775114838473191425 2016-09-11 23:32:33 UTC <chocolatenebula> honestly I haven't started my homework at all, and I've had this whole weekend. I'll blame it on moving and stay up doing it.

951282402743156736 2018-01-10 02:39:33 UTC <chocolatenebula> so many parents claim they're okay with gay people until it's their child. it's honestly so disgusting. they act okay with it, create what seems like a safe environment, and then totally turn around when the personally face this reality.

937498504536182784 2017-12-03 01:47:16 UTC <chocolatenebula> God, honestly they won't complain about any awful comic writing by men. But Mockingbird, while cut short, was a great series, but of course, they only complain when a woman writes something about a woman.

937498221496143873 2017-12-03 01:46:08 UTC <chocolatenebula> I finally got around to reading the Mockingbird comics. I really enjoyed them! I also scrolled down in the comics sections and it was just a bunch of men complaining that she had a feminist shirt and how a woman was writing it. (@ChelseaCain ) and they call women sensitive!

780474221142999041 2016-09-26 18:28:49 UTC <chocolatenebula> I cant understand hate against liberals. We want people to love, we want women to have control of their own bodies. That's fair.

780259441732050944 2016-09-25 04:15:22 UTC <chocolatenebula> I know what you may be thinking. Why not sleep? That's the easiest thing ever! It's because school has robbed me of basic abilities.
780258795788173312 2016-09-25 04:12:48 UTC <chocolatenebula> I could be doing 1 of 2 important things... finishing my essay or sleeping. But.. hEAR ME OUT.. watch The Flash on netflix

780160408875372544 2016-09-25 21:41:50 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula It's like they don't realize that we have other work, and that the weekend is supposed to give us our much deserved break.
780160099578998784 2016-09-25 21:40:37 UTC <chocolatenebula> you know, it's really messed up for teachers to give us an essay with 0 context, with about 4 days to work on it.
780128636095569920 2016-09-25 19:35:35 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula my grades are dropping for homework that I do
780128345698689024 2016-09-25 19:34:26 UTC <chocolatenebula> Don't even start me on French. She grades our homework on accuracy, and I suck at the language.
780128021655199744 2016-09-25 19:33:09 UTC <chocolatenebula> My grades keep dropping. Due to being forgetful or not understanding the subject.
780098837394456576 2016-09-25 17:37:11 UTC <chocolatenebula> I can't stop shaking school is destroying me
780078364908462081 2016-09-25 16:15:50 UTC <chocolatenebula> I'm so gay for all female super heroes.
779399863993765888 2016-09-23 19:19:42 UTC <chocolatenebula> This one kid on the bus told me not to sit somewhere bc someone was saving it but it was empty so I said "i don't care." and sat down anyway
779138923737993216 2016-09-22 02:02:49 UTC <chocolatenebula> Breakdown city here we come
779130837887426560 2016-09-22 01:30:41 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula this year it's the opposite, I feel lonely but I'd take an invitation out. Last year i'd just say no and stay miserable.
779130486203428864 2016-09-22 01:29:18 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula I think I'm digging myself the little hole I was in last year, which really sucks.
779129650882555904 2016-09-22 01:25:58 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula Like, I never see anyone outside of school. Not since my friend moved and people generally just stopped contacting me.
779129496062468097 2016-09-22 01:25:22 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula I mean, I have the worst feeling that I only have friends AT school, and I'm pretty sure it's true.
779129314251984896 2016-09-22 01:24:38 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula My chill days are usually me doing nothing. That's every weekend, and it doesn't get rid of the lingering school stress.
779128988362878976 2016-09-22 01:23:20 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula I guess I'm an introvert, so maybe people got so used to me denying invitations that they just stopped inviting me?
779128855067889666 2016-09-22 01:22:49 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula I'd like to have friends or even just a friend I regularly hang with. Preferably someone who can just sit with me and talk.
779128616974061568 2016-09-22 01:21:52 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula tbh I don't remember the last time I went out and had fun with friends over the weekend, it's always soccer games.
779128473784754176 2016-09-22 01:21:18 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula school is a lot. It's creeping up on me. My grades aren't horrible but there's also just the workload and social aspect.
779128359422795776 2016-09-22 01:20:51 UTC <chocolatenebula> I'm trying to stay calm on the surface, but I'm actually really stressed out.
778733054189670400 2016-09-21 23:10:02 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula probably will keep identifying as gay until things are completely figured out
778732955879378946 2016-09-21 23:09:39 UTC <chocolatenebula> I think there's a possibility that I may be bi ?? With a very VERY strong preference to females
778715916490067976 2016-09-21 22:01:56 UTC <chocolatenebula> Exactly, that's why I should be lovvEDDDhttps://twitter.com/goshsavannah/status/775865555328696320

778180696389148677 2016-09-20 10:35:10 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula kinda sucks that grades are put over my own mental health when it comes to importance.
778180515274817536 2016-09-20 10:34:27 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula So I guess that's even worse? I feel exhausted and there's no obvious reason why. I'm constantly worrying about my grades.
778180265902473216 2016-09-20 10:33:27 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula my parents are like "get a scholarship lol" but honestly, despite having okay looking grades, I know they'll slip.
778180135325462528 2016-09-20 10:32:56 UTC <chocolatenebula> @chocolatenebula and the worst part is that this isn't the only way I've felt like this. This kind of stress seems normal at Paxon.
778179785264594944 2016-09-20 10:31:33 UTC <chocolatenebula> so honestly I'm exhausted and haven't done half the homework I need to do   I embrace death w open arms now.
