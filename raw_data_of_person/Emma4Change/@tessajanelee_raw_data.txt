952571372408135689 2018-01-14 16:01:27 UTC <tessajanelee> connection does not mean life long commitment! it means you are paying attention to the other person in that moment and you are able to change your expectations to suit reality! and probably have a way more fun time because of it!
952570758676525057 2018-01-14 15:59:01 UTC <tessajanelee> gEnUiNe: in the one hour ive been awake i have had more meaningful conversations about sex with my friends than ever people please understand there are two people in every sexual interaction and no one exists to fill anyones expectations of how they thought the night should go

948299046388629504 2018-01-02 21:04:45 UTC <tessajanelee> IMO: the crown does an amazing job at distinguishing which characters are criticized/damned for being truly corrupt/power hungry (duke of windsor, eaton) vs. those who are stuck in a bad position and foolishly choose bad decisions (phillip, queen mother eliz)
948295195937984519 2018-01-02 20:49:27 UTC <tessajanelee> just texted someone, dont be afraid to need me, which is the final piece of evidence that the new year does not change a person

910028817711849472 2017-09-18 06:32:32 UTC <tessajanelee> my favorite thing about small earthquakes in LA is that everyone needs IMMEDIATE confirmation that they didn't make it up
910028315406229505 2017-09-18 06:30:32 UTC <tessajanelee> if there's one thing i just learned from that earthquake it's that i should sleep with pants on

892108322006077441 2017-07-31 19:42:53 UTC <tessajanelee> thinking now: why does bad theatre discredit all theatre? no one tells a film buff that all movies are unappealing bc transformers exists
892091811937873920 2017-07-31 18:37:16 UTC <tessajanelee> i find that artists in other mediums are often unwilling to engage with/acknowledge theater so this claiming of sam shepard is fascinating
892091023505186817 2017-07-31 18:34:08 UTC <tessajanelee> cool to see today that people are finally admitting they have read a play before or at least are willing to pretend they have

827196014767521797 2017-02-02 16:44:33 UTC <tessajanelee> the way i am helping stop devos is texting my sister every day and saying "you can call your republican ohio senator again!"

825048741514186752 2017-01-27 18:32:03 UTC <tessajanelee> just officially entered another dimension of nonsense?? nothing like trump disavowing the holocaust when he is on his way to reviving it!https://twitter.com/StateDept/status/825048068215173120

823942211230433280 2017-01-24 17:15:05 UTC <tessajanelee> @tessajanelee so maybe we should think more about this notion of revenge politics than one scary evil man
823925546354503680 2017-01-24 16:08:52 UTC <tessajanelee> thinking about how despite the persona trump is making policy decisions that many republican presidents would

820862348630036480 2017-01-15 05:16:49 UTC <tessajanelee> @IanBouillion are you watching the oa no one has watched it is so good!!!
820859099248201728 2017-01-15 05:03:54 UTC <tessajanelee> when you're watching a movie but you don't know if it's horrible bosses 1 or horrible bosses 2

819967479883698178 2017-01-13 18:00:56 UTC <tessajanelee> special skills include draining phone battery in first hour and a half of being awake
819953434493337602 2017-01-13 17:05:07 UTC <tessajanelee> @maxlovesyou yes. we can agree lalaland was worst of all.
819953165055442944 2017-01-13 17:04:03 UTC <tessajanelee> @maxlovesyou actors were good but i found their experiences predictable and eleven used solely as trauma/love for mike disappointing
819952528041320448 2017-01-13 17:01:31 UTC <tessajanelee> @maxlovesyou i do understand why people like it i just was very disappointed by endless hype. might have preferred it as a film like super 8
819952316136693760 2017-01-13 17:00:40 UTC <tessajanelee> @maxlovesyou to me chs in st are all common tropes. it relies on the viewer having nostalgia for that era of filmmaking which i do not have
819950344675487749 2017-01-13 16:52:50 UTC <tessajanelee> @maxlovesyou best thing i've watched recently was the oa
819950304741490689 2017-01-13 16:52:41 UTC <tessajanelee> @maxlovesyou ST is a boring copy of so many things we've seen. tried to make a 90 min plot into 8 hrs. no innovation in plot or storytelling
819939095891869696 2017-01-13 16:08:08 UTC <tessajanelee> @maxlovesyou preferred westworld
819811444417933312 2017-01-12 07:40:54 UTC <tessajanelee> why is it that the only time fire alarms can start low battery chirping is at 230 am
819811210312839169 2017-01-12 07:39:58 UTC <tessajanelee> @maxlovesyou no
819752682051215360 2017-01-12 03:47:24 UTC <tessajanelee> the other thing i don't like about stranger things is that everyone reacts exactly how you would expect to everything they discover
819724967961100288 2017-01-12 01:57:16 UTC <tessajanelee> what i don't like about stranger things is that i could just look up what happens and i would have a similar experience
819683277023956993 2017-01-12 23:11:36 UTC <tessajanelee> so far stranger things is just a normal show but the actors are littler than usual
819376932810883073 2017-01-11 02:54:18 UTC <tessajanelee> @anaverde @melonsoul_ gimme
819375722812899329 2017-01-11 02:49:30 UTC <tessajanelee> @anaverde about this
818648599819128832 2017-01-09 02:40:10 UTC <tessajanelee> oa is worth watching because of the beach house song in the 6th episode
818578120315899904 2017-01-09 22:00:06 UTC <tessajanelee> @hayejunt omg
818325050436833280 2017-01-08 05:14:30 UTC <tessajanelee> not sorry that i think if you don't care about inclusivity in art then you don't really care about art!
818320269257441280 2017-01-08 04:55:30 UTC <tessajanelee> @JackFSerio you know i know that. didn't think i would have to make the distinction of when compared
818319847360753664 2017-01-08 04:53:49 UTC <tessajanelee> @JackFSerio which is why i urge you not to shut down a discussion on the topic of race. because la la land won over moonlight so we must ask
818319609719877632 2017-01-08 04:52:53 UTC <tessajanelee> @JackFSerio and it is important for people to draw that comparison so they can wonder if the roles had been reversed if it would be the same
818319418824552449 2017-01-08 04:52:07 UTC <tessajanelee> @JackFSerio worse movies i'm sure have been nominated helmed by white people
818319338482597888 2017-01-08 04:51:48 UTC <tessajanelee> @JackFSerio but i'm arguing if it was a black man in his position he wouldn't have. that is the important comparison. we will never know
818319151236321280 2017-01-08 04:51:03 UTC <tessajanelee> @JackFSerio listen i didn't see either movie for these reasons
818318822436376576 2017-01-08 04:49:45 UTC <tessajanelee> @JackFSerio i'm not saying it would have won awards but even if it had been a good movie it wouldn't have. every piece of press was soiled
818318382932049920 2017-01-08 04:48:00 UTC <tessajanelee> @JackFSerio had been the lesser crime and only an actor it would have had the same outcome
818318307694673920 2017-01-08 04:47:42 UTC <tessajanelee> @JackFSerio in fact i think if it had been swapped and affleck had been at the helm of the movie and committed the worse crime and parker
818317975870722049 2017-01-08 04:46:23 UTC <tessajanelee> @JackFSerio completely disagree. while the cases are not the same if affleck had been a man of color it would have sunk his film no question
818317025974124549 2017-01-08 04:42:37 UTC <tessajanelee> @JackFSerio don't think we can!

773218913563934720 2016-09-06 17:58:49 UTC <tessajanelee> turns out the day after Labor Day was really not the day to go grocery shopping
773021247764631552 2016-09-05 04:53:22 UTC <tessajanelee> just successfully woke myself up from a nightmare about all my one sided friendships

770796484711239681 2016-08-30 01:32:57 UTC <tessajanelee> my new favorite thing to do is only express emotions or talk about negative feelings on snapchat
770700402169778176 2016-08-30 19:11:09 UTC <tessajanelee> nothing like an internet outage to make me watch house hunters all day

770070998347575296 2016-08-28 01:30:07 UTC <tessajanelee> there's nothing more unnerving than when the lmu frat and sorority kids invade my local strip mall
768882860056940544 2016-08-25 18:48:53 UTC <tessajanelee> when you try to do your work but your parents' puppy tries to poop on your floor so you take it as a sign to just lounge instead
768695245223493633 2016-08-24 06:23:22 UTC <tessajanelee> I get that you live in a "beach town" and want to play your hippy guitar outside @ 11:22 but some of us have early bedtimes and thin windows
768524002419625984 2016-08-24 19:02:55 UTC <tessajanelee> @mattyglesias sad that you have to mock people with celiac and tell them they're the reason we might have a fascist president

767929376818143232 2016-08-22 03:40:05 UTC <tessajanelee> I don't know if anyone else has noticed but oral b and sonicare are having a full out war through cable television ads
