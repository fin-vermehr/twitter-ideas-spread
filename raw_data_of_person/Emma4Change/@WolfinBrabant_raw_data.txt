970461276831875075 2018-03-04 00:49:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DerekJamesNBA @canishoopus The guy saying : " I hope we move on from Butler" did get 22 recs though.. I hope he has 22 bit accounts. Can you check that? ;)
970460058587983872 2018-03-04 00:44:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DerekJamesNBA @canishoopus A lot might be overstating it..  But I've seen a few. But yeah there was more Teague critique ( which had merit yesterday) although a lot of people were mad about the tweets..Which I feel indifferent about.
970459297468551171 2018-03-04 00:41:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @murrminks @DerekJamesNBA @BrianSampsonNBA I still like Ricky even though I love that Butler is Timberwolf. I don't care where he draws the line
970458937538596864 2018-03-04 00:40:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA @murrminks @DerekJamesNBA It's allways like that. Defend player X by bashing player Y. Jordan/Lebron, Mitchell/Simmons...
970458241779068928 2018-03-04 00:37:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @DerekJamesNBA Well..  I hope it is. I was suprised when I was reading  the comment section of Canis yesterday.. a lot of people attacking Butler ( mostly about his tweets though..). But before the Jazz game I think I never heard a Wolves fan say bad things about him.
970457214812073984 2018-03-04 00:33:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DerekJamesNBA @canishoopus I see his tweets as the same thing as KG barking at players on the court. No one got mad at him for it.   He's a competitor.I love Butler and no one can convince me otherwise.
970456439767687168 2018-03-04 00:30:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DerekJamesNBA @canishoopus I've seen comments on Canis yesterday saying Wolves need to get rid of him. I've seen some Butler hate on Twitter as well.   It exists. I don't get it, but it exists. I think it's a small group though.  He's the man and we should be freaking happy he's here.
970455796965347328 2018-03-04 00:27:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AndrewDBailey Love Butler. He's the man. And most of the Wolves fan think the same.
970449345211457538 2018-03-04 00:02:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA Last season I was sure Dieng was way better than Towns on defense but I'm not so sure about that anymore.. ( could be saying a lot more about Towns btw)  But I stand corrected.. I'm gonna watch him more closely thursday.
970445277277585410 2018-03-04 23:45:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA I like Gorgui.... but what do you think about his defense? The 'step slow' part seems right to me. This season his help defense looks to be getting worse my my eye test... but you spend a lot more time in the film room. Do my eyes deceive me?

970433394067812352 2018-03-04 22:58:45 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Nazifah2 The tweets were just him sticking up for his teammate and coach. I'm fine with that. I can see how other people think it's unsportsmanlike. But I don't think it's different from KG's trashtalk. I never heard anyone complain about that.. and it is part of what made him KG
970432863391895554 2018-03-04 22:56:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Nazifah2 Teague has been playing well lately ( up until the the tackle)  I think most Wolves fans love Butler. By all accounts he is a great person and he has an awesome personality. Loved every post game interview with him I've seen. He's a KG level competitor.
970429483701493760 2018-03-04 22:43:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Nazifah2 I also like Tyus. The rosters Rubio has had to play with sucked for the most part. I don't think Rubio is to blame for that. Only the Love/Pek/Martin/Rubio wolves had a promising roster and they were actually a good team.  But I don't understand the outcry regarding teague/butler
970426500309815297 2018-03-04 22:31:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Nazifah2 I like Rubio. He kept the Wolves at least somewhat relevant and he allways gave it his all. So I actually do think he did  lot for the Wolves.  Also I like pass -first point guards.   But no question I rather have Butler on the team for maby reasons.
970418644307062785 2018-03-04 22:00:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Good question.https://twitter.com/AndrewDBailey/status/970386302464962560

970069442276274176 2018-03-03 22:52:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting I don't know. I never thought of it that way.   I just don't see how it's different from a red card in football? I can't get too upset about it.I can see how people can feel differently about it though. But I don't feel like people should stop rooting for him because of it.

969972320474484738 2018-03-03 16:26:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @UnderdogsSports @HaugenND @jmauren07 Every skill that has to do with defense
969969557396951042 2018-03-03 16:15:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jmauren07 @HaugenND Yeah Zach is gettig better each day. Love him and was a fan from day 1. But he hasn't really contributed to wi nning in his career. I think he will be great in Chicago but Wiggins has been the better player the last few seasons and he is this season
969967911401123840 2018-03-03 16:09:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @jmauren07 Yeah? PG Lavine > ROY Wiggins?   Nah don't think so
969966998989017088 2018-03-03 16:05:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Nazifah2 Too bad the Wolves don't play in the summer. We could've watched a game sometime ;)

969957622819508224 2018-03-03 15:28:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JohnEPalm Ridiculous call..   At first I was thinking: Towns shouldn't whine and he let the team down.. but you should be allowrd to say this..
969952192189825030 2018-03-03 15:06:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JohnEPalm Most of these reactions are sickening
969945321836032000 2018-03-03 14:39:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TWolvesArmy They didn't keep it clean
969942572591452160 2018-03-03 14:28:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @jmauren07 + Dieng extension wasn't a bad move in the landscape of the NBA at that time.   The Lavine> Wiggins take is bullshit imo. Put Wiggins on the Bulls with a similar role and watch how he plays. Lavine's defense is still atrocious and he never contributed to winning basketball
969942218420248576 2018-03-03 14:27:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @jmauren07 - Butler trade - Taj signing - Getting G-League afilliate - Getting rid of the country club - Installing winning culture..jury is still out on this one..but wolves made steps in the right directio

969934185006878721 2018-03-03 13:55:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @freetyus Weirdest game i've seen in years
969929984633720832 2018-03-03 13:38:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND I think it is underestimated how difficult it is to change the culture of a losing franchise ( for 13 years). I think as a POBO he has been doing a lot of things right.The offense going from 10th to 3th is a big difference. But yeah I agree. I expected more improvement on defense
969929246264188928 2018-03-03 13:35:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND And I get the criticism and I mostly agree. But I also see things I like..and Thibs isn't a moron.He forgot more about basketball than I will ever know.
969926476966526977 2018-03-03 13:24:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND I will not defend the play.   Everything that the Wolves do right somehow doesn't seem to be tied to Thibs though.
969925955669184513 2018-03-03 13:22:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND People just make stuff so personal instead of calling what actually happens  Player X did something idiotic >He's an idiot  Thibs rotations have been too predictable > He's a moron  Teague has been playing bad > He sucks  Rubio is traded> Thibs is dumb as fuck I don't get it
969924104143953921 2018-03-03 13:15:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Yeah.. that annoys me too. Thibs is Wolves coach. Let's root for him to do better instead of calling him a moron. That would have my preference.   But I can at least see where you're coming from. The Teague hate has been strong all season. People now found a reason to double down
969919864088428546 2018-03-03 12:58:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I'm allmost certain that if another player than Teague made the foul and the foul was not on Rubio the reactions wouldn't be this dramatic.  (Not saying it wasn't a dirty play)
969919184040841216 2018-03-03 12:55:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> It's fair to criticize players for dirty plays or bad takes. But people calling themselves Wolves fans actively rooting against Wolves players has by far been the most annoying thing this season.  This has been going on for a while now.
969917843784568833 2018-03-03 12:50:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf @DevenMax They are friends dude. Crowder reacted with : "That's my guy"

969638114049347584 2018-03-02 18:18:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DaneMooreNBA And his defensive rating?
969630552763654144 2018-03-02 17:48:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Nazifah2 Teague at the 2? Or Tyus/Teague alternate being the ball handler?
969627502833434625 2018-03-02 17:36:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA @molin1106 Can't argue with that
969624944228425728 2018-03-02 17:26:16 UTC <WolfinBrabant> What would be the ideal Wolves starting five (current roster)?
969590384463630336 2018-03-02 15:08:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND I believe you and agree about Russ.. and I see similarities with Kd/Russ , Towns/Wigs    It just made me wonder.
969590018208563201 2018-03-02 15:07:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers Think they should change the name to Tropic Supersonics
969589831490850816 2018-03-02 15:06:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf Best one yet.
969589063555612672 2018-03-02 15:03:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND That's fair. And I do agree to an extent.Just feels like I see a Wiggins post allmost everyday ;) Mostly fair points btw..just in a very high frequency.Last night he was mostly good on defense so I'm happy about that.
969588327904174081 2018-03-02 15:00:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND I agree about getting KAT more touches although i think last night's game is a step in the right direction. The thing is I think a wingplayer like Wigs needs the ball and has to get shots to get in a flow to be effective.  With Butler out he has been quite efficient too
969582762389856256 2018-03-02 14:38:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus It's a shame. Seems to be a really good and professional guy. He just never really seemed to understand this is a team game
969582442146357253 2018-03-02 14:37:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JerryZgoda @DWolfsonKSTP @JonKrawczynski @KarlTowns @Brighan44 But I agree with your general point though
969582379328208898 2018-03-02 14:37:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JerryZgoda @DWolfsonKSTP @JonKrawczynski @KarlTowns @Brighan44 I do think they need to go to Towns more.But this game wasn't as frustrating as other games.He had like 19fga's this game?I'm quite happy with how he was utilized this game and think they just unraveled as a team in the 4th and that was the main reason he didn't get any shots off
969580236613603329 2018-03-02 14:28:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA I think it was good to see he was aggressive/driving to the rim like you say. I think he should have gotten some foul calls and he would have been more effective on O. He had some hustle plays and contested shots that were in my eyes winning plays.4th q was for sure subpar though
969571389765189632 2018-03-02 13:53:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND I might misread this post rereading it. So didn't choose the right post.But the question remains..I've seen a few other posts already in my timeline from last nights game.   I get that he is frustrating at times.. but.. I don't know man..
969570686254682113 2018-03-02 13:50:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Doubling down on that he will never get real good/ have a break out game. Is sort of in the same ball park to me. And you do you..  but It just doesn't seem fun to mostly focus on the guy that frustrates you the most.. allmost feel like it's something personal
969569799641686017 2018-03-02 13:47:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Dude what's the deal with Wiggins? I legit want to know. I think it's fair to criticize him.. i do.. But why do it like everyday? What's the point? Doesn't it get old to you?

969560214344216578 2018-03-02 13:09:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers Was meant as a reply to @Michelobius   oh well.

The Punisher doesn't have the feel of a hero movie but was quite ok to watch. Daredevil was good. Jessica Jones has the best bad guy. Killgrave is awesome.
969559460661415936 2018-03-02 13:06:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @GameofReindeers Jessica Jones is by far the most interesting

969558460751859712 2018-03-02 13:02:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @DrewMahowald They just haven't been used to it.. but they will have to. I think it would hurt the team to go back to 4th quarter Butler hero ball as soon as he returns
969558197081198593 2018-03-02 13:01:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @DrewMahowald I still believe that dumping the ball to Butler in the 4th is not the best way to play. In the long run this will be good for the team.They need to adjust and find ways  to win 4th quarters as a team.
969548749176524800 2018-03-02 12:23:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA I think Wigs played good defense and he made a lot of winning plays. Yes he was subpar in the 4th on offense...but that was a team wide problem.
969521869157228544 2018-03-02 10:36:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 Somehow I wasn't annoyed by gim this game.
969519827906940928 2018-03-02 10:28:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> People choosing this game to say we should trade Wiggins for chump change show they don't know shit about basketball

969515098925608962 2018-03-02 10:09:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> The Wolves played hard. Made hustle plays. This loss has nothing to do with effort. NOTHING. Some of the criticism after losses is straight up ridiculous. Your take is unbearable.https://twitter.com/Graphic__Mark/status/969451072359104512
969512615390203904 2018-03-02 09:59:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> This game was fun! They played with a sense of urgency, made hustle plays and guarded the perimeter well most of the game. Wiggins was great on D/ made winning plays. Towns showed he is the most gifted big man in the League and played hard.Lillard time was just well-timed by Dame
969510559208103936 2018-03-02 09:51:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JerryZgoda @DWolfsonKSTP @JonKrawczynski @KarlTowns @Brighan44 The team as a whole didn't get going in the 4th...didn't have  anything to do with feeding Towns or not. They just rushed things on offense and I doubt they played how Thibs wanted. I think this was a game where they purposely tried to find Towns and the criticism is ill timed

969352134583029761 2018-03-01 23:22:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @talkhoops @Nazifah2 He can take a step back on offense. Wiggins has proven he can take a bit of that workload and he olays better if he has that responsibility.
969351804529135616 2018-03-01 23:20:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @talkhoops @Nazifah2 That's fair. It is mostly on him. Butler can meet him  half way though. The difference with how he played early on is so big. I think he needs to be the master of the little things, the hustle plays, be a leader and orchestrate the defense.
969343538549968896 2018-03-01 22:48:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @talkhoops I think great players find a role that benefits their teammates.Wade/Lebron,Durant/Curry.I hope Butler adjusts a bit to let Wiggins find his groove a bit more.I've said it before Butler tried two things:take a backseat and facilitate and get buckets.Time to find the right balance

968998767277076480 2018-02-28 23:58:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> They say Buddy Hield and Wiggins got into an argument in the hotel.   Hield: 'I'm not your buddy, guy!

968977601841827840 2018-02-28 22:33:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @marqualler Yes. Me too. I think this team is better than people think. They were depending on Butler too much, which made people think Wiggins isn't as good. He is better being 2nd banana and Teague has more room to be his agressive self too. Still miss Butler though :(
968976684811767814 2018-02-28 22:30:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I think the Wolves will beat the Blazers and the Jazz. I actually have the feeling they will end up with the 3rd or 4th seed.   They'll survive without Butler. This is not the same team as earlier in the year

968625024927195141 2018-02-27 23:12:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @owillis @JohnEPalm Oh but we have Wilders and Baudet to deal with.. and believe me there are enough nutjobs over here who have sympathy for Trump. They just dont dominate the media.. because well..it is a relatively small group.
968623184076566529 2018-02-27 23:05:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @owillis @JohnEPalm To be fair...we mostly think most of the republican party is bat shit crazy not just Trump... i mean you guys left of center politics is more right than most of our right wing parties  So it is so totally different... with our multi party system..
968622036057763841 2018-02-27 23:01:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @owillis @JohnEPalm Well... we kind of been there but now think it's actually a scary reality. The dude scares the shit out of us mostly. Just like putin/erdogan.. and to us he is like them ..especially with the fake news bullshit and the pressuring of the media..   While we worshiped obama
968621615025188864 2018-02-27 22:59:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @owillis @JohnEPalm Oh and the funniest thing . Our minister of foreign affairs has quit because he was pressured to resign after one lie about Russia. So we think it's kind of funny Trump lies 100 a day( including Russia) and is still there.
968620107885875201 2018-02-27 22:53:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @owillis @JohnEPalm So the debates about that topic have picked up steam here too.. although it isn't close to being http://comparable.you guys talk about police violence people here talk about racial profiling by police here..etc.
968619741656084480 2018-02-27 22:51:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @owillis @JohnEPalm After the Trump election people kind of replaced the awe and respect for the USA with dislike and a bigger focus on the racist underbelly in your society. This has an effect on us too though because we tend to copy what you guys do 1/2
968619061990121474 2018-02-27 22:49:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @owillis @JohnEPalm How the current debate has a different feel to it and that this might be a small step in the right direction + how ridiculous it is that there even has to be a debate..but yeah..
968618362468294657 2018-02-27 22:46:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @owillis @JohnEPalm You don't want to know. And the Netherlands is totally different than Germany and France for instance so I don't really know about western europe  At the moment we're mostly ralking about the students who seem to have changed the gun debate
968613936391127040 2018-02-27 22:28:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 @JohnEPalm I understand haha. Fair point
968612994270793728 2018-02-27 22:25:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 @JohnEPalm I think he can take a bigger role on O  than Dray...but yeah that is kind of what i meant/ am hoping for
968612725038505985 2018-02-27 22:24:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 @JohnEPalm Belly stretching the floor creates room for agressive Teague too.. Thibs might want to cut back jimmy's minutes a bit to play current line up some more?
968612380635750400 2018-02-27 22:22:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 @JohnEPalm Yeah..
968612236955615234 2018-02-27 22:22:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 @JohnEPalm Or how much better he was in the beginning of the season. Move the ball more, less iso, be the master of the little things/hustle and D. The ultimate glue guy that he can be and mostly is  Not saying wolves are better without him...not even close.
968611750550568961 2018-02-27 22:20:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 @JohnEPalm Find the right balance between the way he played the first stretch and the way he played after he stated to get buckets.   The offense has been too reliant on him especially in the fourth. Samole size is growing and it's hars to ignore how much better wigs is with butler out 1/2
968608599030280198 2018-02-27 22:07:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 Yes
968606341613998080 2018-02-27 21:58:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Butler has tried two things:  - Take a backseat and be a facilitator (to a fault). - Get buckets.   It might be time to change it up when he comes back.
968603690235023363 2018-02-27 21:48:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JonKrawczynski + he used quite a small rotation mostly. A lot of the criticism of Thibs could apply to Flip. Small rotation, big minutes for top guys, small amount of 3's , old school offensive system, not adapting to changing league( not saying all criticism of Thibs is right)
968601483141926917 2018-02-27 21:39:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 Agree 100%
968601405765406720 2018-02-27 21:39:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> 6 players in double figures. Wolves have been sharing the wealth.   Shot distribution could have been better though. Towns with 10 fga and team had only 17 3pta..  Was hoping last game was the start of a more diverse offense.. oh well..
968599838811152384 2018-02-27 21:32:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 And watching the NBA because dunkzz is sad as well.

968263543756939267 2018-02-26 23:16:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Anthonysmdoyle @ticketrules Fox and Ball need a good shot to even be in the conversation of players who could be dominant. Giannis is dominant without a jumpshot and so is Simmons(although still a rookie) That's different.   I do think it's fair to look at great players and talk about how they could improve
968262468572246017 2018-02-26 23:12:16 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens But hey, I admitted it.
968262334597779458 2018-02-26 23:11:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf Agreed. I would love to see him return in the playoffs unexpectedly.   But Pop winning the title with his band of misfits would be even more awesome( not that it happens..but hey it's pop)

968250390344093701 2018-02-26 22:24:16 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I follow the Timberwolves since I was 6 years old.https://twitter.com/World_Wide_Wob/status/968218464572903424
968248887902339074 2018-02-26 22:18:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TwolvesBlog @SwanInSaintPaul I tried to see past it ;)
968248738119606272 2018-02-26 22:17:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul Agreed. Although it was more in response to @TwolvesBlog.
968247886717837312 2018-02-26 22:14:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TwolvesBlog @SwanInSaintPaul We don't know. You're right + this isn't something I think is worth to discuss after the fact. Nobody can doubt how KG felt about Flip...so in the end it doesn't really matter..  I think the optics are bad though and he could have handled it better. But KG is who he is.
968246385505198082 2018-02-26 22:08:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TwolvesBlog @SwanInSaintPaul Because KG and Flip go hand in hand and he said the franchise should have honored him in the exact way they did now. It would have been great for the family, the franchise and the city if KG was there. Would have looked better. But he doesn't have to do anything.That's his choice
968245707651067904 2018-02-26 22:05:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul @TwolvesBlog Thst made him a great player but also makes him insufferable at times.  BUT we still don't know what really happened between Glen and him and Glen has proven over the years he is capable of making (many) mistakes
968245437386850304 2018-02-26 22:04:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul @TwolvesBlog I'm one of the biggest KG stans there is.. and I think he was in the wrong with not showing up.   His criticism was that they didn't put up a banner for Flip. Well guess what they did now?   I think he will regret it. I also think he is a proud man and ood school. 1/1
968242705766715393 2018-02-26 21:53:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul @TwolvesBlog He says KG is slightly overrated. Every opinion he has after that is automatically not worth responding to

967918677533380608 2018-02-25 00:26:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA I do think it could turn out to be an interesting situation when he returns..  If you see the shot distribution with him out + Wolves getting into the sets earlier..  he might have to rethink his role on offense (no critique WE NEED YOU JIMMY)  Especially if Wiggins plays well

He was speaking Hungarian to his friends...all of a sudden he started speaking dutch to me in dialect..  fluently..  was so weird. So you couldn't have topped that;)

967893340300685312 2018-02-25 22:45:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> And then the terrible offensive possession by the Bucks.. they could have won this one..

967853325432565760 2018-02-25 20:06:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @rodman99mn @JoshRathbun3 One stretch in the season where I allmost took Wilson with me and made myself a raft ( I might have tweeted something negative).

967162282454192129 2018-02-23 22:20:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @bballbreakdown You officically cannot pay players below a certain age. What clubs do is pay their parents and you have the exact same practices as with the NCAA but with kids as young as 11, 12. There are even stories of 6,7 year olds taken from their homes because their poor parents got payed.
967159765355900929 2018-02-23 22:10:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ProfCedar @AATK_DP Haha that would be something. Wolves already use the Iverson cut for Jimmy sooo..  Tony ofcourse

967148145393176576 2018-02-23 21:24:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @bballbreakdown .... the practice of scouting 11,12,13 year olds by wooing their parents and promising gold mountians is a very very rotten system in and of it's own. Believe me there are many discussions about modern day slavery and human trade going on in Europe..

966104492361084928 2018-02-20 00:17:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Phantele_ Managing the team I interpreted as something that's something you do mostly off the court.. but yeah the micor managing thing..i agree 100%
966104010246754304 2018-02-20 00:15:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Phantele_ Yeah ok. That's fair..
966103894815313920 2018-02-20 00:14:52 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Phantele_ * and by all accounts a lot of players liked him even when he was a tactic first coach and seemingly micro managing
966103674593439745 2018-02-20 00:14:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Phantele_ For example. Louis van Gaal. The biggest asshole in football (behind Mourinho) shouts just as much on the sidelines as Thibs and comes across as someone who isn't social at all. But he allways talked about the 'total human principle'(real words are just as bad as the translation)
966102804552146944 2018-02-20 00:10:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Phantele_ But I think Thibs is more of a people manager than they give him credit for. He really seems to care about his players and he knows they have to do it. Read about him visiting funerals of Taj' youth friends that he lost. His friendship with Butler/ his loyalty to his players etc.
966102328855101442 2018-02-20 00:08:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Phantele_ Yeah I heard that..shedule doesn't allow it either
966100881434431488 2018-02-20 00:02:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Phantele_ 'We practiced them hard' sounds very Thibsian
966085520727138313 2018-02-20 23:01:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JMGill12 Might be a better duo than Butler/Tyler
965755922512531461 2018-02-19 01:12:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> And maybe the world is better off because of it. Let's not have a pissing contest between two lunatics who could actually ruin the lives of everyone on the globe ( yeah Kyrie)https://twitter.com/PalmerReport/status/965444323952099328

965749422226395136 2018-02-19 00:46:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 Yeah I will never understand this. Such backwards logic used by so many people. It's just ridiculous. And I think nobody in the world will ever understand how the U.S.A cannot seem to fix this.
965745269353668608 2018-02-19 00:29:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @MacCocktail @DuncanSmithNBA @SmartGuyInATie And "European soccer players" is wrong on so many levels.
965744946358702080 2018-02-19 00:28:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @MacCocktail @DuncanSmithNBA @SmartGuyInATie Try again.pic.twitter.com/ROAD7tTtDG
965729259825324032 2018-02-19 23:26:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @absoloj Apparently there is a Creep 2 on netflix now. Reviews are very good. But yeah..probably the same thing so.. I think I'm gonna pass
965680509652217866 2018-02-19 20:12:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @absoloj 100%
965675805417377792 2018-02-19 19:53:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @absoloj Although I was thinking throughout: "I would just hit the dude in his face and leave"  but eventually I got passed that...
965675335131033601 2018-02-19 19:51:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @absoloj Haha I can see that. But he fucking scared the hell out of me eventually.. at first not at all...but every minute he creeped me out a little more
965674968829906945 2018-02-19 19:50:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @absoloj So if we're talking netflix here. Just binge watched Gomorra. Holy shit. That was impressive. ( not a scary movie though)
965673360683425797 2018-02-19 19:44:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @absoloj The invitation made me seriously doubt if there was actually anything wrong about to happen. And so slowly build. Great.   Really? The dude really creeped me.out...
965672849368330240 2018-02-19 19:42:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @absoloj Yeah. You don't see what they're running for so that's good... and the forest is creepy + I like the interaction between the friends and the backstory. Quite a good movie come to think of it. Just never was really into it while watching..  But yeah that says nothing. Carry on
965670409957007360 2018-02-19 19:32:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @absoloj Creep, The Invitation are two I really liked on Netflix. Seen them?
965670187461677056 2018-02-19 19:31:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @absoloj Weird fucking thing at the end though... I dunno man. They had actors you actually wanted to root for.. that's something.   Didn't think it was scary.. no suspense
965661985059885062 2018-02-19 18:58:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BreakTheHuddle But ...but.. Curry
965650769956532224 2018-02-19 18:14:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @lyft @KarlTowns Congrats Karl! You deserved it! First of many appearances!
965644504517828609 2018-02-19 17:49:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @GameofReindeers Have you seen the feet of those hobbits? Dude, they need socks and sandals asap
965630863122796547 2018-02-19 16:55:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer Yeah.. I've seen a few members complain
965524832392765440 2018-02-19 09:53:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @bballbreakdown You should run a suicide now.
965354493482323968 2018-02-18 22:37:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Zach Lavine and Gordon might have ruined the dunk contest for me.
965016910764134401 2018-02-17 00:15:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Tyus_Jones_Stan Yeah, that should help improve his shot selection
964845059530248192 2018-02-17 12:52:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Kyrie's letter to Lebron: "So I've set sail for the edge of the World. But if I find that this world is indeed round. Then maybe one day my journey will lead me back to you."  Game of Zones is the best.
964480362176024576 2018-02-16 12:43:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> - Bench made the difference tonight. They brought effort at the start of the 4th - 4th q defense was allright. Let's hope they keep that effort level up after the break
964480359340666880 2018-02-16 12:43:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Few take aways from last night's game  - Energy just wasn't there. They looked tired - Towns didn't score much and was mostly bad on D but he made winning plays down the stretch and found ways to impact the game -  Another good game from Teague - Thank god for Taj & Butler
964335753751822336 2018-02-15 03:08:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DrLwyrIndnChf Soooo disappointing.. they should feel bad
964335576093790208 2018-02-15 03:08:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens Yeah same for me. Already 4 am ..   Flip made me stay.  Good evening/night luke
964334898076160005 2018-02-15 03:05:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf I'm gonna tell myself it was already bothering him during the Rockets game  (Really hope it's nothing serious btw)
964334625547005953 2018-02-15 03:04:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens Well yeah. Let's hope he envisioned something positive ;)
964333857947385856 2018-02-15 03:01:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Would be the best story line of the season so far: Teague turning into everyone's favourite player
964327982427860992 2018-02-15 02:38:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA Not Zubac. What is he? who is he? Where is he from?
964325570153799685 2018-02-15 02:28:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @nba_poop_hat Jesus Christ. The D is non existant. Play some D on Flips night !
964324847508709377 2018-02-15 02:25:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GregoryWRios At least the rotations couldn't be any more predictable ..  + you know it's a lot of give Butler the ball in the 4th  But with three guys like Wigs/Towns/Butler.. it's still hard to coach against the Wolves
964324060120469505 2018-02-15 02:22:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GregoryWRios Yeah...
964323418429689856 2018-02-15 02:19:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So yeah. Towns makes winning plays but let's keep the standard rotation going and Dieng it is.
964315719176523776 2018-02-15 01:49:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HebertofRiffs @nba_poop_hat @DrLwyrIndnChf Fuck man. I've been a fan since I was six years old. Worshiped everything he did. But man..this doesn't feel right. And the worst thing is all those pics of Area 21 on my timeline with him being in L.A.
964314340491919360 2018-02-15 01:43:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DrLwyrIndnChf He will feel bad about not being there.
964313653221711878 2018-02-15 01:41:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> This is awesome! Wish @KGArea21 was there :(https://twitter.com/Timberwolves/status/964307891372118016
964258967982694400 2018-02-15 22:03:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Exactly. Don't need to shoot 40+ 3's. Just be closer to 25-30 3's each night and defend the perimeter better. That in combination with the low turnover % , high ft% which makes the Wolves offense already good will be enough to keep up with most great teams on any given night.https://twitter.com/Phantele_/status/964257292102389761
964250558000398336 2018-02-15 21:30:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @freetyus I would be so happy for the kid if he fixes it! Looks soo much better
964240154964750336 2018-02-15 20:49:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JonKrawczynski Thank you Jon!
964239945559957505 2018-02-15 20:48:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Great article! Everyone should read this on this special day.   Flip was an awesome person and a great Coach. Jon manages to capture that perfectly in words.https://twitter.com/JonKrawczynski/status/964178087322714115
964226576182280192 2018-02-15 19:55:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Carter_Shade I feel bad for the kid.
964208662788169728 2018-02-15 18:43:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @Aftermath8 Well. I guess a first season in the big leagues is allways challenging so that will probably get better. Sounds fun. If I will ever manage to come to Minneapolis for a Wolves game I'll come watch a football match
964207723553460225 2018-02-15 18:40:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @Aftermath8 Really? Looks much bigger. The tub's capacity is 51.000  Couldn't tell the difference from the pics  You go to Minnesota games? Are they any good?
964206453513969664 2018-02-15 18:35:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @Aftermath8 How big is the capacity of the new stadium?
964205578523430912 2018-02-15 18:31:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers Exactly!
964205111705714690 2018-02-15 18:29:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> "Standing side by side , Comrades" etc.   You're welcome to join @GameofReindeershttps://youtu.be/nTgSvcP8hmE
964204182336163840 2018-02-15 18:26:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @Aftermath8 Oh haha  They want to rebuild the tub too. With sort of the same outline.   Looks kind of good though!
964203811949686785 2018-02-15 18:24:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @Aftermath8 Won't go through.. (I hope)
964203736917688321 2018-02-15 18:24:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 @GameofReindeers I'm mostly friendly when I'm drunk (99% of the time) and when going to the game is no exception
964203492091904000 2018-02-15 18:23:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 @GameofReindeers Depends on where you sit. They have very fanatic support.. some violent but all dutch teams have that kind of support (although feyenoord has the biggest ultra fan base with not the best rep)  But what's awesome is every section sings and is into it
964202635778813957 2018-02-15 18:19:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 @GameofReindeers Haven't even mentioned the most beautiful stadium in the worldpic.twitter.com/CzvPfnpbZL

964200915958890497 2018-02-15 18:13:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 @GameofReindeers I think so yes. And by far the loudest support. 90 minutes of singing each game.
964200783637032961 2018-02-15 18:12:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 So is vince
964200717421633536 2018-02-15 18:12:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 @GameofReindeers Feyenoord
964200624693837826 2018-02-15 18:11:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @Aftermath8 Yes. Or you could support Ajax who are friendly with the Spurs. Which I wouldn't recommend because Ajax sucksss ( but yeah I don't really like the Spurs too..so you probably shouldn't listen to me)   And yeah you're in Londen in no.time
964200179544084480 2018-02-15 18:10:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 @GameofReindeers Yup! Great atmosphere and mostly full stadiums with room for more people than your average NBA stadium.  Gotta choose a top 5 team to support though. The rest sucks
964199753876688896 2018-02-15 18:08:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @Aftermath8 Oh our basketball sucks btw. So purchasing League Pass is inevitable ;)
964199438074949632 2018-02-15 18:07:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JMGill12 Yeah could very well be me. And I agree about his D btw. I'm all for him being criticized for it. So carry on
964198406683004928 2018-02-15 18:03:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @Aftermath8 Start a business in the Netherlands. Trade with the U.S. and keep doing that for 5 years and after that do a test to show you know your shit about our culture ( tough cookie to crack. I failed doing it) and learn the language and you're probably good to go.
964197506799357952 2018-02-15 17:59:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JMGill12 I barely hear anything about Portland on national media most years.
964197405154578435 2018-02-15 17:59:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JMGill12 Oh but I agree! About him not being deserving over Curry/Paul/Westbrook. And I think when he was an All-Star in 2015(?) people were still riding high on his series winning three against Houston.   I just actually think most people completely forget about him during the season..
964195809465057285 2018-02-15 17:52:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JMGill12 Look how hyped Porzingis was before his injury and how much Towns got criticized. Porzingis is in a big market and Towns in a small market.
964195127123234817 2018-02-15 17:50:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JMGill12 Yeah typed half of my intented sentence. But point still stands.... people really feel like he has been snubbed a few times before. And I feel like a lot of players get less criticized because they play in a big market.
964194646418128896 2018-02-15 17:48:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers My time line right now is utterly depressing and so Alien to me. I am so glad that I live in the Netherlands and my future kids will go to school here without having to worry about this shit. And my god the arguments..Sometimes I really wonder what I really think about the US
964193640993214464 2018-02-15 17:44:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JMGill12 Counterpoint: Because he is in a small market/Portland he hasn't been an All-Star before
964192341400616961 2018-02-15 17:39:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @refundpolicy I think you should kick it to find out
964187067130564608 2018-02-15 17:18:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @bballbreakdown Depends on the kids. First learn a normal lay up. Not all 9 year olds have this kinds of skill
964184975028510720 2018-02-15 17:09:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @NBA2K @UnderdogsSports Arrange a sitdown and make him promise he will change. Oh and get some lasagna!
964183655752110080 2018-02-15 17:04:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DrLwyrIndnChf They were unbelievably bad against houston. Tyus included.
964176763902484480 2018-02-15 16:37:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TwolvesBlog Lavine, Towns and Wigs getting me excited about the franchise again after the Love debacle was fun to me but the on court product was terrible.
964176534050430976 2018-02-15 16:36:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TwolvesBlog I kind of see Flip 2.0 as the start of the Thibs era. So I can't choose.

963936790796210176 2018-02-14 00:43:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @kylerayner8 @canishoopus @AverageJer Yeah. Super annoying. Takes me ages to type a sentence. When I make a mistake it's reason enough for me to give up..  Agreeing with Kyle is allways risky though %
963935975159328768 2018-02-14 00:40:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @AverageJer I read the start of that convo. When I checked back later everything was gone.   I can only read apparently my phone refuses to let me comment. So it wasn't me who ruined  eveything. I swear!
963934961052119041 2018-02-14 00:36:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul What I think is that the same logic is being applied with multiple issues with the same godawful results.
963917884425756674 2018-02-14 23:28:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 @HaugenND @fenderbender152 Yeah I thought the Wolves did alot of things right this game  ( his pointing to the ceiling after a made 3 doesn't help either)
963913142668492801 2018-02-14 23:09:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Flip was amazing. KAT is amazing. I hope he goes off against the Lakers in those shoes.https://twitter.com/Phantele_/status/963908589134995458
963912240272498689 2018-02-14 23:06:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius I kind of like him responding to it
963836895640870913 2018-02-14 18:06:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Just barelyhttps://twitter.com/swish41/status/963823929696620544
963834378970386437 2018-02-14 17:56:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Funny thing is. The same guys who are saying Lavine >Wiggins now were the ones who were saying how bad Lavine was as a prospect last season and the season before.  Patience is a thing that does not exist on the interwebs. Overreacting to a few performances however is.
963832948679217152 2018-02-14 17:50:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 @HaugenND That could be true
963783696926101505 2018-02-14 14:35:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 I will not argue that. But Houston shoots 40+ 3's . Even in this modern NBA that is A LOT. So the difference is even more glaring. Most opponents wolves can overcome the 3 difference somewhat. But yeah it's obvious : moar threesss
963782829262950400 2018-02-14 14:31:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 Houston is probably the worst match up for the Wolves. We knew that already. I thought the defense looked engaged early on and on offense there were some positives as well. If Butler was more his mvp self and Wiggins would have a normal game it would have been a lot closer.
963773795898097665 2018-02-14 13:55:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So.. I guess I'm the only one who thinks the Houston game wasn't all that bad.
963620544259248129 2018-02-13 03:46:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens Think we got our answer tonight..  But no.. not a chance.
963617033509326855 2018-02-13 03:32:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I really liked the effort and the defense for the most part. Houston/Ryan Anderson started to hit some hard shots that were mostly contested well. That was demoralizing.. especially after Wiggins stepping out of bounds. After that the game was over.
963614744740532224 2018-02-13 03:23:52 UTC <WolfinBrabant> This was fun.  For 3 quarters.   - Vintage Teague is fun - Towns was great( and had 16fga) - Butler was invisible - Wiggins single handedly killed this game - Bench was terrible besides Crawford getting hot late - Houston is soooo good.  - Wolves gave up in the 4th
963607359787622400 2018-02-13 02:54:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Wolves are playing really well. Especially like their effort on D. With a different shooting night from Wiggins this game would have been in Wolves favour.
963602761936973824 2018-02-13 02:36:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Is it just me or do the Wolves barely talk during half of their time outs?

963590587374034945 2018-02-13 01:47:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Good timing by Jamal and Wigs to be ice cold
963590044270424065 2018-02-13 01:45:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> First time all season i really want Teague back on the court asap
963588455765856256 2018-02-13 01:39:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens Looks like it!
963587999102627840 2018-02-13 01:37:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Great 1st q. Good defense + Good Teague= Good result.
963584745182461952 2018-02-13 01:24:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf And a great one to Butler. Come on Teague. Keep it up!
963584533256900610 2018-02-13 01:23:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf He has a really good start. Nice pass to Taj just now.

963518924112498693 2018-02-13 21:03:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Just don't ever let him coach any youth teams.

963462992061960192 2018-02-13 17:20:52 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @bballbreakdown It's hard to believe period. I've seen this story unfold every season. Just glad this time I don't have to hold on to that hope and I can just see how it goes. I hope for him and the Jazz he will keep it up for a while though
963459619560488963 2018-02-13 17:07:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TheSportsminn So yeah... it's soo weird..  It might really be a shoulder issue
963459410973556736 2018-02-13 17:06:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TheSportsminn I hadn't touched a ball in 9 years. Took me half an hour to get back to 8 out of 10 free throws consistently.

963405597134778370 2018-02-13 13:32:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TravLyleCzech Insomnia should be higher too imo
963404294874640384 2018-02-13 13:27:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So why is it when people discuss/compare two great players there are allways those who downplay the achievements of one of them? Last time I checked both Simmons and Mitchell are great.    We are lucky the future of the league is in such great hands.
963210882703675392 2018-02-12 00:39:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer If that turns out to be true... you're gonna say : 'I told you so!' ?
963202556859158529 2018-02-12 00:05:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Yeah. His name is Derrick Rose.https://twitter.com/JacobEGoldstein/status/963193551382294528
963122976983044096 2018-02-12 18:49:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JaceFrederick I think his type of game is ideal for the playoffs.
963099969547853824 2018-02-12 17:18:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND But Wiggins' Cleveland/Toronto games are mostly quite good and efficient.. he's not necessarily forcing the issue.
963099537266049024 2018-02-12 17:16:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Not even gonna argue. Still frustrating to see him show up against those teams but not keeping that level of play up afterwards.
963095392673034242 2018-02-12 17:00:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SeanEvansIP It puts a lower ceiling on the team...   Still hoping he will go back to being a little more of a facilitator.
963095100942372865 2018-02-12 16:59:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SeanEvansIP I'm a little bit worried the offense is way too dependant on Butler and he's the main reason Wiggins can't really seem to find his groove on O, Towns doesn't get enough touches, and Wolves end game execution is too predictable.   Not one to criticize the best player but..
963094156288712704 2018-02-12 16:55:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Tyus_Jones_Stan Patton, Belly, Taj, Dieng, Towns isn't nearly enough! We need frontcourt depth badly.
963093598320422914 2018-02-12 16:53:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So Butler went for own succes way too much against the Bulls, probably because he wanted to show the Bulls what they're missing. Now he didn't show up for three quarters against the Kings.   Now imagine if this was Wiggins and how twitter would look like.

962403206235074560 2018-02-10 19:09:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball Colangelo and Brett have been awful when it comes to protecting this kid.
962402389385981954 2018-02-10 19:06:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA And rightfully so imo.   Butler is still a great trade! Taj has been a great addition. Crawford is meh. I mean with the MLE you were not getting a world beater last off season. Brooks is just  a third string pg. Getting a first first for Rubio is fine. Only teague has been bad..
962399087411847168 2018-02-10 18:53:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 + effort. Doesn't seem anyone is trying this last stretch of games. Scheme was working just fine in that strecth of nine or something games keeping opponent under a 100 pts.
962396967920947201 2018-02-10 18:44:52 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 Haha. Okay..   well yeah at that side of the ball everyone sucksssss
962396743760478209 2018-02-10 18:43:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 Is jarring. A lot of post ups they just ignore him ( although he can get better position a lot of times)
962396592992145409 2018-02-10 18:43:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 He executes a lot of plays very well. After that Butler / Teague / Wigs just dont continue the play like they should  How many times he sets a pick and then rolls to the basket but they don't pass him the ball because they are too late and end up going for a bad drive or jumpshot
962387734416543744 2018-02-10 18:08:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens Yeah you're right. Flu is annoying as hell. Thanks Luke!
962385265812787201 2018-02-10 17:58:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens just bored haha. Have the flu for like a week now..   Think i'm gonna try to do some work stuff now
962375840804888578 2018-02-10 17:20:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Although I think the Towns touches thing has more to do with execution than the actual plays. Butler/Teague are the ones who can really change thathttps://twitter.com/WolfinBrabant/status/962374471276474368
962374471276474368 2018-02-10 17:15:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Does anyone ever yell at Thibs? I want to buy tickets for seats behind the bench to just scream shit at Thibs  DO YOUR JOB  GET TOWNS MORE TOUCHES  PLAY TYUS MORE MINUTES  GET TEAGUE OFF THE COURT  GET THEM TO PLAY SOME  FUCKING DEFENSE  STOP WITH THAT BUTLER 4THQ ISO SHIT
962363107904491520 2018-02-10 16:30:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 Doogie reported the Bulls wanted Wigs but Wolves refused.
962360370399776774 2018-02-10 16:19:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TheSportsminn @JohnEPalm 4 things. But yeah I agree! Rubio dribbled a lot too but actually did something with it afterwards.
962356427347152902 2018-02-10 16:03:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @freetyus @UnderdogsSports @TheSportsminn @HaugenND Counterpoint: Lavines D would hurt us more than his shooting would help
962355859459321857 2018-02-10 16:01:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @TheSportsminn Exactly. I've watched him some during his pacers and hawks stints. Never expected him to be a world beater..  but this? He is a lot worse as he was when going by eye test
962355301495263232 2018-02-10 15:59:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @freetyus @UnderdogsSports @TheSportsminn @HaugenND His D is still atrocious while Wiggins is currently one of our best defenders.
962354957302321153 2018-02-10 15:57:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TheSportsminn @HaugenND The big difference is his lack of agressiveness this  season
962354511833649153 2018-02-10 15:56:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports @Tyus_Jones_Stan + I agreed with you about him overpaying Teague. You just refuse to see that.. because I said it's unbelievabke how bad he is this season and I don't think anyone actually thought he would be this bad.
962354219830464517 2018-02-10 15:55:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports @Tyus_Jones_Stan Like :   -Fuck thibs for trying to trade Rubio for Rose while he got a first for Rubio. In the current market a solid move.   - Fuck Thibs for wanting to sign Rose and Noah. He didn't do anything yet.
962353641616265221 2018-02-10 15:52:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports @Tyus_Jones_Stan Thibs does alot you can criticize him for. Anx I agree mostly. I just don't get why people criticize him for things he hasn't done or for things he didn't do yet.   That's just weird.
962353015524126722 2018-02-10 15:50:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports @Tyus_Jones_Stan We can judge Thibs on things he actually does do
962352926365749249 2018-02-10 15:49:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports @Tyus_Jones_Stan That were rumours coming from NY.. no one is sure he really wanted him.. if he really wanted him he could have got him easily.The trading Rubio for Rose straight up was ridiculous and I still do not believe that.Let's not assume rumours are 100% true and judge thibs based on them
962352387292835847 2018-02-10 15:47:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JerryZgoda @thedailywolf So Jimmy let's involve him a bit more and earlier next time then?
962352056572039170 2018-02-10 15:46:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports @Tyus_Jones_Stan Yeah like I said. Thought it was a lteral move at best.
962351929279107072 2018-02-10 15:45:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports @Tyus_Jones_Stan Yeah ....let's not do that. I'm not.saying it's not a possibility. Just don't think signing Taj plus trading for Butler is any indication he will do these things.
962351634666934274 2018-02-10 15:44:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports @Tyus_Jones_Stan We got a first. And hey..I'm not saying Teague isn't overpayed. I could see the argument for Teague> Rubio with this roster but allways thought it was a lateral move
962351011175256064 2018-02-10 15:42:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports @Tyus_Jones_Stan Let's talk if he signs Rose.
962350932955729920 2018-02-10 15:41:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports @Tyus_Jones_Stan Teague wasn't nearly as bad as he is now. That's bull
962350584522268672 2018-02-10 15:40:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports @Tyus_Jones_Stan I'm not sad about getting rid of the old country club. And coaches choosing theur own staff isn't a bad thing...  the culture had to change. He kept the best staff membet in Saunders.
962350305215205378 2018-02-10 15:39:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports @Tyus_Jones_Stan What? Butler is great! Taj is good! I don't think you disagree..  And I can see how he thought Rubio wouldn't fit. No one could have guessed how bad Teague would be...
962349217288196096 2018-02-10 15:35:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports @Tyus_Jones_Stan The 2/3 you adore is important. He signed two legit good/great players. Who fill needs. Not relevant they're from the Bulls. Brooks is a third string pg who barely plays. He refused to pay Deng  big dollars and looked at a lot of non bulls players in the FA market last year.
962348169207144448 2018-02-10 15:30:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports @Tyus_Jones_Stan If he's so loyal to his players why wouldn't he be just as loyal to his current players? I just don't see the timberbulls argument everybody is making..
962347014901108741 2018-02-10 15:26:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports @Tyus_Jones_Stan That had more to do with him not wanting to mess with bench chemistry than any former bulls love. He went away from him just as quickly as he was in the starting line up
962346409218494465 2018-02-10 15:23:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports That would suck. Still think Tyus will get paid. But i think he will not get paid much. Seen the FA pg market when Tyus is due to get paid? I wouldn't be too worried to lose him
962345104001437696 2018-02-10 15:18:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports I need to see it first to believe it.
962344661745590274 2018-02-10 15:17:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports Not saying he will.
962344334090698752 2018-02-10 15:15:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports I can't imagine Thibs seeing Rose as a Tyus replacement. Maybe a Brooks replacement.
962341293740437504 2018-02-10 15:03:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports *many.   I think the wolves having no pick in the 2018 draft would not make you happy next season when we have no  caproom to sign any great players
962340445396271104 2018-02-10 15:00:16 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports Yeah I think we have to agree to disagree. Have you seen how much GM's gave up first round picks at the deadline? One. And that was the Cavs GM.   First round picks have tremendous value. Nobody gave up a first round pick for an Evans rental. So all GM's are bad to not do that?
962339458271019009 2018-02-10 14:56:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @tweetdavebenz + can't trust a guy with a profile pic of Bill Cosby
962338884909662208 2018-02-10 14:54:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @tweetdavebenz We love you Benz! Hopefully 6+ years still to come!
962337764661497856 2018-02-10 14:49:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports + who do you think he could have gotten for Teague? Kemba? Not even close. Payton? How is he a solution?
962337454236762113 2018-02-10 14:48:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports Getting rid of him and giving up a first to do so are two different things. We need that first to be able to fill the roster with a good cheap player going forward. Giving Tyus more.minutes is a better solution. I would rahter Thibs give up the pick for a wing and even then..
962336451399700480 2018-02-10 14:44:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports I get that Teague is not playing well this year. But giving up our okc pick to get rid of a guy we just signed in the off season?  That would be a terrible decision
962335778876641285 2018-02-10 14:41:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @UnderdogsSports You would give up a first to get rid of teague?
962335267955847168 2018-02-10 14:39:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory And them the dude fumbles the pass and allmost ruins everything that his teammate did
962334281015136256 2018-02-10 14:35:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I like watching Rubio kill it in Utah without having to worry about how long it will last or how and when he will fall back to earth.

962319767158829058 2018-02-10 13:38:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @paulmobuckets What is it with the Spurs and Wolves twitter.   Like one of the few teams I can't stand keeps popping up on my timeline
962317171132129281 2018-02-10 13:27:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I keep thinking about how well Wiggins played when Butler took more of a backseat and focused on facilitating early in the season.  Butler did all the little things and was the glue guy.I get it,we started winning after Butler took off but he might need to find some middle ground
962308139226992641 2018-02-10 12:51:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @rodman99mn Well for starters let's play some defense. I haven't watched the game but Lavine scoring 35 and the last 11 seems like wolves handed him a breakout game for the season
962307513147420673 2018-02-10 12:49:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @rodman99mn He is the main reason Towns and Wiggins are not getting involved enough in the offense.. ( yeah and Teague has a way of screwing that up without actually contributing himself)
962307239347458048 2018-02-10 12:48:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @rodman99mn I watched enougb Lavine this year to not worry about that. Glad he ahd a good game though.   Reading the tweets though and combining that with my own observations from the last 10 games or so makes me worry about Butler and the effect he has on the offense.
962303718615068672 2018-02-10 12:34:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I opened FB for the first time in a very long time and the first post was the game score. I think I'm glad I missed my second game of the season. Looking at the score and the tweets of last night this was a depressing game.   Probably not gonna watch this one.

962127465190699009 2018-02-09 00:53:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 Dude don's scare me like that
962126867556913154 2018-02-09 00:51:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 But you got news on Allen? Only heard Belinelli would not sign here..
962126618968969216 2018-02-09 00:50:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 Yeah.. the only two I really wanted.
962126306975604736 2018-02-09 00:49:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 He looks older than me. But yeah. I just asked why he thought Rose was better. He said agressiveness and then got pissed of. Sort of funny. Did block him though  Wonder if we actually get a buyout player to sign here..
962125564726382593 2018-02-09 00:46:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 Well it just turned out thats not true. One wolves fan called me a cunt for thinking Teague is better than Rose. He said he would trade teague for rose straight up.  I get not being happy with teague but yeah...
962119995542134784 2018-02-09 00:24:16 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DLeague4 Okay dude. It's all good. You do you.
962118869216301057 2018-02-09 00:19:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DLeague4 So yeah...okay.  I'm a cunt for thinking Teague is better than Rose. Fun conversation.  Hey if you want a rapist on the team because he's agressive. Suit yourself.
962117427671822336 2018-02-09 00:14:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DLeague4 So answer my question then. What is Rose's main strength or what makes him actually a good player? Agressiveness is seriously a low bar...
962116791895019520 2018-02-09 00:11:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DLeague4 I get not being happy with Teague's play this season. But wanting a minimum contract player ( and then i'm being generous)who is completelt and utterly useless as a starter over him is just straight up ridiculous. You're being blinded by Teague hate when you watch cavs games
962115943240527872 2018-02-09 00:08:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DLeague4 So tell me what is Rose's main strength Nd how would he help the wolves during the playoffs?
962115499374075906 2018-02-09 00:06:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DLeague4 I don't know what you're looking at during a game then...   I mean seriously..

962114411199680512 2018-02-09 00:02:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @freetyus   after seeing this today I will forever like the dude.https://twitter.com/WolfinBrabant/status/961991247417233416
962113383494553600 2018-02-09 23:58:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @freetyus Yeah it does seem that way. But A LOT of NBA players have a huge ego.   I guess being one of the best players in the world and hearing about how awesome you are since early high school will do that to you
962112264500338688 2018-02-09 23:53:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @freetyus I agree. But I think his fellow players have a big influence on that.
962112100138135553 2018-02-09 23:52:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @freetyus Dude is a rookie. Jesus. Stop whining and play.  (He's awesome though)
962111330122719232 2018-02-09 23:49:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Howsito I really thought you were joking. This is terrible.
962110993999556608 2018-02-09 23:48:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @freetyus What I'm saying is Towns has the chance to get a lot more shots with the plays they are currently running and Towns is mostly executing them right. Teague/Butler/Wigs need to follow suit.
962110105402605568 2018-02-09 23:44:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Howsito You should feel bad. This is seriously a very very bad take.
962109609753436163 2018-02-09 23:43:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Tyus_Jones_Stan He should be very ashamed of that tweet.   Fuck i sort of thought it was hilarious... but man how can that guy be fucking serious..   Listing bad thing but totally not counting rape as a bad thing..  and then trying to ecuse rose for it...come on now
962108819798142976 2018-02-09 23:39:52 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Tyus_Jones_Stan I really thought that tweet was  joke... because of what he actually did do..  But after your tweet i'm reading the comments and i'm not so sure anymore.
962104691327979520 2018-02-09 23:23:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @joshvanklomp I gotta ask. Your family have a dutch  background?
962103235208269826 2018-02-09 23:17:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @freetyus I get Towns gets used like that a bit too often and that IS on Thibs. But i wouldn't call it criminal misuse. It would be sort of fine if the players besides Towns would execute it well..
962102408552898563 2018-02-09 23:14:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @freetyus When Towns sets the screen on Bron to get Wigs open Wigs isn't able to pass to him, when he sets the double screen on Thomas and rolls to the basket Teague reacts too late when Towns rolls to the basket and steps back to go for the contested floater. Same story with butler..
962101816438722560 2018-02-09 23:12:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @freetyus I don't see how that is what you see in that breakdown. Besides the part where Towns camps out at the three point line it looks to me Thibs actually sets up Towns to succeed with a lot of plays.Teague /wigs / butler often just not make the right decision after Towns sets the pick
962098717963816965 2018-02-09 22:59:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Kevin4213235 And why do you want that?
962093053623365632 2018-02-09 22:37:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> If you haven't already. Check these out. Good and simple breakdowns of Wolves plays and tendencies.   Makes you watch the game a little differently next time you watch.https://twitter.com/BrianSampsonNBA/status/962084939796766721
962091219936571392 2018-02-09 22:29:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA It's concerning. With the post ups I can see how he's not allways able to get in the right position to receive an entry pass. But these plays he actually executes well but Wigs/Butler/Teague just don't handle the situation after the screens well..
962090124971520001 2018-02-09 22:25:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA @Real_Jorg Well in that third play he would handle that completely different. For starters he would never try a floater because he can't hit a floater and yes i think he was a lot better at passing to the roll man and he was mostly ahead of the play and would not act too late too pass
962088544025104384 2018-02-09 22:19:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA Double screen on Thomas and roll to the basket but teague steps back and goes for.his own shot because he's to late to pass to a rolling towns.
962088196434747393 2018-02-09 22:17:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA Same with the third one. If Teague would just pass him the ball he would have a good shot...   Is it really the plays that don't work or just the players not executing it well enough?
962087545550135296 2018-02-09 22:15:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA In that first example of the rub series Towns sets a double screen on Lebron so Wigs get open. But if I'm not mistaken Wigs tries to pass to Towns after..and he  does have a semi open lane to the rim. That would actually be a fine play to get Towns involved right?
962086275548409856 2018-02-09 22:10:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Just the concept of not knowing how to shoot anymore is soo weird. How can this happen?   I truly hope he lights up the league next season with a 40+ 3pt %https://twitter.com/AndrewDBailey/status/962073238149898240

But he just isn't the same player anymore.That will not change with more minutes. You have to see that and you have to see Tyus is way better than the player Rose is now

962042284656095232 2018-02-09 19:15:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @GameofReindeers talking to two social workers in a conversation will do that to ya
962042007576133633 2018-02-09 19:14:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @GameofReindeers @JustinPinotti pic.twitter.com/cPGbEzPVQb
962041438073643009 2018-02-09 19:12:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @GameofReindeers When introspection doesn't lead to over analyzing your own actions it's allways good
962040992311296002 2018-02-09 19:10:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @GameofReindeers I wouldn't call it pissed. I think he tried to made a similar point to what jer just made. There are different opinions on Canis and he values that.
962040572104998912 2018-02-09 19:08:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @AverageJer @GameofReindeers Yeah you're right. Jimmy followed you to minnesota. My bad
962040187734781952 2018-02-09 19:07:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @AverageJer But but... Canis hivemind   Yadayadayada
962039865574502401 2018-02-09 19:05:52 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @GameofReindeers Likewise  One of the underrated aspects about Thibs and Jimmy coming to the wolves was you coming to Canis.    And I still think @JustinPinotti returns
962038654729244672 2018-02-09 19:01:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AndrewDBailey @Tyus_Jones_Stan
962037325873033217 2018-02-09 18:55:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball @sam_amick His agent and him might be better off when they stop talking for a while.
962035987487506433 2018-02-09 18:50:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @GameofReindeers Having said that... who am I to say that. I gave up commenting because of said commenters. So yeah ignore me ( although my main reason was the overly negative comments when I was actually over the moon about the Wolves being good again).  Carry on.
962035594552463362 2018-02-09 18:48:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @GameofReindeers Just let them attack you and ignore the shit out of them and continue with the original conversation
962035441623957504 2018-02-09 18:48:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @GameofReindeers I don't know man. Green comments aren't somehow worth more than others ( please don't stop reccing me)  And i think it's just key to don't argue with people you think objectively suck ( makes it subjective or whatever). What good comes out of that?
962034010707734530 2018-02-09 18:42:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul @GameofReindeers What has he done! Shit is going down! How dare you be intentionally obtuse and shit. I'm gonna subtweet this on Canis
962033818986209281 2018-02-09 18:41:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @GameofReindeers Just don't take that guy seriously.
962033606922092549 2018-02-09 18:41:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @GameofReindeers Yeah but that guy. He does that a lot more and not just yesterday.
962033249097678854 2018-02-09 18:39:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul @GameofReindeers Yeah the Cavs trades were craaaazyy
962032689846018049 2018-02-09 18:37:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul @GameofReindeers @AverageJer I heard O.J has some time to spare.
962032450649047041 2018-02-09 18:36:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @rodman99mn And fuck me.... i need a twitter auto correct. Jeff Fucking Christ
962032089053802496 2018-02-09 18:34:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @rodman99mn I do enjoy the subtweeting about Canis thing. But if you get annoyed just take a break. I did.   Nothig gets achieved with complaining about it.  And when you come back you have room to.focus on the comments you do like. I mostly just ignore the other comments form now on
962030989219323904 2018-02-09 18:30:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @rodman99mn @GameofReindeers My spelling is gone. I don't know what's wrong with me the last few days.
962030862849122317 2018-02-09 18:30:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @rodman99mn @GameofReindeers Well he commented the most by far. So when he left he made room for others to do exactly that and then you geg sitautionz like the scarred 666 one and endless devates about sigs filing the comment section
962030366864302080 2018-02-09 18:28:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @rodman99mn @GameofReindeers Why would i come back if it's not for recs.
962030302217388033 2018-02-09 18:27:52 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @rodman99mn @GameofReindeers I need my comments green!
962030180255514626 2018-02-09 18:27:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @SwanInSaintPaul Yeah. I stated that in the following comment. I agree there.
962029865833611264 2018-02-09 18:26:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @rodman99mn @GameofReindeers Would be a shame.
962029728214351877 2018-02-09 18:25:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers I see what you're saying.
962029282422751232 2018-02-09 18:23:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers You're allways wrong
962029083772125185 2018-02-09 18:23:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @rodman99mn I've taken a break for a while. I think I'm going to try to comment more though.
962028759107776513 2018-02-09 18:21:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers Hmm okay. You might be right.
962028546699898880 2018-02-09 18:20:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers I'm sure as hell ain't stating you are. Sorry if it seems that way.
962028246542909441 2018-02-09 18:19:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers Would people get over that though? That's a hypothetical..    He isn't useful http://so.how do we know people would react differently?
962027920469278720 2018-02-09 18:18:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers (Highly doubtful Lance was in fact innocent. And I do see your point) Domestic violence is a terrible terrible thing and athletes should be held accountable.
962027313645826048 2018-02-09 18:15:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers While when a guy has sex with an intoxicated woman with two of his friends: She says she wasn't awake and she was raped. And he says it was consensual but she was in fact intoxicated and you were with multiple people in HER home. There is little room for being innocent.
962026890729934853 2018-02-09 18:14:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers But when someone has an argument with their girlfriend and she falls down the steps:  she says you've beaten her and you say she fell. There is some room for being actually innocent.  If i recall the situation correctly.
962026274469351425 2018-02-09 18:11:52 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers Different situations. Both terrible. And I have seen a lot of people certainly on Canis stating their feelings about Lance.
962025363969921024 2018-02-09 18:08:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers Well.. I think what people need to see is the rumours are just that and he probably won't get signed and it for sure isn't a sure thing. It also isn't a sure thing he doesn't get signed though.  So again: ROSE SUCKS
962024813542780928 2018-02-09 18:06:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers But his personal stuff is enough to freak out about though..even if he's just the new Aaron Brooks.  I trust Thibs though. Shit ain't happening. But I repeat: Rose sucks.  And once more just to be sure: HE SUCKS.
962024520189067264 2018-02-09 18:04:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers I'm just worried it happens. At the same time I don't think Thibs will sign him. I think it's warranted though, to state to the twitter verse how much Rose sucks( he does).   At the same time it would be funny if they sign him everyone freaks out and he's just a bench warmer.
962016566584979457 2018-02-09 17:33:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> This guy get's it. Rose suckshttps://twitter.com/BleacherReport/status/961815428707307520
961996942732611584 2018-02-09 16:15:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Thibs! He's a former Bull. You can sign him!https://twitter.com/RealGM/status/961990980663762944
961995618896969729 2018-02-09 16:10:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Timberwolves @Brighan44 Don't act like he already traded for Rose.
961991247417233416 2018-02-09 15:52:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I like Ben Simmonspic.twitter.com/u7g3IEHvhv
961987801905614848 2018-02-09 15:38:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory So you also read the 77 dudes who gave a good review? They all have good reasons to give it a good score?   I dunno. I haven't seen a marvel movie without the hero beating up some dudes. So if he really doesn't it might actually be a letdown.
961962740209287169 2018-02-09 13:59:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @Uncle_doj Can't argue with that
961962614862565377 2018-02-09 13:58:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer Frazier i just watched because i could never sleep and it was literally the http://only.show on TV besides sex adds. I knew my insomnia was bad when I actually started to sort of like it.
961962241779273729 2018-02-09 13:57:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer That one is the longest ago. Was like 14 /15 probably when I watched it. You could be right and John Goodman was fun in those days. I did allways watch it but mostly because my mom was allways watching it right after dinner.   I did like it was a family I could somewhat relate to
961960786758373376 2018-02-09 13:51:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer Oh Will and Grace that is actually the worst
961960426765541376 2018-02-09 13:50:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer Seinfeld and Frazier are the worst. Friends is a bit better.. but seen all of them multiple times.  Dharma & Greg.. Roseanne  They just keep re running all if them endlessly
961946900705480704 2018-02-09 12:56:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon @paulmobuckets Just insane...
961757973059162113 2018-02-08 00:25:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Phantele_ I'm with you. Rodney would have been great and in hindsight he might have been gettable.  And yeah..  Rose..  I agree. Would rather see Noah on the roster than Rose for sure!
961756823610118144 2018-02-08 00:21:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Phantele_ Demanding accountability is easier when you can do stuff yourself and lead by example.   Plus Taj/Butler should be able to provide that and by all accounts they do. With Belly/Patton/Dieng/Towns/Taj let's be happy with the big rotation and focus on Wing d /shooting.
961755077747896322 2018-02-08 00:14:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Phantele_ Let's just skip signing former Bulls players while he's ahead. Butler/Taj have been great. Let's not ruin it pls.  I don't see any use for Noah with this roster.
961752706871414784 2018-02-08 00:04:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> With Love finally being a real second banana I think the Cavs will be better. Good enough to beat GS? Probably not
961750354252713984 2018-02-08 23:55:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Yeah let's sign some horrible people! Our team has been too likeable.  I have faith in Thibs. I hope for some better signings than the rumors indicate.https://twitter.com/DaneMooreNBA/status/961749889003778050
961749647193616385 2018-02-08 23:52:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Oh man. I didn't even think about this.. if Rose signs with the Wolves, Wolves twitter will be flooded with Rose stans   :(https://twitter.com/spitatem/status/961726228712402944
961746515143352320 2018-02-08 23:40:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @paulmobuckets @DrLwyrIndnChf @AverageJer @Patrick_Fenelon @canishoopus @Aftermath8 @JustinPinotti If that's true that is a very very good development. NBA teams should use the G-league more and in  better way than they have been doing.   And those Iowa Wolves look intriguing
961745219837415426 2018-02-08 23:35:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @paulmobuckets @DrLwyrIndnChf @GM_Thompson @canishoopus @AverageJer @JustinPinotti The irony.
961744088973357057 2018-02-08 23:30:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @paulmobuckets @DrLwyrIndnChf @GM_Thompson @canishoopus @AverageJer @JustinPinotti Like half the kids I coach still wear Rose gear. I'm actually thinking about benching them if they turn up with Rose gear at training. Same with Ajax kits.   FOH
961743496007835648 2018-02-08 23:28:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @paulmobuckets @DrLwyrIndnChf @JustinPinotti @GM_Thompson @canishoopus @AverageJer And one thing that really bothers me... but that's on me and probably makes me a bad person. Besides Klay.. Rose's face is by far the most punchable in the NBA and I just CAN'T stand watching that dude..
961743063969337344 2018-02-08 23:26:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JacobEGoldstein Yeah that is the biggest ? Even without a jumoshot though he already finds ways to impact the game on offense.. as a rookie. Kind of unique. But you're right. Both are unbelievable.   But Embiids durability might even be a bigger ?
961742591988588544 2018-02-08 23:24:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @paulmobuckets @DrLwyrIndnChf @JustinPinotti @GM_Thompson @canishoopus @AverageJer Brooks is actually likeable
961742313973264384 2018-02-08 23:23:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JacobEGoldstein I don't know man. Simmons impact is seriouslt great for a rookie. I think he will pass embiid soon when it comes to impact. If simmons adds a jumo shot.. watch out
961741962603790339 2018-02-08 23:22:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JacobEGoldstein IF Embiid stays healthy and Fultz fixes his shot.
961741826247086080 2018-02-08 23:21:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JacobEGoldstein Biggest is correct ;)  Simmons skillset is special though and I think he is the bigger talent. I could really see him being a Lebron like impact player if all goes right.   Sixers are gonna be a problem : Embiid/Simmons/Saric/Fultz/Covington is an unbelievable core.
961741208254021632 2018-02-08 23:19:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JacobEGoldstein @nick_buccheri21 Unbelievable
961739232674017291 2018-02-08 23:11:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @THalfCourtPress KG
961738121237983240 2018-02-08 23:06:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @THalfCourtPress He helped my favourite player get a chip though + ubuntu   I can't hate him because of that
961736566518542337 2018-02-08 23:00:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @THalfCourtPress When Doc/Paul/Griffin came too close to eachother somehow they were sucked in a  black hole of whining  They are all more likeable since being apart.. ( well Paul is still an unbelievable dick though)
961732680718176256 2018-02-08 22:45:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @absoloj You've got my support. That are A LOT of tweets though
961731618674237440 2018-02-08 22:41:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @absoloj Yeah...  I really hope I'm right..   That doesn't happen often though
961730894083051522 2018-02-08 22:38:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> After thinking about it for a second. Yes, Stein is not just any source... but I think Thibs knows better and his past decisions have been ok to good. I think he will not sign Rose.
961715475163082753 2018-02-08 21:36:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> But do they have one for IT?https://twitter.com/NickFriedell/status/961700888392892421
961680124642054146 2018-02-08 19:16:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens Not much upside there is it?
961674210698555392 2018-02-08 18:52:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens He will never be the same. He already proved that
961673760876191744 2018-02-08 18:51:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ProfCedar @luke_rietjens And you wanted Noah too. That's officially my nightmare coming true..
961673624817229824 2018-02-08 18:50:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens Being a former MVP doesn't say shit
961673484651950080 2018-02-08 18:50:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> But hey. We will all LOVE Jeff F Teague now!
961673313897664513 2018-02-08 18:49:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens Fuck.. I hate being a wolves fan
961672680503238656 2018-02-08 18:46:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> But she got a nasty STD in the process and will never be the girl she once washttps://twitter.com/steventurous/status/961672247432876035
961671639133024256 2018-02-08 18:42:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Oh shit...    Don't you dare, Thibs! DON'T YOU DAREhttps://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/961671449282076672
961670748787105795 2018-02-08 18:39:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Come on Cavs! Trade Lue! You're on a roll
961669650856767494 2018-02-08 18:34:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens Hah!
961669580946014208 2018-02-08 18:34:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So yeah that loss last night doesn't count, right?
961669411068370944 2018-02-08 18:33:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens Probably and then Thibs signs him  haha
961669156306325505 2018-02-08 18:32:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Phantele_ That makes the trade a whole lot better.. man hard to keep up today
961668625944973312 2018-02-08 18:30:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Phantele_ Did they keep the brooklyn pick? Didn't they trade it to the Lakers?
961668042613764097 2018-02-08 18:28:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> 'When adversity hits we go our separate ways'   Well you can say about Thomas what you want but he's telling the truth!
961666826391474176 2018-02-08 18:23:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So Thibs' gets what he wanted. Rose to relplace Rubio
961648740774875137 2018-02-08 17:11:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> The NBA is the besthttps://twitter.com/wojespn/status/961648533509111809
961573654705377282 2018-02-08 12:13:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Phantele_ If he gets as many shots as Butler every game he would have had at least a few 40 pt games and a 50 pt game. Efficient ones.
961572389061562368 2018-02-08 12:08:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA Glen?
961566002948591616 2018-02-08 11:42:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So the Wolves are responisble for the Cavs regaining trust and winning the ECF..  Okay.
961564783039348736 2018-02-08 11:38:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting Isn't it constant drama around Lebron instead Lue/Blatt/Cavs?  He can't solve that by changing scenery. He is Lebron after all
961347631325773824 2018-02-07 21:15:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 Yeah. I agree.   But Mom really is the one who should have handled this better

961285924561801216 2018-02-07 17:09:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 Wolves are rising fast
961285138117222400 2018-02-07 17:06:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti How many years do tristan and smith have left on their contract?   If it's 1 year i understand it. But taking back a lot of money to dump some ...
961284366482644992 2018-02-07 17:03:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti I don't see why for the hornets. Kemba is too good to trade for a 5-10 pick
961284106482016257 2018-02-07 17:02:45 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @talkhoops Kyrie asked to be traded. Doesn't mean...   Never mind.

960927992506716160 2018-02-06 17:27:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I have the feeling it would be better for Lebron if he loses in 7 games to the Celtics than reach the finals and lose 4-0

960884920720789504 2018-02-06 14:36:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius Allmost every pg has a floater   in it's moves arsenal though. Allways thought he was a hard worker but then never had a feeling he really improved that much/added new moves.. His on court play often did improve but then it regressed,well we all know the never ending Ricky cycle.

960880747996438529 2018-02-06 14:19:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Allways wondered this about Ricky. Has it been the coaching changes, just being hot and cold for stretches or his offseason work? Him never adding a floater still seems suspect.https://twitter.com/weatherbet77/status/960710586878316544

960870563433603073 2018-02-06 13:39:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Would love it for Ricky to have his stretch of good play be long enough to lead the Jazz to the playoffs.   Him and the Jazz deserve it.   (Hope that doesn't mean more Jeff F Teague debates. He's a good guy and deserves more support)

959945011281432576 2018-02-03 00:21:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens Noah is washed and on a terrible contract. We need wing depth. No center.. and Noah? I hope you're joking..
959943749773287424 2018-02-03 00:16:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens A Center? Why? Wolves have Dieng, Towns, Aldrich, Patton
959943576204578816 2018-02-03 00:15:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens I'm afraid waiving him is the only real option or they have to find someone willing to take him af the Wolves add a 2nd round pick
959943131260219392 2018-02-03 00:14:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> To be clear. I didn't mean I like Shabazz. Was just saying ESPN is ridiculous for somehow using Shabazz' request as a reason to rehash the Thibs overplays his starters sentiment.  Shabazz is bad mmmmkayhttps://twitter.com/WolfinBrabant/status/959919808992235520
959942582792065024 2018-02-03 00:12:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens What? Who would want to trade for him?
959938893629018114 2018-02-03 23:57:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> And Embiid who dunked on Westbrook, posed for everybody and then posted it on Instagramhttps://twitter.com/The_Step_Back/status/959938301225414656
959938466275581957 2018-02-03 23:55:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Yeah bad tweet. But no... if there's one guy on the roster Thibs has the right to bench all season long it's shabazz
959927905299070976 2018-02-03 23:13:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Is worse possible?
959923584394317824 2018-02-03 22:56:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting Exactly.
959923396950876162 2018-02-03 22:55:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting Thst is what I meant. My alst sentence is formulated a bit awkwardly upon second reading
959923208135888898 2018-02-03 22:55:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting I'm saying ESPN is talking out of it's ass. Shabazz sucks and needs to be traded. That is not on Thibs

959919808992235520 2018-02-03 22:41:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> The news about Shabazz' request to be traded is actually about Thibs and minutes distribution according to ESPN.  No it's not that Shabazz sucks that he didn't play it is Thibs reverting to his Bulls' ways

And a Draymond suspension isn't luck for the Cavs it's bad on court play buly the Warriors. Like missing a vital shot. Dray did something on the court that hurt his team

958817132128718849 2018-01-31 21:39:52 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Wolves run a lot of similar sets so I don't see how this is a knock on Thibs
958817036330766341 2018-01-31 21:39:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Just think it's funny you use a set that sets up a player for a long two as an example when you're like the advocate for banning long two's.  I happen to think there is a purpose for the occasional long two so I'm not disagreeing these are ok set plays but...
958815398920642560 2018-01-31 21:32:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND And Dieng have been off the dribble? Thibs runs similar sets as in your example. You just didn't look long enough on youtube to find video's supporting your point
958815156120772609 2018-01-31 21:32:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Dude.. you can't be serious. Ever since I've been on twitter you're like long two's are never a good shot etc. and you've never made this distinction.   I'm not gonna defend off the dribble long two's but even just looking at the last few games how many long two's for Taj....

958799499576725510 2018-01-31 20:29:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND So you mean you want to see more long two's?

958515817175552000 2018-01-30 01:42:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I think Butler can make some more effort to get Towns involved in the offense.
958515396113559555 2018-01-30 01:40:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DrewMahowald Never seen Dirk block a shot like that
958514397105803265 2018-01-30 01:36:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Towns needs to get in better position to get the ball in the post. It is not all because Thibs/Teague he gets so few post touches.   He clogs the paint on many occasions, blocking driving lane and when he needs to be in the post to get the ball he's moving out to the perimeter.
958513800625426432 2018-01-30 01:34:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Teague has more assists this season than Rubio has this season.  This stuff is meaninglesshttps://twitter.com/JoshEberley/status/958501917218385920
958505013671874560 2018-01-30 00:59:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> TREBUCHET
958502698042740736 2018-01-30 00:50:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> First few possessions. Towns scoring in the post, a Teague lay-up and a good pass from Teague to Wigs.  Please let this continue

958494513152102407 2018-01-30 00:17:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @FattMemrite @88mugsy88 @AverageJer Warriors were an equally terrible franchise. Mark Jackson a horrible coach. So... I don't know.  Kerr would have coached the Knicks under Phil Jackson though. Might be my favourite alternate universe.
958492111669735425 2018-01-30 00:08:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Nah. That's only been said about Durant. And that is still the worst move ever by player.https://twitter.com/YahooSportsNBA/status/958489153351565312
958486097159434240 2018-01-30 23:44:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @NBATV pic.twitter.com/IXCLnZFIp9
958485468026417154 2018-01-30 23:41:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Tonight is the night Towns gets 20 fga's right? Right? Please tell me I'm right...
958435648603607040 2018-01-30 20:24:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti Yeah I really think he's just a better fit and Teague is the better pg and it's probably not even close.
958435424158081025 2018-01-30 20:23:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf There's a good chance another John Meyer in this world is 15 yo this year.   I likenour chances this game.
958434521480908802 2018-01-30 20:19:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti Not arguing there. I think most will agree.   I do have to see how Tyus plays with more minutes for a longer stretch though. His fit with starters is obvious though
958433773594476544 2018-01-30 20:16:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti That would ne something. 90% sure that wouldn't happen. I would be fine with 24 minutes each. Let him start but stagger minutes a bit more
958432937761964033 2018-01-30 20:13:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti Exactly.
958431970899439616 2018-01-30 20:09:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti Yeah me too. You ahven't heard me complain about him all season. But this last week it was just too much. Even for me.  But I'm more annoyed by Thibs not subbing him ans not using Towns. This coming from a season long Thibs defender
958431521936994305 2018-01-30 20:07:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens They will be fine. And if you signed Lowry you would have no wiggle room whatsoever
958431348896780289 2018-01-30 20:06:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti Agreed he has been frustrating but this is not how he normally plays.   And he hasn't been annoying me that much this far. It think his overdibbling, bad passing and D etc. has been overblown. But man thos last few games were ugly
958429370753921025 2018-01-30 19:59:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I still think him and Towns can be a deadly duo in the pick and roll. I hope they will show it sometime soon.   Teague shows heart for playing through injury and I think he will turn it around. He has been a winner in the playoffs and I'm convinced he will show it again this year
958429367755005953 2018-01-30 19:59:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I don't wish harm on Teague. I do hope however that his play lately has been caused by injury. I hope he takes the rest he needs and will come back stronger.   He has been fine this season and is mostly a + player. Tyus deserves to get more minutes. That's not on him though.
958425429320306689 2018-01-30 19:43:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens I have been mostly fine with him this season actually. He hasn't been bad, mostly.   And I have a feeling he is really injured. I think he show heart for playing.   It's Thibs who just have to give Tyus some more minutes when he isn't playing well. But yeah dead horse yadayada
958424557697847296 2018-01-30 19:39:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens He has been bad on D. But this season he wasn't the problem. On offense though with his play lately and him starting pick& rolls but not passing to Towns has been a bigger issue
958424173696770048 2018-01-30 19:38:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens I think Belly has been fine on defense mostly
958357883518967813 2018-01-30 15:14:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I'm not a Teague hater..but damn this take is..  Smh   -_-https://twitter.com/Zantar95/status/958233888316362752
958297492419997697 2018-01-30 11:15:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Last but not least. Mix up the rotations a bit. This is getting ridiculous
958296917292802048 2018-01-30 11:12:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Tyus/Teague is just way too obvious. Not gonna say anything there.   Belly needs to get the touches Towns gets on the Perimeter. At least 6-8 per game with Towns getting at least 8-10 touches in the post per game.
958296486093185024 2018-01-30 11:11:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Getting tired of Towns getting as few touches as he has been getting. Let him not be the third awesome big man leaving the Wolves before they get really good.  Let Crawford play more with starters or just less so Wiggins gets his touches when he's on the court with the bench
958295965588508672 2018-01-30 11:08:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Taj has been great on offense. I think he can be better on defense than he has been ( he is far from the problem).I think Towns should be used like Taj is on offense and Taj should focus more on defense or should strenghten the bench with Belly getting more minutes with Towns
958295037456068609 2018-01-30 11:05:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Man. The Wolves. No words.
958129671677337602 2018-01-29 00:08:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @absoloj Thought timbers was a weird way to say timberwolves haha. Now I see you meant the MLS team. Didn't know they were called that. Just thought they were Minnesota United or something
958129249453568001 2018-01-29 00:06:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @absoloj Sounds fun. It's the way it should be. There can be some rivalry sure and some yelling is fine.  Put me in the home stands at a Ajax-Feyenoord game in a Feyenoord shirt and I will be put in the hospital 100%.  I'm gonna enjoy my visit to a sporting event in the U.S when I visit
958128132011315205 2018-01-29 00:02:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Griffin / Drummond pairing is intriguing
958127356236967937 2018-01-29 23:58:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @absoloj Hmm. Okay didn't know that. But never seem fences to separate the two.
958126725174579201 2018-01-29 23:56:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So, I guess the new malice at the palice will be between players and refs now.
958125874540314625 2018-01-29 23:53:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Blake for Towns is even funnier now
958125462089273344 2018-01-29 23:51:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> *tension.   Although families with kids would never be targeted. That is what surprises me the most with these Eagles stories.  I guess continuous violence will bring it's own set of unwritten rules.
958124785078239234 2018-01-29 23:48:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Or being around the stadium without a police force in between the opposing supporters. Makes you think how weird of a culture it actually is.   I've never been to a Feyenoord match where there hasn't been any sort of tention whenever opposing fans arrive (with riot police escort)
958123276114497537 2018-01-29 23:42:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I guess Hooliganism will never be a real problem in U.S. seeing the attention the Eagles fans get (which is a good thing btw)  I can't even imagine football fans of the away team ever sitting side by side with home fans in the Netherlands without anything bad happening.
957911786283589632 2018-01-29 09:42:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @gosutherl Yeah when you stop playing it is tough to pick it up again...
957778236473335808 2018-01-28 00:51:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DWolfsonKSTP Scary stuff...  really hope he's allright.
957430947653279749 2018-01-27 01:51:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ProHoopsHistory Tweeting about Erdogan when in Turkey though. Now that's real twitter beef
957429269138956288 2018-01-27 01:45:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JohnEPalm And 10 of their homies
957428316524437504 2018-01-27 01:41:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Why do you allways act like your source isn't just Shams or Woj and tweet like you're the one who breaks the news?https://twitter.com/TheHoopCentral/status/957419657404690432
957422593379794944 2018-01-27 01:18:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ProfCedar Smh
957421709275074560 2018-01-27 01:14:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Man this sucks. Two potential Wolves opponents in Playoffs lose important players in the span of a week.  Roberson had huge defensive impact for the Thunder.
957418354826006528 2018-01-27 01:01:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JoshEberley I don't really see what he means with it in this context anyway..  Just straight up weird.   And yeah I'm with you.
957416359075504128 2018-01-27 00:53:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @absoloj An acquaintance told his little brother came home with a garbage bag One of his parents:'What do you have in the bag?'  Little brother: ' I found some special balls in a backyard'  Parent opens bag and finds several skulls  He apparently dug them up from a graveyard at a church
957410599075569664 2018-01-27 00:30:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @absoloj Yeah, I'm not going back to work monday.
957380607620853760 2018-01-27 22:31:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I don't know what you're talking about.. I don't see a team wearing white gearhttps://twitter.com/petenowakowski/status/957182529672437760
957364902066294784 2018-01-27 21:29:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Jackb_32 @nycrootdown The POBO at the time was  Flip Saunders.   ( but yeah, horrible story about Payne. Seemed like such a likeable dude. Weird this wasn't a bigger story)
957346178739396612 2018-01-27 20:14:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Jackb_32 @nycrootdown I hope you see where this comment is a bit weird. You know who the Wolves GM was who traded a first round pick for Payne?

956982789240475648 2018-01-26 20:10:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @AverageJer @absoloj Yeah more often than not that is a good choice
956978648522854401 2018-01-26 19:54:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 @HaugenND During last stretch or ending at that position for the season?
956976888043462656 2018-01-26 19:47:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf Best one yet
956976782476967936 2018-01-26 19:46:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 Yeah that's my take too. But Towns effort level.on D last few games worries me a bit. He isn't near as good as he was during that stretch..
956975308577689600 2018-01-26 19:41:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PMBreakingNews I could have told you that.   Was never even considered.
956974432622432256 2018-01-26 19:37:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Was the Wolves defense for real in their 12-3 stretch. What do you guys think?  Last few games were terrible when it comes to defense
956972307607629825 2018-01-26 19:29:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PMBreakingNews @JHLewis5 Plus most shootings in amsterdam are not by refugees. That's a fact
956971944011845632 2018-01-26 19:27:45 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PMBreakingNews @JHLewis5 Dude. No one knows who did it yet so don't post this nonsense
956969657235329024 2018-01-26 19:18:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @AverageJer @absoloj Mostly throwbacks
956948313353441280 2018-01-26 17:53:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @bballbreakdown @pjcenatiempo Yup. Agreed 100%

956939953568612355 2018-01-26 17:20:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Lockedonsports @Patrick_Fenelon @JohnEPalm @Aftermath8 @HaugenND I agree. Just saying it is effective and working. Not saying it can't be better. A lot of people act like the O sucks. It doesn't. It works for the personnel we have and top 3 is elite.
956939320203587586 2018-01-26 17:18:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Lockedonsports @Patrick_Fenelon @Aftermath8 @JohnEPalm @HaugenND That was the one part he got right 100%

956938552532721666 2018-01-26 17:15:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Lockedonsports @Patrick_Fenelon @Aftermath8 @HaugenND @JohnEPalm Okay. Sorry haha. Tjought maybe you misread the first part.   My bad!
956938050390683649 2018-01-26 17:13:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Lockedonsports @Patrick_Fenelon @JohnEPalm @Aftermath8 @HaugenND Although Towns is not in the post as much as he should because even thibs agrees with you guys wolves meed 3's and he's best of teamat shooting them which is not.ideal
956937771003842560 2018-01-26 17:11:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Lockedonsports @Patrick_Fenelon @JohnEPalm @Aftermath8 @HaugenND Should they lower the amount of long two's and shoot more threes , yes.
956937678569852929 2018-01-26 17:11:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Lockedonsports @Patrick_Fenelon @JohnEPalm @Aftermath8 @HaugenND I don't disagree about that part. But the strenght of wigs/ butler is driving and going to the line not shooting a ton of 3's . Ft's are just as if not more efficient as 3's.   Plus i woukd rather see Towns/Taj get  alot of post ups than shooting a ton of 3's. So this O is fine
956936976862720001 2018-01-26 17:08:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Lockedonsports @Patrick_Fenelon @Aftermath8 @HaugenND @JohnEPalm I never said there was did I?
956936509353062403 2018-01-26 17:06:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Lockedonsports @Patrick_Fenelon @JohnEPalm @Aftermath8 @HaugenND If you replace the long two's with 3's sure. But if you replace butler + wiggins driving and going to the line with 3's on low %  I disagree.   Limiting turnovers plus getting to the line is a good strategy with these players.
956935339955884034 2018-01-26 17:02:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Lockedonsports @Patrick_Fenelon @HaugenND @JohnEPalm @Aftermath8 A top 3 offense is elite. I don't see how that could be viewed differently? Sure houston and GS are better but the offense is elite, period.  I agree we need some shooters. I do think however woth the roster the wolves have this just might be tje most effective way to play on O
956934567042142209 2018-01-26 16:59:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Lockedonsports @Patrick_Fenelon @Aftermath8 @HaugenND @JohnEPalm I agree it's about getting the points not about how. If you get a lot of points by going to the line a lot + limiting turnovers I'm fine with that. If you get them by shooting a lot of threes I'm fine with that. One kg of feathers is just as heavy as one kg of lead.
956910662453727233 2018-01-26 15:24:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting @HaugenND Agreed
956910221020008450 2018-01-26 15:22:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting @HaugenND I don't know if I would go that far. But I do think that discussion is more reasonable than Giannis for MVP
956908168986218497 2018-01-26 15:14:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting I don't think Giannis should be mentioned
956862277449371648 2018-01-26 12:11:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ThisIsMarlena @tha1355 @Aftermath8 Having more possessions though is part of the effectiveness of an offense. Second chance points/offensive rebounding just so happens to be an important part of wolves offense. Plus scoring of of steals. So i think you view it to black and white.
956861354425683969 2018-01-26 12:08:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ThisIsMarlena @tha1355 @Aftermath8 They weren't too efficient I give you that. Was the O good enough to win? Yes if they played better D and the W's didn't hit so many damn threes.  http://So.in my eyes the offense worked and the terrible transition and perimeter d is what should be talked about
956860714542600192 2018-01-26 12:05:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ThisIsMarlena @tha1355 @Aftermath8 Let's agree to disagree.
956860351265550336 2018-01-26 12:04:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ThisIsMarlena @tha1355 @Aftermath8 Sometimes you just have to look what's in front of you. They were what? 90+ in 3 q. Yeah than the offense isn't the problem
956860049007267840 2018-01-26 12:03:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ThisIsMarlena @tha1355 @Aftermath8 And tje post heavy p&r heavy O is effective against W's because they jave no one to guard Towns. So yeah the offensive system worked
956859659750604800 2018-01-26 12:01:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ThisIsMarlena @tha1355 @Aftermath8 They scored 111 avainst a good D = good offense
956841697757028352 2018-01-26 10:50:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ThisIsMarlena @tha1355 @Aftermath8 Well I might have overstated it a bit. But the offense for sure worked
956840180408823808 2018-01-26 10:44:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So I've got an idea. What if we let former player not be commentators of NBA games until they make it a rule they should have at least watched 20 games of the team they commentate on.   It's getting ridiculous.
956839432744767488 2018-01-26 10:41:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ThisIsMarlena @tha1355 Yes. Come on dude. Wolves scored at will. The D sucked.
956838855998664705 2018-01-26 10:38:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @wh1te_matter @JustinPinotti A lot of protein but a lot of fat too. So it depends on who's drinking it if it's a good recovery drink or not.
956838423947554816 2018-01-26 10:37:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Chris Webber was right about one thing. Gotta get Towns more touches in the post. Can't have him have 7 fga's.   It showed. Good to see Towns getting a lot of touches in the post against the W's. That's where they give up their points.

956677006439211008 2018-01-25 23:55:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DLeague4 @MaxKellermanJr I laughed out loud and I feel like a terrible person.
956676038452445184 2018-01-25 23:51:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @JustinPinotti While there is another player who does the same and shoots even less from three and he seems free from the same criticism.   They have a comparable offensive gane and I think both have an effective style. I don't hink wigs is that much worse. Butlers strengths just get used more
956675665855729664 2018-01-25 23:50:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @JustinPinotti I don't mind the occasional long two. I think it can be useful. What I tried to say was that Wigs gets an unreasonable amount of criticism for it. He changed up his game a fair bit and shoots from all over the floor but when he shots a long two the world ends.
956667574317715456 2018-01-25 23:18:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @JustinPinotti Probably. But the criticism is about shot selection not about the amount of makes. But yeah..
956664365452877825 2018-01-25 23:05:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer The morality discussion is a difficult one though when everyone agrees this is the most heinous crime imaginable
956663918226747392 2018-01-25 23:03:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer Ah okay. I didn't know that. In that case my earlier point still stands and I think it's fair to raise some questions ( even though the guys a monster and  even a 3775 sentence would be the right thing ). Where is the line for such comments? Which crime is where it isn't okay?
956663196957511680 2018-01-25 23:00:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon I heard he has a role in the Revenant 2
956661830524469248 2018-01-25 22:55:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting @streethistory Winning by 18+ with a buzzer beater. Yeah sure
956661701469974528 2018-01-25 22:54:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting @streethistory Yeah so weird
956661204516302848 2018-01-25 22:52:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer He probably wouldn't but I'm surprised she said what she said. But you guys have a different system then we do so it probably works differently. With a jury  and all that. Here the judge decides all..   And there for sure would be an appeal .
956660425277562881 2018-01-25 22:49:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @JustinPinotti It puts a lower ceiling on the team though with Butler dominating the ball that much. And the weird thing: the criticism wigs gets for shot selection should be no different for butler, long two's for days
956659739764641793 2018-01-25 22:47:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer Let me see if I can say this right in English. There was some discussion about it over here by judges and lawyers and they said the danger in her comments was that it could be interpreted as her being biased and it could be used by the defense to appeal.   And I can see that.
956657287820664839 2018-01-25 22:37:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @JustinPinotti To utilize*   When Butler was more of a facilitator at beginning of season Wigs looked best of the three. I think Butler can take some blame for way wigs has been dissapearing for stretches
956656973365301249 2018-01-25 22:36:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @JustinPinotti I allways imagined them sort of taking turns attacking the basket. When the one drives to the rim defense collapses kicking out to the other. Haven't seen that though. Still think it would be the way tomutikize them both. Butler has been too ball dominant though
956655930590072834 2018-01-25 22:32:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AndrewDBailey @jermsguy His rotations have been A LOT better lately

956598454482034688 2018-01-25 18:43:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SeanEvansIP Exactly and the Wolves are 3-0 against Pelicans this season.   Won one time when Towns was on bench all day because of foul trouble and blew them out few weeks back.   He surprises me with his takes sometimes.

955949338118811648 2018-01-23 23:44:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens I don't see the Spurs doing that + the Wolves mortgage the future so the Wolves might not do it either.   I think if the money works I would do it though.

955941559119286272 2018-01-23 23:13:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> What a day. Thomas singling out Kawhi telling everyone he's faking his injury. Barea saying Love is a midget. Giannis calling Lue to ask how he could help him keep his job. Lillard requesting a meeting with R.C Buford.   NBA is getting crazy.

955929811716800516 2018-01-23 22:26:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> George Hill really seems like the kind of player to fix locker room issues.
955926725929721857 2018-01-23 22:14:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> - Wigs was fun.  - Teague was fun - Belly was fun  - The game was fun (although terrible).  - Grabbing the 3 seed (without Butler)=fun. - Blake double dribbled after a terrible Towns turnover= fun - Clips technicals: Hilarious  The Wolves are fun.
955922862463967232 2018-01-23 21:59:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul That would be the right mentality. I think you're right.

955920869133574145 2018-01-23 21:51:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Towns should be pissed. Every starter having more fga's than him in a game Jordan is out.   If the Wolves' lost this game it was on Thibs and Thibs only.

So what people are complaining about with Teague wouldn't be solved with Rubio in the line up + even worse spacing.

954533384612491264 2018-01-19 01:57:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius And you're right. I'm not worried about Portland. Clippers are rolling though and they have some players back and at (close to) 100%. So that will be interesting.   Wolves are the better team though.
954532492689727489 2018-01-19 01:54:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius The Toronto game will be fun!
954531912789430272 2018-01-19 01:51:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius I could see that.

But I want to keep it fun and reply to someones takes and not attack the person and some have made that difficult for me so I took a backseat.
954507760300953600 2018-01-19 00:15:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon @Libraryben @AverageJer @BreakTheHuddle @JustinPinotti @ProfCedar @GameofReindeers I'm returning soon and will post ridiculously optimistic takes after every win to even out the pessimistic takes after losses.  Doing nothing makes me part of the problem.
954507350450278401 2018-01-19 00:14:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon @Libraryben @AverageJer @BreakTheHuddle @JustinPinotti @ProfCedar Seriously @GameofReindeers I convinced myself to not read that canisthread.. and you subtweeting it made me curious so I read it and some new guys posting depressing shit getting 18 recs have made me sad. And the Rubio discussion comeback was peak canis
954503428499214338 2018-01-19 23:58:45 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DaneMosher7 Agreed 100%
954503127025242112 2018-01-19 23:57:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DaneMosher7 Agree about the part that showing genuine interest in someone is a good thing. Depression though in kost cases isn't something that gets solved by strangers who show interest.
954502713374662656 2018-01-19 23:55:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DaneMosher7 Okay. I don't know. I think it's a simple statement about something that is tough to really grasp. I've known people with depression that could make it seem that they were very happy and even if you had a deep conversation with them they could fool you.
954501517570203648 2018-01-19 23:51:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DaneMosher7 The thing is though. A comment like that isn't really fair to people who were close to him. I don't think we should assume no one ever took the time to see how he was doing.   Depression is complex ( which I obviously don't have to tell you so don't take this the wrong way ).
954435796664188931 2018-01-19 19:30:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens Yeah I've seen some clips. Fey-Ajax is nothing compared to that. Crazy stuff
954434342113161216 2018-01-19 19:24:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens Same over here but biggest part of supporters support dutch clubs. Thought Flamengo, Cruzeiro, gremio Fluminense, corinthians, internacional etc. had great support?
954432827143139328 2018-01-19 19:18:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens Isn't it blasphemy supporting an english club as a brazilian?
954431798376914944 2018-01-19 19:14:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens Your name made me think. Thought you were Canadian with dutch roots or something

954429817318977536 2018-01-19 19:06:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens Nah we don't need him back. We gave him a career. He should be thankful. But he isn't good enough to be of value a few years from now.   Tof man! In Brazili. Doe je goed
954427921682305026 2018-01-19 18:58:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @luke_rietjens If Kuyt could make us Champions for the first time since 1999 than Robin can do the same. He's still a very talented player even though not near the same player he was.
954427575379611649 2018-01-19 18:57:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> TOR LAC POR GS  Is a brutal stretch of games and could be devestating for Wolves  I hope they channel their home stretch mentality.
954422526553329664 2018-01-19 18:37:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Skorzo60 @twolvesfan With the Rockets shooting lights out the Wolves needed him to shoot threes. They were  mostly good shots they just didn't fell.   He played quite well on D too, especially first half(missed parts of 3th and 4th quarter..so I might be  wrong there)  I think Towns had an ok game.
954415616055705600 2018-01-19 18:09:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers I know

954157033112076293 2018-01-18 01:02:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @WolvesCountry @HaugenND @SwanInSaintPaul Belly showed his value against the Magic. He the man
954153163510120448 2018-01-18 00:46:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> The thing is: Being All-Star is allways mentioned when talking about a players' legacy  But I don't see how it should matter. This thing is a joke.
954152017320177664 2018-01-18 00:42:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @WolvesCountry @HaugenND @SwanInSaintPaul Belly more valuable than?
954150826049720320 2018-01-18 00:37:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> The players are voting like fans. You would think for a lot of players it is a dream to one day be an All-Star. You would expect them to take this seriously.  I love Cole and all but this is ridiculous. The players who voted for these players should be ashamed of themselves.https://twitter.com/andyblarsen/status/954141347295854592
954148785835429888 2018-01-18 00:29:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> With all these players throwing hissy fits lately that wouldn't surprise me.
954148784157667328 2018-01-18 00:29:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I would think most players would rather play against Booker than Butler.   Did he step on a few too many toes along the way?
954148212583092225 2018-01-18 00:27:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So players are not only the worst commentators but also the worst talent evaluators?  I don't get this.https://twitter.com/JerryZgoda/status/954132396672278529

954068441383817216 2018-01-18 19:10:16 UTC <WolfinBrabant> He put his heart & soul in the game. Every single day. The greatest in my eyes just for that.

953718924083949574 2018-01-17 20:01:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 Kicking the ball to the front hoping to win a duel for  a header has been the english way for decades.   It might change.. who knows. Would make PL a more attractive league. A lot of people watch it but it hasn't even been close to being the best league in years.
953717814371680259 2018-01-17 19:57:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 + loewer echelon clubs in premier league are shit tactically. PL has allways been ugly and ineffective football when ignoring the top 6.
953716682933112833 2018-01-17 19:52:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 Oh. The PL will have an advantage. They allways have. But a lot of clubs didn't spend that money well last decade. Even a club like liverpool has fucked it up numerous  times. Like throwing money at peter crouch some time back.Domestic players are way too expensive too
953715465951629312 2018-01-17 19:47:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 Clubs with less money overseas will allways have playing in euroleague and champions league as an argument in their favour. Allways an option to go to a big spending cluv later on. Until now it's been.mostly enough to.compete on the transfer market with clubs like bournemouth
953714387935813637 2018-01-17 19:43:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 Thst's been tbat way for a long time. But it never proved to be enough money to lure top players. Bournemoth will still suck and will never be able to.compete with good clubs from Europe because well the other premier league clubs will have big money as well
953585680218775552 2018-01-17 11:11:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Was Thibs screaming : ' Belly, headlock, headlock!'   From the sidelines?
953578099433713664 2018-01-17 10:41:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Same goes for Belly. He's THAT dude. And Afflalo was acting up for nothing. Belly handled this wellhttps://twitter.com/WolfinBrabant/status/953068990368309250

952987540084150273 2018-01-15 19:35:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DaneMooreNBA @luke_rietjens Fair point. But rewarding a player who deserves it is fine. And you never know what happens during the season. But yeah Thibs won't play a deep enough rotation to expect minutes for him
952984519682002944 2018-01-15 19:23:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DaneMooreNBA @luke_rietjens Ha! Yeah. Good to see them actually do it. He's been really good in Iowa

952849596543356928 2018-01-15 10:27:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I never wachted American football before last night. Question: Did the ball have to be over the line before time expired?   Because I keep looking at it and I had the feeling everyone was already cheering before it was obvious he was in time ( if he was)
952711487042326529 2018-01-14 01:18:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> If you win like this. That means the sports gods are with you and this is Minnesota's year.   Wolves obviously beat the W's in the WCF now.https://twitter.com/WolfinBrabant/status/952711033428303873

952704616688443392 2018-01-14 00:50:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> And the line went in the right direction just in time and between the goal posts  Well I think that means twitter will luckily still be a fun place next few days.
952703584453394432 2018-01-14 00:46:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @UnderdogsSports Patton doesn't look close to being ready. Jefferson/ Brown would be welcome.
952701134073991168 2018-01-14 00:37:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Never watched football but was sort of interested. Following the ESPN gamecast is kind of suspenseful. Seeing lines go from one place to the other.   Rooting for you guys.

And when all is said and done they will still have the chance to have a decent career.   ESPN is covering this like: 'They scored 29 in their first match'.

952539917816561671 2018-01-14 13:56:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @dirtbike_head But the results..
952492893494800384 2018-01-14 10:49:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @1stTeamNonsense @HaugenND In one of the few losses during a regular season... ? not in this way.   But yeah competitiveness is fine.
952395073790017536 2018-01-13 04:20:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Warriors allways so likeable (to some) , laughing, joking and then some things don't go their way and they turn into a whining unsportsmanlike bunch.  Even Kerr is a part of that.
952113524196696064 2018-01-13 09:42:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So ESPN has this as headline: 'Hardaway nets 16 in return from injury.' Should have been : 'Towns near triple double leads Wolves to Win over Knicks'  National media never ceises to amaze me.
952100944606584832 2018-01-13 08:52:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Even on twitter the best color commentator!https://twitter.com/JimPeteHoops/status/952060061173633027
952018787947212801 2018-01-12 03:25:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Man..staying up until 4 am to watch the game and somehow managing to miss the most important parts..
952015817889247233 2018-01-12 03:13:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @EVR1022 Yeah...no... i really can't see it man: KP > Towns.  I guess it's obvious who won this match up.
952012116340420609 2018-01-12 02:59:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AATK_DP Insights*
952012035788812288 2018-01-12 02:58:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AATK_DP Clyde?  They did their homework somewhat talking about the Wolves D being good lately. Very simple commentary though.. not real interesting inside or talking about plays. Just okay.
952010008035844096 2018-01-12 02:50:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AATK_DP Listened to ny broadcast first half. Wasn't too bad.
952009165081333760 2018-01-12 02:47:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AATK_DP Weird.
952008988908052480 2018-01-12 02:46:45 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Could catch final 3 min though, half of jim pete's top 5 and bad wiggins iso to end the q.  All the highlights probably.
952008155525013505 2018-01-12 02:43:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So my league pass wouldn't play 3th q for some reason. Missed the Wolves run. Good to see them on top though
952007548147765249 2018-01-12 02:41:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Action Pack just interrupted Jim Pete's top 3...
952004623216373761 2018-01-12 02:29:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> That was weird. Cavs losing the game on offense chucking multiole 3's and then James stepping out of bounds + missing easy layup  But they had some great stops at the end there. D looked waaay better than the last few games.
952001265827041281 2018-01-12 02:16:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Wolves gotta come out with some intensity on the defensive end. Beasley/Kanter got whatever they wanted on offense.
951998185966395394 2018-01-12 02:03:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @EVR1022 + couple nice blocks and hit both his 3 pt attempts.  Been a fun game. Hope wolves play with a bit more intensity in the second. Too many easy points for the knicks
951997738312503296 2018-01-12 02:02:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @EVR1022 Towns not looking good on D right now. Kanter is getting what he wants in the post. Good thing he has foul trouble. Looking good on O though, two nice assists to Taj and Butler getting himself some second chance points. Porzingis had a good start. A bit invisible at the end there
951978202913804288 2018-01-12 00:44:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @EVR1022 I'm gonna go watch some more denver games and focus on Jokic' D. Interesting..
951977824642129920 2018-01-12 00:42:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @EVR1022 I think durablity is an underrated skill. Towns has played all games in his career. That counts for something.
951977688171982854 2018-01-12 00:42:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @EVR1022 He's a rookie plenty of time to fix his shot and he already has big impact without a jumper just imagine him with one.
951977333837180928 2018-01-12 00:40:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @EVR1022 Yeah the stats are confusing. But I trust defensive metrics less than offensive metrics..  with D I mostly go with eye test a bit more and he doesn't look good on D.   But yeah you raise some fair points there.
951976634663538691 2018-01-12 00:38:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @EVR1022 @HaugenND He does have some potential on D. Jokic probably is what he is on that side of the ball. I can see Porzingis getting better
951976381293965312 2018-01-12 00:37:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @EVR1022 I do like Myles Turner getting some credit and AD+Giannis are not a bad choice at top 2. Although with Davis injuries allways scare me.   Simmons could be a little higher? Could really be a generational talent his skillset plus his maturity for a rookie are ridiculous
951975300828684288 2018-01-12 00:32:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @EVR1022 You beat me to it. Never mind my reply just now ;)
951975168229986305 2018-01-12 00:32:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @EVR1022 But worst defensive duo is a ridiculius statement right now. Even if the sample size isn't that big right now. And if D is your argument having Jokic that high is weird.
951973682209058823 2018-01-12 00:26:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @EVR1022 So you haven't watched the wolves lately.   Come on now.Just watch Porzingis vs Towns tonight and see how ridiculous your list is. Towns has been very good on D this  Wolves run of keeping opponents below 100
951918395175432197 2018-01-12 20:46:45 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting @molin1106 I think you're on to something here. Jesus... weird conversations with you lately. First the titan toilet now jockstraps...
951914094621286400 2018-01-12 20:29:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting I think Ball/Kuzma are fine with it.
951911340129640448 2018-01-12 20:18:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @hello__caitlin That's the danger in letting ancient people run this world.
951910734673432576 2018-01-12 20:16:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TimberReBuilder @1stTeamNonsense You beat me to it.
951910677987430400 2018-01-12 20:16:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TimberReBuilder If L.A fans do stuff like this Lonzo Ball and Kuzma end uo being all stars.
951910416313143296 2018-01-12 20:15:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BenSchleuss @JustinPinotti Maybe both
951869630573932544 2018-01-12 17:32:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves He scored 50 ;)
951865496835633155 2018-01-12 17:16:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I feel bad for Fultz. It's a mental problem.   I hope he figures it out or else it's highly doubtful he's in the league longer than Bennett.
951860892244893696 2018-01-12 16:58:16 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I.. got nothing to say. Interesting though. I think..https://twitter.com/brohrbach/status/951836661423407104
951645158059266049 2018-01-11 02:41:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @cavs @fortheidiots Cavs broadcast really sucks btw.   But maybe you're right. Would be really interesting. But I think it would be a big story if true.
951644869637926912 2018-01-11 02:39:52 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Luther_06 Okay. Never mind. This is not a discussion I'm willing to start right now. I don't think we would ever agree.  It's kind of late over here so I'm going to sleep.
951644288718458881 2018-01-11 02:37:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @cavs @fortheidiots If that's true I think they showed they for sure need some practice. But i find it hard to believe. Would be really weird.
951643633094156289 2018-01-11 02:34:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @acceptedmystery @Luther_06 The context matters. It was a terrible remark. Why do you think people from countries like haiti go to the US? To search for a better life. Why do you think people from Norway don't come to the US? Chances are they have a better life over there.
951642152483852289 2018-01-11 02:29:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @cavs @fortheidiots I haven't heard that. Every team takes days off ofcourse. But what do you mean, like for weeks at a time or something?
951640866875236352 2018-01-11 02:23:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DaneMooreNBA @molin1106 Impressive. Best place to read shit basketball takes on twitter.
951640686205513729 2018-01-11 02:23:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @cavs @fortheidiots Tye Lue needs to go.
951640404776103936 2018-01-11 02:22:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DaneMooreNBA @molin1106 Haha. Lesson learned. Oh well you've got yourself a new toilet.
951639006277722112 2018-01-11 02:16:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DaneMooreNBA @molin1106 Up your tweeting game Chad ;)
951637672644284417 2018-01-11 02:11:16 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @THalfCourtPress Wolves proved that's not an issue
951637527202549761 2018-01-11 02:10:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @tha1355 Knicks fans probably say the same about Aldrich
951636662097936384 2018-01-11 02:07:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Kanter probably liked Tylers dunk on Lebron https://twitter.com/vspandia/status/951285998587179008
951635681142607872 2018-01-11 02:03:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ThisIsMarlena @AATK_DP I am very happy with our pg rotation this year.   ( well Brooks is... well not good. But even he was better than expected and I like his cheerleading game+ his golfswing last night)
951635362606206976 2018-01-11 02:02:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @suckerfish890 Love that Dolly Parton song.
951634721737531392 2018-01-11 01:59:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DerekJamesNBA Yeah I have the same feeling. Too bad I really would have liked Lebron challenging the W's again. Love his story this season. Getting even better on O in his 15th season...
951634250062860289 2018-01-11 01:57:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DerekJamesNBA Last few season you could allways have the feeling they would just turn it up come playoffs. This year I don't think they can.
951633156502941703 2018-01-11 01:53:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AATK_DP @ThisIsMarlena Yeah that has been the preferred topic lately.   Tyus is the new: he's so underrated people don't understand how good he is i.e Rubio.
951632320498413569 2018-01-11 01:50:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ThisIsMarlena @AATK_DP Yes! Agreed 100%
951631036571705344 2018-01-11 01:44:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ThisIsMarlena It takes a little time to be as ever present as the Rubio discussion though. They even continue with him being on the Jazz.
951628660368379905 2018-01-11 01:35:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @nba_poop_hat Yeah who know how much his foot is still bothering him. And he wouldn't be the first rookie to take his time to getting used playing ball with men. He seems to have potential. I'm still hopeful.  But yeah OG would have been so nice on this team. And would fit a need.
951628206817366016 2018-01-11 01:33:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @Phantele_ @HaugenND I bring it up because he still has  time to improve and it is possible he is playing closer to deserving that contract when the contract kicks in
951627769095573513 2018-01-11 01:31:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @nba_poop_hat Can't remember how serious of an injury it was.
951627646051418112 2018-01-11 01:31:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @nba_poop_hat Oh agreed. Just thought maybe that was an argument for not drafting.  I really don't know why they didn't pick him besides going for bpa and they really thought patton was bpa  Which is a defensible strategy
951626942188580864 2018-01-11 01:28:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @AATK_DP @Phantele_ @Aftermath8 I'm not saying it isn't possible. It's just hard to know.I just think Wigs will eventually be fine within this roster.He has played for Smitch,Flip and Thibs and even with Thibs he is used totally different in 2 seasons.I honoustly think he will be much improved come june/nxt yr
951626113842860034 2018-01-11 01:25:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @AATK_DP @Phantele_ He moves the ball better though, improved drive and kick game, improved D significantly;stance, transition D, overall effort, help d etc. That was what i was hoping for the most. Rebounds have been a bit dissappointing but his contested rebound rate seems to be fine(by eye test)
951625172053905413 2018-01-11 01:21:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @nba_poop_hat Yup. He was injured though wasn't he?
951624965580886018 2018-01-11 01:20:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @AATK_DP @Phantele_ Yeah. I will not say he has deserved his max contract yet. I'm still hopeful he will eventually.
951624821112176640 2018-01-11 01:20:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @AATK_DP @Phantele_ His regression is on O where he has already shown he can be good to very good. So I'm not too worried about that. His ft% will be fine. He moves the ball better plus sees the game overall just better. I'm hopeful.
951624443788431360 2018-01-11 01:18:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @AATK_DP @Phantele_ That's hard to know or measure unless we actually replace him with one of those players. I see your point but it is a team game and the results are good.I think criticism of wigs is fair.I see improvement though in the oarts of his game people were hoping for the most last season
951623749954146304 2018-01-11 01:15:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @tha1355 @Aftermath8 @HoopsMavenHM Statistics/numbers are useful but need to be used in context and have to be combined with eye test to judge a player fairly. Numbers are build in the past, progression is what happening.  Players can improve even when it doesn't show up in numbers yet.
951622326365323264 2018-01-11 01:10:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Meanwhile Patton is struggling in tje G league.   This one still hurts a bit.https://twitter.com/NateDuncanNBA/status/951621782066184192
951621799510462464 2018-01-11 01:08:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @Phantele_ @AATK_DP *defense.
951621714412175360 2018-01-11 01:07:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @Phantele_ @AATK_DP On offense you can get bailed out by a good individual play.. like the crazy iso shot of Butler last night or the wigs 3 on another terrible possession.
951621462259052544 2018-01-11 01:06:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @Phantele_ @AATK_DP Agreed. And Defensive is very much a team effort. If one guy misses rotation/ doesn't do what he has to do within system everything falls apart. With Wolves going from almost last to 16th defensive rating so fast shows rapid improvement. Wigs has been a big part of that.
951618727778373633 2018-01-11 00:55:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @Phantele_ Oh i agree about that. Good thing his contract hasn't kicked in yet. That is the funny part. He for sure living up to his current contract. Let's wait on the judgement about his next contract when he actually gets said dollars.
951617739432562688 2018-01-11 00:52:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @Phantele_ If Wigs D keeps improving it is a nightmare matchup for any wing to play against the Wolves. Butler and Wigs can switch are versatile and BIG. That is great to have on the defensive end. On O they both are great at driving at the rim + getting fouls. Possible dream wing duo
951617195854974978 2018-01-11 00:49:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @Phantele_ That could be. Wolves might have overpayed. The thing is good wings are a rare commodity. And even if wolves overpayed a bit he might turn out to be worth the money. Having two good to great wings( wiggins good/butler great) + KAT is something special.
951615928890023936 2018-01-11 00:44:52 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @Phantele_ I think it's a double edged sword.   His effort and D has improved but his O regressed somewhat. That has multiple reasons. His ft%, him driving less/probably adjusting to his new role and usage%  He seems to pick his spots better though,taking better shots+better decision making
951615226914492425 2018-01-11 00:42:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Phantele_ Discussing the imorovements and/or flaws is half of the fun.   @canishoopus wrote a great article about Wiggins and the discussions about him.   Imo there seems to be no middle ground.Some people who criticize him can't seem to see his improvements or downplay it and vice versa
951610798102675456 2018-01-11 00:24:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @tha1355 @GregoryWRios @HaugenND @Aftermath8 Him missing a lot of free throws is messing up his numbers too. That will probably go back to his 76% or so shooting he has been shooting his career.   He is taking better shots this season. Yes still a lot of long 2's but more 3's plus he's finishing at the rim at a high %
951609384345505797 2018-01-11 00:18:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @tha1355 @GregoryWRios @HaugenND @Aftermath8 You said slightly. I beg to differ+ if he had same numbers on O as last season + this improved D everything would look a lot different. After being nr 1 option on O + much higher usage he is finding his role on a team sharing the wealth. He outplayed PG last night.
951608208325513216 2018-01-11 00:14:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @tha1355 @GregoryWRios @HaugenND @Aftermath8 It is still the goal of this game to put the ball in the basket. So hardly useless. Yes his advanced stats do not look great. But you've watched the games. You can't honoustly think he hasn't improved on D. His stance, him walling up more, knowing when to help, transition D all >
951606706831876101 2018-01-11 00:08:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DaneMooreNBA I don't see any reason why the Wolves would say no...
951605222115368960 2018-01-11 00:02:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DLeague4 Well they seem to build on leads lately and played wuite well in the 4th last few games , less give the ball to jimmy he will bail us out ball.  But yeah! Agreed they really get everyone involved. Been some fun ball lately
951603165840977921 2018-01-11 23:54:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DLeague4 Yes that aspect is spurs like + the use of traditional bigs. But Wolves offense is way more p&r + iso heavy and spurs have more of an motion offense.   Aesthetics are totally different   Like the optimism though
951600486947475457 2018-01-11 23:43:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DLeague4 Besides sharing the wealth the Wolves style of play is like exactly the opposite of the Spurs..
951600041470382080 2018-01-11 23:41:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @JohnEPalm @Aftermath8 @JustinPinotti + Harden had like an epic combine. Crazy athletic. Allmost all of those examples are guys in the too.of athelticism in the league
951586096500047873 2018-01-11 22:46:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer I mean PG having 4x as much is way worse and there are a few others..
951581875474223105 2018-01-11 22:29:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul @HaugenND Mexican
951572007648407563 2018-01-11 21:50:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @GameofReindeers Yeah the setting and atmosphere was what made me play it. I really hope they make a better game with a better stoey in that kind of world/setting
951570597942874113 2018-01-11 21:44:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @GameofReindeers Yeah just a fun game. I played it nust after the Last of us so everything felt underwhelming after that..   and I'm not much of a gamer anyway. But the World was fun and the aspect of taming wild animals was fun
951570309244694530 2018-01-11 21:43:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @GameofReindeers I guess I just allways wanted my own pet panther to give me a lift whenever I want.
951570010035630080 2018-01-11 21:42:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @GameofReindeers That was a bad game and somehow I couldn't stop playing it. Far Cry primal...but it had a bug so i couldn't play the last mission. Terribly annoying.
951556663126970368 2018-01-11 20:49:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @freetyus That I can agree with
951551216114458624 2018-01-11 20:27:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @freetyus *games
951551154135105536 2018-01-11 20:27:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @freetyus Really? Hmm   Last few seasons he really sucked and Cavs D sucks.. but the Cavs game I've seen he didn't really play much.. and I must be honest I didn't really pay attention to him. I'll check it out.
951550562943881216 2018-01-11 20:25:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @freetyus Calderon is worthless on D
951534440064405506 2018-01-11 19:21:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf @porterzingis Yeah don't worry. No one reads threads I'm a part of.
951534225563570176 2018-01-11 19:20:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Tyus_Jones_Stan You're right.
951533250576515078 2018-01-11 19:16:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf @porterzingis Haha sorry Tony. I really enjoy your writing. Canis will allways be my nr. 1 place for wolves takes/ news.
951530965154836481 2018-01-11 19:07:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @nba_poop_hat His back up pg's in Chicago were awesome. So is Tyus. 1 +1 = 2 ;)
951530608399998979 2018-01-11 19:05:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @porterzingis Good point..    Hmmm..  now I'm confused. Never thought Liam Neeson was this funny
951530320540655616 2018-01-11 19:04:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @porterzingis @thedailywolf A good thing you did. I was starting to get a little angry ( just a little...really)when I read that take until I saw your ed. note.  So a little less heat was necessary.
951529609509654530 2018-01-11 19:01:52 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @porterzingis Who wins in a fight between Liam Neeson and Butler?
951528841545244672 2018-01-11 18:58:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Thibs on the side lines the last three gamespic.twitter.com/HFA1Kb2wiH
951528450665394177 2018-01-11 18:57:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf @porterzingis No problem ( sorry John)
951526750424653825 2018-01-11 18:50:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So Thibsdust is a real thing.
951525741220515840 2018-01-11 18:46:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TravLyleCzech It shows. Well.. let's see how that changes after the super bowl + nba finals ;)
951524612378169344 2018-01-11 18:42:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @freetyus Watch out...before you know it you've started a new Rubio discussion...
951523975171117057 2018-01-11 18:39:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TravLyleCzech So national media of all sports are ridiculous not only when it comes to the NBA
951523543069675521 2018-01-11 18:37:45 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf @porterzingis Did he also tell you saying Butler is the greatest Wolf of all time in a Canis article was a good idea? ;) He did, didn't he? And then take credit for the ed. note.. 
951523069591457792 2018-01-11 18:35:52 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Kyle_Ratke @geezerp Ah.. yeah maybe Butler has gotten credit for it..
951522938808827905 2018-01-11 18:35:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Kyle_Ratke Why didn't this block show up on the stat sheet? His box score says no blocks...
951522716607287296 2018-01-11 18:34:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TravLyleCzech I don't know shit about football but isn't Zimmer like a coach of the year candidate?
951521262945390594 2018-01-11 18:28:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Although saying he's the MVP and it's not even close... might be a bit much.   But Jimmy is awesome. One things for sure. He is the post game interview MVP
951520988134625280 2018-01-11 18:27:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Crazyhttps://twitter.com/TheHoopCentral/status/951517640211578880
951520760975249408 2018-01-11 18:26:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @steventurous You sure have some friensly looking football fans in the U.S. that is a different story here in Europe.
951519109870702594 2018-01-11 18:20:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fenderbender152 But he's in a though situation so... but yeah he handled that very poorly.
951518965599260672 2018-01-11 18:19:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fenderbender152 Yeah I had a whole discussion about that with Matt Moore. I agree with you 100%. He obviously didn't and kept quoting me to double down on that
951516044060975104 2018-01-11 18:07:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fenderbender152 This exactly.
951515943276089344 2018-01-11 18:07:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fenderbender152 We're very much on the same page about players we dislike I see. Although I have some sympathy for Ball. His dad + being on the lakers just ruined things
951514628340768768 2018-01-11 18:02:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fenderbender152 But the way the Warriors pile up those stats (great one btw) annoy me for some reason. Curry's mannerisms just bug me for some reason...
951514301902311425 2018-01-11 18:01:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fenderbender152 But yeah their body language has changed for the better in a big way. Even Thibs is smiling before games. And Taj maybe had a point in calming down Towns but I love to see him having fun like that. Towns allways had terrible body language even when winning.
951513459254054912 2018-01-11 17:57:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fenderbender152 And it has been fun to watch. Greatest season I've witnessed so far. KG's best years were impossible to watch in the Netherlands back then...just reading about it and then watching some grainy clips is way less fun I can tell you ;)  hooray for technology.
951511398189797376 2018-01-11 17:49:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fenderbender152 No doubt. The Wolves being  perennial loser for years and now being a contender for home court advantage can't be understated. I think Thibs deserves a lot of credit for that as well + Taj
951511097240178688 2018-01-11 17:48:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fenderbender152 I tried to copy paste the article but I somehow can't do it..just need to scroll a bit down and you'll find it. But you're right the D is really looking good this stretch of games. Especially Towns help defense and him just walling up and not jumping all over the place been huge
951509658560335872 2018-01-11 17:42:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fenderbender152 Made me think they didn't really watch the last 12 or so games.
951509537311338496 2018-01-11 17:42:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fenderbender152 It was a 5 on 5 saying Thunder are bigger threat in postseason. The biggest reason they brought up was that the Wolves really need to add defense to the roster. The timing with Wolves being in the middle of a 7 game stretch holding opponents below 100 annoyed me the most.
951503782084534273 2018-01-11 17:19:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I hope those ESPN writers who wrote that Thunder vs Wolves article feel bad after last night. They really should.
951500391790850049 2018-01-11 17:05:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Just watched the game. That was fun, again.   What really stood out to me , Teague really seemed to push the pace and wasn't a ball stopper. He noticed why Tyus worked so well with the starting line-up.   He was a bit rusty at the beginning but this is a good development.
951240609939017730 2018-01-10 23:53:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon @DJSchoes @TlMBERWOLVES This.
951238845303083009 2018-01-10 23:46:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Jesus Christ that ESPN Thunder vs Wolves article is an annoying read.
951224535554109441 2018-01-10 22:49:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory I think he sold drugs while the feds were watching. That will get you 3 years .
951224095672295426 2018-01-10 22:47:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fortheidiots What have we done?
951223970518495234 2018-01-10 22:47:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Steven Adams is quietly having a career year.   Career highs in  PTS   per game  13.6 STL   per game   1.2 TRB   per game   8.6 FG % .637 eFG%.637 FT % .660 FGA  9.1 TS%  .651 PER  21.5 WS/48 .209 BPM     3.5  He, and not Melo, is the third best player on the Thunder.
951218636722790402 2018-01-10 22:26:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fortheidiots Lesson learned.
951218293116997634 2018-01-10 22:24:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I've been an asshole ( today) and I deserved it. So well played.https://twitter.com/Gon_Ride/status/951102427176099840
951216911660015616 2018-01-10 22:19:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fortheidiots That one guy who( no idea who) immediately stopped following me thought the same and he's right haha.
951216365683314690 2018-01-10 22:17:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fortheidiots Yeah. Was more in reference to people thinking Rubio is dreamy.   Those guys are fine and I hope they have a nice start to their career in Lithuania.
951216006889988097 2018-01-10 22:15:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fortheidiots Now I feel bad.
951208548062687232 2018-01-10 21:46:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon That was a while ago though and he's still alive. So he'll be allright.
951208129592741888 2018-01-10 21:44:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fortheidiots The Balls are ugly as hell though
951177931434414080 2018-01-10 19:44:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JaceFrederick @HoopsMavenHM +he's right about defensive rating systems they often are too reliant on box score stats like steals or rebounds and a lot of defensive rating systems are known for not accurately rating defensive values of players. So call BS all you want but Thibs knows his D.
951177340557684736 2018-01-10 19:42:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JaceFrederick @HoopsMavenHM You can get steal by being in the right place within a defensive system >Tyus. Or you can gamble for steals and get yourself out of position. He's not saying that guys who get a lot of steals are bad in D. So you Butler point is meaningless.
951169947379683329 2018-01-10 19:12:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Watch some games and then maybe have an opinionhttps://twitter.com/mattthew_23/status/951139024827133953
951074044589330432 2018-01-10 12:51:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA One thing is for sure. Tyus hasn't been that shooter lately.
951006959221829632 2018-01-10 08:25:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon @fortheidiots Rather have Towns-Nurkic matchup than Towns-Adams though. Friendships be damned
951005236126277632 2018-01-10 08:18:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon Chance is if we catch Spurs for 3rd place we still have the Wolves-OKC matchup.
950892457524424704 2018-01-09 00:50:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DWolfsonKSTP Tyus seems to push the pace more in transition which has been good to see. Nice to see Teague coming back though.   Thanks for the answer. Guess we'll see soon enough.
950888906358214657 2018-01-09 00:35:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @1Tyus @KarlTowns @88mugsy88 @thedailywolf @AverageJer KG looks like Starbury just told him he would leave
950886460676362240 2018-01-09 00:26:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DWolfsonKSTP You think Thibs might be starting to entertain the idea of playing Tyus more minutes/ sharing floor with the starters a bit more even when Teague is back and 100% healthy?
950882545478094848 2018-01-09 00:10:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> He threw some Thibs dust in their eyes.https://twitter.com/JaceFrederick/status/950878856944242688
950869559438987265 2018-01-09 23:19:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball Now this I can agree with.
950833565582942208 2018-01-09 20:56:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ProfCedar @Aftermath8 @JustinPinotti Minnesota Wild
950832982847381504 2018-01-09 20:53:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @ProfCedar Another possible scenario. Teague comes back and plays limited minutes. Everyone is happy becajse Tyus plays the minutes he deserves + plays with starting unit more. Bit everyone will be let down because as soon as Teague is 100% everything gets back to how it was.
950830824630472704 2018-01-09 20:45:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @ProfCedar Fair point
950829351041368064 2018-01-09 20:39:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ProfCedar @JustinPinotti I would be happy if Tyus gets to play 20 min a game. Doesn't have to start imo. Just have him on the floor with starting unit more.
950826274431361024 2018-01-09 20:27:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @ProfCedar Correct me if I'm wrong. But didn't teague have quite a good steal% too? Not saying his D is just as good.. but I thought he was in the top 10 for steals too..
950801017720967168 2018-01-09 18:46:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BreakTheHuddle Let's hope last night is the start if a long stretch of consistent quality play.
950779687294423040 2018-01-09 17:21:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JimPeteHoops   Is Tyus 'Tyler' Jones in  your top 10 nicknames after this game?
950777067448258560 2018-01-09 17:11:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Fuck that. I love Cavs Wiggins!https://twitter.com/WolfinBrabant/status/950503720529354753
950767475519639553 2018-01-09 16:33:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Hey! Wolves fans:https://youtu.be/Wcz_kDCBTBk
950758425704779776 2018-01-09 15:57:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Marple82 Reading this tweet from the Netherlands.
950719512390852608 2018-01-09 13:22:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Holy shit. That was fun. #AllEyesNorth
950517051965272076 2018-01-08 23:58:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @1stTeamNonsense True. I see it now.
950516584023552005 2018-01-08 23:56:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Wait... I see what you did there.. these are some next level mind games.   Veteran move.
950515628091301888 2018-01-08 23:52:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Hey now.... I was rooting for you to have a bad game tonight.https://twitter.com/DwyaneWade/status/950498661934518272
950515195150991360 2018-01-08 23:50:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Typing too fast and messing up the use of than/then , noticing it immediately after tweeting but not being able to edit the tweet is the most annoying thing about twitter.
950511624183525376 2018-01-08 23:36:45 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon @TlMBERWOLVES I hope he plays well. But it would be weird if he has the best game of the season against the Cavs, again. Let's hope for a good Wiggins game a la the Pelicans ( with a little less fga) + a wolves win.   Than i think no one has complains
950510975224111104 2018-01-08 23:34:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon @TlMBERWOLVES True. Win/win
950508667387949058 2018-01-08 23:25:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JohnEPalm @GameofReindeers Well, you answered your own question. That is the reason people think he is anything other than trash.
950507844486475783 2018-01-08 23:21:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JohnEPalm @GameofReindeers Right now Belly's trash. Agreed. I dunno if that's sustainable.
950504420470607872 2018-01-08 23:08:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon *great game with efficient scoring like every Wiggins Cavs game ( as you pointed out)
950503720529354753 2018-01-08 23:05:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon It would make me feel worse if he has a good game against the Cavs again.   It's hard not to think it's an effort thing with him in that case. And I'm one of the few Wiggins supporters around these parts.
950503032919330817 2018-01-08 23:02:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JohnEPalm @GameofReindeers Niko has been good this year.  It's not like belly has a huge contract or high usg% and is expected to be a star. He had value as floor stretching PF before his injury. Plus he moved the ball quite well and was essentially a valuable role player for this team.
950488076220026880 2018-01-08 22:03:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting *to
950488037187780608 2018-01-08 22:03:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting They have too though. That is the problem.
950487082211954688 2018-01-08 21:59:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting Yeah.. good point.
950483463479681027 2018-01-08 21:44:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I'm sorry to say this. But if the U.S. elect Oprah as president right after Trump... I think a big part of this world wil have a hard time taking you guys seriously anymore. The Rock or Kanye though..

950409911527145476 2018-01-08 16:52:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer The thing is...  seeing who's getting undeservedly a lot of votes  motivated me to fan vote so players who deserve it might get in.. which makes me a part of something I think is ridiculous.   I'm weak.
950406234007580672 2018-01-08 16:37:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon 'I have a surprise for everyone! You get a drone strike! And you ! And you!'
950147488631095297 2018-01-07 23:29:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Look I get your point. I understand that he's in a tough position. Part of being a basketball player though is dealing with press, especially when you have a dad who can't live out of the limelight. He should learn to handle it well. You think he did. I think he didn't.
950141521386500105 2018-01-07 23:06:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @22wiggins @rizzle37 Yeah I'm sure he needs your advice.
950140582898425858 2018-01-07 23:02:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @22wiggins Good game last night! Keep up the good work.
950121218669273088 2018-01-07 21:45:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> There are different ways to answer those questions and stay neutral. He could have backed Walton more. Family is there no matter what. You can say about Lavar what you want but he seems to be there for his kids.  Shouldn't have to be too scared to step on his fathers toes.

950103165231357953 2018-01-07 20:33:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Timberwolves @KarlTowns being a good teammate in more ways than one I see.
950100046736969728 2018-01-07 20:21:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball A.He's a professional. How many of us were that when we were 19? People hold him to different standards B.There are better ways to handle this than saying 'I'll play for anybody.  I don't decide who the coach is'  C.Why assume he doesn't know enough about life to take a position?
950097529332535297 2018-01-07 20:11:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball @KardiacAve I'm not.
950097123365806082 2018-01-07 20:09:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball I get what you're saying though. It isn't at much criticism of Lonzo just that he will have to figure out together with Lakers staff how to deal with this.   He will not have to do this alone.
950096809367621632 2018-01-07 20:08:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball How many of us played in the NBA ?
950096239642710016 2018-01-07 20:06:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball All fair points. I'm not saying he's not in a tough position. But being in the NBA you will have to grow up fast and he needs to find a way to deal with his dad while being on the Lakers. This isn't it.
950095106807394304 2018-01-07 20:01:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> He could have handled this a lot better though. Not the best interview. https://twitter.com/HPbasketball/status/950093863527399425
950083114994421761 2018-01-07 19:14:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory Stop giving him attention.

Agreed annd when he drives I hope he goes stronger to the rack.. too many lay- ins that miss
950039777302269952 2018-01-07 16:21:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Looks like Wolves have some gems on the roster. Hooe Thibs takes notice.https://twitter.com/nbagleague/status/949868199440351232
950027883250114560 2018-01-07 15:34:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GoodmanESPN @ChiefsInsider Ssttt don't say that. He might do it.

But him having 20 pts on 20 fga while Towns had 11 fga bugs me a bit.
950026093653905409 2018-01-07 15:27:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA Yes even though I don't know what he did last night.
950025602379153408 2018-01-07 15:25:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DerekJamesNBA Never mind. We posted at the same time..  I think we agree here.
950024767121313792 2018-01-07 15:22:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DerekJamesNBA + I agree with everything you say about Tyus. I just don't see how any of your arguments support the point that having a good D rating with Tyus is more impressive than having a good D rating with Teague?
950023887680692225 2018-01-07 15:18:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DerekJamesNBA I could be mistaken but aren't tyus and Teague both 6 ft 2?
950023082244263938 2018-01-07 15:15:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @RKalland @DerekJamesNBA Agreed. But how is it more impressive then, that the Wolves have a good d rating with Tyus?
950022621864910853 2018-01-07 15:13:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I think he wasn't too shabby last night as well. I take back what I said.   He had some fun defesensive plays ( fouling cousins and was a +4 )https://twitter.com/thedailywolf/status/949805170745016320
950021973140271104 2018-01-07 15:11:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DerekJamesNBA I have the feeling Tyus is better on D than Teague. So I don't see how that makes i more impressive even though Teague + Tyus > Tyus + Brooks.
950003624331169792 2018-01-07 13:58:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA But Giannis is MVP?
950003059429707776 2018-01-07 13:55:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Wiggins can't have 22 FGA with Towns having 11
950001395297587200 2018-01-07 13:49:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> My second prediction of the year and I was close, again. I think I'm gonna bet on some games going forward.pic.twitter.com/XyudKPA9m6
949996147128635392 2018-01-07 13:28:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Starters minutes:  Taj 34 Wiggins 35 Towns 35 Jones 33 Butler 32  Bench minutes :  Belly 12 Dieng 21 Brooks 15 Crawford 20  MGH & Aldrich 2  Nothing wrong with this minutes distribution.
949996144284880898 2018-01-07 13:28:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> For all the people saying fire Thibs after an awesome game for not putting in the bench earlier.   Two things:  - Pelicans almost got back in the game after a 34 pt lead with Taj and Wiggins on the bench. Pelicans brought it back to a 17 pt game.
949992884199141377 2018-01-07 13:15:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Man oh man. Towns is playing like the best BIG man of the NBA's big men.   The Wolves D the last five games has been terrific and Towns has been a big reason why.   He outplayed Cousins and Davis. Davis was invisible and Cousins was terrible on defense.
949817529597399050 2018-01-06 01:38:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BenSchleuss But then it will be even brighter...
949816741319847936 2018-01-06 01:35:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ekoreen And how does it work?
949815393090228225 2018-01-06 01:30:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @WolvesCountry Butler and Wiggins will feast. Pelicans have no wings to counter their size / skill.
949808319157424128 2018-01-06 01:02:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Kyle_Ratke He's right.
949808076336623617 2018-01-06 01:01:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I hope Wiggins has a chip on his shoulder after last nights game.   He shifted the momentum in Bostons favour with this terrible sequence: letting Smart drive to the basket with ease and then grabbing his own inbounds pass resulting in a turnover.
949806291542822912 2018-01-06 00:54:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf He had his moments, you're right. Looked a lot better than earlier games. Remains a big liability on D though ( although even on D he made some ok plays)   Let's see how tonight goes. Rondo is easier to guard than Kyrie so Tyus probably won't get in foul trouble.
949804327589249024 2018-01-06 00:46:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DerekJamesNBA Wolves need him back asap
949803301733896192 2018-01-06 00:42:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf Wolves might be better of playing Lucas |||  instead of Brooks.
949794115952234496 2018-01-06 00:05:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @nba_poop_hat @lap_boy He freezes himself out. He needs confidence to perform. But his confidence comes and goes..Not the first time this has happened.  Last few games he just seemed to show no effort at all..

949659080951558144 2018-01-06 15:09:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Jeff van Gundy was raving about Towns all game and rightfully so.   Good to see Towns playing like this on a nationally televised game.
949657420170715136 2018-01-06 15:02:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Towns was amazing. Too bad he was the only Wolves player that had a good game.

949349325808848896 2018-01-05 18:38:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 @GameofReindeers I thought you really liked Draymond Green..  so..
949349096992727040 2018-01-05 18:37:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @tribjazz Iverson is the one that bugs you? What about Irving...
949348432581398528 2018-01-05 18:34:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 @GameofReindeers I think in this context i've been a bit too nice and I don't want no weird pics in my dm's  ( yeah I was suprised too..it was the first one to come up. Best GIF I've ever sent)

949345688357359616 2018-01-05 18:23:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @Aftermath8 Yeah he unknowingly gave the right answer. Which doesn't help the situation.

949313995860783106 2018-01-05 16:17:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @JustinPinotti @TravLyleCzech + would have doubled the tree point makes.
949313869335420934 2018-01-05 16:17:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @JustinPinotti @TravLyleCzech One 3 would have been enough
949311640222294016 2018-01-05 16:08:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @TravLyleCzech @JustinPinotti And last game was one of those games we really needed Teague.
949272862220746752 2018-01-05 13:34:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers It does sound great. I think it does beat the cosplay/marvel fan with the spongebon handle.   Close call though.
949271437453471744 2018-01-05 13:28:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers Ah you have a like from the DC fan one. I got a message from a similar looking Marvel fan.  She's obviously way more fun
949204287015571458 2018-01-05 09:01:52 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Carmelo Anthony getting more votes than Towns is equally as annoying as Ball getting more votes than Butler.
949202582458785793 2018-01-05 08:55:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> 'I'm a big baller so I vote for Zo'. Ugh. Fan voting sucks.

948754580673789952 2018-01-03 03:14:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @timfaklis @DrLwyrIndnChf @BreakTheHuddle Thibs Wolves shoot a lot more 3's than Flips wolves.   Most frustrating was when Prince stepped inside the thee point line for the long two.   Flips offense was beautiful at times but was even more dependant on long 2's and way less effective. That is not all because of personnel
948752836145266688 2018-01-03 03:07:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Maybe it's time to call Anthony Brown? You know... that guy that shot 10x more 3's than the Wolves in a game this week for a team called the Wolves.

948678374641238016 2018-01-03 22:12:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 Have you read the statement of his daughter. Gives some insight..  This is a situation I will not judge. It seems the last wife of Sager is the one who has caused all of this.   But hell...who knows. It's allways he said  she said with these kind of things.
948654058927255552 2018-01-03 20:35:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TravLyleCzech @Aftermath8 Isn't ISO and thus Jimmy's bailing out..  more effective and more common in the Playoffs?
948649530530107393 2018-01-03 20:17:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TravLyleCzech @Aftermath8 That's not....very optimistic. What makes you have such little confidence in this roster?
948649024789368832 2018-01-03 20:15:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TravLyleCzech It will be pure joy though when the Wolves prove the national media wrong in the playoffs by beating OKC in the first round
948638899643043840 2018-01-03 19:35:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DaneMooreNBA @molin1106 Hah! Yeah.. Sometimes I should really wait a few seconds before tweeting or saying stuff in general.    Loved his articles at Canis and he's doing some good work at zonecoverage.
948636512643624960 2018-01-03 19:25:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DaneMooreNBA No , it's all good. And when I complain about a lack of context I should've bothered to look up said context.   Looking forward to reading it. I'm  a little worried about Brooks/Crawford at the 1.. so curious to read what your point of view is.
948635266822098945 2018-01-03 19:20:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DaneMooreNBA I will do that! I'll check it out tonight.
948634845676294144 2018-01-03 19:19:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DaneMooreNBA That's easy. Showing a possession he ruined. He also had a good P&R sequence where he gave the assist.   He sucks. He really does. But showing one possession of all three makes it easy to shape the narrative anyway you want.
948633146970595329 2018-01-03 19:12:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Wasn't Paul Pierce stabbed once?  That makes this article title a little weird.https://twitter.com/kaibosworth/status/948615786708525056

948590787226488832 2018-01-03 16:24:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ProfCedar Change allegiances in Europe when supporting a football club and you will never hear the end of it. NBA is more of a players league it seems.I think football culture made me follow the Wolves after KG left. And that made me watch losing basketball for years/in middle of the night
948581723910148099 2018-01-03 15:48:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti Jumanji 2? The trailer looks badddd  Does it have anything to do with the first movie/ the game?
948580592173682688 2018-01-03 15:43:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball nr 1 is right.
948579607921545224 2018-01-03 15:39:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @neilorfield @JustinPinotti I don't know man. Just looking at his defense he has been less impressive. Maybe because Towns has picked it up the difference doesn't show anymore.Last season he looked so good on D probably because he was playing next to Towns and you could see him do stuff you wished towns did
948575626365108224 2018-01-03 15:23:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @neilorfield What about Di..  never mind.  I don't know about Dieng this year.. he's inconsistent and by eye test he does look worse than last year.   He was very good last game though.
948574791207964672 2018-01-03 15:20:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Smh. Thibs is playing the half time entertainment too many minutes while he's injured.https://twitter.com/tweetdavebenz/status/948278094619607041
948566706854785024 2018-01-03 14:48:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting To me still one of the biggest what ifs. What if he didn't start his career for the Kings? His rookie season as PG he was amazing and then they forcesd him to play out of position and he never was the same again.
948543884048650240 2018-01-03 13:17:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @freetyus @JustinPinotti Such a good movie too
948340125729280000 2018-01-02 23:47:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer Yeah. Same happened to me. It got me triggered.
948319531285516288 2018-01-02 22:26:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @freetyus And don't forget his domestic violence history.
948311711110615046 2018-01-02 21:55:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @AllThingsMN His team defense has improved a lot. By eye test. So does his passing. He's making a lot more smart plays and knows when is the right time to kick out.   Needs some time though. When Butler took more of a back seat in the beginning of the season Wigs was looking best of all 3
948306321467682816 2018-01-02 21:33:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @timelesssports_ Kg , Shaq, Payton
948295941299343362 2018-01-02 20:52:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting Ah it's from.november. Sort of comforting to see that poll is from a while ago....   Still though.
948295360321122304 2018-01-02 20:50:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting Oh man...the comments are even worse..
948295029226917888 2018-01-02 20:48:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting This is...   I can't find words...  I hope they mean they expected worse..because this is just..   FUCK THEM. BUTLER IS THE BEST
948280305026326530 2018-01-02 19:50:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @Aftermath8 That's allways the point people make when defending Ricky. Maybe when Smitch, Flip, Adelman, Thibs and now Snyder coached a style that didn't fit Ricky.. it is Ricky's playing style that is the problem not the coache's.
948261174294048768 2018-01-02 18:34:16 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @buddy1234566 @IKnowPsych @JustinPinotti This never gets old
948255216738152449 2018-01-02 18:10:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Tyus_Jones_Stan Finally they've put OKC below Minnesota. That has annoyed me all year..
948248580753690624 2018-01-02 17:44:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @anthonyVslater @outsidethenba That is so Durant though. That two random guys calling him crybaby can piss him off that bad...
948224210681425920 2018-01-02 16:07:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I just love Thibs.https://twitter.com/JaceFrederick/status/948067367569051648
948217394635444225 2018-01-02 15:40:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @88mugsy88 @Patrick_Fenelon @AverageJer It's been a little better lately. It seems.. it might be me commenting less on Canis though.   But wolves fans in general seem a bit more happy.   Just wait till the next loss. It will be mayhem again
948215769069948928 2018-01-02 15:33:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Dude just played an awesome game. You can give him some kudos from time to time.   Weird timing to double down on your Wiggins qritique/hatred
948214716647821316 2018-01-02 15:29:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> City of God/ Cidade de Deushttps://twitter.com/Adamski/status/947911051521146880
948206254723358720 2018-01-02 14:56:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @boognish1972 Rificulous take. He finishes well at the rim...something Rubio has never done + his 3pt% this season is quite good. Looking for the pass too often is his one Ricky tendency this season.
948029456320552960 2018-01-01 03:13:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @timelesssports_ Shaqs kobe diss track. Because, well we're living in a time where more people know Lavar Ball than Lonzo and like talking about them more than the amazing rookie class this actually is >Simmons/Mitchell
948015314624708608 2018-01-01 02:17:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I love Cole Aldrich this season.  When he was sitting next to Jordan Hill last season his body language was hard to watch.   Now he is the best cheerleader on the bench + is the first to high five teammates who walk to the bench.  Professional.He doesn't play but keeps spirit up.
947999579663937537 2018-01-01 01:14:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BuckyWTGoodHair @GameofReindeers I'm intrigued. I think I'm gonna watch it now
947986725690896384 2018-01-01 00:23:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BuckyWTGoodHair @GameofReindeers I skipped that one..saw the beginning and decided to watch the next episode...  Should i watch it? Or does it really suck?
947565343895105542 2017-12-31 20:29:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon Is a greenland shark  black? haha
947564375082184704 2017-12-31 20:25:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon If I remember correctly they have found a black shark a little while ago which was over 400 years old.
947534806249885697 2017-12-31 18:27:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Thread on why @KarlTowns deserves your #NBAVotehttps://twitter.com/WolfinBrabant/status/947530900908199937
947532597990707200 2017-12-31 18:19:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Oh and ofcourse this means. #NBAVote @KarlTowns
947531929678766080 2017-12-31 18:16:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius Nice! Might check a game sometime.   Never knew him...but he's born not far from where I live.
947531773575122945 2017-12-31 18:15:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @djhammer59 Thanks for the insight. Very interesting.
947531669262790656 2017-12-31 18:15:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @marqualler Yes he is. Which is very encouraging.
947530928263454720 2017-12-31 18:12:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> All in all.Towns is having a sneakily good season and let's not take him for granted. He is awesome and a big reason for the Wolves succes this year.
947530925411389440 2017-12-31 18:12:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> With all of the talk of Butler doing everything to help his team win ( deservingly so) Towns TPA is actually higher than Butler's.   Towns 102.61 Butler   86.61  Towns is ranked 15th.
947530923343532032 2017-12-31 18:12:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Towns is awesome at post ups and very efficient but he is doing what he needs to do to help the team win.  He sacrifices a lot and that needs to be recognized. Towns does not deserve the criticism he got this year.
947530921342889984 2017-12-31 18:12:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Stretching the floor is very valuable with this roster. Especially when he shares the court with Taj, Butler & Wiggins. One of Taj or Towns needs to stretch the floor to create space for Butler/Wiggins or else defense will just clog the paint
947530919145099265 2017-12-31 18:12:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> He has looked much improved on D lately. He keeps his feet set more which allows him to help and get back to his own man.   I would like to see him get more post ups..but he is the best 3pt shooter of the team which isn't ideal but not his fault either.
947530916985016320 2017-12-31 18:12:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> He is 17th in the league in PER, 14th in TS% , 15th in eFG%,  6th in win shares, 15th in WS/48, 13th in VORP.  Only in BPM he is not in the top 20.  His RPM is 2.14 adding 3.80 wins. With a slightly negative DRPM of -0.18 which will most likely improve.
947530915152121856 2017-12-31 18:12:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> His usage is down from 27.5 last year to 22.9 this year. Having to share the court with Butler and a fine post player in Taj will do that.   His advanced numbers are equally great  His TS% is at a career high .629 PER           23.1 WS/48     .195 BPM          4.1 VORP        2.0
947530912719392768 2017-12-31 18:12:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> He's doing all of that in 35.8 minutes per game. Which isn't abnormally high for a player his caliber ( Thibs is doing fine)   He has 4.5 FTA and is shooting .828 %  (His per 36 numbers are the same considering he is playing 35.8 minutes. )
947530910299193344 2017-12-31 18:12:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> His eFG % is at a career high .585 His 30t % is at a career high .404 % while shooting a career high 3.8 3's per game.   He has 14.2 FGA per game which is actually higher than in his rookie year.
947530900908199937 2017-12-31 18:12:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Towns is having himself a very good season. The criticism of him being bad on D and his touches being low have sort of overshadowed this.   He's averaging   20.4 pts per game 11.5 rebounds per game 2.1 assists per game 1.5 blocks per game 0.9 steals per game
947515966195462144 2017-12-31 17:13:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Question for all the Minnesota Twins watching Wolves fans:  Do you know Bert Blyleven? How good of a player was he?
947505624040034304 2017-12-31 16:31:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AndrewDBailey Agreed 100%
947504998572810243 2017-12-31 16:29:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AndrewDBailey @k_searle87 He knows his spots and where he can influence the game. His maturity in that regard might be his best skill
947504689096089601 2017-12-31 16:28:16 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AndrewDBailey I get the jazz fan side of things though. Mitchell has been amazing. The used arguments are ridiculous though.   But what a rookie class this year. Love it.
947503808690774016 2017-12-31 16:24:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AndrewDBailey Some people. The game is still more than shooting three on a high %. The game has changed but it is still basketball..
947496993462669312 2017-12-31 15:57:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> And he didn't just coach the best dutch teams. Far from it. Groningen was last champions in 1982 when Boot came back in 2001 and instantly made them champions.  He was on a different level. He forgot more about basketball than all dutch coaches combined ever knew.
947494505716047873 2017-12-31 15:47:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> He was heralded by the european top teams but chose to only coach teams in the Netherlands and Belgium.
947493587297734656 2017-12-31 15:44:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> National champion in 1979, 1980, 1983, 1984, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1995, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004  Cup winner in 1992, 1997, 1999  FEB cup winner in 2001  Coach of the year in 1979, 1980, 1983, 1986, 1987, 1993, 2001  Having succes in the 70's , 80's , 90's and 00's.
947491706731196417 2017-12-31 15:36:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> He changed coaching in all of sports in the Netherlands. Football & baseball coaches tried to emulate his approach.
947491704499818501 2017-12-31 15:36:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Dutch basketball never reached the levels it reached with Boot ever again. He was a visionary. But he was tough and controversial. Thibs looks soft in comparison.
947491702431940609 2017-12-31 15:36:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> He was known for his sabbatical years. He spend a full year with van Gaal and vice versa.
947491699856723968 2017-12-31 15:36:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> He is seen as Coach of the Century in the Netherlands. Beating the likes of van Gaal, Hiddink, Beenhakker, Michels et al.
947491698036396032 2017-12-31 15:36:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> In 23 seasons he finished 1st, 2nd or 3rd 23 times.   He won the championship 14 times and was in the playoffs finals 19 times.   He coached 1179 games and has won 828 of them. Finishing his career with a .772 winning %
947491696249589760 2017-12-31 15:36:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> 2001 Beat Fenerbahce in the quarter finals of Euroleague/Europa cup with the Amsterdam Astronauts resulting in the firing of their head coach and best player  Won national championships with Den Helder, Den Bosch, Amsterdam, Groningen, Oostende
947491694366351362 2017-12-31 15:36:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> 1979 coached Den Bosch to 2nd place in the European cup winners cup/Saporta cup  1990 coached Den Helder and made the final four of the European cup winners cup/Saporta cup
947491692105687040 2017-12-31 15:36:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Just throwing this out there. A little thread.  Ton Boot one of the best European basketball coaches ever. He led dutch basketball teams to european succes multiple times. That with teams playing in the mediocre dutch league.
947483936967593984 2017-12-31 15:05:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer Wish my HS had a team. I was the only ball player. I would have been the man.

947308660098822145 2017-12-30 03:29:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Donovan Mitchell half rookie-half amazing.
947171273846730757 2017-12-30 18:23:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf That was so much more fun to watch than this season %
947148326851444736 2017-12-30 16:52:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ThatSixersGuy Oh and btw. Women allmost never flop, ever. In any sport.   That's awesome. Even in football they show us men how to play sports without all the theatricals
947147595268452352 2017-12-30 16:49:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ThatSixersGuy It used to be my number one argument to my friends when comparing it to football and saying basketball is better. They're soft allways flopping. Real men play basketball yadayadayada.   Yeah..never mind.
947147076865089538 2017-12-30 16:47:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball The Spurs in general have played him really really well.
947146802930778113 2017-12-30 16:46:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I like him. A lot. Only current Wolf I have a jersey of tbh and I think he will be integral to any teams succes the next few years.   But nah. Let's not give him something he doesn't deserve, again.He got himself a nice contract. Now let him prove he's an All Star before voting.https://twitter.com/Timberwolves/status/947145166703357952

946778198523764738 2017-12-29 16:21:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Maldini, Cannavaro, Stam et al. Probably have something to say about that.
946773918765015041 2017-12-29 16:04:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @bballbreakdown Good breakdown btw. Raptors have been really impressive. But with them ...I gotta see it happen innthe playoffs for once before I belive they are for real. Although less ISO and a surging Derozan bodes well for them
946773068550156290 2017-12-29 16:01:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @bballbreakdown Since the Twin Cities are further North than Toronto ; )

946762907492257797 2017-12-29 15:20:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus Well. That was fun while it lasted.
946592420845752327 2017-12-28 04:03:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @jayemmert The Wolves played great on offense in the first half. Yesterday they did too. Plus they have been very effective all season. So Thibs csn obviously coach offense.
946586872142278656 2017-12-28 03:41:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> After watching the Rockets- Celtics 4th quarter I feel a lot better already
946563242943569926 2017-12-28 02:07:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> One of Taj / Towns needs to stretch the floor to create space for Wiggins/ Butler. And Taj has been good in the post but man... I wanna see some more Towns post ups.
946559407889973249 2017-12-28 01:52:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Towns is playing good D. But being on the court with Brooks + Crawford will fuck up everyones D rating.
946557782463074305 2017-12-28 01:45:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Jason Kidd's best coaching of his career is throwing water on the floor. That's it.  He should be fired soon.
946551753662660608 2017-12-28 01:21:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Loving Wolves D right now!
946551522304851968 2017-12-28 01:20:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Accidentaly put on the Bucks commentary. I kind of like them and they really like the Wolves.
946550914340544512 2017-12-28 01:18:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA @Real_Jorg I thought he played quite good D for stretches  yesterday. Well by the eye test
946541648145678336 2017-12-28 00:41:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer Haha I guess i mean what you see in the basement. Although this would be far more interesting.
946541068358692865 2017-12-28 00:39:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer Emulate what you see on the screen in your livingroom
946540892571209730 2017-12-28 00:38:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Do Wolves eat Deer?
946540396108279809 2017-12-28 00:36:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer Yeah the street basketball name thing made me choose Towns because it sounded the best..   But i'm really not sure either. KG was and will allways be my favourite. Few candidates though: Butler Towns Adams Mitchell Kawhi And many more... tough to choose

946429109370019840 2017-12-28 17:14:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 @HaugenND I didn't vote for him. I think the best players should be all stars and the fan voting system is dumb anyways.  But you saying you agree with not voting for Wiggins is like the least surprising thing ever.
946428033250004992 2017-12-28 17:10:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 @HaugenND Surprising

946210744680550402 2017-12-27 02:46:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @freetyus Yeah, but the commentator saying Rubio was never known as a good defender is ridiculous.
946148410775793664 2017-12-27 22:38:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I wanna see Wiggins dunk on Jokic tonight.   It might be me....but I can't think of any memorable Wiggins dunk this year. Just feels weird.   He needs to attack the rim more. Part of what makes him a special player is his ability to drive to the rim at will.
946140108775919623 2017-12-27 22:05:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SLAMonline @timelesssports_ Get Kobe off of there. Ridiculous to rate him top 4 of all time.
946138698663583744 2017-12-27 22:00:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @nba_poop_hat - He improves team D by a lot.  - Leads by example. Allways 100% effort - Holds other players accountable - Knows Thibs defensive sheme - Is a great distributor/ underrated playmaker - Gets BUCKETS when the team needs it the most - Post game interview master
946108620365881344 2017-12-27 20:00:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Okay. I'm gonna say it. I like the City jerseys.   The grey actually looks kind of nice. Clean look. I might buy one.   The Wolves had a succesfull rebrand this season.
945779076488400896 2017-12-26 22:11:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JaceFrederick And then he yells Freeze! And everybody stops running..   Oh wait..  that's ICE...never mind.

945757476246433798 2017-12-26 20:45:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @UnderdogsSports I think a few more than 2 more touches for Towns. But I generally like the distribution. Sharing the wealth.
945633327335305217 2017-12-26 12:32:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> This was hard to listen to.   As Thibs would say : Do your job and watch some fucking games.https://twitter.com/brittrobson/status/945502154474819585

943247592951111686 2017-12-19 22:32:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Beating a division rival that is legitimately a good team is FUN.   JIMMY G. BUCKETS IS FUN.https://twitter.com/WolfinBrabant/status/943247177161363456
943247177161363456 2017-12-19 22:30:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I think people are focusing on what could/should go better with this years Wolves. Where the last few years they focused on what went right. Because , well...we sucked and there were no real expectations.   Some are going a little overboard though and stopped having fun.
943244994718109696 2017-12-19 22:21:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ProfCedar @Libraryben @marqualler @JustinPinotti @canishoopus They've beat a division rival who are at fifth place, last night.   A good win. Maybe they will just be allright after this little rough stretch.
943241581653577728 2017-12-19 22:08:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jakepaynting This is so weird. Harrison Barnes is a low efficient mid range shooter like Wiggins. Basically the same player with less upside.   Recency bias.   Wiggins will get his shit together.
943241095424638976 2017-12-19 22:06:16 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Timberwolves @tweetdavebenz @mhochimoto They did. Last night.

941723435813801984 2017-12-15 17:35:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @1stTeamNonsense @HaugenND Butler is the one that matters most.

941721162719158274 2017-12-15 17:26:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Dunn is good this year. It's still questionable if he would contribute to winning ball. Zach Lavine didn't last year and is a big question mark. Markkanen seems like a good prospect.   But Butler... come on dude. Without him we would maybe hover around. 500 somewhere.

941296883137499136 2017-12-14 13:20:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @88mugsy88 Towns actually played good D when guarding Embiid.
941101069060444166 2017-12-13 00:22:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA Without context this suggests something totally different than what he was actually saying.

941054860388167680 2017-12-13 21:18:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Jimmy G. Buckets:  38 points 6 rebounds 3 assists 1 steal 2 clutch 3's 1 Simmons completely shut down 1 quality post game interview  I hope this guy stays in Minnesota forever.
941050637877481475 2017-12-13 21:02:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @1stTeamNonsense @rodman99mn @JustinPinotti Oh I agree.They just need to fall.I'm not saying Wiggins is bad because Butler.  But at the beginning of the year it was like Wiggins was the only one feeling comfortable adjusting to the new starting five. Now he's struggling while Butler is thriving. Just a bit odd.
941045814390149122 2017-12-13 20:43:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Great podcast. Some really interesting stuff about playing under  Thibs and minutes played per game. https://twitter.com/loseehafer/status/941033728863821824
941039671987097600 2017-12-13 20:18:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA @MannyHill84 @tomrloftus I think Lebron can be a counter argument to everything
941038633485848576 2017-12-13 20:14:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul Don't forget it was actually Rubio for Teague + OKC pick. Is CJ + Rubio better than Teague + Added cheap talent?  Possible. But with this offense... I doubt the difference will be that great.  For short term, probably. But POBO needs to look long term too. He did that i this case
941036815494107137 2017-12-13 20:07:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul Rubio isn't exactly ballin in Utah + the other option George Hill...well we dodged a bullet with him
941036571419201536 2017-12-13 20:06:16 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @THalfCourtPress Their new GM is awesome though
941036525466374145 2017-12-13 20:06:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @THalfCourtPress Let's not forget the Nets
941035769766047746 2017-12-13 20:03:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> All in all I think Thibs+ Layden haven't made bad decisions regarding the roster.   Let's wait till after the trade deadline to say he is the worst GM/POBO ever. I think it is expected the Wolves will make some roster adjustments this season.
941035327497605120 2017-12-13 20:01:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> And Teague to me seems to be the right decision. He can be frustrating at times. But just imagine the spacing of this team with Rubio at the point. He is a better fit and he has shown his value with his 3pt % + him attacking the basket
941034811187228672 2017-12-13 19:59:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> POBO Thibs also traded for Butler.   Is he really as bad as POBO as people are saying?  I doubt it.
941034595918721024 2017-12-13 19:58:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Taj is playing above expectation and he does fill a need. Crawford has value as a scorer of the bench and do you really think you can have world beaters for the MLE? And with the draft going for best player available is a sound strategy. Jury is still out on Patton
941034107743727616 2017-12-13 19:56:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Remember. Minnesota is not a winning destination yet and players choosing Houston etc. over Minnesota was expected. Tundra tax is real + when Bazz was signed for vet min. most people complaining now thought it was a good signing.
941033815400701953 2017-12-13 19:55:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Thibs tried to get Mbah,CJ, Allen etc. But they choose other teams and/ or Thibs didn't wanna give up the OKC pick.   The one he has no control over and the other was a good decision.
940994301634449409 2017-12-13 17:18:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @1stTeamNonsense @JustinPinotti @rodman99mn Did his slump begin when Butler decided to be Jimmy Buckets again? I have the feeling Wiggins play on O regressed after Butler's improved...  i might be wrong though.
940988968530792448 2017-12-13 16:57:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @brittrobson @MAKeliher Wolves are great this year in the clutch though

940913116761739264 2017-12-13 11:55:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> This was an awesome game. The Defense looked good. Scrappy play by the Wolves.   Too bad the 3's weren't falling and OT was necessary.
940902093686300673 2017-12-13 11:11:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ontheprowl_MN @Tprat33 He had a good defensive game. Know your timing when criticizing players.

940230852830777344 2017-12-11 14:44:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> People say the NBA is a players league. It is.

What Pop is doing (again!) and what Stevens is doing in Boston is truly amazing.

939836105045807104 2017-12-10 12:36:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> God damn it Grizzlies. Shoot some goddamn free throws.
939618500150218752 2017-12-09 22:11:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ProfCedar I respect that. Context matters..
939617385610440704 2017-12-09 22:06:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ProfCedar His best season he scored 18 goals for Tottenham. As a striker. That's mediocre.  I don't know..I never really liked seeing him play. But I get it if you're a Tottenham supporter...

939611520719343618 2017-12-09 21:43:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ProfCedar What do you like about him so much?   He is such a mediocre player imo.
939609506870431744 2017-12-09 21:35:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Sean Marks is doing some good work in Brooklyn.https://twitter.com/hoopshype/status/939608090386640896

939557280953044992 2017-12-09 18:08:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> You can. I did. A lot of days.https://twitter.com/Pon_Da_Replay_/status/939361980992942081
939307135569219584 2017-12-08 01:34:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BreakTheHuddle Towns being so happy for a teammate is what makes this even better. I hope to see wolves players have that kind of fun again on the court soon. Together..not with Deandre Jordan
938939085011476480 2017-12-07 01:11:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Towns had a good game against the Clippers.
938562275786543104 2017-12-06 00:14:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Zach Lowe on Curry: " Switch a bigger guy onto Curry, and he'll keep moving until the behemoth can no longer keep up:"  Video to support his point: Behemoth blocks Curry
938557058676396032 2017-12-06 23:53:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA Time difference. Here I am wondering the same thing..a few hours later

938555319579537409 2017-12-06 23:46:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA Allways weird to me when I see an American ask that question.
938544373100437504 2017-12-06 23:03:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JBrown507 @streethistory Yeah. With some team here in the Netherlands. Quality teams here.
938506230766690310 2017-12-06 20:31:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Stopped listening to the Ringer after : "Shabazz is not a bad player".
938499237511385094 2017-12-06 20:03:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I only see some speculation here + tweets from other writers. Hardly a good breakdown.  But it makes you wonder..https://twitter.com/sam_amick/status/938476125528907776

938167317057474560 2017-12-05 22:04:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @nba_poop_hat @IKnowPsych @JustinPinotti He had a nice pass out of the double team to butler last night in the 4th q.

938150533864546306 2017-12-05 20:58:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @nba_poop_hat @Michelobius It was necessary. Ever since the Rubio trade, being critical is replaced with being cynical by a lot of people. It makes it less fun to discuss the Wolves on Canis lately imho.I try sometimes but I get depressed real fast.Too bad. Let's hope it changes when the playoffs arrive

937993146549637120 2017-12-05 10:32:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I don't know what is less enjoyable. The Wolves play lately or everyone's hot takes about the Wolves.

937783064708763648 2017-12-04 20:38:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @THalfCourtPress He's also Aldrich's agent. That counts

937761712438210567 2017-12-04 19:13:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I don't know shit about Football but I see some Vikings stuff on Wolves twitter now and then and people seem to love Case Keenum.  I do know Skip Bayless and I hate to break it to you guys but this means that Case Keenum sucks.https://twitter.com/RealSkipBayless/status/937429294745231360
937760318939455488 2017-12-04 19:07:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> The wiggins floater from long-two distance is my new favourite thing in the world.
937751933984694273 2017-12-04 18:34:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @KarlTowns @thedailywolf He did a lot of that; watching.
937009618928226305 2017-12-02 17:24:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Remember: When the offense is good it is because talent. When the D is bad it is because of Thibs.
936992881272938496 2017-12-02 16:18:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> If this is your opinion about Jim Pete. I hate to break it to you..but you don't know shit about basketball. https://twitter.com/RyanBerg6/status/936836453157388288

936012901353250817 2017-11-29 23:24:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DaneMooreNBA Nice read.
935989849378689025 2017-11-29 21:52:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf Fist bump in his face
935957408907743233 2017-11-29 19:43:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers You should have
935956557975703555 2017-11-29 19:40:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers I thought you said America doesn't need royalty
935820056285630464 2017-11-29 10:37:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf @berggalicious This was one of his better overall performances on D.
935693717394067457 2017-11-28 02:15:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> The bench really misses Tyus and     Belly.
935684026240729090 2017-11-28 01:37:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Great first quarter. Wolves are contesting shots, moving the ball. Overall they just look focused.
935680655152832512 2017-11-28 01:23:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Towns is looking good on D

935665351639134208 2017-11-28 00:22:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Thibs laughing when talking about Scott Brooks..  But what really stands out:  Instead of being critical of the last few performances on the defensive end he focuses on the good stretch on D before the Miami game. Positive reinforcement from Thibs here.https://twitter.com/Kyle_Ratke/status/935661261509091328
935659421912494085 2017-11-28 23:59:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Yeah.. good idea. Starve innocent North- Koreans. That will solve this ridiculous conflict.
935656183045738497 2017-11-28 23:46:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I asked my father if he had a theory. He said he doesn't give a fuck about the Timberwolves.https://twitter.com/thedailywolf/status/935625753181474816

935571688695259136 2017-11-28 18:10:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @GameofReindeers I think Harry, Willem-Alexander, Filip or whatever royal dudes and gals there  are. They would all be an upgrade. I think it's safe to say...you do need some royalty besides hollywood

935570177768517632 2017-11-28 18:04:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Timberwolves @BreakTheHuddle @UnderdogsSports @BenSchleuss @SwanInSaintPaul Yeah i would take westbrook too

935569601005486081 2017-11-28 18:02:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer Knowing the Wolves they will for sure keep an eye on him...but leave it at that

935567150944784385 2017-11-28 17:52:45 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @UnderdogsSports @BreakTheHuddle @SwanInSaintPaul @AverageJer @JustinPinotti Yeah.. I don't really know what to make of that stat.   I just hope NBA2K fucks with his stats and put his D ratings to 0, he gets mad and turns it around.
935566736513994752 2017-11-28 17:51:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball @stsimpson22 @Jsumadchat Don't underestimate the value of being a rebounding monster. But yeah.. i see your point. He has shown some flashes in recent years. I just feel like if the Raptors would have a reliable solution at the 5 they could really be a true contender
935566095959973888 2017-11-28 17:48:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball @spliagotwitt3r @Jsumadchat @stsimpson22 Maker sure has all the tools to be great. Bucks could be a tough team to beat for years to come if they have a bit of luck
935565128325623814 2017-11-28 17:44:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @UnderdogsSports @BreakTheHuddle @SwanInSaintPaul @JustinPinotti @AverageJer That's where Towns has value on D. I really can't see Okafor being equal or better on D and that is saying something...
935564869230825473 2017-11-28 17:43:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball @stsimpson22 @spliagotwitt3r @Jsumadchat True. Poeltl isn't bad by any means. He's a fine player. Just imagine one of the other two on the Raptors though.   But he wasn't a bad pick.
935564499104534528 2017-11-28 17:42:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball @stsimpson22 @Jsumadchat Drummond is way more dominant. He can just bully people. He is just that physically imposing. JV can't and isn't. I don't see the comparison.
935562230686461952 2017-11-28 17:33:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball @stsimpson22 @Jsumadchat @spliagotwitt3r I still don't know what to think of Poeltl at 9. Maker, Sabonis picked right after have potential to be much better bigs.   But admittedly you raise some fair points.
935557923710914561 2017-11-28 17:16:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ontheprowl_MN Wolves twitter = mass chaos.
935556695186640896 2017-11-28 17:11:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DaneMooreNBA Thibs shouldn't have played Belly for that many minutes..smh.
935556236493377537 2017-11-28 17:09:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @UnderdogsSports @BreakTheHuddle @AverageJer @JustinPinotti @SwanInSaintPaul He hit. Dude went down. Hard. Better than Shaq throwing punches at Barkley.
935555755943526400 2017-11-28 17:07:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @UnderdogsSports @SwanInSaintPaul @BreakTheHuddle @AverageJer @JustinPinotti He has some defensive potential. He once defended himself quite effectively from some (boston?) fans.
935554437862608897 2017-11-28 17:02:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TheSteinLine People change their style
935553863414894592 2017-11-28 16:59:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball @stsimpson22 @Jsumadchat Bargnani, Valanciunas, Terrence Ross. Not really home runs.   Or when do you start counting?
935232088650940416 2017-11-27 19:41:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND I see. The frustration.. is yours..  I though you were talking about Towns being frustrated.
935226188544577538 2017-11-27 19:17:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Well.. most of the times, probably. But against the Suns Wolves went a lot to Towns. And it looked like Thibs drew a lot of plays for him. He had like, what? 26 shots?
935224385140592640 2017-11-27 19:10:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Let me add one more: but.
935223946533920769 2017-11-27 19:08:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND But, I think most Towns criticism is over the top. He will be fine.   But the thing that bothers me the most is his body language. And it is getting worse.  But he seems to be at the right spot more often + Whiteside, Howard, Drummond were allways gonna be bad matchups for him
935222942383968257 2017-11-27 19:04:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND But i've got to add. I never could dunk.
935222769977057281 2017-11-27 19:04:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND All fair points. I was allways more pissed after a guy scored on me than when I missed a shot.That's my point. I never see him that mad on D. Mostly disinterested.  Just an observation.
935220547289481217 2017-11-27 18:55:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND You might be right. I think Towns gets into his own head to much. Getting mad at himself at a bad play and then not being ready to make up for it in the next.  Reminds me of a 14 yo kid I coach.   Allways messing up because he's too busy being mad.
935219739265290240 2017-11-27 18:52:16 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Towns agrees.
935218864245362688 2017-11-27 18:48:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TlMBERWOLVES I regressed
935218660502921217 2017-11-27 18:47:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I wish Towns would be just as mad after a missed rotation as he was after his missed dunk ( which was weird. Because he didn't show any happiness after Wigs made the three. And if winning>>>stats then,  well..)
935212097872498688 2017-11-27 18:21:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND He has had a few more games like this.   But agreed. Let's see if he can keep his current play up for this season.
934936979204124673 2017-11-26 00:08:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> No need to make him a starter. Just give him more minutes with the starting unit. Teague more minutes with bench unit/ could give bench little more scoring punch.
934935258755198976 2017-11-26 00:01:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> If Tyus Jones plays like this against better and bigger pg's than Tyler Ulis, while Teague is out. Thibs has got himself something to think about.
934933155190059008 2017-11-26 23:53:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I'm just glad that even when they're not playing at their best yet they are one of the top teams in the west right now.   When the D goes to average. Wolves are  tough team to beat.https://twitter.com/Patrick_Fenelon/status/934930452720291841
934932040084082688 2017-11-26 23:49:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA @SteveDoTweetNow I will never understand the size argument. Tyus isn't that small for a pg
934931278083821568 2017-11-26 23:46:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon Thibs screams a lot, he's ugly, Wolves aren't fun to watch, Rubio's gone, Glen is still old, Towns doesn't play D, Wiggins didn't make all of his 6 threes, Belly is injured, Crawford takes bad shots, we can't enjoy good things after thirteen years of misery.
934930507569291266 2017-11-26 23:42:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @UnderdogsSports Just saying that one good performance against arguably the worst team in the NBA ( missing it's best player) is too small of a sample size to say he deserves to start.
934924838803791874 2017-11-26 23:20:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @UnderdogsSports Maybe we should all calm down. Booker-less Suns..
934924456648232960 2017-11-26 23:18:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @Tyus_Jones_Stan He was great. Loved his game. Not my intention to ruin that for you.
934924050442391552 2017-11-26 23:17:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @Tyus_Jones_Stan I just don't think that Tyus getting 7 steals is an argument for him bringing more effort on D than Teague. Teague gets steals.   Not saying Tyus isn't better on D
934923368557629442 2017-11-26 23:14:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @Tyus_Jones_Stan Top 10 of the NBA. Awesomepic.twitter.com/7CidDM02OJ
934922871687741441 2017-11-26 23:12:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @Tyus_Jones_Stan Teague has been awesome gettings steals this season.
934920692692410368 2017-11-26 23:03:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> There were times they seemed to be having fun. Good to see. Saw Wigs smile, Butler, even Towns.  Good win.https://twitter.com/NBA/status/934919758763438080
934917601016401921 2017-11-26 22:51:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Oh and let's not forget. 4 out of 6 from three point range.
934916952782442496 2017-11-26 22:49:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Wiggins  21      pts 4        assists 5        rebounds  1        steal 1        block +/-     +20  This is the type of game people were hoping for last year. Wigs has improved, a lot.
934852141352710145 2017-11-26 18:31:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon @thunderkat418 My biggest problem with Towns is his body language lately...
934851641232195584 2017-11-26 18:29:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @Michelobius Cousins this year has been a reliability on D when Davis is off the floor. They envisioned having one of them on court all time would cause problems for opposing teams. It has not. Cousins has to be on court with Davis because of his D
934846290692857856 2017-11-26 18:08:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti Yeah. I hope he is the answer to this 'problem'. Really excited about what he might bring
934841354114519042 2017-11-26 17:48:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JoshsPseudonym + you can overcome playing a forward/big not stretching the floor( even though it's harder in today's game). A guard who can't shoot will hurt team badly even when he effects game in other ways. So even when shot stays bad a poor for bigs will not be as bad.
934839328542470144 2017-11-26 17:40:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JoshsPseudonym Looking at the list that seems to be a correct conclusion.
934838499437633536 2017-11-26 17:37:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JoshsPseudonym Not yet...not yet
934838169203245067 2017-11-26 17:36:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JoshsPseudonym Scoring poor on smilodon seems to be a very good indicator of poor shooting at NBA levelpic.twitter.com/DvQiVTY4jp
934834598109949955 2017-11-26 17:21:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JoshsPseudonym Let's tank and draft him
934834206177456129 2017-11-26 17:20:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JoshsPseudonym I see. But a poor in shooting has the biggest chance of turning out ok on NBA level, right?
934833894825881600 2017-11-26 17:19:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JoshsPseudonym I messed up the time line. Thought the elite ones were further down the road.
934833259137196032 2017-11-26 17:16:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer Enough time to learn the lingo. I'm not even gonna try for american football ( not like i watch it though)
934833031239651328 2017-11-26 17:15:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JoshsPseudonym Haven't you said some time ago that when a guy has two or more elite categories in smilodon he's an elite prospect?  But yeah.. he's bad at shooting..
934832304584888321 2017-11-26 17:12:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer Ah. You were talking about penalties... in that case I agree
934831807102636033 2017-11-26 17:10:45 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JoshsPseudonym Duval looking good
934831614466711552 2017-11-26 17:09:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer Not certain the guy taking the free kick scores either. And guy that got tripped could have set a goal scoring opportunity in motion if not tripped.
934830847512936449 2017-11-26 17:06:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> How many times has Thibs yelled this at his players?https://twitter.com/WolfinBrabant/status/934830682509053952

934826833400487936 2017-11-26 16:50:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Seems like a good example of Thibs not getting through to players. Teague should be one of the vets helping his message get through. Apparently Teague is jot helping.https://twitter.com/JaceFrederick/status/934825688602996736

934813256954404864 2017-11-26 15:57:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti I'm convinced he can be just as great as PF as Center. And with current roster construction it might be best to put him at the 4.
934785769788592128 2017-11-26 14:07:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @brittrobson @brandonskye_ Kanter is not exactly a great rim protector

933433208976367616 2017-11-22 20:33:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @tweetdavebenz @JimPeteHoops @rodman99mn I wonder if they can hear what Thibs is saying during the game
933377425148440577 2017-11-22 16:51:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA @Brighan44 @HaugenND I think the Wolves go to the Towns P&R quite a lot in different variations and it's working well.   I do think Thibs could go to a few set plays for Towns in the 4th quarter a bit more, especially when the ball stops moving.
933361226175959041 2017-11-22 15:47:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA @Brighan44 Do you read what he is saying?

933068640747999232 2017-11-21 20:24:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon I'm sorry Nidoking..  :(
933067472697282560 2017-11-21 20:19:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> This might actually be a real game. Come on @Feyenoord_int . Looking good!https://twitter.com/Feyenoord/status/933058814039019520
933062062821003264 2017-11-21 19:58:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I fully expected Towns would be in the MVP discussion this season...at least in some discussion, somewhere between two guys discussing this season's MVP.  He's not. And he's not even close to being MVP level right now. A little disappointing
933057544632889345 2017-11-21 19:40:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon I like it. I missed seeing floaters.. he's compensating for all those floater-less years with Rubio at the helm
933032682455535617 2017-11-21 18:01:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti Spreading the wealth. I think it's a good thing that the touches are evenly spreaded between Wigs/Butler/Towns.  Some plays for Towns late in games especially wouldn't be a bad thing though.
932746495442513920 2017-11-20 23:04:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @sixers @JoelEmbiid @pimpfelix1234 You're so wise. He must have never thought about that. Good thing you are here to give him some free advise.
932738001658155008 2017-11-20 22:30:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I have the feeling people were way more excited about the Love/Pek/Rubio/Adelman Wolves than the Towns/Butler/Wiggins/Thibs Wolves.  Weird.
932737327994232832 2017-11-20 22:28:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer It's allways Jimmy Butler

931956603389136898 2017-11-18 18:45:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Twitter @tweetdavebenz I know there is one. I saw it on How I met your mother

931943103774253056 2017-11-18 17:52:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @sewzinski @Patrick_Fenelon I wish I had something insightful to say as a respond to this. I haven't.
931942365836795911 2017-11-18 17:49:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Why is it that the only two dutch guys who can't speak English ended up coaching in the Premier League?
931941515638788096 2017-11-18 17:45:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @sewzinski @Patrick_Fenelon Ofcourse there is a way to properly regulate it. But that's easy for me to say.Guns have never been as big a part of our culture as it is in yours.  I sincerely hope someday the gun lobby loses it's grip on American politics and guns will not be as easy attainable as they are now

931934634501398529 2017-11-18 17:18:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Gorgui deserves better than having to fight with Portis for a starting gig.https://twitter.com/freetyus/status/931927598514475008

931932561026289664 2017-11-18 17:10:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> But seriously how does something like this happen? 14 year olds have a better technique than him.   At least with Fultz it could be his injury. This is like Noah bad..
931931916365856768 2017-11-18 17:07:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> When I asked a kid I coach to show what a good shooting form is, he said: Just don't do what Lonzo Ball is doing.  He's right.

931893763441557504 2017-11-18 14:36:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AWAWBlog That pass to Taj being an assist is a bit questionable.

931886628016214016 2017-11-18 14:07:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory It worked out quite well

931861377421139970 2017-11-18 12:27:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @tomhaberstroh I'm gonna watch this a 100x
931860434243776514 2017-11-18 12:23:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Rachel__Nichols @TimBontemps @JaimeIbarraJr21 He didn't overlook a talent. He drafted him. He just traded him for a superstar afterwards. That trade is still a robbery
931857442937458688 2017-11-18 12:11:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer He set a lit of great screens against the Spurs.
931855367050493952 2017-11-18 12:03:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Last three games :  Mavericks:   37.2 FG % 21.1 three point % 87 pts.  Spurs: 41.8 FG % 29.2 three point % 86 points.  Jazz: 44 FG % 35 three point % 98 points.  D is improving. Sustainable?
931832191289618432 2017-11-18 10:31:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Nuggets scored 146 points thinking they're the 1983-1984 Nuggets. I think I saw Kiki Vandeweghe on the court.
931829680755396610 2017-11-18 10:21:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Only watched second half but the defense was quite good. Second game in a row keeping opponent below 90.   10 different players with assists + season high made threes.   Good to see.
931662055278632960 2017-11-17 23:15:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Drummond has been good this year and the Pistons are a real surprise. Harris has been awesome but still.... ridiculous.

931568021252071430 2017-11-17 17:01:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So the Ringer is talking about the resurgance of bigs with legit low-post moves. Mentioning Sabonis, Drummond and Porzingis.  No mention of Towns. -_-
931560728976338944 2017-11-17 16:32:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DerekJamesNBA And had one working leg.
931492017791819777 2017-11-17 11:59:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Sekou Smith had him nr 9 as well in the MVP race a while back. Somehow Wiggins is severely overrated or underrated and there is no   inbetween
931292056835600384 2017-11-16 22:45:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> A good way to the end the 100+ scoring streak.   Good to see Wiggins and Butler can have an off night on O and Wolves still win +Towns can have an off night against Pels and Wolves still win.
930971568330690560 2017-11-15 01:31:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Those action pack dudes are seriously annoying.
930968468169658368 2017-11-15 01:19:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So Minnesota nice turns out to be a real thing.   Some kid felt bad he catched a T-shirt just before another kid could catch it.  He wanted to give him his shirt.   Nice.

930555110052245506 2017-11-14 21:56:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @paulmobuckets Should've seen it when you suggested Buffon should be replaced asap.   My bad..
930551673575149570 2017-11-14 21:43:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @paulmobuckets ????wut. That's so far from the truth it's unbelievable.
930545247494471681 2017-11-14 21:17:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Just watched the Jazz game. Wiggins had a great game without scoring much.  Butler quietly played his way to a 21/10/4 statline.   Towns found his shooting touch.   Overall the D was quite good.   4th Q sucked.   Good win.
930194748354318337 2017-11-13 22:04:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TheDoctorCarson Or he is one of the coaches and just joking.

929434281574850561 2017-11-11 19:42:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Kevin Love in you top 5?  ;)
929311211430301701 2017-11-11 11:33:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Rubio is looking terrible lately. Hope he figures things out soon.   Teague has some things to improve on but I can imagine Jazz fans feeling a lot worse about Rubio

929104378241454080 2017-11-10 21:52:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> If the Thunder dig themselves into an even bigger hole it might not be possible to come out of it with a Western Conference this strong.

928688860875325441 2017-11-09 18:20:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AndyGlockner I will, thanks. And you raise some fair points..i'll admit that..it's just the season is young and his recent play shows improvement. So i'm optimistic. Indeed..let's see after 82 games: )
928687417045012480 2017-11-09 18:15:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AndyGlockner I know the numbers but eye test counts for something..and he's looking better
928687290242580480 2017-11-09 18:14:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AndyGlockner It's just weird timing coming with this criticism. He cut down his long 2's, is fighting for rebounds , has been better on D (his numbers sucking is because whole of the team is bad on D riht now) handle improved,making better passes.
928685997038108673 2017-11-09 18:09:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AndyGlockner .536 TS% is not bad for a wing with his usage and ppg. Plus his assist % doesn't account for wiggins passing significantly better this year. Defense is a team game. He makes better decisions, shows a lot more effort and fights for rebounds way more.

928047060334579712 2017-11-07 23:50:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius Don't even mind him not giving more minutes to Belly. Taj has been really good with starting 5
928046881128755201 2017-11-07 23:49:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius Just think it's a good sign we don't talk about him not resting Wigs/Towns enough. I really like his minutes distribution at the moment.
928043795316342784 2017-11-07 23:37:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> SMH Thibs never gives enough minutes to his best players. I thought he learned some things in his year off.https://twitter.com/BrianSampsonNBA/status/927898187817537536
928042813085962241 2017-11-07 23:33:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> If Thibs can coach the Wolves to a 7-3 record using only four words: "Stop being soft! ICE!" I don't need 280 characters to tweet about the Wolves.

926814516784091136 2017-11-04 14:12:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @rickyrubio9 @SHAQ @NBAonTNT @EnragingTweets Was wondering if you were manufacturing internet rage over utter nonsense.. or that you were genuinely enraged by this appropraition
926811686060875776 2017-11-04 14:01:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AATK_DP That is a very nice picture
926811328466915334 2017-11-04 14:00:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @PDWolves @BrianSampsonNBA 6000 comment Rubio discussion incoming..  What have you done?
926811019103567872 2017-11-04 13:59:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @rickyrubio9 @SHAQ @NBAonTNT @EnragingTweets Does his tweet enrage you?
926810529473187840 2017-11-04 13:57:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> It's time for the first blowout win of the season. Pythagoras demands it.
926431194786549760 2017-11-03 12:49:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @steventurous @AverageJer @trwolf93 We had a bit of a upswing in the nineties ( Rik Smits) but it's gone at the moment.. picking up slightly last few years.
926430840539766785 2017-11-03 12:48:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @steventurous @AverageJer And football clubs  earn a lot and are way cheaper. Living in the upside down over here
926430634603630592 2017-11-03 12:47:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @steventurous @AverageJer Weird thing is. Bball is sort of elitist sport over here. Poor kids can't play. High contribution because we have to rent sporting venues...
926429822120873987 2017-11-03 12:44:16 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @steventurous @AverageJer Like you guys have all those bball courts  everywhere (jealous!) It's football here in The Netherlands.It really is a sport of the streets
926428657173848064 2017-11-03 12:39:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @steventurous @AverageJer And one on one is one of the most common forms of football I see. With 2 on 2 and 3 on 3
926428471735345152 2017-11-03 12:38:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @steventurous @AverageJer I work in a somewhat poor neighborhood.There are 15 football courts and 1 basketball court.Street football is only sport they really know
926393289883963395 2017-11-03 10:19:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @Michelobius @nba_poop_hat This is awesome
926368198781493248 2017-11-03 08:39:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @steventurous @AverageJer 1 on 1 is not a problem.with football. A lot of kids play one on one everyday. I think it's the same as with Basketball.
926175750302191616 2017-11-02 19:54:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND You sneakily using Covington as comparioson made me laugh
926172362990645248 2017-11-02 19:41:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon Pop will turn him into Duncan
926172099814789127 2017-11-02 19:40:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti But mostly foul trouble early
926161001711636481 2017-11-02 18:56:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @UnderdogsSports @fortheidiots Not enough bigs already?
926159966028947457 2017-11-02 18:51:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fortheidiots @UnderdogsSports Fair point. He comes for free.. Colangelo fucked up
926152335394508800 2017-11-02 18:21:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fortheidiots @UnderdogsSports Thing is. There are a lot of bigs that can do that for you.
926150691474821120 2017-11-02 18:15:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @UnderdogsSports @fortheidiots I think he can be a good player for sure.
926149054500950017 2017-11-02 18:08:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thunderkat418 @freetyus @SwanInSaintPaul Agreed.
926148990143475712 2017-11-02 18:08:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @UnderdogsSports Still...can't shake the feeling this is just not.his era.
926148553906511872 2017-11-02 18:06:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thunderkat418 @freetyus @SwanInSaintPaul So I doubt he is that much better as he's showing now. Teams know how to deal with him+he's hot and cold...he is just cold right now
926148326063566848 2017-11-02 18:05:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thunderkat418 @freetyus @SwanInSaintPaul I agree about Tyus when talking about O. Bazz is so predictable though  Does same thing over and over. And he will never be good on defense.
926147466621276160 2017-11-02 18:02:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thunderkat418 @freetyus @SwanInSaintPaul Not impressive. Ok. And yes he has been fine on defense. But he probably looks better because Teague hasn't been defending well.
926146670861176832 2017-11-02 17:59:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thunderkat418 @freetyus Tyus has been ok on D especially. Bazz has been terrible agreed. But am confident Dieng improves+ Belly, Crawford , Tyus is half our bench.
926145811339272193 2017-11-02 17:55:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Aftermath8 Popovich is the GOAT
926145654652620800 2017-11-02 17:55:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon Everyone must prepare for a future where lightning strikes are routine.
926144811182297088 2017-11-02 17:51:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @UnderdogsSports He deserves better than rot on the bench for sure.
926143975664373761 2017-11-02 17:48:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @UnderdogsSports Would have been first pick if Flip didn't see Towns work out...
926138398980665346 2017-11-02 17:26:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thunderkat418 Bazz en Dieng were terrible so far. But Dieng holding his own against Demarcus and Davis with Towns a non factor is quite impressive.
926138192314687491 2017-11-02 17:25:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thunderkat418 Tyus has been underwhelming on O..but has filled in for teague competently few times. Belly is awesome and Crawford is doing Crawford stuff
926137177674797059 2017-11-02 17:21:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thunderkat418 I know I am
926137089741262848 2017-11-02 17:21:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thunderkat418 I think people didn't expect much of the bench coming into the season and are pleasantly surprised they have bailed the Wolves out few times
926135929626120192 2017-11-02 17:16:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thunderkat418 Yes. A lot of good bench play was with Davis and/or Boogie on the floor.
926119116653629440 2017-11-02 16:09:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @kylerayner8 @JustinPinotti But you probably switch a lot
926118656219676674 2017-11-02 16:07:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @UnderdogsSports @notsimple__ Would you seriously rather have Okafor than Dieng? Dieng is the better player and it's not even close.
926118223073947648 2017-11-02 16:06:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @UnderdogsSports Yes, probably.But i wouldn't call him a huge add.
926117443298299904 2017-11-02 16:02:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND There is no ball dominant quality wing player like Butler/Wigs on Utah's roster. With Wolves he would probably have totally different nr's.
926116643545206784 2017-11-02 15:59:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Rubio is the second best player of the Jazz and his usage shows it. With Minnesota he would be third/fourth best player+other role.
926104166098984961 2017-11-02 15:10:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti I pretend I teached the kids I coach how to switch
925840292917534722 2017-11-01 21:41:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @freetyus That is one scary lady
925838937540702209 2017-11-01 21:36:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Is this account on a loop?https://twitter.com/hoopshype/status/925837624136286208
925837903233802244 2017-11-01 21:32:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul That is one badly constructed roster. You can have your questions about the Wolves roster..but man... You're 100% right. It's Boogie+Brow
925835686221053952 2017-11-01 21:23:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Towns is gonna have a tough night
925806811118292999 2017-11-01 19:28:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I have the feeling it will be this week.https://twitter.com/brittrobson/status/925777242109677568
925806312121884673 2017-11-01 19:26:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti Under
925805933195907072 2017-11-01 19:25:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Ainge is looking good right now. Trading back for Tatum seems to be the right move ( for now)..
925495723575083010 2017-10-31 22:52:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> If Pop ever decides he wants to rub it in everybody's face that he is the GOAT,waives his whole starting line up and plays bench only=Heathttps://twitter.com/WolfinBrabant/status/925493772590485504
925493772590485504 2017-10-31 22:44:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Spoelstra has taken a page from Pops' playbook. Heat roster is a bunch of misfits but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.Respect
925485953178918912 2017-10-31 22:13:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Could play Bjelica as small ball line up
925485798966857733 2017-10-31 22:13:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Okafor, Dieng, Towns, Patton, Taj line up is fire
925480150308966400 2017-10-31 21:50:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Well with Thibs Wolves track record it is actually quite shocking.https://twitter.com/DWolfsonKSTP/status/925474357081788423
925464053333614592 2017-10-31 20:46:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BreakTheHuddle @JustinPinotti Was he bad on D last night? Did he stood out in that regard? I just watched last part of 4th q and  OT because google spoiled the outcome
925459070420701184 2017-10-31 20:26:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Colangelo fucking up the process.
925439256126001152 2017-10-31 19:08:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fenderbender152 Scary shit.
925438970678448129 2017-10-31 19:06:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fenderbender152 Yeah but somehow they keep turning up on my app.But last nights game was spoiled by a google push message I didn't even know was possible
925406391552167936 2017-10-31 16:57:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So I somehow managed to spoil every game for myself this season...why have league pass if I know the outcome before seeing it anyway.. :(
925105359273984001 2017-10-30 21:01:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @tweetdavebenz Season high
924771840358264832 2017-10-29 22:56:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Looking back losing badly to the Pistons and Pacers might be the best thing that could have happened. Reality check.
924758018557915141 2017-10-29 22:01:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @outsidethenba @FredKatz Everything turned sour for Stedmon Lemon after an altercation with teammate Bobbola Portic.
924744256857702400 2017-10-29 21:06:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @tomhaberstroh I've seen you say that 100x
924703591474126849 2017-10-29 18:24:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf You're as good as your last game. So Towns is pretty pretty good
924702763140943874 2017-10-29 18:21:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory Nope it was a sign my phone doesn't work :(
924702613555335168 2017-10-29 18:20:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory Link doesn't work ...it's a sign that you should stop going at Towns
924701357520629767 2017-10-29 18:15:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Stop going at Townshttps://twitter.com/streethistory/status/924695227583082496
924686701393563648 2017-10-29 17:17:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JCrossover How do you feel about the season thus far?
924682585292394497 2017-10-29 17:01:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball Pistons/pacers games fucked up the net ratings..  i think it's safe to say showings like that will not happen again
924680457035317250 2017-10-29 16:52:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA Yeah people who say Thibs O is only Iso isn't paying attention.
924680223618199552 2017-10-29 16:51:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Reading Canis and realizing that after KG and Kobe now Dirk will play his last season for a lottery team.Glad Duncan had a fitting farewell.
924679374921748480 2017-10-29 16:48:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Feeling good today. My prediction for the week : Wolves 4-0
924677149340160006 2017-10-29 16:39:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I think every shot chart of guys he defends looks exactly the same.   Let's see if he can continue his most recent showing on D.https://twitter.com/streethistory/status/924669870813347842
924593758766878720 2017-10-29 11:08:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Not showing effort against Detroit and Indiana will do that. https://twitter.com/HPbasketball/status/924517154149433345
924337165013803008 2017-10-28 18:08:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BenSchleuss @senorbum @JustinPinotti @thedailywolf @HaugenND @streethistory Hah! Didn't notice this was an answer and part of this conversation... thought it was a stand alone thread. Never mind.
924336935333703680 2017-10-28 18:07:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BenSchleuss @senorbum @JustinPinotti @thedailywolf @HaugenND @streethistory He has a lot of positive high lights too. It was by far his best game on D.
924331605325418496 2017-10-28 17:46:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Towns switched a lot and did that in a good way. He was often in good position and contested a lot of shots of guys who weren't Adamshttps://twitter.com/thedailywolf/status/924330665038041088
924233164305911808 2017-10-28 11:15:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I like this quote.https://twitter.com/thedailywolf/status/924120652583497728
924232736679845888 2017-10-28 11:13:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer Eventually Towns and Wigs will perform when Butler is on the bench. Towns showed tonight he can be a good defensive player.
924232118460403712 2017-10-28 11:11:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> What's happening to Orlando?Vogel can coach.
924231070438100992 2017-10-28 11:07:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> All that effort to take your pants off...for one minute of play.
924230499807219712 2017-10-28 11:04:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Weird timing to be negative about Teague. He had a good game tonighthttps://twitter.com/Jmoeschl7/status/924101941201985536
924229127493779456 2017-10-28 10:59:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Best of all. He showed a lot of effort and in Butlers words: "Toughness"https://twitter.com/WolfinBrabant/status/924228875235790848
924228875235790848 2017-10-28 10:58:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Towns made some nice switches, closed down the baseline few times, contested a lot of shots and was generally in the right position. Nice!
924080456219418624 2017-10-27 01:08:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Towns playing some good D here at the end of the 2nd. Good to see.
924072974768099328 2017-10-27 00:39:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @realchriswebber @swish41 @KGArea21 @kobebryant @timelesssports_ KG 2x
923975939821920257 2017-10-27 18:13:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @reallouispark Plus small sample size..  let's see if he can keep it up.
923975810763063296 2017-10-27 18:12:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @reallouispark True. But two years younger and he was a good young player with potential in Orlando.As bench player behind westbrook hard to get rhytm..
923920098922041346 2017-10-27 14:31:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @reallouispark Oladipo was allways good at driving to the  rim
923919972312735744 2017-10-27 14:31:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @reallouispark After leaving OKC he finally has room to be ball handler/ is Pacers go to guy and has the chance to show his quality.
923890837959991296 2017-10-27 12:35:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> This is weird logichttps://twitter.com/reallouispark/status/923627648764358656
923687802713370630 2017-10-26 23:08:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul @molin1106 @HaugenND Or some Belly with the starters in Taj place. Anyway we indeed need to see more Kat/Belly on the court together
923686682020470786 2017-10-26 23:04:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul @HaugenND @molin1106 In this scenario he has a respiratory illness
923680011936325633 2017-10-26 22:37:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @SwanInSaintPaul Rather have 3 and D wing than Allen..   but yeah he would have solved some problems...
923679427778752514 2017-10-26 22:35:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @jigenkara Do you watch the games?
923679302234853383 2017-10-26 22:34:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @SwanInSaintPaul Then*. Depressing to see D without Jimmy... Wolves never ceise to amaze you
923678968603033600 2017-10-26 22:33:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @SwanInSaintPaul Better yet. Have Jimmy back. Than 2/3 doesn't matter anymore. Still think Wiggs/Butler showed a lot of promise as a good match at the wing
923678539563634688 2017-10-26 22:31:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @SwanInSaintPaul For sure better than Bazz' D. Plus Wiggs at the 2 can create some mismatches.
923677944035315719 2017-10-26 22:29:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul @HaugenND Bazz on the bench. Wiggs at the 2 and Belly at the 3. Improves D plus offense probably will be better..
923677726367731712 2017-10-26 22:28:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @SwanInSaintPaul I miss Pek
923677650866049025 2017-10-26 22:28:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @SwanInSaintPaul Well he used to play well for stretches and then make some headscratching mistakes. Good to see his recent play. Looks like game slowed down
923676666928361472 2017-10-26 22:24:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @SwanInSaintPaul Making smart decision on O as well + doesn't hesitate anymore when shooting three. Looks confident
923676311977168897 2017-10-26 22:22:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul He gives Thibs a lot more line up flexibility ( still not very much).
923674478076481537 2017-10-26 22:15:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Bjelica is one of the few who is actually decent on D this season + Taj showed what his value is on D against Jazz/Thunder https://twitter.com/jigenkara/status/923657597709828096

923669059304116225 2017-10-26 21:53:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I wonder if the Wolves are ever gonna play defense again.https://twitter.com/Tyus_Jones_Stan/status/923668509627908096
923667671220187136 2017-10-26 21:48:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf @JustinPinotti @Michelobius @GameofReindeers You still have to pass Justins comment count.. I heard you're his replacement
923666995043819521 2017-10-26 21:45:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf @JustinPinotti @Michelobius @GameofReindeers probably has a lot of catching up to do
923665534939467776 2017-10-26 21:39:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> One thing I like about Teague this season: Floatersssss.  Other than that..

923663287803314178 2017-10-26 21:31:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf @Michelobius @JustinPinotti Time to get out of retirement
923598173901385728 2017-10-26 17:12:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JaceFrederick Belly is the one and only thing wolves related that puts a smile on my face while that dude can't even smile himself.
923597784204414976 2017-10-26 17:10:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> If this is how the Wolves respond after a blowout loss. Prepare yourself for a season full of blowout losses.
923596507546341381 2017-10-26 17:05:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DerekJamesNBA Would have liked Wiggs at the 2 and Belly at the 3
923594819972354048 2017-10-26 16:58:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> What's the ugliest?
923592928307576833 2017-10-26 16:51:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I'm just gonna pretend Drummond, Aldridge and Adams are actually Olajuwon, Kareem and Wilt.
923592242371186689 2017-10-26 16:48:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> PR department thought it was gonna be an easy year for them.. but nopehttps://twitter.com/Timberwolves/status/923331064659107842
923591541993730049 2017-10-26 16:45:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TheLeeSprouls @marqualler @AverageJer @JustinPinotti Many lives been ruined
923563951258001408 2017-10-26 14:56:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Causes a lot of the problems.
923563889857622016 2017-10-26 14:56:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND True.Focus on D and let the game come to you on O.Don't force things but yes you're right his overhelping at times and being out of position
923562865814048768 2017-10-26 14:52:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND But he gets beat even when he is in the right position. Doesn't have his hands up, jumps around while he should have his feet set
923562484459560961 2017-10-26 14:50:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND I understand that his teamdefense is disastrous, he doesn't help when he should, makes bad decisions etc.Small achievable steps towards goal
923499976105320448 2017-10-26 10:42:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Towns should make shutting down the opposing center his one and only goal for a while.  Keep it simple and just show effort.
923493668396388352 2017-10-26 10:17:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Surehttps://twitter.com/fsnorth/status/923317389105627136
923486709286883328 2017-10-26 09:49:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> A lot of people hopping off the Bandwagon
923480990600912897 2017-10-26 09:26:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So... we are really doing this again, huh?
923267874743111680 2017-10-25 19:19:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So Drummond will dominate tonight? And probably hit all his free throws.
923262839544049664 2017-10-25 18:59:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TravLyleCzech That is what is most frustrating..not his bad D but him not understanding how bad his D is
923194158877200384 2017-10-25 14:26:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Yeah I was really impressed by the effort shown against Indianahttps://twitter.com/Timberwolves/status/922999734838558721
923146690344947713 2017-10-25 11:18:16 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Overreacting is becoming the norm when talking about the Wolveshttps://twitter.com/BrianSampsonNBA/status/923007002128846849
923083791643619328 2017-10-25 07:08:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Embarrassing
922948595489345536 2017-10-24 22:11:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer Long two's. Best shots indeed.
922921613036679168 2017-10-24 20:23:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @highkin @BGoldbergMorse The optics of another redshirt are way better than how they look now
922921298627457025 2017-10-24 20:22:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon They make him look bad plus are risking to worsen the injury. This is terrible.
922905796933029888 2017-10-24 19:21:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I'm expecting a win. A weird feeling.
922903857914613761 2017-10-24 19:13:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon But then... Washington Post might become a smug Ghandi/Jesus hybrid.
922902468731777024 2017-10-24 19:07:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Yeah and Bledsoe was really in a hairsalon where he didn't want to behttps://twitter.com/YourManDevine/status/922901777694867456
922898116411576320 2017-10-24 18:50:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> And every year they're underrated by all.I feel ashamed for thinking they will not make the playoffs this year ( i still sort of think that)https://twitter.com/Tyus_Jones_Stan/status/922651555064635393
922896580088385536 2017-10-24 18:44:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @brittrobson @JonKrawczynski And you're welcome. You and Britt are a big reason following the Wolves wasn't totally depressing during the last few years.
922894722762461184 2017-10-24 18:37:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @brittrobson @JonKrawczynski Thanks for the fast reply!
922892843873722368 2017-10-24 18:29:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> And please care a little about D. Would be awesomehttps://twitter.com/JaceFrederick/status/922859947255369730
922892150752399361 2017-10-24 18:26:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JonKrawczynski @brittrobson First of all..congrats with your new jobs! Second... is it possible to subscribe from overseas?
922871452952653824 2017-10-24 17:04:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I don't like the guy. But Dray is right.https://twitter.com/Sam_Vecenie/status/922709444340961281
922768577039609857 2017-10-24 10:15:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TheHoopCentral @Matt_Mossman He is a superstar
922580506717380608 2017-10-23 21:48:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @canishoopus He called game.
922572858999693313 2017-10-23 21:18:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @talkhoops @Jamestu20 Going to the middle is a smart move. It matters less how hard your release is. It's making a smart decision and executing well. Clutch.
922566239884492800 2017-10-23 20:51:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Love it.https://twitter.com/AbrahamNoyola75/status/922276016017559553
922562979991732224 2017-10-23 20:38:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @talkhoops @Jamestu20 So was Wiggins' buzzer beater.
922553198484836352 2017-10-23 19:59:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @bball_ref 110 ppg is not too shabby actually
922552479446953989 2017-10-23 19:57:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti Hummelbrag. You have a girlfriend.
922551960896770048 2017-10-23 19:55:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti 
922550492550529025 2017-10-23 19:49:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @talkhoops @Jamestu20 And you probably think Carmelo was clutch? So you're basically Skip Bayless

922546942563028992 2017-10-23 19:35:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @bball_ref @IbragimMurtazov Not that I blame Cousins/Davis for Pelicans not winning. Not at all.
922546816322809856 2017-10-23 19:34:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @bball_ref @IbragimMurtazov Jrue ain't that bad..
922541088245731329 2017-10-23 19:11:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 Good idea
922540920016461824 2017-10-23 19:11:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 I hope you're right. I wouldn't mind seeing prime Bledsoe in the playoffs
922540588741873664 2017-10-23 19:09:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 I thought he kind of forced that trade by saying he wanted to be a starter... I could be wrong..
922539509178302464 2017-10-23 19:05:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> The irony.https://twitter.com/nbastats/status/922534634201772032
922538497952702466 2017-10-23 19:01:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 He will be traded now. Doesn't mean he wants to stay in Phoenix.

922536281653108739 2017-10-23 18:52:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JerryZgoda What do you think?
922535965310275586 2017-10-23 18:51:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @kyletheige Phoenix
922535772879753216 2017-10-23 18:50:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ProfCedar A real headscratcher..
922535532974002177 2017-10-23 18:49:45 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JerryZgoda Makes you doubt Thibs ability evaluating players.. i mean come on. Rose has not been a good pg for years now.
922534958765363206 2017-10-23 18:47:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Let's do this. Bledsoe for Irving.https://twitter.com/WolfinBrabant/status/892371035986812929
922534475543842817 2017-10-23 18:45:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JerryZgoda I sincerely hope he has some other reasons as well...
922534300733640709 2017-10-23 18:44:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Tyus_Jones_Stan You do understand with Bledsoe coming here chance increases greatly that Tyus leaves.
922533754853363713 2017-10-23 18:42:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 I don't knowHe wanted to leave a goodClips team because he sees himself as a starter.If you don't wanna sit on bench behind one of best ever
922532478337929218 2017-10-23 18:37:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 Would be an interesting fit. Would fuck up team chemistry though.. (sulking teague on the bench tweeting he doesn't wanna be here)
922530756827799553 2017-10-23 18:30:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @talkhoops @SwanInSaintPaul Those injuries though :(
922529870537773056 2017-10-23 18:27:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @bball_ref Now translate those numbers to winning basketbal. Cousins and Davis putting up monster stats.. but..
922529161574539265 2017-10-23 18:24:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @KarlTowns @thedailywolf Good to see him reflecting on his bad D.
922527877219995649 2017-10-23 18:19:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> What would be the best destination for Bledsoe to end up via trade?
922519219744509952 2017-10-23 17:44:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> If the Suns are mad...they could you know.. try to trade Bledsoe to the Rockets so he can be Chris Paul's back up
922515565717131269 2017-10-23 17:30:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Good decision by Wade.He can remain1st/2nd option and get a lot of touches coming off the benchGood to see he doesn't let his ego get in way
922477872970944514 2017-10-23 15:00:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius I missed the first one. Glad he did it again
922477578614689792 2017-10-23 14:59:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Dave Benz saying 'Player x has matched his season high' multiple times just three games in might just be my new favourite thing
922449080512663552 2017-10-23 13:06:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 But...but..Covington is better at celebrating victories
922381213423239168 2017-10-23 08:36:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I am conditioned to assume any attempted game winner will miss.. i need time to adjust to this new look Wolves. Wiggins!!

922172414674513920 2017-10-22 18:46:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @NekiasNBA He said it himself. He needs touches and has trouble being third/fourth option. On bench he's first option.
922117013505495040 2017-10-22 15:06:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory So ...just like you're doing right now?
922116727793704960 2017-10-22 15:05:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Kerr's reaction to Steph and Durant ejection is a weird one. Being sarcastic and making a joke out of it. Hold your players accountable.
921927590885167104 2017-10-21 02:34:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @nba_poop_hat Curry threw mouthpiece at the ref... not really sure what Durant did. All of warriors were whining to the ref that's for sure...
921927025581019136 2017-10-21 02:31:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Great end of the game. Both Curry and Durant get ejected..while Gasol is sealing the deal. 32 pts/14 rebhttps://twitter.com/WolfinBrabant/status/921924657984524288
921924657984524288 2017-10-21 02:22:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Golden State might just have 1-2 start to the season.Grizzlies ahead by 10 with few minutes to go.Nice surpise should have watched this game
921921648638529538 2017-10-21 02:10:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Rubio is looking good! Hit nice back to back jump shots + a three. Looks confident on offense. Jazz D is all around great.
921921347533639680 2017-10-21 02:09:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Thunder scored only 34 pts in first half.Little movement on offense.A lot of standing around and iso.Anthony post ups worked well.
921916776392294400 2017-10-21 01:51:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Knicks make you look good.Thunder starting five having same problems as Wolves. Looking for their role, adjusting.. seem lost at times
921916299491540992 2017-10-21 01:49:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Thunder are stonecold right now. Can't seem to score. Jazz D is terrific.

921874322398031872 2017-10-21 23:02:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA @TravLyleCzech Collison, Ball, Dennis Smith jr, Ntilikina, Rose/Calderon, Bledsoe (suns suck atm)  all seem to me to be better matchups for Teague

921873235695849473 2017-10-21 22:58:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA @TravLyleCzech Rubio one of easiest match ups? He is way bigger than Teague and good defensively. I'd argue it's one of tougher matchups for Teague
921871167979491329 2017-10-21 22:49:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TravLyleCzech They took Cunningham and Allen from us. This would be the right thing to do
921862893720743936 2017-10-21 22:16:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Translation:The Pelicans decisionmakers suck at making decisions and Davis will eventually be traded to Boston where he wins his first ringhttps://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/921859995729195008

Belly has got me.most excited this first two games. Smart on D, making good decisions on O.. good to see!

Especially late in the game. He was essential to the win
921854244839358466 2017-10-21 21:42:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @NBA @kyletheige For Europeans sake.
921848429394972672 2017-10-21 21:19:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA Or crawford/bazz with second unit
921848225639870464 2017-10-21 21:18:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA Agreed.But Tyus has shown some flashes last year he can shoot.Would provide some much needes spacing and would open things up for Butler/Wig
921823221787299842 2017-10-21 19:39:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA Still think Butler as ball handler with Tyus off ball could work. But Tyus really has to hit shots more consistently for it to work.
921821937709600768 2017-10-21 19:34:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA I thought Tyus has done ok. Better on team defense than Teague so far.Controlled the pace when he was in but has to start hitting some shots
921784269906829312 2017-10-21 17:04:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> On another note. Just saw a part of the Cavs-Bucks game.... man that Cavs D looks improved
921782797118951425 2017-10-21 16:58:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @bball_ref @JCrossover @WolvesRadio Seems low
921781897377828864 2017-10-21 16:55:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer Really looking forward to OKC game. Both teams had roster overhauls...added great talent. Gonna be a good test
921764013012332545 2017-10-21 15:44:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball In pre-season it already looked like they just gave up
921718777947049984 2017-10-21 12:44:16 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Good to see Thibs trying out some line up combinations. Keep in mind pre-season was short. China wasn't good for getting practice minutes in
921717661943451648 2017-10-21 12:39:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> And I can see how Taj on the court with Towns could work on D.Taj was active,chose his spots and interrupted passing lanes.Especially in 4th
921717380979609601 2017-10-21 12:38:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Towns looked somewhat improved on D.Lacks awereness and he needs to put his hands up!! But he was in the right place a little more this game
921715318023770113 2017-10-21 12:30:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Pleased to see Thibs minutes allocation and him trusting the bench.D looked ok I thought. Butler/Taj proved value on D in 4th quarter
921707519810113536 2017-10-21 11:59:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory 19*
921706632626753541 2017-10-21 11:56:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Same goes for the Wolveshttps://twitter.com/sam_amick/status/921590057089167360
921681848530538497 2017-10-21 10:17:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus He already looked in pre-season. Good to see pizza do so well
921533923905167361 2017-10-20 00:29:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Some good ball movement ending with the Wiggins drive. Good to see. Both things we should see a lot more going forward.
921519160928202753 2017-10-20 23:31:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Love taking over.
921500128103497728 2017-10-20 22:15:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA Now i'm intrigued. How would a Love/ Davis frontcourt look..? I think offensively it wouldn't even be a bad fit.
921488546753544192 2017-10-20 21:29:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers Glen Taylor still the owner of the Wolves
921436378159878144 2017-10-20 18:02:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I think the writer of this question to Bill Simmons' mailbag hoped for a different answer.pic.twitter.com/m6msSqc7EP

921414952841371649 2017-10-20 16:36:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 Yeah we do. But Spurs ball movement is elite and I think the game went as expected. Can't expect Wolves win with short Pre-season in China
921414279928180736 2017-10-20 16:34:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA @molin1106 Yeah i can see him make 37%+ , more catch and shoot opportunities will raise his %
921413843980636160 2017-10-20 16:32:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Taking advantage of inexperienced teams. If you miss rotation or help is too late Spurs WILL take advantage.
921413552057044993 2017-10-20 16:31:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Jazz game tonight will be better indicator of how far along Wolves are chemistry wise.Spurs make a living of making teams miss rotations
921412670892527616 2017-10-20 16:27:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA @molin1106 I think Butler/Wigs will be just fine playing together
921412579821539328 2017-10-20 16:27:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA @molin1106 If wiggins plays like last night, catch and shoot, back door cutting, 'a lot of' off ball movement. Sometimes being p&r ball handler
921411416040595457 2017-10-20 16:22:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA @molin1106 Agreed.

Than we have 2 belly's on the team!
921409886273048576 2017-10-20 16:16:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA @molin1106 Butler /Wigs have comparable games which makes role defining probably even more important.
921409790911418370 2017-10-20 16:16:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA @molin1106 Klay has a smaller role than Curry/Durant and he knows it. Let's not forget Green. It works because they have such different roles
921409214244839425 2017-10-20 16:14:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball You mean ESPN?

921408438944649216 2017-10-20 16:11:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I'm just gonna pretend Wolves PR finally added Rubio on Wolves Billboards alongside Wigs/Towns/Lavine like they allways should havehttps://twitter.com/Timberwolves/status/921405918079840256
921400519847022592 2017-10-20 15:39:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Saying Wolves won't make playoffs after a loss to the Spurs is like saying Thunder is a legit threat to GS after a win over the Knicks.
921399843142144000 2017-10-20 15:36:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA I see what you did there.

920644765896626177 2017-10-18 13:36:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @1stTeamNonsense A lot of other years this roster would be projected a lit higher. WC is just ridiculous right now.

920280105649410048 2017-10-17 13:27:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @trwolf93 @AverageJer @thunderkat418 @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @nba_poop_hat Yeah that's possible. And your point of them being bad the whole game is fair. I just hope we we'll finally be good in the clutch this year
920278985245904896 2017-10-17 13:23:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @trwolf93 @AverageJer @thunderkat418 @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @nba_poop_hat I can remember a lot of games where offense stagnated in 4th q under Flip/Smitch. Was Ricky the sole reason: No.. was he part of it:yes
920278770522771457 2017-10-17 13:22:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @trwolf93 @AverageJer @thunderkat418 @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @nba_poop_hat I guess we'll see how the Jazz fare late in games.

920271738667139072 2017-10-17 12:54:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @trwolf93 @AverageJer @thunderkat418 @JustinPinotti Yeah Gobert is no joke and Jazz are deep.

920270326164049921 2017-10-17 12:48:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @trwolf93 @JustinPinotti @AverageJer Too old school. This is probably the one sport most afraid to implement changes.

920269376787550208 2017-10-17 12:44:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @AverageJer @trwolf93 @JustinPinotti And Ricky is arguably top 12
920269207081766912 2017-10-17 12:44:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @AverageJer @trwolf93 @JustinPinotti Jazz had a great QB in Stockton though
920268979171725312 2017-10-17 12:43:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @trwolf93 @AverageJer @thunderkat418 @JustinPinotti With our current roster i see him being more effective than Ricky would be.
920268192504799233 2017-10-17 12:40:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @AverageJer @trwolf93 @JustinPinotti I believe you. I don't know shit about American Football. I can answer your questions about real football though

920267015608250370 2017-10-17 12:35:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @AverageJer @trwolf93 @JustinPinotti I don't watch it because well no one cares about the sport overseas.But aren't the vikes like second in the conference?worth it to root for
920264998378786816 2017-10-17 12:27:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @trwolf93 @AverageJer Yeah nothing wrong with that. Different when someone says he's a wolves fan and is rooting for the opponent. I've seen some on Canis&twitter

920028340047794176 2017-10-16 20:47:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @AverageJer He honoustly seems to be a really good guy
920027877629988864 2017-10-16 20:45:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @AverageJer Around the draft and his first 'pg season' a lot of people hated him
920027606224982017 2017-10-16 20:44:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @AverageJer Is fun but Teague brings you the W (true or not)
920027496149606401 2017-10-16 20:43:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @AverageJer Although in the case of Rubio I prefer Jer's scenario because it makes me feel better about having Teague and i can tell myself Ricky is 1/2
920027072092950529 2017-10-16 20:42:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @AverageJer I loved them too. Still do and will root for them to do well. Do the Bulls and Jazz play the wolves i am rooting for an off day for both
920026620710281217 2017-10-16 20:40:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @AverageJer Fans being more fan of a player. I started being fan of Timberwolves because of KG, but remained Wolves fan and didn't follow him to Boston
920026355584110593 2017-10-16 20:39:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @AverageJer Exactly. That is one thing that appears very different from football in Europe. Love is there for the club, unconditional. With some NBA 1/2

919970589707816962 2017-10-16 16:57:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ProfCedar @JonnyAuping I imagine him never really defending the flag all that well but him taking a lot of flags Rambo style.
919969274923503616 2017-10-16 16:52:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> There was a time Dutch teams actually competed in Euroleague and the Dunking Dutchman hit a game winner in the playoffs.Wish to see it again
919966739269636096 2017-10-16 16:42:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers Good dog. He gets it. But how good of a dog can he be with Bill as his owner.. ? Upbringing matters
919966170148753408 2017-10-16 16:40:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers The front legs have elbows.
919565725160935427 2017-10-15 14:08:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Yeah it's not in theaters anymore..at least not here. Thanks for the tip
919564968080609280 2017-10-15 14:05:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Okay. Thanks, might go see it today
919564499119693824 2017-10-15 14:03:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> The first one sucked. So i can assume this one is far better?
919356490653356032 2017-10-14 00:17:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @Michelobius The basketball takes today are just ridiculous
919343139772686337 2017-10-14 23:24:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Looking forward to Wiggins posterizing Covington,Towns shooting threes over Kanter and Butler stealing the ball from George.
919191338972786690 2017-10-14 13:21:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND Thought exercise : What if Wolves gave max contract to Covington. Would you feel better about it than the Wiggins contract?
918998797182799872 2017-10-13 00:36:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer @Michelobius @IKnowPsych Before Anthony addition I believed they would be great defensively. But i can't see a line up with Russ, Anthony and Patterson be great on D
918996662256889856 2017-10-13 00:27:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer @Michelobius @IKnowPsych I wouldn't be surprised if Taj proves to be more valuable to Wolves than Patterson to Thunder. Doubt he'll stay on court much
918995912919306240 2017-10-13 00:24:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer @Michelobius @IKnowPsych Sure.But they will be at least as bad shooting the 3 as the Wolves.And i think wolves starting five has more quality than Thunder/better fit
918994676706922496 2017-10-13 00:19:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer @Michelobius @IKnowPsych But my bad. You've got a point. Considered him as a 4 which isn't exactly true.
918994262783602688 2017-10-13 00:18:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer @Michelobius @IKnowPsych Yeah.. if they gonna use him as a 3.. which they should. Don't really see him as a wing player though.
918993648557215744 2017-10-13 00:15:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer @Michelobius @IKnowPsych Butler, Wigs, Shabazz, Crawford >PG, Grant, Singler,Roberson
918993038579568640 2017-10-13 00:13:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer @Michelobius @IKnowPsych Their roster is quite thin. Two two for one trades. I think it's close. Think Butler/Wiggins is stronger wing rotation than OKC has.
918992137353662464 2017-10-13 00:09:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer @Michelobius That might be the most important question for the Thunder this season.If they take turns going iso like it was with Durant , this won't work
918991721651990530 2017-10-13 00:07:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer @Michelobius Hope they use him as secondary playmaker next to Russ and Russ will be okay with a little less time with the ball in his hands.
918991544983662592 2017-10-13 00:07:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer @Michelobius I could see it work.. but there are so many ways this could go wrong. I saw PG buried in corner a bit in pre-season. Not best way to use him
918987564958273536 2017-10-13 23:51:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer @Michelobius I'm mostly curious about how they're gonna use PG..he's one of few who can stretch floor, might have to adjust most of Anthony, Russ and him
918963539494297600 2017-10-13 22:15:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TheDailyWolves @BrianSampsonNBA My guess is @DWolfsonKSTP told him this via twitter.
918962857022312448 2017-10-13 22:13:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 @ShootShitBBall Expectations  Milicic and Oden were much much  higher.
918962642030604290 2017-10-13 22:12:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 @ShootShitBBall I'm surprised to see so many votes for Bennett. The Cavs made a weird choice on draft day. It was a reach. They should have traded back/
918957923568582661 2017-10-13 21:53:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer I'd be surprised to see Thunder win 54 games..
918949729974865921 2017-10-13 21:21:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Young Shoarma...  this is bad on so many levelshttps://twitter.com/mattwhitlockPM/status/918634280309411841

918918062769950721 2017-10-13 19:15:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I wonder if China trip/travelling plus tough shedule at beginning of season(Spurs/Utah/Thunder) will add up to a bad start of the season.

918874977373446145 2017-10-13 16:24:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Dudley would bring much needed 3pt shooting, good D especially when it comes to communication, line up flexibility>small ball as stretch 4

918845271626444802 2017-10-13 14:25:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @nba_poop_hat It wouldn't be the first player the wolves add years after Canis wanted said player
918844939643039744 2017-10-13 14:24:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers I've heard it can be quite cold in Minneapolis. But man...the Lakers can't do this.. it's just wrong
918824947203674112 2017-10-13 13:05:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer I'm planning to come over when they make the playoffs so i will find out soon enough
918824724238651393 2017-10-13 13:04:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer The way people use the phrase minnesota nice i mean ofcourse..
918824414606655488 2017-10-13 13:03:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer I sort of interpreted it as if people from Minnesota prefer being passive agressive over being agressive + being super nice ofcourse!
918816740926283776 2017-10-13 12:32:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DaneMooreNBA Great start Dane! Awesome to have Andrew as your first guest
918577460874268672 2017-10-12 20:41:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers Good question. I haven't spotted him yet
918575650386169858 2017-10-12 20:34:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers Fair point
918575350598324225 2017-10-12 20:33:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers Yeah.. i don't even disagree.. i just think he has some bb iq..   he's certainly not the smartest...but he shows flashes of getting it
918574985735737344 2017-10-12 20:31:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers Haha.. i need to vent this on Canis.Feels bad to do it here,as soon as season begins i'm gonna engage in frustrating disuccions again
918574542834069505 2017-10-12 20:30:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers Which leads to.him making mistakes
918574495941656576 2017-10-12 20:30:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers If he was on Spurs he would be awesome..   Nah i think he legit is a smart player.. he just drives too much and lost confidence in 3pt shot
918574183227035653 2017-10-12 20:28:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @GameofReindeers @JustinPinotti He hs to have confidence in his shot... he can shoot it ( man...allmosy make it sound like ricky debate)
918573749565345793 2017-10-12 20:27:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @GameofReindeers @JustinPinotti I have some hope he will be a good rotation level player this season
918572783789117440 2017-10-12 20:23:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers But a lot of good ball movement from.bench against GS had to do with Bjelica sharing the ball..some nice hot potatoe passes
918572502829461504 2017-10-12 20:22:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers I agree. Last season he just made a lot of head scratching moves...but sometimes it looks like the game slows down for him..
918572225393020928 2017-10-12 20:20:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @Michelobius @GameofReindeers Thibs, Butler and other have mentioned Wiggins as a hard working guy. I wouldn't know why would make stuff like that up
918572041221140491 2017-10-12 20:20:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @Michelobius @GameofReindeers Saying he is not freakishly athletic because he doesn't do 'off ball stuff' enough and doesn't dunk that often...takes the cake though
918571785288867840 2017-10-12 20:19:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers He seriously made smart plays this pre-season. Followed by two dumb fouls though. But still i think he gets the game..
918571401027706882 2017-10-12 20:17:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @Michelobius @GameofReindeers Nah i don't think so... never made that connection. Could be me though..
918571081337798656 2017-10-12 20:16:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @Michelobius @JustinPinotti Yeah i get having some doubts about the contract but ... this was too.much
918570874156081153 2017-10-12 20:15:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @JustinPinotti @Michelobius I decided that was enough for today... i changed my mind about returning to off season Canis
918570754911981568 2017-10-12 20:15:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @JustinPinotti @Michelobius When Wiggins criticism turned to takes as : He's not freakishly athletic and has no work ethic.. and i actually took the time to respond/
918567100901478401 2017-10-12 20:00:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> He might stay, he might leave. Sometimes NBA reporting is just...https://twitter.com/The94FeetReport/status/918469536227233793
918566024525512704 2017-10-12 19:56:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @SwanInSaintPaul Warning,Juicy, Suicidal thoughts is some great story telling.Machine gun funk is one hell of a track. The what is a classic.All around great
918565598669492225 2017-10-12 19:54:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @SwanInSaintPaul He's not the GOAT. I'm not saying that. I sincerely see Ready to Die as top 10 hiphop.album though. That makes you one of greats imo/
918564978000584704 2017-10-12 19:52:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul @streethistory Catalogue counts but quality over quantity. Illmatic is what puts Nas in upper echelon of mc's not his countless other albums
918564470443692034 2017-10-12 19:50:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul @streethistory Music mostly is a preference thing.I see what you're saying.Saying he's seen as one of greats because he didn't flame out, not enough credit
918545179405152257 2017-10-12 18:33:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @SwanInSaintPaul I like some rappers way more than Big , musically but I can't deny BIG is a better rapper than most of them
918544510984118274 2017-10-12 18:30:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @SwanInSaintPaul Technically they aren't even in same ball park. Love Ice Cube though and love his delivery. Biggie is the more gifted rapper imo
918544094464487424 2017-10-12 18:29:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory There are more rappers who could rap like Cube..try and emulate BIG , you fail.
918543938235043840 2017-10-12 18:28:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory He was anointed because of his amazing delivery, his ability to flow behind the beat. His technique is undervalued. He was amazing.
918540726971052037 2017-10-12 18:15:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory Cube made his biggest impact with NWA.. Big has big impact on game not only because of his dead.. he was the face of East coast rap
918539830136631296 2017-10-12 18:12:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory I would place Rakim's Paid in Full and don't Sweat the technique above Cube. And i see Ready to Die as better than both
918539212630167558 2017-10-12 18:09:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul @streethistory They are all fantastic in their own right and made some great albums. Big was so good though...unmatched delivery and timeless albums.
918538996585771008 2017-10-12 18:08:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @SwanInSaintPaul Name a Redman,Rakim  Ice Cube , LL alvum better than Ready to die. Rakim has the best case
918538339933966337 2017-10-12 18:06:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @SwanInSaintPaul Plus the two albums he made are better than what any of the rappers mentioned managed to produce.
918537728752541696 2017-10-12 18:03:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @33push Could be an awesome team. I think adjustment for George will be toughest. He's one of few who can stretch floor for Thunder..
918537448241684480 2017-10-12 18:02:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @33push I can see your point. Russ and Harden indeed aren't the most coachable players. It could go several ways with Thunder this year..
918501604055306243 2017-10-12 15:40:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @33push You can say a lot about the Thunder. But them not drafting well..is not one of them

917121868104196098 2017-10-08 20:17:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 @UnderdogsSports @HaugenND @SwanInSaintPaul @thunderkat418 @1GoingToTown I think he showed improved effort on D in pre-season. With Taj and Butler showing the way team defense will probably improve to. Improving/
917121117512445953 2017-10-08 20:14:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 @UnderdogsSports @HaugenND @SwanInSaintPaul @thunderkat418 @1GoingToTown Wiggins is tailor made for the playoffs. I'm not that afraid of giving him max. Worse case scenario he is a high volume scoring third option
917120715236749312 2017-10-08 20:13:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 @UnderdogsSports @HaugenND @SwanInSaintPaul @thunderkat418 @1GoingToTown I think Towns will be. And i'm confident Wiggins will be good enough to be awesome third option. I think he already is a good third option
917119428730478592 2017-10-08 20:08:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 @UnderdogsSports @HaugenND @SwanInSaintPaul @thunderkat418 @1GoingToTown Gotta give max to keep him. I rather have Wigs on team because his potential to be star. Doubt Harris has real star potential.
917119257359650816 2017-10-08 20:07:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 @UnderdogsSports @HaugenND @SwanInSaintPaul @thunderkat418 @1GoingToTown I think Harris contract isnfair value. Wiggins ha snot yet proven he deserves the max. But in current market he will get max everywhere/
917118037408534529 2017-10-08 20:02:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 @UnderdogsSports @HaugenND @SwanInSaintPaul @1GoingToTown @thunderkat418 Which he hasn't. Give Wigs a smaller role and he will have different numbers as well. This year he needs to find his role. Will be exciting
917117751197650946 2017-10-08 20:01:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 @UnderdogsSports @HaugenND @SwanInSaintPaul @1GoingToTown @thunderkat418 Exactly. I'm making an argument here that he probably wouldn't do as well as Wiggins if he had that much responsibility/
917117400390230018 2017-10-08 20:00:02 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 @UnderdogsSports @HaugenND @SwanInSaintPaul @thunderkat418 @1GoingToTown Wiggins has ability to take over games with his ability to create scoring opportunities for himself
917117270945665035 2017-10-08 19:59:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 @UnderdogsSports @HaugenND @SwanInSaintPaul @thunderkat418 @1GoingToTown Gary Harris probably has performed better last year. Defensively for sure. Make Harris 1st or 2nd option though...and see how well he does
917105926900998144 2017-10-08 19:14:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 @UnderdogsSports @GameofReindeers @SwanInSaintPaul @HaugenND There's enough there to believe he will be a much improved player coming season.
917105793408950272 2017-10-08 19:13:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 @UnderdogsSports @GameofReindeers @SwanInSaintPaul @HaugenND Of more effort on D, making good switches. He was allready ok on contested rebounds..with better positioning his rebounding % will go up
917105479658205185 2017-10-08 19:12:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 @UnderdogsSports @GameofReindeers @SwanInSaintPaul @HaugenND Wiggins handle is much improved/his passing..expect his assist % to go up/his 3pt shooting improved. He showed sings this pre-season/
917095089226289152 2017-10-08 18:31:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer Exactly. Thibs' got a lot of line up possibilities with this group. Looking forward to see how it will look in regular season.
917092199413813249 2017-10-08 18:19:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer @BrianSampsonNBA *then.  And on top of that they hit some impossible shots today.
917091851441786880 2017-10-08 18:18:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer @BrianSampsonNBA Yeah at first i was really impressed with Teague controlling the pace/O in 1st Q. Than W's turned it up and just pulled away. Unbelievable
917090680207478784 2017-10-08 18:13:51 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer I really liked it when Butler was in woth second unit and Butler was ball handler with Tyus off ball. Think that has some real potential
917089872942428160 2017-10-08 18:10:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer @BrianSampsonNBA Agreed. Wolves were really pushing the pace first half. Really played into W's hands. Gotta admit though..they had some succes early on
917089187903533057 2017-10-08 18:07:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer In 2nd half. With more energy/commitment they could have prevented a lot more threes/cuts from GS
917089049252425729 2017-10-08 18:07:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer Second half D was just bad.1st half was quite ok.It was good to see switching go better, communication was there.But effort level was low/
917086693550907392 2017-10-08 17:58:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer Gotta commit closing out. Perimeter D/transition D could have been a lot better. They chose the right spots mostly. But gotta commit.
917086044721483776 2017-10-08 17:55:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory So we agree about everything. Explain to me then...what's wrong about Thibs quote? Towns is 3rd year, Wigs 4th year. Time to perform
917085760226029569 2017-10-08 17:54:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball Too bad for them all of North West has improved significantly.
917084095225659392 2017-10-08 17:47:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory True. So Thibs is right. No time to wait on potential. Gotta be better defensively THIS season.
917080850986086400 2017-10-08 17:34:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory Like Taj and Butler?
917080531875123202 2017-10-08 17:33:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory He's right though. Gotta win this season. Don't see anything wrong with this quote
917074131140710403 2017-10-08 17:08:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 @UnderdogsSports He was mostly invisible this game. Obviously looking for his role on this team. Showed some effort though
917064426318114816 2017-10-08 16:29:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Wolves looked impressive doing so though in first half.https://twitter.com/WolfinBrabant/status/917064229676552192
917064229676552192 2017-10-08 16:28:45 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Wolves were really pushing the pace this game. Played right into Dubs hands. Gotta slow the game down when playing the Warriors.

917042198771888128 2017-10-08 15:01:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Game Thread. 1st half.https://twitter.com/WolfinBrabant/status/916988076446142464
917020854948687872 2017-10-08 13:36:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> (Missed start of 1q and 3q though. So might missed some Wigs plays). In short: Not a lot of new things to learn from this game.
917020430258581505 2017-10-08 13:34:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Could create some mismatches for GS. Didn't see a lot from Wiggins. Still needs to find his role on this team. /
917020050615427073 2017-10-08 13:33:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> One of Wigs/Butler/Towns on court with bench a lot.Butler as ball handler with Tyus off ball looked interesting.Towns can dominate whenever/
917019747170045953 2017-10-08 13:31:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Played well on O, some good play with Dieng. Looks promising. Good ball movement from bench. D is worrisome though. Expect to see../
917019423357186049 2017-10-08 13:30:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Final take aways: D looked atrocious in second half. Especially transition D /Perimeter D looks BAD. Belly looks healthy and confident../
917019123674177538 2017-10-08 13:29:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Melo Trimble with a nice finish in traffic. Fighting for a roster spot. UGLY game right now.   Aldrich still can't finish a bunny.
917018156413177857 2017-10-08 13:25:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Bell is balling. Some awesome moves. Rebound /dunk,  steal to transition dunk.. makes the most of the little time he has on the court
917017684486885377 2017-10-08 13:23:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Jordan Bell looking exciting in garbage time. Possibly good pick up from W's. Wolves getting outplayed in garbage time as well. Game is dead
917014771135844357 2017-10-08 13:12:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Thibs is gonna shout a bunch in dressing room after game.  Effort on D is non existent. O very sloppy in second half on top of that.
917013431076687872 2017-10-08 13:06:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Belly with a nice drive and a little floater. Nice feed from Tyus to Dieng after that. Bench O really looks promising in pre-season.
917012979593465861 2017-10-08 13:05:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Muhammad woth a good feed. Dieng can't finish. Dubs with another easy three: Thompson. Transition D is a problem. Sloppy start of 4th
917011871835795457 2017-10-08 13:00:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Belly with the steal! End of quarter. Warriors control the game. I just looks so easy for them
917011480876371969 2017-10-08 12:59:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Belly with the no look assist to Tyus. Drives and kicks. Good game for Bjelica. Two unnecessary fouls in short time span though
917010857044905985 2017-10-08 12:56:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I found it. Dubs with some good D right now. Wolves can't get through.Belly/Dieng playing off of eachother this game.Bodes well for 2nd unit
917009153578733569 2017-10-08 12:49:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Missed first half of third q. Let's see how it's going. Curry still on fire. Where is the D?
917000833543430144 2017-10-08 12:16:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Towns was impressive in first Q, Belly looked good, Teague is better on D than I expected (even though Curry lit him up) Dubs are GOOD
917000431137705984 2017-10-08 12:15:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Like he played with bench, with Tyus off ball. All in all O looked good: bench and starting 5. A lot of work to do on D.
917000186672635904 2017-10-08 12:14:16 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Teague is primary ball handler as expected but would expect to see Butler a little more as the ball handler with Teague off ball.
916999948113203200 2017-10-08 12:13:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Taj misses the corner three. I assumed it was going in. First half closes out. Warriors dominated second quarter.
916999036179304448 2017-10-08 12:09:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Butler with the in game push ups after allmost stealing ball from Curry. He is such a character. Love it.
916997249984581632 2017-10-08 12:02:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Perimeter defense is looking atrocious. Dubs shooting threes at will. Tie the game with transition Curry three in Wiggins face.
916996455340101632 2017-10-08 11:59:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Crawford making up for it with beatiful drive to basket. On court with starting 5.
916994957193433090 2017-10-08 11:53:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Sloppy play by Crawford in P&R causes my feed to quit. Wolves O looked impressive. Pushing the pace, a lot of movement/cutting
916993781186093056 2017-10-08 11:48:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Belly looking good out there. Making some smart plays right now. Bench D not looking good right now. It helps warriors are VERY sloppy
916992383266500610 2017-10-08 11:43:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> In typical bazz fashion.  I hope he will changes it up a bit. It's predictable
916992218715574272 2017-10-08 11:42:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Shabazz assist to Tyus. Allways special. Bazz playing a little sloppy though.Going to basket from left side few times already
916991387236798466 2017-10-08 11:39:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Bjelica looking confident shooting the three. Seemed to be the problem for Bjelica shooting threes last two seasons. Hope it sticks
916990855919095808 2017-10-08 11:37:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Butler playing as ball handler  with the bench. Seeing Tyus off ball some. Is this something we will see more often in regular season?
916990326132412416 2017-10-08 11:35:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Butler feed to Belly is beautiful. Followed by nice Tyus handoff to Butler. Getting to the line after typical Butler drive.
916989651319246849 2017-10-08 11:32:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Wolves moving the ball well at the end of the 1st. It is the bench that just entered the game, fitting. Moved the ball well last game too
916989095624302593 2017-10-08 11:30:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> A lot of oooo's and aaaaa's from chinese crowd.  Seem to love the game.
916988895186874368 2017-10-08 11:29:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Teague holding it's own against Curry. Controls the pace of the game.
916988076446142464 2017-10-08 11:26:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Towns looking impressive. Getting the shots he wants. Javale not capable of guarding him.
916982228936216577 2017-10-08 11:02:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Trump supporter logic: Seeing Dutch-Moroccans as your fellow countrymen as a Dutchman makes you automatically muslim.https://twitter.com/bankre/status/916977534994182144
916980803929870337 2017-10-08 10:57:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @molin1106 Yeah..i'm beginning to worry a little bit. Not a good look for Wiggins.
916979958987345920 2017-10-08 10:53:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BreakTheHuddle @yashalevine @VerucaS83487520 @bankre I never even talked about religion. You guys made it about that with your weak arguments.

916978281618034688 2017-10-08 10:47:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BreakTheHuddle @yashalevine @VerucaS83487520 @bankre Nope. I'm not. Enough said.
916818915250130944 2017-10-07 00:13:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer @HaugenND You can critisize Wiggins for a lot. His rebounding %, lack of assists. But not for being inefficient.He's quite efficient for volume scorer
916810717545881605 2017-10-07 23:41:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer @HaugenND Wiggins is a totally different player than Lavine
916413035283124224 2017-10-06 21:21:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Besides the Taj corner three/ one thing from  pre-season I would love to see in regular season is Thibs' minutes distribution.
916410736129331201 2017-10-06 21:12:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @CromsCorner @Aftermath8 I mean pre-season. He's not using the entire roster. And for good reason. New players need to gel , especially starting five
916408784972668928 2017-10-06 21:04:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Lonzo is gonna avoid Fox his whole NBA career , isn't he?https://twitter.com/Mike_Bresnahan/status/916397536952254469
916348360621256704 2017-10-06 17:04:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @CromsCorner Not the Wolves. Ten men deep

916283040254582784 2017-10-06 12:44:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @BrianSampsonNBA Who's 1,2,3 option on offfense/understanding Thibs defensive shemes and executing them I hope will take a little less time.Exciting for sure
916282759018090496 2017-10-06 12:43:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @BrianSampsonNBA Yeah probably.For sure to be a well oiled machine.Finding out the best way how to play together and where everyone likes the ball 1/2
916281083502780416 2017-10-06 12:36:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TravLyleCzech Yeah. Too bad he entered the fray last year when both he and the wolves sucked
916273541687005184 2017-10-06 12:06:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @streethistory @BrianSampsonNBA And that will be enough to stay in playoff race early in the season. If they click after like 25-30 games. I think Wolves will be fine.
916270504100745220 2017-10-06 11:54:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Sunnyfleur_ I just made some.

916265754680549377 2017-10-06 11:35:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> The most annoying tweets: " How can people be upset about A when B is happening in the world."
916229304744325120 2017-10-06 09:11:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA @streethistory I think the starting five is learning how to play together naturally. There were some sequences that really looked good. They need some time
916046767896039427 2017-10-05 21:05:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JerryZgoda I thought twitter was nonsense. But as a serious answer to your original question.A perennial MVP candidate. Hopefully with much improved D.

916023426707533824 2017-10-05 19:32:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @loseehafer He had a nice drive and kick last game.Not rushed but calmly placed it where it should be. I like it.

916020486831734784 2017-10-05 19:21:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers Yeah he made some nice cuts. With his increasing effort on D i think Wigs will be fine
916020310893309952 2017-10-05 19:20:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @JustinPinotti Some nice interchanges between butler and wigs. I could see it really work
916019764253937669 2017-10-05 19:18:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @JustinPinotti I hope Wigs usage will be like it is now. Doubt it will be
916019649724248064 2017-10-05 19:17:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @JustinPinotti @IKnowPsych You deserve all them recs joel
916019190137606144 2017-10-05 19:16:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers The offense went through him too much though this pre season. A few less touches would be good
916018967029968896 2017-10-05 19:15:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @JustinPinotti The young guys just didn't do whay they were told to last year beside a ten game stretch mid season. That's value not visible in contracts
916018542381797376 2017-10-05 19:13:33 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @JustinPinotti Thibs just really really needed a voice on the court. The edginess of Dieng last game...might be an example how culture is changing
916018189678419968 2017-10-05 19:12:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @JustinPinotti Agreed. If Taj legit adds the corner three though i think few people mind 14m a year. Would be a fun surprise
916017495638552576 2017-10-05 19:09:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @JustinPinotti It could happen. And then RG will let us have it.
916016801896714242 2017-10-05 19:06:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers Fair point.
916016572191227904 2017-10-05 19:05:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers Still good value contract patpat. Wouldn't have minded us signing him
916016401047068672 2017-10-05 19:05:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers He was ripped apart by raps fans last year
916016295119859712 2017-10-05 19:04:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @JustinPinotti So..notcommenting anymore. But lurking and analysing the comments? Much less time consuming.
916016073274773506 2017-10-05 19:03:45 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers They count double when Taj takes them
916015978680655874 2017-10-05 19:03:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @JustinPinotti Don't tell anyone though. Let RG be the villian
916015796861665280 2017-10-05 19:02:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @JustinPinotti I sort of allways liked that signing. 14 million or not. But yeah...shit will hit the fan
916015212750352385 2017-10-05 19:00:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers That is a bond that can never be broken
916014568593346560 2017-10-05 18:57:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers Okay. You could see it that way too

910255055311339521 2017-09-19 21:31:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @GameofReindeers I think after being on Canis for this long you will understand that everyone with Rubio in their name will get benefit of the doubt
910254150457446401 2017-09-19 21:27:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @GameofReindeers And I do see your point.

910252458366160901 2017-09-19 21:21:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @GameofReindeers I see your point. Him having defended bellsprout. He is way more nuanced in his takes than the other ghost though. I'm 100% sure /1
910251839454662657 2017-09-19 21:18:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @GameofReindeers Well.. i can say this. The thread you linked was one hell of an interesting thread to read at the time.

910131974374875137 2017-09-19 13:22:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @mackanic32 @JustinPinotti So are you seriously saying it would be a good signing?
910128249543458817 2017-09-19 13:07:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @mackanic32 @JustinPinotti I'm not disagreeing there. But i rather have an extra anthony brown kind of guy than Bogut. Old, vet, reached ceiling, fills no need.
910127711837986816 2017-09-19 13:05:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti Fair point.But going with your point here i'd rather have a young guy to develop than a guy who barely can stay on the court.No extra vet.
910126689891635200 2017-09-19 13:01:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @mackanic32 @JustinPinotti I'd rather have Thibs giving Patton 5 min a game than Bogut.
910125919855095808 2017-09-19 12:58:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti None. So don't give it to a big but an extra wing we actually need.
910125515918467072 2017-09-19 12:56:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @mackanic32 Isn't that why he gave Taj 14 mil a year
910125397311967232 2017-09-19 12:56:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti Giving another roster spot to a big who can't stretch floor isn't a good use of roster spots even on vet min.

910019665019179009 2017-09-18 05:56:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Stories like this make me doubt Thibs/Laydens plan or that they even have one.But if Dante signs here i like the Wolves offseason as a wholehttps://twitter.com/daldridgetnt/status/909979492696895488

908388691038568448 2017-09-14 17:55:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TlMBERWOLVES @JimmynKAT He is a steal on the vet min. There are a lot of overpaid NBA players to be found..Shabazz ain't one of them.
908387709940576256 2017-09-14 17:51:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> One of the best passing bigs of last decade imho. High Basketball IQ..he just understands the game of basketball. Gonna miss see him playhttps://twitter.com/molin1106/status/908383999671795714
908386723834589185 2017-09-14 17:47:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Do you think Lebron is too reliant on his athleticism?I can see him focus more on defense+ playmaking.Could age really well. Shooting though

908362974263435264 2017-09-14 16:13:04 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I think he can. He probably knows it can help his legacy getting an extra title with being second fiddle over being first option+not winning
908362665298407424 2017-09-14 16:11:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Agreed. I hope Klove is a great Robin to Lebrons Batman this year.
908361719055077376 2017-09-14 16:08:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Nothing against the Admiral. He was a beast..
908355438701412353 2017-09-14 15:43:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> He is still to dominant to take on a secondary role. Not even close to taking kobe road yet..

907732895527251969 2017-09-12 22:29:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Let's sign Stephon Marbury on vet min. Wolves need third point guard.

907714034983632901 2017-09-12 21:14:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DunkingWolvesFS Good to see David Lee being excited about the Wolves.
907710844250808322 2017-09-12 21:01:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Shabazz is one of the most likeable and hard working players on the roster. Even though he's one dimensional I allways liked seeing him play

907683007678615554 2017-09-12 19:11:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf Great value. Probably best player available. Seems like best move for Shabazz too. Now let's get Dante!
907681526095151105 2017-09-12 19:05:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ProfCedar With Butler, Wiggins and Jamal as our wing rotation he will probably get plenty of minutes. Chance to play himself to a bigger contract.

907359528290840576 2017-09-11 21:45:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TravLyleCzech Hope Cunninghams 3pt shooting of last season is real.. Had a sweet mid range jumper .. would be great if he can stretch floor a bit.
907358724070801409 2017-09-11 21:42:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TravLyleCzech Would've made bench defense a lot better.Spacing would be bad though, but love Allen. Allways liked Cunningham, good signing on vet min.
907355463104253952 2017-09-11 21:29:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TravLyleCzech But it's bad news for the wolves potential to sign Allen.. :( Man i had some irrational hope we could have actually signed him

902871504907640832 2017-08-30 12:31:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon Middle weight division becoming a farce and losing McGregor...  would be hard to overcome bu the UFC
902871376197025792 2017-08-30 12:31:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon Would be good for MMA if he stayed.. Jones f-ing up for the 100th time, Rouseys legend being  lost after gettig beaten up the last two times

902303936895475712 2017-08-28 22:56:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @CavsSportsTalk @Bigmacvilla @Sports4TheSoul That's true. Smart is above Rose's level.
901784997320941572 2017-08-27 12:34:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TravLyleCzech Honoustly think Nick would have been a good match up. Better boxer than Nate.. even more unorthodox in his style of fighting.
901730905538125825 2017-08-27 08:59:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Seems to be pretty hard for most combat sports fans to just say good fight.McG did better than expected and MWdid what he was supposed to do

901587498178052096 2017-08-26 23:29:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @highkin Well..  it turned out everyone can.
901583643822481408 2017-08-26 23:14:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Now his injury is being used by Cleveland to get another asset in deal. Thomas is a great player, allways gives 100%. He deserves better
901583117621874688 2017-08-26 23:12:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Last pick in the draft, bad situation in Sactown, part of three pg rotation in Phoenix, on the trade block after leading Boston to ECF. 1/2

901521115213946880 2017-08-26 19:05:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @dbrauer There are some fair criticisms, yes. But he exaggerates to make his points.. and that doesn't make his arguments stronger/it fun to read
901519651863240705 2017-08-26 19:00:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @dbrauer Criticizing contract is fair. But Dieng is not an underwhelming role player. Not even close.
901519349755858944 2017-08-26 18:58:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @dbrauer Saying the Butler trade is anything but impressive is ridiculous and attributing Noah and Dengs performance last few seasons to Thibs unfair
901519045178077186 2017-08-26 18:57:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @dbrauer Terribly written article. Describing everything in a way it fits his narrative. Saying Dieng is an underwhelming role player is not true.1/
901509171073437697 2017-08-26 18:18:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Betting on himself with one year contract.
901508117464305667 2017-08-26 18:14:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> With how FA went this season...i wouldn't be surprised if he get's a minimum contract next season. Same advisors and agent as Rose?https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/901502840040034305
901232754649681921 2017-08-25 00:00:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @KarlTowns @JustinPinotti When he misses a layup...
901141255920418818 2017-08-25 17:56:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I just became an even bigger fan of @KarlTowns. Well said big man
900812420612055043 2017-08-24 20:09:52 UTC <WolfinBrabant> City, Shaktar and Napoli. We might have a chance here..
900718178845765634 2017-08-24 13:55:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @MWhittington13 @Ben_Larivee Cleveland came out of this trade probably better then they were..so  i don't see how GS is the winner here.
900666474813149184 2017-08-24 10:29:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon @tim_altig Pek was so strong he could make the world flat by himself.
900658769461489664 2017-08-24 09:59:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Would be so wolvesy if they somehow manage to not get a max deal done after a rookie deal.
900480884335357953 2017-08-23 22:12:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @theScoreNBA I think this 'fan' dropped his tiki- torch.
900446746823856128 2017-08-23 19:56:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius Not that hot of a take imo. I really think Cleveland is a better team after this trade. Altman knows how to start a career.
900441758873640960 2017-08-23 19:36:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Kings, Suns, Celtics. Thomas never got the appreciation he deserves. I hope he will reach the finals by beating the Celtics in the ECF.

900384592733011968 2017-08-23 15:49:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Great start for Altman as GM of the Cavaliers.Coming out of Irving soap possibly a better team as before was not something to be expected
900382156643606530 2017-08-23 15:40:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf Cleveland might come out of this ordeal a better team than they were.
899754992684421121 2017-08-21 22:08:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ontheprowl_MN That time when he didn't hurt another player

899736479152439301 2017-08-21 20:54:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti The difference in storytelling conincides with passing the books...  so it's easy to criticize
899734252346068992 2017-08-21 20:45:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti Sort of like their teleport ability this season.With winter finally here,just have to accept that there is less room for personal drama

898686139040759813 2017-08-18 23:20:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I imagine Thibodeau watching GOT , yelling ICE! at the Knights Watch when they will defend the wall from the White Walkers upcoming season
898675551891857408 2017-08-18 22:38:42 UTC <WolfinBrabant> It's a slippery slope to be offended by a joke when the topic affects you personally and to laugh about a joke when it doesn't
898674100545110016 2017-08-18 22:32:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Just because you took what i said seriously doesn't mean i meant it -Bill Burr- Good thing to keep in mind about comedy and satire.

898663837737648128 2017-08-18 21:52:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @NateDuncanNBA Makes me think...  maybe Glen Taylor thinks he's offering the max to Towns instead of Wiggins..

898630516148064259 2017-08-18 19:39:45 UTC <WolfinBrabant> There was no violence so no statements about 'many sides', no discussions about statues because there were none. It is the same hate
898629120757825536 2017-08-18 19:34:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> A month before Charlottesville 6000 Neo-Nazi's gathered in a small town in Germany. Anti-semitism, racism and hate remains a global problem.pic.twitter.com/u8svMbSqoT

897597527578562561 2017-08-15 23:15:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I allways had a feeling that when the Timberwolves would make the playoffs again the world would end...
897596246415867904 2017-08-15 23:09:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Meanwhile in the Netherlands. Still no government. At times like these i'm actually quite okay with that as our status quo.
897594164753444865 2017-08-15 23:01:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> This list could go on and on. Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-Un, Erdogan, Putin..   Terrible leadership has allways been a worldwide phenomenon.

897115149529735170 2017-08-14 15:18:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> First the swastika & little mustaches. Now Tiki-torches. Those Nazi's have a talent for hijacking things and making them symbols of hate.
897109989776658432 2017-08-14 14:57:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers Combine his hair and the mustache of the guy behind him and you can see who he really is. Although that was already pretty obvious.
897105741261279233 2017-08-14 14:40:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers Please don't. We already have enough racist douchebags over here. Some might actually do it.

895778109798141952 2017-08-10 22:45:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I kind of like the new jerseys. I fear the release of the lime green version though.
895039790604849153 2017-08-08 21:51:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @nba_poop_hat I think i saw he wasn't on a two way contract. Will play for iowa wolves and might make roster later.
895039047294431234 2017-08-08 21:48:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Suspicious_Sal So Wigs would still be valued more highly.
895038827651358720 2017-08-08 21:47:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Suspicious_Sal You might even see Wiggins as mediocre. But i think even if Okafor met his pre-draft expectations his style of play does not fit league
895038435316170753 2017-08-08 21:46:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Suspicious_Sal I think i saw you say : " paying mediocre big men is worse than paying mediocre wings". I think you're right.Wings have more value in league
894904102693597185 2017-08-08 12:52:19 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon But yes those are two very different things..and the distinction matters
894903903011180544 2017-08-08 12:51:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon Fair point about offending the state. But in the trailer in looks like those mercenaries have done a bit more than just offending the state
894903379859615744 2017-08-08 12:49:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon The roles are just reversed in this movie
894903308174770176 2017-08-08 12:49:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon But hasn't America done the same in some of their Hollywood action movies? Patriottic, American hero killing enemies of the US?
894545595616169984 2017-08-07 13:07:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @SwanInSaintPaul @ShootShitBBall What do you see as better? When we talk about value on the court/to winning games..he for sure was better than Wiggins

893586198144454656 2017-08-04 21:35:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> After adding Butler,Teague,Taj and Crawford.I'm pretty sure most wolves discussions next season will be about Rubio.Some things never change
893585564129267713 2017-08-04 21:32:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers I like how you vent you're Canis frustration on Twitter. I actually thought it was a good discussion.

893201554022555654 2017-08-03 20:07:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DuncanSmithNBA @RyanXUGSW @IMBrandonRice So what you mean to say is...no i don't have any arguments to support my take
893201127218532353 2017-08-03 20:05:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DuncanSmithNBA @RyanXUGSW @IMBrandonRice His highlights? Are you being serious? Highlights can make a G-league player look like Jordan. Highlights don't mean shit.
893200301628456960 2017-08-03 20:02:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @brittrobson On the court there is no modesty. I think that matters most to Butler.. well i hope it does

893195244065492992 2017-08-03 19:41:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DuncanSmithNBA @RyanXUGSW @IMBrandonRice Got any arguments supporting your take?
893094147048996864 2017-08-03 13:00:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ProfCedar It really is another world in the US.I'm over here why people aren't playing more pick up basketball while looking at 20 guys playing soccer

892838206743478273 2017-08-02 20:03:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers So twitter is now actually Canis. But then a recap in 240 characters?
892801147228041219 2017-08-02 17:35:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @espn @SlimJCMoney @t_mills222 So when it fits your narrative rings matter...but when it doesn't support your argument they don't matter?
892499793771188225 2017-08-01 21:38:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @APkrawczynski @Suspicious_Sal That would be bad...
892499559917785093 2017-08-01 21:37:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> So Melo Trimble waved his no trade clause?

892371035986812929 2017-08-01 13:06:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Will the world revolve around Kyrie Irving if he signs with Suns?
892309382175895552 2017-08-01 09:01:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Etc. as in Crawford?
892294681807261696 2017-08-01 08:03:24 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @JustinPinotti F-ed up though.
892294449249890305 2017-08-01 08:02:29 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @JustinPinotti Awesome show though. Lots of great episodes. Thought episode 1 was quite good too..

890916939593285632 2017-07-28 12:48:45 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @JustinPinotti They made an offical offer Doogie says

890886590158876673 2017-07-28 10:48:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Told her it's just an effort thing. I just got confused by her yelling besides my desk.
890886256493834243 2017-07-28 10:46:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I asked my boss to give me a 300% raise. Not for what i do at the moment but for the potential i have and what i might do in the future.
890880373323911168 2017-07-28 10:23:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BreakTheHuddle Still great though
890876533002436610 2017-07-28 10:08:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BreakTheHuddle I thought they rushed season 5 of BB. Like they had to tie all loose ends in a few episodes. Thought it was the worst season

890662459861684224 2017-07-27 19:57:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @steventurous Timberwolves before Butler/Taj/Crawford joined.

890639033906245632 2017-07-27 18:24:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> I wonder if there ever was a GM who saw a fake twitter trade and thought..hmmm Let's do this!
890637348676882432 2017-07-27 18:17:45 UTC <WolfinBrabant> That was over quicklyhttps://twitter.com/WolfinBrabant/status/890249943910416385

890614689717075969 2017-07-27 16:47:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> What if the Wolves are the 3rd team in a three team trade for Kyrie, doesn't end up with Kyrie..but manage to dump Cole and add a wing?
890611053486264324 2017-07-27 16:33:16 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti https://youtu.be/-Zgmg9-d03U
890568037614669824 2017-07-27 13:42:20 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @HaugenND That i don't disagree with.
890565606801629184 2017-07-27 13:32:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @HaugenND With a lesser role he is still great, isn't he? He has more worth as a great two way player than as offensive only player.
890560456364085252 2017-07-27 13:12:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @JustinPinotti DJ has great officiency...don't make him focal.point of offense with Paul and Griffin around
890559642480369664 2017-07-27 13:08:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @HaugenND With lesser role. (I did overstate the amount of offensive rebounding..just looked it up)
890559537161396225 2017-07-27 13:08:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @HaugenND Even when you have a Butler and Irving/Wiggins who could create their own offense and the D was most lacking? He could still be great on O
890558622954119168 2017-07-27 13:04:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @HaugenND @Aftermath8 Dirks frame and athleticism is nothing like Towns
890557707580837888 2017-07-27 13:01:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @HaugenND We got a lot.of point from offensive boards last season..
890557631613587456 2017-07-27 13:00:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @HaugenND fair point.I mean that when his role on O is smaller(not non-existent )he will probably get enough putbacks to compensate his smaller role
890556871324704769 2017-07-27 12:57:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @HaugenND Towns had the tools and has shown flashes of good D. Dirk never showed anything on D, though
890556083609186304 2017-07-27 12:54:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @JustinPinotti He will get enough putbacks on O regardless
890555841128038400 2017-07-27 12:53:52 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @JustinPinotti Yeah. If we get Kyrie i actually might not mind him wanting to be the ofcal point. Do your sourcery,let Butler run p&r and let KAT focus onD
890553923030978560 2017-07-27 12:46:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @JustinPinotti I think what you said about wiggins/softening his offensive role might even be more important with Towns
890255869677535235 2017-07-26 17:01:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TwolvesBlog @Camden_Cash Show interest and get turned down
890254783482925057 2017-07-26 16:57:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TwolvesBlog I don't know
890250555410526208 2017-07-26 16:40:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @thedailywolf Maybe that's why Wigs seemed to lose interest for 24 min per game
890249943910416385 2017-07-26 16:38:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Best thing about all the Kyrie talk. People  have shut up about Lonzo/Lavar Ball.
890249288571379714 2017-07-26 16:35:45 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA That happens. Think Wigs has the potential to be better on D. He has the tools.
890248827323772930 2017-07-26 16:33:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA The ceiling is the roof
890247889930379264 2017-07-26 16:30:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Wolves going from incompetent to Thibs/Towns/Butler/Kyrie in two seasons changed everything i believe in.pic.twitter.com/lAkJdKFjtl

890238621411926018 2017-07-26 15:53:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TravLyleCzech Would like it if Irving would mention Malik and respectfully declined wearing nr 2.
890234699133722624 2017-07-26 15:37:46 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @APkrawczynski @MinnySportsTalk @TheBumbleBill That must be a lot of picks then. Melo isn't worth much
890207816765640704 2017-07-26 13:50:57 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @JustinPinotti @tha1355 Kyrie does match well with what Thibs want on offense. But yeah...you might be right.
890207642026692609 2017-07-26 13:50:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @tha1355 @JustinPinotti Could be.
890205906994069504 2017-07-26 13:43:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HaugenND @JustinPinotti @tha1355 But he didn't need to. We had Lavine and otjer assets. Situation is different now.
890162829109723136 2017-07-26 10:52:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> Lebron IS the Cavs system.So ofcourse Kyrie's numbers are bad when he's on the floor without Lebron. Cavs just make shit up when Lebron sits
890161526052716544 2017-07-26 10:47:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers Have you named him? I have a suggestion if you haven't : Splinter
890160912866344960 2017-07-26 10:44:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @22wiggins @howlintwolf @Vbajor10 @JoeGrizzly99 @kadederek Potentially a better defender. He has been terrible the last few seasons.
890016113383415808 2017-07-25 01:09:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @MikeAndMike @Honest516 If you really think CP is bad at defense. I dont know what to tell you

I get that. And i get being a Rubio fan. But you don't root for a club just for the colour of their jersey

Rooting for a player only. If i go to a feyenoord match. The club is almost like religion to most.

889610721784410112 2017-07-24 22:18:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @GameofReindeers The thing is... it's not Canis. I mean there is also a post with Kyrie>Chris Paul...and no Rubio
889610136091840512 2017-07-24 22:15:59 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @WFJ33 @JustinPinotti @canishoopus If he stays away from Canis any longer..that might be over soon.

889607448293769220 2017-07-24 22:05:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> 48M/3years for Gasol is a great move.It's the SpursThey don't make bad decisions.This just means Gasol is better and younger than i thought.

889602504606011392 2017-07-24 21:45:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> With all this Butler/Wiggins/Kyrie talk this offseason ..let's take a second to thank the Basketball gods for Towns. The Wolves are his team
889599053222301696 2017-07-24 21:31:56 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon The fair in front of my house.
889589150017572864 2017-07-24 20:52:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BrianSampsonNBA That's waaay too much to give up for Kyrie. I agree.

889537556416798720 2017-07-24 17:27:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TravLyleCzech @Phantele_ As long as he doesn't go play overseas...he might fall of the earth

889534229968814080 2017-07-24 17:14:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @freetyus These shots are uncontested and actually go in...

889531626857930753 2017-07-24 17:04:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @acceptedmystery @GameofReindeers @Michelobius But Irving didn't really improve...you are right about that.
889531391758782465 2017-07-24 17:03:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @acceptedmystery @GameofReindeers @Michelobius The thing with Rubio though...he didn't improve either
889530597164675073 2017-07-24 16:59:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti Maybe the circling will get out of hand and PG-13 and Westbrook end up in NY
889529672492560384 2017-07-24 16:56:15 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @acceptedmystery @GameofReindeers Thibs yelling might help..it is a lot more straight forward.
889529204630577152 2017-07-24 16:54:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus @Michelobius THIS
889528618027806720 2017-07-24 16:52:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @acceptedmystery @GameofReindeers Maybe. I think Irving is who he is though..can't really see him improve much on D. That's where i might prefer Wigs..he just might improve D
889527852412129280 2017-07-24 16:49:01 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @acceptedmystery @GameofReindeers Yeah i can imagine..Lebron having that effect on a person. Starting to think passive agressive mom is Lebrons Bit account.
889527420730126336 2017-07-24 16:47:18 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @acceptedmystery @GameofReindeers Maybe could get Shumpert in deal too...solves wing problem
889527312634580993 2017-07-24 16:46:52 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @acceptedmystery @GameofReindeers Kyrie would be fine , off ball too. He's quite big for a PG..and is a great shooter. Teague+Irving would be fine until 15 dec.
889526695014924288 2017-07-24 16:44:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @acceptedmystery @GameofReindeers I hope you're right.
889526367699841024 2017-07-24 16:43:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @acceptedmystery @GameofReindeers Him being a ball hog, playing no defense and wanting to be the focal point do worry me a bit, though + Cavs sucked with Lebron on bench.
889525959694725121 2017-07-24 16:41:30 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Suspicious_Sal @JustinPinotti @Michelobius I heard he wants out.. he's tired of being second fiddle..  Durant's shadow blocks the limelight.
889525224168976385 2017-07-24 16:38:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Suspicious_Sal @JustinPinotti @Michelobius Curry..i mean you've seen the GIF
889524241359654912 2017-07-24 16:34:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Suspicious_Sal @JustinPinotti @Michelobius He's obviously on the decline..
889523358039199744 2017-07-24 16:31:09 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @acceptedmystery @GameofReindeers Rubio or Kyrie?
889523241508900865 2017-07-24 16:30:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @acceptedmystery @GameofReindeers But Rubio> Kyrie is a dumb take imo
889523096398569472 2017-07-24 16:30:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @acceptedmystery @GameofReindeers I think we will be fine either way.. With Wiggings were good and with Kyrie we're good. I don't like him though. I really don't like him.
889522233789624321 2017-07-24 16:26:41 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @acceptedmystery @GameofReindeers It's not possible to find a Batman , Kyrie wants to be Robin for..you can try though

889518842841616387 2017-07-24 16:13:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Suspicious_Sal @Michelobius @JustinPinotti But..but..that's just based on your eye test

888931854153392128 2017-07-22 01:20:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti Survival of the fittest
888931523319214080 2017-07-22 01:19:25 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti Recess in the Netherlands is quite different
888920570150236160 2017-07-22 00:35:53 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @canishoopus Tottenham...sigh
888798774834982912 2017-07-22 16:31:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ontheprowl_MN Kyrie is a tall pg and could play off ball some. IF he's willing...   prolly not . Nevermind.
888791899137552384 2017-07-22 16:04:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti A lot of things can kill you there though. And if you sail to far into the sea you could fall of the earth.
888790018562633728 2017-07-22 15:57:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti There isn't any pg more different than Rubio...
888789437240496128 2017-07-22 15:54:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti He does have a crazy handle.But if we're gonna talk from fan perspective.Likeability counts for me too and Kyrie sure as hell isn't likeable
888788566813310976 2017-07-22 15:51:21 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti Fair point. Boogie is a 6'11 baby though
888787447122984961 2017-07-22 15:46:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti Well they didn't really handle the Griffin situation all that well...
888784137309622272 2017-07-22 15:33:45 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @brittrobson The ball is round, the world is flat Kyrie wants out, i think he's mad.
888783389595234304 2017-07-22 15:30:47 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti My guess.. No
888783344007352320 2017-07-22 15:30:36 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti It wouldn't surprise me Kyrie really doesn't want to be second fiddle. Problem is Cavs sucked with Lebron on bench. Can he be option 1a?
888778944278876160 2017-07-22 15:13:07 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Michelobius @JustinPinotti And would be good for NBA... some stars should play in the east...and maybe the Knicks couls become contender with Porzi+Kyrie. East is badd
888778520176058368 2017-07-22 15:11:26 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @Michelobius Exactly
888777940242227202 2017-07-22 15:09:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @Michelobius That's what worries me if he woukd come to Wolves. Thinking he is 1a,1b and 1c option...while he shouldn't be
888727732447846400 2017-07-22 11:49:37 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Timberwolves @rodman99mn Not wanting to play along side the best player ever as a pg.I doubt he would be good for the the lockerroom+ bad defense.Wigs might improveD
888718380324311040 2017-07-22 11:12:28 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Timberwolves @rodman99mn + the Cavs were pretty bad with Kyrie on the floor without Lebron.. he hasn't proven to be able to be a 1a option on a contender..
888717236982173696 2017-07-22 11:07:55 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Timberwolves @rodman99mn Kind of worried about Kyrie wanting to be the focal point of the offense.. With Towns and Butler.. Should Kyrie be 1 in the pecking order?
888489268016009216 2017-07-21 20:02:03 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @JustinPinotti @GameofReindeers My rec's aint enough. Plus the threads are half the size ever since you took your hoopus sabattical
888482018140594177 2017-07-21 19:33:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @talkhoops I don't think it's crazy to think Towns will play at MVPlevel next year plus a top ten player in Butler + Wiggins.Underperforming if 10 seed
888479937849700354 2017-07-21 19:24:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @talkhoops But you might be right..west is insane right now and well..it's the Wolves.
888479711868923905 2017-07-21 19:24:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @talkhoops Just saying 8-10 range is a bit low. I think an improved Towns plus adding Butler should be enough improvement to get in the playoffs
888479034845405184 2017-07-21 19:21:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @talkhoops I think you underestimate Towns impact a bit here,if he's improved from last year,especially defensively+Butler.That alone should be enough
888477132413960192 2017-07-21 19:13:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @KarlTowns @Timberwolves But i'm a wolves fan for 20 years... :( I just never had twitter
888272284070273026 2017-07-20 05:39:50 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @JustinPinotti Things have been a bit more optimistic lately. You quit for real? Or just taking a break?
888038491321446402 2017-07-20 14:10:49 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball Lebron + random summer league roster
887793142535249921 2017-07-19 21:55:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @talkhoops Zach Lavine?
887792639529160705 2017-07-19 21:53:54 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @MarkJKim_ Outkast- Aquemini Raekwon - Only built for Cuban lynx  Biggie- Ready to die  Opgezwolle - Eigen Wereld Nas-Illmatic
887789198123683840 2017-07-19 21:40:13 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @hoopshype You can stop the video at..  'Why trade for him?'
887788322097123328 2017-07-19 21:36:44 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @tha1355 But you're right...   i feel quite optimistic about the state of this team. Towns/ Wiggins/ Butler are who really matter. Awesome core
887787478484123649 2017-07-19 21:33:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @tha1355 Takes time to get used to some sort of competence. After the way this team has been run it's normal to be wary of Taj/Teague/Smoove signings
887781611718279169 2017-07-19 21:10:05 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DWolfsonKSTP Ha! Didn't expect a reply! Would be a nice get for sure...need some decent wing depth... even when Allen won't stretch te floor. Defense!
887779944981516288 2017-07-19 21:03:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @HPbasketball @DerekJamesNBA @canishoopus But...but..pythagorean wins
887777858801807363 2017-07-19 20:55:10 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @julietlitman @ringer Just like Lonzo Ball is the GOAT already
887777231250042884 2017-07-19 20:52:40 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @RyanJamesMN Finally! A wolves free age....  oh wait..
887770164544102400 2017-07-19 20:24:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DWolfsonKSTP So....if i understand correctly... this means that Tony Allen signs with the Wolves?
887767558086066178 2017-07-19 20:14:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @talkhoops Don't let Trump see this...or he will start a Cavalry division
887767021139656704 2017-07-19 20:12:06 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @talkhoops @BullsConf @GameofReindeers Awesome
887766924259667968 2017-07-19 20:11:43 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon @AGoot18 How old are you?
887766584005144576 2017-07-19 20:10:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @talkhoops @BullsConf @GameofReindeers did you do this?
887766039366422533 2017-07-19 20:08:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @GameofReindeers @TrooperGalactus The only logical answer
887621199580327936 2017-07-19 10:32:39 UTC <WolfinBrabant> LaVar Ball is like those moms who put their little kids in pageant shows because they couldn't accomplish their life long dreams themselves
887038159695085569 2017-07-17 19:55:52 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DerekJamesNBA The Alexander's got tickets to the game?
887029841077391361 2017-07-17 19:22:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @outsidethenba @HPbasketball @DerekJamesNBA Add Morrow
886928217940127744 2017-07-17 12:39:00 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @mjawandz11 @JacobRude @paulmobuckets This should workpic.twitter.com/aUX59Zits5
886926275474071553 2017-07-17 12:31:17 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon But seriously though..Kris Dunn has the chance to become one of the best players coming out of Providence the last decade? That's not good.
886925735193190401 2017-07-17 12:29:08 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon At least God Shammgod was awesome
886850349323124736 2017-07-17 07:29:34 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DWolfsonKSTP @joshvanduyn So? Doesn't mean we need another back up 5 does it? We need wings...  and really, Kendrick? Come on now..
886724741113008128 2017-07-16 23:10:27 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @DWolfsonKSTP @joshvanduyn Towns/Dieng/Taj/Aldrich isn't enough depth at the 5?
886618631286779904 2017-07-16 16:08:48 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @heisenjan @Patrick_Fenelon That's true.. not really the finesse player like Federer ...  injuries suck.
886617465643560960 2017-07-16 16:04:11 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @heisenjan @Patrick_Fenelon Never to late to have his renaissance. Look at Federer. Playing better than ever right now. Nadal was kind of awesome on clay lately too.
886616547447492609 2017-07-16 16:00:32 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @heisenjan @Patrick_Fenelon Nadal was out that year.Soderling was the finalist if i'm not mistaken. Makes winning Roland Garros a little less impressive. Counts though
885887015866306564 2017-07-14 15:41:38 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TSRTIME @SouhanStrib @APkrawczynski Thanks for your reply! Would be interesting if they signed him....injury history is scary though..
885885445263028224 2017-07-14 15:35:23 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @TSRTIME @APkrawczynski @SouhanStrib You mentioned Budinger.. How serious is the Wolves interest in him?
885862245749723136 2017-07-14 14:03:12 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon @DerekJamesNBA Maybe those beers made him such a great trash talker?
885821770825162752 2017-07-14 11:22:22 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @AverageJer @nba_poop_hat Did Jimmy Butler pass that champagne?
885821054781980673 2017-07-14 11:19:31 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @Patrick_Fenelon @JustinPinotti You are not getting great players with the room exception. Crawford has a chance to earn the contract. His contract was/is not the problem
885433932791132160 2017-07-13 09:41:14 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @ShamsCharania @gerdauz13 Show some respect. He is working until the middle of the night...and what are you doing with your life?
885259213093695489 2017-07-12 22:06:58 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @BreakTheHuddle @DerekJamesNBA Well another reason to not get my sports info from FOX...at my work place...
885258864907743233 2017-07-12 22:05:35 UTC <WolfinBrabant> @fenderbender152 If Tyus Jones is SummerLeague MVP, why not be NBA MVP. Free Tyus , Thibs
