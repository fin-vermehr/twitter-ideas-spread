706197334917570560 2016-03-05 19:18:59 UTC <scawdery> @mjrobbins could be either. Most euro cinemas show films both in original with subtitles (OV) and dubbed over. Germany tends to dub a lot
706181977532178432 2016-03-05 18:17:58 UTC <scawdery> @CeriKitchen @tasteandseason fair enough! But I quite like that my 14 yr old can make the basics and help out at home!
706175083551784963 2016-03-05 17:50:34 UTC <scawdery> @tasteandseason @CeriKitchen of course they should cook how will they look after themselves when they are older if not?

698544842998161408 2016-02-13 16:30:43 UTC <scawdery> @Mr_Pauly_C @Jeremy_Hunt is a disgrace and should be sacked. Arrogant and deluded. Dangerous. History will not judge him well.
