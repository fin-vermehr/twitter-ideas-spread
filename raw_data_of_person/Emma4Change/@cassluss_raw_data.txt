932406511547985921 2017-11-19 00:33:30 UTC <cassluss> In no way is this legislation a solution. Teachers went 5 weeks without pay, while students went 5 weeks without learning.  @Kathleen_Wynne could have stepped in WEEKS ago when this all began, but sat idly by. Well be the ones facing hardship, and it could have all been avoided.

737846508272418816 2016-05-31 03:21:30 UTC <cassluss> you don't owe anyone an explanation for leaving a situation that makes you feel uncomfortable
737839007598530560 2016-05-31 02:51:42 UTC <cassluss> secretly hoping that nobody answers this skype call so that I can keep jamming to the music

737345057280294913 2016-05-30 18:08:55 UTC <cassluss> the best feeling in the world is when you open up your fruit gushers package and they're all red

735653191350652932 2016-05-25 02:06:03 UTC <cassluss> the regret of not doing something at all often lasts longer than the regret of doing something stupid
