When you make it about the test,  you are distracted from whats really keeping your child from getting a  good education. - @JohannaG_NYC @Network4pubEd @NYSAPE

962689917452242944 2018-02-11 14:08:56 UTC <BiancaTanis> @DianeNeal @goodey2shoes_ Because the math and local hx is clear, a 3rd part candidate will hand the race to Faso. Thats why.

821502497273610240 2017-01-17 23:40:32 UTC <BiancaTanis> DeVos will not commit to uphold Title IX guidance. Isn't that a no-brainer? Is this real? #DumpDevos

821496701697585154 2017-01-17 23:17:31 UTC <BiancaTanis> DeVos will not commit to reappear in front of Senate after they receive her completed Ethics review. Not shocking. #DeVosHearing @NYSAPE

718644581831733249 2016-04-08 03:39:54 UTC <BiancaTanis> If even one child in NYS sat for 18 hours of testing this week, we must all stand up & opt out. Hurt one child, hurt all of our kids.
718547077878398976 2016-04-08 21:12:27 UTC <BiancaTanis> Do untimed test violate NYS 1% test cap? I bet the kids who just took 18 hours of tests would say so @NYSEDNews @timesunion @CapitalTonight

695445812705259522 2016-02-04 03:16:17 UTC <BiancaTanis> @ScottMDolan @NYSAPE @CarlKornNYSUT It is a matrix based on two components, hence 50/50
695440565106651138 2016-02-04 02:55:26 UTC <BiancaTanis> @ScottMDolan @NYSAPE @CarlKornNYSUT By regulation, evals are based 50% performance measure, 50% observation. It's pretty B/W
695440110226055168 2016-02-04 02:53:37 UTC <BiancaTanis> @ScottMDolan @NYSAPE @CarlKornNYSUT 50% of eval is based on performance measure, that is law. Plain and simple.
