723165818297683968 2016-04-21 15:05:41 UTC <taylormillsss> To many relationships end now a days because someone cheated & that makes me really sad
722996290439798784 2016-04-20 03:52:02 UTC <taylormillsss> remember when The Fault In Our Stars was a thing

713089428621799424 2016-03-24 19:45:43 UTC <taylormillsss> If you think relationships are laughing, smiling and being happy 100% of the time , you need a reality check
