Norway option would mean taking most of the EU rules, having no say on how they are set, and paying a lot for the privilege 
948158057024032768 2018-01-02 11:44:31 UTC <eurotyke> @OwenJones84 @Danosaur1 @2018Time4Change Many are coming over to #StopBrexit, but leavers come with many conflicting visions that some will not let go no matter how unrealistic or damaging. But that is why we have parliamentary democracy, to reconcile this, and why we need a meaningful opposition, hence #FBPE

So why is Corbyn ignoring #theNewWillOfThePeople ?

944527767227588608 2017-12-23 11:19:02 UTC <eurotyke> @JMPSimor @ammiral @Discoinfernal The point is that the EU have reliable detailed audits whereas the UK does not.

718430454920179712 2016-04-08 13:29:02 UTC <eurotyke> @EUwatchers @qprmicky @Akabilky @EUWatchers @euobs obviously, that's why all use the Euro today, and nobody has to show a passport to get into the UK?
718418335042519040 2016-04-08 12:40:53 UTC <eurotyke> @EUwatchers @qprmicky @Akabilky @EUWatchers @euobs Sure they did, not, Dutch government has to decide what to do first, that's democracy...
718415154858356737 2016-04-08 12:28:15 UTC <eurotyke> @EUwatchers @qprmicky @Akabilky @EUWatchers @euobs poor UK, in the same class as Greece now?
