970630846288932865 2018-03-05 12:03:21 UTC <BooBooRx> Happy Monday, Sugar!   I read somewhere that the word INSPIRATION derives from the Latin; "Sanctum Espiritus",meaning 'breath of God'..a lovely thought! Providence is whispering.  "We're rarely ill..but if we are, we go out & eat grass til we feel better" Gallico  xo

968588190633390081 2018-02-27 20:46:34 UTC <BooBooRx> @stokedsag71 Yes .always..agreed.
968587993119379457 2018-02-27 20:45:47 UTC <BooBooRx> @stokedsag71 Thank you...just common sense really...and now..back to work. 
968587430113763328 2018-02-27 20:43:33 UTC <BooBooRx> @stokedsag71 Right. 
968586190348800000 2018-02-27 20:38:37 UTC <BooBooRx> @stokedsag71 That's true..but they need to learn manners as well...they do not come out of the womb knowing manners either..they must be instructed..but.again.some parents are a bit too self absorbed.. It is a personal choice .Some choose to not teach their child. Who suffers in the long run?
968576844797743104 2018-02-27 20:01:29 UTC <BooBooRx> @thehill Ohhhhpuleeeze!... They just will NOT give up their shares of NRA blood money, will they.....under any circumstances.  They sicken me.
968572572173561856 2018-02-27 19:44:31 UTC <BooBooRx> I can see that actually happening..https://twitter.com/amazinmikey/status/968538385336950784
968570704374521856 2018-02-27 19:37:05 UTC <BooBooRx> @stokedsag71 Yeah...I think so too....He can only relate to money...he doesn't seem to be able to feel true happiness..just from appreciating a pretty sunset or flower or anything that has no $$ monetary value...its not a good way to live one's life..It must be such a hollow existence..
968569042721296385 2018-02-27 19:30:29 UTC <BooBooRx> @JochenML Jochen..Thank You so much! ...I will remember..I promiso!.. My friend Marta will buzz me on my phone to remind me she is with me....I appreciate all the kind words...  Yeeeks! Time is flying by today!    I will let you know the results!
968567818194219008 2018-02-27 19:25:37 UTC <BooBooRx> @stokedsag71 Yes I think the simple days were much better..especially for children..I don't like to see them always on their phones and taking selfies... There is no longer talking together..I have too many pre-teen patients AND their parent who I have to ask to please put the phone down.
968566162618503168 2018-02-27 19:19:02 UTC <BooBooRx> @stokedsag71 Mm..I've been hearing his name all day at work...interesting...
968565544747196418 2018-02-27 19:16:35 UTC <BooBooRx> @stokedsag71 Yes..his whole life and each statement is a fabrication...I don't think he knows how to truly care about anything...he is too busy looking for the next quick-money deal..he can not even appreciate life's small joys...too busy wheeling & dealing for money...A sad existence..

961665119964016640 2018-02-08 18:16:46 UTC <BooBooRx> @KrisMares2 Hi Kris...You're right...the wording seems a bit harsh..invoking the same rules for Europeans as would apply w Trumps immigrant rules... Can't really blame them if it's meant that way...but...maybe it's just this particular writer.

He does not know... I feel better and everyone is happy."   (O Filomena!  & you look so demure!)  Be safe, Lovies! You are loved..Good day!

Be safe..you are loved! xo

960262534698799104 2018-02-04 21:23:23 UTC <BooBooRx> @LCNM99 That wasn't audacity...it was  thinly veiled sarcasm....he knew what he was doing when he tweeted that.....and he's amplifying by that tweet to everyone that he WON...he won big money for all of his friends...Its a great big smirking F.U. to all  the rest..next? SoSec & Medicare.

960256163219673090 2018-02-04 20:58:04 UTC <BooBooRx> @MaTaliano I believe his (Trudeau's) explanation about this was that when/if  the enemy is killed (say, suicide bombers or killed by resurgence) the enemy wins as far as causing massive destruction AND going to Allah...and of course the meeting of his prize..the 16 vestal virgins. 
960248113024860161 2018-02-04 20:26:05 UTC <BooBooRx> @highbrow_nobrow @shbeaty No, honey....okay fine... ..So Jesus had his flu shot so you would follow his lead....stop trying to confuse + frighten people. He doesn't like that. He told me. When I gave him his flu shot.

960147317889347584 2018-02-04 13:45:33 UTC <BooBooRx> @MrsDanaD Yes!! ..& always so pleasing in its simplicity, right? If tourists would only follow the back roads to Italy's everyday life...that's where the memories are truly made..The big tourist sites are great too..but the simplicity & welcoming of the countryside..the best! cin  cin!

960139460347342848 2018-02-04 13:14:20 UTC <BooBooRx> @tflynn14 Tom...I could not agree with you more...and although it may not technically be a sin to be wealthy, the differences are measurable between a Bill Gates and a Donald Trump. There's wealth ..and there's wealth.  the American way should be concern & help for all...
960137889572184064 2018-02-04 13:08:06 UTC <BooBooRx> Good mornin', Tweetie friends..

Have a SUPER day!..xo

957966063651708929 2018-01-29 13:18:02 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B James, you deserve every morsel of that admiration...I'm not sure people understand exactly what it is that you do..and I know that you can't talk about it in depth, but they should all know that your dedication is to be admired for its oh-so distinctive rarity!  Thank you.
957962537970040832 2018-01-29 13:04:01 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B Ahhh..that look of absolute contentment! maybe he needs a toothpick?

957957550674235393 2018-01-29 12:44:12 UTC <BooBooRx> ..Actually, Trump says that he's the LEAST rascist.. so...props where they're due, eh? https://twitter.com/PalmerReport/status/957627210663415808

956714319730880513 2018-01-25 02:24:03 UTC <BooBooRx> @snopes @barali4793 Me too!  I'm the youngest...+ when my brothers weren't beating me senseless, I listened to their 60' era music ...they had so many records. I think all of their allowance went toward records..my sister especially...for Beatles...Hermits..? Is that correct? I think?
956711762564472832 2018-01-25 02:13:53 UTC <BooBooRx> @snopes @barali4793 Sock hop..I don't know about that?  Sock like socks on the feet, you mean?

952537526333526016 2018-01-14 13:46:58 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I dont know the answer...its more about the WHY?  We have some sick beings who walk among us..we do our best to help..to try to bring them to the point where they re-learn how to "human"..unfortunately..its not always successful..obviously.
952533705087766528 2018-01-14 13:31:47 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I think so..yep.  Theres SO MUCH more going on that's beneath the radar..we see only bits & pieces..there's an entire subculture...plotting..meeting...waiting for the right time to rise up. And we seem to have no clue as to how to stop it. That kind of keeps me awake some nights.
952532679748210688 2018-01-14 13:27:42 UTC <BooBooRx> @elynnhardi Its just...inconceivable...so horrific...hard to fathom someone would place monetary loss/value over the wellbeing & care of an animal who ran his best.

952528908083191810 2018-01-14 13:12:43 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B You know....you just have to keep asking..."How much longer do we stand for this?...for ALL of it?"

952160253675700229 2018-01-13 12:47:49 UTC <BooBooRx> @jbarker5525 Agreed!
952159989354975232 2018-01-13 12:46:46 UTC <BooBooRx> @StephenWLaPoint Ahh...DID they, now ... am I surprised? Nope. How did we get this lucky, Stephen?

952155423779454978 2018-01-13 12:28:37 UTC <BooBooRx> @aminterest @WendySiegelman Can't say I'm surprised...The Central Bank is wiping out private sector banks...Any bets on the US following suit...soon?

952154183809069056 2018-01-13 12:23:42 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 For Surely!  does not equal news.
952151890573320192 2018-01-13 12:14:35 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 That seems to be a BIG problem in America... TV networks pandering for ratings. Gimme a network that says it like it is!  Hate these versions of reporting...is it Real? Is it TRUE?  or is it just sensationalized BS for ratings? Trump is right..they'll be LOST w/out him.
952150554138079232 2018-01-13 12:09:16 UTC <BooBooRx> @StephenWLaPoint Why am I not surprised to learn this, Stephen?  Him and his White Power signaling... He's a nasty boy.

951641075453775873 2018-01-11 02:24:47 UTC <BooBooRx> @EdKrassen @leturos He said Mexico would pay for the wall.. guaranteed it.."Don't worrr-y...Mexico is gonna pay!" .... It's HIS promise, not ours...
951630129771503616 2018-01-11 01:41:18 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B I hope so...and I understand..but he's rallying his base. And Rex Tillerson frankly sux at his job...he's afraid to criticize Trump in any way shape or form..all the while allowing oil drilling along the East Coast? The words Trump said matter, but he won't help.
951627894723416064 2018-01-11 01:32:25 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B Agreed...it was a typical Trump rascist remark...I'm thinking he will say nothing, though, to repudiate...(RexT) ....  Thinking this will be forgotten just like all the rest of the stuff he's said & done..day after day.
951626169966833664 2018-01-11 01:25:33 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B He's your boss?!  Holy crap. Sorry about the snarky  comments I've made about him.   (I still kinda mean them, though)  ahhhboy. Mi dispiaggia..

That tail doesn't seem to go with the rest, .but thats ok...I will never buy one.

949743545371504645 2018-01-06 20:44:41 UTC <BooBooRx> @realDonaldTrump He's, " like" , stuck at twelve...
949661929819209728 2018-01-06 15:20:22 UTC <BooBooRx> @realDonaldTrump @waltshaub I hear in my mind the voice of Oz's Cowardly Lion as I read your/Trump's words...ending with, Cuh-uh-ridge!

949649303987019776 2018-01-06 14:30:12 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Yes...there's a good chance that could happen...They say that government is sloowww to act....daily we see that it's true...the cronieism is rampant...they are awful people. Greed is the Gawd they worship...HURRY PLEASE, MR MUELLER! 
949643283331977217 2018-01-06 14:06:16 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Is me! 
949638062329524225 2018-01-06 13:45:32 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 They are the group of his favorite followers...the un-eds who melted at the sight of him at all the rallies...many of them still do.  (gag,... scuse me)
949637577040068608 2018-01-06 13:43:36 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Yep...it IS something...but obviously not unheard of... he is the prime example..lots of precise medical sense...but common sense? Notsomucha. 
949636860770422784 2018-01-06 13:40:45 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I think his "persona" was just what they wanted/needed to hear at precisely that moment in time..that  "take charge" protector..the successful business man who was different & was going to fix everything for all of us in his 1st yr...he spoke their language to them. Irresistible.
949633616233025536 2018-01-06 13:27:52 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Lol.....that's SO mean! ...also funny and pretty much on the mark. 
949632762893479938 2018-01-06 13:24:28 UTC <BooBooRx> @ConnieFleeger I think we all (people who care) feel the same way, Connie... I sure don't like it, either..

949631284661379073 2018-01-06 13:18:36 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 And that, dear Scott, is the point... unfortunately, he doesn't understand it himself....We're being led by fainting goats.
949630569230499840 2018-01-06 13:15:45 UTC <BooBooRx> @ConnieFleeger Exactly... JeesaLouisa! Can't turn your back for a minute with those people!

949475931730665473 2018-01-05 03:01:17 UTC <BooBooRx> Oh gosh...no... I'm but a speck in the whole scheme of town management and resources....but I will admit it feels pretty good to have convinced them this time around with a tight budget... but priorities are priorities, right? Thanks again for your support my new Twitter friend!
949474623535681537 2018-01-05 02:56:05 UTC <BooBooRx> @nursek123 Teresa, darlin..Thank you so much!! The stars apparently aligned with the planets and whatever else!  So happy it's over! It sounds awful for me to say, but I'm hoping that one day the AEDs aid in saving one of them or a family member of theirs...then maybe they'll get it! 
949471607667548160 2018-01-05 02:44:06 UTC <BooBooRx> @JaneGummyof3 I didn't have the pleasure of that particular class...wish I had!.. I just got so fed up with their pompous attitudes..like looking at a bunch of  Mitch McConnell faces -miserable!. I kept hearing yours & the others words of encouragement...it helped so much, as always!
949469556556357633 2018-01-05 02:35:57 UTC <BooBooRx> @JaneGummyof3 Thank you so much....the town + the schools will be better equipped...been begging for years!  .... I thank you, sincerely..xo

949464729877131264 2018-01-05 02:16:46 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B Proud of me.  Compared to what YOU do each day??...this was miniscule...but worth the lesson that I got out if it...say NO to THEM about being put off for 2 more weeks..they looked stunned...too bad.  ty my friend...

949067813855080449 2018-01-04 23:59:34 UTC <BooBooRx> @RedTRaccoon @JG_NoPlanet_B Right...that's who I was referencing as his personal Doc...A little pocket money...a little vague diagnosis..a little prewritten script..a little joking ..His thugs waiting in the car....and Trump was good to go.  Only in a GOP America....
949061802305970176 2018-01-04 23:35:41 UTC <BooBooRx> @RedTRaccoon @JG_NoPlanet_B mmm....but not a lot of respect for a doctor who would BS the public like his personal doc did, under Trumps orders...This is far too serious to be playing games at this point.

948352026840322048 2018-01-02 00:35:17 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B I'm not understanding this sudden praise-fest with NYT + Trump...it's madness! New editor + this is how it's going to be!? Are they familiar with German + Polish newspapers who sided with Hitler?... suddenly filled with love & adoration as he transposed into the Fuhrer? No likey.
948313338504777728 2018-01-02 22:01:33 UTC <BooBooRx> @waltshaub It SHOULD be....whats the problem?
948313047571091456 2018-01-02 22:00:24 UTC <BooBooRx> @Rochellelloyd57 Yes he was...I think they must have all had something wonderful to contribute...Ringo and Paul are the only ones left now. I wonder how they feel about US Gov. today.. ? 
948310732466196480 2018-01-02 21:51:12 UTC <BooBooRx> @Rochellelloyd57 Yes...he held such admiration from so many Americans...his words were those of protesters, I believe...very wonderful...
948309576000180226 2018-01-02 21:46:36 UTC <BooBooRx> @Rochellelloyd57 I shared this, Rochelle...glad that I noticed it!  thank you for sharing it..

948224012731191296 2018-01-02 16:06:36 UTC <BooBooRx> @Rochellelloyd57 I dont know, but I can tell you that I have most definitely learned that ANYthing is possible with our government. Nothing much surprises me anymore. 
948222451338633216 2018-01-02 16:00:24 UTC <BooBooRx> @Rochellelloyd57 I knowwww, Rochelle, right??  The Dems have been so timid!...almost comically so.  I feel like even Pel & Shu know that no matter what, as long as R's are in charge, theyre going to laugh and just bulldoze over us as often as they please. Daringly so!  WE NEED STRONG LEADERS. 
948221006673522689 2018-01-02 15:54:39 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B Awww...how cute is that?! ...Ever the brotherly protector! (Or maybe the brotherly wannabe scoffer?)   *They're GREAT fur kids, those Gow pups!

948195452993900544 2018-01-02 14:13:07 UTC <BooBooRx> @kurtresists Pre-cious! 
948195054383976449 2018-01-02 14:11:32 UTC <BooBooRx> @kurtresists I would LOVE to just quietly slip right in beside them and make a nuzzle sandwich. 
948190056086409217 2018-01-02 13:51:40 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Really?  It's a real "thing" ...Maybe just called that here in New England?

947994374541103104 2018-01-01 00:54:06 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B Me?  I'm but a mouse in this whole upheaval that will happen. I wish I had more time to make a difference...but once things get organized and moving, l'll do what I can to help.  I'm glad you're here,...more!. Its kind of exciting to know things will begin happening ..Jan.20th.
947989262779248642 2018-01-01 00:33:47 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B I was just kidding you..The Tudor Eng. is quaint & charming...and yes, I think we all agree that we're going to have to organize organize organize.  You know secrets dont you.   Any particular leader(s) in mind?

947943369904476160 2018-01-01 21:31:25 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Next time I put them on her.... Shes out like a light in front of the wood stove. I keep expecting her Grinch style fringe-y hair to catch fire  
947922216863322113 2018-01-01 20:07:22 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I hope so.. Whatever will he do without his gold throne?

947560857986322437 2017-12-31 20:11:28 UTC <BooBooRx> @kurtresists By gosh, I think this oh-so wise person has nailed it!  Day after day of being hoodwinked by Trump & GOP can make us ALL feel beaten down.Thats ok! Our strength will grow from each disappointment, and then WATCH OUT!  Kurt & Gia & all Resistors will slay them all!  2 dramatic?

947556846470094849 2017-12-31 19:55:31 UTC <BooBooRx> @DearAuntCrabby I'm so embarrassed for this country!... To let Puerto Rico fend for themselves - - the epitome of cruel..

The constant need for wheeling & dealing for more & more money. He has no skills; just BIG talk. Tremendous! He harrumphs along; The King.
946341168840921089 2017-12-28 11:24:51 UTC <BooBooRx> @atacamagirl Its ALMOST too incredulous!

Im sure they all just bank it overseas, and yawn & stretch...do you think it gets a little boring for them after a while?
946202595290382336 2017-12-27 02:14:12 UTC <BooBooRx> @subsalr Brilliant...thx!
946199739711852544 2017-12-27 02:02:52 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B This is absolute madness...all of it! Send workers home with a shutdown..then obligated to provide back-pay to them for not working?!??$2.5B. Insanity...as usual. 
946181988851036161 2017-12-27 00:52:20 UTC <BooBooRx> @CNNnewsroom A metaphor for this entire administration....kind of pathetic isn't it?  A box truck. Hiding the president. Out in public. ?

946088648159649792 2017-12-27 18:41:25 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 The price is much too high. : /
946088044251238400 2017-12-27 18:39:01 UTC <BooBooRx> @SharisseC Hi Sharisse, (thanks for following me, btw!)... Yes...I have to agree with you.  For him to do that in front of so many millions of people and still get elected...for his Bus talk with Billy Bush .. still elected...This country is in such turmoil...We need a SANE leader soon! : }
946086126661591041 2017-12-27 18:31:24 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B Thank you, James....They really are pre-cious...even the moody teens......Hope you're feeling a bit better.
945986153441906688 2017-12-27 11:54:09 UTC <BooBooRx> ** Our collective Mea Culpa, to the rest of the world...
945982495824207872 2017-12-27 11:39:37 UTC <BooBooRx> Good mornin Schmoopys!...Ahhh, it was lovely while it lasted, but time now to get back to my working family & the kiddos.  Im refreshed & feeling ready for whatever ails em!  I love their little faces...one by one.  Happy Wednesday, and please be safe out there.. Bye!  xo
945772645823414272 2017-12-26 21:45:45 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I mean... SOMEONE has to pay the price for TREASON and all the RICO and money laundering hoo-ha that has been apparently going on for quite a while..at least since the Miss America Moscow stuff went on.  A little positive good news would be lovely, wouldn't it?  
945771435645198337 2017-12-26 21:40:56 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Yep.  His instability is just so exhausting! ..TWO YEARS for the Nixon investigation, you say???  Oh Jeezalouisa... Okay... well.. maybe we all need to pace ourselves and just RESIST on a daily basis for as long as it takes. Not much else to do until theres a reason to protest.
945766355634094081 2017-12-26 21:20:45 UTC <BooBooRx> @barkflight Ohhhh...hahaaah... phew! I thought it was just me!?  He doesnt seem like the espionage thriller type.. go figure, right? 
945756271243915264 2017-12-26 20:40:41 UTC <BooBooRx> @SRuhle @larryleclair @DianaNYC3 Yet they still cheer him.  Oy.
945754185752039424 2017-12-26 20:32:23 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Yes it is!  Poor Abe was really listing to the left the whole time while talking to the floor... another ones voice & movement were not in sync..  ah well...everything else went off without a hitch..a monumental feat, Im sure.  : )
945752892908163072 2017-12-26 20:27:15 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 That, we will .. I need to work on my lack of patience and desire to begin seeing the judiciary digging in & preparing to rid us of these traitors.  Its difficult to wait, and I just hope it will be worth it. Somehow, I see him avoiding any jail time...I hope Im wrong...  : }
945747870203904001 2017-12-26 20:07:18 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 They always seem to malfunction when we're there...the voices sound like they're all stoned...lol!  
945747005967618048 2017-12-26 20:03:52 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Right! ... There's so much needing to change, incl absolutely no interference by Russia or any other country...and gerrymandering + voter fraud is disastrous for elections. The system is rigged...people will be forever suspicious...can't blame them. RUSSIA put Trump in the WH  
945744449879109632 2017-12-26 19:53:42 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I don't think there's anything THEY could suggest that would influence too many DEMS at this point...I already have some suspicions about the suggestion of bi-partisan work on infrastructure...Trojan Horse....
945743830950834176 2017-12-26 19:51:15 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 SO MANY kind, caring, creative, and brilliant fellow Resistors!.....who could resist their friendship?  #THERESISTANCE
945742929787850752 2017-12-26 19:47:40 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I can envision that! ..and it would be a huge draw for patrons, me thinks. 
945742497837350913 2017-12-26 19:45:57 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Agree....the EC needs to be abolished, and I suspect the body was offered some  hefty $$$$ persuasion.   : |

944266983633309696 2017-12-22 18:02:47 UTC <BooBooRx> @subsalr He bragged he would bring in $5B from overseas wranglings..that would more than finance their robbing of tax money they stole...and um..those SS + Mcare  are not entitlements..those are owned and paid for by workers their whole lives.. the VA needs refurbishing desperately.yes!!
944265089993052160 2017-12-22 17:55:15 UTC <BooBooRx> @barry_corindia @SonofRascus It is unusual...as unusual as the lone Af-Am who stood with Congress proudly after passing the tax scam..he looked so proud...it was disturbing, actually...hard not to yell at the TV,. "Why?!?!!!?"
944263661060796421 2017-12-22 17:49:35 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 You would nevvvver leave. A lot of my family is still there...lemon & olive groves...the aroma of that hillside is intoxicating..I always feel sad to return to US.. it is my place of solace...not the tourist areas..back roads..heaven! 
944261327031296002 2017-12-22 17:40:18 UTC <BooBooRx> @Acosta Thinking the others booked it out of town so they wouldn't be photographed with him signing it for posterity!  It's ALL on him, that way.
944258812860686338 2017-12-22 17:30:19 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I have not been to NZ either... Maybe that's the place to research and visit one day?? ...kind of a preliminary pre-lifestyle change visit?

943983732226215939 2017-12-21 23:17:14 UTC <BooBooRx> I am reduced to tears, but HAPPY ones. Thanks, everyone,for putting up with my whining about the CHIPS program.. it was a heavy weight upon all of us involved in treating these kids.  Michaela, Anthony, Michael D, Michael J, Kaitlynn, & Aaron will have a good chance at life!
943981080364937216 2017-12-21 23:06:42 UTC <BooBooRx> Hello @amazinmikey .. thanks for the support!  
943980209635815424 2017-12-21 23:03:14 UTC <BooBooRx> @pglynn61 So am I, Peg!

943975282674950151 2017-12-21 22:43:40 UTC <BooBooRx> Thankfully!! ....just heard that the CHIPS program will be subsidized until Spring...After that, we will be scattering for help once again...  But, I'll take it!  My "kiddos" will be able to continue treatments.   Grazia Dio!
943970417588555776 2017-12-21 22:24:20 UTC <BooBooRx> @NBCNews @CNN @seanhannity @LarryWilson @ijackmulcahy I know!  Sorry...I just had to take advantage of it.  : ]
943961112579538946 2017-12-21 21:47:21 UTC <BooBooRx> @RVAwonk @Shareblue This guy is nuts.  Running his own investigation....gahhh.  ... We need a break from this every single day nonsense.
943958326056022018 2017-12-21 21:36:17 UTC <BooBooRx> @RBReich A  Marvelous look at the Mayhem that now makes sense!  Thanks for this...it's so great to have you on our team to easily explain this political malarkey that's going on!  (exhausted watching you!) 
943955475430871040 2017-12-21 21:24:57 UTC <BooBooRx> @waltshaub Pathetic.
943954212802703360 2017-12-21 21:19:56 UTC <BooBooRx> @NBCNews @CNN @seanhannity @LarryWilson No..Mr Hannity....you really ARE a "journalist jackass"...

943953051416776704 2017-12-21 21:15:19 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B I'm thinking that they're so blinded by their obscene $$ windfalls that if he suggests it they'll start hauling out the tanks and order goose-stepping marchers from Putin. . That would just about do it for most of us!
943951570974248960 2017-12-21 21:09:26 UTC <BooBooRx> @kurtresists Isn't it just  a-dor-a-ble?  I'm glad it may have given you a little smile.... 
943912291099140104 2017-12-21 18:33:21 UTC <BooBooRx> @DavidCayJ Quintessential Trump! ..scowling...tweeting....&  all dressed up in the illusion of sanity.   Wishing you Good Luck on your book sales! 
943906410085134336 2017-12-21 18:09:59 UTC <BooBooRx> @subsalr Hoping he'll continue to work, in some way, behind the scenes..I think it's where his heart is... More than that, I really don't like how DEMS seem to roll over so easily -this was a Roger Stone (R) stunt..DEMS fold & walk away too easily. Sen.Liz.Warren can't do it all. Fed up?
943903026158493702 2017-12-21 17:56:32 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Contacting our reps goes only so far...usually, it just makes us feel better..our way of 'doing something'...Protesting makes us 'real' on TV, in govt bldgs..but if we are in huge crowds & very loud, & they stand to lose something?  WIN!  JMHO

943845065050476544 2017-12-21 14:06:13 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 The how...yep...thats the question that keeps some of us awake at night.  Speaking of night...Trump has been nothing but a nightmare to so many peoples health & sense of welfare... HOW long will it take to recover is anyones guess. : /
943841568942903296 2017-12-21 13:52:20 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I think we ALL should be....Right now, hes flying high on praise...I feel like when the adoration stops, thats when he reacts negatively... the first signs of disrespect about their tax plan, and he will become a 12 year old once again...and apt to retaliate unreasonably  : }
943839696769245185 2017-12-21 13:44:54 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Exxxactly.  
943839413418721280 2017-12-21 13:43:46 UTC <BooBooRx> @nikkihaley Shes got Trumps lingo down pat...Doesnt understand its about contributing to the WORLD...not about, ...what are we gettin outta this??
943822604388978688 2017-12-21 12:36:58 UTC <BooBooRx> @realDonaldTrump @FBI @MrsDanaD Thanks!  Its still just incredible to me that theyre so brazen and in-your-face about it...they think theyre above any laws or ethics. !?!

943584747065921538 2017-12-20 20:51:49 UTC <BooBooRx> @RoZsaJH I agree....this has been a very long & tumultuous year for us who opose him...but we have to hang on just a little longer... No other choice, right? ...one day...
943578953914159105 2017-12-20 20:28:48 UTC <BooBooRx> @RoZsaJH Let them celebrate ... it wont be long lasting for Trump and many of his cronies...Im guessing that Mueller and company barely sleep... and one day...he will pay.

What other money-making scheme or denial of benefits are they dreaming up (besides health care)?????  After the holidays, watch out!!  Have a good day, Jane..TRY to sleep!
943447374353063938 2017-12-20 11:45:57 UTC <BooBooRx> @JaneGummyof3 Im TRYING to feel positive..maybe tomorrow... ?   The CHIPS issue is huge for all of us.. it will do such damage.
943089314270937088 2017-12-19 12:03:08 UTC <BooBooRx> @Protectanimal13 They just dont get it... every living soul deserves respect. As long as war doesnt doesnt affect them directly (bone spur excuse), theyre fine with sending young troops anywhere at all. War means big $$$ for them.  (Ask Dick Cheney from the Bush era). Feeding kids? Bor-ing

942911843718352896 2017-12-18 00:17:56 UTC <BooBooRx> @foxnewspolitics @JayRodge66 Always a possibility...they will stop at nothing to advance Trump...
942910437758328832 2017-12-18 00:12:21 UTC <BooBooRx> @subsalr Yes he is.. I think what he did was dumb...but I also think she was not the type to exactly be devastated by it...she made money from it...and he was publicly humiliated...  I have HOPE that he may reconsider..but, he probably wont... A very big loss...sad.

970630846288932865 2018-03-05 12:03:21 UTC <BooBooRx> Happy Monday, Sugar!   I read somewhere that the word INSPIRATION derives from the Latin; "Sanctum Espiritus",meaning 'breath of God'..a lovely thought! Providence is whispering.  "We're rarely ill..but if we are, we go out & eat grass til we feel better" Gallico  xo

968570704374521856 2018-02-27 19:37:05 UTC <BooBooRx> @stokedsag71 Yeah...I think so too....He can only relate to money...he doesn't seem to be able to feel true happiness..just from appreciating a pretty sunset or flower or anything that has no $$ monetary value...its not a good way to live one's life..It must be such a hollow existence..
968569042721296385 2018-02-27 19:30:29 UTC <BooBooRx> @JochenML Jochen..Thank You so much! ...I will remember..I promiso!.. My friend Marta will buzz me on my phone to remind me she is with me....I appreciate all the kind words...  Yeeeks! Time is flying by today!    I will let you know the results!
968567818194219008 2018-02-27 19:25:37 UTC <BooBooRx> @stokedsag71 Yes I think the simple days were much better..especially for children..I don't like to see them always on their phones and taking selfies... There is no longer talking together..I have too many pre-teen patients AND their parent who I have to ask to please put the phone down.
968566162618503168 2018-02-27 19:19:02 UTC <BooBooRx> @stokedsag71 Mm..I've been hearing his name all day at work...interesting...
968565544747196418 2018-02-27 19:16:35 UTC <BooBooRx> @stokedsag71 Yes..his whole life and each statement is a fabrication...I don't think he knows how to truly care about anything...he is too busy looking for the next quick-money deal..he can not even appreciate life's small joys...too busy wheeling & dealing for money...A sad existence..

961665119964016640 2018-02-08 18:16:46 UTC <BooBooRx> @KrisMares2 Hi Kris...You're right...the wording seems a bit harsh..invoking the same rules for Europeans as would apply w Trumps immigrant rules... Can't really blame them if it's meant that way...but...maybe it's just this particular writer.

He does not know... I feel better and everyone is happy."   (O Filomena!  & you look so demure!)  Be safe, Lovies! You are loved..Good day!

SoSec & Medicare.

960256163219673090 2018-02-04 20:58:04 UTC <BooBooRx> @MaTaliano I believe his (Trudeau's) explanation about this was that when/if  the enemy is killed (say, suicide bombers or killed by resurgence) the enemy wins as far as causing massive destruction AND going to Allah...and of course the meeting of his prize..the 16 vestal virgins.

960139460347342848 2018-02-04 13:14:20 UTC <BooBooRx> @tflynn14 Tom...I could not agree with you more...and although it may not technically be a sin to be wealthy, the differences are measurable between a Bill Gates and a Donald Trump. There's wealth ..and there's wealth.  the American way should be concern & help for all...

957966063651708929 2018-01-29 13:18:02 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B James, you deserve every morsel of that admiration...I'm not sure people understand exactly what it is that you do..and I know that you can't talk about it in depth, but they should all know that your dedication is to be admired for its oh-so distinctive rarity!  Thank you.
957962537970040832 2018-01-29 13:04:01 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B Ahhh..that look of absolute contentment! maybe he needs a toothpick?

956717755654434817 2018-01-25 02:37:42 UTC <BooBooRx> @JochenML Just responded.....not any difference at all...just that I use half + half instead of milk..use a mandolin for slicing..powdered sugar topping...yum!  Macintosh in winter..Green apples in fall.. Thanks!
956714319730880513 2018-01-25 02:24:03 UTC <BooBooRx> @snopes @barali4793 Me too!  I'm the youngest...+ when my brothers weren't beating me senseless, I listened to their 60' era music ...they had so many records. I think all of their allowance went toward records..my sister especially...for Beatles...Hermits..? Is that correct? I think?
956711762564472832 2018-01-25 02:13:53 UTC <BooBooRx> @snopes @barali4793 Sock hop..I don't know about that?  Sock like socks on the feet, you mean?  Roller skating to music..we had that also..bit I wasn't allowed to go  thre....bowling parties! ...I don't even know if kids do those things any more...all phones + electronics now, yes?  
956710739284242433 2018-01-25 02:09:49 UTC <BooBooRx> @snopes @barali4793 Oh dear...scuse me, please!..I don't know any of the dates when those clothes were popular..just every movie I've seen..they all look alike..dressed the same...even the boys with roll up tee shirts and roll up jeans & grease hair..like the movie Grease? That's how I picture it.
956706493352628224 2018-01-25 01:52:57 UTC <BooBooRx> @snopes @barali4793 Yes!!! I can imagine all of that!...going to school dances ... Did the groups some times sing at the schools?

956698161728425985 2018-01-25 01:19:51 UTC <BooBooRx> @snopes @barali4793 Ohh..it is a fun song!  Do you miss the groups like this??  Its not the same...kind of sad, yes?   I DID find another one..and the main singer is very..um..animated!  He makes big eyes..cute!https://youtu.be/vB08hqjJnPo

952537526333526016 2018-01-14 13:46:58 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I dont know the answer...its more about the WHY?  We have some sick beings who walk among us..we do our best to help..to try to bring them to the point where they re-learn how to "human"..unfortunately..its not always successful..obviously.
952533705087766528 2018-01-14 13:31:47 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I think so..yep.  Theres SO MUCH more going on that's beneath the radar..we see only bits & pieces..there's an entire subculture...plotting..meeting...waiting for the right time to rise up. And we seem to have no clue as to how to stop it. That kind of keeps me awake some nights.
952532679748210688 2018-01-14 13:27:42 UTC <BooBooRx> @elynnhardi Its just...inconceivable...so horrific...hard to fathom someone would place monetary loss/value over the wellbeing & care of an animal who ran his best.

952528908083191810 2018-01-14 13:12:43 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B You know....you just have to keep asking..."How much longer do we stand for this?...for ALL of it?"     And not much being said about the Jan.20th planned marches... Are we all stunned into silence?  Is that it? Too much on a daily basis to digest?  Resistance fatigue?

952154183809069056 2018-01-13 12:23:42 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 For Surely!  does not equal news.
952151890573320192 2018-01-13 12:14:35 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 That seems to be a BIG problem in America... TV networks pandering for ratings. Gimme a network that says it like it is!  Hate these versions of reporting...is it Real? Is it TRUE?  or is it just sensationalized BS for ratings? Trump is right..they'll be LOST w/out him.
952150554138079232 2018-01-13 12:09:16 UTC <BooBooRx> @StephenWLaPoint Why am I not surprised to learn this, Stephen?  Him and his White Power signaling... He's a nasty boy.

951641075453775873 2018-01-11 02:24:47 UTC <BooBooRx> @EdKrassen @leturos He said Mexico would pay for the wall.. guaranteed it.."Don't worrr-y...Mexico is gonna pay!" .... It's HIS promise, not ours...
951630129771503616 2018-01-11 01:41:18 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B I hope so...and I understand..but he's rallying his base. And Rex Tillerson frankly sux at his job...he's afraid to criticize Trump in any way shape or form..all the while allowing oil drilling along the East Coast? The words Trump said matter, but he won't help.
951627894723416064 2018-01-11 01:32:25 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B Agreed...it was a typical Trump rascist remark...I'm thinking he will say nothing, though, to repudiate...(RexT) ....  Thinking this will be forgotten just like all the rest of the stuff he's said & done..day after day.
951626169966833664 2018-01-11 01:25:33 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B He's your boss?!  Holy crap. Sorry about the snarky  comments I've made about him.   (I still kinda mean them, though)  ahhhboy. Mi dispiaggia..

949743545371504645 2018-01-06 20:44:41 UTC <BooBooRx> @realDonaldTrump He's, " like" , stuck at twelve...
949661929819209728 2018-01-06 15:20:22 UTC <BooBooRx> @realDonaldTrump @waltshaub I hear in my mind the voice of Oz's Cowardly Lion as I read your/Trump's words...ending with, Cuh-uh-ridge!

949649303987019776 2018-01-06 14:30:12 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Yes...there's a good chance that could happen...They say that government is sloowww to act....daily we see that it's true...the cronieism is rampant...they are awful people. Greed is the Gawd they worship...HURRY PLEASE, MR MUELLER! 
949643283331977217 2018-01-06 14:06:16 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Is me! 
949638062329524225 2018-01-06 13:45:32 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 They are the group of his favorite followers...the un-eds who melted at the sight of him at all the rallies...many of them still do.  (gag,... scuse me)
949637577040068608 2018-01-06 13:43:36 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Yep...it IS something...but obviously not unheard of... he is the prime example..lots of precise medical sense...but common sense? Notsomucha. 
949636860770422784 2018-01-06 13:40:45 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I think his "persona" was just what they wanted/needed to hear at precisely that moment in time..that  "take charge" protector..the successful business man who was different & was going to fix everything for all of us in his 1st yr...he spoke their language to them. Irresistible.
949633616233025536 2018-01-06 13:27:52 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Lol.....that's SO mean! ...also funny and pretty much on the mark. 
949632762893479938 2018-01-06 13:24:28 UTC <BooBooRx> @ConnieFleeger I think we all (people who care) feel the same way, Connie... I sure don't like it, either..

949631284661379073 2018-01-06 13:18:36 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 And that, dear Scott, is the point... unfortunately, he doesn't understand it himself....We're being led by fainting goats.
949630569230499840 2018-01-06 13:15:45 UTC <BooBooRx> @ConnieFleeger Exactly... JeesaLouisa! Can't turn your back for a minute with those people!

I'm but a speck in the whole scheme of town management and resources....but I will admit it feels pretty good to have convinced them this time around with a tight budget... but priorities are priorities, right? Thanks again for your support my new Twitter friend!
949474623535681537 2018-01-05 02:56:05 UTC <BooBooRx> @nursek123 Teresa, darlin..Thank you so much!! The stars apparently aligned with the planets and whatever else!  So happy it's over! It sounds awful for me to say, but I'm hoping that one day the AEDs aid in saving one of them or a family member of theirs...then maybe they'll get it! 
949471607667548160 2018-01-05 02:44:06 UTC <BooBooRx> @JaneGummyof3 I didn't have the pleasure of that particular class...wish I had!.. I just got so fed up with their pompous attitudes..like looking at a bunch of  Mitch McConnell faces -miserable!. I kept hearing yours & the others words of encouragement...it helped so much, as always!
949469556556357633 2018-01-05 02:35:57 UTC <BooBooRx> @JaneGummyof3 Thank you so much....the town + the schools will be better equipped...been begging for years!  .... I thank you, sincerely..xo

949464729877131264 2018-01-05 02:16:46 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B Proud of me.  Compared to what YOU do each day??...this was miniscule...but worth the lesson that I got out if it...say NO to THEM about being put off for 2 more weeks..they looked stunned...too bad.  ty my friend...

949067813855080449 2018-01-04 23:59:34 UTC <BooBooRx> @RedTRaccoon @JG_NoPlanet_B Right...that's who I was referencing as his personal Doc...A little pocket money...a little vague diagnosis..a little prewritten script..a little joking ..His thugs waiting in the car....and Trump was good to go.  Only in a GOP America....
949061802305970176 2018-01-04 23:35:41 UTC <BooBooRx> @RedTRaccoon @JG_NoPlanet_B mmm....but not a lot of respect for a doctor who would BS the public like his personal doc did, under Trumps orders...This is far too serious to be playing games at this point.

948352026840322048 2018-01-02 00:35:17 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B I'm not understanding this sudden praise-fest with NYT + Trump...it's madness! New editor + this is how it's going to be!? Are they familiar with German + Polish newspapers who sided with Hitler?... suddenly filled with love & adoration as he transposed into the Fuhrer? No likey.
948313338504777728 2018-01-02 22:01:33 UTC <BooBooRx> @waltshaub It SHOULD be....whats the problem?
948313047571091456 2018-01-02 22:00:24 UTC <BooBooRx> @Rochellelloyd57 Yes he was...I think they must have all had something wonderful to contribute...Ringo and Paul are the only ones left now. I wonder how they feel about US Gov. today.. ? 
948310732466196480 2018-01-02 21:51:12 UTC <BooBooRx> @Rochellelloyd57 Yes...he held such admiration from so many Americans...his words were those of protesters, I believe...very wonderful...
948309576000180226 2018-01-02 21:46:36 UTC <BooBooRx> @Rochellelloyd57 I shared this, Rochelle...glad that I noticed it!  thank you for sharing it..

948224012731191296 2018-01-02 16:06:36 UTC <BooBooRx> @Rochellelloyd57 I dont know, but I can tell you that I have most definitely learned that ANYthing is possible with our government. Nothing much surprises me anymore. 
948222451338633216 2018-01-02 16:00:24 UTC <BooBooRx> @Rochellelloyd57 I knowwww, Rochelle, right??  The Dems have been so timid!...almost comically so.  I feel like even Pel & Shu know that no matter what, as long as R's are in charge, theyre going to laugh and just bulldoze over us as often as they please. Daringly so!  WE NEED STRONG LEADERS. 
948221006673522689 2018-01-02 15:54:39 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B Awww...how cute is that?! ...Ever the brotherly protector! (Or maybe the brotherly wannabe scoffer?)   *They're GREAT fur kids, those Gow pups!

948195452993900544 2018-01-02 14:13:07 UTC <BooBooRx> @kurtresists Pre-cious! 
948195054383976449 2018-01-02 14:11:32 UTC <BooBooRx> @kurtresists I would LOVE to just quietly slip right in beside them and make a nuzzle sandwich. 
948190056086409217 2018-01-02 13:51:40 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Really?  It's a real "thing" ...Maybe just called that here in New England?

947994374541103104 2018-01-01 00:54:06 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B Me?  I'm but a mouse in this whole upheaval that will happen. I wish I had more time to make a difference...but once things get organized and moving, l'll do what I can to help.  I'm glad you're here,...more!. Its kind of exciting to know things will begin happening ..Jan.20th.
947989262779248642 2018-01-01 00:33:47 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B I was just kidding you..The Tudor Eng. is quaint & charming...and yes, I think we all agree that we're going to have to organize organize organize.  You know secrets dont you.   Any particular leader(s) in mind?

947943369904476160 2018-01-01 21:31:25 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Next time I put them on her.... Shes out like a light in front of the wood stove. I keep expecting her Grinch style fringe-y hair to catch fire  
947922216863322113 2018-01-01 20:07:22 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I hope so.. Whatever will he do without his gold throne?

947560857986322437 2017-12-31 20:11:28 UTC <BooBooRx> @kurtresists By gosh, I think this oh-so wise person has nailed it!  Day after day of being hoodwinked by Trump & GOP can make us ALL feel beaten down.Thats ok! Our strength will grow from each disappointment, and then WATCH OUT!  Kurt & Gia & all Resistors will slay them all!  2 dramatic?

The constant need for wheeling & dealing for more & more money. He has no skills; just BIG talk. Tremendous! He harrumphs along; The King.

945982495824207872 2017-12-27 11:39:37 UTC <BooBooRx> Good mornin Schmoopys!...Ahhh, it was lovely while it lasted, but time now to get back to my working family & the kiddos.  Im refreshed & feeling ready for whatever ails em!  I love their little faces...one by one.  Happy Wednesday, and please be safe out there.. Bye!  xo
945772645823414272 2017-12-26 21:45:45 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I mean... SOMEONE has to pay the price for TREASON and all the RICO and money laundering hoo-ha that has been apparently going on for quite a while..at least since the Miss America Moscow stuff went on.  A little positive good news would be lovely, wouldn't it?  
945771435645198337 2017-12-26 21:40:56 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Yep.  His instability is just so exhausting! ..TWO YEARS for the Nixon investigation, you say???  Oh Jeezalouisa... Okay... well.. maybe we all need to pace ourselves and just RESIST on a daily basis for as long as it takes. Not much else to do until theres a reason to protest.
945766355634094081 2017-12-26 21:20:45 UTC <BooBooRx> @barkflight Ohhhh...hahaaah... phew! I thought it was just me!?  He doesnt seem like the espionage thriller type.. go figure, right? 
945756271243915264 2017-12-26 20:40:41 UTC <BooBooRx> @SRuhle @larryleclair @DianaNYC3 Yet they still cheer him.  Oy.
945754185752039424 2017-12-26 20:32:23 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Yes it is!  Poor Abe was really listing to the left the whole time while talking to the floor... another ones voice & movement were not in sync..  ah well...everything else went off without a hitch..a monumental feat, Im sure.  : )
945752892908163072 2017-12-26 20:27:15 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 That, we will .. I need to work on my lack of patience and desire to begin seeing the judiciary digging in & preparing to rid us of these traitors.  Its difficult to wait, and I just hope it will be worth it. Somehow, I see him avoiding any jail time...I hope Im wrong...  : }
945747870203904001 2017-12-26 20:07:18 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 They always seem to malfunction when we're there...the voices sound like they're all stoned...lol!  
945747005967618048 2017-12-26 20:03:52 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Right! ... There's so much needing to change, incl absolutely no interference by Russia or any other country...and gerrymandering + voter fraud is disastrous for elections. The system is rigged...people will be forever suspicious...can't blame them. RUSSIA put Trump in the WH  
945744449879109632 2017-12-26 19:53:42 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I don't think there's anything THEY could suggest that would influence too many DEMS at this point...I already have some suspicions about the suggestion of bi-partisan work on infrastructure...Trojan Horse....
945743830950834176 2017-12-26 19:51:15 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 SO MANY kind, caring, creative, and brilliant fellow Resistors!.....who could resist their friendship?  #THERESISTANCE
945742929787850752 2017-12-26 19:47:40 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I can envision that! ..and it would be a huge draw for patrons, me thinks. 
945742497837350913 2017-12-26 19:45:57 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Agree....the EC needs to be abolished, and I suspect the body was offered some  hefty $$$$ persuasion.   : |

944571002280927233 2017-12-23 14:10:50 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I think my body and mind have numbed themselves with regard to Trump & the GOP... the SHOCK factor left a long time ago... now its just sitting & waiting for tomorrows news to top todays.

944266983633309696 2017-12-22 18:02:47 UTC <BooBooRx> @subsalr He bragged he would bring in $5B from overseas wranglings..that would more than finance their robbing of tax money they stole...and um..those SS + Mcare  are not entitlements..those are owned and paid for by workers their whole lives.. the VA needs refurbishing desperately.yes!!
944265089993052160 2017-12-22 17:55:15 UTC <BooBooRx> @barry_corindia @SonofRascus It is unusual...as unusual as the lone Af-Am who stood with Congress proudly after passing the tax scam..he looked so proud...it was disturbing, actually...hard not to yell at the TV,. "Why?!?!!!?"
944263661060796421 2017-12-22 17:49:35 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 You would nevvvver leave. A lot of my family is still there...lemon & olive groves...the aroma of that hillside is intoxicating..I always feel sad to return to US.. it is my place of solace...not the tourist areas..back roads..heaven! 
944261327031296002 2017-12-22 17:40:18 UTC <BooBooRx> @Acosta Thinking the others booked it out of town so they wouldn't be photographed with him signing it for posterity!  It's ALL on him, that way.
944258812860686338 2017-12-22 17:30:19 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I have not been to NZ either... Maybe that's the place to research and visit one day?? ...kind of a preliminary pre-lifestyle change visit? 
944255575017381888 2017-12-22 17:17:27 UTC <BooBooRx> @realDonaldTrump @WrathOfKhan2016 He pocketed your $800 and thumbs his nose as he relaxes at Maralago.  He always lies. He doesn't even realize it because words just fall out of his face...daily.

943983732226215939 2017-12-21 23:17:14 UTC <BooBooRx> I am reduced to tears, but HAPPY ones. Thanks, everyone,for putting up with my whining about the CHIPS program.. it was a heavy weight upon all of us involved in treating these kids.  Michaela, Anthony, Michael D, Michael J, Kaitlynn, & Aaron will have a good chance at life!
943981080364937216 2017-12-21 23:06:42 UTC <BooBooRx> Hello @amazinmikey .. thanks for the support!  
943980209635815424 2017-12-21 23:03:14 UTC <BooBooRx> @pglynn61 So am I, Peg!  Ive been carrying this possibly devastating heartache around for months... planning & scheming for alternate care.. its feel SO GOOD to have this portion of terrific news...Ill worry some more in the Spring...  thanks for commenting, schweetie!
943977350882095104 2017-12-21 22:51:53 UTC <BooBooRx> @NBCNews @CNN @seanhannity @LarryWilson @ijackmulcahy Thanks!
943977187979530240 2017-12-21 22:51:14 UTC <BooBooRx> @pglynn61 It is, Peg!!!... I can't even tell you, Love!   Phone call after phone call from teary parents..that's how I found out...I can now drop my shoulders (about 5 inches) from under my ears!  Talk about STRESSSS!  Phew!
943975282674950151 2017-12-21 22:43:40 UTC <BooBooRx> Thankfully!! ....just heard that the CHIPS program will be subsidized until Spring...After that, we will be scattering for help once again...  But, I'll take it!  My "kiddos" will be able to continue treatments.   Grazia Dio!
943970417588555776 2017-12-21 22:24:20 UTC <BooBooRx> @NBCNews @CNN @seanhannity @LarryWilson @ijackmulcahy I know!  Sorry...I just had to take advantage of it.  : ]
943961112579538946 2017-12-21 21:47:21 UTC <BooBooRx> @RVAwonk @Shareblue This guy is nuts.  Running his own investigation....gahhh.  ... We need a break from this every single day nonsense.
943958326056022018 2017-12-21 21:36:17 UTC <BooBooRx> @RBReich A  Marvelous look at the Mayhem that now makes sense!  Thanks for this...it's so great to have you on our team to easily explain this political malarkey that's going on!  (exhausted watching you!) 
943955475430871040 2017-12-21 21:24:57 UTC <BooBooRx> @waltshaub Pathetic.
943954212802703360 2017-12-21 21:19:56 UTC <BooBooRx> @NBCNews @CNN @seanhannity @LarryWilson No..Mr Hannity....you really ARE a "journalist jackass"...
943953808312422401 2017-12-21 21:18:20 UTC <BooBooRx> A-mennnnn!https://twitter.com/LarryWilson/status/943950847251279872
943953051416776704 2017-12-21 21:15:19 UTC <BooBooRx> @JG_NoPlanet_B I'm thinking that they're so blinded by their obscene $$ windfalls that if he suggests it they'll start hauling out the tanks and order goose-stepping marchers from Putin. . That would just about do it for most of us!
943951570974248960 2017-12-21 21:09:26 UTC <BooBooRx> @kurtresists Isn't it just  a-dor-a-ble?  I'm glad it may have given you a little smile.... 
943912291099140104 2017-12-21 18:33:21 UTC <BooBooRx> @DavidCayJ Quintessential Trump! ..scowling...tweeting....&  all dressed up in the illusion of sanity.   Wishing you Good Luck on your book sales! 
943906410085134336 2017-12-21 18:09:59 UTC <BooBooRx> @subsalr Hoping he'll continue to work, in some way, behind the scenes..I think it's where his heart is... More than that, I really don't like how DEMS seem to roll over so easily -this was a Roger Stone (R) stunt..DEMS fold & walk away too easily. Sen.Liz.Warren can't do it all. Fed up?
943903026158493702 2017-12-21 17:56:32 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Contacting our reps goes only so far...usually, it just makes us feel better..our way of 'doing something'...Protesting makes us 'real' on TV, in govt bldgs..but if we are in huge crowds & very loud, & they stand to lose something?  WIN!  JMHO
943852780183261187 2017-12-21 14:36:53 UTC <BooBooRx> No...please...a thousand times NO!https://twitter.com/jg_noplanet_b/status/943802412111945732

943845065050476544 2017-12-21 14:06:13 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 The how...yep...thats the question that keeps some of us awake at night.  Speaking of night...Trump has been nothing but a nightmare to so many peoples health & sense of welfare... HOW long will it take to recover is anyones guess. : /
943841568942903296 2017-12-21 13:52:20 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 I think we ALL should be....Right now, hes flying high on praise...I feel like when the adoration stops, thats when he reacts negatively... the first signs of disrespect about their tax plan, and he will become a 12 year old once again...and apt to retaliate unreasonably  : }
943839696769245185 2017-12-21 13:44:54 UTC <BooBooRx> @imscotte1 Exxxactly.  
943839413418721280 2017-12-21 13:43:46 UTC <BooBooRx> @nikkihaley Shes got Trumps lingo down pat...Doesnt understand its about contributing to the WORLD...not about, ...what are we gettin outta this??
943822604388978688 2017-12-21 12:36:58 UTC <BooBooRx> @realDonaldTrump @FBI @MrsDanaD Thanks!  Its still just incredible to me that theyre so brazen and in-your-face about it...they think theyre above any laws or ethics. !?!

943584747065921538 2017-12-20 20:51:49 UTC <BooBooRx> @RoZsaJH I agree....this has been a very long & tumultuous year for us who opose him...but we have to hang on just a little longer... No other choice, right? ...one day...
943578953914159105 2017-12-20 20:28:48 UTC <BooBooRx> @RoZsaJH Let them celebrate ... it wont be long lasting for Trump and many of his cronies...Im guessing that Mueller and company barely sleep... and one day...he will pay.

943453518123491328 2017-12-20 12:10:21 UTC <BooBooRx> @JaneGummyof3 True! Well bolster each other up and get this going...I can hardly wait for the next GOP shoe to drop. What other money-making scheme or denial of benefits are they dreaming up (besides health care)?????  After the holidays, watch out!!  Have a good day, Jane..TRY to sleep!
943447374353063938 2017-12-20 11:45:57 UTC <BooBooRx> @JaneGummyof3 Im TRYING to feel positive..maybe tomorrow... ?   The CHIPS issue is huge for all of us.. it will do such damage.
943089314270937088 2017-12-19 12:03:08 UTC <BooBooRx> @Protectanimal13 They just dont get it... every living soul deserves respect. As long as war doesnt doesnt affect them directly (bone spur excuse), theyre fine with sending young troops anywhere at all. War means big $$$ for them.  (Ask Dick Cheney from the Bush era). Feeding kids? Bor-ing 
942917512106250242 2017-12-18 00:40:28 UTC <BooBooRx> @foxnewspolitics @JayRodge66 We really DO need to reject them all... Keep that HOPE close by... 
942911843718352896 2017-12-18 00:17:56 UTC <BooBooRx> @foxnewspolitics @JayRodge66 Always a possibility...they will stop at nothing to advance Trump...
942910437758328832 2017-12-18 00:12:21 UTC <BooBooRx> @subsalr Yes he is.. I think what he did was dumb...but I also think she was not the type to exactly be devastated by it...she made money from it...and he was publicly humiliated...  I have HOPE that he may reconsider..but, he probably wont... A very big loss...sad.
