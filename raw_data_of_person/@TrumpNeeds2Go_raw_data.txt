957436850637037568 2018-01-27 02:15:08 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @TheAnnaBenson Ive missed the real essence of your post. Which crack whore are we discussing??
957436434293641216 2018-01-27 02:13:28 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @seanhannity Tick tock indeed. Ms TRump has moved out. Next week at this time Stormy or Missy or Brandi will probably move in. Its the tRump Secret Porn Society. And Mueller will be dropping the big hammer on the crooked tRump crew. And Hannity can watch more car wrecks. Tick Tock
957435486536196096 2018-01-27 02:09:42 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JBabsSportsChic Duke lost.

957099879330975745 2018-01-26 03:56:07 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @SethDavisHoops They need a thorough housecleaning.
957099736896557057 2018-01-26 03:55:33 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JBabsSportsChic It can't happen soon enough for me. Great coach but always crying or begging for something. And his teams lately have underachieved. His tourney record lately isn't as good as you'd think. And his comments were terrible.
957021955915501568 2018-01-26 22:46:29 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @intouchweekly @StormyDaniels @jimmykimmel @moot_musings @Robbin_Young Yes so true. Lets hope you at least make it to 101. After all over 100 years of good to decent health and Happiness sounds like a damn good deal!! And of course while you at least arent even halfway there the most we have of tRump is 7 more years. 
957018725496119297 2018-01-26 22:33:39 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @intouchweekly @StormyDaniels @jimmykimmel @moot_musings @Robbin_Young Do you actually want to live to be 103? 85 maybe IF there arent too many issues you naturally would be suffering from.
957017593101070338 2018-01-26 22:29:09 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @StormyDaniels @jimmykimmel @JudgeLex @Robbin_Young I voted for her. She was a TERRIBLE candidate. But for me CLEARLY the lesser of two evils.

957012797120024582 2018-01-26 22:10:05 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @StormyDaniels @jimmykimmel @JudgeLex @Robbin_Young Understandable but would U actually vote 4 him? Support him?  & Im definitely not a Trumper, the hypocrisy shown by conserv/Fox News who hated Obama probably because of his race is sickening. What will tRumps legacy be, it sure wont be a good 1 even if he doesnt get impeached

952673981349408768 2018-01-14 22:49:11 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ShannonSharpe And if true those hacked tweets were your best efforts here.
952671301667315719 2018-01-14 22:38:32 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @RealRonHoward Sadly the right is making us pay for having a GREAT man who happened to be a minority become President.
952669641985413120 2018-01-14 22:31:57 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @emilymayox_ U know.

952654740034375680 2018-01-14 21:32:44 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ReggieWayne_17 Really excited for the Patriots to destroy yet another feel good story

952654574367793152 2018-01-14 21:32:04 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @NautilusCarly Exactly!! Im so damn tired, no make that exhausted from all the DMs I get here. Well said

952653652094832641 2018-01-14 21:28:24 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Hub_Arkush Is Tomlin in any trouble??
952653398301724672 2018-01-14 21:27:24 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @buffalo_alice @r3t2 They could have onside kicked it a minute ago. They should have taken the field goal first. Terrible coaching decisions. You cant let The Jacksonville Jaguars put up 45 on your field.
952651968220160002 2018-01-14 21:21:43 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @buffalo_alice @r3t2 You kick off, the Jags run 3 times and punt from somewhere around their 30 and you get the bell around your own 40 with around one minute left. Who knows they might have a great punt return. The odds on a successful onside kick is less than 10%

952649987019755520 2018-01-14 21:13:50 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @DavidCornDC Lots of TRump peeps have that Jeff Sessions malady.
952649777317056513 2018-01-14 21:13:00 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Brasilmagic And that makeup artist is clearly not doing her job well.  Of course its impossible to make Huck look good.
952649482784641030 2018-01-14 21:11:50 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JasonLaCanfora HORRIBLE onside kick.
952647696640282627 2018-01-14 21:04:44 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @davereaboi When you have a friend like @SebGorka you have lots of problems

952638300635959299 2018-01-14 20:27:24 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JoyAnnReid @JesseBWatters has to be the most ignorant commentator on Fox News. @TuckerCarlson is a very close second.
952637714163208192 2018-01-14 20:25:04 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @CoolAuntClaire Hes NOT close
952636797544292352 2018-01-14 20:21:26 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @IanKenyonNFL He needs one more touchdown today to move on
952634152540569611 2018-01-14 20:10:55 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @TimODee16 Too bad during his ass kicking they didnt mess up his hair.
952633826001477645 2018-01-14 20:09:37 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @naughtywriter2 . Enjoy 
952630102352912384 2018-01-14 19:54:50 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @CoolAuntClaire If Fournette is close to what he was in 1st half the Jags should be ok. They had no answer for him.
952627977090752512 2018-01-14 19:46:23 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @naughtywriter2 Anything else work??
952601613415452672 2018-01-14 18:01:37 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @wingingitmotown They need to dump both Abby and Helm. They r making way too much money and are and have been mediocre for a long time.
952577144516988931 2018-01-14 16:24:23 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @joshgad How do you think the Fix/Fox/Fake News would have dealt with all these porn stars coming out with stories/payoffs if this would have happened during the Obama presidency??  The righteous GOP and their group should be totally ashamed
952576253067976705 2018-01-14 16:20:51 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @pittgriffin One of his neighbors need to revisit him and bust up a couple more of his ribs.

952567268977688576 2018-01-14 15:45:09 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @jbouie Cotton is a SOB. That performance hopefully ends whatever small chance he ever had to be President. @TomCottonAR = LyingSOB
952566448618135554 2018-01-14 15:41:53 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @matthewamiller And Lying Tom Cotton just said pretty much the same thing and said both Graham and Durbin werent telling the truth. @TomCottonAR   What a lying Fuckstick!!

952384669693202437 2018-01-13 03:39:34 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @umhoops @BFQuinn Thanks for the reply back. My post didnt deserve it. Good luck with the site. Since the newspaper for news (my generation) has sadly all but disappeared I hope your site success. Go Blue.

952288165917855744 2018-01-13 21:16:06 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @SilverAdie That crooked SOB can see the handwriting on the wall. Like a rat that he is - he is jumping off the sinking tRump ship before it completely hits the bottom.  PS: Gowdy, use this time to get a grownups haircut you fucking sleaze ball
952281446386995202 2018-01-13 20:49:24 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik I had thought you were a fan of Holland. Not so much anymore?
952281189980758017 2018-01-13 20:48:22 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik The handful of good young players on team (Larkin, Mantha, Athanasiou) will all be restricted free agents after this season. All will certainly be re-signed & get raises. But its the long-term deals to players in the late 20s and 30s that are going to be killer.
952279831953240064 2018-01-13 20:42:59 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik Those big contracts, arent most of them not very good contracts? Abby? Erickson? Why have so many big contracts for 3rd/4th liners or D men that arent even top 4 D men on good teams. Whats the odds that Holland is a goner after this year especially if they really bottom out
952277984500690944 2018-01-13 20:35:38 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik Ive had this discussion with you before. Now is the time to regroup. They really only have 3-4 at best good young players, keep them and obviously Z and do whatever you can to get rid of the rest. Build thru the draft the next 2-4 years.
952277032360136704 2018-01-13 20:31:51 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik George, the only thing that should matter is the Wings down 4-1. Another loss and another loss that gets them closer to the bottom and not in the playoffs. This team needs to be broken up immediately.  They arent even mediocre.
952275694570168320 2018-01-13 20:26:32 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @WestWingReport It interrupted his golf game. I bet he was pissed

952206909968351233 2018-01-13 15:53:13 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @CoolAuntClaire Is the Stormy Daniels autobiography on a different table??? I bet the photos in it are better than the story. 
952042423672279041 2018-01-12 04:59:36 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @azsweetheart013 And besides Stormy the Orange SOB wanted yet another porn star to join them for a 3 some.

He seems to like to use his $$$/power to attract/use attractive women. He did say he could grab them by the pussy.

793658551080218624 2016-11-01 03:38:38 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @djdurkin he does seem a bit cranky tonight
793657101189079041 2016-11-01 03:32:53 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> he should be good for 20-30 tomorrow
793656118283235328 2016-11-01 03:28:58 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Buck he threw 20 pitches. He should be good for 20-30 tomorrow night.
793654870595276800 2016-11-01 03:24:01 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @samsteinhp not when we get 2-3 in the first inning again

793281966388965377 2016-10-31 02:42:13 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JasonLaCanfora love you on the TK podcast. That entire division of Vikes, Pack and Lions won't win much in playoffs. None r good
793280115094458369 2016-10-31 02:34:52 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @BruceCCarlson Francona is too good of a manager to let that happen
793279840136855552 2016-10-31 02:33:46 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @DonBanks you know it's a terrible game when Jay Cutler is the best thing in the game.

793278938441187328 2016-10-31 02:30:11 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @MichelleDBeadle what kind were you handing out?? Hopefully not those crappy Tootsie Rolls or worse yet, raisins.
793278583032651777 2016-10-31 02:28:47 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @EdWerderespn he knows he is playing for a new contract (hopefully not Chicago) next year.

792888590221139973 2016-10-30 00:39:05 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @chrislhayes so has swinging at pitched clearly out of the strike zone.
792888287493054465 2016-10-30 00:37:53 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Nice start Cubs
792886267939782656 2016-10-30 00:29:52 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Same Cubs hitters.  Take those walks.

792844918247030784 2016-10-30 21:45:33 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @cubs_insider I seriously doubt Cleveland will be too scared. They've seen our hitters look foolish most of the time. PS: I'm a Cubs fan

792842959058337793 2016-10-30 21:37:46 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ChetCoppock refs, inconsistent calls, head,neck&knee injuries, mediocre or dreadful teams with just 1-2 good teams,terrible leadership=NFL
792842193547460613 2016-10-30 21:34:43 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JimmieJohnson @NBCSports boring red neck stuff.
792840614773686273 2016-10-30 21:28:27 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @670TheScore yup. So they can lose 1-0 or 2-0.
792840501410004993 2016-10-30 21:28:00 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @NFLMocks stretchered out
792840400599969792 2016-10-30 21:27:36 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @WhitlockJason @Yatrix7 the vast majority of NFL games are referees or head, neck or knee injuries. It's not a good product right now
792839481678323716 2016-10-30 21:23:57 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JesseSanchezMLB @TheBlogfines hot pitching, but how about knowing strike zone and taking advantage of scoring situations when u have them!
792839097236750336 2016-10-30 21:22:25 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @bearsbuzztap what to watch??? We r going to watch Jay throw at least 2 INTs and the Bears to lose by at least 3 TDs
792836305860395008 2016-10-30 21:11:20 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @richarddeitsch Hamilton and Hughes are 2 of the best.

792835533324115968 2016-10-30 21:08:15 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @barrysvrluga Cubs fans to Joe Maddox: how about instructing the players to swing at strikes, move runners into scoring position
792835138229067776 2016-10-30 21:06:41 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @670TheScore brilliant Joe. Just fuckin' brilliant! No wonder you are considered the best.

792205294772350976 2016-10-28 03:23:55 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @AGuyNamedJoey only chance of that is if he lets the ball hit him
792204471329812480 2016-10-28 03:20:39 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> These Cubs just aren't ready to win
792204300428648448 2016-10-28 03:19:58 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @chifanpatt1 that first pitch could have ended up in the bleachers.
792199953577865216 2016-10-28 03:02:41 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Please during these next 6 outs can the Cubs get at least 2 runs.  PLEASE

789321628996014080 2016-10-20 04:25:15 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @BearsBacker not drinking that Bears koolade. They have no stars and had bad drafts. They are a 2-3 at best win team
789320157445447680 2016-10-20 04:19:25 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ChicagoBears who cares??
789319876938698752 2016-10-20 04:18:18 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Eric_Edholm the NFL game has been over for 45 minutes
789316853613092865 2016-10-20 04:06:17 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @karlravechespn @Kendreth_Roude will this game actually end before that??
789314717181444096 2016-10-20 03:57:47 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @kfishbain give both of them the rest of this year off. They aren't making any difference, the team sucks with or without them
789314415808110593 2016-10-20 03:56:36 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @GrahamWIIM aka the rally killer
789314308698214400 2016-10-20 03:56:10 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Schumouse Larry King must have run out of Depends - he left after the 5th inning.
789314049641250817 2016-10-20 03:55:08 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ChiTribSkrbina @crawlyscubs Larry King must have run out of adult Depends because he left 3 innings ago
789313873333608449 2016-10-20 03:54:26 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @mccoveychron I can only hope the length of this games results in Joe F Buck losing his voice FOREVER
789313016387014656 2016-10-20 03:51:02 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @BYBKurt @Lynn_Henning it would help if these umps would make the correct call every once in awhile
789312608755126272 2016-10-20 03:49:25 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @cubsfanscentral the umps are missing 2-3 calls every inning
789312336637128704 2016-10-20 03:48:20 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @cubs_insider @TMC1515 looks like these umps are trying to keep this game under 4 hours
789311899435401216 2016-10-20 03:46:36 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @AGuyNamedJoey @GundrumKen how about Joe Buck just stop talking! He hates all that is Chicago
789311468760162304 2016-10-20 03:44:53 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @djdurkin @andywhalen and so far it has sucked too
789311173221027841 2016-10-20 03:43:43 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> These umpires are AWFUL
789310738607271940 2016-10-20 03:41:59 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @LarryLambert6 it's been a long time coming
789310587780161540 2016-10-20 03:41:23 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @karlravechespn looks like Larry King either is having taking his time in the men's room changing his diaper issues or headed for home
789288752980123648 2016-10-20 02:14:37 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @oliverdarcy both those clowns are clueless
789270514141392896 2016-10-20 01:02:09 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Mark_Schlabach @TomFornelli it's all mental
789071199884148736 2016-10-20 11:50:08 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Johnathan_Wood1 that sounds about right. Maybe with no running game the Bears can hold them to under 30 but still end up losing by 3 TDs
788842352181911552 2016-10-19 20:40:47 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @NewCenturyTimes @SpeakerRyan @Blob_Fish Make It Happen Orange Man!! KEEP TALKING

781911736895082496 2016-09-30 17:40:59 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @dopeislandvines @MotivateAthlete @vine bullshit post! I'm done
781904853148762112 2016-09-30 17:13:38 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @all22 @injuryexpert not necessarily this week. They are playing the terrible Bears
781904557307752448 2016-09-30 17:12:28 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @jeeblufc @Graeme_McDowell hope Westy takes advantage of not playing until Sunday to work on all his game. Casey should have been chosen.
781897731753201664 2016-09-30 16:45:20 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @practicalgolf I hope his next match is Sunday singles against Westwood. He could win that one
781897251773878272 2016-09-30 16:43:26 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @SiriusXMNHL pretty much 75% of the Red Wings roster??
781896923355635712 2016-09-30 16:42:08 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @RichLernerGC Lee Westwood hasn't been good
781896474879754241 2016-09-30 16:40:21 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JustinDacey just do some fist pumping while eating your mac & cheese! #Leftycantdrivestraight
781896129571086336 2016-09-30 16:38:58 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @GolfDigest and Lefty misses ANOTHER fairway. Sit his ass!
781895257650786304 2016-09-30 16:35:30 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @TheCelticManor @RyderCupEurope @MCShippa @Graeme_McDowell @ChrisHutchinso7 or worse than AWFUL.
781895075479621632 2016-09-30 16:34:47 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @TheCelticManor @RyderCupEurope @MCShippa @Graeme_McDowell @ChrisHutchinso7 Westy was awful.
781881972733964289 2016-09-30 15:42:43 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @RyderCupUSA @sirnickfaldo doesn't Lefty now own the record for most out-of-bounds and drives missing the fairway??
781881280585695232 2016-09-30 15:39:58 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @1307th @Samnsara1997 very true
781881153863225344 2016-09-30 15:39:28 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @mshamburger1 anyone seen Tiger??? Hopefully he is on the course and not entertaining the European wives.
781880285118009344 2016-09-30 15:36:01 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @TheCelticManor @RyderCupEurope @MCShippa @Graeme_McDowell you should be there instead of Westwood. His game has left him
781879730077327360 2016-09-30 15:33:48 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @NateSilver538 @Dem4Hillary I'm praying that Nate is once again right
781459027603619840 2016-09-29 11:42:05 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JoeNBC The Andy Griffith show never made the list. And MASH was way down. #phonylist
781296719682211840 2016-09-28 00:57:08 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @OddreyM gutter mouth
781294109243899905 2016-09-28 00:46:46 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @kellypranghofer @StuPolitics By the way, in case you didn't notice Nellie (with his cheek sticking out with a chew in it) was my favorite
781292763514073088 2016-09-28 00:41:25 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @StuPolitics @kellypranghofer and Nellie and Luis formed one of the greatest SS/2B combos. Both HOFers for those Go-Go Sox.
781291256072794112 2016-09-28 00:35:25 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @KellyannePolls @megynkelly new strategy?? Duct tape over the Orange Clown's mouth. Probably work better

773924380787240960 2016-09-08 16:42:05 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Green_Footballs @HiJCP so very true. Those crazies won't change their minds no matter what he says/does.

771385188794376193 2016-09-01 16:32:15 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik yes but probably with a very limited knee, last year he seemed a step behind & wasn't he healthy? They need a 100% Z, not less
771383521508204544 2016-09-01 16:25:37 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik the Wings sadly are really gonna be bad this year. An injured best player on a team with very very little talent

763178743640780800 2016-08-09 01:02:46 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @futieton you SHOULD feel honored! He is a true Ass Clown
763067316401758208 2016-08-09 17:39:59 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> you can check the off the auto draft list.
763067169307561984 2016-08-09 17:39:24 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> all players on auto draft list are NOT INJURED or suspended for games or if you have a player or two you don't like u can check
763066875412672513 2016-08-09 17:38:14 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> if you don't REALLY have much of an idea about football yes. But just make sure if you auto draft to make sure all players...
763066470192541696 2016-08-09 17:36:38 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> I'm imaging LOTS of things. Thanks.
763066139488509953 2016-08-09 17:35:19 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> I'm guessing more than tackle.  The top WRs and then RBs are my first priority. Then QB.  FF is fun, hope u r successful.
763065679964672000 2016-08-09 17:33:29 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> thanks.
763065551279259648 2016-08-09 17:32:59 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> how many in your league and where u draft. I usually wait on QBs til 2nd round unless u fall into one of the top 3.
763065238019276800 2016-08-09 17:31:44 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> so many ways 2 go. Gurley, RB, Brown WR, Rodgers or Newton QB. Can't really go wrong with any of them. Also depends on how many
763064500908163072 2016-08-09 17:28:48 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> I gonna have to go back. All I found was the candle scene and the beach scene.  #funresearch

762110162446454785 2016-08-06 02:16:36 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @BaxFootballGuru I'm not trolling.  He was convicted of a felon. He was suspended by NFL. And he had paid off a sexual assault charge.
762109636141088768 2016-08-06 02:14:31 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @AaronLemingNFL we have a difference of opinion on Mr Dungy. And probably on those "good" Christians.  Have a wonderful evening

755557949267906560 2016-07-19 00:20:27 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @GovChristie @richarddeitsch is "bunk" another word for shit?
755557156146012160 2016-07-19 00:17:18 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @emerald_gem858 A birther who uses racism, religious intolerance, anxiety, anger/fear just became the GOP nominee. He can NEVER become Pres!
755556868785831936 2016-07-19 00:16:09 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @CEmma670 they have a surplus of good fielding outfielders. Somebody has to be traded for much needed pitching.
755555957804044288 2016-07-19 00:12:32 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @CEmma670 I love Schwarber but he is mediocre at best in the outfield and not even that as catcher. Where is he going to play?
755555170201796608 2016-07-19 00:09:24 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @emerald_gem858 Personally, I thank Trump 4 running 4 President. His yard signs have been a real help in identifying who's mentally unstable
755547126843772932 2016-07-19 23:37:27 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> today's Republican who actually is voting for Donald Trump is a bigger embarrassment.

755465559962181633 2016-07-19 18:13:20 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JimMWeber @1350amAkron @TheHerd Wow, is Cowherd actually still alive???
755453738475814912 2016-07-19 17:26:21 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> and NY TIMES just now says Top Stories: Hillary Clinton has a 76% chance of winning the presidency, our election forecast finds.
755453152254652416 2016-07-19 17:24:01 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> I agree. It should really be easy for her but there will always be 35-40% of the "crazies" who  follow lunatics like Trump
755452286034477056 2016-07-19 17:20:35 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @DrJillStein well, let's see what happens in a couple weeks. I admire your intelligence but I don't see Hillary going anywhere
755449813831933952 2016-07-19 17:10:45 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> I understand that. It would be greAt but isn't that unrealistic? My big objection is she takes votes away from HC not Trump
755448489882988544 2016-07-19 17:05:30 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> pt 3. Any votes Dr Stein gets will be from disgruntled Hillary/wanted Bernie voters which just helps the cancer that is Trump
755448178770579456 2016-07-19 17:04:16 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> pt 2 if she is on all 50 states does she REALLYhave a chance to get much more than 10% of vote. Plus....
755447896212987904 2016-07-19 17:03:08 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> I get Hillary is just slightly better than Trump BUT is Stein on all 50 ballots? And .....
755440864571383808 2016-07-19 16:35:12 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> .@DrJillStein will NOT be on all state ballots & will NOT win.  She's basically helping Donald Trump!  Liz: is this true?

753633969132929024 2016-07-14 16:55:14 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Lis_Smith @FanSince09 @GovPenceIN Sounds like he is the "perfect" choice for Trump. A real Christian
753633723183206400 2016-07-14 16:54:16 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @realDonaldTrump @GovChristie I'm betting Chris doesn't let the disappointment wreck his appetite today or in the future.
753630305135763456 2016-07-14 16:40:41 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @lib_crusher Pence didn't even endorse him in Indiana. He favored Cruz.
753586965455470592 2016-07-14 13:48:28 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> FoxNews on mute 4 me. Short haired blondes r nice 2 look at like M Kelly AND especially politically smart, poet Liz/Pov1 
753321049052282880 2016-07-13 20:11:48 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @SarahPalinUSA I totally agree with u that Palin crazy BUT she isn't 2 bad on the eyes as long as she stays quiet

753290399695777794 2016-07-13 18:10:01 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @TheGolfBallGuy I'm playing Bridgestone e6 - any balls you recommend that are similar. I have highball flight w/bit of slice.

752972628273553408 2016-07-12 21:07:18 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @DrJillStein (pt2) but SADLY does she really stand much of a chance 2 get more than 10% of  vote? 2 bad cause WE really change
752971966655725569 2016-07-12 21:04:41 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @DrJillStein I've never voted for any1 in a "third party", but I just checked out DrJS and what she stands 4 looks very good
752959747725389825 2016-07-12 20:16:07 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> so who will you be voting for? If I can ask. I know it's not DT. The far lesser of two evils - HC??

742909671107899392 2016-06-14 02:40:42 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @juliearmendare1 Personally, I thank Trump 4 running 4 President. His yard signs have been real help in identifying who's mentally unstable

742817267491147776 2016-06-14 20:33:32 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @AriMelber that's normal for Trump. Blowhard, likes to talk, put fear in people but absolutely no plan.

742815887816851456 2016-06-14 20:28:03 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @washingtonpost @catfanfl Trump loves to play that "fear" card. It's pretty much the only card in his hand.

742157699983527936 2016-06-12 00:52:38 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @will_senn get some education, your stupidity is alarming, or just common for Trump fans.
742157453010292736 2016-06-12 00:51:40 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @will_senn Paul Ryan. Endorse him but NEVER EVER campaign for him. And with each Trump comment he gets further and further away from him
742157179164237824 2016-06-12 00:50:34 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @haley_kathywom Didn't Trump claim Meatloaf or was it Gary Busey was one of the wisest, smartest men he'd ever met?

729143390638641154 2016-05-07 02:58:25 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen has there been another coach in this era to go 1 for 8 in deciding games and never won a Cup?
729143122387701760 2016-05-07 02:57:21 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen very close to top 10. Not top 5.
729142650771804161 2016-05-07 02:55:29 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen 8 chances with 1 win is a bit more than a small sample size for me. And that's where I'm ending this. Good night. Go Wild
729142109337423874 2016-05-07 02:53:20 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen above Ruff, Torts, Bylsma, NYR coach?
729140824215306241 2016-05-07 02:48:13 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen so what's your reason why he hasn't yet won a Cup or has such a poor game 7 record? It can't be because his team good?
729140370861363200 2016-05-07 02:46:25 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen Q, Babs, Hitch, Sutter and then Bruce?? Is that how you rate them?
729138541322772480 2016-05-07 02:39:09 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen once again then why has he been fired as much as he has been? Teams don't fire GREAT coaches that many times
729138251919937537 2016-05-07 02:38:00 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen this description to me means a very good coach. Not a GREAT coach. 10-15 rated. Not top 5. Closer to 10 than 15
729137856032182276 2016-05-07 02:36:26 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen why has he been fired so many times?? Answer: he didn't finish the job. Couldn't win the big one. Not just once or twice.
729137498849431552 2016-05-07 02:35:01 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen And in those 8 chances wasn't Boudreau's team the higher seed?
729136918194212864 2016-05-07 02:32:42 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen insane in your words. Bruce has reputation on not winning "the Big 1". & he has had lots of opportunities more than anyone
729136313220403200 2016-05-07 02:30:18 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen how many game 7s has Bruce won in his great career? How many has he lost? It's about the Cup not regular season wins
729135784155033600 2016-05-07 02:28:12 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen And thanks for the "insane" comment.
729135403811405825 2016-05-07 02:26:41 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen and now you have to get personal with the insane remark! You are better than that!!
729134989338656768 2016-05-07 02:25:02 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen I'm done. U don't see my points, I don't agree with you. Hope Bruce proves me wrong & wins it all in Minny or his next stop
729134343591989248 2016-05-07 02:22:28 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen you are missing the point which is he has had ample opportunity with really good teams to win Cups. He hasn't.
729133891186008065 2016-05-07 02:20:40 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen @frank_seravalli how many Cups did he win? How many game 7s did he win? How many did he lose?
729133606635966470 2016-05-07 02:19:33 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen U actually like Bruce's chances 2 win Cup in Minny? I sure don't. He has made very nice living being a good/not great coach
729133064589332480 2016-05-07 02:17:23 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen this was a pitiful response. Boudreau if he did have 2 HOFers on D STILL would have found a way to lose. It's what he does
729132689215860737 2016-05-07 02:15:54 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen he had Ovie one of the great goal scorers in NHL history and did he get to NHL finals?
729130696275562498 2016-05-07 02:07:59 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen @frank_seravalli BB wins lots of reg season games. Look at his playoff record next 2 another Ana coach R Carlisle. Notasgood
729129524097646592 2016-05-07 02:03:19 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen @frank_seravalli Anaheim has been in the playoffs seemingly every year and the Caps were good once they got Ovi.
729127812599324672 2016-05-07 01:56:31 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen @frank_seravalli obviously U aren't gonna agree with me. & again I hope he wins the big 1 but it won't ever be with the Wild
729126210463256580 2016-05-07 01:50:09 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen @frank_seravalli the best coaches do the most with less talent. Bruce hasn't been that lucky. Or good.
729125605221011456 2016-05-07 01:47:45 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen @frank_seravalli Coach Q lose as many game 7s as Bruce has? And his teams were usually higher seeds.
729115723231023104 2016-05-07 01:08:29 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen @frank_seravalli and I like Boudreau. I root for him. But he always seems to come up short in the crucial games
729115353440243712 2016-05-07 01:07:01 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen @frank_seravalli you think Bruce is one of the top 10 coaches currently in NHL? I don't. Somewhere around 15-20
729112693437833216 2016-05-07 00:56:27 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tsnscottcullen @frank_seravalli how many game 7s has he ever won?? I know he has lost lots more with some very good teams.
729112266482843648 2016-05-07 00:54:45 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @TheNHLQueen94 why would anyone block you?? You seem to be a very positive and nice person.

727810458770677760 2016-05-04 10:41:50 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @mitchellvii Graham, Romney, Bush, McCain, Ryan, Mitch, none of these will campaign for your guy.  And I'm sure there r more than these
727808956933001217 2016-05-04 10:35:52 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @mitchellvii u aren't as smart as u think u are if u think the majority of Repub leaders will work/get behind Trump. Tolerate yes, work 4 no

727302965569150977 2016-05-02 01:05:14 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @BrittMcHenry technically it wasn't late by NHL standards. One game suspension probably
727302194744184834 2016-05-02 01:02:10 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @PBerce at the most 1
727301940250578945 2016-05-02 01:01:09 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @thecubreporter Lol.  They can't go on a long enough losing streak for me.
727280128842207232 2016-05-02 23:34:29 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @NotKrisBryant23 nope. He looked awful. Couldn't have hit that ball with a 14 foot bat.

723315267930099716 2016-04-21 00:59:33 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Lynn_Henning what makes you think they will find a closer? They've need one seemingly forever. It's cost them a championship or 2
723314535294222336 2016-04-21 00:56:38 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @THNMattLarkin by the way, I'm honored u took time to write back and I was probably too harsh in my initial post. Have a good night

723312908097208320 2016-04-21 00:50:10 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @KyleWIIM coach says he is a liability. As if 4 of our 6 defenders aren't?? Joke
723312256046534656 2016-04-21 00:47:34 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @THNMattLarkin they've done nothing THIS YEAR in these playoffs.  That's my point.  They both r great just no so much IN THESE PLAYOFFS
723311500308451328 2016-04-21 00:44:34 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @THNMattLarkin no they are good. My stance is they've done nothing in the playoffs. You said they have
723300665909493760 2016-04-21 00:01:31 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tascherbakova87 no shit Sherlock!! That story is 7 hours old.
723300196436840450 2016-04-21 23:59:39 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @TheHockeyNews @THNMattLarkin how have the done this series?? Answer: not worth a damn. So, yet another stupidly written story from you
723298958467014656 2016-04-21 23:54:44 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @jessespector who in the hell was that??? He was awful
723298730728939520 2016-04-21 23:53:50 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @KyleWIIM plus what difference does it make when Det gets the calls. They can't do anything other than pass.
723297922054537216 2016-04-21 23:50:37 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Wings fans, nothing has changed. The Wings can't score enough to win. They haven't all year. Plus our goalie sooner or later lets in a bad 1
723297043360440326 2016-04-21 23:47:08 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik it would actually be good to see if they would have taken advantage of that 5-3. Playing better means winning
723296577629073408 2016-04-21 23:45:16 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @GrahamWIIM yup. And 3 probably gets them an OT loss.
723296368278798336 2016-04-21 23:44:27 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Yes Mickey, Wings have started well & are playing better BUT they still haven't scored especially on that 5-3. They aren't as good as Tampa
723295627585683456 2016-04-21 23:41:30 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @SIR__BOO I agree, put the puck on net. And keep doing it. They keep expecting that perfect goal and it's not happening
723295332319289344 2016-04-21 23:40:20 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @TheWingerDaily it's their best move so far. It's what they do best
723295189540962305 2016-04-21 23:39:46 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @fakemikegreen25 I don't thinks it's going to OT tonight.
723295023337508867 2016-04-21 23:39:06 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @LukeStuckmeyer @CSNChicago @cameramanric Kaner probably has some 19-20 year old intoxicated girl on her mind. Score Kaner!!!
723294672739774464 2016-04-21 23:37:42 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Johnubacon Tampa Bay even with their star out is easily the better team in these series. It's not even close.
723293424196182016 2016-04-21 23:32:45 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @boysandcandy I hate the Wings power play.
723293075376902144 2016-04-21 23:31:21 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ThreeGuySports @CubbyCity1 lets get him to 100. GoCubs
723292817045499905 2016-04-21 23:30:20 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @fakemikegreen25 what a joke.  He shouldn't be playing tonight.
723292589928120322 2016-04-21 23:29:26 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> That's an awful call but those things happen. Generally even out. But no excuse for the awful power plays Wings have had most of the year
723291971863875584 2016-04-21 23:26:58 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @SIR__BOO Tampa needn't worry about taking penalties. The Wings seem to think nice passing equals putting the puck in the net. #sad

722850327867834368 2016-04-20 18:12:02 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JustinDacey they must really see something in Goff & Wentz.  They now HAVE to get rid of their mediocre QBs.
722848710623895552 2016-04-20 18:05:37 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JustinDacey they must love both Goff and Wentz. Problem is they already have $40+ million in payroll for their 2 current QBs who r average
722848058141253632 2016-04-20 18:03:01 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JustinDacey they are both thinking quarterback. If either team gets a franchise/difference maker it's not a bad deal.

721847021880127490 2016-04-17 23:45:15 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @HbWINGer27 garbage. What the hell is Z doing? Just passing and when he does get the puck he has no angle to shoot

721158370976247812 2016-04-15 02:08:48 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JSportsnet very very little action from the Wings. They have a putrid offense. Capt Z has been a no show

721156357341229057 2016-04-15 02:00:48 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @HeleneStJames ugly all round game by these Wings. Best player is the kid.
721156194816147460 2016-04-15 02:00:09 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @NickMinock @wwmtnews he is a goddamn liar.
721156037315805185 2016-04-15 01:59:32 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Stareagle best thing the Wings can do is start making golf tee times for next weekend.  They are done in 2 more.
721155713796554754 2016-04-15 01:58:15 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Consistent calls from the refs didn't beat The Wings. The Wings are not the better team in this series no matter who refs
721155365270855680 2016-04-15 01:56:52 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @fangsbites The Wings have 1 player that will drop the gloves. They aren't built to fight. And lately to score goals or stop the puck
721155037968343040 2016-04-15 01:55:34 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @rriskyyy @TheNHLQueen94 he still prefers Franzen over Hossa.
721154705439789057 2016-04-15 01:54:14 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> This series goes 2 more games. Datsyuk & The Wings very sadly will be done.

721150215470899201 2016-04-15 01:36:24 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @patcaputo98 @MichiganNation2 the Wings have no offense other than the rookie Larkin. Where is Z, Tatar, Goose. No offense
721149653727735808 2016-04-15 01:34:10 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ZigFracassi yup 2 games and 6 minutes. He will come back in a couple years to have his number retired at the new building.
721138127000182785 2016-04-15 00:48:22 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik Tampa can continue to have its way and knock the crap out of Detroit. The power play is so bad they aren't concerned.
721137429642665984 2016-04-15 00:45:35 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @RedWingDiehards where is the offensive?? No snipers?? Our best player is the kid. The Wings are no threat on offense
721136340151242753 2016-04-15 00:41:16 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Detroits power play is a joke.  Daniels and Redmond crying about the refs?? Hell, Tampa had best chance shorthanded.

720424882333290497 2016-04-13 01:34:11 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @detroithockey96 where are our two best players??? They've done very very little.
720424338877476864 2016-04-13 01:32:01 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Wings want to make that perfect pass. Tampa Bay puts the puck on net and it goes in. Wings, please shoot the damn puck on the net
720423143018369024 2016-04-13 01:27:16 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @FriedgeHNIC Bingo
720422967545610240 2016-04-13 01:26:34 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @SIR__BOO bishop makes that save. Howard doesn't. Biggest reason Wings won't win this series
720422499629035520 2016-04-13 01:24:43 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Bishop saves that one. Howard doesn't. This is the biggest difference and why Wings won't win this series
720421657517666304 2016-04-13 01:21:22 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Jimmy is about ready to give up a softie.
720421404089401344 2016-04-13 01:20:22 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ctsbulls nobody cares Chuck. NOBODY
720419191350804481 2016-04-13 01:11:34 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Red_Wings_Vines @fakemikegreen25 or change his diaper
720418708263346176 2016-04-13 01:09:39 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @fakemikegreen25 1 more goal than Tampa Bay gets. That's what I'm hoping for
720411858159681536 2016-04-13 00:42:26 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Bill_Michaels @NFL how will Coach Mike screw it up this year??? Confident he will find a way. He always does
720407927362871296 2016-04-13 00:26:49 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @MSNBC @BernieSanders I smell reefer
720405454208151552 2016-04-13 00:16:59 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik they've settled in.
720399366918377472 2016-04-13 23:52:48 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik good. I'm now really looking forward to the 2nd period
720397778023804929 2016-04-13 23:46:29 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @AdamHoge shouldn't they be a bit more concerned about winning game(s)??
720397007651749888 2016-04-13 23:43:25 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @AaronNagler @KatyTurNBC maybe Joe Pa will bring it back.
720396845667786752 2016-04-13 23:42:46 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @SIR__BOO this is your typical Red Wing game so far. Come out flat, no urgency and of course fall behind.
720396129515532288 2016-04-13 23:39:56 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik typical Wing game. Fall behind, no urgency. George do they know this is a playoff game?
720395557064306688 2016-04-13 23:37:39 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @SIR__BOO more importantly they need to stop giving up dreadful goals and score more than 3.
720394451764514816 2016-04-13 23:33:16 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @DETGoBlue how about those Lions!!!
720394048029265921 2016-04-13 23:31:39 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik and are down 1-0.  They can't fall down 2-0.

720361831810752512 2016-04-13 21:23:39 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @rianwatt @dgoold another tuff break for the Redbirds. Hope they will continue.
720361288103305218 2016-04-13 21:21:29 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @CourtneyCummz @realDonaldTrump @BlushExotic Goddess: did you hear he has smallish hands. That mean anything 2 u??

719875081099440129 2016-04-12 13:09:28 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Morning_Joe Mr Bono: if it's Trump he will let it burn.

719708347579109378 2016-04-11 02:06:56 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @docdvr @howardfineman @HipMrBully do they play these classics in their live shows?? Bruce does play his.
719708110407999489 2016-04-11 02:05:59 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @howardfineman @Steigerworld how about Justin Bieber??
719705996889821184 2016-04-11 01:57:35 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ctsbulls chuck, I love ya but nobody cares about these Bulls   They are done.
719705602826641408 2016-04-11 01:56:01 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @docdvr @howardfineman @HipMrBully sympathy for sure, maybe Gimme Shelter, the others weren't hits, played on radio. Bruce has 20+ at least
719704575582842880 2016-04-11 01:51:56 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Just way way too much Faldo.
719703624650199040 2016-04-11 01:48:10 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Bjornapoor @howardfineman @HipMrBully I agree about Fogerty. Very underrated. Jackson Browne had some great lyrics in his music
719703335109029889 2016-04-11 01:47:01 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Toviya @howardfineman @HipMrBully never was a Dead fan - I thought all their songs sound the same.

719701764547690496 2016-04-11 01:40:46 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @howardfineman @HipMrBully u neglected to mention Springsteen. Name more than 1 meaningful Stones song! Bruce has dozens - ie, Oscar winner
719689965093941248 2016-04-11 00:53:53 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ChetCoppock Jack Brickhouse will always be #1 for me but the Carey/Stone duo as was the Carey/Piersall duo was REALLY entertaining

719679640097447940 2016-04-11 00:12:51 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ESPNChiCubs quit complaining. It could be 36 with a rain/snow mix. #GoCubsGo

719676367210725377 2016-04-11 23:59:51 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ChetCoppock I agree you can't duplicate Jack, Harry or Vince & Lou but Kasper & Hughes aren't bad.
719675170219143168 2016-04-11 23:55:06 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @kindofawriter @NHL he will get his #13 hung on the rafters of the new place for sure

719641750525059072 2016-04-11 21:42:18 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @mitchellvii I'm not a Cruz supporter. He was evil when he was born.
719634634108243968 2016-04-11 21:14:01 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @mitchellvii LOL
719589425320222720 2016-04-11 18:14:22 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @GolfDigest I'm tired of Feherty's act. It's always all about him.
719589026827792384 2016-04-11 18:12:47 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ZigFracassi I think Yaz was better than Big P.  That being said I'm not a Sox fan, you must be. But Ted W for sure gets a spot.
719587283867930624 2016-04-11 18:05:52 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ZigFracassi How about Ted Williams, especially if you think Big Popi deserves a spot.
719577494534361093 2016-04-11 17:26:58 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @WalterReports @ChadLivengood @detroitnews Impeach The Nerd!

719539345154289664 2016-04-11 14:55:22 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Rodney_Harrison you Sir are a true Hall of Famer both on the field and in your back yard!
719517352296071168 2016-04-11 13:27:59 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @mitchellvii @tedcruz my guess is Evil Ted doesn't even know who you are. And if he does, I doubt you are going to get him 2 change his mind
719513140707377152 2016-04-11 13:11:15 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @jimananich @MichiganUnited @RuthMottFdn @MiAEYC great cause! Even better one would be to get rid of Evil Governor Snyder! He is a criminal
719512788780105730 2016-04-11 13:09:51 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @mitchellvii I'm shocked as long as you've been around you don't know there is NOTHING FAIR about politics. You do what you have to do!
719510011525861377 2016-04-11 12:58:49 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @TheHockeyNews you forgot to mention that could this be the year a Canadian team FINALLY wins the Cup???

718891253233033216 2016-04-09 20:00:05 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @RedWingDiehards it better or the next 4 games will be very rough to watch
718857833064841216 2016-04-09 17:47:17 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Wings end up losing 3-1. Rangers get an empty netter.  They play today like they have this season - "lackluster" Capt. Z, not much.
718848975839870980 2016-04-09 17:12:06 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Wings really need this first goal.
718249120125820929 2016-04-07 01:28:29 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @mglbill @TheMasters obviously very cool Bill

718246199887806465 2016-04-07 01:16:53 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @RedWingsMemes knowing the Wings lose tonight what happens if Boston and Detroit both win their next game? Who gets that 3rd spot?
718244176488435713 2016-04-07 01:08:50 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @MKornheiser @TKLittles damn dog doesn't appear to like orange
718243258137243649 2016-04-07 01:05:11 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Not winning the one. And Pierre McGuire really sucks.
718235517217857538 2016-04-07 00:34:26 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Philly now down 3-1 to Toronto. Very nice
718235023489527808 2016-04-07 00:32:28 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik and of course not give up ANY
718233402890153985 2016-04-07 00:26:02 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik huge goal, especially if they can get that next one.
718231873378455553 2016-04-07 00:19:57 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Will need to beat the Rangers Saturday.
717890259174993925 2016-04-06 01:42:30 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @HbWINGer27 it's our night tonight!
717538791595098112 2016-04-05 02:25:53 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @mitchellvii could it be that finally Trump has run out of gas? He's had a couple terrible weeks
717538329328291843 2016-04-05 02:24:03 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @kevinjohnson366 @mitchellvii I'm with you. When Trump gets beat it's always someone cheats with results. Own your defeats like u do wins
717529992196931584 2016-04-05 01:50:55 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @mitchellvii what are you saying??? Trump still will win tonight??
717529389987196930 2016-04-05 01:48:32 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @KamVTV So I guess we scratch Wisconsin off the list of blue states that Donald Trump turns to red in November. #Analysis
717528784195477505 2016-04-05 01:46:07 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @mitchellvii Appears from national polls that the vast majority of Rubio's vote has gone to Cruz or Kasich.
717528297966477312 2016-04-05 01:44:11 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @mitchellvii Related: Trump has gained only 5 points in national polls since Jan. 31, as the field has winnowed from 12 candidates to 3.

717525662400135168 2016-04-05 01:33:43 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @mitchellvii why is it that when Cruz wins you seem to always claim something illegal going on?? What's the real deal here??

716079873001971712 2016-04-01 01:48:40 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @WingsRiders when's the last time Wings beat a very good team on road?? Hell, they can't even beat Leafs or Mont at home.

716079157659234304 2016-04-01 01:45:49 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Minnesota wins this one in OT or shootout. Count on it. Detroit doesn't deserve to be in playoffs. They having been good this year.
716078434531852292 2016-04-01 01:42:57 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Boston beats a very good team on the road. Detroit loses to a bad team at home. When's the last time Detroit beat a very good team on road?

715873796968816640 2016-04-01 12:09:48 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @mitchellvii is Fox News really that much in bed with Ted Cruz??? If they are, doesn't that say they think Cruz is the #1 GOP candidate?
715872296620199936 2016-04-01 12:03:50 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @mitchellvii you are probably right BUT Trump really needs to be more selective with what he says. The news people want his hide.

715000280010661890 2016-03-29 02:18:45 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> I thought the Wings would lose 4-1. At least they made it a game. #RedWings
714994185846321152 2016-03-29 01:54:32 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Let's see our captain score is a goal! Or Datsyuk!  Lots of pretty passes don't put the fucking puck in the net!!

714980179358138368 2016-03-29 00:58:53 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Mantha!! A big time goal in his own back yard.
714979503781580800 2016-03-29 00:56:12 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Goose!!! That might get him off the 4th line.
714979250701475841 2016-03-29 00:55:11 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tkulfan I thought Mike Green was really good on the power play. He definitely hasn't been.
714978103311863808 2016-03-29 00:50:38 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Maybe this will wake up the sleeping Red Wings. Who desperately need this game.
714969995453837314 2016-03-29 00:18:25 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @HbWINGer27 I haven't seen ANY momentum from our guys tonight. No real offensive threat even when we weren't short handed.
714969004767584257 2016-03-29 00:14:28 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @RedWingsMemes other than the Riley S breakaway have the Wings even come close to scoring??
714968293229125632 2016-03-29 00:11:39 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik And how about at least 3 goals.
714965994050076673 2016-03-29 00:02:31 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @tkulfan 2-0
714965776374095876 2016-03-29 00:01:39 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> at least you won't have to worry about giving Mrazek a big contract. #RedWingssuck
714951878350602244 2016-03-29 23:06:25 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Predictions for tonight. Montreal 4, Wings 1.  We see both Wings goalies. Neither were good.

713811096218558464 2016-03-26 19:33:21 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> This one is over. Wings switching goalies again. Once again, this team HAS NO BUSINESS making the playoffs. They are mediocre at best
713809951928483840 2016-03-26 19:28:49 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik Quincey got abused. Wings now need at least 3 MORE goals. #ouch

713188026856390656 2016-03-24 02:17:30 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> That was a HUGE win in what could be a HUGE night for the Red Wings.
713183596870246401 2016-03-24 01:59:54 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ctsbulls the season is over. What a terrible season it's been.
713183170804457473 2016-03-24 01:58:12 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik what else would you expect? Both announcers are "homers" for their teams.
713181583197487105 2016-03-24 01:51:54 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @detroithockey96 exactly.  Very, very mediocre all year
713180038900875265 2016-03-24 01:45:46 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @RedWingsMemes Kenny doesn't do those kinds of things. It's not "the Red Wing way"
713179360438722560 2016-03-24 01:43:04 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> This would the ultimate loss IF it happens. 4-2 now - let's see what these next 15 minutes hold. Season may be over if they end up losing
713178842458927105 2016-03-24 01:41:00 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @RedWingsMemes they don't have much else to replace him.

713154429223051266 2016-03-24 00:04:00 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Yet another terrible power play. Lucky they didn't give up a shorty. I just can't see the Wings winning.

712458516188041216 2016-03-22 01:58:41 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> From what Ozzie and Ken Daniels r saying Mantha probably will end up breaking Gordie's goal records. #whatelsecanutalkabout in this blowout

710634328447967232 2016-03-17 01:10:01 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik yet another very very tough watch. Our Wings just aren't very exciting. Just think how they'd be without Larkin.
710632498879979520 2016-03-17 01:02:45 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @wwmtnews what is bad is that your station spent 3 times the time on this story & not on our crooked governor testifying in DC. U guys r bad
710612040965099521 2016-03-17 23:41:27 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Nobblescrunch doesn't sound like a real easy/simple thing to do
710578344543326208 2016-03-17 21:27:33 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @PaulPabst hottie
710552342983254016 2016-03-17 19:44:14 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @GolfersCoach G. Too high a ball flight and my ball often plugs or spins backward 2-3 inches. No roll. 
710551828904198144 2016-03-17 19:42:12 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @BarrettSallee but Baylor wouldn't beat Yale in debating.
710551529929973760 2016-03-17 19:41:00 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Since these NCAA basketball games have started 3+ hours ago I've already seen over 100 commercials. #MarchMadness
709927390722523136 2016-03-15 02:20:54 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @jordanjfrasier what a fucking Cluck
709926643113074692 2016-03-15 02:17:56 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @DavidCornDC he is proud of his work with Jeb and the campaign he ran. That about says it all about that Asshat
709925920082173952 2016-03-15 02:15:03 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @thefix @TheFix must be referring to your work on the TK show
709920601717211137 2016-03-15 01:53:55 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @CourtneyCummz downright scary if Trump continues to win. How about you?
709914727271505920 2016-03-15 01:30:35 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JulieDiCaro no abortions of any kind is his absolute worst position
709914096368558081 2016-03-15 01:28:04 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ArleneArgento his home state. He had to win it. What other state can he win?? Not enough if any
709913283118153728 2016-03-15 01:24:50 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Lrihendry losing Ohio tonight is huge for Trump. The GOP won't let him win
709908325098508289 2016-03-15 01:05:08 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @AnnCoulter @EricTrump losing Ohio will be the killer.
709907623269810176 2016-03-15 01:02:21 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik 30-11.
709907047467380736 2016-03-15 01:00:04 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> SOG 30-11!  What a joke
709905358958026752 2016-03-15 00:53:21 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> The Flyers are just the better team. It should be clear to everyone
709902111929212928 2016-03-15 00:40:27 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @TurboGrandma poor Little Marco
709901960493854720 2016-03-15 00:39:51 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @wingingitmotown it HAS to be better than those first 20 minutes. #dreadful
709901656926920705 2016-03-15 00:38:39 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik I think sadly you are in the minority. The Wings have really struggled all year. Take away Larkin/Mrazek & they don't have much
709898761179369472 2016-03-15 00:27:08 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> RIP Little Marco
709898592593571840 2016-03-15 00:26:28 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ChrisRRegan and do more praying
709898371956342784 2016-03-15 00:25:35 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @TheWingerDaily equally bad against less talented Columbus and Toronto.
709898110013739008 2016-03-15 00:24:33 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @RedWingDiehards they've been super soft for years. Back then they had goal scorers and Lidstrom. Now they r just soft
709897321488769024 2016-03-15 00:21:25 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ColinCowherd @newballpark hey Cowherd?? You not on the radio anymore???
709897048817082368 2016-03-15 00:20:20 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik time to put the puck on the net. This might be worse than the Columbus or Maple Leaf disasters.
709896692682899456 2016-03-15 00:18:55 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Would a 100% Darren Helm really make much of a difference??? No Ken, it wouldn't.
709895545838575616 2016-03-15 00:14:22 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Mickey: not sure I get your point about the Flyers due for a penalty. Have u see the Wings PP lately?? It sucks. #DetroitRedWings
709895049912426496 2016-03-15 00:12:23 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik @adamdibart find somebody to take Howard? Get some help on defense are musts.
709893507515809792 2016-03-15 00:06:16 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik Philadelphia is vastly superior to whatever Detroit has put on the ice.  It's not even close.
709892113253662720 2016-03-15 00:00:43 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Ken Daniels, save your breath the Wings are soft. And have been for some time.
709891197758808066 2016-03-15 23:57:05 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Stick a big fork in our Detroit Red Wings. They are the better team
709885362408128513 2016-03-15 23:33:54 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Critical AND Crucial Game Tonight. Wings really need 2 points and a regulation win.
709707983543001088 2016-03-15 11:49:03 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Lady_Jane_420pic.twitter.com/a3nwqXb2T9
709532670154444802 2016-03-14 00:12:25 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JerryNegrelli @CollegeSpun believe me Jerry, you could NEVER win. Way 2 talented.
709529243563204608 2016-03-14 23:58:48 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JerryNegrelli @CollegeSpun Jerry!!! You could never top Screaming A Smith. Or at least 6-8 of these other people.
709528551133978624 2016-03-14 23:56:03 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ZigFracassi Zig - This the Year for MY CUBS!!! I'm 65 and running out of time waiting on them to win it.
709527611655987200 2016-03-14 23:52:19 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ZMiller86 @bears_insider welcome back!! Great to have you.
709527288761749506 2016-03-14 23:51:02 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @ZigFracassi @Ken_Rosenthal those Reds might be playing in the toughest division in baseball. Cubs, Cards & Bucs. They better feast on Milw
709526587507675137 2016-03-14 23:48:15 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @MKornheiser @BraunFilm what a great looking dog. Smart looking too, but I'm betting Spike rules again.
709381925283217409 2016-03-14 14:13:25 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @SRKinnee whoever it was, they should get an award.
709381680159727616 2016-03-14 14:12:26 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @DavidChalian @WalterReports that really is an awesome photo
709202110030733315 2016-03-13 02:18:54 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Inexcusable loss at home tonight. Coupled with a terrible performance against Columbus. See you next year Detroit.
709201305466769408 2016-03-13 02:15:42 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @TheWingerDaily why shouldn't they tonight. They are scoreless and losing to the lousy Maple Leafs. Respect is earned. The Wings suck 2nite
709195762664652800 2016-03-13 01:53:40 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @RedWingsMemes not really. Philly will probably be up 2-3,goals after 1st period. If that happens - game over. Season over
709194667057934336 2016-03-13 01:49:19 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Here comes another dreadful Red Wings power play!!!
709194373209128960 2016-03-13 01:48:09 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @detroithockey96 @wingingitmotown and more interesting   50 minutes and nothing! Against the lousy Maple Leafs. In a game they have to win
709192562641395712 2016-03-13 01:40:57 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @SaraMurray that ends Kasich's chances
709192410698543106 2016-03-13 01:40:21 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @HallieJackson @JohnKasich that ought to really end Kasich's chances to win his home state. Mitt doesn't move the needle
709192059534573568 2016-03-13 01:38:57 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> New week, new tweets, new stats. 28 followers, 22 unfollowers. Via good oldhttp://www.crowdfireapp.com/?r=tw
709186464513445888 2016-03-13 01:16:43 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @richarddeitsch that production was awful and embarrassing.
709186128851701760 2016-03-13 01:15:23 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> A Wings loss tonight after a terrible game against equally bad Columbus. I'm checking out for this season. NCAA, baseball and golf for me
709185687409565696 2016-03-13 01:13:38 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @RedWingDiehards the lousy Maple Leafs are much better than the Red Wings tonight. Sad
709185191936466944 2016-03-13 01:11:40 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> The Wings can't even get a shot on their power play. The really are mediocre.
709183096931917824 2016-03-13 01:03:20 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @jppalmCBS elect whoever did this President! Still more trustworthy than any of the GOP candidates
709181927635472385 2016-03-13 00:58:42 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @SethDavisHoops @GottliebShow that CBS Selection Show today was worse than awful. Luckily in the first half hour someone posted the bracket
709167799164387328 2016-03-13 00:02:33 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik those first 3 minutes were scary. Hopefully that will be it. It would be wonderful to not have a close game AND WIN
709166680539308034 2016-03-13 23:58:06 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik very very happy Howard didn't get the call tonight. I think it's time we ride Mrazek, no matter how many back-to-backs left
709165753283559425 2016-03-13 23:54:25 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik part 2, especially since Philly doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
709165545208356865 2016-03-13 23:53:36 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik yes it is. Looking at the remaining schedule it's a game they really have to win.
709165080945016832 2016-03-13 23:51:45 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik I get yur point about Leafs but don't  Rangers get up for Pit? Yet Pit won a crucial game on road 2day vs NYR a much betterteam
709163427202211840 2016-03-13 23:45:11 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @RedWingDiehards no line for me.
709162099344347136 2016-03-13 23:39:54 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik As always is the case u know far more than me, but this can't be another Columbus-like performance. Wings r better team CLEARLY
709161501505011713 2016-03-13 23:37:32 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik no excuse for a letdown, or poor performance tonight. Wings should be safely ahead going into 3rd period. 2 points are crucial
709146964315742208 2016-03-13 22:39:46 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> F You Buckeye Clark Kellogg. You acted like it's a tragedy the Wolverines got in. And the thief that's Doug Gottleib, F U 2. #GoBlue

707963298243809280 2016-03-10 16:16:18 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @mitchellvii I'd like to think you are right but with so many people against him, he still has a very uphill fight to get enough delegates
707962189865488384 2016-03-10 16:11:54 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @AnsarKhanMLive praying he stops the puck tonight. Wings can't afford another loss tonight.
707961837250338816 2016-03-10 16:10:29 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @DanLevyThinks Frank Underwood has to be #1. At least Claire is nice to look at.

707752992640991232 2016-03-09 02:20:37 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @jennajameson watch out for Cougars on your walk. I've heard they can be really fierce.

707744243507437568 2016-03-09 01:45:51 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Johnathan_Wood1 @dabearsblog thanks for responding. Go Bears. Hope they get an A+ draft grade.
707743822235705344 2016-03-09 01:44:11 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Johnathan_Wood1 @dabearsblog what did you hope they would do?? Or will do??
707743010201735168 2016-03-09 01:40:57 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Johnathan_Wood1 @dabearsblog I very much respect your opinion. So please give a letter grade on how Bears did today. With a few comments. 
707721209316827138 2016-03-09 00:14:19 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @TheTroyJohnson how is it big?? There r only 4 teams that can win title. GS, SanA, OKC and obviously East team Cleve. The rest r meaningless
707720664845836288 2016-03-09 00:12:09 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @LARedWing yes indeed. We probably have at least 5 players no one wants. And Helm doesn't do it for me either. They also paid Abby too much
707720056894046209 2016-03-09 00:09:45 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Holy_Elle happy I survived yesterday's coup where u unfollowed lots of peeps
707719651195809792 2016-03-09 00:08:08 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @LARedWing they really only have 6-8 untouchables. Obviously while at end of careers u can't trade Pav or Z
707719152178479104 2016-03-09 00:06:09 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @LARedWing we've fallen in love with 2 many of this current group. It's easy to do, but not a wise thing to do. We have lots of 3-4th liners
707718563411435520 2016-03-09 00:03:48 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @LARedWing lots and lots of dead wood on the current roster. End of the season is a great time to get rid of 5-10 players.

707331127611146240 2016-03-08 22:24:17 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @SiriusXMNHL Hurricanes??? Is that always lousy team still in the NHL?? Who cares about them.

706979480762503168 2016-03-07 23:06:57 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JulieDiCaro my guess is Jared Stoll will now probably pop the question to Erin. Might even get down on his knees for her to say yes

706891546529030144 2016-03-07 17:17:32 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JustinDacey i didn't but I wasn't. The NCAA is a joke. This Carolina crap has gone on long enough.
706890170897993729 2016-03-07 17:12:04 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @JustinDacey @CBSSportsCFB why hasn't the NCAA ruled on N. Carolina basketball? This penalty should come first. What they did was criminal!

703781524395728896 2016-02-27 03:19:25 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Is there ANY chance these Red Wings can score TWO MORE goals in this game??? I think it's highly doubtful

701583640774504449 2016-02-21 01:45:49 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @backstreetsmag stunning!!!! Have any of the boss crowd surfing during hungry heart??? Those always make me moist

701577370390679552 2016-02-21 01:20:54 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> We're probably less than 5 minutes from the bad goal given up by Jimmy Howard. #RedWings
701247531196530688 2016-02-20 03:30:14 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @brandi_love @Brandi_Love I sure get lots and lots of mentions whenever I tweet with you. {{{{Thanks}}}} and more important, love the dark eye look

701240331614953472 2016-02-20 03:01:38 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @RedWingsMemes this team is a tough watch. no threat to do anything IF they make playoffs. Do something at trading deadline not same oldshit
701238496468537344 2016-02-20 02:54:20 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @brandi_love @Brandi_Love According to WashPost Trump is ahead in the next 10 primary races. Rubio is really his only legit opposition and he has won 0
701236565553631232 2016-02-20 02:46:40 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @brandi_love @Brandi_Love I agree about Rubio, he hasn't done anything remarkable. But Trump is & always has been a winner. Cruz, not so much & evil
701222372607713281 2016-02-20 01:50:16 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @chucktodd can't Jenna run for something??
701220088574320640 2016-02-20 01:41:11 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik poor Jeb. He is in worse shape than Jimmy Howard
701216234864570369 2016-02-20 01:25:53 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @brandi_love @Brandi_Love love those dark eyes. Darker than usual. What's your take on SC? U said it was Trump or Cruz. I just don't get Cruz he is evil
701215931461140480 2016-02-20 01:24:40 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @maggieNYT @chucktodd it's not until November
701215690108366850 2016-02-20 01:23:43 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Once again tonight the Red Wings are a very very tough watch. This team just isn't very good. No threat IF they make playoffs.
700873878323728384 2016-02-19 02:45:28 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @brandi_love @Brandi_Love do you have a candidate you support?

697579286715305985 2016-02-10 00:33:57 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @georgemalik the Wings appear to have a jump in their step tonight. Hopefully they keep it going.
697577437132148736 2016-02-10 00:26:36 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Red Wings fans: who has the worst hands?? Draper or Helm??? Both aren't good.

697497928580132865 2016-02-10 19:10:39 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @rickyhelton1 @49ers @ProFootballHOF you are a Niners fan. Simple question: was he convicted of a crime(s)? If answer is YES - no HOF 4 him
697497273937346561 2016-02-10 19:08:03 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @Bravotv who should give a rats ass??
697497031816933376 2016-02-10 19:07:05 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @PaulKuharskyNFL and you have a lovelier one. 
697496142167326721 2016-02-10 19:03:33 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @PaulKuharskyNFL he was slimy. I think he still is. The HOF can't be that hard up they had to let him in. There HAS to be better candidates
697495560945823744 2016-02-10 19:01:15 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @PaulKuharskyNFL then it should have been no one. Hope Eddie D's bronze head is surrounded by bars. He is a criminal

697489788862119936 2016-02-10 18:38:19 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @BiGGsGOLFTALK @TornadoTeeGolf thank you for the code. I will now SERIOUSLY consider them. 
697489528249049088 2016-02-10 18:37:16 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @BiGGsGOLFTALK @TornadoTeeGolf bottom line for me is while I'm sure your tees are good. They are too pricey for me. Good luck
697489314742140931 2016-02-10 18:36:26 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @BiGGsGOLFTALK @TornadoTeeGolf I break 2-3 per round but usually find 2-3 also. I bought some of those brush tees and didn't note a diff
697488168644427781 2016-02-10 18:31:52 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @wwmtnews get this guy a haircut and shave and he looks a lot like Andy D.

697485249471782912 2016-02-10 18:20:16 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @BiGGsGOLFTALK @TornadoTeeGolf 10 yards is very impressive. But..... By the time I spend $20 (w/shipping) not sure it's worth it.
697483951036825600 2016-02-10 18:15:07 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @BiGGsGOLFTALK @TornadoTeeGolf do you end up 1-3 yards further??? For that price I will settle for my cheap wood tees.
697420522699751424 2016-02-10 14:03:04 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @KarenLeePoter I love your videos. I learn something new each & every time I watch them. U r an amazing lady

696866235712143365 2016-02-08 01:20:32 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> Darren, how would describe that first period??? Trevor it was dull, dull and dull. Typical Wings hockey this year.
696752174555127809 2016-02-08 17:47:18 UTC <TrumpNeeds2Go> @GoBlueHail so true. Goodell is a liar and the NFL has/does terrible things. Problem is most of us can't wait for the season to start again
