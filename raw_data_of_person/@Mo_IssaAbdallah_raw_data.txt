953671656312098817 2018-01-17 16:53:35 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @DTenenbaum Overall I just need them all to stop with their vendettas and come to a a peace agreement. Can we just try this out with NK that SK has also shown interest in?
953671277151219712 2018-01-17 16:52:05 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @DTenenbaum I'm not going to argue about everything in the back and forth that Russia and NATO are having. Overall each party is reacting to each others' actions. Trump sent weapons to Ukraine which probably prompted this "full-scale war" drill.https://www.google.com/amp/www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trump-weapons-ukraine-20171222-story,amp.html
953667829559152640 2018-01-17 16:38:23 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @DTenenbaum NATO is reacting to Russian military drills just like NK is reacting to America military drills
953661668164284416 2018-01-17 16:13:54 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @DTenenbaum NATO may not be threatening but they are acting in a similar fashion to NK when it comes Eastern Europe. NK, Russia, NATO, and the US are reacting to one another so let's just stop the war games on our part and start negotiatinghttps://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/07/31/world/europe/russia-military-exercise-zapad-west.html?referer=https://www.google.com/
953648632363978752 2018-01-17 15:22:06 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @DTenenbaum We just need to get out the way and let them try to hash it out because we haven't been all that helpful to the situation as a whole
953648403472404481 2018-01-17 15:21:11 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @DTenenbaum That's a little ridiculous. The rhetoric is dangerous in large part due to all this military posturing. They may be "just drills" to you but armies don't conduct those drills out of nowhere
953645080660889602 2018-01-17 15:07:59 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @DTenenbaum A big if we won't get to unless these war games stop
953644254173302786 2018-01-17 15:04:42 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @DTenenbaum You want to be ready but if you can come to a peace agreement none of that would be necessary. Even if it did come to another war Seoul is fucked, no weapons defense system can save them
953643112836067328 2018-01-17 15:00:10 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @DTenenbaum Yeah it is, you don't want the two countries that bombed you into oblivion to be practicing what another war would be like

932458447576104961 2017-11-19 03:59:52 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @tory_hicks_ Ditto
932444454149029888 2017-11-19 03:04:16 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @tory_hicks_ Them being cited in part gives them the influence over those in power. They may not have Bezos in mind when they write but he still has invested in an outlet that has writers with a bias that benefits Bezos.
932441289408372736 2017-11-19 02:51:41 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @RespectableLaw @tory_hicks_ He may invest in things that are beneficial to people and might be pleasant to be around but Amazon is still enabling the CIA
932439095921532928 2017-11-19 02:42:59 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @tory_hicks_ All of those news outlets you listed cite the Washington Post quite frequently. They may not have much influence over the general public but those with politics power definitely pay attention to the Washington Post.
932430121084039173 2017-11-19 02:07:19 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @tory_hicks_ The Washington Post isnt all that profitable but, it still has a lot of influence in US politics. It has benefited him to keep these people with these biases influencing US politics.
932427180847583233 2017-11-19 01:55:38 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @RespectableLaw @tory_hicks_ He himself may not be pulling strings in geopolitics but he is giving tools to the US government to affect geopolitics.
932425847654572032 2017-11-19 01:50:20 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @RespectableLaw @tory_hicks_ How his business are ran: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-07/amazon-s-story-time-is-kind-of-a-bummerhttp://www.businessinsider.com/brutal-conditions-in-amazons-warehouses-2013-8
932398088102268928 2017-11-19 00:00:01 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @RespectableLaw @tory_hicks_ Agreed, he will also keep those people with biases that are beneficial to him and his businesses on staff
932396600181313536 2017-11-19 23:54:07 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @RespectableLaw @tory_hicks_ Again dude its just a guess I had
932396224308744193 2017-11-19 23:52:37 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @RespectableLaw @tory_hicks_ More neohawk coverage gets people scared and wanting more money to be spent on defense, intelligence, etc. This creates more of a business opportunity for Bezos
932395361787895809 2017-11-19 23:49:11 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @RespectableLaw @tory_hicks_ And I said its just a guess. Its also really likely that the editors or writers just have that bias themselves
932394630003462146 2017-11-19 23:46:17 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @RespectableLaw @tory_hicks_ Its not just about profits when it comes to ownership of media companies. Its about controlling a narrative that is beneficial to the owners.
932353124047753216 2017-11-19 21:01:21 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @RespectableLaw My guess would be it has something to do with Bezo's contract with the CIA

823164599910432769 2017-01-22 13:45:08 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @DTenenbaum of course they don't. They all benefit from the situation as is so why ever change it?
823164405420527621 2017-01-22 13:44:22 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @DTenenbaum that's what a lot of these conversations end up becoming, bunch of adults whining like children

823162716743495683 2017-01-22 13:37:39 UTC <Mo_IssaAbdallah> @DTenenbaum if we go based off just annexing land the settlements are pretty close to that
