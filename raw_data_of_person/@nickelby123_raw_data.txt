897844154805497856 2017-08-16 15:35:02 UTC <nickelby123> @amadoit__ someone made this, looked at it, nodded proudly to themselves and thought "o hell yea this feel so right" and hit send.  come on ppl

894250419408580611 2017-08-06 17:34:49 UTC <nickelby123> My #1 cruise tip: find and use every single bathroom before you do anything else. This way you'll never be caught unawares on the high sea
893450442117709824 2017-08-04 12:35:59 UTC <nickelby123> @unfitforpurpose it's not only easy, but Poch's tactics don't even require his midfielders to work hard or run themselves into the ground at all
893202916667949056 2017-08-03 20:12:24 UTC <nickelby123> @CarefreeBluePod definitely on my to-listen list, gents!

892481550872457216 2017-08-01 20:25:57 UTC <nickelby123> @amadoit__ Okay all right, we get it Amadi, you're great at video editing. I know this because THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THIS IS POSSIBLE.

888048795274969092 2017-07-20 14:51:46 UTC <nickelby123> @amadoit__ @KBJelly @CarefreeBluePod Haven't seen Morata play much. Can you guys talk about what we can expect? He's like... a big, creative, clinical fwd? Sounds too good, no?
887763640266313728 2017-07-19 19:58:40 UTC <nickelby123> @Torvaney Ah of course. Thanks for clearing that up!
887755319782154241 2017-07-19 19:25:36 UTC <nickelby123> @Torvaney Ohhhh gotcha, duh. So xA is fairly useless as a team summary stat. The sum of all players' xA = team xG?
887749432313233408 2017-07-19 19:02:12 UTC <nickelby123> @Torvaney @BobbyGardiner you're forgetting Honesty.
887748946138865665 2017-07-19 19:00:16 UTC <nickelby123> @Torvaney I guess not! I was thinking of a way to express 'successful' build up that didn't eventually end in a shot and contrib to xG  is this xA?
887747224070889473 2017-07-19 18:53:26 UTC <nickelby123> @Torvaney xG, xG/shot, chances created (although I think I do see these sometimes?)  but these are obvious probably

848524041782779904 2017-04-02 13:14:31 UTC <nickelby123> @dandormer agree with the 'unlucky' take, but the fact that cumulative xG doesn't separate til ~75' suggests we didn't create enough until too late

841763978325970944 2017-03-14 21:32:26 UTC <nickelby123> I wrote about Antonio Conte and how he's reinvigorated Chelsea!! #CFChttps://twitter.com/ChelseaIndex/status/841749058221932545
841442588875997185 2017-03-13 00:15:21 UTC <nickelby123> @AttackingCB right, plus I guess rashford would have liked nothing more than to run directly at a disheveled back line (which he did)
841432977242492932 2017-03-13 23:37:09 UTC <nickelby123> @AttackingCB maybe but once a cfc cb steps up into midfield (2-5-3), wouldn't it be fairly easy to drag United out of shape?
841291378101538816 2017-03-13 14:14:29 UTC <nickelby123> @EricHartman like a surgeon

840988502787526657 2017-03-12 18:10:58 UTC <nickelby123> Took 11 seconds for Chelsea to score here against West Ham last week. Hoping for more of the same tomorrow! #CFChttps://twitter.com/nickelby123/status/839277124850712581

839185948030210048 2017-03-07 18:48:15 UTC <nickelby123> @amadoit__ part of me wishes the stewards let azpi and costa destroy this man while kante ran away with hazard on his shoulders to save him

837298612359036928 2017-03-02 13:48:40 UTC <nickelby123> @neilcharles_uk yes that sounds perfect

837291790227095552 2017-03-02 13:21:33 UTC <nickelby123> @unfitforpurpose @neilcharles_uk tried that last night and it didn't seem to work. Will maybe give it another go later
837290766003220480 2017-03-02 13:17:29 UTC <nickelby123> @unfitforpurpose @neilcharles_uk is there a way for arrows to be deleted in later frames? my gif above is two separate animations, connected

837280954133671936 2017-03-02 12:38:30 UTC <nickelby123> Chelsea CBs immensely important for buildup. Step up and/or wide to open passing lanes to fwds or wingbacks. Example from Swansea match #CFCpic.twitter.com/aBnGOApMvX
836924839453724672 2017-03-01 13:03:25 UTC <nickelby123> @ESPNFC @liam_twomey @LeonDuke i think a big part of their def success is preventing crosses from coming in: Kante, Alonso closing down

779740939011121152 2016-09-24 17:55:01 UTC <nickelby123> @amadoit__ the match ends, Courtois does nothing. The rest of the squad boards the bus back to Stamford Bridge. Courtois, nothing.

779733550048354305 2016-09-24 17:25:39 UTC <nickelby123> @UnusualEfforts Alonso will be fit enough soon, that's Ivanovic gone. Zouma back soon, Cahill gone.

767385460339576832 2016-08-21 15:38:45 UTC <nickelby123> @CarefreeBluePod his reactions are always played 2x slower than other manager's. think it takes away from talking about his tactical acumen
767385011116969984 2016-08-21 15:36:58 UTC <nickelby123> @CarefreeBluePod ok one thing I'm starting to hate is media portrayal of Conte as ultra-emotional and passionate. It's like a caricature.
767035408710561792 2016-08-20 16:27:46 UTC <nickelby123> looks like we have an effective alternate tactical setup, with Cesc pulling the strings behind two forwardshttps://twitter.com/nickelby123/status/765593690626809856

695445069114032128 2016-02-04 03:13:19 UTC <nickelby123> @trueblueAC @feroze17 finally some sense. The last thing we want to do is sell one of our few remaining midfielders.

692579713965920256 2016-01-27 05:27:25 UTC <nickelby123> @pktazn goddammit, I am so sorry. That is the worst.
692377106047696897 2016-01-27 16:02:20 UTC <nickelby123> @amadoit Wow he's older than I thought! Doubt they'll let him leave though...
692346098501971970 2016-01-27 13:59:07 UTC <nickelby123> shoutout to my dude rocking The Mask of Zorro to pass the time on this transcontinental flight

691728725470240770 2016-01-25 21:05:54 UTC <nickelby123> @amadoit I'm gonna miss Ramires! Sure his passing was... not great, and his shot selection was... subpar, but still!!! Great club servant.
691683407366078469 2016-01-25 18:05:49 UTC <nickelby123> @cybernetali @YouTube go Robert!!!

691616650563620864 2016-01-25 13:40:33 UTC <nickelby123> @MessiSeconds yeah... they were truly awful. At least yesterday result gives me hope!
691614871549517825 2016-01-25 13:33:29 UTC <nickelby123> @amadoit and in the season it would make me nervous. He'd give it away too easily. Now though... 
691614709821390848 2016-01-25 13:32:51 UTC <nickelby123> @amadoit I got so excited whenever he was on the ball. He's always thoughtful, careful, and never moves *too* quickly
691613921090899969 2016-01-25 13:29:43 UTC <nickelby123> @MessiSeconds I wish you released this earlier... Maybe Jose would have been spared! (performance but not results started to improve)

691417372025032705 2016-01-24 00:28:42 UTC <nickelby123> @worldsoccertalk *phew* a Chelsea win means I don't have to avoid all soccer media for another week! 
691385026194325504 2016-01-24 22:20:10 UTC <nickelby123> @FootieFromAfar I know every club has dumb fans but... I mean, this is just so so awful. they're so awful.
691384570143444995 2016-01-24 22:18:21 UTC <nickelby123> There's nothing more shameful for filipinos than ruining the lumpia
691323363592134656 2016-01-24 18:15:08 UTC <nickelby123> @MC_of_A seemed that chances falling to Flamini may have been partly due to Chelsea defenders prioritizing others (Ozil, Ramsey, Walcott)

690960474104545280 2016-01-23 18:13:09 UTC <nickelby123> @MC_of_A so for this kind of match would it be fair to say that finishing was clinical for both sides? eg, "taking their chances"

690896469755351040 2016-01-23 13:58:49 UTC <nickelby123> @dirtymikeusa @DirtyMikeUSA random q but do you know how 'key dribbles' are determined in fifa?

690599895481389057 2016-01-22 18:20:20 UTC <nickelby123> @feroze17 if Fab scores, will you do an animation???
690599765252390912 2016-01-22 18:19:49 UTC <nickelby123> @worldsoccertalk would have been a mistake to let a leader who has done so much for the club go, esp during these dark times.
690542635782688768 2016-01-22 14:32:48 UTC <nickelby123> @nickelby123 @KBJelly @ESPNFC @karlsentk @ESPNInsider okay I immediately take this back... there is *some* good stuff on there.
690539799694962688 2016-01-22 14:21:32 UTC <nickelby123> @GetWestChelsea yes people who haven't realized the harm losing three leaders in the past two years (Lampard, Drogba, Cech) has caused
690538909898522624 2016-01-22 14:18:00 UTC <nickelby123> @KBJelly @ESPNFC @karlsentk @ESPNInsider Haha as if I needed another reason to never turn to ESPN for anything football related ever again
