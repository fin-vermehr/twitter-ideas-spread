970582193075564545 2018-03-05 08:50:02 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @davidallengreen So Brexit achieves nothing.
970405743538077699 2018-03-04 21:08:53 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @zemblamatic Dont.
970378481119965185 2018-03-04 19:20:33 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @DanielJHannan If we hadnt given up our place in the single market, like you said we wouldnt, this would be a whole lot easier. Youre all liars.
969534099173109760 2018-03-02 11:25:16 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @BrexitBin We wont get any answers.
969467768524496897 2018-03-01 07:01:42 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @DouglasCarswell Heros, Douglas. They are heros.
969310395910557696 2018-03-01 20:36:21 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @theresa_may @steve29hall @DavidDavisMP All aspiration and no substance. Absolute joke of a government.
969307187607691264 2018-03-01 20:23:37 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> The cast of Hollyoaks vs Manchester City  #AFCvMCFC
969305571789860865 2018-03-01 20:17:11 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Arsenal dont like it up em.
969300187972849664 2018-03-01 19:55:48 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Our embarrassment of a government is hoping the EU will offer us a no-change deal and circumstances identical to  SM and CU to ensure no hard border. This country is run by idiots. #brexit #idiots #fbpe #BrexitLies
969290362266189824 2018-03-01 19:16:45 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> ANOTHER #Brexit speech on the way from @theresa_may . Maybe this one wont be full of aspiration and will actually have some substance / solutions?
969282732487598081 2018-03-01 18:46:26 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> #Brexit is too moronic an idea to succeed.
968909846937587713 2018-02-28 18:04:43 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Lolhttps://twitter.com/davidlammy/status/968774598249590784
968562786639994880 2018-02-27 19:05:38 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @ydnhkrm Have a kit kat and consider your options.
968219333137784835 2018-02-26 20:20:52 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @proud_remoaner A terrifying prospect.
968214548674203649 2018-02-26 20:01:51 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @proud_remoaner I wont forgive any party that supports Brexit.
968209235090771969 2018-02-26 19:40:44 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @proud_remoaner We can see now what the tories do with free reign and no coalition restraints.
968209011110793217 2018-02-26 19:39:51 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @proud_remoaner Ive never understood that logic. I wont vote for a party that broke promise on tuition fees but I will vote for one that launched an illegal war in Iraq.
968207605859569664 2018-02-26 19:34:16 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Isnt Corbyns CU proposal more pie in the sky? And if so he hasnt distanced himself from the tories at all?
968207329341661184 2018-02-26 19:33:10 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @proud_remoaner labLib is possible? If a general election is triggered some time soon.
968206183625576448 2018-02-26 19:28:37 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Corbyn, Mogg, Davis, McDonnell. All the fucking same.
968204098297389056 2018-02-26 19:20:20 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @proud_remoaner I hold a tiny hope that everyone will turn their back on Brexit parties.
968199841087188992 2018-02-26 19:03:25 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @proud_remoaner So vote Green or Lib Dem so there is no Brexit?
968196506087026689 2018-02-26 18:50:09 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Why would you vote for labour if you dont want #Brexit?
968156293683871745 2018-02-26 16:10:22 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> If he wasnt a brexiter corbyn would suggest staying in SM as well as a CU. But hes a Brexiter so 
968045202886873088 2018-02-26 08:48:56 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @IanDunt Preparing for disappointment. If they had any guts theyd proposed a second ref.
968044958648295424 2018-02-26 08:47:58 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @tinkerpuss Bullshit.
968039677952516096 2018-02-26 08:26:59 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> When liars like @Nigel_Farage are called out they do their best to smother their opposition. #brexit is based on lies and misinformation and its bound to fail. @Femi_Sorryhttps://twitter.com/ofocbrexit/status/968038362459328513
967822934210465798 2018-02-25 18:05:43 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Its six pm and still daylight

967470004743622658 2018-02-24 18:43:18 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @LeaveEUOfficial Lol
967370457023418368 2018-02-24 12:07:44 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Its dawning in #Brexit supporters that leaving the #EU is bat shit crazy. #brexitisdead

967354736570720256 2018-02-24 11:05:16 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> #Brexit isnt going to happen.
966742690284097536 2018-02-22 18:33:13 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> The #nra are going to become toxic in the USA. which is good. Anyone they support will be doomed.
966377469715668992 2018-02-21 18:21:57 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> I dont know why the Torries would want to smear #Corbyn. Hes their greatest #Brexit ally. #StopBrexit
966229942055956481 2018-02-21 08:35:44 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> The pro gun lobby in America are insane. Completely in a different planet.
965864306091986945 2018-02-20 08:22:50 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Imagine if people just didnt vote for the Brexit parties of Labour, Conservative and UKIP. Imagine if tribalism wasnt so fierce. Imagine if Labour just kicked out Corbyn.
965683422445305856 2018-02-19 20:24:04 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Are we still believing in the boy?
965671363083108352 2018-02-19 19:36:08 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> The GFA hasnt failed. Its just getting in the way of your #Brexit. Its Brexit that has failed because its pointless and achieves absolutely nothing. Youre talking crap again @DanielJHannan https://twitter.com/danieljhannan/status/965300247428784129
965661142969397252 2018-02-19 18:55:32 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Peace in NI is getting in the way of #Brexit. Brexit is finished. #stopbrexit #FBPE #WATONhttps://twitter.com/bo0_radley_/status/964777074144759808
965657864651059200 2018-02-19 18:42:30 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Fun times on Manchester metro link tonight 
965346460928827397 2018-02-18 22:05:06 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @BeccaEHarrison Script is clunky as hell.
965310768827772928 2018-02-18 19:43:16 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @KateHoeyMP This is why I pay my license fee. Mogg is an abomination and his voting record confirms this. He should be ridiculed for his ancient and outdated views.
965306236378984449 2018-02-18 19:25:15 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @BeccaEHarrison The woman in black is superb.
965284276148277248 2018-02-18 17:58:00 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @WestmonsterUK Lol. Id get used to saying that.

965282671659225088 2018-02-18 17:51:37 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Superb result that.
965279968040247298 2018-02-18 17:40:53 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> The argument in support of #brexit is lost. No-one wants to be poorer and living in a country that is worse off. Its absolutely pointless. Brexit is finished. #brexitisdead
965278497877962752 2018-02-18 17:35:02 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Do they mean experts? That must be painful for them.https://twitter.com/leavemnsleave/status/965188354194202624

964842762024767488 2018-02-17 12:43:35 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @CharmlessNurk Shut that gate and keep it shut!
964777074144759808 2018-02-17 08:22:33 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> They're just saying this to remove the responsibility of ending the Good Friday Agreement from #Brexit. They've dropped a ball and they know it. Brexit is in its death throes.https://twitter.com/OwenPaterson/status/964531995421368321
964468350251421702 2018-02-16 11:55:48 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Brexit isnt going to happen. Its too stupid an idea.
964264708781101057 2018-02-15 22:26:36 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> An argument put forward by a gobshite, whether accurate and true, never wins people over because it has been articulated by a gobshite.
963895487811203075 2018-02-14 21:59:27 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @ydnhkrm Ive removed my previous favourite.

963438836578750464 2018-02-13 15:44:53 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Im looking forward to a national day of celebration when #Brexit is canned. Wont be long now.
963071610444972034 2018-02-12 15:25:39 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> But the Remainers were telling lie after lie and it was all Project Fear?  This man is the worst kind of charlatan.https://twitter.com/danieljhannan/status/963069658193592320
962785649576292352 2018-02-11 20:29:21 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @capnbobfrapples @ydnhkrm Omg you cant say that
962784785360924673 2018-02-11 20:25:55 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @ydnhkrm @capnbobfrapples But you are head judge? So you MUST judge?
962784083100172288 2018-02-11 20:23:07 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Im sure if @theresa_may keeps doing big speeches everything will turn out fine. #brexit
962782528590548994 2018-02-11 20:16:57 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @DexterAlmighty9 @ydnhkrm @achknalligewelt Mrk was giving me 750,000. Now youre giving me 675,000. Ill dm my account details.
962776876728143872 2018-02-11 19:54:29 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @DexterAlmighty9 @ydnhkrm 750,000 will do. Thanks in advance.
962776115449393158 2018-02-11 19:51:28 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @DexterAlmighty9 @ydnhkrm Have we?

962773826194026497 2018-02-11 19:42:22 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> If everyone knew in June 2016 what we know now and could see the complexities and needlessness of #Brexit remain would have won by a mile.

958973977959026688 2018-02-01 08:03:07 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Having said that Ive never believed brexit will actually happen and with every week that passes this belief grows stronger. Its utter lunacy.
958973617534132224 2018-02-01 08:01:41 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Im amazed at how weak and malleable Theresa May is under the influence of the hard Brexiteers in her party. It is pathetic.

955856354568175617 2018-01-23 17:34:48 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @tony_nog Its funny how many staunch labour supporters have so easily moved on from an illegal war in Iraq the justification of which was a bare faced lie.

953544807485452288 2018-01-17 08:29:32 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Trump and Brexit are different sides of the same coin. The lies and propaganda have to be maintained otherwise both will fall apart. Everything about them is fictitious bullshit.

952949871505494017 2018-01-15 17:05:28 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Talking Heads are providing the soundtrack to 2018 so far.

952492514791034881 2018-01-14 10:48:06 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> This whole Brexit and Trump thing wears you down. Id like some sanity back to Western politics.
952474164685877249 2018-01-14 09:35:11 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Brandon Lewis MP agrees on #marr re. the credit card charge that we do in fact have control of our laws and we DO play a large part in making those decisions in the European Union. #brexit
952235238683496450 2018-01-13 17:45:47 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> So apparently Trump is a decent and misunderstood individual who means the best.

952203092682002432 2018-01-13 15:38:03 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @ltapoll @Portosj81 @MelRoseCov @sensegonewild @goudie_will Nope.

952190615327997953 2018-01-13 14:48:28 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @ltapoll @Portosj81 @MelRoseCov @sensegonewild And you think saying that is good diplomacy? I suppose you dont think hes a mysoginist too. And I suppose you think hes an intelligent busines man. He wont be president by the end of the year.
952187387425296385 2018-01-13 14:35:38 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @ltapoll @Portosj81 @sensegonewild @MelRoseCov I was talking about race. Trump called those place a shithole because they are poor and he is a raving racist. If you think hes fit to be pres your are astoundingly deluded.

951404969835614208 2018-01-11 10:46:35 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Theresa May claims the Tories are a Green Party ignoring the fact that #Brexit will lead to more shipping containers & airplanes travelling around the world to make up for the loss of trade with our European neighbours.
951394405650522112 2018-01-11 10:04:37 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @BrexitBin What is it about 52%? 
951393759786389505 2018-01-11 10:02:03 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> After last Junes election I got a lot of shit for suggesting Corbyn would disappoint a lot of Labour voters because of his Brexit position.
951368383114760192 2018-01-11 08:21:12 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> I hate Brexit.

950821911218589696 2018-01-09 20:09:43 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @Morris_Oxford Prosecco is always horrible
950817452220407815 2018-01-09 19:52:00 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Quick heart news: after a year of new meds my heart is coping better 
950784705707872256 2018-01-09 17:41:53 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Its quite something that none of Theresa Mays ministers seem fit for the job. Hopefully these are the death throes of the party.
950650091714568192 2018-01-09 08:46:58 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @abcpoppins Vote Lib Dem?
950649930724663296 2018-01-09 08:46:20 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @alexpiletska Or hes playing the long game. No, hes a brexiteer. As simple as that. McDonnell too.
950649460568227840 2018-01-09 08:44:28 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @mrjamesob Unfucking believable.
950648694881312768 2018-01-09 08:41:25 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @DanielJHannan Well, being entirely incompetent hasnt stopped Theresa May being PM. 
950646165158100992 2018-01-09 08:31:22 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @alexpiletska I thought thats what she had been doing.
950645655516704771 2018-01-09 08:29:21 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> This is mind boggling. This government are are beyond parody.https://twitter.com/davidallengreen/status/950637648720343040
950643217057370113 2018-01-09 08:19:39 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> So Toby Young has quit. Was bound to happen. And its not about being PC. Young was offensive and awful. Theresa Mays lack of judgement shines again. What an appalling PM she is.

950281647445958656 2018-01-08 08:22:54 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @Biltawulf Delicious stuff
950082989177954304 2018-01-07 19:13:30 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Nigel Farage is just another racist, xenophobic, ignorant tool who has helped ruin the country. Ignore.https://twitter.com/nigel_farage/status/928730704510320640

949943144413581312 2018-01-07 09:57:49 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> This government is so appallingly bad it wouldn't surprise me if this is the last Tory government we see. Words can't describe how inept it is.
949691715719450630 2018-01-06 17:18:44 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> The government is almost as bat shit crazy as Trump. Brexit and Trump are different sides of the same coin.
949690865966047237 2018-01-06 17:15:21 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Id love yo vote for a Labour Party that was categorically anti-brexit. Brexit is the opposite of what Labour stands for. Christ Corbyn is shit.
949690218214457349 2018-01-06 17:12:47 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @Blackro12653624 What is hope? Ive forgotten.

949603530255593472 2018-01-06 11:28:19 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @RebetikoWalrus I cant believe how ineffective labour are as opposition. This is the shittest, most inept government the uk has had. Labour should be smashing them.
949601902429339648 2018-01-06 11:21:50 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> That #retain thing is bullshit.
949599928434790400 2018-01-06 11:14:00 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> People who are blas about #Brexit and say whats done is done probably voted Leave and are now feeling a bit embarrassed about it. Either that or theyre a bit ignorant.
949298850791149568 2018-01-05 15:17:37 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> If a political party doesnt oppose #brexit quite frankly that party can go fuck themselves.
949298140351516673 2018-01-05 15:14:48 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Therell be an election soon and no one will vote for a party that doesnt directly oppose #brexit.
949220197596004353 2018-01-05 10:05:05 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> This fucking country.
949085374369992704 2018-01-04 01:09:21 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> #Brexit has been disintegrating since Mays Lancaster House speech where she tied her hands in front of the country. Were not going to get through 2018 without a 2nd ref getting put on the table.
948615374815285249 2018-01-03 18:01:44 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> And the opposition is nowhere
948615238596943872 2018-01-03 18:01:11 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> This government has passed from the absurd into downright ridiculous, offensive farce.
948614828645601286 2018-01-03 17:59:34 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Says a man who, had this country had any political integrity left, would have been sacked months ago...https://twitter.com/borisjohnson/status/948469085557411841
948613696116404225 2018-01-03 17:55:04 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Its an appalling appointment. Cronyism at its worst.
948613435893473281 2018-01-03 17:54:02 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Not long for the toad meister now
948449484937269248 2018-01-02 07:02:33 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Has Toby Young quit yet?
948249964798529538 2018-01-02 17:49:43 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> You get the sense Toby Young is going to be standing down fairly soon.
947894557081030656 2018-01-01 18:17:28 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Everything Brexiteers say is drenched with doubt.https://twitter.com/douglascarswell/status/947799161910562816

947851208802398208 2018-01-01 15:25:13 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @mpollaud @IsolatedBrit @_Loggerheads @hamptonbaglady The last eighteen months suggests otherwise.

947493185370185728 2017-12-31 15:42:33 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Owen Jones criticises Adonis who has made perhaps the most openly scathing criticism against Mays Brexit because he is successful???
947490747594485760 2017-12-31 15:32:52 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @BrexitBin and Trump will resign/be impeached 
947489091763032069 2017-12-31 15:26:17 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> I have no faith or trust in any politician that isnt trying to stop #brexit. Theres no long game & theres no strategy. #brexit is fanatical, nationalist bullshit and it needs to be stopped. #StopBrexit #FBPE
947484832577261568 2017-12-31 15:09:22 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @re_Claire That looks perfect
947480871338172417 2017-12-31 14:53:37 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> The only hope left in politics that can be taken into 2018 is that #brexit is falling apart. There is no hope being offered elsewhere.
947434644768686081 2017-12-31 11:49:56 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @CharmlessNurk I think HOME does one. Although its still central. This tweet hasnt been of much use has it.
947177250197295104 2017-12-30 18:47:08 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @LordAshcroft Maybe thats just how the public feel now?
947126111124762625 2017-12-30 15:23:56 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @oldiesclub @lostownos @sumarumi I work though and I rent. So it will be alone all day :(

947086944256872449 2017-12-30 12:48:18 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @andrew_lilico It is true.
947073429819322368 2017-12-30 11:54:36 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @lostownos I want to. I really do but I get dragged into it somehow.
947073038713020416 2017-12-30 11:53:02 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Retweet if youre doing something for #NewYearsEve because you feel obliged to, not because you want to 
946812559755182080 2017-12-29 18:37:59 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @DexterAlmighty9 @JohnWickObertan Ill be quitting my job this year. I can feel it.

945974784977965056 2017-12-27 11:08:58 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> If the collective reaction to #brexit is to shrug and not really be bothered about it we are doomed.
945968546387058689 2017-12-27 10:44:11 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> This is the crux of it. People mourn the loss of the centre ground but wont vote for it.

945622030837219329 2017-12-26 11:47:15 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @TC_Cornesto @Adam_Leedham If no one voted for the Lib Dems how can they? Labour are assisting Tory brexit. Labour could fill the middle but theyre not.
945620019379044353 2017-12-26 11:39:16 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @TC_Cornesto @Adam_Leedham Thats deflecting the failings of Labour & Tories onto the failings of Lib Dem. I wish the Lib dems would sort themselves out too.
945618202394021888 2017-12-26 11:32:02 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @TC_Cornesto @Adam_Leedham But their lack of credibility isnt responsible for the fuckwittery of Labour and Tories? Lib Dems arent responsible for that? If theres a void in the middle why havent they filled it??
945616419634507777 2017-12-26 11:24:57 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @Adam_Leedham No sure how Nick Clegg is responsible for the actions of Labour and Tories but okay.

945603444186013696 2017-12-26 10:33:24 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @Adam_Leedham Yes, thats why they go against their promises. Because they have to. As shit as it may be thats politics innit.
945602178760282112 2017-12-26 10:28:22 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @Adam_Leedham Yes, he did. And his party has paid for it. But as an individual he shows far more honesty than any current leader. And hes more deserving of a knighthood than that racist brexiteer.
945600768593285120 2017-12-26 10:22:46 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @Adam_Leedham He was.
945600522127659008 2017-12-26 10:21:47 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @Adam_Leedham Yes but he admitted he failed here. Hes vocal about what he believes. He doesnt hide behind a veil of vagueness like some leaders do.
945599127009808384 2017-12-26 10:16:14 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @perrigame Sorry, Perri  Hope youre having a nice one 
945598938660392960 2017-12-26 10:15:30 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> And Farage being snubbed a knighthood and Clegg receiving one is frankly a hilarious and justified comedy end to an otherwise politically awful 2017. #brexit #trump
945598594702290944 2017-12-26 10:14:08 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> People dont like Clegg because he admittedly caved in on tuition fees but hes one of the few politicians with genuine integrity who stands up for what he believes in. Also hes fiercely opposed to #brexit.

939795766742315010 2017-12-10 09:55:46 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Davis remains deluded about what #brexit means. He knows it is impracticable. He's still spitting out the sound bytes. He's trying to kid himself and leave voters that we are out of the EU yet we are still intrinsically attached to it. And always will be. #marr

939790458057879552 2017-12-10 09:34:40 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Yet labour still play along with this fulfilling the wishes of the people nonsense. It's obviously a complete waste of time. #brexit #marr

934143774753742849 2017-11-24 19:36:46 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> My bloods are fine. My kidneys (and liver) have returned to normal. I have renewed the prescription. I can stay on these amazing hope-fuelling drugs.pic.twitter.com/hnXPv1CNw7
934143296846356481 2017-11-24 19:34:52 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Today I had the follow up. Ive been tense this last few weeks. Spiralling into that familiar sinking despair. Tired and pissy at everyone. Again
934143033674817536 2017-11-24 19:33:49 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> So I went for a blood test on Monday just to check my kidneys again. Hopefully the function would plateau. While these meds were smashing my kidneys hopefully theyd retain enough function.
934142767592337409 2017-11-24 19:32:45 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> I was gutted. This good news that medication can trea and improve my heart was being shat on.
934142572590718976 2017-11-24 19:31:59 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> In a healthy person the number is 60 to 90. They then discussed dropping the dosage of this new amazing drug that is helping my heart
934141001622589440 2017-11-24 19:25:44 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Two weeks ago I was told it had dropped by ~40. I think its a percentage. Im not sure. Anyway it was now 59.
934140725889044480 2017-11-24 19:24:39 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> But two weeks ago I went to the fortnightly check up at the hospital. Before I started these pills my kidney function was 90+. Excellent condition.
934140444916830208 2017-11-24 19:23:32 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Its all good. The pills make me terribly tired, they wreck my stomach, make my legs feel heavy and tired. But they are helping my heart function.
934140058461974529 2017-11-24 19:22:00 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Anyway these pills help my heart function despite the damage done during a previous op. Scarring and things and I need to have my bloods monitored.
934139859983269888 2017-11-24 19:21:12 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Or some other serious treatment, more open heart or something.
934139706731835394 2017-11-24 19:20:36 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> They put me on a new pill which everyone in the heart failure treatment world are very excited about. It was amazing because I was fearing Id need a transplant.
934139426086752256 2017-11-24 19:19:29 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> It ended with me feeling hopeful about the future. Something I havent felt for a good few years.
934138990718013440 2017-11-24 19:17:45 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> In July I posted a slightly indulgent blog about my heart problems. It ended (uncharacteristically) on an optimistic note:https://phildjw.wordpress.com/2017/07/22/every-stopped-machine/
934136138914287616 2017-11-24 19:06:25 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @sumarumi Melba roast is thin, isnt it?

934116183367933953 2017-11-24 17:47:07 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @achknalligewelt Saving face for the sake of the party and not for the good of the country. I was giving them the benefit of the doubt. Its really disappointing. Corbyn is a full on Brexiteer.
934115016835551232 2017-11-24 17:42:29 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @achknalligewelt I dont. If they were going to do the right thing they would have called time on brexit altogether. I hoped they would.
934114579197628416 2017-11-24 17:40:45 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> I hate twitter at times like this.

931440470672232449 2017-11-17 08:34:48 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> #Brexit is an uncaring, thoughtless and stupid way forward.

931289482279706636 2017-11-16 22:34:49 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> David Davis. Wanker extraordinaire.
931288334881705984 2017-11-16 22:30:16 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @UKLabour @acgrayling @damocrat Still with the idea that their brexit will put jobs and the economy first. As delusional as Davis.

930795556124884993 2017-11-15 13:52:08 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Still waiting for a coherent argument explaining what the benefits of #brexit will be.
930703111840296960 2017-11-14 07:44:48 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Its funny how #brexit and the #Leave vote was enhanced by Russia. Its funny. Russia won #brexit.

930513594768293888 2017-11-14 19:11:43 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> How naive of #Brexit supporters to think Russia meddled in every election in the west except those in the UK. Putin wanted brexit so badly. Of course they interfered. #BrexitRussia
930510370845978624 2017-11-14 18:58:55 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @darrengrimes_ @Pictureme1825 @Sillyshib @rfctabs Nice reaction to a perfectly reasonable question. Ill translate your answer: there arent any.

930493876300861441 2017-11-14 17:53:22 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Ken Clarke. More backbone than any other Tory mp and all of the labour MPs too cowardly to stand up for #Remain . #brexit
930488322732036107 2017-11-14 17:31:18 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> So #brexit is the easiest negotiation ever and is going swimmingly well because the EU neeeeeeeds us so badly. #brexitcrisishttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-sufficient-progress-trade-talks-angela-merkel-ally-manfred-weber-a8054841.html

930348315421564928 2017-11-14 08:14:58 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Both @jeremycorbyn and @theresa_may are an absolute shambles. Leading the country to ruin over out dated ideologies.  #brexit is dereliction of duty.
930347727921270784 2017-11-14 08:12:38 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Imagine if every Remain voting mp had the guts to stand up for what they knew to be right. But no. They all did what @jeremycorbyn and @theresa_may  told them to do & voted for Article 50. Cowards. All of them. #brexit #BrexitCrisis #Brexitvote
930200047127588864 2017-11-13 22:25:48 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @zemblamatic @Slouloulou @capnbobfrapples I write a blog and I havent killed anyone.

930196541297618944 2017-11-13 22:11:52 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Theyve allowed this to happen because theyre more worried about their position in their fucking parties.
930196312888406018 2017-11-13 22:10:57 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Every single MP that voted to trigger Article 50 is responsible for this disaster. Every single one of them. #brexit

930144210472325120 2017-11-13 18:43:55 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @achknalligewelt I still hope it wont happen. Eventually sense will prevail.
930142940881653761 2017-11-13 18:38:52 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @achknalligewelt Well if they do then well point at the Leave voters until we rejoin with shengen and the Euro.
930141362154033153 2017-11-13 18:32:36 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Thats a HUGE concession! If parliament has anything about it it will chuck #brexit into the bin when it comes to that parliamentary vote.
930130966311469056 2017-11-13 17:51:18 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @handsblinx @re_Claire Thats pretty amazing. It calms me.

929686131893039104 2017-11-12 12:23:41 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> This is what twitter was made for.
929684411364397061 2017-11-12 12:16:51 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> But people are idiots. 
929684298474586112 2017-11-12 12:16:24 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Listen to this. People really, really, really should stop feeding the gutter press like the Daily Mail and other tabloids.https://twitter.com/lbc/status/928889852199866368
929682449260535808 2017-11-12 12:09:03 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Just thinking how much Id miss you lot if twitter stopped or something.

929421372866088961 2017-11-11 18:51:37 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @CharmlessNurk He writes for the gutter press. Or he used to. Hes touchy about that too.
929420569593958403 2017-11-11 18:48:26 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @CharmlessNurk I havent yet recovered. Ive heard he provides prime content.
929419879152783366 2017-11-11 18:45:41 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @CharmlessNurk Hes blocked me too. He seems to fall out with a lot of people here.
929414555117252608 2017-11-11 18:24:32 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @Slouloulou @Morris_Oxford Hes blocked me. I think hes a cunt.

929018036488671233 2017-11-10 16:08:54 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Doubt. #brexit and #Brexiteers are full of doubt and this Lord Kerr intervention has exposed it.  #BrexitReality #BrexitCrisis #ukip #LeaveEU 
929013962242486273 2017-11-10 15:52:43 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @BBCNews I think @bbcnews has an actor on and its not working very well.
929013630158426112 2017-11-10 15:51:24 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @mrjamesob @LBC @grahamnaylor201 Think they have. The government just refuse to see it.
928962723806961664 2017-11-10 12:29:07 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @Yahoo I've had to change my e-mail address on EVERYTHING because quite frankly @yahoo 's forgotten password process is rubbish.

928933441789407233 2017-11-10 10:32:45 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> I never imagined the United Kingdom would have as poor and weak a PM as Theresa May.
928921265112604673 2017-11-10 09:44:22 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @Open_Britain @ChukaUmunna Hard brexiteers like Corbyn. Do something!
928918398859468801 2017-11-10 09:32:59 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> All but one Conservative MP voted to trigger #Article50 . I don't know who the tory rebels are. They've all had a part in wrecking the UK. #brexit
928897949609971713 2017-11-10 08:11:43 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> If this Lord Kerr intervention is making headline news then maybe things are turning? #brexit is dissolving  #article50

928770770351853568 2017-11-09 23:46:22 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @re_Claire These new pills make me Trump excessively and frequently. Might be stress related too. 
928761894084673536 2017-11-09 23:11:05 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> There are more people I recognise from the twitter appearing on Facebook than people I recognise from actual real life.
928759917254774784 2017-11-09 23:03:14 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Stay in the EU then you gigantic nest of bellends.https://twitter.com/brexit/status/928759546453118976
928341750082662401 2017-11-08 19:21:35 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> If #Patel has quit because she caused a distraction for the government #Johnson should have gone months ago?!

928315962507644928 2017-11-08 17:39:07 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Whispers:  *(you dont need to use all 280 characters.)*
928315430904778753 2017-11-08 17:37:00 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @DanielJHannan Its Brexit. Given that you seem to be wrong about everything else youre probably wrong here too.

928179992835624960 2017-11-08 08:38:49 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> I really wish Brexiteers Corbyn and McDonnell would go away.
928179823633162240 2017-11-08 08:38:09 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> We lost a huge amount of work yesterday. Things are creeping to a halt. #brexit
928179585820356608 2017-11-08 08:37:12 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @SamHowroyd @achknalligewelt @dexteralmighty Not if someone is under the presumption you want to draw them when you dont.
928178441874264064 2017-11-08 08:32:39 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @campbellclaret Becoming?
928178316128980992 2017-11-08 08:32:09 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @SamHowroyd @achknalligewelt @dexteralmighty They held no value in that sense either. Sadly.
928178165180239872 2017-11-08 08:31:33 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @SamHowroyd @dexteralmighty @achknalligewelt Just to clarify, this wasnt Mrk.
928177992865521664 2017-11-08 08:30:52 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @SamHowroyd @achknalligewelt @dexteralmighty They were neither really. She loved herself a bit. I just deleted them.
928177811600363520 2017-11-08 08:30:09 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @realDonaldTrump @capnbobfrapples Is he dead? 
928177700434599936 2017-11-08 08:29:43 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> @SamHowroyd @dexteralmighty @achknalligewelt Someone sent me nudes once under the assumption Id draw them. I didnt draw them.
928177153161736197 2017-11-08 08:27:32 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> So @Nigel_Farage pays less tax than people from other countries who have made Britain their home. What a shock. What a despicable prick he is. What a hypocrite. Hes contributed less than any migrant. Christ, hes a #cunt. #brexit #ukip #brexitisdead #stopbrexit
928176506269990912 2017-11-08 08:24:58 UTC <Bo0_Radley_> Just checking.
