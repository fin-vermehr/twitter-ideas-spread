967656482467532800 2018-02-24 07:04:18 UTC <heWIZARD> Other than race, the key difference is that Vulture has a family and business to protect, while Killmonger has nothing to lose. The distinction makes Vulture a capitalist... and Killmonger scarier.
967655929951891456 2018-02-24 07:02:06 UTC <heWIZARD> BLACK PANTHER thoughts and therefore spoilers:  Vulture (of SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING) and Killmonger have the same philosophies and plans -- put the hidden weapons of heroes into the hands of the oppressed and in need -- but Killmonger's are global in scale.

967269259775696896 2018-02-23 05:25:37 UTC <heWIZARD> @motownphenom11 Eh. Hindsight is always 20/20 in the draft. Kennard is going to be a good pro. That decision is bad mostly because of the need for a backup PG, not because of how good Mitchell has been.
967259663128453120 2018-02-23 04:47:29 UTC <heWIZARD> @brgulker @DuncanSmithNBA So... angry...
967258979515551745 2018-02-23 04:44:46 UTC <heWIZARD> @brgulker The irony is if they don't make the playoffs now he's almost sure to lose it. At least in the no trade version he could have pointed to the Jackson injury.
967258399535595520 2018-02-23 04:42:27 UTC <heWIZARD> @brgulker It's really insane. He basically mortgaged the franchise based on a 20-game stretch without a point guard.
967256052117811202 2018-02-23 04:33:08 UTC <heWIZARD> @GreatDismal The false fear of appearing partisan. Journalists feel the pull of "objectivity" no matter how extreme the right goes.
967252525861621760 2018-02-23 04:19:07 UTC <heWIZARD> You have a phenomenal start, regress to the mean slightly, lose your starting point guard, overcorrect with a panic trade for a volume scorer who is not a point guard, maybe doesn't fit with your best player, and gobbles your cap for the next 4 years.

966387333925781504 2018-02-21 19:01:09 UTC <heWIZARD> Hilarious that the Midwest and East Coast are doing backflips about it being warmer there than in LA while everyone in LA is like "THANK GOD HOODIE WEATHER."
966362061683871744 2018-02-21 17:20:44 UTC <heWIZARD> My amazon competitor would be called Cart Blanche because you'd be able to buy whatever you want.
966210653211021317 2018-02-20 07:19:05 UTC <heWIZARD> Made a Gollum typo, but I'll allow it on account of Andy Serkis is in this movie.
966210392027525121 2018-02-20 07:18:03 UTC <heWIZARD> Which is all to say that if your analysis is "Well, character A represents this, and character B represents that, and therefore the movie is obviously taking the side of character A!" I guarantee you've thought about it a lot less than the writer.
966210033531924481 2018-02-20 07:16:37 UTC <heWIZARD> Mostly we're trying to make compelling, complicated characters who have to go through some shit. They hold firm beliefs because they helps us create conflict and butt up against one another, and they contradict those beliefs because monolithic archetypes are BORING.
966209609332609025 2018-02-20 07:14:56 UTC <heWIZARD> I've been delving into the BLACK PANTHER discourse, and I'll just say this: Thinking about what a character "represents" (historically, allegorically, psychologically, etc) is only ONE way that writers think about characters.
966102623668518913 2018-02-20 00:09:49 UTC <heWIZARD> @TheBlackNerd Man, this comparison chaps my ass.

966043779613339648 2018-02-20 20:15:59 UTC <heWIZARD> Yesterday, sheWizard was trying to tell me about a celebrity she saw -- whose name she couldn't remember -- by comparing him to the lead singer of a band I knew -- whose name she couldn't remember. The answers turned out to be Giovanni Ribisi and Green Day.
966031276728709122 2018-02-20 19:26:19 UTC <heWIZARD> We already have occupational peacekeepers who are supposed to be the community good guys with guns, and we all see how that's working out. Even with training and the right job description, putting guns in people's hands means innocent people get killed.
966009518147624960 2018-02-20 17:59:51 UTC <heWIZARD> @NEwertKrocker *raises hand* Will the duality of the machine/human, savior/antichrist as seen through the lens of an anime-like technofuture be on the final?
966007278275936256 2018-02-20 17:50:57 UTC <heWIZARD> @NEwertKrocker Well, Nate, what if it was a... Gun-dam? You'll notice the Japanese don't have any school shootings.
966006778948300800 2018-02-20 17:48:58 UTC <heWIZARD> The point is, teachers are real humans with their own physical, mental, and emotional hard ships, just trying to keep it together like the rest of us. Expecting them to also be a trained infantry is not only ridiculous, but dangerous.
966005416999116800 2018-02-20 17:43:33 UTC <heWIZARD> In 11th grade, I had a Japanese teacher in her third trimester of pregnancy. I wonder how she would have been with a gun.
966005023342604291 2018-02-20 17:41:59 UTC <heWIZARD> In 10th grade, I had a geometry teacher with Parkinson's Disease. I wonder how he would have been with a gun.
966004917637824512 2018-02-20 17:41:34 UTC <heWIZARD> In 8th grade, a science teacher threw a chair across a classroom at a student. He was reassigned to physical education. I wonder how he would have been with a gun.
966004783352922112 2018-02-20 17:41:02 UTC <heWIZARD> In 8th grade, I had an obese math teacher who returned to work after gastric bypass surgery. I wonder how she would have been with a gun.

965796223562084352 2018-02-19 03:52:17 UTC <heWIZARD> This movie will live inside my brain and soul for years. I can't imagine being a 10-year-old Black child and seeing that movie. It'll influence generations.

965095215307489280 2018-02-17 05:26:44 UTC <heWIZARD> Collusion is beside the fucking point. Look wherever you want, there's an abuse of power, a shattering of a political more, a fleecing of American citizens, a denigration of the disenfranchised, and an impeachable offense. Let's start there.

963487648173010946 2018-02-13 18:58:50 UTC <heWIZARD> Imagine supporting a President in the midst of upending every norm essential to maintaining democracy but also thinking that leaves in a Presidential portrait is going too far.
963483523448414208 2018-02-13 18:42:27 UTC <heWIZARD> @Shinons8 I mean, if doing something terrifying is a measure of athleticism, then sky diving and freediving should also be Olympic events.
963476790239838208 2018-02-13 18:15:41 UTC <heWIZARD> Most of the events involve sliding downhill on an ice-slicked incline. Not sure the luge should be worth as much as the marathon, is all I'm sayin'.

963131727248998401 2018-02-12 19:24:32 UTC <heWIZARD> What sucks about game narrative writer openings in LA is that there's never any shortage of screenwriters looking for work.

963106289852203008 2018-02-12 17:43:27 UTC <heWIZARD> The First Lady Obama portrait kinda bums me out. It looks like a painting of a dress with its model gray-scaled into the background. Doesn't reflect the vibrancy and energy of Michelle, in my opinion.
963104915965952000 2018-02-12 17:38:00 UTC <heWIZARD> @ShaneWatch Nothing about this looks like Monsters, Inc.

962119336625242113 2018-02-09 00:21:39 UTC <heWIZARD> The downside of Pistons getting national attention: The game is blacked out. Someone call me and describe what's happening.
962117947710820352 2018-02-09 00:16:08 UTC <heWIZARD> @JeffLieber What's the best approach for a mini-series? Is it worth it to write a "pilot"? Seems like the only alternatives are "only" a bible, or writing the whole thing.

961849826580217858 2018-02-08 06:30:43 UTC <heWIZARD> @Rossalincoln Definitely stayed in that house. Bonus points if you can find the pool table.
961837429203218438 2018-02-08 05:41:27 UTC <heWIZARD> @NEwertKrocker We binged season 1 of The Good Place this week. In addition to sheer joy -- half-hour episodes!
961837172851527682 2018-02-08 05:40:26 UTC <heWIZARD> BEHOLD! The power of racism.
961836985672335361 2018-02-08 05:39:42 UTC <heWIZARD> Republicans jam through a $1.5 trillion tax cut for the wealthy.  They now want to raise the debt ceiling to $1 trillion because there isn't enough money in government.  Paul Ryan wants to cut Medicare and Medicaid.  It's incredible that any non-billionaires vote Republican.
961834918119550978 2018-02-08 05:31:29 UTC <heWIZARD> @Rossalincoln Dude, are you at Lake Arrowhead? Pretty sure we rented this exact house in November.
961797534829002757 2018-02-08 03:02:56 UTC <heWIZARD> @NEwertKrocker There is never any time and video games are always the first cut.
961736462193459200 2018-02-08 23:00:15 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically I actually think this is true for Japanese games on the whole. Nintendo survives it because their weirdness simply remained weird, but a lot of other stuff (dialogue and voice acting, any one?) relied on that extra degree of separation.

961688567297658880 2018-02-08 19:49:56 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut Agreed. Also really hard to make that point with Marvel given 2017 might have been its best year in sheer quality.
961687987338690561 2018-02-08 19:47:38 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut You have to admit the fact that there are currently 8 upcoming / announced Star Wars movies NOT INCLUDING whatever the next stand-alone might be is pretty exhausting. Just, like... at least have the dignity to develop in silence.
961681317581660160 2018-02-08 19:21:07 UTC <heWIZARD> Republicans perpetuate the idea that taxes are a waste of your money while governing in a way that ensures they are. Happy Thursday!

960985718876078080 2018-02-06 21:17:04 UTC <heWIZARD> Weiss and Benioff writing Star Wars is great news in a vacuum. But we now have 8 Star Wars movies announced including SOLO. I'm so tired.
960982736591732736 2018-02-06 21:05:13 UTC <heWIZARD> Fairly certain that Episode IX will be the last time I see a Star Wars in the theater.

960032348032008192 2018-02-03 06:08:42 UTC <heWIZARD> @DuncanSmithNBA Honestly I think only two from a list of Ish, Stanley, Blake, and Dre should ever play in the same lineup. Hope SVG's not getting the wrong idea.
960030345386123264 2018-02-03 06:00:45 UTC <heWIZARD> @DuncanSmithNBA Given only one of those guys is a reliable threat from outside, this feels both shocking and unsustainable.

959534819796336640 2018-02-02 21:11:42 UTC <heWIZARD> @philhornshaw I mean, they did raise us in those tight economic times, the 90s.

958865616831574016 2018-01-31 00:52:32 UTC <heWIZARD> Got paid this morning and within an hour spent the entire check at the vet. At least the results were inconclusive!
958829024037318656 2018-01-31 22:27:08 UTC <heWIZARD> @thom_not_tom @detroitbadboys Agreement.
958828249626243072 2018-01-31 22:24:03 UTC <heWIZARD> @thom_not_tom @detroitbadboys It's also become clear at this point that SVG's philosophy is to presume stars won't come here. He wants to trade up into better and better players that are then stuck with us. All the rest of it (like, ya know, cap space) seems secondary to him.

958142350919782400 2018-01-29 00:58:32 UTC <heWIZARD> Blake is much older than Tobias, a demonstrably worse outside shooter than Tobias, AND likes to operate in the high post, where Dre has achieved career numbers this season. Nevermind swapping a cheap deal for an expensive one.
958140748553117697 2018-01-29 00:52:10 UTC <heWIZARD> BREAKING NEWS: The trade is bad.
958087117694906368 2018-01-29 21:19:03 UTC <heWIZARD> Any way, I think there's a non-zero chance that Trump's entire State of the Union is about his dick.

956978049806839808 2018-01-26 19:52:01 UTC <heWIZARD> @Mattgina Absolutely. I know they sent screeners out anyway, so it can still work in the traditional voting process. It just doesn't feel like "part of the zeitgeist" like a lot of the Best Picture noms have been.
956944659602841600 2018-01-26 17:39:20 UTC <heWIZARD> Netflix continues to be a weird place for quote unquote prestige films. On one hand, it's amazing that it exists. On the other hand, I have to believe if it had been released theatrically, everyone would be talking about it.

955136196283265024 2018-01-21 17:53:09 UTC <heWIZARD> Never put together before that the refrain at the end of Taking Back Sunday's "Head Case" ("Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving") is a Johnny Cash reference.
954940565195378689 2018-01-20 04:55:47 UTC <heWIZARD> The very weakest criticism of Trump is that he's a draft dodger. The draft was bullshit.

954418985633685504 2018-01-19 18:23:13 UTC <heWIZARD> @Shinons8 @brgulker @lazchance Sure. He's free to hover around the fringes of the rotation until his deal runs out.
954418104037027845 2018-01-19 18:19:42 UTC <heWIZARD> @lazchance @Shinons8 @brgulker As long as we're committed to building around Drummond, Stanley is a bad fit. He'll likely thrive elsewhere, but it won't be because we "gave up too soon."
954417937477021696 2018-01-19 18:19:03 UTC <heWIZARD> @lazchance @Shinons8 @brgulker Here's the thing: It's not whether or not he'll be good, it's about whether or not he can be good on this team. We love him because he probably would have been great in the Going To Work Era. But in today's NBA, you can't have 2 players who can't shoot.

954051019511496708 2018-01-18 18:01:03 UTC <heWIZARD> Regardless of whether or not Nassar's crimes are her "fault," one of the roles of a university president is to lead in times of crisis and to shepherd the image of her institution. In that regard, Lou Anna K Simon has failed spectacularly. It's time for her to go.
954050964528377856 2018-01-18 18:00:50 UTC <heWIZARD> If Simon knew about Nassar, she enabled abuse. If she didn't know about Nassar, she's an incompetent leader.

953738146847617025 2018-01-17 21:17:48 UTC <heWIZARD> Remember how Han and Leia named their son after a guy Leia had never met and Han knew for like six hours?

953478797872963584 2018-01-16 04:07:14 UTC <heWIZARD> @philhornshaw CUT TO: 10 years later. Han is in some hot water with a group of barterers he's scammed. Now it's Chewie -- who has grown the size of a Wookiee! -- who steps in to save Han. The rest, as they say, happened a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.
953478372817907713 2018-01-16 04:05:33 UTC <heWIZARD> @philhornshaw The movie opens on a young, hairy boy being bullied on the playground. After being pushed into Bantha poodoo, a young boy in a vest helps Chewbacca up. Offers him his best toy blaster.
953467611777441792 2018-01-16 03:22:47 UTC <heWIZARD> @joestarr187 Wow, hard disagree here. He's way too uppity and brash for the character. One of the weak castings in the series, imho.

949856150832398336 2018-01-06 04:12:08 UTC <heWIZARD> @philhornshaw Also, now I'm having trouble finding it, but the other day there was an article (maybe from F&F) in which Trump had pondered to staffers, "Why can't Medicare work for everyone?"
949855933953273856 2018-01-06 04:11:16 UTC <heWIZARD> @philhornshaw That's true, though in all the ways they called Obama arrogant and aloof, Trump is somehow a "man of the people."

949715944149942272 2018-01-06 18:55:00 UTC <heWIZARD> I seem to recall a story during the election that Trump didn't actually compose his tweets, he just dictated / yelled at a secretary who would type it in for him.  Including things like, ", like," has to be subtle retribution.

949489727542996992 2018-01-05 03:56:06 UTC <heWIZARD> Do the Pistons have the biggest gap between their ceiling and floor for this season? They could make the Eastern Conference Finals, or miss the playoffs and clean house. Nothing would shock me at this point. @detroitbadboys

949134636138942464 2018-01-04 04:25:05 UTC <heWIZARD> @brockwilbur Oh so now I couldn't have made Rez? Jeez, man, really digging a hole here.
949133224864768000 2018-01-04 04:19:29 UTC <heWIZARD> @brockwilbur Rez? Truthfully, I have nothing to do with the game. I just covered its creator and fascinating history for the vinyl book.  THAT SAID, it is quite a trip. The new stuff is true escapism.

943951198993993729 2017-12-21 21:07:58 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically Maybe, but that happens a lot in very negative reviews. The movie is a cowpie, what more is there to say but look at context and agonize over what it might mean.

943949286387175425 2017-12-21 21:00:22 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically Nah, like halfway through TFA they actually fire it. While Rey, Finn & Han are doing something completely unrelated at Maz's bar / planet. The end was about stopping it from firing... again.
943949038369599488 2017-12-21 20:59:23 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically I've said this a lot, but it was a huge missed opportunity to not invert the power structure for this trilogy. Making The Republic the "Man," and The First Order terrorists hiding out in old Rebel bases -- and even swapping good guy / bad guy ships! -- could have been great.
943948659959492608 2017-12-21 20:57:52 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically Yup. It's meant to have all happened in that one firing of the Starkiller Base, whose targets we had never seen. So much hinges on things that are never set up or explained.

943581578919215104 2017-12-20 20:39:13 UTC <heWIZARD> *to the tune of "Car Wash"*  Star Wars -- Talkin' bout the Star Wars, yeah
943568053228380160 2017-12-20 19:45:29 UTC <heWIZARD> Flying to Red State Michigan for Christmas and I when I get there I expect a palpable air of shame.
943311032985849857 2017-12-19 02:44:10 UTC <heWIZARD> @jowrotethis @princethomas No.
943272373322530816 2017-12-19 00:10:33 UTC <heWIZARD> @jowrotethis @Canucklehead613 And the beacon he allegedly sacrificed himself to get out didn't feel like an emotional reason, but a plot contrivance. When his whisked away I felt I'd missed something.
943272203172290561 2017-12-19 00:09:53 UTC <heWIZARD> @jowrotethis @Canucklehead613 I am quite sure the movie doesn't intend for it to be meaningless. I'm merely saying that when it happened, my reaction was, "Why?" The preceding scene teaches us that his astral projection renders him free from harm.
943226642939314176 2017-12-19 21:08:50 UTC <heWIZARD> @jowrotethis Likely, yes. I guess I just wanted the Luke we know to come back. And after the lows the movie puts him through, I just didn't feel his death was very... meaningful.
943223075322998784 2017-12-19 20:54:40 UTC <heWIZARD> @jowrotethis All of that only works for me if  it leads to the return of *that* Luke. And we never really get it. Even at the end, I thought, "Luke's back!" And then he flapped into the breeze. His relationship with Rey and his cowardly retreat are never really resolved.
943222216669372416 2017-12-19 20:51:15 UTC <heWIZARD> @jowrotethis And for the most part, I think TLJ did a great job with the hand it was dealt. I still don't buy that the Luke Skywalker we knew would just leave Ben to rise to power with the Dark Side, but Johnson took him to interesting places. That said...
943222002378096640 2017-12-19 20:50:24 UTC <heWIZARD> @jowrotethis For me it's another example of a bad set-up by TFA. One of many problems I had with that movie was the idea that Luke -- repeatedly selfless; who calmly walked toward certain death for the chance of saving the Galaxy and redeeming his father -- would run away in the first place.
943202658097049600 2017-12-19 19:33:32 UTC <heWIZARD> No matter how you feel about it, THE LAST JEDI is a big, juicy pop culture moment. There are things that work and things that don't. There's art in it. But instead of discussing any of that, everyone's having a SUCKS VS. RULES shouting match.
943202115328995328 2017-12-19 19:31:22 UTC <heWIZARD> I love that internet discourse pushes everything into two opposing extremes so fast that there's no longer a way to have a thoughtful discussion about anything.
942998939636084737 2017-12-18 06:04:01 UTC <heWIZARD> @manieldanning Arkham's Razor: The easiest way to escape is through the front door.
942997321561776128 2017-12-18 05:57:36 UTC <heWIZARD> @manieldanning Arkham's Razor: Which is the simpler conclusion -- that everyone in Arkham Asylum is crazy, or that the one man that put them there is?
942996364350259200 2017-12-18 05:53:47 UTC <heWIZARD> THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE.  What kind of cannon do I use to edit this tweet.
942996143163678720 2017-12-18 05:52:55 UTC <heWIZARD> *fin*
942996100541161473 2017-12-18 05:52:45 UTC <heWIZARD> Only, he's not *really* back. It's just a distraction while our new heroes escape the canon. And lo, they set off to build a new Galaxy...
942995624122662912 2017-12-18 05:50:51 UTC <heWIZARD> Finn is literally ready to sacrifice himself to destroy the canon. He doesn't, which is good because in the end, the canon doesn't really matter. Because Luke Skywalker is back!
942995128322363392 2017-12-18 05:48:53 UTC <heWIZARD> Their going to use that giant, heh hem, canon, to stop hope from spreading. To keep the Galaxy the way it's always been! And our new heroes -- in vehicles we've never seen before -- are going to destroy it.
942994829646053376 2017-12-18 05:47:42 UTC <heWIZARD> Our heroes are locked away -- the last hope for a Galaxy far, far away. Then the bad guys show up in their new-fangled but still classic AT-ATs with a... battering ram cannon. A battering ram... canon.
942994486723887104 2017-12-18 05:46:20 UTC <heWIZARD> Hey, I have one last #TheLastJedi hot take before I give myself convulsions: The final battle is a metaphor for the Disney takeover of Star Wars.
942967210657452033 2017-12-18 03:57:57 UTC <heWIZARD> Oh my god, people are still litigating Rey's"true" parents. When are you nerds gonna learn?
942936460965036033 2017-12-18 01:55:45 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut Yeah, that's partially why I haven't popped it in yet?  Also I agree that Guardians isn't particularly funny (except for the eyeball gag)... yet it works for me anyway.
942935603628318721 2017-12-18 01:52:21 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut I'm on the record for Spider-Man being my favorite, though I haven't seen Logan yet.  Thor was great, I just thought it was somewhat shallow. Valkyrie is really the only character that goes through anything internally meaningful.
942935237515808768 2017-12-18 01:50:54 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut Yeah, I agree. They're different beasts, even if Marvel took pains to bend the Thor universe toward Galaxy.
942927212210032641 2017-12-18 01:19:00 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically He's great. The whole "my long, lost father is actually a piece of shit" story has some, uh, personal resonance with me. But the fact that Nebula / Gamora, Drax / Mantis, Yondu / Rocket all get emotional arcs is impressive.
942926517096427520 2017-12-18 01:16:15 UTC <heWIZARD> I also, for the record, cried at the exact same spot.
942926318567489536 2017-12-18 01:15:27 UTC <heWIZARD> And this is coming from someone who didn't love the first one.
942926118088187904 2017-12-18 01:14:39 UTC <heWIZARD> I know everyone loved Thor 3, and I did, too, but the emotional depths of Guardians 2 took me by surprise.
942925919689236481 2017-12-18 01:13:52 UTC <heWIZARD> I put on Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 last night to re-watch a scene I couldn't remember and ended up watching the whole thing again.  I think it might be really good?
942624741902319616 2017-12-17 05:17:06 UTC <heWIZARD> Anyone else simply oscillating between working all the time and parenting the rest of the time without ever stopping? Not just me, right?
942450810557939712 2017-12-17 17:45:57 UTC <heWIZARD> There are a lot of deaths in THE LAST JEDI, and I think all of them work. Except one.
942246171585667073 2017-12-16 04:12:48 UTC <heWIZARD> Imagine saying, "THE LAST JEDI ruined Star Wars!" even though there hasn't been a good Star Wars movie since 1983.
942190445173530625 2017-12-16 00:31:21 UTC <heWIZARD> @brgulker Ha ha. @philhornshaw and I were talking/joking about exactly this earlier today.
942178050287869952 2017-12-16 23:42:06 UTC <heWIZARD> @garrettelliott That like on your tweet should represent whatever the opposite of a like is.

942106479984807936 2017-12-16 18:57:42 UTC <heWIZARD> Last night at the @iam8bit holiday party. @ Bar Bandini https://www.instagram.com/p/BcxiSHrHz6M/
942087703692062720 2017-12-16 17:43:06 UTC <heWIZARD> Gotta, say, guys, it's fun being mad about Star Wars this week instead of the deteriorating state of society itself.
942078136614756352 2017-12-16 17:05:05 UTC <heWIZARD> Imagine, if you will, the ability to reconcile both good things and bad things -- things that work and things that don't -- in a 2 and a half hour movie.
941905037952815104 2017-12-15 05:37:15 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically @FujoYoshi Yeah, I'm surprised by the reaction, honestly. I think it's much better than TFA. This movie just does it in different ways. Rather than soullessly aping plot points and structure, it's making explicit winks and references to specific details.
941904706338635777 2017-12-15 05:35:56 UTC <heWIZARD> @FujoYoshi @playcritically Ha ha. Well, I hate The Force Awakens, but you don't seem to like that. I once thanked that movie for giving me permission to not care about Star Wars any more, yet here we are.
941903823282487296 2017-12-15 05:32:25 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically @FujoYoshi I mean, yeah. Not really a criticism as much as an observation. I think it winks too much at Star Wars and the idea of Star Wars in a way the originals never felt the need to. That put a spotlight on it for me.
941900774518374400 2017-12-15 05:20:18 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically They're both fanfic, but different breeds. In middle school Phil and I wrote (most of) a sci-fi novel that basically aped all the major plot points from FFVII. That's TFA. TLJ is much more original / ambitious, but it feels like a fan playing in a world you know.
941899880036933632 2017-12-15 05:16:45 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically All the Disney SWs have effectively been fanfic, but this one really solidifies it.
941899382185742336 2017-12-15 05:14:47 UTC <heWIZARD> I think how you feel about THE LAST JEDI comes down to how you feel about fan fiction.
941790688387067904 2017-12-15 22:02:52 UTC <heWIZARD> The world needs a new STAR WARS. By which I mean, a new Star Wars, not a new *Star Wars*.
941774624773234688 2017-12-15 20:59:02 UTC <heWIZARD> @ChuckPunch I mean... nah.
941766939466010625 2017-12-15 20:28:30 UTC <heWIZARD> This feels like animal abusehttps://twitter.com/qrandbudapest/status/941688854351814657
941710547489132544 2017-12-15 16:44:25 UTC <heWIZARD> @Shinons8 I actually don't think I've ever seen him shoot at free throw.
941706395061063680 2017-12-15 16:27:55 UTC <heWIZARD> @FCBonanno TLJ is the best of the Disney SWs, to me, but... I agree, that's a very low bar.
941705013478309889 2017-12-15 16:22:25 UTC <heWIZARD> @FCBonanno TFA is Star Wars bed sheets. I think the least of TLJ's problems is the direction. There are plenty of issues, to be sure, but it's at least ambitious / interesting. I can't imagine preferring TFA.
941700618489491456 2017-12-15 16:04:58 UTC <heWIZARD> @FCBonanno TFA is not competent filmmaking. It is sewn together mystery box bs that doesn't set up or pay off a single character arc. People bought into the nostalgia factory.
941699491299602432 2017-12-15 16:00:29 UTC <heWIZARD> If anything, the latter is bogged down by the former. But the order is clear.
941698354815184897 2017-12-15 15:55:58 UTC <heWIZARD> If you think THE FORCE AWAKENS is great, but THE LAST JEDI sucks, I just don't know what to tell you.

940820145278259207 2017-12-12 05:46:16 UTC <heWIZARD> According to Alabama law, Roy Moore now has to fuck the horse.

940787082384908289 2017-12-12 03:34:54 UTC <heWIZARD> Looks like the people of Alabama have stood up and said, "NO MOORE."

940370026313289728 2017-12-11 23:57:40 UTC <heWIZARD> It's been over 4 hours, and I'm still trying to unpack how I feel about THE LAST JEDI.  There's just so MUCH -- so many characters to service, ideas to consider, plot threads to untangle -- that it seems impossible to feel any one way about it. It's a Porg's nest.
940331659915751425 2017-12-11 21:25:12 UTC <heWIZARD> @HLLivingLoco It's the best Disney one.

940033250705022981 2017-12-10 01:39:26 UTC <heWIZARD> @Mattgina ...anyway I'm still excited for THE LAST JEDI
940031024343392256 2017-12-10 01:30:35 UTC <heWIZARD> @Mattgina It honestly gets worse each time. Every scene is trying to do 3 too many things. The pacing is atrocious. The sets all look like they end just out of frame. Nevermind the Star Wars related crimes.
939995252965875712 2017-12-10 23:08:27 UTC <heWIZARD> Well, that was a first. Just saw two little girls at the park walking their... guinea pig.

930864778259570688 2017-11-15 18:27:12 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically Individual episodes of well-known shows are definitely more palleteable than shows that deal with time travel on the regular.
930863827285032960 2017-11-15 18:23:25 UTC <heWIZARD> @philhornshaw @noelchenier @playcritically That the future is already written (God has a plan!) and also that it can be miraculously changed by the intervention of a single white guy are both pretty Christian ideas.
930863269979373568 2017-11-15 18:21:12 UTC <heWIZARD> @philhornshaw @noelchenier In general we shy away from television. It's a huge investment of (heh) time for something that fewer listeners are able to follow. But, as always... maybe some day.

930845166449049600 2017-11-15 17:09:16 UTC <heWIZARD> @noelchenier @philhornshaw It's weird because the only one traveling through time is... the newspaper. There are time travel ideas, though, about changing the future and whether or not your own involvement causes the very disasters you're trying to prevent.

926538963283689472 2017-11-03 19:57:57 UTC <heWIZARD> @philrowen Though neither reached "OH NO DADS ARE FIGHTING" levels of Civil War.
926538885835796480 2017-11-03 19:57:39 UTC <heWIZARD> @philrowen For me, Guardians 2 and Spider-Man succeeded in having it both ways, SM especially.
926538585267769345 2017-11-03 19:56:27 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically YES. Civil War might still be best one. Somehow Marvel has been able to build on its characters and become deconstructionist about heroes.
926538219251908608 2017-11-03 19:55:00 UTC <heWIZARD> @philrowen Counterpoint: Guardians 2 made me cry like a baby. I was... also pretty high.
926537461106225152 2017-11-03 19:51:59 UTC <heWIZARD> Or GUARDIANS 2, for that matter. Both of which were Very Good.

924837761894440962 2017-10-29 03:17:59 UTC <heWIZARD> @JBrunskowski4 I know because it's when I get to see them play. Can't remember the last time I saw a Pistons victory at Staples. These last 2 games... wow
924837598949883906 2017-10-29 03:17:20 UTC <heWIZARD> @JBrunskowski4 HOWEVER, no matter how good they are or back the Lakers / Clippers are, the Pistons are always *awful* on this West Coast trip.

924392430060711936 2017-10-28 21:48:24 UTC <heWIZARD> @JBrunskowski4 I liked what they were doing on that last drive, but you can only get into enemy territory and come up empty handed so many times.
924389942112817153 2017-10-28 21:38:31 UTC <heWIZARD> Michigan State seems determined to give this game away.

924124264323674112 2017-10-27 04:02:48 UTC <heWIZARD> Now that we've been at it a few years, when an entire season of television drops, it feels exhausting, not exciting.
924121432556150785 2017-10-27 03:51:33 UTC <heWIZARD> Can't imagine why Trump and right-wing media spent the week pushing uranium conspiracy theories.https://twitter.com/CNN/status/924074203229409280

924056176454549504 2017-10-27 23:32:15 UTC <heWIZARD> @QuagSport Also they're shooting 45.5% from 3 (best in the league). Doubt that's sustainable.

923985185489633280 2017-10-27 18:50:09 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut By going to the store, I made them already sold out.
923984784019267584 2017-10-27 18:48:33 UTC <heWIZARD> Anyway, it's a good thing that store is going out of business.
923984720785899520 2017-10-27 18:48:18 UTC <heWIZARD> Did all of the employees buy them? Did they "sell" them to customers on the phone before the store opened? No one there got one.
923984480951398400 2017-10-27 18:47:21 UTC <heWIZARD> I went to Toys "R" Us before it opened and they told us as the doors opened that they were "already sold out" of SNES Classics. Um.

923229925896740864 2017-10-25 16:49:01 UTC <heWIZARD> Honestly, being a staff writer on a TV show and being forced to livetweet your own show seems like a nightmare.

922961803327389696 2017-10-24 23:03:36 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically Exactly.
922954804971823104 2017-10-24 22:35:47 UTC <heWIZARD> I'm currently walking distance to Dodgers Stadium but nearly got heatstroke walking across the street for coffee.
922954536645361664 2017-10-24 22:34:43 UTC <heWIZARD> Baseball is mostly just standing around and it is way too hot in LA to play baseball.
922922064045998080 2017-10-24 20:25:41 UTC <heWIZARD> Remember when a washed up rock star with the IQ of an empty Budweiser can said he was running for Senate and the media believed him?

920866236853923840 2017-10-18 04:16:34 UTC <heWIZARD> Pistons opening night thoughts: -I still haven't accepted the Palace is gone -The Flagstar Bank patches are an eyesore -God god, Stanley
920864691177394177 2017-10-18 04:10:25 UTC <heWIZARD> This self-imposed diet, like all diets, is ultimately about being a hungry a lot and dealing with it.
920832475395276800 2017-10-18 02:02:25 UTC <heWIZARD> @davechensky Get well, Dave.
920816957951053824 2017-10-18 01:00:45 UTC <heWIZARD> If I died at home, I don't think my dog would eat me, but I do think she would whine at my corpse for not feeding her in a timely fashion.
920778942566383616 2017-10-18 22:29:41 UTC <heWIZARD> It's hard when you're an unestablished screenwriter working on spec to be happy with only a few pages in a day. But you have to be.
920759687179407360 2017-10-18 21:13:10 UTC <heWIZARD> Crossover potential: When I read this tweet, I thought Phil was talking about healthcare.https://twitter.com/philhornshaw/status/920668113053499392
920759433453453312 2017-10-18 21:12:10 UTC <heWIZARD> @philhornshaw What's the point of a line if we can't sell it back to you 8,000 ways?

920720105926934528 2017-10-18 18:35:54 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically Yes, this is true. But you're also right that the VOD cycle is super accelerated these days.
920719049310420992 2017-10-18 18:31:42 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically It feels like ages ago. Though the movie next to HOMECOMING when I rented it on amazon was The Dark Tower, which definitely just came out.
920717227938127873 2017-10-18 18:24:27 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically Look at me, over here doubling my productivity.
920716066312949760 2017-10-18 18:19:50 UTC <heWIZARD> Anyway, if you need me, I'll be over here, 6 months behind The Discourse.
920715951619784704 2017-10-18 18:19:23 UTC <heWIZARD> Watching either of the AMAZING SPIDER-MANs followed by HOMECOMING might send you to the chiropractor with actual whiplash.
920715683503120384 2017-10-18 18:18:19 UTC <heWIZARD> It's actually too bad its ties to the Marvel Cinematic Universe at large cut it off from a larger audience. It's that good.
920715487666880512 2017-10-18 18:17:32 UTC <heWIZARD> How does a movie with six credited writers lack a single false note? It's either a goddamned miracle, or Jon Watts is frighteningly talented
920713724104552449 2017-10-18 18:10:32 UTC <heWIZARD> Every last moment of SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING filled me with joy. Instantly one of my all-time favorite superhero movies.

920692687505723394 2017-10-18 16:46:57 UTC <heWIZARD> If Trump got on TV and said, "We drink the Kool-Aid at midnight," we would lose a quarter of the country by morning.https://twitter.com/DanAlexander21/status/920660104508268544

920463556419579904 2017-10-17 01:36:27 UTC <heWIZARD> I follow like half of basketball twitter and haven't see photos or videos, proving once again that basketball twitter is the best twitter.
920409781734481920 2017-10-17 22:02:47 UTC <heWIZARD> @Josh_Jarmanning This poster is actually a great exception. There's a concept, a flow, and an eye-popping color scheme. The opposite: BLACK PANTHER / SW.
920347329974083584 2017-10-17 17:54:37 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically ...and, ya know, don't get me started on Luke running away. I'm hopeful they'll account for this in Last Jedi.
920346843195760640 2017-10-17 17:52:41 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically The Han Solo we knew at the end of Jedi would do anything for his friends. Denial or not, he would be looking for Luke, or for Ben.
920346453045780480 2017-10-17 17:51:08 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically Imagine Rey never just happens to find the Falcon and just happens to run into Han Solo. What does he do with his life?
920345932553625600 2017-10-17 17:49:04 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically I have no problem with him being a mentor. He's just so passive and along for the ride. He was just cool with Ben becoming New Vader.
920345639354908672 2017-10-17 17:47:54 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically He's also always been a guy who, despite the entire arc of the OT, forgot about his wife and friend and evil son and went... smuggling.
920343436791767045 2017-10-17 17:39:09 UTC <heWIZARD> THE FORCE AWAKENS' profound, painful misunderstanding of who Han Solo is.
920343245325864960 2017-10-17 17:38:23 UTC <heWIZARD> Set aside recasting Harrison Ford and being against prequels in general, my trepidation about SOLO is based on one thing:
920167998064697344 2017-10-16 06:02:01 UTC <heWIZARD> Oh, so he definitely did it.https://twitter.com/AP_Politics/status/920000030454484993
920145836155084800 2017-10-16 04:33:57 UTC <heWIZARD> I would like to go to the movies, please.
920139683111215104 2017-10-16 04:09:30 UTC <heWIZARD> Today a coworker asked me if the flux capacitor on my shirt was a fidget spinner. We are truly fucked.
920065738915770368 2017-10-16 23:15:40 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically Dude, I hate it.
920065027691839490 2017-10-16 23:12:51 UTC <heWIZARD> I guess when every movie became a comic book movie, probably.
920064867309981698 2017-10-16 23:12:13 UTC <heWIZARD> When did we decide that a movie poster requires cramming in every character?

919987376516055040 2017-10-16 18:04:17 UTC <heWIZARD> The Academy expelled Harvey Weinstein just 7 months removed from awarding Best Actor to a sexual assaulter. It's 100% optics.
919972082942844933 2017-10-16 17:03:31 UTC <heWIZARD> @MJHaugen I made this this morning. It was good.
919969947119378432 2017-10-16 16:55:02 UTC <heWIZARD> ALSO: Our books are currently $8.99 and $8.49.

919414589149741059 2017-10-14 04:08:14 UTC <heWIZARD> I had to unfollow father of Final Fantasy Hironobu Sakaguchi for RTing too much anime tiddy.
919413314119114752 2017-10-14 04:03:10 UTC <heWIZARD> @GOP Systemic problems and cultural commonalties notwithstanding, Hollywood is NOT a single monolithic entity like, say, @FoxNews.
919412727830929410 2017-10-14 04:00:50 UTC <heWIZARD> @GOP "Hollywood" comprises myriad people in hundreds of different jobs at thousands of different companies all over the world.
919412134588514304 2017-10-14 03:58:29 UTC <heWIZARD> "Hollywood" = "Los Angeles" = "California" = "Liberals"  There is no line of thinking too reductive and devoid of nuance for the @GOP.

919234954940137472 2017-10-14 16:14:26 UTC <heWIZARD> I spent my boycott day writing 5 pages of a new script, recording a new #ParadoxPod with @philhornshaw, and opening twitter by accident.
918694442747363330 2017-10-12 04:26:38 UTC <heWIZARD> Boycott to fight. Boycott to break from fighting. Boycott to do something you love. Whatever you do, stand with women. #WomenBoycottTwitter
918693483476533249 2017-10-12 04:22:49 UTC <heWIZARD> You wouldn't patronize a restaurant or a bar or a ride service where women are harassed and dehumanized. #WomenBoycottTwitter

918163955515760640 2017-10-11 17:18:40 UTC <heWIZARD> If you're from Texas or Florida and aren't ABSOLUTELY LIVID about Puerto Rico, you're a soulless hypocrite.
918162989152329728 2017-10-11 17:14:49 UTC <heWIZARD> @NEwertKrocker I'm grateful to TFA for giving me permission to not care about STAR WARS any more.
917969961154433024 2017-10-10 04:27:48 UTC <heWIZARD> @Freywagg Some of my favorite sports memories comprise watching the US play in the World Cup with friends and total strangers.
917948885074456576 2017-10-10 03:04:03 UTC <heWIZARD> It's something the country could use right now. Just feels like a pile on. Fuck all.
917948629503033346 2017-10-10 03:03:02 UTC <heWIZARD> In the grand scheme of current affairs, sports are trivial, but the emotion and unity that flow from even a "bad" soccer country is powerful
917948381032431617 2017-10-10 03:02:03 UTC <heWIZARD> The World Cup is probably the best sporting event there is and it is an absolute travesty the US won't be represented.
917926169114066944 2017-10-10 01:33:47 UTC <heWIZARD> @detroitbadboys At first I thought the 38.5 over under was disrespectful, but it's probably right on the money.
917895302283124736 2017-10-10 23:31:08 UTC <heWIZARD> See, when your first movie is poorly written, your sequel has to be both good on its own and good enough to compensate for the first one.
917893079788482560 2017-10-10 23:22:18 UTC <heWIZARD> @philhornshaw Soon everything will be smolder and flame, if that's what you mean

917832445692538881 2017-10-10 19:21:22 UTC <heWIZARD> I would honestly donate good money to see @realDonaldTrump take an IQ test on a livestream. https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/post-politics/wp/2017/10/10/trump-proposes-iq-tests-face-off-with-tillerson-after-secretary-of-state-calls-him-a-moron/

917590165433884673 2017-10-09 03:18:38 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut I want you to know this made me chuckle.
917515706492526592 2017-10-09 22:22:45 UTC <heWIZARD> @RogueCheddar The Queen has empowered me to strip you of your knighthood (and also to let you know that "dote on" is fine, too).

917471676392128512 2017-10-09 19:27:48 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically It's basically a prerequisite
917468362631929856 2017-10-09 19:14:38 UTC <heWIZARD> If you have a bald eagle as a profile pic there's a 90% chance you're a racist.
917454966490406912 2017-10-09 18:21:24 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically Taking back our time, three minutes at a time.
917454524503040001 2017-10-09 18:19:38 UTC <heWIZARD> Reminder: You don't have to watch the trailer for a movie you know you're going to see anyway.
917431067111448576 2017-10-09 16:46:26 UTC <heWIZARD> The answer, as always, is to write my way out.
917426623195967488 2017-10-09 16:28:46 UTC <heWIZARD> @garrettelliott I honestly think the 3-point "revolution" began in pick-up games, where they are worth a ridiculous 2x as much as any other basket.
917408042735386624 2017-10-09 15:14:56 UTC <heWIZARD> @detroitbadboys Because listening to the whole episode again takes too much time and also do I really sound like that?
917247599748333568 2017-10-08 04:37:24 UTC <heWIZARD> Can't overemphasize that the Szechuan Sauce gag is a bottom-3 joke in the entire season of Rick & Morty.

915273087972605953 2017-10-03 17:51:23 UTC <heWIZARD> @manieldanning I'm gonna hard disagree here. Rick is clearly being set up to be the villain of the show. He's miserable and is only happy spreading misery.

912053105826578432 2017-09-24 20:36:20 UTC <heWIZARD> @NEwertKrocker They don't improve then, huh. That's too bad.
912050304224419840 2017-09-24 20:25:12 UTC <heWIZARD> The NFL sucks for a multitude of reasons.https://twitter.com/Lions/status/912050049852592134
912046147945996288 2017-09-24 20:08:41 UTC <heWIZARD> @NEwertKrocker I'm not sure why they're so confused on the balance. XIII is too linear. XV is too open. FFs are linear set pieces broken up by exploration.
912043575071797248 2017-09-24 19:58:27 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut Interesting. I know it's been divisive. I think early on I'm feeling both.
912040443830927360 2017-09-24 19:46:01 UTC <heWIZARD> @NEwertKrocker It feels like they were halfway through dev when someone said, "But wait, Americans only like open world games now," and they turned hard.
912040093518409728 2017-09-24 19:44:37 UTC <heWIZARD> I really just want to step into a big city, take in the local customs, talk to the locals, and sneak around in its sewers already.
912039808947466240 2017-09-24 19:43:29 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut Also, I put probably 40 hours into A Realm Reborn, and I'm not an MMO guy. It's genuinely good.
912039518596825089 2017-09-24 19:42:20 UTC <heWIZARD> @NEwertKrocker Yeah, when I started to hear that from game writer friends, my enthusiasm evaporated. Not sure why these guys can't tell a story anymore.
912039155785277440 2017-09-24 19:40:54 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut I mean, it's certainly better than XIII. It's far from earning itself past XII, though, and I never even finished that one.
912038998079500288 2017-09-24 19:40:16 UTC <heWIZARD> @NEwertKrocker Yeah, like... I can't decide. I enjoy it while I'm playing and find myself wanting to go back, but when I think about it I come to... "Huh."
912038783356248064 2017-09-24 19:39:25 UTC <heWIZARD> No real mini-bosses, or even bosses, thus far. I don't even have a representative character of the enemy? It's all focused on "open world."
912038561498644480 2017-09-24 19:38:32 UTC <heWIZARD> Even the moments that are *supposed* to feel like traditional FF setpieces get the pacing wrong, or fail to punctuate properly.
912038361128300544 2017-09-24 19:37:44 UTC <heWIZARD> Final Fantasy are 1. The lack of big cities or diverse towns to explore 2. The lack of clear set pieces (at least 7 hours in)
912038178814439424 2017-09-24 19:37:01 UTC <heWIZARD> I think the devs leaned a little too hard into the open world feel. For all its innovations, the things that make it feel the least like...
912037911549288449 2017-09-24 19:35:57 UTC <heWIZARD> @RAT_FOX Hell, they would applaud it.
912037739909935104 2017-09-24 19:35:16 UTC <heWIZARD> I'm way behind the discourse on this, but FFXV is a super weird game. I'm both enthralled and confused by it.
912037375647260672 2017-09-24 19:33:49 UTC <heWIZARD> @RAT_FOX It could happen in a day. Secret Service wears out their welcome / runs out of funds, Trump anoints ICE his personal police.

912004933142011904 2017-09-24 17:24:54 UTC <heWIZARD> @REAS0NFactory If you honestly believe people should be forced to stand for an anthem, you are a gutless, anti-American.
912004668422635521 2017-09-24 17:23:51 UTC <heWIZARD> @REAS0NFactory Veterans will tell you that they fought for this country's ideals. The flag is a piece of fabric. Freedom of speech and to protest is real.
912004109577854976 2017-09-24 17:21:38 UTC <heWIZARD> @REAS0NFactory You clearly have no concept what the flag stands for.

911467061020262400 2017-09-22 05:47:36 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically Mamet is a playwright first and foremost. I'd say UNTOUCHABLES is his least play-like in many respects, but still has some of the hallmarks.
911457392738549761 2017-09-22 05:09:11 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically I have not.
911456717359026177 2017-09-22 05:06:30 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically Somehow I had no idea he'd written it until the opening credits.
911456553571454977 2017-09-22 05:05:51 UTC <heWIZARD> @philhornshaw When he goes alone to find Capone at his hotel, I would have been yelling if my throat didn't hurt.
911456361002680320 2017-09-22 05:05:05 UTC <heWIZARD> @philhornshaw He was so great. I wasn't into the understated do-gooder bit at first, but the way it develops is amazing.
911454152298872832 2017-09-22 04:56:18 UTC <heWIZARD> Watched UNTOUCHABLES for the first time. De Palma, Mamet, Morricone, Costner, Connery, De Niro, Garcia -- how had I never watched this?
911436895669731329 2017-09-22 03:47:44 UTC <heWIZARD> If you applaud or support a politician who vilifies a citizen for exercising his right to peaceful protest, you are profoundly un-American.

909175542359797760 2017-09-16 22:01:55 UTC <heWIZARD> It's frustrating enough that the layperson doesn't know the difference between news, op-ed, and personalty, let alone from an "editor."
909175263446974464 2017-09-16 22:00:49 UTC <heWIZARD> To somehow conflate her tweet with not only ESPN itself but "everyday copy" is willfully twisting the context.
909174855492177920 2017-09-16 21:59:11 UTC <heWIZARD> By design, when she speaks, she is doing so AS HERSELF. ESPN knows this and banks on this.
909174670611513344 2017-09-16 21:58:27 UTC <heWIZARD> Jemele Hill is a media personality. She is not a journalist. Even insofar as she discusses sports news, she does so as a talking head.
909174457645670400 2017-09-16 21:57:37 UTC <heWIZARD> If a journalist is calling Trump a white supremacist in a news story, they are doing so in context. W/ a quote. In a story about the topic.
909174099624173568 2017-09-16 21:56:11 UTC <heWIZARD> If a media outlet is calling Trump a white supremacist, they're doing so on their op-ed page or equivalent.
909173425582641152 2017-09-16 21:53:30 UTC <heWIZARD> Another infuriating trend in media literacy (or lack thereof): an inability to distinguish between journalists, outlets, and personalities.https://twitter.com/ESPNPublicEd/status/908896148051685376
909138186474995712 2017-09-16 19:33:29 UTC <heWIZARD> @philhornshaw Except at least that action was for the greater good.

908878809360850944 2017-09-15 02:22:48 UTC <heWIZARD> Can anyone identify this monstrous spider in my office window? It's the size of guitar pick.pic.twitter.com/3yid6pEzRS

908808847443103744 2017-09-15 21:44:48 UTC <heWIZARD> Shocking: White people who don't like being called racist think you have to self-identity as a white supremacist to be a white supremacist.

908185561130713088 2017-09-13 04:28:05 UTC <heWIZARD> I like to imagine that when Pelosi and Schumer step into the Oval Office they flip Trump a burnt steak and go from there

908066427457888256 2017-09-13 20:34:42 UTC <heWIZARD> @playcritically There's basically no possible answer that can justify it being mystery boxed. Except, of course, that her parents were Nobodies.

908022393104252928 2017-09-13 17:39:43 UTC <heWIZARD> They think Jemele should be fired for "saying something," despite being true, and think Pew should be left alone because it's "just a word."
908021723861204992 2017-09-13 17:37:03 UTC <heWIZARD> Trump supporters and their ilk have lost all grasp on the context and meaning of words. Everything is a binary state.

907836685232300033 2017-09-12 05:21:47 UTC <heWIZARD> Why is Episode I better than TFA and R1? The prequels are bad but at least they had the audacity to show us something new.
907836236026585089 2017-09-12 05:20:00 UTC <heWIZARD> Whereby "Best" is really dictated by "Which One I'd Most Willingly Watch Again." Sometimes 4 > 5. After the first 3, it's debatable.

904200243247423488 2017-09-02 04:31:51 UTC <heWIZARD> I think a disproportionate amount of attention goes to the @nytimes op-ed pages, but honestly, whaaat the fuck is going on over there?

900767367109591040 2017-08-24 17:10:50 UTC <heWIZARD> @unfitforpurpose But so far the "It sucks now" and "GoT has become the worst show on television" takes feel... hyperbolic to say the least.
900767254664445952 2017-08-24 17:10:23 UTC <heWIZARD> @unfitforpurpose There are ways the show has weakened -- no more persistent underlying dread, a lot of the remaining "surprises" are foregone conclusions --
900767033188429824 2017-08-24 17:09:30 UTC <heWIZARD> @unfitforpurpose Having not seen episode 6, their plan north of the wall is ill-conceived, but I'm still excited for Snow's Eleven.
900766645785776128 2017-08-24 17:07:58 UTC <heWIZARD> This morning I thought, "Oh yeah, I should do that this morning. That would be productive," and now I can't remember what that thing was.

900565216689180673 2017-08-23 03:47:34 UTC <heWIZARD> Hot Take: The Overwatch shorts are very good and it is still insulting to compare them to Pixar films.
900564628299685889 2017-08-23 03:45:13 UTC <heWIZARD> @philrowen But does it require watching Gotham

900409240354828288 2017-08-23 17:27:46 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut There needed to be a "Look, up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! No!" period for it to work, but that would require pacing & fun.
900409108834140160 2017-08-23 17:27:14 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut Yeah, none of how people react to Superman ever feels properly earned, I think because we never get them in awe of him.
900408121033609217 2017-08-23 17:23:19 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut it what makes him Superman. And yeah, even without the Zod murder, it would make no sense for anyone to embrace Superman at the end.
900407968297926656 2017-08-23 17:22:43 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut ...his alien nature, and Pa Kent being human, and teaching Clark to love. Ultimately Clark being a Good Guy who happens to have alien powers
900407787456352256 2017-08-23 17:21:59 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut I side with The Narrative on the Pa Kent stuff. If anything they should have flipped it with Space Dad -- he, reluctant and embracing...
900406156044062720 2017-08-23 17:15:30 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut A lot of the scenes work on their own but not really together. There's no connection between Grown Clark and the Young Clark flashbacks.
900406019301318656 2017-08-23 17:14:58 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut I like much of MoS but it has a lot of problems.
900405847829786626 2017-08-23 17:14:17 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut I... still haven't seen it. Yeah, I'm a dad now.
900405422439321600 2017-08-23 17:12:36 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut That's kind of the Snyder trademark, we seem to be concluding.
900405181069656064 2017-08-23 17:11:38 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut That's true. The good superheroes are examining their own ideas / implications on their own. Doesn't really beg for a parallel genre.
900404257769234432 2017-08-23 17:07:58 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut Right, these are all good choices. But when was the last one? There was a surge 5-10 years ago that got run over by Real Superheroes.
900404076797607936 2017-08-23 17:07:15 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut I agree it's unfairly maligned. It's fine. Though most of what doesn't translate from the novel at the... ya know, ideas.
900396859625062400 2017-08-23 16:38:34 UTC <heWIZARD> Are there any deconstructionist superhero movies that are better that just okay? UNBREAKABLE and... ...
900396720466427904 2017-08-23 16:38:01 UTC <heWIZARD> Weird that actual superhero movies managed to steamroll deconstructionist superhero movies by being consistently better.
900387800079409153 2017-08-23 16:02:34 UTC <heWIZARD> It's #weeWizard's first day of preschool and I'm nervous like it's mine.
900220985328140292 2017-08-22 04:59:42 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut Missed that one.
900220410062667776 2017-08-22 04:57:25 UTC <heWIZARD> Have we considered that in an effort to expand his presidential powers @realDonaldTrump stared at the eclipse to become justice itself?
900219917051580416 2017-08-22 04:55:28 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut We didn't even get to the part about how they hired a comedy director... to make... a Joker movie. Guys, he's The Joker not A Comedian.

900215032016982016 2017-08-22 04:36:03 UTC <heWIZARD> If you are at a Trump rally post-Charlottesville, you're looking for a Klan rally without the commitment.
900197789921034240 2017-08-22 03:27:32 UTC <heWIZARD> If you are at a Trump rally in 2017 you can get fucked.

900153654690234368 2017-08-22 00:32:09 UTC <heWIZARD> Real downside to this trade is that I hate the Cavs a little less now.
900130211617886208 2017-08-22 22:59:00 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut There was a running gag about this in the most well-received Batman movie ever made!
900129585223802880 2017-08-22 22:56:31 UTC <heWIZARD> @Learnonaut I can't think of a character who needs an origin story less.
