970438960198582274 2018-03-04 23:20:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DanielJHannan Like hell you have. You've recklessly shredded any credibility the UK had and have been needlessly hostile and befuddled.
970436071862558720 2018-03-04 23:09:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EdwardTHardy I don't believe they cared before but at least maybe it's a step forward.

970398872890761218 2018-03-04 20:41:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Emma4Change @krassenstein I have had a feeling that this is the plan for a while. No public education, no public anything.
970398373529423872 2018-03-04 20:39:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @newcivilrights Is sympathy for people who survived a mass murder supposed to be a bad thing?
970310834122575873 2018-03-04 14:51:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @krassenstein @pullfoxslicense @JulieLillpie30 If you're able to leave the country and not be simply shot or imprisoned. That's what happens to dissenters when a dictator takes over.
970251456950521857 2018-03-04 10:55:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @guardian Great, so trash the most wealthy and job-generating sector of the economy, eh? I'm no fan of bankers but the truth is that this is one of the most important parts of the UK economy.
970249868135555072 2018-03-04 10:49:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @wmarybeard No wonder I never buy the Times.
970220813113798656 2018-03-04 08:54:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SocialPowerOne1 Hmm, how come this didn't apply to any other president?
970218778763104256 2018-03-04 08:45:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @C_Stroop Utterly demented.
970218260665917440 2018-03-04 08:43:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @splcenter @C_Stroop I sort of thought that was what the establishment clause was all about. Silly me.
970216590389252096 2018-03-04 08:37:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @politico It's like they didn't realize he is an unstable opportunist who will say whatever seems most profitable in any given moment and doesn't actually have any stable opinions of his own.
970213640010960896 2018-03-04 08:25:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Freeland @davidallengreen @thatginamiller I don't have a single shred of pity for her.
970211276210298881 2018-03-04 08:16:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BBC @campbellclaret @JohnHopkins_ @cottonboy65 @changesouthwark I have never seen an episode of question time that wasn't completely skewed toward hard brexit. Clearly I've missed something.
970210904699793408 2018-03-04 08:14:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BBC @campbellclaret I believe that was on the referendum ballot paper.
970210521248141313 2018-03-04 08:13:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tony_nog It's the conformity in particular that is driving me to the Lib Dems. So many Labour supporters I've run into demand that I think and say exactly what they do or else I'm an "evil Tory". Not helpful.
970209652171595776 2018-03-04 08:09:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @supermathskid @omandprem Well I'm really sick of people my age thinking they know everything and anyone younger couldn't possibly have anything valuable to say, so I guess we're even. Was there anything actually incorrect? Or is the fact that what she said is true making you angry?
970203349114028032 2018-03-03 07:44:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @joshraclaw @justinsb Or, once you've finished one and realized your job prospects are even worse now, because everyone thinks you're an over-educated snob and they don't believe that you know how to type.
970202025559515136 2018-03-03 07:39:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @joshraclaw @OrionJchess That was my motivation for taking so long.
970199718230884352 2018-03-03 07:30:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @owillis Yep. I honestly think that not a damn thing will come out of the investigation.

970087845045112832 2018-03-03 00:05:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Otto_English No wonder so many people on doorsteps last year thought they were directly voting for PM. Maybe we need a massive remedial civics class.
970087306152628225 2018-03-03 00:03:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @brianklaas I can back you up.
970040615470759936 2018-03-03 20:57:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Sounds very interesting and disturbing.https://twitter.com/magi_jay/status/970034579502456833
970039435638267904 2018-03-03 20:53:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @deray @homesbystephani That's pretty harsh on the third world.
970036903805415424 2018-03-03 20:43:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @deray @WattleOfBits @MrsPancakes2011 I believe it is all part of a twisted, fundamentalist Christian world view that sees women as second class beings that really have no business thinking for themselves or being educated in the first place.
969860908414590976 2018-03-03 09:03:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @OhNoSheTwitnt @RNickGorton @CunningSmi1e Amusingly enough I also have a friend whose brother is Dan, and so is his husband. They are Uncle Dan and Aunt Dan. Makes total sense!

969859236254699520 2018-03-03 08:57:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TheScepticIsle Indeed even as a remainer I have always been wary of the ever closer political union. But I thought we should have taken the lead on reforming that, because other countries have similar concerns.
969850375762259968 2018-03-03 08:22:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @legallyblackuk Those posters are great. Good job!
969848128311644160 2018-03-03 08:13:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tribelaw Risking? I'd say they are well on the way to destroying.
969847097766957056 2018-03-03 08:09:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AndrewGillum @JoyAnnReid @ginny6363 @NIK_VENTURE They are only in favour of the "will of the people" when it's their people. Hence gerrymandering and voter suppression. They and their ilk are trying to silence and disempower the majority.
969843083151015938 2018-03-02 07:53:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Odbe34 @masumkhwaja I find the idea that a good opposition sits back and waits for the ruling party to destroy itself a bit odd. Meanwhile damaging things are made law and the possibilities for the future shrink. Surely the role of the opposition is to critique and limit the damage?
969841837962858496 2018-03-02 07:48:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NotTheToryPress @jeremycorbyn And what have you done to stop her?
969172241794699265 2018-03-01 11:27:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @marcorubio Hope you are looking in the mirror as you write this.

968744715075112964 2018-02-27 07:08:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @voteleavelied Welcome to the party! I would not be so upset myself if it were being handled competently. It's the complete mess and disorganization that really angers me.
968582678588153862 2018-02-27 20:24:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @A50Challenge @NeilFRWarden1 Welcome to the party and thanks for speaking up!
968534552368111617 2018-02-27 17:13:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ddale8 @JoelKlebanoff @BrettaApplebaum I read it as "non interesting" so I thought you were making a very different point.
968529133260156929 2018-02-27 16:51:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @faisalislam Why is this jerk in a position of authority? He is clearly incapable of taking his duties seriously.
968447145379495936 2018-02-27 11:26:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @zooweamama So aggravating. Just as stupid as asking how someone with depression can sometimes laugh.

967420345752932353 2018-02-24 15:25:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @emmyzen @fish_in_a_hat @KaptainKobold @HouseofthePeopl True though. If you live outside the UK for more than 15 years, IIRC, you lose your right to vote even if you are still a citizen. And thousands didn't get their postal ballots in time.
967363279168462850 2018-02-24 11:39:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sarahchad_ Keep it up. The snark is getting to them. 
967311141407023105 2018-02-24 08:12:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @molly_knight @bzrong @katemccarron1 @nathanjm000 @andraya_ltn If a college doesn't admit you because you got suspended protesting guns then you don't want to go to that college anyway. Really. There are plenty of places that are not so rules oriented, and admissions departments will be aware of what is happening now.
967310412315353089 2018-02-24 08:09:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @molly_knight @elvissokolski @StephMichelle92 @Steinbeckfan1 I certainly would have as well. I was working in Denver that day and some of my colleagues had kids that went there. I regret that I didn't start protesting the availability of guns then and there.
967309027964223488 2018-02-24 08:03:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @kylegriffin1 "We refuse to be suckers", eh? 
967304474573369344 2018-02-23 07:45:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @chrislhayes @FlyingMezerkis @respectlearning Their definition of swamp is not what everyone thought it was.
967304009773174784 2018-02-23 07:43:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SarahLudford @UK4EU4ALL I don't even think it's that. Plenty of insanely rich people are pragmatic and if not compassionate at least understand what other people are thinking.
967303522692812801 2018-02-23 07:41:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid @YakAngler7 Well yes, the solution is to keep guns away from schools. This type of weapon that can kill so many in a short time has no business being in civilian hands. We are smart enough to come up with a solution that isn't just more guns and more death.
967302670020173824 2018-02-23 07:38:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid @jpmcdonald @BigEdMcCarthy @WendellSherk @Kaldeon I'm agreeing with you. It's ludicrous to expect that arming teachers is the answer.
967244564015796224 2018-02-23 03:47:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TeaPainUSA @JOY_4_44 I really hope so but I thought Las Vegas would be a turning point and it was not. And Sandy Hook. And Columbine for that matter.
967244193209946112 2018-02-23 03:46:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid @YakAngler7 Seems foolish to rely on people who are not defense professionals stepping up and putting themselves in extreme danger, though. It happens but merely being armed is no guarantee that you will be able to kill someone.
967240587274485760 2018-02-23 03:31:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid @YakAngler7 There's a reason why heroes are heroes, though. Because it was an exceptional sacrifice. The fact that this doesn't always happen is well documented. See the bystander effect: most people do not step in and put themselves at risk.
967239564657152000 2018-02-23 03:27:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid @jpmcdonald @BigEdMcCarthy @Kaldeon @WendellSherk An awful lot of assumptions, don't you think?
967238644049285121 2018-02-23 03:23:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid @kerry_mccracken Exactly. The whole good guys with guns argument is fundamentally flawed because it assumes that the shooter wants to survive. The threat of death is not a deterrent to the suicidal.
967236409038901248 2018-02-23 03:15:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TeaPainUSA @JOY_4_44 That's already happened, though. Wasn't killed but remember the shooting at the basketball game? Made no difference.
967235693947826178 2018-02-23 03:12:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TeaPainUSA I disagree. The nra aren't *that* powerful and I think it's a mistake to lay everything at their feet and expect that taking them down a notch will solve the problem. Guns are a wider and deeper issue than the nra alone.
967235051783098369 2018-02-23 03:09:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> What's your stance on this, @UCCS and @nmsu? As an alum of both of you I certainly hope you will not penalise potential students for standing up for their lives.https://twitter.com/marceelias/status/967233489782394881
967234078230622208 2018-02-23 03:05:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RVAwonk I am so disgusted by people who attack survivors of these events.

967230292082782215 2018-02-23 02:50:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SarahLudford Bloody difficult woman indeed. Does reality ever actually sink in for her? She seems to be on another planet.
967026483133865984 2018-02-23 13:20:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> I've suffered from anxiety and depression on and off my whole life. When I have a bad episode I go back on an ssri for a while and then I can get back to life. #MedsWorkedForMe
966931415723110400 2018-02-22 07:03:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @cybercheshired On the contrary I think they know the public is too smart and will see straight through them if they are open and honest about what they are doing.
966781978581393410 2018-02-22 21:09:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @gabyhinsliff Am I supposed to care about this guy's opinion?

966662615823998981 2018-02-22 13:15:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sarahemclaugh Disgraceful response from the school district.
966562010375876608 2018-02-21 06:35:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RVAwonk @GregIrving61 @network_gal It's too easy to blame the Russians. This has been a cancer in America long before 2016. That's why the propaganda works.
966561160542728192 2018-02-21 06:31:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RVAwonk @electricboyo @ameyerlaw I'd love to see such a thing. Might open a few people's eyes.
966559795275878401 2018-02-21 06:26:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MSNBC @xennialinchief Ah well that's different. The student was disrespecting the flag or some crap, right? Obviously such liberal scum deserve to be shot.  (infuriates me that someone out there really thinks that.)

965845395971690496 2018-02-19 07:07:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ellle_em @thanorodd_ @XoArK_MinusZero @Xenoneuronics My mom was a school teacher. The teachers she worked with by and large were not super fit fighting machines. An angry 14 year old could have overpowered most of them.
965843393409634304 2018-02-19 06:59:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Marmel See also @VoteRiders which helps people get ID, and http://www.votefromabroad.org if you live outside the US. If you're a citizen you can vote from anywhere.
965662650079371265 2018-02-19 19:01:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sunschooldrop Just listening to the Judas episode. @nikobakulich really should listen to this song. I always wanted to do a techno remix but I don't have any musical skills.https://youtu.be/3R8tRKIiAII
965647228173017093 2018-02-19 18:00:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid @BBwriterchick @LiamCarnahan Me too. I've lived in the UK for several years and I feel much safer here.
965646631625547776 2018-02-19 17:57:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid @Dist_5 And this is something that the love it or leave it crowd don't care to understand. It's actually not that easy to move to another country.

965643801762193409 2018-02-19 17:46:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MaxBoot I've never heard of you, but I'm off to look at your work now.
965578876859580416 2018-02-19 13:28:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @spaceangel1964 I'm quite happy to be rabid and vindictive if my current behaviour qualifies as such. In fact I wish brexiters were of a similar level of both. We'd be much more civilised.
965532655549853696 2018-02-19 10:24:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JulieOwenMoylan Word. I'm an archaeologist. I have studied plenty of situations where civilizations collapsed. There are lessons we could learn.

Sounds like a conspiracy theory but I do wonder.
964841787230736384 2018-02-17 12:39:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @kurteichenwald I'm not going to stand for the anthem again until we have sensible gun control, a serious nationwide effort to tackle police violence, and progress on restoring voting rights. Right now I'm not very proud to be American.
964840589371068418 2018-02-17 12:34:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CHSommers @mookie4ever86 @JezebelKat Exactly. Cleaned up environment and got rid of Nixon, then elected Regan and started on the path to trump and the imminent destruction of the environment, civil and disability rights, democracy itself. I'm not impressed with my parents' generation.

I never dreamed that it would happen again and again and yet somehow those deaths would be deemed an acceptable price to pay for a gun fetish.
964762168141938688 2018-02-16 07:23:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sarahchad_ @VasqLife @qneill @hypnovirus @HappyGamer115 @GMcDowellJr And correct me if I'm wrong but weren't the weapons used in Orlando, Las Vegas, and this latest incident all legally obtained? The barrier of needing to go to black market sources to obtain weapons probably would stop some because they simply don't have the contacts.
964760361709785088 2018-02-16 07:16:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Femi_Sorry I suppose that once you've killed everyone and destroyed everything it will be pretty peaceful.
964082606311641088 2018-02-15 10:22:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Gravityisback1 @emigre80 @JonStillNotaBot Being alive in the USA puts you at risk of being shot.
964082105381801984 2018-02-15 10:21:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @emigre80 Me too. Politicize the hell out of it. My family can mourn more effectively knowing my death helped prevent more.
964081403020369920 2018-02-15 10:18:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @bbcnickrobinson I no longer trust BBC news to be unbiased, which is deeply sad and worrying.
964081132655579136 2018-02-15 10:17:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @VP Fuck your prayers. Do something practical. I am sick to death of this fake piety.
964029713441345536 2018-02-14 06:52:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Florida. My heart breaks again. What the hell is wrong with America?
964029277590118401 2018-02-14 06:51:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BorisJohnson @vincecable He says liberal internationalist as though that's a bad thing. I'm proud to be both.
963713727332782080 2018-02-14 09:57:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @trevdick I hope this guy is right!
963522584028635136 2018-02-13 21:17:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Freeyourmindkid @susanbhalpern @luckydoghot Indeed. I don't care if someone on food stamps buys junk food. It's not my place to judge.
963518270933553152 2018-02-13 21:00:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @wokeluisa @Buddybad143 @videogirlprod The NHS is great. There are problems here and there but I've never felt afraid that an unexpected health crisis would bankrupt me like I did back home. That security is worth waiting longer for an appointment.
963517620921225216 2018-02-13 20:57:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @wokeluisa Because poor people aren't real Americans? Dunno, that's all I've got.
963515595676413953 2018-02-13 20:49:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Freeyourmindkid @susanbhalpern @luckydoghot Gaah this makes me angry. People have the right to get the food they want without interference from food shaming busybodies. The fact that it is partly paid by my taxes does not give me the right to control their purchases.
963514756459122688 2018-02-13 20:46:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Freeyourmindkid And there will be intense food shaming about it, too. I remember jokes about government cheese etc. Feeding your kids the stuff that is supplied will be attacked by health food advocates.
963513041957605376 2018-02-13 20:39:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EODaddy @Lawrence But did she specify American administrations?
962065538309545985 2018-02-09 20:47:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @KEBrightbill I have participated in funerals, weddings, parties, and holidays that I would never have been able to afford to travel to. I can help my sister on another pick out items at the store. Etc etc. I don't think I'd have survived moving overseas otherwise.
962064633908506625 2018-02-09 20:44:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @KEBrightbill For real. My sister's kids talk to me online all the time, but I barely knew my cousins who lived a state away. I chat to my family & friends in other cities weekly, but 15 years ago the long distance costs made phone calls short & occasional.
961857495122628609 2018-02-08 07:01:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GuitarMoog @JamesHodden These people amaze me.
961857251362275328 2018-02-08 07:00:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GuitarMoog Sure seems like it.

961695168264065024 2018-02-08 20:16:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GuitarMoog I've lived in Gateshead for 10 years and I can understand the general sense of despair. But brexit will not improve anything. I've been fighting it on behalf of my neighbours for whom life really can get a hell of a lot worse.
961668753183436800 2018-02-08 18:31:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NiveaSerrao @DubiousCA Found this at random. Excellent little story!
961133157239152640 2018-02-06 07:02:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BravenakBlog @voxsacra_jon Do you know about @VoteRiders ? They help people get ID.
961132822525341696 2018-02-06 07:01:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BravenakBlog  ABSOLUTELY.  I'm real tired of reading think pieces about how to reach those people. We never will. Better to focus on getting out the vote.
960774495421202432 2018-02-05 07:17:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LBC Yes. Of course it is.

They would be delighted to have a king. They have forgotten, or perhaps never understood, what the revolution was about in the first place. And they certainly don't understand the Constitution.
960608309735841792 2018-02-05 20:17:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @rosaltmann No, they can't.

960123699612536832 2018-02-04 12:11:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MikeStuchbery_ @PeterJBeTheName @bloody_exciting Frankly I was raised Christian and I would tell you to get lost for that kind of behaviour too. I think proselytizing is a form of harassment.
960115751272222720 2018-02-04 11:40:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MikeStuchbery_ Makes you wonder if they have ever even been to such places. I've heard my London neighborhood described in similar terms. But I actually went into the mosque! And talked to the imam!
959322591272906752 2018-02-01 07:08:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BBC6Breakfast I'm an archaeologist and have spent the last three weeks doing the same kind of job. My fingers are starting to get stuck in trowel holding position.
958957921701949440 2018-01-31 06:59:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sonofr Especially since she keeps coming out with these xenophobic comments about residency and encourages making immigration as hostile and nasty as possible.
958599462225670144 2018-01-30 07:14:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Freeyourmindkid @jigsawxyouth What if we start our own corporation but also give people free pizza sometimes? Like on Monday, because everyone hates Mondays?
958597690744561664 2018-01-30 07:07:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @pnehlen @mrDaveKrumholtz @nicoleinabox Can I come? I'm not Jewish but I am interested in all religions and I like snacks.
958595609308663808 2018-01-30 06:59:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @christianfunpod @canwejustbecool Cartoons, I think it was called? Hilariously awful.

958424214767366144 2018-01-30 19:38:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Ugh this Chris Rice song. Soooo glad I didn't grow up in a strictly Christian home! @christianfunpod
957874408277905408 2018-01-28 07:13:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ImpactDemocracy @FastCompany Personally I can't wait. I think the whole concept is awesome on many levels.
957872903508385793 2018-01-28 07:07:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @VABVOX For crying out loud. Music is often political and always has been. Yankee Doodle, anyone?
957868111243472896 2018-01-28 06:48:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Femi_Sorry When are you running for office? I'd vote for you. 
957568274140745729 2018-01-28 10:57:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @christianfunpod Also, I'm sure you've probably covered this but bumper stickers reading "my boss is a Jewish carpenter" were very popular in my hometown in the 90s.
957567101618835456 2018-01-28 10:52:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @christianfunpod Just started listening to this. So much weird stuff out there that I was never aware of!
957565476032385024 2018-01-28 10:46:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @FRCdc @IsaacDovere @politico @john71105 @C_Stroop @newsom_roger Which is why I have become so interested in this stuff lately. I've been an agnostic for decades so I didn't realize just how much insanity has taken over the church. As someone with a Christian heritage I feel like I should be helping to fight back.
957539198441017345 2018-01-28 09:01:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LBC @alan_firth_ We need to destroy the influence of said press.
957538846949937153 2018-01-28 09:00:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibyaLiberty He's proud of his nastiness. What is there to dig for?
957537622037028865 2018-01-28 08:55:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nytimes @RetroCrone @ThomCincotta @sooze555 Point is that unless you're native American, you are ultimately foreign born.
957536997656100864 2018-01-28 08:53:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @dickey_evans @MuslimIQ @Patrici60131735 @prodigalpen It is blindingly obvious that these people are utter cowards and terrified of their own shadows. It disgusts me how weak they are. They have to hide behind a gun because they are too scared and fragile to deal with reality.
957534368049909761 2018-01-28 08:42:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @FRCdc @IsaacDovere @politico @john71105 @C_Stroop @newsom_roger Sure, but I think it's too easy to just dismiss them as fake Christians. They certainly think they are believers, even if what they believe is radically different from anything I was ever taught.
957325307928772608 2018-01-27 18:51:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @elikalil_ It's amazing how freeing it is to quit. You don't realize how chained you are until you let it go. It's not easy but it's worth it!
957324499493445632 2018-01-27 18:48:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @FoldableHuman @charlespdk I think it's straight up pathological. Quite pitiable, really, because there's obviously a lot of pain and insecurity behind it.
957308024443621377 2018-01-27 17:43:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GOP @cbminsandiego You just finding this out? Welcome to the club!
957307522716721154 2018-01-27 17:41:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MorganL666 That's completely bonkers. Those boys will be thinking about sex if they are locked up in a completely empty, featureless room. It's just the way puberty works.

957300585774108672 2018-01-27 17:13:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MorganL666 OMG wtaf. That was a thing for you??
957266150257315840 2018-01-27 14:56:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @C_Stroop @reggiejackson78 We'd already be back in the stone age.

957262755354030081 2018-01-27 14:43:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoePajak But in fairness I probably wouldn't vote labour again, even if they do cast themselves as remain. My MP is useless.
957261973997215745 2018-01-27 14:40:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BrexitBin @codfather To be fair I think they have cooperated. IIRC no Lib Dem candidate stood against Caroline Flint, for instance.

957249474262392833 2018-01-27 13:50:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @politico And yet somehow God didn't have a hand in making Obama president...
957248766674898946 2018-01-27 13:47:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TUSK81 @margitaeve @fferic30 Family values for them means men get to do whatever they want and women and children have to be subservient and accept all abuse or mistreatment without question.
957248300448698369 2018-01-27 13:45:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jayacoop @TUSK81 @melisheath @fuk_n_real @GuayitaTheCat Indeed. There are more categories of resident than "undocumented" and "citizen". It's painfully obvious most people in these discussions have never actually read any of the instructions for immigration on the DHS or State Dept websites.
957247520509513730 2018-01-27 13:42:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TUSK81 @GETOUTTAHERE69 @Rachelherrera11 It would actually be a bit tricky and a very long and expensive process for me to move back to the US with my British spouse, for instance, and our case is very straightforward. If you have ever made a mistake it could take decades to rectify.
957243249743351808 2018-01-27 13:25:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TUSK81 @GETOUTTAHERE69 @Rachelherrera11 See here. There are actually very few legal immigration routes.https://americasvoice.org/blog/immigration-101-why-immigrants-cant-just-get-legal/

Last year, same place same industry, half my colleagues were lexiters. Anecdotal, of course, but I do wonder if things are palpably changing.

957222312654397442 2018-01-27 12:02:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Annaisaac @iwm21 Ha! Happens a lot though, sadly.
957221420500766721 2018-01-27 11:59:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Annaisaac @PandaPop2014 @DeanMor1arty I once had a guy scream at me in a supermarket because I didn't answer him when he asked where such and such was. I was at the other end of the aisle looking at a label and didn't even realize he was talking to me. No idea why he thought I worked there.
957220829603024896 2018-01-27 11:56:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Annaisaac @CswGeog @RosalindinKent Though I will say I'm often surprised to have hiked out (with the usual outdoor gear, extra water, etc) to an archaeological site that's open to the public to do some research, only to have some tourist turn up in wedge sandals and a sundress.
957218628767756288 2018-01-27 11:48:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Annaisaac @Blick_Oyinbo Don't know about you but people chat to me on public transport in London all the time. I guess I just look friendly?
957217176250998784 2018-01-27 11:42:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JacquiOatley @Annaisaac @FeedleFi @Eleanorbirdy Yes, definitely stop! I get the impulse, and generally I don't mind, but it reinforces the idea that women will naturally do all the "domestic" labour regardless of their position. Same thing w/baking cookies, bringing in cake, etc.
957215176939450369 2018-01-27 11:34:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @letclothesbe @LetToysBeToys @Annaisaac @Eleanorbirdy @PICKLES_71 @englishchick There's perhaps a bit of classism as well. My parents are from a small US Midwestern town; mom's parents were the only ones of their families to graduate high school. None of my relatives were the least bit surprised by the concept of professional women. Working class  sexist.
957213017061707776 2018-01-27 11:25:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Annaisaac @cliffsmith23 @_chrissydelishy @RickPoleway Indeed, it's OK to think that you don't normally see a woman doing x thing and ask what their role is. It's not OK to suggest that women can't or shouldn't do x thing, therefore the woman in question can't possibly be competent.
957212197515661312 2018-01-27 11:22:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Annaisaac @MattWingett @EmmaBlackman42 I repeatedly get asked if I'm a trainee or a volunteer by the other contractors on site (I'm an archaeologist working on commercial contracts). I'm 43 and have a PhD in the subject. Happens to many women archaeologists, even though we often outnumber the men on the crew!
957211429714780165 2018-01-27 11:19:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Annaisaac @Denmaryflo @runningwomble @thisfionaweir @QueenofTonga @arrowsmithlesl1 I follow in my mother's footsteps. She refused to iron my dad's Air Force uniforms or anything else. He took his clothes to the dry cleaners every week for the rest of his career. If you wanted something ironed you did it yourself.

956060870869741568 2018-01-23 07:07:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> I'm sorry to hear this. But honestly I've thought the same thing.
956060410402177025 2018-01-23 07:05:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @bessbell I'm pretty sure both Scotland and Germany were considered shitholes at the time my ancestors migrated. That's why they came to America, after all.

More seriously, I've just had the horrible thought that the religious right welcomes school shootings because it might encourage parents to take their kids out of public school.
955896364914835456 2018-01-23 20:13:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @joeflatman @CityWestminster @Tony_Robinson @ProfDanHicks @HistoricEngland @LeMoustier Oh I see. Depends on the actual work they are doing, I suppose, and what work has been done over time.
955540326697127937 2018-01-22 20:39:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> I nominate the guy I saw at the metro station last week wearing a leather vest festooned with neo-nazi slogans. #SuggestANewUKIPLeader
955538091229548544 2018-01-22 20:30:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @theipaper Sounds horrendous.
955531544227172352 2018-01-22 20:04:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Tony_Robinson @chazergra @Nunsleuth We're archaeologists. Tend to be on the bottom rung of the ladder.

955526115933736961 2018-01-22 19:42:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @canwejustbecool Honestly this seems kind of creepy.
955386314576334849 2018-01-22 10:27:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ajmpolite Not this remainer. And not in this form.
955346050423906304 2018-01-21 07:47:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CER_IanBond @FHeisbourg I had to learn the basics of how the EU works in order to become a citizen. Surely it's not too much to expect an elected representative to understand it as well.
955345233977454594 2018-01-21 07:43:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CER_IanBond @FHeisbourg People should be more upset. Indeed, after the referendum I was unhappy but thought we'd come up with something. It's the utterly un-serious, blisteringly incompetent way it's been handled that really angers me. There's no plan and no goal.
955335865978548225 2018-01-21 07:06:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @crafticarolyn Lycra is difficult. It's in everything, it seems.

955331588014985216 2018-01-21 06:49:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @FBI @thedailybeast @mememoreme @sacflies @ShelleyDeeeeee @gayleasher1 For real. I'm a liberal, I want to see the memo. If the people on "my team" are guilty of a crime then I want them prosecuted, too. I'm not so blindly partisan as to think that everyone on my side is a Saint.
955329347631665153 2018-01-21 06:40:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HuffPostUK What a nasty and small minded person he is. Shameful and backwards looking.

955089389620736009 2018-01-21 14:47:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @chandlerinitaly @riotwomennn @Juanse_23 @Wiezguy But as I learned more about the true history of race, I realized that I have to come to terms with my own internalized racism and privilege. Even very well meaning people like me still have unexamined biases, and we'll only overcome that with painful self-examination.
955088468081864704 2018-01-21 14:43:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @chandlerinitaly @riotwomennn @Juanse_23 @Wiezguy If my own experience is any indication, I once also felt angry that I was being lumped into the same category as openly racist white people. I didn't think I should feel any responsibility for my ancestors' actions.
955087913024458753 2018-01-21 14:41:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @chandlerinitaly @riotwomennn @Juanse_23 @Wiezguy Because there is a core identity issue that needs to be addressed. Pointing out that huge numbers of white women have basically voted to have our rights threatened is something that needs to be specifically addressed. Glossing it over with "shared ideas" keeps it buried.

955072664061833217 2018-01-21 13:40:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HelpfulOlive I'm a dual citizen so it's a hard choice, but we at least have a chance to counter trump soon. Brexit is far more damaging in the long term, with the current shower of incompetence.

955014099024392192 2018-01-21 09:47:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @riotwomennn @hillpersisted @tuckettweets "Not all white women" is just as problematic as "not all men".
955012128389332992 2018-01-21 09:40:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @chandlerinitaly @riotwomennn @Wiezguy @Juanse_23 Yes, and we white women need to face up to the fact that a minority of us voted for HRC. I did, and you did, but just being defensive is exactly the same kind of response as "not all men". Why do so many of us vote for GOP?
955006401188855808 2018-01-21 09:17:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nemanlostatsea A friend of mine feels the same. She's been staggered by the incompetence after brexit. Even though she was a leaver she's very unhappy with how it's been handled.
955002266305613824 2018-01-21 09:00:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mrjamesob @blematios @mybaldswede2 @petergerald I don't think dereliction of duty is a deterrent right now. The government and Parliament have both committed that on a grand scale already.

954393943017435136 2018-01-19 16:43:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mikefarb1 Only in Coulter's attention seeking mind. It doesn't even make sense, just a transparent attempt to manufacture outrage. Yawn.
953888061221457921 2018-01-17 07:13:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TheJackieBrook @AlisonMoyet I sure as hell don't, and I dgaf about everyone who will chime in with some sanctimonious "I don't see the point of swearing" nonsense.

953367222369517568 2018-01-16 20:43:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Brexit is self inflicted destruction. I want to #StopBrexit.
953363258530058241 2018-01-16 20:28:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @KEBrightbill Wow, that's horrible. I have to admit I am extremely skeptical about home schooling. I know it works for some but I think it would be very tightly regulated. So much potential for abuse.

951166923408072705 2018-01-10 19:00:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @barryjbutler @KelvyKelv It seemed like the right thing to do for many people.

950810482407038977 2018-01-09 19:24:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @drjanaway But this is a bit disingenuous because we only vote for our MP, not the PM.
950800620419764224 2018-01-09 18:45:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @aidanjmcg Utterly useless. All the criticism of him before the election still stands. I didn't support him then and I don't now.

949750095267983360 2018-01-06 21:10:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @itvnews We don't care about the gender of traffic signals, ffs. We want equal pay, opportunities, and to not be harassed at work and on the street.
949717237144973312 2018-01-06 19:00:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @slpng_giants Puuuuuuke.
949698534479147009 2018-01-06 17:45:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BrennanCenter @HovellingHermit Yep, but the stupid thing is that nobody sane can get into office without spending a ton of money as long as the other side is doing it, so it never changes.
949697356173398017 2018-01-06 17:41:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @cmclymer @_Angie_Head @cannibaldiet I have thought this too. Or a full on armed coup. The religious right would certainly welcome that, as they think it is their right to have dominion over all us heathens.

949692134432608256 2018-01-06 17:20:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @cmclymer @HugeFanOfThings @coach_sjkl For real. If he's this worried about people finding out he's secretly gay, well, welcome to the 21st century. Nobody sane cares.
949690754150039552 2018-01-06 17:14:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SykesCharlie @joshgreenman @MB3252 The entire GOP.
949679261048299521 2018-01-06 16:29:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RobynElyse @paytonrules @Revamp_Skunk This, a thousand times. It's the same reason why people stay with abusers, don't report assault, and stay in crappy jobs. They will get far worse in retaliation.
949676307574607874 2018-01-06 16:17:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @fromTGA @RCorbettMEP @IsolatedBrit @NealgodNeal If you have ideas, write them up & share them! Leaders won't pay attention to tweets but perhaps you could work with someone on creating resolutions that eventually go into a manifesto, for example.
949672318678323201 2018-01-06 16:01:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RVAwonk Does Bannon have a stake in the publisher or something?
949669460264259584 2018-01-06 15:50:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @fromTGA @RCorbettMEP @IsolatedBrit @NealgodNeal I'm doing what I can by getting involved in my party and helping with campaigns etc. What about you?
949666464906252293 2018-01-06 15:38:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @dailykos Hell, I'm American and I'm a bit nervous about visiting my family these days. What's appealing about visiting a place that seems to be full of xenophobic, gun-toting maniacs and cops that can take all your possessions if they claim they might be used in a crime?
949663941189390337 2018-01-06 15:28:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @fromTGA @RCorbettMEP @IsolatedBrit @NealgodNeal Sounds great but I'm not sure Labour is interested right now.
949650913723146240 2018-01-06 14:36:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Amy_Siskind @realdrumpfdon @EricGOALS For real. Almost is extremely optimistic. I'm at the point of thinking we won't even have elections at all this year.
949648468712329216 2018-01-06 14:26:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Amy_Siskind Indeed that's a big part of why I'm quite skeptical about this book. It's Clinton Cash for liberals. It might all be true but it's so sensationalized that I don't trust any of it. A massive distraction.
949647532883435521 2018-01-06 14:23:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NHSMillion She's PROUD of people dying while waiting 4 hours for an ambulance? For canceled surgeries year after year? For patients filling hospital corridors because there's no place to discharge them to? The utter lack of compassion is astounding and sickening.
949397820724994048 2018-01-05 21:50:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NatashaBertrand @samstein @SarahPieczy1 They don't forget, they never cared in the first place. It's about imposing their will and extracting benefits for themselves, not serving the public.
949396749185101824 2018-01-05 21:46:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JimmyRushmore True but after last summer's pointless exercise I wouldn't assume anything.
949372076690984962 2018-01-05 20:08:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JimmyRushmore I suppose, but since the Tories are generally in a precarious situation right now I expect them to hang together more. Will be interesting to see what if any cabinet reshuffle takes place.
949371593909788672 2018-01-05 20:06:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Piss off, perhaps, or say they are taking the Mickey. It will be interesting to see what response this gets, if any, from the UK.
949371032355442689 2018-01-05 20:04:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JimmyRushmore But is Rudd likely to contradict May if she wanted it to happen?
949369694179479552 2018-01-05 19:59:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JimmyRushmore Depends on how desperate for brexit trade deals she gets.
949368962940375041 2018-01-05 19:56:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ChuckGrasssley @LindseyGrahamSC @mkraju @JaceLGalloway I'm curious about what jurisdiction they have. I know nothing of such things; would they be asking the UK for extradition?
949368235094355969 2018-01-05 19:53:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @1daywithoutus @MrsEmmaJK But back then it didn't seem hostile or dangerous. People just thought I was a bit stupid, which didn't bother me. Now I feel like I don't really know the place at all, after 13 years.
949367902410506240 2018-01-05 19:52:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @1daywithoutus @MrsEmmaJK I found it surprisingly alien when I moved here. As an American with a bit of a thing for British music, comedy, etc I thought it would be really easy to integrate, but things like transportation, local accents, shop names & hours, etc really threw me.
949366356364931072 2018-01-05 19:45:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @UKLabour @MaldenSaboteur I was only briefly a proper member but I left in 2016. I won't be back.
949364810810122240 2018-01-05 19:39:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @davidfrum @Bayeux188Lonnie Pretty sure we're well down that road right now.
949360002082406403 2018-01-05 19:20:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SethAbramson @viacampmimi @sandibachom Because she is who she is. Unreliable and deluded at best, probably far more sinister.
949335653468303360 2018-01-05 17:43:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @brianklaas Yeah I think I have missed something here...
949335153305882626 2018-01-05 17:41:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EdwardTHardy @MB3252 I'm just confused how this book enriches Bannon. Did he fund its publication or have a stake in the publisher or something?
949331537975267328 2018-01-05 17:27:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GrantJKidney I'm no trump supporter but I am extremely dubious about this book.
949329623405551617 2018-01-05 17:19:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @daretothink53 @johntomkiw @ct5062342connie @sbohs315 @TrapperDan3 I also find it highly implausible that he would know which amendment is which without prompting. I mean, neither do I, but I'm not involved in legislation.
949287705808195585 2018-01-05 14:33:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @kushkandy95 @hemantmehta Good grief. Such hyperventilating hyperbole.
949280137534754817 2018-01-05 14:03:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EdwardTHardy @MB3252 How does it enrich Bannon? I've missed that part.
949278959677689856 2018-01-05 13:58:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ThePlumLineGS These people are so transparent. It's shocking that so much of the country is stupid enough to believe this, and proud of that stupidity.
949278480272850945 2018-01-05 13:56:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ToryFibs @hotnews____ Vicious little brats. I don't buy their story at all.
949277707426287617 2018-01-05 13:53:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RATR2016 @ToryFibs Yes, much in the same way that they chose to undergo various life disasters, or people choose to be born in a particular country or with a given skin colour, or choose to have disabilities.
949274749556940802 2018-01-05 13:41:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @peterdaou Are you just now realizing this?
949207244687708160 2018-01-05 09:13:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> I'm actually highly suspicious of the veracity of many of the things Wolff has written, satisfying as they are (in that gossipy way). It seems far too perfect and tailored to liberal outrage.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/01/03/michael-wolffs-unbelievable-sometimes-literally-tell-all-about-the-trump-administration/
949202054555340800 2018-01-05 08:52:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AdamBienkov He's such a pompous twit.
949193547957325824 2018-01-05 08:19:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HuffPost @VVerdone The Republican Party is long gone, my friend. They lost their mind when the Tea Party took over.
949193205819629569 2018-01-05 08:17:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HuffPost @mrm2222 I think you're right. trump is not the architect of any of this; he's both the figurehead and the mark. His narcissistic personality means he craves the flattery, yet he either can't or doesn't want to see that he's being manipulated. His apparent mental health issues don't help.
949084690987802624 2018-01-04 01:06:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LadyLiberty411 Damn. 
949002697834889219 2018-01-04 19:40:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mattresstagging @docrocktex26 I think, though, that other people are using those strategies to guide his responses. I don't think trump is the mastermind at all (if there even is one).
948997817191759872 2018-01-04 19:21:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DJSugi @C_Stroop I'm very glad that you are! I was only ever on the very fringes, but I have become fascinated by the subject ever since I stumbled across your work.
948938906841559040 2018-01-04 15:27:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SKZCartoons @Pro4TLZZ Welcome to the club Bilal!
948920462482071553 2018-01-04 14:14:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IvankaTrump @Dr_CMGreer @hardball @KDavisGayFriend That and stealing other people's designs and having ridiculously vapid books ghost written.
948919929864155136 2018-01-04 14:11:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Wow, you block people when they have criticisms about your programming?https://twitter.com/YesYoureRacist/status/948918896114982912
948919303558098944 2018-01-04 14:09:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PeterAlexander @Barbistall Yep. I'm positive he won't hesitate to disavow them all, except he might shed a tear while he shoves Ivanka down.
948918870861139970 2018-01-04 14:07:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PeterAlexander @LilCalamityJane @tonydiaz777 @margret0229 What's the deadline for announcing you are running for president?

948916770647265280 2018-01-04 13:59:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PressSec @JenniferJJacobs @windcph That's my question too. Is security generally this lax? Seems like it should be standard practice to have people with access to high level officials using only secure gov't issued devices.
948899686974357504 2018-01-04 12:51:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BBCr4today He's totally right.
948898793780600832 2018-01-04 12:47:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ProEuUk @LoobyLou22222 Good grief. These people are utterly ridiculous. Stamps, passports, crowns on pint glasses are worth destroying our position in the world and our economy? Such narrow minded, petty concerns.
948898202585063424 2018-01-04 12:45:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SimonFRCox Coming soon to America as well.
948898037656678401 2018-01-04 12:44:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @stevesilberman So, is Carson going to run for office in his own right sometime soon? That would be great.
948895796400975872 2018-01-04 12:36:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SethAbramson Let's hope the rest of us don't follow.
948892158601424896 2018-01-04 12:21:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MarieAnnUK What a stupid question. No, of course not. We remain advocates do our cause no good if we promote divisive messages like this.
948888462081609729 2018-01-04 12:06:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sturdyAlex @TheHipsterRebbe Jesus. This is horrifying.
948726000170557440 2018-01-03 01:21:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DJSugi @C_Stroop I had some inkling of this in the 90s but I stopped going to the crazy church and put out of my mind. Even though I grew up in one of the epicenters of this emerging threat I was oblivious to how dangerous it is. I wish I'd learned more sooner.
948716894772760582 2018-01-03 00:45:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid @CathyPegau They don't care about anything except money.
948690476282056705 2018-01-03 23:00:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDems Hell I'd happily pay 5p, or even a small copay.
948687115843522561 2018-01-03 22:46:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DancingTheMind #HuntMustGo
948495609916510208 2018-01-03 10:05:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TomthunkitsMind @Lou_Wade70 Yeah I think we have shown that we have a hell of a lot of deeply stupid people.
948491247852965888 2018-01-03 09:48:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Twitter @GeorgeLakoff @katiedlm @edcracknell Yeah I don't see the point of deleting his account. But I don't think "no platforming" is a good idea in any sphere.
948490783887384576 2018-01-03 09:46:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @indivisiblestl @GeorgeLakoff @jenesq2 @JanewayPi Also he has smart people working for him, even if not directly. Remember that he is a symptom, not the disease. He didn't create this movement, he was recruited to it.
948483282131353600 2018-01-03 09:16:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JRubinBlogger He was perfectly willing to grovel to trump for the chance of a cabinet position. I don't think he will stand up to anything.
948350554165665794 2018-01-02 00:29:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> There is a very confused blackbird singing outside my window. It's half past midnight.
948348642703835136 2018-01-02 00:21:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> These are amazing!https://twitter.com/i/moments/948294421996621824
948339091602632706 2018-01-02 23:43:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @laureneoneal My favorite. I'm almost sad to catch up because then I'll have to wait for the next episode. But it's fun and feeds my completely weird and unexpected new obsession with Christianity.
948338521387032576 2018-01-02 23:41:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @laureneoneal Undoubtedly.
948338293250326533 2018-01-02 23:40:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NancAdimora @jasonpinter @damidude @OneWordLong Don't know why they'd think any such thing. He's just a whining toddler trying to stir up shit, there is no legitimate thought there.
948334117887840256 2018-01-02 23:24:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @elamin88 Pretty sure Star Wars has always had a social justice theme
948324924946558976 2018-01-02 22:47:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @langernutrition @torlack Yeah I bet Soros paid you to say that 
948316654324379649 2018-01-02 22:14:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SamSanderson123 @darionavarro111 They believe that they are invulnerable due to gerrymandering and voter suppression.
948279122769432576 2018-01-02 19:45:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @STLTribune @JoyAnnReid @thatianaviana I know, I'm so confused! What about the Supreme Court Marshall? 
948276158549909504 2018-01-02 19:33:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenKamalaHarris And further, many of us white people really need to accept and deal with the reality that we are in some ways both the beneficiaries of racism and complicit in propagating it. I accept that it is often unintentional but we need to examine ourselves & the ideas we've absorbed.
948199563457974272 2018-01-02 14:29:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sox_morgan @matthewjdowd Made fewer people want to travel to the US, thus generating less air traffic?
948126075942469632 2018-01-02 09:37:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @kylegriffin1 It just shows how poor computer and IT literacy, especially when it comes to security, can lead to much bigger problems than you think. I won't be surprised if this ends up being related to phishing or similar practices.
948121769575092225 2018-01-02 09:20:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @vincecable @LBC And this is exactly why I support it both here & in my home state of Colorado. I don't consume it any more but I believe that it would have a big impact on crime if recreational drugs were legally produced & regulated.
948121013564387328 2018-01-02 09:17:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @lesleyanne14 Welcome to the party! Happy to have anyone who can see what a massive mistake this was, though I can in truth understand the impulse to vote against Cameron and the completely unresponsive government.
948119131303436288 2018-01-02 09:09:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @UKLabour @Labour4EU Well no. I'll never vote labour again. But I do support your efforts in the abstract.
948117988208717826 2018-01-02 09:05:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid Of course he was.
948117145409540096 2018-01-02 09:01:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> This thread explains why, although I think #FBPE is a somewhat useful identifier, I have not adopted it nor do I simply follow everyone with that tag in their name.https://twitter.com/MikeH_PR/status/948107195455082496
948116357127790592 2018-01-02 08:58:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Amy_Siskind @JD_Uppal It ain't gonna be white women. As a group we white women seem to be much more racist and misogynist than I ever knew.
948115340776656896 2018-01-02 08:54:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Amy_Siskind @Itisgrave Racism, mostly, and a very twisted view of their religion. But I'm hoping there is a good study out there.
948112412745584646 2018-01-02 08:43:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Amy_Siskind Well that and stop supporting those who are hurting us. I'd love to read a good study of the self-harming phenomenon that is white evangelical anti-feminist women.
948109850084593664 2018-01-02 08:32:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @kurteichenwald Have you heard the phrase "new apostolic reformation"? Many of the non-denominational church leaders literally believe that they are prophets/apostles discovering new teachings, which is where some of their ideas come from. https://bereanresearch.org/dominionism-nar/
947987723721281536 2018-01-01 00:27:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @laureneoneal It's remarkable how little I drank last year, considering how depressed and despairing I was.
947811598005080068 2018-01-01 12:47:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @fastcarspete I'm a foreigner and I have a PhD so I guess that makes me a liberal elite. Too bad my bank account doesn't reflect that. Nor does my residence in Gateshead...
947622392410583042 2017-12-31 00:15:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Well, to my great surprise we have mostly survived 2017. Hope 2018 is a better year.
947494284172972033 2017-12-31 15:46:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUflagmafia Went by too quickly for a photo but spotted two tiny EU flags on a road sign near Winchester this afternoon.
947400733837725697 2017-12-31 09:35:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Good job, Colorado! Making me proud over here in England!https://twitter.com/i/moments/947211114525478912
947087417261068288 2017-12-30 12:50:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nytmike @nytimes This is why I haven't bothered subscribing. You've done some good work but trump is right in a way: you are failing. Failing to be adequately critical and challenging the nonsense as it appears.
946892642855587841 2017-12-29 23:56:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IvanTheTerabyte @ExcelPope He's utterly unreadable now.

946719938395459584 2017-12-29 12:29:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump Uh, the US is not the only country spending money to try and mitigate global warming.
946509342332813313 2017-12-28 22:33:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sunschooldrop Cool. I started "How Jesus Became God" but I'm only on chapter 2. It's a weirdly fascinating subject.
946501327168864256 2017-12-28 22:01:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @surfbordt @Whirledpeas4u4m Ha! I try to know as little as possible about these people but this sounds very funny.
946496596279209991 2017-12-28 21:42:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @surfbordt @Whirledpeas4u4m It's such a cruel lie. I don't get Soros money and I don't get free chocolate for being fat, either? The world is so cruel!
946496275565903873 2017-12-28 21:41:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @surfbordt @SuzeMarsupial Uh, showing that milo is really upset? Dunno.
946491330041085957 2017-12-28 21:21:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JamilSmith Yup. I thought Simon & Schuster were better than that.
946490758848057344 2017-12-28 21:19:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erstkate Rather different results depending on whether I pick the left, right, or middle suggestions.
946490606213353472 2017-12-28 21:18:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erstkate I am a profoundly irritating person because I am a bit of a library and I am not a fan of Internet vigilantes and I am not sure if I am able to get it as I am not able to grab my phone on my phone and I have a friend who is on the phone to me and I am not sure if you have any
946490432430706689 2017-12-28 21:17:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erstkate I am a profoundly irritating person because of my work in life sciences at university I would not like it if it were Spanish to the university into a different course or something for me and the university of my parents who had never had any problems or issues in it
946490150292475905 2017-12-28 21:16:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erstkate I am a profoundly irritating person because I am not a fan of Internet marketing but I have a lot more experience in this area of the industry than I am not a fan of it is the fact that I am just reading an email and I have not been able for a long long long wait to get back
946488998696050689 2017-12-28 21:12:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Taniel @ddbetty We got the alien lizard people to beam them in to the polling booths. Super easy.

946400581786259456 2017-12-28 15:20:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @funder By far. He's unpresidented.
946346486874374144 2017-12-28 11:45:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @doctor_oxford It's absolutely worth every penny of my taxes to have the NHS. So sorry for your loss.
946344645704986625 2017-12-28 11:38:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sunschooldrop Just listened to the Titus episode. I for one would looove a podcast about how the modern Bible came to be. Or failing that read a book on it. Any suggestions?
946088176652713984 2017-12-27 18:39:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @weirdnameblog @harmfulkid I really wish I knew. Shit like this is why I'm not that comfortable calling myself a feminist. And I think it's a big part of the white woman anti-feminist backlash.
946086830721699842 2017-12-27 18:34:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @YourCentristDad Welcome to the club! I wanted to implement some changes, but I thought that being influential members with an upcoming stint as leaders would have been a great opportunity to do just that.
946085730744438784 2017-12-27 18:29:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @frankieboyle I might actually watch the racing if that were the case.
946085401911062528 2017-12-27 18:28:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LucyLu_Life So sorry for your loss. It's extra tough when these things happen on holidays when there's so much pressure to be cheerful.
945993510955700229 2017-12-27 12:23:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidCornDC @douglasritz @raphaelha67 trump Jr? He was just a volunteer, hardly knew the guy, wouldn't recognize him on the street.
945730420699570177 2017-12-26 18:57:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CNNPolitics It's really easy to declare victory in a war that never existed.
945650479220043776 2017-12-26 13:40:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AndreaChalupa @justinhendrix Best description ever.
945624096372658176 2017-12-26 11:55:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RealJamesWoods Basically, who gives a crap? It's not like being a Muslim is a crime anyway.
945471151559585792 2017-12-25 01:47:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump Season's Greetings.

945266573362769920 2017-12-25 12:14:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @code_slinger @RWPUSA Sorry, didn't realize I'd tagged you too! I meant that just for Mr Painter.
945263855340589056 2017-12-25 12:03:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TookEnglandBack It pains us immigrants greatly to see the place we loved enough to sacrifice our comfort to belong here sold so cheaply. Throwing away international influence & decades of a reputation as a fair & open-minded country for the sake of a blue passport is staggeringly short sighted.
945262736795226112 2017-12-25 11:59:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TookEnglandBack On the contrary those of us who chose a new country & endured financial hardships, the pain of leaving friends and family far away, the effort of learning new culture & language, etc have a love of the UK that you who grew up here & take it for granted can never understand.
945106081109479424 2017-12-24 01:37:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JamesWillby On the whole we kinda are, since this piece of shit is still sold here.
945105619106885632 2017-12-24 01:35:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @code_slinger @RWPUSA Why, if you are a decent person, haven't you left yet? This is not news.
945105129803603975 2017-12-24 01:33:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ddale8 @onlyLindaColyer @btrykoveech Because nobody ever has. Maybe a handful of extremists but I've hung out with Muslims, Hindus, Wiccans, atheists, Jews, etc and have never heard a single one express any desire to stop people saying merry Christmas.

945051047000670209 2017-12-24 21:58:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sharnatweets I'd like to send Lynne another beer, and a gift bag.
945050436498796550 2017-12-24 21:55:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Happy to welcome anyone who has reconsidered! Merry Christmas.
944998869577986048 2017-12-24 18:31:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Had half a pint earlier. Very nice! Now I know where to go on Christmas Eve!https://twitter.com/LadyGreysbar/status/944921581779898370
944978997900963841 2017-12-24 17:12:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @kinglolux @kathrynw5 @ThankYouBob44 @MechWarriorNY I'm deeply agnostic but I really hope there is a God.
944973157227749378 2017-12-24 16:48:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @kathrynw5 @connected_view @Nbrooks311 @estee_nj I really don't understand the attitude of many people. My tax dollars reap far greater benefits through paying for collective projects than anything I could get as an individual. And I really don't care if a few of those dollars go to someone who doesn't "deserve" it.
944562075258540032 2017-12-23 13:35:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @dadwroteaporno OMG. I'm catching up on season 2 (the Dr Robbins bit) and yikes. Completely disgusting! I'm trying to make a pie for Christmas and trying not to puke!
944532999206514688 2017-12-23 11:39:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NightOwlsNE The music. I hate hearing the same five songs in multiple awful versions in every shop and on every radio station. I know, I'm Scrooge!

944313134738759680 2017-12-22 21:06:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @marcorubio Repeal this idiotic tax bill and do it over with proper debates and actual logic.
944243097659166720 2017-12-22 16:27:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MatthewGreen02 @HistoryMaker316 Fabulous letter. Welcome to the party!

944240834102415360 2017-12-22 16:18:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @theresa_may @ToddDForeman @ScrewBrexit Well we are now financially entangled here, owning property and building careers here, etc. Back when we thought about moving to Brussels we were just getting started. I'm looking out for opportunities but it's not that easy to just leave.
944240268223635456 2017-12-22 16:16:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @martinkettle @DamianGreen @SophieRunning @JudeNicho @BristolBen Well in reality I don't care that much about him looking at porn. I think it's inappropriate (and deeply un-sexy) to do it at work, but the thing that shocked me in this whole affair is the ridiculously lax computer security that Dorries was describing as a defense.
944207221684088832 2017-12-22 14:05:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> #WriteABrexitSectorReport  Higher Education:  We have a lot of very famous universities and people come from all over the world to study at them. But because those people are foreign they are bad and we shouldn't let them in. Universities teach you to think and that's bad too.
944205892282671105 2017-12-22 14:00:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> #WriteABrexitSectorReport  Heritage:  We have lots of old things like buildings and Stonehenge. People like them because they are cool and you can learn about the past. That's called heritage. People like it except when it stops them building new ugly things.
944203423934828544 2017-12-22 13:50:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @theresa_may @ToddDForeman @clivesinclair So why strip ourselves of the privilege of being able to move to another country without that hassle, expense, constraint on our lives, and sheer stress?
944203013262135298 2017-12-22 13:48:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @theresa_may @ToddDForeman You and me both. I would not have bothered to become a citizen and get involved in civic life here if I'd had any idea this would happen. My British husband wanted to move to Brussels, we should have acted on that.
944192449370521600 2017-12-22 13:06:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @martinkettle @DamianGreen @SophieRunning @JudeNicho @BristolBen *not because
944192373466324992 2017-12-22 13:06:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @martinkettle @DamianGreen @SophieRunning @JudeNicho @BristolBen That's not the point. I'd get fired for this, but because my boss cares about porn, but because it would be misusing company resources and using work time for personal activities.
944191535272353792 2017-12-22 13:02:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tallsam @JulietMEvans @eff_evans Well, voting for another party is how those parties improve their influence. At this point does it really matter if we have Labour or Tories since they are all voting the same way?
944191021390417920 2017-12-22 13:00:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JulietMEvans I'll never vote labour again.
944189993324605440 2017-12-22 12:56:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @martinkettle @DamianGreen @SophieRunning @JudeNicho @BristolBen Really? Nobody is saying that porn is bad, just that you shouldn't look at it at work. The issue is more that you should be, you know, working while you're at work, not wanking.
944189642823389184 2017-12-22 12:55:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @martinkettle @DamianGreen @WEP_UK @SophieRunning For crying out loud. Porn is super easy to find but I have restraint to not look at it at work. Heaven forbid we expect professionals to, you know, act professional.
944189033571405824 2017-12-22 12:53:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RichardAske @Wlleiotl @mikeyd105 Sigh. I don't think I am the one looking foolish here, since you are the one saying that people campaigning to stop brexit oppose democracy. The way you voted yourself is immaterial. But expecting people to meekly accept something they find harmful is anti-democratic.
944188160514371584 2017-12-22 12:49:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AndrewRosindell @Otto_English @Selfvertroue91 @lnhys @BrexitBin @Izitpajn I don't even think it will be One. Maybe Ten or Twelve.
944167383735914496 2017-12-22 11:27:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JaneEJuanita I seriously think that would work on a whole lot of people. Make the question on the next referendum "should we bring back blue passports and cancel brexit, or keep burgundy passports and crash out" and I'd bet that option A wins in a landslide.
944166208248655872 2017-12-22 11:22:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RichardAske @Wlleiotl @mikeyd105 Yes, you are. By implying that those of us who have an opposite view lost our right to express that view as a result of the referendum.
944165232271818752 2017-12-22 11:18:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AndrewRosindell @Otto_English @Selfvertroue91 @lnhys Funny thing is though, my American passport is about the same colour, so to me this makes the UK look even more like it's trying to be a vassal state to the US.
944164749729783808 2017-12-22 11:16:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AndrewRosindell Who honestly cares what colour their passport is? I mean really. What an appallingly stupid thing to care about enough to destroy the economy over.
943975222893572096 2017-12-21 22:43:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JuddLegum Heaven forbid citizens make their opinions known by choosing the candidate they prefer.
943826468446048256 2017-12-21 12:52:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MrFilmkritik @callmehobbit @WThestral Totally yes. Steel toe boots and a sensible hat.
943825751656280064 2017-12-21 12:49:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MrFilmkritik Also, can we get a montage of her writing up all the research and staying up late to revise and resubmit the articles?
943825263149936641 2017-12-21 12:47:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @cathytown @MrFilmkritik @WendyBrandes I'd totally buy the DVD
943825066357379073 2017-12-21 12:46:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MrFilmkritik As an archaeologist I would much rather see this film than any of the Indiana Jones ones. I never thought much of him & he was not my inspiration to study archaeology at all.
943798928876691456 2017-12-21 11:02:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @shannonrwatts I sure hope so.
943792565719007238 2017-12-21 10:37:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HoarseWisperer Sadly as a dual US-UK citizen I'm not actually sure which country this applies to at first glance.
943792198566412295 2017-12-21 10:36:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @FrancesRobles This is entirely unacceptable and yet nobody in power cares at all. My only hope is that somehow this disaster and outrage leads to Puerto Rico becoming a state, or at least gaining proper representation in Congress.
943789010962538496 2017-12-21 10:23:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @stevesilberman Was Pence actually on his knees and that's why we can only see the top of his head? What a disgusting display of abasement.
943787979818102785 2017-12-21 10:19:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @UKLabour @dontbrexitfixit And people will whine about tuition fees, but shrug their shoulders at this.
943625819347406848 2017-12-20 23:35:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @cologop That's completely asinine. Corporate leaders have already indicated that they are not likely to invest the money they save in expanding operations. Trickle down economics is thoroughly discredited.
943623841275838465 2017-12-20 23:27:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BrexshitTrade Once again, we told everyone so. Sigh.
943623612963180545 2017-12-20 23:26:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @thehill @RobertInSC @marialuisascott @lisano1 Honestly I think they are beyond redemption. I certainly despair.
943622920550612993 2017-12-20 23:23:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @KateHoeyMP Anger is one thing. Irrational hatred and threats are quite another.
943622524146999296 2017-12-20 23:21:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Are these for real? They are insane but I kind of love them.  Then again it's the sort of crazy that only a spoiled rich kid can get away with.https://www.thecut.com/2017/12/wyatt-koch-shirt-line-wyatt-ingraham-video.html
943564201745895424 2017-12-20 19:30:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @thehill @RobertInSC @marialuisascott It's so completely obvious though. That's what I don't get. He's been a joke and the epitome of a shady, untrustworthy businessman for decades. Why would anyone ever trust him?
943561862796505091 2017-12-20 19:20:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jeremycorbyn Support Amendment 120 to the withdrawal bill. We the people want a final say on Brexit.
943515315551588353 2017-12-20 16:15:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sunschooldrop Just listened to the Colossians episode, and found this page about the gory St Asaph crucifix: http://www.nakedchrist.co.uk
943473291897065472 2017-12-20 13:28:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Amy_Siskind @LilithResists Even the old testament god would not recognise them.
943472494102622209 2017-12-20 13:25:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Amy_Siskind Because their God is not the same one that others are worshipping. The GOP is in thrall to utter heretics.
943402041874972672 2017-12-20 08:45:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nickreeves9876 I think she's very xenophobic. The home office got increasingly nasty under her direction.
943055475247079424 2017-12-19 09:48:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jeremycorbyn Dear @JeremyCorbyn, please ask your MPs to back amendment 120 to the EU Withdrawal Bill tomorrow and give the British people the final say on Brexit. https://www.libdems.org.uk/exit-brexit #ExitFromBrexit

943037630865952768 2017-12-19 08:37:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @20committee @TawdryOtter @independent_r21 @Zluing40 I'm thinking some kind of strong hallucinogens. How else does he come up with those insane stories?
942906045344645120 2017-12-18 23:54:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Amtrak @8NewsNow This is just horrifying. I look forward to finding out what happened. I take trains travelling much faster all the time in Europe.

942739748690546688 2017-12-18 12:54:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @neeratanden Of course. They know their position was nonsense. Hypocrisy is the name of the game.

942716843290226688 2017-12-18 11:23:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AnneRiceAuthor Reinstate the fairness doctrine for one. And penalties for deliberate lying. Severe ones, career ending ones.

Lovely hard cash flowing to people who are exploiting and abusing their workers.

942708229854855168 2017-12-18 10:48:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @StevePeers @MarkPendleton @Chairman_Slough I suspect the bad employers are the ones lining their pockets...

942698167681896448 2017-12-18 10:08:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LesterHoltNBC @realDonaldTrump @RepSwalwell Huh. Maybe he should have thought of that before making extremely public statements.

942691504765702144 2017-12-18 09:42:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CaraOriel @mkraju @PolitiksAside Thing is, nobody read it. It wasn't even made available and amendments were nothing but handwritten comments in the margins. No lawmaker should accept the kind of high pressure, high secrecy tactics that are being used, no matter what they think of the bill.
942690725350830082 2017-12-18 09:39:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mkraju Hmm, maybe they should have demanded to have an actual bill with debates and things actually typed up, not just scrawled in the margins?

I find it weird that so many pretend that those of us who are Democrats think everyone on "our side" is totally innocent and flawless. Obviously that's not true and no sensible person thinks so.

942317069919547392 2017-12-17 08:54:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DailyMailUK @sarahwollaston @AEcelson Indeed. Perhaps this matter should be taken up with the Tory Party leadership.

941645121350701057 2017-12-15 12:24:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @deray @YungChevre @SecondContArmy So states can change their laws as they see fit but "the law is the law" and liberals are wrong to advocate for changing laws they disagree with. OK. Laws change because people ask that they be changed.
941644727400747008 2017-12-15 12:22:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @deray @YungChevre @SecondContArmy I am arguing that not all crimes that are classed as felonies should be felonies. And not all of them have victims, nor are they violent. It infringes on the rights of a human when they are stripped of rights for crimes that are not serious.
941643812258140160 2017-12-15 12:19:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @deray @YungChevre @SecondContArmy I think it's immoral to make petty offences like possessing small quantities of drugs or trespassing on a construction site felonies that strip you of your rights. Show me one person who hasn't screwed up in one way or another.
941642925829705728 2017-12-15 12:15:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @deray @YungChevre @SecondContArmy If a law is bad or immoral it should be changed. It was once legal to own and murder other humans. It was once legal to rape your wife. It was once illegal to marry someone of a different race. It was once illegal to make or drink alcohol.
941642188886245376 2017-12-15 12:12:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @deray @YungChevre @SecondContArmy I'm sure there are many involved in efforts like this in Florida, because some really absurd things are felonies there. Not all felonies are violent.http://www.orlandosentinel.com/g00/news/politics/political-pulse/os-florida-felon-voting-rights-petition-20170703-story.html?i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvLnVrLw%3D%3D&i10c.ua=1
941641385689665537 2017-12-15 12:09:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @deray @YungChevre @SecondContArmy And the proposed process in Florida, for instance, does not include people who commit murder or sexual offences.https://www.floridiansforafairdemocracy.com/about2
941638855240900608 2017-12-15 11:59:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @deray @YungChevre @SecondContArmy Here is a random list I found of 20 common felonies in the US. Do you think that selling alcohol to a minor warrants losing your voting rights forever? Being in possession of stolen property even if you are not the thief?https://www.schatzanderson.com/information-and-resources/20-common-felony-crimes-u-s/
941637648296398853 2017-12-15 11:54:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @deray @YungChevre @SecondContArmy And conversely many victims are not that vengeful.

When you have a case where you were clearly wronged but the judge is so ignorant of the law that they rule against you, remember your support for this.
941635445045293056 2017-12-15 11:45:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @bayofarizona @zellieimani @GlobalAffairs4U Sure, but even if poor and dysfunctional white families are featured on a news segment it's almost always in a sympathetic light.
941634752788008960 2017-12-15 11:43:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @deray @SecondContArmy @YungChevre If you've served your sentence then your rights should be restored. Permanent disenfranchisement is a disproportionate sentence, and I think cruel and unusual.

I'm grateful, but the rest of us need to step up and pay it back by supporting POC, helping with get out the vote and ID efforts, and pushing back against this cult if we are Christians.

941298050991116289 2017-12-14 13:25:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JustineBateman @lisac1965 @nissenson In the good old days you might get a letter from an old friend once or twice in a lifetime. Now I can keep in touch with people scattered all over the globe. I can reach out and make friends in a new place, or find like minded people to chat to even though I'll never meet them.

I can send documents instantly.  I can work anywhere, including rural areas where my income then indirectly supports other businesses because it's where I spend my money.

941294083452043266 2017-12-14 13:09:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JustineBateman @cosmosbaby @wendyrama But does that actually work? My home city only has one telephone company, the rural town my grandmother lives in only one internet provider. My parents live in a medium sized city and there is only one cable company that provides service to their neighborhood already.

940928444833128448 2017-12-13 12:56:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MuslimIQ @Hazam_13 Ah, I see. I'll have to look this up. I'm just starting to read more about contemporary religion. Thanks for the tip!
940904263651381248 2017-12-13 11:20:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jaketapper @jason_howerton @irRESISTablePA I don't think you need a book at all. It's just tradition.

940870551760982016 2017-12-13 09:06:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MuslimIQ @Hazam_13 "Political Christians" is such a great turn of phrase.
940870268460961792 2017-12-13 09:05:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MuslimIQ @almaniaci @lexiingram I'd definitely swear on that.

940868041499447296 2017-12-13 08:56:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Keir_Starmer And yet the Labour Party is slavishly following the government's plans at every turn. You are no opposition.
940867544830889985 2017-12-13 08:54:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jaketapper @jason_howerton @irRESISTablePA There's just so much funny. The blinking stare, the "Muslim Bible", the premise that you have to swear on a Christian Bible to take office in the first place...
940858229323698176 2017-12-13 08:17:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mikefarb1 Have you all seen @VoteRiders ? I don't know that much about them but one thing they do is help people get ID for voting. Worth supporting.
940856899708301312 2017-12-13 08:12:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @WeAreOneEU Curious how their hatred of "globalists" leads to them supporting the hyper-rich whose business and financial ties are thoroughly global, yet dressed in a transparently false patriotism and populism.

940492504872480768 2017-12-12 08:04:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NHAparty Good grief. I worked for Anthem 20 years ago and it was just as bad then. I'd kind of hoped it would have improved since then. But yeah, take it from an American: you don't want our system. The NHS is wonderful by comparison.

933646554426200065 2017-11-23 10:40:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Christmas number one?
933641929933443072 2017-11-23 10:22:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BrexitBin Good points. Perhaps someone with influence will take your feedback on board.
933641622079856640 2017-11-23 10:21:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Useful feedback. Can we take it on board? @LibDems @LibDemPress @LibDemNewswire @vincecable @RadicalAssoc @markpackhttps://twitter.com/BrexitBin/status/933603509903208450
933640370570788864 2017-11-23 10:16:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid @Sifill_LDF @jeffmorgan1967 I don't think you can tackle either in isolation. They have common roots. So while it course sexual harassment is not exclusive to white men by any means, I think that the white supremacist mindset includes a view that men are superior.
933627571807322117 2017-11-23 09:25:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ananavarro @NewDay A bit late for that. Sexual assault, forcing yourself on vulnerable women and girls, and general domineering and harassment *are* the family values being promoted. Anything that keeps women down and in a position of dependence.
933621756874641409 2017-11-23 09:02:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid @Sifill_LDF @jeffmorgan1967 False dichotomy, really. They are equally bad and intimately intertwined. Spend an hour or so reading "meninist" sites or "return of kings" and the sense of entitlement will be obvious. If you are actually willing to see it, of course.
933620661859373056 2017-11-23 08:58:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AngryBlackLady @Sifill_LDF @Gerontia I'm sure it is much, much bigger. And how many times have you heard black people's stories dismissed as "political correctness", "reverse racism", "ungrateful", etc?
933619895383810048 2017-11-23 08:55:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid @Sifill_LDF @stevenszoe1980 I'm infuriated on your behalf.
933477976657809408 2017-11-22 23:31:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @inkcoffee @Freeyourmindkid Oh for Pete's sake. They probably call themselves "woke" too. Or made a funny joke about that because coffee, you know.
933477196362145793 2017-11-22 23:28:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUflagmafia That wreath is amazing. I need one for my in laws.
933409424982585346 2017-11-22 18:58:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ChiefCovfefe @OliviaResists @RebeccaBMackie @KHCReal @sheLLbeLL_xo @roboman8va Why cling to an opinion that is contradicted by readily available evidence?
933407743834312704 2017-11-22 18:52:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Dude, let me save you the effort. Buy a plane ticket to anywhere.

Hahahaha. I thought others started calling them that to mock them. Such hilarity I've missed out on.
933323095737237504 2017-11-22 13:15:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Impeachment porn! Hah, that's exactly what it is!
933321722173980674 2017-11-22 13:10:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @melsil @sullivanamy @vinylwitch @micintime Also why "prosperity gospel" and other perversions of positive thinking, shiny happy Christianity are just damaging bullshit. Problems in life are not a simple, direct result of your sinfulness.
933318411651776512 2017-11-22 12:57:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @eventbritehelp Is there any way to make events I've saved appear in chronological order? I saved a bunch of upcoming stuff but in looking at the list to decide which ones to go to they appear in random order under "saved events".
933135162501746690 2017-11-21 00:48:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @OliviaResists @nadinevdVelde @jca10c9 @UK_Jillian @tywin_resists @BethR_27516 I feel kind of proud to be on both lists. I must be doing something right!
933133117094842368 2017-11-21 00:40:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @supermathskid @Jack2089z I work in both Newcastle and London. On jobs up north my salary has been 19k. In London it's 20k. Not a staggering difference.
933132842607038464 2017-11-21 00:39:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @supermathskid @Jack2089z I've lived in the NE since 2004. Was able to buy a house in Gateshead on my husband's 22k salary. Would be barely enough to rent a room in a shared house in London.
933132087401447424 2017-11-21 00:36:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @supermathskid @Jack2089z There absolutely needs to be more investment in the north & there's a huge disparity in most wages, but not all. Cost of living is vastly different as well.
933126887236407297 2017-11-21 00:16:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Shareblue @RVAwonk @LadyGrayse I'm certain he thinks we should not have that right. They want to implement exactly the same kind of oppression that daesh does.
933126139345858560 2017-11-21 00:13:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Shareblue @RVAwonk @VampWriterGRRL Deport? Why inflict them on anyone else? I think remote prison camps and hard labour for the rest of their lives.
933125694397255680 2017-11-21 00:11:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid Proof that being anti abortion has nothing whatsoever to do with keeping children safe. Absolutely not a damn thing.
933036100364455936 2017-11-21 18:15:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ChiefCovfefe @OliviaResists @RebeccaBMackie @sheLLbeLL_xo I mean how would she even know who most people really are? And why would most law enforcement care about Twitter spats?
933035798173233152 2017-11-21 18:14:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ChiefCovfefe @OliviaResists @RebeccaBMackie @sheLLbeLL_xo Ah, I quit paying attention to her & her crew months ago. I guess I'm on the big bad block list but IDGAF.
933034308440387584 2017-11-21 18:08:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @lauferlaw @Rule403 @PresOrinHatch @leslieinfl Isn't RICO about financial crimes? What does that have to do with sexual harassment?
933033373974622209 2017-11-21 18:04:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ChiefCovfefe @OliviaResists @RebeccaBMackie @sheLLbeLL_xo Does she actually follow up on that or just threaten, though?
933032903780511745 2017-11-21 18:02:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ChiefCovfefe @OliviaResists I guess I am, too, but I don't even recall who they are.
933032100487294976 2017-11-21 17:59:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Who in the US *likes* their cable company?
932983530627502080 2017-11-21 14:46:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @anamariecox @sullivanamy @wendynathan1 Even though I still have reservations about her, in her ability to keep going after that she is a giant and I admire her hugely for it.
932983175235670017 2017-11-21 14:44:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @melsil @sullivanamy @vinylwitch So very true.
932982284696936449 2017-11-21 14:41:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUflagmafia Yeah I used to find his moaning funny. But I haven't bought any of his albums in years.
932980543888740357 2017-11-21 14:34:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TheNewEuropean @jonlis1 I want to believe you but it seems that Labour are every bit as determined to jump off the cliff. Are there enough sensible people in Parliament to stop this?
932899116262273025 2017-11-21 09:10:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @matthaig1 @CarolineLucas @amandarandall5 @JennyStiles1 @revdkath I'm so sick of "collusion with the Tories" as an excuse in the face of what Labour are doing right now. Spare me.
932568089866235904 2017-11-20 11:15:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUflagmafia Yet oddly those same people now threaten it.
931899115373498368 2017-11-18 14:57:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EU_Commission @DavidDavisMP @campaignforleo @KateHoeyMP Could you be more moronic? The UK has set the parameters without a plan. It is their responsibility.
931878221628563457 2017-11-18 13:34:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PrivacyMatters I could never understand that logic. Like maybe if I bought a phone I should start seeing ads for cases, but not the phone I just bought.
931704983036268544 2017-11-17 02:05:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AdamParkhomenko @bigforkgirl @accidntlmystic Or this one?https://thinkprogress.org/nra-and-russian-cousin-18f607d40240/
931704633386569729 2017-11-17 02:04:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AdamParkhomenko @bigforkgirl @accidntlmystic Seen this?https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-the-republican-right-found-allies-in-russia/2017/04/30/e2d83ff6-29d3-11e7-a616-d7c8a68c1a66_story.html?utm_term=.385aed1546c7

931501798736760832 2017-11-17 12:38:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @benatipsosmori @Bonn1eGreer Day late and a dollar short, though, I fear.
931468793636884482 2017-11-17 10:27:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Independent Sigh.
931442493127909376 2017-11-17 08:42:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @thehill @304TheRevTJ @cyncynj @lynnteachquilt I'm ashamed at how little of this I knew about until the last couple of years. I didn't even know that black veterans were denied GI Bill benefits. Absurd that none of this is taught in school.
931328402673483776 2017-11-16 01:09:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @pwthornton @DrMassicotte This is awesome. Love it.
931327343666257920 2017-11-16 01:05:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EWErickson If you have that little self control and are so obsessed with sex that you only see women as objects to fuck then you need psychological help, not some sexist rule.
930557791462477824 2017-11-14 22:07:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @lyndonhood @foliosociety I only discovered Pratchett a few years ago. I don't know how I lived without it for so long!
930239405222227979 2017-11-13 01:02:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @laureneoneal I hope it's not bed bugs. I had them once and it really sucked.
930236434929344512 2017-11-13 00:50:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nibla @nikobakulich Do you write all the musical interludes? Some lovely stuff in there. I'm a year behind so you might have said already.
930235165586190336 2017-11-13 00:45:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Tombatt @laureneoneal It's hilarious, really. Misdirected rage at its finest.

930213095762550784 2017-11-13 23:17:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @solange_lebourg Interesting. Is she maybe realizing that it's in her interest to stop brexit?
930202537659191296 2017-11-13 22:35:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @bigfoottreasure @Dr_star_T Hmph. Season's Greetings!
930201400671440901 2017-11-13 22:31:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TransEleanor As President of the United States, I am not sure if you have any idea of what is going to happen with the vacuum.
930042459006078977 2017-11-13 11:59:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @joncoopertweets Their moral outrage only applies to people they don't agree with.
930042088426823680 2017-11-13 11:58:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TitusNation To be fair, he doesn't say they will be Keurigs. My bet is they'll be generic wal-mart.
930041024474484736 2017-11-13 11:53:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jamiesusskind I've never had a truly bad experience with the NHS. Irksome front desk staff, yes, and a doctor that didn't know about an OTC remedy I tried, but that's all.
929877723245248512 2017-11-12 01:05:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @drvox Sounds neat. I hope it takes off at least to some extent. Would be good in places w/drought problems.
929791928589307906 2017-11-12 19:24:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Nigel_Farage I think you are the one who has forgotten.

929785664622743553 2017-11-12 18:59:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AngeloJohnGage @subloke @5gatos Yeah they don't seem to understand the purpose of a boycott.

929780667990331397 2017-11-12 18:39:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jordanbpeterson Being married does not prevent someone from harassing or assaulting someone else. This is a really asinine statement.
929779431056474113 2017-11-12 18:34:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Personally I'll be making a point of buying at my Christmas stuff at Tesco now. This flap over the #tescochristmasadvert is pure hysteria.
929778550135287809 2017-11-12 18:30:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> That's about the size of it. Totally stupid and mean spirited.
928999198904717312 2017-11-10 14:54:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @FiveRights @tpe3tpj2 @CarrollBryant What an utterly vile view.
928998060235075585 2017-11-10 14:49:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @marcformarc @JessicaValenti @karlitosway___ @bardfinn @keithedwards Why pose the question on twitter and expect other people to do the work for you, though? If he really wanted to know he'd just Google it.
928940946632396801 2017-11-10 11:02:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Nigel_Farage Pretty sure the Vatican are the ones doing the banning here. Don't think WHO has any powers to do such things on their own.

928627382797430784 2017-11-09 14:16:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @VicenteFoxQue If nothing else, you've made me laugh.
928620800743301122 2017-11-09 13:50:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JamieRoss7 But why is it raw?
928329040771076097 2017-11-08 18:31:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @andrewtwalk @ezlusztig @levilong21 If you think something is a sin then don't do it yourself. It's none of your business what other people do in their lives.
928328301118214145 2017-11-08 18:28:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @andrewtwalk What on earth does someone else's gender identity have to do with your religion?
928327714918031360 2017-11-08 18:25:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @corrydes @BrexitBin @ProEuUk Indeed.
928326999038455808 2017-11-08 18:22:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Nigel_Farage Why? Because you said so? Whatever.
928296966827716608 2017-11-08 16:23:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EdwardTHardy Wow, what a nasty leaflet!
928296394825269248 2017-11-08 16:21:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> An important tactic that I think has been overlooked or forgotten. Outfits like Stormfront were actively encouraging their members to pretend they weren't planning to vote.https://twitter.com/alexandraerin/status/928274068364722176
927514052900859909 2017-11-06 12:32:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GemmaMRHughes Me too. Just like any time I see a US city trending I wonder if it's a mass shooting. 
926949655837138944 2017-11-04 23:09:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @samplereality I died in the UK and Ireland and I will be a good time to time and money to pay for the first time in the UK and Ireland
926948327907909632 2017-11-04 23:04:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @miss_s_b Sounds like a good life, really.
926943386019483648 2017-11-04 22:44:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NARAL How does this help, in crass terms? We already have too many people out of work.
926942889770352643 2017-11-04 22:43:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BrexitBin @Majikthyse More to the point, he doesn't care.
926942608747884544 2017-11-04 22:41:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @margarance @BrexitBin Pretty much.
926939760932937728 2017-11-04 22:30:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoRichardsKent @johnredwood Or they've looked at the evidence properly?
926919439492186113 2017-11-04 21:09:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BobJWilliams I love Jo Brand. I don't see her enough.
926820499040231424 2017-11-04 14:36:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NELibDems As a US/UK dual citizen & Lib Dem member I heartily concur.
926795469203808259 2017-11-04 12:57:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MattOLN If you don't understand why it's problematic then I suggest that you are wrong.
926775253530902529 2017-11-04 11:36:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NELibDems @howard_sykes: Lib Dems stand not because they want to be something but because they want to do something. #neldconf
926774595989803009 2017-11-04 11:34:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @vincecable mentioned fairness in his speech. I think this is a key concept. Not just about taxing wealth or giving handouts. #neldconf
926773527843180549 2017-11-04 11:30:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @vincecable @NELibDems @mcrosby18 Whoa, really? I didn't know about the glass! I've always wanted to try it but never get a chance. Now I'm doubly happy I am here!
926477014164557824 2017-11-03 15:51:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RWPUSA Um, I think we've been having one since February at least.

925891050765418497 2017-11-01 01:03:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jimwaterson Um. I'm absolutely certain that's not true.
925887243843235840 2017-11-01 00:48:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @fish_in_a_hat @SKZCartoons I used to like their pubs. Cheap, usually good beer selection & in interesting historic buildings. Haven't set foot in one since brexit.
925524251364425733 2017-10-31 00:45:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DonaldJTrumpJr Get a dictionary. Or better yet a political science tutor.

925439262069329920 2017-10-31 19:08:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Nigel_Farage Reality has a liberal, pro-EU bias.

925419493505093633 2017-10-31 17:49:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Was wondering why @BBClamacqshow was playing Alien Sex Fiend, and then remembered that it's Halloween. Duh.
925298984041795584 2017-10-31 09:50:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LBC @adamlangleben @cygnetstar16 That's why I don't listen to it, even though I like some of the people on it.

924299690170077185 2017-10-28 15:39:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @davidmackau @MidwstMaelstrom I wonder how we can get into that world? I'm not liking this timeline.
924298601110687744 2017-10-28 15:35:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LindseyGrahamSC @republicEn @wlbeeton Maybe, but is the price actually high enough to make much of a difference?

923898292727107584 2017-10-27 13:04:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JBwol At first I thought this was some kind of elaborate new hipster way of cooking whole chickens.
923896995097600010 2017-10-27 12:59:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @scifri It's too much like Zoidberg to be cute. I'd prefer it stays underground, thanks.

923661987346878464 2017-10-26 21:25:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @POTUS @JeffFlake @davidaxelrod Of course, but he really needs to back it up with action. Otherwise his courage is meaningless.

923653211445170176 2017-10-26 20:51:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LindseyGrahamSC @republicEn A price on carbon isn't much use without investment in technology that will replace fossil fuels.
923651713684463616 2017-10-26 20:45:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @InsanityIsFree @TeaPainUSA @DianeSATX @Zero_Gov I identified 1900 as the approximate start of the shift from the start of this discussion.
923645384206974977 2017-10-26 20:19:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @InsanityIsFree @TeaPainUSA @DianeSATX @Zero_Gov I am referring to the process which started with Bryan, as explained here: https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/PSEUDOSC/Rep-DemSwitch.HTM
923644727106457600 2017-10-26 20:17:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @InsanityIsFree @TeaPainUSA @DianeSATX @Zero_Gov Starting around 1900. And it's pretty rich to claim intellectual confrontation when you can't refrain from childish insults.

923641549417836555 2017-10-26 20:04:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EveningStandard @George_Osborne You know, I hated you as Chancellor but I'm enjoying your time at ES.
923639897075933184 2017-10-26 19:58:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GuitarMoog Maybe that's why they needed those lists. They're looking for qualified people to read the reports for them.
923639487900635136 2017-10-26 19:56:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EdwardTHardy I'd fall off my chair if he had actually read them.

923636688030781441 2017-10-26 19:45:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @InsanityIsFree @TeaPainUSA @DianeSATX @Zero_Gov Sigh. 14th amendment, 1868. 15th, 1870. Roughly 150 years ago. Dems & Reps switched ideology starting around 1900.

923585800851378177 2017-10-26 16:23:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @InsanityIsFree @TeaPainUSA @DianeSATX @Zero_Gov Those amendments were 150 years ago. The parties swapped ideology around the turn of the century. Pretty basic history.

923580248352018434 2017-10-26 16:01:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @InsanityIsFree @TeaPainUSA @DianeSATX @Zero_Gov So are you saying that it was bad to end slavery and extend voting & citizenship? Because your meme implies those were good, GOP things.
923522492001652736 2017-10-26 12:11:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @InsanityIsFree @TeaPainUSA @DianeSATX @Zero_Gov Funny that you invoke history but ignore the actual history of both parties, which have totally swapped ideology.

923518734396022785 2017-10-26 11:56:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Bonn1eGreer @Juan_Zero1010 Right in lockstep with the rest of them. I'll give him credit for a great speech but I'm not forgiving him yet.
923518364340940800 2017-10-26 11:55:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Bonn1eGreer Only if he backs it up with action. Like actually voting against the terrible legislation & judicial appointments.
923517698402865154 2017-10-26 11:52:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LouiseMensch @Bonn1eGreer I'm a bit sad that I'm not high enough on the radar to be blocked.

923456958048407553 2017-10-26 07:51:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @KellyannePolls Don't know what papers you read, but I knew this last October. Researching your opponent is a pretty basic, normal thing to do.

923286655942955008 2017-10-25 20:34:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @christinawilkie I find it ominous though. Who are the patriots?
923286311800369154 2017-10-25 20:33:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @diponte @doan1935 @carolJhedges Yes, but loads of us do! Or other languages. I don't speak French but I do speak Spanish, albeit badly.

923223067341524992 2017-10-25 16:21:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @funder @HighheelsDes Indeed. Just a counter to the "lots of people have business there, it's no big deal" argument.
923222699723444224 2017-10-25 16:20:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @diponte @doan1935 @carolJhedges Just a play on the "Americans don't know any geography" trope, of course!
923216674890895360 2017-10-25 15:56:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @diponte @carolJhedges @doan1935 *anymore. Thanks for making me look dumb when I'm trying to be smart, autocorrect. 
923216104645910528 2017-10-25 15:54:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @funder See, I don't think this would necessarily be problematic except for the lying about it.
923215549315866624 2017-10-25 15:51:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @diponte @carolJhedges @doan1935 Hey, I'm American and never went anywhere near there and even I know those countries don't exist anyone. Davis has no excuse.
923214879036727296 2017-10-25 15:49:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @diponte Why does he still have a job? I'm ten times more informed than he is and I'm unemployed. Stings a bit, you know?
923214286788407296 2017-10-25 15:46:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DonaldJTrumpJr @SheriffClarke @OPSVeracity @SDscribbler Me too. What am I missing?
923148920452190213 2017-10-25 11:27:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BorisJohnson Too bad you're shit at diplomacy.
923143731502600192 2017-10-25 11:06:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JamesMelville @jc23art I still don't see why so many thought he was better. I wasn't wild about HRC but trump was such an obvious disaster. It's sickening.

923139054635569152 2017-10-25 10:47:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JamesMelville @jc23art I didn't really expect it of us Americans either though. I thought most of us were more enlightened than that.
923099763947573249 2017-10-25 08:11:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ananavarro And wasn't this literally reported in the Washington Post in February? I certainly knew this already.
923099415895736320 2017-10-25 08:10:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @iSmashFizzle @Hayleeee1848 Of course.
923098725790216192 2017-10-25 08:07:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JamesMelville @jc23art Yup. I've been struggling ever since. It's unbelievable how nasty and gullible people are, and I didn't see it coming.
922962730977341440 2017-10-24 23:07:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @washingtonpost Is this news? Pretty sure this was reported months ago.
922959871003242497 2017-10-24 22:55:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BeSeriousUSA Why would it have anything to do with education or career field?
922947573413007360 2017-10-24 22:07:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @20committee @Delavegalaw Yup. A crook is a crook. Blind partisanship does not factor into my desire for justice.
922940708847341568 2017-10-24 21:39:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> The headline suggests this study comes from the #MISPWOSOhttps://twitter.com/VICE/status/922939610241622018
922940034717712385 2017-10-24 21:37:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @andrejpwalker I go to my local library quite often. It's nice to have a place to read or work that isn't a coffee shop.
922939598317203464 2017-10-24 21:35:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> I'm disappointed that #Alien is not trending because the benevolent aliens have come to save us at last.
922937583763587079 2017-10-24 21:27:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mmpadellan There's a tweet for everything.

922911974555553792 2017-10-24 19:45:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @womensmediacntr You know, at this point I'm ready to just say that I'm OK with killing babies. I can't make ppl see reason so I might as well own it.
922910911014285313 2017-10-24 19:41:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ananavarro And they are all correct.

922863460140101632 2017-10-24 16:32:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @chhcalling Yes, as long as that open and vigorous debate falls within the approved parameters and reaches the right conclusions?

922737720925007872 2017-10-24 08:13:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MilitaryTimes @commondefense @GuitarAbuser Most of it.

922615447417163777 2017-10-23 00:07:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Peter_Wehner Duh. Plenty of women have been trying to tell people this for years.

922414437931331584 2017-10-23 10:48:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nytimes It's also horrible what his victims went through.
921278952206987264 2017-10-20 07:36:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @OfficialJoelF LOL. I look at my flabby self, and I wonder how this idea that we white people are genetically superior ever got started.

920997235504148480 2017-10-19 12:57:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> The combo of Maya Angelou reading "I Rise" & "Telstar" at the British Library sound exhibit is surprisingly apt.
920981049525628928 2017-10-19 11:52:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Keir_Starmer Time to #ExitBrexit Mr Starmer.
920978745690910720 2017-10-19 11:43:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @supermathskid The arrogance is staggering. And completely unfounded.
920978339355136002 2017-10-19 11:42:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @EUflagmafia @SoftDvil That assumes US democacy will recover. Not at all certain at this stage. The extreme gerrymandering and voter suppression is alarming.
920977694103408640 2017-10-19 11:39:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUflagmafia She is absolutely right. The same forces are behind both. A very painful reality for us dual US-UK people. There is no escape.
920976913967013888 2017-10-19 11:36:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Amy_Siskind I have nearly lost all faith, and certainly all optimism. Going back on antidepressants in the hopes that I will be able to function again.
920964215208374272 2017-10-19 10:45:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @pearson @rocza Yes there are no doubt culturally mediated responses to pain. But these sweeping generalizations are awful. How was this ever approved?
920787685429645312 2017-10-18 23:04:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IanDunt @mapduliand @EleanorRylance @dewordepolitics @fish_in_a_hat @oshaymoishe1 I don't think it should be an elected body, either. Because they don't need to campaign they are much more neutral, IMHO.
920782423335546881 2017-10-18 22:43:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EricBoehlert Yet more evidence that they only care about using veterans as props.

920778537224810496 2017-10-18 22:28:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MrJonCryer Hopefully that was Las Vegas, only we actually learn something from it.
920772262537646081 2017-10-18 22:03:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DanAlexander21 Huh. Was it from John Barron? A 202 area code?
920656698439815168 2017-10-18 14:23:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DeanBaker13 And? The parties switched ideology. Lincoln would not be a Republican today. He'd be considered "far left".
920632932120911872 2017-10-18 12:49:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nickreeves9876 Alas many of the remain groups I know do not seem to see this.
920631720420012032 2017-10-18 12:44:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @donewithgopntx I'll admit that on some level I've always found these rituals a bit silly but right now I'm asserting my claim to them. It's my flag, too.
920631272422215680 2017-10-18 12:42:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @donewithgopntx And it's why I stood for the anthem with my hand on my heart when the flag was raised at an expat picnic in London for Independence Day.
920630866002501632 2017-10-18 12:41:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @donewithgopntx This is why I wear my flag stuff when I go to protests. They can't claim exclusive rights to our symbols.
920630419371855872 2017-10-18 12:39:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @docrocktex26 @WertmanAngela @coastalelite22 I'm trying to do what I can to help now but it's shocking how ignorant I've been. Plenty of work needed to learn what to do.
920630010775523329 2017-10-18 12:37:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @docrocktex26 @WertmanAngela @coastalelite22 It's overwhelming. I genuinely had no idea that so many of my fellow white people were such racist assholes. Thanks, liberal bubble.
920629319524864000 2017-10-18 12:35:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nickreeves9876 I think it's important to keep in mind, though, that uneducated does not necessarily equal stupid. I think that's a common framing mistake.
920552213931585536 2017-10-18 07:28:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Bakehouse2016 @justthevax They'll be living in the caravan by then.
920434781132853248 2017-10-17 23:42:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NadineDorries Terrorist sympathizers? You're laying it on just a wee bit thick, there.
920408936532054017 2017-10-17 21:59:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @goldengateblond She probably also listened to that awful song that conflated punks with hippies a lot, too.

920193890182934529 2017-10-17 07:44:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> After the hostility and the threats, how can we consider a leave voter a friend? Interesting comment.https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/106687759
920084243388223488 2017-10-16 00:29:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DLoesch My views are very different to yours but that doesn't make you my enemy or any less human. Rape and harassment are always wrong. 3
920083269500141569 2017-10-16 00:25:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DLoesch Anyone who says conservative women don't deserve compassion isn't actually progressive. 2
920083178479595520 2017-10-16 00:24:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DLoesch The point of this is that no woman, regardless of her ideology, should have to experience this. 1
919973915069382657 2017-10-16 17:10:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mikeallen Please, God, no!

919707768650719235 2017-10-15 23:33:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @KTHopkins @WelshGasDoc @drew_carver Her only skill seems to be coming up with the most vile thing she can possibly say and then deleting it when there's a backlash.
919701872377810945 2017-10-15 23:09:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jnsanchez I get that these things need to be edible without heat and shelf stable, but surely there are better options that fit that bill?
919700708965912576 2017-10-15 23:05:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Samantha101_ @jnsanchez Hmm, did Samantha object to aid being delivered to other US citizens in Florida or Texas? Montana or Oregon after the fires? Hmm.
919699400980664320 2017-10-15 22:59:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Everything I've experienced was pretty minor, but even the ugly fat lady gets harassed. It's not about attraction, it's about abuse.  #MeToo
919695877161308160 2017-10-15 22:45:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AprilPreston_ I've been thinking about it but it's all so dang impractical! I want the nice country I chose to make my home in back.
919695562072522752 2017-10-15 22:44:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AprilPreston_ I joined the Lib Dems in December. 
919598181905850368 2017-10-15 16:17:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AprilPreston_ I've only been a citizen for a few years and joined Labour in order to vote against Corbyn. I did not renew after the first year.
919593410880856064 2017-10-15 15:58:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @thetorchsays This kind of crap is why I was only a labour member for a year. Slogans and buzzwords and personality cults, no thanks.
919579550253834242 2017-10-15 15:03:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Nigel_Farage Whereas you are part of a global elite seeking to destroy democracy and accountability in order to gain unfair financial advantages.
918595008076316672 2017-10-12 21:51:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TrumpPrisonDate Wait, do we or don't we retweeted #25thAmendment ?
918593896791314432 2017-10-12 21:47:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CharlesTannock The climate has had me feeling unwelcome & I'm pretty well integrated. If I could I'd move away. I'm not even European!
918582709982769152 2017-10-12 21:02:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @bengoldacre Brexit McBoatface will solve all our problems.
918576154403098625 2017-10-12 20:36:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @theParliamentP Thanks for this! I feel much more optimistic about my chances now.
918476435966382081 2017-10-12 14:00:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @brianklaas Damaging? Has damaged. Damn near destroyed. We apparently deserve it, though, because enough of us voted for him.
918475137397248000 2017-10-12 13:55:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GothamGirlBlue It's just you. Everyone knows that it's all Clinton's fault anyway.
918446887056891904 2017-10-12 12:02:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @pbump "But the industry, my friends. *That* was a revolution."
918445267719946240 2017-10-12 11:56:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @VP @SebGorka What kind of weak morality do you have if you need someone else there to monitor you? Don't you have any self control?
918412909671313409 2017-10-12 09:47:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Jeff_Jacoby Sounds awesome. If we collectively organised it on a national level we could just pay for it through taxes and save tons of money.
918266196054638592 2017-10-11 00:04:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> didn't actually vote. Khan & Cotton definitely trump. Boomhauer Johnson or wrote in Bernie. Luann either Clinton or didn't vote at all.
918265672458792961 2017-10-11 00:02:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> FWIW I think Hank is a never-trumper over the steak issue, probably voted Johnson. Peggy definitely Clinton. Dale talked a lot of shit but 1
918264987612794880 2017-10-11 00:00:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> OMG. Totally forgot about King of the Hill and now I discover this massive convo about how the characters would have voted. Awesome!https://twitter.com/freeyourmindkid/status/918086266587140097
918263031196463104 2017-10-11 23:52:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @washingtonpost So where are all those folks who claimed to care so much about the Constitution? Even if you're an originalist press freedom is right there.
918261895550861312 2017-10-11 23:47:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @cmclymer @AggieDave @suffolkvicar Ah, I think the American system is still quite different.
918257325370208256 2017-10-11 23:29:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ChukaUmunna @lawole4 @LyingTimmy Well as much as I'm opposed to UKIP my inner libertarian thinks that those voters deserve to be represented. Just like Green or Lib Dems.
918256186125844480 2017-10-11 23:25:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LyingTimmy Even after the referendum result, he should have stayed and started the process of actually planning properly instead of abandoning us.
918255877819379712 2017-10-11 23:23:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LyingTimmy It all comes back to Cameron and his cowardice, doesn't it? If he'd been a stronger leader none of this would have happened.
918255305514987520 2017-10-11 23:21:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ChukaUmunna @lawole4 @LyingTimmy Yeah, I should have explained my thinking better. I don't think they were actually that much of a threat to Cameron though.
918254909316915200 2017-10-11 23:20:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LyingTimmy I'm probably being far too optimistic and generous, though. 3.
918254661487996929 2017-10-11 23:19:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LyingTimmy more valid complaints, like the lack of investment in British business, might have been addressed & the anger leading to brexit faded. 2/
918254256779677696 2017-10-11 23:17:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LyingTimmy I suppose there's a larger point about proportional representation, in that if they'd had more influence then perhaps some of their 1/
918253938465525761 2017-10-11 23:16:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LyingTimmy We did but I think they were both converts from the Tories who went right back to them. And weren't very influential.
918253395978407936 2017-10-11 23:14:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PeteNorth303 @Jumpthewave @cheianov @RobWetherill1 @CpmGray @solange_lebourg @GuitarMoog And the narcissism diagnosis in a tweet complaining about implying that someone is a psychopath. Because he disagreed with them.
918250461890863104 2017-10-11 23:02:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @alexandraerin @digitaldraco There's a reason for that, you know. The writers based Bif on trump.
918249733407367168 2017-10-11 22:59:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @cmclymer @AggieDave Why not just have "Scouts" and do away with the gender divide? It's not like Girl Scouts do anything that boys can't do.
918247716630691841 2017-10-11 22:51:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ChukaUmunna @lawole4 @LyingTimmy Honestly I think we might have been better off with a UKIP MP or two. Sunlight is the best disinfectant after all.

917857132896227328 2017-10-10 20:59:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @johnredwood It's a pity that the UK team has been obstinately ignoring the timetable that was agreed in advance
917856004410429442 2017-10-10 20:54:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @liamcasey1997 Knowing when you need help is very manly, IMHO.

917748179440930817 2017-10-10 13:46:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> I started reading about the New Apostolic Reformation, and now I wish I hadn't. Terrifying stuff. We are truly dealing w/the American ISIL.

917542980675915777 2017-10-09 00:11:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump You're right. Nobody could have done so little and complained about it so much.
917542656707891202 2017-10-09 00:09:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @michaelianblack @Dookofurl Seriously. They're creepy AF but if they keep the creeps occupied, so much the better.
917531944782622720 2017-10-09 23:27:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @michaelianblack @Dookofurl Surely that's what fleshlights and bullet vibes are for?
917527395149778944 2017-10-09 23:09:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ChukaUmunna Just cancel brexit. Why give up our influence?
917527031595880448 2017-10-09 23:07:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nikobakulich @sunschooldrop I've only recently started listening and I'm catching up on all the old ones, in order, but I'm still oddly invested in this.
917526696449986560 2017-10-09 23:06:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RVAwonk @milosfriend2 Yeah but presumably you'd start at the beginning of the race like everyone else?
917524717808046081 2017-10-09 22:58:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RVAwonk Now there's a man who undoubtedly has serious trouble getting laid.

915236197320024064 2017-10-03 15:24:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Patheos Hmm. I followed because I was learning something, but I might have to unfollow again.
915235487224401920 2017-10-03 15:21:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @robfordmancs I picked accountants because there's already a campaign against coffee shops and organic food.

915163190044119046 2017-10-03 10:34:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @originalspin Frankly anyone who murders others is distraught. The attraction to an extreme ideology of any sort is a manifestation of their distress.
915159403896168451 2017-10-03 10:19:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HowardKurtz So I say now is the time to talk, while the horror is fresh in our minds. Because apparently we Americans need to be reminded over and over.
915157591642247169 2017-10-03 10:12:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HowardKurtz That's how you cry politics and then try to guilt decent people into staying silent and respectful while you gear up the propaganda.
915157305259413504 2017-10-03 10:11:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HowardKurtz And then you will focus on the ways that some of the victims might not have been perfect people, or heroic tales of the survivors.
915156906720755712 2017-10-03 10:09:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HowardKurtz Now is the best time to start talking. Because as soon as you can you'll change the subject to the killer & his incomprehensible motives.
915155484906283008 2017-10-03 10:04:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @VP @kethera @MatthiasLinks So tell me, when would it ever be appropriate to talk about this and how to stop it in the future?

915153833436827649 2017-10-03 09:57:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @VP Are you going to offer any action on getting these weapons out of circulation?
915144760767188992 2017-10-03 09:21:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @dannychun Mine too. Plaster my ugly face everywhere if you think it will help make this crap stop.

914828790110572544 2017-10-02 12:25:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @_WhyzGuy_ @Merkinstein There are situations when I considered getting a gun, but never something that could indiscriminately spread death around me.
914828210449391616 2017-10-02 12:23:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @_WhyzGuy_ @Merkinstein The truth is that weapons of mass casualty could be restricted while leaving rights to own more reasonable weapons intact.
914827588064903174 2017-10-02 12:21:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @_WhyzGuy_ @Merkinstein The truth is that if we were serious about stopping these incidents, we would find a way to take these weapons out of circulation.
914827327699390464 2017-10-02 12:20:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @_WhyzGuy_ @Merkinstein The truth is that there is no reason why any civilian should have access to weapons that can kill multiple people in seconds.
914827052217458688 2017-10-02 12:19:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @_WhyzGuy_ @Merkinstein And yeah, I know such guns are often not technically military weapons, but resorting to technicalities is just a way of hiding from truth.
914826203412025344 2017-10-02 12:15:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @_WhyzGuy_ @Merkinstein But why in the hell does anyone not in an actual combat situation have access to weapons like this?
914825963120336896 2017-10-02 12:14:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @_WhyzGuy_ @Merkinstein Yes. I'm not interested in confiscating all guns, which is the popular straw man that's always trundled out in these horrible situations.
914825496743104513 2017-10-02 12:12:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @teuchterdavid They clearly failed to read the article.

914818421203902465 2017-10-02 11:44:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> 50 more dead. Can we please fucking do something about guns, America? And yes, it's time to be political. Life is always political.

912966554983202816 2017-09-27 09:06:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> What a surprise. Who would have thought that the utter inhumanity and nastiness of the UK gov't might make other countries a bit upset. https://twitter.com/RemainerAction/status/912963451223461888
912963535541604352 2017-09-27 08:54:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TVRav @JosephyneT @dedeuk And ppl abroad who aren't familiar with Brighton aren't the main audience of the slides. Ppl at the conference in that actual building are.
912962891829202945 2017-09-27 08:51:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TVRav @JosephyneT @dedeuk What a bonkers argument. "I think it looks like a mosque, therefore it is a subliminal message". Even though 2 secs on google show it's not.
912962216743272448 2017-09-27 08:48:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sprintexec @ThatTimWalker @katie15price Can you explain your reasoning, Katie? If we remain EU members we keep our EU influence as well as control of our own country.
912960399582142465 2017-09-27 08:41:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Getting strong hints of "pot - kettle - black" with this statement.https://twitter.com/theipaper/status/912960020672913410
912959885645672448 2017-09-27 08:39:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @charliespiering @schwaka_ I've seen reports recently that this was introduced (& paid for!) by DoD to boost recruitment starting in 2009. So, basically propaganda.
912958872142454784 2017-09-27 08:35:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> I never knew about this act. Why are territories like PR not exempt all the time?https://twitter.com/mattdpearce/status/912851602947444737

912803281767936000 2017-09-26 22:17:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AmberRuddHR should resign or be fired. These "blunders" are not acceptable.https://twitter.com/HenryCPorter/status/912735098658869254

912801301192470530 2017-09-26 22:09:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @charliespiering Frankly I don't think we should be playing the anthem at all. It cheapens patriotism & turns out into nothing but a conformist ritual.
912798458377048064 2017-09-26 21:58:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IanDunt @carolJhedges Every time they come up with a clever insult I think "ooh, I like that, I'll take it!"
912797768749428737 2017-09-26 21:55:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Freeyourmindkid I had to look at their other articles to be sure. Sad that it's not obvious satire, isn't it?
912772952730603522 2017-09-26 20:16:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Hmm, nothing was said about defending people's rights?pic.twitter.com/vbeQ2oJ7Di

912593279270649856 2017-09-26 08:22:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @KeithOlbermann @Corpulace I think I can't be any more angry or contemptuous of this individual, and then he does something like this. I won't even call him a man.
912453435143983105 2017-09-25 23:07:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Otto_English They are unable to understand hypocrisy.

912364613341237248 2017-09-25 17:14:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @POTUS @kurteichenwald Because they are mainly brown and speak Spanish. A total disgrace.
912364166412931072 2017-09-25 17:12:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenBennetCO and @SenCoryGardner What are you doing to secure aid for Puerto Rico? They are US citizens and need help! #UnitedForPuertoRico

912279830934249476 2017-09-25 11:37:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @dontbrexitfixit @alanjstedman Absurd logic. The opposition should stop the gov't destroying the country, not helping so they can ride in later & pretend to be heroes.

912107525956399105 2017-09-24 00:12:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @puppymnkey @Ranzabar4000 I'm thinking canned goods and giant bags of rice, myself.

911931319738945537 2017-09-24 12:32:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @peterdaou "Disrespecting our flag" is saying that you will put your religion above the laws of your country.
911929996721246209 2017-09-24 12:27:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @peterdaou "Disrespecting our flag" is calling for the separation of church and state to be abolished.
911929812930973697 2017-09-24 12:26:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @peterdaou "Disrespecting our flag" is refusing to pay military and federal employees a decent wage. It's decimating health care for veterans.

911169422617956352 2017-09-22 10:04:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SarahLudford I guess I feel some responsibility to my adopted country, in that I want to help dig us out of the hole. Which means working to #ExitBrexit.

910505455486685185 2017-09-20 14:06:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Anna_Soubry Thing is, that "one nation" Tory party now seems isolationist & to exclude immigrants, brown people, and the poor. No thanks.

910044639138390016 2017-09-19 07:35:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EvanHD @BBCNewsnight @KateHoeyMP @EUflagmafia @_loobyloo @Louiseh76 @brexit_fact @jammydevil I'm surprised that anyone seriously thinks that what we peons say on Twitter has the slightest effect on negotiations.

909456336693420036 2017-09-17 16:37:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tribelaw @MonaSigal @Teen_Vogue has also done some surprisingly stellar work.

909451933383102465 2017-09-17 16:20:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @timfarron @JubalBarca OK thanks. Didn't realize there was one, but of course there must be! Duh.

909402745366605824 2017-09-17 13:04:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @liberal_reform We really should be championing improved digital literacy. The last year has shown how easy it is to fool ppl w/little effort.
909400721593954304 2017-09-17 12:56:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @timfarron @JubalBarca Is it available anywhere for those of us who couldn't attend?

909398178860060673 2017-09-17 12:46:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @WeAreOneEU @jurygroup It's a flat out lie and has already been acknowledged as false.

907895960696705024 2017-09-13 09:17:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ChukaUmunna @opt_way There's no vengeance involved. That's only your fevered imagination. The EU is following rules the UK helped create.

907894366521495552 2017-09-13 09:10:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @guardian Just looking at the still and thinking "gaah, she needs to tie up that long headdress! Could get caught in the chain!"
907893721911394304 2017-09-13 09:08:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ALDEgroup @guyverhofstadt @Europarl_EN Sadly I now live in a country that is turning its back on these ideals.

907891241509060608 2017-09-13 08:58:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jeremycorbyn @BBCNews He's part right. Also failure to invest in business & failure to enforce employment law.

907888517270962177 2017-09-13 08:47:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @OliverNorgrove All this is exactly what remainers were trying to tell you. It was very clear that rational people would not be driving brexit.
907698768908300288 2017-09-12 20:13:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jeremycorbyn Does this mean you will finally start acting like an opposition?
907694406026842112 2017-09-12 19:56:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Sikhandin @JoyAnnReid @Indy_Resists They think they do, anyway. They are the first to go crying to the authorities when they are challenged.

907687674634534913 2017-09-12 19:29:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mikefarb1 They would like to end all voting and install themselves as rulers, I'm pretty sure.
907615257459380224 2017-09-12 14:41:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RightWingWatch That is so arrogant and sacrilegious.

907567955596148736 2017-09-12 11:33:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @shannonrwatts @fredebenvina @markkellymkell1 The term or the concept? Probably 4chan in either case, or similar.
907566699951554560 2017-09-12 11:28:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @porter_debby It's the personality cult I find most disturbing. Much like Corbyn here in the UK. It shuts down all critical thought.
907566217527021568 2017-09-12 11:27:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @shannonrwatts Nah. Clearly it's just a hysterical woman crying out for attention. *eyeroll*
907565315801927682 2017-09-12 11:23:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MerylORourke In fact I first heard about this from a very religious friend who was condemning the parents for being prejudiced.
907564969960636416 2017-09-12 11:22:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MerylORourke Sorry, didn't mean to accuse you of that! Just occurred to me after I RTd that it could be read that way.
907389612036849665 2017-09-11 23:45:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MerylORourke Tho I think it's unfair to paint all CofE parents as transphobic. All the ones I know would explain it w/o prejudice.

907278051897233409 2017-09-11 16:21:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @profcarroll It's pretty obvious that the vast majority of us are, in fact, idiots. I'm by no means immune.

906653209246265344 2017-09-09 22:59:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @scarlettpeach Well several MEPs from Labour spoke, and one Tory. Just no MPs.
906061290979909632 2017-09-08 07:47:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Femi_Sorry I reckon the Mayans just got their calculations that predicted the world would end in 2012 just a bit off.

893000070530048000 2017-08-02 06:46:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @solange_lebourg @JimMFelton @p2pnut_ray So are my 60-something in-laws. They live in France half the year, of course they voted remain!
892838152410460160 2017-08-02 20:02:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @pswidlicki The sheer unadulterated arrogance makes me a bit ashamed that I chose to become a citizen.
892837448128106496 2017-08-02 20:00:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> What? I'm so sorry. Now I'll have to quiz my relatives to see how many of them think this, too.https://twitter.com/i/moments/892775100067479553
892833188892086272 2017-08-02 19:43:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @StevenMK30 This thread is cute but I so glad I got married 10 years ago before this was a thing. Our names together sound like a chewing gum flavour.
892666961016049664 2017-08-02 08:42:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @UKLabour @LibDems @Scientists4EU @C_Kenyon1 @City_Livery_SM @mikegalsworthy @RTaylor_LibDem Correct me if I'm mis-remembering but weren't some Labour members kicked out of the party for trying to do this at a local level?
892410313643044864 2017-08-01 15:42:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @bspeed8 Man, I need to find out if there is one near me so I can take my other half. He hates shopping.
892409946284974080 2017-08-01 15:41:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ACLU @BThomas3333 Maybe. I'd venture a guess that many ex-cons wouldn't vote at all even if they got their rights back.
892408330945253377 2017-08-01 15:35:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ACLU @BThomas3333 Not necessarily. Friend of mine's dad is disenfranchised because of prior conviction in FL but he was mad bcuz he couldn't vote for trump.
892407870100299781 2017-08-01 15:33:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ACLU Thank you for taking this on. It's always seemed wrong to me. If you served your sentence your rights should be restored.
892407397049917444 2017-08-01 15:31:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @grahambsi Muddle is far too weak a word for this.
892407038432751616 2017-08-01 15:29:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDems @Scientists4EU @City_Livery_SM Presumably that's why 'flop' was in quotation marks...
892392548089647104 2017-08-01 14:32:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JolyonMaugham That and some are probably so far down that they don't believe it can get worse.
892392178957393923 2017-08-01 14:30:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Scientists4EU Thanks for this. Your point WRT not voting UKIP in 2015 if you wanted to leave the EU is spot on.
892292253888253954 2017-08-01 07:53:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @StevenTDennis We should be disagreeing on things like how to fund and structure health care, not whether some people deserve it or not.
892292017061081088 2017-08-01 07:52:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @StevenTDennis I'd like to learn more about her. I'm a Democrat but I want to see sensible and reasonable people take back the Republican Party.
892288973082693634 2017-08-01 07:40:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mar_de_palabras This is undoubtedly true. Money helps with many things.
892156401988100097 2017-07-31 22:53:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mar_de_palabras Anyway no idea who you are or how you appeared on my feed, but I'm sorry that people are shitty to you.
892156091265687552 2017-07-31 22:52:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mar_de_palabras Of course it's still much easier for me as a cis hetero person but I'm used to the unsolicited comments thing at least.
892155739560706048 2017-07-31 22:51:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mar_de_palabras It's not your job to make everyone else comfortable. I guess I get a bit of a similar treatment as a fat woman so I empathise.
892155314694488065 2017-07-31 22:49:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mar_de_palabras I just can't see why anyone cares that much about a stranger's life. You should be free to be who you are, even if others don't understand.
892152119398203397 2017-07-31 22:36:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mar_de_palabras Obviously the people you know are different but I DGAF about your anatomy. It's your business. & in fact I say this if the subject comes up.
891984714600468480 2017-07-31 11:31:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @chunkymark @DMReporter These people amaze me with their ability to whine and complain about every tiny inconvenience as if it were the end of the world.

890473196062986240 2017-07-27 07:25:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @thehill @ToddCam73331502 That's because GOP have an irrational hatred of Obama and Democrats in general.
890472968391991296 2017-07-27 07:24:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @thehill As they should. For all their flaws, Dems actually want to help, while GOP only want to win & don't care who they hurt in the process.

888066139879870464 2017-07-20 16:00:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BBClamacqshow Surely today's national anthem is one of the few circumstances in which it is MANDATORY to play Kenny Rogers!
888021136214306816 2017-07-20 13:01:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Keir_Starmer And then Labour doubled down by ensuring that there was no meaningful debate or oversight in Parliament.
888011244011171842 2017-07-20 12:22:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Agree. It's pointless chasing after trump voters. Let's focus on the real core of the Democratic Party.https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/opinion/democrats-midterm-elections-black-voters.html

887969693381873664 2017-07-20 09:37:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Independent True enough, but in this context it's the relative differences that are surprising. They're all overpaid.

887966917742481408 2017-07-20 09:26:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @fawfulfan He's been a terrible disappointment but the fact remains that he's the only Republican I ever even briefly considered voting for.
887966088105000963 2017-07-20 09:23:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @OwenJones84 @tony_nog @Jackalbion Perhaps because the remainers who voted Labour haven't made their views clear?

885783549298831360 2017-07-14 08:50:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @diponte I'm not optimistic that brexit will be abandoned nor that anything good will come of it. The lesson is that money subverts democracy.
885775209890013184 2017-07-14 08:17:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CNN What a great idea.  
885769821052436480 2017-07-14 07:55:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MichelBarnier @SarahLudford It's just deeply embarrassing as well as being terrifying. There are plenty of smart people in the UK; why are these fools in charge?
885647756232097792 2017-07-13 23:50:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ReaderAdrift @Wolfe321 @C_Stroop Have you seen this?
885647171692920833 2017-07-13 23:48:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ReaderAdrift @Wolfe321 At least some people are finally seeing this.

885640873974923264 2017-07-13 23:23:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @impeach_d_trump Because they're special, and this is a coup.
885639006242783232 2017-07-13 23:16:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Heartbreaking thread but I'm thinking this too. Why the hell did I go through years of visas & tests &  to be treated like shit?https://twitter.com/cliodiaspora/status/885514968275308544
885637346107981825 2017-07-13 23:09:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @impeach_d_trump @VeronicaDevine6 Yep.
885636018057224194 2017-07-13 23:04:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Freeyourmindkid No. I don't think it will happen.

885619360202665984 2017-07-13 21:58:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MuslimIQ @Jamarcaledon1 Go look at newspapers from the late 1800s and see what they said about Italian and Irish immigrants.
885473457923911682 2017-07-13 12:18:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PickardJE Yeah I am no fan of Osborne due to austerity but the Standard's headlines have been very funny since he became editor.
885471970887946242 2017-07-13 12:12:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MuslimIQ @Jamarcaledon1 They weren't always considered to be so.
885471848321998849 2017-07-13 12:11:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MuslimIQ THANK YOU. Why is it so hard for my fellow white Americans to concede that we are only one part of it? It doesn't diminish anyone.

885223027151130630 2017-07-12 19:43:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @chucktodd Oh I've thought this all along. They've spent decades teaching people to distrust independent sources.

885133671447101440 2017-07-12 13:48:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Gus_802 And I'll go on record as a Democrat & HRC supporter that I want to know if they actually had anything.

885061226744688642 2017-07-12 09:00:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HuffPostUKPol @UKIPNFKN @RosanneJedly They should have waited for those before triggering A50 imho.
885061053348012032 2017-07-12 08:59:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @UKIPNFKN Good. The bill is a huge power grab.
885048439335211008 2017-07-12 08:09:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenKamalaHarris @cpowers @mandalinn25 Nobody who makes that argument understands how it works. That's why they are so easy to con.
885048087365996544 2017-07-12 08:08:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenKamalaHarris @geigernet @FrellingDone covered bcuz of seemingly unrelated existing condition. 2
885047322425659392 2017-07-12 08:04:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenKamalaHarris @geigernet @FrellingDone Clearly Ira never worked in insurance. I was customer service rep; a good portion of calls was explaining that routine things weren't 1
885046498731446272 2017-07-12 08:01:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenKamalaHarris @CateDelia @gpliafail @MichaelOwerri This is a point that needs to be made clearer, perhaps. The people who vote for these guys are the ones they're trying to get rid of.
885045833711972352 2017-07-12 07:59:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenateMajLdr @SenKamalaHarris @sasyecat @PunnedIt55 @LorenzoQ Yeah well he got his, who cares about anyone else?

885044915008397312 2017-07-12 07:55:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenKamalaHarris In practical terms I will be unable to move back to USA if this passes. Been diagnosed w/mild chronic condition in UK but it's on the list.
885044276610179072 2017-07-12 07:52:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BrexitBin @GeoffreyDWest @Hyfaidd There is some evidence that it might be in some cases, but it's down to lack of enforcement of employment law & ppl being underpaid, not EU.
885042910357573633 2017-07-12 07:47:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CraigGrannell They have long since ceased being Conservative in any true sense. They are regressive and extreme isolationists.
885040383578734593 2017-07-12 07:37:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EmporersNewC @Independent @paulanthtaylor Aside from the fact that US is a federation of states, could argue that agreements like NAFTA = loss of some sovereignty, as w/any treaty.
885038876930318337 2017-07-12 07:31:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Excellent thread. Many of the things the UK complains about the EU for were in fact their idea, or they played a big part in creating.https://twitter.com/EmporersNewC/status/884474494512975872
884816832376516608 2017-07-11 16:49:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ezlusztig They should have been doing this all along.

884744574811471872 2017-07-11 12:01:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Amy_Siskind My first thought when I learned about the actual voter suppression was that we got played. I was one of those who said it couldn't happen.
884742373271580674 2017-07-11 11:53:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JonnElledge My husband would love it.

884738256776179716 2017-07-11 11:36:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @funder @cadeduelg @LoveNOLA4ever I kind of doubt he was naked. My understanding of that allegation is that it was to defile bed Obama slept in, not about sex at all.
884718622928764928 2017-07-11 10:18:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @perlmutations I'd like to know if the meddling also affected state & congressional races.

884714516365312000 2017-07-11 10:02:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PreetBharara @lilyX68 @susiemcdonnell I think the dominionist/prosperity gospel beliefs of GOP & their backers are a prime example of how political power corrupts religion.
884713263593918465 2017-07-11 09:57:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PreetBharara Yup. Hint: covering yourself in flags and screaming "Americaaaaaaaaa!" on the 4th of July doesn't cut it.

884689589901959168 2017-07-11 08:23:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @peterdaou Absolutely. They are using his behaviour to distract from their own. They know they are doing something wrong.

884205412010119168 2017-07-09 00:19:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @thehill @AndyByrneWriter This is kind of striking that we keep calling the Prez the "boss" of Congress. The branches are co-equal. Congress is not subordinate.

884079912050622464 2017-07-09 16:00:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ericgarland Correct me if I'm wrong but they're both senators & can't actually do anything to start impeachment process. So no real action can come yet.
884054486406369281 2017-07-09 14:19:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @naretevduorp Why not save money on security & just become a vassal state to Russia? It's inefficient to protect our independence.
884036067070029829 2017-07-09 13:06:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LiberalJaxx @DustinGiebel @catawu Yes of course. We have magic powers to make people act in potentially treasonous ways, but tragically can't use that power to win elections.

883015491937337344 2017-07-06 17:31:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TwitterMoments I've seen this all over today & to me the funny part is that cuneiform tablets likely have nothing to do with Christianity - too old.

881129765016678400 2017-07-01 12:38:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MitzieHunter @MaryamMonsef @kimucooper @MrsDByers @CANFIRST @Alex_Panetta @Forbes @RySciDean @ReelLiveFilms @ron_diggity @Seanmaire Thank you for your vote of confidence. I'm not sure we deserve it.
881129075099783169 2017-07-01 12:35:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @MichelleObama @kharyp @ManualLabor1 Really? I don't like the woman but she's free to do what she likes with her body. Slut shaming is not cool.
881127427283595264 2017-07-01 12:28:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JasonKander Are you aware of this effort?https://twitter.com/mikefarb1/status/881114910075359232
881126918573219840 2017-07-01 12:26:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HickeyWriter  Something similar happened to us.
881126408910667776 2017-07-01 12:24:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HickeyWriter It's way worse now than it was for me. I moved here while Blair was still PM.
881126057641947136 2017-07-01 12:23:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDems @janemerrick23 @GaryLineker @NickyShepard @MargaretLodgeLD @andynash Indeed. Labour are not being kind at all.
881125283830616064 2017-07-01 12:20:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NP_Lima @joswinson @marbessa1 @samallennn @Samir_Dathi How much more shit would the country have been with an unfettered Tory minority government? We see right now exactly how awful they are.
881123813886496768 2017-07-01 12:14:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GOP @JuliaTherese3 @Cyndee00663219 @mikefarb1 Have you coordinated with other efforts like @letamericavote ?
881123065870118912 2017-07-01 12:11:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GaryLineker @ssamani I think there's a pub meet up in London this week. Some MPs will be there. I'm sure I can get you an invite, Gary!
881119796854763520 2017-07-01 11:58:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HickeyWriter The number is surely so tiny that I can't understand the rage this notion has induced. But I can glimpse a bit of why people are resentful.
881119218950909952 2017-07-01 11:56:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HickeyWriter themselves. So in that sense I think that people who aren't contributing shouldn't get benefits. But does anyone actually do that? 4
881118848304517124 2017-07-01 11:54:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HickeyWriter because it would have jeopardised my application for ILR. It does seem wrong that someone could move here & not be able to support 3
881118464756375553 2017-07-01 11:53:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HickeyWriter many hoops and meet certain financial standards, and my spouse was for all practical purposes unable to claim benefits he was entitled to 2
881118009796046848 2017-07-01 11:51:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HickeyWriter See, this is where I can kind of understand where brexiters are coming from. As an immigrant myself (non-EU) I had to jump through 1
881114920712011781 2017-07-01 11:39:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Good explanation.https://twitter.com/1000cuts/status/880818517544775682
881112901779681282 2017-07-01 11:31:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jk_rowling Too bad he's well known as a teetotal. No excuse.
881111530879766529 2017-07-01 11:25:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HickeyWriter This is exactly what should have been done in the first place I think. Apply the existing restrictions properly & fairly.
881110131781627906 2017-07-01 11:20:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Channel4News @1michaelgray1 @MV4100 @JamesJo64540595 @hal_westergaard Exactly. He has shown that he wants the same hard brexit as the Tories, so he has no interest in remainers.
880964680956559360 2017-06-30 01:42:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BrettArends They opened the damn gates. Fifth column.

880936905587798016 2017-06-30 23:51:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SarahLudford @iguardans I thought the point of the tweet was that there won't be anyone to pick them, right?
880936367752085506 2017-06-30 23:49:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDems @janemerrick23 @GaryLineker @andynash @NickyShepard @MargaretLodgeLD Why, so they can continue to back the Tories?
880924062444400641 2017-06-30 23:00:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Join the Thunderclap. To coincide with mass  protest on 1/07/2017. Remind Labour they shouldn't ignore Remainers.http://thndr.me/k6ZaIf
880901070750449666 2017-06-30 21:29:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @andynash Or one of those giant Galaxy bars.
880900959425220609 2017-06-30 21:28:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @andynash Me too.
880885618045267972 2017-06-30 20:27:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @iguardans @SarahLudford The UK will grow cherries. Enough of Spanish or Turkish cherries! But who will pick them? People from the City, I don't think so.
880880411643129856 2017-06-30 20:07:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> What do the Koch brothers & their associates really want? Total domination. Quite terrifying.http://www.slate.com/articles/life/history/2017/06/james_mcgill_buchanan_s_terrifying_vision_of_society_is_the_intellectual.html
880870228892282881 2017-06-30 19:26:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Shareblue @GOP @docrocktex26 @pricklyeater I heard the national anthem on TV yesterday and it made me well up. So much has been lost.

880868501124263936 2017-06-30 19:19:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Paul1Singh Join @LibDems. Best way to change party policy is to vote at conference, coming up on September.

880835350125477888 2017-06-30 17:08:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RupertMyers @jmnox Problem is Corbyn does. And my own MP.
880815582614085633 2017-06-30 15:49:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @liamyoung @SandraGreechan If you want to read the entire detailed record of the debate it's here: https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2017-06-29/debates/D199DEF4-2B92-4D43-BF7D-01F7D98591A3/EconomyAndJobs#division-8277
880815458705969152 2017-06-30 15:49:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @liamyoung @SandraGreechan Lib Dems abstained because the amendment essentially tried to implement the Labour manifesto, including I think leaving single market.
880813988543594496 2017-06-30 15:43:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @liamyoung LDs abstained from the vote because it was a Labour manifesto motion. Abstention is not the same as voting with the Tories.
880774542041509888 2017-06-30 13:06:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IndivisibleTeam Should we call the governor's office or the secretary of state, or both?
880758955680698368 2017-06-30 12:04:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @thomasbrake Surely now is the time to capitalize on this revolutionary spirit & stand as leader? We'll have the Queen in sandals in no time!
880758549453967360 2017-06-30 12:02:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @VeroVero777 @smilinglaura @MrMirth @debjpope @RichNP from listening to Joy Division and the Cure, with a bit of Sex Pistols thrown in. Older British people I know tell me how grim it was.

880757524810661888 2017-06-30 11:58:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NP_Lima @joswinson @marbessa1 @samallennn And introducing tuition fees in the first place? And rushing to back Tory brexit plans? And failing to stand up for EU citizens?
880742789981638656 2017-06-30 11:00:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> There are 3 separate anti-Brexit ECIs that are in need of your support, and also that of non-UK EU citizens as well! http://thndr.me/819uXb
880736785327935492 2017-06-30 10:36:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Daily_Express @jacquep Indeed. If it's a nightmare for you, then perhaps you drive too fast.
880736331923640324 2017-06-30 10:34:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Gotta click on it and read the whole thing. But yes clever.https://twitter.com/nytmike/status/880466509641986049
880734949476847616 2017-06-30 10:29:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DevonFoodLovers If #NationalCreamTeaDay were an American thing, we'd simply mix the jam & cream together & sell it in a squeezy bottle. Problem solved! 
880734294515339265 2017-06-30 10:26:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> When I first moved here I imagined that "cream tea" meant putting whipping cream in your tea. #NationalCreamTeaDay
880730495834886145 2017-06-30 10:11:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @hopenothate Like hell it wasn't a hate crime. These attacks should be called for what they are. Terrorism.
880728379699462145 2017-06-30 10:03:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JuddLegum Yes, because bullying and childish insults against someone who holds less power than you is the very pinnacle of nobly "fighting back". 
880727228908281856 2017-06-30 09:58:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @solange_lebourg @Paul1Singh @RebetikoWalrus I'll be happy to be wrong but seems that yet another competing party will only fracture resistance to Tories even more.
880727020157718532 2017-06-30 09:57:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @solange_lebourg @Paul1Singh @RebetikoWalrus Of course not but who's willing to stick their neck out? Nobody at the moment. Too much entrenched power within parties.
880726619723321345 2017-06-30 09:56:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @VeroVero777 @smilinglaura @MrMirth @debjpope @RichNP Yes, because I was thinking of skinhead punk/ska scene of the 80s. Carried to the US to an extent, many ppl I knew glorified it.
880725977357316097 2017-06-30 09:53:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDems @solange_lebourg @Paul1Singh I might change my mind though, depending on how things go.
880725730971222017 2017-06-30 09:52:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @solange_lebourg @Paul1Singh Do the @LibDems need a reboot? Yes. But influencing an existing structure makes more sense to me. Like US #DemEnter.
880725246600413184 2017-06-30 09:50:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @solange_lebourg @Paul1Singh I voted no, because starting a whole new party seems impossible. Everyone wants a UK Macron but I don't think it can be engineered.
880724828973617152 2017-06-30 09:48:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @franceshinde @sarasheridan @Paul1Singh No but it's always been a central policy for the @LibDems.
880722814818553857 2017-06-30 09:40:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Sounds pretty familiar to anyone who watches Fox.https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/30/russia-putin-protests-police-arrests-tv-show
880710001819607041 2017-06-30 08:50:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @VeroVero777 @smilinglaura @MrMirth @debjpope @RichNP I'm thinking of skinheads & punks carrying sharpened steel combs and knives. There's a reason why 2-tone ska emerged as a protest to racism.
880709170273693697 2017-06-30 08:46:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @maddow @gfelgen @SheilaCorso Even Bush's investigation found nothing significant. There is no actual evidence that millions vote fraudulently.
880708622862483458 2017-06-30 08:44:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @VeroVero777 @smilinglaura @MrMirth @debjpope @RichNP I mean, I like punk & goth but it is not the music of happiness by any stretch of the imagination.
880708362501054465 2017-06-30 08:43:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @VeroVero777 @smilinglaura @MrMirth @debjpope @RichNP My impression of 70s/80s UK is of violence, grimness, despair. Just listen to the music of the era. Most of it is not hopeful.
880707727630237697 2017-06-30 08:40:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NeLoNe79 Labour? Hah. Corbyn is backing everything they do, so I don't think I'd even notice the difference. Corbyn wants hard brexit too.
880705675600547842 2017-06-30 08:32:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoRichardsKent @Captain_Brexit Venezuela or Cuba?
880703655720218624 2017-06-30 08:24:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GaryLineker @legsidelizzy @paxcyclist @rosepoet https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.markpack.org.uk/129190/what-the-lib-dems-have-stopped-the-tories-doing/amp/
880702884530311168 2017-06-30 08:21:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GaryLineker @legsidelizzy @paxcyclist @Gordon_Hunting And UKIP was right. I think if they'd actually had some MPs their toxicity would have been neutralised by the exposure.
880702494921433088 2017-06-30 08:20:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GaryLineker @legsidelizzy @figrat @paxcyclist I think it's pretty rich to say Lib Dems sold their souls over tuition fees while ignoring Labour's catastrophic betrayal.
880699308001112064 2017-06-30 08:07:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @VeroVero777 @smilinglaura @MrMirth @debjpope A youth by all accounts filled with despair and hopelessness? Why does anyone want to go back to that?
880698021494890498 2017-06-30 08:02:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @WeNeedEU Maybe we should organise a demonstration outside labour's headquarters.
880696735298965504 2017-06-30 07:57:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @make_trouble Anglo-Saxon approach? FFS.
880693105242058753 2017-06-30 07:42:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NeLoNe79 Yeah but look at everything Davis had said. He gives no indication of planning anything but cliff edge brexit, even now.
880692769454424064 2017-06-30 07:41:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @maddow @gfelgen @SheilaCorso All these efforts stop the poor and minorities from voting. Who does that benefit? Rich white guys.

880690710776774657 2017-06-30 07:33:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NeLoNe79 Maybe, and I'm hopeful that it is, but the people actually occupying the offices of authority have dismissed the idea.
880690292432797696 2017-06-30 07:31:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NeLoNe79 So do you want to achieve something, or just throw up your hands in despair?
880689999708082176 2017-06-30 07:30:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @maddow @gfelgen @SheilaCorso Like Kobach, and his crosscheck and voter ID obsession https://www.brennancenter.org/blog/uncovering-kris-kobachs-anti-voting-history
880689806266814465 2017-06-30 07:29:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @maddow @gfelgen @SheilaCorso Obviously they won't be dumb enough to explicitly say "rich white Republican men" but there's a long history of trying to restrict voting.
880688814217408512 2017-06-30 07:25:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NeLoNe79 Sounds great but what neither Labour nor Tories are entertaining such an idea right now

880686266475581440 2017-06-30 07:15:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NeLoNe79 But what practical action does that entail?
880587157446037505 2017-06-29 00:41:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @maddow @gfelgen @SheilaCorso Have you listened to Bannon?
880586568041472000 2017-06-29 00:39:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @pwthornton Was this a real accusation? Because holy shit that's insane.
880584872506609664 2017-06-29 00:32:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @StevenTDennis I think my eyes are gonna get stuck in the rolled position.
880584167746129925 2017-06-29 00:30:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MSNBC He picked someone competent? What's the catch?
880580711069216768 2017-06-29 00:16:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NeLoNe79 So what do you propose?
880580587031080967 2017-06-29 00:15:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDems @NeLoNe79 But I'll keep an open mind. I'm not very happy with LDs right now.
880580440209453056 2017-06-29 00:15:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NeLoNe79 After the More United people flopped getting involved in pushing the @LibDems into action seems best. New party takes too long.
880579711252008961 2017-06-29 00:12:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @maddow @gfelgen That's exactly what they want. No more voting rights for anyone except rich white Republican men.
880579403213922304 2017-06-29 00:11:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @maddow @Tanya_R_Steele Who's going to stop them?

880571132642041856 2017-06-29 23:38:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @politico He should never stop tweeting. Otherwise there'd be no communication at all.

880462639314370562 2017-06-29 16:27:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BrexitBin Trouble is, anyone who does will lose straight away. The uncomfortable truth is that more people voted leave, and it's now damage control.
880461891147091968 2017-06-29 16:24:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MailOnline @BrexitBin Here's an article from a few days ago with a decidedly different tone:https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/23/labour-young-voters-betray-brexit
880425330846158848 2017-06-29 13:58:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AJStream Actually I can't think of a question that isn't rude or else answered by "because I'm a traitor shitting on the Constitution".
880424362012233729 2017-06-29 13:55:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @matt_dathan Just goes to show that I was right not to trust him all along. He's still the same guy who abandoned me & every other remain voter.
880423969282719744 2017-06-29 13:53:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MailOnline @solange_lebourg @BrexitBin @scillsygirl Old article to boot; things have rather changed since last September!
880423486501650436 2017-06-29 13:51:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MailOnline @BrexitBin And in any case, where would we go? Labour & the Tories are virtually the same party now. It's probably better to stay in & influence policy
880423234792964096 2017-06-29 13:50:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MailOnline @BrexitBin This is from September 2016. A lot has changed since then, and in any case the leader doesn't get to set policy in the Lib Dems.
880422880722509824 2017-06-29 13:49:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Paul1Singh It's the horseshoe theory. Far left and far right are much closer together than either is to the centre.
880414741562355713 2017-06-29 13:16:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> The video is terrifying. I knew the NRA were a bit bonkers but I had never watched any of their material.https://twitter.com/ZackFord/status/880408473963556865

880329655399612416 2017-06-29 07:38:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @njagnz @vincecable @henry_morris101 @ajehals I know plenty of 40 somethings who don't even understand the basic system of gov't. It's about engagement w/world, not age.

880209452481339392 2017-06-28 23:41:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @liamyoung They complain about "playing politics" with Grenfell, Manchester, London Bridge, etc, but it's OK to screw public workers bcuz "politics"?

880118405487054848 2017-06-28 17:39:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Patronus_2017 Because many people, including me, don't know how it all works either. The difference is I'm skeptical & look up unfamiliar acronyms.

879486263371460609 2017-06-26 23:47:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Republican voters, or GOP lawmakers? Not sure they have the same ideas.https://twitter.com/PostOpinions/status/879481905703473152
879480443292311552 2017-06-26 23:24:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Greg_Palast $1,000? That's pathetic.
879471957795905536 2017-06-26 22:50:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Freeyourmindkid It's bizarre to go to a place like North Korea and encourage this kind of behaviour. NK is scary but this is just stupid & callous.
879470931923619841 2017-06-26 22:46:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @supermathskid @WriterInPyjamas Funny, uranium sequence, potassium-argon, or  thermoluminescence isn't in my Bible, nor is geological strata which is where I'd start.
879468904493535233 2017-06-26 22:38:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @supermathskid @WriterInPyjamas I'm an archaeologist, and I'm furious.
879394344771440641 2017-06-26 17:42:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AprilDelRario Happened to a friend. Was in a bicycle accident & had serious arm break. Had to ask for donations because insurance didn't cover it all.
879393448792608769 2017-06-26 17:38:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @joncstone Prejudice?
879392999431692290 2017-06-26 17:36:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RightWingWatch The sickness of the right wing imagination never ceases to amaze me.
879392019491303425 2017-06-26 17:32:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> #insecurework I'm constantly between contracts & job searching even though I have a PhD. Dumb career choice, sure, but still frustrating.
879381954738651137 2017-06-26 16:52:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @catherinemep Pretty clearly not, since they couldn't even handle EU citizens trying to apply for residence last year.
879380877398224896 2017-06-26 16:48:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mattyglesias Isn't the idea that people should be entirely self sufficient, so if you can't afford insurance then you don't deserve to have it?
879362996350455809 2017-06-26 15:37:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RepDLamborn @csgazette Frankly if you're not willing to serve anyone then why are you in business?
879362014384140288 2017-06-26 15:33:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid I've seen accusations that Hilary colluded w/DNC to try to win. Like saying that following your manager's instructions is collusion.

879348204558581760 2017-06-26 14:38:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DrJenGunter Clearly you didn't pray hard enough before he was born, or once ate processed food, or something. There's always a way to blame parents.
879311707759419393 2017-06-26 12:13:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @damocrat And I won't be going to that one, either.

879309831278120961 2017-06-26 12:06:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @willsommer How long until the token black guy realises he's just that?

879280514682716160 2017-06-26 10:09:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @bad_takes *Though as I understand it not technically in this case as there was no declared war. Sedition maybe?
879280319777648640 2017-06-26 10:08:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @bad_takes Really peculiar and alarming. Of course collusion with a hostile foreign power to cause harm to your own country is a crime. Treason.*
879267291757772801 2017-06-26 09:17:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GroverNorquist @JohnnyMcNulty Afterwards did you have a chat about personal responsibility and how that $35 would pay for her health care instead?

879061922590707712 2017-06-25 19:41:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @fschouten Man I wish I was home this week to protest this.
879061722006511617 2017-06-25 19:40:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mmfa How is it even possible to sell to the American people that colluding *with Russia* is not a crime? McCarthy must be spinning in his grave.

879056357579776000 2017-06-25 19:19:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @theipaper I can't understand the mentality of people who stay when evacs are ordered. In my home state ppl died in a forest fire bcuz they refused.

879030275367456772 2017-06-25 17:35:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ThatTimWalker @cafedelocean Sure, but then other polls say the opposite. There hasn't been a dramatic shift, I don't think. We're still pretty evenly divided.
879029416822804480 2017-06-25 17:31:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @FT @davidallengreen @hewnique I think so, but more that it was a question that should never have been asked. EU membership was never the problem.
878988922176622593 2017-06-25 14:51:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoePajak I'm not totally convinced by this argument but it's interesting.
878988392331182080 2017-06-25 14:48:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ThatTimWalker I'm not convinced that public opinion has changed that much.

878768586390687744 2017-06-24 00:15:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mapduliand @ClaireRousseau This is why I use immigrant. I'm a white middle class American in the UK but I had to go through the same process as anyone else.
878766590929629184 2017-06-24 00:07:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mapduliand It's one reason why I call myself an immigrant & not an expat.
878766201257828352 2017-06-24 00:06:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoRichardsKent @matthaig1 OMG I actually feel better after this!
878765145383727105 2017-06-24 00:01:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jeremycorbyn Cancel brexit. You know it's the right thing to do.

878758843597160450 2017-06-24 23:36:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Alyssa_Milano How about #CoreyVoteNo as well? C'mon, @SenCoryGardner, you know this book is awful and you can do better.
878757931390513152 2017-06-24 23:33:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenCoryGardner vote no on the #AHCA! Colorado voters are are asking you to protect them.
878754344828624896 2017-06-24 23:18:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sahouraxo Well I'm pretty damn outraged.
878752246330253313 2017-06-24 23:10:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ryxnf It's like the critics never thought of, you know, saving up for things you want, even if you don't earn much.

878745562304184321 2017-06-24 22:44:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @puppymnkey @QuabbityAshwitz I think a bunker would be a better bet. We're all dead in the event of a nuclear war anyway.

878671704863776768 2017-06-24 17:50:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ShadowingTrump Well since they are trying to make it impossible for anyone except rich white men to vote it makes perfect sense.
878669583326093314 2017-06-24 17:42:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @puppymnkey @QuabbityAshwitz Brazil nuts are apparently radioactive. One of the may useful things I learned from @qikipedia.

878640704251207681 2017-06-24 15:47:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Sime0nStylites The problem here is assuming we aren't being ruled by a rabidly xenophobic government that has absolutely no concern for our wellbeing.
878608349008474113 2017-06-24 13:38:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenJohnMcCain How does that square with gutting the EPA, mainlining fossil fuels, and failure to invest in green tech? You're a fraud, senator.

878028199082446848 2017-06-22 23:13:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Gus_802 I pretty much ignore most media these days. At least the constant breathless commentary variety. I don't care what the pundits think at all.

877855441912516608 2017-06-22 11:47:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Jonnyhibberd Oh I know. It's just a criticism of the ideas underlying the article itself.
877855111053287424 2017-06-22 11:45:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AP @redsnoopystock Honestly I think they believe that health care is only for rich white fundamentalist Christians. If you get sick it's divine punishment.
877844454320652289 2017-06-22 11:03:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CNN So damn angry. This is beyond barbaric. What the hell are these cops so afraid of? It's absolute cowardice to hide behind a gun.
877843888240721920 2017-06-22 11:01:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Jonnyhibberd Not in your comment specifically but I've seen this posted a lot today & many implicitly accept idea that fruit picking is undignified work.
877843664491298818 2017-06-22 11:00:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Jonnyhibberd Though I'm not comfortable with the implied view that this kind of work is not valuable or is beneath British workers, tbh.

877782934098411521 2017-06-21 06:58:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @FT @ainomiadue Worst part is that the general public has been persuaded that these guys are the economically intelligent ones. But really they're crooks.
877782374792052736 2017-06-21 06:56:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SimonTilford Wasn't johnson fired for lying in the papers? And after his interview the other day he's clearly not keeping up with reality.
877781834293227520 2017-06-21 06:54:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDems @timfarron @Andy_T_ He helped increase the number of MPs, and only resigned as Lib Dem leader. He's still an MP...

877680769816309761 2017-06-21 00:12:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @VABVOX False, and not even a particularly remarkable win.

877679581238624257 2017-06-21 00:08:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @alaindebotton Just remaining and implementing the powers we already have would be better.
877678454963154944 2017-06-21 00:03:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @docrocktex26 @Purify_toast17 But did they actually get the same stuff? I thought that's what all the Cambridge Analytica targeting was about.

877660325599948802 2017-06-21 22:51:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TheDemocrats @DrJasonJohnson @JoyAnnReid The only question is why the @DNC doesn't employ these proven strategies everywhere.
877657954199252993 2017-06-21 22:42:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @kushkandy95 There must be some charities that help. @VoteRiders is one I know of. But I'd contribute to ID crowdfund.

877555429068464129 2017-06-21 15:54:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jeremycorbyn @AngelaRayner Parliament is really childish. The first time I watched PMQs I was really taken aback.
877554978570809344 2017-06-21 15:53:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @johnredwood I should note that I'm unemployed half the time because my field is so dependent on short term contracts. I've been out of work since Jan.
877554632922451969 2017-06-21 15:51:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @johnredwood That's 2x what my husband makes & 4x what I make, and we have a pretty solidly middle class life. I'd say 70k is pretty rich.
877515564213784576 2017-06-21 13:16:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mollyesque @TheAtlantic @TheAtlPolitics However my initial expectation was that he'd be crushed in the first round, so there's that.
877515346940489728 2017-06-21 13:15:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mollyesque @TheAtlantic @TheAtlPolitics Yes and no. Personally I'm astonished that he did so well but of course a bit disappointed that he didn't win.
877483452458819584 2017-06-21 11:08:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @Peston Is it? Does it have to be announced?

877273685077499904 2017-06-20 21:15:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @POTUS @SenMarkey @tedlieu @cudell59 @BeachBreeze2 @accidntlmystic Not 45 alone. Years of @GOP extremism and partisanship have brought us here. 45 is the result, not the cause.
877272058379554816 2017-06-20 21:08:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidPepper @SenCoryGardner I hear you're supposed to be on the committee but they aren't even letting you in. Are you going to stand for that?
877270484508966912 2017-06-20 21:02:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @VoteRiders @b_schaffner Is "Washington Times" even a reputable source?
877262983684136960 2017-06-20 20:32:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @kitchencookshop Seriously? Hahaha!
877262327489454082 2017-06-20 20:30:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tanguyvl Cheers from London. Same thing here when this crap happens.
877259967627132928 2017-06-20 20:20:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump I suggest you watch this movie. Old but the trauma of seeing this haunts me every time you mention nuclear weapons. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_After
877257431792979968 2017-06-20 20:10:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @indivisiblefrr I've tried to call @SenCoryGardner office in Colorado Springs several times and got a message the mailbox was full. Not cool.
877254606497206272 2017-06-20 19:59:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidLammy Thanks, David. I'm not in your constituency but I do appreciate your efforts.
877254269849616384 2017-06-20 19:58:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PressSec @DavidCornDC @dvorakoelling @PopeFusty @1PercenterHater  or  perhaps?
877254021513437187 2017-06-20 19:57:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PressSec @DavidCornDC Kinda hard to be at the party when they slam the door in your face and lock it.
877253357878095872 2017-06-20 19:54:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @johnastoehr @yashar Is it just me or is it kind of funny that even the lawyers have lawyers?
877253149718962176 2017-06-20 19:53:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @thehill @Robert_Brown0 @TXhistorylover @kushkandy95 @LLVJEN It's clear that privatising services leads to cutting corners, lower safety standards, and exploitation of workers. Not good for ATC!
877252578026954753 2017-06-20 19:51:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GOP @AJStream @P_Strickland_ It's depressing as all get-out, as we say in the Midwest. Hard to put in the effort to make dramatic changes in such helpless circumstances.
877252241790513153 2017-06-20 19:50:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GOP @AJStream @P_Strickland_ I have relatives in similar towns. The local economy has been gutted by big retailers & nobody has those old subsistence skills anymore.
877251878228303872 2017-06-20 19:48:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GOP @AJStream @P_Strickland_ #AJStream Investment in small business, sustainable local agriculture, education programs, and mental health care would help.
877251421305004033 2017-06-20 19:46:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AJStream @P_Strickland_ These are the people who will be most hurt by the @GOP plans to cut welfare and the invasion by big companies such as wal-mart.

877182073202757635 2017-06-20 15:11:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tribelaw @Scotladywriter I think this is a big part of everything. They just hate Obama. Racism pure and simple.
877179770441781248 2017-06-20 15:02:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MarkWarner @usedoriginals They undoubtedly are. I expect it will be stolen.
877177891213246464 2017-06-20 14:54:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sarahwollaston Oh? Virtually every academic I know is making plans to leave or at least considering it. Funding, jobs, security all under threat.
877177502472581121 2017-06-20 14:53:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Whyjay99 @WriterInPyjamas I'm a little disappointed that they got my name right.
877175209219981312 2017-06-20 14:44:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @funder The only unity they cared about is their own club of right wing extremists.

877131973323632640 2017-06-20 11:52:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EdwardJDavey @edofmund Sure but do we need two co-leaders plus a deputy? Or am I misunderstanding what you mean?
877115859097067520 2017-06-20 10:48:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @colinrtalbot @clacksee @richarddmorey @31ltolox I've had the same experience. Some even told me that the actual Home Office link I sent them was not from a reliable, true source!
877113999590133761 2017-06-20 10:40:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @J_amesp Early death so I don't have to worry about my lack of retirement savings thanks to chronic under-employment and low wages.
877113287690911745 2017-06-20 10:37:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ThatTimWalker He's not my favourite candidate for other reasons, but yeah. Clinton is 69. May is 60. Bernie Sanders is 75. His age is not a big issue.
877112454341427201 2017-06-20 10:34:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> I've emailed my MP @jarrowstevemp and @jeremycorbyn to say I swapped votes to keep #ToriesOut but I don't support hard brexit. Do the same!https://twitter.com/Jonnyhibberd/status/876851543982649344
877110216625717249 2017-06-20 10:25:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RawStory These people are so incredibly stupid and dangerous. They don't know what they are asking for. A nuclear strike anywhere will hurt us all.
877108558193713152 2017-06-20 10:19:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> No matter how inept May is, Cameron is ultimately responsible for this mess.https://twitter.com/TestimonyBrexit/status/877103830135164928
877107652937043971 2017-06-20 10:15:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @joncoopertweets I won't be breathing any sighs of relief until Pence is gone. He is dangerous and people don't recognize it. Hypnotized by a snake.
877107340520062976 2017-06-20 10:14:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IronStache @timjhogan This is awesome. I'd love to have people with proper trade experience in congress. Good luck, and I hope other @DNC people see this!
877104267252948992 2017-06-20 10:02:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @colinrtalbot @clacksee @richarddmorey @31ltolox 3/ I still blame May for the failure to implement any of the immigration controls we already had. That should be a bigger story.
877103993612357632 2017-06-20 10:01:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @colinrtalbot @clacksee @richarddmorey @31ltolox 2/ triumphantly announce a new compromise that would implement the power the UK already had. Also sack May & put in someone better.
877103644558200833 2017-06-20 09:59:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @colinrtalbot @clacksee @richarddmorey @31ltolox I've been saying this for ages. All Cameron needed to do was to say "OK, we'll go away and think about this", bury it for 6 mos, and then 1/
877102680828760065 2017-06-20 09:55:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @esme_hornbeam If you voted tactically then write to your MP and to @jeremycorbyn to tell them!
877100827487481858 2017-06-20 09:48:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Reps in WI just advanced a measure to officially join the call for a constitutional convention. If they get 2 more states then US is over.
877100466907357188 2017-06-20 09:47:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @davidallengreen @michael__42 Like wild animals lashing out when trapped.
877099944980750336 2017-06-20 09:44:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @davidallengreen Though arguably this is good because it means the adults, that is the EU, might actually have gotten through to the bratty UK.
877099407405142016 2017-06-20 09:42:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EdwardJDavey @edofmund Just seems unnecessary since we only have 12 MPs to have 3 leaders in Parliament!
877074820218990592 2017-06-20 08:05:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MichelBarnier @EU_Commission @glenn_bosmans @JoRichardsKent @paulphi77055145 They kind of already have though.
876927761113329677 2017-06-19 22:20:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TopherSpiro @smilon713 @big_perez Exactly. I have no problem with my tax dollars helping the less fortunate. Even if they don't "deserve" it.

876926639799664640 2017-06-19 22:16:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @KillerMartinis These mofos have the nerve to accuse us liberals of needing safe spaces etc but they can't handle a freaking *play*?

876923948788850690 2017-06-19 22:05:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @normanlamb @LibDems @MikeNicholas2 @Mickft @EdwardJDavey @A_C_McGregor @AuldNick1 Labour were also hard brexit but the discourse around it has changed a lot in the last week.

876921745982316544 2017-06-19 21:56:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EdwardJDavey @edofmund Why is that needed if Jo is deputy, though?

876886353837010945 2017-06-19 19:36:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BrexitBin Not a surprise.
876886221838045186 2017-06-19 19:35:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LittleGravitas @jonlis1 They want it to fail. I'm convinced they have no intention of making a deal. They want their tax haven & we're all hostages.

876882619903954945 2017-06-19 19:21:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Idea that #Ossoff is a "carpetbagger" bcuz he lived in another district is pretty rich coming from ppl who worship a New York con man.

876719109198798849 2017-06-19 08:31:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sarahwollaston @JoRichardsKent We should be calling it "Vote Lies" instead of Leave, because that's what it was.
876718780843470848 2017-06-19 08:30:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sarahwollaston No they didn't. The Leave side constantly carped on about the "Norway model", even though it was repeatedly shown to be nonsense.

876716811001233408 2017-06-19 08:22:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ThomasPride Every building must be inspected for dangerous faults and corrections fully funded, but the solutions won't be the same for every building.
876716364467253248 2017-06-19 08:20:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ThomasPride The big problem with Grenfell is that the design failed. Lots of reasons for that but sprinklers alone wouldn't have prevented it.
876715711732875265 2017-06-19 08:18:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ThomasPride That's not to say the HOP should take priority over making residential buildings safe. Every one with cladding must be inspected urgently.
876715237797482497 2017-06-19 08:16:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ThomasPride It really depends on the building. Calling for sprinklers everywhere is not necessarily the answer. They are very different buildings.
876591150295121920 2017-06-18 00:03:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Raffi_RC Pretty much exactly what she's saying though.
876590698799263746 2017-06-18 00:01:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TakedownMRAs @bumbling_bea @scoofusandruter And being savagely abused and taken advantage of.
876590232145186816 2017-06-18 23:59:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TheRickyDavila @MrFrankBaraan @Alyssa_Milano @tedlieu @DebraMessing @DearAuntCrabby @JohnLeguizamo @NathanLerner @JoyAnnReid @joncoopertweets @funder Um. Can anyone show me an example of a legit Democrat doing any of this stuff? It's ludicrous.
876589300095365121 2017-06-18 23:55:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MrFrankBaraan @Alyssa_Milano @RVAwonk @DearAuntCrabby @MaxineWaters @TheRickyDavila @NathanLerner @joncoopertweets @JoyAnnReid @JohnLeguizamo @funder I dgaf what your version of God intended, Handel.
876575958127579136 2017-06-18 23:02:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @grahambsi The first prominent politician to stand up and lay out all the ways leave lied & manipulated ppl will win the next election imho
876572160625700872 2017-06-18 22:47:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IrishTimes @pplwhocantpark Primark Tories. Excellent moniker.
876571585142022144 2017-06-18 22:45:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @alexandraerin @okamen75 That is truly one of the weirdest things I've ever seen.
876570927751942145 2017-06-18 22:42:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @dontbrexitfixit @MrGToYou Please contact your MP and tell them how you feel! They need to know that people are changing their minds.
876422896360587265 2017-06-18 12:54:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @transatlantic Consider the theory that the plan was to destabilise EU and US alliance and it makes perfect sense.
876422140706344960 2017-06-18 12:51:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @margarance @ottocrat No. I don't think so.
876419335245496320 2017-06-18 12:40:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @caro20005 I don't think he has the capacity to reflect on it in that way, though. All us plebs err & think they want to rule & not just asset strip.
876416495009636352 2017-06-18 12:29:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @michaelgove @JolyonMaugham @fish_in_a_hat I need to start learning French or German stat.
876412996309975040 2017-06-18 12:15:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @michaelgove @JolyonMaugham @fish_in_a_hat *whimper*
876402648601292800 2017-06-18 11:34:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @imchip I think we elected them & they put the clown suits away.
876399770830614529 2017-06-18 11:22:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @liamyoung @LittleGravitas Well if they do manage to secure power under an even more authoritarian person with Victorian values, maybe it would be worse.
876182085895168010 2017-06-17 20:57:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @blackgirlinmain I don't even know what to do but I'm trying to learn. Don't know if I'm as brave as Portland guys but I'll try.
876180069470928896 2017-06-17 20:49:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CindyDPishere Awful. Why's it seemingly common for foster parents to be so horrifically abusive? & why isn't it taken seriously as flag for other crimes?
876176252431994880 2017-06-17 20:34:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @grahambsi The only good brexit is a revoked brexit.
876175354796232706 2017-06-17 20:30:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jonworth What planet do these people come from?
876175079087984646 2017-06-17 20:29:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @liamyoung @LittleGravitas Are any of them acceptable? The danger is they actually win & we get someone even worse...
876174836544012288 2017-06-17 20:28:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sox_morgan @CNN And I should have read further to see that lots of others made the same point... D'oh!
876174296338624512 2017-06-17 20:26:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @eyejosh @markpalexander I'm continually amazed at how much power I apparently have as a remainer.
876169211248357376 2017-06-17 20:06:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LittleGravitas @liamyoung Gods, not another one...
876166726022549504 2017-06-17 19:56:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BrexitBin Remain?
876166431456579586 2017-06-17 19:55:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @diponte But we had the power to implement all of this stuff without brexit. So what's different about this?
876165550522675200 2017-06-17 19:52:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sox_morgan @CNN OK the way this is worded makes it sound like the gunman is the one who was drafted.
876164594284277760 2017-06-17 19:48:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @602Erik Duh... That's what I get for tweeting at the pub!
876155627478945792 2017-06-17 19:12:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @johnredwood You are living in fantasy land.
876155452375146496 2017-06-17 19:11:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @602Erik Sums it up except you forgot "Republican".
876131011691778048 2017-06-17 17:34:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDemPress @C_I_Nimod But they are an official party communication channel so I don't get your point.
876061898290147328 2017-06-17 13:00:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDemPress @C_I_Nimod But where do you get the idea they have no MPs? There are 12!
876061103469604864 2017-06-17 12:56:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> DAUK speaker just described trump's ideological position as "bullying anarchism". Spot on! @DemsAbroadUK @DAUKWomenCaucus
876052634079301632 2017-06-17 12:23:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Excited for the @DemsAbroadUK boot camp. I've been looking forward to learning more about how the org works & getting caught up w/everyone!
876030172604112896 2017-06-17 10:54:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @UKLabour @liamyoung @rowenavalerie @morrispexmouth Party should not matter. Every human being should care about this.
876029178445004801 2017-06-17 10:50:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RVAwonk @MatthewACherry @LindaChapin4 And they have the nerve to call us snowflakes who are afraid of everything & need safe spaces.
876028494802812928 2017-06-17 10:47:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MatthewACherry Absolutely infuriating. May be virtue signaling but I'm white and I'm angry. These racist cops do NOT have my support. They aren't heroes.
876027772132610048 2017-06-17 10:44:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean @lostindisco @in_confidential @EuEthnic @tony_nog @SKZCartoons I think there is an underlying truth here. Remain campaign was inept bcuz it was aimed at other Tory members more than the public.
876010474546057216 2017-06-17 09:35:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BBCr4today How much more worst case do you want? And your record shows you don't take that advice anyway.
876004775879376896 2017-06-17 09:13:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDemPress @Addy_Atky Indeed. And they still don't understand that the numbers didn't work with Labour then or now. And Labour don't want it.
876003036627337217 2017-06-17 09:06:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDemPress @C_I_Nimod Er, they have 12 MPs, which is more than they started with.
876002755772641280 2017-06-17 09:05:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDemPress @clacksee @clifford0584 @MuscleYoda @StayWellNFire Yeah but are they willing to risk their political careers? That's what got us into this mess in the first place.
875874223478251520 2017-06-16 00:34:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Why are people attacking the police over this fire? What did they have to do with it?
875873153519689728 2017-06-16 00:30:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CNNPolitics @NancyRHM @BillMcG65 Likely to be his own loose lips though.
875872997843881985 2017-06-16 00:29:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CNNPolitics @PrincessBravato @tech_52 @Janedrummer I'm thinking they feel they already have the vote stitched up. Way too confident.
875871238249472001 2017-06-16 00:22:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> I make no secret of this. Our own gov't has shown it is disastrously incompetent. We need protection from them!https://twitter.com/tony_nog/status/875853567302787073
875813537679110145 2017-06-16 20:33:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Celeste_pewter Could you tell that to @SenCoryGardner ? Earlier this year he accused constituents calling from non-CO numbers of being fakes.
875805564944740353 2017-06-16 20:01:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BrexitBin @pete_wack Does that make us British citizens viruses, then?
875803395713585152 2017-06-16 19:52:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Honestly I think they already have & that's why they're so smug.https://twitter.com/Monique_Sonya/status/874329728865386496
875802753955766272 2017-06-16 19:50:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SarahLerner @IrfanSabrina It's all they know how to do it seems
875801529449578496 2017-06-16 19:45:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @davidfrum @TheAtlantic Can't say I'm unhappy about it. I'm all for intelligent border control but the wall was stupid & Dreamers are just as American as I am.
875796860199477249 2017-06-16 19:26:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @krishgm Of course she shouldn't have been walking around without security but she could have met with a group of representatives of the residents.
875796115651801088 2017-06-16 19:24:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> This thread. I don't understand why anyone who has first hand knowledge of mining w/o safety gear wants to go back.https://twitter.com/SkeddyRuxypin/status/875794577755578368
875791175264993288 2017-06-16 19:04:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @theobertram Why is she so awful at showing any connection? It's baffling. Should not be so difficult.
875790831927611394 2017-06-16 19:03:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @theobertram @MsMainstay It's too bad, really. I rather liked him.
875788166124404737 2017-06-16 18:52:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @timfarron @normanlamb @toadmeister @gardensinboots @mrchrisnewton @TomBracey @EugeneWattson Because he got raked over the coals for trying to explain it once already? But agree that he did a poor job of handling it.
875784410766901249 2017-06-16 18:37:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @johnredwood As soon as they let us know what that is I'll consider it.
875783455539421184 2017-06-16 18:33:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sox_morgan @greg_doucette And doubtful how much he's helping those other places either...
875782627185360896 2017-06-16 18:30:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @guardian He emphatically did not seek to impose his religion on others. It's a complete lie to suggest he did.
875781485156073472 2017-06-16 18:25:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @davidallengreen @Boon2bewild I haven't eurocratted since 2015 when we visited relatives in France. I feel cheated.
875780439130157058 2017-06-16 18:21:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUflagmafia Utterly.
875779091315732480 2017-06-16 18:16:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @eyejosh @Harryslaststand Though in fairness that started a long time ago.
875778754127310848 2017-06-16 18:15:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Martina @peterdaou @alymdc14 @anataliedz1 I'm not saying I don't accept it, just questioning it. I don't really know who you are referring to. I certainly don't support antifa etc.
875733031973212165 2017-06-16 15:13:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @deray @LegitTarget Why does anyone who isn't a crazy fundamentalist?
875732180529541124 2017-06-16 15:09:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TheRickyDavila @darionavarro111 @DearAuntCrabby @DebraMessing @MrFrankBaraan @Alyssa_Milano @NathanLerner @JohnLeguizamo @JoyAnnReid @joncoopertweets @funder @LeyMiLia @Tit4tat11 I'm sure some are & I'm a lifelong Democrat. Most politicians have some kind of dirt. Nobody in any part of society is innocent.
875731476293328896 2017-06-16 15:07:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TheRickyDavila @darionavarro111 @DearAuntCrabby @DebraMessing @MrFrankBaraan @Alyssa_Milano @NathanLerner @JohnLeguizamo @JoyAnnReid @joncoopertweets @funder @cathymcs We surely did. It wasn't on my radar at all. I'm one of those who wanted Obama to be friendlier with Russia. Thought it would defuse tension
875730380514631681 2017-06-16 15:02:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Hugodixon @KimSJ @cxg1979 @__BarbaraAnna__ @craftybookworm Her first speech I was a bit optimistic but rather than "OK, we have this big task, let's start planning & do it right" she ignored reality.
875730027203239936 2017-06-16 15:01:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Hugodixon @KimSJ @cxg1979 @__BarbaraAnna__ @craftybookworm I do have a certain degree of sympathy but she's the one who decided to ignore remain voters and rush to trigger A50.
875721398794285056 2017-06-16 14:27:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ZekeJMiller @jimhofmann @StantonThe3rd @shtooky @mjfrombuffalo Sounds like a way to say "take back what you just said"
875720971050778624 2017-06-16 14:25:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ZekeJMiller @hopesprings46 @cin_cincc @pauligirll @TessDeco @irishroze1211 @rubybeemagic No way in hell I'd actually watch it.
875719694489178113 2017-06-16 14:20:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RupertMyers None of them seem to be interested. Maybe Davidson though.
875719393220730880 2017-06-16 14:19:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RupertMyers @mutley6969uk That's been a top conspiracy theory for a while now.
875719062512381953 2017-06-16 14:17:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RupertMyers But people like the Queen.
875717968143020032 2017-06-16 14:13:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Uberficker Problem is Pence is competent and a true believer in this Christian dominionist crap.
875687479021510658 2017-06-16 12:12:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tony_nog @Redpeter99 Who needs consumer protections?
875687476265984001 2017-06-16 12:12:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tony_nog @Redpeter99 Who needs consumer protections?
875684385432981504 2017-06-16 12:00:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ViolettaCrisis They did, yes. I think it was perhaps a bit silly because it was such a localised incident but I was asked & I'm nowhere near there.
875683820690976768 2017-06-16 11:57:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CornishSkipper I really wish I had the option.
875683189418864640 2017-06-16 11:55:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @trevdick @valerimelnyczuk Send him a postcard now saying you don't support it.
875682955003387904 2017-06-16 11:54:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Uberficker I still think Pence is worse.
875682543181352960 2017-06-16 11:52:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tony_nog @SarahLudford @DevonKiwi @kornelia38 @doan1935 @JohnTughan I'm a UK/US dual citizen. I'm absolutely mortified by the behaviour of both the countries I love.
875682232966549504 2017-06-16 11:51:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tony_nog @SarahLudford @DevonKiwi @kornelia38 @doan1935 @JohnTughan Arguably in circumstances where your country is behaving badly shame is a highly patriotic response. I know we can do better.
875681816463757312 2017-06-16 11:49:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tony_nog @JohnTughan @SarahLudford @DevonKiwi @doan1935 @kornelia38 Ask UKIP & brexit backers. Manipulation to serve very narrow interests, not the public at all.
875681270004674560 2017-06-16 11:47:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tony_nog @JohnTughan @SarahLudford @DevonKiwi @doan1935 @kornelia38 Well actually we were a leading country in the EU until certain elements decided they'd rather cede influence for misguided idea of control
875680820505305089 2017-06-16 11:45:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tony_nog @JohnTughan @SarahLudford @DevonKiwi @doan1935 @kornelia38 And you blame that on the EU?
875642065295597568 2017-06-16 09:11:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JolyonMaugham And there's a whole camp of ppl, including vice president Pence, who say there is no evidence that smoking is harmful.
875637680746373120 2017-06-16 08:54:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SarahLudford The original version I took had quite a bit about the EU, or at least the study guide did. That was 2011 when I took that, I think.
875637223470678017 2017-06-16 08:52:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SarahLudford How can we improve knowledge? It would be beneficial to everyone if people were better informed, regardless of party or political views.
875636361205698562 2017-06-16 08:49:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @camanpour @RosChappell @481Dunford properly we could be driving EU wide immigration reform which is what people say they want. 2.
875635897529548800 2017-06-16 08:47:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @camanpour @RosChappell @481Dunford Why? I don't understand logic that UK would be "castrated". This affirms the powers we had under the EU all along. If we exercised them 1/
875635152809897985 2017-06-16 08:44:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @camanpour @RosChappell Lots of people have been pointing this out. Maybe it should be a central feature of next @LibDems campaign?
875634286619119617 2017-06-16 08:40:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tony_nog @JohnTughan @SarahLudford @DevonKiwi @kornelia38 @doan1935 Then again in working for Lib Dem campaigns this year I encountered many who don't know they aren't voting directly for PM. Crazy.
875633974235643904 2017-06-16 08:39:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tony_nog @JohnTughan @SarahLudford @DevonKiwi @kornelia38 @doan1935 It's shocking. I only really know what I learned in studying for Life in the UK test, but it's really not that hard to understand.
875633672237363201 2017-06-16 08:38:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @timfarron @normanlamb @toadmeister @gardensinboots @mrchrisnewton @TomBracey @EugeneWattson I don't see why. It's a fundamental misunderstanding of what "sin" means to him. It's not a synonym for unacceptable or disgusting.
875631413936009217 2017-06-16 08:29:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tony_nog @JohnTughan @SarahLudford @DevonKiwi @kornelia38 @doan1935 Which contributes to the false idea that all EU politicians are unelected, and lack of engagement with what goes on there.
875623809511899136 2017-06-16 07:59:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tony_nog @JohnTughan @SarahLudford @DevonKiwi @kornelia38 @doan1935 Hence the number of people who are surprised to learn they can actually vote for them.
875623641097973764 2017-06-16 07:58:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tony_nog @JohnTughan @SarahLudford @DevonKiwi @kornelia38 @doan1935 I mean that domestic politics doesn't acknowledge their existence or importance so nobody pays attention.
875623422251773952 2017-06-16 07:57:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tony_nog @fish_in_a_hat Fair enough. Vast majority of politicians seem to have swallowed this.
875623005493145601 2017-06-16 07:56:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tony_nog @JohnTughan @SarahLudford @DevonKiwi @kornelia38 @doan1935 They're also routinely ignored in domestic politics so there's not much point running big campaigns. Self fulfilling cycle.
875622342067601410 2017-06-16 07:53:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @timfarron @normanlamb @toadmeister @gardensinboots @mrchrisnewton @TomBracey @philrees2010 Saying "we're all sinners" means "we can all improve".
875621951393349632 2017-06-16 07:51:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @timfarron @normanlamb @toadmeister @gardensinboots @mrchrisnewton @TomBracey @philrees2010 It doesn't even mean that. In the Xity I grew up in sin is about improving your own behaviour. It's not a judgment of non-believers.
875621178718658560 2017-06-16 07:48:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @timfarron @normanlamb @toadmeister @gardensinboots @mrchrisnewton @TomBracey Because sin as he means it is a theological concept. It doesn't mean a simplistic "bad thing that must be stopped".
875620604371587073 2017-06-16 07:46:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tony_nog @fish_in_a_hat But everyone seems so sold on this fantasy land idea I think it's hopeless. UK is determined to turn itself into irrelevant backwater.
875620352889507840 2017-06-16 07:45:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tony_nog @fish_in_a_hat Only thing I can think to do is write postcards to every member of Labour Party & tell them we don't want this
875619479350239234 2017-06-16 07:42:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidCornDC @bgkittrell @GaeaM004 And we've had republicans esp. pushing this "gov't should be a business" line for decades. You can't just fire citizens (legally anyway).
875618653294649344 2017-06-16 07:38:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidCornDC @DanMeersand @Chelu61Frye Wilfully ignorant and closed to any info that would contradict his self image. Like much of his base.
875618291577798656 2017-06-16 07:37:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidCornDC I think it's pretty clear that he didn't, and he understands very little about how gov't works at all. He only wanted $$ and adoration.
875500182615490561 2017-06-15 23:48:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MrMarkJeffery @StephenMangan They'd have to have enough humanity to notice it themselves...
875499612714532865 2017-06-15 23:45:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @normanlamb @SarahLudford I was referring to this. Not sprinklers per se but included better fire safetyhttps://politicalscrapbook.net/2017/06/new-fire-minister-was-among-72-tory-landlords-who-voted-against-homes-fit-for-human-habitation/
875497423619190785 2017-06-15 23:37:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @normanlamb @SarahLudford Ask the Conservatives that voted it down, perhaps?

875496835728764928 2017-06-15 23:34:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Bournemouth4EU And silly songs!
875496499974680576 2017-06-15 23:33:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @timfarron @normanlamb @toadmeister @gardensinboots @mrchrisnewton Can you give me an example of Farron saying something offensive about a person because they are gay? And no, "sinner" doesn't count.
875496104070086656 2017-06-15 23:31:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @timfarron @normanlamb @toadmeister Not all Christians are extremists who want to impose their views on others. Farron is a prime example of this.
875472539740405761 2017-06-15 21:58:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump Because she's not the president. You are.
875471737349079041 2017-06-15 21:55:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> You too, @SenBennetCO, @SenCoryGardner, and @RepDLamborn. This isn't a partisan issue. Tax system isn't fit for Americans living overseas!https://twitter.com/FedupUSExpat/status/875246759143915520
875470723271335937 2017-06-15 21:51:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @politico I mean I know this is about Dems backing off but with other things I've read today maybe Reps will do something on their own?
875469329793462273 2017-06-15 21:45:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @politico @meechebucco Well those victims were not rich, white, conservative men, so...
875469073395699714 2017-06-15 21:44:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @politico Huh. Maybe going after a white Republican will finally get them to see sense? We aren't asking for all guns to be outlawed.
875468790020100096 2017-06-15 21:43:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @miss_s_b She doesn't need to ask permission. That's the point.

875442488974036992 2017-06-15 19:58:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MarianneSansum @Kimila111 @liverpoolscm I accept, as in acknowledge, the result. That doesn't mean I think it was a good idea nor that I can't seek to change other peoples' minds.
875442003005194240 2017-06-15 19:56:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @OwenJones84 @sirstan74 Bigly.
875441580902985728 2017-06-15 19:55:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @OwenJones84 You are only stirring shit, and you know it.
875413610503299072 2017-06-15 18:04:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Paul1Singh @cakeylaura And Labour are trying to destroy the Lib Dems, so I don't see how this works.
875413400800636933 2017-06-15 18:03:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Paul1Singh It's kinda weird how not gaining a majority is being treated as a sweeping victory.
875400378803793921 2017-06-15 17:11:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Martina @peterdaou @alymdc14 @anataliedz1 I'm willing to accept that I may be wrong but I haven't seen it. I've been called names from the L but only had rape threats from R.
875399958844907520 2017-06-15 17:09:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Martina @peterdaou @alymdc14 @anataliedz1 I don't think that is true. Is there a far left equivalent to Stormfront, 4chan, Breitbart? How many far left mass shooters have there been?
875399380362301441 2017-06-15 17:07:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RepDLamborn I'll hold you to that, Doug.
875398322256785409 2017-06-15 17:03:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @timfarron Your staunchly liberal stance on separating religion and politics renewed my faith in politics. I'm sad to see you step down.

875276798220574720 2017-06-15 09:00:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HansNiesund @lsebrexitvote Despite all the terrible things about them I will be very grateful if the DUP end up being the ones that force us to cancel brexit
875275336791068672 2017-06-15 08:54:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SteveBakerHW @goddersbloom Arguably we're coming together against brexit, finally....
875275155915911168 2017-06-15 08:53:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @goddersbloom @Scott_AW_Brown Yes, me too. Oh, it's in ALL CAPS? OK THEN I'LL JUST ABANDON ALL MY PRINCIPLES AND CLEAR EVIDENCE OF HARM AND DO WHATEVER YOU SAY!!
875273882835582976 2017-06-15 08:48:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jonworth Such utter stupidity. Every day I think that I need to wash my hands of this place and move to France or something.
875271723591098368 2017-06-15 08:40:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mrjamesob @ariichN7 @emtaylor_3 @misssmithtweets She'd give whatever answer was necessary though because she's obviously nowhere near as principled as Farron. She has an anti-LGBT+ record.
875271234409418755 2017-06-15 08:38:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mrjamesob @Rosie_Rocket @margarance The subtext I've heard though is that ppl within the party have attacked him & drove him to this. Spectacular own goal if true.
875268778279526400 2017-06-15 08:28:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @WillBlackWriter OMG what? Where did you hear this & how credible is it?
875268400301453312 2017-06-15 08:27:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Interesting thread (though I gotta say the overuse of emojis in it really bugs me).https://twitter.com/ChristynRoyce/status/875114101575360512
875266848002101248 2017-06-15 08:20:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mrjamesob @ariichN7 @emtaylor_3 @misssmithtweets His record shows he did. This is an extremely illiberal attack on the man from those who claim to be liberals themselves. I'm disgusted.
875263664969977860 2017-06-15 08:08:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @janehparkinson @_HughFriel I'm so incredibly furious about this, especially since it seems to have come from within.
875263038168936448 2017-06-15 08:05:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tony_nog @JohnTughan @kornelia38 @SarahLudford @doan1935 It's amazing how many don't know they vote for MEPs. Civic knowledge is catastrophically poor it seems.
875262434109476864 2017-06-15 08:03:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Byline_Media @J_amesp @Catmatthias I'm glad you explained the joke. I've lived in the UK for 14 years & have carefully avoided all knowledge of Eastenders.
875261138497396736 2017-06-15 07:58:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JamieRoss7 Could be be any more sycophantic and grovelling? Complete brown noser.
875258990258786304 2017-06-15 07:49:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SpeakerRyan @Amy_Siskind @tweetiestate @janwilliamsteam Or the child killed during the attack on *Representative* Gabby Giffords.
875258544513265665 2017-06-15 07:47:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SpeakerRyan @Amy_Siskind And they seem to have forgotten Gabby Giffords entirely. Oh yeah, she was a Democrat and a woman, so I don't think she counts.
875137980964507648 2017-06-14 23:48:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Sooner rather than later one hopes. Ideally while we can still revoke A50.https://twitter.com/GaryBucannon/status/874974022794174468
875131837177368576 2017-06-14 23:24:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DRUDGE_REPORT Obviously the people who are protesting it haven't read the play. It doesn't really go well for the assassins.
875126266097258497 2017-06-14 23:02:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @antonymciver Me neither. 
875126009598791685 2017-06-14 23:01:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AdamBienkov @crispy_bart Because Farron dared to have beliefs he doesn't like. I believe the irony is lost on him though.
875123443297120261 2017-06-14 22:51:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AdamBienkov The point of being a liberal, though, is that regardless of what he believes he stood up for other people's right to hold different ones.
875120553904025600 2017-06-14 22:39:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @dailykos @Sasman7G08 Apparently it's killing everyone in Syria judging by today's news.
875113953378086912 2017-06-14 22:13:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Freeyourmindkid I  DEEP STATE
875112640292560901 2017-06-14 22:08:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SarahLudford @JulianTooke Actually yes, in that you are entitled to think those things. It's imposing your beliefs on others that's wrong, and Farron never did.
875111999600029696 2017-06-14 22:05:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SarahLudford This article sums it up well, thanks.
875106371141816320 2017-06-14 21:43:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Kimila111 @ljostro @MarianneSansum @Architarist Mass produced American style beer instead of real ale...
875105593215913984 2017-06-14 21:40:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RVAwonk This. I don't have a problem with trained people owning handguns. I have a problem with vigilantes owning military weapons.
875103846376382465 2017-06-14 21:33:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NBCNightlyNews @CuzinCletus What the hell do they have to do with it?
875100984619433985 2017-06-14 21:21:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DotLepkowska @WriterInPyjamas I missed this. What happened?
875100298217390080 2017-06-14 21:19:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @drvox They are all hopelessly corrupt as far as I can tell.
875097616283049984 2017-06-14 21:08:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @timfarron @SarahLudford Amen, ironically. And it's infuriating.
875096790432960513 2017-06-14 21:05:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump You and your party are deliberately sabotaging the market in order to make it fail. We see you.
875095836451110912 2017-06-14 21:01:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Kimila111 @ljostro @MarianneSansum @Architarist Good analogy! Also raising the price of a pint so much that you can't afford your favorite beer anymore anyway.
875095084433367040 2017-06-14 20:58:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HumzaYousaf @dan_colbourn He screwed up on his response but yes, it was clearly disproportionate. When was May questioned, yet she actually voted against LGBT rights?
875094506428825600 2017-06-14 20:56:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HumzaYousaf Other people wouldn't let it drop. I've seen plenty of comments from people saying that his beliefs are incompatible with being a leader.
875094111736537089 2017-06-14 20:54:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @lordbonkers @jessicaelgot @CreswellJoss He's certainly been unfairly hounded by the press. I'm not even particularly christian and it's been pissing me off.
875092392705130497 2017-06-14 20:47:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @lordbonkers @jessicaelgot You're not the only one. I'm furious that he seems to have been forced out because of his religion.
875059793660182530 2017-06-14 18:38:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @funder Unsurprising?
875059355078586370 2017-06-14 18:36:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @UKMoments He's been hounded out by the hypocritical criticism of those who demand conformity. He didn't force his religion on others. 
875036367952240640 2017-06-14 17:05:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidLammy Oh wait I should have read the whole thread...
875036072677433350 2017-06-14 17:03:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidLammy Is it best to give money at this stage though? If so do you know a good organisation to give to?
875035421360762882 2017-06-14 17:01:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @KillerMartinis Well it was a woman who was shot last time, so...
875035163251675137 2017-06-14 17:00:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TeaPainUSA Of course it is.
875034884112338944 2017-06-14 16:59:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @angelcakephotos @EL4JC @shaw_shaw6 @icklepickle An insult to the fine people of Byker though...
875033344173539329 2017-06-14 16:53:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TheRickWilson @Phoenix2a1 @ScottDaniel It's a really annoying problem. A dehumidifier works wonders though.

874986128348262400 2017-06-14 13:45:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Kimila111 @ljostro @MarianneSansum @KarenChipps The whole referendum and the many years of EU skepticism see like a cynical ploy to divide and conquer.
874985791184928768 2017-06-14 13:44:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Kimila111 @ljostro @MarianneSansum @KarenChipps However way you slice it the result shows a deep divide that must be rectified. I don't like the way that the ultra rich are destroying us.
874985335624749056 2017-06-14 13:42:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Kimila111 @ljostro @MarianneSansum @KarenChipps In fact I would. Despite being a horrible liberal I've been saying for a long time that politicians need to listen to the marginalised.
874984820824301568 2017-06-14 13:40:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @solange_lebourg @alastairburt @IMusgrave @tony_nog @PipFlhone I think the truth of his brexit stance will come out and damage him. Perhaps it's just wishful thinking.

874973742027464709 2017-06-14 12:56:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @KitemanX I just can't anymore with these people. Ape is not a species. Human is.

874955056394756100 2017-06-14 11:41:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidJo52951945 This has about as much credibility as trump's millions of illegal voters. Notice how quickly that died because it simply isn't true.

874923784129712132 2017-06-14 09:37:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AppSame @AC360 @M2Chalet @Juliana4984 @MediaShrink Great example of actual hysteria there. Thanks.
874921372891435010 2017-06-14 09:28:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @paddyashdown @PAHarper I mean as a party, not necessarily individual MPs.
874921220785016834 2017-06-14 09:27:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @solange_lebourg @gummitch_uk I still think that something could be done. Of course we'd have to be knocked down a peg or two but we deserve it quite frankly.

874916725174800384 2017-06-14 09:09:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @bbclaurak Please try to convince the gov't that it's a good idea. May is finished no matter what, this way she could play Snape & go down a hero.
874915685314461697 2017-06-14 09:05:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @gummitch_uk @solange_lebourg I reckon that with the right approach they'd do both. Not optimistic that anyone will take that approach of course.
874915438324535303 2017-06-14 09:04:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @paddyashdown @PAHarper And the Tories have clearly demonstrated that the national interest means nothing to them.
874915288634077184 2017-06-14 09:03:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @paddyashdown @PAHarper @IvanTheTerabyte There is a case from our point of view but not from the Tories'. I don't think it's an option bcuz neither big party will ask.
874914865772728320 2017-06-14 09:02:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @KateHoeyMP @mikeysmith @juanincognito @katgrant30 @s_preval I know you are but I've talked to a shocking number of people who were not.
874914677217787904 2017-06-14 09:01:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid @johnastoehr @Scooterstation @MissBilious @NanInKansas @kathleenwattle The left is dividing itself. We are already divided. Just going back and reading this thread shows that while I'm on the left, I disagree.
874914095329366016 2017-06-14 08:59:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @gummitch_uk @solange_lebourg Wasn't there a statement by someone that they'd extend the timetable for the new government?
874913338173640704 2017-06-14 08:56:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoRichardsKent I've been wondering for ages whether May & Co are secretly part of the crazy dominionist christofascist crowd, or funded by them.
874912210924994560 2017-06-14 08:51:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TheNewEuropean I want to know how many people really did a tactical vote or vote swap, and how many of them voted Labour purely to stop the Tories.
874910937886666753 2017-06-14 08:46:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @paddyashdown @Swallowboat A coalition with Labour would still have been a minority government IIRC. Not enough numbers.
874910358221336577 2017-06-14 08:44:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @paddyashdown @PAHarper @IvanTheTerabyte Tories have shown that they're totally willing to stab their partners in the back & overturn agreed policies ASAP. Why would LD trust them?
874909939273273346 2017-06-14 08:42:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @paddyashdown @PAHarper The Tories didn't even ask, I'm sure, & after the last coalition the Lib Dems were unfairly blamed for every Tory policy & nearly destroyed.
874909453065355264 2017-06-14 08:40:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @paddyashdown Talk to Labour about that...
874909029545410567 2017-06-14 08:39:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mrdavidwhitley Because we've tried and tried to explain this benefit but got shouted down by people who refuse facts. Project fear and all that bullshit.
874908606235365378 2017-06-14 08:37:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> This. Plenty of people have loudly explained the benefits of FOM. But ppl persist in their xenophobic beliefs.https://twitter.com/jet_set_jill/status/874900404546523137
874907491540381698 2017-06-14 08:32:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @barneyfarmer @melelloyd Hard to say. Other than a return to a feudal system I don't know what they truly want.
874907068263694337 2017-06-14 08:31:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @barneyfarmer Does it even really save them that much money?
874906889657700352 2017-06-14 08:30:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @solange_lebourg @gummitch_uk Which they have signaled that they would.
874905469214744576 2017-06-14 08:24:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tnewtondunn @mikejkelly01473 Which is why I have never understood why A50 was triggered when it was. Why not wait to see who you'd be dealing with?
874904863209140225 2017-06-14 08:22:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @tnewtondunn If this was a Mercer plot to create disarray & bring down EU alliances it has succeeded spectacularly well.
874900570405994500 2017-06-14 08:05:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @eisingerj @ProPublica @JustinElliott @jp_dutch It's all about him.
874900451749187585 2017-06-14 08:04:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @eisingerj @ProPublica @JustinElliott @jp_dutch Yep. No regard whatsoever for the good of the country. There never was.
874898829589524481 2017-06-14 07:58:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @eisingerj @JustinElliott @AlwaysSayYes @PM_StrayDogg @SEAsports253 @geekwitch @grtamericanovel @3kids4gkids @TheJeffDrake I think he's been convinced by the "president can't have conflict of interest" argument & thinks he can pardon everyone incl himself.
874897849917616128 2017-06-14 07:54:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nickjbarlow Sounds good to me. Of course there are things I don't support in the Green Party but I don't think our views are all that divergent.
874895887536934913 2017-06-14 07:46:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @KateHoeyMP @mikeysmith @juanincognito @katgrant30 @s_preval I'm flabbergasted at the number of people who honestly think that is the solution...
874894843960582144 2017-06-14 07:42:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> This is really terrible in the true sense of the word. Horrifying foresight. https://twitter.com/DawnHFoster/status/874811533741764608
874894374894792704 2017-06-14 07:40:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DawnHFoster Run by a tenant's group, I think? I might be misunderstanding just what that is & how it's staffed though.
874892100223086593 2017-06-14 07:31:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IanDunt @JimmyRushmore @Mito1071 of the way we are distributed around the country. With the reality of FPTP & the leave vote in some areas we'd never win solely on remain 2.
874891189568368641 2017-06-14 07:28:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IanDunt @JimmyRushmore @Mito1071 I may well be wrong, but what choice did we have? Even if everyone who is remain voted LD/Green/etc it wouldn't have got enough MPs bcuz 1
874890599702425601 2017-06-14 07:25:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IanDunt @JimmyRushmore @Mito1071 Indeed. But I thought Labour might be more interested in taking a rational approach that doesn't end up creating a tax haven.
874889569585561600 2017-06-14 07:21:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IanDunt @tony_nog @LiamBlizard @JXB101 @hewbass Wasn't there a statement from Juncker or someone earlier this year calling for just that type of reform?
874888503317889025 2017-06-14 07:17:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RadicalAssoc Just came across you yesterday and I like what I see!
874888231258656770 2017-06-14 07:16:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @timfarron @LibDems @mikeysmith @RadicalAssoc @HuwSayer I'll join as soon as I find my membership card...
874738394726846465 2017-06-13 21:20:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @timfarron @LibDems @mikeysmith @RadicalAssoc @HuwSayer Indeed! Excellent stuff.
874735715539660804 2017-06-13 21:10:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RadicalAssoc @timfarron @LibDems @mikeysmith @HuwSayer Ooh, thanks! Didn't know about them. I think I can cope with the kind of radicalism the Lib Dems are likely to offer!
874731491976253440 2017-06-13 20:53:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @olgaNYC1211 @sidnknj Pretty sure it's not the same entity my grandma taught me about.
874730638242394112 2017-06-13 20:50:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mikegalsworthy Gods I hope someone uses it.
874730472424828928 2017-06-13 20:49:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @WestmonsterUK @MikeH_PR @dasvee Is that what happens if you use heavy water in your ink?
874729273516576769 2017-06-13 20:44:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BeardedGenius @RidarKh I'd actually find her funny and her weird faces endearing if she wasn't so evil. She reminds me of my mother in law but without the empathy.
874725039672832002 2017-06-13 20:27:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CloughOlive Yes. Of course she is.
874724399026511872 2017-06-13 20:25:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BrennanCenter How can he if it's not true?
874724076270518273 2017-06-13 20:24:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @WillBlackWriter This week? No. But a lot sooner than 5 years.
874723887099064322 2017-06-13 20:23:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @acgrayling @fish_in_a_hat Maybe we should turn up with "I voted tactically" signs.
874723320926801920 2017-06-13 20:21:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @UsVsThemBlog @mviser Why would he need it? He was there...
874722542736592896 2017-06-13 20:18:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @truthout That sentence fills me with anger and sadness.
874717807572865024 2017-06-13 19:59:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid @johnastoehr @Scooterstation @MissBilious I can't see how one can read that, compare it to Coulter, and conclude that Reid is worse.
874716527655833600 2017-06-13 19:54:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EricBoehlert Boo hoo. He was always a racist jerk.
874715347340996608 2017-06-13 19:49:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @therealcornett Damn, my eyes hurt from rolling them so hard.
874706973190742016 2017-06-13 19:16:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SarahLudford Weaken the Tories, yes.
874706650740948992 2017-06-13 19:14:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @margarance Now we just have to get Corbyn to understand...
874704641040285697 2017-06-13 19:06:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PickardJE How many civil servants can you name? Fame does not equal importance.
874704431648034816 2017-06-13 19:06:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @alexpiletska Fair point. I did find it quite funny that they literally thought it was a lie that those were the rules.
874704127137337344 2017-06-13 19:04:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Kimila111 @MarianneSansum You must not talk to yourself very often then.
874703264775884801 2017-06-13 19:01:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @margarance I'm convinced their plan was to crash out with no deal immediately after the election.
874699773244305408 2017-06-13 18:47:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @dailytonic This is why I voted for it in Colorado. Legalisation is one step to reducing the power of criminal gangs.
874699292308631553 2017-06-13 18:45:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BBCkatyaadler Yeah there was a unity of purpose all right. We voted tactically against her to get her out & she lost her majority.
874697383497609216 2017-06-13 18:38:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDemPress @csibike1 @DamienVFletcher @AngryRemainer @HilaryBurrage @EUtopean @RebetikoWalrus @PartPeculiar @MsAlliance @clacksee @DefeatBrexit17 @ModPolUK @fish_in_a_hat @sxybio Indeed. They are both authoritarian and conformist in different ways.
874696198971695106 2017-06-13 18:33:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sarahposner @KevinMKruse So much winning...
874695708250693633 2017-06-13 18:31:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PickardJE Genius for May to call the election, wasn't it?
874693918675406852 2017-06-13 18:24:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @alexpiletska I have referred people to the Home Office website to back up a point & had them claim it was not a reliable source of info!
874687529110429696 2017-06-13 17:58:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IsolatedBrit I guess this is the solution to the brexit related destruction of my industry...
874686352767549440 2017-06-13 17:54:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ClareFoges @Lottieogorman Journalists seem to be terminally unable to think in any kind of nuance, only blanket stereotypes
874685930472439812 2017-06-13 17:52:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @timfarron @SkyNews @Clarkiee Wherever people seem to think remain voting citizens go. I've been told several times I should be deported because I want to stay in the EU.
874685552695660547 2017-06-13 17:51:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Kimila111 @MarianneSansum So you'll never vote again because you did it once then, eh?
874685330636644358 2017-06-13 17:50:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Kimila111 @elizabethjgrey @MarianneSansum I don't recall that the ballot paper said I had to shut up. And I don't intend to.
874669978678693888 2017-06-13 16:49:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MSNBC Lol
874669446023065600 2017-06-13 16:47:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @timfarron @SkyNews @Clarkiee Yeah but by the logic that only leave voters get to have a say she should have been deported already
874668276672065539 2017-06-13 16:42:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @timfarron @SkyNews @Clarkiee Then May is out. Don't forget she was for Remain.
874667987206320128 2017-06-13 16:41:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MarianneSansum @Kimila111 Well I'm one of the people and I voted remain. Do I not count anymore?
874663872443101189 2017-06-13 16:24:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @WomaninHavana @paulcolbeck1 Certainly some of us are incandescent...
874660824740241408 2017-06-13 16:12:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @kurteichenwald @docrocktex26 @nutmeg3isme @littlejackie66 His plastic wrap exterior seems to be keeping him looking clean though.
874659065032564737 2017-06-13 16:05:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RationalWiki Heck I'm just a social scientist but once I learned about LaTeX I was sold. Much easier than word!
874613108182052865 2017-06-13 13:03:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @UKLabour @mainvision @zeospike @tony_nog There's a petition plus a postcard campaign. I emailed my MP as well.
874611652104265728 2017-06-13 12:57:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @dykiri Aw man, I wish I'd gone down to have a look!
874604759105318912 2017-06-13 12:29:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @thedailybeast @TheRickWilson I believe they are all complicit and expect gerrymandering and voter suppression will keep them safe.
874601897835065345 2017-06-13 12:18:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @megynkelly @Trumpnado2016 Exactly. You want to shine a light, shine it on his lies and abuse by talking to his victims. You're only making him look legitimate.
874597355487715328 2017-06-13 12:00:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @megynkelly @nbc @fawfulfan They should cancel it because it's abusive lying bullshit. Cons invented this story because the truth threatened their gun fetish.
874596156231364608 2017-06-13 11:55:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TimAlberta @politico Not being allowed to do that is not oppression. It's completely fatuous to think that it is.
874596014044438528 2017-06-13 11:55:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TimAlberta @politico I find this under siege mentality surprisingly offensive. I don't care if you're religious but I do object to you forcing it on others.
874594947206455297 2017-06-13 11:50:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @OwenJones84 Might be counting chickens before they're hatched. Lots of us centrists voted Labour to stop the Tories, not because we endorse Corbyn.
874592786305224705 2017-06-13 11:42:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @funder Like I told my husband last night, trump projects so much he might as well be an IMAX screen.
874583800700948482 2017-06-13 11:06:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Sign the open letter to Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May calling for Proportional Representation! #MakeVotesMatterhttps://www.makevotesmatter.org.uk/open-letter-2017
874581103562158080 2017-06-13 10:55:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @docrocktex26 @kurteichenwald Honestly at this point I think it's all deliberate. A massive con to get Pence in office so he can bring on the theocracy.
874580674329686016 2017-06-13 10:54:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TRobinsonNewEra @LeslieKrupp @NatalieTudor Can you please give me a single concrete example of "creeping sharia law", and what exactly you think sharia is?
874579856171958272 2017-06-13 10:51:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @lisaocarroll They are. The whole approach has been to act like the EU went on the attack which is utterly preposterous.
874579025485803521 2017-06-13 10:47:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mattzarb @OwenJones84 @tony_nog Exactly. Following a pattern of promising everything to everyone but ultimately I don't think it will be successful.
874578288513089537 2017-06-13 10:44:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @cmclymer Interesting thesis. Hope someone with more knowledge than I have on the subject weighs in. But it does jive with the rabid anti-woman stuff.
874576724171915264 2017-06-13 10:38:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> And May has made climate enemy Gove environment secretary. Way beyond the #NastyParty, now downright hateful party. #CoalitionofCrueltyhttps://twitter.com/IslingtonLibDem/status/873112794496868352
874576190463512576 2017-06-13 10:36:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IslingtonLibDem Good! They deserve it.
874575072283037696 2017-06-13 10:32:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Samfr @notsouniquename @Lord_Boothby Indeed it's why my other half voted for Heidi Alexander.
874574229353705472 2017-06-13 10:28:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Alas I'll be out of town.https://twitter.com/CatfordBeerFest/status/873816860432748548
874574129785180160 2017-06-13 10:28:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Unbelievably irresponsible to make this suggestion.https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/12/gunowners-could-help-fight-terror-attack-says-police-commissioner
874532391901167616 2017-06-13 07:42:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> I've had a report that there's a film crew at #Lewisham Town Hall in #Catford. Anybody know what they're filming for?
874414986780696576 2017-06-12 23:55:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ToryFibs But it is the halt on May that I voted for...
874270162463199232 2017-06-12 14:20:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @metpoliceuk I hear so many people on motorcycles flying down the road here. I'm always afraid I'll hear a crash right after they go past.
874269388794417152 2017-06-12 14:17:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IndivisibleTeam See also @DAUKWomenCaucus. We have scripts, and tips for Americans abroad who want to stay involved!
874269072174837760 2017-06-12 14:16:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Samfr @notsouniquename That's why I did vote swap but also did a ton of volunteer work for the Lib Dems in seats we could win.
874268695987671041 2017-06-12 14:14:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CNN And?
874268604778393600 2017-06-12 14:14:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @docrocktex26 @VABVOX I feel conned. I didn't pay that much attention & I did count myself as a Sanders supporter for a while but I've changed my mind.
874266317922197506 2017-06-12 14:05:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RichardJMurphy Lib dems are, at least amongst ourselves!
874265176937291776 2017-06-12 14:00:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Samfr @notsouniquename Don't think so. Lots of remainers voted Labour in the hopes that they'd be more rational about brexit.
874264353272365056 2017-06-12 13:57:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mikercameron @Samfr @GBClarkson Absolutely this. Almost everyone I know either voted tactically or did vote swap, & some usually don't vote but did this time. Against May.
874263499995836416 2017-06-12 13:53:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @arothwp Wow. Seems very dangerous thing to do, I salute them.
874262215095930880 2017-06-12 13:48:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EdwardTHardy @projectfarceuk Well it will be painful, may require a very long recovery period, and will probably do permanent damage, so pretty apt.
874261856407482368 2017-06-12 13:47:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EdwardTHardy Let's hope so. That is why many #Remainers voted tactically for @UKLabour in the hopes of a hung parliament & stop to hard #brexit.
874260582698029056 2017-06-12 13:42:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @danmericaCNN @TheCostOfEnergy @KsKM3 I'm sure it's an act anyway. Trying to gain sympathy.
874260334583984128 2017-06-12 13:41:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @danmericaCNN @karesf @Doyouhaveaflag They've got a factory in China making them. Or maybe it's Turkey?
874260142681935877 2017-06-12 13:40:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @danmericaCNN You reap what you sow, Ivanka.
874257875232751616 2017-06-12 13:31:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PCollinsTimes But I think his programme is authoritarian in a different way and undeliverable if brexit goes ahead.
874257583971946497 2017-06-12 13:30:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PCollinsTimes Well, don't discount the huge tactical vote campaign. I and many others voted Labour to keep May out. Corbyn seems slightly more rational.
874254172111208451 2017-06-12 13:16:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @lanieleaf @carolecadwalla @eyejosh Quickly, I hope.
874252720957513729 2017-06-12 13:11:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IsolatedBrit @JamesMelville Projecting, just like her mate trump, eh?
874250909504745476 2017-06-12 13:03:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ShiptonMartin I'm quite concerned that it will.

874181088507301888 2017-06-12 08:26:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Sums it up well. I'm surprised that Labour did so well but I am still no of Corbyn.https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/10/i-was-wrong-about-jeremy-corbyn-still-doubt-him

874172797379104768 2017-06-12 07:53:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @supermathskid @aipsmith @SarahJLonsdale Have you seen the petition to tell Corbyn that a tactical vote was not support for brexit, or the call for a postcard campaign?

874168313173221376 2017-06-12 07:35:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JeremyCliffe @BrianMyrieSalsa I've been waiting for some evidence of this for a year but they seem to be doubling down on the denial.

874166429779709952 2017-06-12 07:28:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JeremyCliffe @walkerno5 @NaomiLWood I think there's a postcard campaign to tell Corbyn that tactical voting to stop May  support for brexit. Maybe pointless but a start.

874164115698307072 2017-06-12 07:19:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @lauferlaw Imagine the howling and instant action if a Democrat had tried this line of attack. We'd have a new president by the end of the week.

874001030996013056 2017-06-11 20:30:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mikegalsworthy @arronz82 I think we didn't do so well for 2 big reasons: 1) fear of Tory majority and 2) the tactical voting message was muddled.

873979324189245440 2017-06-11 19:04:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @20committee @sox_morgan I think so. See @Greg_Palast for instance. Lots of people in minority areas were kicked off rolls and given provisional ballots.

873931714661421056 2017-06-11 15:55:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sonofr I'm one. I did a vote swap but only because Tories were worse.
873931132928229376 2017-06-11 15:53:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @FT @solange_lebourg Might be actually advantageous to have them prop up Tories then, depending on what else they insist on
873862645123776512 2017-06-11 11:21:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @impeach_d_trump @Stephademic They wouldn't care even if they were aware. Total lack of compassion.

873859258990948352 2017-06-11 11:07:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @faisalislam @Mrs_Anna_B I think brexit in any form is damaging but it is possible to make it slightly less disastrous.

873854784683593729 2017-06-11 10:49:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mrjamesob @honestyiskey68 Tactical voting against the Tories. Many people I know do not support Corbyn or brexit but were more opposed to the Tories' cruelty.
873852299239620612 2017-06-11 10:39:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @joncstone @buildcyclelanes Lots of us didn't. We voted against May.

873840984030924800 2017-06-11 09:55:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @simon_schama @BBCNewsnight @jamesgerrard Perhaps we should start a letter writing campaign.
873840712902733825 2017-06-11 09:53:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TheRickWilson @respectlearning @artkincell @LisaBrite @kahir165 Example? What do you mean?
873840546493739008 2017-06-11 09:53:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Oh wait I'm thinking of Abu Qatada. His case was an example of good diplomacy by convincing Jordan not to use torture.
873837831298437120 2017-06-11 09:42:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> But the handling of his case wasn't a failure of political correctness as I understand it, but a failure to use the law properly.
873836985609326592 2017-06-11 09:39:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> And FWIW I've always thought that hate speech from all quarters should be more strongly addressed. I think Choudry should have been stopped.
873836583102947328 2017-06-11 09:37:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> I'm pretty ignorant about the differences. But I know that simply attacking "Muslims" as a block won't help.
873836059574009856 2017-06-11 09:35:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> But as there are hundreds of Christian sects, some of which are bitter enemies, so are there multiple Islamic sects & associated politics.
873835643985637376 2017-06-11 09:33:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> And that is the kind of response people like me object to. I have no problem acknowledging that jihadis have a theological inspiration.
873835177952325632 2017-06-11 09:31:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Those who advocate deportation, imprisonment, or even killing Muslims are no better than jihadis. But they are the loudest "anti" voices.
873834450400030720 2017-06-11 09:29:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Sure, some of us liberal types have tried to ignore the threat. Which is wrong, but so is blaming Ahmadiyya Muslims for Wahhabi violence.
873833814627373056 2017-06-11 09:26:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Thing is, most objections to Islamist extremism I've heard are also ignorant extremism. Treating all Muslims as identical isn't helpful.https://twitter.com/implausibleblog/status/873813817297383424

873830055486648321 2017-06-11 09:11:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @simon_schama @BBCNewsnight @jamesgerrard Maybe we'll finally get it after this disaster. May's approach has made no sense from the beginning.
873829671514902528 2017-06-11 09:10:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @davidallengreen @juraboat @AnnaHall32 Indeed, I'm one of those Remoaners but I can't imagine that most who voted Leave are happy with any of this.

873828295074336768 2017-06-11 09:04:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nickreeves9876 I signed. I did a vote swap because LD couldn't win in my area and to keep the Tories from a majority. It was definitely a "least bad" vote.

873592675693449216 2017-06-10 17:28:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @paddyashdown @davidjaygee @IvanTheTerabyte Which is why I left Labour & joined Lib Dems.

873586634582831104 2017-06-10 17:04:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @paddyashdown @davidjaygee @IvanTheTerabyte Yes, although I've never thought of myself as conservative in any way I actually probably agree with the more liberal Tories versus labour.
873585306217349120 2017-06-10 16:59:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @catherinemep You'll have lots of company. Many new members of the @LibDems are disillusioned Tories.

873522863734697984 2017-06-10 12:50:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @paddyashdown @IvanTheTerabyte @davidjaygee Indeed. They would not have asked Lib Dems this time & I doubt we'd accept it. Cameron for all his faults was trying to liberalise a bit.

873511646790078464 2017-06-10 12:06:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoRichardsKent @FraserNelson I honestly don't think that can all be attributed to Corbyn. Many, many people voted for Labour to keep the Tories out.
873506377762844672 2017-06-10 11:45:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sarahwollaston I'd feel much happier if brexit were being handled by a cross party group. This is not a partisan decision.

871658512723705856 2017-06-05 09:22:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidLammy It's really insensitive to plan a visit requiring massive police resources at a time when those police are being stretched.

871649456214745088 2017-06-05 08:46:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoRichardsKent Absolutely. There is a role for cyber spying, if course, but a monitored and regulated internet is an unacceptable curtailment of freedom.

871118700778323968 2017-06-03 21:37:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> An awful lot of people get every Saturday off. It's no big deal to go to a local protest for a few hours.
871117846486671362 2017-06-03 21:34:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> It's quite funny how many ppl criticising the #MarchForTruth & #TheResistance in general don't seem to understand the concept of weekends.

871109775915929600 2017-06-03 21:02:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @theintercept She's totally right. And also the fact that he's mixed race & relatively light skinned. I recall ppl criticising him as "not really black".
871080175550820352 2017-06-03 19:04:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ThatTimWalker @TunnardSandra Me too. I expected an "OK, we voted out but it was so close it we'll need 2 research how to do it, keeping everyone's interests in mind"

871076612539912192 2017-06-03 18:50:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ThatTimWalker @TunnardSandra I was quite relieved at first that she became PM. Then she showed how brittle and xenophobic she is.
871076166672756736 2017-06-03 18:48:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ThatTimWalker @kimhouten All very true. She might not have come across as so overtly xenophobic though.
871075527582511104 2017-06-03 18:46:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ThatTimWalker @EnserMark @blondebonce I'm convinced she was only a remainer because it was politically expedient at the time.
871075304474910720 2017-06-03 18:45:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ThatTimWalker Absolutely. If she'd made any kind of effort to address my concerns I would not be so dedicated to getting the #ToriesOut.

870747775234969601 2017-06-02 21:03:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mikegalsworthy Hence her eagerness to use weapons, I guess. If you can't negotiate then turn friends into enemies and threaten them.

870224955337842688 2017-06-01 10:26:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @J_amesp Indeed but the voters punished the Lib Dems even though they were quite successful at moderating the Tories.
870224587149148160 2017-06-01 10:24:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @J_amesp *uninterested. Just noticed my typo here.

870187389645467648 2017-06-01 07:56:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @J_amesp So it's popular with voters now but in my uneducated opinion the Lib Dem experience shows that ppl don't evaluate coalitions rationally.
870186914367905792 2017-06-01 07:55:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @J_amesp I hope that something like this happens. But IIRC Labour leadership were interested & the Lib Dems were unfairly ripped apart for trying it.

868769768978960384 2017-05-28 10:03:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @UKIPNFKN There wouldn't have been enough to have a majority w/Labour in 2010, IIRC, and in any case I believe Labour rejected it.
868768963668443136 2017-05-28 10:00:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AngelaRayner Yes but I think he's got more grudging respect than, say, Davis or Johnson.

868758768187822080 2017-05-28 09:20:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> This exactly. May is far too brittle and inflexible to be any good at negotiations. She's already damaged our relationship w/EU for no gain.https://twitter.com/majestic_whine/status/868715467728236544

868513093810360320 2017-05-27 17:03:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mrichardsonlaw I think their plan is to not even try to negotiate anything and simply crash out, ignoring UK obligations, citizens abroad, etc.

868446795331928064 2017-05-27 12:40:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nickconfessore Especially ppl like my dad. He was career Air Force & worked at NORAD & Space Com, still in defense. He knows very well what risks are.
868443231104716800 2017-05-27 12:26:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @proud48percent This is the main reason why I left Labour and joined the Lib Dems, at least to start with. Brexit is suicide.

868431869402128385 2017-05-27 11:41:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mattzarb I've always found the charge of "playing politics" a bit weird. That's what politicians are supposed to do, isn't it? Clue's in the name...

868411959825375232 2017-05-27 10:22:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @EdwardTHardy Money pouring in to where, exactly? There is no NATO bank account that members pay into, as I understand it.
868409285520363524 2017-05-27 10:11:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ProfBrianCox @ffapob Not necessarily but I do take your point that you mostly need to find independent means to study here. For me that's astronomical loans...

868057994591952897 2017-05-26 10:55:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mattyglesias I am curious how much effect the timing of the GE announcement had on local elections. Was it at all deliberate?
868057203508477952 2017-05-26 10:52:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> I quite like the notion of "clomping, chomping regulations" too. I'm imagining running your plans by a group of Budweiser Clydesdales first.https://twitter.com/johnnypaige/status/867438801731411968

867875984795738112 2017-05-25 22:52:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> In this I agree with and trust Corbyn much more than May. It's perhaps too late but he was right.http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/jeremy-corbyn-anti-intervention-middle-east-manchester-attack-libya-foreign-policy-a7752706.html

867836052131721217 2017-05-25 20:13:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JamesMelville 4,000? That seems shockingly low for any major city, even if terror threats were not a thing.
867831297074487296 2017-05-25 19:54:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MagpiesView Lib Dems definitely did. I'm a party member and I got an email telling me so straight away.

867281606616199168 2017-05-24 07:30:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Mikel_Jollett @RuthieKetchup It's sad because she still really thinks that food stamps are for losers. But I think she's maybe been persuaded by my mom.
867276862657003520 2017-05-24 07:11:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> This really infuriates me. trump's administration is hell bent on destroying the US's reputation.https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/23/trump-administration-manchester-bomber-name-leak
867137285640388608 2017-05-23 21:56:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Grey_Wolfcub Of course it did. That's why he's harping on them. He's part of the group w/trump and Bannon that are trying to start a "clash of cultures".
867136633375731712 2017-05-23 21:54:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Mikel_Jollett have to pay child support. So how is that situation supposed to make her feel shame for being unable to afford enough groceries?
867136346749624320 2017-05-23 21:53:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Mikel_Jollett She's now effectively a single mom with 2 kids, one with a personality disorder, and working full time. Her ex quit his job so he didn't
867135953407811584 2017-05-23 21:51:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Mikel_Jollett But I told her that if I was happy to have my taxes to go support ppl like her because she sure as hell isn't lazy. Her ex husband is.
867135602973704193 2017-05-23 21:50:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Mikel_Jollett My cousin had to apply after leaving her cheating, abusive husband. She was ashamed bcuz she bought the lie that only lazy cheats get them.

866707940568334341 2017-05-22 17:30:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mikefarb1 @Kizzysmom I honestly think the ultimate goal is to do away with voting altogether unless you're a white male property owner. That's how it was in 1776
866707536833105921 2017-05-22 17:29:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mikefarb1 @SesetatsSeditin It's way more, because every Republican voter they count conceals a billion sneaky immigrants and Democrat voters.

866257086992310274 2017-05-21 11:39:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CNN @twright55 And trump's expenses as of April (THREE MONTHS) were nearly as much as what Obama spent in TWO YEARS.http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-travel-expenses-10-weeks-us-taxpayer-fifth-barack-obama-eight-years-mar-a-lago-us-a7670541.html
866254988166791168 2017-05-21 11:30:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @alexandraerin @CatslaveCop I did some research (like actually reading the relevant bit of the Constitution) for myself.
866254769693888512 2017-05-21 11:30:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @alexandraerin @CatslaveCop Because some of her descriptions of how things work are wrong. I didn't know that when I first read them but after seeing threads like this
866254155538714625 2017-05-21 11:27:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @alexandraerin @EstelleGill10 I dread to think what your standard of sanity is.

866253338437984256 2017-05-21 11:24:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @alexandraerin @marymargaret528 For the same reason anyone debunks fake news, lies, or disinformation. If we let it go unchallenged then we allow it to be seen as fact.

865212591177596928 2017-05-18 14:28:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jtemperton @MerseyMal  I missed out on that window. A transparent effort on May's part to reduce immigration by making it too expensive.
865204269586280448 2017-05-18 13:55:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jtemperton @MerseyMal It's why I bit the bullet and did it. It still cost about 1500.

I don't know what to do to make it legal though.
865203139120648193 2017-05-18 13:51:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @carolecadwalla @guardian @FridaysFuel Is there an event in London planned?
865202499321552896 2017-05-18 13:48:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @theresa_may @TerriPaddock I'd come if we can organise one! I'll be in London that weekend.
865202319729864704 2017-05-18 13:48:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JordanUhl @AlyssaChassman I'd participate! Anyone interested @DemsAbroadUK @DAUKWomenCaucus?
865202082063757312 2017-05-18 13:47:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @David4justice48 @jeanniecwatkins Is there an official event for London? I'll be there that weekend, too!
865194023203606528 2017-05-18 13:15:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jtemperton @MerseyMal I'm not sure I'd assume that. Hell I'm a citizen now but I'm worried that somehow these rules will apply to me because I was born elsewhere.
865188795716685824 2017-05-18 12:54:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @naretevduorp Yeah well he's the smartest man in the world so he knows better, right?
865178044394344448 2017-05-18 12:11:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @77Voyager @JuliaHB1 @prstskrzkrk I have but I'm sure she hasn't. Otherwise she wouldn't spew this victim blaming nonsense.
865176355226386432 2017-05-18 12:04:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump Hmm, I don't think so. @GOP went after @HillaryClinton for decades.
865176135403024384 2017-05-18 12:03:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ViolettaCrisis @dubsteppenwolf Could you guys also do the squirrels that eat my plants, those stupid tops with the shoulders cut out, and conservatives? Thanks from a 40+!
865174454560858113 2017-05-18 11:57:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @peterdaou @Neva444 Describes much of his base too. They have a serious victim complex. And they are willfully ignorant.

865147153865428992 2017-05-18 10:08:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @kushkandy95 @BraddJaffy I guess it just burns him up that he didn't win fairly and he knows it.

864987049497174016 2017-05-17 23:32:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidKlion He's a full on christian fascist though. We'd have our theocracy in no time.
864924347651301377 2017-05-17 19:23:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jimwaterson How has our world degenerated to such a state where these profoundly ignorant people are the ones in charge? I feel responsible somehow.
864884730717757444 2017-05-17 16:46:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @cmclymer Wahh waah waah. Poor little snowflake trump.
864883392294391808 2017-05-17 16:40:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Fava There's @VoteRiders that i know of. I'm sure there are others.
864823257161244674 2017-05-17 12:41:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MalcolmNance @ezlusztig I have a friend who's a Florida voter & daughter of an ex - con. I'll send this on to her.
864779883133759488 2017-05-17 09:49:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IanDunt @Mal_A_ Get the @BBC to stand up and challenge her?
864779733946572800 2017-05-17 09:48:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IanDunt And clearly and easily proven untrue. Or as trump would say, fake news (of the highest order)!
864778860042342400 2017-05-17 09:45:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jamesrbuk I seem to recall the big story on the eve of the vote being that the  was recovering because it looked like remain would win.
864778461709258754 2017-05-17 09:43:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDems @SarahLudford Sorry should have clarified that the key difference is that Farron does not claim his faith makes him superior but May does.
864777922208559104 2017-05-17 09:41:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDems @SarahLudford @CY25_Skipper @Amandajeyanam Quite disingenuous for them to do so especially since May AFAIK is the only one who's claimed that her religion guides her policy.
864777581287100416 2017-05-17 09:40:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDems @SarahLudford @CY25_Skipper Of course. I'm defending Tim here.
864771046418894848 2017-05-17 09:14:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MalcolmNance @ezlusztig Yes. Yes, we do, and it effectively perpetuates slavery.
864770026146074624 2017-05-17 09:10:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @20committee @pramsey342 There's conservatives and conservatives. Those for whom it's just being against a caricature of liberals are behaving like sports fans.
864769260438073344 2017-05-17 09:07:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDems @SarahLudford @CY25_Skipper Key difference is that they don't loudly proclaim their faith & use it to claim a status of righteousness.
864768798397804544 2017-05-17 09:05:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDems @SarahLudford @CY25_Skipper Some of the most staunch advocates of civil liberties and anti-poverty advocates I know are also the most devout Christians I've ever met.

864485697956315137 2017-05-16 14:20:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MalcolmNance @PauletteHamil11 The christianist dominionist wing wants to use trump to bring about a theocracy and start their grand war with "Islam".
864390580088000512 2017-05-16 08:02:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DawnButlerBrent @OnnMel @SueNgwala Deluded? Or eluded the truth?

864141280288415744 2017-05-15 15:31:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Gus_802 Especially reality TV. Why do people enjoy watching strangers argue on TV? I can't think of many things that are more boring.
864139923670147072 2017-05-15 15:26:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDems @chrisshipitv I routinely brought my own cup when I lived in the US & was a bit surprised that it wasn't already a thing here when I moved in 2004.
864121757778808832 2017-05-15 14:14:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Gus_802 I'm with you on that. I do watch some things but even as a kid I'd only watch a few things then go listen to music. TV is too frenetic.

864052078997630976 2017-05-15 09:37:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @POTUS @GOP No. Next question?
864043216991129601 2017-05-15 09:02:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TheOnlySteffan It would help if largely Republican state politicians weren't deliberately closing polling stations in Dem-leaning areas as well.

863734326843899906 2017-05-14 12:34:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @C_Stroop @sarahposner @Klezmerstyle Yet they are very quick to condemn non-whites as being unredeemably immoral.
863733949222309889 2017-05-14 12:33:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @C_Stroop @sarahposner @Klezmerstyle I'm thinking about some acquaintances. They might mention God often but don't go to church & use "forgiveness" as excuse for bad behavior.
863730954786963456 2017-05-14 12:21:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sarahposner @Klezmerstyle I think it's this right here. How many of his most vocal supporters actually perform any sort of christian worship at all?

863719169946259456 2017-05-14 11:34:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EliasMichalas Hence why the very rich people funding brexit wanted it in the first place.

861391998149853184 2017-05-07 01:27:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Freeyourmindkid @cat_bo_rey67 I adopted the same practice (and never capitalise it) for the same reason. Pres Obama has my full respect; this clown 45 does not.
861390609898250240 2017-05-07 01:21:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Freeyourmindkid Demons is a new insult though. Seems rather LOTR or something.

861375419366473728 2017-05-07 00:21:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jonlovett Well we had Obama for 8 years.
861374792313831424 2017-05-07 00:18:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nickreeves9876 She has gone full trump. I expect her to start barking about fake news any day now.

861364128455303168 2017-05-07 23:36:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NicholasVinocur @POLITICOEurope @tunkuv Huh. Maybe not being a nasty racist nationalist would be a start.
861361000032894976 2017-05-07 23:24:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AggregateIQ @carolecadwalla Interesting that he is (was?) a Lib Dem. Is he still? Presumably was part of Liberal Leave if so.
861359610904686595 2017-05-07 23:18:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @cliodiaspora They could hardly look more biased. How do we campaign to stop their influence? They have poisoned the UK long enough.
861358468959264768 2017-05-07 23:13:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @washingtonpost @f37nutcracker Yes. Look up previous episodes of @maddow, she explains it well

861349857205911552 2017-05-07 22:39:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BorisJohnson @EmmanuelMacron @faisalislam Absolutely spot on. And with trump the alignment with the US will assuredly be servitude. Not the sovereignty people thought they'd lost.

861211173559164928 2017-05-07 13:28:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Made a horrendous mess with 2 kids and didn't tip. It was my first wait shift so I asked why. They said I wasn't cheerful enough.https://twitter.com/BailieAmellia/status/860546481182429186

861209757566341120 2017-05-07 13:23:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> The only ones who say that are those who demand obedience that they have no right to claim.
861208571647754240 2017-05-07 13:18:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @politico @beckoh Nah. He'd drop her like a hot potato.
861208325312172032 2017-05-07 13:17:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @politico @lita_margarita Bingo. This is all about hatred and revenge against perceived enemies.
861205257564684288 2017-05-07 13:05:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @politico How will this play with people in communities devastated by opioid addiction? You know, a substantial part of his base?
861204051580653571 2017-05-07 13:00:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Amy_Siskind @bjorn_igar Exactly. trump's promises assume that these hard working and perfectly intelligent people can't change industries. It's an insult.
861203282416607233 2017-05-07 12:57:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RVAwonk @Arriadna @Castantine Our whole government does. I read somewhere that some departments are still using 5 1/4" floppies. The hell?
861202665346400257 2017-05-07 12:54:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @wikileaks @fawfulfan @ezlusztig Good. I've never trusted wiki leaks.
861178959454777344 2017-05-07 11:20:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Exactly. Our so-called leadership has been acting like spoiled brats and trying to blame the adults who are telling them the rules.https://twitter.com/cierzo1/status/860951280801513485
861176057591980032 2017-05-07 11:09:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Yes. I'd chip in. Also someone needs to sue the state over this I think. I cannot believe the situation in Flint is still happening.https://twitter.com/dagnytaggart76/status/860957556843438080

861172748042866688 2017-05-07 10:55:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BuzzFeedUK Yes. It's what is needed and I'd be happy to pay it. #SaveOurNHS

860944284882784257 2017-05-06 19:48:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @C_Stroop @Barkforlove1 I guess they spend all their time trying to dismantle rational secular society so it makes sense to them.

860939594132590592 2017-05-06 19:29:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Amy_Siskind @bjorn_igar I think it's actually quite insulting to coal & gas workers to suggest they can't learn new skills & get jobs in green tech.

860924456180568065 2017-05-06 18:29:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MattWhittakerRF I think it would cost me about 2 a week extra. I'm perfectly fine with that.

860908776035151873 2017-05-06 17:27:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Amy_Siskind @bjorn_igar They could have invested in green tech and simply switched over. Now we're all suffering from their short sightedness.

858406357434806274 2017-04-29 19:43:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IndivisibleTeam @flippable_org @ArrasmithSarah You could also call to thank them!
858406185355141121 2017-04-29 19:42:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @flippable_org Yes. I only call people who represent me. But I have to remind them that we don't always have local numbers (ahem, @SenCoryGardner).
858405650279403520 2017-04-29 19:40:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUflagmafia Ooh, the pop up could be a good idea. Next to the Downing Street vigil.

858366427232907265 2017-04-29 17:04:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MassAGO @democracynow We abdicated that responsibility when we elected trump. We no longer have any moral authority.
858365972427792384 2017-04-29 17:02:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @UKIP @LeaveEUOfficial @Far_Right_Watch @abicyclista @HackneyWolves I used to like them because they keep many historic buildings in use, but I don't go there anymore.
858365405538263040 2017-04-29 17:00:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Far_Right_Watch Duh. I'm glad I haven't set foot in one of his pubs since he came out to support leave.
858348572575707136 2017-04-29 15:53:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> My brother-in-law, who is very introverted & never one to make a fuss, not only joined @LibDems but is out campaigning today.
858346134418456576 2017-04-29 15:44:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mattyglesias @ClippednPinned That only counts when Democrats do it.
858345351450963970 2017-04-29 15:40:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TuckerCarlson @foxnation Perhaps not a pawn but there sure is something fishy. We will not let go of this issue.

858324026246270977 2017-04-29 14:16:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @davidfrum Highly unlikely. Both what he said, and our ability to prove it.
858315511695888385 2017-04-29 13:42:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> This actually bad, I think. He will go to more extreme lengths to get the attention he craves.https://twitter.com/wpjenna/status/858308631120556032

858081171942584320 2017-04-28 22:11:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @leahmcelrath @Eric_Clarkson Loads of marketing potential and profits to be made!
858080378816540673 2017-04-28 22:07:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RightWingWatch @NikkiDreams I think they are just deeply unhappy and damaged. Or sadistic.
858079797179801600 2017-04-28 22:05:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TeenVogue @haskins2 Yeah me too. I have quit planning for retirement since I expect to die in the next 5 years.
858079597186953216 2017-04-28 22:04:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TeenVogue Didn't he register as a candidate on inauguration day?
858079140154658816 2017-04-28 22:03:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @kosmopolit @UK_Must_Remain Uh, isn't that what we have? Or is that the joke?
858078725312851973 2017-04-28 22:01:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NE4EU @brow_la Oh well it's a bit silly to be nervous. Most people are lovely. I've just let the horrible rhetoric get into my head.
858066406235152385 2017-04-28 21:12:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TeaPainUSA @justinjm1 Please please please. He does not belong there.

857980124720975874 2017-04-28 15:29:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nickreeves9876 @apharrington123 She was only supporting remain because Cameron was & polls suggested it would win.
857978695742615553 2017-04-28 15:23:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NE4EU @brow_la Is it wrong to feel nervous about doing so because I'm technically an immigrant? I was very nervous calling for the council election!
857977443231125504 2017-04-28 15:18:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @masg66 @rochshelly @BDHerren @mikefarb1 Rather it suggests that corrupt people were already in place even before the election.
857976196503662594 2017-04-28 15:14:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BrexitBin Well in theory our parliament already voted on it. The fact that it was a total sham is not the EU s problem.
857907389282037761 2017-04-28 10:40:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @FiveThirtyEight I believe it. I'm still in it.
857893066757287937 2017-04-28 09:43:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BrexitBin @acgrayling Or at the very least acknowledge that nearly half of voters chose remain & we would like genuine parliamentary involvement in negotiations.
857890843914620928 2017-04-28 09:34:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MayorofLondon Excellent! While the idea is kind of cool there were far too many problems with the reality.
857885430125035520 2017-04-28 09:13:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @aghastjan The worst of the worst are the ones who own the prison, no doubt. Private prison should really not be a thing, imho.
857885070962634752 2017-04-28 09:11:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @chrisgreybrexit @PeteNorth303 Thanks, I will read & digest. Usually I just get abuse or silence when I ask.
857884539485663236 2017-04-28 09:09:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NE4EU @brow_la But I'm very sympathetic. I know that life is not that easy up north. Even with education & experience I could not find work.
857883446953340928 2017-04-28 09:05:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NE4EU @brow_la I also argued w/a shop keeper in Gateshead some years ago about how immigrants do not in fact get "citizenship handed out like candy".
857883163275735040 2017-04-28 09:04:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NE4EU @brow_la I was not surprised tbh. I know those views exist. For ex. someone in my neighbourhood keeps white supremacist stickers up in the metro. 
857864247199641600 2017-04-28 07:49:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ThatTimWalker @AlisonKMurray @JoRichardsKent Sorry. Mine is safe Labour but he's a bit useless on this kind of thing.
857862533276852225 2017-04-28 07:42:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NE4EU @alexhardy1987 I really do think I should be exploring options to move elsewhere. It is very ominous.
857861842391244801 2017-04-28 07:39:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @chrisgreybrexit This is why I'm not simply accepting the result. The gov't has been actively pursuing the most harmful course, it seems.
857861251858399234 2017-04-28 07:37:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @chrisgreybrexit @PeteNorth303 Honestly I'd love to read a sensible and realistic case for brexit. I have yet to hear anything "intelligible". Got any links?
857859623470194688 2017-04-28 07:30:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NE4EU @brow_la Mostly receptive? Sad to say it's the only place I've received abuse from the public. 
857859198360702976 2017-04-28 07:29:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JasonKander Says a lot about him, and his supporters, that they thought being PRESIDENT would be easier than being a reality TV star. *facepalm*
857858667877683201 2017-04-28 07:26:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ThatTimWalker @AlisonKMurray @JoRichardsKent I hope they lose their seat, then!
857858544531632128 2017-04-28 07:26:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ThatTimWalker @AlisonKMurray @JoRichardsKent Wow. I didn't realise this. People need to know this is going on. I'll help with research if I can but I don't know much about it.
857715336497565696 2017-04-27 21:57:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SarahLudford @WomaninHavana Sadly I wasn't sure if this referred to US or UK at first.
857714864629919744 2017-04-27 21:55:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Oh dear, looks like May's audience was fake. #WeakAndWobblyhttps://twitter.com/Rikki_Sixx/status/857654947344785408

857703613677924352 2017-04-27 21:10:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LouiseMensch @TrueFactsStated @SethAbramson @tkwhalen Naturalised US citizen & lives in the US though, I think. Not that it's necessarily relevant.
857702693418172416 2017-04-27 21:07:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Scientists4EU Yes, it seems wrong to use Prince Philip as a bargaining chip after all this time.
857701876824985600 2017-04-27 21:03:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Is it wrong that one of the reasons I like @timfarron is he's northern?
857694145439248384 2017-04-27 20:33:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JerryBrownGov @mikefarb1 @ACDC_fanatic Is it possible to crowdfund new voting machines in every state that needs them? I'd pitch in 20 bucks for that.
857673440878362624 2017-04-27 19:10:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @susanemoney @tommyxtopher Utterly absurd. Obama fired him, trump is the moron who hired him back on.
857648970889297920 2017-04-27 17:33:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @naretevduorp @SenWarren I like you but this attack on Obama is profoundly unfair.

857641723010351104 2017-04-27 17:04:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Rosie @OnlySophiePlz You win!
857641243135881218 2017-04-27 17:03:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DustinGiebel For someone whose party controls all three branches of government he sure does complain about the minority party a lot.
857640897785327616 2017-04-27 17:01:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RightWingWatch Oh for heaven's sake. Why are these people so obsessed with other people's sex lives? It's perverse.

857609429088428033 2017-04-27 14:56:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AlexNBCNews @sjb127 True.
857609238012678145 2017-04-27 14:55:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AlexNBCNews Because it leads straight to the white house. Like they say, if you've got nothing to hide you shouldn't be worried. Otherwise...

857583904919891968 2017-04-27 13:15:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nytimes @f2photo All in the name of ratings. trump sees this as a giant reality TV show.
857583514782511104 2017-04-27 13:13:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nytimes @lifeinthemix Maybe we should turn sanctions on their head and start secretly flooding the place with US goods. Could lessen his power as source of income
857582829680635904 2017-04-27 13:10:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nytimes Well then please stop being so damn alarmist.

857573881183391744 2017-04-27 12:35:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Scientists4EU Well if you married an immigrant you're a traitor or a saboteur or enemy of the people or whatever, so you don't count. Right?

857199949855039488 2017-04-26 11:49:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @broadly Please don't call it a "movement". A trend, perhaps, but this is an assault and violation of trust, not a new fad.
857199403752460288 2017-04-26 11:47:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AaronBastani @ezziewilf Absolutely. Clearly she misspoke but what a Freudian slip!
857197998438313985 2017-04-26 11:41:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> The sad thing is that even if we #stopbrexit the clueless #Tories have done immense damage to our international standing and reputation.
857197611752796160 2017-04-26 11:40:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @fordm Was it not literally written by a breitbart columnist, or did Miller never work for them?
857197085275430912 2017-04-26 11:38:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @guardian @lsh88uk Yes, in the same way that flushing the toilet brings all the turds and the toilet paper together and dumps it in the sewer.
857196753220755457 2017-04-26 11:36:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @guardian So, is he Merlin or something? Because he seems to be viewing this backwards.
857174722483802112 2017-04-26 10:09:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDems @SarahLudford @SW11simon Though in fairness their 2015 interview of him was pretty good & talked about other topics as well.
857174356857958400 2017-04-26 10:07:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> I just donated to @LibDems General Election fighting fund - join me and help elect more LibDems http://libdems.nationbuilder.com/donate #LibDemFightback
857156314899914753 2017-04-26 08:56:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @FiveThirtyEight @hawkdoc429 IIRC it has been a best seller for months. Can't recall where I read that.
857155895633039360 2017-04-26 08:54:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HansardSociety @JasminDHarper I find this peculiar. Election fatigue? But also suggests turnout might be low in the election, perhaps.
857018782467985408 2017-04-25 23:49:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @C_Stroop So, when are you running for Congress? Your expertise will be useful...
857018036393582593 2017-04-25 23:46:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nycsouthpaw @mattyglesias @TweetingFolly Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with white women? I am not happy to be a member of this demographic.
857016893105897478 2017-04-25 23:42:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @badgirl_loony @MizQue Oh I know. I just wanted to be explicit that his fail is our win.
857011563806511104 2017-04-25 23:20:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BBCNews Yes. Pretty much.
857011150017486848 2017-04-25 23:19:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BBCNews And here I thought #MendaciousMay promised more funding for mental health? Or was that #CowardlyCameron?
857010351979757569 2017-04-25 23:16:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RMFifthCircuit I'm no lawyer but that seems batshit crazy. By that logic none of the orders carry any force, if I read it right.
857009744267104258 2017-04-25 23:13:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nycsouthpaw You could also stop hanging on every word he tweets.
857007787066494978 2017-04-25 23:05:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @badgirl_loony @MizQue No. I want him to keep failing because his plans are awful in the true sense of the word.
857007150434070534 2017-04-25 23:03:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @theipaper Oh, there's an age gap? News to me. Who actually cares?
856992256225628160 2017-04-25 22:04:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SovietSergey @frannie1225 I think there are plans being made for Memorial day?
856972620604076037 2017-04-25 20:46:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PressSec @TeaPainUSA Of course. Everything is, remember?
856944496654917634 2017-04-25 18:54:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @davidfrum @jenna92821 
856940209656799232 2017-04-25 18:37:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TVietor08 @codykeenan Fuck that guy. Gives those of us who actually earned our PhDs properly a bad name.
856939861202350080 2017-04-25 18:35:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TVietor08 I'm sure they know all about it.
856886673271029761 2017-04-25 15:04:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @davidfrum I'd much rather have a cheese fight with Canada than a nuclear war with North Korea.
856886157451427841 2017-04-25 15:02:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TB_Times @sox_morgan @laura_cereta Excellent news!
856862682049388545 2017-04-25 13:29:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Edwina_Currie @ShafikFM How can I walk when there are cars?
856861913640312833 2017-04-25 13:26:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Edwina_Currie Um, because they are not the same children, and obesity isn't solely caused by overeating. Next question?
856833121966313472 2017-04-25 11:31:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Newsflash to @GOP: your man has been in charge since January. Anything that happened at the White House since then is on you.https://twitter.com/JSavoly/status/856831051448164354
856822585149018113 2017-04-25 10:49:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EdwardTHardy He's just exposed the truth again.
856821615061069825 2017-04-25 10:46:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @McFaul The propaganda is working. Bigly. They think it's all invented by Obama operatives still trying to establish a caliphate in the US.
856819032057679873 2017-04-25 10:35:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LadyLiberty411 Maybe if he spent his weekends learning instead of golfing...
856818774284140546 2017-04-25 10:34:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IanDunt @paul_astell I might have stuck with them if Starmer were leader. I don't know much about him but he comes across as much more competent, at least.
856763962502860800 2017-04-24 06:57:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @shhhhhhheila @OccupyDemocrats Frankly I'm glad he's failing.
856636854141059072 2017-04-24 22:31:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Nigel_Farage @carolecadwalla @LouiseMensch @kelly2277 Gods how I loathe fartage.
856635270460039171 2017-04-24 22:25:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @thehill @TrishAnderson32 A sturgeon is a fish, so not sure how relevant that is either
856619015028043776 2017-04-24 21:21:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JSavoly This whole family is deeply insecure. I'd pity them if they weren't going to rob us all blind and kill us in a pointless nuclear war.
856607659558088704 2017-04-24 20:35:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Peter__Leonard @Shout2YouRadio Then get the government to enforce employment law properly. The workers themselves aren't responsible, it's the companies employing them.
856606900225441792 2017-04-24 20:32:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Peter__Leonard In any case I fail to see any why a member of an EU country standing with a EU flag behind them would be surprising.
856606497538801665 2017-04-24 20:31:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @UKIP @EdwardTHardy Only if they're white, probably.
856605627744997376 2017-04-24 20:27:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @davidfrum @EricKleefeld Related to "traditionalist worker's party"?
856596222043410433 2017-04-24 19:50:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CNNPolitics @remnant_bride Only because religious extremists are trying to bring it about through their irresponsible actions. Human engineered.
856562997824815105 2017-04-24 17:38:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TPM @kushkandy95 So he's basically saying he's the biggest disaster to hit us since then. Sounds right to me.
856562055570231296 2017-04-24 17:34:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sarahkendzior It doesn't take that much time to say "president fuckwit" though.
856561659611164672 2017-04-24 17:33:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BrennanCenter Please oh please stop this. Any party who does it is wrong.
856559817938358273 2017-04-24 17:25:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ChuckWendig @erhershman Seriously. No pet frog, no family or friend, no favourite teacher, no living being at all, just a fictional universe? Genuinely sad.
856558518652080128 2017-04-24 17:20:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ChuckWendig @runwithskizzers Same types who wish they were Death Eaters, I guess.
856557569699192832 2017-04-24 17:16:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mikefarb1 Oh please let this piece of trash and his nasty racist and classist plans go down. They are destroying the Midwest.
856555629435072512 2017-04-24 17:09:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mikefarb1 @24baseballReed That's putting it extremely mildly.
856541517397327872 2017-04-24 16:13:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @alexandraerin "Where the audio recording of the interview is unclear, ellipses or a notation that the recording was unintelligible are used."
856540977053433856 2017-04-24 16:10:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @alexandraerin Isn't that a notation that means the transcriber couldn't understand what was said?
856539881081851904 2017-04-24 16:06:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @guardian Oh, really? *runs to Morrison's* (asparagus is my favourite and all my plants died last year).
856504719799406594 2017-04-24 13:46:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CNNPolitics @WhiteHouse @VoteRiders @ElizLanders Maybe someone told him that the only voter fraud of any consequence is committed by the Republican Party?
856501986321158145 2017-04-24 13:36:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Hopey_70 @BegiiiGiles @Ireland0828 @rick00979 @docrocktex26 @pannlewis44 *hang my head, not bag, FFS.
856501866661851136 2017-04-24 13:35:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Hopey_70 @BegiiiGiles @Ireland0828 @rick00979 @docrocktex26 @pannlewis44 Amen, hell yes, etc. Now off to hang my bag in despair and shame because I'm part of it, too.
856500490678534144 2017-04-24 13:30:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibDems @timfarron @Tweetthemnice Start here? http://www.libdems.org.uk/issues
856499283763363840 2017-04-24 13:25:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NBCFirstRead @MSNBC Not surprising considering he lost the popular vote by 3 million & there is evidence of substantial voter suppression.
856470073527201792 2017-04-24 11:29:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LadyLiberty411 Maybe people wouldn't be so eager to have people executed if they could see the grisly reality.
856469864894038016 2017-04-24 11:28:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LadyLiberty411 I see his point as being that we hide this stuff away and make it clinical rather than being open about the brutal killing it really is.
856435835163553792 2017-04-24 09:13:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TrueFactsStated @TurtlesgaloreMR Deliberately understaffed?
856435263773519872 2017-04-24 09:10:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TrueFactsStated @janesnage @unixgrl12 So basically all of them? Don't forget how much of that money has gone into local gov't races, even for school boards etc.
856434096402300929 2017-04-24 09:06:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MSmithsonPB @brianhprobert They want a socialist paradise where the state can take over industry. At least that's how one lexit voter explained it to me.
856433710647959552 2017-04-24 09:04:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MSmithsonPB @udo_blick Er, you're asking that of UKIP voters? But snark aside it's probably those who are genuinely anti-establishment.
856432923691687937 2017-04-24 09:01:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MSmithsonPB @LaszkaOnExile True. Ultimately that's why I abandoned him. I'm very socially liberal but I'm not a socialist, and that seems to be his direction.
856432295191990272 2017-04-24 08:59:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MSmithsonPB @yankeeperson2 Yes, and almost as many who voted disagreed. We still have a voice and the right to fight for our views. It's called democracy!
856430757568491521 2017-04-24 08:52:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ddale8 @MelissaJPeltier I guess If you define it narrowly enough (eg radicalised Muslims flying planes) then that could be true, if incredibly ignorant and insane.
856423672793399301 2017-04-24 08:24:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ddale8 @Anumbr1 @56blackcat This goes for his base, too. I don't mean that to be mean but ppl I know who voted for him are profoundly ignorant. By choice.
856422626323030016 2017-04-24 08:20:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @stuartmillar159 @ddale8 @teroterotero It seems that very few people do.
856421671468761088 2017-04-24 08:16:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ddale8 @markbland Because it is hugely advantageous to them. The insanity and chaos makes it easier to do horrible things unnoticed.
856421230064390144 2017-04-24 08:15:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ddale8 Do you want a Coke or anything?
856317648375828480 2017-04-23 01:23:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @C_Stroop @Blues_Annie You know, reading all these tweets gives me the impression that evangelicals get laid a lot more than me. They sure do think about sex more.
856191818979037189 2017-04-23 17:03:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @oigmig @TeaPainUSA @gmachrisc Yes. I suggest @PreetBharara .
856191228274233344 2017-04-23 17:01:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TeaPainUSA Wow. This gives me more hope than I've had in weeks.
856190982139899904 2017-04-23 17:00:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @leahmcelrath Seriously. Her campaign made mistakes but she's certainly not weak.
856190082751090688 2017-04-23 16:56:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @supermathskid @KirstyStricklan Oh hell yeah. Especially white men wearing any kind of nationalist symbols.
856166717566963713 2017-04-23 15:23:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @politico Except the ones you cruelly rounded up and deported.
856166218579030017 2017-04-23 15:21:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JolyonMaugham @AlcuinsLibrary It often seems that people forget this. We really only have a voice in local races so that's what we should focus on when choosing.
856164431964798976 2017-04-23 15:14:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JasnaBadzak @LouiseMensch @AgsBee I prefer an incinerator. Much better at killing weed seeds.
856164254306754560 2017-04-23 15:13:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JasnaBadzak @LouiseMensch Wow, I didn't see this before. He is such skum.
856162843636498433 2017-04-23 15:08:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RVAwonk @OscartheOrange Or radically improve high school, and drastically increase oversight of home schooling.
856148598182039552 2017-04-23 14:11:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @C_Stroop @sturgidson Ah but he's a Republican so he's entitled.
856111767222706178 2017-04-23 11:45:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @hrtbps There is a house near painted in the St George cross and covered in flags. Suspect that's source of BNP & NF stickers in the neighborhood.
856110665622327296 2017-04-23 11:41:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @P_J_Willett @ryanmlanham @JeffCarnage @Tringonometry @BigDonJohn @elosty @Mani2thaJ @scully1888 @JT_Scholar @TheAuracl3 @MsAlliance Yes. I'm a naturalised citizen so I said I was British, so naturally they heard my accent and gave me a comfy chair. In jail.
856107752267055104 2017-04-23 11:29:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PolitPlato @olgajanekelly That will be great to have a break from my zero hours contract and endless job hunting.
856105914188922881 2017-04-23 11:22:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SariRautiainen Wow, if I'd known that I might have gone to Finland instead of the UK to study! Amazing.
856105607291707392 2017-04-23 11:20:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @margarance @msjanebond007 After some of the behaviour seen in Stoke in not so sure. http://m.stokesentinel.co.uk/video-ukip-member-caught-on-cctv-urinating-and-trying-to-push-way-into-oap-s-home-in-stoke-central/story-30147297-detail/story.html
856102484875640832 2017-04-23 11:08:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @margarance @msjanebond007 Ah but she's clearly an excellent speaker. You can tell by how well she writes.
856102062161055744 2017-04-23 11:06:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @stephenemoss @FolktalesEU Brexit has the potential to destroy my in-laws' retirement and my BIL's career aspirations, too.
856101687257387010 2017-04-23 11:05:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> This group will train people as experts in how math can counter gerrymandering. There's a course too! @Greg_Palasthttp://www.chronicle.com/article/Meet-the-Math-Professor/239260/
856077879700049920 2017-04-23 09:30:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @FolktalesEU @stephenemoss I'm a naturalised Brit and now I definitely feel uncomfortable here. I think about moving elsewhere all the time.
856077469945868288 2017-04-23 09:29:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @FolktalesEU @stephenemoss It's sickening. Many ppl I know are in similar situations. Tories are showing just how nasty & xenophobic they truly are.
856073788714352640 2017-04-23 09:14:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SarahLudford 1 we don't know for sure if it can be revoked, & 2 many remainers accept the result. LDs may lose more than gain if they promise to revoke.
856072689773137920 2017-04-23 09:10:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SarahLudford I keep having this argument. I'm no politician but it seems that Lib Dems cannot realistically promise to revoke A50 for 2 reasons:
856071802598117376 2017-04-23 09:06:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TheLastLeg @UKLEGUP @HanniParri Ah, I figured as much!
856071328578887680 2017-04-23 09:04:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JolyonMaugham Does anyone ever talk to each other or think these things through at Tory hq? I've lost count of the sudden reversals. Stability indeed.
856067134933413889 2017-04-23 08:48:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean How do you propose they stop brexit without more MPs? Your criticisms mystify me.
856064712399872000 2017-04-23 08:38:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @The48plus Ah I see! Sorry, I've just been dealing with a lot of Lib Dem sniping from ppl who are allegedly remainers and it's getting irritating.
856064336195878913 2017-04-23 08:36:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SkyNews @JWarwickSmith And arguably people are in a better place now with tuition, as the system the Lib Dems were able to get works like grad tax in effect.
856061462040768512 2017-04-23 08:25:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean As I've said many times they clearly want to stop brexit if possible. You are being deliberately obtuse.
856060902340165632 2017-04-23 08:23:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @The48plus I saw a tweet from your account raising this again just a second ago but it seems to be gone now.
856060013676253184 2017-04-23 08:19:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @The48plus Then why do you, and other remain supporters, keep repeating lies about this? His voting record shows that he doesn't act homophobic.
856059258202451968 2017-04-23 08:16:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PalmerReport @KevinDarryl I wonder how many of those resigning are planning to leave the country?
856058316035850240 2017-04-23 08:13:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @williamlegate Why not? He specialises in crassness. It's a deliberate strategy to make people angry. He's the troll in chief.
856057105861812224 2017-04-23 08:08:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @donaldtrumpjr @realDonaldTrump @rolandscahill Who cares if he has a job? How much time and effort do you think it takes to compose a tweet?
856056871760916480 2017-04-23 08:07:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump Enhanced environmental protection? Please don't insult people who live in wastelands created by destructive mining and other processes.
856056501647101952 2017-04-23 08:05:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @politico These people and their petty loyalty crap are destroying the country. 
856055901874257920 2017-04-23 08:03:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean I agree that they obviously didn't necessarily want to leave either but no party can count on their vote.
856055646000697344 2017-04-23 08:02:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean I'm afraid I discount those who can't be bothered to vote. Some couldn't for legit reasons, but what evidence is there they are remainers?
856054839591260161 2017-04-23 07:59:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Wow. 8,000 new members in two days!https://twitter.com/libdemvoice/status/856053977712119809
856054434555727872 2017-04-23 07:57:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @ucla_007 @naretevduorp @carol_dacanay There's a few, but I don't think they are in Congress.
856054242259472385 2017-04-23 07:56:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @naretevduorp @StevenGOchoa It's all he knows how to do.
856054063800229888 2017-04-23 07:56:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Well he undoubtedly does! https://twitter.com/ScottAStern/status/855935185191407623
856053816264994816 2017-04-23 07:55:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @naretevduorp Let me guess, big changes will be "no taxes for the rich, esp. real estate devs, and all revenues go into the prez's pocket".
856053218719281153 2017-04-23 07:52:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean They might just barely get enough MPs to halt the damage but it is extremely unlikely that they will go from 9 MPs to a majority.
856052805194350592 2017-04-23 07:51:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean Oh give it a rest. The @LibDems are the best you're going to get since over half the country voted for suicide and the witch is in charge.
855952112899035137 2017-04-22 01:11:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @UKLEGUP @mick9692962 @markastrangward A tough situation. Do you have someone you trust who could act as an intermediary? Deliver a shopping list, pick up a meal, etc?
855951052780261377 2017-04-22 01:06:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TheLastLeg @UKLEGUP @HanniParri What date?
855942586099531776 2017-04-22 00:33:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jehorowitz I'd prefer that they ignored it, myself.
855940775456247808 2017-04-22 00:25:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @thenation @mikefarb1 @ryrysven Power, money, profound racism and misogyny, and a twisted extremist Christian belief system all factor in as well.
855930263561437184 2017-04-22 23:44:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @faisalislam @LizJarvisUK But reading other tweets I guess they have before. Frankly I wasn't paying attention in 2010 as I couldn't vote.
855929746873626624 2017-04-22 23:42:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @faisalislam @LizJarvisUK They always seem pretty lukewarm on them to me, or else fail to mention them entirely. That's changed only in the last couple of days.
855928858964525057 2017-04-22 23:38:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> No coalition. @timfarron has been very clear.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/22/lib-dems-no-coalition-tim-farron-general-election
855924591272787972 2017-04-22 23:21:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Just watching last week's @TheLastLeg I've suffered from panic attacks & depression & happy to chat to anyone who needs to talk #legup
855868000737558529 2017-04-22 19:36:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @NidaKhanNY And not a trace of irony.
855841941791092738 2017-04-22 17:53:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EGBridges A kid I babysat for introduced me. I was never really aware that they were Christian, just cheesy (albeit catchy).
855840843114192897 2017-04-22 17:48:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @C_Stroop Guess that explains why they can't understand that atheists and agnostics have morals independent of whether a deity will punish them.
855840217877684226 2017-04-22 17:46:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> It would be a mistake for the Lib Dems to campaign solely on staying in EU. We also want to stop the Tories.http://news.sky.com/story/election-2017-may-hopes-brexit-vaccine-will-hold-off-lib-dems-in-south-west-10844996
855823711508848640 2017-04-22 16:40:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mikefarb1 Ugh. We seem to have pretty poor cyber security.
855820614673858561 2017-04-22 16:28:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean They abstained for their own reasons rather than give their support to the Tories, unlike Labour.
855819598154924035 2017-04-22 16:24:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean That is false. Two abstained, the rest voted against.
855817554534772736 2017-04-22 16:16:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean Various ministers say it can but the law is not clear, and it has not yet been settled in the courts.
855817351689797632 2017-04-22 16:15:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean Quite honestly, what can they do? It would be foolish to promise to overturn the ref since nobody knows if A50 can be revoked.
855816335573626882 2017-04-22 16:11:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean Very first line: "Britains best chance to succeed is within the EU"
855815997953069060 2017-04-22 16:10:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean And frankly they would be open to charges of denying democracy of they campaign on overturning the referendum, which would lose votes.
855815768314966017 2017-04-22 16:09:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean "Stop hard brexit" is the responsible message. They are unlikely to be the majority party so they have to be realistic.
855815381189054466 2017-04-22 16:07:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean It's not for them to decide though, is it? We don't even know for sure that article 50 can be revoked, so they have to stick to what's known
855814361146937346 2017-04-22 16:03:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean I joined the @LibDems precisely because they are the strongest pro-Europe party. The notion that they support Tory brexit is farcical.

855812873095979008 2017-04-22 15:57:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean On the contrary I'd like you to show me an instance of the party campaigning *for* brexit! Because their official message is clear.
855810374708416512 2017-04-22 15:47:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean How can you claim such a thing when @LibDems are the only party calling for a referendum on the exit deal with an option not to leave?
855801637004337152 2017-04-22 15:13:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DonaldJTrumpJr "Confirmed: US intelligence agencies cooperated with allies to investigate potential treason". #FTFY #Impeach45 #TrumpRussiaCollusion
855794047499329537 2017-04-22 14:42:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> I should have tagged that: #brexit #TrumpRussiaCollusion
855793782100512768 2017-04-22 14:41:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Pretty obvious that all these goals are being hotly pursued. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics
855793524582883329 2017-04-22 14:40:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Quite a sobering article. Also mentions "Foundations of Geopolitics". http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2016/11/playtime-is-over.html

855171664702828545 2017-04-20 21:29:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @OccupyDemocrats That's what the #SteeleDossier said this was all about. So they have basically confirmed that it's legit.

854794031775326209 2017-04-19 20:29:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BoobPunchTina Thing is, for me it's not about the election anymore. It's about the corruption and money laundering that's come out since then.
854787325330685953 2017-04-19 20:02:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @theipaper If you have exams or other plans, request a postal ballot and send it in early. It's what I do because I'm often out of town w/no notice.

854420832550092800 2017-04-18 19:46:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IanDunt @DavidSi01089718 I think so. If Tories lose any significant number of seats then they really can't claim to have a mandate.
854420227056164864 2017-04-18 19:43:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IanDunt Good. If it's dangerous for May and UKIP then I'm all for it.

854414694400106496 2017-04-18 19:21:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BBCNews @BBCRealityCheck @herbivore_club It's not just the referendum, though, it's trying to get a brexit that does not destroy our economy and international standing.
854381316888035329 2017-04-18 17:09:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BBCNews @BBCRealityCheck @herbivore_club I'll vote for anyone not Tory or UKIP generally, but Lib Dem has a shot to do well in many places.

844597257907437568 2017-03-22 17:10:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @opinionstwirl @naretevduorp I hope so but I also think that the Clintons are a terminally damaged brand, however unfairly.
844561933890174977 2017-03-22 14:50:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @subzerov690 @2ShoesG Indeed. Trump is a gift for them because he's such a good smoke screen for their mean spirited agenda.

837321382690189313 2017-03-02 15:19:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JuddLegum @kushkandy95 @thinkprogress See, I can understand that he might have had a perfectly innocent reason to talk to the ambassador 1
837310098687033346 2017-03-02 14:34:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TheViewFromLL2 a bit skeptical that any of this is real. Have a nagging sense it's a setup of some kind.
837309863491481602 2017-03-02 14:33:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TheViewFromLL2 It's weird. I could see Trumps inexperienced ppl not knowing but not these long term senators etc. Which is why I'm still 1

837293225396305920 2017-03-02 13:27:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jeffbercovici And what was up with the so-called Democrat saying that ppl who criticise trump are not Americans and shouldn't be here??
837292474880180226 2017-03-02 13:24:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jeffbercovici She was really struggling to articulate what she wanted to say. Lots of words with no substance.
837285748910895104 2017-03-02 12:57:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jeffbercovici Says a lot about his hardcore supporters.
837285502130745345 2017-03-02 12:56:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @spectator @IanDunt Seems very plausible. The notion that Farage & Banks aren't part of the establishment has always been laughable.

837208577987252224 2017-03-01 07:50:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nytimes @SpryGuy @DavidCornDC @JohnHSafranek Probably. One reason anyway, the other being that trump doesn't do his own thinking.
837207657962418176 2017-03-01 07:47:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nytimes @DavidCornDC @cathy_retired4 @amydean54 Yeah I don't think we have any mechanism for that, sadly.
837206514171535360 2017-03-01 07:42:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TheAtlantic @nytimes @DavidCornDC @juliannimal Or maybe they are protecting their sources from trump?
837206061484494848 2017-03-01 07:40:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nytimes @DavidCornDC @dgarrick5534 I think it's the worst administration we've ever had. Previous crooks weren't trying to destroy the US.

837203098787594240 2017-03-01 07:29:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DanMing In the same way that online reviews are: you're more apt to seek out a place to complain than you are to praise.
837202823389532160 2017-03-01 07:28:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DanMing Not necessarily but it's how I communicate with others about this. Perhaps the format is biased to certain responses.
837201848083890176 2017-03-01 07:24:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Anna_Soubry Why does @theresa_may hate us immigrants so much? I'm not EU but I was born elsewhere. Does that make me a subhuman?
837123629297053698 2017-03-01 02:13:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GladIsLovinNews @DanMing voter suppression is a huge factor. Bigger than lack of interest I think.

837121965014069248 2017-03-01 02:06:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GladIsLovinNews @DanMing They should probably address the accusations that the primaries were rigged, esp in NV. Personally I'm not 1

837120529865797633 2017-03-01 02:01:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AJStream @DanMing Probably partly the distorting effect of Facebook threads but many were very inflexible & quick to accuse of corruption

837115446180659200 2017-03-01 01:40:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AJStream I was also impressed with Jehmu Greene and Sally Boynton Brown DNC chair speeches
837114798429073409 2017-03-01 01:38:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AJStream Jason Kandar of Missouri has potential to go far. He has broad appeal, possibly to both parties.
837114168272629761 2017-03-01 01:35:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AJStream Infighting between the old guard and new Sanders-inspired members who don't understand the political necessity of coalition
837112952876589056 2017-03-01 01:30:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @thedailybeast @realDonaldTrump @HeerJeet @CherylRofer @LemonSlayerUS Mattis might do a better job anyway since he actually uses his head.
837109483948093441 2017-03-01 01:17:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Rob_Flaherty @Gus_802 Of course it was. But why did trump have to cheapen it with comments about applause?
837108999766048769 2017-03-01 01:15:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AJStream I'd like some kind of FDR style jobs program for infrastructure & green energy manufacturing facilities
837108369290891265 2017-03-01 01:12:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Gus_802 It's engaging. Yes we need to clean up the party & get better candidates but 2018 is an emergency.
837107675880095744 2017-03-01 01:09:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ConanOBrien @CNN Love the tote bag thing... Ha ha!
837106724842659840 2017-03-01 01:06:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @KatyTurNBC @SopanDeb I don't see where all the praise is coming from. So he practiced for once. And then joked that applause made death OK?
837060520247193601 2017-03-01 22:02:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Varidienne @ishaantharoor @AgeDemands I'll donate to it if she does.
837059700172664832 2017-03-01 21:59:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LOLGOP @ishaantharoor @BoenderCarol Starting to look like they're not very different.
837058978253242368 2017-03-01 21:56:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ishaantharoor I weep for my country and everyone who will be hurt by this bullshit.
836920788531957760 2017-03-01 12:47:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DMReporter @mralibi No. Very much doubt it on either count.
836920692666994688 2017-03-01 12:46:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DMReporter What's with the weird punctuation in the last one?
836920224377110528 2017-03-01 12:45:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ChiOnwurah One wonders if two men would have been rejected for the same reason.
836916807294406656 2017-03-01 12:31:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @POTUS @timjacobwise Maybe the press should start identifying all their sources as John Barron.
836888144247144448 2017-03-01 10:37:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> What say you, @LouiseMensch @Khanoisseur @sarahkendzior?http://www.politico.eu/article/what-if-donald-trump-played-the-kremlin-vladimir-putin/
836885253939687425 2017-03-01 10:26:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Law_and_Policy @willpetty78 Incompetence or malice?

836881414255742976 2017-03-01 10:10:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CNBC @bluelighttv @DCRobMan @PoliticsPeach Oddly small sums in the larger picture
836880235912126465 2017-03-01 10:06:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @bluelighttv @DCRobMan @BintibirdC @PoliticsPeach But I'm trying to do better at paying attention to others going forward.
836879995578515461 2017-03-01 10:05:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @bluelighttv @DCRobMan @BintibirdC @PoliticsPeach I'll admit that is true for me at least because I only really paid attn to my state.
836879473362546689 2017-03-01 10:03:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DCRobMan @joey_slugs @Susan_Crabtree I third it. Hopefully @justicedems or @BrandNew535 or someone in #DemEnter is working on it.
836879082210086913 2017-03-01 10:01:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DCRobMan @1KarinKeller @Mooncatadams @clayrocs @ssbn608 I think that's the point. This guy is so bad he makes even the worst look good.
836876279299379200 2017-03-01 09:50:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @benatipsosmori @LOS_Fisher @Timewalkproject If their student visa has expired then yes but if not then why would they be?
836875884162338818 2017-03-01 09:48:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @benatipsosmori @LOS_Fisher @Timewalkproject If the work is part of the course & they are enrolled I don't think they should be counted.
836875355646480384 2017-03-01 09:46:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LOS_Fisher Good. They should not be counted while they are still enrolled in courses.
836873633112985601 2017-03-01 09:39:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @YouTube @ezlusztig Harder to use his behaviour as an issue in 2018/20 if the furore dies down.
836873442360233985 2017-03-01 09:39:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @YouTube @ezlusztig Hmm, I thought he was saying that the resistance is in trouble if trump can manage to start sounding presidential.
836871903801458689 2017-03-01 09:33:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @kylegriffin1 @matstromberg @seekingeldorado @rezaraeesi @martavanegas Cheeze Whiz is a brilliant metaphor by the way
836871732808069120 2017-03-01 09:32:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @kylegriffin1 @matstromberg @seekingeldorado @rezaraeesi @martavanegas Indeed. I wish the media would stop their sensationalist coverage.
836871227625074688 2017-03-01 09:30:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @davidaxelrod @VanJones68 @BryceKepner @MikoCatalano So they will use our instinct for understanding to get us to drop our guard. 2
836870981620740099 2017-03-01 09:29:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @davidaxelrod @VanJones68 @BryceKepner @MikoCatalano More than that, though: we want to do the right thing & they want to destroy us. 1
836870550555344896 2017-03-01 09:27:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @politico @Trumpnado2016 @Uberficker It seems like a good way to distract the media. I have tried not to pay too much attention to it.
836869434455252995 2017-03-01 09:23:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidLammy @Penbrynhir @AdamCli Which is why I don't understand why there's been so little push back on it.
836868200147075072 2017-03-01 09:18:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> So losing a soldier in a disastrous raid is OK because he got a lot of applause. How incredibly disrespectful.pic.twitter.com/uOQqgirlGF
836741163885465601 2017-02-28 00:53:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> I'd rather gouge my eyes out with a rusty fork than watch it, so no big sacrifice here.https://twitter.com/funder/status/836706177060831233
836740688498798594 2017-02-28 00:51:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @gabriellahope_ @SopanDeb He didn't even try to make it seem like a relevant answer.
836740069260152832 2017-02-28 00:49:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @natalieben @MollyMEP I've heard it claimed that's why Banks was a supporter, no idea if that's true though.
836735683029004288 2017-02-28 00:31:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HouseGOP @LadyLiberty411 Of course mine did. He's been gunning for trump the whole time.
836734095472398336 2017-02-28 00:25:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Evan_McMullin @AlizaEarnshaw Don't forget the press, and American carnage.
836733545766846464 2017-02-28 00:23:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Evan_McMullin not holding my breath but yes we need it.
836707523411521536 2017-02-28 22:39:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GeorgeFoulkes Thank you for trying.
836705137724882944 2017-02-28 22:30:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MalcolmNance @lpolgreen @AceOfCrame If this is winning then I'd sure like it to stop.
836699197390925824 2017-02-28 22:06:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> This is so deeply sad.https://twitter.com/guardian/status/836698746574389248
836698396513558528 2017-02-28 22:03:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @digislr @mattyglesias @rbollinger73 everybody knows science is fake news. Why would they talk to them, right?
836698126132080644 2017-02-28 22:02:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mattyglesias @bljacka I hope so. It will be amusingly ironic if he gets taken down over this & not the blatant sedition & corruption.
836697299233484802 2017-02-28 21:59:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mattyglesias @williamsgoldman It's a perfect match!
836697197798387714 2017-02-28 21:58:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mattyglesias Sounds fab. I'm still really bitter about not getting those taco trucks.
836692570545745920 2017-02-28 21:40:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Trumpnado2016 @Uberficker @politico You know I'm starting to wonder whether the leaks are real. Seems too dramatic and deliberate somehow.
836692134526869504 2017-02-28 21:38:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @OccupyDemocrats I will admit that I didn't know either until I read this, but then I'm not secretary of education.
836691922429358082 2017-02-28 21:37:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @OccupyDemocrats I'll wager it's in part because she is so inept & unqualified that she didn't know about why these universities exist.
836687872770080769 2017-02-28 21:21:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @davidaxelrod @VanJones68 @BryceKepner @MikoCatalano Good to keep in mind I think.
836687798140817408 2017-02-28 21:21:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @davidaxelrod @VanJones68 @BryceKepner @MikoCatalano Someone tweeted right after the election "they will use your niceness against you".
836680278479360001 2017-02-28 20:51:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @munchies @VICE I can totally sympathise.
836672235783995392 2017-02-28 20:19:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidLammy @Penbrynhir @AdamCli With absolutely no acknowledgement that my concerns exist or are valid at all.
836672008343732225 2017-02-28 20:18:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidLammy @Penbrynhir @AdamCli It's less the result to me now and more this insistence on brutal, destructive, mean-spirited brexit.
836670026082107393 2017-02-28 20:10:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidLammy @DamienVFletcher @slinkyswimmer @TheButman But what about the will of us who voted remain? No nod to us or our fears?
836669648489889793 2017-02-28 20:09:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidLammy @DamienVFletcher @TheButman So how does giving the Tories everything on a plate work as strategy?
836669400723951618 2017-02-28 20:08:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidLammy @DamienVFletcher @TheButman And though I've joined the Lib Dems I have no illusions that they will be the next gov't.
836669160000204800 2017-02-28 20:07:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidLammy @DamienVFletcher @TheButman Because to me it seems my career is ruined, I'm nervous about letting people know I'm an immigrant
836668942869532672 2017-02-28 20:06:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidLammy @DamienVFletcher @TheButman OK quite honestly I cannot understand your optimism. Can you point me to any explanation of it?
836611260309467136 2017-02-28 16:17:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @kylegriffin1 @matstromberg @rezaraeesi A very large part of my brain thinks we'll all be dead or enslaved by Christmas. 
836610968947949569 2017-02-28 16:16:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GringoPeruano I'm not sure if it was via home office website or what where she got original info
836610799372238849 2017-02-28 16:15:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GringoPeruano A friend who is an immigration advisor is hopefully going to help them clarify the situation
836610536624254976 2017-02-28 16:14:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GringoPeruano Stay at home mom. She started looking into becoming a citizen & found out she was supposed to have had insurance all along
836608707739934721 2017-02-28 16:07:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TheObamanista @kylegriffin1 @WynterSoldier00 He filed as a candidate for 2020 as soon as he was inaugurated.
836608155220131840 2017-02-28 16:05:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @kylegriffin1 @rezaraeesi @matstromberg As far as I know he filed as a candidate on the day he was inaugurated.
836607806685990912 2017-02-28 16:03:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> What a farce. No dignity whatsoever.https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/836601734772502528
836606957922435072 2017-02-28 16:00:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GringoPeruano oh I meant the insurance thing. Friend's wife is Spanish SAHM & she just learned that she was supposed to have it.
836606487883563011 2017-02-28 15:58:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Yet another attack on legal residents by our vicious and xenophobic leader and the Tory government.http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/brexit-latest-eu-national-right-to-live-uk-theresa-may-panic-a7602191.html
836604632352849921 2017-02-28 15:51:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IanDunt I support those who are. Mine was a remainer but when I wrote to ask him to vote for amendments he was quite curt.
836604108190670849 2017-02-28 15:48:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GringoPeruano If they pay taxes why should they have to pay for insurance too?
836603928456343556 2017-02-28 15:48:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GringoPeruano Yes, I've been aware of this issue. I don't know any long term EU resident who knew about it before now.
836603034759282689 2017-02-28 15:44:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AdamBienkov Pot kettle black much?
836602647574687744 2017-02-28 15:43:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HeerJeet Exactly. She's being tacky but the disrespect is the real issue.

836531202458861568 2017-02-28 10:59:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Embarrassing is not the word I would use. It's an acknowledgement that trump & his team welcome these attacks.http://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article135323049.html

836324237262598144 2017-02-27 21:16:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Not sure how believable this is but the Tories are supposed be under investigation for voting irregularities in 2015https://skwawkbox.org/2017/02/26/exclusive-electoral-expert-copeland-by-election-unlawful-count-suspect/
836282796763144194 2017-02-27 18:32:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Even John Major is stepping up to say that #brexit won't be a cakewalk.
836281944602198016 2017-02-27 18:28:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @infowars @RealAlexJones @DonnaVishio I wish.
836276440362549250 2017-02-27 18:06:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NBCNews #dearmrpresident You are doing a pretty bad job of unifying us. I wake up every day wondering what new disaster you have caused.
836274781859229696 2017-02-27 18:00:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @shreec I really hope you are right.
836274422256398336 2017-02-27 17:58:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidCornDC And TRUTH, HONESTY, DEMOCRACY, and AMERICA.
836274139648372742 2017-02-27 17:57:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> How much more offensive to our armed forces can you get? I'm incensed that he would dismiss #veterans in this way.https://twitter.com/JasonKander/status/836257841870749699
836273081924653056 2017-02-27 17:53:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @thehill @javamom66 That would be a real public service.
836272932255055872 2017-02-27 17:52:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @thehill @badgirl_loony Yes we did.
836272718827880448 2017-02-27 17:52:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Popehat @ByronTau @sheridantbrown And apparently as thin skinned.
836271479251697669 2017-02-27 17:47:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @richardmorrisuk @meralhece I'd be OK with another Green MP.
836271117866250245 2017-02-27 17:45:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @IanDunt There are many labour MPs that I like but I am a remainer and I will never vote labour again while this turncoat is in charge.

836269815346102275 2017-02-27 17:40:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HillaryClinton @altNOAA @Lilith4Prez It was. She said she'd replace coal etc with green power jobs but media only quoted half of her remark
836269255553388544 2017-02-27 17:38:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @altNOAA @nk_knight1 Surely her plans could still be implemented? http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/may/10/context-hillary-clintons-comments-about-coal-jobs/
836269145008312322 2017-02-27 17:37:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @altNOAA @nk_knight1 Don't want to make this a Clinton rehash but she really did propose to replace coal with green jobs.
836268271733190656 2017-02-27 17:34:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @altNOAA @skhamik I don't want to derail this convo w/politics but wasn't that Clinton's plan? How did she intend to do it?
836267822154153984 2017-02-27 17:32:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Indeed. https://www.instagram.com/p/BRA4bw1j8FR/
836265332910276608 2017-02-27 17:22:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Nasty and callous. Anxiety is no joke. @TimetoChange you might have a good response?http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tory-minister-dismisses-37bn-disability-9920751

836196875841781761 2017-02-27 12:50:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GOP @politico @KPCCofframp @medic6423 Honestly I don't frikkin' care if he is anyway. I never did.
836196247149154304 2017-02-27 12:48:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @POLITICOMag @sbg1 @politico And this is another reason why getting cosy with trump is a bad move for May.
836195489464799232 2017-02-27 12:45:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @colincampbell No wonder his steak brand failed. Like everything else he was incompetent to judge a good product.
836189173610590208 2017-02-27 12:20:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DougieStew What on earth...? I have been on trains with crazy shit going on but never over bagels.
836187964623503360 2017-02-27 12:15:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BIUK_Finance @JolyonMaugham The UK would have to pay companies to stay in. Isn't that the plan? Isn't that what Nissan is getting?
836186195797377024 2017-02-27 12:08:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @theipaper There is a soft coup against the entire western world order being organised by Murdoch, Mercers, Kochs, etc.
836185719198613506 2017-02-27 12:06:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TelegraphNews @solange_lebourg I despise May more than I hate Trump.
836184538384580608 2017-02-27 12:01:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MaxineWaters because that's the whole reason for his campaign. To make them all ridiculously rich and remove all barriers.
836183056255967232 2017-02-27 11:55:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @politico @elitistcoast And that's the plan. It's a coup, people.

836022922175266816 2017-02-26 01:19:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @20committee @Khanoisseur @roxannelwright Honestly I think they were only big talking 4chan guys. Disappointing really.
836021515091070977 2017-02-26 01:13:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CloughOlive @jmargaleft I still can't figure out why, though. Is she really just that xenophobic?
836021165047091200 2017-02-26 01:12:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CloughOlive @LarsFJ1 I detest that woman.
836017291384979456 2017-02-26 00:57:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BrexitBin I've noticed it and I moved here from the US in 2004. A pity because I moved away from that stuff...
836014888581488640 2017-02-26 00:47:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TheStevenThomas I clicked to see why Clarke was trending and found this. What the heck.

835895261088083968 2017-02-26 16:52:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @toontilley @thefilmexciter She speaks for me as well. She can keep on talking.

835772724085731332 2017-02-26 08:45:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> OK so this is actually a big deal. #Mercer & Cambridge Analytica behind # brexit, probably millions of 'free' helphttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/us-billionaire-mercer-helped-back-brexit
835652038142877696 2017-02-25 00:45:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> EO to allow deportation of non-citizen active duty military (it's pretty common for non-citizens to sign up) http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/2/25/1637563/-Trump-Breaks-Faith-Executive-order-drops-protection-for-families-of-deployed-military
835651747959963652 2017-02-25 00:44:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> So apparently a new EO will allow the families of non-citizen active duty military to be deported. While they are protecting our country.
835625855250485250 2017-02-25 23:01:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Khanoisseur @PegsKatzencats Seriously. Why aren't these things big news?

835604124389486592 2017-02-25 21:35:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AndreaChalupa @Mimi577588 @Bbop_rocksteady I tend to agree. I'm trying not to be harsh but the bickering is really irritating me.
835601550768746499 2017-02-25 21:25:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @alexandraerin @That_Bitch_16 I don't totally understand why but it's something that Bernie people need to take into account.
835601271453323266 2017-02-25 21:24:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @alexandraerin @That_Bitch_16 I'm also wary of the fact that many black voters didn't like him, and they are the majority in the party.
835597705632235524 2017-02-25 21:09:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @chicagotribune @sox_morgan @couriernews Sounds like a great guy!
835588105616896000 2017-02-25 20:31:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @alexandraerin Well Perez won but made Ellison deputy chair. Good compromise, I hope.
835587881435529216 2017-02-25 20:30:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @alexandraerin @FriedlineMike Indeed. *sigh*
835587341402124289 2017-02-25 20:28:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CharlesTannock Good point.
835583758229200896 2017-02-25 20:14:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @alexandraerin And though I count myself as a progressive I was not totally convinced by Sanders. Great guy, not the saviour.
835583491949604865 2017-02-25 20:13:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @alexandraerin I might get kicked out of our revolution for saying so but I still think Hillary has a lot of awesome qualities.
835582897608409089 2017-02-25 20:11:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Amen to this. I fall on the progressive side but the #DNCChair is not the end of the story. Either major candidate will make changes.https://twitter.com/alexandraerin/status/835581956989595648

835567429816311808 2017-02-25 19:09:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SarahLerner @sox_morgan The chair doesn't control everything. We can't let it derail our progress if our favourite loses.
835566956375769088 2017-02-25 19:07:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SarahLerner @sox_morgan I'm loosely allied w/the #DemEnter folks but all the infighting and name calling is pissing me off.
835566294862811140 2017-02-25 19:05:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SarahLerner A future leader I think. Seems like he has potential.
835565250669907968 2017-02-25 19:00:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GreenwichInEU Cool, I'll try to turn up soon!
835563490169524225 2017-02-25 18:53:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BraddJaffy "this is not the propaganda we ordered"
835561903367815168 2017-02-25 18:47:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NormOrnstein I still think he's been set up. He'll be replaced with a Bannon crony.
835557959950270468 2017-02-25 18:31:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @joshtpm Not lazy, deliberately taking credit for other peoples' work.
835557511876988933 2017-02-25 18:30:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @George_Osborne Funny I wonder the same thing about the conservatives.
835519745780760577 2017-02-25 16:00:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @WhiteHouse @LadyLiberty411 A tiny and perhaps insignificant step but it's something.
835519554960916480 2017-02-25 15:59:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Hope more of these ppl step up.   What Its Like to Be a Ted Cruz Fan (and NeverTrumper) at CPAChttps://newrepublic.com/article/140890/we-hated-its-like-ted-cruz-fan-and-nevertrumper-cpac
835457302949998592 2017-02-25 11:51:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GreenwichInEU Oh I didn't know about this! Every week?
835456756352499712 2017-02-25 11:49:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @edwardlucas @LouiseMensch It always annoyed me that so many of my fellow libs see communist dictators as heroes. I've never been socialist.
835455785354346496 2017-02-25 11:45:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LouiseMensch @matthaig1 @Kel_MoonFace Me neither. They are so terrified of anything outside their comfort zone they need a protector.
835455296537526272 2017-02-25 11:43:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @matthaig1 @ecolitical And even if we melt you've still got a flood.
835454885994835968 2017-02-25 11:42:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidYankovich @chaandchoc Why else would they be working so hard to discredit and shut down normal press? They're afraid.
835453456836087808 2017-02-25 11:36:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JohnWDean @cairnstownie That's what private prison is all about.
835453169756950528 2017-02-25 11:35:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @voxdotcom @JohnWDean Of course they don't. They are openly white supremacists who are trying to return minorities to a subhuman status.
835450347493683200 2017-02-25 11:24:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @washingtonpost @JohnWDean I think this is a setup of Priebus. Bannon, Miller, and the rest of the evil crew want to drive out normal GOP.
835449358942408704 2017-02-25 11:20:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @meralhece Could you please remind our PM of that? She seems to be flirting with authoritarianism far too much.
835448852010401792 2017-02-25 11:18:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @theipaper Except that Muslims who are US and UK citizens and have never been to any of the 7 countries have been detained.
835447117112094721 2017-02-25 11:11:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Ame0baRepublic @aad100 Someone said "they will use your niceness against you". So we need to not be nice. They're only trying to provoke us
835446481645682688 2017-02-25 11:08:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Ame0baRepublic @aad100 So, yeah, I'm not going to bother trying to be understanding or nice to bullies. They can FRO as they say in the UK.
835446021450784768 2017-02-25 11:07:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Ame0baRepublic @aad100 I'm not going to seek ways to be antagonistic myself, but that's what these assholes have been doing for years.
835445546416492544 2017-02-25 11:05:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Ame0baRepublic @aad100 I'm happy to say I'm liberal but we've got problems with being sanctimonious. This shit doesn't warrant niceness.
835444614115037184 2017-02-25 11:01:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jholtham @SarahLerner @LaurenMilberger You mean descendants . But yeah, almost as embarrassing as the "he can grab my pussy" women.
835444067337109506 2017-02-25 10:59:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JuddLegum @BradMossEsq @aad100 Hopefully we're moving to a world where Con vs Lib means we disagree but can compromise, not we're enemies.
835399570137956352 2017-02-25 08:02:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Bencjacobs @v_erratic Yup. Horrendous. I'm running out of adjectives of outrage.
835398374035763201 2017-02-24 07:57:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Bencjacobs And utterly terrify.
835267713434005504 2017-02-24 23:18:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> White House only allowing its own propaganda media into a briefing.

835263142540234752 2017-02-24 23:00:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @guardian @UKIPNFKN I can relate to this.
835259162972073984 2017-02-24 22:44:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @CNN @GovMikeHuckabee @sox_morgan Is this a real account? Because this analogy did not say what you thought it said.
835257362810355712 2017-02-24 22:37:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HuffPostPol @USAGoodAgain That's about as explicit an acknowledgement you can get that Republicans only win when they obstruct voters.
835254779597160448 2017-02-24 22:27:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidCornDC @petersongeorged That was my first thought!
835254720927318016 2017-02-24 22:26:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MiamiNewTimes @DavidCornDC Oh but it's not a Muslim ban...
835253977713426434 2017-02-24 22:24:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EmilyThornberry @UKLabour From my perspective it looks as though labour has done everything it can to capitulate to May.
835250346943528960 2017-02-24 22:09:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @POTUS @KThomasDC If I'm on a plane I hope there's an experienced and qualified professional pilot, not someone I have to hope can fly.

834377231325593601 2017-02-22 12:20:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid @thatjane2 This GOP administration is not patriotic. They don't believe in democracy. They want a radical Christian theocracy.

833019275413696513 2017-02-18 18:24:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @0drat @solange_lebourg But does that ever work? I guess it's happening right now in the US so I shouldn't ask that.
832947694276575232 2017-02-18 13:39:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @0drat @solange_lebourg It's a strange logic.
832947219967901701 2017-02-18 13:37:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Freeyourmindkid Sadly I think many will deny it's happening, or figure out a way to blame a Democrat.

832728567322640384 2017-02-17 23:08:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @th3j35t3r Because they sincerely believe that half of us are not legitimate Americans. They believe we are traitors.

832727091225309184 2017-02-17 23:03:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @politico Of course he did. That's the guy that was supposed to be with him during the alleged rape, right?
832724520725196800 2017-02-17 22:52:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ShepNewsTeam Thanks for speaking up for the truth.
832724212867424256 2017-02-17 22:51:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @USATODAY I DGAF about liberal vs conservative right now. I just want rational thought to return.
832723719839633413 2017-02-17 22:49:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @USATODAY Of course they call for him to be fired. They can't handle reality.

832695411471060993 2017-02-17 20:57:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PeterBeinart @sox_morgan @realDonaldTrump @TheAtlantic The reporter didn't accuse him of antisemitism at all. His response was nonsensical.
832675325460963329 2017-02-17 19:37:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JordanUhl @sox_morgan Good grief, is he talking about it *again*?
832663868434370561 2017-02-17 18:51:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DavidCornDC Bannon purging his rivals, and any sensible objections, I fear.
832657324032487425 2017-02-17 18:25:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @politico @leahmcelrath Great. Thanks a lot, Congress. I hope that the people who voted for him are first to feel the effects. 
832543044146700288 2017-02-17 10:51:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @WillMcAvoyACN @mslinda_j Exactly what I was going to say! 
832542489093480448 2017-02-17 10:49:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Whovian_Chick @RoseChub23 @katspeek Yeah but he doesn't need Craigslist for that. I'm positive it was a fake ad.
832541951559876610 2017-02-17 10:47:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @jnmedina8989 Is this any more credible than the ads for paid protesters at the women's march, though? Seems fake to me.
832541072886751232 2017-02-17 10:43:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jasoninthehouse @RealMuckmaker @ezlusztig @sicknitter OMG did you use complete sentences with verbs and everything?! You're dangerous!
832540258331983873 2017-02-17 10:40:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ezlusztig That's exactly what they are. Funny how they weren't scared when the tea party people did the same thing.

832317866724704256 2017-02-16 19:56:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jonworth That's what I mean - they aren't looking to see if someone else is already working on their great idea.
832313841748942849 2017-02-16 19:40:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MoreUnitedUK @The48plus I don't want to be too critical but I don't feel that the process was very transparent.
832313455067725836 2017-02-16 19:39:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @MoreUnitedUK @The48plus I'm also a founding member and I'm not very happy either. I didn't hear anything until the candidate was selected.
832272647530614785 2017-02-16 16:57:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @vicenews Of course he does. He's probably compromised too.
832271811274477570 2017-02-16 16:53:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @jonworth Too much emphasis on trying to be innovative & not enough on research & collaboration?
832235133755342848 2017-02-16 14:28:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @vicenews How cowardly.

831621480282722306 2017-02-14 21:49:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump Well, since you're discussing that in the middle of a restaurant with no security, what further damage can leaks do?
831619183653838848 2017-02-14 21:40:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @BuzzFeedNews @MatthewGreen02 You're talking about UKIP here though...
831572055636267011 2017-02-14 18:33:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @VICE I get the feeling that #Flynn was a sacrifice and an attempt to kill the Russia story by blaming him for talk of lifting sanctions.
831570223199318021 2017-02-14 18:26:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @AdamWeinstein @sox_morgan I'd be somewhat relieved.
831565949211914240 2017-02-14 18:09:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Evan_McMullin @JeffreyGuterman Tillerson too. Exxon will make $500 billion if sanctions are lifted.

829057489798848512 2017-02-07 20:01:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenateMajLdr @mikestill I think "choice" is false promise. Schools should all be equal. Charters divert resources from public.
829057109648093184 2017-02-07 19:59:52 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenateMajLdr @mikestill But they are not always. Plus I object to taxpayer dollars funding religious charter schools.
829056778042220545 2017-02-07 19:58:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @pwthornton They should have voted no. Props to @lisamurkowski and @SenatorCollins who at least tried. The rest of the GOP can go to hell.
829056006898475010 2017-02-07 19:55:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @pwthornton They will follow him into hell if they think they will keep their seats. I'm disgusted.
829055236601950213 2017-02-07 19:52:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @catvalente Yeah, I almost voted for him once but he's lost my support. You are a hypocrite, @SenJohnMcCain.
829053684038455297 2017-02-07 19:46:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> I despise Pence and the entire Republican administration. How can you condemn the children of the USA to the utterly inept #DeVos? COWARDS.
829053039638110210 2017-02-07 19:43:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenateMajLdr @mikestill Charter schools can be awesome but they are limited in availability. Everyone should have good schools
829052673437601796 2017-02-07 19:42:15 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> I'm definitely on the #DemEnter side but I think this is right. We have to be careful not to throw out the baby. http://www.democraticpulse.com/2016/second-chance/
829015577813516292 2017-02-07 17:14:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenCoryGardner Vote no on DeVos. A qualified conservative surely exists. This is an insult to those who voted to #draintheswamp.
829013045666017280 2017-02-07 17:04:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @datashade Oh ha, I didn't even notice the date! No idea how I even saw it in the first place. But still a good point.
829010285423910912 2017-02-07 16:53:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @datashade I thought you were saying that ppl using adblock aren't exposed to ads for this kind of stuff & therefore don't know it exists.
828998885058150400 2017-02-07 16:08:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @vvega1008 You know, maybe an ID card should be introduced. If every eligible voter had one we'd show just how few cheats there are.

828997931076300800 2017-02-07 16:04:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @doctor_oxford @FrontlineDoc @Fifino9 I'm an immigrant myself. I'm not arguing that we should withhold treatment, but I think the NHS is 1
828997463205888001 2017-02-07 16:02:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @doctor_oxford @FrontlineDoc @Fifino9 it saves, but I would also say that it's fair to acknowledge that it happens sometimes.
828997244141576192 2017-02-07 16:01:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @doctor_oxford @FrontlineDoc @Fifino9 I wouldn't. I think it's not worth the bother to get ppl to pay up front as it would cost more than 1
828996900531687425 2017-02-07 16:00:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @doctor_oxford @Fifino9 @FrontlineDoc problem that it's pretty much irrelevant. 3
828996761100414977 2017-02-07 16:00:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @doctor_oxford @Fifino9 @FrontlineDoc but it's not worth the cost to put in a system to prevent it. Health care tourism is such a tiny 2
828996552781881345 2017-02-07 15:59:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @doctor_oxford @Fifino9 @FrontlineDoc That's my point, really. I'll concede to critics that sometimes people get treatment that shouldn't, 1
828972864535662594 2017-02-07 14:25:07 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @mattyglesias Yes. And Nice, and Orlando, and and and. Maybe it's not on Fox but I hear about them.

828971579619028992 2017-02-07 14:20:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @doctor_oxford @FrontlineDoc @Fifino9 There is so little actual abuse that taking steps to counter it costs more than it does itself.
828971378640551936 2017-02-07 14:19:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @doctor_oxford @FrontlineDoc @Fifino9 Why not? I think the principle is fair but it would cost more than it saves. Should not be GPs job tho
828956536277983232 2017-02-07 13:20:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenateMajLdr @mikestill We should improve standards for all and not just those who can pay.
828956326306967552 2017-02-07 13:19:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenateMajLdr @mikestill I went to a mediocre public school & still managed to earn a PhD.
828955983170924545 2017-02-07 13:18:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenateMajLdr @mikestill Oh it can get much, much worse. And it will if DeVos is confirmed.
828955725418360832 2017-02-07 13:17:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenateMajLdr I know several teachers including special ed teachers and they all say she's a disaster. Find a better candidate.
828953131463667713 2017-02-07 13:06:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> But he's done no such thing. Handing over to family & retaining roles as exec producer is not removing himself from influence.
828952798201016320 2017-02-07 13:05:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @markcha I'm sure the process can be improved but I don't think market is the best judge. Most ppl are not qualified to judge efficacy.
828952539676672000 2017-02-07 13:04:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @markcha But it may be unethical to give them false hope. And companies might have incentive to market drugs w/o benefit or adequate rsch.
828941613879660545 2017-02-07 12:20:56 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SwiftOnSecurity @datashade Good point, but then if you don't visit sites where they are advertised are you likely to see them at all?

828940040944353285 2017-02-07 12:14:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @washingtonpost @Nixanadoo This is what I find offensive. I could not care less about the other allegations.

828927864850542592 2017-02-07 11:26:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @KiefChris Yet his website is widely cited as proof that protesters are being paid.
828927595790077952 2017-02-07 11:25:14 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @FastCompany @PaigeBoehmcke I was thinking "why do I need a device to tell me I'm angry? I know that already!"
828920382237339648 2017-02-07 10:56:34 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @cutter78 @margarance Certainly says more of what's on my mind in this instance.
828919736876539904 2017-02-07 10:54:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @politico @ChrisMAGA2017 My cousins have terrible educations & can barely use a computer, but guns are more important.
828918265032347648 2017-02-07 10:48:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @politico @ChrisMAGA2017 Or rather big business. My uncles cannot compete against giant agribusiness & are on the brink.
828917720955703297 2017-02-07 10:45:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @politico @ChrisMAGA2017 Including many Republicans. Why do they keep implementing policy that favors business over people?
828917275969347584 2017-02-07 10:44:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump @politico It's good but I worry that this approach will only cause further entrenchment. I want Dems to show a better way.
828914744987877377 2017-02-07 10:34:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenateDems @SenBobCasey @thereal_hair @RevMGD Also I think part of the value of public ed is exposing kids to different views
828913695967289344 2017-02-07 10:30:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenateDems @SenBobCasey @thereal_hair @RevMGD Businesses want people who are competent in science and math, & have awareness of the world.
828913374952042496 2017-02-07 10:28:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenateDems @SenBobCasey @thereal_hair @RevMGD Replacing public schools with private religious school will not improve employment chances.
828912343673352193 2017-02-07 10:24:37 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenateDems @SenBobCasey Good. Get a better nominee, @realDonaldTrump. I'm happy with a competent conservative but not DeVos.
828911978542411776 2017-02-07 10:23:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @doctor_oxford @FrontlineDoc I don't object to charging ppl, necessarily, but I suspect the cost of doing that outweighs the benefit.
828910309070999552 2017-02-07 10:16:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @politico I do feel a bit for Spicer. Terrible job to have, covering for a Republican administration that insists on constant lying.
828907230162460673 2017-02-07 10:04:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TIME @JoeMeltu No complaints because they divested or had blind trusts & after Kennedy scandal didn't hire relatives.
828906899848495104 2017-02-07 10:02:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TIME @LydiaHluvsdogs Yes. Trump himself might not be all that bad but Bannon & Miller are the ones setting the agenda.
828905829726294018 2017-02-07 09:58:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TIME Giving profits to the treasury does not erase the fact that foreign govt's may still be buying favors & that is only hotels
828903211666898945 2017-02-07 09:48:20 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @TIME @stocktradr @FatuousTwaddle This Congress? Liberal? Have words ceased to have any meaning?
828902485662240768 2017-02-07 09:45:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ezlusztig Yeah I am worried about this. I usually dismiss the idea of a false flag operation but now I am wondering.
828902209270214657 2017-02-07 09:44:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ezlusztig I live in Europe and I am far more nervous when I go home to visit the US than I am going around London or Paris.
828901594439774212 2017-02-07 09:41:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenBennetCO Thank you. We need someone who actually knows what their department is for.

828767340850470912 2017-02-06 00:48:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @markcha If I have an illness I don't want to waste time and money on a remedy that has no known benefit.
828767073769779201 2017-02-06 00:47:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @markcha People often cling to therapies that demonstrably don't work. Isn't it potential exploitation to let a market decide?
828743803615997953 2017-02-06 23:14:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JoyAnnReid @DebbieCaplanPR I would so love to send my jerkface rep packing.
828731017083158528 2017-02-06 22:24:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nytimes @markcha Is it? From the article it seems like it would make it easier to market drugs with no actual benefit.
828729265235570689 2017-02-06 22:17:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @FastCompany @PaigeBoehmcke Yeah, you're right. I didn't read it properly and was thinking that they would only monitor one's own responses.

828625714761056256 2017-02-06 15:25:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Not that I'll ever be in this position, but if you want to be a whistleblower here's advice from The Intercept. https://theintercept.com/2015/01/28/how-to-leak-to-the-intercept/
828621780780736512 2017-02-06 15:10:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @realDonaldTrump "many people say" is not data. You appear to be calling your shots based on fabrications and hearsay.
828573658822098946 2017-02-06 11:58:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Politics_co_uk @MikeH_PR @noddynoo Most seem to be demanding capitulation and silence. Ain't gonna happen until they kill me, too.

828572073324838912 2017-02-06 11:52:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @guardian @adamvaughan_uk @CarbonBrief Ouch, but I'm not convinced the deal was a good one to start with. But I'm in favour of nuclear.
828571581601480706 2017-02-06 11:50:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @FastCompany If I need a device to tell me that then I have failed as a human.

828570856687288320 2017-02-06 11:47:40 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> I do agree that we are perhaps too quick to cry outrage. We should have a better strategy. But it's still outrageous.https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/02/02/trump-outrage
828554406345981953 2017-02-06 10:42:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @KateHoeyMP We are still members of the EU and not at war with a hostile Belgium.

828546365278081024 2017-02-06 10:10:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SocialistVoice @The48plus Yes it changed my position, and no, I won't be voting labour again in the foreseeable future.
828545154533449728 2017-02-06 10:05:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PolitPlato This is the one case in which I would believe allegations of a false flag operation.
828544687061491713 2017-02-06 10:03:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @micahflee @BoobPunchTina I think maybe he'd realize he's being played by President Bannon. Maybe.
828538152130379776 2017-02-06 09:37:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean MPs realise that they can't keep their seats using rational arguments with the uninformed, perhaps?
828537824601309186 2017-02-06 09:36:25 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean It would be harder for the ones who know how EU works & want to destroy to avoid regulation to hoodwink the general public.

828536441256939520 2017-02-06 09:30:55 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nytimesworld A pity. May obviously wants a good legacy but she's blown her chance by ignoring half the country & appeasing Bannon.
828529389109379072 2017-02-06 09:02:54 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @EUtopean My takeaway is that civics education is terrible.
828525421092290561 2017-02-06 08:47:08 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @FLOTUS @politico She could do all these things, if they weren't the polar opposite of the trump agenda.
828523883854708736 2017-02-06 08:41:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @crafticarolyn @HuffPostPol The Republican administration will make cosmetic changes & pass it off as their success.

828372697457508354 2017-02-05 22:40:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @cmclymer It's a pity. I don't really follow any sports but every time I've watched a pro women's team it was just as exciting as men's.
828372131511726080 2017-02-05 22:38:01 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @POTUS @cmclymer @CtrlY_Democracy Quite. And sports uniforms aren't "dressing like a woman".
828352315291729920 2017-02-05 21:19:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @rick00979 @docrocktex26 @janis_wilds I think they were already like that. Trump just gave them an opening.
828346648485044224 2017-02-05 20:56:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Freeyourmindkid @KathWertheim She is looking more haggard all the time. Trump and Bannon are probably terrible to work for.
828346047713988609 2017-02-05 20:54:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @HuffPostUK @LouiseMensch Indeed. I am more concerned about politicians who claim they never used any drugs or did anything silly as youths.
828344570345820164 2017-02-05 20:48:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @rick00979 @docrocktex26 @janis_wilds That and power. They are really close to being able to establish a de facto theocracy.
828342927319511040 2017-02-05 20:41:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Peradventur3 @nosemonkey @simoncstock Yup. And anyone not white British.

828330210835693568 2017-02-05 19:51:26 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ezlusztig @JRutstein You may be right there. Interesting angle. More trolling behaviour.

828307783732838400 2017-02-05 18:22:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenateMajLdr @jaketapper @lf092313 The entire Republican administration is complicit if they don't challenge his lies.

828262918433230848 2017-02-05 15:24:02 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @justinhendrix Bannon himself said that trump didn't get it. I can see that he's making a fool of @realDonaldTrump.
828225455379591168 2017-02-05 12:55:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GovMikeHuckabee Seriously? I expect better from our elective representatives. This is very childish of you.

827660327101804544 2017-02-03 23:29:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @dailykos Does that mean the Republicans are waking up, finally? I'm certainly much happier with @lisamurkowski than I ever thought I'd be.

827203352303955968 2017-02-02 17:13:42 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @ParkerMolloy @pwthornton How much of a say does Congress have in state university funding?
827163211187249154 2017-02-02 14:34:12 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JulietMEvans It cost me 1500 to become a British citizen. Part of the reason I did so & didn't just stay on ILR was to also be EU citizen.
827159707492179969 2017-02-02 14:20:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @guardian Yet another example of @theresa_may incompetence?

827158833969688576 2017-02-02 14:16:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Independent @RussellRElliott @ezlusztig @wru4me They never will. They've been sold lies for years & yet continue to defend the liars.

827152836513378307 2017-02-02 13:52:58 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @skennison I also have a Venezuelan friend who says this. People are too blinded by their prejudice or lulled by feeling of security.

827149700788867072 2017-02-02 13:40:31 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @maggiepriceless @DavidYankovich @rhiles2760 They have been doing this for years. Decades. Look up "Southern Strategy".
827148619170062336 2017-02-02 13:36:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans I think discouraging ppl who want to cause mayhem and attack ppl & property is one way to do that.
827146704508051457 2017-02-02 13:28:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans It hurt them directly as they were held responsible for my actions. I increased their oppression by trying to speak for them.
827146148968333313 2017-02-02 13:26:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans Plus there is a lot to do. I'm not wasting my energy on milo. Let him talk. I will work on lessening his power in other ways.
827145669458722816 2017-02-02 13:24:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans I think we are on very dangerous ground w/laws being introduced all over that will curb protest rights & need to be careful.
827145130582953984 2017-02-02 13:22:21 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans I did that in my youth, in favour of a cause I believed in, but rapidly learned that my actions hurt the ppl I was supporting.
827144892623228928 2017-02-02 13:21:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans We have to be careful in this fact-free environment. I'm mad as hell but it is not a justification for crime & vandalism.
827144480017043457 2017-02-02 13:19:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans It's the image, not the money. If you act in a way that can be twisted to make you seem like a thug you will be viewed as one.
827143905846112257 2017-02-02 13:17:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans That is partly why ppl like MLK were so adamant that protest be peaceful & not destructive.
827143698546835461 2017-02-02 13:16:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans We are being dismissed as rioters, paid thugs, ne'er-do-wells. Violence gives excuse to shut down protest w/militarised police.
827143099361218560 2017-02-02 13:14:17 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans The business, the employees who might lose shifts if it has to close, but most of all the credibility of the protesters
827141465579085824 2017-02-02 13:07:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GringoPeruano Pushing Rogers out was telling, I think. They are only looking at short term gains, not interested in bigger picture.
827140926619451394 2017-02-02 13:05:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans This whole mess is basically a troll attack. Feeding the trolls makes them stronger.
827140579133906946 2017-02-02 13:04:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans I'm not saying we should never protest but we should pick battles more carefully.
827140217257725952 2017-02-02 13:02:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans Of course it is violent speech but he's going to put that message out by other means. A big crazy reaction is what he wants.
827139403403448321 2017-02-02 12:59:35 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans People who are basically anarchists or looking to cause trouble for publicity are harmful even if they agree with the purpose.
827138990402834433 2017-02-02 12:57:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans Of course. Not really directed at the gov't but I wish ppl protesting would think more strategically sometimes.
827138720046407684 2017-02-02 12:56:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans actually harming the "liberal" side. Feels bad to say that but I think it's true. We should be more resilient to insults. 2
827138388075634688 2017-02-02 12:55:33 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans Honestly, yes, unless the speech itself calls for direct violence. I think a rigid insistence on non-provocative speech is 1/
827137674117074944 2017-02-02 12:52:43 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @GringoPeruano I don't see why they are all so fixated on the short term so much. Their legacy & party would last longer if they look ahead.
827136778159140867 2017-02-02 12:49:10 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans Turning it into a riot is a provocation that will end our right to protest if we're not careful.
827136553763950595 2017-02-02 12:48:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans In any case I have never supported no platforming. If I demand a right for myself then I have to allow it for others.
827135436447444993 2017-02-02 12:43:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @erikpudans Claim all the tickets then don't show up. Close everything else on campus. Try to deny him an audience.
827133981158154241 2017-02-02 12:38:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @asymetricjockey @margarance @JulietMEvans I've only been one for three years! I want my money back!
827131587796021248 2017-02-02 12:28:32 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Brantherton I didn't question his qualifications but his views. Judges have biases; this bit of information concerns me.
827130997980459008 2017-02-02 12:26:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @dec_900 @erikpudans A boycott would be more effective. Starting what can be construed as a riot only feeds "crybaby liberal" caricature.
827129494590865408 2017-02-02 12:20:13 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @guardian @Prospectally2 It would be much more effective to do this, or to fill the audience with people who then walk out en masse.
827129176654217216 2017-02-02 12:18:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @guardian @W1nston_Sm1th The guy is a jerk but shutting him down and rioting is not the way to counter him. Stupid thing to do.
827128272651710464 2017-02-02 12:15:22 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @dec_900 @erikpudans It effectively is, though. I think that it is a fair charge that no platforming curtails speech.
827127692055162883 2017-02-02 12:13:03 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @guardian Sigh. This is the wrong response. I don't like him but I think no platforming is too rigid.

826575243938500612 2017-01-31 23:37:49 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sahilkapur @jaydestro Well breitbart is running the white house now so it's just as good a source as press secretary, I reckon.
826575034856644609 2017-01-31 23:36:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sahilkapur So it's not a recent phenomenon & very unlikely the US would ever have similar numbers.
826574693968838656 2017-01-31 23:35:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @sahilkapur Um. One reason why France, at least, has large Muslim pop is because it had colonies in Muslim countries. US did not.

825834142466179074 2017-01-29 22:32:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @SenSchumer We already see what is happening. Deny all his appointments and get rid of Bannon too. This is an obvious coup attempt.

825832459694665729 2017-01-29 22:26:16 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @DaShanneStokes @funder It's working nicely in distracting us from reorg that elevates Bannon over Nat'l Security advisors, CIA, Joint Chief
825776726055727111 2017-01-29 18:44:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @basaynon Me too. Obvs terrorism is a threat but this kind of ham fisted effort only alienates ppl & adds fuel to the fire.
825756831456833541 2017-01-29 17:25:45 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @basaynon What do you mean? People left for family trips & were detained when they returned because of their country of origin.

825706942127546368 2017-01-29 14:07:30 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @scottjohnson @JRubinBlogger @2ndTimotheus316 So why is it unacceptable to prevent ppl like him buying guns? A known "bad dude".
825706586375090176 2017-01-29 14:06:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JRubinBlogger @basaynon People who are green card holders, etc were detained. Designed for maximum outrage but baseless; distraction.
825700854963519488 2017-01-29 13:43:19 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @JRubinBlogger @ezlusztig Distraction from putting Bannon on Security Council avoid Joint Chiefs & CIA
825696019170095104 2017-01-29 13:24:06 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @joshtpm @ZootopiaCity Except that it's now almost a coup and we may not have elections again. We're still assuming that the rules apply.
825693723929485312 2017-01-29 13:14:59 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @joshtpm @Ammo_Bundy It's infuriating. But I guess they want their theocratic state & see this as their way to get it.

824411298184253440 2017-01-25 00:19:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NesrineMalik @kushkandy95 It's all so stupid. We have a very stringent vetting process already. It's pure xenophobia & baseless.
824410696305770497 2017-01-25 00:16:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @business @solange_lebourg Indeed. Very slippery ones too, no doubt. Esp with trump involved. Can't understand May's tactics at all.

824398849418661889 2017-01-25 23:29:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibyaLiberty @The_War_TARDIS I'm worried it will be replaced with a Christian Bible. And with white supremacist policies.
824392255536500736 2017-01-25 23:03:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @LibyaLiberty @The_War_TARDIS I can't even begin to describe how angry this makes me. And these assholes claim to love the Constitution?

824312096246628352 2017-01-25 17:44:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @RightWingWatch Maybe we need to start a bunch of science based charter schools and free home school materials.
824309730407546881 2017-01-25 17:35:29 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @piersmorgan This is almost as dumb as the people who got mad at Bradley Cooper for supporting Democrats
824282254910308352 2017-01-25 15:46:18 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @guardian Shouldn't he have been purged from both under crosscheck, then? Oh wait, he's white.

824014384175415296 2017-01-24 22:01:53 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @justicedems Do you know about @BrandNew535? Similar idea.

824012186704027650 2017-01-24 21:53:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @PressSec @TomNamako Why did Spicer's response talk about recount? That wasn't the question, but rather why trump is lying about this.
824009790921854977 2017-01-24 21:43:38 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @dontbrexitfixit @solange_lebourg The rich ones certainly hope so. They will be able to buy our remaining public assets very cheaply.

823856474036248577 2017-01-24 11:34:24 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @margarance @arsetechnica Same thing with Brexit. I know many who are considering leaving & they are not the low-skill unemployed ones.
823855414416723971 2017-01-24 11:30:11 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @nytimes Seems quite sad. Probably a far more sustainable and satisfying life in the end.

823276485553356802 2017-01-22 21:09:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @valefariam Hence why so many white women in particular voted trump, maybe? A mindset that in some way they are lesser and shouldn't offend.

823197976495616003 2017-01-22 15:57:46 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @washingtonpost @crampell A fairly patronising article. Millennials I know represent all views & participation levels, not all are so naive.
823188169499807744 2017-01-22 15:18:48 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @NewEuropeans This is why I don't underand the A50 timetable. Seems it would be prudent to wait & see who is elected, no?
823186947548057600 2017-01-22 15:13:57 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @UKLabour @diponte @james_tallack Exactly. If we accept that immigration is a problem then the ? becomes why didn't May enforce the rules?

822757494523129856 2017-01-21 10:47:27 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Should have brought my big US flag down to London with me. Patriotism is not racism or nationalism.

818971379819225088 2017-01-10 00:02:47 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Scientists4EU @croft1a Perhaps not. I only read the excerpts. I'll watch the whole thing when I have time.
818971096758321153 2017-01-10 00:01:39 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @cmclymer This is why I don't support the death penalty. It makes martyrs of people who should be forgotten.
818970359420616704 2017-01-10 23:58:44 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Scientists4EU @croft1a The EU and immigration are not the cause of austerity, benefit cuts, and NHS cuts.
818969886034690048 2017-01-10 23:56:51 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Scientists4EU @croft1a I'm just frustrated that he seems to be pandering to UKIP and Tories instead of challenging the flawed logic.
818968279117164545 2017-01-10 23:50:28 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Scientists4EU @croft1a Of course he's allowed, just like everyone else. I happen to disagree with his position.
818967948039782400 2017-01-10 23:49:09 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Scientists4EU @croft1a Honestly I'd say that the garbage printed in the press has been a huge factor. So many lies about immigrants.
818854585724993536 2017-01-10 16:18:41 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @docrocktex26 @JFKoerner Did you suggest they could print this out and shove it you-know-where?
818854414471593988 2017-01-10 16:18:00 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @docrocktex26 @JFKoerner Damn, what a bullshit meme. That completely trivialises and shames everyone who has required medication.
818812536829177856 2017-01-10 13:31:36 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Scientists4EU @croft1a But the UK, esp May as Home Sec, failed to implement the existing possible tools at its disposal. Not the EU's fault
818810216875749377 2017-01-10 13:22:23 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> @Scientists4EU @Cilvrnum @Scouriebeast A falsehood to make their xenophobic plans seem palatable to the undecided.

818724578335870976 2017-01-09 07:42:05 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Pretty much nails it. Not that leaving the EU will do anything to help. Get the Tories out. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/10/blunt-heckler-economists-failing-us-booming-britain-gdp-london
818631656265420802 2017-01-09 01:32:50 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> .@theresa_may You could start by not dehumanising EU citizens by calling them "negotiating capital"
818629196675219457 2017-01-09 01:23:04 UTC <SaltyHarrumph> Great to know my friends & colleagues are mere "negotiating capital". What's that about working for everyone, @theresa_may ?
