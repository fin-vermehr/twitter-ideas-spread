897715690332987393 2017-08-16 07:04:33 UTC <EUflagmafia> @jameschappers @MaryKHarringto2 @asphodelia @fish_in_a_hat @patrickamon You were lied to. Your team cheated to get the result. I dont respect the result and living in a democracy, I can oppose it. It is suicide.

897580298707324928 2017-08-15 22:06:34 UTC <EUflagmafia> @kurt_obruny @k3books And why would Remainers not want this? Remainers own or work for businesses. Or is it only leavers running business? You're a complete joke.
897579925682749440 2017-08-15 22:05:05 UTC <EUflagmafia> @kurt_obruny No because brexit will fail ultimately and you know it.... It's a house built on sand. Enjoy your moment though, while it lasts. X
