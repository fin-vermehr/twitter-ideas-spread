822349538149203970 2017-01-19 07:46:23 UTC <karalslarak> @iSmashFizzle Same. I can only cry and be sad, mad and heartbroken. It feels like a break up, when you're both still in love but someone has to move.

821542227243581440 2017-01-17 02:18:25 UTC <karalslarak> @NBCThisisUs When I have a bad day, I remind myself #ThisIsUs is an hour show instead of 30 mins! Life seems better in that perspective.
