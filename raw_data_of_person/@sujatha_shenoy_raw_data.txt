971163450897518593 2018-03-06 23:19:44 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @natalieymoore Such a bubbly, happy, tweet! Cheers!
971163062270078976 2018-03-06 23:18:12 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @BetsyDeVosED Thats awful. Take useless tests like PARC out of the schools, give the teacher better pay and let them teach.
971162562292322305 2018-03-06 23:16:12 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @AnandWrites Too funny!! Capitalism is built on the premise that profits matter above all. I dont think hell have any trouble finding a spot once hes had a vacation and everyones moved on.
971137798706204672 2018-03-06 21:37:48 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @shannonrwatts @owillis Not a gun owner but @bethanyshondark added a necessary perspective. If we cannot listen, we cannot understand.
971036135718883328 2018-03-06 14:53:50 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @lpolgreen What is the one thing that you can say or do to make sure that children of all ethnicities feel that they truly belong and are not looked upon as outsiders?
970761090631196674 2018-03-05 20:40:54 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> Tired of the constant #oscars replay. Maybe Im just following the wrong people? #Oscars
970720345576689665 2018-03-05 17:59:00 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @jiatolentino @NewYorker @michaelluo Perfect. Just the perfect read.
970720022782992386 2018-03-05 17:57:43 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> Recuperating from surgery on Friday and this was the first tweet that I saw. You too @KarenAttiah, you too are going to have an amazing week!!
969324307322228736 2018-03-01 21:31:38 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @AnupKaphle Congratulations!! This seems like the perfect fit.
969309625886629889 2018-03-01 20:33:18 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @KarenAttiah So true. So sad.
968507579411390464 2018-02-27 15:26:15 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> Me - exactly a year ago: We are really are living in a world of reality TV in the US - live drama with the Cubs, the elections, Super Bowl and now the Oscars!! ... wish this past year was a TV that we could turn off.
967521282832125953 2018-02-24 22:07:04 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @michaelluo @minjinlee11 The inspirational director of the @CCChoir @josephineslee is also a child of the two Koreas. My kids in the choir are singing a Korean unification song. Makes us all wonder for what might have been in so much of this divided world.
964168626600333312 2018-02-15 16:04:48 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> What have we become as a country when Florida officials go on TV asking for GoFundMe donations for the Florida high school shooting victims? #floridahighschoolshooting
958733691517272064 2018-01-31 16:08:19 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> It would have been wonderful if #Potus had showcased an entrepreneur of color with a white employee. #SOTUnion #WishfulThinking
957805982968700929 2018-01-28 02:41:56 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @lpolgreen Bravo Kesha!
957788257336680448 2018-01-28 01:31:30 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> Is it just me or were the women in the Despacito Grammy performance completely out of sync with todays environment? #Grammys2018
865646821871202305 2017-05-19 19:14:19 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @mattyglesias Jared Kushner has a spokesman?!
865282320517017600 2017-05-18 19:05:56 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @muckrack My answer to @MuckRack Daily's trivia question: Geese!! Mother Goose would have some fun new stories if she were around.
863741707996803073 2017-05-14 13:04:05 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> The irony of Mothers Day in a country without maternity benefits and politicians talking of stripping maternity coverage #MothersDay2017
862732082694508544 2017-05-11 18:12:11 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @ryangrim Because clearly white men rule and they need to understand this demographic (sigh)!
857319371915571200 2017-04-26 19:44:01 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @jelani9 He also got adulation, a Nobel and lots of post office revenue making opportunities. Let's be fair about the upside for him too.
857298382947307521 2017-04-26 18:20:36 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @lpolgreen The question: Will any media outlet publish pix of the devastation on bodies? Would you @HuffPost?
856640426819940356 2017-04-24 22:46:08 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> Nothing better than receiving a book in the mail from @rgay. Thank you!
855391745823178752 2017-04-21 12:04:19 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> Thoughtful piece that asks the right questions @qzhttps://twitter.com/qz/status/855385628187525120
855224266845036545 2017-04-20 00:58:49 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @ghoshworld @Paro_Ghosh Great story!
855131128637902848 2017-04-20 18:48:43 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @nytimes Memo to self: Get O'Reilly's attorney while signing contracts. Cannot believe there was no clause for firing with cause!
853985311105396736 2017-04-17 14:55:39 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @nxthompson 2/2 FB is in a grey area here - it is a product, but it is also casting itself as a media company. A question that I would like to explore.
853984594256961538 2017-04-17 14:52:48 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @nxthompson 1/2 When a product can be used to glorify/ propagate violence, does it need to be regulated? Is FB a media co or is it selling a product?
852676976129302528 2017-04-13 00:16:47 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @fivefifths No, the people quoted in the article were...
852357411058974721 2017-04-12 03:06:57 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @nytopinion The producers @CBS #SurvivorGameChangers used the footage as great TV. They didn't exactly act admirably either.
851925059702841344 2017-04-11 22:28:56 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @JeffreyGoldberg Voice of reason. I worry that media hysteria over everything dilutes the real flaws.
851885493121929216 2017-04-11 19:51:43 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> What @PressSec was trying to say .... @RyanLizza avoids the snark and gets to the point.https://twitter.com/ryanlizza/status/851881306678059008
851493300922175489 2017-04-10 17:53:17 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> Immigration isn't the problem. Integration is.
851489959567646720 2017-04-10 17:40:00 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @PRWeekUS @united @seanmdav @United This is just deliciously bad timing! @prweekUS
851487284528631809 2017-04-10 17:29:23 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @jelani9 "calcified legacies of racism" ... soft spoken but dagger like words on @billmaher.
849662476375535617 2017-04-05 16:38:14 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @nhannahjones I wonder how many Googlers have children in public schools?
849384108417589249 2017-04-04 22:12:06 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @SethAMandel Most haunting tweet today ...
848887424491163648 2017-04-03 13:18:28 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @beauty_jackson I needed this today. Thank you!
848614972934565888 2017-04-02 19:15:50 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @ReaganBattalion Unfollowing because every tweet is marked "may include potentially sensitive content."
848543522013806592 2017-04-02 14:31:55 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @JeffreyGoldberg And you said? Btw, in B-school we were advised never to order spaghetti during business lunches ...too messy = bad impression
848508762851880960 2017-04-02 12:13:48 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @cavsdan @ron_fournier This gives perspective. Which we all need. Thanks for sharing/ writing.
847964715942891521 2017-03-31 00:11:57 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> Must read fearless piece by @jonathanchaithttp://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/the-gops-best-health-care-idea-is-to-stick-it-to-mothers.html
847957501228273664 2017-03-31 23:43:17 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @rcallimachi I started reading you because of your first name; stayed for the stories. Glad you walked thru that door.
847893744930181120 2017-03-31 19:29:56 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> Sorry @Google @googlemaps but it is not April 1 yet and Mrs Pac man is annoying.
847892263757860866 2017-03-31 19:24:03 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @emmaladyrose @lpolgreen The real question here is: Why is everyone surprised? His views on women's rights and choices were apparent.
847862129977905152 2017-03-31 17:24:18 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @NewYorker For the same reasons that scientific data has had no effect on environmental policy in this administration.
847545942521806848 2017-03-30 20:27:53 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @qz She's probably assistant President in reality though.
847542459479584772 2017-03-30 20:14:03 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> So tired of the @mike_pence eating with only his wife tweets. Point made, move on.
847536491928662016 2017-03-30 19:50:20 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @civilwarbore Adorable! This urban gal is glad that I get to learn many things from you ...
847535237374586880 2017-03-30 19:45:21 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> What is going on? Not cool if this some sly behind the scenes shenanigan to silence @ReaganBattalion
847533518624370690 2017-03-30 19:38:31 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @civilwarbore They are very cool political thoughts too.
847061880300601344 2017-03-29 12:24:24 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @PreetBharara He's not the only one with a powerful message. Hint, hint (run for office!!)
846822102586003456 2017-03-28 20:31:37 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @lpolgreen However, what you said is true and needed to be said. No million $ comma here.
846724366226374656 2017-03-28 14:03:14 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @regwag2003 Following you because this made me laugh!
846392334375960576 2017-03-27 16:03:52 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @VA_GreatFalls What is that? Intrigued.
846380263584268289 2017-03-27 15:15:54 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @asymmetricinfo Went to the same B-school, lived in India and couldn't agree with you more!
846104193580584960 2017-03-26 20:58:54 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> Should have addressed @bentaub91https://twitter.com/sujatha_shenoy/status/846101626997878784
846101626997878784 2017-03-26 20:48:42 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @opcofamerica @michaelluo Excited to read the new piece!
846101199388585989 2017-03-26 20:47:00 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @jelani9 Do we really need to give them more publicity?
846018926094045185 2017-03-26 15:20:04 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @hughhewitt The loss stings because it exposes the hollowness of the claim that Obamacare would be replaced with something better.
846001175925264387 2017-03-26 14:09:32 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @neeratanden Perhaps but @CoryBooker needs to fight to lower drug prices
846000340608733184 2017-03-26 14:06:13 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> Thank you to the wonderful @josephineslee @VoiceOfChicago @LyricOpera! #JoyOfMusichttps://twitter.com/josephineslee/status/845990570942083073
845338465000706048 2017-03-24 18:16:10 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @nytimes Isn't this the point at which, having failed to deliver votes, @SpeakerRyan should offer to resign?https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/845333174502744064
845296214665056256 2017-03-24 15:28:17 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @JGreenDC Not a proud moment for @GoldmanSachs
842887374296121344 2017-03-17 23:56:24 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> Brilliant idea. @dpatil Count me in to kickstart it.https://twitter.com/dpatil/status/842886755976015876

842741958200250369 2017-03-17 14:18:34 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @ron_fournier True that. Maybe someone should remind them of New Coke ...
842536432455639040 2017-03-16 00:41:53 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @NewYorker @michaelluo This won't be popular but it was hasty to dub Spicer racist on the basis of that video.
842104444452012039 2017-03-15 20:05:19 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @lpolgreen This will make you hungrier @foodandwine's latest. @niloumotamed has her family recipes.
842087047099756544 2017-03-15 18:56:11 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @nytopinion @SpeakerRyan emerges as the biggest loser ...wait, that would actually be the millions likely to lose coverage under his plan.
842085874275868672 2017-03-15 18:51:32 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> Bizarre times..@POTUS said to have leaked taxes while he accuses @maddow of fake news. #TrumpTaxReturns #idesOfMarch
841776094764273670 2017-03-14 22:20:35 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @AlexCKaufman Oh no!
841329827797966849 2017-03-13 16:47:16 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @TIME Why she did it is because she wanted 15 minutes of fame ... which you just gave her!
841291380156727296 2017-03-13 14:14:30 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @pamelacolloff @jakesilverstein Excited to see what you have for us..
841281526264430592 2017-03-13 13:35:20 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @PressSec @AnandWrites This is called haranguing, not asking questions.
841279123771269120 2017-03-13 13:25:47 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @SopanDeb Ouch! Change that grade to an A. The kid might read this. #goodquestion #futurereporter
841041555637055488 2017-03-12 21:41:47 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> Can we just be done with #daylightsavings? Has anyone quantified the benefit?
841009400101916672 2017-03-12 19:34:00 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @JeffreyToobin wait .., this isn't some mysterious undercover agent ploy?
840631229334618113 2017-03-11 18:31:17 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @DineshDSouza This has nothing to do with skin color or accent. Taking cheap shots @PreetBharara is silly.
839550962058551301 2017-03-08 18:58:42 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @rgay ...and luck, the hope that an editor out there falls in love with the writing...

837088157988503553 2017-03-01 23:52:23 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @jelani9 So refreshing to read your tweets! But come to Chicago and speak please before cutting back.
836979056402972672 2017-03-01 16:38:52 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @madversity Argh - sorry to hear this. You are such a great guy!

836708365506052096 2017-02-28 22:43:14 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @sunehra This is a lovely essay - much needed today. Keep writing, we need your voice.
836671628335534082 2017-02-28 20:17:15 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @ClaraJeffery Frankly, I doubt that @IvankaTrump would ever do this. Body language matters. This speaks volumes.
836592739944906752 2017-02-28 15:03:47 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @elisefoley @jonathanchait Body language matters. Perhaps we should be glad that you are reporters not diplomats. @jbouie
836284621771980802 2017-02-27 18:39:25 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @POTUS @davidaxelrod Sounds like our healthcare system - don't fund prevention but have the ER ready!

836082941298081792 2017-02-26 05:18:01 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @AnandWrites you called it!! Prescient.
836055032864862208 2017-02-26 03:27:07 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @KarenAttiah Cringeworthy. But then aren't we all living in a reality TV world now?!
836043775554252801 2017-02-26 02:42:23 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @rgay This is funny!
835926041692631040 2017-02-26 18:54:33 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @BreitbartNews @joelpollak Does he really use the word "dharma?"
835921466843623424 2017-02-26 18:36:23 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @realDonaldTrump supporters see excluding mainstream media as moving outside elite. He won't care if @NewYorker is not there. We will.
835878548955152385 2017-02-26 15:45:50 UTC <sujatha_shenoy> @timesofindia @madversity everyone ok?
