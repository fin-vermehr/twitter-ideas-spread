970280364148166657 2018-03-04 12:50:40 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @chantellecam Well done on your victory Chantelle. You are making great progress. Amazing to see so many female fighters at the moment including the best in @1LadyCecilia as well as yourself, @KatieTaylor, @Claressashields, @ @NicolaAdamsOBE, @MikaelaMayer1, @napoleonboxing and @CRUZ_IN_NYC.pic.twitter.com/wed7V1RxIw
970273662573129730 2018-03-04 12:24:02 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @YohannaPaulos Looks like a lot of people will attend. This should be interesting. Are there are plans as of yet for this year's sports day Yohanna?
970110479782653954 2018-03-03 01:35:36 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @ErrolSpenceJr @KPavlikPunchlin Great to connect with you again after over six years. I sparred Elie Seckbach, Brandon Rios and then your good self at Robert Garcia's Academy in February 2012. I handled one and got absolutely schooled by the other two. How have you been since sir and what do you do these days?pic.twitter.com/ar0vQ3anOp
970108263235809282 2018-03-03 01:26:48 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @ErrolSpenceJr @KPavlikPunchlin Is this Kelly Pavlik tweeting himself if you do not mind me asking?
970064085848117253 2018-03-03 22:31:15 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @jamacd2011 I am not so sure. I think deep down Khan knows natural welterweights like Brook are too strong for him. He has obviously been very reluctant over the years. Strange he took on Canelo but not Brook.
970062038797045765 2018-03-03 22:23:07 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @UltraTechSports @Kaiser_Koba There goes any chance of Khan agreeing to fight him now.
970061599829561345 2018-03-03 22:21:22 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @jamacd2011 No way Khan fights him now. What do you think sir?
970034570010808320 2018-03-03 20:33:58 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @wayne_cyrus Very succiently pointed out. You are correct regarding my attempted provacative intention. As you say the ring will determine this. Good evening sir.
969975569684234240 2018-03-03 16:39:31 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @wayne_cyrus Well it is very black and white in this situation. All the great heavyweight punchers have been 220 at most. Tyson, Joe Louis, Marciano, Liston, Foreman, Shavers and Lyle. Any of them would have knocked out Ortiz. His weight is no advantage. Unless I am proven wrong of course.
969909584646361089 2018-03-03 12:17:19 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @wayne_cyrus Well let us look into it. Does Ortiz's extra weight really do anything? It does not equal extra power. He was unable to knock out guys like Dave Allen and Malik Scott. Ironically Scott lasted the distance with Ortiz yet only one round with Wilder. (Albeit a suspicious ending.)
969710798007390208 2018-03-02 23:07:25 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @wayne_cyrus I see no reason why it will be a problem Wayne. The American is far more explosive, athletic and powerful than his Cuban opponent. Deontay will knock Luis out in what will be the best victory of his career thus far and make a serious impression.
969709592484765696 2018-03-02 23:02:37 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @BrunoMars What about the Moonwalk Mr Mars?
969662223072268289 2018-03-02 19:54:24 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @okayafrica @IlwadElman @araweeloabroad Well done on all your hard work Ms Elman. I wish you all the best in your future endeavours and look forward to hearing about it. Do you have any particular goals in mind for this year?
969650675264184320 2018-03-02 19:08:30 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @rootsoffight @MikeTyson Do you know if they have any Harry Greb, Sam Langford, Stanley Ketchel and Willie Pep designs Mr Tyson? I would like to see those if you do not mind me suggesting as such.
969638136019120128 2018-03-02 18:18:41 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @Emma4Change It is very saddening that so many people have died needlessly in the USA due to the lack of gun control. I wish you all the best in your campaign to change America for the better.
969582100591661056 2018-03-02 14:36:01 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @yazzwilson I currently work in the construction industry as a labourer to keep the bills paid while I study. I am going to start teaching this year though. I have not been to Africa since November 2016 so I also intend to travel this year.
969570397631938560 2018-03-02 13:49:31 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @yazzwilson Easily Thomas Sankara because he achieved so much in so little time. Second place goes to Colonel Gaddafi because of his vision for a united Africa and African gold dinar. Menelik II Queen Nzinga, Emperor Haile Selassie, Nelson Mandela and Malcolm X were all great thinkers also.
969565512471666688 2018-03-02 13:30:06 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @yazzwilson Hello my sister. Thank you for following me back. I noticed you are a Pan-Africanist like myself and I admire that. Are there any particular historical figures you admire? All the best with your campaign. I will take a look now.
969360965966942208 2018-03-01 23:57:18 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @GenzebeD Congratulations on your amazing victory Genzebe. I hope you now enjoy the benefits of victory. I would like to ask what are your future plans and how many languages do you speak? English and Amharic it seems?
965319076670210053 2018-02-18 20:16:17 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @Brandon_Rios1 Mr Rios my dear Mexican brother I wish you all the best with your future endeavours. I remember in February 2012 I travelled to Robert Garcia's gym in Oxnard and sparred you. It was an honour to have lasted a round with you and look forward to our next encounter. Good luck.pic.twitter.com/2FCfQaNoT2
964380603117219840 2018-02-15 06:07:07 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @CPJAfrica @RosieTapper1 What do you enjoy most about Hargeisa?
960210388724961281 2018-02-04 17:56:11 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @Lavernecox Hi Ms Cox. I hope you are well. I live in London, England and I am planning to travel to the USA this April. I have not been to America in six years now. I intend to stay for a month or so, buy a greyhound bus pass and travel around. Where should I go in California?pic.twitter.com/O5QqUloJky
958096312293122048 2018-01-29 21:55:36 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @FionaJ_A An amazing young man. I am very happy for him Ms Fee. Dare I say he is reminiscent of Michael Jackson? Both were truly exceptional at what they did.
957552340525035520 2018-01-28 09:54:03 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @AlJazeera_World @biniamb Hello Biniam. I hope you are well. Will you be attending the May Independence celebrations in Asmara this year?
957413334067896325 2018-01-27 00:41:41 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @biniamb Are you going as well Biniam? I will be at the May Independence celebrations in Asmara this year. It would be great to see you there.
955351033366089728 2018-01-22 08:06:50 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @ErrolSpenceJr @BadouJack @Blazed1988 I am sorry you disagree and I am sorry you feel the need to swear Mr Jamie A. Nevertheless I appreciate your response and I look forward to watching the future fights of all these men. I hope you also enjoy watching them sir.
954930567748964352 2018-01-20 04:16:03 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @ErrolSpenceJr @BadouJack Mr Jack is there any progress on a fight with Adonis Stevenson? Any interest in a DeGale rematch? You won the first so you can always win the second if you wish.
954755140682174464 2018-01-20 16:38:58 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @Irish_paddy @Mr__Morrison @LoveIrishBoxing I have deleted them because I was bored of them to tell you the truth. Never mind my dear Irishman; I can simply do it again as the song by the Staple Singers goes. I wonder who I should call out this time round.pic.twitter.com/6sjC8s10zg
954649872975695872 2018-01-20 09:40:40 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @Irish_paddy @LoveIrishBoxing @Mr__Morrison Yes I was there Mr Gunning. How very kind of you to have noticed sir. Truth be told anonymity greatly bores me. I am planning to go to the USA in April and start uploading videos again. Try and recapture my youth. I was last in the US six years ago in 2012. Age 22 then. 27 now.pic.twitter.com/jZnttd4Ehc

954440503323496448 2018-01-19 19:48:43 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @LoveIrishBoxing @Mr__Morrison @Irish_paddy Hello Mr Fegan. They must have said something to bother me. I do not bother people using a keyboard so I do not appreciate it when people do it to me. On a brighter note I am going to the USA in April. Has been about 6 years now. I wonder how many sparring beatings I can survive.
954135002094161920 2018-01-18 23:34:46 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @whoriskeydj Good evening Mr Whoriskey. I hope you are well. How is everything going sir?
953781066573209600 2018-01-17 00:08:21 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @MvslimInspires @HannaAli @MarketFiftyFour What do you consider to be particularly interesting and significant stories among the Somali diaspora Ms Ali? In particular are there any athletes you wish to mention? Mr @Mo_Farah has done extremely well. It would be great to see younger generations of Somalis inspired by him.pic.twitter.com/ioNoT3L1Q8
953611924486393856 2018-01-17 12:56:14 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @hawelti See you at this year's May 25 celebration Minister. It has been well over a year since we last met. Remember I visited you at your office to talk politics?pic.twitter.com/rnZkLJz47x
953350007062581248 2018-01-16 19:35:28 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @musebiihi Mr Bihi Abdi I hope you are well. When do you plan to arrive in Asmara, Eritrea? I respectfully suggest you plan it for May of this year to coincide with the annual May 25 Independence celebrations.
953284787057373184 2018-01-16 15:16:19 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @samsom_berhane I watched the interview Mr Berhane. A shame it was not in English however I tried my best. One of the first comments he made about recent falsehoods being the joke of 2018 were spot on. I look forward to attending this year's May 25 celebration in Asmara. See you there sir.pic.twitter.com/r9BC6oC4nW
952688991823900672 2018-01-14 23:48:50 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @MunroeBergdorf @sheffmmerc I appreciate your response sir or madam. The fact is she has no right whatsoever to be at all involved in the affairs of other countries whether symbolically or otherwise. It surprises me a great deal these countries allow her to do so.
952685309770203136 2018-01-14 23:34:12 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @MunroeBergdorf @sheffmmerc Well what gives the Queen a right to be involved in those countries at all? Ms Bergdorf is making great points.
952565329506590720 2018-01-14 15:37:27 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @Claressashields Sorry to read that Ms Shields. Find out her details and make an official complaint. It seems @united is the worst airlines in the world. One incident after another with these pathetic people. I am definitely not using them when I fly to the USA this summer.pic.twitter.com/YrzNxQFFJ3

951944086436634625 2018-01-12 22:28:51 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @elvisnchidera Amazing to hear about your story. What is your educational background and what have you studied?
950093302895915009 2018-01-07 19:54:29 UTC <ApolloJJJackson> @JamieMoore777 Mr Moore I would like to ask do you have any interest in Mr @RealCFrampton fighting against Mr @RigoElChacal305? Do you think the Cuban has anything left?
