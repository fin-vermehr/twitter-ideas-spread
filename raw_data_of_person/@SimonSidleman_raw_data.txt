970206163445919744 2018-03-03 07:55:49 UTC <SimonSidleman> @GuitarMoog I have a friend here in Belgium who remembers seeing Led Zeppelin at a festival in the late sixties. To be precise, he saw them sitting in a van looking glum. They couldnt play because they hadnt got the necessary paperwork...
969897691164676104 2018-03-03 11:30:04 UTC <SimonSidleman> @NickKehoe01 Indeed. They can also take the train to Belfast. And they can travel to the Republic by ferry too... or even on a cruise ship!
969719643391905792 2018-03-02 23:42:34 UTC <SimonSidleman> @spayrechaynge I see Im not alone in loving Sleater Kinney!
969698669837606912 2018-03-02 22:19:13 UTC <SimonSidleman> @Herring1967 Im both a Francophile and French but its not me (unfortunately for me but luckily for the rest of you)!
969694160906346496 2018-03-02 22:01:18 UTC <SimonSidleman> @Herring1967 Got the email and Im excited about all the March guests. 
969692845245386752 2018-03-02 21:56:04 UTC <SimonSidleman> @FrankThomas27 Groucho Marx? Those are my principles but, if you dont like them, I have others. was one of his too.
969184421113982976 2018-03-01 12:15:47 UTC <SimonSidleman> @campbellclaret She was probably trying for sarcasm!
969167660729683968 2018-03-01 11:09:11 UTC <SimonSidleman> I always knew I was young at heart: https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/28/uk-political-divide-openness-to-the-world-left-right-labour-conservatives-polling 
969148712240013312 2018-03-01 09:53:53 UTC <SimonSidleman> @TheNewEuropean Well Boris is the Wankerer from Ankara, obvs.
969148356730740737 2018-03-01 09:52:28 UTC <SimonSidleman> @MichaelPDeacon @DavidLammy @LYNNMILDNER What mandate? It was an advisory referendum. And what about all the people who were denied a vote?
968964072921354240 2018-02-28 21:40:12 UTC <SimonSidleman> @DanielJHannan Sorry, but the EU is trying to respect the will of the (Northern Irish) people. But I suppose its only the will of the (misinformed and gerrymandered) English people that counts...
968949265409208320 2018-02-28 20:41:21 UTC <SimonSidleman> @ChukaUmunna @wineexpert1968 Well thats more or less the status quo. The only difference is that currently you can move where you want but can be told to go away if you dont have a job or other means of subsistence, which is much less bureaucratic.
968947999433994240 2018-02-28 20:36:19 UTC <SimonSidleman> @MitchBenn They had to do the subtitles!
968947774204055552 2018-02-28 20:35:26 UTC <SimonSidleman> @Telegraph Brussels? If the so-called United Kingdom divides, the tories will be 100% responsible for it.
968930755631034369 2018-02-28 19:27:48 UTC <SimonSidleman> @MitchBenn Oh aye yeah?
968890483723382786 2018-02-28 16:47:47 UTC <SimonSidleman> @StevePeers Thats because HMG has said 1001 times that the British people decided to leave the EU. Ergo we expats are not British.
968875361445515264 2018-02-28 15:47:41 UTC <SimonSidleman> @Nigel_Farage And your point is? Those all seem very fine qualities to me!
968872534765600770 2018-02-28 15:36:27 UTC <SimonSidleman> @JolyonMaugham @JamesERothwell @Redeyes1878 Indeed!
968837652358234112 2018-02-28 13:17:51 UTC <SimonSidleman> @JolyonMaugham @JamesERothwell No responsible PM would have called an unnecessary referendum putting the interests of party before those of the country.
968826261412950017 2018-02-28 12:32:35 UTC <SimonSidleman> @faisalislam Not really, there's just a footnote referring to the European Council's guidelines of April 2017, which already state that, after Brexit, no agreement between the EU and the UK may apply to Gibraltar without Spain's agreement.
968611391568531456 2018-02-27 22:18:46 UTC <SimonSidleman> @AnnaJonesSky @KateAndrs @owenjbennett @Labour4EU @MarieAnnUK How can Brexit be the will of the people when they were fed such blatant lies? And dont get me started on the misuse of the term the British people!
968263629282992129 2018-02-26 23:16:53 UTC <SimonSidleman> @Herring1967 @GerryHutchins Predictably maybe? But who am I as a Frenchman to question your spelling!
968262631269257216 2018-02-26 23:12:55 UTC <SimonSidleman> @NadineDorries What? Have you looked at any recent statistics? The euro-zone is doing very well thank you very m!
968261889489850369 2018-02-26 23:09:58 UTC <SimonSidleman> @BrexitBin Im sorry to say British soft power peaked a long time ago... In the sixties and seventies... yes! But since? Bof !
968260201362149376 2018-02-26 23:03:16 UTC <SimonSidleman> @harikondabolu Thanks for the information but, much as I would love to go back to Hawaii, it takes, some organising for us Europeans!
968249406045786114 2018-02-26 22:20:22 UTC <SimonSidleman> @SODEMAction @NickKehoe01 Because (1) first past the post means that only labour can beat the tories, (2) I was a labour activist in my youth and (3) I hope that the customs union is just a first step towards sanity.
968247316758097921 2018-02-26 22:12:04 UTC <SimonSidleman> @ChukaUmunna Quite. If they had ever thought to consult those of us who work in the EU institutions, we could have told them that a long time ago...
968244693187383299 2018-02-26 22:01:38 UTC <SimonSidleman> @Jacob_Rees_Mogg What benefits? The only benefits will be for the rich! Va te faire foutre !
968244119758934016 2018-02-26 21:59:21 UTC <SimonSidleman> @DavidDavisMP What the fuck? Since when have the tories cared about workers rights? What opportunities?
968243123292909569 2018-02-26 21:55:24 UTC <SimonSidleman> @CarolineFlintMP And whats wrong with that? As one of the thousands of Brits and Labour Party members living in the other 27 EU Member States, Im stil waiting to be given the opportunity to express my opinion (other than on social media obviously)!
967887573258469376 2018-02-25 22:22:34 UTC <SimonSidleman> @DanielJHannan @Femi_Sorry The US standards are also much less strictly enforced. Indeed, thanks in part to the British and mad cow disease, the EU probably has the best regulated food industry in the world!
967877278939181056 2018-02-25 21:41:40 UTC <SimonSidleman> @frankfieldteam @Labour4EU Frank, you are right on a lot of things, but this time you are just talking total bollocks. I grew up on Merseyside in the seventies and early eighties. So I know what corrupt and bankrupt looks like!
967525324048207872 2018-02-24 22:23:07 UTC <SimonSidleman> @BrexitBin @__Forester__ Ive beenFrench since 1992. Before the Maastricht Treaty  lot of jobs and rights were denied to expats. But I got my first French passport only after the referendum!
967522769763172353 2018-02-24 22:12:58 UTC <SimonSidleman> @BrexitBin @Kat_Says_Stuff There is and was only ever one reason for Brexit: to try to keep the Conservative and Unionist party (aka the tories) together.
967520695587672064 2018-02-24 22:04:44 UTC <SimonSidleman> @DanielJHannan No. Tusk and Junker are doing their job: defending the EU. May is not. Her loyalty to the Tory party is her first and last priority.
967515364719562752 2018-02-24 21:43:33 UTC <SimonSidleman> @BrexitBin @Kat_Says_Stuff Well said. To add insult to injury Cameron later tried to block Junkers appointment (something he could easily have done had he not taken his party out of the EPP)!
967511965869408261 2018-02-24 21:30:02 UTC <SimonSidleman> @BrexitBin @nicktolhurst This is the first bit of good news about Brexit for me. I live in Belgium, have a U.K. driving licence and hate driving!
967510854022418432 2018-02-24 21:25:37 UTC <SimonSidleman> @BrexitBin @Kat_Says_Stuff Having left the EPP the tories had zero influence over this process.
967510402967003137 2018-02-24 21:23:50 UTC <SimonSidleman> @BrexitBin @Kat_Says_Stuff Quite. Before the last EP election the political groups agreed that they should each put forward a candidate for the next Commission President and that Member States should appoint the candidate from the group that got the most votes.
967507686651781121 2018-02-24 21:13:02 UTC <SimonSidleman> @BrexitBin @Kat_Says_Stuff Indeed. And not just in the European Parliament...
967140261943037953 2018-02-23 20:53:01 UTC <SimonSidleman> @AngieMeader @moonatmidnight I know it well. I am one of them!
967139531043557376 2018-02-23 20:50:07 UTC <SimonSidleman> @BrexitBin Yes, though some of those 65 million are lucky enough to be a national of one of the other 27 EU Member States and there are probably more of them than there are British expatriates living in those countries (though nobody really knows, since HMG doesnt give a fuck about them).
967028917637873664 2018-02-23 13:30:35 UTC <SimonSidleman> @campbellclaret Plus thinking that impartiality means always giving both sides of any argument and that arguments based on emotions are as valid as those based on facts.
966787389019557889 2018-02-22 21:30:50 UTC <SimonSidleman> @campbellclaret @mk1969 It doesnt arrive in Brussels until Saturday!
966459135377248256 2018-02-21 23:46:28 UTC <SimonSidleman> @JulietMEvans @BrexitBin @deeokelly1 You should! I listen to Radio 4 only for the comedy and WS for the news (and Radio France Internationale too).
966457942177386496 2018-02-21 23:41:43 UTC <SimonSidleman> @Labour4EU @nicktolhurst Indeed. The EU is the major player in most international fora. A post-Brexit UK would have no influence at all unless it, like Norway and Switzerland, worked closely with the EU and made a much larger individual financial contribution than its current share of the EUs...
966452985424379904 2018-02-21 23:22:02 UTC <SimonSidleman> @JulietMEvans @BrexitBin @deeokelly1 Quite, but at least the BBC World Service maintains the standards that the home service seems to have abandoned.
966449291312103424 2018-02-21 23:07:21 UTC <SimonSidleman> @Labour4EU @Medics4EU Indeed. The other great irony is that the European Commission seems certain to make proposals for the next Common Agricultural Policy period that are more or less exactly what the UK has been asking for for years!
966438896539140096 2018-02-21 22:26:03 UTC <SimonSidleman> @pmdfoster I think concerns is a bit of an understatement. Everybody who is anybody in Brussels knows that the UK governments commitments to the DUP and the EU27 are irreconcilable.
966429136704147456 2018-02-21 21:47:16 UTC <SimonSidleman> @william_coates Thanks. This is day two for me, but I am belated understanding both the attraction and the dangers!
966427896054247424 2018-02-21 21:42:20 UTC <SimonSidleman> @FLOTUS @IainRWhite @realDonaldTrump About fucking time.

BTW despite living in Belgium and being a Brit by birth, I get to vote for the French President and for the French MP for Benelux. Vive la dmocratie franaise!
966416840669958144 2018-02-21 20:58:24 UTC <SimonSidleman> @BrexitBin Painfully slow is generous!
966052846960566275 2018-02-20 20:52:01 UTC <SimonSidleman> @MitchBenn Well said! To think that I campaigned for her election in Dulwich over three decades ago...
966029540861599747 2018-02-20 19:19:25 UTC <SimonSidleman> @Femi_Sorry I quite agree. And dont forget us disenfranchised expatriates!
966006080651321344 2018-02-20 17:46:11 UTC <SimonSidleman> @MitchBenn Cool. And a new podcast too I hope!
970778559806656513 2018-03-05 21:50:19 UTC <SimonSidleman> @piersmorgan No thanks. I want to stay in Belgium. (Yes, I am a French manager and I was born in the UK, or should I say the Former United Kingdom of England, Wales Etc., aka FUK-EWE!)
970777628222345217 2018-03-05 21:46:37 UTC <SimonSidleman> @dontbrexitfixit @MrFurby Its worse than that. The EU is in the middle of reviewing its legislation on spirit drinks. In the past, the UK would have been defending Scottish and Northern Irish whisky. Today, they arent saying much and, when they do speak, nobodys listening anyway...
970773099758149635 2018-03-05 21:28:37 UTC <SimonSidleman> @Andrew_Adonis Based on a quick search online, I have the clear impression that the two borders are not at all comparable. There seem to be quite a few more roads crossing the border on the island of Ireland despite the fact that it is much, much shorter than the Canada-US border.
970389767065145345 2018-03-04 20:05:24 UTC <SimonSidleman> @piris_jc @mireille_pouget @Jennybidgood Ne veut pas et ne peut pas !

967510402967003137 2018-02-24 21:23:50 UTC <SimonSidleman> @BrexitBin @Kat_Says_Stuff Quite. Before the last EP election the political groups agreed that they should each put forward a candidate for the next Commission President and that Member States should appoint the candidate from the group that got the most votes.
967507686651781121 2018-02-24 21:13:02 UTC <SimonSidleman> @BrexitBin @Kat_Says_Stuff Indeed. And not just in the European Parliament...
967140261943037953 2018-02-23 20:53:01 UTC <SimonSidleman> @AngieMeader @moonatmidnight I know it well. I am one of them!
967139531043557376 2018-02-23 20:50:07 UTC <SimonSidleman> @BrexitBin Yes, though some of those 65 million are lucky enough to be a national of one of the other 27 EU Member States and there are probably more of them than there are British expatriates living in those countries (though nobody really knows, since HMG doesnt give a fuck about them).
967028917637873664 2018-02-23 13:30:35 UTC <SimonSidleman> @campbellclaret Plus thinking that impartiality means always giving both sides of any argument and that arguments based on emotions are as valid as those based on facts.
966787389019557889 2018-02-22 21:30:50 UTC <SimonSidleman> @campbellclaret @mk1969 It doesnt arrive in Brussels until Saturday!
966459135377248256 2018-02-21 23:46:28 UTC <SimonSidleman> @JulietMEvans @BrexitBin @deeokelly1 You should! I listen to Radio 4 only for the comedy and WS for the news (and Radio France Internationale too).
966457942177386496 2018-02-21 23:41:43 UTC <SimonSidleman> @Labour4EU @nicktolhurst Indeed. The EU is the major player in most international fora. A post-Brexit UK would have no influence at all unless it, like Norway and Switzerland, worked closely with the EU and made a much larger individual financial contribution than its current share of the EUs...
966452985424379904 2018-02-21 23:22:02 UTC <SimonSidleman> @JulietMEvans @BrexitBin @deeokelly1 Quite, but at least the BBC World Service maintains the standards that the home service seems to have abandoned.
966449291312103424 2018-02-21 23:07:21 UTC <SimonSidleman> @Labour4EU @Medics4EU Indeed. The other great irony is that the European Commission seems certain to make proposals for the next Common Agricultural Policy period that are more or less exactly what the UK has been asking for for years!
966438896539140096 2018-02-21 22:26:03 UTC <SimonSidleman> @pmdfoster I think concerns is a bit of an understatement. Everybody who is anybody in Brussels knows that the UK governments commitments to the DUP and the EU27 are irreconcilable.
966429136704147456 2018-02-21 21:47:16 UTC <SimonSidleman> @william_coates Thanks. This is day two for me, but I am belated understanding both the attraction and the dangers!
966427896054247424 2018-02-21 21:42:20 UTC <SimonSidleman> @FLOTUS @IainRWhite @realDonaldTrump About fucking time.
966421801915035648 2018-02-21 21:18:07 UTC <SimonSidleman> @UKLabour @laboursinglemkt @jeremycorbyn @ayup_mi_duck @WritersFrock @billybragg @TheStephenRalph @abcpoppins @MitchBenn @back_fights Im not sure that Ill ever get to vote in the UK again but, if I do, it will never be for a Brexiteer!  BTW despite living in Belgium and being a Brit by birth, I get to vote for the French President and for the French MP for Benelux. Vive la dmocratie franaise!
966416840669958144 2018-02-21 20:58:24 UTC <SimonSidleman> @BrexitBin Painfully slow is generous!
966052846960566275 2018-02-20 20:52:01 UTC <SimonSidleman> @MitchBenn Well said! To think that I campaigned for her election in Dulwich over three decades ago...
966029540861599747 2018-02-20 19:19:25 UTC <SimonSidleman> @Femi_Sorry I quite agree. And dont forget us disenfranchised expatriates!
966006080651321344 2018-02-20 17:46:11 UTC <SimonSidleman> @MitchBenn Cool. And a new podcast too I hope!
