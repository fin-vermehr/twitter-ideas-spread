Maybe a few years ago but now he don't got legs underneath him. Booker was an offensive rebounding machine something we needed. He at least had energy
968943898834894848 2018-02-28 20:20:02 UTC <realtheprocess> @76ersForever @Angelo_Masso03 And we gave up a 2nd rounder for Booker smh
968943824608342017 2018-02-28 20:19:44 UTC <realtheprocess> @76ersForever @Angelo_Masso03 Yeah I just wish it was Amir

967843381618577408 2018-02-25 19:26:58 UTC <realtheprocess> @shamus_clancy @TheSmartyJones No it's completely different. Winning a championship with Lebron would be like bringing Tom Brady to the Eagles next year and winning with him.

967554736038834177 2018-02-24 00:20:00 UTC <realtheprocess> @shamus_clancy @sethlipshutz Yeah especially the ones who are convinced that Lebron is gonna be a Sixer
967535077331791872 2018-02-24 23:01:53 UTC <realtheprocess> @shamus_clancy @kvanhorn87 I understand and agree with you on that point
967533645446766607 2018-02-24 22:56:11 UTC <realtheprocess> @dansballofwax @HomeoftheThrill @shamus_clancy yeah getting forced out of your home is way more horrible than not being able to afford going to NBA games anymore but it's an analogy not meant to be taken literally
967522878550958080 2018-02-24 22:13:24 UTC <realtheprocess> Joel Embiid is the best shooter in the world  #ORLvsPHI
967522516339130368 2018-02-24 22:11:58 UTC <realtheprocess> @dansballofwax @HomeoftheThrill @shamus_clancy Here's a better analogy: it's like not wanting Amazon HQ to come to Philly. It would price all us original Philadelphians out and turn this city into something it never was
967521841727320064 2018-02-24 22:09:17 UTC <realtheprocess> @shamus_clancy There's a difference between bandwagon jumpers within the region who are fair weather fans and bandwagon jumpers who only follow the best player in the game. I understand why you like watching the best player in the game. So do I, but I just prefer watching him play for the Cavs
967521173847396352 2018-02-24 22:06:38 UTC <realtheprocess> @shamus_clancy I've respected you and your takes and never came at you personally. I respectfully disagree with a lot of sixers fans but I still feel a brotherhood with them.
967520900269690885 2018-02-24 22:05:32 UTC <realtheprocess> @shamus_clancy Of course I would be happy about a championship with Lebron. I would lament all the annoying ass Lebron fans joining in but Id be happy. I think yous are missing the point is all

967503237942272007 2018-02-24 20:55:21 UTC <realtheprocess> @hardROClife @FINK_BOMB @_magowan Good for the Heat. I don't want to be another footnote in Lebron's career and then have him destroy our organization
967502836421550081 2018-02-24 20:53:46 UTC <realtheprocess> @shamus_clancy @dansballofwax I remember. I just want anyone but LBJ.
967502749209374721 2018-02-24 20:53:25 UTC <realtheprocess> @Eagles_Dan88 Yeah any FA except Lebron is fine thanks
967500518431100928 2018-02-24 20:44:33 UTC <realtheprocess> Apparently I'm the only sixers fan who doesn't want Lebron to join us... whatever
967500298888597509 2018-02-24 20:43:41 UTC <realtheprocess> @FINK_BOMB I'd rather be an idiot than a sellout

967498732114796545 2018-02-24 20:37:27 UTC <realtheprocess> @hardROClife @FINK_BOMB I didn't live through the process for Lebron to take all the credit.
967496230157930496 2018-02-24 20:27:31 UTC <realtheprocess> @PhilaBCoulter @shamus_clancy @_magowan Where've you been? No one believed in Embiid playing healthily. No one believed Ben Simmons was legit without a jumper. No one believes Fultz ever gets his mojo back. Dario is never coming over etc etc
967491083511967744 2018-02-24 20:07:04 UTC <realtheprocess> @hardROClife Anyone who wants Lebron is a fraud. I'll berate you and all the Lebron lovers out on Broad Street
967490529155043331 2018-02-24 20:04:51 UTC <realtheprocess> @PhilaBCoulter @shamus_clancy Our identity as Philadelphians is at stake here
967490401966936066 2018-02-24 20:04:21 UTC <realtheprocess> @PhilaBCoulter @shamus_clancy Btw how are you gonna be proud of the under dog South Philly mentality and then at the same time say hey give us the best player in the world so we can win a championship! Nah. Give us the hard working young guys who no one ever believed in
967488968756523010 2018-02-24 19:58:39 UTC <realtheprocess> @PhilaBCoulter @shamus_clancy I meant to say a championship level team without Lebron's tickets would still be cheaper than a nonchampionship team with Lebron
967488596684038145 2018-02-24 19:57:11 UTC <realtheprocess> @PhilaBCoulter @shamus_clancy I'm fine with bandwagon jumpers without Lebron. Lebron bandwagon fans are completely different tho. A whole different level. And a championship level team with Lebron would have tickets still cheaper than a team with Lebron.
967487629695619072 2018-02-24 19:53:20 UTC <realtheprocess> @shamus_clancy @PhilaBCoulter It would cost at least $100 every game for nosebleeds
967485434820530176 2018-02-24 19:44:37 UTC <realtheprocess> @shamus_clancy Hahaha yeah I'd be fine with a time traveling Joe Montana too but gotta disagree with you on Bron. I understand where you're coming from but it would ruin being a sixers fan we wouldn't be able to afford going to games anymore
967484138809946112 2018-02-24 19:39:28 UTC <realtheprocess> @shamus_clancy That's not equivalent. Foles is the opposite of Lebron
967483845594533888 2018-02-24 19:38:18 UTC <realtheprocess> @shamus_clancy A lot of people in Philly give a fuck... it would be selling your soul at the crossroads
967483261059502082 2018-02-24 19:35:59 UTC <realtheprocess> @shamus_clancy If Lebron came and we won it would all be attributed to him. We can win without Lebron. Give us literally anyone else. PG13
