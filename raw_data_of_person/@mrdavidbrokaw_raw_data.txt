968515849849012225 2018-02-27 15:59:07 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @PoliticsOTM Good riddance. We need more parties so people aren't stuck with the lesser of 2 evils every single election.
966686936705503233 2018-02-22 14:51:40 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump If we won't pay teachers enough to live on, why the hell would they expect to pull double duty as armed guards?   If 6 highly trained Secret Service agents couldn't stop Reagan from taking a bullet, how much do you think some middle school bio teacher is going to do?  Dumb idea!
964474457887793153 2018-02-16 12:20:04 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @taylorredeker Lacy snuck one into our freezer as a surprise!

961281318230347777 2018-02-07 16:51:40 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SpeakerRyan A one time bonus does not materially change someone's quality of life the way a raise (or permanent slashing of your tax rate from 35% to 21%) does. The businesses are making a show of 'sharing' the wealth, but their tax cuts will be there next year. Will the bonuses? Probably no
960833926645321728 2018-02-06 11:13:54 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @MattB206 Happy birthday dude!

958300959389741058 2018-01-30 11:28:47 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> Teacher: Did everyone do their reading assignment for science class?  Trump: Yeah, totally, believe me. Those polars was tremendous with records and did all the things, let me just tell you. Honestly thoug, the important thing is cleanliness. Bigly.https://twitter.com/DanielHewittITV/status/957748071898677255
957661352641859584 2018-01-28 17:07:13 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @nytimes @FederalistSC So I'm just asking, how long should we have stayed in Iraq? How many billions of dollars should we have wasted, how many lives should we have lost? At what point in the future would the vacuum we created have been filled?
957281041730932736 2018-01-27 15:56:00 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @PoliticsOTM Like she's going to let anyone else touch her Wall St. donations... 
954012132332462080 2018-01-18 15:26:31 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @PoliticsOTM Woah woah woah, for all you know all of the important people whose opinions matter are in the other 10%. The Citizens United decision clearly states that how much money you have determines how much political speech you can make.

And that we spend more than the next 15 largest militaries COMBINED?? Of course you do, you just think we're not paying attention. Go play with your bed burger, Donnie, and STFU.
951648193275711488 2018-01-11 02:53:04 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @StephenKing Also they are statistically happier

947645544742244352 2017-12-31 01:47:58 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @KyleKulinski I'm right behind you, man. Pretty sure my wife is planning a funeral themed party this year.
946813254684246018 2017-12-29 18:40:45 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @MattB206 I voted NYC, because it's closest to my dad of all the options. But in truth I'd never live somewhere with more than 50,000 people.

944355633234632704 2017-12-22 23:55:02 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> Now that the #GOPTaxScam has passed I can officially say: welcome to Kansas everyone. Get ready for revenue shortfalls, anemic growth, budget cuts, and lots of talk about 'reforming' services you depend on but never even considering rolling back the tax cuts for the wealthy.
943647794862182400 2017-12-20 01:02:21 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump @GOP Someone call @MerriamWebster they're trying to redefine 'biggest' to mean 'only.'
942204861772386304 2017-12-16 01:28:39 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @YouTube @PoliticsOTM Guess we'll have to just start calling it "reality based" or "not bullshit"

941866473944961024 2017-12-15 03:04:01 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @POTUS @PressSec How bout that equal pay bill the GOP has been championing for years... Oh wait they're against that. Or how they support Planned Par... Oh wait. Or how bout how they know that more than half of min wage earners are women and want to raise the.. Oh wait are you just full of shit?
941719881032065025 2017-12-15 17:21:30 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @JerryMoran Actually the time was in September, but I'll give you partial credit for being a rare GOP member who even bothers.
941716261993623553 2017-12-15 17:07:07 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @FBI @WhiteHouse @VP Woah, VEEP you need to get on message. Per your boss, the FBI is a group of crazed Shillary fanatics that are conducting a witch hunt like something out of Salem, drowning in failure and political bias with a weakened reputation and SAD leadership.   Of course, he could be wrong.
941474490604802048 2017-12-14 01:06:24 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @GOP @realDonaldTrump You also promised to protect Social Security and Medicare, but looks like you forgot to tell Congress.
941002666209095681 2017-12-13 17:51:33 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump Or, hear me out, it proved that even your base is starting to smell the pungent, fetid, fecal swamp stench wafting out of your administration and the GOP held Congress. And they're starting to get sick of it.
940268900322816001 2017-12-11 17:15:49 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @TIME Because we ran out of room for jails? Or because he wants to build a golf course?
940268528384528387 2017-12-11 17:14:21 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @PoliticsOTM When you have a particularly nasty candidate, i feel like there's more likely to be people who poll against him but vote for him. It's easier to do shitty things anonymously, like vote for Moore, than to tell a stranger that you're going to support him.
939481335424602112 2017-12-09 13:06:19 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @KyleKulinski Please do a segment/share your thoughts on the tax bill treating tuition vouchers as income and effectively pricing grad students out of college.
938763686893834240 2017-12-07 13:34:38 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @PressSec @ChuckGrassley Literally the whole world opposed this move except Zionist Christian Americans and the odious Likud party in Israel.
938576577822109696 2017-12-06 01:11:08 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @kenklippenstein is my best new follow of the year.
938552114850213888 2017-12-06 23:33:56 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @JeffFlake Yeah, remind me. Did you not just vote for the Senate Tax 'Reform' package that independent analysis confirmed was primarily for the rich and less than a quarter of American citizens supported? You have a narrow and poor definition of Country.
937308613340745728 2017-12-03 13:12:42 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @RoKhanna And we need to be held accountable for our role in it.
936924786390859776 2017-12-02 11:47:30 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @JerryMoran Key consideration for the law: our tax cuts expire, so they can get rid of them and massively slash social safety net programs when this explodes the deficit. But the corporate cuts are permanent. So yeah, I hope every one bought lube, this law is coming in dry.
936066036033519617 2017-11-29 02:55:08 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump I will personally benefit from this plan. I still oppose it. I am morally opposed to taking money from programs that protect vulnerable citizens and pocketing it. Your bill, like your presidency, is trash. Please resign and fade into obscurity.
935730275828543489 2017-11-28 04:40:57 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump 'The Consumer' is, of course, a comic book style villain spawned from the fine print of big bank and payday loan contracts designed to consume you.
935277441064558594 2017-11-27 22:41:33 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump Can't include Fox, they'd break the scale. They've been a GOP propaganda arm since Saint Ronnie repealed the Fairness Doctrine.

934049511152013317 2017-11-24 13:22:11 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump Didn't you just increase troop levels and make plans to stay indefinitely in Afghanistan? Didn't you massively ramp up our involvement in Syria? Since when has your goal been to get out of the Middle East? Why did you need $80b more for military if we're trying to stop fighting?
934047643831021569 2017-11-24 13:14:46 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @BarryStanton64 When I go to London I want to see people who live, work, vacation, shop, or play there, not stodgy fucking bigots. Looks like neither of us get what we want, eh old chap?
933719231601967104 2017-11-23 15:29:47 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @PoliticsOTM Spending some time with my Trump-voter in-laws this Thanksgiving. Just gotta grin and bear it for a few hours! 
933176573729148928 2017-11-21 03:33:27 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @WSJopinion @AjitPaiFCC You are public enemy number 1 buddy. Wait, Trump. And Moore. And Sessions. And McConnell, Hatch, Ryan... You sir are public enemy #62. But if you do this, the backlash will thrust you up the list. Are you ready to be universally hated? To be reviled? You will be.
932405761329655810 2017-11-19 00:30:31 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump You should have left US citizens in a Chinese jail because your ego doesn't feel sufficiently stroked? How bout you go in the bathroom and stroke it yourself, and retract this disgusting statement. You shame your nation every day and will be villified in history books for years.
932403815114067969 2017-11-19 00:22:47 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump Interesting that the Senator that doesn't need to bow to the donors next election is a no on your tax plan. Is there a connection between the plan and wealthy donors? Or is that a coincidence? Btw, you have historically low polls. Like, pitifully low.
931518871378460672 2017-11-17 13:46:20 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> Anyone who condemns Franken but excuses Moore and Trump are hypocrites who need to step back and look at what's more important to them, the GOP or the USA. I condemn all sexual assault and harassment, regardless of the perpetrator, and that is the ONLY acceptable stance to take.
931502726290296832 2017-11-17 12:42:11 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @PoliticsOTM Ummm... how is this news? Who the hell else would be taking the lead on this? Italy? Peru? The Syrian govt is the only appropriate body to undertake this, even if we don't like what side of the chess board he's on.

930791800620666880 2017-11-15 13:37:13 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> Meanwhile, America is rolling back protections for students that get suckered in by for-profit predatory colleges, saddling them with massive undischargable debt.

930788140968751105 2017-11-15 13:22:40 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @PoliticsOTM Looks like a staffer finally got him to delete it. Wonder if he bothers to try again, I mean he didn't win Cali. No president has ever been treated more unfairly by California, believe me.
930786637482745856 2017-11-15 13:16:42 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @TIME The fabric of our nation is torn. We are all doomed to eternal hellfire. No hope remains for our souls. /sarcasm   You want a real scandal? We're funding, arming, support,  and backing Saudi Arabia's massacre in Yemen. Talk about that. Get people outraged!
930644213590646784 2017-11-14 03:50:45 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> Jeff Sessions: I don't remember having that conversation, or what I said during it, but I know for certain that the words I don't remember saying were definitely true.

930094068956360704 2017-11-13 15:24:41 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> Adorable that @seanhannity fans want to #BoycottKeurig because they feel triggered by @Keurig microaggression of choosing how to spend their own advertising $. So many snowflakes that we may need to cancel school.
929548802100523008 2017-11-11 03:17:59 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> Really sad that the 70yo leader of a small segment of one nation in the free world was so hurt by being called #old that he had to throw a Twitter hissy fit. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #old #thinskin #resign

The only way to stop a sex crime is a good guy with a penis. You can't regulate penises, it violates the 99th Amendment, which I've never read.  *end sarcasm*

926185769278017537 2017-11-02 20:34:29 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @peterdaou Well there was burying debates, getting questions beforehand, bogus accusations of sexism, superdelegates, closed primaries, not  very much
925886284786274304 2017-11-01 00:44:27 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @RoKhanna Honestly shocked it's only 74%
925515333833842688 2017-10-31 00:10:25 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenPatRoberts Further empowering and enriching the oligarchy scares me more than taxes, PattyCakes. Especially by cutting programs regular citizens need.
925380047850082304 2017-10-31 15:12:50 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenateRPC @SenateGOP @GOPSenFinance @SenPatRoberts Yeah! Giving tax cuts to the rich will fix it PattyCakes. Not, you know... making the minimum wage a living wage again... that's libtarded.
925177180279189504 2017-10-30 01:46:43 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenPatRoberts And repealing the estate tax (only affects top 0.2%) and AMT (high income) will save us all! *sarcasm overload*
924448340053504000 2017-10-28 01:30:34 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenFranken The fact that this even needs to be said is an absolute tragedy.
924423007229050880 2017-10-28 23:49:54 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump Released on time, you are fake news. Stupid thing to waste time lying about. Put phone down, be the president. Perpetual disappointment.

923232972270129152 2017-10-25 17:01:08 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenateMajLdr I seem to remember you teaching that class last year, Professor Turtle. Are you really mad the Dems learned from it? #GOPGTFO
922901499688161280 2017-10-24 19:03:58 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @PoliticsOTM Sad, but appropriate, that US healthcare system is used as a boogeyman in other countries. I sure hope you guys win this fight.
922830282763489282 2017-10-24 14:20:59 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @nowthisnews Rep. Green giving a master class in holding incompetence and apathy to account. That was beautiful.
922550209577701376 2017-10-23 19:48:04 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenateMajLdr Reminder, the US Senate has been lead by a turtle for nearly 3 years. It's time to change that. It's time for #GOPGTFO
922547903020851201 2017-10-23 19:38:54 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @Amy_Siskind Well, odds are he's going to shill for the @POTUS and use his 'moral authority' to drown out opposing views.
922416112217853952 2017-10-23 10:55:13 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @PressSec Making a flawed assumption that that money would 'trickle down.' What if they invest in automation or a new factory overseas instead?
922412913104707584 2017-10-23 10:42:30 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @PressSec Well we will probably spend it all on health insurance after @POTUS destabilizes the insurance market and premiums skyrocket.
921754314481262592 2017-10-21 15:05:28 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump Because it just means the rich are getting richer, and we don't need the news to tell us that, everyone already knows.
920997103807205376 2017-10-19 12:56:35 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @washingtonpost You know people can look stuff up right? You can't just make stuff up and expect us to just accept it. What law is being broken, you dotard?
920996546249920513 2017-10-19 12:54:22 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump I'm so glad our @POTUS  has time to watch daytime TV. It truly is a sign of how peaceful and calm the world is.
920606544382832640 2017-10-18 11:04:38 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump @GOP It's almost like the growth is an artificial bubble that will burst and crash again.

918994417968668673 2017-10-13 00:18:37 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @POTUS @GOP Well he seems to be under the impression that there's such a thing as 'Our god.' Pretty sure there are >1 religions in USA. Idk if he knows.
918436754235035648 2017-10-12 11:22:40 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump How about just until they finish the job?
916510718425526272 2017-10-06 03:49:17 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> Insurance is compensation, and your boss shouldn't get to decide what is bought with it any more than they decide how to spend your check.
915742767418105857 2017-10-04 00:57:44 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @PhilipNims Insta-boner. 
914647039094480896 2017-10-01 00:23:42 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump @SLandinSoCal Says who? Seriously, on what authority do you decide the motivation for other people's LEGAL actions? SCOTUS rulings on this issue are clear
914314411057324033 2017-09-30 02:21:57 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @PoliticsOTM The "anti HRC = sexism" trope is so fucking aggravating. I had many problems with her, none of them were her fuck parts.
913534162027429888 2017-09-28 22:41:31 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @GOP Fewer than 6 in 1,000 farmers are affected by estate tax. There are special exemptions in the law specifically for farmers. You are lying.
912761496068923394 2017-09-26 19:31:13 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @MythicalRedFox @KyleKulinski @nekoagius There's only one team, the donors. No one else has a voice in govt. We've been convinced to fight one another on a mostly imaginary line.
912490668391575552 2017-09-25 01:35:03 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @GOP Wait since when is bribery illegal here? Someone better tell the lobbyists. And Congress.
912489527226269697 2017-09-25 01:30:31 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @MythicalRedFox @KyleKulinski @nekoagius Oh please don't put the idea of her running again into the world. I don't care what team has the Senate/House. I care what bills they pass.
912488908079927296 2017-09-25 01:28:03 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @PoliticsOTM Great video, I like your unique perspective.
912487647637057536 2017-09-25 01:23:03 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump Dissent is patriotism. Making us a better nation should be applauded, not shit on. What is wrong with you? You're the AntiPresident. Resign.
912487097843556353 2017-09-25 01:20:51 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @TomiLahren Wanting to make USA better isn't hatred of USA. Shoving your head in sand & leaving things broken isn't patriotic. He loves USA more than u.
912485912151511041 2017-09-25 01:16:09 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @MythicalRedFox @KyleKulinski @nekoagius Accepting that the bias isn't always unconscious. Realizing that crime rate v incarceration rate by race is staggeringly bad. Fixing it.
912409540204924928 2017-09-25 20:12:40 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @GOP Agreed. Let's get rid of pay-for-care and guarantee healthcare to all Americans! Ya know, like UK, France, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Germany
912408384015609857 2017-09-25 20:08:05 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> .@realDonaldTrump I can do whatever I want to during the anthem, it's a FREE country. Read the damn constitution, it's in Amendment 1.
911722863140511744 2017-09-23 22:44:04 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump Well we did break the terms of the nuclear deal, so... what did we expect to happen?
911569375815192577 2017-09-23 12:34:09 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> GOP 2019:  Other countries have hcare. Planes exist. Access to hcare achieved.  Checkmate libtards.
911360204536762368 2017-09-22 22:42:59 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @thehill H*ck yes we do. Every other modern country has figured this out decades ago. We're a global embarrassment on this issue.
911359490221625345 2017-09-22 22:40:09 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> .@SenPatRoberts poorly crafted Thelma&Louise metaphors are not healthcare policy. #MedicareForAll is coming, get on right side of history.
911358623342788608 2017-09-22 22:36:42 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> .@SenPatRoberts nice @voxdotcom interview. Way to embarrass KS and fail to answer ? at the same time. #Trumpcare is indefensible, resign plz
910296342366388224 2017-09-19 00:15:35 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @PoliticsOTM Worth the sub, insightful and entertaining. My $0.02
909184197834739712 2017-09-16 22:36:19 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @GOP Spend that money rebuilding bridges and dams instead, you backwards-priority-having twits.
908086685929537536 2017-09-13 21:55:12 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenPatRoberts Do you remember healthcare before ACA? Or are you just hoping we don't?
908072047246442502 2017-09-13 20:57:01 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SpeakerRyan Agree! Corporations have been paying an ever shrinking share of the tax burden for years, hurting middle class families. Time to fix!
908070833490448392 2017-09-13 20:52:12 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenateMajLdr Yep. Market solutions failed, time to step in and provide care as a right. We already do this for kids & seniors. Not new or radical, Mitch.
908068705896222721 2017-09-13 20:43:45 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenSanders @SenPatRoberts Single payer is a real solution, Senator. In fact, it's the one that all other modern nations have implemented. Do you think we are stupid?
907911454803853312 2017-09-13 10:18:53 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @billmaher If every Green voter had switched to HRC, we'd still have Pres Derp. Yell @ the 9% of registered dems that voted Derp/Theocrat 2016.
903972362776928257 2017-09-02 13:26:20 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenateGOP And the more they spend the more they would be taxed. A poor man spends every penny he has, do you think Buffet or Gates do? I'd guess no.
903935735002169344 2017-09-02 11:00:48 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> 1. Why the h*ck is Trump a news source, most of his statements are lies? 2. I adore that he is ranked badly on the list, he deserves to be.https://twitter.com/MarketWatch/status/903877899635134464
903933072931991552 2017-09-02 10:50:13 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenateGOP A fed sales tax is vigorously regressive. The bulk of the tax burden would shift even further onto the poor and middle class.
903932213720469504 2017-09-02 10:46:48 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenateGOP The word 'reform' implies you'll leave it better than you found it. Given your failures on healthcare, why should we trust you on taxes?
903630813761335297 2017-09-01 14:49:09 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @beatleloveralex @maureenjohnson Who cares about summer or autumn? Winter is coming!

902537311484878848 2017-08-29 14:23:58 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @HouseGOP Or you could... not allow them to do that? Instead of slashing their taxes, rolling over, and submitting to them like little bitches??
902116449279508480 2017-08-28 10:31:36 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump How about you pay for your own golf through 'reimbursement/other.' Oh wait that doesn't mean anything! Don't take my $ to fund your racism.
901793431160315904 2017-08-27 13:08:03 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump Implying your base can read. If they could, they wouldn't get all info from Alex Jones and Fox 'News.' Don't you feel like retiring yet?
901414811229204480 2017-08-26 12:03:33 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump This is why people call you a racist! You say racist things, do racist things, and use your pres authority to pardon racist monsters. DIAF.

895387141081112576 2017-08-09 20:51:44 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump Because only a small fraction of the citizenry actually wants a full repeal, and the 'replacement' was a bunch of cobbled-together nonsense?
894704918732222466 2017-08-07 23:40:50 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @MarketWatch Because they have no choice? Wages have been stagnant since before we were born and upward mobility is at a low. Debt is how you live now.
892753347438149632 2017-08-02 14:25:59 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump Now go pay tribute to the thousands of transgender VETS you insulted, and the thousands still serving that you threatened. Disgraceful man.
892499747851960321 2017-08-01 21:38:16 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @KyleKulinski Sign me up for the cult. I look good in robes and will support all of those things forever and ever.
892397262504169472 2017-08-01 14:51:01 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SpeakerRyan Tell ya what Paulie, you pay for the wall and you can have it. Just don't touch tax dollars for this nonsense.
889931014428086272 2017-07-25 19:31:02 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @KyleKulinski Idk Kyle, I think even terrible people deserve healthcare.
889930698861273089 2017-07-25 19:29:47 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenJohnMcCain @realDonaldTrump Except the ones you're taking it away from? 22+ million of them? Plus the ones that didn't get coverage under ACA? Maybe think b4 u tweet?
889835692062384128 2017-07-25 13:12:15 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> Even with brain cancer, @SenJohnMcCain is brave enough to go to DC and help @GOP take healthcare away from millions. Truly inspiring.
888732390390214657 2017-07-22 12:08:08 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @YouTube @majorityfm Someone skipped the parts of the bible encouraging, prescribing, demanding, and approving slavery. Gotta learn your source material bro.
887486022011031552 2017-07-18 01:35:30 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @nytimes @SenateGOP Obama's nominees were far less controversial. If 45 wants confirmations, he can nominate reasonable, qualified candidates w/out baggage.
887290624390647808 2017-07-18 12:39:04 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> " ..until Pres. Trump intervened." Like his racist ban wasn't why they were barred in the first place? Nice reporting, @WSJ , great job.

884557348018237440 2017-07-10 23:38:00 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @POTUS @GOP How many of the other guys nominated grifters with huge conflicts of interest? The apptmnts are taking longer bc of the specific nominees.

881509978149924864 2017-07-02 13:48:51 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump It is not ok for the POTUS to treat media as an enemy of the state. We need the media to keep the govt in check, and he is undermining. Sad!
881304007804846080 2017-07-01 00:10:23 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump Congratulations, everyone. We put 4chan in the White House.

879515868283232258 2017-06-26 01:44:58 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SpeakerRyan Religion has no place in education, much like bonfires have no place in oil wells and GOP has no place in government.

861914919402340352 2017-05-09 12:05:05 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @CNN @lonniefrye65 Yeah... he didn't even try to invade Iraq or anything! Carter sure did suck. No economic collapses under his watch. Man what a loser.
856695480486703104 2017-04-24 02:24:53 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @StephenAtHome Gonna send them to @KyleKulinski instead. Either they'll have a heart attack or they'll learn something.
856695200365912064 2017-04-24 02:23:47 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @CNN The idiots that voted for him knew that before voting. He doesn't get a pass, we are not lowering the bar, he doesn't get partial credit.
856483565520998401 2017-04-24 12:22:49 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @washingtonpost Everyone's tense waiting for your boss to start WWIII or for your goofy ass to start locking ppl up for stupid shit. Bad time for jokes, ass

853380807246970880 2017-04-15 22:53:34 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> As a progressive living in deep red Dumbfuckistan, this is really important. The DNC auto-concedes in my state, and it makes me crazy.https://twitter.com/justicedems/status/853367483134349312
853089114383687681 2017-04-14 03:34:29 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @MarketWatch Now show us a chart that proves sufficient quantities of unicorn blood will make you immortal, because that's just as realistic.
852653006332076032 2017-04-13 22:41:32 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @PhilipNims I find it's way easier to give blood when it isn't yours. Maybe that will help her?

852271159001436160 2017-04-12 21:24:13 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump @KansasGOP @mike_pence @aleeyun_nvaazun I find the Jesus myth disturbing. God creates flawed race, punishes them for being flawed, offers them salvation by... murdering his kid?
852267927139217408 2017-04-12 21:11:22 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump @KansasGOP @mike_pence @aleeyun_nvaazun This is not a Christian theocracy, so whether or not we still use a book written by bronze age goat herders to determine our morals is moot.

852102253532119044 2017-04-12 10:13:03 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @MarketWatch I bet a lot of things are about half what Trump claims they are. His crowd sizes, his IQ, his...
852102023839449088 2017-04-12 10:12:08 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @CNN It's ok to call him a liar. Or a sack of bullshit held together with moldy scrotum.
852099983079878656 2017-04-12 10:04:01 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @KansasGOP By duping Kansans into voting against their own needs. Brownback as good as committed murder in denying Kancare to the vulnerable and needy.
851950910146306048 2017-04-11 00:11:40 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @POTUS @GOPChairwoman @KansasGOP @FoxNews Ha that's cute, a Republican governing. They're the party of opposition, not the party of solving problems.

850792309264453633 2017-04-08 19:27:48 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SpeakerRyan Here's  thought: BE the other choice. Give them a public option.
850400301274333184 2017-04-07 17:30:06 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @KansasGOP @RepLynnJenkins I know they both start with 'c' but I need you to stop misspelling Corporations. He's going to ardently defend Corporations.
849717690684116992 2017-04-05 20:17:39 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenPatRoberts So we're just gonna ignore his anti-labor, anti-woman, pro-corporate stances and make believe that he's the new Jesus? Right on.
849599380814520320 2017-04-05 12:27:31 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> This statement literally defines 'silver spoon.' No, Eric, for most of us that's just not the case.https://twitter.com/TIME/status/849494319555899392

847444605637406720 2017-03-30 13:45:13 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump so... get them on your team, or fight them? I'm guessing you probably can't have both.
847417682953617411 2017-03-30 11:58:14 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @NumbersMuncher you spelled criminal wrong buddy. Lying, recording without consent, doctoring footage, and slander? Yeah fuck those guys.
847398961279139840 2017-03-30 10:43:50 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SpeakerRyan because GOP senators continued sanctions against Iran, which was specifically AGAINST the  terms of the deal???

845619812307030016 2017-03-25 12:54:08 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> Hopefully they move to a country where their ideas are more in line with popular opinion. I recommend Saudi Arabia. Or hell. Either way https://twitter.com/CNN/status/845610217383624704
844889561943719937 2017-03-23 12:32:23 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SpeakerRyan FACT: most Americans live paycheck to paycheck and likely won't be able to take advantage of high HSA caps. But you know that.
843885518442184704 2017-03-20 18:02:40 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @POTUS @HouseGOP wow a 70yr old man ranting about a complex issue he doesn't understand. Such compelling evidence of ACA imminent failure...
843881223579713536 2017-03-20 17:45:36 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SpeakerRyan EVERYONE needs health care coverage. Healthy people can still get in accidents, contract diseases, etc. How do u not get it?
841463463578914817 2017-03-13 01:38:18 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @kenklippenstein a lot of women get uncomfortable when men smile at them while violently erect. But it's a nice sentiment.
840187204588716032 2017-03-10 13:06:54 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> Quintessential GOP logic here. - 'It doesn't directly benefit me right now, so I don't want to pay for it.' Who elected this dumpster fire?https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/840178291365576704

831695186321350656 2017-02-14 02:42:39 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @KansasGOP you realize the individual mandate was a GOP plan from the 70s right? So failed design came from your damn drawing board.
831461591258394624 2017-02-14 11:14:25 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @KyleKulinski @UnusualAussie @benjammer83 and you are claiming that they were wrong to do that. So now you must prove they were wrong.
831459647966085120 2017-02-14 11:06:42 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @KyleKulinski @UnusualAussie @benjammer83 You claim CNN claims that his claim is false, burden of proof on u. Not how it works.
831458743565049856 2017-02-14 11:03:06 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @KyleKulinski @UnusualAussie My Wang is 3ft. Not false, unconfirmed. Extreme claims can be dismissed in the absence of sufficient evidence.
831334193892380674 2017-02-13 02:48:11 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @KyleKulinski @UnusualAussie burden of proof is on those making claim. If Kobach wants CNN to change banner, just prove that he's not lying.
831332409492774914 2017-02-13 02:41:06 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @Reuters he should face a lot more than uncertainty. A man who opposes labor as Labor Secretary is as bad as joke as DJT as POTUS.

830440110646763522 2017-02-11 15:35:25 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @NPR good for you, Kasich. Now go one step further and try to eliminate taxpayer funded murder in Ohio altogether.
829844892348186624 2017-02-09 00:10:14 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @KyleKulinski Obama scorecard. It helped me articulate why I'm not a big fan of his to my lib friends, but still gave him due credit. 10/10
828772424854466561 2017-02-06 01:08:38 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenPatRoberts yeah and thanks, Reagan, for arming the Mujahideen, that never came back to 9/11 us or anything.
828586363436068864 2017-02-06 12:49:18 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump I just did a poll of members of my household, 100% find your irrational need for popularity sad and pathetic. Grow up.
827216086147928064 2017-02-02 18:04:18 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @GovSamBrownback I finally get the @GOP. Your interpretation of the Constitution > actual American women, their needs, and their rights.
827148474760192000 2017-02-02 13:35:38 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> Days in office until Trump threatened to go to war with Mexico: 13. Sad!https://twitter.com/TIME/status/827135761107533824
827147589934018560 2017-02-02 13:32:07 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump you are aware that we broke the terms of the deal first, right? What did you expect them to do, roll over and submit?
826778231747571712 2017-02-01 13:04:25 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenPatRoberts here's the thing. His draconian anti-woman record is probably gonna slow things down a bit.
826777391007666176 2017-02-01 13:01:05 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenPatRoberts they voted for Hillary by almost 3 million votes. He does not have a mandate; stop playing make believe on the Senate floor.
826581193021878272 2017-01-31 00:01:28 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @POTUS @GOP the American people elected Hillary? By nearly 3 million votes??? Are you guys in a coma?
826501168285282306 2017-01-31 18:43:28 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenSchumer @SenateGOP Yeah but he can read the list and determine that he doesn't like any of them?? Or do you just want a catchy headline?
826500700146397188 2017-01-31 18:41:37 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump Yeah... pick qualified people w/out huge conflicts of interest then, genius.
825312620823642112 2017-01-28 12:00:37 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @GovSamBrownback Says guy who didn't expand Medicaid, risking the lives of the most vulnerable Kansans. Your hypocrisy should cause you immeasurable shame.
825042880523821056 2017-01-27 18:08:45 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @washingtonpost There have been many wars since FDR, and we have been the aggressor time and again. Trump did not end Long Peace, it wasnt real to begin.
825041050045669377 2017-01-27 18:01:29 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @justicedems Hey, when you start paying your bribes you can complain about who gets special treatment, got it?
825009086978785280 2017-01-27 15:54:28 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @GOP Like Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland, the kids from Sandy Hook, Pulse, etc? No, the zygotes and fetuses... call it the March 4 Birth instead?
824771483243311104 2017-01-26 00:10:19 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> So the plan is to use our tax dollars to build it, then have us pay more for stuff until it's paid for? Who voted for this orangutan?https://twitter.com/MarketWatch/status/824754045122404352
824047446586179584 2017-01-24 00:13:15 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @YouTube @justicedems @KyleKulinski Set up a monthly contribution about 3 minutes into your segment. I'm excited at the idea of a major party with a good platform.
823207050205364224 2017-01-22 16:33:49 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump So... you realize you lost the popular vote by nearly 3,000,000 right? Most ppl did not want you for prez. <40% approval rating, remember?
822145162407276544 2017-01-19 18:14:16 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @KansasGOP $ = votes. Low info voters vote on name recognition. More $=more ads=more votes. PLUS the $ has strings attached. So yeah, brag I guess.
822070749997449217 2017-01-19 13:18:34 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> Busy day for @POTUS I guess... I mean that or the @GOP lied to us for 8 years...https://twitter.com/brianrayguitar/status/821946065108619264
822070415426207745 2017-01-19 13:17:15 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump 'Yeah I took a shit on the floor, but hey it wasn't clean when I got here!' This argument is stupid, and you should feel bad. Sad!
821878333189292032 2017-01-18 00:33:59 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @KansasGOP because winning is clearly more important than, idk, doing a good job, or helping people, or being a decent human being. #GOPGTFO
821548464542777344 2017-01-17 02:43:12 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenateGOP Patients, families, and docs don't make the decisions: the insurance companies do. You guys aren't familiar bcuz we pay for your coverage.
821545988183719937 2017-01-17 02:33:21 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SpeakerRyan 1. 0 confirmed casualties from leak. 2. We deserved to know what she told us. 3. We murdered civilians and covered it up. 4. Literally GTFO.
820240572397060097 2017-01-14 12:06:06 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @KansasGOP @RepKevinYoder Congress gets guaranteed healthcare either way, so these GOP thugs aren't even 'on the plane.' They don't care who dies. It won't be them.
820239972376649728 2017-01-14 12:03:43 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @KansasGOP @RepKevinYoder This plane sucks! Let's build a better one! But first, let's tear the wings off of this one!! What's the worst that could happen?
819901950779080704 2017-01-13 13:40:32 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump For-profit ins companies are what is making care unaffordable. They leech money out of the system to buy lobbying, advertising, and yachts.
819703596639993856 2017-01-12 00:32:21 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @JoeBiden @CongHuelskamp It's so cute that you still feel relevant enough to insult someone like Biden. Good job pal.
819594278884282373 2017-01-12 17:17:58 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenPatRoberts 4. As your constituent, I am disappointed by your vote.
819594133111193600 2017-01-12 17:17:23 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenPatRoberts 3. Many ACA provisions are too popular to repeal: preexisting conditions, 80/20 rule, contraceptives, parent plan til 26, etc.
819593048111910914 2017-01-12 17:13:04 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenPatRoberts 2. If you think you can just repeal the ACA without a replacement, you're fooling yourself. 20m citizens will not lose care at your whims.
819592753717932034 2017-01-12 17:11:54 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenPatRoberts 1. Yes, costs continue to rise after ACA, but the rate of change is lower than it has been in years. Pre-ACA trends would have higher costs.
818424260100296706 2017-01-09 11:48:43 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump Mexico never agreed to pay for the wall, and your tweets won't change that, Cheeto Hitler.

808687424331218945 2016-12-13 14:58:01 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SpeakerRyan taking away the ability of an impoverished parent to feed their child makes you a monster. Use your power for good.
808686821098090496 2016-12-13 14:55:37 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SpeakerRyan but we both know you won't do that, because you love your children. Please understand that 'the poors' feel the same way.

805834755040313344 2016-12-05 18:02:31 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @realDonaldTrump a press that can stand up to the powerful is a hallmark of our democracy. If you can't understand that, you are a failure.
805627811738353665 2016-12-04 04:20:12 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> @SenateMajLdr to protect consumers, the govt should provide healthcare to the citizens and abolish the vampiric health insurance industry.

796739685968134144 2016-11-10 15:41:58 UTC <mrdavidbrokaw> Trump first 100 days, the bad: 'review every single regulation in the last 8 years,' no Syrian refugees, overturn executive orders.
