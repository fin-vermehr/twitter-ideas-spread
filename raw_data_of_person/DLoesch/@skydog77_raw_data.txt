969942880864342016 2018-03-03 14:29:38 UTC <skydog77> @bonniemcfarlane Loved your Tonight Show gig. @GregGutfeldShow  should have you back on his curvey couch. Well, you know what I mean....
969941556223512576 2018-03-03 14:24:22 UTC <skydog77> @adultswim Just let it go....sorry....
969940177975160833 2018-03-03 14:18:53 UTC <skydog77> @dagenmcdowell You're absolutely right, I can't believe Trump thinks this is a good thing to do. The steel industry in this country is booming and the US controls about 70% of the market. This will only wind up with us all paying more for cars and basically wipe out this tax cut.
