968551306335064064 2018-02-27 18:20:00 UTC <henn_jeff> @FedEx Thank you for continuing your business relationship with the NRA. Shows your leadership in dealing with complicated situations and not being overrun by a loud minority.

966414781057036290 2018-02-21 20:50:13 UTC <henn_jeff> @iheartmindy @davidhogg111 is obviously seeking personal gain and fame on the backs of these unfortunate victims. Shame on him and shame on CNN for fabricating a story for him to tell. #CNN
965380743785598976 2018-02-18 00:21:19 UTC <henn_jeff> @thehill @Phillysage Agree 100%. Senator Casey is a stooge for Schumer just like he was for Dingy Harry. He is a nobody.
962092444962754561 2018-02-09 22:34:48 UTC <henn_jeff> @politicalelle Pelosi has been speaking nonsense for years. So eight hours was a piece of cake for her.
961295284721594368 2018-02-07 17:47:10 UTC <henn_jeff> #Comey @Comey Stozk/Page opened the gates to implicate Obama. So we now have Obamagate. Of course you knew Obama was involved, despite what he said in his interview with Chris Wallace. Wear your FBI cufflinks when you fall on your sword or are pushed under the bus.
961293028064399360 2018-02-07 17:38:12 UTC <henn_jeff> @Comey @comey Stozk/Page have opened the gates to the Obama oval office. So we now have Obamagate. Of course you knew that Obama was involved, despite what he said in his interview with Chris Wallace. Wear your FBI cufflinks when you fall on your sword or are pushed under the bus.
961051465774137350 2018-02-06 01:38:19 UTC <henn_jeff> @Comey you are acting really weird. Guilt must be tearing you down. Makes you do and say stupid stuff.
959512178540843010 2018-02-02 19:41:44 UTC <henn_jeff> @Comey There was always this aura that @Comey was a decent honest man with a boy scout reputation. Your tweets have completely vaporized that aura. You are just another political hack, but one that abused their power. Disgusting.

958551493992476679 2018-01-30 04:04:19 UTC <henn_jeff> @realDonaldTrump @OliverMcGee The face of the Democratic Party. Dreamers, are you sure you want to align with this?
958550737012822016 2018-01-30 04:01:19 UTC <henn_jeff> @MarkSimoneNY Kennedy drooling. Pelosi playing with her dentures. Hoyer playing dead. Dreamers, this is your party?

958435070074937344 2018-01-30 20:21:42 UTC <henn_jeff> @JackPosobiec Nancy you are very confused. The DNA department analyzed Monica's blue dress.
958319792674492416 2018-01-30 12:43:37 UTC <henn_jeff> @JoeNBC Don't you care how Clinton corrupted FBI and Justice? Clinton buddy McAuliffe giving Mccabe's wife $760,000 for her campaign shortly after Hillary email scandal became public. Be angry about that @JoeNBC? Clinton ruined reputation of FBI. Yet you hate Trump more.
958306052214280192 2018-01-30 11:49:01 UTC <henn_jeff> @JoeNBC why do you believe everything you hear? Why don't you get a job on The View. More befitting your journalistic skills.

957274345608445952 2018-01-27 15:29:23 UTC <henn_jeff> @thehill Cant wait to hear the name Trump labels on Maxine. She is nuttier than the average Democrat.
957272938847395840 2018-01-27 15:23:48 UTC <henn_jeff> @morningmika Mika.. you are on track, for a change. Hillary has lied to our face for decades. That is a failure of character. She has none.
957272440727638016 2018-01-27 15:21:49 UTC <henn_jeff> @morningmika As Hillary famously said and still believes..What difference does it make. Sleeziest and most corrupt women on the planet.
955432236450541569 2018-01-22 13:29:30 UTC <henn_jeff> Would the media ask Oprah or Hillary about their body mass index if they were President. Dont think so even though both are obese.

939873497618186241 2017-12-10 15:04:38 UTC <henn_jeff> @brianstelter Reporters are getting stupider and more partisan. No credibility. I no longer watch MSM. No respect for reporters that publish #Fakenews in their zeal to get Trump. And they really lack intelligence, as a group.

865199037200388097 2017-05-18 13:34:59 UTC <henn_jeff> By writing a memo, Comey put himself in a box.  If he accuses Trump of obstruction, he is in legal jeopardy for failing to report it.
864850141613785088 2017-05-17 14:28:36 UTC <henn_jeff> @mitchellvii I support Trump's policies, I do not support his behavior. That is what must change.

861361252802711553 2017-05-07 23:25:00 UTC <henn_jeff> Senator Casey is one of those out of touch Democrats. Hope he looses in 2018.

731252479996788737 2016-05-13 22:39:11 UTC <henn_jeff> @BillKristol Focus on defeating Hillary or you will become irrelevant.
731200003478310912 2016-05-13 19:10:40 UTC <henn_jeff> @KatrinaPierson The headline is inaccurate. The firm was part-owned by Bill's mistress. #ClintonStench

730600770597494784 2016-05-11 03:29:32 UTC <henn_jeff> @BreitbartNews Obama's team is transparently stupid. Bunch of racist political hacks.

728624409708249088 2016-05-06 16:36:11 UTC <henn_jeff> @FoxNews That's why a community organizer should never have been elected.
728575237634330624 2016-05-06 13:20:47 UTC <henn_jeff> @mitchellvii Kristol making himself irrelevant.Doesn't seem smart enough to see that. He is like a biblical Pharisee afraid of a movement.
728554902784487424 2016-05-06 11:59:59 UTC <henn_jeff> Andrew Card on CBS this morning sounded like a Pharisee threatened by the #Trump movement.
719501914237452288 2016-04-11 12:26:38 UTC <henn_jeff> @mitchellvii @MyPresidentme Hopefully he can recover from Trump campaign's failure to manage delegates. Troubling.
717720914587164672 2016-04-06 14:29:35 UTC <henn_jeff> hellvii Trump as smart as you believe. Attacking popular Scott Walker was dumb. He has the least effective campaign organization. Winging it
717690559473848320 2016-04-06 12:28:58 UTC <henn_jeff> @mitchellvii Trump has to stop winging it and act more presidential.
717539694855200770 2016-04-05 02:29:29 UTC <henn_jeff> @mitchellvii Trump must be more inclusive, more presidential if he wants to turn his flailing campaign around.
715999881647759361 2016-04-01 20:30:49 UTC <henn_jeff> @BreitbartNews actually he meant Bernie Sanders voters.
715880696389246976 2016-04-01 12:37:13 UTC <henn_jeff> @mitchellvii If I am going to continue supporting Trump, he must start acting like a grown up. The window is closing.
715659960441561090 2016-03-31 22:00:05 UTC <henn_jeff> @mitchellvii I have been a Trump supporter. But if he doesn't start to act Presidential, that may change. Growing more disappointed in Trump
715625192853266432 2016-03-31 19:41:56 UTC <henn_jeff> @DanScavino @at_maggiemac @realDonaldTrump I hope the protesters are paying income tax on the wages they receive. IRS please audit them.
715330458167472129 2016-03-30 00:10:46 UTC <henn_jeff> @mitchellvii @Po_st Why is Trump disappointing us by being unpresidential? That must change or he will loose.
715151681303023617 2016-03-30 12:20:22 UTC <henn_jeff> @mitchellvii @MyPresidentme Still disappointed that Trump isn't acting more presidential.
714908382428274690 2016-03-29 20:13:35 UTC <henn_jeff> @BradThor Brad..What party is the prosecuting district attorney affiliated with? Same type of political witch hunt Rick Perry experienced
709785218018889728 2016-03-15 16:55:57 UTC <henn_jeff> @Younglionking7 How many years are you going to be a college student living off of taxpayer money. You are indeed a poster child for Bernie.
709413170943827968 2016-03-14 16:17:34 UTC <henn_jeff> @bernie @brithume #LittleTommyDimassimo is a poster child for @Bernie supporters. 4th year acting student. Free tuition for loosers like this??
709025794295730177 2016-03-13 14:38:17 UTC <henn_jeff> @DanScavino If they are being paid, I hope they are paying payroll taxes (both employer and employee). If not IRS should prosecute.
706458701599793152 2016-03-06 12:37:34 UTC <henn_jeff> @mitchellvii So do I. Trump has waited to long to start discussing policy.
706288374525472772 2016-03-05 01:20:45 UTC <henn_jeff> @mitchellvii Imperative!!
706266804327477248 2016-03-05 23:55:02 UTC <henn_jeff> @mitchellvii Trump needs to start acting consistently like an adult.
706248461319020544 2016-03-05 22:42:09 UTC <henn_jeff> @mitchellvii Needs to be a serious post mortem by the Trump campaign. This is disappointing.
706247932283129856 2016-03-05 22:40:03 UTC <henn_jeff> @mitchellvii Disappointing day for Trump. He has to start talking a consistent set of policies. He needs to be a steady, consistent CEO.
699731612787937280 2016-02-16 23:06:31 UTC <henn_jeff> @FoxNews @POTUS Not true in 2008. Voters were not sensible. They were gullible and many suffered "buyers remorse".
699730469349408770 2016-02-16 23:01:58 UTC <henn_jeff> @BreitbartNews @HillaryClinton she coughs so much because lying makes your throat dry.

697252553956925440 2016-02-09 02:55:37 UTC <henn_jeff> #BernieSanders don't make college free. Instead, make colleges run more effectively. Get rid of high salary liberal college elites.

696182195799597058 2016-02-06 04:02:24 UTC <henn_jeff> @NolteNC @KLSouth Maybe Martha can post bail for Hillary.
696158853407379456 2016-02-06 02:29:39 UTC <henn_jeff> @jaketapper Trump for calling out the big donors in the audience. That took balls! Good for him.
695453093501075456 2016-02-04 03:45:13 UTC <henn_jeff> @MSNBC @HillaryClinton Hillary is a prolific liar. She is disqualified to run for President. She lied to the family of dead Benghazi heros.
694992963294879744 2016-02-03 21:16:49 UTC <henn_jeff> #IndictHillary I hope the intelligence community sends Hillary the bill to cover their costs to assess the damage she has done.
693912187329474560 2016-01-31 21:42:12 UTC <henn_jeff> @FredZeppelin12 @ChristiChat @aabramson I still say that Chelsea looks like Webster Hubbell (baby daddy?)

691804417763459076 2016-01-25 02:06:40 UTC <henn_jeff> @laureldavilacpa @HillaryClinton A trusted leader?? Are you kidding! She put greed (i.e. Clinton Foundation) before national security.
691802599633330176 2016-01-25 01:59:27 UTC <henn_jeff> @ItalianVegan She's a first class liar who put greed (i.e. Clinton Foundation) above national security. You must be a low information voter.
691724856489046016 2016-01-25 20:50:32 UTC <henn_jeff> @HillaryClinton There is no reason you should have let Clinton Foundation greed get in the way of national security via #Emailgate.

691676179561123841 2016-01-25 17:37:06 UTC <henn_jeff> @RealJamesWoods Be interesting to see if Hillary tries to throw #Abedin, #Mills, #Sullivan under the bus. A falling out of thieves scenario.
691675392302784512 2016-01-25 17:33:58 UTC <henn_jeff> @RealJamesWoods Click and Hillary as cell mates?. Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills in the adjacent cell. Nice. Conjugal visits from Bubba Bill?
689622786457870336 2016-01-19 01:37:39 UTC <henn_jeff> @mitchellreports @brianefallon Andrea...the Clintons and their hacks lie! Don't you understand that? Haven't you seen this movie before?
