953737221282193409 2018-01-17 21:14:07 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @OakmontHooks I have a painting of the 8th hole at Ballyneal that is fantastic.
948713821585240064 2018-01-03 00:32:55 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @wesbury Last I looked the team that you wanted out is in championship game. I will say though, Alabama did not deserve to be in playoffs even though they are probably the best team. Just like Ohio St did not deserve to be in it last year.
948356585365082113 2018-01-02 00:53:24 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @wesbury Big Ten was favored in SEVEN of eight games. That should have finished 7-1.
947951948187267074 2018-01-01 22:05:31 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @wesbury They were favored in 7 out of 8 games. Not surprised they went 7-1. Actually surprised they didnt go 8-0.
947933283047886853 2018-01-01 20:51:21 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @wesbury Big 10 was favored in every bowl game except one. Purdue was a 2.5 underdog against an average Arizona team. Lets not get ahead of ourselves with how great the Big 10 is. A real champ will be crowned.
947846642308395008 2018-01-01 15:07:04 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @KirkHerbstreit Big Ten was a favorite in EVERY bowl game but one. And that game Purdue was a 2.5 dog to an average Arizona team. Lets not get too hyped on their undefeated bowl season. Michigan is an 8 point favorite today and should win too. Yay.
934592592829931520 2017-11-25 01:20:12 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @SEC @AuburnFootball @KirkHerbstreit I guess its okay to lose at home to Clemson??
932038286725480450 2017-11-18 00:10:18 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @CanesFootball Well done boys. Thanks for repping The U.
932037863729975297 2017-11-18 00:08:37 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @CFBONFOX @holly_sonders You should have gone to Miami.
922200520844087296 2017-10-22 20:38:32 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @joelklatt Clemson loses to Syracuse and Miami beats them but is behind Clemson? Nice.
920041671445962758 2017-10-16 21:40:02 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @joelklatt The U
917475010696175617 2017-10-09 19:41:03 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @joelklatt No Miami?
901253337932279809 2017-08-25 01:21:54 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @ColdStone Customer service was awful, out of French Vanilla and two sizes. Ridiculous
881266855658364928 2017-07-01 21:42:46 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @OakmontHooks Did you play there recently? What did you think?
877921258276442112 2017-06-22 16:08:33 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @tonyiommi It would be nice if you guys did something like this for your Dio years. They were pretty awesome as well and still part of your heritage.
826885121697529856 2017-02-01 20:09:10 UTC <mr_hurricane1> Go Canes. Stay in Dade.
813165420240834562 2016-12-25 23:31:58 UTC <mr_hurricane1> #Apple sucks. They send me a verification code and I use it TWICE. Then I get "invalid code". Are you kidding?
782329197960323073 2016-10-01 21:19:50 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @BeefGolf I love his putter
764287892411838467 2016-08-12 02:30:07 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @Planet_Golf did you see The Loop?
761519151785672704 2016-08-05 11:08:08 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @mr_hurricane1 @Planet_Golf thanks. Can't wait to get your book.
761280444440739841 2016-08-04 19:19:36 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @Planet_Golf is Rock Creek Cattle in the new book?
756649778239434752 2016-07-22 00:38:59 UTC <mr_hurricane1> #americanairline is the WOAT. They tell me I'm going to miss my connection so I get switched to #United 3 hrs later. I would have made it.
746892362148880384 2016-06-25 02:26:30 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @MattGinellaGC mine is Rock Creek Cattle Company
745580170443112448 2016-06-22 11:32:19 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @RonWhittenGD Have you played Victoria National?
745371718542233601 2016-06-21 21:44:00 UTC <mr_hurricane1> #papa johns sucks. Can't accept a bill larger than a twenty.
720759135940321280 2016-04-14 23:42:23 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @LindseyPelas you need trust. A little jealousy is ok, but if you don't 100% trust your partner, jealousy will tear you up.
713150586770817024 2016-03-24 23:48:44 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @wesbury you should golf at Tara Iti
699269808500580352 2016-02-15 16:31:28 UTC <mr_hurricane1> I've chosen @Gmachine813 to come with me to http://prizeo.com/pt/a%20Cinderella%20Story%20Caddyshack%20Experience if I win! #CinderellaStoryWithBill
699075801078226944 2016-02-14 03:40:33 UTC <mr_hurricane1> @wesbury @marcorubio good choice.
