970877408474685440 2018-03-05 04:23:06 UTC <girlnasty22> @KateMossMusic @ananavarro Pretty cheap looking letters...what are they made of genuine plastic?
970876778821558273 2018-03-05 04:20:36 UTC <girlnasty22> @AnnCoulter I don't know Annie!    If we are looking for a village idiot we've got you, and all the folks over at FuxNews!

970864327950569472 2018-03-05 03:31:08 UTC <girlnasty22> @tonyposnanski And not good for Erin ....having the obviously mentally deficient opportunist on for about 25 minutes of embarrassing infamy!
970861667306299393 2018-03-05 03:20:33 UTC <girlnasty22> @brianstelter I guess the question we are all asking: does he have a brain up in his BERG....answer: NUN!
970860763865759745 2018-03-05 03:16:58 UTC <girlnasty22> @MarkLandler @maggieNYT @AnaSwanson The old dolt Roth has mentioned the cost of a can of soup.  I want to know how much more our new battleships, aircraft carriers, subs& jets along with all the bridges that need to be replaced and new factories for our returning industry are gonna cost us  will they also be .6 %
970858401340129281 2018-03-05 03:07:35 UTC <girlnasty22> @OutFrontCNN @ErinBurnett @brianstelter Here's one trumpion just a little bit dumber than the rest.....just a tad!
970857156391010305 2018-03-05 03:02:38 UTC <girlnasty22> @GeraldoRivera @SebGorka @seanhannity Should be great! Gorka a Hungarian refugee and Rivera of Puerto Rican heritage whose father got into the country before 1952....are going to discuss how to keep people out of the USA..might as well drag the Irish potato famine Princess Annie Coulter and get her two bits worth!
970851180443156480 2018-03-05 02:38:53 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNNPolitics There they are the two crooked conmen enjoying a good laugh about how they have BSed everybody in two countries on opposite sides of the globe.....they should be and will be in jail soon!
970849645894148097 2018-03-05 02:32:47 UTC <girlnasty22> @AnnCoulter I dunno about that Annie....Hannity and his Kung-Fu buddy Bo Dietly are still out there "armed and dangerous" just like the movie!
970848842923978752 2018-03-05 02:29:36 UTC <girlnasty22> @IngrahamAngle .....in response to your deleted tweet....the one you trashed cuz you put your foot in it!  Are you talking about Weinstein or trump or both...peas in a pod I'd say! If you're a star...you can do anything............
970712306240798720 2018-03-05 17:27:03 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNNPolitics Speaking of brain surgery.....why would anyone need a $31,000 dining suite in their office/ place of business?
970704153742749697 2018-03-05 16:54:39 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @DonnaWR8 Well maybe you should throw those concerns back at the trump family.....all goods produced overseas and all steel for trump properties imported from JINA!
970703474739458049 2018-03-05 16:51:57 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump It's pretty hard to protect something that is over-priced and under produced! Protection is one thing but price gouging is yet another!
970699575571787779 2018-03-05 16:36:28 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump Because of the hammer &sickle emblems emblazoned along side those of the trump enterprises!  "you can fool all of the people some of time( trump cons)....and some of the people all of the time(trumpions)....but you can't fool all of the people all of the time( too many Dems)"
970696129095516160 2018-03-05 16:22:46 UTC <girlnasty22> @michellemalkin @FoxNews And your proof of that ridiculous statement is ...............?
970694730806784000 2018-03-05 16:17:13 UTC <girlnasty22> @GovMikeHuckabee @foxandfriends A disagreement on a "point of view" could hardly be construed as Hucksterbee' s profound Christian Supremacist philosophy of what is acceptable for human inhabitants of our very diverse planet!
970334612638412800 2018-03-04 16:26:14 UTC <girlnasty22> @mschlapp @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @foxandfriends ...."Donald trump is re-active, he's enraged, he's a know-it-all, and he's a problem maker"
970060815297474560 2018-03-03 22:18:15 UTC <girlnasty22> @thehill @DLoesch ....buying a rifle is not the same as owning or having access to one. My uncle gave me a 22 when I was twelve and taught me how to responsibly use and care for it...and we hunted together. He also taught me how to fish but I didn't feel the need to brandish rod or gun!
970056298833178624 2018-03-03 22:00:19 UTC <girlnasty22> @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @don_wreyford And I so love repugnicans!
970030423932772352 2018-03-03 20:17:30 UTC <girlnasty22> @FoxNews If Putin said it......we'd better start digging those bomb shelters.....trump has started his at maralago!
970028925609902080 2018-03-03 20:11:32 UTC <girlnasty22> @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @don_wreyford Sometimes people get confused when talking about millions, billions & trillions. So here's a little helper: 1 million seconds is 12 days..1 billion seconds is 32 years..1 trillion seconds is 32,000 years...enjoy your cable and steak dinner....I've opted out for 1/2 a Starbucks
970017372500254720 2018-03-03 19:25:38 UTC <girlnasty22> @DonaldJTrumpJr @melaniedeppen So now junior is trolling funerals for any positive feedback about daddy....I don't think a 99 year old man was really paying much attention to the actions or ramblings of a lunatic!
970014868836270080 2018-03-03 19:15:41 UTC <girlnasty22> @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @don_wreyford Billionaires don't give away or spend, that's how they became billionaires unless it's Bill Gates. trump & his family are still importing all their goods from China you don't see Ivanka building a garment factory in USA. You had too much of the koolaid! Fun fact: It's not real!
970013232655036416 2018-03-03 19:09:11 UTC <girlnasty22> @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @don_wreyford Yeah! You got a temporary $3 day tax cut while Billionaire Warren Buffet got a $29 Billion tax cut! We're certainly not impressed with career politicians nor should we be with career conmen/shysters!
970011463816380416 2018-03-03 19:02:09 UTC <girlnasty22> @IvankaTrump Well little princess! daddy gave away billions of $ of infrastructure money to his billionaire buddies. Warren Buffet was pretty happy with the $29 BILLION he saved! That would have replaced a lot of archaic leaking water mains! And that's just Buffet's windfall/trumpfall!
970009928487264256 2018-03-03 18:56:03 UTC <girlnasty22> @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @don_wreyford And ...."business man"! That's debatable 5 bankruptcies, trump U, and many more failed businesses! If it weren't for The Apprentice he be a doorman at trump tower
970009084366798848 2018-03-03 18:52:42 UTC <girlnasty22> @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @don_wreyford Yes we are all sick of "do nothing" politicians! But that doesn't mean we have to try having a narcissistic lunatic in the Oval Office. People love him for a temporary $3 a day tax cut while Warren Buffet saved $29 BILLION! The Dotard gave away billions of infrastructure funds!

Cars are designed for transportation, deaths are a result of "accidents". Guns were designed to kill, and that is their sole purpose, period. Automatics & 100 round magazines are to designed to kill as many as possible as quick as possible! Period!..BTW it's moot
969994650713927680 2018-03-03 17:55:21 UTC <girlnasty22> @gracerodriguez @shannonrwatts @Mendoza09975657 This is such an idiotic narrative foisted by fools. Human beings are imperfect and for the most part cowardly. If one wants to kill someone he/she finds it easier and safer to use a gun than a bat. The bat will kill but was designed for a game. Guns are made exclusively to kill!
969992108068126720 2018-03-03 17:45:14 UTC <girlnasty22> @shannonrwatts I've got $20 says he's back on the street with his gun within 24 hours!

We don't don't want to reduce but eradicate. This is just a politician putting words on paper that literally mean nothing. Just another NRA puppet!

969777688025088001 2018-03-02 03:33:13 UTC <girlnasty22> @IngrahamAngle National Motto? I don't know if that's the motto of those that have been massacred over the last few years while enjoying night clubs, movies, concerts or trying to get an education. And those who have trusted they would survive deadly cancers. I'd say trust has to be earned

969443881547739137 2018-03-01 05:26:47 UTC <girlnasty22> @benslick101 Sorry the global economy doesn't work that way. Protectionism may work until other countries impose tariffs on our exports then we won't be able to compete with our high wages and costs of production. That's why the trumps import all their products. Agree to disagree
969386901240086530 2018-03-01 01:40:22 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump @Alisand3 @IngrahamAngle @RZapparelli Well I guess you can blame trump and those like him who took advantage of his own country's high price wage earners and consequential steel prices, and opted to use Chinese and Korean steel in all of his projects! Now this scammer is your hero?

967528440957059072 2018-02-24 22:35:30 UTC <girlnasty22> @DLoesch Then you shouldn't act like one!

967513238622515200 2018-02-24 21:35:06 UTC <girlnasty22> @BretBaier @JonathanTurley @Asw2belle @realDonaldTrump There is no one with more disgusting or evil ways than trump. I am baffled by the fact that people forget that trump hired Manafort for a reason....his campaign was in the shitter till Manafort took over & intensified Russian involvement!
967511047291641857 2018-02-24 21:26:23 UTC <girlnasty22> @BretBaier @JonathanTurley @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @CNN @foxandfriends Surely you are bright enough to understand that Manafort was the key figure in getting trump elected. Say what you will, but his contacts and conniving was what put the dotard's failing campaign back in the running!
967508433690701824 2018-02-24 21:16:00 UTC <girlnasty22> @Acosta @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @POTUS @WhiteHouse ..Really? I thought it was about him....I thought he was just telling folks we got what the evangelists and the porelee edgikated "took in" ( voted in ) a despicable snake. He should stop reciting it as it describes him to a Tee!
967500350885281792 2018-02-24 20:43:53 UTC <girlnasty22> @JesseBWatters @AnnCoulter @JWMcQuatchi I think you're being generous there....I've always said of Watters that he's as bright as a 2 watt bulb in a power failure!
967499610271838208 2018-02-24 20:40:57 UTC <girlnasty22> @JesseBWatters @AnnCoulter Sorry Annie.....I'll be busy giving myself an enema...but I'm sure the shit will be flying in both scenarios!
966534916065210368 2018-02-21 04:47:35 UTC <girlnasty22> @ananavarro His tiny little hands wouldn't be able to hold five points...and crayon isn't very legible on sweaty palms!
966190692199485441 2018-02-20 05:59:46 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @2havefun72 Hell!... trump refuses to believe he was duped by Russians!
966188196399927296 2018-02-20 05:49:51 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN Trump luvz thuh porlee edgikated!
966184719963623425 2018-02-20 05:36:02 UTC <girlnasty22> @GeraldoRivera @larryelder @seanhannity I think you should be holding trump accountable for not getting Stormy off! That's about all you douchebags are capable of discussing with a modicum of expertise!
966179420913524737 2018-02-20 05:14:59 UTC <girlnasty22> @TomiLahren Ahhhh Tomi you remind me of a young Tammy Fay Baker....younger but just as phuckin dumb!
966175441584193536 2018-02-20 04:59:10 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNNPolitics He doesn't even comprehend what he's reading....so embarrassing!
966174742192447488 2018-02-20 04:56:23 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNNPolitics @foxandfriends @seanhannity @JudgeJeanine @AC360 @MSNBC Why do I feel nauseated every time this literarily challenged turd tries to read something? It's especially painful whe he tries to use his cool dulcet tones.....yeeeeeeccchhhh!
966058403607977984 2018-02-20 21:14:06 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @PressSec @FoxNews Wow! That's a lot of clarity! What's most clear here that you are a delusional trump cheerleader who is in a state of denial or oxygen deprivation!
966057012499955712 2018-02-20 21:08:34 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN Wow what a guy! That will really put a dent in sales. And any murderous kids will have to wait until they're 22 to go on a killing spree .....or until their idiotic NRA card carrying daddy buys them one for Christmas!
966055777088651264 2018-02-20 21:03:40 UTC <girlnasty22> @TuckerCarlson @DevinNunes @FoxNews Discuss? Or rant about?
966054052592144384 2018-02-20 20:56:49 UTC <girlnasty22> @JustDnoes A heart warming note from a wonderful, caring young man, ditto, well done young sir!.....  I gotta say tho', that as I was scrolling through the feed I abruptly stopped thinking  trump was putting pen to paper... sorry I guess I'm losing it.
966038456395751424 2018-02-20 19:54:50 UTC <girlnasty22> @LawrenceAnnucci Here's a poem I was given when I was 8 years old by my father who was a very loving, kind and tolerant man. Give it a read ....have a good day and a memorable life....I wish you nothing but kindnesspic.twitter.com/oqpINP0Iep

Of all his obvious lies this is the most overt and constant! He's pitiful!pic.twitter.com/XDhIj4v5tI
966021702684585984 2018-02-20 18:48:16 UTC <girlnasty22> @LawrenceAnnucci You make my case. Nunes & wikileaks ha ha ha ha ha you might as well throw trump's name in there too. Nunes is a mentally deficient trump surrogate, wikileaks manipulates information & presents it out of context, edited or filled with deletions. You believe them & mock me? Really
966020004658348032 2018-02-20 18:41:31 UTC <girlnasty22> @LawrenceAnnucci Four decades of repugnican lies, character assassination and innuendo which created baggage but not criminality.  "thuh porlee edgikated" have spongy brains and when professional provocateurs spew it out, they soak it up!
966018570856497152 2018-02-20 18:35:49 UTC <girlnasty22> @LawrenceAnnucci I have no rage, where do read that into my opinions. My bitterness comes from the Christian Supremacists who don't follow the Golden Rule. Respect my beliefs " I do not want green eggs and ham, I do not like the Sam I Am! Not in a box not with a fox!..." live & let live!
966014871895646208 2018-02-20 18:21:07 UTC <girlnasty22> @LawrenceAnnucci As a good Christian....I am sure you are aware that the Golden Rule is not technically a commandment, at least not one of the "Ten".... speaking of which how do trump and HRC score on them? My tally: trump is probably at two out of ten and HRC 60/40!
966010371570991104 2018-02-20 18:03:14 UTC <girlnasty22> @LawrenceAnnucci Oh and what was that good news that you and the deciples were spreading? Did the world change the day after the resurrection. Did disease, murder, mayhem, thievery, rape, war, child abuse, skullduggery, fraud, hatred, racism cease to exist? Just what was that good news?
966008640015540224 2018-02-20 17:56:22 UTC <girlnasty22> @VP @FoxNews @LawrenceAnnucci Well trump has no redeeming moral qualities....so...as you assume all the tales in the bible are true, I assume you admired his wealth and thought he would make you rich too....you are obviously very gullible you believe in a virgin birth, water walking and that HRC is crooked
966003814934372352 2018-02-20 17:37:11 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump @CNN "I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, Im automatically attracted to beautiful  I just start kissing them. Its like a magnet. Just kiss. I dont even wait. And when youre a star, they let you do it. You can do anything." Sound familiar?
965998730548686848 2018-02-20 17:16:59 UTC <girlnasty22> @VP @FoxNews @LawrenceAnnucci Religious & societal standards are in many cases diametrically opposed. Muslims throw gays off of buildings as a religious standard. That is not humanity or societal. Religion has caused every war in history! There is only one rule relevant to humanity! Do unto others as you ....
965996608620871680 2018-02-20 17:08:33 UTC <girlnasty22> @VP @FoxNews @LawrenceAnnucci Your opinion is right! Your words are truth! That's why the country & the world are screwed up. You love & idolize trump for being rich, I detest him for the vile person he is. Christians feel it's their right to travel the world forcing their beliefs on everyone... it's NOT!
965842664821178368 2018-02-19 06:56:50 UTC <girlnasty22> @FBI @FoxNews Well he didn't follow the Fux script.....somebody strike his name off our list of propagandists!
965840384281554947 2018-02-19 06:47:46 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNNStyle @CNN Not buying into this..by the time the structure is 500' high the weight near the foundation will turn those timber columns into dust..they will have to be some type of monster glulam, & nobody knows how long glues will last in tension &compression under those conditions. fakenews
965835718131048448 2018-02-19 06:29:14 UTC <girlnasty22> @VP @FoxNews @LawrenceAnnucci Why is it important to you that Joy restores her faith? What is wrong with you Christian Supremacists shoving your beliefs down everyone's throats. How bout I say you should eat steak and eggs every morning because that's what I like...so you better like it too!
965833459846463488 2018-02-19 06:20:15 UTC <girlnasty22> @foxandfriends @4horsemenapoca If you and pence feel that should be his chosen work as highlighted, then he needs to get his preacher's licence!....but as the Vice President he has an equally difficult task and he must put his Christian biases aside and work for all Americans.
965827090334466048 2018-02-19 05:54:57 UTC <girlnasty22> @TempusFugitTX Hello....hello....heeelllloooo!
965823647976796161 2018-02-19 05:41:16 UTC <girlnasty22> @VP @FoxNews You mean the faith and values of the Christian Supremacists..what about the faith, values and humanity of everybody else who are patriots and loyal Americans? I too like to start the day reading fairie tales but I prefer Grimm's, does that make me unAmerican & unworthy?
965819104903905280 2018-02-19 05:23:13 UTC <girlnasty22> @NYDailyNews @melaniedeppen @kylegriffin1 Well I see trump was at least " very reflective" with his xxxx large white shirt and khakis on President's as he had wished we all would be!
965816651248619520 2018-02-19 05:13:28 UTC <girlnasty22> @TempusFugitTX You really have been misinformed....I suggest you actually do some research instead of buying into BS and character assassination. You can never unring a bell and when professional provocateurs get a hold of a spongy mind like yours, they lay it on and you suck it up! Very sad!
965814535641706496 2018-02-19 05:05:03 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @RitaPanahi @AriFleischer @TempusFugitTX Alright you seem to know all about HRC use as many posts of 280 characters as you need to tell me all about her life of corruption.....ready, get set....Go!
965813408330215424 2018-02-19 05:00:35 UTC <girlnasty22> @TempusFugitTX Don't be ridiculous....when the baggage handler loses a suitcase do you blame the pilot? The bottom line was nobody was supposed to be in Benghazi except the CIA at the annex and their mercenary contractor militiamen!
965791265748008961 2018-02-19 03:32:35 UTC <girlnasty22> @TempusFugitTX HRC & Stevens were very dear friends. Stevens was a good man who loved the Middle East and the people of Libya and he truly thought he could make a difference in keeping the peace in the region. I honestly believe that the video denigrating Mohammed was the catalyst for attack
965780880781230080 2018-02-19 02:51:19 UTC <girlnasty22> @TempusFugitTX He certainly asked for more security for Benghazi but because everyone( countries) were leaving, the state department and congress denied further funding and yes it was before the video came out ...probably 6 months before! A little detail repugnicans deem inconsequential !
965774556299325440 2018-02-19 02:26:12 UTC <girlnasty22> @TempusFugitTX One last point that 99% of the trumpion nation of "porelee edgikated" does not consider, understand or even realize: the US Embassy in Libya is located in Tripoli 1000km and 11 hours from Benghazi which is a post/station  not even a bona fide office of the US Ambassador!
965764260776181760 2018-02-19 01:45:17 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @RitaPanahi @AriFleischer @TempusFugitTX Google up Stevens' sister's comments. Its been a long while since I read Lieberman's report and others but they are out there to view. This may give some insight into why I despise trump so much. And how he isn't worthy to shine her shoes. He just trashed his friend O & a General
965762486795304960 2018-02-19 01:38:14 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @RitaPanahi @AriFleischer @TempusFugitTX There were several reports and millions of $ spent trying to blame and discredit HRC. She took all the shit    never once shifting blame to anyone else even from the distraught mother that showed up at trump rallies and who's grief was exploited by Fox News and the trump campaign
965761420640964608 2018-02-19 01:34:00 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @RitaPanahi @AriFleischer @TempusFugitTX HRC underwent 11 cruelling hours of bullying by Gowdy, Jordan, Pompeo, and other GOP jerks. She never once gave up the fact that Stevens' ill fated decision was his alone. Now that is true loyalty from a strong leader and friend!
965760215353212928 2018-02-19 01:29:12 UTC <girlnasty22> @TempusFugitTX Benghazi stations were all closing as countries were evacuating. Stevens was told stay out, there was no security and it was becoming a very dangerous situation. Stevens thought he could calm tensions and went there to save the day. HRC was his friend & never threw him under bus.
965704389930315776 2018-02-19 21:47:23 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @BrookeBCNN ...."thoughts and prayers" is nothing more than a meaningless catch phrase. Our kids need to be safe and the plethora of gun restrictions suggested need to be implemented...if they don't work....fix it till it's right! Thanks to the kids for their participation #UsToo
965682110462705664 2018-02-19 20:18:51 UTC <girlnasty22> @chrislhayes @ABC @FLGovScott @realDonaldTrump And when giving those details let's not forget the beleaguered morale of the FBI due to trump's continuous verbal & tweeted public assault, and the possibility that it may very well have contributed to complacency in the organization!
965678745502625792 2018-02-19 20:05:29 UTC <girlnasty22> @RKJ65 @katierogers Well let's hope trump where's his xxxx large white shirt a khakis so that he can be "very reflective" on the course!
965670273339998208 2018-02-19 19:31:49 UTC <girlnasty22> @foxnewspolitics @CNN definitely an interesting read! Especially Bannon's comment regarding Kelly being the embodiment of Fred trump. And how Fred wanted Donnie the Dodger to be a heroic figure like Gary Cooper. In Kelly trump has his daddy back, & another chance to measure up!https://twitter.com/foxnewspolitics/status/965645203431411712
965665532933361664 2018-02-19 19:12:58 UTC <girlnasty22> @RitaPanahi @AriFleischer @TempusFugitTX Everything you mentioned is BS you have picked up off those Russian sites....and Benghazi was Stevens' debacle....HRC ordered him to stay out of that shithole! My god if you didn't see it when you voted for trump....you must see now! he is no @POTUS
965662248260612096 2018-02-19 18:59:55 UTC <girlnasty22> @gg0U812 @AriFleischer @callawaykeith No! ....trump's "porelee edgykated" did that and that's why the Russians targeted them!   It's ironic because trump mocks, debases and exploits them with every fibre of his being everyday of his life!
965659642800959489 2018-02-19 18:49:34 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @FoxNews @foxandfriends @POTUS @AriFleischer ...nice try Ari...more like the way a turd influences the punch bowl!https://twitter.com/arifleischer/status/965592246165889025
965658341212020736 2018-02-19 18:44:24 UTC <girlnasty22> @AriFleischer Nice try! More like a turd in the punch bowl!
965436624875081728 2018-02-18 04:03:22 UTC <girlnasty22> @DonaldJTrumpJr What media would that be junior? Facebook?
965433198527131648 2018-02-18 03:49:46 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump You bet they are laughing their asses off. They were instrumental in putting you in the highest office of the land.....and you created discord, disruption and chaos within the USA. Not toto mention the embarrassment you have heaped upon us globally!
965429781603889152 2018-02-18 03:36:11 UTC <girlnasty22> @ARmastrangelo Nice try!

965405983919886336 2018-02-18 02:01:37 UTC <girlnasty22> @RexByner @bkingbroker Just when I thought you might be a semi-bright repugnican Conservative, you make an apples and oranges dumbass statement. Obama inherited two wars and a financial disaster nearing depression proportions. Dipshit trump once again inherited a silver spoon and a rising economy! Cmon
965393355860361216 2018-02-18 01:11:26 UTC <girlnasty22> @BFISA @FoxNews @1MrsOpinionated @bkingbroker your idea of ethics is different than mine. Trump bit off more than he could chew, over spent & under planned because he is an arrogant narcissist. If you buy a million $ house borrow 20 million to renovate, live like a king & stiff the contractors while the bank saves you. Fair?
965389786276970496 2018-02-18 00:57:15 UTC <girlnasty22> @RexByner Yeah I re-read that. Thanks for helping out!
965389167218769920 2018-02-18 00:54:48 UTC <girlnasty22> @RexByner @bkingbroker He hasn't done diddly, he has coasted on a good economy and cost the country billions of $ with tax cuts to his donors and pals....now he wants to increase the deficit by trillions without the taxes that would have paid for infrastructure, military, and even his phucking wall!
965386421019205632 2018-02-18 00:43:53 UTC <girlnasty22> @BFISA @FoxNews @1MrsOpinionated @bkingbroker It's not....but screwing over all your debtors is unethical and would have seen criminal action if the banks hadn't backed his play?
965382495544819712 2018-02-18 00:28:17 UTC <girlnasty22> @bkingbroker @RexByner Where the phuck are all you idiots coming from? You don't know shit from shinola and your talkin out of your assholes....bottom line: trump is not fit to be president and you'll all be defending him and his crooked family when orange is their new attire! Thanks for comin out!
965381097692348416 2018-02-18 00:22:44 UTC <girlnasty22> @BFISA @FoxNews @1MrsOpinionated @bkingbroker HRC's the criminal? Show me one charge leading to conviction..just a bogus bs narrative perpetuated by Russians & trumpions. Now on the other hand we have trump declaring bankruptcy 5 times screwing his debtors out of millions! Trump U, 100s of real estate scams, sexual assault
965376182534381569 2018-02-18 00:03:12 UTC <girlnasty22> @BFISA @FoxNews @1MrsOpinionated @bkingbroker You're right! trump doesn't fit in my agenda,he was supposed to drain the swamp instead he's turned it into a cesspool...swamps are good for the ecology, cesspools are just shitholes! And you know what they say to repugnicans when you're up to your neck in shit don't make waves!
965373004866727936 2018-02-18 23:50:34 UTC <girlnasty22> @RepSwalwell @BFISA @FoxNews @1MrsOpinionated @StRegin Well Mr.....I guess this guy must have known my grandfather or plagiarized him because Gramps was saying that "when I was shittin yellow!" ....oh and that's one of Gramp's sayings too!
965371835872296960 2018-02-18 23:45:56 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @RepSwalwell @FoxNews @1MrsOpinionated @BFISA @StRegin It doesn't matter who paid for it, that just saved the taxpayers money. If you hire a detective to follow your wife while she's looking for a real man and he sees her rob a bank and tells the authorities, is that any different! Just say thanks Hillary!
965370946981785600 2018-02-18 23:42:24 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @RepSwalwell @BFISA @FoxNews @1MrsOpinionated And the only thing he has fixed is the election....and he couldn't even do that without the Russians!
965370419778699264 2018-02-18 23:40:18 UTC <girlnasty22> @1MrsOpinionated Have to disagree on HRC.....she dedicated her life to this country! trump was handed life on a silver platter, dodged the draft screwed thousands of people over throughout his lifetime and quite frankly is a dumb as a phucking stick!
965368199054159872 2018-02-18 23:31:28 UTC <girlnasty22> @RepSwalwell @BFISA @FoxNews @1MrsOpinionated @StRegin Who the hell is kid rock and how is he/she relevant?
965358990833041409 2018-02-18 22:54:53 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @RepSwalwell @BFISA @FoxNews @1MrsOpinionated The only big fat No in this scenario is trump....stay tuned and pay attention ....oh and one more thing trump is a crook and a conman...lest we forget!
965355361292070912 2018-02-18 22:40:28 UTC <girlnasty22> @RepSwalwell @BFISA @FoxNews @1MrsOpinionated The Mueller investigation is nowhere near over, trump initiated all the collusion while managing the Miss Universe pageant 2013 and announced to the Russians that he was going to run for @POTUS. The ruskies sent manafort to the campaign when it was going under....more to come!
965353782803509248 2018-02-18 22:34:11 UTC <girlnasty22> @FoxNews @1MrsOpinionated @JConlay Sorry that obviously went over your head...it happens a lot when I'm conversing with trumpions. My fault!

If it wasn't for the Russians you'd be the Vice President of the PTL Club...I don't know who's dumber you, trump or the American people that bought into the Russian propaganda and put you two clowns into office!
965319297739321344 2018-02-18 20:17:10 UTC <girlnasty22> @VP @JoyVBehar @Oprah @FoxNews @chris_allman My father taught me right from wrong and the Golden Rule.....that's all I needed. Fear was never a factor! I feel terrible for you that your father treated you the way trump treated his children....especially Junior!
965318519435874304 2018-02-18 20:14:04 UTC <girlnasty22> @VP @JoyVBehar @Oprah @FoxNews @chris_allman Okay ....show me the validated, witnessed truth.....and not the scribblings of some opium addicted soothsayer left on a sandbar decades after Jesus was gone!

965317039396044800 2018-02-18 20:08:11 UTC <girlnasty22> @FoxNews @1MrsOpinionated @JConlay ....Facebook will be very pleased that people are buying into their ad campaigns. I heard they had just received a billion $ worth of Super Bowl ads...oh wait wasn't that ....I think maybe we should all go buy some of that Prevagen stuff....especially trumpions!

965311832222154753 2018-02-18 19:47:30 UTC <girlnasty22> @BFISA Oh and btw don't buy any timeshares while there!

I loved my father deeply &never feared him!

You Christian Supremacists believe no one has a right to have beliefs other than yours. You have traversed the globe spewing your idiotic theories of virgin births, water walking, leper healing, without an ounce of proof! Con!
965300186342817792 2018-02-18 19:01:13 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump @cfalcone47 @TheBuzzFactoree My father was a child of the 50s & 60s just like trump and he told me that little gesture meant " up yours" which was short for "up your ass" every time trump does it, that's what he telling America!
965298534969892864 2018-02-18 18:54:39 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump @ABCPolitics @CNN @FoxNews  You really are the dumbest @POTUS the @WhiteHouse  has ever housed. What is it 35,000 FBI agents and you think they are all consumed with your and your ridiculous family's exploits and cons? At first you were just embarrassing now downright insulting!
965296440342757377 2018-02-18 18:46:20 UTC <girlnasty22> @RepSwalwell @BFISA @FoxNews @1MrsOpinionated I might have been born at night but it sure as hell wasnt last night! What an absolute load of crap. We're to believe that they spent millions of $ an two years producing ads to air after the election! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
965294984118157312 2018-02-18 18:40:33 UTC <girlnasty22> @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC sad to witness Swalwell's balls shrinking like a couple of raisins right there on national TV. A blind man in a snowstorm can see trump was elected because of the Russian interference! NO QUESTION! The lord hates a coward Erichttps://twitter.com/foxnews/status/965283789701201921
965292120385847296 2018-02-18 18:29:10 UTC <girlnasty22> @FoxNews Why concealed?.....military/police in Guatemala, Nicaragua and many other countries openly carry assault weapons. You don't dare think about making eye contact let alone doing something provocative!

We're learning common sense and moral clarity from children. Maybe there should be a law that no one over 20 be allowed to run for congress and get rid of all these status quo, money grubbing politicians!

Let's stop being simpletons and quit defending military weaponry that can shred a child's body like its gone through a wood chipper!

Hey if you want to pack a six gun on your hip have at it, the streets are dangerous but they are not Iraqi battlefields!
965279013613666304 2018-02-18 17:37:05 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump @EmilyOsment Oh Emily.....that's music to my ears. I'm definitely a full fledged member of that club!

And hey, if banning  AR15s doesn't work we can go back to handing them out in Cracker Jack...see something do something! At what we're seeing needs to be stopped!
965275012239208448 2018-02-18 17:21:11 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC did you ever think that your constant assault on the FBI demeaning their efforts to keep us safe may have contributed to the complacency that has resulted in this tragedy. "Ask not what your country can do for YOU, but what you can do for your COUNTRY"
965271262317633536 2018-02-18 17:06:17 UTC <girlnasty22> @VP @JoyVBehar @Oprah @FoxNews @chris_allman Well if there is such an entity as a God, it should be a loving, caring god who cares about nurturing all children. Just as a parent could not be considered righteous by ruling a household with fear rather than love. There should be no conditions attached to being loved! Fear Not

Christian Supremacy at its finest!

Either way it's a book of fairie tales which occurred over 2000 years with hundreds of authors. That's what I mean about Christian Supremacists you believe your silly bible yet have no tolerance for those of other faiths. You fear god!
964916194993033218 2018-02-17 17:35:22 UTC <girlnasty22> @chrislhayes @VABVOX @ManInTheHoody No interpreter required! The Russians wanted trump to be our @POTUS and they spent millions of $ and thousands of man hours to make it happen and they were successful! They destroyed the credibility of a great patriot. Please don't defend Chris' cop out and bs narrative!
964911490074488832 2018-02-17 17:16:41 UTC <girlnasty22> @chrislhayes Everyone can see the goal was to alter the results, anybody who says otherwise is delusional. The candidate they promoted &shoved down our throat won. The person who worked her entire life for our country was defamed and discredited. Let's not be the fools they took us for!

You said "he only talks to his kids" ....I asked who those kids were. Your answer doesn't make the grade for gods.
964892534605455363 2018-02-17 16:01:21 UTC <girlnasty22> @chris_allman @byrdda You don't seem very bright.....you make a lot of assumptions. I am not filled with hate. trump is a disgusting human being of biblical proportion. How can anyone support such a vile, racist, misogynistic lying http://conman.You have the nerve to judge me yet stand by him?
964737008898723840 2018-02-16 05:43:21 UTC <girlnasty22> @seanhannity @morningjoehater Wear em at the impeachment celebration...that would also be a good time for trump to dump his hats! Cuz that's the only way trump is gonna MAGA, is by him going to jail!
964735974532984838 2018-02-16 05:39:14 UTC <girlnasty22> @seanhannity That makes for a good cover. trump and his comrades get it all set up while running the Miss Universe Pageant and nodody's the wiser, then Putin sets the wheels in motion as trump descends the escalator. That Putin...he sly like KGB!.....trump goot little puppet ..Howdy Doody

964707821047525376 2018-02-16 03:47:22 UTC <girlnasty22> @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Some might say it's difficult to do your job well when your big boss is heaping criticisms, lies and hateful statements onto you daily. Kinda like you spitting on you boss's donut because he gave you shit for moving too slow. You need to feel good about your job to do it well!
964704600233189376 2018-02-16 03:34:34 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump Said the Fly about the Spider!

964679331875180544 2018-02-16 01:54:10 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @ABC @ABCPolitics I was very impressed how trump almost managed to walk and wave at the same time.....almost. It was good to see, with Melania there, he was actually able to find the car right away!https://twitter.com/abc/status/964630941174870016

964673155846451200 2018-02-16 01:29:37 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @DigByck Did you ever think that having to listen to trump's negative criticism for a year may have precipitated some level of complacency at the FBI.....kinda like you fuckin the dog to get back at your boss for calling you a useless piece of shit!
964672238619209728 2018-02-16 01:25:59 UTC <girlnasty22> @Rebdog4 @DownSouthJuker Yeah ....sucking on a joint might help soothe you!....myself I prefer smoking marijuana but I support the LGBT community so you and the dog enjoy your evening!

964664245412507648 2018-02-16 00:54:13 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump @CNN @Maureen723 @marcymutts Please if you care anything about sexual harassment/abuse #MeToo ....do not use this gif to illustrate someone's stupidity!  Maybe just call them a generic phucking idiot!...Thanks
964661812892377089 2018-02-16 00:44:33 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN It's pretty obvious "what happened"! And I'm sure Mr. Wray wished to hell he had never answered the phone when trump's job offer came in.  One can only wonder if trump's criticisms & the severely decimated morale of the FBI contributed to the non response of that critical tip
964658752690384898 2018-02-16 00:32:23 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNNPolitics I'm sure that news takes a real weight off all of our minds! Keep up the good work Rex!

964654900717039617 2018-02-16 00:17:05 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN How can anybody have confidence in this lying buck passer. Obviously his memo says everybody else phucked up and he's on a mission to rewrite procedures to fix the problem, when in fact he was the problem. One must now question his entire illustrious career. Just another conman

But he should probably get back to those meetings he mentioned in his introduction before he works himself into a sweat and spoils his business apparel.    But thx for thinking of me.

964647994627772416 2018-02-16 23:49:38 UTC <girlnasty22> @Rebdog4 I'm wondering if those good parents that raised you with your high standards might be thinking that's where you should be right now?
964644818973372416 2018-02-16 23:37:01 UTC <girlnasty22> @Rebdog4 But I guess you missed their lesson to: Not defend, support or befriend a vile pussygrabbing, womanizing, misogynist, grifter who lies, cheats, welches and violates the Ten Commandments

964610349621063680 2018-02-16 21:20:03 UTC <girlnasty22> @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews Let's start with banning assault weapons. I do believe that buying a pound of C4 is illegal or at least not readily available for sale. How would all your security steps do against someone bringing that and a cell phone into the school? Baby steps let's ban the assault rifles!!!

964588092203003906 2018-02-16 19:51:37 UTC <girlnasty22> @VP @JoyVBehar @Oprah @FoxNews You're right Oprah..God doesn't want you to run & neither do I. God is still busy talking to Pence trying to get him to do the right thing & resign so when trump is impeached we will be rid of them both! Now we've just got to train Ryan to be a human being....it could happen!
964586102093828096 2018-02-16 19:43:42 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @dumptrumpy "Talking points"? It's a broken record.....and like I said it's broken! Toss it! And fix this horrendous state of affairs!
964584497256701952 2018-02-16 19:37:19 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @SpeakerRyan it's confusing that this is not the right time to be political when 17 innocent children lost their lives at school, yet it was the right time when 4 adults lost their lives after they disobeyed orders and went to shithole Benghazi! You really need to leave Ryan!
964581180736589824 2018-02-16 19:24:09 UTC <girlnasty22> @LarsLarsonShow @AnnCoulter Thanks for the warning Annie!
964579644140744704 2018-02-16 19:18:02 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNNPolitics Looks like the rats are abandoning ship....at least those with a conscience!
964578701621919744 2018-02-16 19:14:18 UTC <girlnasty22> @Coll1313 So do trump's stubby little fingers! he's obviously had them in a lot more than porn stars!
964578085096996864 2018-02-16 19:11:51 UTC <girlnasty22> @VP @realDonaldTrump @FBI @TheJusticeDept @Coll1313 Give it up!
964573543743631360 2018-02-16 18:53:48 UTC <girlnasty22> @mkraju Now I guess the trump family are shitting bricks trying to figure out whether any of the 13 people, or 3 association are their bedfellows
964571803145273344 2018-02-16 18:46:53 UTC <girlnasty22> @NYDailyNews I'm surprised that people are surprised at @IngrahamAngle she's your stereotypical Christian Supremacist racist! And for whatever reason they all feel righteous in defending our pig of @POTUS!
964567284990672897 2018-02-16 18:28:56 UTC <girlnasty22> @RedTRaccoon @ReluctantWarri2 You've got the wrong report....that was from a blogger....this was from a close associate who gave all info. Read the story!
964566868924104704 2018-02-16 18:27:16 UTC <girlnasty22> @RedTRaccoon We still have to be concerned about the competency and training of the person on the other end of that phone. Would a pilot ignore a severe weather alert? If this kid had a bump stock there would be hundreds dead or injured! This is more than a mistake!
964565004551782405 2018-02-16 18:19:52 UTC <girlnasty22> @CarolHLN Absolutely unthinkable that this very detailed tip was not followed up. We spend millions of $ and man hours every year operating tip lines all over the USA. This is not a case of falling through a crack, this blatant incompetence!
964562309216575488 2018-02-16 18:09:09 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump @MSNBC ....talk about common sense there is nothing that has come out of the @WhiteHouse or congress in a long time that is more common sense than this rather simple solution....I'm in!https://twitter.com/foaqbm/status/964543171190509568
964560621655097344 2018-02-16 18:02:27 UTC <girlnasty22> @LovelyRita1022 @JuddLegum @PSheppardTV @Ronnimusprime That would be "than reading"! the use of "then" interchangeably with "than" would indicate "yoor wun of trump's porelee edgikated!" Also he said "reading a TelePrompter" not "reading" maybe ingraham should have a slow on how dumb you are!

964359212930183168 2018-02-15 04:42:07 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNNPolitics Sadly we are no longer a nation "common sense"

964188861352914945 2018-02-15 17:25:12 UTC <girlnasty22> @BillOReilly Okay then! Enjoy the rest of your day! BTW nobody really gives a shit about what you think! Give it up!
964185780112449536 2018-02-15 17:12:58 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN This is beyond ridiculous!
964184265196883969 2018-02-15 17:06:57 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump what an absolute load of slop. There wasn't a sincere syllable in that. How can anyone believe a word this con man says. I've got $25 says this phony has never even spoken to his children with all this Christian BS. sickening! Do something!https://twitter.com/cnn/status/964175756938108928
964043250821513216 2018-02-14 07:46:36 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @FionaBenton6 That's not a bet ....that's common knowledge!
964042812059611136 2018-02-14 07:44:52 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @FionaBenton6 @SilencedNero So why do you have a gun? It's locked in a safe....if someone breaks in you are still unarmed and after they force you to open the safe they'll steal your gun and shoot you! I hate to say it but we are either children with a toy or a chicken shit afraid of his own shadow!
964033734428250113 2018-02-14 07:08:47 UTC <girlnasty22> @ChrisCuomo All guns should be banned and collected. For all the gun nuts, you would have to rent the gun appropriate to your activity. Sign the unit out after presenting licence confirming accreditation of proper training and use. Hunting,get a rifle...target, get a pistol...murder get out!
964027357068640256 2018-02-14 06:43:27 UTC <girlnasty22> @FoxNews @nick_gibson8 @williamlegate @MVikings1975 I hate to say it... but in the vast majority of cases, the phrase "responsible gun owner" is an oxymoron
964024686991482881 2018-02-14 06:32:50 UTC <girlnasty22> @FoxNews Wrong and wrong .....it's not a security issue....it's a weapon issueno weapon no issue!  The kid had no parents!......no parentsno love, no guidance, no supportno hope!...the mental health issue is with all of you idiots defending the need to have these guns!
964022112145965056 2018-02-14 06:22:36 UTC <girlnasty22> @MikeLeslieWFAA You forgot step 2A....."thoughts and prayers"! Don't forget that one, that's our main policy to combat these heinous attacks on our children!
964020759600422912 2018-02-14 06:17:14 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump great to hear, but I don't think anyone gives a crap. We all know trump is a vile womanizing piece of garbage, including Melania. But like automatic/semiautomatic assault weapons screwing a porn star is perfectly legal, even if he pre-ejaculatedhttps://twitter.com/krassenstein/status/963851249094463489
964014065029808128 2018-02-14 05:50:38 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @CNN @RepStevenSmith @towerpalms @Beaveocleave What's not to hate? he's a low life, misogynist, lying conman who Ward Cleaver would have counselled the Beaver to stay to f**k away from. And he even looks like Larry Mondello!
964012569496141824 2018-02-14 05:44:41 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN Maybe not who we want to be, but definitely who we choose to be...solution's simple: ban all weapons that are automatic/semiautomatic and hold a magazine with more than six rounds. Force all gun shops to report sales of more than fifty rounds. In short grow up! Guns are NOT toys!
964009681495539712 2018-02-14 05:33:13 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @BakerD42 Nobody's really noticed but they are actually "thoughtless prayers"
964008972825985024 2018-02-14 05:30:24 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @JonathanAlign Yeah and God  has been too busy helping the Eagles win the Super Bowl and other athletes to defeat their arch rivals
964008192580632576 2018-02-14 05:27:18 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN Yeah we saw them all standing around on the street or marching the students, hands over head single file down the concourse. Oh how I wish we had a few Martin Riggs type tv cops who would blow these perps away instead of standing by....sorry I guess nobody wanted to hear that
964003588824432640 2018-02-14 05:09:00 UTC <girlnasty22> @marcorubio @FoxNews @kniymc @Gemmy0298 @craig_arcement Yes enforce the laws! You can't drive a car without unless you're fit, qualified & licensed. Sure people break laws, but most don't. Our country is no different than any other....why is our population so phucked up that we need assault rifles... if you want one join the army!
964001567870369793 2018-02-14 05:00:58 UTC <girlnasty22> @marcorubio @FoxNews @kniymc @craig_arcement @realDonaldTrump ...You're pretty simple just like your tired narrative. Here's how!... if nobody owns a phucking automatic/assault weapon nobody can steal one! get it Einstein? No more shredding the bodies of children with military grade rapid fire weapons!..make sense?
963998734362136576 2018-02-14 04:49:43 UTC <girlnasty22> @marcorubio @FoxNews @craig_arcement Actually banning automatic weapons can stop crazy from killing people by the dozens in split seconds. They serve no purpose in our society!Stop that Phucked
963995474909831168 2018-02-14 04:36:46 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @AGPamBondi @FoxNews @cfreshsobrookln I think our ongoing plan of sending thoughts and prayers is a little lacking in saving the lives of our children and general population! Wake up trump & all you NRA assholes! Enough is enough, and that was Sandy Hook!
963992304745775109 2018-02-14 04:24:10 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @AGPamBondi @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump  Do you think so Pam? More THOUGHTLESS Prayers is not what we need....it's time for your hero to stand up for our children and not the NRA buffoons that control him! We are a disgrace among civilized nations!
963958685897666560 2018-02-14 02:10:34 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump @CNN @FoxNews @WhiteHouse Really? You are working closely with law enforcement....what would that involve? synchronizing thoughts and prayers? Do something you bloody clown! Be a man stand up to NRA and ban these "weapons of mass destruction" that's enough shredded children!
963891981402304512 2018-02-14 21:45:31 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @pkb50 @KaylieNewell Agreed! Although I never physically saw one image of that horrible massacre of beautiful loving children. The images of what thousands of rounds of military grade ammunition could do to those bright eyed darlings, haunts me everyday of my life. It is our greatest shame!
963881436901027840 2018-02-14 21:03:37 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @BrookeBCNN ...Brooke I like you very much: but "please define at large" and many of your questions during this tragedy, were poorly thought out and insulting both to the interviewees and the people watching your show.....Sorry....just disappointed
963877969855787008 2018-02-14 20:49:50 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @MSNBC I would think that smoking Marijuana would be a prerequisite to any job in the @WhiteHouse !
963875894132535296 2018-02-14 20:41:35 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @MSNBC @CNN @KellyannePolls @ACompeggie @Kwame09 He's busy.....helping Christian Supremacist athletes be victorious at Super Bowls and other sporting events!
963868213858549760 2018-02-14 20:11:04 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN Thank goodness he was sitting with Tom....had he been alone he never would have answered! And that's a sad fact!
963858296116424704 2018-02-14 19:31:40 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNNPolitics Yes but he looked like a little girl whose mommy had told him he wasn't allowed to even look at a boy.....what is wrong with us? How on earth did we ge here....does anyone else yearn for the Nixon years, I do and I wasn't even here!
963856698057179136 2018-02-14 19:25:19 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump @melaniedeppen Yes and when he fux it up( which is often) he throws in one of his own vocabulistic enhancers like "totally"...(you'll find it)...they are in every speech some how he feels the ad lib diverts our attention and illustrates he has more than grade two reading skills.
963852746678923264 2018-02-14 19:09:36 UTC <girlnasty22> @melaniedeppen @cnnsport Good for you Adam!...this really raises our awareness that if we get rid of the dotard trump we're gonna get this intolerant Christian Supremacist....if there is a God he/she worked harder getting the Eagles the Super Bowl than defending USA's compassion & credibility!
963849058719707137 2018-02-14 18:54:57 UTC <girlnasty22> @VP @MonicaCrowley @JoyVBehar @FoxNews Yes sweety you take that mythical mid- eastern figure born of a virgin who walked on water, then turned it into wine and all the other marvel comic type heroics!....Christian Supremacists.....use your head, that's that lump 3 ft above your ass!
963845991542677504 2018-02-14 18:42:46 UTC <girlnasty22> @RyanGaydos @shaunwhite @FoxNews @SamathaHamilton Try flying through a run like that and then have some moron give you a flag, bouquet of flowers or even a glass of water, while you're physically and emotionally spent....enough with this flag fanaticism! He's done more for our flag than you or that phuck trump ever will!
963844537956225026 2018-02-14 18:36:59 UTC <girlnasty22> @RyanGaydos @shaunwhite @FoxNews If anyone should be blamed for the flag being dragged (which I might say has been dragged through many other hard fought triumphs) it's the idiot who gave it to him while he celebrated, collected his equipment and thoughts after an incredible and exhausting run! Phuck all haters!
963679750219804672 2018-02-13 07:42:11 UTC <girlnasty22> @IngrahamAngle Separation of church and state lady.....what part of that don't you understand? You Christian Supremacists look down on everyone who doesn't believe in fairy tales. Pence doesn't have the ear of Jesus....he's too busy helping the Eagles win the Super Bowl!
963259979120586752 2018-02-12 03:54:10 UTC <girlnasty22> @shannonrwatts Interesting comment....if you cover Michelle's head with a finger it is hauntingly her, from the guns to the statuesque posture. Obama's is a better likeness, but the idea of such a remarkable statesman sitting in a bush with wavy hair undermines his Great Presidency!
963256625740918784 2018-02-12 03:40:50 UTC <girlnasty22> @MarkDavidAnder9 Love your pic....this has got to be one of mine.....both show the classless pig that is our @POTUS!...@realDonaldTrumppic.twitter.com/ldnw1tL1E3
963254017139736577 2018-02-12 03:30:28 UTC <girlnasty22> @ananavarro The movies " Sleeping with the Enemy" with Julia Roberts and J Lo's "Enough is Enough" come to mind here...pretty boys courting/ preying on beautiful women only to take total control of their lives. Great movies with excellent endings. Real life not so easy

I would hope that it goes without saying that those of us like myself & the male trumps who make assholes of ourselves daily, should never fear for our innocent family members.

963207585808576512 2018-02-12 00:25:58 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNNPolitics @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC time to realize Jefferson was a hypocrite: a slave owner who said all men are created equal.

962396101369147392 2018-02-10 18:41:25 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN I guess he slipped that in there between the vaccine for cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS and helping the Eagles win the SuperBowl!
962392289321541633 2018-02-10 18:26:16 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @reeria49 most of the garbage that comes out of a televangelists mouth is idiotic, but this gif is absolutely disgusting, and this abuse is certainly far worse than much of what has come out recently.

962390787060191233 2018-02-10 18:20:18 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN Sorenson's letter is definitely a compelling read, which lays out a pretty good rebuttal to any charges, worthy of further investigation. So why on earth would anyone resign? #MeToo is not a weapon, #YouToo have rights!

It was a blatant lie to cover trump's ass and cement his future!
962380610135142400 2018-02-10 17:39:52 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @Dbrasco37 @_aen1gma And yet you elected this disgusting slime ball to the highest office on the planet even when he proclaimed his guilt to the world.....stupid is as stupid does....Porter will rise from the ashes too!
962379421750460416 2018-02-10 17:35:08 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I don't know about the validity of this statement....memories seem to be short and true allegations and self proclaimed disgusting behaviour by trump himself fell away like water off an eels back
962376937619431424 2018-02-10 17:25:16 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump @Lawrence @smickable I just wonder is there anybody on this planet dumb enough to think that this vile, lying, conman meant one word of what he just read!
962180587367776256 2018-02-09 04:25:03 UTC <girlnasty22> @FoxNews Yeah trump can certainly relate to this brave American's sacrifice and sense of duty....he himself suffered from excruciating bone spurs that left him on the sidelines much to his chagrin!

This Goof grilled HRC for 11 hrs over a misstatement. And trump has told nothing but lies for 2 yrs(min.) ...no danger in his testifying?
957727050193764352 2018-01-28 21:28:17 UTC <girlnasty22> Hard to believe someone tweets"As magic does ... its never free...

The friendly tones of Halle Berry's or BB King's skin invokes no fear, unlike the frightening face of Harvey Weinstein.hindsight to the soul?

954043790259466240 2018-01-18 17:32:19 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN Ahhh yes another example of America's short memory. I guess all the bleeding hearts for Nielsen have forgotten the 11 hours of verbal abuse and bullying of HRC by Gowdy and his gang at the Benghazi hearings. If Nielsen can't take the heat for being a trump surrogate....MOVE ON!

949450792997601281 2018-01-05 01:21:23 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS44 @realDonaldTrump @lbcapt It's nice to be nice but Obama's was from a stagnant standing start trump's was from a constantly rising market.
949449902160986112 2018-01-05 01:17:51 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump Wait till someone in your family gets sick....you'll get real tired of trump winning and you and everyone else losing!
949449082531020800 2018-01-05 01:14:35 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @TahaniWanis Where were you? under a rock?
949447805004742656 2018-01-05 01:09:31 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump I'm old enough to remember my Dad's record losses in 2001 and 2008 when the market fell 700 points in one day!..then came Obama & the steady rise ever since, now that the rest of the country knows what I knew two years ago about Donnie Dementia it'll be dj vu all over again

949306691471855616 2018-01-05 15:48:47 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @dmartosko @PdxPatriot1 What is the purpose of a High Anglican or Catholic Priest swinging  a pot of smoking incense? What does speaking Latin have to do with Jerusalem or people born and living their entire lives in Palestine. Why did Jesus suffer under a Roman ruler? Why do folks think Jesus was white
949303983482351616 2018-01-05 15:38:01 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @dmartosko @PdxPatriot1 And if the bible is the word of God why did it take a thousand years to write but she/he hasn't added or amended since. Why did he hand Moses the tablets then send Jesus to save mankind. Why do the Jews (the children of God) not believe in Jesus? Too much drama!
949300833220403201 2018-01-05 15:25:30 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @dmartosko @PdxPatriot1 You fear God because you think you will not be allowed into the mythical place called heaven if you don't obey a bunch of conflicting words and stories collected over thousands of years....but you are already here!
949299903959728128 2018-01-05 15:21:48 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @dmartosko @PdxPatriot1 The only thing religion breeds is hatred. The words of the bible a Quran are similar. The disbelievers why not leave them be. Why did the Jesuits need to destroy North American native children. The term "God Fearing" is an oxymoron...fearing God? What kind of God is that?
949298523530342400 2018-01-05 15:16:19 UTC <girlnasty22> @PdxPatriot1 the last thing in this world I hate is men, my father was a real man, strong , handsome, intelligent and loving he raised three sons who are all wonderful fathers and brothers. I hope to find a man like any of them. Men like trump degrade all men as whores do women. No koolaid !
949295083152539649 2018-01-05 15:02:39 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @dmartosko @PdxPatriot1 Regardless of what you think of him, watch the movie and try to find any sense or credibility with the histrionics of religion, any religion!

949184930818375681 2018-01-04 07:44:57 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @dmartosko @PdxPatriot1 Please don't! If you want to do something for me, watch Bill Maher's movie "Religulous" and then pray for all the prayers...thx
949184086651752448 2018-01-04 07:41:35 UTC <girlnasty22> @PdxPatriot1 Melting? I'm cool as a cucumber! I just can't see how any woman could support this misogynist pig, women are nothing but a piece of ass to this conman..he's even spoken of his own daughter this way!I wish you the best..but you worship two entities that treat women as chattel
949177869602668545 2018-01-04 07:16:53 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @dmartosko @PdxPatriot1 You mean your Lord that gave us this past hurricane season, the California wildfires, African famines, children starving to death all over the world, and suffering from cancers, and saw fit to take the 26 six year olds shredded by automatic rifle fire...that God? Don't bother!
949176425461956608 2018-01-04 07:11:09 UTC <girlnasty22> @PdxPatriot1 If you really are a woman and not some c**t mongrel like trump you're not winning anything! In fact you're a disgusting loser....have you no shame? Associating yourself with this vile tub of sub-human bile. You're a disgrace to woman hood, I have nothing but pity for you!

948814610701869056 2018-01-03 07:13:25 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN It is without equivocation that I say: donald j trump did not utter one single word in that statement and anyone who thinks he did also thinks his inauguration crowd was the largest in the history of the country....period!
948797258203475969 2018-01-03 06:04:28 UTC <girlnasty22> @Reince @dmartosko @cdcooksey I find their astounding incompetence completely credible!

948794112475480071 2018-01-03 05:51:58 UTC <girlnasty22> @DonaldJTrumpJr @dmartosko Sorry dip shit....there's no room left under the bus...and we're not buying your bullshit. But don't worry we hate Bannon because if it wasn't for him trump would not be @POTUS and likely on his way to prison, that will take a bit longer now!
948791772666187776 2018-01-03 05:42:40 UTC <girlnasty22> @marklevinshow you don't get what this country is about...my uncle lost the nerves in both feet to jungle rot in the swamps of Vietnam came home and got treated like shit..trump dodged the draft, danced & pussygrabbed at Studio 54 and you made him @POTUS...he's a Patriot?...again  f**k you!
948764214914531328 2018-01-03 03:53:10 UTC <girlnasty22> @CarolHLN I think Melania is okay....shes on the other side of that...she's got a good lookin boy friend and Billions of dollars!
948763608434929666 2018-01-03 03:50:46 UTC <girlnasty22> @CarolHLN That's Our President! Doesn't he make you so proud to be an American......every woman in the country should be SCREAMING #METOO right now!

But can you make a different face when listening to people...I know you want to look interested to what they're saying but we know you're not...either that or go have a good shit!
948754158722498560 2018-01-03 03:13:13 UTC <girlnasty22> @williamlegate @virgoprincxss Just like the trumpions over at Walmart.....so cute!

948742616631226369 2018-01-03 02:27:21 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump ...Hopefully that brain tumour you've been battling the last few years will have Ernest Angley'd itself before then....you've embarrassed yourself and our country enough for one year.....and we're only 3 days into it!

948739100730736640 2018-01-03 02:13:22 UTC <girlnasty22> @DonaldJTrumpJr There is absolutely nothing honourable about working in that zoo called @WhiteHouse ...it would be like cleaning chamber pots for Henry the 8th!....oh and did I mention you're a spineless little ball of slime!

948731180001603584 2018-01-03 01:41:54 UTC <girlnasty22> @RWPUSA @CNN I believe God's plan for having Michele run for president was to expose her imbecility to America and herself! Either that or she/he was just feeling a little puckish that day!https://twitter.com/rwpusa/status/948388793043881985

The rest of the world should be demanding de-nuclearization of these two idiots, and give them a couple of HRC's reset buttons to play with!
948620597755461632 2018-01-03 18:22:29 UTC <girlnasty22> @IngrahamAngle I can fully understand Sessions' recusal....it looks like the kidnap victim was a relative!

948244850926694400 2018-01-02 17:29:24 UTC <girlnasty22> @nytimes @jaketapper @leslietfj For every woman that knows how to "fight and win"...there are 3 that choose to "submit and win" look at all our sisters that voted for trump and Roy Moore....is today's society conducive to changing this behavioural pattern? Do you ever listen to today's music and lyrics?

947635285822619648 2017-12-31 01:07:13 UTC <girlnasty22> @terribxo_ @frankbeuken And every state under Islam on the planet!
947632758200745984 2017-12-31 00:57:10 UTC <girlnasty22> @terribxo_ @ianharty96 The people of Iran are imprisoned by Islam...and it's medieval, horrific treatment of women, it will never change as long as a Muslim man can control every facet of his wife's, Mother's, sister's and daughter's life! MSM is non existent there, like trump wants for us!
947627343568179200 2017-12-31 00:35:39 UTC <girlnasty22> @jihadwatchRS @terribxo_ @CNN @FoxNews so sad that a handful of lunatic religious zealots was able to return a thriving forward thinking country back to medieval times ruled by fear and fairy tales drafted by murderous perverts and pillagers. The weakness of the human intellect.
946907956620115968 2017-12-29 00:57:04 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @jihadwatchRS @statedeptspox Well I hate to sound like a bad sport....but if all the people over there that are burning American flags stood up to the so-called government there they wouldn't need any help from the rest of the world!

946885225933443072 2017-12-29 23:26:44 UTC <girlnasty22> @maggieNYT @DLind It doesn't take much to see that trump has no clue what he's talking about, he wants to make immigration merit based...in itself has some logic, but not admitting the families of our brilliant new minds smacks of idiocy. What decent "rocket scientist" will leave family behind?
946882745959047168 2017-12-29 23:16:53 UTC <girlnasty22> @greta @scadick I guess it's not a question of what they've lost...but what they have gained for so many of us over the past two centuries....or do you want us to go back and Make America Great Again? Back to #GreatAgain just exactly when was that?
946879869144645632 2017-12-29 23:05:27 UTC <girlnasty22> @greta @EqProCls4Monk ...why are you assuming what the founding fathers "meant"? They had dictionaries, why didn't they use the word "humans" instead of "men" or just say men and women. I love it when people assume what other people "mean". trump has a whole host of such interpreters, all wrong!
946877409730502656 2017-12-29 22:55:41 UTC <girlnasty22> @greta Well Greta...if you're standing in a rainstorm you may say it's a horrible day, or you might say it's a glorious day, or possibly it's a beautiful day depending on how much you enjoy the elements...but you can't state " it's not raining"...that may invoke a negative response!
946873587327164416 2017-12-29 22:40:29 UTC <girlnasty22> @greta all good Greta! But regardless of political stripe or personal opinion.....you can't have a different view of the truth or the facts...they are unarguable!

943891774723866624 2017-12-21 17:11:50 UTC <girlnasty22> @AsraNomani @Asmi1121 ...Lets face it, religion is what has kept women in servitude and second class status for centuries...Whether it be Islam or Christianity....men and women are created equal but not in God's eyes....stop being "God fearing" and be "humanity loving"!

942985161875931137 2017-12-18 05:09:17 UTC <girlnasty22> @alexburnsNYT @CNN Well that just proves what a lousy judge you'd be. Because never has anyone ever been less qualified to get a lifetime position on the bench, when in two decades you never saw the inside of a courtroom. You don't get to fly a jet with 2 decades of experience in a VW!
942961806544314368 2017-12-18 03:36:28 UTC <girlnasty22> @DonaldJTrumpJr @CNN @JuddLegum it really is quite sad that nobody ever told junior the difference between a cake and a big cookie...oh well the nut didn't fall far from the tree...in response to the question...everything!https://twitter.com/juddlegum/status/942564578575122432

941697896260419584 2017-12-15 15:54:09 UTC <girlnasty22> @paul_patrulescu Thank you for your concern.....but you and your pussygrabbing pig of president can go f**k yourself! If you want to feel sad, feel sad for the United States of America, the greatest country on earth until you elected this sub-human POS!

941565270212067329 2017-12-14 07:07:08 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @paul_patrulescu Good thing Churchill stayed with the old policies and didn't allow Hitler to take over Europe. What part of ENEMY do you not understand? or are you one of trump's much loved "porlee edgikated "
941563838536728576 2017-12-14 07:01:27 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN ....Lightweight fake advisor to @POTUS, Omarosa, who was not long ago "begging" for a job in the @WhiteHouse (and would do anything to get it) has resigned and threatened a tell all book..being bad to trump!

941354038989168641 2017-12-14 17:07:47 UTC <girlnasty22> @KirstenPowers @CNN Well said Kirsten....but one must consider the fact that men think with the little head by nature. They revel  in the fantasies of John Wayne movies with him spanking women and idolize the Frank Sinatra s and Johnnie Carsons of their youths
941347823026499585 2017-12-14 16:43:05 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @KellyannePolls @FoxNews @celsosalromero If you're one of the lucky ones you'll get $1200 a yr tax break .....you can treat yourself to half a Starbucks  to start each miserable day while trump installs and shits in a new gold plated toilet, on his tax deductible private jet!
941345020652556289 2017-12-14 16:31:56 UTC <girlnasty22> @POTUS @KellyannePolls @FoxNews You're really reaching here...average middle class family $1200/yr? 3 bucks a day is laughable..trump and his billionaire club, billions of dollars for trains planes and automobiles oh & gold plated toilets. Economy is strong..trickle down doesn't work, rich get richer! Dream on!

941003260000845825 2017-12-13 17:53:54 UTC <girlnasty22> @IngrahamAngle Yes! And while talking out of his ass like Ace Ventura.....the shame of repugnicans supporting him will live on forever!    BTW the margin was 21,000 according to my calculations

940764092733718529 2017-12-12 02:03:32 UTC <girlnasty22> @williamlegate @goldengateblond Yeah and if you were too stupid to get there on time remember what that brilliant Alabamian once said        "shit happens".... "life is like a box a chocolates, ya never know what yer gonna get" ....unless of course yer smart enuf to read the box!
940762424671653888 2017-12-12 01:56:55 UTC <girlnasty22> @IngrahamAngle As one of the most intelligent Alabamians once said "Stupid is as stupid does!....life is like a box a chocolates, ya never know what yer gonna get" let's hope it ain't Roy Moore!
940760565739393029 2017-12-12 01:49:32 UTC <girlnasty22> @News3LV I guess my only comment is: who gives a flying f**k?
940667527151067136 2017-12-12 19:39:49 UTC <girlnasty22> @JohnBerman I don't think a grammar lesson is going to help.....trump thinks people calling for him to resign are actually wanting him to re-sign....

940659439157133312 2017-12-12 19:07:41 UTC <girlnasty22> @WhiteHouse Buckley's full of shit, millionaires don't build there businesses with tax cuts, they pay low wages &hire more people, they're too greedy to share the wealth, look at trump a low minimum wage supporter. He'd rather shit in a gold plated toilet than give employees a living wage!
940655375107342337 2017-12-12 18:51:32 UTC <girlnasty22> @Lawrence Obviously the only thing he learned at Wharton (the school his Daddy paid off to graduate him) was how to profit from going bankrupt!

938969506054995974 2017-12-07 03:12:30 UTC <girlnasty22> @rebeccagberg @brianstelter @CNN I don't have a great deal of respect for someone who put up with all that abuse for years and then spilled her guts, sued and got 20 million after they fired her! Just doesn't sit right when many gutsy women walked away with nothing but their self respect
938821071905603584 2017-12-07 17:22:40 UTC <girlnasty22> @jaketapper @SenatorBaldwin WRONG!

938804927685541888 2017-12-07 16:18:31 UTC <girlnasty22> @benshapiro @erichmcelroy The problem is everyone has a short memory....trump relies on that and waits every ugly situation out. And sure as hell a everyone forgets what an asshole he is...until the next time. Franken is actually doing good work...just don't accommodate any more photo requests!
938803792480419841 2017-12-07 16:14:00 UTC <girlnasty22> @benshapiro @CNN @FoxNews @POTUS @SenSchumer I would take that one step further and have Franken say he will resign if trump and every other "handsy " politician in Washington does the same. If they did, only the women would remain!
938802256341635072 2017-12-07 16:07:54 UTC <girlnasty22> @ChrisCuomo The problem in the Franken case is that he spent years as a comedian doing outrageous skits, like the photo where he doesn't touch. All other allegations come from women who "asked" to have a photo and like our eccentric uncles, his hands innocently landed in the wrong spot
938795486563131392 2017-12-07 15:41:00 UTC <girlnasty22> @williamlegate @CNN @FoxNews ....I am so proud to be a citizen of the United SHATES...and have this alzheimic, bubble brained clown as @POTUS.

934104340100399104 2017-11-24 17:00:04 UTC <girlnasty22> @NewDay I think we all need to remember that Alabama voters is the state that gave us George Wallace for 4 terms as governor regardless of his political stripe he was never worthy to govern....trump's porlee edgikated will do what they do
934100539536633856 2017-11-24 16:44:58 UTC <girlnasty22> @TGJRecording Douchebag! Learn to spell....a bible thumper who can't spell Proverbs "hath no delight in understanding"!

931190870048628736 2017-11-16 16:02:58 UTC <girlnasty22> @williamlegate trump keeping quiet about Roy Mallboy Moore's perverted predation of teenagers makes his pussygrabbing exploits look like normal behaviour for a good healthy young man....so limbo for Moore!
931182698088906752 2017-11-16 15:30:30 UTC <girlnasty22> @realDonaldTrump @CNN @FoxNews more evidence that trump is a f**king dotard. He spent a week on his jet stopping over in 6 Asian countries for photo ops and glad handing. Now he has saved the USA. What an idiot!...and incidentally that's exactly what each leader said as he exited!
930616138291015681 2017-11-14 01:59:12 UTC <girlnasty22> @AC360 @KirstenPowers @jimsciutto @Acosta @jaketapper @CNN @CNNPolitics @wolfblitzer @donlemon @ananavarro @MooreSenate I love watching your crew!

929781340026806272 2017-11-12 18:42:00 UTC <girlnasty22> @hlfuller68 Good grief! You're completely out of whack with reality! Many of the Left are Godless but they're not hateful &judgemental.

929768624717307904 2017-11-12 17:51:29 UTC <girlnasty22> @hlfuller68 If you think there is no such thing as Christian Supremacists give this a read. Right is right wrong is wrong!

929763924336979970 2017-11-12 17:32:48 UTC <girlnasty22> @AnnCoulter @FoxNews Annie it's nice that you are employing Americans. Don't fall off that self installed pedestal that you've placed yourself upon regarding your relevance. Nobody gives a shit about your classless,hateful rhetoric. Walk freely, people may pity you but you're.as safe as any of us!
929755358037385216 2017-11-12 16:58:46 UTC <girlnasty22> @hlfuller68 It's about common decency, just as the catholic priesthood is full pedophiles and perverts hiding in the shadows of piety, so is the Moral Majority. These are not just hateful allegations, they are the insights  into a broken child's soul. Your God will judge him harshly!pic.twitter.com/FyGLbsctvC
929752198530994176 2017-11-12 16:46:12 UTC <girlnasty22> @hlfuller68 So if he was smart enough to just say he won't dignify it with a reply and shut up about it, it would go away. "Methinks he doth protest too much". There won't be a trial as limitations long expired. You believe what you want, but like Swaggart and Baker he's guilty as sin!
929750260896768002 2017-11-12 16:38:30 UTC <girlnasty22> @hlfuller68 No such thing as a Christian Supremacist? Look around you with your FuxNews, repugnican party &the evangelists. Those bible thumping self important, intolerant blowhards all believe that they & their religion are superior to every other sector of the earth's population!
929569166276702208 2017-11-11 04:38:54 UTC <girlnasty22> @hlfuller68 She can describe the label on his tighty whiteys, knew exactly where he lived &how long it took to get there,she can describe the inside of his house, it has nothing to do with politics,he's a Christian Supremacist like Jim Baker, Swaggart & many others hiding behind the bible!

And go away!
929412633496731648 2017-11-11 18:16:54 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN Word of mouth hearsay testimony from a 2000 year old collection of decades worth of crib notes! Brought forward by another Christian Supremacist hiding behind the book filled with approvals, fear mongering and intolerance
929410015609339904 2017-11-11 18:06:29 UTC <girlnasty22> @elainaplott @CNN @FoxNews the age of RoyBoy is dropping & the teen's rising as this controversy evolves.

929049000656830464 2017-11-10 18:11:57 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @hlfuller68 Did the first teenage girl you tried to fondle come and tell your employers of your clumsy indiscretions? Remember he's a Christian Supremacist their bible tells them that puberty is the go zone! And a 20 yr difference is irrelevant...Sorry...thoughts on PREYERS

929039805756817408 2017-11-10 17:35:25 UTC <girlnasty22> @ChrisCuomo @CNN He is a bible thumping Christian Supremacist who has blatantly displayed the Ten Commandments yet bears false witness and practices unholy intolerance...like so many repugnicans!
929036982239444992 2017-11-10 17:24:11 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @FoxNews the real problem with the repugnican party is it's Falwell-esque Christian Supremacy and the notion that their failings have god's blessing, quoting scriptures rather than laws.

928879072184123393 2017-11-09 06:56:43 UTC <girlnasty22> @PressSec @Acosta @estern839 Moore is a Christian Supremacist who as a young mancarved the Ten Commandments on a redwood, later in stone outside his courthouse, part of the moral majority and yet he will lie and bear false witness to the death, just like trump!

928876468368580608 2017-11-09 06:46:22 UTC <girlnasty22> @PressSec @Acosta Sounds like Moore's reprehensible act and the young girl's ensuing self loathing already ruined a life!

928704082105090048 2017-11-09 19:21:22 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @aymanndotcom Thank you!
928703826755911681 2017-11-09 19:20:21 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @aymanndotcom I too have seen the words and teachings of these good men and women.....but we live in a world who in many cases believes the rhetoric of fools like trump hence the proliferation of hatred and intolerance
928702750732427264 2017-11-09 19:16:04 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @aymanndotcom I agree. The jihadists skip all the loving portions of the Quran as do the Christians who believe in "an eye for an eye" sadly these holy books are compiled over centuries consumed by war and chaos and much is out of context. Thank you for your documentary.
928700605345939456 2017-11-09 19:07:33 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @aymanndotcom There are zealots in every facet of life and religion. Unfortunately they feel they are doing God's will. Right or wrong and if a Muslim is contrary to the intolerance they to become a non-believer in the zealot's eyes. Just my observations so you can understand my confusion.
928699313437286400 2017-11-09 19:02:25 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @aymanndotcom I don't profess to be a scholar on Islam, but I have read much of the Quran, and have come to the conclusion that the overall concept leans toward intolerance. Christians ignore much of the Bible too but it doesn't call for jihad against non-believers.
928694634275942400 2017-11-09 18:43:49 UTC <girlnasty22> @brookefoxnews @foxnewspolitics Okay! A dispute about grass clippings and leaves was actually about a man blindside tackling another, breaking 6 ribs which ended with them both lying in the grass clippings and leaves! Now I've got it
928692139386531840 2017-11-09 18:33:54 UTC <girlnasty22> @CNN @aymanndotcom @cnn my confusion on Islam is the fact that 99% of Muslims ignore the doctrine of intolerance as specified &required in the Quran? True followers jihad against the infidels. Such contradiction! How can Islam have both?https://twitter.com/exmuslimsofna/status/928683841937649666
