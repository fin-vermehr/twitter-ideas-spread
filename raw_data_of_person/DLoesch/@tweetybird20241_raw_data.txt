So, if a neighbor or family thinks you are off, cops take you gun and off to be evaluated and then prove your ok before your gun gets returned. Dems not saying a word
967047630617444352 2018-02-23 14:44:56 UTC <tweetybird20241> @RealAlexJones @PrisonPlanet What bothers me most is legislators working to give local police authority to take anyones guns away they deem a threat or mentally unstable. In other words, if your neighbor thinks you are off key, call the cops, seize your firearms and your off to be evaluated. This is wrong
967047046086709249 2018-02-23 14:42:37 UTC <tweetybird20241> @Lrihendry What bothers me most now is that our govt is considering giving police discretion to determine if you are mentally unstable.

However an 18 year old trained to fight and kill (in my mind) is mountain peaks more responsible to be armed than a tide eating snowflake. Age being the issue, needs to be coupled with context and appropriate training.

964682612576079873 2018-02-16 02:07:12 UTC <tweetybird20241> @robreiner @SenFeinstein Ive had AR 15s in my life for over 40 years. The only thing Ive slaughtered with it was a target down range. Whats the matter with you? Work on stopping the slaughter of 650,000 innocent babies every year. And stop importing illegal voters
964681897765933056 2018-02-16 02:04:22 UTC <tweetybird20241> @robreiner @BarackObama Put the mouse back in your pocket you has been. There is no we for you anymore

Like the one that prevents him from illegal drinking. But then again illegal to me has meaning. Not so much with others
964680513364615168 2018-02-16 01:58:51 UTC <tweetybird20241> @robreiner How many babies are killed each year and you are silent about that?
964680296087150592 2018-02-16 01:58:00 UTC <tweetybird20241> @robreiner What Did Obama so about Russian meddling?  Oh thats right he weaponized the security agencies to spy on American citizens who he viewed as his enemy. In other words he knew Russia was meddling and did nothing. Could you be anymore dismissive?

No confidence
964550671759560705 2018-02-16 17:22:55 UTC <tweetybird20241> @DrMartyFox @forevermomodu I think when BHO uses a tragedy to pretend he cares, the vitriol opposition you see just wants him to shut up. He doesnt seem to have the decency to know when hes being a narcissist full of irony. Obama is a has been. We all are well over him. He should fade away with dignity

Sorry guys thats not the end game. Your liberal jobs are not to complete failure. Your jobs are to progress this nation. Something you are simply incapable of
960939376250408960 2018-02-06 18:12:55 UTC <tweetybird20241> @dbongino @RepAdamSchiff intel comm role is to provide oversight to our institutions. He is not a general commanding troops to win a war. Hes pathetically off base and in deep over reach. Im calling on House Maj leader @SpeakerRyan to solicit his removal due to agrressive overreach
960889888953561091 2018-02-06 14:56:16 UTC <tweetybird20241> @newsmax @PatriotCarole45 Obama weoponized all security departments His greatest challenge was military. If you observed how many Generals he went through. The IRS Lerner was weaponized. Benghazi commissions, with Rice running interference, State department, DOJ with Holder and Lynch, FBI all of them
960887038085095424 2018-02-06 14:44:56 UTC <tweetybird20241> @FoxNews @JoanneKMcD @peggyl308 @V_Lady_V_ Liberals Ive found are statistically worthless. Most smart ones decide to step out of darkness, not by debate. But by quietly observing the environment. If its unwise to resist then they slide quietly to the better. Its when they realize they do have humility
960704742287605760 2018-02-05 02:40:34 UTC <tweetybird20241> @seanhannity Hey @SenSchumer youre right he is the worst man to ever hold office because hes done absolutely nothing wrong. Hes not even responsible for exposing you and your cronies. Hes just been there listening to your crap day in and day out. More integrity in his little finger

959488275135246337 2018-02-02 18:06:45 UTC <tweetybird20241> @realDonaldTrump @ericbolling @CareerPlanPro First one yes but FBI failed to properly renew after 90days. This renewal should have happened 4 times. Comey just signed it at each renewal and NEVER took it back to FISA court for approval. He is guilty of fraud. The court guilty of negligence
959487553199116295 2018-02-02 18:03:53 UTC <tweetybird20241> @realDonaldTrump @ericbolling @brynn_9514 No- if you read carefully it was required. But youll also read that Comey renewed it with his signature only never going back to the judge. This is the FISA court systems failure but also a low life walk by Comey. Hes guilty of fraud and should immediately be indicted
959486561032261632 2018-02-02 17:59:57 UTC <tweetybird20241> @realDonaldTrump @ericbolling The fact that the FISA Warrant was renewed 4 times without new supporting evidence of probable cause leaves the warrant unchecked and that Fraud Comey exposed to a federal fraud indictment. @Comey  You still want to quote poetry to us Jimmy?your cell is being prepared

959410471383257088 2018-02-02 12:57:36 UTC <tweetybird20241> @DevinNunes @NancyPelosi @Rosenchild Then Ill call your experience a complete waste of taxpayer money. The only names revealed in the memo are well known FBI pig sticks
959410003118624769 2018-02-02 12:55:44 UTC <tweetybird20241> @DevinNunes @NancyPelosi What national security was exposed? I mean if you mean using a dossier to secure an illegal FISA warrant against an innocent American citizen, then yes those boys over reached and need to be exposed, fired and cleaned out. Nans your idiocy knows no bounds
959239714426548226 2018-02-01 01:39:04 UTC <tweetybird20241> @DineshDSouza Interesting - what does the FBI think the dossier and the FISA Warrant did when they used it? What does the FBI think would happen if by some fluke their whitewash of Clinton crimes actually passed to presidency. No FBI u dont get to say it could be a crisis. U already caused it

We have Sean Hannity to thank for revealing all this. His crew with Sarah and the rest uncovered this crime

959151303275499521 2018-02-01 19:47:45 UTC <tweetybird20241> @FBI @SaraCarterDC If POTUS would just release as is. Release and let the cards fall where they were first played. Against our POTUS against our constitution. No redactions. What this out of control DOJ AND FBI are doing to POTUS is illegal. Mattis needs to throw them out and block their phone call

Notwithstanding that anyone has to pay anyone for water over the bridge. Who made reparations to the holicost victims. It is what it was. Get on with life it was world war.
959049281691947008 2018-02-01 13:02:21 UTC <tweetybird20241> @dbongino It is indicative of how Obama ran the ship. Corruption at its core. The IG was blocked by Holder so he could pass F&F with Obama. That set a precedence for blocking and releasing records for the next 6 years and beyond. Obama is a literal shit stain on the fabric of our nation
959048509289877504 2018-02-01 12:59:17 UTC <tweetybird20241> @FiveRights A director that has the backbone of jello does not need to be in office. Id say with this being the second threat to resign, Hey we dont need you so lets take the threat off the table right now. NOT NEEDED

958855401444921345 2018-01-31 00:11:57 UTC <tweetybird20241> @GiannoCaldwell The Dem party has visualized their very essence to America last night. That they dont care about anyone but themselves. Not the blacks, Hispanics not military not poor the downtrodden not hurting people or perseverance. All they want is - to stay in office by any means possible

Being a common resource doesnt make you important although Im sure she tries to make her life as a staffer a big resume bomb like she has here. Not everyone is as easily impressed. My desire is to hold OBAMA accountable for his crimes. All of them
957715380721586176 2018-01-28 20:41:54 UTC <tweetybird20241> @TaraSetmayer You were nothing more than a staffer. So you heard and saw things. You were never a decision maker stop tooting your horn

957403909584236545 2018-01-27 00:04:14 UTC <tweetybird20241> @chuckwoolery There isnt one thought from a liberal that makes sense. Not one

You can damn sure bet one way or the other the asshole would be out. I feel the same if it was my neighbor. Problem is Democrats dont care about me or my neighboorhood
957279556599209985 2018-01-27 15:50:06 UTC <tweetybird20241> @dbongino Theyd be screaming if any of this started happening to liberals. Whatcha what happens when indictments start getting passed out

What I DO NOT agree with is keeping a class of people on the stereotypical plantation making excuses up for fraud. This whole thread started with that. Im fed up with the moronic liberal excuses of life. Its tired and many poor people are tired too
949862172129185792 2018-01-06 04:36:04 UTC <tweetybird20241> @realDonaldTrump @DSTspring85 @JasonSaramak1 Remember Iraq used purple dye after the vote. Some people in this country want to keep folks in their neighborhoods on that bigoted racist track and prefer disappearing ink

That they have no dignity not even the wherewithal to muster the responsibility of citizenship itself. They love their stereotypes & aint nothing gonna change
949850177950699521 2018-01-06 03:48:24 UTC <tweetybird20241> This does end the voter ID discussion.https://twitter.com/concernedctzn14/status/949847527863578624

He uses sarcasm and MSM is just too stupid to realize his tweets are actually ridiculing them. Hes as sane as 100 Bob Acostas

949833953715748864 2018-01-06 02:43:56 UTC <tweetybird20241> @realDonaldTrump @DSTspring85 @allforchange You need an ID to legally get your food stamps. They need to know who you are when you apply for them. Whats done with them after they are released is based on honor. Some people have no honor. And mostly it seems the stereotype continues people on food stamps will abuse system

The only thing ridiculous here is the claim anyone in this nation is disenfranchised. Voter fraud is real. I need an ID to buy my gun you need an ID to prove you have a right to challenge my right

949710063614222337 2018-01-06 18:31:38 UTC <tweetybird20241> @TomFitton I love love love seeing this liberal boomerang.   Nothing is sweeter than sitting back and watching this dose of vitriol Trump & supporters have tolerated this past year, than watching liberals being forced to swallow their own vomit. If you think thats harsh Uve not been alive
949672080282390528 2018-01-06 16:00:42 UTC <tweetybird20241> @kwilli1046 Let me feed your known corruption with 150BN and enable that corruption to stop

949637294453075968 2018-01-06 13:42:29 UTC <tweetybird20241> @realDonaldTrump @DSTspring85 Liberals cheat and multi vote at the polls rampantly. Corruption flows free on these lame arguments every election. Intellectual dishonesty to say someone that wants to vote is being prevented to do so based on proper ID. I need an ID to do just about anything vote is basic need
949635966691573760 2018-01-06 13:37:12 UTC <tweetybird20241> @realDonaldTrump @DSTspring85 No one is forcing anyone to pay to vote. But we are forcing you to prove you are a citizen. If that mandates a program to provide free ID cards because all other ID requirements needed today are such a violation of rights then free IDs it is. Cheap way to get there
949635172223340545 2018-01-06 13:34:03 UTC <tweetybird20241> @realDonaldTrump @DSTspring85 How does anyone live in our society. You need an ID to get food stamps

949634213543899137 2018-01-06 13:30:14 UTC <tweetybird20241> @realDonaldTrump @DSTspring85 What about OBAMA forcing all those people to pay for health care when they couldnt even afford the premiums. Your argument is weak and completely phased out of historical value. If you cant get an ID your life is over anyway dont bother
949633119950442496 2018-01-06 13:25:53 UTC <tweetybird20241> @realDonaldTrump @DrAyeshaNaveed Thank you oh Dr of know it all. Dont you need to be a vet in Pakistan prior to working on humans?

947703409569947650 2017-12-31 05:37:54 UTC <tweetybird20241> @davidjchie @Comey @clayforsberg Wrong Clay boy. Some leaders pretend some have genuine intent. They never succumb to a boss puppeting them into calling things what they are not. Or changing terms to protect others.   Comey stinks so do all his conspirators and boss puppeteers

They are a business not news anymore. If it pushes ratings up from the low they are at right now they consider it a win. Stupid advertisers dont see an out.
