937176238111756288 2017-12-02 04:26:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @KamalaHarris Sounds a lot like what the Democrats did for Obama Care. They passed it without knowing what was in it...
937171470836518912 2017-12-02 04:07:45 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU Poor QB play, special teams, & players not falling on fumbles contributed to this lopsided loss. Miami needs better from these areas in order to be successful. Hopefully next year...
937169917295636480 2017-12-02 04:01:34 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MarkRicht Good season Coach. Poor QB play and special teams have hurt us the last two games. Please address these areas next year. GO CANES...
937157518039617536 2017-12-02 03:12:18 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU another bad call by the refs. The jersey was pulled not the facemask...
937146390920290304 2017-12-02 02:28:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU Rosier stinks, he can't hit the broad side of a barn...
937139034031378434 2017-12-02 01:58:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU @MrKoivisto We need a new punter. Who cares if he is a legacy...
937138510984818690 2017-12-02 01:56:46 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU what was that crap with the first down. The Clemson runner was down a half yard from the line to gain...
936666286809124864 2017-12-01 18:40:19 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU @Mark_Schlabach Wow, shocking since Fisher was supposed to be Bowden's air apparent. One bad season and he is bailing on FSU...

936246203909537793 2017-11-30 14:51:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU Great game. The Canes played very well in a tough venue. I see them moving up to 7 or 8 in the NCAAM poll.
936245180524646400 2017-11-30 14:47:00 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CanesFamNews @doug_silverman I think the loss of Herndon is the worst of the bunch. Hopefully Michael Irvin, Jr can pick up the load.
936244826579853313 2017-11-30 14:45:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CanesFamNews Oh, but Clemson gets a pass by CFP Committee for their QB1 going down to an inferior opponent. #BeatClemson
936048272996741120 2017-11-29 01:44:33 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SavannahGuthrie U have lost what little credibility u have by standing up for Matt Laurer. I don't care that he is a friend, but that he has committed a horrendous act. U should feel for the victims.
935680382866948097 2017-11-28 01:22:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU I want Miami to win, but if we lose the Canes have definitely exceeded expectations this year and an Orange Bowl berth would be awesome. We also won the Coastal Division for the first time ever.
935679409268412417 2017-11-28 01:18:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BadgerFootball @OU_Football @AuburnFootball @ClemsonFB @CFBPlayoff I agree with the top 4 and the order. I would have put GA at 5 & Bama at 6. GA is playing in a championship game & timing of losses matter. I am rooting for all underdogs: Miami, GA, TCU, Wisconsin.
935666868081385472 2017-11-28 00:28:59 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU I don't think a 2 loss Clemson team gets in. There will have to be a TCU and OSU win for that possibility to happen. Anything's possible...

934969970525696000 2017-11-26 02:19:46 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU @JackAlt12 Yes, we will have to find other options at TE with Herndon out. The Canes play better when they are the underdog.
934969565464989697 2017-11-26 02:18:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @OU_Football @ClemsonFB @CanesFootball @AlabamaFTBL @CFBPlayoff @Willieeem I don't think so, not this year. Bama has a SOS that is 61st & best wins against a 3 loss LSU & 4 loss Miss ST team.
934966917252689920 2017-11-26 02:07:38 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @steelers plz stop throwing the ball inside the five yard line. U have the best back in the, league feed him the ball.
934920179578032129 2017-11-26 23:01:55 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @OU_Football @ClemsonFB @CanesFootball @AlabamaFTBL @CFBPlayoff @Willieeem Also, I could care less about an injury to a QB. Pure copout & should not matter, they still have a defense, correct? Miami has had a ton of injuries & didn't get special consideration as they were still winning until this past week.
934919580782419974 2017-11-26 22:59:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @OU_Football @ClemsonFB @CanesFootball @AlabamaFTBL @CFBPlayoff @Willieeem Plz stop, u r coning into this conversation way too late. Miami has not had a cupcake schedule that would be Bama ur talking about. Miami has exceeded expectations this year & has had a good season. We will see how they do.
934811296792481795 2017-11-26 15:49:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CanesFootball @CollegeGameDay @mancal71 Agree with the first response. It wasn't the play calling at all. Malik was missing wide open receivers & special teams put Miami's defense in bad spots all game.
934810237319680000 2017-11-26 15:45:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @OU_Football @ClemsonFB @CanesFootball @AlabamaFTBL @CFBPlayoff @Willieeem @RichSavage_101 Nice comeback 4 days after i said it and before Miami lost.
934668237266186242 2017-11-25 06:20:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU Its gonna be cold and we can't afford to be sluggish on offense or we will get blown out. Our defense can shut Clemson down by stopping the run and QB scrambles. Force QB to throw the ball.
934667491086880774 2017-11-25 06:17:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CanesFamNews My guess is Bama is #6. There SOS is 61st & best wins are to a 3 loss LSU and 4 loss Miss St team.
934665689096388608 2017-11-25 06:10:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU @JackAlt12 Ur right the SOS is 61st. My guess is they will drop to #6 and unfortunately for Miami, I think we drop to#7.
934664481665318912 2017-11-25 06:05:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU Having lived in Columbia, SC for 8 years and worked for the State of SC for 3 years. USC is the Univ of South Carolina....
934663443730268160 2017-11-25 06:01:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @HeraldSports Well in light of what transpired today. Miami could have been #1 had they taken care of business at Pitt.
934482831924957184 2017-11-25 18:04:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CanesFamNews In all honesty Miami has exceeded expectations this year and whether they get into the playoffs or not, they have had a great season & brought the fan base back.

933143958837964800 2017-11-21 01:23:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CFBPlayoff @ClemsonFB @CanesFootball @ESPNUonSiriusXM They got it right in my opinion, but I would also support Wisconsin at 4 after beating Michigan and moving OU down to 5.

933142025846906882 2017-11-21 01:16:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CFBPlayoff @espn U do realize that OU lost to Iowa State who is a 7 - 4 and at home. No excuse OU is lucky to be in the top 4. No way they are above undefeated Bama or Miami. Nice try...

They couldn't keep them out after Notre Dame win. I predict Miami moves up to 2 and Clemson drops to 3. Both 1 and 4 stay the same for now.
933066371822387207 2017-11-21 20:15:33 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU How about both Alabama and Clemson losing this weekend. Both have away games in tough environments against good teams...

930817190126907392 2017-11-15 15:18:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NOTSportsCenter @AlexHarcher @atv_outfitters I agree with that and to be honest I didn't think Miami would be in the position they are in. Especially the way they played early in the season, but they are peaking at the right time.

930648512160727040 2017-11-14 04:07:50 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NOTSportsCenter @AlexHarcher It shouldn't matter if a player is injured during a game. Miami lost their #1 RB for the year. Miami is going to beat Clemson & all this discussion will be over.

922649531572998144 2017-10-23 02:22:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Jeff_Erickson Those passes need 2 go 2 Jordan Reed. He is still dropable at this point.

919713994285383680 2017-10-15 23:57:58 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FFballWrapUp @MySportsUpdate Shoulve have never happened. I have KC defense and this BS TD killed my team.
919713140157419520 2017-10-15 23:54:34 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Michael_Fabiano Me too. I had Peterson on the bench and Kamara in the flex.
919711873729253376 2017-10-15 23:49:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @theScore YES, they did...  Ball crossed the goal line.
919603074192244736 2017-10-15 16:37:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ESPNCFB NO, why did clemson only drop 3 spots & lost to a team they were 23pt favorites over?
919602122475343872 2017-10-15 16:33:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU Also, ask why Rosier didn't run in the TD and later in the game 2pt conversion as he had a lane...
919601554692493318 2017-10-15 16:31:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BackThePolice Thoughts and prayers for his family.

919600917896417280 2017-10-15 16:28:38 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU My guess is Miami moves up to 7 or 8...
919600598038777856 2017-10-15 16:27:22 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU Would love 2 see it, but Georgia is looking really good. I think they would crush Miami.
919600356425904130 2017-10-15 16:26:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill No problem, ratings will continue 2 drop and NFL will become irrelevant.

919327642414968832 2017-10-14 22:22:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU Why isn't Rosier running it in on the 2pt try. Again another open lane.
919323274701672449 2017-10-14 22:05:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU Rosier had a lane to run it in.
918851791013457920 2017-10-13 14:51:53 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller Its crazy that this SOB still has a job when he alienates over half of the country. Who watches this bum...
918850553802829824 2017-10-13 14:46:58 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller If the player feels that strongly then find another job. U are not guaranteed anything in life.

918598210414882816 2017-10-12 22:04:14 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld Ur all wrong. The players are employees of the Cowboys and therefore must abide by Jerry's rules. They can protest on their own time.
918311719646257152 2017-10-11 03:05:50 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @GavinNewsom I disagree Gavin. The press should be held accountable for false reporting. People are hurt by these false stories.
918310911483568128 2017-10-11 03:02:37 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @YahooNoise I picked up Cam Newton off waivers as Russel Wilson is on a bye in a 12 team half pt ppr.
918310056034209792 2017-10-11 02:59:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FFB_247 @carnicious_d I would say Diggs do to injury, but Jordy also hurt. Injury report may settle this 4 u. I would sit Diggs.

917828734836756480 2017-10-10 19:06:37 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill How funny that @HillaryClinton took four days to denounce Harvey Weinstein, but claims to support women. Such a hypocrite.

917506744728858630 2017-10-09 21:47:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BaseballGuys is Elijah McGuire a good waiver pickup 4 rest of the season (PPR) Deep league only other options are: Mack, Breida, or Darkwa.

914490778944143360 2017-10-01 14:02:46 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FSUFootball @NoleOtherWay This year is different. Have u watched FSU play? They should have lost yesterday if not for the last second TD.

914489346807533568 2017-10-01 13:57:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @EmpoweredYouth @BBBSMiami @KSTiLLS U might get more support if u stop the nonsense & stand during the National Anthem. U can't have it both ways. Thanks for ruining the Fins.

913486946823020544 2017-09-28 19:33:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Broncos Obviously u don't know what ur talking about. Colin himself said that it was about the flag during his infamous August 2016 rant. Look it up

913053318615896064 2017-09-27 14:50:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BaseballGuys who is Ajayi's backup? On the Dolphins depth chart Damien Williams is listed as the backup, but I hear Kenyon Drake is backup?
912947276066230272 2017-09-27 07:49:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Michael_Fabiano @TheKtrain85 Take it.
912945718586937344 2017-09-27 07:43:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld No way, inconsistent offensive and defensive play. I predict the GB packers from the NFC when healthy and the JC Chiefs from the AFC.

910676037050277888 2017-09-20 01:24:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @kilmeade As a Vet and patriot, I loathe the statue and anthem protests. They r ruining our country for what. Libtards preach tolerance but show none
910667064695812097 2017-09-20 00:48:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @skb_sara McCain has always played both sides against each other. He is not a true conservative.

910296708734693376 2017-09-19 00:17:02 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill Tolerance at its best. Liberals ask 4 tolerance, but refuse to give it 2 those that disagree with their beliefs.

909092193666813952 2017-09-16 16:30:43 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RapSheet Will Collins ascend to be fantasy worthy in a ppr?
909090103057944579 2017-09-16 16:22:25 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RotoViz @ffkylethekid @FFdeJENerate Thoughts on picking up Alex Collins called up & Langford cut. Other RBs avail: Perine, Lat Murray, Mack, McKinnon, Sims, Drake in ppr.
909087789366603776 2017-09-16 16:13:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> I chose Clemson to win the Clemson vs. Louisville game this weekend. Who's your winner?https://cards.twitter.com/cards/1ite9/4sn1v
909085104554807296 2017-09-16 16:02:33 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Jeff_Mans is Alex Collins or Jeremy Langford with a speculative pickup in a ppr league. Would drop backup TE.
908868907783610368 2017-09-15 01:43:28 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Michael_Fabiano who 2 start: Alvin Kamara or Paul Perkins in a 14tm ppr & half point per carry league with bonuses for 100yrds rush/receiv
908868356853440512 2017-09-15 01:41:16 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller Curt Schilling called her & Bomani Jones out as racists on Hannity last night. From what I have seen & heard from her, I agree.
908865059530706944 2017-09-15 01:28:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @footballdiehard @TroyThibodeaux1 Yes, I am a huge Dolphins fan, but think Ajayi is overrated. He is already having knee issues.
908864523297271808 2017-09-15 01:26:02 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Jaguars @Titans @NFL Titans will win. Jags week one was great, but against weak O-Line. Titans have one of the best O-Lines in the NFL.

908817147916378112 2017-09-15 22:17:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FFdeJENerate need help at Flex in a 1pt ppr and half point per carry with 6pt TDs & 5pt bonus over 100yrds: Paul Perkins or Alvin Kamara
908491393231982592 2017-09-14 00:43:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MikeClayNFL More like 9 - 6 Cincinnati...
908452046243803136 2017-09-14 22:07:00 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill Funny how ESPN suspended Linda Cohn & fired Curt Schilling 4 doing less. She still has a job because she is black. That's the truth...
908449300094619653 2017-09-14 21:56:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Akbar_Gbaja @Michael_Fabiano I like the Brees side of the deal...
908145496828641280 2017-09-13 01:48:53 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @daverichard Is it safe for me to put Kamara in my flex over Paul Perkins in a 14tm ppr
908144437792051200 2017-09-13 01:44:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics Wrong, electoral college ensures that all 50 States play a role in electing the POTUS. A few heavily populated States shouldn't elect POTUS.

908109956691496961 2017-09-13 23:27:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RapSheet Doesn't matter unless they address that dreadful O Line.
908104874205872129 2017-09-13 23:07:28 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN Plz stop, no one will be watching because we already know why she lost. It all boils down 2 her being a liar, corrupt, and not relatable.
908096298196389890 2017-09-13 22:33:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @WhitlockJason @foxandfriends Yes, report on sports not politics. Sports is our break from politics.

908087898104385537 2017-09-13 22:00:01 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CoryBooker @RoseAnnDeMoro Germany provides healthcare for all, but Germans also pay 50% of their pay in taxes. We can't afford that in the US.
908081257141215232 2017-09-13 21:33:37 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @gmfb @Panthers @PSchrags @nflnetwork U must be joking. The played the Niners in week one. Wait until they play better offensive teams like the Saints, Bucs, etc.
908048242050572288 2017-09-13 19:22:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TommyG ESPN also fired Curt Schilling.
908046535035899904 2017-09-13 19:15:39 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders @docdanielle @sasha1yr I can answer that with an emphatic "NO". McCain is getting state of the art healthcare at the Mayo Clinic. They don't recognize Obamacare.
908045883656327168 2017-09-13 19:13:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders @docdanielle U politicians think we r all idiots, but I have news 4 u. Single-payer doesn't work. Someone will have 2 pay 4 it. Who u, no probably me...

907307567797424128 2017-09-11 18:19:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @KamalaHarris I agree, but their have been many false claims of sexual abuse recently & accusers were tarnished as a result. Process needs 2 b fair 4 all.

906705556337029120 2017-09-09 02:27:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MikeGarafolo @gmfb @nflnetwork Anderson would be better. Cam didn't look good in preseason.
906703261012566016 2017-09-09 02:17:57 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @herfantasyfb @SiriusXMFantasy I don't get the Doug Martin votes as he is suspended and wasn't going 2 play.
906681826055524352 2017-09-09 00:52:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FFdeJENerate I have Robbie Anderson on my bench as well. Just looking for depth or bye week gill ins.
906638056857448448 2017-09-09 21:58:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> #FFNow Paul Perkins, Darren Sproles, Jamaal Williams, or Paul Richardson in a 14tm ppr, half pt per carry league.

906570076907868160 2017-09-09 17:28:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FFdeJENerate do u like Paul Richardson or Kendall Wright in a ppr as a bye week fill-in. I also own Doug Baldwin.
905611454560309248 2017-09-06 01:59:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @KamalaHarris Why r u so hell bent on supporting dreamers. They get free college and benefits that Americans don't. Stop the madness.
905609619367755776 2017-09-06 01:52:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @scott_pianowski I got Ertz in the 8th round of a 12 team half point ppr. I was the last to draft a TE.

905185683136016384 2017-09-05 21:47:39 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @KamVTV The way Trump is rolling back all of Obama's so-called achievements is awesome. Obama's legacy in ruins...
905151787870670849 2017-09-05 19:32:57 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @footballdiehard So stick with Williams. Only have one spot available on bench. Thx
905149803264438272 2017-09-05 19:25:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @footballdiehard Thanks Bob, stick with Wiiliams or pickup Conner or Breida. I have both Bell and Hyde. Do u believe in stashing backups or best player?
905101237649072128 2017-09-05 16:12:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld Wrong argument in this case as Osweiler as bad as he is. Returning to a team that he knows the playbook and at a huge discount.
905100662232449025 2017-09-05 16:09:48 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FantasyPros @MitchellRenz365 14 team PPR, .5pt per carry, & 5pt bonus for 100 yards rushing/receiving. Flex: Perkins or Sproles

905077940928557057 2017-09-05 14:39:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @AdamSchefter Is Langford worth a last round flier in a friendly RB environment in Baltimore? What's the probability he makes active roster & passes West?
904908722190909440 2017-09-04 03:27:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @footballdiehard thoughts on picking up Langford for future upside or Jamaal Williams for depth at RB?
904905599531573248 2017-09-04 03:14:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FFdeJENerate thoughts on Jeremy Langford in Baltimore. Worth a flier?
904839944677543936 2017-09-04 22:53:48 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FFdeJENerate I wasn't tracking Robinson, but the other two are taken. I was thinking Williams 2 replace DeAndre Washington & Kendall Wright 4 backup TE
904838303224127488 2017-09-04 22:47:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FFdeJENerate best late round RB flier: Jamaal Wiiliams, D'onta Foreman, or Matt Breida. I have Hyde as my RB2.

904713963862183936 2017-09-04 14:33:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @YahooNoise I got Tate at 55 in a 14tm ppr.

904067040507564032 2017-09-02 19:42:33 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FFdeJENerate I'm with u on Hyde. In earlier drafts I was able to snag Hunt late, but his ADP is now in the thirties.
904025210931830785 2017-09-02 16:56:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FFdeJENerate draft tomorrow, taking Bell at #2. Hopefully get a top side out at #27. RB2 Hyde or Kareem Hunt. .5pt per carry, 14tm ppr

841444985199300611 2017-03-13 00:24:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller Fake News, he was fired as has been done the last four administrations when the party in the WH changes. He refused to resign.
841438970173128705 2017-03-13 00:00:58 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @ThatCoolBlkNerd he only signed the Bill passed by the NC legislature. That's his job as Governor to sign Bills passed.
841438100471570432 2017-03-13 23:57:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @oreillyfactor doesn't affect me as I am on TRI-CARE and a disabled Veteran.
841303358317182976 2017-03-13 15:02:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @SenJohnMcCain stop focusing on the wire tap and the fact that the transcript of tap was leaked. Obviously Trump was wire tapped...
841119691728965633 2017-03-12 02:52:16 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BernieSanders a lot of healthcare problems could be avoided if ppl ate right and exercised. Make ppl do that & health costs would b lower.
841115754342805504 2017-03-12 02:36:37 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> Doesn't matter 2me as I don't watch that garbage anyways.
841033526283816961 2017-03-12 21:09:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @PreetBharara @AGSchneiderman I'm shocked that your such a partisan hack &  conveniently forgot that Bill fired 90+US Attorneys
840679033205596161 2017-03-11 21:41:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @seanhannity @oreillyfactor @foxnewspolitics @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP @HouseGOP why hasn't this been covered Hillary collusionhttps://twitter.com/steph93065/status/840628026836570114
840558755205042176 2017-03-11 13:43:18 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @POTUS @LouDobbs I guess it's time to stop supporting @Nike 4 their politicizing of sports. Already stopped watching @espn
840557660466470913 2017-03-11 13:38:57 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @zerohedge @RightWingAngel I used to buy @Starbucks products & make my own Caramel Mocha 4 my wife every morning, but stopped in Dec 2016
840556287414980608 2017-03-11 13:33:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @IngrahamAngle where is Brian Williams moral authority, making up stories to get attention. He is the epitome of Fake News.
840555253485428736 2017-03-11 13:29:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller @MaxineWaters is an out of touch buffoon who is as wacked out as @NancyPelosi   both need serious meds and 2 retire.
840554462246780928 2017-03-11 13:26:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN don't care I know a lot of ppl who have boycotted @Starbucks 4 their weak political views & get our coffee at their competitors.
840553134422384644 2017-03-11 13:20:58 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @d_b_myers your delusional and should seek professional help. Just like @CNN fake news u have no evidence only speculation.
840552639209328640 2017-03-11 13:19:00 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN who is @zacposen & who give a sh!+ who he dresses.
840552083073953793 2017-03-11 13:16:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolinancy @NancyPelosi  should still retire as she is not in her right mind
840551168623443968 2017-03-11 13:13:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill ALL TRUE @jaketapper
840412774807281664 2017-03-10 04:03:14 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @DanDassow resign 4 what? Oh, because u don't like him.
840412433697116160 2017-03-10 04:01:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill what about Fast & furious, Benghazi solindra, etc.
840402669655187456 2017-03-10 03:23:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @newtgingrich @seanhannity yes, immediately.
840401860662054912 2017-03-10 03:19:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @newtgingrich @seanhannity absolutely, start over with those that support @POTUS agenda.
840401266438217728 2017-03-10 03:17:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill sounds like @NancyPelosi is jealous that she didn't get an invite to bowl.
839877347583148032 2017-03-09 16:35:38 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller be careful @rhondarousey as u r on a losing streak that will continue if u mess with the Donald.
839876911304179712 2017-03-09 16:33:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> I've requested a #EmmaWatsonReminder for #BeautyandtheBeast's opening week!  Get your own now!https://cards.twitter.com/cards/qfd92l/3jir8
839876808933838851 2017-03-09 16:33:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MKANTONIO1 she's an Obama partisan no matter what the topic is.
839876297547464704 2017-03-09 16:31:28 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico i beg 2 differ; again with these polls that only dems are replying. Sessions did not lie & answered what he understood of question
839650398365433856 2017-03-08 01:33:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @wikileaks @FoxNews lies, lies, lies we already know that meta-data is collected & Americans are scooped up in the net...
839649972358365184 2017-03-08 01:32:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill obviously Flynn was tapped while talking 2 Russian Ambassador & then transcript was leaked which is illegal on Americans.
839648761722859520 2017-03-08 01:27:19 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @VanJones68 @Trevornoah @CNN messy truth according to who, Mr. Whitelash against a black President, yada yada yada...
839648325762711552 2017-03-08 01:25:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CherNOhio @thehill @MeriNOhio care to elaborate on your post, because it makes no sense. Trump employs many more women than Pelosi & Warren
839298409135759361 2017-03-07 02:15:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenateDems read this and shut your mouths...https://twitter.com/thehill/status/839274470766436352
839296466078347265 2017-03-07 02:07:25 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders r u jealous, don't know why as u r also a millionaire with multiple home. How many refugees r u welcoming in your homes?
839295930532757505 2017-03-07 02:05:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheDemocrats fake news, just like the polls declaring Clinton the winner before the election. Funny how dems don't remember Lynch on tarmac
839295479166926848 2017-03-07 02:03:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill what a crock, Obama did the same thing in 2012 and 2015referring to immigrants as slaves, but he was brillant & Carson gets crap.
839294365256273920 2017-03-07 01:59:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill that's great because @AlecBaldwin sucks at playing Trump. Maybe u should play a snowflake liberal. You would probably win an Emmy.
839293473589248000 2017-03-07 01:55:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @LifeZette @IngrahamAngle this is ridiculous, if this happened where I live, u can get I would scream to high heaven & call for firings...
839259884117966849 2017-03-07 23:42:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenJohnMcCain we need 2 expand the CHOICE program & reduce the bureaucracy for payment to providers. Most Vets prefer VAMCs for care.
839259431212843010 2017-03-07 23:40:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @POTUS @SenJohnMcCain he spoke in front of lots of Veterans when he gave his speech 2 increase defense spending.
838914284591669248 2017-03-06 00:48:46 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics @keithellison plz, stop ur whinning & crying as u know this isn't a Muslim ban. U suck so bad u couldn't even beat out Perez.
838911102868148224 2017-03-06 00:36:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics go ahead and do it @ChrisCoons & reap the same backlash that Republicans did when they shut the govt down over Obama's budget.
838909916349886464 2017-03-06 00:31:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics I say no investigation as there isn't anything 2 investigate. All manufactured MSM bullshit.
838582623123435520 2017-03-05 02:50:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FBI how do I explain this, Mr. Comet? Seems 2 me that Hillary knew about the wire taps & this was pushing the Russian narrative.https://twitter.com/kencampbell66/status/838567284616663040
838579376027480064 2017-03-05 02:37:57 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @jaketapper u didn't need proof 2 push the Russian narrative. Do ur job fairly, CNN has become a laughing stock as real journalism is dead.
838574320309964801 2017-03-05 02:17:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill doesn't matter what this fool does as GOP have the votes 2 confirm.
838451374203494400 2017-03-05 18:09:19 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @joelpollak @LindaSuhler @BreitbartNews that's because Pelosi isn't really a woman. She is a shadow of her former self. Term limits.....
838450133784276995 2017-03-05 18:04:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> Doesn't matter whether Obama ordered the wire tap, but he definitely knew about it. No doubt about that. He received briefings on the taps.
838446528612171779 2017-03-05 17:50:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @jaketapper @khalila_ @jahmon u don't know crap. I've held a TS clearance and these leaks of classified into carry jail time. No evidence.
838446121483632641 2017-03-05 17:48:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @jaketapper u obviously didn't need any evidence to push Russia narrative against Trump admin or condone leaks of classified information.
838439923728461825 2017-03-05 17:23:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @marklevinshow @foxandfriends @AntiquarianMuse but MSM fidnt seen 2 need evidence 2 push Russian narayive against Trump admin. Nothing there
838439677417881600 2017-03-05 17:22:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @marklevinshow @foxandfriends @AntiquarianMuse the evidence is classified & will come 2 light with all of the investigations going on.
838401708657094656 2017-03-05 14:51:58 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @marklevinshow @foxandfriends @AntiquarianMuse where's ur proof. Accusations r easy, but providing evidence of ur claims not so easy..
838400724954464256 2017-03-05 14:48:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @marklevinshow @foxandfriends incredible that this can happen in America. That's a pretty strong case against Obama. Prosecute him.
838253949018902528 2017-03-04 05:04:50 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico this is BS, i could care less  Only MSM is pushing this and the leftists fools r fueling in hopes believe this crap.
838247837154619392 2017-03-04 04:40:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CarlieClark @Jbuchanan06 congrats...
838245958811025408 2017-03-04 04:33:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill I agree @AGJeffSession should not have recused himself as he did nothing wrong. Dems r pouncing, get them for taps & slush fund.
838238149176356864 2017-03-04 04:02:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics Fake News, there were 2 FISA requests from BHO admin, 1st denied & 2nd granted. No wrongdoing found, but taps continued.
838235962991869952 2017-03-04 03:53:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @seanhannity we all know why, to spread classified info on Trump Admin.
838235240036433920 2017-03-04 03:50:29 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @husseinjiwani as a real estate agent it isn't smart to play politics as it could hurt your bottom line.
838234787861172226 2017-03-04 03:48:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill oh now, they want proof. Didn't need proof to accuse Trump admin of anything & everything. I agree let's get it out & expose BHO.
838232937833377792 2017-03-04 03:41:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNews what about the pic of @HillaryClinton during the debate with the fly on her nose...
838171134709358592 2017-03-04 23:35:45 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @seanhannity that's what we all want 2 know. I believe Obama was being wore taps & DOJ slush fund 4 activist groups. Bring em down, Sean.
838045909300690944 2017-03-04 15:18:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump @crehage Sheriff Clarke is the man...
838045554089345025 2017-03-04 15:16:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> Wire tapping requires judge approval. There has 2 b a paper trail. Check FBI & DOJ 4 proof. Wonder if Obama has classified info post POTUS.
837855836684845057 2017-03-03 02:42:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill really fake tears @chuckschumer. Stop the madness u r more of a Russian traitor than Sessions. U were good with Lying Lynch.
837855203500097536 2017-03-03 02:40:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @JBusinessNews @nu_reality why now r u revealing this? U r a traitor 2 the USA & should be placed in front of a firing squad 4 past deeds.
837850575740022784 2017-03-03 02:21:58 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RepSeanMaloney @FoxNews @dennyg2 is a partisan back with no proof of wrongdoing. Both Lynch and Holder did far worse and didn't even recuse
837842694504341506 2017-03-03 01:50:39 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BretBaier I think ur fair, as well as most Fox anchors. Shepard Smith on the other hand has gone negative most of the time. I don't  watch.
837836051402063873 2017-03-03 01:24:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill u r all a bunch of fools. There is no there, there. Lets talk targeting of conservatives, Benghazi, fast & furious No investigation
837797273337724928 2017-03-03 22:50:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @baalter @bfraser747 he needs to weed out the Obama holdovers & stop the leaks.
837797049227673601 2017-03-03 22:49:16 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill reap what you sow.
837795147521871872 2017-03-03 22:41:43 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico @POTUS absolutely, investigate Schumer & Pelosi for their engagement with the Russians. Investigate Hillary & Obama 4 the is ties.
837384310231560193 2017-03-02 19:29:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @skb_sara @ComedyCentral I remember that.
837381993503522816 2017-03-02 19:19:59 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> Ur a flake. Stop the nonsense u old haag and do ur job. Get ur party misfits together and work with GOP to solve American issues.
837381086711787521 2017-03-02 19:16:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics no grounds 4 him 2 resign. This is another den attempt 2 undermine Trump. No evidence if wrongdoings. Face it ur party lost...
837378488730542080 2017-03-02 19:06:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @foxandfriends now, why isn't this being investigated? Clearly something wrong happened here. Money should've gone back to the treasury.
837376490945855490 2017-03-02 18:58:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BoLdAnnEA bigger not better. @Oprah has lost her luster and not presidential.
837375996558991361 2017-03-02 18:56:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheDemocrats this is such a non-story. U dems r trying 2 make anything stick at the point. Go play with your playdough, snowflakes...
837106987343175681 2017-03-01 01:07:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ShaunKing @MMFlint @MiamiHerald hey bozo King, Get your facts straight the mission was planned during Obama's term. U no nothing, so sad...
837064273998282752 2017-03-01 22:17:29 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill he should just change his party to GOP and be done with it....
837063845852119040 2017-03-01 22:15:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats this strategy will fail & have the opposite effect. Dems will lose 4 sure. U have learned nothing...
837063370662690816 2017-03-01 22:13:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @POTUS is draining the swamp of career politicans whom have made millions off special interests. Cab alredy rich
836992560312823813 2017-03-01 17:32:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DonaldJTrumpJr @moniquesourdif I would like 2 kick this POS ass, that's how mad his comments made me.
836989929087516673 2017-03-01 17:22:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> Then u and your obstructionist party need to support @POTUS and all Americans will benefit. Otherwise keep whinning & ur party will decline.
836973581875687425 2017-03-01 16:17:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ScottPresler this is why @TheDemocrats @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats r the losing party. What an outrageous & unamerican reaction.
836969829739417601 2017-03-01 16:02:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @POTUS @mskristinawong no, idea who u r, but give the man a chance. He spoke of unity & will accomplish a lot with support of both parties.
836968648334065664 2017-03-01 15:57:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> Great speech, now lift the hiring freeze as it is affecting active and retired Veterans from seeking and retaining employment opportunities.
836950514810007557 2017-03-01 14:45:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheDemocrats numbers looking awfully low on retweets....
836785115749548032 2017-02-28 03:48:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics shocked that @VanJones68 had anything positive 2 say about @realDonaldTrump.
836783310240169991 2017-02-28 03:41:02 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN what a joke of a response. No credibility as the current governor stated that the ACA is failing in Kentucky.
836782602967212033 2017-02-28 03:38:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheDemocrats how can u say that @POTUS didn't stand 4 American rights after that speech. Ridiculous accusation from a failing party.
836756240294363136 2017-02-28 01:53:28 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics I am watching on a real news channel. Never watching fake news again on CNN.
836754430158585861 2017-02-28 01:46:16 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @steph93065 I agree, ICE should be waiting 2 grab all the undocumented immigrants that dems bring.
836753521080995840 2017-02-28 01:42:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN since when do @SenateDems care about spending. Funny that we r over 19 trillion in debt after 8 yrs of Obama.
836394827386351616 2017-02-27 01:57:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill wanna talk about disaster, how about @TomPerez as Obama's labor Secretary.
836393098053828609 2017-02-27 01:50:28 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheDemocrats never gonna happen with so many chiefs in one organization. Hey @BernieSanders Tom Perez is for Obama's TPP.
836390542963519488 2017-02-27 01:40:19 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller this is the same @MaxineWaters that couldn't remember Aleppo or that Putin invaded Korea. Her & Pelosi have lost their minds.
836389705327464448 2017-02-27 01:36:59 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes so funny and I missed it boycotting these ridiculous award shows that only seek to make these elitists feel good about themselves.
836065683330977793 2017-02-26 04:09:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill what a crock of $#!t. He knew the dangers like I did serving 2 tours in Iraq. The loss of life is tragic but can't always b avoided
836062525615636480 2017-02-26 03:56:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> He also supported Obama's TPP.
836058588556701696 2017-02-26 03:41:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders @trademrk not interested in anything Bernie has 2 say. Career politicians looking for there next payday.
836057396074188800 2017-02-26 03:36:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders I have better things 2 do like work. We r not all career politicians with millions in our pockets & own multiple homes.
836057006238797824 2017-02-26 03:34:58 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @jimmykimmel @FoxNews u all knew this was going 2 happen. I chose to watch a movie on cable instead. I skipped all award shows this year.
836054161468899328 2017-02-26 03:23:39 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @W_C_Patriot @skb_sara @jko417 @TruthFeedNews I didn't even bother to watch. Not a single aware show this year.
836053491718230016 2017-02-26 03:21:00 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Megan_Broadway instead of supporting the Oscars, I chose to watch a movie on cable.
835969447743664128 2017-02-26 21:47:02 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders @G1Ben @bernardigiri @bnvsbl funny the guy ur idolizing right now is a millionaire with multiple homes. Don't be fooled.
835969082256162816 2017-02-26 21:45:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders pot calling the kettle black.  Ur a rich guy too & got rich in politics. Ur up to three homes now, plz stop whinning...
835293115472822272 2017-02-24 00:59:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> But the democrats were responsible for the creation of the NAACP, oh no that was the republicans too. Some folks never learn.
835131099386900485 2017-02-24 14:15:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @mcuban Obama & HRC both spoke of fake news and the dangers it exposes. Speak 2 the orgs spreading fake news: @CNN @nytimes, & many more.
835128790263156736 2017-02-24 14:06:34 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> Both of these candidates are good for the GOP. They r too far 2 the left and many independents will go right...
835126627466117120 2017-02-24 13:57:58 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @piersmorgan @POTUS @mcuban @samanthajcampen why r u so concerned about his taxes? Game over, he is the POTUS & that won't change.
835126344585469953 2017-02-24 13:56:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @POTUS @mcuban is the most transparent ever. He is in the news everyday talking to foreign leaders & business leaders. Obama was the least.
835123220793683969 2017-02-24 13:44:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @mcuban still jealous that it's not u in the WH. No one cares what u think...
835122665153310722 2017-02-24 13:42:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> I didn't hear any complaining from celebrities prior to Obama's EC on transgender bathrooms. He served 7 of 8 yrs b4 this EO.
835121035120947200 2017-02-24 13:35:45 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN two-thirds of American oppose this, so tell me again why the loud few have more say than the silent majority.
835120382831177728 2017-02-24 13:33:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN most brick & mortar retail chains now have family bathrooms, use them. Otherwise use bathroom according to which genitals u have.
835119226109243393 2017-02-24 13:28:33 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill the truth according to @nytimes  or the actual truth? They haven't got a sigle story right since @realDonaldTrump began run for WH.
834968703255134211 2017-02-23 03:30:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN a lot of illegals were fired after protesting on a day without an immigrant. R u going 2 take responsibility for any women being fired?
834968048624893953 2017-02-23 03:27:50 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ChrisCuomo u need to speak 2 a professional as I think u have some deep seeded psychological issues that need 2 b addressed.
834963661500395520 2017-02-23 03:10:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN I'm quoting HRC "What difference does it make at this point". Trump is the POTUS and that won't change either way...
834961528520589314 2017-02-23 03:01:55 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics will men who identify as a woman be allowed 2 participate in a day without a woman? Since which bathroom we use is so important
834955580972359680 2017-02-23 02:38:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNews @Zac_Petkanas @TuckerCarlson I am more confused about gender identity now than b4 this segment. Sorry Zac, but u r clueless...
834951217352740864 2017-02-23 02:20:57 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @CaitlynJenn two-thirds of Americans oppose this issue and the cost to remake bathrooms is proposterous. Of all other issues, why??
834932213460389890 2017-02-23 01:05:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> USAA Savings bank reimburses ATM charges, but why not get cash back when making debit purchases at stores, there's no charge for that.
834578232968151041 2017-02-22 01:38:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill is this the same @HillaryClinton that had a rope around her as she walked the streets.
834576549626064897 2017-02-22 01:32:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ChrisCuomo @DanaBashCNN @CNN neither will have any success & will only take the party more left. Therefore independents will move right.
834576170117189633 2017-02-22 01:30:39 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MKANTONIO1 being a Vet and serving in multiple conflicts overseas this BS condition infuriates me. I know many Vets suffering hidden wounds
834406162841927680 2017-02-22 14:15:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill this is fake news, most Americans support @realDonaldTrump. Not sure where they get these stats.
834405337889439746 2017-02-22 14:11:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> I don't get why the left continues this narrative @realDonaldTrump son-in-law, Ivanka converted and grandkids are all Jewish.
834363724114837504 2017-02-22 11:26:28 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics @SenateDems if u stop Obamacare Repeal & Replace them u own it & will surely suffer more loses in 2018.
834363354999296000 2017-02-22 11:25:00 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics @AuthorJackBloom your definition of sane is much different than mine. I don't call violent acts of protest & anarchy sane.
834263317543780356 2017-02-21 04:47:29 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump @matthaig1 so here is where ur way off as the USA is 21.8 times larger than Sweden in square miles. Imagine that...
834259953191940097 2017-02-21 04:34:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ChristieC733 @CarmineZozzora if this is true, then it's about time this anarchist is brought 2 justice 4 his crimes.
834258039507185665 2017-02-21 04:26:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @votevets @VeteranAdvocacy @realDonaldTrump as a Vet & retiree this is affecting my spouse and our move to GA. Get this fixed ASAP.
834257466904965120 2017-02-21 04:24:14 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @cristinalaila1 @skb_sara most definitely. She was coco for coco puffs. These lunatic liberals r so crazy & outrageous.
834250364991991808 2017-02-21 03:56:01 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @YoungDems4Trump @lgmaterna @MLP_officiel now there's a woman with principals. I applaud her courage and standing on her morals.
834250129712504833 2017-02-21 03:55:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders as long as it isn't amnesty. Comprehensive reform and extreme vetting.
834249364050681856 2017-02-21 03:52:02 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill plz take all of our celebrities starting with @lenadunham @Madonna @WhoopiGoldberg @katyperry @AshleyJudd & too many others 2 list.
834248284290039808 2017-02-21 03:47:45 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenateReps @HouseGOP @POTUS don't worry about these small leftist protests & disruptions, the silent majority support u. Keep ur agenda.
834228906710413312 2017-02-21 02:30:45 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TuckerCarlson this chic is nuts. She has no clue on what she is talking about. Trump isn't a racist or Hitler, these liberal lunatics...
834227226853961734 2017-02-21 02:24:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BernieSanders with his ideological utopia of open borders & not enforcing laws for illegals also wealth redistribution 2/2
834226765312712704 2017-02-21 02:22:14 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BernieSanders let's be real, this country has been divided for a long time and Obama further divided the country (1/2)...
834096341798289408 2017-02-21 17:43:59 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @LennyMelnick thanks
834094799095476227 2017-02-21 17:37:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @LennyMelnick better pickup at catcher: Matt Wieters (WAS) or Wilson Ramos (TB)?

833703655220068352 2017-02-20 15:43:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CarmineZozzora @LindaSuhler I don't recall seeing a lot of Obama surrogates on Fox.
833517293908934657 2017-02-19 03:23:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @freeCodeCamp @mcuban what's your plan Mark? Job training programs for changing skilled workers is an option. Preparing for upcoming jobs.
833516563894513664 2017-02-19 03:20:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders there many, many more not protesting & supporting @POTUS. U really want 2 go down this road???
833446699771244545 2017-02-19 22:42:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RealTalkRaph @JoshHayesFS @SiriusXMFantasy I think Todd Frasier will hit more than all of these players.
833189145832927232 2017-02-18 05:39:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @lgmaterna I stopped support @Starbucks & encouraged all of my family & friends to do the same. Shameful company...
833188639995731968 2017-02-18 05:37:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNews I think he is the 44th best president. I didn't like a single thing he did...
833187404429271040 2017-02-18 05:32:11 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders @tonyposnanski no, we had a horrible president who is now gone... Cared more 4 illegals & criminals than citizens.
833186777565368320 2017-02-18 05:29:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders really income inequality, that's why I have been paying more taxes each year since Obama took office. Wealth redistribution.
833186183786160130 2017-02-18 05:27:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders quit trying 2 stay relevant. Ur views were rejected and not warranted. Bye bye Bernie....
833140180169084930 2017-02-18 02:24:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenJohnMcCain as a Vet, I am embarrassed by ur comments. U ever heard of praise in public; discipline in private. Must not teach n the Navy
832803357291053056 2017-02-17 04:06:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @toddarcher @SiriusXMFantasy Houston or Jacksonville or Miami or LA Rams or Jets or Buffalo or KC. Romo is better than current QBs.
832765166639075328 2017-02-17 01:34:22 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> The Fake News Media
832746862968987648 2017-02-17 00:21:38 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @greggutfeld I saw u say that on the Five...
832746486249164800 2017-02-17 00:20:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico absolutely not, as a Georgia resident, I will actively gain support against her.
832647836286218240 2017-02-17 17:48:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> Not surprised if @SenateDems r purposely delaying @POTUS cabinet picks because they know of leaks in advance from Obama holdovers.
832610141182783488 2017-02-17 15:18:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RealJamesWoods I really think that @NancyPelosi should not speak unless she knows what she's talking about. #nocredibilityPelosi
832593619341152257 2017-02-17 14:12:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SecShulkin congrats on your confirmation as a member of your VE team, I am looking forward to continuing 2 improve Veteran's Experiences.
832430282800234496 2017-02-16 03:23:39 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller @TocRadio @POTUS admitted he had a meeting with @RepCummings of CBC, but Cummings canceled because he would suffer politically.
832311179330600971 2017-02-16 19:30:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump great job on today's press conference. As a Vet & former TS clearance holder these leaks r troubling. Prosecute the leakers
832071133646159873 2017-02-15 03:36:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @CNNPolitics @MSNBC @CBSNews what's the difference in this video & what u r alledging about Trump admin?https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/831947451707822080
832068798639439872 2017-02-15 03:27:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews @dukeddt also if your a Veteran like me, u should be outraged that classified info has been leaked to the public.
832068508817174528 2017-02-15 03:26:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews @dukeddt stop spreading fake news. There is no evidence of your claim. Even NYTs in today's paper had no facts only accusations.
832067785652072450 2017-02-15 03:23:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes @Destiny_2218 obviously u weren't concerned about Lynch convening a Grand jury in Clinton's private server, but u r good on this 1.
832066834589442048 2017-02-15 03:19:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @attorneygeneral as a former TS clearance holder & service member, I am troubled by what is happening regarding classified leaks (2/2)
832066483693944834 2017-02-15 03:18:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @attorneygeneral Sessions, please 4 the love of God & Country convene a Grand Jury on leaked classified info to press (1/2)...
831669641013555200 2017-02-14 01:01:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @LaNealNelson @bfraser747 having retired from the Army @sarahsilverman is a libtard with no understanding of how the military works.
831668974450515969 2017-02-14 00:58:29 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @LaNealNelson @bfraser747 that's all liberals have. They are the minority party and party of "NO".
831663108636676097 2017-02-14 00:35:11 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @WLTX I met "Smoking Joe" in PA in 2007, he was a really nice guy.

831660015761104897 2017-02-14 00:22:53 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DanRather @__CanadianBacon @cquillen871 @Kim_is__bored as a former top secret clearance holder that is required training 4 clearance (2/2)
831659668980248576 2017-02-14 00:21:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DanRather @__CanadianBacon @cquillen871 @Kim_is__bored she had classified info on her private server that in itself is against the law 1/2
831659249059168256 2017-02-14 00:19:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DanRather listen here nothing compares 2 Watergate & u insinuating it confirms your liberal bias & wanting 2 b apart of the story. Retire.
831606634648592384 2017-02-14 20:50:46 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RealKyleMorris @KNP2BP thanks 4 pointing this out. I saw this group in action when I was stationed in PA with the US Army
831600426944495616 2017-02-14 20:26:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @lgmaterna funny how they want accountability,  but nothing when conservatives were targeted by the IRS or Benghazi. Give me a break.
831595339522199561 2017-02-14 20:05:53 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats r a bunch of idiots spewing fake news. Pelosi, Sanders, Warren, & Waters are killing the dem party.
831591844169523200 2017-02-14 19:52:00 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @KNP2BP @RealKyleMorris don't forget ACORN during first WH run. I witnessed this dishonest group and voter fraud.
831591067678031872 2017-02-14 19:48:55 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews the sexist NYT's reporter only apologized after being called out for his ridiculous remarks. SICK!!!
831587994326929408 2017-02-14 19:36:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DrDinD @clairecmc @emzorbit that's the difference between dems and GOP. U screw up in GOP u get the boot. Dems don't discipline their own.
831587617288384514 2017-02-14 19:35:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @clairecmc really Senator, what about the lack of credible investigation into Clinton's private email server or Obama's paid ransom to Iran.
831477661046362112 2017-02-14 12:18:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @donald_trump_90 obviously u missed Obama's 1,000 deportations a day. His nickname was the deporter in chief. Check the facts.
831337683448377348 2017-02-13 03:02:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @kelseymsutton not one of these allegations has been proven. #FakeNews
831334074249838592 2017-02-13 02:47:43 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @julieblue917 @lgmaterna the guy she attacked should have layed the snack down.
831329271205527552 2017-02-13 02:28:38 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @SenateDems @SenSchumer    yeah just like HRC's clearance was revoked after having classified info on an unclassified server.
830940572106027009 2017-02-12 00:44:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @jojoh888 @bfraser747 @Joy_Villa @therealroseanne @RealKyleMorris now this act deserves the courage award that Caitlyn Jenner received.
830933130903244804 2017-02-12 00:14:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SpecialKMB1969 not watching those elitists preach as they live behind high walls and employ security details 4 protection.
830570962974281730 2017-02-11 00:15:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> Should start with all of u millionaires in Congress.
830530602797584384 2017-02-11 21:35:00 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders @PhyllisHershkow @mogaffney caucuses with the democrats, but maintains his status as an independent
830530261528018945 2017-02-11 21:33:39 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders u need 2 appeal to middle America, but far leftists like Warren, Elison and Booker r taking the party more left...
830529188423688193 2017-02-11 21:29:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Patriots @michelfaulkner @FoxNews there loss no matter who is @POTUS this could be there only chance to visit the WH. I'll go n there place
830522838452994050 2017-02-11 21:04:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill really @SenWarren or fake Pocahontas wants to call someone else on ethics. Look in the mirror u benefited from minority status.
830521447579779072 2017-02-11 20:58:38 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ThePatriot143 @KamVTV I swear our young people are like mindless zombies. I wonder if they r learning about protest in school or being paid
830435087493787649 2017-02-11 15:15:28 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @veteranstoday @LXammar66 merely pointing out that several recent stories are not factual. No need 2 call me names, I might think ur a lib.
830432269269684226 2017-02-11 15:04:16 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders @petsta he is, Sanders made a fortune off of running 4 POTUS. He owns several very expensive homes.
830431571446489088 2017-02-11 15:01:29 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill WHO CARES!!!! The NYT has not been good 2 @realDonaldTrump, funny he took 1st question from them.
830429362528849920 2017-02-11 14:52:43 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes see @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is right again. Stop doubting his outrageous remarks as time & time again he is proven right.
830428751213260801 2017-02-11 14:50:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @veteranstoday as a Veteran the more and more news I c from u is not factual. I'm putting u in the Fake News Category. Clean it up or block.
830428218775728128 2017-02-11 14:48:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CoryBooker @drmarty2k funny u speak of the constitution, many on the left trample on it, unless it meets their ideological beliefs.
830427664766889984 2017-02-11 14:45:58 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CoryBooker when r u going 2 speak out against the violence that the left is portraying. Its disgusting and many independents r moving right
830194705728208896 2017-02-10 23:20:16 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @IngrahamAngle @JoinLauraNow just wait until someone on the right retaliates and someone gets hurt. This situation is getting very ugly.
830194230568038400 2017-02-10 23:18:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews @shialeboeuf has lost his mind and should be institutionalized. One day, he's going to encounter the wrong person & be squashed.
830162320420659202 2017-02-10 21:11:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> I think it's a sad day when public figures r blocked from doing their job. Imagine when someone on the right retaliates 2 these protests.
829916739563569152 2017-02-09 04:55:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @EricHolder u won't be vindicated when @POTUS collects dollars from CA wannabe sanctuary cities. U r robbing these ppl and can't stop it.
829913365933916161 2017-02-09 04:42:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico there up to five now, keep up...
829912341076652032 2017-02-09 04:38:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenBennetCO @CoryBooker @POTUS funny how no one complained when Obama had a 6 month ban on refugees from Iraq. #hypocriticaldemocracts
829909809487032321 2017-02-09 04:28:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes politics at play, they don't even mention the statute that gives @POTUS the authority 2 protect our borders #riggedcourt
829908327081598976 2017-02-09 04:22:18 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @AGJeffSession repeal the existing EO and make necessary changes for green card holders, etc & reissue new EO. WA & MN wld have 2 relitigate

829713991677181952 2017-02-09 15:30:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenWarren @SenSanders what r ur thoughts on Coretta Scott King thanking @SenatorSessions for the Rosa Parks Library? Exactly crickets...
829713048420106241 2017-02-09 15:26:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders @Sheldonrs obviously we cannot sustain the ACA, it is 1/6th of our budget. Ppl losing docs, higher perms during Obamas term
829712513730097152 2017-02-09 15:24:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders @JustAnotherRich do ur research on a single payer healthcare system. It involves death boards, long wait times, govt bureaucracy
829561602877902848 2017-02-08 05:24:33 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TruthFeedNews @jko417 @skb_sara try telling @ShepNewsTeam that as he called @POTUS a liar on national television.

829556438246838272 2017-02-08 05:04:01 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @foxnewspolitics @seanhannity @oreillyfactor @realDonaldTrump @seanspicer check out this video of Coretta Scott King thanking Sen Sessions
829555766801661954 2017-02-08 05:01:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenWarren have u seen this video. It shatters your goal of ruining @SenatorSessions. U go do better next time fake Pocahontas.https://twitter.com/Thomas1774Paine/status/829375411029213184
829554795883151360 2017-02-08 04:57:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico no, he exposed her for the extreme liberal she is & she knew the rules and broke them. She will bring the Democrat party down.
829554205224468481 2017-02-08 04:55:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BreitbartNews @DonaldJTrumpJr I would also call 4 a boycott of @belk. & @tjmaxx for the very same reasons stated above.
829550930756505600 2017-02-08 04:42:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ScottPresler @steph93065 @timkaine why doesnt @SenatorTimKain1 himself fight in the streets as he suggested, because he would be KO'd
829550294409367553 2017-02-08 04:39:37 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill thanks for sticking up for South Carolinians @SenatorTimScott. I'm a proud Veteran and supporter of u.
829549894767632385 2017-02-08 04:38:01 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @CarmanK1 please provide proof of your claim. Democract Arlen Spector said biggest mistake of his life was not supporting Sessions.
829549296391483394 2017-02-08 04:35:39 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CarmineZozzora I'm calling 4 a boycott of @Nordstrom @belk & @tjmaxx for obvious political reasons. Lets sink there stock.
829548808883286016 2017-02-08 04:33:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ChelseaClinton @HillaryClinton agreed, so glad she didn't get into the WH or we would be doomed.
829548563751383040 2017-02-08 04:32:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Nordstrom @belk @tjmaxx thought u should know that we r boycotting your stores as u play political games. Lets c how low the stock goes.
829547686575611904 2017-02-08 04:29:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill I felt great @SenSchumer & u like Warren should be ashamed of yourselves 4 trying to ruin Sessions when u knew he was a good man.
829545152880451584 2017-02-08 04:19:11 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN big deal as a citizen I have been delayed at airports even subjected to extra screening & I am a Veteran who served 22 years.
829543680759459840 2017-02-08 04:13:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill screw the ACLU as they continue to make our country less safe.
829542423734919168 2017-02-08 04:08:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN funny how @SenWarren never said anything negative about her colleague b4 he was nominated as AG. This is purely political & ridiculous.
829541142672859138 2017-02-08 04:03:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ChelseaClinton @WhiteHouse @HillaryClinton they used Clinton Foundation funds for her wedding and startup money.
829540467029184512 2017-02-08 04:00:34 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes so what, leave FLOTUS alone.
829532565140828160 2017-02-08 03:29:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MerileeParis u do realize the dems opposed the civil rights Bill of 1957 & the KKK was the right wing of the Democratic party @thehill
829531476312068096 2017-02-08 03:24:50 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @tahbarri first of all he wiped the floor with @SenSanders on healthcare @the hill & check history the dems are the party of the KKK.
829523332466933762 2017-02-08 02:52:28 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN big deal. Do we really want Madonna raising children, I don't think she is mentally stable or fit to be a mother.
829522983345672193 2017-02-08 02:51:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @washingtonpost what about MLK's niece. She is against the resistance on the left.
829515998927659009 2017-02-08 02:23:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott need your support to quickly get Gorsuch confirmed.
829408145424449539 2017-02-08 19:14:46 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @AllenWest @CNN should change their name 2 FNN Fake News Network.
829407817501143040 2017-02-08 19:13:28 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @moniquesourdif these morons @NancyPelosi & @MaxineWaters have no idea what they are for or against & is funny to watch.
829406586338672640 2017-02-08 19:08:34 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill I'm glad we can have a civil discussion about our different political views.
829403516359864325 2017-02-08 18:56:22 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill in states that Trump won...
829403452929368064 2017-02-08 18:56:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill I disagree, as dems continue to push against POTUS, he will gain support. Not 2 mention 10 dems up 4 re-election 2018.
829289425616125952 2017-02-08 11:23:01 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill true, but our constitution states that our POTUS is selected by the electoral college not popular vote.
829200564428926977 2017-02-07 05:29:55 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @joelpollak @morganwarstler @mcuban don't b so sure, Obama said his legacy was on the line & we know how that turned out.
829199684551974913 2017-02-07 05:26:25 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill they would lose to a cocker spaniel.
829198850489511938 2017-02-07 05:23:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Rosieod @thehill I would think they would want someone with actual talent. @rosieod
829198400205811712 2017-02-07 05:21:19 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN it's about time someone took a stand to get our country back...
829197817356890112 2017-02-07 05:19:00 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN the truth is @SenWarren u r afraid after Sessions is confirmed that he will actually uphold and enforce the law.
829197253793415168 2017-02-07 05:16:45 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @1Freddycmusic let's be clear, the KKK was the right wing of the Democratic party, plz tell these folks to go back in their history books.
829196719749480450 2017-02-07 05:14:38 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes here we go fake news. As usual u got it wrong. Warren broke Rule 19 and was punished for it. I hate your rag of a paper.
829194803418189826 2017-02-07 05:07:01 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenWarren @CNN BLUF, she broke the rules and received a warning and continued therfore relinquishing her time to speak. End of story...
829190898248454149 2017-02-07 04:51:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @GlomarResponder @steph93065 @georgemackey61 very true, also one term congressman get 100% benefits, Vets at 20 yrs of svc get 50%
829189799886147584 2017-02-07 04:47:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenWarren @SenSchumer r a pack of whinny obstructionists that have no power, but can't accept that they lost big & will continue losing.
829188977362083846 2017-02-07 04:43:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Megan_Broadway already started in South Carolina. I was bombarded over the weekend.
829188411315593218 2017-02-07 04:41:37 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @cciedotnyc @lgmaterna I'm hopeful that @SenWarren constituents will see through her crap and vote her out of office.
829187774603472896 2017-02-07 04:39:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ConservativeLA I think more competition will lower premiums and requiring employers to provide coverage upon employment & portable
829187029766397952 2017-02-07 04:36:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNews which is tough for pilots to maintain their license. They must accumulate so many flight hours to keep credentials.
829186485337350144 2017-02-07 04:33:58 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @JoeDanMedia @steph93065 @Acosta love it!!!
829186305510801409 2017-02-07 04:33:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BernieSanders @SenTedCruz @ConservativeLA single payer is a bad system. There will be death boards and u lose control of ur healthcare.
829185958612520962 2017-02-07 04:31:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenTedCruz congrats on a well deserved victory over @BernieSanders
829185597742907393 2017-02-07 04:30:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenWarren @TheDemocrats @FoxNews if u follow the rules then can speak, if not then STHU @SenatorSessions
829185265738645505 2017-02-07 04:29:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @PCrapidy @steph93065 @ida_fioretti @PattyMurray @SenateDems this was a ransom. The Iranians were told 2 not release b4 funds arrived.
829183698327187456 2017-02-07 04:22:53 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheDemocrats @thehill @tcsorr @Trumpisarussian u have no proof & Obama said the election was fair. Stop trying 2 justify Hill's  loss.
829183139272601600 2017-02-07 04:20:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill there was never a doubt that @SenateDems would stop any of Trumps nominees, they only delay to keep political capital with base.
829182630620966913 2017-02-07 04:18:39 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Acosta face it u have lost all credibility & have been exposed for the fraud you are. @CNN colluded with the Hillary camp & is paying price
829179871343558659 2017-02-07 04:07:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics @SenTedCruz wiped the floor with @SenSanders
829177604401930240 2017-02-07 03:58:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @horowitz39 @steph93065 let's hope these dems pay the price in upcoming elections.
829177329666629633 2017-02-07 03:57:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ScottPresler as I predicted Cruz wiped the floor with Bernie.
829113547594616832 2017-02-07 23:44:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld @HoustonTexans @ChicagoBears  go get McCown as he is a much better than your current options at QB.
829077791815634944 2017-02-07 21:22:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller @seanspicer just call attention to her saying Putin invaded Korea, actually it was Crimea. Enough said, mic drop...
829075939308998657 2017-02-07 21:14:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @SenateDems ur base sees through ur deception as u don't have the votes 2 stop anyone. The @SenateGOP r making u look like fools.

829073143654469632 2017-02-07 21:03:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders doesn't matter as he has career professionals at DOJ to advise him. POTUS has the constitutional authority in these matters.
829072397739368449 2017-02-07 21:00:37 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BernieSanders u must be running out of material as u have posted this same tweet numerous times. Plz stop with the "so called" accusations.
829071702332145668 2017-02-07 20:57:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics no one is talking about the DC sniper who was black or the African American who shot up Navy yard. Thanks 4 making my point.
829071247304712193 2017-02-07 20:56:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics there is a difference between homegrown acts of terrorism & POTUS statutory authority 2 protect our borders from Islamic terror
829069847728381952 2017-02-07 20:50:29 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MiaChandlerGOP @CarmineZozzora she was probably hitting the bottle last night and forget where and what she was doing. zzzzzzzzz SLEEP...
829068743213010945 2017-02-07 20:46:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill I say that is a win not to have to be on @CNN fake news network or Clinton News Network.
829068461812879360 2017-02-07 20:44:59 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill what's hypocritical here is that @CNN can report untruths, but Conway who misspoke & apologized 4 it is not allowed in CNN...
828827735724326915 2017-02-06 04:48:25 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @theScore @KingJames now u know how Trump feels about fake news and false reporting.
828827223205539840 2017-02-06 04:46:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CoryBooker @MITAtoday is jockeying 2 run 4 president, but doesn't have the juice, so resorts to oppressing friends like @SenJeffSessions

828805204338434048 2017-02-06 03:18:53 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @AntonioBrown very profound and inspiring...
828799264402857985 2017-02-06 02:55:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BreitbartNews @varepall sports are an escape and no one wants 2 c political banter in SB. There was enough in commercials.
828798859195404290 2017-02-06 02:53:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNews @SenWarren let's make sure this happens. She is an embarrasment to our Country. All I hear is noise when she speaks.
828797933504122880 2017-02-06 02:50:00 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics NOT LIKELY...

828777504848695297 2017-02-06 01:28:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> Why are they different? I stated that she was weak and provided data to support that claim. She is bold and spews a lot of innuendo no facts
828776703925350400 2017-02-06 01:25:38 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CrockettBuffalo @thehill @SenWarren @BernieSanders http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/06/elizabeth-warren-in-political-trouble-in-massachusetts.html. check her numbers 44% in favor, 46% not in favor of re-election
828770616283107328 2017-02-06 01:01:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @SenWarren is weaker, but @NancyPelosi and @BernieSanders are a close 2nd and 3rd...
828741795693608965 2017-02-06 23:06:56 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenJohnMcCain feedback received from Vets is that they do not like the Choice prgm & prefer 2 go 2 the VA Hosp. Must enhance prgm 4 improvm
828609056025825282 2017-02-06 14:19:28 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller @sarahsilverman it's about time these big mouth elitists are arrested for communicating threats against our democracy.
828594111007567873 2017-02-06 13:20:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics do any of these protectors have jobs? Probably being paid by Soros or on public assistance. Who has the time?
828593065547948032 2017-02-06 13:15:55 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics yes, landing under sniper fire in Bosnia in 1997.
828591840777662464 2017-02-06 13:11:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BernieSanders no, it wasn't. An activist judge wanting to be the focal point of the issue. POTUS has the statutory authority 2 protect USA.
828591338585206785 2017-02-06 13:09:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BernieSanders then confirm Neil, he applies the law as written and a clone is Scalia.

828415083130781698 2017-02-05 01:28:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @IngrahamAngle changed the channel didn't want 2 show support for Gaga. Check halftime ratings.
828412066558046209 2017-02-05 01:16:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> #Pray4DJT here's to our @POTUS and I pray that he continues to implement his agenda guiding by our Lord and savior, AMEN.

828366479905153024 2017-02-05 22:15:33 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @PrisonPlanet @tinastullracing not watching the lame halftime show.
828366198811324416 2017-02-05 22:14:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FFdeJENerate pretty sure that Belichick has game planed to shut Julio down.
828363434873991168 2017-02-05 22:03:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes @AngelaTandarich yes, my tweet had nothing to do with Kellyanne Conway as u indicated in your response.
828356272395268097 2017-02-05 21:35:00 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @sonyclassics waste of my time and .
828354845472124929 2017-02-05 21:29:19 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @impeach_d_trump @Impeach_D_Trump and one term senator who voted present on nearly every vote.
828354625057206273 2017-02-05 21:28:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @impeach_d_trump @Impeach_D_Trump What a crock. U would be called a racist if u were 2 have had an "Impeach Obama" account. He was a community organizer b4..
828353828869267457 2017-02-05 21:25:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders as one who has fought 4 this country, u don't have a damn clue what your talking about. Go away Bernie we r tired of your BS.
828352346967113728 2017-02-05 21:19:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @oreillyfactor thanks 4 the appetizer, would have liked to have seen more than seven minutes.
828351050151297024 2017-02-05 21:14:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @KarenMKunkle who owns @Budweiser weren't they bought out by a Chinese company?
828350708445483012 2017-02-05 21:12:53 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ChristiChat @LindaSuhler @realDonaldTrump disappointed that they only aired seven minutes of the interview.
828342230901473280 2017-02-05 20:39:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump @SenSanders by saying that u r being disrespectful. Why keep this up after the democract party railroaded u 4 Hillary?
828323765905915905 2017-02-05 19:25:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @POTUS @FoxNews we need to have more @realDonaldTrump rallies around the country to counter these whinny snowflakes causing havoc.
828322931126177792 2017-02-05 19:22:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @KatrinaPierson @FoxNews @VeeVee when he was elected. When this rioters start getting hurt then MSM will spin story on innocent protesters.
828322659930877952 2017-02-05 19:21:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @KatrinaPierson @FoxNews @VeeVee u have no sense. This is why liberalism is a mental disorder. This craziness didn't happen 2 Obama...
828321968755720197 2017-02-05 19:18:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @stevennelson899 Hillary brought this on herself with a private email server containing classified info. She should be in jail.
828320489080766465 2017-02-05 19:12:48 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @UCBerkeley @FoxNews stop funding these anarchists immediately. In fact just build the wall and keep CA out and everyone in it.
828317111625846785 2017-02-05 18:59:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill why don't we investigate @NancyPelosi 4 inciting violence with her false narrative every time she opens her pie-hole.
828292250572570626 2017-02-05 17:20:36 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFL if u think ratings were down this year wait til next year. What's with of the political jokes at award show & Gaga for halftime?
828289678688317440 2017-02-05 17:10:22 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNews don't care, will change the channel at halftime. Please someone monitor ratings before, during & after her performance.
828262078527987713 2017-02-05 15:20:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld @dallascowboys makes no sense with Elliot and great rookie year. Must be fake news. Better options: Jags, Jets, Packers, Seahawks
828238592820523009 2017-02-05 13:47:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes @mlamb701 ur wrong, he has the statutory authority 2 protect America. Refugees have no rights only American citizens have rights.
828236297860943873 2017-02-05 13:38:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @washingtonpost again, I can't say this enough, where was the outrage when Obama banned refugees from Iraq & Carter from Iran?
828230398970884098 2017-02-05 13:14:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes @AngelaTandarich go back and read the tweet I responded too. Related to NYT article claiming POTUS business ties.
828117431881199618 2017-02-04 05:45:56 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @bfraser747 @lingling23 @SenateDems or that their beloved JFK voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1957 before becoming President.
828115563255832577 2017-02-04 05:38:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @lingling23 @bfraser747 they r so dumb they probably didn't know that the KKK was the right wing of the democract party..
828114611979350017 2017-02-04 05:34:43 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews FAKE NEWS. Please u have sunk pretty low on this one. This is why no one watches CBS, NBC, MSNBC or CNN...
828113900604375040 2017-02-04 05:31:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller my a$$, @sarahsilverman behind her high walls & bodyguards making terroristic threats. U should fear retaliation of ur remarks.
828113098053672960 2017-02-04 05:28:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill I suggest the Dems all get a health exam, because liberalism is as much a mental disorder as schizophrenia.
828112585824284672 2017-02-04 05:26:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NancyPelosi @PrivilegedVictm unfortunately evil doesn't die. Nancy, Schumer, Soros, Moore, Madonna, Judd; see the pattern
828112095942164480 2017-02-04 05:24:43 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @LeahR77 if this is what it has come to, then I recommend that we the majority of Americans rise up & put an end 2 these anarchists.
828111003430838272 2017-02-04 05:20:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics @ChelseaClinton sorta like Hillary landing under sniper fire during her 1996 trip to Bosnia. The internet never forgets...
828108980794884096 2017-02-04 05:12:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> Failing @nytimes please stop your left winged agenda. Ur bias is so obvious and if u ever get a story right no one will believe u #pinocchio
828103550353940480 2017-02-04 04:50:46 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes @nayaabkay yes it is because of these anarchists preventing freedom of speech. U can't pick & choose all speech is free.
828100602286710784 2017-02-04 04:39:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @JasonTaylor @JameyEisenberg as a lifelong dolphins fan, I am excited to see Jason Taylor in the Hall of Fame.
828100003235299329 2017-02-04 04:36:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics Trump has a legimate reason 2 roast a judge who thinks he can legislate from the bench. Ban is constitutional & will b overturn
828099295861694465 2017-02-04 04:33:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @THR @IngrahamAngle @Eminem is a wannabe artist whose time has past. I used 2 support this elitist when I was younger, but have wised up.
828098809007857666 2017-02-04 04:31:56 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders your so old news, trying 2 stay relevant. Face it Bernie u lost & can't get past it. This travel ban pause will be overturned.
828097184746844161 2017-02-04 04:25:28 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @M_Ryan02 well deserved on the MVP. I have been pulling for you and wish u luck on Super Bowl Sunday.
828095783262109696 2017-02-04 04:19:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill no one is watching Clinton News Network and their fake news. Be careful, Van Jones will hit u with the "Whitelash" remark...
828092919944998912 2017-02-04 04:08:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @markknoller @moniquesourdif @HorsleyScott what's your point?
828090018195451905 2017-02-04 03:57:00 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill the former Mexican President needs to mind his own business. Why give this fool a platform, he is irrelevant.
828086219011682304 2017-02-04 03:41:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller I'm embarrassed that the "Boss" is an American. Move to Canada if so inclined. Wouldn't want to hurt your wittle feelings...
827734546183487489 2017-02-03 04:24:29 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ConstanceQueen8 @DebFreedomVoice @HuffPostMedia good call, don't give the Clinton news network any of your time. They will makeup stuff
827734073745502208 2017-02-03 04:22:36 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller I have been saying this for weeks. Trump will destroy the democrat party as he picks off dem voting blocks with accomplishments
827731422391762950 2017-02-03 04:12:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics I dont know what American ppl u r talking about. Oh wait must be dems that r not happy. He is doing a superb job.
827728440983945219 2017-02-03 04:00:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller yes, we know they are financially supported by George Soros. He should be arrested and prosecuted for damages.
827726429341245442 2017-02-03 03:52:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill funny how none of u snowflakes made a peep when Obama imposed a refugee ban in 2011. Hypocrites and anarchists.
827721662758060032 2017-02-03 03:33:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @GaetaSusan @We_R_TheMedia changing the channel. The ratings will drop significantly during her performance.
827715076752826369 2017-02-03 03:07:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller why in the world hasn't George Soros been arrested and forced to pay for all of the damages that he is funding?
827675415930085376 2017-02-03 00:29:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @steph93065 @TowerofLloyd your an imbisil & obviously skipped class the day they taught on the electoral college. Trump won 33 of 50 states
827660447964868610 2017-02-03 23:30:02 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill good riddance.
827659726167166977 2017-02-03 23:27:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill Obama's numerous trips cost the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Especially, the Hawaii trips every Christmas.
827651533886148608 2017-02-03 22:54:37 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @foxandfriends @DebFreedomVoice changing the channel during Gaga's halftime performance.
827554979347124225 2017-02-03 16:30:56 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @AshleyWarrior @We_R_TheMedia @realDonaldTrump @HUMANCOLLECTOR @Maximinus_King I think they voted for hope & change. Too much change to me.
827547430052831234 2017-02-03 16:00:57 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill so says this privileged brat whose very expensive wedding was paid for by the Clinton Foundation & given a $900,000 a year job.
827547003005583360 2017-02-03 15:59:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller what a joke. This was the infamous Black Bloc group wreaking havoc & violence on ppl exercising their 1st amendment rights.
827546144175714304 2017-02-03 15:55:50 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @PrisonPlanet @LindaSuhler goes to show you how open borders are working and why we need extreme vetting to prevent this from happening here
827544408920883200 2017-02-03 15:48:56 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @HUMANCOLLECTOR @realDonaldTrump @We_R_TheMedia @AshleyWarrior I'm a Retiree and Trump has my support & many active and retired Vets i know.
827531561977405442 2017-02-03 14:57:53 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews @AngeelinaJoIie I am so sick of these hypocritical celebs who didn't say shit when Obama banned refugees in 2011. #boycotthollywood
827530784466681857 2017-02-03 14:54:48 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller if your so supportive @DebraMessing go down there and protest with these anarchists. Get in my face I'm knocking u out.
827529893005115392 2017-02-03 14:51:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @washingtonpost don't know why Conway would give Mr. Tingling feeling up my leg Chris Matthews the time of day.
827357660165074944 2017-02-02 03:26:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @varepall so says a woman who lives behind high walls and a private security team. I have often thought of punching her in the face.
827357318929063939 2017-02-02 03:25:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico @realDonaldTrump @POTUS best way to keep info private is to limit who knows.
827356534455857154 2017-02-02 03:22:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FOXSports @NFLonFOX Michael Jackson. Beyonce had the worst show in the history of the SB.
827355235555368961 2017-02-02 03:17:14 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump I am getting sick of our voices being silenced by mobs of nefarious anarchists. Last nite UC Berkeley tonight NYU.
827353060544479233 2017-02-02 03:08:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @bobsacard @1Freddycmusic VOTE HIM OUT...
827342281204178944 2017-02-02 02:25:45 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FOXSports @NFLonFOX stop hating @ShannonSharpe, I'm a football fan & know the greatest when I see it. He has had success with less talent.
827340024064643073 2017-02-02 02:16:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheDemocrats fake news from your failing party. Its a travel ban from 7 countries identified by Obama. U know he banned refugees in 2011.
827339000314810368 2017-02-02 02:12:43 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes I thought Schwarzenegger had a witty and appropriate comeback. I think Trump should think before he speaks from time to time.
827337853197754368 2017-02-02 02:08:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld @charlesbarkl come on Sir Charles. LeBron is a whinny child when things don't go his way. Call him out when necessary.
827337399491559425 2017-02-02 02:06:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NYCMayor @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews is the biggest buffoon on the planet with a mental disorder called liberalism.
827332282256068611 2017-02-02 01:46:01 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics please someone show me some proof, because this sounds like a witch hunt. Pelosi spews lies as good as Schumer crys fake tears
827331825018224642 2017-02-02 01:44:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Davewellwisher @moniquesourdif @PageSix I don't watch trash on NBC. She made a huge mistake leaving Fox as most viewers will not follow her
827330497294454785 2017-02-02 01:38:56 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @1Freddycmusic the truth hurts and when all else fails they cry and conduct violent acts in retaliation to opposing views.
827324906031476736 2017-02-02 01:16:43 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill Sarandon was a Bernie supporter. Dig a hole and bury yourself, we don't care what u think.
827324144974979072 2017-02-02 01:13:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders the only reason u r trying to stop this nomination is beaciae u r in deep with the teachers union who stand to lose big.
827320986756403201 2017-02-02 01:01:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheDemocrats I disapprove of all of the obstructionists on the left. Your party will be decimated as Trump makes good on his promises.
827320393367162886 2017-02-02 00:58:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill I hope the Dems keep obstructing, because Trump is going to destroy the democrat party as he makes good on his promises.
827319976323379200 2017-02-02 00:57:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @washingtonpost @SenSanders if I'm not mistaken, Trump met with pharmaceutical executives a few days ago 2 discuss cheaper drugs. Late again

826243976831307776 2017-01-30 01:41:29 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @washingtonpost @TheDemocrats still trying 2 spin this outdated story. No muslim ban, 7 countries identified by Obama admin. Ur time is over

826187203051130881 2017-01-30 21:55:53 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @POTUS @DonaldJTrumpJr I would argue that Senator Warren was invoking a riot with her false claims.

826098138503114753 2017-01-30 16:01:59 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SteveKerr I don't recall u voicing your opinion on Obama when he imposed a refugee ban in 2011. U like Hollywood r clueless on middle class
826067362138976258 2017-01-30 13:59:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNewsEnt @CBSNews if Hollywood is so concerned for refugees then take them into your homes or shut your pie holes. No one's listening
826066605377462272 2017-01-30 13:56:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN @POTUS @seanhannity really @SenSchumer was advocating for a refugee ban in 2014 & now weeping like a baby 4 political reasons.
826065723629903872 2017-01-30 13:53:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN @ADCBeast u really think these tools are educated. They r sheltered snowflakes that have high walls and security.

825920260016586753 2017-01-29 04:15:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Appleline1 @moniquesourdif I stopped watching and supporting these leftist elitists.
825920009125896192 2017-01-29 04:14:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @josh_burlingame @FF3535 and Obamas divise rhetoric was okay or his targeting of police, conservatives. Obama banned Muslims in 2011.
825918783684485120 2017-01-29 04:09:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump look at what happened in Canada today it's ironic that they are welcoming all refugees

825905096601001985 2017-01-29 03:14:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RedNationRising @moniquesourdif @SenWarren is delusional,  the EO is not an attack on religion. Where were u when Obama banned Muslims 2011
825898355469537283 2017-01-29 02:48:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller @kaitlancollins but none of these hypocrites said anything when Obama banned Muslims in 2011.

825892251356250113 2017-01-29 02:23:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews since when did muslim become a religion,  so sick of the hypocrisy. Islam is a religion not muslim.
825890351844040705 2017-01-29 02:16:18 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNFEIK @JoinLauraNow of course he is. Do u not think we didn't already know that. Shocked that Clinton News Network is reporting on it.
825889768600981504 2017-01-29 02:13:59 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @washingtonpost I recommend that all of these celebs take in muslim refugees to live with them since they care so much. For Americans.
825888558468698113 2017-01-29 02:09:11 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ANOMALY1 @bfraser747 what a joke, this is how it starts and ends with sharia law. Then these protesters will understand what Islam wants.
825888070859886597 2017-01-29 02:07:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN thx for your input, exactly why I'm not watching this crap. Hollywood needs to entertain not play politics since they are clueless

825886335642767360 2017-01-29 02:00:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheDemocrats hypocrites. Obama banned Muslims from Iraq in 2011 and when campaigning for office spoke of building a wall.
825885006245613568 2017-01-29 01:55:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill because of cheap labor.
825884088913502212 2017-01-29 01:51:25 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MarcasG stick 2 FF & leave politics to the professionals. Did u say anything when Obama had a muslim ban in 2011? Probably not hypocrite.
825883530538401792 2017-01-29 01:49:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill I don't remember anyone protesting Obama or Carter for their muslim bans, oh yeah they were democrats, so it's okay.
825831011829284864 2017-01-29 22:20:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CoryBooker I don't recall u protesting when Obama imposed a muslim ban on refugees from Iraq in 2011. Your a disgrace 2 US
825828881684893696 2017-01-29 22:12:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @ChelseaClinton is building support for her run for office, because she's all that's left of the Clinton machine.
825823642516910081 2017-01-29 21:51:14 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @POTUS @FoxNews @NancyPelosi is a hypocrite who praises Obama's ban of Muslims from Iraq in 2011 for 6 months & now upset. Dem party is done
825820179212988418 2017-01-29 21:37:28 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @DanRather acurate reporting is dead. Obama imposed a ban in 2011 & no one opposed his action.
825817816062361601 2017-01-29 21:28:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSchumer @Deenie65Nadine why didn't u move to impeach Obama when he imposed a ban on refugees from Iraq in 2011 for 6 months. Hypicrite
825775126478209025 2017-01-29 18:38:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @KimKardashian now Kim has joined the protest its all over. I guess we should pack up & go home. No one cares what u think nonceleb
825773721801592832 2017-01-29 18:32:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews @keithellison is wrong, indonesia, Saudi Arabia were not on the list. The 7 countries on the list were identified by Obama admin.
825773081297874945 2017-01-29 18:30:19 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @mcuban Mark read the EO before jumping to conclusions. No ban, just temp pause from 7 countries identified by Obama administration.
825772620079648769 2017-01-29 18:28:29 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @AllenWest @mindrelated @AnjiUsa just read the EO and all will be clear. The liberal left is spinning this to meet their agenda.
825769303630835715 2017-01-29 18:15:18 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @SenJohnMcCain plz vote this clown out or impose term limits to remove this obstructionist & undercover democract.
825768256229224449 2017-01-29 18:11:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico @SenJohnMcCain just change your party affiliation because u are acting like a democrat and being an obstructionist at every turn.
825737079468462080 2017-01-29 16:07:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @washingtonpost I wonder if the republicans spoke out when Obama imposed a refugee ban from Iraq in 2011 for 6 months. Hypocrites both sides
825735673986555904 2017-01-29 16:01:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews @POTUS @DonaldJTrumpJr  funny that the countries identified were identified as state sponsors of terror by Obama Admin.
825573794022559745 2017-01-28 05:18:25 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @jimsciutto @CNNPolitics is this what Clinton News Network has come to. Ppl lie to get attention, so be ready 4 an onslaught of fake news.
825570516907982848 2017-01-28 05:05:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN @MarkZukerberg so where was your concern when Obama banned refugees from Iraq in 2011 for 6 months? Hypicrisy at its best.
825569517661253632 2017-01-28 05:01:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews old news, keep up.
825566390589480960 2017-01-28 04:49:00 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @greggutfeld let us not forget the ban Obama imposed on immigrants from Iraq in 2011 over a 6 month period & ban on Christans.
825533355097784320 2017-01-28 02:37:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics not surprising as left winged liberals have taken over academia.
825532836337840128 2017-01-28 02:35:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @PJStrikeForce @bfraser747 @YahooNews best way to shame this clown is to stop supporting her. Oh I forgot what career, she a has been.
825532566308548608 2017-01-28 02:34:36 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheBeat_Boss @bfraser747 @SenJohnMcCain my thoughts exactly on McCain, but feel different on Graham.
825532172132028417 2017-01-28 02:33:02 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @seanhannity no one is talking about Obama halting immigration from Iraq in 2011 for 6 months. Please fact check and report.
825531272009228293 2017-01-28 02:29:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews please take our celebrities as well. They threaten to leave, but never do. At least Trump does what he says.
825530909826899968 2017-01-28 02:28:01 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheDemocrats @CoryBooker how soon u forget that Obama halted immigration from Iraq for 6 months in 2011. Your partisanship will get u 
825529657269317633 2017-01-28 02:23:02 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @GovAndrewCuomo @POTUS where were u when Obama halted immigration from Iraq in 2011 for 6 months, such a liberal hypocrite.
825528929180082176 2017-01-28 02:20:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @SpeakerRyan in 2011 Obama halted immigration from Iraq for 6 months. Spread the word to silence the opposition.
825527414088413184 2017-01-28 02:14:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @POTUS @mcuban don't be mad because you weren't invited to the table to share your opinion. Wait & see it's coming.
825526970603683840 2017-01-28 02:12:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenJohnMcCain @politico your time as a career politician is over. Stop being an obstructionist at every turn. Support Trump or step aside.
825525048438038529 2017-01-28 02:04:43 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @POTUS @mcuban u have got 2 b kidding me. 68 dems boycotted inauguration & called Trump an illegitimate Pres. So, who's dividing the country
825524067440664576 2017-01-28 02:00:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @AnnCoulter who in their right mind would travel to Iran. Someone wanting 2 be kidnapped 4 ransom or beheaded. No way 4 me.
825522364498710529 2017-01-28 01:54:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @JohnMAckerman @politico no way, Mexico needs the US way more than we need them. Case in point dropping peso and market.
825521900243865601 2017-01-28 01:52:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Austan_Goolsbee @FoxNews that's your opinion. He is doing exactly what he said he would do unlike every other politician in modern history.
825520883263483904 2017-01-28 01:48:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics @KvnCormier @CarolM39 @cuckoopeetrump r u in la la land the dems are in the minority. All I can say is nuclear option, thx Reid
825404957344030720 2017-01-28 18:07:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SensibleTravel1 what's the difference terrorism is terrorism. What's the commonality they have all been radical Islamic terrorists.
825202570834612224 2017-01-27 04:43:19 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @jaketapper @CodeAud @moniquesourdif Tapper is the most liberal and biased reporter next to Mr. Tingly feeling up my leg Chris Matthews.
825199012806541316 2017-01-27 04:29:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CodeAud @moniquesourdif so why isn't media outlets carrying this story? Is this true or fake news?
825195246032138240 2017-01-27 04:14:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller I would love to come across this fool, so that I could slap the taste out of his mouth. No more transformer movies for me.
825193651672317952 2017-01-27 04:07:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @KazeSkyz @moniquesourdif what ban, did u read the EO. It temporarily suspends visa program from countries that have history of terrorism.
825193071503691778 2017-01-27 04:05:34 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SensibleTravel1 u know this how? In case u haven't been paying attention ISIS rose during Obama resulting from failed policy in middle east
825190129048354816 2017-01-27 03:53:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @SenMurphyOffice stop the madness, Obama contributed 2 the birth of ISIS & sat by as they grew stronger and more emboldened.
825187907069681668 2017-01-27 03:45:02 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @CoryBooker u r so far off on this and look foolish even trying 2 say there is a muslim ban. Obviously u didn't read the EO.
825186918094749697 2017-01-27 03:41:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @THEHermanCain @FoxNews that's why I don't watch those channels as that song report the news. They are apart of the news with their opinions
825186057281007617 2017-01-27 03:37:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico more fake news. Most ppl do not support abortions or want 2 use taxpayer dollars 2 pay 4 them.
825181228110323713 2017-01-27 03:18:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @SenWarren u have got 2 be kidding me. There is no ban, just a temporary hold until we can put better vetting in place.
825178755308085253 2017-01-27 03:08:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill it's all about the teachers union as they will lose power and money. School choice is the right of parents not unions or fake dems
825092604463349761 2017-01-27 21:26:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @HuffPostPol @mcuban r u still talking politics? Give it up & focus on your businesses. U r not relevant.
824984985383948289 2017-01-27 14:18:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump @politico not gonna happen, Mexico needs us more than we need them. Their peso & market dropped yesterday after trip cancel
824948305817923585 2017-01-27 11:52:57 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BreitbartNews @AnnCoulter interesting that the peso dropped and their version of the DOW also dropped after trip cancelled.
824813489264984064 2017-01-26 02:57:14 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @xmaselmo1 @moniquesourdif @chelseahandler how about sexist, Xenophobic, radical leftist, anarchist and most importantly no one important.
824806185962463232 2017-01-26 02:28:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @AMike4761 I am willing 2 bet there were more than that. Remember ACORN. I witnessed these ppl signing up ppl & throwing away repub apps.
824802384811585536 2017-01-26 02:13:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @kgbveteran great role model for our children.

824791447765389312 2017-01-26 01:29:39 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill this is ridiculous. Just because someone is registered in multiple states doesn't mean they voted in multiple states.
824791039345033217 2017-01-26 01:28:02 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @SenJohnMcCain I'm deeply concerned about your ability to do your job. U were in the Senate and did nothing to stop Obama.

824653885600133121 2017-01-26 16:23:02 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @jamesmcelweejr it's obvious by your knee jerk reaction and quickness to demean and insult instead of discussing issues like a gentleman.

824089554298740736 2017-01-24 03:00:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @LindseyGrahamSC it is a shame that Veterans who serve their country only receive 50% of their base pay & taxed. Where congressmen get 100%.

823981239631802368 2017-01-24 19:50:11 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes you got the opinion part right regarding this article. However the majority of Americans don't believe your partisan reporting.

822128660027232256 2017-01-19 17:08:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill sorry, but I totally disagree with this assessment. Obama has been a partisan President who refused to work with the GOP. No legacy

818250004385189888 2017-01-08 00:16:18 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DrRoto they have been doing it all year. I regretted drafting Eli as my FF QB, good thing my backup was Matt Ryan.
818248529139396609 2017-01-08 00:10:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews don't care, I won't be watching these Hollywood elites. I stopped supporting them after their left wing bias. Just do ur job & act.
818199617762369540 2017-01-08 20:56:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics who is Tim Kaine? Oh, the failed democratic VP candidate. Remember u lost and therefore should go sit in the corner.
818199187984617474 2017-01-08 20:54:22 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders no one will be listening to your whinning on Clinton News Network tonight.
818198824585936897 2017-01-08 20:52:55 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @theScore packers in a run away.
818198712040177668 2017-01-08 20:52:29 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RealSkipBayless not sure what your looking at, but Bell is a more versitle and elusive player than Elliot. Your bias is obvious.
818124298472792065 2017-01-08 15:56:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill if this is even true, what difference does it make? There are many more people who have plagirized and weren't caught.
818123944544845824 2017-01-08 15:55:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes what's the point here? Previous admins came in and left office rich, I would like 2 know how that's possible.
817880336025665539 2017-01-07 23:47:22 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ScoutFantasy @HoustonTexans Houston's play calling is absolutely horrendous.  The O Line is terrible.  Sustain a drive for goodness sake

817425876132515840 2017-01-06 17:41:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill the terminator was the wrong choice for this show. Look at another top businessman for this show...

817227115875749888 2017-01-05 04:31:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico_media @politico big whoop, I couldn't stand Greta on Fox and would frequently change the channel during her show.
817226490005848066 2017-01-05 04:29:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @seanhannity of course they are as they have no power to stop anything GOP wants 2 do...

817224114096263169 2017-01-05 04:19:46 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @JohnJHarwood @tinastullracing problem here is Intel officials can't divulge methods and tools which make it hard to believe them. No detail
817223719470895104 2017-01-05 04:18:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @starsandstripes @VeteranAdvocacy @realDonaldTrump I agree that VA has made tremendous progress over that two years. Check out VEO.
817223387663728640 2017-01-05 04:16:53 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNews which is why HRC had a private email server to avoid FOIA. We all already knew she was corrupt and lies from past history.
817209869048709124 2017-01-05 03:23:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld Clemson wins 38 - 31
817209209091719170 2017-01-05 03:20:33 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @jmdonsi @moniquesourdif true, the recount in MI showed the high voter fraud in Detroit favoring the Democratic party.
817207937575911425 2017-01-05 03:15:29 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFL none of these teams will make the Superbowl.  I got them all losing this weekend.
817206762097045504 2017-01-05 03:10:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @WhiteHouse progress for who? Wages are down, jobs leaving the USA, lowest labor participation rate in decades, trillobsmore in debt, Etc.

817195509832175616 2017-01-05 02:26:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @scott_pianowski Ryan is deserving of this award and played a full season..
817191482390151173 2017-01-05 02:10:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Jake_Trotter @nfltrade_rumors will an NFL team take a chance on this guy. Great talent, but off the field issues could derail his future.
817190513925296129 2017-01-05 02:06:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders u r a joke of a senator. This legalized aboration org needs to be defunded and disbanded completely. No more federal money.
817188845007597572 2017-01-05 01:59:37 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @washingtonpost @CoryBooker @SenWarren dumbest thing I've ever heard. Good thing the GOP has the majority. Illegal criminals need 2 be gone.
817183867031486464 2017-01-05 01:39:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump @TeamTrump this briefing should've been a joint briefing with the outgoing & incoming President. Same info to everyone.
817183202452377600 2017-01-05 01:37:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump @bessbell the issue here is that unless NBC has a security clearance then by law they cannot see classified into. TS-SCI

816494295612092417 2017-01-03 03:59:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld agree with Pats, but don't think Cowboys will make it. My odds are on the Packers as they are peaking at the right time of year.
816492011427627008 2017-01-03 03:50:39 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @PFF_Fantasy agreed went RB-RB in first two rds in 14 teamer and came in second. I do RB-RB every year & have a top 3 track record in 8 yrs

816491047203340288 2017-01-03 03:46:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Rotoworld_FB should be easy to defend.
816490660329115648 2017-01-03 03:45:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @johnpodesta @FoxNews absolutely hillarious and Modest and DNC deserved what they got for being stupid to fall for this scheme.
816489140325912576 2017-01-03 03:39:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FOXSports @NFLonFOX He's too old to be effective. Speaking as a UM fan and have his college jersey.
816488515542323200 2017-01-03 03:36:46 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @AdamSchein @NFL no question on my mind it's Matt Ryan.
816485996304957440 2017-01-03 03:26:45 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @KevinJacksonTBS @megynkelly good luck at NBC, I don't watch that liberal leaning media outlet.
816485427238633472 2017-01-03 03:24:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @politico who cares what Obama thinks. He's done, the party's over. Move on, go home. Try a cry-in or playdough
816484002261598209 2017-01-03 03:18:50 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MariahCarey @megynkelly @FoxNews BLUF, the privledged Mariah Carey needs to go off into the sunset and move over for new talent.
816471443273895937 2017-01-03 02:28:56 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders as a matter of fact I graduated in 2010 with Masters and still paying back my loan.
816470179219652608 2017-01-03 02:23:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders bernie, nothing is free Taxpayers will foot the bill & college students will learn nothing about value of dollar & repaying debt
816468105962651648 2017-01-03 02:15:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @56andstillhere agreed as a veteran, I uphold the American flag as a symbol freedom that many tought & died 2 protect.
816464128961314816 2017-01-03 01:59:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller @56andstillhere my favorite pic of 2016.
816463055789953024 2017-01-03 01:55:36 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill really Hillary didn't hold a press conference in years.
816462785798348805 2017-01-03 01:54:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @POLITICOMag @politico her viewers will drop significantly,  but doesn't matter as she is getting paid and more time with kids, priorities.
816462308335583232 2017-01-03 01:52:38 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller @56andstillhere u have quite a mouth on you. What's your proof Russians hacked DNC? Liberal media doesn't count

816461310649110528 2017-01-03 01:48:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenTomCotton @FoxNews when r these folks going 2 learn Russia didn't hack anyone. Podesta was phished.
816460887036981250 2017-01-03 01:46:59 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller politics pays well. I'm sure Obama has received kickbacks to afford luxurious lifestyle.
816459632516407296 2017-01-03 01:42:00 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FOXSports @NFLonFOX these guys deserve a break. Leave them alone. Football is a year round sport.
816459346339041281 2017-01-03 01:40:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill nothing is free. Taxpayers are paying for this which means less in their pockets while kids in college don't learn value of dollar
816458919157567489 2017-01-03 01:39:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheDemocrats don't forget rise in ISIS attacks, lowest labor participation rate in decades, more on unemploy, & lead from behind fore polic
816450375167463424 2017-01-03 01:05:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle @greggutfeld I vote for Greg Gutfeld, funniest political anchor in the biz, if not then Kat 4 sure.
816449359999025152 2017-01-03 01:01:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill late 2 the party as usual. Trump scraped this legislation.
816448643746197504 2017-01-03 00:58:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld well deserved
816447940600467456 2017-01-03 00:55:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics Schumer will be Donald's lap boy, but trying to save face with his party.
816447601641979904 2017-01-03 00:54:11 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld I got GB winning 24 - 17.
816446488964427776 2017-01-03 00:49:46 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TGowdySC bring justice to Hillary Clinton's corruption.
816422349503336448 2017-01-03 23:13:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller more celebs whom I won't pay 2 watch their movies. There out of work has-beens will stop at nothing to delegitimize our pres
816417176856969216 2017-01-03 22:53:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld yes, I vote for an 8 team playoff which should include major conf champs and eligible teams not conf champs.
816286989360230402 2017-01-03 14:15:58 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nflnetwork @Sonnyjr66 I agree with that.
816279519678103552 2017-01-03 13:46:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU good analysis.
816256901830836224 2017-01-03 12:16:25 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nflnetwork @Sonnyjr66 agreed, but Rodgers was terrible the first 9 games and Matt Ryan has been consistent all year.
816148266538729472 2017-01-02 05:04:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN this is getting old and boring. Election was won fair and square. DNC was phished and they willfully provided emails for public view
816147162396495872 2017-01-02 05:00:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nflnetwork @Sonnyjr66 let's not forget this award is for an entire season. Rodgers was hot garbage first 9 games. My vote is for Ryan.
816146301901541377 2017-01-02 04:56:56 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SiriusXMFantasy pats over packers
816144982004350976 2017-01-02 04:51:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld great game.
816144853943943169 2017-01-02 04:51:11 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SiriusXMFantasy pats vs. The packers with the Pats winning.
816143922359570432 2017-01-02 04:47:28 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill who cares what u think. Another flaming liberal with an opinion.
816143061159972864 2017-01-02 04:44:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TimCowlishaw we don't want Cutler or Romo in Miami.
816028018086989824 2017-01-02 21:06:55 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld true, Clemson was going 2 steam roll Bama with or without Kiffin.
815960980345786368 2017-01-02 16:40:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @VictorZapat1 what does that have to do with Russian Hacking as u claim?
815959404126339076 2017-01-02 16:34:16 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @VictorZapat1 that may be true, but irrelevant in this situation.
815957219619536896 2017-01-02 16:25:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @VictorZapat1 no proof Rusia hacked Podesta. Assange has already said Podesta was victim of phishing.

815929929539981312 2017-01-02 14:37:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SNFonNBC Matt Ryan for the whole season. A Rod has performed at the MVP level for last 7 games.
815734902603874304 2017-01-01 01:42:11 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RealSkipBayless my vote is for Matt Ryan.

814594701965852673 2016-12-29 22:11:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews u guys really don't get it. Unemploy benefits are short term. Then people fall out of the labor force and no longer counted.
814591641981976579 2016-12-29 21:59:16 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN let's all boycott this place and watch them go out of business.
814591242088710145 2016-12-29 21:57:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics because Obama keeps doing major activities affecting new president before he takes office. Stop Obama and get out of WH
814590574082883584 2016-12-29 21:55:01 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders u r clueless. Stick with what u do best losing elections.
814590091872051204 2016-12-29 21:53:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @realDonaldTrump there already is a private option called CHOICE and most vets hate it. Docs r disrespectful and too much paperwork
814476621650468864 2016-12-29 14:22:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @RealNastyWoman I agree. Most VAs offer transportation for those that need it. There are CBOCs for areas of high concentration Vets
814311403851055104 2016-12-28 03:25:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill disagree with this route. Most zvet prefer going 2 a VAMC. Good option for those traveling long distances, but most prefer VA.
814310870457188352 2016-12-28 03:23:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Browns wish Bell would have sat last week then would have won my league...
814309383266045953 2016-12-28 03:17:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill sounds about right to me. The contents of those emails exposed the dems as crooked and bigoted. We knew that, emails confirmed.
814307337041313794 2016-12-28 03:09:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNewsInsider @FoxNews dems are now the party of "NO". Too bad we don't need them with the nuclear option.
813950377326419968 2016-12-27 03:31:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill I don't get this article. What if Trump wants to talk with the SME on these issues. I don't believe he is targeting them.
813525400064323584 2016-12-26 23:22:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN @MrJaredBarnes @PureNTrue1 u libs preach tolerance. But don't practice what u preach.
813476186991038464 2016-12-26 20:06:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN @MrJaredBarnes @PureNTrue1 ridiculous, ISIS arose as a result of Obama's failed foreign policy and drawdown of troops.
813421856657117184 2016-12-26 16:30:57 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN @MrJaredBarnes why do u think Iraq was over oil. We have oil resources here in the US. Conspiracy theorist.
813421563739566080 2016-12-26 16:29:48 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN @MrJaredBarnes actually no.
813420761025249280 2016-12-26 16:26:36 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MrJaredBarnes @OneDependent @CNN wow, man u r on a Twitter rampage. Obama ruined this country with his policies & will leave trillons debt
813419551425785856 2016-12-26 16:21:48 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN @MrJaredBarnes the difference is that Bush worked at his ranch and we'll Obama just played golf and vacationed a lot.
813419017612460032 2016-12-26 16:19:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NolanDMcCaskill @politico this guy is the most arrogant and delusional person on the planet. Really, a 3rd term of Obama's policies.
813417489199693825 2016-12-26 16:13:36 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN had you tried 2 work with Republicans then you might have achieved bipartisan support on some issues, but you rejected to do that.
813416903104413696 2016-12-26 16:11:16 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN I don't think so, the election of Trump is a rejection of Obama and his policies. Now he is trying to save his legacy. Stop it & leave.
813406455223218176 2016-12-26 15:29:45 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SiriusXMFantasy need 14pts tonite from Prayer 2 win.

813245947572523008 2016-12-25 04:51:57 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @spenceware11 Let Reid know he costed me $200 and a title by sitting u the last quarter and a half. I don't get it as u were avg 5yds carry
812877057961185280 2016-12-24 04:26:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill sure fire way 2 get a visit from the Secret Service. Threatening 2 kill a President is a felony...
812876196056809473 2016-12-24 04:22:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @POTUS @WhiteHouse why do u feel the need 2 always toot your horn? U were the worst pres ever & we will never recover.
812875775498186752 2016-12-24 04:21:02 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders u talk a good game, how do u propose to do that?
812542566520516608 2016-12-23 06:16:58 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller dems never take responsibility for anything. Just another example of Obama's arrogance. Remember it's Bush's fault
812512653604175872 2016-12-23 04:18:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump I encourage u 2 check out the article in the HBR on the organizational changes made by the VA over last 2 1/2yrs.
812422696470532097 2016-12-23 22:20:39 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BaseballGuys need 2 in a ppr: Ware (underperforming), Rawls, Miller (injured, did not practice) or Blue.

811546372650520576 2016-12-21 12:18:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill bad choices, I would encourage that the new SECVA is a Veteran with real world experience to forge ahead & continue changes occurin
811544884876365824 2016-12-21 12:12:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SiriusXMFantasy need 2 in a ppr and 1/2pt per carry: Rawls, Miller, Ware for the title.
811535409482240000 2016-12-21 11:34:53 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BaseballGuys better play this wk: Gates or Hunter, knowing that Gates is on the field more & Rivers wants the TD record but less targets.
811430047315693568 2016-12-20 04:36:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @YouTube @JaysonBraddock @sportsrage @FNTSYSportsNet yes, he brought down value of Hopkins and made HOU one dimensional. Miller now open lan
811409678609551361 2016-12-20 03:15:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RealSkipBayless u wouldn't be saying this if he weren't a Cowboy. U r so predictable.
811300019357753349 2016-12-20 19:59:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump I disagree with a change in leadership as Sec VA McDonald has turned around the VA over the last 18 months
811298854033309698 2016-12-20 19:54:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill who is being polled, I keep seeing these ridiculous polls and wonder if these are TRUMP detractors or supporters being polled.
811298217782603776 2016-12-20 19:52:22 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller so that he can pull the plug and use this money elsewhere.
811298023095537665 2016-12-20 19:51:36 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN I would rather fund this than many of the benefit programs that Obama has supported with taxpayer dollars.

811260992483102724 2016-12-20 17:24:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @360FFB college players have nothing left to prove and could potentially suffer an injury that jeopardizes their draft position.
810978499913805824 2016-12-19 22:41:56 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RealSkipBayless but that didn't happen and my Heat won.
810978085101301760 2016-12-19 22:40:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders do u even believe the crap your shoveling? Stop crying and start accepting your new World in the minority...
810963906927742976 2016-12-19 21:43:57 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RealSkipBayless not quite. They will not make it to the NFC Championship game and If they do, they will lose. There not ready 4 the SB.
810963345197109249 2016-12-19 21:41:43 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BillClinton @CNN @billclinton @HillaryClinton he also got more African and Hispanic Americans to vote 4 him than Romney did. Sore loser...
810958352557764608 2016-12-19 21:21:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BillClinton @thehill @billclinton u must be joking, she was a flawed candidate with a history of not telling the truth. Get over it & fade out limelight
810957855503290370 2016-12-19 21:19:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FantasyAlarm best move of the wk picked up & started Ty Montgomery. Adv in all leagues with 2 finals & 1 semi. Will production continue?
810956184815632384 2016-12-19 21:13:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FOXSports @NFLonFOX I agree, it the rule to not use a prop in TD celebration even if it's for a good cause.
810865727012012033 2016-12-19 15:13:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld he broke the rules, doesn't matter that it was for a good cause. He used the kettle as a prop and was penalized for it.
810712699982245889 2016-12-18 05:05:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RealSkipBayless if the packers make it in the playoffs then the Cowboys will lose and the pack will play SEA in the Championship game.
810534787941277700 2016-12-18 17:18:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ESPNFFNow ppr: Hopkins or Ty Montgomery as WR3.
810334771628965892 2016-12-17 04:03:59 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RealSkipBayless stop the madness, Dak is a rookie and he has been figured out. The Boys were never going 2 the SB this year anyways.
810262910991794179 2016-12-17 23:18:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill who cares, get over the reality that u r in the minority.

806825317260230656 2016-12-08 11:38:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @seanhannity NO...
806623954643406857 2016-12-07 22:18:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill regardless of who is named POY. What gives this has-been Hollywood elite any platform to dispute it & what difference does it make.
806577142100357120 2016-12-07 19:12:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DeMarcoMurray @NFLfantasy my opponent has Murray on the bench and I hope he leaves him there. I give him a solid 7.
806576651358404609 2016-12-07 19:10:33 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLfantasy tough as I have Eli & Ryan. Leaning Eli based on game script. Thinking he will have to throw more than Ryan. Also have Shepard.
806575768721620994 2016-12-07 19:07:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @footballdiehard Need 2WRs: have Landry, Benjamin, A Rob, Thielen. Can drop Thielen & PU Sterlin Shepard or Tyler Boyd. Lean Landry/Shepard
805996032760958980 2016-12-05 04:43:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @JamesPalmerTV @Michael_Fabiano they should stick with Petty at QB and I will play the defenses NYJ face throughout the playoffs.
805993189261934592 2016-12-05 04:32:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RosterWatch yeah Rodgers, Brady, Stafford, Carr should I continue...
805992863066681344 2016-12-05 04:30:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FrankGore21 @CutonDime25 GO CANES...
805956721000775680 2016-12-05 02:07:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld agreed.
805955518988767232 2016-12-05 02:02:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill nobody wants this fooled President. Stop the madness...
805949033311305728 2016-12-05 01:36:38 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DrIanHochman @JameyEisenberg I'm up 43pts in a ppr & going up against Marshall & Gore. Need them to bomb.
805948800875589632 2016-12-05 01:35:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld that's not saying much at least Rodgers has excuse of bad weather.
805948487691075584 2016-12-05 01:34:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill that's how the Dems roll. Hell, Obama blamed Bush six years into his presidency. Take responsibility and fix the issues.
805948008596701185 2016-12-05 01:32:33 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump @politico Donald, the media will continue just like SNL because they know if gets on your nerves.
805946586899550209 2016-12-05 01:26:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill no way, with all do respect that's a bunch of mularchey.
805945705915437056 2016-12-05 01:23:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill then he or she needs to be fired if they go against the wishes of the electorate.
805945330105720832 2016-12-05 01:21:55 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @VanJones68 @CNNPolitics is this show about the WHITELASH that u said is sweeping this country in the post election commentary.
805944401927270400 2016-12-05 01:18:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @AllenWest as a vet & new VA employee, I find this disturbing. This is a leadership failure and isolated incident. New VE prgm is makin diff
805942228342493185 2016-12-05 01:09:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews @OWNTV nobody cares...
805941714502451204 2016-12-05 01:07:33 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNews it would be a travesty 2 pardon him without his day in court.
805941016473862147 2016-12-05 01:04:46 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @KAYLEEBURRIS that's funny because recount efforts in WI are revealing that Clinton is losing six times as many votes as Trump.
805940628240601089 2016-12-05 01:03:14 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SiriusXMFantasy @footballdiehard up 43pts in ppr, my opponent has Gore and Marshall. What are my chances of winning?
805940171942297600 2016-12-05 01:01:25 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @AdamSchefter bust.
805940081299169280 2016-12-05 01:01:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @AdamSchefter forsett is a busy.
805939546907086848 2016-12-05 00:58:56 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheDemocrats still trying 2 figure out what Obama did because more companies left the US for Mexico. Trump will bring them back.
805936535795331076 2016-12-05 00:46:58 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @MartinucciNaomi funny how Hillary way outspent him and lost. She spent other people's money with nothing to show for it.
805610954482388992 2016-12-04 03:13:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @UW_Football @OhioStateFB @ClemsonFB @AlabamaFTBL @NFL_CFB I guess conf titles don't mean crap with OSU being in the playoff. Need 2 expand
805446782205431808 2016-12-04 16:20:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Jeff_Mans with Parker playing should I bench landry, need 2: landry, benjamin, A Rob, Marquees Wilson
805445064877113344 2016-12-04 16:14:02 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DCBlueStar tell him 2 be safe and Godspeed from 1 Vet 2 another.
805248067041628162 2016-12-03 03:11:14 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld I don't think OSU should be in the playoff without winning their conference, but if they are they should be the 4th tm & play Bama.
805201704375451653 2016-12-03 00:07:00 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @PeriscopeCo @footballdiehard @periscopeco need 2 WR in ppr: A Rob, K Benjamin, Landry, Marquees Wilson
805095402441756673 2016-12-03 17:04:36 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNews doesn't deserve a pardon. Should be imprisoned or spend the rest of his life in a mental institution.
805094684519518208 2016-12-03 17:01:45 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico really, Obama's many vacays costed the taxpayers millions a day...
805063153734320128 2016-12-03 14:56:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics so what, your presence is not required. In fact just resign.
804879869356212224 2016-12-02 02:48:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @risatabacoff thanks, I am not familiar with his history, but he made a choice which resulted in the death of others.
804876257443934208 2016-12-02 02:33:48 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @risatabacoff I am a vet & served several tours overseas. How is he a victim?
804873254821330944 2016-12-02 02:21:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill I would make an exception in this case and bring back the firing squads for an act of treason.
804872930719043585 2016-12-02 02:20:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @risatabacoff soldiers died looking for this traitor after he willingly left his post. U would feel diff if u lost someone u loved
804800264960143361 2016-12-02 21:31:50 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller wow...
804799570551205888 2016-12-02 21:29:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheDemocrats I guess this is how your raising money now. How about loser bumper stickers and pins. I'd buy one then burn it...
804799295987843072 2016-12-02 21:27:59 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity deplorable...
804799222017093634 2016-12-02 21:27:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller how about carrying an American flag to show solidarity. These hosts are a joke and no one's watching.
804798947923492865 2016-12-02 21:26:36 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSHealth @SenSanders this is a concern for me.
804797773426126848 2016-12-02 21:21:56 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN @@POTUS Why is Obama doing anything in his final days in office that can be overturned.  Go play golf, go to Hawaii, just stop...
804757095832809472 2016-12-02 18:40:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Michael_Fabiano need 2 in ppr: A Rob, Landry, K Benjamin or pickup Mitchell or Wilson dropping Jeffrey or Smallwood?
804756706869805056 2016-12-02 18:38:45 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BernieSanders I'm lost on this line of thinking and fear mongering.
804736513196036096 2016-12-02 17:18:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @washingtonpost @SenSanders Bernie, this happens all the time when pitching new/expanding companies. States offer incentive packages 2 keep.
804726034042155009 2016-12-02 16:36:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @WhiteHouse were those jobs added in the US or overseas?
804713724917510146 2016-12-02 15:47:57 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @POTUS #'s r deceiving & do not count the millions who r not participating in the labor force. More on unemploy since Potus elected
804713108849721344 2016-12-02 15:45:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill have u & other celebs not learned that middle-class Americans despise u eltists trying 2 tell us what to do in your million $ homes
804696464559665152 2016-12-02 14:39:22 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews if Kelloggs just stopped advertising in Breitbart that's one thing but they made a stmt against the magazine which went 2 far.
804677588736155648 2016-12-02 13:24:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill u did lose.
804539169372590080 2016-12-01 04:14:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BaseballGuys need 2 win 4 playoffs. Need 2WRs: K. Benjamin, Landry, Robinson. Waiver: .Mitchell or Wilson. Drop Jeffrey or Smallwood
804537251321511937 2016-12-01 04:06:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RealSkipBayless Cavs are overrated.

804529979644084224 2016-12-01 03:37:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill so what, your vote isn't needed. GOP has the majority, ha ha ha.
804510777336020992 2016-12-01 02:21:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill let her go if she wants. I will never watch her especially up against O'Reilly.
804509387813486594 2016-12-01 02:15:59 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @daverichard is mtchell or marquees Wilson worth a pickup and drop either Jeffrey or smallwood
804508542321496064 2016-12-01 02:12:38 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller @CNNPolitics @CNN funny, Allison used to be on Fox & Friends and now slumming on Clinton News Network.
804507968490377220 2016-12-01 02:10:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheDemocrats what is the purpose of these ads. The Dem party is in shambles & dying on the vine. Haven't u learned anything from election.
804507356881108993 2016-12-01 02:07:55 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump @SenSanders I'm sure u never gave a company in your state a tax break. In SC, we give tax breaks for new & expanding COs.
804506688413896705 2016-12-01 02:05:16 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RapSheet @dak @NFL no way, I don't see it. Defenses will figure him out.

804290002360397826 2016-12-01 11:44:14 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @toddstarnes @FoxNews this is ridiculous. Leave these nice people alone.
804289618564747264 2016-12-01 11:42:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill and Tom Ford is...
804289375232266240 2016-12-01 11:41:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MikeClayNFL @Michael_Fabiano I know the feeling. In week 2 needed 5pts from kicker and lost.
804288565446328320 2016-12-01 11:38:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNews I keep mine in my wallet and serves as a 2nd form of ID. U don't.
804287587380842496 2016-12-01 11:34:38 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNews @KeysPlayerMusic not true, I carry my voting card.
804182830800637952 2016-11-30 04:38:22 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @yascaoimhin no, a voter registration card is the actual document that allows u to vote. U present it at the time of voting.
804182484586000384 2016-11-30 04:36:59 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @yascaoimhin unless an independent review was conducted on state voting then proof can be garnered. I am merely saying it is possible.
804181882837549056 2016-11-30 04:34:36 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @greggutfeld unfortunately all to true. Interesting read "Rise of the Robots", by Martin Ford.
804180856290115590 2016-11-30 04:30:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @yascaoimhin I agree, but what about all of those that were not captured thus illegal voting.
804179805021278208 2016-11-30 04:26:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @yascaoimhinhttps://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/804134948428988416
804176977603215361 2016-11-30 04:15:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Redistrict @AirCav1968 @yascaoimhin check out illegals in Cali given drivers licenses. With a DL u can get a voters registration card.
804175478022086656 2016-11-30 04:09:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ILoveHillaryC @DebraWinters28 I agree with u. I wasn't supportive of Trump either, but I could never vote for Hillary criminal clinton.
804174210532839424 2016-11-30 04:04:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> show me the proof u researched. Anyone can make a statement that doesn't make it true.
804169487067058176 2016-11-30 03:45:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill what proof do you have of this allegation?
804164058199035908 2016-11-30 03:23:46 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> she makes a lot of allegations with no proof, much like Harry Reid does and the main stream media runs with it as the truth.
804160150370185216 2016-11-30 03:08:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics not sure if a compliment or not. But as a vet myself, politics seem 2 bring out the worst in ppl.
804156539175137280 2016-11-30 02:53:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Fitz_843 @FFdeJENerate I'm tempted, but he will be back in wk 15. Malcolm Mitchell and marquees Wilson are on waivers.
804154681714937856 2016-11-30 02:46:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FFdeJENerate @Fitz_843 tell me about it. I have Landry as my other WR and Jeffrey on the bench.
804150275032449024 2016-11-30 02:29:00 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FFdeJENerate he has a shoulder injury, but will play. Issue he is playing SEA, and A Rob is playing DEN. Must win to make playoffs.
804148956129296384 2016-11-30 02:23:46 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FFdeJENerate tough choices this week, need 2WRs: Jarvis Landry, Kelvin Benjamin, Allen Robinson.
804146646762274816 2016-11-30 02:14:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill Cooper is my new hero. I appreciate it when you are fair and not one sided.
804143943864741888 2016-11-30 02:03:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ILoveHillaryC funny how u liberals speak of tolerance & freedom of speech, but u want to block me from saying how I feel.
804141203470086144 2016-11-30 01:52:57 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ILoveHillaryC face it your candidate was weak and had a problem with the truth and oh she lost. You coward.
804134853335728130 2016-11-30 01:27:43 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics @CNN is it just me or does Senator Warren look like she is about to cry...
804133919121674240 2016-11-30 01:24:01 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico @Rtothhendricks I am a highly educated Vet & can say with confidence that I am smarter than u. My bro is a liberal, I know type.
804132774437339140 2016-11-30 01:19:28 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico @Rtothhendricks your really reaching deep on this one. That was in reaction to the Hamilton discussion.
804130866775687168 2016-11-30 01:11:53 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @POTUS why does this statement even matter. It has no bearing on anything and is a waste of good journalism.
804130493839052800 2016-11-30 01:10:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics please stop giving this haag any air time. She has lost touch.

804124250466615297 2016-11-30 00:45:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SarahPalinUSA @realDonaldTrump @politico as a vet, I don't think Palin is qual for this post. We need a Veteran to run the agency.
804122676734345216 2016-11-30 00:39:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller Rolling Stone is not a credible media source. Boo boo it was Fox's fault. I can't say it enough Dems always blame others.
804085008734572546 2016-11-30 22:09:39 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheFive even on military installations, u can only watch CNN. Mostly in hospital waiting rooms.

804005600141185028 2016-11-30 16:54:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller who gives a $h!+, Hillary has already conceded.
803985814342537216 2016-11-30 15:35:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller they should be talking about Katy Perry's horrible dress.
803982394361544704 2016-11-30 15:21:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @VicMensa @CNNPolitics I learned of the electoral college in Jr high school. Every time the left loses they want 2 abolish electotal college
803980581197512704 2016-11-30 15:14:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @PeteHegseth as a Vet, new VA employee, & Fox viewer I support & applaud your efforts 2 fight 4 Vets. VA has made strides in the last 18 mos

803818090031104001 2016-11-29 04:29:01 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes i believe that ESPN is losing viewers because of its social positions. Caitlynn Jenner courage award and many other examples.

803808548878749696 2016-11-29 03:51:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @SenWarren i have been tired of this old haag. Its about time others spoke up. Her and Sanders are the epitome of elitists.
803807981678788608 2016-11-29 03:48:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes how about a good a$$ whopping for anyone burning a flag.
803788125533245440 2016-11-29 02:29:57 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @julieroginsky @DavidWohl @megynkelly as a Vet, I would get arrested for kicking one of these cupcakes butt forthe flag.
803775692769034240 2016-11-29 01:40:33 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MikeABCColumbia I agree, I think there should be an 8 team playoff using existing bowl games.
803775096263426048 2016-11-29 01:38:11 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @abc_columbia @MikeABCColumbia U may be right. I believe Alabama got in a few years ago without playing in their championship game.
803774630494248960 2016-11-29 01:36:19 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld I don't think OSU should be in the playoff having not won their championship game.
803773751062106112 2016-11-29 01:32:50 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @abc_columbia @MikeABCColumbia I don't think OSU should be in the playoff if they don't win their championship game.
803773452809367553 2016-11-29 01:31:39 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico what a joke, democrats will stop it at nothing. Just completely and utterly stupid.
803635611408236544 2016-11-29 16:23:55 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders really, this coming from a millionaire and lifelong politician. What do u know regular americans?
803634915149545481 2016-11-29 16:21:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @espn @ESPNCFB rewatch the game and u will see that he has a point with officiating calls that started with 1st QTR missed PI.
803569592564154369 2016-11-29 12:01:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump totally agree as a Combat Veteran, I think these flag haters need a good old fashioned a$$ Whopping at the least.
803568142454845440 2016-11-29 11:55:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RealSkipBayless no, but Dak isn't doing it alone.  He has #1 OL & a top RB & good defense.
803564057521487872 2016-11-29 11:39:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics @colinkae interesting that he feels oppresed here in the US, but praises a known dictator. What a walking hypocrisy.
803452033705668608 2016-11-28 04:14:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @JonGrudenESPN plz stop the love affair with Rodgers, your making Olivia Munn jealous.  Also GB OL has been holding all night...

803444287400775680 2016-11-28 03:43:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN @realDonaldTrump who watches CNN anymore. They are clearly biased toward the left. Leaked debate question, Van Jones "WHITELASH", etc.
803408740456210432 2016-11-28 01:22:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico is there anyone Rams Paul doesn't have a problem with,
803363301069561856 2016-11-28 22:21:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheFive @greggutfeld what about recount in NH, Clinton won by .4%. Closer than MI.
803340172481990657 2016-11-28 20:49:57 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @KirkHerbstreit @ESPNCFB @TMayneII it should be, OSU lost to PSU and are not the best team in the conference. Just my thought.

803338856741404672 2016-11-28 20:44:43 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ESPNCFB @KirkHerbstreit OSU doesn't deserve to be in the playoff without having competed & won their conference championship. Big 4 champs
803277492983394304 2016-11-28 16:40:53 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @polguru @realDonaldTrump  Clinton's margin of victory was .4% & within margin of error, those being recounted r more than that.
803275933201432576 2016-11-28 16:34:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @undisputed @RealSkipBayless Norman seems 2 have issues with every WR, makes him the problem.
802961307804700672 2016-11-27 19:44:28 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @realDonaldTrump speaking is one thing, but keep your campaign promises and undo all executive orders.
802960709789184000 2016-11-27 19:42:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MattHarmon_BYB I'm sad too as I need A-Rob to get going...

802877496970674176 2016-11-27 14:11:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller and that's why he picked her.
802876733242212353 2016-11-27 14:08:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @camanpour @CNN u do realize that these journalists brought this on themselves by doing unfair coverage & colluding with Hillary's camp.
802746873073147905 2016-11-26 05:32:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @POLITICOMag @realDonaldTrump @politico he is taking a salary $1
802742718325788672 2016-11-26 05:15:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DrJillStein if this is legitimate why not recount New Hampshire where Clinton won by .4% or r u only recounting Trump's wins? Deplorable
802724641936732160 2016-11-26 04:04:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> I cast my Heisman ballot for Lamar Jackson! Click the player you think deserves the @NissanUSA #HeismanHouse vote!https://cards.twitter.com/cards/16a9qt/2no5t

802680483242975232 2016-11-26 01:08:34 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @cvpayne @FoxNews @POTUS Obama still blames Bush. Typical dem doesn't accept responsibility for anything. But talks approval rating.
802679711834996738 2016-11-26 01:05:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @patrick552 is this a joke, even though I conceded doesn't appear that I r accepting the election. Coronation ended now go quietly.
802669559006302213 2016-11-26 00:25:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU could have been better with the loses to FSU, ND, & UNC.
802664723766460417 2016-11-26 00:05:57 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DrJillStein I'm so confused about this recount thing as Clinton's team has been over these results and conceded the election.
802632670379384833 2016-11-26 21:58:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @footballdiehard thx
802578442663305216 2016-11-26 18:23:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @HillaryClinton @TheDemocrats this is a waste of everones time, effort and Soros' money. Sore losers!!!
802560029077291008 2016-11-26 17:09:56 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill of course u will and was involved all along. Sorry to disappoint, but the same results will b the same unless u cheat 2 win.
802556668546400256 2016-11-26 16:56:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller @VanJones68 really, this guy is the biggest racist on the planet with his divise rhetoric and controversial "WHITELASH" comment
802556227939160064 2016-11-26 16:54:50 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BernieSanders BS, U r all a bunch of elites with your private jets and fancy homes. Stop trying to appeal to those in poverty. Hypocrites
802555574814646272 2016-11-26 16:52:14 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @POTUS your a joke and should be condemed for any praise of Castro.
802555064137252864 2016-11-26 16:50:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DrJillStein I'm sure it was Russia & they only targeted WI, MI, & PA. Give me a break, this is a waste of and Soros' money.
802552180792299521 2016-11-26 16:38:45 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes believe me, he is no star. Divisive racist "YES".
802543204537077760 2016-11-26 16:03:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @realDonaldTrump this is a bunch of crap and waste of time and Soros' money. Really Russian hackers targeted just these 3 states.

802364210667782144 2016-11-25 04:11:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DrJillStein @politico ridiculous, there is no evidence of tampering. Stein and Soros will look like fools when recount completed.

802313569941405696 2016-11-25 00:50:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @PurlLeslie will be hard 2 change electoral college as smaller states will lose political power with only popular vote.
802296843770232833 2016-11-25 23:44:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @360FFB Norman is a loud mouth trying to get into WRs head. Need an OL to lay him out....
802296481151676416 2016-11-25 23:42:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @PurlLeslie stop with the popular vote. It doesn't mean crap, just ppl wanna talk about it. Only because of CA, NY, most liberals r
802294583178760192 2016-11-25 23:35:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews @ladygaga it takes a freak to know a freak..

801870980125720576 2016-11-24 19:31:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller @realDonaldTrump this is becoming a regular occurence with hoaxes but media won't correct the record.
801643580859314176 2016-11-23 04:28:18 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump @politico how does one become an elector? Do u damn job and vote 4 the candidate that the ppl of your state elected.
801643199001403393 2016-11-23 04:26:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller he hasn't even taken office yet. Stop with the impeachment talk.

801635431863517184 2016-11-23 03:55:55 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNews boo hoo, get over it.
801634947815632896 2016-11-23 03:53:59 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill how do I know these are TRUMP trolls and not actual ratings from readers.
801634598383996928 2016-11-23 03:52:36 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DailyCaller talk about lewd behavior have u seen this woman in American Horror Story? Sex, murder, etc. Stop the madness & accept results.
801632659705393152 2016-11-23 03:44:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MagicRoyalty love it, especially the doomsday comment.
801631788716134400 2016-11-23 03:41:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @dcexaminer @varepall I don't recall the right doing this to Obama.
801630218448498688 2016-11-23 03:35:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders @POTUS correct me if I'm wrong, but hasn't Obama been the president for the last 8 years.
801629317696471040 2016-11-23 03:31:37 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @SenWarren stop wasting our time. Trump is further along in his transition than Obama was and he started before he was elected.
801592011744743424 2016-11-23 01:03:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheDemocrats yes, bye bye common core, thank goodness. Worst ever.
801590526776643584 2016-11-23 00:57:29 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders spoiled brats these days. Take out loans, join the military with college repayment, get a job. No free ride, I survived debt.
801539402656808960 2016-11-23 21:34:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill she has ulterior motives 2 help Clinton. Coincidently these are the 3 states supporters r asking Hillary to recount.
801515749030428672 2016-11-23 20:00:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill liberals are reaching now. They just can't believe she lost and will stop it at nothing to steal the election.

801437393291190272 2016-11-23 14:48:59 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @rotoexperts never fails, I suffered with his performance all yr & cut him 2 weeks ago for Rawls. Now he wants to play well.
801436281951686657 2016-11-23 14:44:34 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico strongly agree, the investigation should continue. If there is evidence then prosecute.
801435866589724672 2016-11-23 14:42:55 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill again how is this rating determined? Obama has been a disaster with foreign policy, domestic policy, extreme regs. Terrible
801423547092660224 2016-11-23 13:53:58 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNews@POTUS tryin 2 figure out why these folks r being awarded a freedom medal. I served in multiple deployments & these elitists awarded
801421686323236864 2016-11-23 13:46:34 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @GovHaleySC congrats on your new position. Now do all of us South Carolinians a favor & take Cheryl Stanton with u. Cancer 2 SC & DEW.
801420978689572864 2016-11-23 13:43:45 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill just like Obama and Clinton blaming others. Obama blames Bush, Clinton blames everyone & everything. Now I blame the media.
801420522353475584 2016-11-23 13:41:56 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill so sick of this, WHO CARES!!! She lost the election "MOVE ON" period
801411164718723072 2016-11-23 13:04:45 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @washingtonpost I can see that but not Sec of State.
801411002998865920 2016-11-23 13:04:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @washingtonpost if evidence surfaces, she needs 2 be prosecuted to the full extent of the law...
801410772379303936 2016-11-23 13:03:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics I like Mitt Romney, but loyalty and character are key to me. He lost both with the March tirade against Trump.
801410494796070913 2016-11-23 13:02:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill speculate there will be mutiny and violence in the streets if for some reason Trump isn't President after electors cast their vote
801409880317972480 2016-11-23 12:59:39 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNews is this some kind of joke? PD's R now fined 4 not hiring illegals. Is this America or am I living in an alternate universe.
801407463450939393 2016-11-23 12:50:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @scott_pianowski me either, I think Elliot has earned Rookie of the Year not MVP.
801404716827738113 2016-11-23 12:39:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico all it takes is one classified email outside of proper channels to be found guilty and subjected to punishment.

801403777643376640 2016-11-23 12:35:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN this is getting ridiculous. He is trying to bring on an administration and doesn't have the time to respond to everything. Give chance.

800074714077167617 2016-11-19 20:34:11 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill the hypocrisy here is that Melania is an immigrant, not born in the US.
800073618625626112 2016-11-19 20:29:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @AllenWest it's one thing 2 take a stand yourself, but 2 encourage others 2 discriminate is another. Where is the racism here on the left.
800058927912222721 2016-11-19 19:31:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @dcexaminer @varepall as a vet, repub & new VA employee, current Sec VA has done a tremendous job turning around VA in last 18 months.
800055111078780928 2016-11-19 19:16:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenatorSessions @SenWarren @FoxNews Even staunch critic Arlen Spector in his book admitted after the fact that he was wrong about sessions.
800054562111553536 2016-11-19 19:14:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @POTUS @WhiteHouse let's hope POTUS sticks 2 traditions of not speaking on new admin. Some how don't think it's possible 4 him 2 b quiet
800040292523147264 2016-11-19 18:17:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill easy 2 say in public. Trump donated 2 his campaign. Privately good friends...

800010944579452928 2016-11-19 16:20:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics this is one of the reasons I left the service. The military has always been a place of social changes forced by government
800010358081683456 2016-11-19 16:18:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenSanders what facts do u have that anyone has or is discriminating? Easy 2 call some a racist but proving it not so easy.
800009817213599744 2016-11-19 16:16:18 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump @politico it's so funny how race is always an issue. The right rewards hard work and the left rewards color. Hypocritical

799738185563652096 2016-11-18 22:16:56 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNews do these kids not know that the Secret Service take these actions seriously. Someone has already been arrested for making threat.
799737355196370949 2016-11-18 22:13:38 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I'm a fan of Petraeus, but concerned about his sharing of classified into with girlfriend.
799736233060691968 2016-11-18 22:09:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CutonDime25 @jfelton45 congrats
799736046057619457 2016-11-18 22:08:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @donnabrazile  is unfit to serve in any capacity with her record of colluding with Clinton Campaign.
799733123512561664 2016-11-18 21:56:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill I'm shocked the dems who are in the minority are going to fight the republicans on something.
799732898672902144 2016-11-18 21:55:56 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @smahaskey @politico who cares, since when did we get away from best person for the job. So sick of affirmative action.
799705440422653957 2016-11-18 20:06:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill what about shutting down alt left or extreme liberalism (katy perry, lady gaga, cher, Miley cyrus, dunham) I can do this all day
799697482057818113 2016-11-18 19:35:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @SenWarren ur ridiculous. Don't go away mad, just go away...
799697234174455808 2016-11-18 19:34:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLfantasy I will give it to Elliot as ROY but not MVP. How many rookies have won MVP in the past?
799696896906432512 2016-11-18 19:32:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill as a consumer, I stoped watching awhile ago for this reason (e.g. Caitlyn Jenner courage award, and specials on touchy topics.
799695931075690496 2016-11-18 19:29:02 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Medium @SenSanders why do u continue to use these inflammatory and divisive words. Just calling someone a racist, doesn't make it so.
799693426396536832 2016-11-18 19:19:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @foxnewspolitics this is ridiculous...
799684303366029312 2016-11-18 18:42:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill here we go again. Same thing happened to Romney's wife. But no prob with dressing Michelle Obama.
799633432829575168 2016-11-18 15:20:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump I've been harsh critic of Obama admin, but SecVA McDonald great job turning around VA. I'm getting positive feedback Vets.
799624981080481792 2016-11-18 14:47:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ThePME @FNTSYSportsNet monopoly...
799624663617765378 2016-11-18 14:45:50 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill that term wasn't used, get your facts straight. Besides Trump camp is saying the Muslim registry is untrue.
799621467138834432 2016-11-18 14:33:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico to quote Clinton, what difference does it make at this point".
799595975803170816 2016-11-18 12:51:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @wis10 has this been confirmed? There are lots of speculation on these appts, but no confirmation?
799582442042572800 2016-11-18 11:58:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill if that's the case then I'm assuming Warren will be next as she is the worst of them all.
799581767451758592 2016-11-18 11:55:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @P0Tus @FoxNews @P0TUS has a history of encouraging protest. What I find appalling is the lack of coverage to Trump supporters being attacked.
799581118085222404 2016-11-18 11:52:48 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @brianstelter @CNN @seanhannity sean, if they didn't ask for help then they wouldn't have anything 2 report on... Clinton News Network.
799580815818637312 2016-11-18 11:51:36 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill I concur, Cruz will make an excellent AG. Now convene a grand jury and prosecute Clinton for emails and foundation.
799579139736997888 2016-11-18 11:44:57 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill the reason she lost was because she was a failed candidate with a history of lying and corruption.
799578664073576448 2016-11-18 11:43:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @nytimes @realDonaldTrump ofcourse the failed NYT is saying that the plant wasnt planning to move to Mexico.
799577742941556736 2016-11-18 11:39:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @TheDemocrats @HillaryClinton why r we still talking about this loser.
799575988824895488 2016-11-18 11:32:25 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill like there's nothing more important for POTUS to discuss on his whirlwind tour.
799477084477263872 2016-11-17 04:59:25 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @washingtonpost just stop with the crappy news reporting. I am so done with the media and tuning u all out. Ur bias has been exposed.
799476475497971712 2016-11-17 04:56:59 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes @POTUS take a lesson from George W Bush and leave office with class and do not comment on your successor it makes u look foolish.
799475869370687489 2016-11-17 04:54:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Roto_Wizard almost as bad as the cleats with the tail hanging off it.
799474937224429572 2016-11-17 04:50:53 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump Obama is bragging that u will only roll back 20% of his policies. We elected u to undo all of his policies. We got ur back.
799462369332264960 2016-11-17 04:00:56 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @seanhannity absolutely, they can't help themselves.
799417029749075969 2016-11-17 01:00:46 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Obamas insinuating that Trump wasn't serious about being President.
799414428466868224 2016-11-17 00:50:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @POTUS @WhiteHouse is anyone else tired of POTUS preaching from a far. Stop whinning and making inflamatory stmts
799413957232472064 2016-11-17 00:48:34 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN he continues to be defiant & incite violent protests. Wouldn't be surprised if POTUS is doing this to declare Marshall law 2 stay in WH
799412965975932933 2016-11-17 00:44:38 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes i'd also say that Bernie needs to be held accountable for his rhetoric and lack of action.
799412630716715008 2016-11-17 00:43:18 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld BRADY, not even close and yes I was watching when Montana played.
799412006331748352 2016-11-17 00:40:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ESPNNFL what is that furry thing hanging off his leg?
799411416621023236 2016-11-17 00:38:28 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews this guy is the biggest idiotto everyone his mouth. Stck to comedy because u know nothing else.
799378005869019137 2016-11-17 22:25:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico @GeorgenPearl agreed, but history has shown us that many do not participate in the democratic or process of voting.
799349753842581504 2016-11-17 20:33:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Toyota @SportsNation additionally, I offer up Elliot as ROY not NFL MVP.
799294280078594052 2016-11-17 16:53:01 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Toyota @SportsNation Matt ryan. Brady shouldn't even be considered having 4 less games.
799289255994556416 2016-11-17 16:33:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @jones_drew32 @Michael_Fabiano @MarcasG @Jones_Drew32 @adamrank @JamesDKoh those teams get locked in my league.
799104292774887424 2016-11-16 04:18:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @philorbanWSOC9 @SiriusXMFantasy Benjamin or Landry this wk
799103292248911872 2016-11-16 04:14:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BernieSanders listen here socialist and I could call o other things. How does it feel to be labeled? Career politician with no results
799102740815368194 2016-11-16 04:11:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics these guys hate each other. Trump will bring him down if he defies him with immigration.
799102144443981824 2016-11-16 04:09:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MikeTriplett @SiriusXMFantasy thoughts on Fleener this am against CAR. Last time he had a rushing & receiving TD.
799100323738648576 2016-11-16 04:02:18 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @GregAmbrosius @SiriusXMFantasy jeffery, hopkins, Miller. More recently ware.
799086354076409856 2016-11-16 03:06:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico Lord help the democrats to turn to a self proclaimed socialist. May get youth, but who else.
799085728735043584 2016-11-16 03:04:18 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @POTUS @FoxNews great message outgoing POTUS, stop perpetuating the madness that we are seeing in the streets while you vacay overseas.
799084124564766720 2016-11-16 02:57:56 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CarlHigbie @FoxNews there is only 1 Pres at a time and therefore Obama needs to stop whinning in Greece and stop the violence n streets
799083525676867584 2016-11-16 02:55:33 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RealSkipBayless isn't he paid 2 play BBall. I wish I could just take a day off anytime I wanted to.
799080188646752256 2016-11-16 02:42:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @BernieSanders no u wouldn't have as a self proclaimed socialist the middle class would have broke more for Trump.
799076637950230530 2016-11-16 02:28:11 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews let's cutoff federal funding. I don't want my taxes to go to these left wing loonies.
799076287545491459 2016-11-16 02:26:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump @BilldeBlasio @FoxNews your the biggest joke of the country. Even your own party dislikes u. Criminal illegals r the goal.
799023386152357893 2016-11-16 22:56:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BernieSanders in your speech, plz urge your supporters 2 respect democracy & go back 2 class 2 learn about electoral college.
799017667978022916 2016-11-16 22:33:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill @BernieSanders didnt Bernie lose in the primary. So, why does he have any right 2 say anything about Pres elect Trump. LOSER!!!
799013260464951296 2016-11-16 22:16:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nikkihaley @realDonaldTrump @thestate @BristowatHome wrong job for Haley. Lacks experience in this area. Sec of Labor or Commerce better.
799011076029501440 2016-11-16 22:07:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheDemocrats stop the madness and accept the defeat of the democract party and work with republicans on this issue
799005265563701249 2016-11-16 21:44:34 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill let's stop federal funding to all public institutions that allow this. They should be in class learning about electoral college.
799004708862132224 2016-11-16 21:42:22 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @wis10 no way, I can't see her in this position. If any maybe Secretary of Labor or Commerce.
798997225636564993 2016-11-16 21:12:37 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill who cares, he is the minority leader. The majority leader brings bills to the floor.
798970920949911552 2016-11-16 19:28:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @espn @KingJames I'm sick of the PC Police. U can't say anything without offending someone which is one of many reasons why Trump is Pres.
798970039193903104 2016-11-16 19:24:36 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SandraTXAS @varepall of course it is. I would argue that the supposed hate crimes are being committed by these same ppl. #WIKILEAKS
798969534904291328 2016-11-16 19:22:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Michael_Fabiano in my money league, teams are locked when they are out of the playoffs.
798968548815208449 2016-11-16 19:18:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @washingtonpost awesome, get this passed and take action against these institutions.
798967967568384000 2016-11-16 19:16:22 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SenatorBoxer @FoxNews it won't be taken up by Senate majority leader.
798963132425191429 2016-11-16 18:57:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill liberals only whine when they lose. Funny that media outlets said that if the right protests it would threaten our deomocracy.
798961265628610565 2016-11-16 18:49:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @POTUS @WhiteHouse funny how media outlets said that if the right were to protest that it would be threat democracy.No one's saying that now
798784319493804032 2016-11-15 07:06:37 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill who cares, she lost plain and simple.
798778628674752512 2016-11-15 06:44:00 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FFdeJENerate better bye week TE Rudolph or Fleener?
798778415360790528 2016-11-15 06:43:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @footballdiehard better bye week TE Rudolph or Fleener
798732175046803456 2016-11-15 03:39:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNews former Obama chief of staff is delusional. Cutting federal funding is just the first step. Then the Fed's will come & take them out
798725762836791296 2016-11-15 03:13:56 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump stay the course and tone out the leftist media pundits.
798725477619953664 2016-11-15 03:12:48 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @glennbeck @CNN Beck is pandering 2 the left with divisive rhetoric. I remember when he had a show on Fox. Wow times have changed.
798706096894595072 2016-11-15 01:55:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill are these true? We already know that several reports were false.
798704648488185856 2016-11-15 01:50:02 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SiriusXMFantasy pitta
798696920059363328 2016-11-15 01:19:19 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews how many of these are true. We already know of the one with the woman claiming white men knocked hijab off is a hoax.
798696317572804608 2016-11-15 01:16:55 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNewsInsider @FoxNews didn't Trump win Michigan giving him 306?
798695189527334913 2016-11-15 01:12:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @tonyromo @FFdeJENerate your a class act Tony.
798687463472504833 2016-11-15 00:41:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill will take an act of Congress to get this passed. No way states are going 2 give up political power to appease the liberal left.
798655681020641281 2016-11-15 22:35:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill who determines this, because I have never been asked my opinion on the presidents approval rating. I'm sure there all democrats.
798602958380244992 2016-11-15 19:05:57 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @PFF_Fantasy didn't matter as his production was dismal. Dropped him for Gates.
798600641300008960 2016-11-15 18:56:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill here we go again, dems do not accept responsibility for anything even when it hits them in the face...
798599879887097857 2016-11-15 18:53:43 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill let's hope he stays there.
798531058144710656 2016-11-15 14:20:14 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @YahooFantasy Ryan, Ware, Miller, Jeffery, Benjamin, Boswell all underperformed. Robinson-Gates-Rams Def overperformed. Now 5-5 on season.
798529451252469760 2016-11-15 14:13:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @washingtonpost this is going 2 far. Cutoff federal funding to these institutions and let them sink or swim...
798389520580431874 2016-11-14 04:57:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RealSkipBayless the boys are not going to the SB. I got them losing in the Championship game.
798371343112736768 2016-11-14 03:45:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CoryBooker you are all perpetuating the very thing you claim to uphold, the constitution. Stop the madness & support or get out of the way.
798368291941126144 2016-11-14 03:33:28 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews despicable, he should be subjected to the same tortue.
798362090117402624 2016-11-14 03:08:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill boo hoo, r we really allowing public servants to whine over an election.
798361237788782597 2016-11-14 03:05:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics she is such a hypocrict, just a week ago she was denouncing Trump in a vicious way. Trump got the last laugh....
798359911415488512 2016-11-14 03:00:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @megynkelly @FoxNews @kurtbardella sounded 2 me like the Bannon associate was bitter and couldn't definitively definitivelyprovide substance
798334327415259136 2016-11-14 01:18:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MattHarmon_BYB he was still mouring the election of Trump instead of his job on the football field.
798332813552521216 2016-11-14 01:12:29 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews undocumented criminals, get it right for once...
798327422961602560 2016-11-14 00:51:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNewsInsider @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews this is why there are so many killings in Chicago.
798327012028981248 2016-11-14 00:49:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill great piece, especially the part about no protesting from the right after Romney's loss in 2012.
798323422237523970 2016-11-14 00:35:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews when the media stops covering these protests. They will stop and have gained nothing...
798297058117611521 2016-11-14 22:50:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill go back to bed and stop crying. Move on and work with Trump.
798296780010037253 2016-11-14 22:49:18 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico sounds good, let her go...
798296642722074624 2016-11-14 22:48:45 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill she isn't above the law and if there is evidence then she should be prosecuted for her crimes.
798285563711234048 2016-11-14 22:04:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill Noah is full of s**t, and is perpetuating this as a race war. Face it your candidate was flawed and mired in scandal.
798284893532917760 2016-11-14 22:02:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN my candidate won and feeling great about it.
798260091069689856 2016-11-14 20:23:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @pfrumors is this true?
798259018720542720 2016-11-14 20:19:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill we all know that these violent attacks were from paid supporters of Hillary Clinton, thanks Wikileaks...
798249620321292288 2016-11-14 19:41:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico @blakehounshell give it up, sore losers...

797602951812550656 2016-11-12 00:52:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill the story of the Muslim woman having her hijab removed was a hoax. She made it up and being charged 4 false report.
797594378344734720 2016-11-12 00:18:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nytimes so ironic with all of the jokes and nasty things he said about Trump. Trump can now undue his legacy if he chooses.

797542182009835521 2016-11-12 20:50:48 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MMFlint this is a democratic society and Trump was elected. Neither u or any of your misguided adolescent phonies r going 2 change that.

796988980201979904 2016-11-11 08:12:34 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill if she broke the law then she should face prosecution. No one is above the law, no one.

796908280786337792 2016-11-10 02:51:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BernieSanders u r mistaken if u think Trump is targeting minorities. Now is a time of healing and unity, stop stoking the flames.

796897908926902273 2016-11-10 02:10:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill as usual there is no accountability in the democracy party. Its Bush's fault, Comey, the boogeyman. Get over it and move forward.

796459166617530368 2016-11-09 21:07:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @frankthorp @wis10 I bet that was a tough pill to swallow.
796330956454064132 2016-11-09 12:37:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SNLUpdate Trump has the last laugh... Tell Hollywood elites to start packing their bags and tell me how the weather is in Canada...
796324670463234049 2016-11-09 12:12:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill typical when r dems going to take responsibility. Oh, let's blame Bush, Comey, etc. No one forced Clinton 2 have a private server
796311841404293120 2016-11-09 11:21:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico funny how Cuban is now trying to be the ultimate healer. He said some nasty stuff about President Trump.

796265480092872704 2016-11-09 08:17:39 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @mcuban funny, how you have changed your tone now that Trump is victorious. If Clinton had won you would be shouting from the rafters.
796257260691406850 2016-11-08 07:44:59 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill pack your bags and get out of the Country.

796255772141350912 2016-11-08 07:39:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics this guy is a racist. I heard it live and he was tearing up. You need 2 change your thinking not the rest of the country.

796146168631853056 2016-11-08 00:23:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TEN_GOP not surprised. Romney didn't get a so,for vote in several counties in PA

796143228391223296 2016-11-08 00:11:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill Is such has ruined any chance of ever being President after acting like a child and skipping the convention.

796066334228566017 2016-11-08 19:06:18 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @EdWerderespn isn't the kickers name Dan Carpenter. Regardless it was a personal foul not called. Was the difference in the game.
796047120667209728 2016-11-08 17:49:58 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @daverichard @BradyHenderson is Rawls or Dion Lewis worth a waiver claim rest of the season.
795995794977542144 2016-11-08 14:26:01 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @theScore the hit on the WR at the end of the game was. Sherman is a dirty player.
795995467867975681 2016-11-08 14:24:43 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @undisputed @RealSkipBayless and it cost Buffalo a shot at OT.
795988783741202433 2016-11-08 13:58:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics isn't this illegal? I remember Bill shaking hands at a polling station in 2012
795988354852601856 2016-11-08 13:56:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews who cares, when did this become national news. Such media bias it's sickening.
795984757905563648 2016-11-08 13:42:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill really, there is still an investigation into her corrupt Clinton Foundation.
795983994596786176 2016-11-08 13:39:07 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @washingtonpost I go Harry, she is beautiful...
795983827592183809 2016-11-08 13:38:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Deena_CNN @CNNPolitics ridiculous..
795969960644317184 2016-11-08 12:43:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFL @ShaunOHara60 @gmfb BLUF, blown call on the roughing the kicker & the Sherman lay out of receiver in the end zone at end of game.
795853993541042176 2016-11-07 05:02:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @EdWerderespn @mlombardifoxtv @Edwerderespn come on man, did u c the same game I did? Refs blew several calls in this one.
795853595732283393 2016-11-07 05:00:58 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Deadspin @Roto_Wizard wait isn't that a penalty. Refs really bad in this game. Hard 4 Bills 2 Beat Seahawks & refs
795853105392996352 2016-11-07 04:59:01 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @HillaryClinton another lie.
795851178085122048 2016-11-07 04:51:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @AdamSchefter my theory the so-called really good defenses: seattle, denver, Minnesota get away with calls. They are too physical & no calls
795850094293774336 2016-11-07 04:47:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill what a joke
795849612007538688 2016-11-07 04:45:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @wingoz @ESPNNFL very exciting game.
795841310481666048 2016-11-07 04:12:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @HillaryClinton these are all the things that your campaign has been doing, wikileaks proved that beyond a shadow of a doubt.
795840013489631232 2016-11-07 04:06:59 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @PFF_Fantasy @Urkedout ware doesn't have a history of concussions, so I'm confused why he hasn't returned to action like most NFL players.
795839306954842112 2016-11-07 04:04:11 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld LeBron focus on your own sport instead of criticising another.
795838631206391808 2016-11-07 04:01:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @POTUS @politico hope u say, Hillary has run the most negative campaign in history... What hope, if she wins we all lose...
795838304658853889 2016-11-07 04:00:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @KirkHerbstreit @Joe96223031 Kirk please correct the record here, UM is the univ of Miami not Michigan. Its all about the "U"

795828132712423425 2016-11-07 03:19:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @PostGraphics @washingtonpost looks pretty good to me.
795827957826781184 2016-11-07 03:19:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RealSkipBayless for once I agree with you skip. Starting 2 think Drew Brees maybe onto something regarding the loss of viewers.
795827332355424256 2016-11-07 03:16:36 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BillPlaschke agreed, clearly a personal foul on Sherman
795827196753510401 2016-11-07 03:16:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MikeClayNFL absolutely, the refs blew that one. Clearly a personal foul on Sherman
795826546254741504 2016-11-07 03:13:29 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @mcuban @SopanDeb I would argue that you win that label handedly
795825583720644613 2016-11-07 03:09:39 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @mcuban @smclaughlin9 @KirkAndCallahan what's deflating is reading your liberal bias crap...

795760200359809025 2016-11-07 22:49:50 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @footballdiehard should I put in a waiver claim for Dion Lewis or Paul Perkins, I have Jennings. But will also drop a 2nd def.

795489557030572032 2016-11-06 04:54:24 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @mcuban @Khanoisseur BLUF the corrupt DOJ is refusing to prosecute crooked Hillary. She is guilty 4 having classified docs on unsecure sys

794738327719149572 2016-11-04 03:09:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN @HillaryClinton from the CMAs to Clinton supporter to protesting the police. Worst entertainer ever...
794737866282823680 2016-11-04 03:07:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNN @HillaryClinton he is the worst surrogate imagineable. Talk about hypocrisy with language and reference to women.
794737192891510784 2016-11-04 03:04:46 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @KingJames campaigning for Clinton will damage your brand. She's corrupt and it is all coming to bare. Think twice, u heard it here first.
794730650712625152 2016-11-04 02:38:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @footballdiehard SD or MIA as a streaming def, dropping gillislee & starting mccoy.

794673703057559552 2016-11-04 22:52:29 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ESPNNFL I am hoping 2 drop gillislee to either pickup a bye week Def or Reels or Dion Lewis.
794668383262375936 2016-11-04 22:31:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @nflnetwork @CharleyCasserly boo, Ryan has put up the stats most yards and TDs
794664963696640001 2016-11-04 22:17:46 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill so hypocritical, why doesn't the DOJ convene a grand jury into Clinton pay 4 play scheme plenty of evidence to prove it.
794664429723992064 2016-11-04 22:15:38 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @imrob79 thanks 4 your service, I'm retired Army.
794663630205779968 2016-11-04 22:12:28 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @HillaryClinton then start with your own party, equal pay for women. Talk is cheap.
794663296787943424 2016-11-04 22:11:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill why is this a story. Remember when Romney was secretly recorded that had an impact on the election and liberal media ran with it.
794662798320140289 2016-11-04 22:09:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU @SBNationCFB starting at QB, OL and WR

794645286664732673 2016-11-04 20:59:34 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @JameyEisenberg is it safe to drop gillisle for a replacement Def this week, I have mccoy  But Lewis and earls on waivers
794644996720852992 2016-11-04 20:58:25 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Michael_Fabiano liking Mike James more
794638279207505920 2016-11-04 20:31:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @mcuban @HeidiPrzybyla @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump dude, stop the madness. The only one taking bribes is Clinton & her foundation.
794634023972798464 2016-11-04 20:14:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @BernieSanders @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Bernie you got your 15 seconds of fame and just can't let go. Don't go away mad just go away
794625097340424192 2016-11-04 19:39:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld Matt Ryan is the MVP for now with the most passing yards and TDs
794615738237681665 2016-11-04 19:02:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FoxNews any word on why there were technical difficulties for FNC and CNN, but MSNBC had no difficulties.
794576985049669633 2016-11-04 16:28:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Michael_Fabiano @Browns thoughts on dropping NE Def for the rest of the year for: BAL, RAMs, SD, TENN or not play a DEF this week?
794575624996343809 2016-11-04 16:22:46 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @WhiteHouse actual unemploy rate is around 11%
794575516183490560 2016-11-04 16:22:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @WhiteHouse this is deceiving to the avg person. Labor participation rate is down and those out that fell out of the workforce not counted.
794573933689323520 2016-11-04 16:16:02 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @LouDobbs any update on the outage
794573729078661120 2016-11-04 16:15:14 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @SellsKristin @GunnetteP how funny.
794555362296918028 2016-11-04 15:02:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @garthbrooks #TheDance is my favorite @GarthBrooks song. What's yours? The Ultimate Collection is at @Target 11.11 #MoreMusic https://cards.twitter.com/cards/1h1e35/2i7y9

794553895733366784 2016-11-04 14:56:25 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @LouDobbs very interesting, I just checked and CNN is also experiencing technical difficulties.
794552641879674882 2016-11-04 14:51:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Mr_Mike6514 maybe not as CNN is down too
794550335075393541 2016-11-04 14:42:16 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> Is it a coincidence that Fox News is having Technical difficulties for the 1st time ever, I don't think so...
794484978159591424 2016-11-04 10:22:34 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics not surprised, she lied at every turn it can't remember.
794386965378560004 2016-11-03 03:53:06 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLfantasy @imrob79 NE Def has been underperforming against lesser talented offenses.
794380662044246016 2016-11-03 03:28:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @UPROXX @jasoninthehouse @mcuban conspiracy theorist.
794380231545069568 2016-11-03 03:26:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLfantasy @imrob79 I hope so. Thoughts on picking up Baltimores def & dropping NE rest of the season.
794377716510453761 2016-11-03 03:16:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RealSkipBayless Ryan for MVP...
794377543956701184 2016-11-03 03:15:39 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @washingtonpost neither should have been involved with the CMAs in the first place.
794376971165794304 2016-11-03 03:13:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld I disagree, Matt Ryan is the MVP. Leads the league in yards and TDs.
794376210868473857 2016-11-03 03:10:22 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics shocked that a member of the Clinton News Network did that.
794374442319278080 2016-11-03 03:03:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill there u go, she lied to Congress and should be disqualified 4 president.

794368264612757507 2016-11-03 02:38:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @footballdiehard should I drop ME DEF for Baltimore rest of the year. NE DEF is under performing
794367901658660871 2016-11-03 02:37:21 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLfantasy @imrob79 this week I have to play Jennings and maybe gillisle as Miller is on bye and mccoy injured.

793765340572487680 2016-11-02 10:42:59 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill I would argue that Hillary is worse as she is corrupt and untrustworthy
793644764725964800 2016-11-01 02:43:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Jeff_Erickson Enron is on the waiver wire, is he a better option to drop Cleaner for, but hasn't had bye yet?

793503440576114692 2016-11-01 17:22:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill I don't get it. Cuban is wrong on this, as a top secret clearance holder you cannot have classified material on an unsecure system.
793480005728821254 2016-11-01 15:49:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLWrld no wat, he couldn't hack the pro game in Miami. Much less the media capital of the world in NYC.

793467760948961280 2016-11-01 15:00:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @POTUS @iamsambee @politico her critcism is because she is corrupt & brought all if this on herself. She needs to stop blaming others.

793275571761537024 2016-10-31 02:16:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @politico The Hill reported that US Officials found no link between Russia & Trump. Get the story right...

791717639521435648 2016-10-27 19:06:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @realDonaldTrump The hipocracy of FLOTUS with Hillary in NC "If u can't keep ur house in order, how can u keep the White House in order"
791716933141950465 2016-10-27 19:03:20 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FLOTUS @HillaryClinton LMAO, over the hipocracy. "If u can't keep your own house in order, you can't keep the White House in order".
791714680117100544 2016-10-27 18:54:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @FLOTUS @HillaryClinton funny being that FLOTUS said if u can't run your own house, you can't run the White House...
791659134038925312 2016-10-27 15:13:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @JeffRatcliffe @ChrisDiRedo tough choice, but at this point Dixon, is Jennings worth dropping for either of these or Rob Kelly
791658857206460416 2016-10-27 15:12:34 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheDemocrats why so u can shove your liberal agenda down our throats like the failed Obamacare legislation?
791658472790044673 2016-10-27 15:11:02 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @HillaryClinton @AP r u just now realizing this after 30 years in office. I know service members whom u treated badly, stop trying 2 care.
791611193257369600 2016-10-27 12:03:10 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill try reporting on the voting machines in TX that are changing votes from Trump to Clinton. Talk about over yeah if the Dems cheat.
791607989191008257 2016-10-27 11:50:26 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @footballdiehard would u drop Robinson for Rob Kelly. I have Landry, Benjamin, & Jeffrey in a 14tm ppr? Start 2.
791434960775352320 2016-10-26 00:22:53 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill when her contract is up, let her go FOX.
791432429252804610 2016-10-26 00:12:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill his loss. Standing on your morals will affect your pocket book.
791428794846416896 2016-10-26 23:58:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill really, just another attempt to pander to the African American community. They see through this.

791299166001467396 2016-10-26 15:23:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Jeff_Mans need 2: Alston Jeffrey, Allen Robinson, Kelvin Benjamin. Starting Alshon and Benjamin.

791236630283685888 2016-10-26 11:14:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill really, do u think we believe anything coming out of the most transparent admin ever! Her emails were not http://state.gov.
791037056743006208 2016-10-25 22:01:45 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill funny how this is in unqualifying, but the fact that she has demeaned every race and gender is. Give me a break...
791036124902875136 2016-10-25 21:58:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill BS, typical democractic response is to deny, deny, deny & oh blame the Russians. I'm sick of the corruption.
791031252325457920 2016-10-25 21:38:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Tedschuster @Jeff_Mans @SiriusXMFantasy Allen Robinson and Alshon Jeffrey.
790989687489957888 2016-10-25 18:53:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFLfantasy Allen Robinson, however starting Jeffrey with Cutler back at the helm against tough MIN def.
790989460775329796 2016-10-25 18:52:37 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @voxdotcom @HillaryClinton not in comparison to the inflation rate, therefore there is less take home pay. Stop trying 2 frame these stats.
790989145921490944 2016-10-25 18:51:22 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @WLTX @AshleyIzbicki Lou is great, I have had the pleasure of working with her on a number of workforce issues at the state level.

790739520094363648 2016-10-24 02:19:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @HillaryClinton your a fraud and could never trust u to run this country.
790738712393052160 2016-10-24 02:16:14 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ESPNNFL didn't Brock just complete one over 10yrds.
790736994838142976 2016-10-24 02:09:25 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill just another diversion from Dems. Funny, no one is disputing authenticity of emails only that STOLEN and Russia did it...
790735512428507138 2016-10-24 02:03:31 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @HillaryClinton as a former Soldier, I prefer someone who tells it like it is rather than someone who runs with their tail between legs...
790730217195237376 2016-10-24 01:42:29 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @HeraldSports @TheStateOfTheU lets hope so. We need to stop the losing.
790729607221747714 2016-10-24 01:40:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill what did Hillary promise Sanders? It must have been something pretty big for u to continue to support her in light of emails.
790727295073972224 2016-10-24 01:30:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics funny, a lot of people laugh at the POTUS for his policies and lack of enforcement on immigration, red line, etc.
790726893012156416 2016-10-24 01:29:16 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @daverichard @ChesterPitts any word on his staus?

790698691925540865 2016-10-24 23:37:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @HillaryClinton @POTUS @politico POTUS don't go away mad, just go away!!!
790697080943771653 2016-10-24 23:30:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill when was the last time Ethan Hawke was relevant? These Hollywood elites need 2 stay out of politics. Hate 4 his career 2 suffer.
790666380769128448 2016-10-24 21:28:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Jeff_Mans u r the man. Loved your rant on SirusXM on DK.
790614555848241152 2016-10-24 18:02:53 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @heykayadams @ProFootballTalk great news for Jeffrey owners...

790293913248624640 2016-10-23 20:48:46 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DanScavino @TeamTrump is this where she supposedly landed under fire? As a soldier, I am appaled.
790292643448324096 2016-10-23 20:43:43 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Jeff_Mans done with Robinson...
790234683422441472 2016-10-23 16:53:25 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill no way, worse divide than with Obama.
790234400873119748 2016-10-23 16:52:17 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @daverichard McCoy or gillislee; only 2RBS Dressed.
790223936776699905 2016-10-23 16:10:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @ESPNFantasy McCoy or Gillislee in the 1Flex?
790219343351181312 2016-10-23 15:52:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Jeff_Mans @FantasyAlarm @Tedschuster McCoy or Gillislee? Jeff Darlington said McCoy looked good in warmups, but shefter said snap count.
790189315078909952 2016-10-23 13:53:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @daverichard agreed, I have McCoy and Gillislee. Who should I play. Leaning gillisilee
790042943151280129 2016-10-22 04:11:30 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @KingJames no way bron
790042446906306560 2016-10-22 04:09:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU glad for this OSU loss. Still upset over the 2003 Fiesta Bowl and the phantom pass interference call 2 decide the natl champ
790041503896829952 2016-10-22 04:05:47 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @RealSkipBayless happy happy joy joy OSU went down...
789985222813184004 2016-10-22 00:22:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @AdamRonis thoughts on playing McCoy if he's active or roll with Gillislee in a McCoy limited role?
789984329401266176 2016-10-22 00:18:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @wis10 headline would be animal center employee beat to death if this were my dog...
789978606562844673 2016-10-22 23:55:51 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @footballdiehard thoughts on McCoy if he plays. Should I start McCoy or gillislee?
789899756776529920 2016-10-22 18:42:32 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill curt do u and don't worry about the pundits. They are mostly left wing lunatics with an agenda...
789882470409854976 2016-10-22 17:33:50 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill then she will ruin this country. She has already pledged to use executive orders to push her agenda.
789882053177245696 2016-10-22 17:32:11 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @HillaryClinton @politico again, why does Oprahs opinion matter. People won't be swayed by her comments.
789814937635983361 2016-10-22 13:05:29 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @footballdiehard need 1WR & 1Flex: Robinson, Landry, Spencer Ware, Jennings. Starting Lamar miller, McCoy/gilleslee, Ryan, Fleener, NE DEF
789809206845181952 2016-10-22 12:42:43 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MiamiHEAT as a soldier and Heat fan, so digusted at how the organization could allow a singer 2 kneel during national anthem #Nolongerafan
789655801107480576 2016-10-21 02:33:08 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @DrRoto @SiriusXMFantasy @TheGr3atSantini @ScoutFantasy ware against NO especially if Charles doesn't play.
789626549213523968 2016-10-21 00:36:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @JamesDKoh @NFLfantasy he still looks hurt to me. He can't separate from coverage.
789625384153276416 2016-10-21 00:32:16 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @washingtonpost yes, just like not calling her out for all of the leaked emails.
789625069060386816 2016-10-21 00:31:01 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @HillaryClinton really Michelle, I seem 2 remember u saying if u can't keep ur own house in order, how can u keep the white house in order
789589805915000832 2016-10-21 22:10:54 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @mortreport @AdamSchefter @pfrumors who would trade for a QB with his injury history?
789587833845678080 2016-10-21 22:03:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @HillaryClinton u got to be kidding me with this crap. Illegals can join the military and get fast tracked to citizenship. Was a BCT BN XO.
789500912503025664 2016-10-21 16:17:40 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @danmericaCNN @CNNPolitics this story needs to go away, as a soldier I feel for the Khan family, but Khan put himself into this situation.
789498325011730432 2016-10-21 16:07:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill this is ludacris, I wanted Wallace to press Hillary on pay 4 play and the videos which he did not. He pressed Don more #ailesidiot
789313020132548609 2016-10-20 03:51:03 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @MattHarmon_BYB I will bench Jeffrey next week regardless.
789309287357157376 2016-10-20 03:36:13 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @melissastark @Michael_Fabiano just one game against a weak defense.
789309004208037888 2016-10-20 03:35:05 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @PeterAriz u could have fooled me. VT looked like the Patriots and UM looked like the Bad News Bears.
789308403835400194 2016-10-20 03:32:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @NFL @nflnetwork boo, I'm going against Cobb and I have Jeffrey.
789307334782816256 2016-10-20 03:28:27 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Michael_Fabiano no, started Jeffrey and disappointed with his performance. Not all his fault as Hoyer was throwing 2 him early.
789297856632860672 2016-10-20 02:50:48 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @varepall there not going to as the FBI and DOJ are in it together to protect and elect Hillary at all cost...
789296493815554048 2016-10-20 02:45:23 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU now 0-3 in the ACC.
789257821279911936 2016-10-20 00:11:42 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheStateOfTheU switching over 2 the CHI - GB game it might be more competitive. Losing faith in the "U" this year...
789250942189395970 2016-10-20 23:44:22 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @TheDemocrats come on, who r u kidding here. Lining her pockets is all that she cares about...
789237947165990914 2016-10-20 22:52:44 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill wonder if she is going the Madonna route to convince people 2 vote 4 Clinton...
789236481550327808 2016-10-20 22:46:55 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @LifeZette @HillaryClinton @BernieSanders @TeamTrump obviously her pleas went unanswered.
789236219817361408 2016-10-20 22:45:52 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @foxnewspolitics remember whel Pelosi said we need to pass it in order to know what's in it. Well we know now u can't keep doc and prems up
789234697029255169 2016-10-20 22:39:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSSports @JameyEisenberg @shettyshopping1 yes, yes. Howard has a tough matchup against GB.
789234442938290176 2016-10-20 22:38:49 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics I seem 2 remember Barrak Hussain pushing hope & change. We r in worse shape now than before he took office...
789233785942466560 2016-10-20 22:36:12 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @budlight @packers @ChicagoBears @NFL da bears, need Alyson 2 put up big numbers.
789233221414289408 2016-10-20 22:33:57 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @foxnewspolitics this is a legacy issue for Obama, his signture accomplishment going up in flames.
789232957676544000 2016-10-20 22:32:55 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @Rotoworld_FB what, he has already been ruled out...
789232764960792576 2016-10-20 22:32:09 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @thehill tell me something I didn't already know. She will fundamentally alter the course of this country for the foreseeable future.
789231784970096644 2016-10-20 22:28:15 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics absolutely, she did, just like in her emails. #Unqualufiedforpresident
789231115525562368 2016-10-20 22:25:35 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CBSNews that's because America is weak because of the policies of the current administration.
789213621754728448 2016-10-20 21:16:04 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @chrismeaney @ThePME @rotoexperts now that McCoy is out do u slide Gillislee in at the same position.
789138778854219776 2016-10-20 16:18:41 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @footballdiehard need 1 WR & 1 Flex: Robinson, Landry, Spencer Ware, & Rashad Jennings in a 14tm ppr. Starting Jeffrey, miller, mccoy(gillis
789123587852697600 2016-10-20 15:18:19 UTC <Mr_Mike6514> @CNNPolitics did we watch the same debate, Clinton did not answer ques on pay 2 play or videos instead she pivoted #FailedPolitician
