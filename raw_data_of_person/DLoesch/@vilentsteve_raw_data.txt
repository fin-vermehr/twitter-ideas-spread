968052950491832320 2018-02-26 09:19:43 UTC <vilentsteve> @AMDWaters The article states the trans-man WANTS to wrestle against boys, but the law requires people to compete according to sex on birth certificate.  Not sure what right answer is, but I don't think this student is at fault.

825100454463823872 2017-01-27 21:57:32 UTC <vilentsteve> @Twitter @RealJamesWoods it was due to gay porn posting, not the islam post.
823133340882452481 2017-01-22 11:40:56 UTC <vilentsteve> @mitchellvii He is a dick, and it is wrong to attack people.  Both of those things are true, regardless of anyone's point of view.

797466813051219969 2016-11-12 15:51:19 UTC <vilentsteve> @RichardDawkins @IanAdAstra I am in favor of carrying on normally and seeing how things play out.

741395675049385985 2016-06-10 22:24:38 UTC <vilentsteve> @Evolutionistrue @IanAdAstra history is replete with gov'ts that have become tyrannical. Small arms have their uses, look at Iraq & Vietnam.
741385004672901121 2016-06-10 21:42:14 UTC <vilentsteve> @Evolutionistrue @IanAdAstra it is not about parity. It is for defending against a gov't gone tyrannical.
