960694397535834113 2018-02-05 01:59:27 UTC <Erailtrain> @CNN @FUTrumpHaters @JustBeejay Are you serious?  Has the weeks news events passed thorough your mind without any basic understanding? The Dossier was made up, it was paid for by the DNC and HRC.  I get it, you hate Trump, but that wont change the facts. Trump should fire all senior FBI and prosecute them.
960693056235122688 2018-02-05 01:54:08 UTC <Erailtrain> @CNN CNN get a clue, you dont go to the FISA court with dossier paid for by the DNC and HRC. Its pretty simple really. This is nuts, Obama using our FBI to go after a political candidate. Even if you hate Trump, the whole thing is illegal and you should be reporting facts.

960666182687670272 2018-02-05 00:07:20 UTC <Erailtrain> @jaketlussier @udacity These advanced nanodegrees could be more accessible if you added a structured pre-requisite beginner phase.  Currently we have a suggested list or we can take intro to self driving, which also has a pre-req list.  Please add beginner phases.  Thanks
960370717563867136 2018-02-04 04:33:16 UTC <Erailtrain> @udacity I really want to explore this but your pre-req lists arent very clear.  Why not create beginner phases for all your complex nanodegrees, a real path to knowledge.  Save time and money. A new level of nanodegree education.
960258170777100288 2018-02-04 21:06:03 UTC <Erailtrain> @udacity Please add cohesive all-inclusive beginner phases.  The current pre-req suggestions are inadequate. Thank you

957908275306967040 2018-01-29 09:28:24 UTC <Erailtrain> @udacity an ordered comprehensive nanodegree seems money well spent.  The biggest stopper for me, is trying to figure out if I have enough prerequisite or not. The lists arent helpful, give us Abinitio nanodegree options.  Thanks
957907106933305344 2018-01-29 09:23:46 UTC <Erailtrain> @udacity why not divide the harder nanodegree programs into beginner, intermediate and advanced?  You could have all the prerequisite courses in the beginner and the move to int and advanced would be seamless.  A lot of nanodegrees lack a clear path for beginners.
