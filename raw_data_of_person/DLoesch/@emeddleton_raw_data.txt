971061858458193920 2018-03-06 16:36:03 UTC <emeddleton> I need to pay for a better spell checker. :-)https://twitter.com/emeddleton/status/971046866430214144
971046866430214144 2018-03-06 15:36:28 UTC <emeddleton> Is this what you het when you pay for higher education?https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/970775447347675136
971018341883129858 2018-03-06 13:43:08 UTC <emeddleton> @CHSommers A diversity dean????  Why do schools waste so much money.  I thought colleges were supposed to provide an education, not to be in need of one.
971008315638497280 2018-03-06 13:03:17 UTC <emeddleton> Please, blame the individual, not the human race.  Also, think about the stories that get published and who the major media admires.https://twitter.com/APDiploWriter/status/970870643993513984
970652198001565696 2018-03-05 13:28:12 UTC <emeddleton> Just because you think certain ideals are preferable does not make it so.  Give people in your country a choice and protect them from those who initiate violence against them.https://twitter.com/khamenei_ir/status/970291512922828801
970643874921160710 2018-03-05 12:55:08 UTC <emeddleton> Come and try to take them.https://twitter.com/khamenei_ir/status/970288285871427584
970156483559145472 2018-03-03 04:38:24 UTC <emeddleton> @SteveMartinToGo Good one.  You had me laughing out loud.
970033735616798720 2018-03-03 20:30:39 UTC <emeddleton> @rollcall Is that why we are spending so much tax payer dollars on alternative energy?  Those pesky Russians are causing us to many problems with wasting money.
970003385305845760 2018-03-03 18:30:03 UTC <emeddleton> @realDonaldTrump We are with you, Mr. President.  #MAGA
969424463480602624 2018-03-01 04:09:37 UTC <emeddleton> "Dirty Harry" is needed back in San Francisco.https://twitter.com/RealJamesWoods/status/969275607820283904
969208437543325698 2018-03-01 13:51:13 UTC <emeddleton> @HillaryClinton Do you need mental help?  And please do not try a false flag operation to avoid what you did.
969207975926624257 2018-03-01 13:49:23 UTC <emeddleton> Do you think the Obama administration covered up for Bush?  No investigation by Obama.  I wonder why. https://twitter.com/layla_lsm/status/968906025930821635
968260813914963968 2018-02-26 23:05:42 UTC <emeddleton> How many of the judges are your kind of Republican (ahem - never trumpers)?  Not an arguement.https://twitter.com/JoeNBC/status/967549793122881536
968212771316707328 2018-02-26 19:54:47 UTC <emeddleton> You are showing how little you value other people's lives and property.  It is not reasonable or right to do what Soros did or is doing.https://twitter.com/unburdenings/status/967880871008260097
967873007636004864 2018-02-25 21:24:41 UTC <emeddleton> @DineshDSouza Trick question. People who are NRA members have the courage to stop the shooter, the FBI and the Sheriff deputies obviously didn't.
965972427883782146 2018-02-20 15:32:28 UTC <emeddleton> @thehill He would not be taking tax deductions if he wanted to pay more.  He just wants other people to pay more.  What a fraud.
962088091736457217 2018-02-09 22:17:30 UTC <emeddleton> @BetteMidler Are you suggesting violence against  the senator?
962087804636356608 2018-02-09 22:16:22 UTC <emeddleton> @BetteMidler Come on, you are better than that. Do you really like the idea of our Congress voting to take money from babies.  Where are all the adults who should know they need to pay for what they use instead of making children who cannot vote be responsible for their debt.
962078251190398977 2018-02-09 21:38:24 UTC <emeddleton> @drawandstrike Oh!  Well I guess I can hope that the Real_Jeff will one day come out of hiding with the actions you have been tweeting about.
956990019004071936 2018-01-26 20:39:35 UTC <emeddleton> @MtnMD @cherokeesher2 @amazinmikey @LCNM99 @CitizensFedUp @co_rapunzel4 @realDonaldTrump @RestlessNews Thank you for reminding me of who  is part of the swamp.  There are still too many who need firing or pressured into doing the right thing.
954994339905785856 2018-01-21 08:29:28 UTC <emeddleton> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BarbAnn_PA @ErikMCarson That deal has never been given to him.  You do realize that the Senate has not passed any bill to extend spending.  What deal do you think the President broke?  Congress has not sent one to be signed.
954993602349838338 2018-01-21 08:26:32 UTC <emeddleton> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BarbAnn_PA @ErikMCarson You should try reading the bill instead of watching cable news.  You are very wrong.
954993081174040576 2018-01-21 08:24:28 UTC <emeddleton> @chuckschumer @realDonaldTrump @Namashary @rick_lebeau @sandra8301 @chadmom2 There was no immigration bill.  This was a spending bill to fund government operations and fund government programs.   Dems only care about getting more criminals that they can exploit. DACA will bring in more young kids for Dem sponsors to abuse.
953729760043024384 2018-01-17 20:44:28 UTC <emeddleton> Funny how CNN promotes violence.   Horrible people over there at CNN.https://twitter.com/StefanMolyneux/status/951888844881907717
953729098848743424 2018-01-17 20:41:51 UTC <emeddleton> @Comey How many do you have living in your house?  How much are you paying them out of your private bank account?  Don't try and use the power of the state to force others to do what you do not do and think you are somehow virtuous.
953721201460879360 2018-01-17 20:10:28 UTC <emeddleton> @realDonaldTrump The democrats only want a steady supply of young people that they can exploit.  Pretty much what they did as slave owners.  They want the same but say the are doing it out of compassion.
951863561164267520 2018-01-12 17:08:52 UTC <emeddleton> @realDonaldTrump @SenWarren Why are you selling out the dreams of American children?  It is funny how you always advocate for policies that give you access to undocumented young children that your doners can easily exploit.  Put American dreams first.
951044612201709568 2018-01-10 10:54:39 UTC <emeddleton> @RealJamesWoods The democrats party platform is based on bribery. Paying tax payers money and borrowing from future tax payers to pay to those who support them.
951043068517470208 2018-01-10 10:48:31 UTC <emeddleton> @RealJamesWoods This sounds like a judge that should be ignored.     The losers in San Francisco already ignore laws they don't like.  Why can't we ignore this judge?
935930440275312640 2017-11-29 17:56:20 UTC <emeddleton> @dandarling @Mepaynl Rand Paul is the only senator trying to fix America's problems.  Seems like people are upset that he isn't going along with all their corruption and want to silence him.
918079051901763584 2017-10-11 11:41:17 UTC <emeddleton> @realDonaldTrump @rodgarvin @impeach_d_trump @eugenegu I hope you really don't have a M.D..  What a scary thought.
904487423064719360 2017-09-03 23:33:00 UTC <emeddleton> @POTUS @RepTomRice It would be amazing if Congress could work as hard as the President at MAGA instead of vacationing or creating more anti- American laws.
904486341114683392 2017-09-03 23:28:42 UTC <emeddleton> @POTUS @RepTomRice To be clear, that was a jab at the congressman and not the President.
903993896316805120 2017-09-02 14:51:54 UTC <emeddleton> @POTUS @RepTomRice So stop whining about taxes and fix the system, that is your job.  Just stop borrowing money from children and the unborn.
857198924028723200 2017-04-26 11:45:24 UTC <emeddleton> @realDonaldTrump Can't you get your Fed prosecuters to go after these judges.  It seems judge is practicing the opposite of law and should be disbarred.
855179141326397440 2017-04-20 21:59:30 UTC <emeddleton> ISIS Touts Chemical Weapons Attacks, But Iraqis, US Play it Down http://bit.ly/2ovGw6J via @Militarydotcom  Who is using CW in Syria?  WTF
843217115549175808 2017-03-18 21:46:41 UTC <emeddleton> @BeauWillimon Is that what you call Obama's policy in Syria and Libya, "peace & stability".  You are sad.
831231428683714560 2017-02-13 19:59:50 UTC <emeddleton> @realDonaldTrump Great job, Mr. Miller.  You told it like it is and did not take any nonsense from the fake news hosts.
