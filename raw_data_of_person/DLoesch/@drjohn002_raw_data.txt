932339241643732992 2017-11-19 20:06:11 UTC <drjohn002> To depend on Gods nature of love, and ignore his other characteristics, is at best naive and at worst dangerous, and leads us inevitably to a position of cheap grace.  There is nothing cheap to our forgiveness. http://fl.vu/r8C2Epic.twitter.com/a6JnAR4B92

839675362854371328 2017-03-08 03:13:01 UTC <drjohn002> What does God want from us? To die. To surrender our lives to Him. Totally. No easy task,even on a good day!

818694735938207746 2017-01-09 05:43:30 UTC <drjohn002> My identity is Christ-not in my job or relationships or achievements or failures. My identity is who God says I am-he sees His Son in me.
816099568412553216 2017-01-02 01:51:14 UTC <drjohn002> Insight: my identity in Christ is no more than a reflection of how He sees me, not how I see myself.
