969921855611121664 2018-03-03 13:06:05 UTC <oldtownmac> @WarrenPlatts Right but do they put #tariffs on US #steel and #aluminum ? And how do they stack up with the administration's tariffs? Higher? Lower? About the same? I'm legitimately curious. I've literally not seen one reporter or TV presenter ask this question.
969918039931138048 2018-03-03 12:50:55 UTC <oldtownmac> I'm curious: Do Communist China or Mexico impose #tariffs on US #steel and #Aluminum? And if so, at what rate? I've yet to see a news story or TV segment that mentions this.

You can keep splitting hairs but funding the government passed the House and got 50 in the senate. The shutdown was a result of unified democrat obstructionism.

938519176737673216 2017-12-06 21:23:03 UTC <oldtownmac> @POTUS @SenTedCruz This is great news!  Now can we also recognize the reality that #Taiwan isn't part of #China and open one in #Taipei?
938518888299597824 2017-12-06 21:21:54 UTC <oldtownmac> So, now that we're moving our embassy in #Israel to reflect the reality that #Jerusalem is its capital (a good thing), can we also dispense with the fictional policy that regards #Taiwan as part of #China, and open one in #Taipei?

929027452550176768 2017-11-10 16:46:19 UTC <oldtownmac> Its odd that world leaders have to wear these costumes at #APEC meetings - like it's a Halloween party. The next time it's held in US, dress code should require participants to dress as Yosemite Sam, complete with a ten gallon cowboy hat, and chaps.

889881147286728704 2017-07-25 16:12:53 UTC <oldtownmac> Good legislation. But US should resume normal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. We have done so with backwards Cuba. Why not normal Taiwan?https://twitter.com/SenTomCotton/status/889540863931580423
889879883261902849 2017-07-25 16:07:51 UTC <oldtownmac> Good start. But resuming formal diplomatic relations would be better. Taiwan is a normal country. We should treat it like a normal country.https://twitter.com/taiwandefense/status/889558089162272773
