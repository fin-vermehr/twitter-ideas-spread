969206618943557632 2018-03-01 13:43:59 UTC <dandrews83> Sir, please do not support any bills that would make the purchase of an AR15 class unlawful Other proposed changes make sense. @realDonaldTrump
961743964322828288 2018-02-08 23:30:04 UTC <dandrews83> @SenMarkey I believe it would be best to keep the two important things separate.  Immigration is too important to not have its own bill and discussions.
954527742648864769 2018-01-19 01:35:22 UTC <dandrews83> @greta I have lost trust in those who classify information "for national security reasons".  Too easy to stamp it and then forget it.   Nearly impossible to overcome the classification later.
954348084267503616 2018-01-19 13:41:28 UTC <dandrews83> @OutFrontCNN @ErinBurnett @SenMarkey Dreamer issues should be dealt with separately
954347683199807488 2018-01-19 13:39:53 UTC <dandrews83> Please support the House passed spending bill.  Other issues can be dealt with later and separately@SenMarkey
950720617518682112 2018-01-09 13:27:13 UTC <dandrews83> @greta You have not changed Greta, the way news is delivered has changed.  Speaking as a 70+ yr old person.

949738477968601090 2018-01-06 20:24:33 UTC <dandrews83> @greta @KCobb8876 I joined the military and learned computers.  Became my civilian working career for my entire working life. Best training anywhere.
947497892327120897 2017-12-31 16:01:15 UTC <dandrews83> @IvankaTrump @EdKrassen @grandmabarbiep1 So are you saying in absolute dollars or percentage paid in
940368521393004546 2017-12-11 23:51:41 UTC <dandrews83> @Mediaite Are you kidding.  She was in complete control
926594150685921281 2017-11-03 23:37:15 UTC <dandrews83> @greta If I were to see him on the street I would stop and turn my back to him.  Disgraceful decision.  Speaking as a Vet

880518977583271936 2017-06-29 20:10:58 UTC <dandrews83> @SenatorCollins Senator, 3 branches of government and media probably don't belong in the same sentence.
