826107714560544769 2017-01-30 16:40:02 UTC <kyleblasdel> @KansasDems @BryanLowry3 True.  I object to the phrasing and you got caught in the cross-hairs!  Phrasing is definitely untrue!
826105349413433344 2017-01-30 16:30:38 UTC <kyleblasdel> Come on @BryanLowry3 and @kansasdotcom it wasn't a Muslim Ban!  Quit spreading #fakenews . Regardless how u feel about EO don't lie abt it!https://twitter.com/BryanLowry3/status/826102402126344193
825805604555988992 2017-01-29 20:39:33 UTC <kyleblasdel> @vgregorian very true.  Not always my strong suit but working on it!  Thanks for the response!
825773696006680577 2017-01-29 18:32:45 UTC <kyleblasdel> @abzeronow The EO made exceptions, on case by case basis, for approval during 120 day temp ban.  So, yes.
825771288249630720 2017-01-29 18:23:11 UTC <kyleblasdel> @vgregorian I really enjoy ur commentary but do disagree on some things. Everyone acting like we banned all immigration on Friday. Not true.
825770799734915073 2017-01-29 18:21:15 UTC <kyleblasdel> if that's ur basis the ur probably right.  Obviously I was talking terrorism.  Fair enough.
825769844264034306 2017-01-29 18:17:27 UTC <kyleblasdel> @vgregorian @KJH05 I'll respond.  I also have a life and don't sit on Twitter all day.  Gotta get work done!
825769606228955139 2017-01-29 18:16:30 UTC <kyleblasdel> so fundamentally false.
825769218499084293 2017-01-29 18:14:58 UTC <kyleblasdel> @vgregorian Yes.  Of course! There was a temp ban on immigration from 7 countries with strong ties to terrorism.  What did I miss?
825768896674353156 2017-01-29 18:13:41 UTC <kyleblasdel> @vgregorian @TravisBarbarick read the executive order.  Doesn't even contain the word Muslim!
825768722933678080 2017-01-29 18:13:00 UTC <kyleblasdel> @Google @DanielPink @cocosandchamps actually, it excludes countries with strong military ties
825727271600287744 2017-01-29 15:28:17 UTC <kyleblasdel> Great article that clears up the mass hysteria about the immigration EO.  @vgregorian should read it before he tweets more #newshysteria https://twitter.com/JesseKellyDC/status/825711981256646657
825724921233997824 2017-01-29 15:18:57 UTC <kyleblasdel> @DanielPink @Google  That's great.  Could still do it today.  Ban only included 7 countries.
825554004814000129 2017-01-28 03:59:47 UTC <kyleblasdel> @The_Oddsmaker just a RT with an agenda, huh?  Pence can support recent action and still stand by tweet.  Not mutually exclusive ideas.
825551169145733121 2017-01-28 03:48:31 UTC <kyleblasdel> @The_Oddsmaker  still not a Muslim ban.  Don't proliferate #fakenews
