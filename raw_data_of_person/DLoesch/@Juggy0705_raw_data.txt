When districts are redrawn, it will be my pleasure to vote you out of your comfy seat.
969198687766372353 2018-03-01 13:12:28 UTC <Juggy0705> @RepDaveJoyce I find it telling how many times you tout your relationship with schools in your district, and yet, not one mention of school safety, gun safety legislation or even an acknowledgment of the recent shooting in FL.  1/2

They survived a horrific assault; They've earned the right to express whatever opinions they like regarding their experience. You should be ashamed.
965227991918882817 2018-02-18 14:14:20 UTC <Juggy0705> It is disgusting and immoral that Congress would rather protect their seats than protect defenseless children attending school. Your job is not worth one single child's life. Not one.

963938985310654464 2018-02-14 00:52:17 UTC <Juggy0705> @senrobportman In 2016, the NRA spent 2.3 million to help you keep your job. After you and your wife finish praying, pat yourself on the back, Rob. Tragedies like today's are just part of your pay day.

959229018598969349 2018-02-01 00:56:34 UTC <Juggy0705> @seanhannity Your reading comprehension must be a bit lacking. This article only outlines the GOP case; It makes no assertions about corroberating evidence or even the validity of the Nunes memo itself. Why the celebrating?
957964628646121472 2018-01-29 13:12:20 UTC <Juggy0705> @DonCheadle You handled her with class. Per usual.
957961877526581249 2018-01-29 13:01:24 UTC <Juggy0705> @DonCheadle @kitkat1155 His own tweets degrade and diminish the dignity of the office nearly every day. That's enough for me, and others, to consider him a repugnant human being and unfit for the presidency. If that isn't enough for you, it's your choice. But why demean an actor for his views? Grow up.
