966286833373077507 2018-02-21 12:21:48 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @ScottPresler 100/ this is discrimination. This comes across as- Twitter doesn't want Conservatives/R spreading our message. Why?
962715333428686852 2018-02-11 15:49:56 UTC <LadyKKimberly> THANK YOU @realDonaldTrump,   for giving #WeThePeople real HOPE & CHANGE!   P.S.-  when you are done spanking Dems & sending EVIL back to Hell, could you do another VICTORY tour?  #MAGA
962123504824045568 2018-02-09 00:38:13 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @drawandstrike Thank you for the reality check.   I am guilty of automatically jumping to the most negative explanation.

959542164421337091 2018-02-02 21:40:54 UTC <LadyKKimberly> If there is so much OTHER evidence for FISA Warrants, WHY did they have to use Steele's BS dossier?
959521095618580480 2018-02-02 20:17:10 UTC <LadyKKimberly> Everything that they (Obama/HRC/FBI/so many more) did, would have happened to WHOMEVER was REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.
959517970249736192 2018-02-02 20:04:45 UTC <LadyKKimberly> Once Hillary lost Nov 2016- this CRAP falls on OBAMA! He took strings over as PUPPET MASTER
959156538643447808 2018-02-01 20:08:33 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @seanhannity @76SilenceDogood Coincidence MEMO is close to coming out and now we hear Mueller delays Flynn sentencing AND closing in on some cover up of Don Jr meeting Russian lawyer?

959109191318364161 2018-02-01 17:00:25 UTC <LadyKKimberly> There's hundreds of thousands of US Military that would like peace of mind you'll stop using THEIR paychecks as pawns in your Anti-American games.  There's hundreds of thousands of US Citizens that would like peace of mind that Dems actually care about Americans.https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/958887129060462593
959104613210382336 2018-02-01 16:42:13 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @sundnce99 I 100% believe it's bc Dems saw how much they're losing Black& minority voters. Dems see illegals/refugees/Soros fraud machines as there last and only hope of trying to keep any semblance of power.
959103718825385984 2018-02-01 16:38:40 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @ScottPresler DEEP STATE is going to try anything and everything to destroy the GOOD GUYS & GALS helping President Trump. REAL COURAGE is what Nunes & others exhibit every day as they fight & DRAIN SWAMP

958531417104928769 2018-01-30 02:44:33 UTC <LadyKKimberly> Every time Paul Ryan grins- I giggle Every time he says something to VP Pence- I wonder if it's "Yep, that Dem won't be re-elected...Yep, our majority is getting bigger and bigger...."
958344464258486274 2018-01-30 14:21:40 UTC <LadyKKimberly> I wonder if Kleenex will send Dems some free boxes of tissues for SOTU with some of their Tax Cut money?
958343839504306176 2018-01-30 14:19:11 UTC <LadyKKimberly> Looks like our "stable-genius" President just being in office is proving what unstable-morons the out-of-touch Dems are
958339389062565888 2018-01-30 14:01:30 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @sundnce99 I can't think of anyone in Obama's Anti-American Admin that DIDN'T/HASN'T lied.
958330793906135040 2018-01-30 13:27:20 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @themadstone @nikkikessler @EdiSahaghian Sir, you do not speak for me. Nor do you actually know what I consider or think. You just want to bash President Trump/his supporters/anyone NOT a Dem.  I wonder what our country would look like if you guys actually cared about ALL people.

957349234180796417 2018-01-27 20:26:58 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @NancyPelosi @trumpology Also shows why & how she's so out of touch with middle America
956604543105687552 2018-01-25 19:07:50 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @POTUS @IsraeliPM Exactly how is President Trump destroying America?
956543389914353665 2018-01-25 15:04:50 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @IndeCardio @larryelder Obama gave #$40 and Pelosi acted like it was a gift from God. Trump lowers withholding/taxes spurring businesses to share & spread their benefits of their tax cuts and Pelosi calls $1000 bonus "crumbs". MAGA
956318992867692544 2018-01-24 00:13:10 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @IndeCardio @RealMattCouch IF there was another "glitch", SOMEONE CAUSED THAT "glitch" and did it to ALL the others in their "secret society" to cover there asses!

956232669465137154 2018-01-24 18:30:09 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @seanhannity If players knelt to protest 1st Anti-American President Obama, the Left would step up their physical & personal attacks and their open racism towards Repubs.
956230937536286720 2018-01-24 18:23:16 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @seanhannity @DaveinDiego EVERY NFL player that knelt is responsible for THEIR actions, Fox nor President Trump made them do it. They chose to kneel, they chose to show their true colors to our Military/Vets/NFL fans.
955914216350810112 2018-01-23 21:24:43 UTC <LadyKKimberly> I wish they would get them released sooner so POTUS could read Memo at SOTUhttps://twitter.com/mitchellvii/status/955906251002654721

955235493867909121 2018-01-21 00:27:43 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @dbongino Tell Dems there's info of Trump picking his nose and they'd be all over it. Actual corruption/abuse of powers/treasonous & horrid crimes, they run like MEMO is truth serum.
955234688196636672 2018-01-21 00:24:31 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @dbongino @msjrwidow Because he had already put his accomplices in place to avoid pesky oversight. I thought he had ability to UNITE races, nope, he's THE worst, ANTI-AMERICAN POTUS...ever.
955228070163689473 2018-01-21 23:58:13 UTC <LadyKKimberly> MAGA but new Dem party that can stand on their own INDIVIDUALLY, not cower to party leader, get back to civility, no more games, would be great for all Americanshttps://twitter.com/KathrynFebbrar1/status/954898786555396097
954781078224556032 2018-01-20 18:22:02 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @realDonaldTrump @ScottPresler I wish he would, but I don't think he will. The next investigation would be for more obstruction of justice charges, abuse of power, or some horrid-world-ending accusation.Hopefully, the House will release it on their own very soon.

950763140144345093 2018-01-09 16:16:11 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @ScottPresler @babushka_k 100% true & agree. After the most ANTI-USA POTUS ever, it's refreshing to have a man who actually gives a damn/wants to help/actually is helping middle America.
950719801399414784 2018-01-09 13:23:58 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @ScottPresler @JamesKennethBo2 LOL! You are an angry person that belittles others to feel big. But,  Jesus still loves you!
950423428829499402 2018-01-08 17:46:18 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @ScottPresler @JamesKennethBo2 Eric Holder, genius. IDK nor do I care how many men/women or their ethnicity, in any Admin. Whomever is in cabinet should have skill set for their position, that's it. We are all humans, color means nothing to most of us. It's what's in someone's heart that matters.
950421007227113477 2018-01-08 17:36:40 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @ScottPresler @JamesKennethBo2 That is ignorant.1 has nothing to do w the other. So, if there's not a certain # of blacks in cabinet then we don't actually care about black ppl/community? THAT way of thinking hurts race relations, not us.
943837787010273280 2017-12-21 13:37:18 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @mitchellvii Well, in all fairness, Obama was a community organizer not a successful businessman. Thankfully, we have Trump to #MAGA
943824385139527680 2017-12-21 12:44:03 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @ScottPresler @JamesKennethBo2 Obama had 1 black Cabinet Member in his first year...

874679262644711425 2017-06-13 17:26:01 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @dbongino @foxandfriends Dems tryin to do what Trump did but can't. It's not the swearing, it's the passion behind being fed up w/ swamp & wanting to help ALL USA.
874308879747866624 2017-06-12 16:54:15 UTC <LadyKKimberly> First Lady Melania Trump brings grace, class, and genuine pride for America back to the Whitehouse! A breath of fresh air after 8yrs! MAGA

864576156334469120 2017-05-16 20:19:53 UTC <LadyKKimberly> POTUS is only interested in HELPING us yet MSM/LEFT is doing anything they can to hurt him/us. Who's THE silent majority going to believe?
864574109421842432 2017-05-16 20:11:45 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @GriffJenkins @foxandfriends Seth was contacting WikiLeaks w/ DNC emails NOT Russia-THAT'S news & changes ALOT w/ MSM & Leftnuts BS stories...
863745333104451584 2017-05-14 13:18:29 UTC <LadyKKimberly> We elected Trump to DRAIN SWAMP but didnt elect enough help, he needs a few more Repub seats in '18 to rid OBSTRUCTIONIST Dems.
863738967614771200 2017-05-14 12:53:12 UTC <LadyKKimberly> Maybe needed, esp in helping drain swamp, but changing way WH does Press Briefings won't stop the MSM peddling conspiracy theories as news.
857921188886192128 2017-04-28 11:35:25 UTC <LadyKKimberly> @BerkeleyCRs @foxandfriends I thought we DIDN'T negotiate w/ terrorists...the left is terrorizing people into shutting down repubs free speech. Wrong.
