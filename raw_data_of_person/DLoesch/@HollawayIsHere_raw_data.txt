971156781148917766 2018-03-06 22:53:14 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @DLoesch China doesn't have constitutional rights. They regulate everything, no thanks, we'll keep our guns
971126964189908993 2018-03-06 20:54:45 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @jimmykimmel Lmao your opinions vs Trumps fact? Nice try at a snappy comeback but you failed. Again....
971112800297811968 2018-03-06 19:58:28 UTC <HollawayIsHere> Watched The Walking Dead last night and just didn't seem the same without @chandlerriggs in it. #WeNeedCarl
971104711259643904 2018-03-06 19:26:20 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @Alyssa_Milano Love how everyone threatens Amazon, "do this or else". Bet they're the same ones that speak up against bullying lmao don't worry @amazon we NRA supporters will continue to support you.
971104128888750080 2018-03-06 19:24:01 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @amazon @Alyssa_Milano And just like that, a woman I've had a crush on since we were kids, I am no longer a fan of. Smh tired of celebrities using their fame to try to control everybody.
971103603204247558 2018-03-06 19:21:55 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @amazon @Alyssa_Milano @34Olgita That's awesome! Go Amazon!
971101290251145216 2018-03-06 19:12:44 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @DLoesch @amazon @Cindy71 @Alyssa_Milano @JeanasJewels @CrazyScaryWorld I love how "you don't share the same beliefs" = racist now days! Wtf?!?! The word racist has lost its meaning and shouldn't be used anymore. Before you know it, people will be calling other racist because they drive a Honda instead of a Subaru
971090647938629632 2018-03-06 18:30:27 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @Rosie @JesseFFerguson @rckuss @MrGournalist No anti Trump people are the ridiculous ones. You ever take a breath and actually read some of the dumb shit that comes out of the mouths of folks that hate Trump? It's like being in a daycare and they're out of crayons
971090156181753857 2018-03-06 18:28:29 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @Rosie @JesseFFerguson @MrGournalist Ahahahahaha! Good one butternuts! Guessin you're not from the south? Thats ok man, Nobody's perfect. Still gonna be a long 7 years for Y'ALL.
971081318481256449 2018-03-06 17:53:22 UTC <HollawayIsHere> Is @RealJamesWoods the only actor in the U.S. that has any sense and gets it? So far I think so. Thank you James for not being fake and for not trying to stay silent to keep from offending anybody. You sir, are a class act and I grow to be a bigger fan of yours every day!
971067276127559689 2018-03-06 16:57:34 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @Rosie @JesseFFerguson @hccpal You think half the country is bigoted, narrow minded and vindictive?  Have you really thought about that?  The millions of folks that would be?
971066895356059648 2018-03-06 16:56:04 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @Rosie @JesseFFerguson @hccpal And not to be THAT guy,  but I think it's "you're" right.
971066691164758016 2018-03-06 16:55:15 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @Rosie @JesseFFerguson @hccpal Lmfao! Yeah ok. Says the people throwing fits and name calling like a bunch of jr high school girls.  Gonna be a long 7 more years, might wanna find a comfortable happy place.
971047910182965254 2018-03-06 15:40:37 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @Rosie @JesseFFerguson Y'all mad Trump won and lookin for ANY reason y'all can find why Hillary lost. Ima help ya so y'all can stop being so stressed about it...  WE THE PEOPLE VOTED FOR TRUMP! THAT is why Hillary lost. Not because of Russia. The simple truth is that hard to accept?
971047295721574401 2018-03-06 15:38:11 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @Rosie @JesseFFerguson How exactly did they do that? I can't find ONE person that voted for Trump that was contacted by any Russians. Can't find ONE that was forced not to vote for Hillary. News Flash, Hillary lost because America is tired of the corruption that we have watched for YEARS.
971013845421522944 2018-03-06 13:25:15 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @DLoesch They're just mad because you have a different opinion. They're like children. Sense of entitlement,  spoiled,  no discipline,  throwing a fit of they don't get their way,  etc.... it's really pathetic the way they act if you don't do what they say
971007197915303936 2018-03-06 12:58:51 UTC <HollawayIsHere> How come "you're a peach" is a compliment but "you're bananas" is an insult? Why are we allowing fruit discrimination to tear society apart?
970875228527177728 2018-03-05 04:14:27 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @DiamondandSilk @DonaldFrump It wasn't started for blacks,  but it did arm and train "black guards" to defend themselves from the KKK so played a huge role in helping black people survive.
970851312651964417 2018-03-05 02:39:25 UTC <HollawayIsHere> I'd rather walk naked into a colony of bees than to watch @jimmykimmel hosting anything and try to be funny. Guy is garbage now days since he's obsessed with Trump, the man a LOT of people voted for to run this place. A lot that USED to watch his show. #TheOscars #KimmelIsTrash
970849676101636101 2018-03-05 02:32:54 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @carrieksada @LeahR77 I'm sure that has a lot to do with it.  Could also include that all he does is talk about trump CONSTANTLY! He's freakin obsessed with Trump. Dude doesn't realize that a LOT of America voted for the guy he's bashing 24/7 and ain't gonna watch him spew garbage about him
970781148422033410 2018-03-05 22:00:36 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @Spacebunnyday Just don't smack em on the butt when they walk in

970763181260984320 2018-03-05 20:49:12 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @TomiLahren @KMacMusic That comment was dumb. I really thought maybe you were slow and was trying to say something else. Carry on.
970759627083341824 2018-03-05 20:35:05 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @DLoesch @SouthernKeeks Amen! Guy is lucky we witnessed this while he was being tough behind his quarty Keyboard attacking a woman and not in person. I can't stand a guy that treats a woman like that and would feed that dude his freakin teeth if he said it in arms reach.

970723303290802176 2018-03-05 18:10:45 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @surlytart All these butthurt liberals. I think its hilarious the way they speak against people who bully and all the bad folks who are out of control and then THEY are the ones that act like kids. Don't listen to em @DLoesch , they aren't even on your level
970715160284467203 2018-03-05 17:38:23 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @CNN @ochocinco CJ throwin out the ole transgender card to try to get on that island. Lol I'm lesbian if it gets me there!

970700267313393665 2018-03-05 16:39:13 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @MieshaTate Miesha is by far my most favorite female fighter EVER! Gorgeous AND can fight? Woohoo! Don't get any better than that. You have any plans for the next 30 years or so?? :) lol
970663178022604800 2018-03-05 14:11:50 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump @thebradfordfile I agree 100% BUT think if he bans ANY guns, he won't win in 2020. Just from what I've seen people say. He would lose a LOT of support. As long as he does what the people elected him to do and that's #MAGA and protect our rights he'll be here for 7 more years
970493993535574016 2018-03-04 02:59:33 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RepMaxineWaters Is this what you think goes on? You may really want to see a psychiatrist. Not a psychologist, you're gonna need drugs.
970304993524879361 2018-03-04 14:28:32 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RepMaxineWaters Has your mental state been observed?
970286947305492480 2018-03-04 13:16:49 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @Spacebunnyday And this is why massacres will continue. They want to medicate 1 in 5 kids for this, 1 in 5 for bipolar, etc. 1 in 5 are basically not on some kind of medication for a "mental" issue.
970285067586162688 2018-03-04 13:09:21 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RealJamesWoods Kimmel is a freakin JOKE! He's done nothing but try to get trumps attention from day one. I KNEW Trump was gonna be talked about especially since Kimmel was hosting. I didn't even watch it. At all.
970123987526275072 2018-03-03 02:29:17 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @MieshaTate Where I stand?  I stand loving me some Miesha!

970122228615524352 2018-03-03 02:22:17 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @LaliBull @realToroCoffee This may be the dumbest shit I've seen all day. Guns kill people even though someone else is pulling the trigger? Smh how many tide pods have you had today?
970030524457766917 2018-03-03 20:17:53 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @DLoesch don't listen to that @LRBitisnot douchenozzle. A real man don't bully women. Dudes nothing but a punk
969973293745876992 2018-03-03 16:30:29 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump Need to introduce a bill that requires everyone to stand for the national anthem. Asap! They don't care about our 2nd amendment when it comes to our weapon of choice, then we don't care about their first when it comes to the Anthem. #BanKneelingForTheAnthem
969972484769550337 2018-03-03 16:27:16 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump I see all this whining about the first amendment. Sorry if you don't support the 2nd amendment then your 1st amendment is subject to change also. We don't pick which ones we want to support and which ones we don't. We need to modify the 1st amendment for the Anthem #MakeEmStand
969927310681001984 2018-03-03 13:27:45 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @Spacebunnyday @PolitiBunny You got a tramp stamp that says "Lucky You" too huh?

969776737839144960 2018-03-02 03:29:26 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @bull50 Well then y'all are both idiots. 2nd amendment says "people" and "arms" and that's what it meant.
969767760132739072 2018-03-02 02:53:46 UTC <HollawayIsHere> Read through the #AssaultWeaponsBan H.R. 5087 and I don't think so! This is NOT a ban of just "assault weapons" as they like to call it but a ban of pretty much every semi auto gun from rifles, to pistols, and shotguns. Y'all need to wake up and let these folks know This is SHIT!

969737749136732160 2018-03-02 00:54:30 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @tombrokaw Did you think fixin this mess was gonna be easy? Just sit back and let the man work. Wouldn't be chaotic if y'all would shut up and let the guy work. Y'all spend so much time lookin for the bad that y'all miss ALL the good. Have a seat.

969731714208722944 2018-03-02 00:30:32 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump Whys china mad? Most of the big companies won't buy steel from them cause its garbage. Very cheap and you get what you pay for.

969435160746881024 2018-03-01 04:52:08 UTC <HollawayIsHere> #JimmyKimmel sounds pathetic. Does he talk about anything other than Trump? Dude he isn't listening and doesn't care, get some new material. He obviously isn't phased by you if he hasn't acknowledged you. You're like that annoying ex that won't stop trying.
969242084417916929 2018-03-01 16:04:55 UTC <HollawayIsHere> Saying I have a drinking problem is like saying Bruce Lee had a kung fu problem, it's not a problem if you're good at it.
969241725435875328 2018-03-01 16:03:29 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @TheGreatest__2 It did say it was overflowing on my statement!  Or did it say overdrafting? Can't remember which but gotta be good with the word "over" in it
969233911694884865 2018-03-01 15:32:26 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @TheGreatest__2 Lol me too! Not sure what that little negative sign was for or why it's red but I'm guessin cause there's so much in there

969043541887520768 2018-02-28 02:55:59 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump @paulalenbeck @redneckin357 @DianeB528 Nobody is arguing over fully auto weapons.
969042698765258752 2018-02-28 02:52:37 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump Clinton wanted to do away with guns. So we made sure YOU won because you said you were for the people. If you ban these you don't hurt anybody but those of us that follow the law, criminals still get em. Do what we were trying to prevent and you'll lose 3/4 of your supporters
969037506338582529 2018-02-28 02:32:00 UTC <HollawayIsHere> If @realDonaldTrump bans ARs, he won't need the new campaign manager he named for 2020. His voters that put him in the White House are looking to him to protect their rights, take em away and that'll be it.
969003337592033281 2018-02-28 00:16:13 UTC <HollawayIsHere> Everybody all excited that #Dicks took "a stand" for the greater good. Y'all do know after Sandy Hook they did this same exact thing right? Why they selling them again if they took that stand before? lmao! Keep believing the hype, this is all about publicity! #Haha
968996209489776640 2018-02-28 23:47:54 UTC <HollawayIsHere> To all the sporting goods stores that see what that other one is doing about banning selling ARs....... "Don't be Dicks"

968510773046796288 2018-02-27 15:38:57 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump @mathewgillisha1 As a matter if fact they did. Giardoni. Try a little research. Was magazine fed and all. Nice try though. They didn't have internet though so please excersize your free speech via telegraph from now on. Or a quill pen and parchment paper. Thanks.
968509884600864768 2018-02-27 15:35:25 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump Regarding the "Assault Weapon Ban" the Democrats introduced.. "during and before the assault weapons ban when six+ people were shot and killed.  1984 to 1994: 19 incidents  1994 to 2004 (ban is in effect): 12 incidents 12 incidents during ban?

968509381016018949 2018-02-27 15:33:25 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Dems are too busy tryin to ban our guns. #NoARBans heard they introduced a bill to ban after all the "we aren't trying to take your guns BS"  "shall not be infringed upon" has lost its meaning?

968224854636888064 2018-02-26 20:42:48 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RealJamesWoods There was a video of 4 officers on side of a building throwing something on the ground and puttin something in a truck taken by a news helicopter live. Haven't seen it since then. It was DEFINITELY weird though
967970812060979201 2018-02-25 03:53:20 UTC <HollawayIsHere> Thanks a lot #NRA thanks to you Carl is gone. He was too young to have a gun. And #DACA protecting these damn zombies out here biting people  #carl #WalkingDead :'( #ChandlerRiggs
967962405631418368 2018-02-25 03:19:56 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @chandlerriggs Nooooooo don't go Carl!
967920952146321409 2018-02-25 00:35:12 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @abc13houston @robert_kolbe Ummm there isn't hardly anybody in the US that has a machine gun sir. Nor an automatic weapon. Have you been to the liquor store tonight? Sounds like it. Put the bottle up
967920266511831041 2018-02-25 00:32:29 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @abc13houston @KamanHung The guy was robbing a fkn liquor store. Your argument is invalid. Sure he was doin it just to better himself cause he was poor? Tfoh lmao drinkin isn't a necessity, if you can't afford it, don't drink.
967918358501969920 2018-02-25 00:24:54 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @davidhogg111 I support it 100% the NRA isn't goin anywhere. They've always been someones scape goat. Don't you have to get your makeup done for another interview?  Oh I noticed in 2 interviews you said you was in 2 different classes during all this. Must be from being so distraught right?
967908395079667719 2018-02-25 23:45:18 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump When y'all quote Trump you leave out key words to make it sound like something it isn't. If Trump leaves out words it's the end if the world. Lmao #hypocrites
967907938735218688 2018-02-25 23:43:30 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Funny that liberals will say something about Trump picking words from a quote when they've done it to just about EVERYTHING Trump has said since he announced he was running lmao I KNOW y'all ain't talkin crap about someone doin that! #WhatsGoodForTheGoose
967880104226492420 2018-02-25 21:52:53 UTC <HollawayIsHere> Anti gun Liberals - "Quit thinking we want to take your guns! Y'all always think that and NOT what we want"  Gun Lovin Americans- "Quit using the word "ban" in front of certain guns if that's not what you're tryin to do"
967861170660048901 2018-02-25 20:37:39 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @CoachHollod @UmphLaura Constitution says "arms" meaning exactly that. There were no limits to what arms you could have. It was made for a tyrannical government or foreign enemies so that ppl could defend themselves. It was meant for ppl to have the same type of weaponry as their enemies.
967860013279653889 2018-02-25 20:33:03 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @CoachHollod @RealBobReynolds @persistresist73 No completely true. It was voted down by Congress. You can't call every person with a mental disability on SS violent and tell them they can't own a firearm due to a few mentally disturbed individuals. The ACLU was also against it. Not to mention it was never implemented.
967859203409874949 2018-02-25 20:29:50 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @CoachHollod I'm ok raising the age to 21. Because 2 be honest, these 18 year olds aren't like we were. How we acted and looked at things at 18, these days don't get noticed till they're 23 or older. We have a generation problem, the guns are the same as they have always been.
967858143383425024 2018-02-25 20:25:37 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SamuelLJackson @NicoleMAGA72FL @Nakilla Not all teachers will be good for it, it should be up to the teachers if they want to. If you force a teacher to do it it won't work but if one WANTS to then there's a chance of it working. Even if it saves ONE life, it's worth it.
967857696996196353 2018-02-25 20:23:51 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SamuelLJackson @NicoleMAGA72FL @BurleighQld And all pistols are lethal if you shoot someone with it in the right place. Just like rifles.
967857543128199168 2018-02-25 20:23:14 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SamuelLJackson @NicoleMAGA72FL @BurleighQld Virginia tech killer killed more people with 2 pistols than ANY school shooter with an AR.  Howd he do that? Cause listening to anti gun folks it's impossible
967855713203744768 2018-02-25 20:15:58 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SamuelLJackson @NicoleMAGA72FL @Nakilla If they don't then the outcome is the same as it would be with no guns or training. Nobody can say it won't work because it hasn't been proven that it won't. What HAS been proven is that no armed teachers or staff 100% doesn't work.
967855431136706560 2018-02-25 20:14:51 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SamuelLJackson @NicoleMAGA72FL @Nakilla I train constantly but during actual events it's always different. But training DOES work. The way I see it, yes everybody reacts different, BUT is it a chance that can save the lives of many? Someone may freeze up yes, if they don't and they DO stop the person ut was worth it
967854565738602497 2018-02-25 20:11:24 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SamuelLJackson @NicoleMAGA72FL @Nakilla Trust me I know whatcha mean
967854196329414663 2018-02-25 20:09:56 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SamuelLJackson @NicoleMAGA72FL @Nakilla Every School is different so all depends how the school is set up. But it can be done. Just gotta look for more solutions than banning guns cause that's not gonna change a damn thing
967853747132125184 2018-02-25 20:08:09 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SamuelLJackson @NicoleMAGA72FL @Nakilla There's other stuff that would need to be done also but my point is yoy develop a plan to keep it from happening
967853544605999104 2018-02-25 20:07:21 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SamuelLJackson @NicoleMAGA72FL @Nakilla You develop a plan. Every teacher has a panic button or something that's pushed to let every body know there's a shooter. Everybody stays in the classroom until all clear given by police. Kids Hunker down in a corner with the teacher not in first line of sight if shooter gets in.

Yet he can bash anybody he wants. Double standards of the libs. There's a few that haven't grieved since this started. It's been all about the spotlight
967806081601867776 2018-02-25 16:58:45 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SamuelLJackson @NicoleMAGA72FL @Nakilla I'm almost sure there woukd be a protocol to prevent this. I doubt they're just gonna pass out guns and say "good luck"
967805822620270592 2018-02-25 16:57:43 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SamuelLJackson @NicoleMAGA72FL @BurleighQld Most pistols are lethal semi automatics also

That's cause from people not working. don't try throwing unemployment numbers out, those are only for people receiving benefits. Doesn't count the ones that benefits  expired
967596351960829952 2018-02-24 03:05:22 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RepBrianMast @BillOrazi @kristim23 @kimmeld8 I agree. I dont live there luckily

And I'll be doin it with my ARs,  AKs or whatever else I feel I need to get the job done. They don't want to protect us but want us to be limited in how we do it
967590896979136522 2018-02-24 02:43:41 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RepBrianMast @BillOrazi @kristim23 @kimmeld8 Oh my bad. I had just said something about the 4 officers not going in so thought it was to me. My apologies. And I agree. He started off one way then folks started throwin the word vote out there and he switched sides it looks like.
967577926253383681 2018-02-24 01:52:09 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @Sen_JoeManchin @realDonaldTrump @SenToomey @dbarber Oh I know. My weapon of choice is the AR just because it's one of those rights things and that's the one I want for whatever protection I may or may not need.
967546733784981505 2018-02-24 23:48:12 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein @RealMcCoy2008 @JustABuehler I think banning ANYTHING is just their way of avoiding the fact that this country has a serious mental health issue. It's like when we were kids we were taught not to run with scissors. Now days they would just ban scissors so they don't have to teach kids right from wrong.
967529229658271747 2018-02-24 22:38:38 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein @RealMcCoy2008 @JustABuehler Eh I like the 30 round mags. For several reasons so I'm against that part also.

967528579096555520 2018-02-24 22:36:03 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RepBrianMast @BillOrazi @kristim23 @kimmeld8 I'm not pushing any agenda. Why were they told to stand down? coaches and teachers were runnin in and throwin themselves in front of students with no body armor or firearms? By their Hillary supporting commanding officer. I did tweet the truth. I'm all for ex mil to be in schools
967521645333184513 2018-02-24 22:08:30 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @Sen_JoeManchin @realDonaldTrump @SenToomey @dbarber The FBI failed to prevent this. the Coward County deputies WAITED OUTSIDE! 4 of them WHILE it was happening BUT this is the NRAs fault? guns fault? presidents fault? Gtfoh. We can't rely on LE to protect us so we aren't givin up our ability to protect ourselves. Not happening.
967515862495367168 2018-02-24 21:45:31 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump @mathewgillisha1 @RedDawn329 This is incorrect. 2nd amendment says "arms" there is no limit to what we can and can't have.
967515398122934273 2018-02-24 21:43:41 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump @mathewgillisha1 Did they have internet and tablets? No. Therefore if you wish to carry on your first amendment right to talk about this, please do so with a quill pen and parchment paper or do so via telegram. Thanks.
967514518040514560 2018-02-24 21:40:11 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @mburmeister @dbarber Ummm the Virginia tech shooter killed more people with 2 pistols than ANY school shooting with an AR and one was a glock. The other was a 10 round magazined .22
967514267950788608 2018-02-24 21:39:11 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @Sen_JoeManchin @realDonaldTrump @SenToomey @covermeincamo @dbarber No semi auto weapons? You do realize most guns out there are semi auto right? Pistols, etc.  We all need revolvers? 6 shooters? While all enemies have ARs and bad guys here in our backyards? Seems legit
967291436948426752 2018-02-23 06:53:44 UTC <HollawayIsHere> Rap died a long time ago. These artist nowdays destroyed it and now it's all hip hop. There's not much heart in it anymore. To hear a song someone put their heart in and you can TELL it, just feels good to listen to. @13isGodsend put it down on all the songs I listened to
967284092344598529 2018-02-23 06:24:33 UTC <HollawayIsHere> Checked out I Cry by @13isGodsend good song brother. I miss rap with a story or message.  Good to hear a real song for a change. Keep up the good music bro and thank you for your service
967263310964981761 2018-02-23 05:01:58 UTC <HollawayIsHere> If the 2nd amendment was meant for only muskets, and not modern weapons then please limit your first amendment right in protesting to a quill pen and parchment paper or if you prefer, send someone a telegraph. Tablets, computers, cell phones and social media weren't around then.
967261612112535552 2018-02-23 04:55:13 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RepBrianMast Went from knowing where the blame lies to lettin these folks bully you into their way of thinking by tellin you they ain't gonna vote for you if you don't do this or that. You know damn well it's not an AR issue. Thank you for your service but don't throw that away by selling out
967260685594918912 2018-02-23 04:51:32 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RepBrianMast @to_consider Yes!!! 4 officers outside stood by why someone slaughtered kids. The same someone that the FBI was warned about NUMEROUS times that did nothing. Would almost seem they wanted it to happen so they could push their agenda in disarming Americans.
967259430810193921 2018-02-23 04:46:33 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RepBrianMast @DianaMiller5 @J_Wade_Miller @ferncohen3 Ummm yeah. The bad guys have them. The 2nd amendment was designed so that we can protect ourselves from our enemies correct? Both foreign AND domestic! If the time should arise, how do we protect ourselves from the bad people who have the guns we can't? O
967257697514123265 2018-02-23 04:39:40 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RepBrianMast @BillOrazi @kristim23 There were 4 police officers there that did nothing. Plus the FBI didn't do anything to prevent this when they had a chance. The ones responsible for this are sittin back while everyone attacks the people that WERENT!
967254944091987969 2018-02-23 04:28:44 UTC <HollawayIsHere> Are we still blaming the NRA and Trump for Parkland?  Haven't heard many folks mad at the FBI that didnt prevent it or the 4 Parkland police that stood outside while kids were being murdered. Leave it to the libs to blame everyone they don't like instead of the ones responsible .
967214679360786434 2018-02-23 01:48:44 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @13isGodsend Was lookin at your etsy thing does it really take 4-6 weeks before it ships?
967125949497139200 2018-02-23 19:56:09 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @britneyspears Lol listenin to iheart radio and as I looked at this pic one of your songs came on. #MyCelebrityCrush #MyOnlyCelebrityCrush lol
967111417613684746 2018-02-23 18:58:24 UTC <HollawayIsHere> Banning guns is a step forward so we can continue to not raise our children right. Seems legit. Easier to go that route than to have to discipline a kid and teach them right from wrong. #FlawedLogic you're not protecting kids, you're crippling an entire generation. #GenerationFkd
967065276532625408 2018-02-23 15:55:03 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @donsid13 They didn't anticipate advancement you don't think? If you wish to excersize your 1st amendment rights about the 2nd amendment please do so by quill pen and parchment paper or send a telegraph. No using newer technology for 1st amendment rights, they didn't ok FB or electronics
967056330447032325 2018-02-23 15:19:30 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @Smitty74allday Freakin ridiculous! Had someone THERE to prevent this and he abandoned his duties when the time came.

Good luck in the future,  but this constitution loving American will be finding other means for future transportation needs.
967003586315145219 2018-02-23 11:49:55 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @MTV @Viacom @F1abraham Think the widowed mom or anything sexist discrimination went out the window with the first sex tape. Think about it, they've seen you get blasted in the pooper, respect is gone. But I could be wrong.
966995296076124160 2018-02-23 11:16:59 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein @JustABuehler @RealMcCoy2008 My deal with the age limit is this. This new generation of 18 year olds I dont think are mentally developed enough to be able to buy a gun. I don't wanna give an inch neither but they're going to and we can't stop it.
966880718361018368 2018-02-22 03:41:41 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @enews How does someone go about spending that money on surgery. Here's a couple mill, I don't wanna be pretty anymore?

966879919094480896 2018-02-22 03:38:31 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @enews @F1abraham chick was HOT in the beginning. Now I'm afraid for her to get too close to a campfire. Come out lookin like that Rocky kid from that movie with Cher
966879500762951680 2018-02-22 03:36:51 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @F1abraham @enews A new plastic surgery come out that she wants?
966876188328292352 2018-02-22 03:23:41 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RealJamesWoods And now we have thousands of teenagers who are anti gun activist now who were eating laundry detergent 2 weeks ago.
966876039375925248 2018-02-22 03:23:06 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RealJamesWoods The FBI failed to act on numerous tips and the school officer didn't act while he was there and the shooting was going on, but somehow it's trumps fault and the guns fault. Go figure.
966875564777799681 2018-02-22 03:21:12 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RealJamesWoods The Sheriff said the officer was stationed at the school and didnt go in and confront the shooter. That officer resigned today.
966874943588888577 2018-02-22 03:18:44 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RealJamesWoods is fkn AWESOME! That is all
966874200022704128 2018-02-22 03:15:47 UTC <HollawayIsHere> Is there a way to get into acting without schooling? I've always been told I should've been an actor cause of my ability to adapt, or at least make people thinkI adapted, to any environment. Never chased it but always had that "what if I did" in my mind. @RealJamesWoods
966873346989350917 2018-02-22 03:12:24 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RealJamesWoods Wow! Lengthy but definitely worth the read. I always wish I would've pursued acting but sometimes the shit I hear and read, I would've been kicked outta Hollywood as soon as I got in, the first time somebody touched my damn taint. Dude would've got a new grill
966866631623356416 2018-02-22 02:45:43 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein @RealMcCoy2008 @JustABuehler I'm ok with banning bump stocks, raising the age limit And more mental illness screening. But that's it,  although y'all won't be happy with that cause you want more. Give an inch, they want a mile.
966865906424012800 2018-02-22 02:42:50 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein @RealMcCoy2008 @JustABuehler As far as light weight,  pistols are lighter and have brb proven more deadly in a school shooting. Basically what you said, how I took it, is you wanna change the look. Which falls into "is scary lookin".
966865191551062016 2018-02-22 02:39:59 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein @RealMcCoy2008 @JustABuehler The grip makes no difference other than preference.  I personally would be against limiting clip on accessories. The look is what is so popular to a lot of people because you cab customize it to how YOU want it. You can change the look all yoy want,  it still shoots same bullet.
966786377265434626 2018-02-22 21:26:49 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SageRosenfels18 Lmao 6 shots huh? I'd probably beg to differ if you're gettin shot at. Adrenaline,  ducking, it's not a piece of paper that's just hangin there. Someone is tryin to KILL you. Just Hope they only have 5 shots
966775325656059905 2018-02-22 20:42:54 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SageRosenfels18 @House13Rockets @erg67 Oh wow. After 5? After your 2nd one here you're doin prison time. First time you get probation. Second year you do time. All felonies though
966745172808798208 2018-02-22 18:43:05 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SageRosenfels18 @House13Rockets Lmao preach? You know that's already how it is right? DUI is a felony. Felons can't purchase a firearm
966744769014763520 2018-02-22 18:41:28 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @House13Rockets @SageRosenfels18 That's how It is now ain't it? DUI = felony, felony = no gun ownership that's the way it is here in Texas.
966735572353060864 2018-02-22 18:04:56 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @nbc @CNN @realDonaldTrump Y'all do realize that special training could be a class they took, or something of that nature. You think he really meant only ex military? And they aren't going to make all teachers carry. I'm sure it will be up to the teacher. Smh
966734253219344384 2018-02-22 17:59:41 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @nbc @CNN @realDonaldTrump @ffancysk8r @PotgieterGeorge @tinapk50 @mikeoprins @davidabowden Pretty sure the 2nd amendment wasn't put here to just protect ourselves against Brits. Hence the "all enemies, foreign and domestic"
966695193410985984 2018-02-22 15:24:29 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RealJamesWoods @ChristieSpock Guess it goin viral they got some heat about it and changed it
966694896458493952 2018-02-22 15:23:18 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RealJamesWoods @ChristieSpock But not a liar, I did it with Alexa,  Google AND Bixby about 3 weeks ago. Wouldn't post something unless I was sure about it.
966694703461818368 2018-02-22 15:22:32 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RealJamesWoods @ChristieSpock Wow. I stand corrected. I'm man enough to admit it. BUT when I did this a few weeks ago after seeing a video on it I wanted to see for myself and it did happen. Just did it again and was gonna record it and now it isn't doin it.
966692038002528257 2018-02-22 15:11:56 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RealJamesWoods @ChristieSpock Dang* sure did
966691929688805378 2018-02-22 15:11:30 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RealJamesWoods @ChristieSpock I want sure did try it. More than once and when I asked who they were instead of answering me it gave me a website.  No lies here sweetie but thanks
966470748381605888 2018-02-21 00:32:37 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @MSNBC @CNN @realDonaldTrump @wolfox26271 Lol didn't think You were.
966462301997031424 2018-02-21 23:59:03 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @MSNBC @CNN @realDonaldTrump @wolfox26271 Oh I apologize. young woman then! Didn't look that close just seen the profile pic thing and assumed wrongly. Either way you sound very sharp and level headed. Hard to find in your generation and i applaud you for thinking for yourself.
966460970766929921 2018-02-21 23:53:46 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @MSNBC @CNN @realDonaldTrump @wolfox26271 Well written and wish more of your generation would do the same. Good tweet young man, sounds like you got a good head on your shoulders. Stay Woke
966460137522200576 2018-02-21 23:50:27 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @MSNBC @CNN @realDonaldTrump @JuliaCitylaw It was voted out. Trump didn't do it by himself. The regulation was never even out in place. It was written by Obama his last couple months in office and never implemented. If you read it you'll see why it was voted out. Wouldn't have helped. even the ULCA was against it
966458963431747586 2018-02-21 23:45:47 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @MSNBC @CNN @realDonaldTrump @DougGraves16mm 100% agree
966443381076447232 2018-02-21 22:43:52 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @jayfromtheday @CNN Know who really failed them? The FBI.... If ya wanna blame someone that's where the pointing should start.
966443143011987456 2018-02-21 22:42:55 UTC <HollawayIsHere> Banning #bumpstocks is like banning hookers.  How else are you gonna shoot a load that quick for $200?
966314546729189376 2018-02-21 14:11:55 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @BarackObama @springtexas10 @Chi_Hou_Seoul Lmao the regulation wouldn't have done anything. He threw together righy before his exit. So what about the other 7 years and 9 months? I understand perfectly fine because I actually looked into what he was "tryin" to get done. Not goin by a headline I read somewhere
966311448128475141 2018-02-21 13:59:37 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RealJamesWoods They say we don't "need" ar15s but people don't NEED cigarettes, liquor, or to snort coke and bang hookers either but they still do it. Yet nobody says anything cause its not their place. Same goes for what guns I own.
966295675620257797 2018-02-21 12:56:56 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @al3xw1nd @cameron_kasky @davidhogg111 @Emma4Change @JaclynCorin @kira_lerner @wendzedin The pain in their eyes is heartbreaking
966294574703497217 2018-02-21 12:52:34 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @BillOReilly @McCtheKnife Any thing used to hurt someone or "assault" someone is an assault weapon.  There's no one weapon that term called that unless it's used in that way.
966287166518284288 2018-02-21 12:23:07 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @BarackObama @TestyTarheel EXACTLY!!!!!
966285445775716354 2018-02-21 12:16:17 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @BarackObama @springtexas10 @Chi_Hou_Seoul Clearly you didn't read the regulation that was never implemented. Even the ACLU opposed the regulation and they are always for more gun control. Also it was VOTED down, Trump didn't do it all by himself
966006513230893057 2018-02-20 17:47:54 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @MichaelRapaport Lol almost sounds like you're a little bitter she attacked your man. That sounded like something a hood rat would've said to someone clowning her boyfriend lmao too funny
965805541191835649 2018-02-19 04:29:19 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @ymedeiros @Cowboycerrone Great fight fellas! That right there is how it's done!  Great sportsmanship and respect for each other. 2 of the best in the sport. Good show guys,  we love yall!
965423672063418368 2018-02-18 03:11:54 UTC <HollawayIsHere> Wish I would've known @Cowboycerrone was gonna be in Texas! Dammit! By far my all time favorite fighter. Good luck tonight brother! Wish I was there and could drink a beer to celebrate with ya when ya get that W!
965319356975603713 2018-02-18 20:17:24 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein @joannecar Because what's happening now people are raising monsters and not children.
965319204705587205 2018-02-18 20:16:47 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein @joannecar 100% agree. They've pretty much made life so expensive that both parents HAVE to work. And every one has become so dependent on technology that that alone requires a part time job to pay for. I understand it's hard to raise kids with both working but gotta figure out a way.
965313834255872001 2018-02-18 19:55:27 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein @jadesaisquoi Yeah? Over 18 is an adult. And 18-25 are Millennials. Same area that are committing most of these horrific acts.
965308243919728642 2018-02-18 19:33:14 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein @JustABuehler We can't keep "child proofing" the country.  Somebody is gonna have to start teaching kids
965308028839972864 2018-02-18 19:32:23 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein @JustABuehler You change the look of laundry detergent to stop them from hurting themselves and others,  you want to ban guns cause you think it'll stop them from shooting people, guess what,  they'll find another way. If you smash your thumb with a hammer is it the hammers fault?
965307482699698176 2018-02-18 19:30:13 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein @JustABuehler Also didn't have the internet and Social media to contribute to the things kids are subject to now. Guns have always been around,  this getting worse isn't due to guns,  it's due to the mentality if these youngsters.
965307076288401408 2018-02-18 19:28:36 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein @JustABuehler No they weren't perfect. How common was all this mess back then?  Every generation is getting worse,  it doesn't take  a PHD to see that.  When the ban was in effect there weren't kids running around eating tide pods, smoking KUSH, and on anti psychotic medications like now
965306214186930181 2018-02-18 19:25:10 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein @joannecar Did you spend time with them?  Teach them to respect others?  Because that's where there's a big disconnect. There are a lot of "parents" that would rather just medicate and then head to the bar.
965224735046094848 2018-02-18 14:01:24 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @renato_mariotti How can you not see he was speaking hypothetical? So far the "collusion" from Russia was in favor of Killary and she still lost. You libs are something else lol
965072657233469440 2018-02-17 03:57:06 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @RealJamesWoods Right? Now it's ban guns so kids can't get their hands on them. Just last week we were changing the look of laundry detergent so they wouldn't be so tempted to eat them. Not about guns,  it's a nation of chemically dependent youngsters that lack love and discipline.
965009491463950336 2018-02-17 23:46:06 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein @joannecar To an extent yes. Noy being able too spank your kids,  trying to be a friend instead of a parent,  and if their kids run in the house they put em on medication.  That generation is completely out of control. Respect is no longer taught
964966194183835648 2018-02-17 20:54:03 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein Banning guns will work! Look what it did for heroin!
964965970115813377 2018-02-17 20:53:10 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein @BruceB010 No one NEEDS cigarettes either. It's a choice people make owning them.
964965710744219648 2018-02-17 20:52:08 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein @Anastas48819550 This is almost the dumbest thing I've read all day. These are the same gun. One just looks scarypic.twitter.com/RpYF46GXqB
964965139769421825 2018-02-17 20:49:52 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @SenFeinstein Nothing to do with the ban. Back then we had kids that had respect for others and regards to human life. It's not the guns, it's the generation of youth. Same ones that we have to change the appearance of laundry detergent so they won't eat it.

964773015924957184 2018-02-17 08:06:26 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump @AltMtRainier Why ban any gun? Last I checked, heroin was banned from the U.S. don't these folks bringin it over and the ones buying it know that? Ban guns and it'll be the same thing. Only the bad people will have them. Genius.
964772437945651200 2018-02-17 08:04:08 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump Make psychiatrist report to NICS when someone is put on anti-psychotic meds. Anybody on them don't get approved for a firearm. Problem solved. You're welcome.

964598555938783233 2018-02-16 20:33:11 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump @WomenRecoverATL I can agree with that. I don't mind raising the age and having a license. And most guns are semi automatic just FYI...
964555999129559042 2018-02-16 17:44:05 UTC <HollawayIsHere> Replace psychiatric medications with marijuana. You never seen someone smoke a joint and say "I think I'll shoot up a school". #StopMedicatingKids
964555709005402113 2018-02-16 17:42:56 UTC <HollawayIsHere> Wanna fix the problem of mass shootings? Take kids off all this medication they're on. Stop forcing pills down their throat so you don't have to deal with em. This overly medicated generation is the problem, not guns.
964459335681064961 2018-02-16 11:19:59 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump @WomenRecoverATL It stops when we as a society take responsibility for these kids and see that it's a people problem not a gun issue.
964458541607141377 2018-02-16 11:16:49 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump @WomenRecoverATL As a matter of fact I have! Quite a few that love to hunt and fish and have never hurt anyone even when they were mad! Who are we to tell them they don't need one?
964336043880312832 2018-02-15 03:10:04 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump @WomenRecoverATL How about the ones that aren't on SS benefits, are those people Trumps responsibility. Guns aren't the issue. And you can't violate every person with different levels of mental illness constitutional rights because you are uneducated on mental illness.
964335270282833920 2018-02-15 03:06:59 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump @WomenRecoverATL Mmmk so someone with down syndrome. They are violent people? Not everybody on SS for mental illness is a violent killer in fact I would bet a very small percent are. So we're going to punish someone for being mentally ill and stereotype them all as being violent? Sounds right
964291887329837057 2018-02-15 00:14:36 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @realDonaldTrump @WomenRecoverATL Did you by any chance read thise regulations of Obama's that were repealed? Guessin not by your reply. Is every mentally ill person violent?
964290752074469377 2018-02-15 00:10:05 UTC <HollawayIsHere> @NRA @realDonaldTrump @RickyAppleseed Guessin you never read the regulation Obama put in place
