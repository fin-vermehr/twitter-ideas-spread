899459415925022721 2017-08-20 02:33:30 UTC <trfcdan86> @HazardF5 Didn't see the pre show. In 3 and a half hours of me watching personally, I've seen one decent match. RAW tag team. On a whole tho, awful.
899458520231313408 2017-08-20 02:29:57 UTC <trfcdan86> @HazardF5 It needs saving, the whole show has been absolutely awful.
899458012355735555 2017-08-20 02:27:55 UTC <trfcdan86> @LAWradio This whole show has been absolutely awful. After the G1 last week, the WWE's product is far far inferior to NJPW at the moment.

899412669421281280 2017-08-20 23:27:45 UTC <trfcdan86> @HazardF5 Mean they are beyond criticism, and that's coming from a guy who is ex forces.
899412526131183618 2017-08-20 23:27:11 UTC <trfcdan86> @HazardF5 Because of the tweet he sent to that guy in the air force? If so that's BS. Just because someone's in the military doesn't.......

867303206359109632 2017-05-24 08:56:12 UTC <trfcdan86> @piersmorgan @MoAnsar for the endless death toll in the name of your religion. If it's a numbers game, your lot will always win, unanimously. 2/2
867302940343758848 2017-05-24 08:55:09 UTC <trfcdan86> @piersmorgan @MoAnsar I as a "white folk" am quite willing to take responsibility for this one off incident, if you as a muslim will do the same.......1/2
866938853495590912 2017-05-23 08:48:24 UTC <trfcdan86> @piersmorgan @GazAustin777 @MrsStewart31 @MrsKTTurner Completely fucking irelevant and the sort of mindset that lets this BS continue. The root of the problem is Islam!
866802506852175872 2017-05-22 23:46:36 UTC <trfcdan86> @Teknofish My apologies
866801609019359233 2017-05-22 23:43:02 UTC <trfcdan86> @Teknofish "Oh no Tommy Robinson" Seems he was right.
866794206819495937 2017-05-22 23:13:37 UTC <trfcdan86> @TRobinsonNewEra It's to no ones benefit to "jump the gun" and assume. All will come out, until then say nothing.
866071542823874560 2017-05-20 23:22:01 UTC <trfcdan86> @Teknofish That's the point, they have none. Something alien to us.
862620369328508933 2017-05-11 10:48:17 UTC <trfcdan86> @notaxation @DRenaissanceMan I think you've completely missed the point.
861929775845310464 2017-05-09 13:04:07 UTC <trfcdan86> @TranmereRovers @TheNationalLge @WallaceEMann That's Football.
861613345757122560 2017-05-08 16:06:44 UTC <trfcdan86> @notaxation If Karl Marx was against uncontrolled or illegal immigration, he'd be labeled as "far right" in this current year.
861607829316227072 2017-05-08 15:44:49 UTC <trfcdan86> @ronanburtenshaw "You'll never eat again" more like.
861607439308902401 2017-05-08 15:43:16 UTC <trfcdan86> I'll revisit this tweet in June, and we'll see how the people view him.
861085885911240705 2017-05-06 05:10:48 UTC <trfcdan86> @Dazed @CampbellAddy @Levis_UK @lloyd_dennison Diversity means "non white"
859119867869491201 2017-05-01 18:58:32 UTC <trfcdan86> @anthonyfjoshua @Michael_Buffer The people don't have a choice. We must respect the lineage of the HW title, @Tyson_Fury is the champ until defeated.
858648377856274432 2017-04-30 11:45:00 UTC <trfcdan86> @RonnieSigei @theJeremyVine Yeh, his name is Tyson Fury.
858594148928172032 2017-04-30 08:09:31 UTC <trfcdan86> @anthonyfjoshua @SkySportsBoxing @MatchroomBoxing @batter_bookies The IBO isn't a world title, and unifying involves beating another champ. The IBF, WBA, WBO belts still belong to a man who never lost them.
858450523384676352 2017-04-29 22:38:48 UTC <trfcdan86> @anthonyfjoshua @SkySportsBoxing @MatchroomBoxing How did he unify? Wlad had no belts. And let's be honest, that IBF belt is Tyson Fury's.
856449987613532161 2017-04-24 10:09:23 UTC <trfcdan86> @jdsportsfashion @Lawrence_tko @TonyBellew @EddieHearn It's very much disputed when the lineal heavyweight champion isn't involved.
844846556306071552 2017-03-23 09:41:30 UTC <trfcdan86> @TRobinsonNewEra Thank you for all that you do.
843083669732507648 2017-03-18 12:56:25 UTC <trfcdan86> @LadyDurrant get these fucking people away from our continent!
842453665147412480 2017-03-16 19:13:00 UTC <trfcdan86> @TheCannonBriggs @SkySportsBoxing The WBA has gone from the most prestigious organisation to the absolute worst. 3 WBA champs per div. JOKE!
842063387894923266 2017-03-15 17:22:11 UTC <trfcdan86> @AuroraBlogspot @mwckennedy I agree, and hope they vote PVV too.
838172836497879042 2017-03-04 23:42:31 UTC <trfcdan86> @mrdavidhaye loved you before the fight, hated you after the build up, and now love you once more, credit to the sport!
838170889418059776 2017-03-04 23:34:47 UTC <trfcdan86> @MrWelburn because Tyson Fury wasn't in it.
