But, they didn't cry, scream, beat people,  but you, you just don't stop a year later. Get over it
958547315983298560 2018-01-30 03:47:43 UTC <karma41047> @FrankLuntz You owe more then Donald Trump an apology. You owe an apology to all the "Deplorables" who you insulted with your actions..I lost respect for you. Maybe your post is a first step, let's see if you have the nuts to look in the mirror and take it to the next level.

Instead of playing to the base, put your big boy pants on and roll yourself back a dozen years.. You might remember, when you could look in the mirror?

958412559413063680 2018-01-30 18:52:15 UTC <karma41047> @chuckwoolery I think I  was right 9 years ago to switch parties. They are poison.
958342709277872128 2018-01-30 14:14:41 UTC <karma41047> Get together with Bernie and your compatriots. The democrats ate the richest people in Congress. How did you all get your money? I know, we're too stupid to get it. REDISTRIBUTE, FREE YOURSELF OF THAT DIRTY MONEY, BUT LEAVE THE REST OF US ALONE
958342695797379072 2018-01-30 14:14:38 UTC <karma41047> Take your 100 million and you support the dreamers. Ask your party to open their homes.Most Americans are resentful, a $1,000 is not crumbs, it may be the difference between them keeping the lights on or not. Go away Nancy, you're poison. Take the other lunatics with you.
958342693972791296 2018-01-30 14:14:38 UTC <karma41047> The democrats didn't follow the process of putting it out there like the republicans. I don't care for the Rhinos either, I just want a government for the people. This is certainly not the democrat party of today. Here's a suggestion:
958342692764835840 2018-01-30 14:14:37 UTC <karma41047> @NancyPelosi damn fool, time to shut up. As a former dem, I sit in disbelief about the garbage you spew. Every American should be ashamed of you. Here's a simple question, how can you say the memo is filled with lies when 12 democrats read it? Lol, a 12 page rebuttal?
958311435431444480 2018-01-30 12:10:25 UTC <karma41047> @RealJamesWoods Thank you for bringing us this beautiful picture of this beautiful woman taken so needlessly.

958017841718005760 2018-01-29 16:43:47 UTC <karma41047> @jordie_ray I hope they are. For our sakes

958016821298454528 2018-01-29 16:39:43 UTC <karma41047> @chuckwoolery those of us who knew this were forced to speak in the bathroom at work because we were called racists. In 2012, those of us who were hit by Hurricane Sandy dragged ourselves in the dark to place a vote to hopefully get him out. This is not a shock.

958015020520091648 2018-01-29 16:32:34 UTC <karma41047> The deplorables hope you'll stay around. You remind so many why Donald Trump won. All of you are out if touch. I heard democrats on the news today say HILLARY GO AWAY! I admire those willing to speak the truth. I believe many others are hoping you'll go away for a long time.
958015018699821056 2018-01-29 16:32:34 UTC <karma41047> @HillaryClinton last night on the awards show demonstrates why you lost the run for president twice. It also shows how your entertainment buddies are as stupid as you are. Hillary, I hope you enjoyed your moment last night. 1/2 of your party wants your you to go away.

953608025524318213 2018-01-17 12:40:45 UTC <karma41047> @chuckwoolery I don't know how these people look in the mirror. I have never seen such childish behavior, each and every one of them should hang their head in shame. Trump is a master, by telling the doctor to answer all questions, he gave them the floor to show what morons the press pool are.
953606569102626816 2018-01-17 12:34:57 UTC <karma41047> @marklevinshow Mark, how the hell did we get here. I am sorry John McCain is ill, but I never liked or trusted him. Is it not time for him to step down? These people in Congress don't care about the American people. Why is this evil man still controlling our destiny?

953465755584073728 2018-01-16 03:15:25 UTC <karma41047> I thought when I was a Democrat that you had so much potential, boy, I was wrong. You are a opportunist, you showed your true colors when you threw Jeff Sessions, your friend, under the bus.  So to follow your lead, YOUR ACTIONS WERE UNACCEPTABLE. EXPLAIN YOUR INACTION..
953465753721757697 2018-01-16 03:15:24 UTC <karma41047> @CoryBooker hey your acting stunt fell short today. You were DISGUSTING to the Director of Homeland security.TELL ME, WHERE WAS YOUR OUTRAGE WHEN AN ILLEGAL ALIEN IN YOUR DISTRICT..RAPED A 6 YEAR OLD?.  Did I miss the memo? I don't see a statement nor tears of outrage from you.
953424221857869826 2018-01-16 00:30:22 UTC <karma41047> @PressSec @POTUS , great job at making the press pool look stupid. I know it looks that way daily, but you outdid yourself today.

952172937875984384 2018-01-13 13:38:13 UTC <karma41047> @MiaBLove can I ask one question? Were you in the room? I like you, but you are reacting to Dick Durban and Leslie Graham who are both liars? This is not a, sign of a good leader, sorry.

Shut up with your ignorance already, many of us want the wall. It is not even possible to have a conversation with anyone you disagree with anymore.

941724743799070720 2017-12-15 17:40:49 UTC <karma41047> @jimmykimmel liar liar, is a retraction in order? Boy, it's bad,when the WAPO rag calls you out Jimmy. Idiot, you are the poster child for spreading propaganda.https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2017/12/14/progress-wapo-actually-factchecked-jimmy-kimmel-latest-misleading-partisan-lecture-n2422064
941720176688496640 2017-12-15 17:22:41 UTC <karma41047> @jimmykimmel did any of your liberal media or friends send you this article?  Let's see how you handle this:http://dailycaller.com/2017/12/14/fbi-hillary-clinton-email-investigation-peter-strzok-lisa-page-james-comey/?utm_content=buffer90954&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer
941660504833122304 2017-12-15 13:25:34 UTC <karma41047> @jimmykimmel , you going to have something to say about the Wall Street journal? Not partisan... let's see if you have the nuts.https://twitter.com/KimStrassel/status/941317285083410432
941655839932403712 2017-12-15 13:07:02 UTC <karma41047> I felt that way about you too. I hope it can stay that way. Please, you can be a healer, a person who brings people together, this tweet is beneath you. When do decent people say enough..
941655838527311874 2017-12-15 13:07:01 UTC <karma41047> I walked away because Camelot is dead, this is no longer a  party who wants to help people. they are just a party of people who care about power.. You are in good company, I respect @AlanDersh , @DouglasESchoen  and Jonathan Turley, they are fair and honest.
941655836488863744 2017-12-15 13:07:01 UTC <karma41047> @thehonorablecsc you are better then this. 44 filled the courts with leftist partisans, and I despised everything that the party stood for. . Be fair, you are one of the few democrats left that I have any respect for. I used to be a democrat.https://twitter.com/GretaJ19/status/941649144405479424
941651913682153472 2017-12-15 12:51:25 UTC <karma41047> Sara, we're waiting, patiently. It's more than the frustration of conservatives being treated like 2nd class citizens, we need to see these people brought to justice. I really believe a perp walk will.. after the blow up.. begin the healing. I humbly thank you. You are amazing.
941651912390316033 2017-12-15 12:51:25 UTC <karma41047> Jimmy, you are being challenged. Read Sara's articles, maybe, just maybe, you will use your platform for good instead of fear mongering. You'll never have the balls to sit with someone as intelligent as Sara, why lose ratings when you can keep stirring the pot?
941651910876114944 2017-12-15 12:51:25 UTC <karma41047> @SaraCarterDC thank you. You remind me there are good honest people working as a real journalist to bring real facts. I am a great fan, Too bad @jimmykimmel does not choose to sit with you to go over documented facts instead of the democrat talking points.
941649343576264706 2017-12-15 12:41:13 UTC <karma41047> @jimmykimmel , every consider judicial watch for your fact? ACLJ? Nah.... why learn factshttps://twitter.com/JudicialWatch/status/941316393827471360
941646903393116160 2017-12-15 12:31:31 UTC <karma41047> @TwitchyTeam Yes, he's the best late night asshole. I can't watch him anymore.
941646607602409473 2017-12-15 12:30:20 UTC <karma41047> @thedailybeast Challenge this jerk to a factual discussion. I wonder... Could he handle the truth?
941646283219009536 2017-12-15 12:29:03 UTC <karma41047> @clivebushjd How is it possible that all these people are so stupid? Not funny, not intelligent, yes...ignorance. So sad
941645909028417536 2017-12-15 12:27:34 UTC <karma41047> @jimmykimmel You are a jerk.
941645629381586945 2017-12-15 12:26:27 UTC <karma41047> One day, you may regret this idiocy, I feel sorry for your child. Besides this poor childs physical ailments, you'll raise him to be partisan. Great job indoctrinating him with bias. Such a waste of talent.
941645627464781824 2017-12-15 12:26:27 UTC <karma41047> Your Chuck Shumer talking points are wrong, you are fearmongering.. Take a leave and spend a month watching Jay Leno and Johnny Carson shows, comedians not playing politics.... understanding people want to laugh. REAL MEN who didn't find it necessary to alienate half the country.
941645626005250048 2017-12-15 12:26:26 UTC <karma41047> I know you are the morality police given your history, and I know you don't give a crap if conservatives are your audience, but if you ever have the balls to have an intelligent conversation and a willingness to spend time with a conservative, you may learn how wrong you are.
941645624226828289 2017-12-15 12:26:26 UTC <karma41047> @jimmykimmel I can't watch you anymore. You have ruined late night... Used to like relaxing and not hearing politics. You are entitled to your views, but your talking points are so wrong most of the time, so easily debunked. You are spreading propaganda. I wish you would stop.

940596961908060161 2017-12-12 14:59:25 UTC <karma41047> @SenGillibrand as allegations against men prove false, women will NOT be believed. I didn't like Am Franken, but he didn't deserve to be pushed out for antics from when he east a comedian. Democrats made him sacrificial lamb, but we're on to it.
940596468418863104 2017-12-12 14:57:28 UTC <karma41047> @SenGillibrand please, STOP with the games. You and your pink hats are lying, this will bounce back at you. Clearly, you screwed over the Clinton's, you showed who you really are. You will be very successful in hurting women.
940212948110323712 2017-12-11 13:33:29 UTC <karma41047> @megynkelly why are you not interviewing the people Matt Lauer abused? Do you really need a ratings boost .. Hurt the people who have faith in Trump, for your ego? Bomb in NY, put it away Kelly, we are facing so many threats as a country, please, stop.
940210549979271168 2017-12-11 13:23:58 UTC <karma41047> @chelseahandler listen, you evil, r hateful woman. Fires, bombs in Port Authority, and your vile mouth is the last thing anyone wants to hear. Shut up   "trollop" and do something good. Oh, and it's not Trump, it's probably g-d, this is the gift 44 left.https://twitter.com/BroadwayJay2/status/940013198027214848
940209582659526657 2017-12-11 13:20:07 UTC <karma41047> @BroadwayJay2 Beautiful, I wish more "celebrities" would use their influence in such a positive manner. Bless you

939486453612077056 2017-12-09 13:26:40 UTC <karma41047> @lindseyvonn I believe you are a spoiled brat millennial, and I would like to add to the chorus, you don't represent me. Very sad what your generation is.. you could be a leader, but instead, you chose loser.
939486031044366336 2017-12-09 13:24:59 UTC <karma41047> @lindseyvonn I am sorry, you are disappointment. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but someone representing USA represents president too, even if you don't like him. I didn't like Obama, in fact, hated everything about him, but I never disrespected the office.
939330514607067136 2017-12-08 03:07:01 UTC <karma41047> @AlanDersh You are an honorable man. Leave that disgusting party, I did. Those that are turning on you...unfortunately, you're never too old to see a person's true colors. You are very relevant, respected, add in Jonathan Turley and Doug Schoen, you remind us that maybe.Camelot is not dead?
939329083393105925 2017-12-08 03:01:20 UTC <karma41047> @RealJamesWoods No, they are not a hoot, they are demented.

939326458127880192 2017-12-08 02:50:54 UTC <karma41047> @DouglasESchoen I just want you to know how much respect I have for you. I became very disgusted with the democrats after Bush, the centrists are a dying breed. I left the party years ago, I cannot take the sickness of the left. You are a good honest man, bless you.

How about coming further out of the bubble and live amongst us regular people. You might find we are not all that different. I welcome any normal discussion.

927297302884225024 2017-11-05 22:11:20 UTC <karma41047> @seanhannity @JOHNNYAPPLE65 I heard that they don't carry in that church. Criminal, it could have been stopped.

927280192002887680 2017-11-05 21:03:20 UTC <karma41047> @Alyssa_Milano if someone was carrying, they might have stopped it. Guns, cars, knives, get it right, it is sick people notb the weapon.
927279662748913670 2017-11-05 21:01:14 UTC <karma41047> @Alyssa_Milano, history and econ 101 for you, might help you sound intelligent. Here's recent history. Big mouthhttps://twitter.com/FrankLuntz/status/927261822725398528

927146641794224128 2017-11-05 12:12:39 UTC <karma41047> @JudicialWatch @TomFitton Bernie supporters were lied to by Bernie, just check into his 3 houses.. Follow the money, but yes, they were screwed by the DNC.

927144377335582720 2017-11-05 12:03:39 UTC <karma41047> @BillOReilly How about this. Maybe it is successful because it is about spirituality and not the killing crap, Lil, from people who want guns banned.
926786695164334080 2017-11-04 12:22:21 UTC <karma41047> @ericbolling Everyone should get a cut. Why are people penalized for success. I am not a 1%, they are not the issue. It is wasteful spending.
926785337875054594 2017-11-04 12:16:58 UTC <karma41047> @RobbyMook Lol, do you think anyone but the resist is listening anymore? Three dying breeds, Hollywood, NFL and DNC. RIP. You have "0" credibility.
926784639829708801 2017-11-04 12:14:11 UTC <karma41047> @RobbyMook lol, you suddenly want to move forward, HA! I will NEVER vote Democrat again, you're all liars and everyone knows it.

925829411391328257 2017-11-01 20:58:27 UTC <karma41047> @SenSchumer 3).... You are an embarrassment to NY, and I reject your type of politicking. So sad, you could have restored the party.
925828970595135494 2017-11-01 20:56:42 UTC <karma41047> @SenSchumer 2) ... That you would be bipartisan and restore integrity to the Democrat Party. This FORMER Democrat will remain former.
925828567526756352 2017-11-01 20:55:06 UTC <karma41047> @SenSchumer  1) i used to have so much respect for you. I was so relieved when Harry Reid left. I wanted to believe...
925172532436709376 2017-10-30 01:28:15 UTC <karma41047> @seanhannity No, the only equal justice is on the left. They are equally guilty but walking free. I pray every day for the America. Is she gone?

923725799127207936 2017-10-26 01:39:27 UTC <karma41047> @seanhannity Trump won't always be President. We need protection, soverenty, and NEVER let this Alinsky play book happen again.
923725457778008065 2017-10-26 01:38:05 UTC <karma41047> @seanhannity they need to be punished. Just like the border wall, why build it since ILLEGAL immigration is down? Why
923725122665672704 2017-10-26 01:36:45 UTC <karma41047> @seanhannity so sick of the monsters. Its time for the elitism to end. Cut off the heads, Soros, Obama and the rest.

920961159737544704 2017-10-19 10:33:45 UTC <karma41047> @Alyssa_Milano your #metoo is a stunt. Why don't you do something like going to women's shelters, police ride a long, suicide hotline.
