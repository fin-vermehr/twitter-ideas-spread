964682901869813760 2018-02-16 02:08:21 UTC <usmcrush> Please define Assault weapon, is it a knife, knife hand, hammer, or even a sword? Anything used to cause bodily harm could be classified as assault weapon.
964681681776103430 2018-02-16 02:03:30 UTC <usmcrush> @ProudResister @williamgibbard But I thought AR15 stands for Assault Rifle! 
964680931561885696 2018-02-16 02:00:31 UTC <usmcrush> @ProudResister So we need to ban knives, baseball bats, and/or scissors? Anything can be an assault weapon. By the way, AR doesnt stand for Assault Rifle.
