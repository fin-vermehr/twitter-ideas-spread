970777064138838021 2018-03-05 21:44:22 UTC <TheTexas1845> @PaulLee85 @ErickB556 And your statement is wrong in itself cause everyone of them has broken the law.     100% crime rate
970776235956617216 2018-03-05 21:41:05 UTC <TheTexas1845> @PaulLee85 @ErickB556 Seeing as how these illegals only make up roughly 4-6% of the population. Just think if these border jumpers wasn't here there would be even less crime

970765253347700736 2018-03-05 20:57:27 UTC <TheTexas1845> @PaulLee85 @ErickB556 Go to the nearest immigration office apply for a temporary visa or work visa or school visa, not that difficult, some of these border jumpers have been here for 20-30 years, if they are in fact "dreamers" they would take the necessary steps.
970748369751621632 2018-03-05 19:50:21 UTC <TheTexas1845> @PaulLee85 @ErickB556 If one of them was that smart they would have known to get their shit together to become legal!
