932340519291768832 2017-11-19 20:11:16 UTC <jesrober> @_alex_mcmanus_ @alyssacordell10 Well your opinion sucks. If you use the word failure you are downplaying the hard work all these kids put in from all the schools that don't win a ring. No way around that. You are what's wrong with sports today. If you don't win your a failure? Get real.

917394242300936192 2017-10-09 14:20:06 UTC <jesrober> @DineshDSouza I'd she hadn't said anything we'd all be condemning her. I commend her for acknowledging the wrong doing, regardless of her past statements.

912116340001054720 2017-09-24 00:47:36 UTC <jesrober> @ClayTravis @thebiglead It's BS that a penalty like that can be offset by an unsportsmanlike penalty. Certain penalties should stand regardless of what happens next
912045840960770052 2017-09-24 20:07:28 UTC <jesrober> @Chiefs Give the players another venue to vent like the browns did and then stand for the anthem. Is that so hard. Got to show respect for America.

906694453510983680 2017-09-09 01:42:57 UTC <jesrober> @SportsTalkwBo Defense played tough, offense is in shambles. Bad passes, bad routes, couldn't create lanes, and the coach seems underwhelmed by it all.

691075246921650177 2016-01-23 01:49:13 UTC <jesrober> Some days you've just got to be willing to get your hands dirty and jump in to do the hardest part of life yourself.
