958916807200518144 2018-01-31 04:15:57 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> And now we are getting a divorce..

958814377200836608 2018-01-31 21:28:56 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I've narrowed it down to Ford and Dodge. Between 1999 and 2006. It would have to be an epic truck to make me go lower than 1999. (I LOVED our 1985 F150 but alas Henry is gone.)
958813565313519616 2018-01-31 21:25:42 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I'm serious. I would like to know what y'all think. Chevy Silverado was vetoed because my mechanic dad had to replace EVERYTHING in a brand new one. Hates them.

930813257413287942 2017-11-15 15:02:28 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Giving an artist 12 days to make a huge intricate portrait is insane.
930813117939974145 2017-11-15 15:01:55 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> $50 for a 14x17 portrait you want in (then) 12 days is a lot to ask. $50 is cheap compaired to what others charge.
930812738552651776 2017-11-15 15:00:25 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I was asked to sketch another portrait earlier this week for someone. When I quoted the price and gave the size, they dropped off the face of the earth. #artistproblems

928056826452692992 2017-11-07 00:29:24 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @WatchChad People came together. Which seems like something that may never happen again with so much hate being tossed about.
928056303028785152 2017-11-07 00:27:19 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Some people just refuse to listen to reason. I've been attacked all day, would you please give it a bloody rest.

928020876804620288 2017-11-07 22:06:33 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @AndyRichter @monkeysunkle11 Yes, a hobbyist does. I know hobbyists that take them to range days. There is nothing wrong with law-abiding citizens having them for a range day.

927966622270320642 2017-11-07 18:30:58 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @curtisstigers The people doing the attacking aren't hobbyists. They have mental issues.

927965251638841345 2017-11-07 18:25:31 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @curtisstigers Do you think regular people should own Gatling guns? I actually see no reason a normal person should.
927965013821796358 2017-11-07 18:24:34 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @curtisstigers People that are hobbyists should have no issues owning certain weapons. People with mental (lets say, issues?) Should not own weapons.
927964527794286592 2017-11-07 18:22:38 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @realDonaldTrump @wiccandivamom4 Oh I do think it is a big issue.
927957285363732480 2017-11-07 17:53:52 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @curtisstigers Why what?
927955993467785222 2017-11-07 17:48:44 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @urbandoll A good eyeshadow pallet with more than just "nude" colors.

927938136558243842 2017-11-07 16:37:46 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @AndyRichter @monkeysunkle11 I said guns. Seriously. Normal people with guns go hunting or to a range.

927933203222024192 2017-11-07 16:18:10 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Who the hell calls someone a "gun humper" are you 12?

927930546847698945 2017-11-07 16:07:37 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> It may be under the BAN, but it is NOT an assault weapon or rifle.

927718917883211776 2017-11-06 02:06:40 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I may get a bit cheeky with people when they talk about things they know NOTHING about, but I would NEVER tell someone to kill themselves.
927718151579668480 2017-11-06 02:03:38 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Let me make this perfectly clear. It is NOT OK to tell someone to kill themselves over their views on mental health OR gun control.

788932757011460096 2016-10-19 02:40:01 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I haven't lost my everlovin mind yet and I don't plan on acting like a fool before, during, or after the wedding. Haha

788929787821690880 2016-10-19 02:28:13 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> So this happened... https://www.instagram.com/p/BLxJmGMgpyq/
788904837740191748 2016-10-19 00:49:05 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> However, if you want to see a bridezilla, my mother is a perfect example..
788903467855347716 2016-10-19 00:43:38 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> People are actually waiting for me to completely flip out like they've seen on #Bridezilla jeez seriously? I'm not flipping tables.
788847474005909504 2016-10-19 21:01:08 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Probably one of the only things that I've actually had to veto
788841597777637376 2016-10-19 20:37:47 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> So... My mother bought fake meth for the wedding... also known as rock candy... https://www.instagram.com/p/BLwhfaDA3Rs/
788571438592786432 2016-10-18 02:44:16 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @wadsworthdidit I'll see about getting tickets for a hockey game sometime. It would be a Preds game.
788571189086150656 2016-10-18 02:43:17 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I wear many hats. I like hockey, theater, sketching, hiking, sewing, and many other things..
788570691733979136 2016-10-18 02:41:18 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @wadsworthdidit I'm not sure, but I was teasing & only half serious about going. I was going to try and get us tickets to a hockey game 1st
788569539764256768 2016-10-18 02:36:43 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Coincidentally, @wadsworthdidit RENT is coming to Nashville lol
788569299178881024 2016-10-18 02:35:46 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @Rockin2012Robin I would love to see Rent live.
788568826841538560 2016-10-18 02:33:53 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> but the one play/movie I cannot stand is West Side Story.. I just cannot enjoy it.
788568759057383424 2016-10-18 02:33:37 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I'm not uneducated, I took dance, I was in band since elementary school, I am certainly artistic...
788568333499195392 2016-10-18 02:31:56 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @Rockin2012Robin I used to be a theater/band kid but I've never liked West Side Story. Rent, I like.. Phantom of The Opera, I like...
788567696585744384 2016-10-18 02:29:24 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> And now they are actually acting like chickens pecking feed in a dance scene...
788565177662836736 2016-10-18 02:19:23 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I'm so so sorry, but I can't stand West Side Story. It makes no sense. Who goes around snapping, dancing, and singing.. IN A GANG?

788210600388296704 2016-10-17 02:50:26 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @erin_rawlinson @LadySolitaire83 JUST saw this. Love it!
788208437524099072 2016-10-17 02:41:50 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @daisherz365 One question... Do you like perfume?
788204724839452672 2016-10-17 02:27:05 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I can hardly wait to spend a few days with @daisherz365 before the wedding.
787940657881120774 2016-10-17 08:57:46 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Also finally got Geoff to agree to watch the new #RockyHorror with me.
787940144343085056 2016-10-17 08:55:44 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Today is my first day of leave from work. I'll be busy moving more things to the apartment and potentially putting out wedding related fires
787933148025917440 2016-10-17 08:27:56 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I need a truck, or a friend with a truck. I can pay gas money and there would be free food involved...

786946012434796544 2016-10-14 15:05:24 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I have friends and family that ride motorcycles, and I've rode with and plan to ride with again.
786945715054469120 2016-10-14 15:04:13 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Telling me that I look like "a biker wh&*#" isn't the best choice of words darlin. The only thing offensive in that was the last word.
786919957879746560 2016-10-14 13:21:52 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> You'd think that after a whole call center full of escalations about pushing sales, "the client" would learn it isn't such a good idea..
786919807786553344 2016-10-14 13:21:17 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> We are supposed to be customer service, not pushing sales.. But "the client" wants us to push tv service and adding lines for tablets/cells
786918988810948609 2016-10-14 13:18:01 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I've been working too much. When I'm on breaks I'm not even really on breaks, I'm helping the newbies.

766498900995899392 2016-08-18 04:55:53 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I sort of hate myself for asking that, but when you look through all device tutorials, ask iPhone users near you, managers and support and

748290972820381696 2016-06-29 23:04:05 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @wadsworthdidit what the hell is this one
748280334706417664 2016-06-29 22:21:48 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Yes, I am using emojis to talk to my sister-in-law. My phone has emojis. Oh my gosh. 
748263903805771776 2016-06-29 21:16:31 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @wadsworthdidit my dad doesn't do country
748263733391138816 2016-06-29 21:15:50 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @wadsworthdidit he would never follow 99% of those
748258945551208448 2016-06-29 20:56:49 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @wadsworthdidit ps that twitter you follow is not my dad.
748258447343390720 2016-06-29 20:54:50 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Don't get snotty when I ask you questions on how to log into a credit card account YOU set up in my name. I don't need a card...
747124435782635520 2016-06-26 17:48:41 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> yup
746842208020668416 2016-06-25 23:07:12 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Wow.. "To be honest I want you to have a baby, but you are not mother material." Stop talking mom.
746796554372124672 2016-06-25 20:05:48 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> My mom doesn't like what I have for my hair so she's sent at least 25 emails with different things. #weddinghair
746512676575129600 2016-06-24 01:17:46 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Took me 2 and a half hours but I finally got through to HP tech and they are going to fix my laptop. Yay!

746292353900683264 2016-06-24 10:42:17 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Why do people favorite things when I'm upset?
745775387519627264 2016-06-22 00:28:02 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> So my phone is not going to work because the SIM card is bad. Took me 4 calls and over an hour to @boostmobile to get things done.
745686505851609092 2016-06-22 18:34:51 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @RockinNeeneer very nice!

745615771959758851 2016-06-22 13:53:47 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @RockinNeeneer holy crap, I don't know if I can but I'll try.
745615632406818816 2016-06-22 13:53:14 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @allnewtpir happy birthday
745615318471540736 2016-06-22 13:51:59 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I also removed all drawings from my Facebook page earlier. They are still on my Instagram, but I won't post them to FB.
745608947629985792 2016-06-22 13:26:40 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I haven't drawn anything in about a year, I think. No wonder I'm stressed out.

744107880488525824 2016-06-18 10:01:58 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @wadsworthdidit yeah, no..
743605992705908742 2016-06-16 00:47:38 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @FearlessRiOT me too
743563784216780800 2016-06-16 21:59:55 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> And I have to send in the laptop to HP, their mandatory update Tuesday killed my hard drive completely.
743431535676776448 2016-06-16 13:14:25 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> STILL refuses to boot into safe mode.
743422087038107648 2016-06-16 12:36:52 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> It wouldn't even boot to safe mode yesterday for me to work on it. I'm going to fix this, I have to. Here goes..
743418889242021888 2016-06-16 12:24:09 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Why do I keep getting HP you ask? They are usually birthday or Christmas gifts.
743418211237003264 2016-06-16 12:21:28 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> The last time I had an HP that was any good was 16 years ago.
743417927987249153 2016-06-16 12:20:20 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> It is honestly making me take a huge hit to the ego and want to retire from fixing computers for good.
743417712345554944 2016-06-16 12:19:29 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> This stupid laptop, that I've had for only a couple months, had a "mandatory update" and crapped out.
743417402382237696 2016-06-16 12:18:15 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> No I'm not doing things I shouldn't be doing. I'm wedding planning, job hunting, and looking at Amazon for gifts for the wedding.
743417096009293825 2016-06-16 12:17:02 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I hate HP. I thought maybe this 2 in 1 would work better than the regular ones, but no. No same thing different laptop.
743204850880618496 2016-06-15 22:13:39 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Ugggggggggh
743099397777543168 2016-06-15 15:14:37 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I knew getting the HP 2 in 1 laptop was a bad idea. I never have any luck with HP. I barely even USE this laptop yet and BOOM blue screen.
743055980468916224 2016-06-15 12:22:05 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Just posted a photo https://www.instagram.com/p/BGrMmfzmCXi/
742911351580962816 2016-06-14 02:47:23 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> And y'all know I'll tell you like it is.
742911247201472512 2016-06-14 02:46:58 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Day 2 of messing about with the new Samsung Galaxy J7.. Still absolutely love this phone! Can't find a single con to tweet.
742910802882113536 2016-06-14 02:45:12 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @SeriousStrange I nearly read that wrong and started to panic! All's well though.
742910605355560960 2016-06-14 02:44:25 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> The chocolate bars will be made into something that I'll take to work and hand out to my team. I share.
742910399096442880 2016-06-14 02:43:36 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I won a full day of pto/uto, a hat, 2 gigantic chocolate bars, a walmart card, subway card, and a drink all for sales in the last 2 days.
742909894030921728 2016-06-14 02:41:35 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I feel like my brain is oozing out my ears. Not even the hat I won today seems to be helping. #StupidPituitaryTumor #massivemigraine
742885076887867392 2016-06-14 01:02:59 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I'll take the high road while you take the low road.
742855740919009280 2016-06-14 23:06:24 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I hate getting ditched at the gym, but at least I did 3 miles.
742602898668916740 2016-06-13 06:21:42 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Another piece of advice; those free tablets you get in store are NOT free. There is always an activation fee and a monthly access fee.
742599817248034816 2016-06-13 06:09:27 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Even the camera is better on the J7.
742599723526295552 2016-06-13 06:09:05 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> You can get the Galaxy S7, but you would be paying about $800 for basically the Gaxaxy S name and higher resolution.
742598891577704448 2016-06-13 06:05:47 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I love this phone. Just got it in the mail today and have zero complaints whatsoever.
742598500341420038 2016-06-13 06:04:13 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Can't sleep, again, so I'm playing setting on my new Samsung Galaxy  J7. I'd say it is their attempt to squash the iphone 6s plus.
742501896884195328 2016-06-13 23:40:21 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @wadsworthdidit and then my team will squish the fish, again.

741678152674594816 2016-06-11 17:07:05 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> The woman that owns the bakery is refusing to make the cake we want for the wedding. Its a simple cake with roses..

735834677982941184 2016-05-26 14:07:13 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @boostmobile getting mixed messages on the cost of a replacement SIM card. Help?
735813035118460928 2016-05-26 12:41:12 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> It doesn't matter if it is orange, red, black, white, or ivory.. As long as I don't show up naked, right?
735812745673773060 2016-05-26 12:40:03 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Agree or disagree; the color of my wedding dress is nobody's business but my own.
735811340548333568 2016-05-26 12:34:28 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> your aunt is really a piece of work. I knew exactly what she was doing when she was questioning us about everything yesterday.

735633070964023300 2016-05-25 00:46:06 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> No, I am not a happy camper right now. I have no cell phone, and probably won't after I take it out of the rice either.
735632497631973377 2016-05-25 00:43:49 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @wadsworthdidit yeah, I know that.

735492511293132801 2016-05-25 15:27:34 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> And I rarely ever watch The View, but when Vanilla Ice was going to be there, I had to.
735492265699840000 2016-05-25 15:26:35 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @TheView @vanillaice @candacecbure LOVED IT!
735454895587889152 2016-05-25 12:58:05 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @SmashDawg That is one thing I always struggle with.

735144911830388736 2016-05-24 16:26:19 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @roadshow @CNET why?! Why do that to a perfectly good muscle car?
734911120327217152 2016-05-23 00:57:19 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @WWEThatsNotPG was someone assaulted by Betty Crocker tonight?
734910488920854528 2016-05-23 00:54:49 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> My grandpa's birthday was yesterday, and  my dad's 60th birthday is today.
734874749071970304 2016-05-23 22:32:48 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> But anyway...
734874204865212416 2016-05-23 22:30:38 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Strong urge to smack you upside your head before you get walked out for work avoidance by your manager.
734873951063670784 2016-05-23 22:29:37 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Because then I get that cold xferred call and have to de-escalate the situation, fix the issue while going deaf, and having to resist the...
734873444001697792 2016-05-23 22:27:36 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> At you and hurt your feelings. Fix the issue and move on. Are they actually IN your face? No. So what's the problem?
734873216473288705 2016-05-23 22:26:42 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> If you work at a call center you will be screamed at, that's life. Don't just cold transfer someone that's screaming...
734872788935278592 2016-05-23 22:25:00 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Have to transfer to retention, or you have a serious phone issue that can't be solved and I've completely run out of options.
734872110779256841 2016-05-23 22:22:19 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I may complain about my boss or some of the crazy things that happen at work, but at least I do my job... I don't transfer calls unless I...

734518847730917376 2016-05-22 22:58:34 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @wadsworthdidit its a software issue that looks like a master reset is the only thing that fixes.
734384687787970561 2016-05-22 14:05:28 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Apparently everyone with a Galaxy Note 5 is having issues today. That's ok, I'm the queen of tech support! #issuesolver #techie

734178542989266944 2016-05-21 00:26:19 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @wadsworthdidit say what?
734159988965441536 2016-05-21 23:12:36 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I don't go to the gym and work so hard I can barely move afterwards for you to tell me I don't work out.
734155973149917184 2016-05-21 22:56:38 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> So I'm Wednesday Addams today. . https://www.instagram.com/p/BFr9WEImCSp/
734148436442943488 2016-05-21 22:26:41 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @wadsworthdidit at least they put up a fight the last game that I saw live was New York versus Tampa and they just didn't care
733981274432536576 2016-05-21 11:22:27 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Mom please stop sending me tiaras and crowns. I'm not going to wear one in the wedding.

733805549473632256 2016-05-20 23:44:11 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Rant over... and yes I did say wiki/google-fu.
733805367025623041 2016-05-20 23:43:27 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Because you look dim when you say indoctrination is when you show respect to military vets or when the national anthem plays.
733804806037463041 2016-05-20 23:41:13 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> You know, that thing we used before people developed Wiki/Google-fu. Maybe then you can use the word correctly.
733804526436790272 2016-05-20 23:40:07 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> How about the next time you try to use a big word like "indoctrination" you crack open that thing we call a dictionary.
733306028545056771 2016-05-19 14:39:16 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Yes! #penguins https://www.instagram.com/p/BFlpHLUmCRa/
733297098104393729 2016-05-19 14:03:46 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @wadsworthdidit no big deal.
733287282258681857 2016-05-19 13:24:46 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @wadsworthdidit I suppose it wouldn't matter mentioning the name now.
733266545879748609 2016-05-19 12:02:22 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @gypsy4bigd yikes!
732907626288271360 2016-05-18 12:16:09 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @wadsworthdidit I didn't mention the name for a reason.
732412238322126848 2016-05-16 03:27:39 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> When someone calls in angry about a $5000 bill because they have insurance claims and international overages its still "push DTV."
732409864547356673 2016-05-16 03:18:13 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> All you see is $$$.
732409424019607552 2016-05-16 03:16:28 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> When did customer service turn into the sales department? Nobody wants DTV and yet it is mandatory on EVERY call that we pester for sales.
732338534997073920 2016-05-16 22:34:47 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I don't like to admit when I'm beat or admit when things get bad enough to break me down, but https://www.instagram.com/p/BFfC3sEGCaQ/

730826786284670978 2016-05-12 18:27:38 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @daisherz365 @RockinNeeneer y'all have DMs
730810965080576000 2016-05-12 17:24:46 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I just spent my last dime trying to put food on the table for my parents. What makes you think I have thousands of dollars around?
730810525475586050 2016-05-12 17:23:01 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Are you INSANE? I don't have $3000 just sitting around somewhere to lose on yet another quack migraine cure that hasn't worked on me before.
730776145633906689 2016-05-12 15:06:24 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @FearlessRiOT She's probably searching her name.
730506618262171648 2016-05-11 21:15:24 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> The manager for my team has been gone for a week. It has been such a great week but she'll be back Friday.

728233690082455557 2016-05-05 14:43:36 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Do doctors just NOT care about insurance and what can be covered before they start prescribing things all Willy nilly? #notpaying2000bucks

690514314466304000 2016-01-22 12:40:16 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Since work is closed due to ice and snow today, I can work on wedding stuff.
689947159999991808 2016-01-20 23:06:36 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @AshleyStAndrews interesting
689944584646955008 2016-01-20 22:56:22 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @AshleyStAndrews Then again when we lived on the farm, we didn't leave any animals outside in the cold. Horses included.
689944452509605889 2016-01-20 22:55:50 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @AshleyStAndrews Ok, my point was to not leave a house pet outside in below freezing weather.
689943599136559105 2016-01-20 22:52:27 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> excuse me, but I would like the water of life please. On the rocks.
689943190288404483 2016-01-20 22:50:49 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @AshleyStAndrews understandable, my husky loves to be in the snow... But I would not leave her out in it all night in below freezing weather
689801450755612672 2016-01-20 13:27:36 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @dierdrereally Should I make it, or buy it this Friday? I do plan to try one or the other.
689794110903943168 2016-01-20 12:58:26 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> I don't think they would like it one bit. Maybe then they would understand.
689793970147299328 2016-01-20 12:57:52 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> How people think it is ok to leave a dog outside over night in snow is beyond me. I'd like to leave them outside like that, naked w/o shoes
689788797081501697 2016-01-20 12:37:19 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> @rockinhardygirl I called, my parents didn't want to get involved but I did. Couldn't let her in the house because of my husky..
689774700642320386 2016-01-20 11:41:18 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Because she was freezing and my neighbor left her out all night in the snow. Poor baby is a sweetheart.
689774379576745984 2016-01-20 11:40:02 UTC <IveGotMoxie85> Went outside earlier to check the street before work, immediately had a pitbull jump on me..
