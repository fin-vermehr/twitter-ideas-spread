950938038640824320 2018-01-09 03:51:10 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Cline is a liability, and still don't like Painter.
950937636138639361 2018-01-09 03:49:34 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> This is hard to watch..
950740934534279170 2018-01-09 14:47:57 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Everything should be based on performance. Imagine putting a white guy on the Jamaican 4x100 track team and expecting them to be better because of diversity..
950569759527047168 2018-01-08 03:27:46 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Big Ten officials hurting Georgia rn..

948016393949151232 2018-01-01 02:21:36 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @ClayTravis You can thank the committee for designing the playoffs for the SEC.. B1G still best conference.
948015707710742529 2018-01-01 02:18:52 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Baker had his chances..still questioning that playcalling down the stretch.
948013348817461248 2018-01-01 02:09:30 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Questioning OK playcalling..
947995743767449601 2018-01-01 00:59:32 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Such a poor game of football being played rn
947977062941413376 2018-01-01 23:45:19 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> I love Baker Mayfield.
947945698347175936 2018-01-01 21:40:41 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Another SEC loss @ClayTravis
947938590264315904 2018-01-01 21:12:26 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Some billionaire needs to bring back the XFL.
947938513705684992 2018-01-01 21:12:08 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Another BS targeting call against @UCF_Football @NCAAFootball rulebook still sucks.
947937988658548736 2018-01-01 21:10:02 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> I hope 90% of America had a resolution involving getting to the gym, cause wow
947926969231998976 2018-01-01 20:26:15 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> It's okay if Michigan is the only team to ruin the B1G perfect bowl season, hope recruits are watching. @NCAAFootball

947559536495349763 2017-12-31 20:06:12 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @ClayTravis Only because the committee hasn't put the B1G in a position to win it all, this year for Example A.
947506901344051201 2017-12-31 16:37:03 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @its_rick24 All that means is MJ wasn't good enough at a young age.
947346480859439105 2017-12-30 05:59:36 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Be selfish, until 25.

812038764017156096 2016-12-22 20:55:02 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Yurack5 @BDye3 It didn't? By rule, it's a foul. Not a suspension.
812038454813007872 2016-12-22 20:53:49 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Yurack5 That is why it's a foul... you're trying to justify a suspension by tripping because it's a hated player. I simply said it was soft
812037844881592320 2016-12-22 20:51:23 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Twitter, a good way to practice restraint.
812037467293544448 2016-12-22 20:49:53 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Yurack5 @WHHogsett Don't all fouls put a player in danger? Lol SOFT.

812036727074385921 2016-12-22 20:46:57 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @WHHogsett @Yurack5 It's a foul. A foul. That's not ignoring anything. That's the penalty. A foul.
812036518151864320 2016-12-22 20:46:07 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Yurack5 Suspend everyone that gets a foul?
812030443872722944 2016-12-22 20:21:59 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @WHHogsett I'm sorry for having an unbiased, objective, logical point of view.
812001709056790528 2016-12-22 18:27:48 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @NateBorders @Grantt2014 @BDye3 Didn't say it shouldn't have been a foul. But a tech, a suspension. Cmon lol
812000930061230080 2016-12-22 18:24:42 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @NateBorders @Grantt2014 @BDye3 Yes. I was also never suspended for tripping someone. Soft. Lol
811992823222403072 2016-12-22 17:52:29 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Grantt2014 I don't care if it was 100..it's a trip Grant, a trip lol
811991729842819072 2016-12-22 17:48:09 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @NateBorders @Grantt2014 He tripped someone 3 times..tripped..suspended for a trip..you've got to be kidding me..shouldn't be a tech either

809499750085066752 2016-12-15 20:45:54 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BDye3 @PDuffyy In all fairness, it hasn't been studied long enough, but it's no different than alcohol or tobacco. Use at your own risk.

808505939347304449 2016-12-12 02:56:51 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @WHHogsett I'm an independent.
808504331569926144 2016-12-12 02:50:28 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BleacherReport @BDye3 I only had two choices and not sure how accurate any of that information is..
808458031407267840 2016-12-12 23:46:29 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Incredible athlete, but a draft dodger..Country gave him a lot, and he didn't step up when needed.https://twitter.com/bleacherreport/status/808453851913170944

808446083026325504 2016-12-12 22:59:01 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @NicholasZepeda @WHHogsett It's not..It's how you define protest..that movement is just a parade for babies..
808439307572826112 2016-12-12 22:32:05 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @NicholasZepeda Protests are for when human rights are violated.
808438541839663107 2016-12-12 22:29:03 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @NicholasZepeda I don't disagree with peaceful protests. Disagree with his opinion and stances on issues he couldn't have time to understand
808429575722201088 2016-12-12 21:53:25 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Outside of basketball, I don't think very highly of @KingJames due to recent events.

805852449923862529 2016-12-05 19:12:50 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> I'll give Jeff Brohm one year before making any judgement..
805552773840465920 2016-12-04 23:22:02 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Quality over quantity.
805532358296403968 2016-12-04 22:00:54 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Added a couple banners to the collection today at Congress.. #HBC #BannersOnTheWall
804790030770339842 2016-12-02 20:51:10 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BDye3 Quick fix for now, hopefully regulation and tax reform come soon.
804788555667148800 2016-12-02 20:45:18 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> I'd much rather people disagree with me because that's the only way I continue to learn more.
804788403111858177 2016-12-02 20:44:42 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BDye3 It all needs decreased across the board, so it's not special treatment even though they are performance-based incentives.
804788174610452481 2016-12-02 20:43:47 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BDye3 If every company brings 16 million for every 7 million, that's fine. I'd rather the economy get money than the government.
804743196903374849 2016-12-02 17:45:04 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @WHHogsett sounded like a woman 5 years ago..

804510909938991104 2016-12-01 02:22:02 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Hello weekend. 
804396082998505472 2016-12-01 18:45:45 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> $7M in tax breaks, BUT $16M invested. Positive $9M if report is accurate. https://twitter.com/jgreendc/status/804360307611172865

804185216021622784 2016-11-30 04:47:51 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Gimpswagg4 Embarrassing first half, and it takes two. Still positive about this year.

804158632447320064 2016-11-30 03:02:13 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> OG is best player on that team, main reason because of the shorts.
804155032941821952 2016-11-30 02:47:54 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Every player on the floor would foul out if they call those on everyone #weak
804154004452372480 2016-11-30 02:43:49 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> That's your excuse for two of UNC Top 3 players with 2 fouls and 10 min left in the first..smh  lol
804153007768301569 2016-11-30 02:39:52 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Just sticking to the facts.. lol
804152666066710528 2016-11-30 02:38:30 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Took Berry outta the game almost as quickly as they took Anthony Davis out...
804149711460593665 2016-11-30 02:26:46 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Good evening of basketball, now time to cheer on #TarHeelNation

803809087549014016 2016-11-29 03:53:15 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @NicholasZepeda I bet it lasts through his Presidency..won't make any bets further because next President could drive all companies away.
803808664637292544 2016-11-29 03:51:34 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> These officials are screwing Michigan State over. @NCAA

803402097064636416 2016-11-28 00:56:01 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @AssociatedPress sees a loss to the defending, undefeated National Champions (Nova) worse than a loss to IPFW...
803329115558465541 2016-11-28 20:06:00 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> When @WHHogsett doesn't know whether it's David or I answering the phone

802623359993446402 2016-11-26 21:21:35 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> If #2 for Bama gets this targeting call, this is why @NCAAFootball is killing the game.
802620997056675840 2016-11-26 21:12:12 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> I'd be on this field just to meet @KingJameshttps://twitter.com/sportscenter/status/802620005733036032

800051422687588352 2016-11-19 19:01:38 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Yurack5 It may not be natural, but it's real. There's a difference.
800050592160813056 2016-11-19 18:58:20 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Yurack5 This is BY FAR the most inaccurate statement you've ever made. @KylieJenner is flawless.
800021265020952576 2016-11-19 17:01:47 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @WHHogsett Last night 
799793641162153984 2016-11-18 01:57:18 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Just watched a high school girl's basketball coach get tossed

796394746965008384 2016-11-09 16:51:18 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> You're smoking crack IF you think there are not as many anti-male, anti-white people out there..Can't focus on the few bad.
796394115541954560 2016-11-09 16:48:48 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> But not going to complain because worked hard and received the offer with my highest priority.
796393967256539136 2016-11-09 16:48:12 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> I was turned down in several interviews because my 'biographical assessment'..they had to hit quotas, so it exists both ways.
796376845767819264 2016-11-09 15:40:10 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> The American Dream is still possible. It can't be taken from you once you achieve it.

796371899609714688 2016-11-09 15:20:31 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @NicholasZepeda Half* this nation is a sad place. & he can't help who votes for him, but looking at his business, he is not those things
796371225958354944 2016-11-09 15:17:50 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @FoxNews @NicholasZepeda I believe you're going to be wrong 4 years from now on your foreign policy comment.
796370976321765376 2016-11-09 15:16:51 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @NicholasZepeda Or I'm just not friends with the racists & sexists..
796370821438705664 2016-11-09 15:16:14 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Watching everyone judge his character not his policies or position. This is so great.
796370327018369024 2016-11-09 15:14:16 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> The racism & sexism from the other side is so real right now. Haven't heard a racist or sexist comment from a supporter.
796369939238125568 2016-11-09 15:12:44 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @WHHogsett Cause that approval rating was a joke.
796369391919239168 2016-11-09 15:10:33 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> This is such a good thing regardless of what you think about their character.https://twitter.com/foxnews/status/796305026633310209
796262781322403840 2016-11-09 08:06:55 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> #USA
796256359280996352 2016-11-08 07:41:24 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Congratulations @realDonaldTrump
796243515651067905 2016-11-08 06:50:22 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> 
796237113389969408 2016-11-08 06:24:55 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Just call it already.
796234438699061249 2016-11-08 06:14:18 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Grantt2014 Nevada taking big steps..and Florida taking small steps
796234099740524545 2016-11-08 06:12:57 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @mlcain13 & our future 1st Lady*
796232842367877120 2016-11-08 06:07:57 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Our 1st Lady though...
796229606554685440 2016-11-08 05:55:06 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> America voted for the builder. Naturally risk averse and bet on the unknown.
796228625410510848 2016-11-08 05:51:12 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Lol @ the polling done & media before the election though..
796223857770332160 2016-11-08 05:32:15 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> I guess it's still not over..
796222694782103552 2016-11-08 05:27:38 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BDye3 I shouldn't judge, but yes I do think that for obvious reasons lol
796222196104499203 2016-11-08 05:25:39 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Grantt2014 So thankful for that though.
796221977279205376 2016-11-08 05:24:47 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BDye3 His character is trash. So was his opponent's. Even though that's God's judgement imo
796221778683133952 2016-11-08 05:23:59 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BDye3 & support Trump so much isn't necessarily true..but I did support him in regards to our two choices.
796221505248051201 2016-11-08 05:22:54 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BDye3 First reason was most important. Many others, but Twitter. Big thing was Clinton was opposite direction. Trump is moderate really..
796221310493982720 2016-11-08 05:22:08 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BDye3 Less business regulation. Lower taxes. Less government spending. (hopefully) More power to states. (hopefully) Stronger military.
796220143890296837 2016-11-08 05:17:30 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> A Republican House & Senate to match would be wonderful along with the possibility of 4 justices...
796215970645811200 2016-11-08 05:00:55 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> President Donald J. Trump...
796214787302629376 2016-11-08 04:56:12 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @WHHogsett The mistake was making Hillary his opponent.
796214026179067904 2016-11-08 04:53:11 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Lol @ Wall Street rn
796212144803115008 2016-11-08 04:45:42 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @WHHogsett Your thoughts right now?
796210862608547841 2016-11-08 04:40:37 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> With Michigan... 
796210746275332096 2016-11-08 04:40:09 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @mlcain13 Ahh gotcha lol
796210277935091712 2016-11-08 04:38:17 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> If this ends the globalization idea, I'm happy. It'll never work when other countries aren't on board.
796209859016454144 2016-11-08 04:36:37 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @mlcain13 Man, it's a speculation bubble waiting to pop..either candidate imo
796209305313742851 2016-11-08 04:34:25 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Grantt2014 Maybe the next president will end that for our country..always hopeful
796208512850333696 2016-11-08 04:31:16 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @WHHogsett This is hugeeehttps://twitter.com/foxnews/status/796208176114896897
796208404729647105 2016-11-08 04:30:51 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @mlcain13 DOW plummets every election..
796207446872178689 2016-11-08 04:27:02 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Gimpswagg4 I will be in shock for awhile lol
796205478204370946 2016-11-08 04:19:13 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @NicholasZepeda Glued like a National Title game lol it's crazy
796204349525491712 2016-11-08 04:14:44 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @NicholasZepeda Yeah, obviously a two candidate race regardless..I respect that
796203365671825408 2016-11-08 04:10:49 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @NicholasZepeda Staying faithful to your team, I like it. Completely up for grabs..
796202129690132480 2016-11-08 04:05:55 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> I haven't been this impressed since looking over Reagan's electoral map..wow lol
796200068223291392 2016-11-08 03:57:43 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
796199985645756416 2016-11-08 03:57:23 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> The movement was real..and I'm shockedhttps://twitter.com/wsj/status/796199755693035520
796198726733799424 2016-11-08 03:52:23 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Grantt2014 Thinking the exact same thing lol
796197750736097280 2016-11-08 03:48:31 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @WHHogsett Easily predicted..never have your money in the market around election time lol
796193513956405253 2016-11-08 03:31:40 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @WHHogsett However that was far more depressing
796193389817528320 2016-11-08 03:31:11 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Chay_z_Hammy Lol I will need Hillary's help in erasing some of my past lol
796191098179821568 2016-11-08 03:22:04 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Chay_z_Hammy This is too funny lol Already have the arguments for both sides lol
796190185054670848 2016-11-08 03:18:27 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Chay_z_Hammy People take things way to seriously..all I do is question
796189967122886656 2016-11-08 03:17:35 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Rush County, maybe. Nationwide, doubtful. I mean look at how well Trump is doing win or lose...lol
796185008717303808 2016-11-08 02:57:53 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @baby_diesel lol
796179663961882624 2016-11-08 02:36:38 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Always amazed
796178622147166208 2016-11-08 02:32:30 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> When news (someone else's opinion) becomes research, there is a problem.
796177919995420672 2016-11-08 02:29:43 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @baby_diesel Me neither, media doesn't qualify as research imo..I'm curious if you actually read their tax plans..my guess is no..
796173861951827968 2016-11-08 02:13:35 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @baby_diesel Where do you do your research? Genuinely curious..
796166512402984960 2016-11-08 01:44:23 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Just remember Freedom of Speech even if it disagrees with you..
796164475829317632 2016-11-08 01:36:17 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Yurack5 Destin came up clutch.. lol
796163729159323648 2016-11-08 01:33:19 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Do people realize Bayh used policy to help companies, then when those companies were fed up with him, he came back to public office...
796162892156596225 2016-11-08 01:30:00 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Gimpswagg4 For sure lol
796161396467703808 2016-11-08 01:24:03 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Gimpswagg4 Pledge?
796159790770769921 2016-11-08 01:17:40 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Florida needs to come up clutch
796157489939095552 2016-11-08 01:08:32 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> This is like watching a championship game imo lol
796151981425524736 2016-11-08 00:46:38 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Looks like Indiana made good decisions across the board so far..if only states governed themselves outside of the military & trade
796146980682690560 2016-11-08 00:26:46 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Going to enjoy this moment while it lasts 
796143023230959616 2016-11-08 00:11:03 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Did our part. Don't think it really matters though.https://twitter.com/foxnews/status/796140554044182528
796112626799575040 2016-11-08 22:10:15 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @MitchellLaird RT
796105281721798656 2016-11-08 21:41:04 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Really just thankful right now for the Norquist Pledge.
796099649287417856 2016-11-08 21:18:41 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Term limits would completely change this joke of a political process. Wrong people always running for public office.
796091066885767168 2016-11-08 20:44:35 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> People have a right to vote, not an obligation or duty to vote.
796060352102469635 2016-11-08 18:42:32 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Still a fan of @RealBenCarson but what can ya do
796055202591895554 2016-11-08 18:22:04 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Don't blame Clinton when businesses continue to move overseas & replace your jobs with technology & immigrants, blame her voters.
796054079743074304 2016-11-08 18:17:37 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Still love ya lol
796052162057007104 2016-11-08 18:10:00 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Grantt2014 I'm really happy about my state taxes being lower. Lol
796051699332947968 2016-11-08 18:08:09 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Grantt2014 For the most part, yes. But I can say, I didn't write him in on my ballot..it'll be okay though.
796050197868642305 2016-11-08 18:02:11 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Grantt2014 We got the opposite lol
796049782494076928 2016-11-08 18:00:32 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Grantt2014 That's the real problem.
796049093583781888 2016-11-08 17:57:48 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Grantt2014 Lol I love this.
796048943486353408 2016-11-08 17:57:12 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Grantt2014 Because economics drives everything..but I will say my position of completely privatizing education has changed.
796048029010763776 2016-11-08 17:53:34 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Grantt2014 I understand that there is a problem there..but also disagree with John Gregg being the answer, solve 1 problem to create 5 more
796047306931978240 2016-11-08 17:50:42 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Grantt2014 I've gone to nothing but public schools my whole life, and I believe I have an exceptional education compared to my Purdue class
796046959937196032 2016-11-08 17:49:19 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Grantt2014 Talk about operating in the red..that's your definition of spending out of control
796046794836811780 2016-11-08 17:48:40 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Grantt2014 Lol Is this a joke? Needless to say, if John Gregg wins, it'll only make my move to Ohio this spring that much sweeter..
795853637868199936 2016-11-07 05:01:08 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> #VoteTrumpPence16
795839119821828100 2016-11-07 04:03:26 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> What great "change" we experienced the last 8 years lol #countrydividedhttps://twitter.com/foxnews/status/795825093511413761
795445142832484352 2016-11-06 01:57:55 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @realDonaldTrump Crowds of Clinton don't even compete..really makes you question polls and voting..already believe it's out of our control
795436187280375808 2016-11-06 01:22:20 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Carrie Underwood doesn't age.

795416800464957440 2016-11-06 00:05:18 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @WHHogsett Packers, Rodgers lol
795385614677970944 2016-11-06 22:01:22 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Really not a big fan of Andrew..
795371342799499265 2016-11-06 21:04:40 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Is this real?https://twitter.com/foxbusiness/status/795369275796033536

795104633370898436 2016-11-05 03:24:51 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Ohio State is still the best team in college football  imo

794387489876283393 2016-11-03 03:55:11 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> This OKC game is pretty entertaining though..Westbrook, clearly best player on the floor..GS far better team

789279692167733248 2016-10-20 01:38:37 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> The concept of hard work and living within your means seems so foreign to so many.
789222270682161152 2016-10-20 21:50:27 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Chay_z_Hammy However, 1 person can ruin it with 3 Supreme Court appointments.

788928943801769987 2016-10-19 02:24:52 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> The fact Hillary will even get 1 vote is what's wrong with America..and that vote actually thinks she will help him/her..
788927642514755584 2016-10-19 02:19:42 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> How is a man that believes in partnerships and allies the most dangerous to run for President??
788926879822516225 2016-10-19 02:16:40 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> I don't understand what Hillary finds to be so funny about serious issues..
788925604523638784 2016-10-19 02:11:36 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> If you don't believe voter fraud is real or if you don't believe people have the computer skill to hack into voting systems, you're ignorant

784210968393949184 2016-10-06 01:57:19 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Voting for Trump is obviously strictly a policy decision and is not influenced by his words or personality.

782747174685794305 2016-10-02 01:00:43 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @danmericaCNN @BI_contributors I know..it's embarrassing..don't want to discuss it lol
782623676915077121 2016-10-02 16:49:59 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> The Colts..smh..really not even convinced by Andrew Luck yet either..
782424033186938880 2016-10-01 03:36:40 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Louisville tho...
782423676113256448 2016-10-01 03:35:15 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> lol
782382208862617601 2016-10-01 00:50:29 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> TBH Gehrig's place is pretty much a trap house...
782364534183002112 2016-10-01 23:40:15 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> College is crazy
781678683765563392 2016-09-29 02:14:55 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Visiting B-Town this weekend, need prayers
781678080649756672 2016-09-29 02:12:31 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Yet to make the news, but son-in-law (hedge fund manager) made tons of money on bond trading with EU bailout due to her insider info..
781677563320135680 2016-09-29 02:10:28 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Hillary's resume would lead to unemployment for the average citizen after she got out of jail, which I still think is coming..
781662819305619456 2016-09-29 01:11:53 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Hoping to catch my big break next Thursday...
781662753962459136 2016-09-29 01:11:37 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Bird can't fly in a cage
781316403752206337 2016-09-28 02:15:21 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> May be the only one excited about Disney moving into live-action remakes..
781251377867599873 2016-09-28 21:56:58 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Chay_z_Hammy & That's literally all the FASFA is.
781245952053030912 2016-09-28 21:35:24 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Chay_z_Hammy Preach lol
781245568957886464 2016-09-28 21:33:53 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Chay_z_Hammy Even if your parents were rich, what if they decide they aren't paying any and their child (over 18) is on their own?
781243553670242304 2016-09-28 21:25:52 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Chay_z_Hammy & I agree. The only "fair" thing to do is help EVERYONE on education no matter what class, & that's not what's going on.
781242024406024193 2016-09-28 21:19:48 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Chay_z_Hammy Because you'll make millions as a physical therapist...that's like saying why should anyone pay you for your help? Lol
780960435453497344 2016-09-27 02:40:52 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Learned about an issue today that absolutely blew my mind, and there's nothing to be done about it..
780856191920566272 2016-09-27 19:46:38 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Gimpswagg4 Lol Yeah, we can't all have the privilege of attending Purdue... lol
780795564334211072 2016-09-27 15:45:43 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @mlcain13 There is nothing that says anyone is worth anything but what someone else is willing to pay.
780795354673545216 2016-09-27 15:44:53 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @mlcain13 The top 1% have the highest demanded skills abilities and knowledge. Not all skills abilities and knowledge are equal.
780789574607970304 2016-09-27 15:21:55 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Can't stand the wealth gap complaint..develop knowledge, skills, and abilities & work hard..something only 1% of the population does.
780787292512382980 2016-09-27 15:12:51 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> It's so obvious to tell the difference in someone voting for Trump and someone voting for Hillary.. lol
780616839953059840 2016-09-26 03:55:32 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Climate change and global warming are two very different things.
780610528058171393 2016-09-26 03:30:27 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> The one good thing about Hillary is the fact you can control her with money..
780603808170778624 2016-09-26 03:03:45 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BDye3 your creditor also assumes your default risk when lending the money
780601324668850177 2016-09-26 02:53:53 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BDye3 your business is separate from you as an owner, for the same reason his employees aren't forced to repay the debt
780601058246656002 2016-09-26 02:52:49 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BDye3 Wasn't trying to, just meant for that to say too complicated to explain through Twitter lol
780599813536620544 2016-09-26 02:47:53 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> For the record, voting for Trump because there are only two real options, and CANNOT stand Hillary or her ideas.
780599444307906561 2016-09-26 02:46:25 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BDye3 different business, way more complicated than you know
780598613856706560 2016-09-26 02:43:07 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BDye3 No actually they don't..in most cases as the creditor, you're just out the money you lended..there is no repayment
780596803641151489 2016-09-26 02:35:55 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BDye3 @Grantt2014 Cause there are certain times where it can be used as a very positive thing for a business owner lol
780596657985613824 2016-09-26 02:35:20 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BDye3 Please explain how he is using the government's money?? The government has no money.
780595914880782336 2016-09-26 02:32:23 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BDye3 If you knew anything about business and bankruptcy, you would know that plays to your advantage
780584642743300096 2016-09-26 01:47:36 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Just remember, Hillary buys $12,000 jackets with taxpayer money and Trump buys everything with HIS money..
780572646861864960 2016-09-26 00:59:56 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> Let it begin..
780219167945400320 2016-09-25 01:35:20 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @BoilerFootball needs to sign him immediately.https://twitter.com/sportscenter/status/780148326939430912

779766976499580928 2016-09-24 19:38:29 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @Grantt2014 Cuban got lucky..basically gambling w/ Yahoo
779167122605891584 2016-09-22 03:54:52 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> @NicholasZepeda Makes you think everyone's doomed just hearing all of it..lol
779016999531900928 2016-09-22 17:58:20 UTC <RealMatthewFogg> They want more than half of what you earned after they took half while you earned it?? Makes so much sense lolhttps://twitter.com/wsj/status/779010140783738880
