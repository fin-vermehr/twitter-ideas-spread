966886434387894274 2018-02-22 04:04:24 UTC <hoagy114> @davidhogg111 Mental Health issues is what you should be talking about. The failure of Law Enforcement in Broward County is what you should be talking about. But Im sure that is not what you are being told to talk...grow a pair.
966884950212452353 2018-02-22 03:58:30 UTC <hoagy114> @SandraTXAS @TheLastRefuge2 Very scary, politics doe not belong in police work!
966881847522205697 2018-02-22 03:46:10 UTC <hoagy114> @CWBChicago Well he was just trying to make a point....
966874301378031617 2018-02-22 03:16:11 UTC <hoagy114> @browardsheriff the resignation of the Sheriff should happen immediately. He failed to protect those kids along with his political agenda. Using children for his political gain is irresponsible. Too bad he is not a real cop.

966788282188206081 2018-02-22 21:34:23 UTC <hoagy114> @OFA_NV No we need to change HIPPA, so we can determine the mental health of people.
966784952590356482 2018-02-22 21:21:09 UTC <hoagy114> I would guess most of us could come up with reasonable steps for mental health checks with gun sales. But HIPPA & all the alphabet agencies dont play in the sandbox well.

955513903517085696 2018-01-22 18:54:01 UTC <hoagy114> @MoveOn @SenWarren New laws would be FANTASTIC! Lets start with term limits!

954230744859070464 2018-01-18 05:55:12 UTC <hoagy114> @SenFeinstein Perhaps you are correct, please release the FISA memo so we the people can see for ourselves what the hell is going on.

Dreamers need to follow the law like so many others did to become American citizens. Morons in Congress are not gods, like they believe they are. Term limits are needed to keep the balance in check.
953776014223536129 2018-01-17 23:48:16 UTC <hoagy114> @GunOfBavaria It was great show, Jack Webb had a vision and did a lot for public service professions.

To speak to anyone like that especially a Cabinet Member shows total disrespect for the other party. It is grand standing and bad dramatics, this guys needs to step back or anger management classes.
953664353747660800 2018-01-17 16:24:34 UTC <hoagy114> @SuburbanFiveOh @vexedinthecity Government can save Social Security by doing one simple thing. They need to remove the cap. That will allow millions of dollars to flow into the program. However anyone who makes over $200k a year is opposed to allowing this to happen.

953392735792189441 2018-01-16 22:25:16 UTC <hoagy114> @craigbucheit @NonyMouse66 @SteveBellow @rcjparry @CaptMurca @LouHayesJr You are correct, Police need tools to help them do their job. It is not about being a military force, it is about controlling situations & doing the job they want us to do.
953390087215001601 2018-01-16 22:14:44 UTC <hoagy114> @craigbucheit @NonyMouse66 @SteveBellow @rcjparry @CaptMurca @LouHayesJr Lou, great article. I used to butt heads with some of SWAT guys. There is a balance, some guys will never get it. I never understood following Grossman religiously.
953329921048195072 2018-01-16 18:15:39 UTC <hoagy114> @SethMacFarlane Blaming Trump is a stretch, Congress hasnt done anything. His parents should have encouraged him to become a legal citizen. He had 30 years to do so.
953319547733393408 2018-01-16 17:34:26 UTC <hoagy114> @MNPDNashville Good luck to each of you. Remember to stay safe & get home every night. It can be a very rewarding career.
953129055489900544 2018-01-15 04:57:29 UTC <hoagy114> @Jaceved2 @Chicago_Scanner @EricTendian @OT_Enthusiast @WindyCityWxMan @abluecanary P2P was used quite a bit before other technology took over. You could confirm warrants, get background / contact information from other agencies. After the warrant info was done the ole Type 3 message used to confirm. It was a great system in the  70s  & 80s.
953114409777295361 2018-01-15 03:59:17 UTC <hoagy114> @PoliceOne ALICE training is not the end all. Schools need to balance each school with the capability and maturity of the staff & more importantly the students before implementing this program.
953037726542045184 2018-01-15 22:54:35 UTC <hoagy114> @Chief_KZiman Unfortunately tattoos can be misinterpreted, that could cause problems for the agency.
953028445054758912 2018-01-15 22:17:42 UTC <hoagy114> @ReneeCarrollAZ @ABPatriotWriter When is America gonna wake up, Durban, BHO, Emanuel they are all about doing it the Chicago way, from the first Daley.  Screw everyone make $ & more power.
953025326573019136 2018-01-15 22:05:18 UTC <hoagy114> @GunOfBavaria Police work at its best....in the office!

952359474416635905 2018-01-13 01:59:27 UTC <hoagy114> @EmersenLee Correct, but that doesnt stop some nit wit from making a mistake.
952357471238180865 2018-01-13 01:51:29 UTC <hoagy114> @EmersenLee No, that is probably incorrect. You want it where they are staffed 24 hrs a day. Think of it as a Tornado siren it should take at least 2 steps to activate. Politicians dont want to take responsibility.
952356623065886721 2018-01-13 01:48:07 UTC <hoagy114> @BaldInKevlar I think that would be a stretch.
952318143967342592 2018-01-13 23:15:13 UTC <hoagy114> @BaldInKevlar And of course they dropped a dime on you as well.
952306635036270592 2018-01-13 22:29:29 UTC <hoagy114> @FoxNews It is called low bid. Im sure they were trying to save money.
952302842840100864 2018-01-13 22:14:25 UTC <hoagy114> @CWBChicago @abluecanary Another liberal lawyer joining the large pool of scum trying for the A.G.s spot. Lisa will announce her candidacy for Governor & Daddy will probably retire when she is elected.

950574382287437825 2018-01-08 03:46:08 UTC <hoagy114> @timkaine A couple of years is one thing a lifetime is another.
950570274394484736 2018-01-08 03:29:48 UTC <hoagy114> @McNutty116 It is same story anywhere you, politics doesnt belong in police work!
950569711959289856 2018-01-08 03:27:34 UTC <hoagy114> @McNutty116 Your Chief is obviously a political hack and never worked the street.
950568640293715969 2018-01-08 03:23:19 UTC <hoagy114> @McNutty116 If you have a union they need to step up, Officer Saftey has to be addressed. That is real issue.
950567712316469257 2018-01-08 03:19:37 UTC <hoagy114> @McNutty116 That is completely unacceptable, Im thinking the other channels may not have the same coverage.
950564342369370112 2018-01-08 03:06:14 UTC <hoagy114> @repblumenauer No one cares.
950431280209870848 2018-01-08 18:17:30 UTC <hoagy114> @nbc This is why no one trusts you or believes anything that you report. Integrity is something that you lost & it would take a miracle to get it back.
950421895572201472 2018-01-08 17:40:12 UTC <hoagy114> @amelia_karras @texashabanero Time to sue the town and the judge after an appeal.

950050915817472006 2018-01-07 17:06:04 UTC <hoagy114> @TxAgSheepdog Unfortunately, they can play with the numbers for crime reporting. That said we all hope that all the PDs are doing the right thing & staying out of politics.
949703252832120833 2018-01-06 18:04:34 UTC <hoagy114> Been @chimidway waiting for @SouthwestAir for 5 hrs now trying to get to Oakland. Crazy how the East coast storms have caused the country to almost stop.

949467934451290112 2018-01-05 02:29:30 UTC <hoagy114> @brianstelter Journalists do you know what that@means? Apparently not because no one I America has seen it for many years. Try a real career. Sanitation disposal removal is looking for help.
949459758888685574 2018-01-05 01:57:01 UTC <hoagy114> @KamalaHarris How about you take care of our homeless veterans first? Why do you want to give our money away to foreigners?

949445873448177665 2018-01-05 01:01:50 UTC <hoagy114> @SpecialKMB1969 This is so they dont have to report on the liberals throwing temper tantrums everywhere...because they arent playing fair....how dare they? Wait until their messiah BHO starts to fall, shits gonna get real.
949444876013359106 2018-01-05 00:57:52 UTC <hoagy114> @FoxNews @ChrisCoon4 In other words Robert Kennedys son?

949436448855482368 2018-01-05 00:24:23 UTC <hoagy114> @COSenDem How has it impacted traffic crashes? What about arrests for impaired driving?  What about overall crime rates?
949134326876332032 2018-01-04 04:23:52 UTC <hoagy114> @keithellison So if I understand you, you are saying this only affects brown & black people?
949132993523838977 2018-01-04 04:18:34 UTC <hoagy114> @RepMaloney People want accurate numbers including who is a citizen and who is not. Stop pissing away our money on your causes!
949122141366226944 2018-01-04 03:35:26 UTC <hoagy114> @GunOfBavaria The good news is the next two shifts can wash & wax that truck. They do know how to cook though.

948980967573721088 2018-01-04 18:14:28 UTC <hoagy114> @Eliza_4_God @nowthisnews And it should be the same for there drivers license.

948962386790281216 2018-01-04 17:00:38 UTC <hoagy114> @PoliticalShort The amount of money and jobs they rely upon from the Federal government would bankrupt them. Look at the military bases alone.

948793794509594624 2018-01-03 05:50:43 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary I would be shocked if not for the fact that all of these people are probably CPS students at one point.... wait so am I!

948423452389707776 2018-01-02 05:19:06 UTC <hoagy114> @timkaine Now North Korea wants to open communication with the South, huh....maybe Trump not backing down helped push this?

947306086897475584 2017-12-30 03:19:05 UTC <hoagy114> @BlueLineRookie FTO is one of the most important jobs in LE. You influence & train the next generation. A great FTO also learns how to supervise others.
947303595355013121 2017-12-30 03:09:11 UTC <hoagy114> @realDonaldTrump @BarbraStreisand I laughed at how people who paid huge money @ ur concerts walked out & yelled at you when you started talking politics. They dont care what you think think!

945698071102574592 2017-12-26 16:49:25 UTC <hoagy114> @SamsungMobile @Apple @RamblinRay890 Im thinking that Consumer Cellular might be the way to go. They dont need to shove everything down our throats.
945456785137307649 2017-12-25 00:50:37 UTC <hoagy114> @HillaryClinton Please just go away and enjoy what little time left you have with your family. Prison maybe sooner than you think.
945455705707941888 2017-12-25 00:46:20 UTC <hoagy114> @RealJamesWoods It shows their ignorance towards anything that they oppose.
945454100686270464 2017-12-25 00:39:57 UTC <hoagy114> @JoeNBC BHO that POS never supported police and condoned the killing of Law Enforcement.

944751861839663104 2017-12-23 02:09:31 UTC <hoagy114> @BlairImani Many police departments are hiring, I suggest you give it a try before you criticize from behind your keyboard. Hindsight is 20/20 why dont you get some skin in the game?
944610318822584320 2017-12-23 16:47:04 UTC <hoagy114> @ACLU Apparently you have never dealt with a mentality ill person who is agitated or enraged, because the mental health people call the police when they need help as well.
944400238999154688 2017-12-22 02:52:17 UTC <hoagy114> @RookieCityCop Good for Sarge, remember where you came from.....
944399967891984386 2017-12-22 02:51:13 UTC <hoagy114> @ShenanigansFL I like it when an Officer tries to stop an unmarked vehicle and they ignore them...that will start a shit storm.

943327325097259009 2017-12-19 03:48:55 UTC <hoagy114> @WBBMNewsradio Another reliable source, Chicago politics is so damn corrupt.
943325600936333312 2017-12-19 03:42:04 UTC <hoagy114> @repjohnlewis Why is your district in such shambles? What have you done to help them when you had your President? What did you do about gun control when your party had complete control?  Time to retire Johnny!
943315745215217666 2017-12-19 03:02:54 UTC <hoagy114> @BlueLineRookie @historyinflicks Absolutely!
943160453043286017 2017-12-19 16:45:49 UTC <hoagy114> @MMFlint Mike, please Buddy work with me here, what about these teenage girls who claim you touched them? Why dont you address this? Your silence is deafening yet you can criticize everything else. Lets start at home and answer the questions.

942904777062612993 2017-12-18 23:49:51 UTC <hoagy114> @SenSanders They should live with you in one of your luxury homes, or they can come in to this country like my relatives did.
942897868846878720 2017-12-18 23:22:24 UTC <hoagy114> @TheTrumpLady @bbusa617 Because we dont have term limits!
942897000948862976 2017-12-18 23:18:57 UTC <hoagy114> @ABC7Chicago How is this news? I dont understand, nobody cares, yet you are taking time to tell us this crap. There is a lot more going on in the world that is more important. Please hire real journalists I think we deserve better.
942840115403030534 2017-12-18 19:32:55 UTC <hoagy114> @Suntimes @OT_Enthusiast @SouthSideWeekly Yet, if you are a friend of Rahms on this committee you probably made some good $$ for doing nothing, the Chicago way.
942640266275643393 2017-12-17 06:18:47 UTC <hoagy114> @NYGovCuomo You Sir, need better legal advice
942639905624264704 2017-12-17 06:17:21 UTC <hoagy114> @DanielsOfficer @BenGaines7 Perhaps you should get a real life...
942626866552299521 2017-12-17 05:25:32 UTC <hoagy114> @realDonaldTrump @TomSteyer I dont think there are grounds for that yet? Did I miss something?

942512000877375493 2017-12-17 21:49:06 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary It was but why was my 1st thought, why are you taking a picture instead of putting out the fire? Thats why Im not a fireman.
942232804842188800 2017-12-16 03:19:41 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary Really, Im surprised Rahm hasnt tried already, you know he really cares.....LOL sometimes I crack myself up.

942202208472485888 2017-12-16 01:18:06 UTC <hoagy114> @OfficerMorton Apparently he is studying law in another country. What a lunatic, must be a liberal Democratic!

942196503988367363 2017-12-16 00:55:26 UTC <hoagy114> @thephillyglobe Wait, Twitter is censoring people? Those sickos!
941813257920061440 2017-12-15 23:32:33 UTC <hoagy114> This is absolutely insane, the politics has gotten out of control. Tell me how I can protect my business?
941812582033133569 2017-12-15 23:29:52 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary It shows that as a friend(s) of the Mayor you can get paid pretty god damn well for doing very little.
941810620223164417 2017-12-15 23:22:04 UTC <hoagy114> @_mrsdemeanor In my old unit casual dress was considered dressed up.
941807694087892992 2017-12-15 23:10:26 UTC <hoagy114> @bgood12345 Another reason why we need TERM LIMITS!
941807232248942592 2017-12-15 23:08:36 UTC <hoagy114> @MilwaukeePolice By the looks of this picture, the Chief should consider retirement, get some new blood in there!
941805335014264832 2017-12-15 23:01:04 UTC <hoagy114> @chicagotribune @BillRuthhart Too bad, because the reality is that had he not tried to attack police she would still be alive.
941804464553504770 2017-12-15 22:57:36 UTC <hoagy114> @MMFlint Mike, if you wont address the statements by the teenage girls against you or what you have done to help Flint, Michigan, could you find jobs for the people who would be out of work making the guns? Do you know how many of these people were actually killed by NRA members?
941798538291372033 2017-12-15 22:34:03 UTC <hoagy114> @EricCarstensen Pretty bad......Oh the sweater ?

940670082707058690 2017-12-12 19:49:59 UTC <hoagy114> @DonutOperator People like that are the first ones to call 9-1-1 for help. They hide behind their keyboards because it makes them feel important.

939212981698785280 2017-12-08 19:19:59 UTC <hoagy114> @MMFlint Mike, still waiting on your comments about the underaged girls who said you assaulted them. You have been very quiet about that....
938906519726428160 2017-12-07 23:02:12 UTC <hoagy114> @WGNNews @MarkSuppelsa Enjoy your retirement Mark.

938886937561223170 2017-12-07 21:44:24 UTC <hoagy114> @RepAlGreen @SecondWalk @PrimRoZLane There is no such things as high crimes unless you look at treason, I dont see it, misdemeanors can mean anything, but I dont see anything specific.
938866740280397825 2017-12-07 20:24:08 UTC <hoagy114> @adv_project Perhaps you should take job as a police officer and see what is actually happening in the world, instead of hiding behind a keyboard & with screwed up ideas?
938864545417875457 2017-12-07 20:15:25 UTC <hoagy114> @SenFranken @cspan He must need to get a better pension number or hope it all blows over.

938420253272535040 2017-12-06 14:49:58 UTC <hoagy114> @ShenanigansFL Emailed subpoenas? That is crazy!
938414160421048320 2017-12-06 14:25:45 UTC <hoagy114> @USATODAY @dworakt This is sad, his agency should get him help & put him on disability. This stems from an on duty issue.
938410336008462338 2017-12-06 14:10:33 UTC <hoagy114> @Door_Kicker1032 Nice, now get your shit shined

938398643115216896 2017-12-06 13:24:05 UTC <hoagy114> @OfficialLivePD @DixonPolice @ladyhawk9326 That would be soooooo boring.
938396166466736130 2017-12-06 13:14:15 UTC <hoagy114> @BlondeinKevlar Captains & Majors was the call at a restaurant? Talk about a rank heavy department ....
938202397054263296 2017-12-05 00:24:17 UTC <hoagy114> @greeneyedbecky @westland_will No money for schools and bad salaries for teachers are a large part of the problem.

938167038379520001 2017-12-05 22:03:46 UTC <hoagy114> @FoxNews Typical Democratic, entitlement like when families pass the same public housing unit down by the generation.
937722575702118400 2017-12-04 16:37:38 UTC <hoagy114> @realDonaldTrump @TomFitton Im sure it would be BHO hold overs.

937561755471040512 2017-12-03 05:58:36 UTC <hoagy114> @Door_Kicker1032 In Illinois, that would mean 10 cents is your bond...

937103596839231488 2017-12-02 23:38:02 UTC <hoagy114> @MMFlint What about those girls who claim you were inappropriate with them...is this true?
937096115752787969 2017-12-02 23:08:19 UTC <hoagy114> @PDRiverside Cool, gangs at play in Riverside....who wooda tunk it?
937090414590484480 2017-12-02 22:45:39 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary Wow, Crook County you have to shake your head. That States Attorney is a joke.
937089925316579329 2017-12-02 22:43:43 UTC <hoagy114> @RamblinRay890 Why, people need to take responsibility for their (& pets) actions.
936837429918494720 2017-12-01 06:00:23 UTC <hoagy114> @511Tactical That does not look organized, it looks like a bunch of bs bags.

936281149298626561 2017-11-30 17:09:55 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary This smells bad, my money is on the boyfriend.
935899089891405824 2017-11-29 15:51:45 UTC <hoagy114> @TODAYshow I hope you actual physical evidence and a confession of this incident. Sexual abuse is wrong, but someone with a grudge could create a firestorm of problems because of false accusations.
935613381335306241 2017-11-28 20:56:27 UTC <hoagy114> Well, I suppose we will find the Skeltons in his closet as this begins to unfold.http://abc7chicago.com/politics/rep-luis-gutierrez-not-running-for-re-election-endorses-chuy-garcia/2706378/

Maybe they dont want to work the crazy hours or have to make split second decisions. Or maybe they are whining complains, millionaire cry babies @NFL . I wish I worked 16 days a year and was paid millions.
935608385755648000 2017-11-28 20:36:36 UTC <hoagy114> @TxAgSheepdog Nice, any moving targets? Any lateral movement on your part during the shoot?
934980632047955969 2017-11-26 03:02:08 UTC <hoagy114> @dmihalopoulos That is funny, p9litics comes back to bite him in the ass.....way too funny!
934979211072364545 2017-11-26 02:56:29 UTC <hoagy114> @RepJohnConyers Sir, you need to retire, take your massive pension & health care benefits, them head to Detroit and try to some real good.
934967824451276801 2017-11-26 02:11:14 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary That is funny and very scary.
934966420248678400 2017-11-26 02:05:40 UTC <hoagy114> @GunOfBavaria Is that because everyone is trying to get to Climax?
934594953996570624 2017-11-25 01:29:35 UTC <hoagy114> @RookieCityCop @SuburbanFiveOh Its probably the state, I used to administer these programs.
934588844346937344 2017-11-25 01:05:18 UTC <hoagy114> @RealRonHoward So sorry for your loss.
934512082711666693 2017-11-25 20:00:17 UTC <hoagy114> @NIVIsa4031 @AmericanHotLips Obviously the sanity of marriage is not in his church.
934509667065221121 2017-11-25 19:50:41 UTC <hoagy114> @Code9Project Im sure the cost of that program is beyond anything that is sustainable. Also what happens if they do not meet the standard. The longer someone is on the job, the tarnished they can become.
934479253252526080 2017-11-25 17:49:50 UTC <hoagy114> @MikeEmanuelFox @RepJohnConyers @FoxNews How much would his pension be if he resigns? I assume he will have platinum health care for the rest of his life.
934477449794150400 2017-11-25 17:42:40 UTC <hoagy114> @privateofficer Yep, political cronies maybe.....
934476210066919425 2017-11-25 17:37:44 UTC <hoagy114> @greg_doucette @DrRocketScience If finding clients for criminal defense is difficult perhaps they are practice law in the mountains.
934464045251551232 2017-11-25 16:49:24 UTC <hoagy114> @rashadrobinson @Lezbeyin You gotta start somewhere, if these so called men have so much courage lets see them do the job of policing.
934463706033000449 2017-11-25 16:48:03 UTC <hoagy114> @greg_doucette @DrRocketScience Defense attorneys, like civil attorneys will do whatever they need to for a buck.
934463324007346176 2017-11-25 16:46:32 UTC <hoagy114> @BlondeinKevlar Love can happen anytime.

934284722641031168 2017-11-24 04:56:50 UTC <hoagy114> @SuburbanFiveOh Actually that number comes from the IDOT liaison who administered the program for the State. Which Is usually inflated from the numbers the Feds say they want.
934283460755251200 2017-11-24 04:51:49 UTC <hoagy114> @blue_by_design Pleasuring himself.
934282776630714368 2017-11-24 04:49:06 UTC <hoagy114> @greg_doucette Defense attorneys do chase ambulances, and that is just wrong.
934282379497295872 2017-11-24 04:47:32 UTC <hoagy114> @CWBChicago @Academy911 Probably, the the moron Cook County S/A is he one doing all this...she is a piece of crap!
934171410192355328 2017-11-24 21:26:34 UTC <hoagy114> @FirehouseNews And yet it all looks the same.
934170038831075333 2017-11-24 21:21:07 UTC <hoagy114> @Eminem @FoxNews Thats because he is an idiot no cares about this fool.
934167626200338433 2017-11-24 21:11:32 UTC <hoagy114> @Conservative_VW Term limits are needed. Just another crook in the Democratic Party.

934125444315664384 2017-11-24 18:23:55 UTC <hoagy114> @rashadrobinson Another set of police killings, perhaps the millionaire cry babies should try a real job. Police agencies around the country are hiring.
934124934208675841 2017-11-24 18:21:54 UTC <hoagy114> @BeanTownCop Until the check comes in.
934123865252524034 2017-11-24 18:17:39 UTC <hoagy114> @911disbitch Then after lunch you take a nap.
934082393446772736 2017-11-24 15:32:51 UTC <hoagy114> @OT_Enthusiast @SenSanders @UsaPride1959 People with salaries over $160k pay the same as everyone else then they stop paying annually. Image the revenue from pro sports people alone into the system?
934081920241160194 2017-11-24 15:30:58 UTC <hoagy114> @OT_Enthusiast @SenSanders @UsaPride1959 No the cap means that anyone once they paid on $160,000 in salary, they no long pay into SS, Medicare, etc until next year. People who make big & usually pay a small amount in the beginning of the year.
933884510986473472 2017-11-23 02:26:32 UTC <hoagy114> @OT_Enthusiast @SenSanders Bernie, why dont you propose to eliminate the cap on Social Security contributions. That would ensure money for the system for generations?
933765811789008896 2017-11-23 18:34:52 UTC <hoagy114> @GoodCopStories @FLSheriffs @GoodNewsCops @PolicingNews @NationalSheriff @jsosheriff @propacop @BlueWalkPoconos @JSOPIO See what happens when you piss off family members!

933383426228572163 2017-11-22 17:15:24 UTC <hoagy114> @SenFeinstein Could we take care of our own first please? A large portion of homeless in Cal. are veterans. Why dont we start there?

931576067403415552 2017-11-17 17:33:36 UTC <hoagy114> @Conservative_VW No Im thinking a pleasure rail.

931570565982425089 2017-11-17 17:11:45 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary Wait the cold weather hasnt even really started yet!
931552491946369025 2017-11-17 15:59:56 UTC <hoagy114> @greta Greta, this would be something great for you to investigate. The MSM wont even acknowledge this subject.
931551905289048071 2017-11-17 15:57:36 UTC <hoagy114> @HillaryClinton How much will that cost?
931356412931985408 2017-11-16 03:00:47 UTC <hoagy114> @nypost If it bleeds it leads...really cant wait for them to clean it up ?
931354991041884160 2017-11-16 02:55:08 UTC <hoagy114> @brithume @steph93065 @Sangria1992 Perhaps a FOIA is in order.
931351545484017664 2017-11-16 02:41:26 UTC <hoagy114> @JudicialWatch Thank you for all the work that you guys do.
931345914349936645 2017-11-16 02:19:04 UTC <hoagy114> @JGilliam_SEAL @NYPDChiefofDept @davidwebbshow @DETECTIVE4LIFE That is huge mistake. Officer saftey 101, we search for our protection. Whats next no weapons?
931340234473771008 2017-11-16 01:56:30 UTC <hoagy114> @BlueSea1964 Well, if they get enough dirt then, she could bring down BHO. Now that would interesting.
931339543273508865 2017-11-16 01:53:45 UTC <hoagy114> @SpecialKMB1969 @JudicialWatch @ChicagoMayor still has a lot more influence than most people think. His hands are still in this this.
931337396851036160 2017-11-16 01:45:13 UTC <hoagy114> @SIRIUSXM @Door_Kicker1032 Perhaps he negotiated a little better?
931335105364213761 2017-11-16 01:36:07 UTC <hoagy114> @dbongino New trial with a jury that has brains might be a start.
931333116593168384 2017-11-16 01:28:12 UTC <hoagy114> @SenJohnMcCain You Sir, need to retire, you are literally dying and probably having mental health issues due to your condition. You should also be on Obamas care.
931291799041331202 2017-11-16 22:44:02 UTC <hoagy114> @ABC7Chicago why didnt you mention that the New York Senator who was on trial was on trial for his sexual exploits?
931000775643488256 2017-11-15 03:27:36 UTC <hoagy114> @Skilling Tom, you deserve your own show before Pat.
930997837038604288 2017-11-15 03:15:56 UTC <hoagy114> They are smokin now!
930984716907483136 2017-11-15 02:23:48 UTC <hoagy114> @Door_Kicker1032 Because the media is completely out of control....fucking cry babies, like the NFL players.
930624569827778560 2017-11-14 02:32:42 UTC <hoagy114> @PissedOff911 @MeanStreetsOMA Or drive it to the Police Department .
930591268928815104 2017-11-14 00:20:22 UTC <hoagy114> @TxAgSheepdog Consequences to your actions...what is gonna happen next? Pay my taxes!
930590373944029184 2017-11-14 00:16:49 UTC <hoagy114> @BaldInKevlar @WingsWoody You know how that game is played
930589651181584385 2017-11-14 00:13:57 UTC <hoagy114> @WingsWoody @BaldInKevlar As you know a vast majority of these guys wont keep them trimmed etc.,
930589442791809024 2017-11-14 00:13:07 UTC <hoagy114> @WingsWoody @BaldInKevlar I did face mask testing & could see the difference in the fit test. Wouldnt want to role the dice on an actual terrorist attack.
930545394857140224 2017-11-14 21:18:05 UTC <hoagy114> @WingsWoody @BaldInKevlar Not only are they unprofessional, it creates seal problem when wearing gas masks or scba equipment.
930544137626992640 2017-11-14 21:13:05 UTC <hoagy114> @ABC Animals should not be allowed in passenger cabins of planes. They create problems for people with severe allergies. They disrupt the flight as well.
930535217135173632 2017-11-14 20:37:38 UTC <hoagy114> @SpecNewsCLT @privateofficer @FlynnShawn Because FOIA law was written before all this technology.
930533997133697024 2017-11-14 20:32:48 UTC <hoagy114> @THPFallBranch Why, are there bridges that cant handle large wights loads?
930496984531681280 2017-11-14 18:05:43 UTC <hoagy114> @FBILosAngeles @FBI @StacheESQ Unfortunately, they wont do anything because they are sooooooo busy.
930493970106400768 2017-11-14 17:53:44 UTC <hoagy114> @Conservative_VW You gotta live red necks!
930169459603468288 2017-11-13 20:24:15 UTC <hoagy114> @TheAthleticDET @CraigCustance That took a lot of courage for Ken Daniels, amazing...so very sorry for the loss of your child.
930167694875230208 2017-11-13 20:17:14 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary Yet the Commissioner will get his new contract.
930129540130660352 2017-11-13 17:45:37 UTC <hoagy114> @SuburbanFiveOh I would do it for free, then use CTE as the reason the league needs to fold.
930128614850420737 2017-11-13 17:41:57 UTC <hoagy114> @nypost I Hillary ruined her own chances. When will start to report on all of Shenanigans? She is unbelievable.
930127057228513280 2017-11-13 17:35:46 UTC <hoagy114> @GQMagazine @FoxNews The hits just keep coming....another Democratic rag magazine that does not support our great country.
929852855845978112 2017-11-12 23:26:11 UTC <hoagy114> @SenatorMenendez Hey Bob, I understand Girl Scouts wont sell cookies around your house any more... care to comment?
929751889926688768 2017-11-12 16:44:59 UTC <hoagy114> @Door_Kicker1032 What ever it is it is likely not going to be good.
929495603272224769 2017-11-11 23:46:35 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary It sucks that they did it in China, they will find out how lucky they are in the USA. Cry me a river....
929494975934373888 2017-11-11 23:44:06 UTC <hoagy114> @TxAgSheepdog Seriously WTF?
929445082427670529 2017-11-11 20:25:50 UTC <hoagy114> @dbongino They say what people want to hear, its about getting & keeping your voter base.
929201477700034560 2017-11-10 04:17:50 UTC <hoagy114> @AMC_TV really Si Fi weekend on Veterans Day...what is wrong with you guys?
929193586523959296 2017-11-10 03:46:29 UTC <hoagy114> @Lisa_Fielding @WBBMNewsradio They are already in jail, these are not normal people what do you expect?
929129270328172544 2017-11-10 23:30:55 UTC <hoagy114> @BuckSexton Hang in there it can get worse.
929039121539985408 2017-11-10 17:32:41 UTC <hoagy114> @ShenanigansFL That is a sad memory, keep the faith Brother.
929038927498919937 2017-11-10 17:31:55 UTC <hoagy114> @Breaking911 If true these asses should be hung out to dry in general population in prison.
929038324781654017 2017-11-10 17:29:31 UTC <hoagy114> @Deana_merritt33 Happy Birthday, girl!
929036716211499008 2017-11-10 17:23:08 UTC <hoagy114> W/ Veterans Day upon us, we remember & honor those who gave their lives for our way of life. We should never forget their sacrifices that they & their families made. @NFL has chosen to play politics over these brave service people. Boycott this weekends games.@DeptVetAffairs
929012819432947712 2017-11-10 15:48:11 UTC <hoagy114> @RookieCityCop Private Police service can create huge problems, especially if a bar is involved.
929012066970615810 2017-11-10 15:45:11 UTC <hoagy114> @DixonPolice Why is it all these old Chiefs cant retire and walk away. They love to think of themselves as so important.
929010241496219648 2017-11-10 15:37:56 UTC <hoagy114> @NolteNC They are owned by big liberal Democratics.
928827905211109376 2017-11-09 03:33:24 UTC <hoagy114> @Badge415 At least it had some gas in it....
928765741003763712 2017-11-09 23:26:22 UTC <hoagy114> @dailyherald Perhaps Palatine should have been making proper contributions to these pension funds all along then they wouldnt have this problem. Ill bet their IMRF pension funds for the Village Officials is 100% paid. Pension equality should be law in Illinois.
928763386480828416 2017-11-09 23:17:01 UTC <hoagy114> @Neptunes455 Very nice
928761538025893889 2017-11-09 23:09:40 UTC <hoagy114> @SenJohnMcCain As should you, take care of yourself let someone health & clear thinking take your office.
928743671863828480 2017-11-09 21:58:41 UTC <hoagy114> @drknstormynite Isnt that the truth, they would probably consider some legal action. Impersonation of an Officer?
928732770704097280 2017-11-09 21:15:22 UTC <hoagy114> @DaveNYviii That is very cool.
928730845359235072 2017-11-09 21:07:43 UTC <hoagy114> @USMC @WoodridgePolice Semper Fi, Jimmy
928730297176285184 2017-11-09 21:05:32 UTC <hoagy114> @FoxNews Its official the looney tunes in California have completely lost what little sanity they had left.
928656012243959809 2017-11-09 16:10:21 UTC <hoagy114> @USATODAY Maybe he should do more to stop the shootings in Chicago. Wouldnt it be nice for him to sit on a murder trail from gang violence. He wouldve the subject of the trial.  Never gonna happen.
928653142631186433 2017-11-09 15:58:57 UTC <hoagy114> @SteveBannen Perhaps she had a near miss accident and is rethinking her HRC comments. Seth Rich didnt get the hint.
928055197770776576 2017-11-07 00:22:56 UTC <hoagy114> @McNutty116 That is an aweful feeling.
927583460717408257 2017-11-06 17:08:25 UTC <hoagy114> @Target Those bags weigh less than 1/8 of oz. business must be really really good!
927372643967356928 2017-11-05 03:10:42 UTC <hoagy114> @MMFlint Have you fixed the Flint water problem yet?
927370037605879809 2017-11-05 03:00:21 UTC <hoagy114> @BarackObama 4 dead over the weekend 24 shot so far & what are doing or have you done about the situation in Chicago? Nothing!
927368768304697344 2017-11-05 02:55:18 UTC <hoagy114> @ReFlex76 Seriously, what is wrong with you, I hope you can become involved as a victim of the next lunatic event.....
927368006971396101 2017-11-05 02:52:17 UTC <hoagy114> @StephenKing The problem is this morons friends &/or family should have done something, tell someone or stopped this from happening.
927366849645473792 2017-11-05 02:47:41 UTC <hoagy114> @RealAlexJones It is time a declare them a terrorist organization and go after all their funding. A bunch of morons, lets go DOJ get this done!
926992283995602945 2017-11-04 01:59:17 UTC <hoagy114> @KNP2BP @chrissussdorf Bvwhy would he have security?
926975373086248961 2017-11-04 00:52:05 UTC <hoagy114> Crawford has got thispic.twitter.com/wqZ00ejbeN
926923641740283904 2017-11-04 21:26:32 UTC <hoagy114> @MentalAmmo Not a good idea, could get ugly fast and people have some expectation of privacy.
926646051926310912 2017-11-03 03:03:29 UTC <hoagy114> Funnier than shit.....his expression was priceless.
926616532746194944 2017-11-03 01:06:11 UTC <hoagy114> @Jumpman23 @DixonPolice Scary shit huh?
926580742955634689 2017-11-03 22:43:58 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary Morons = job security. But the @WSJ reporter that did the same thing, crazy. So much for having any legitimate news sources.
926580132818628608 2017-11-03 22:41:33 UTC <hoagy114> @RookieCityCop @PoliceLawProf Just like fire departments should not charge for ambulance services, taxes already support this function.
926570218696167429 2017-11-03 22:02:09 UTC <hoagy114> @SenSanders Bernie, you should go back to HRC for more money, she really screwed you. Ill bet you could buy your jet with the next payoff.
926519981478686721 2017-11-03 18:42:32 UTC <hoagy114> @BaldInKevlar @drknstormynite I feel your pain, sometimes shit just slips out of your mouth. Everyone got a laugh,you get the I will not do that again thing. Fantastic
926291018210791424 2017-11-02 03:32:43 UTC <hoagy114> @GIJoeOPS @truth_pray So much for free speech.
926290545412067328 2017-11-02 03:30:50 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary the FBI play book says coincidence is not enough,besides they would have to look at those other 23 lots of leg work to do. Not da Police.
926231233427845122 2017-11-02 23:35:09 UTC <hoagy114> Tax cuts are fantastic! However, tax cuts should not create additional debt. Balance the budget @realDonaldTrump
926143311613751296 2017-11-02 17:45:47 UTC <hoagy114> @BluEzeNBrwnSkin When you get old you too will have hearing loss.
926134131075047424 2017-11-02 17:09:18 UTC <hoagy114> @RaylaRimpson Horny thong Thursday ?
926133370706366466 2017-11-02 17:06:16 UTC <hoagy114> @kfc @NFL Who cares? @TheNFLBoycott
926132964693630983 2017-11-02 17:04:40 UTC <hoagy114> @WBBMNewsradio @CBSNews Thank you for not mentioning his name. Terrorists want their 15 minutes of media attention. When will MSM wake up & see it is wrong?
926131892453363712 2017-11-02 17:00:24 UTC <hoagy114> @RookieCityCop Some trimming ?
926131345654468611 2017-11-02 16:58:14 UTC <hoagy114> @MorganKolkmeyer Perhaps you need to plan better?
926129003404120066 2017-11-02 16:48:55 UTC <hoagy114> @scrowder As much as everyone is thinking it, it is wrong for him to say it. He is no longer a private citizen.
925947178077564929 2017-11-01 04:46:25 UTC <hoagy114> @ParkForestPD @DixonPolice More work, more fun....more money....pension will transfer.
925802273820827648 2017-11-01 19:10:37 UTC <hoagy114> @TxAgSheepdog @CAffinat Brings new meaning...Incest is the game, the whole family can play. That is just strange.
925800319644250112 2017-11-01 19:02:51 UTC <hoagy114> @lsarsour Perhaps they should pray and live somewhere else, because clearly this is unacceptable!
925799621053558784 2017-11-01 19:00:04 UTC <hoagy114> If China can control Internet access, why cant we control ISIS access here in the US the same way? Why allow content that threatens us?
925797874176348160 2017-11-01 18:53:08 UTC <hoagy114> @OT_Enthusiast So of course the Mayor just left instead of doing anything.....
925794402953515008 2017-11-01 18:39:20 UTC <hoagy114> @FoxNews These morons need to get the hell out of our country. What happened to everyone being treated equal?
925559195302268928 2017-10-31 03:04:42 UTC <hoagy114> @USATODAY What is doing to help Chicago with all these murders?
925546246785380352 2017-10-31 02:13:15 UTC <hoagy114> @crusader4US @GillianHTurner Wow! They have doing this around the world and you just figured it out! That is impressive, you should seek employment as a consultant.
925508512205111297 2017-10-31 23:43:19 UTC <hoagy114> @ShockDelivered That seems very radical.
925488520277487616 2017-10-31 22:23:52 UTC <hoagy114> @realDonaldTrump @BilldeBlasio How about address the real problems in your city like the terrorists ?
925484111376076800 2017-10-31 22:06:21 UTC <hoagy114> @cbschicago @WBBMNewsradio @AudrinaBigos Perhaps he can explain the terrorist attacking by that peaceful religion?
925483688439185413 2017-10-31 22:04:40 UTC <hoagy114> @johnpodesta Karma...perhaps it is just that?
925453702311370752 2017-10-31 20:05:31 UTC <hoagy114> @SurreyPolice @CityPolice @metpoliceuk @amelia_karras @VictorOlisaMPS Good luck in the future, you deserve it after 35 years!
925419436672274437 2017-10-31 17:49:21 UTC <hoagy114> @CSTbreaking Now that is funny.
925396615497748480 2017-10-31 16:18:40 UTC <hoagy114> @darrenrovell Your prices are way the hell out of line.
925196445245992960 2017-10-30 03:03:16 UTC <hoagy114> @policeofficer Could be the area is extremely expensive with almost no crime in the area.
925171527288487936 2017-10-30 01:24:15 UTC <hoagy114> @ObamaFoundation @BarackObama Sir, what are you doing to help address the killings of all these men of color in Chicago? What is your plan?
925155634118582273 2017-10-30 00:21:06 UTC <hoagy114> @steph93065 Why would you even watch that they are terrible?
925093638371201025 2017-10-30 20:14:45 UTC <hoagy114> @GunOfBavaria Ive always said,Give me a young eager recruit and let him learn the ways of doing things, & in less than 12 months hell be disheartened.
924815731639963649 2017-10-29 01:50:27 UTC <hoagy114> @HomeGoods @bigricanman Sometimes that is the best.
924394855400427530 2017-10-28 21:58:02 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary What is wrong with people...just stupid.
924366839966240768 2017-10-28 20:06:43 UTC <hoagy114> @Conservative_VW You Sir, are a lucky man!
924366140842893312 2017-10-28 20:03:56 UTC <hoagy114> @HockeyRenegade BOB?
924303505065762816 2017-10-28 15:55:02 UTC <hoagy114> @USMC Wow!
924302681124016128 2017-10-28 15:51:46 UTC <hoagy114> @EmersenLee It does know what it is.
924117112842604545 2017-10-27 03:34:23 UTC <hoagy114> @davidaxelrod What difference does it make to you? Maybe people can make that every couple of years. Give them the chance to better themselves.
924115189624180736 2017-10-27 03:26:45 UTC <hoagy114> @screamingmd No more than 30
924105336780451840 2017-10-27 02:47:35 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary And these idiots have 5he authority to your kids from your house on allegations that are not even substantiated. Some scary shit!
923721902312521728 2017-10-26 01:23:58 UTC <hoagy114> @crusader4US @CBSPittsburgh Sorry, those are not men...they are animals.
923705894336020481 2017-10-26 00:20:21 UTC <hoagy114> @MentalAmmo National laws regarding first responders should address these types of issues. @realDonaldTrump should form a committee to look into this.
923702452972437504 2017-10-26 00:06:41 UTC <hoagy114> @screamingmd @mlb needs to understand the game is too long! The season is too long! They have like st the youngest generation in America.Wake up @MLB_PR

918258264709705728 2017-10-11 23:33:25 UTC <hoagy114> @Westxgal People on networks should be held to a higher standard due the volume of people they can reach w/ their medium. Honest / fair must be #1.

918145148793606144 2017-10-11 16:03:56 UTC <hoagy114> @BlondeinKevlar TV shows can solve multiple homicide at numerous locations, get DNA results, bullet comps, & process all of it NOW. In the real world ..NOT
918143257217028096 2017-10-11 15:56:25 UTC <hoagy114> @Patriotvnvet @RealJamesWoods We should not subsidize (an#y level of government) any professional sports teams. They threaten to move if they dont get tax dollars.

917914994058170368 2017-10-10 00:49:23 UTC <hoagy114> @SenSanders @JujuBurke2 @ScubaForDogs So,it is ok to discriminate? Then if we eliminate illegal aliens ($$) then we save money which we would use to educate public Colleges?
917853846323515392 2017-10-10 20:46:24 UTC <hoagy114> @SenSanders @JujuBurke2 @ScubaForDogs Where are you getting these numbers from? If we just use state colleges that seems to be discriminatory against other places.
917849153639800833 2017-10-10 20:27:45 UTC <hoagy114> @SenSanders @JujuBurke2 @ScubaForDogs Ok, that number seems low, but what about the other institutions? If it is free for everyone I should be able to attend Havard, right?
917795958741749760 2017-10-10 16:56:23 UTC <hoagy114> @AIIAmericanGirI And if they eliminate the cap on Social Security that would help everyone!

915396571411435521 2017-10-03 02:02:04 UTC <hoagy114> @realDonaldTrump @RookieCityCop Perhaps he doesn't realize how hard police train for these incidents? Most people have no idea, all they do is bash the police.
915394561631031297 2017-10-03 01:54:05 UTC <hoagy114> @NFL @GIJoeOPS @NinaMorton This is why the general public doesn't want to deal with these cry baby millionaires. They just don't get it. I hope they loose all their $$

914646568049025024 2017-10-01 00:21:49 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary What ever happened to dress code while traveling?
914623910171353089 2017-10-01 22:51:47 UTC <hoagy114> @scrowder But BHO said that would not happen because he/she identifies as a woman...could that Moron be wrong again?
914220726986661888 2017-09-30 20:09:41 UTC <hoagy114> @DonnaWR8 @LVNancy @jimlibertarian @TheMeemStreams @chrgdup1973 @TheTrumpLady @W_C_Patriot @TrumpsBlonde @Ms_Erika74 @CarmenYulinCruz @GeorgiaDirtRoad @TheLeftIsRacist Perhaps she should resign because obviously she is not a leader. A real leader would make everything work. Not a time for politics.
914215900160692231 2017-09-30 19:50:30 UTC <hoagy114> @GeraldoRivera @crusader4US Perhaps they should start unloading the containers in the dock and start shipping the stuff out.
914190015772741633 2017-09-30 18:07:39 UTC <hoagy114> @LouHayesJr @Academy911 If robots could do your jobs it would create a cluster f@@k of epically proportions. It would be the end of coffee drinking as we know it.
914182060436312064 2017-09-30 17:36:02 UTC <hoagy114> @RookieCityCop Well, good luck...
914180560221810689 2017-09-30 17:30:04 UTC <hoagy114> @BlondeinKevlar The neighbor probably did it.
914180341757304832 2017-09-30 17:29:12 UTC <hoagy114> @GunOfBavaria It's Saturday placed was "jammed".
913959436561059840 2017-09-29 02:51:24 UTC <hoagy114> @Wrangler @Jaguars @NFL Good they should stat there and never return. Apparently they care more about England then the USA.
913954427370909696 2017-09-29 02:31:30 UTC <hoagy114> @TxAgSheepdog @CrazyinRussia With that classic bag phone.
913952433285554177 2017-09-29 02:23:35 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary That great
913950913173352448 2017-09-29 02:17:32 UTC <hoagy114> @Night_Stripes Probably.
913950688987709440 2017-09-29 02:16:39 UTC <hoagy114> @SuburbanFiveOh @drknstormynite Many have tempted to do so...none ever succeed.
913950049410912256 2017-09-29 02:14:06 UTC <hoagy114> A slow painful death is not good enough for this POS!
913948656784551939 2017-09-29 02:08:34 UTC <hoagy114> @Night_Stripes Coffee on the computer....Oh my, alarms going off in the IT office!
913816441488596997 2017-09-29 17:23:12 UTC <hoagy114> @FoxNews Great video it shows how people don't understand the simplest ideas & believe what mass media is Tellone no then the truth.
913485380804071425 2017-09-28 19:27:41 UTC <hoagy114> @bigricanman @BBCNews It is truly sad that common sense doesn't exsist anymore.
913484703713423360 2017-09-28 19:24:59 UTC <hoagy114> @mcsassymd Has she brought up any stories....or just stays quiet?
913484062668607489 2017-09-28 19:22:26 UTC <hoagy114> @McNutty116 That sucks....
913483818866286592 2017-09-28 19:21:28 UTC <hoagy114> @ShenanigansFL Is that in DC? Are you shitting me?
913213801616609280 2017-09-27 01:28:31 UTC <hoagy114> @GenJohnKelly You Sir, are very funny...thanks I needed that tonite.
913210521628954627 2017-09-27 01:15:29 UTC <hoagy114> @USATODAY Why don't you ask HRC why she didn't work on changing this as Sec of State? Probably busy cashing their checks....
913207343814516736 2017-09-27 01:02:51 UTC <hoagy114> @ABC7Chicago Who are these idiots and why would anyone care?
913194575082205184 2017-09-27 00:12:07 UTC <hoagy114> @amelia_karras @SBCSDobozek Most of them are doing it wrong.
913193628037795842 2017-09-27 00:08:21 UTC <hoagy114> @_phil_thompson @ChicagoSports How about...no one cares about football.
913126225270493184 2017-09-27 19:40:31 UTC <hoagy114> @CSTbreaking Must have one hall of a habit!
913123206713749513 2017-09-27 19:28:32 UTC <hoagy114> @HockeyRenegade Sometimes you gotta look in the mirror & say "maybe it is me?".
913121554770382850 2017-09-27 19:21:58 UTC <hoagy114> @DETECTIVE4LIFE Instead of a knee, how about getting their butts to Chicago and start working the streets talking to the gang members?
913108941906874368 2017-09-27 18:31:51 UTC <hoagy114> @HillaryClinton @FoxNews But as SOS she never thought that they should drive? Interesting she is trying to keep her name in the news.
913086911442546688 2017-09-27 17:04:18 UTC <hoagy114> @carrieksada @phil200269 @DrMartyFox @We_R_TheMedia @ChristieC733 @Lrihendry @CarmineZozzora @AppSame @steph93065 @NBA @NFL @nflcommish @LeahR77 @Braveheart_USA Last I checked MJ was black?
913081236272353280 2017-09-27 16:41:45 UTC <hoagy114> @mchooyah @TxAgSheepdog And it will be we'll deserved.
913077481061658627 2017-09-27 16:26:50 UTC <hoagy114> @NFL I just cancelled my Red Xone yesterday!
912788853953527808 2017-09-26 21:19:56 UTC <hoagy114> @LouHayesJr Damn, I was trying so hard to figure that out.... oh well.
912785521339977728 2017-09-26 21:06:41 UTC <hoagy114> @HillaryClinton Please go back into the woods or Costco.
912778626260721664 2017-09-26 20:39:17 UTC <hoagy114> @LouHayesJr 32
912716869110509570 2017-09-26 16:33:53 UTC <hoagy114> @guypbenson Nice use of the English language...college educated? Yeah right...another athlete pushed through so the college can make money.
912529290599772160 2017-09-25 04:08:31 UTC <hoagy114> @SecondCityCop But she will call the police when she gets her ass kicked.
912528467413135366 2017-09-25 04:05:15 UTC <hoagy114> @steph93065 @Cernovich Where is "Big Ben" to stand next to him if he is sorry that this happened. The coach is a complete ASS!
912448825373097987 2017-09-25 22:48:47 UTC <hoagy114> 2/2 Becuase they only care about money, not about people, it has become such a joke.
912448557793366017 2017-09-25 22:47:43 UTC <hoagy114> 1/2 The 550th murder occurred in Chicago on Sunday. Why aren't these million dollar athletes there helping to solve the problem? Why not?
912447794341908481 2017-09-25 22:44:41 UTC <hoagy114> @MarkKaboly That is complete bullshit!
912443438519463936 2017-09-25 22:27:22 UTC <hoagy114> @SteveBannen And how to blame Police Officers for causing all these problems.
912442959525744642 2017-09-25 22:25:28 UTC <hoagy114> @WGNNews I'm curious as a senior officer she should have been able to accrue lots of time off, not to mention vacation time. No time accrued really?
912375106101489665 2017-09-25 17:55:51 UTC <hoagy114> @HillaryClinton How about the Clinton Foundation send them some money to help out? Talk is cheap!
912373943511732224 2017-09-25 17:51:13 UTC <hoagy114> @Breaking911 Remind me again why they don't have dry hydrants?
912350334919544832 2017-09-25 16:17:25 UTC <hoagy114> @NFLPA Politics should not be on our time. Protest & spend your millions on helping on your time. What about blk on blk crime? Stand up 4 them.
912348007428968448 2017-09-25 16:08:10 UTC <hoagy114> @RookieCityCop That's horrible tough for any agency,
912139820918607872 2017-09-24 02:20:54 UTC <hoagy114> @ShenanigansFL I like when he rescues the princess!
912138374483517440 2017-09-24 02:15:09 UTC <hoagy114> @BlueLineRookie Vacation does last forever ....it is called Retirement and it is amazingly wonderful. Hang in there it is totally worth it.
912137583760674817 2017-09-24 02:12:01 UTC <hoagy114> @Door_Kicker1032 Yeah it has to do with some volunteer groups...
912136331207352320 2017-09-24 02:07:02 UTC <hoagy114> @HockeyRenegade The Bears looked worse!
912136047743692800 2017-09-24 02:05:55 UTC <hoagy114> @BlondeinKevlar Hey, do we get to see you in costume?
911767415717027840 2017-09-23 01:41:06 UTC <hoagy114> @Samsung @htc @Apple @MotorolaUS @CopConfessions Call forwarding?
911763377860567042 2017-09-23 01:25:03 UTC <hoagy114> @Door_Kicker1032 Maybe it's a shark gun?
911743158731538432 2017-09-23 00:04:43 UTC <hoagy114> @NFLPA Politics doesn't belong on the playing field. Your cry baby millionaires who don't understand what the flag & anthem actually represent.
911637567161929732 2017-09-23 17:05:08 UTC <hoagy114> @Night_Stripes The other participants showed up late.
911636992571707392 2017-09-23 17:02:51 UTC <hoagy114> @FoxNews But these millionaire cry babies are being respectful? Roger needs to get out in the real world.
911634168840368129 2017-09-23 16:51:37 UTC <hoagy114> @GunOfBavaria That is beautiful.
911333909467734016 2017-09-22 20:58:30 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary I guess being out on Bond makes if PC...what a bunch of crap.
911332742037680128 2017-09-22 20:53:52 UTC <hoagy114> @RealJamesWoods We need to remove the cap on Social Security, that would ensure solvency for the future. Change the system so it is fair for all.
910715936914669568 2017-09-20 04:02:54 UTC <hoagy114> @GIJoeOPS @RealJamesWoods @realDonaldTrump this is very accurate,Sir
910706364594425856 2017-09-20 03:24:52 UTC <hoagy114> @MatForAll2018 Don't quit your current job....or are you on unemployment?
910699882150858752 2017-09-20 02:59:06 UTC <hoagy114> @jaketapper You don't see a lot of people stepping up.
910696871160664064 2017-09-20 02:47:08 UTC <hoagy114> @John_Kass They didn't come up with on their own. @NFL needs to address this, it has gotten out of control. They need to address this head on!
910595693663916033 2017-09-20 20:05:06 UTC <hoagy114> @RealJamesWoods Like the clown in Chicago.
910535971640430593 2017-09-20 16:07:47 UTC <hoagy114> @RealJamesWoods Don't with grey haired guys wearing flip flops. That was a great video!
910531151227445249 2017-09-20 15:48:37 UTC <hoagy114> @SuburbanFiveOh Why don't we call it common sense because that is all that is needed.
910322590371254272 2017-09-19 01:59:53 UTC <hoagy114> @TxAgSheepdog Probably not enough beds in the firehouses for them to sleep comfortably. Union has a contract you know.
910318000854781953 2017-09-19 01:41:38 UTC <hoagy114> @DonutOperator Could someone ease explain crisis intervention training because it does not exsist!
910316263255273473 2017-09-19 01:34:44 UTC <hoagy114> @SFPDAcademy @SFPDRecruitment @SFPD @cserrano1234 You are all wearing radios? Really wtf?
910268498991034368 2017-09-19 22:24:56 UTC <hoagy114> @BlueLineRookie It makes them feel important.
910261901782867970 2017-09-19 21:58:43 UTC <hoagy114> @Door_Kicker1032 They will give you the suspension days after the award ceremony.
910261414123761665 2017-09-19 21:56:47 UTC <hoagy114> @amelia_karras @Gadgets_Gear1 Police badges should never be for sale....encourages imposters!
910254150444822529 2017-09-19 21:27:55 UTC <hoagy114> @samjcharles @ANTTOONICE But they can't do it alone.
910250493800099840 2017-09-19 21:13:24 UTC <hoagy114> @SuburbanFiveOh @Door_Kicker1032 Sorry, damn autocorrect Bean Bag rounds.
910237494972690432 2017-09-19 20:21:44 UTC <hoagy114> @SuburbanFiveOh @Door_Kicker1032 Libyan Bags are an alternative but they can be dangerous.
909989963164454912 2017-09-18 03:58:08 UTC <hoagy114> @RaylaRimpson Coming soon .....
909978690511147008 2017-09-18 03:13:21 UTC <hoagy114> @Gangcop Where is Rahm?
909976050406510598 2017-09-18 03:02:51 UTC <hoagy114> @samjcharles @ANTTOONICE They won't talk to the police.
909975982651662336 2017-09-18 03:02:35 UTC <hoagy114> @samjcharles @ANTTOONICE Those doors are heavy but close easily to keep things cold. The police can get it wrong as well, friends will talk freely around each other.
909971974058921989 2017-09-18 02:46:39 UTC <hoagy114> @samjcharles @ANTTOONICE Protesting this makes no sense. Why are they not helping the family? They know who was there, why don't they try talking to them?
909970797552439299 2017-09-18 02:41:59 UTC <hoagy114> @samjcharles @ANTTOONICE They don't know that it is murder, they are waiting for toxic results. There was a room full of people that need to be interviewed yet.
909969889166860288 2017-09-18 02:38:22 UTC <hoagy114> @samjcharles @ANTTOONICE I don't understand what they are protesting?
909967499713814529 2017-09-18 02:28:52 UTC <hoagy114> @samjcharles I don't understand the protests, the investigation is not even completed? I can only assume her "friends" not cooperating in the big picture
909966445500665858 2017-09-18 02:24:41 UTC <hoagy114> @KNP2BP @southern4MAGA Rahm has been suspiciously quiet recently. Perhaps he is cleaning BHO's shoes.
909963261419900928 2017-09-18 02:12:02 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary @Night_Stripes New S/A's is making head way in changing everything....it is like a disease.
909938789459603456 2017-09-18 00:34:47 UTC <hoagy114> @POTUS @Patriotvnvet @michaelbeatty3 She doesn't get it...they want entitlements like all the other Democrat's.
909908265915568130 2017-09-18 22:33:30 UTC <hoagy114> @NancyPelosi @GeorgiaDirtRoad Illegal aliens can be scary, maybe Nancy should wake up and see what is happening in the real world...
909901564122484736 2017-09-18 22:06:52 UTC <hoagy114> @BlueLineRookie Make sure you have friends outside of law enforcement as well, when you retire they are there for you.
909811006280470528 2017-09-18 16:07:02 UTC <hoagy114> @SoFloAPaul Good luck study the law it will help you.
909618849980600320 2017-09-17 03:23:28 UTC <hoagy114> @StephenKing Dude have you read your own books?
909512155598393344 2017-09-17 20:19:30 UTC <hoagy114> @PoliceOne Wow! Good for her, most have to go out & get jobs doing security to make ends meet. 
909177900926201857 2017-09-16 22:11:17 UTC <hoagy114> @elizabethforma Would it be the same health care that Congress has?
909174922110472193 2017-09-16 21:59:27 UTC <hoagy114> @SenSanders Then who is going to pay for it?
909174505985204224 2017-09-16 21:57:48 UTC <hoagy114> @RealJamesWoods My guess is that a large amount of "local security" is off duty cops who had heir time cancelled
909162982579605511 2017-09-16 21:12:01 UTC <hoagy114> @TomiLahren Notice how they don't protest during the day...they like the cover of darkness...need a curfew put into place.
909155841051414528 2017-09-16 20:43:38 UTC <hoagy114> @RookieCityCop Hang in there,stay safe.
908778013487230978 2017-09-15 19:42:17 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary Governor no doubt
908740815664697344 2017-09-15 17:14:28 UTC <hoagy114> @SpeakerRyan @pops_clark I saw an article out of Cali, may have been San Diego, they were abolishing their records, so not "label" anyone incorrectly.
908480280029270016 2017-09-14 23:59:12 UTC <hoagy114> @RookieCityCop Did you fall out to the ground holding your neck, screaming out in pain? If not it was a fender bender....
908476446741549056 2017-09-14 23:43:58 UTC <hoagy114> @pops_clark @SpeakerRyan Membership? What does this mean? What about these PD's that are destroying their databases, where will this info come from?
908475615451508736 2017-09-14 23:40:40 UTC <hoagy114> @pops_clark @benshapiro I am hoping the mayor lets the police do their job!
908474999228583937 2017-09-14 23:38:13 UTC <hoagy114> @FoxNews This is going to get very ugly
908447206012841989 2017-09-14 21:47:46 UTC <hoagy114> @USHouseFloor It is only natural, how you deal with it is the key.
908372457446408195 2017-09-14 16:50:45 UTC <hoagy114> @ABC7Chicago Who is paying for that security? And what is this moron doing hosting anything?
908102120305553408 2017-09-13 22:56:31 UTC <hoagy114> @RealJamesWoods In ILL. you can move 4 times & register to vote. It is your responsibility to notify the last election board of when you moved or not.
908074867412652037 2017-09-13 21:08:14 UTC <hoagy114> @SenSanders Would it be the same plan that you and the rest of Congress have? Would are taxes stay the same?
908071382566793217 2017-09-13 20:54:23 UTC <hoagy114> @SLKollmann Apparently you don't live in the real world and have never been the victim of violent crime.
908070915031932929 2017-09-13 20:52:31 UTC <hoagy114> @LouHayesJr Lou, they only care about the political side of things.
908070539012530177 2017-09-13 20:51:02 UTC <hoagy114> @ricksmith2825 Police Officers actions are questioned every day, whether by the public, a street lawyer,etc. Your statement is crazy it cost millions more.
908066566511702017 2017-09-13 20:35:15 UTC <hoagy114> @GovMikeHuckabee Because the "fix was in"!
908066140873744384 2017-09-13 20:33:33 UTC <hoagy114> @bluelivesmtr You guys are becoming so bad you can't read an article because the ads keeping getting in the way....bye
907787305947148288 2017-09-12 02:05:34 UTC <hoagy114> @HillaryClinton Please stop and just go away quietly.

907705691066028035 2017-09-12 20:41:15 UTC <hoagy114> @Door_Kicker1032 My favorite line was " maybe we should ask the Chief?"
907705379328536576 2017-09-12 20:40:01 UTC <hoagy114> @OT_Enthusiast Like "BINGO Z"?

907360528883908608 2017-09-11 21:49:42 UTC <hoagy114> @BlueLineRookie We always left it up to the Sgt/ Watch Commander to make the call this time of year and in the Spring.
907325531628212224 2017-09-11 19:30:38 UTC <hoagy114> @MaconLetisTmato That can't be good.
907058324943851520 2017-09-10 01:48:51 UTC <hoagy114> @RealJamesWoods Thank God! Can we get her "entitled daughter" to promise she won't run as well. Clintons need to just disappear.
907057556841005057 2017-09-10 01:45:48 UTC <hoagy114> Guy on weather channel standing outside says it's not safe. Fire Dept. Won' t respond b/c it's not safe. Is he stronger than a fire engine?
907055359491276801 2017-09-10 01:37:04 UTC <hoagy114> @ChrisCoon4 @Rambobiggs Now that is DAMN funny!

907031409444958208 2017-09-10 00:01:54 UTC <hoagy114> @ShenanigansFL Now that really sucks.
906974156826316801 2017-09-10 20:14:24 UTC <hoagy114> Watching this weather channel guy on Marco Island, hoping he gets hit with debris. Then maybe he'll stop repeating himself. Change channels.

905599424004489217 2017-09-06 01:11:42 UTC <hoagy114> @ChristieC733 The federal government did this in Chicago in the 60's. Black Panther congressman Bobby Rush!
905597064045891584 2017-09-06 01:02:19 UTC <hoagy114> @SLandinSoCal Good, I hope they sue police chief, the mayor and the community as a whole for their inaction in a time of crisis.

905457400521650177 2017-09-06 15:47:21 UTC <hoagy114> @NancyPelosi Wow! So the US Attorney General declares something unconstitutional because that is his job & Trump is a coward? I quit if I were you.
905455400509722624 2017-09-06 15:39:24 UTC <hoagy114> @SusanPage Would you please take this a step further & investigate Clinton Foundation, Dick Durbin, Nancy Pelosi & Paul Ryan who are their supporters?
905453388669870080 2017-09-06 15:31:25 UTC <hoagy114> @ChristieC733 Maybe Rahm should fix the crime problem instead of trying to get press for his presidential run in 2020?
905259353074147328 2017-09-05 02:40:23 UTC <hoagy114> @Door_Kicker1032 Sounds like holiday pay!
905249894826471424 2017-09-05 02:02:48 UTC <hoagy114> @BarackObama What you did was illegal, yet you did it anyway giving some hope to criminals. But we all know how much you hate the police.
905244774441082881 2017-09-05 01:42:27 UTC <hoagy114> @KamalaHarris Take your petition to Congress, try and pass the law that BHO did illegally.

904902452331372544 2017-09-04 03:02:11 UTC <hoagy114> @Real_Stephens17 Apparently you don't know history - Chicago 1960's paid the Black Panthers off, Bobby Rush , US Congressman was one of many who scammed us.
904900691940057089 2017-09-04 02:55:11 UTC <hoagy114> @MMFlint Are you still alive? Why ?

904519162067902465 2017-09-03 01:39:08 UTC <hoagy114> @crusader4US @PoliticalShort Apparently these democrats are following he lead of those from the 60's. Perhaps Bobby Rush is giving them advice.
904513733682192384 2017-09-03 01:17:33 UTC <hoagy114> @timkaine Time to retire, and give up all your benefits for all of America!
904510583998996480 2017-09-03 01:05:02 UTC <hoagy114> @ChelseaClinton I'm sorry you need to just "disappear like many attached to your parents campaigns". You were born with the silver spoon in your mouth.
904509602837999616 2017-09-03 01:01:08 UTC <hoagy114> @LouHayesJr 2/2 way too fucking lawyers in this world!

904508639582584836 2017-09-03 00:57:19 UTC <hoagy114> @greta @BeschlossDC Class act perhaps he should relate that to the country today?
904506758445531136 2017-09-03 00:49:50 UTC <hoagy114> @RamTrucks @paulinatravel Hey, how about Dodge sending you and lots of cash to Texas perhaps that might generate more viewers?
904427984605597701 2017-09-03 19:36:49 UTC <hoagy114> @Door_Kicker1032 Is that when you took the cuffs off when he opened his mouth?
904427330612977665 2017-09-03 19:34:13 UTC <hoagy114> @nypost George come back to the real world. Born with a silver spoon on your mouth, you don't understand the common man.
904402504737333249 2017-09-03 17:55:34 UTC <hoagy114> @CompStatWarrior Yeah but it was also a loot of fun.
904402370536329217 2017-09-03 17:55:02 UTC <hoagy114> @CompStatWarrior It solved a lot problems, but a lot of pranks ensued.
904402150209572864 2017-09-03 17:54:10 UTC <hoagy114> @CompStatWarrior How about you key everything the same?
904400342112239616 2017-09-03 17:46:59 UTC <hoagy114> @ShenanigansFL My comment would have been, "shh, don't let anyone know I kinda borrowed this stuff...I'll give it back when I'm done " then a little wink.
903829150338830336 2017-09-01 03:57:16 UTC <hoagy114> @OT_Enthusiast @Academy911 But I'm sure it's all a misunderstanding.
903828450619920384 2017-09-01 03:54:29 UTC <hoagy114> @OT_Enthusiast @Academy911 You say that like. That is a problem.

903441632783159296 2017-08-31 02:17:25 UTC <hoagy114> @chicagotribune Insssume she is also going to repay all the funds plus interest? Or perhaps Rahm is going to hire her.
903437762577276928 2017-08-31 02:02:02 UTC <hoagy114> @ilmediaschool There is no real future in journalism.
903435553781280768 2017-08-31 01:53:15 UTC <hoagy114> @KamalaHarris Could you please explain to me where the money is going to come from? Also I assume this includes all persons, Congress, POTUS, etc.?
903429341207547904 2017-08-31 01:28:34 UTC <hoagy114> @texashabanero Apparently you don't work the street too much, this shit happens all the time. Reality unfortunately really sucks.

902915037056180225 2017-08-30 15:24:54 UTC <hoagy114> @RealJamesWoods Sir, you are assuming these nitwits would have jobs. They are Democrat's living off our taxes & being paid by Soros.

898927844868468736 2017-08-19 15:21:14 UTC <hoagy114> @FoxNews People wearing masks should be "detained" for investigative purposes. I'm sure they will be released once they ID them.

895829913860812800 2017-08-10 02:11:09 UTC <hoagy114> @SuburbanFiveOh Seriously? You must also be a Cubs fan.....
895484155202605057 2017-08-09 03:17:14 UTC <hoagy114> @cbschicago @WBBMNewsradio @CharlieDeMar If they are not using them properly (slowly up& down) checking ankles,etc it's a problem. Also improperly trained people doing the job.
895482382391947264 2017-08-09 03:10:11 UTC <hoagy114> @cbschicago @WBBMNewsradio @CharlieDeMar No metal detectors?
895462428368154624 2017-08-09 01:50:54 UTC <hoagy114> @ChrisLewisLLS @LouHayesJr Hey that was the one that was in my brief case.
895461592891969536 2017-08-09 01:47:35 UTC <hoagy114> @BackThePolice Wow sounds like the FOP needs to file a discrimination lawsuit, think about what message that will send.
895339252145246209 2017-08-09 17:41:26 UTC <hoagy114> @MidnightPatrols @Mike_TheCop Very cool!
895013149304385541 2017-08-08 20:05:37 UTC <hoagy114> @steph93065 Typical Democrat with BHO & Hilliary he'll decide what laws he is gonna follow. He needs to get a real life
895011585659371520 2017-08-08 19:59:25 UTC <hoagy114> @RaineyVoI This is simply hilarious!
895006028059770880 2017-08-08 19:37:20 UTC <hoagy114> @Mperfectwarrior @BlondeinKevlar You forgot they just went on OT
895000504924876802 2017-08-08 19:15:23 UTC <hoagy114> @CaffeinatedCop Oh yeah either Dad or Hubby will blow a gasket.
894996520587722752 2017-08-08 18:59:33 UTC <hoagy114> @CaffeinatedCop That is no slashed tire!
894965514790989824 2017-08-08 16:56:21 UTC <hoagy114> @SuburbanFiveOh Wow talk about being progressive was he a "truck enforcement  or range" guy?
894949237674442752 2017-08-08 15:51:40 UTC <hoagy114> @WGNMorningNews Really this is a concern?
894943945389731841 2017-08-08 15:30:38 UTC <hoagy114> @WMaccarone If firefighters worked normal hours this would not be an issue. Response times at night are sometimes more than double during daylight hours
894408191789936640 2017-08-06 04:01:44 UTC <hoagy114> @CynicalFireman Is that st the firehouse?
894368590098518023 2017-08-06 01:24:23 UTC <hoagy114> @NancyPelosi Nancy was that your first year in Congress? It's time for you to RETIRE!

894271545161461760 2017-08-06 18:58:45 UTC <hoagy114> @LPD1420 @amelia_karras @Lincoln_Police Really 2 days??? Someone dropped the ball on that one.
893692201775099904 2017-08-04 04:36:39 UTC <hoagy114> @nytimes What happened to investigative journalism? You guys should just file for bankruptcy now, it is going to happen sooner or later.
893240708907270145 2017-08-03 22:42:35 UTC <hoagy114> @Yair_Rosenberg That courts needs to be eliminated, with that logic. What has happened to the people around the world why are they so afraid?
893183322175791105 2017-08-03 18:54:33 UTC <hoagy114> I'll bet those email addresses are already full, what morons!
892935240527876096 2017-08-02 02:28:45 UTC <hoagy114> @InspectorDewar @VaughanFire With all the time on their hands they should be diving world problems!
892859321092112384 2017-08-02 21:27:05 UTC <hoagy114> @AIIAmericanGirI If I were them I'd leave this country, that will show them!
892858153636958208 2017-08-02 21:22:26 UTC <hoagy114> @PamelaGeller Screw them if they don't like it too bad. It is a free country, if they like it don't let the door hit them in the ass on the way out.
892850671514529793 2017-08-02 20:52:43 UTC <hoagy114> @RamblinRay890 Nice view from the Cell
892770293382623232 2017-08-02 15:33:19 UTC <hoagy114> @WBBMNewsradio @CBSNews Maybe that should should happening in the US, then reporters might stop spinning all their stories.
892766952434937856 2017-08-02 15:20:02 UTC <hoagy114> @RodStryker Does anyone in this exodus realize how many jobs and money the Federal government is tied to in California? Their economy would tank.
892765982057537536 2017-08-02 15:16:11 UTC <hoagy114> @SuburbanFiveOh I doubt it that would mean they would have to work nights and weekends...that is what they have you for
892544841623756804 2017-08-01 00:37:27 UTC <hoagy114> @CFDMedia @Chicago_Police @ChicagosMayor So whar are your plans for all the murders occurring in the city? Why are you so quiet about them? Why isn't Obama coming to help you?
892541270752735232 2017-08-01 00:23:16 UTC <hoagy114> @steph93065 Seriously WTF!
892540555162525696 2017-08-01 00:20:25 UTC <hoagy114> @tamaraleighllc @kwilli1046 Because the moron never had a real job, community activist is when the gov't gives them money to be on their side!
892538039611904000 2017-08-01 00:10:25 UTC <hoagy114> @NolteNC What does that "being" ? Whiskey bravery?
892531628488175617 2017-08-01 23:44:57 UTC <hoagy114> @wdsd_7 @WoodDalePolice @johnwcorbett Are they playing Bingo? That is sad...
892473811005734915 2017-08-01 19:55:12 UTC <hoagy114> @AP She should get what her child got & she should die the same way.
892465268638855169 2017-08-01 19:21:15 UTC <hoagy114> @foxandfriends Absolutely
892459509125447680 2017-08-01 18:58:22 UTC <hoagy114> @benshapiro But how did it get pregnant?
892165489690017792 2017-07-31 23:30:03 UTC <hoagy114> @DanielsOfficer @Mike_TheCop This is some funny crap!
890991347460706305 2017-07-28 17:44:25 UTC <hoagy114> @WBBMNewsradio Another way for him to funnel $$ to his family & friends, so the IRS has a harder time making a case.
890988256002703360 2017-07-28 17:32:08 UTC <hoagy114> @JoeBorelliNYC @GunOfBavaria Unfortunately this is going to slow down responses for the injured @ these incidents. I know a lot ofwon't be rushing in there either,
890754642103201793 2017-07-27 02:03:50 UTC <hoagy114> @MaxDPD @rondaviscp Wait until the city's health care costs skyrocket, he'll be looking for another job.
890752323089313792 2017-07-27 01:54:37 UTC <hoagy114> @ESPNNFL They need to learn how to control their children.  America is sick of cry baby millionaires. I hope the boycott continues.
890724505076862977 2017-07-27 00:04:05 UTC <hoagy114> @MentalAmmo These are the types of incidents that will change LE responses to somewhat routine calls. Please pray for his family & all the LE community.pic.twitter.com/vRDaOKmV6O
890702655395438596 2017-07-27 22:37:16 UTC <hoagy114> @ChristieC733 They should have the same care, who the hell are they? Politicians need term limits.
890701169529585665 2017-07-27 22:31:21 UTC <hoagy114> @Independent What is with you morons? You would be complaining if the police didn't do their jobs.
888394762767794177 2017-07-21 13:46:31 UTC <hoagy114> @BlondeinKevlar That's why we usually just hang with the Police
888394189632933892 2017-07-21 13:44:15 UTC <hoagy114> @s4ltypeter @GunOfBavaria The JFK assignation
888194380489797632 2017-07-20 00:30:16 UTC <hoagy114> @RPDOfficerChris Yep always fun, cold shower at the end of the night with a refreshing beer!
887505051526344704 2017-07-18 02:51:07 UTC <hoagy114> @AgentMahelona Our prayers are with you & your family. God bless you!
887502182521688073 2017-07-18 02:39:43 UTC <hoagy114> @OT_Enthusiast As little as possible
886757999511056384 2017-07-16 01:22:36 UTC <hoagy114> @RPDOfficerChris No with those pink checks and stupid grin you could be twins
885324103741308929 2017-07-12 02:24:49 UTC <hoagy114> @sgtbetsysmith A lot of dept.'s had DARE in multiple grades. It eliminated other programs the PD would have piton.
885272939687530496 2017-07-12 23:01:31 UTC <hoagy114> @alfranken @KidRock @YoSammyTSam Maybe he'll teach some of those old farts how to party hard. Maybe they'll realize it's time for them to LEAVE.
885150450118516737 2017-07-12 14:54:47 UTC <hoagy114> @ChicagosFines19 @Roy7410 @DogBreath1990 This is great video should be shown nationwide, America needs to wake up.
884979189815947264 2017-07-11 03:34:15 UTC <hoagy114> @bigricanman Obviously great parenting skills. Apparently " the village raised him wrong".
884978487735586819 2017-07-11 03:31:28 UTC <hoagy114> @Sergeant_Joe Bullshit they are awake, I'm calling bullshit, they can't stay awake past 9 pm.
884977185924186112 2017-07-11 03:26:17 UTC <hoagy114> @BlondeinKevlar I'm going with the USSR.
884616505027174401 2017-07-10 03:33:04 UTC <hoagy114> @ChristieC733 @RealJamesWoods That is funnier than hell. Who comes up with this shit? Really?
884585524115243008 2017-07-10 01:29:58 UTC <hoagy114> @RookieCityCop My first Sgts exam with 3 years on I made 2nd on the written. I didn't get promoted for another 17 years!
884585070933286912 2017-07-10 01:28:10 UTC <hoagy114> @GunOfBavaria Whether or not your surgery sets you up for the next 6 months..."I'll be home for Christmas"
884583755511476224 2017-07-10 01:22:56 UTC <hoagy114> @SuburbanFiveOh Prosecutors are all about politics, they don't give a rats ass about you or anything else than making themselves look good.
884261987647139840 2017-07-09 04:04:21 UTC <hoagy114> @StarkSheriff @Mperfectwarrior @MajorNews911 May he make a fast recovery, our hearts to out to his family & his agency.
884118716010684416 2017-07-09 18:35:02 UTC <hoagy114> @BlueLineRookie Your assuming that are going to chase someone.
883879020349329408 2017-07-08 02:42:34 UTC <hoagy114> @sheLLbeLL_xo Next time come over and say "Hello" that would make the day better 
883678648406085632 2017-07-08 13:26:22 UTC <hoagy114> @OT_Enthusiast Who minding those thousands of cameras? The last time I was there it was 2 guys, that was very funny.
883678126399729664 2017-07-08 13:24:17 UTC <hoagy114> @DETECTIVE4LIFE You need a caption
883677777567916032 2017-07-08 13:22:54 UTC <hoagy114> @ToewsNews Damn! Good to see hockey salaries catching up with the other sports, still way too much money.
883677165212098560 2017-07-08 13:20:28 UTC <hoagy114> @BlondeinKevlar @RookieCityCop If either one of you don't take it and complain about management then you have become part of the problem. Be a part of the solution.
883478350177632256 2017-07-07 00:10:27 UTC <hoagy114> @Dblhuh @abluecanary @LouHayesJr But thank God you guys are accredited!
883384756129460224 2017-07-07 17:58:33 UTC <hoagy114> @ShenanigansFL Everyone has died, AED is a whole other story
882602028056424448 2017-07-05 14:08:16 UTC <hoagy114> @CNN Sorry, you are not even a little creditable.
882601684937179141 2017-07-05 14:06:54 UTC <hoagy114> @Chief_KZiman Tattoos can be offensive and makes some people very standoffish. There is more than enough skin that is covered by the uniform to use.
882574446451712000 2017-07-05 12:18:40 UTC <hoagy114> @ToewsNews Johnny you are up about early this morning!
882573020350566402 2017-07-05 12:13:00 UTC <hoagy114> Some are calling this part of a Civil War movement. It is an attack on civility , upon our Society as a whole. Wake up America!https://twitter.com/usatoday/status/882566081986142209
882569195552223232 2017-07-05 11:57:48 UTC <hoagy114> @neonorchid1 As always ... WOW!
882412212991688708 2017-07-04 01:34:00 UTC <hoagy114> @RevJesseJackson @dmihalopoulos Jackson like Sharpton like to keep their names in news every so often, it makes them feel relevant. Of course money works well too.
882295114244251650 2017-07-04 17:48:42 UTC <hoagy114> @LadyCopHikes He was a lawyer & John Marshall law professor, who obviously never of Terry V Ohio. Nothing ever came of it.
882294408753938432 2017-07-04 17:45:53 UTC <hoagy114> @LadyCopHikes I actually handed my card to a guy saying get it right for the lawsuit (smart ass me) & he did. He sued me and the municipality.
881946578067566592 2017-07-03 18:43:44 UTC <hoagy114> @Trumpified_King @skin1diva @politidiva @SheriffClarke @POTUS @DanSlezak2 That can not be a real sign.
881873873960148992 2017-07-03 13:54:50 UTC <hoagy114> @Acosta It is sad the media is / has been encouraging the war on police. America deserves real journalism not the crap being spewed every day.
881734535058247680 2017-07-02 04:41:09 UTC <hoagy114> @HockeyRenegade That is a big request, keep drinking.

881162549168832516 2017-07-01 14:48:17 UTC <hoagy114> @LouHayesJr Like when the ISP left a car on I-88 and the dirt, coffee cups & Dunkin Donuts boxes were hanging all over it?
881162116228677633 2017-07-01 14:46:34 UTC <hoagy114> @neonorchid1 It is always better to give than receive 
881161851865882624 2017-07-01 14:45:31 UTC <hoagy114> @LouHayesJr PD's often look at how to minimize situations. Politics is always in play, even if someone is really pissed that is a lot is shots.

880793081343340544 2017-06-30 14:20:09 UTC <hoagy114> @RealJamesWoods Apparently they have figured out that the print media is dying all together. Oh and there is that lying thing as well.

879468740408225794 2017-06-26 22:37:42 UTC <hoagy114> @nypost I'm surprised the @ACLU hasn't filed a suit against this yet. How dare he....
877862602654830592 2017-06-22 12:15:29 UTC <hoagy114> @GunOfBavaria New officers are not comfortable talking to people or going hands on. The video games they played never required it.
877859438652252160 2017-06-22 12:02:54 UTC <hoagy114> @GoodieDickman Politicians always ensure their funds are paid monthly. IMRF is a fully funded pension system, amazing they can do it themselves, huh.
877858945729253376 2017-06-22 12:00:57 UTC <hoagy114> @GoodieDickman Pensions are sustainable however since the municipalities are not mandatorily required make payments this happens "panic occurs".
877612713672925184 2017-06-21 19:42:30 UTC <hoagy114> @WGNNews What happened to reporting news, not crap. No one cares about this stuff except maybe Larry.
876841376478089216 2017-06-19 16:37:29 UTC <hoagy114> @ToewsNews Probably not a lot.
876827686898946048 2017-06-19 15:43:05 UTC <hoagy114> @ABC7Chicago You guys need to work on news stories, no one cares about this crap. Look at what you have become, you all should be embarrassed, silliness.

876610428125806593 2017-06-18 01:19:47 UTC <hoagy114> @GunOfBavaria Sounds like a hooker on a tight schedule...

875162565701226496 2017-06-14 01:26:30 UTC <hoagy114> Every day Police Officers risk their lives as the heros did today in Virginia. Keep them & all 1st responders in your thoughts & prayers.
874806989838221312 2017-06-13 01:53:34 UTC <hoagy114> @GunOfBavaria A week? Man you guys get great service!
874806803787382784 2017-06-13 01:52:49 UTC <hoagy114> @GunOfBavaria Outside carriers are the only way to go.
874802870494932992 2017-06-13 01:37:12 UTC <hoagy114> @Mike_TheCop @RookieCityCop How my recruit on an open mic rushing back to the station screaming "I'm fucking crowning, that's why I'm driving like this".
874454049466327041 2017-06-12 02:31:06 UTC <hoagy114> @Mperfectwarrior @MajorNews911 May the Lord our God, look after his family. May he help his friends in the healing process. This madness has to stop! RIP brother we got itpic.twitter.com/Tl14lgKcVk
874442834627178497 2017-06-12 01:46:32 UTC <hoagy114> @michelle_furlow This will only create problems in the future. Political influence creates these problems not cops.
874442454375825410 2017-06-12 01:45:02 UTC <hoagy114> @LouHayesJr Most dept's can name someone who created a policy. Legends in their own minds...
874439751230738434 2017-06-12 01:34:17 UTC <hoagy114> @YoSammyTSam @SuburbanFiveOh Socking... it is not live on TV giving parking tickets to soccer moms? No CSI's WTF!

874081006470475776 2017-06-11 01:48:46 UTC <hoagy114> @LadyCopHikes Start the FD for an evaluation in the grocery store parking lot fender bender...yeah I know it's 03:30
874077603434508288 2017-06-11 01:35:14 UTC <hoagy114> @abluecanary @Breaking911 She should die as that poor child did. What a horrible death.
873544442275393536 2017-06-10 14:16:39 UTC <hoagy114> @rallenMI At major events they have been used as weapons. They are even banned in Disney  world.

871535226283077633 2017-06-04 01:12:44 UTC <hoagy114> @MSNBC @ChristieC733 Maybe they should be the police for a while instead of a bunch of diarrhea mouths with no brain,
871508712686587904 2017-06-04 23:27:23 UTC <hoagy114> @GemMar333 @jojoh888 @DETECTIVE4LIFE Under federal law retired LE can carry weapons with annual qualifications. Over 6500 in Illinois alone.
871506675328569344 2017-06-04 23:19:17 UTC <hoagy114> @LouHayesJr Some many philosophical ideas floating around. Interpretation by everyone creates part of the problem. Life experiences will also influence.
871503505751756801 2017-06-04 23:06:42 UTC <hoagy114> @CillizzaCNN @CNN I have a scoop for you, Hillary the liar, is still not the President. Why can't you treat everyone objectively?

869928111550464001 2017-05-31 14:46:38 UTC <hoagy114> @MMFlint And BHO is the reason for the war on Law Enforcment, I don't see you denouncing the ass!  Grow up & try to live in the real world.
868467297526198272 2017-05-27 14:01:53 UTC <hoagy114> @BlueLineRookie You gotta love stupidity, it is job security

867559594721251328 2017-05-24 01:55:00 UTC <hoagy114> @Mperfectwarrior @SDSheriff Apparently you guys are overstaffed, I don't on any agency that could train that many people to do that. Waste of taxpayers money.
867110255767027717 2017-05-23 20:09:29 UTC <hoagy114> @AP Great job by the Officers!
866380923608195073 2017-05-21 19:51:23 UTC <hoagy114> @WNDU Well then they should not issue their diplomas. Political statement or being respectful won't they have fun in the real world?
866069620796665857 2017-05-20 23:14:23 UTC <hoagy114> @debdog @BlondeinKevlar I'm sorry that just seems wrong

865610315861565444 2017-05-19 16:49:16 UTC <hoagy114> @SuburbanFiveOh Sounds like A.D. may occur if you are around...
864880860427935745 2017-05-17 16:30:40 UTC <hoagy114> @Night_Stripes Believe me it is worth all the crap you have & will put up with.
864879150003257345 2017-05-17 16:23:52 UTC <hoagy114> @GunOfBavaria Shoot me now, no one ever remembers that stuff.
864627716238319616 2017-05-16 23:44:46 UTC <hoagy114> @PeterRoskam @dailyherald What about the shooting at theHigh School last week, what happened there?
864606543693611008 2017-05-16 22:20:38 UTC <hoagy114> @cbschicago What a jerk, time for him to get locked up. Being drunk is no excuse.
864603374188154880 2017-05-16 22:08:02 UTC <hoagy114> @ofctimallen You stand shows that Hollywood is really out of touch with reality.
864599475800748034 2017-05-16 21:52:33 UTC <hoagy114> @BlueLineRookie Double cuff case is very hard to wear
863509177234227201 2017-05-13 21:40:05 UTC <hoagy114> @LouHayesJr @Academy911 That pic of Lou, he looks like he is trying to shit standing up.
863508135293616128 2017-05-13 21:35:57 UTC <hoagy114> @LouHayesJr That picture is hilarious!
862815384164020225 2017-05-11 23:43:12 UTC <hoagy114> @SuburbanFiveOh Come on that can't be real?
862815161203253248 2017-05-11 23:42:19 UTC <hoagy114> @neonorchid1 Who wouldn't have fun with that?
862814810689466368 2017-05-11 23:40:55 UTC <hoagy114> @OfficerMorton Congrats, always remember where you came from. Good Friends will remind you if they have too
862814364264484865 2017-05-11 23:39:09 UTC <hoagy114> @TxAgSheepdog Society is way out of control. People do not want to accept responsibility for their actions. Way too much pampering of these assholes.
862813222876979200 2017-05-11 23:34:37 UTC <hoagy114> @BlondeinKevlar Good for I hope you enjoyed them... the movies that is.
862812162410020865 2017-05-11 23:30:24 UTC <hoagy114> @foxandfriends Apparent the @NYPDnews did their job! Some liberal judge wil award him $$. This shit has gone way too far.
862473295970619393 2017-05-10 01:03:52 UTC <hoagy114> @NOAA - Hurricane season is upon us. Everyone should be prepared to react. Have a  Crisis Response Action Plan. C.R.A.P. is necessary!
861270914415120384 2017-05-07 17:26:02 UTC <hoagy114> @Academy911 @BreakingNLive This is not gonna play out well!
860854738098814976 2017-05-06 13:52:18 UTC <hoagy114> Because free speech in America only exists if they agree with you. Spoiled generation of everyone gets a trophy,
860854151613472768 2017-05-06 13:49:58 UTC <hoagy114> @bigricanman I'm in as well we can do it cheaper
860667928936677377 2017-05-05 01:29:59 UTC <hoagy114> @HockeyRenegade If you need help removing the hair from your neckline I'm sure you could find volunteers. Pick me !
860646727002542081 2017-05-05 00:05:44 UTC <hoagy114> @drknstormynite Those are not real boots, real ones could be sprayed off with water.
860237129124904960 2017-05-04 20:58:08 UTC <hoagy114> @Door_Kicker1032 I think Pandora's box will be opened, not everyone has made wise choices throughout their life time or before they came on the job.
860235017154416642 2017-05-04 20:49:45 UTC <hoagy114> @GeorgiaDirtRoad @Ms_Erika74 What exactly does that mean they have eliminated their health care? I can't believe that is true.
860225806517317633 2017-05-04 20:13:09 UTC <hoagy114> @GunOfBavaria It is amazing that it happens so much, lazy people generational issues.
860225370611744771 2017-05-04 20:11:25 UTC <hoagy114> @neonorchid1 You must be a linerge model incredible stuff.
860224983884288001 2017-05-04 20:09:53 UTC <hoagy114> @RookieCityCop It do generational it scares me a lot
860222978474352640 2017-05-04 20:01:54 UTC <hoagy114> @bigricanman Manipulation of data is generally hard to do, especially in larger agencies. Over policed areas are a myth, there are based upon calls etc
859911249299218433 2017-05-03 23:23:12 UTC <hoagy114> @ABC7Chicago Nice donation from guy who only worked on a government payroll...I think I need to run for office.
859844671719301121 2017-05-03 18:58:39 UTC <hoagy114> @WEdwarda Get some rest
859576329083248640 2017-05-02 01:12:21 UTC <hoagy114> @ChrisCoon4 He should give back obamas bs medal and move to Mexico never to take another American dollar!
859572631921729536 2017-05-02 00:57:40 UTC <hoagy114> @foxandfriends If this is true the FBI needs to rethink its training programs, ALOT!
859388995285000193 2017-05-02 12:47:57 UTC <hoagy114> @Ummm_Nope_ It means you are getting better.
858472102642495491 2017-04-29 00:04:33 UTC <hoagy114> @OT_Enthusiast I'll bet all those cars wind up in either the south or west sides. Nothing ever changes.
858112582493888512 2017-04-28 00:15:57 UTC <hoagy114> @markwbennett @NationOfFrogs @LouHayesJr Yes, but sorry to say politics and egos (I know it scares me too) create the problem. That is very difficult to explain / comprehend.
858110276713013248 2017-04-28 00:06:47 UTC <hoagy114> @OT_Enthusiast NO, no fucking way!
858109910512545795 2017-04-28 00:05:20 UTC <hoagy114> @BlondeinKevlar The average person is a complete freaking moron, keep that on mind. The rest are just lemmings!
858108624572473344 2017-04-28 00:00:13 UTC <hoagy114> @MMFlint Mike, why are you upset that would help you? Or didn't your "people" explain that to you before you tweeted?
858107583588118529 2017-04-28 23:56:05 UTC <hoagy114> @bigricanman They use Ferguson b/c they have someone they can try to blame. Can't use Chgo, because we can't blame BHO or Rahm that is not PC. Wake up!
858104849212342272 2017-04-28 23:45:13 UTC <hoagy114> @markwbennett @NationOfFrogs @LouHayesJr Undercover officers assisting in operations are necessary to a point, they are looking for different things than reg cops.
857653594396524544 2017-04-27 17:52:05 UTC <hoagy114> @AnnCoulter You should contact the @ACLU , aren't they the defenders of speech? Just silliness that is going on throughout this entire country.
857652534617546753 2017-04-27 17:47:53 UTC <hoagy114> @OT_Enthusiast Do they have police authority? If not what is the big deal they should not " play police".
857407718608515072 2017-04-26 01:35:04 UTC <hoagy114> With all the shootings of LEO's recently, may we keep them in our thoughts & prayers. Pray for the all our families in this community.pic.twitter.com/KgWvM928WG

857367702888960000 2017-04-26 22:56:04 UTC <hoagy114> @BlondeinKevlar Trying to hang on to their youth
856892345605816320 2017-04-25 15:27:10 UTC <hoagy114> @RookieCityCop Obviously you " connected" with him. Sometimes it is just a job!
856871883282800641 2017-04-25 14:05:51 UTC <hoagy114> @RDKLaborLaw @LouHayesJr Options are great it would be very difficult to word in  a metropolitan area. In a rural area much easier.
856870380346241025 2017-04-25 13:59:53 UTC <hoagy114> @RDKLaborLaw @LouHayesJr The circumstances would be no narrow that they would barely exist. When a round is discharged it has go somewhere. Cops Thinking logically?
856854692592222209 2017-04-25 12:57:32 UTC <hoagy114> @RDKLaborLaw Why do we keep going back to old ideas that are just stupid?
856188514660167680 2017-04-23 16:50:23 UTC <hoagy114> @Reuters Perhaps he could work on all the shootings that occur daily in the city. Sometimes I crack myself up!
856182360462807040 2017-04-23 16:25:56 UTC <hoagy114> @LouHayesJr I think the symbols need to be explained.
855244913813925893 2017-04-20 02:20:51 UTC <hoagy114> @LouHayesJr The need to address the symptoms for everyone to readily identify because that is the real problem.

854334323327217666 2017-04-18 14:02:30 UTC <hoagy114> @RealJamesWoods Her face reminds me of a horse.
854321290987143168 2017-04-18 13:10:42 UTC <hoagy114> @privateofficer The costs to start & maintain an operation  is extremely expensive. In the long run it's cheaper & more efficient to "hire back" police.
854108289168265216 2017-04-17 23:04:19 UTC <hoagy114> @bluelinedana Everything!
854108111807950848 2017-04-17 23:03:37 UTC <hoagy114> @EnergyCitizens Fracking in Florida jeopardizes the entire state and its economy. This should not be allowed. The state is basically sand with minimal dirt.

853781495663796226 2017-04-16 01:25:45 UTC <hoagy114> @HockeyRenegade That would be the NHL

849846441380122626 2017-04-05 04:49:15 UTC <hoagy114> @GunOfBavaria Wait till you are working with one of them and they call you "Dad". It will really piss you off, perhaps you are older than them?

849653975582420992 2017-04-05 16:04:28 UTC <hoagy114> @HockeyRenegade Without a picture I can not believe that this is true
849653398135869441 2017-04-05 16:02:10 UTC <hoagy114> @chicagotribune @RepGutierrez This is not something that should even matter. This guy should play by the rules established for the process. Why are we paying for this?
849650509451583488 2017-04-05 15:50:41 UTC <hoagy114> @TxAgSheepdog Hurley is still incredible!
849647759972020224 2017-04-05 15:39:46 UTC <hoagy114> @fox32news @RepGutierrez Actions have consequences, Dad needs to take his family from where he came.  When you make laws we have to deal with the aftermath, huh?
849639205030506498 2017-04-05 15:05:46 UTC <hoagy114> @SuburbanFiveOh I had a putter lots of golf courses!

847493480117018625 2017-03-30 16:59:25 UTC <hoagy114> @BlondeinKevlar the best time in my career was undercover. It was challenging & fun a very different mindset is needed.
847492735523184641 2017-03-30 16:56:28 UTC <hoagy114> @LouHayesJr not in field training, those questions should allow the recurit to start think about his training, law & ethical situations,
847491994507235329 2017-03-30 16:53:31 UTC <hoagy114> @BlondeinKevlar we used to use the Cops theme song at times, old Carpenter songs can be annoying as well.

846237834088468480 2017-03-26 05:49:56 UTC <hoagy114> @GunOfBavaria it gets gang bangers money by hanging out with kids who work hard at the sport.
846237238220509185 2017-03-26 05:47:34 UTC <hoagy114> @SuburbanFiveOh those that do not leave are not allowing those who CAN do the job do it. It is not a old mans job, they need realize that.

845694383261466626 2017-03-25 17:50:27 UTC <hoagy114> @thefirstyearcop getting to retirement is the greatest reward of our profession! I but up with the shit but now reap the rewards.
845694048987992064 2017-03-25 17:49:08 UTC <hoagy114> @thefirstyearcop hang in there, it is difficult at times but try to look at the stupid acts of these people as a comedy show, it will help.
845692630826700800 2017-03-25 17:43:30 UTC <hoagy114> @BlondeinKevlar take her to the range she will have fun!

844575285966180353 2017-03-22 15:43:34 UTC <hoagy114> @MCPS calling this a serious incident is ridiculous. Call it what it is, yeah that's right liberals want to hide shit. Time to quit Jack!
844572990448775169 2017-03-22 15:34:26 UTC <hoagy114> @MMFlint apparently you weren't live for Watergate?

844570022823579653 2017-03-22 15:22:39 UTC <hoagy114> @BlondeinKevlar perhaps he was trying to be like his Chief?
843988669308583942 2017-03-20 00:52:33 UTC <hoagy114> @LouHayesJr you guys could do an ad for 5.11
843950278772740100 2017-03-20 22:20:00 UTC <hoagy114> @RepGutierrez if they are already breaking our laws why should they be allowed to stay? What other countries allow this?
843946149551771650 2017-03-20 22:03:36 UTC <hoagy114> @LilyRoseLynn and all the wanna be's will buy it up like crazy. Those idiots think her show is real life...

842491408888074240 2017-03-16 21:42:59 UTC <hoagy114> @bluelivesmtr the losers who made the videos should be charged for failing to provide aid, if they were physically capable.
842246202804563968 2017-03-15 05:28:37 UTC <hoagy114> @OkieGirl405 it really sucks, you become the parent and it creates some weird times, Good Luck
842244915790782465 2017-03-15 05:23:30 UTC <hoagy114> @ChicagoBreaking they are very difficult to read. If they are as crappy as the old ones what is the pint of issuing them just hand SOS $$.

824751136703864832 2017-01-26 22:49:28 UTC <hoagy114> @TxAgSheepdog @Leistunghund you guys should have driven the Chevy Impalas "da boat" now that was much better than the crown Vic.
824675303486152704 2017-01-26 17:48:08 UTC <hoagy114> @FCC could you explain to me why tv & Internet commercials are so much louder than he rest on the content, it appears to be getting worse.
824502492973068288 2017-01-25 06:21:27 UTC <hoagy114> @OT_Enthusiast we have used it for several years without any issues.

824498159715913729 2017-01-25 06:04:14 UTC <hoagy114> @ACLU where was your outrage as Obama signed hundreds of executive orders?
824125186442219520 2017-01-24 05:22:10 UTC <hoagy114> @realDonaldTrump we can ensure Social Security will be forever solvent if we remove the wage cap completely. It's time for everyone to help.
824103097559416832 2017-01-24 03:54:24 UTC <hoagy114> @realDonaldTrump @greeneyes0084 and sensors under the wall for when they "dig in".

823939533217480705 2017-01-24 17:04:27 UTC <hoagy114> @MarkLTomlin @SheriffClarke he is preparing to run for office why else would he be acting like he is. Probably hoped for a cabinet spot.
823937292737789952 2017-01-24 16:55:33 UTC <hoagy114> @SuburbanFiveOh perhaps they have heard of your work& are looking for business... or never mind that is a FOIA.
823739645892562944 2017-01-23 03:50:10 UTC <hoagy114> @Lrihendry she is not retiring if she is what is your source. She did a tv interview today and never said she was leaving.

823578119269294080 2017-01-23 17:08:19 UTC <hoagy114> @annoyedispatchr you tend to tell it like it is
823402201829650432 2017-01-22 05:29:17 UTC <hoagy114> @lacymacauley perhaps they should have thought about their actions first? Protesters do not have to morons, but I'm sure they will survive.

822577863073402880 2017-01-20 22:53:39 UTC <hoagy114> @MMFlint since you have the money you should pay for the damages being caused by you inviting riotous acts. If I had a say it would be jail.

821595933376921605 2017-01-17 05:51:49 UTC <hoagy114> @DarkDispatch outsourcing & the consolidation of PSAPS created the situation.

821481477263134720 2017-01-17 22:17:01 UTC <hoagy114> @RealJamesWoods maybe the Clinton Foundation should buy them and send them to Haiti? Them they can say they helped.
821480287704006656 2017-01-17 22:12:17 UTC <hoagy114> @chicagotribune this is a joke the POS Obama is tell Snowden come on home all is forgiven it is the Hillary defense! UNBELIEVABLE!

821198681302929409 2017-01-16 03:33:17 UTC <hoagy114> @nocturnalE911 it is that 3/4 second wait that screws everything up. Technology can really slow things down instead of helping.
821081092803338240 2017-01-16 19:46:02 UTC <hoagy114> @FoxNews the Clinton Foundation required an independent investigation if wrong doing is discovered it should be prosecuted .
821053741180719107 2017-01-16 17:57:20 UTC <hoagy114> @MMFlint you need a life, it must be nice to have money and not live in the real world.

820887512222576640 2017-01-15 06:56:48 UTC <hoagy114> @NatPoliceAssoc it goes to show you what a piece of crap this organization actually is. These do gooders need to get real jobs / lives.
820855420185022464 2017-01-15 04:49:17 UTC <hoagy114> @WGNNews another looser who doesn't understand that everyone needs to work together in order to accomplish anything! He should resign!

780110363798929408 2016-09-25 18:22:59 UTC <hoagy114> @BlueAlertUs and the parole board ignores this because they have no spine.
779461083111186433 2016-09-23 23:22:58 UTC <hoagy114> @chuckwoolery @Lrihendry this proves that journalistic integrity is something that no longer exists. The country needs somebody to help us.

779073685210722304 2016-09-22 21:43:35 UTC <hoagy114> @Pamela836 they should determine everyone's losses, then sue them for that plus 500 million for emotional stress.
778800570744221696 2016-09-21 03:38:20 UTC <hoagy114> @HillaryClinton why don't you address the violence in Chicago they are killing your voters? No refugees ie terrorists allowed in the USA
778788273552359424 2016-09-21 02:49:28 UTC <hoagy114> @ChristiChat why don't they start investigating the shootings in Chicago? #POTUS doesn't see black on black violence as an issue that's why!
778780894286929920 2016-09-21 02:20:08 UTC <hoagy114> @chicagotribune why are you not letting this play out in court, please quit being part of the problem journalist integrity is all but lost.

778773363351179264 2016-09-21 01:50:13 UTC <hoagy114> @HillaryClinton we need a a real POTUS who will stand up and tell everyone we don't use social media to try cases. Obama created a race war
778284863887671297 2016-09-20 17:29:06 UTC <hoagy114> @chicagotribune he should go on vacation again he is just pushing more racism throughout our country, similar to MSM
778258373703794688 2016-09-20 15:43:50 UTC <hoagy114> @Trib_ed_board @chicagotribune can you explain how Snowden's situation is different from Hillary's? I am deeply confused about this.

777301897631952896 2016-09-17 00:23:08 UTC <hoagy114> @WGNNews perhaps they should patrol the streets of Chicago to show their real support, instead of insulting the country, #BoycottTheNFL
777298243067797508 2016-09-17 00:08:37 UTC <hoagy114> @WestJournalism @Pamela836 I have been saying all along boycott the @NFL these losers only caste about your money. Millionaires being asses

777247607198457856 2016-09-17 20:47:24 UTC <hoagy114> @andieiamwhoiam @AnthonyCortese8 perhaps they think the government should give them a job driving for NASCAR, like they do for a lot of stuf

771171613152645120 2016-08-31 02:23:34 UTC <hoagy114> @NoFilter911 the money sounded good but the reality as it got closer made me want to vomit!
770461833895510016 2016-08-29 03:23:10 UTC <hoagy114> @MikeTobinFox @DwyaneWade @greta why don't we pay them to stop shooting each other like we did in the 60's, ask Bobby Rush we paid them off
770456917705646080 2016-08-29 03:03:38 UTC <hoagy114> @ChicagosFines19 apparently they have the same attitude as the #ChicagoTribune if they can't get headlines what is the point.
770450126783545344 2016-08-29 02:36:39 UTC <hoagy114> @PaulKonrad now the will offer the generic at 1/2 price but at the inflated price, Congressional over sight what a joke
770400024844988416 2016-08-29 23:17:33 UTC <hoagy114> @ABC7Chicago he should put his money where his mouth is and quit being a dramatic POS. Thousands have their lives for the US, honor them
769611874484776960 2016-08-27 19:05:44 UTC <hoagy114> @nypostsports what a moron time to leave the country and his salary, doesn't he know #POTUS is creating more racial divide than him
769608782703894528 2016-08-27 18:53:27 UTC <hoagy114> @WGNNews why isn't BLM saying or protesting anything? It must be that they accept black on black crime. They can't headlines on this topic!
769605774322626560 2016-08-27 18:41:29 UTC <hoagy114> @greta if he doesn't like it he can leave the country and his salary here, what a POS!

767193425758355456 2016-08-20 02:55:41 UTC <hoagy114> @nytopinion @nytimes the black community has yet to recover from LBJ and your worried about Trump? Something here is not right?
766733001573044224 2016-08-19 20:26:07 UTC <hoagy114> @netflix who is this guy ?
766417581817290752 2016-08-18 23:32:45 UTC <hoagy114> @greta No if this happened in the US people would want blood

766298137585528833 2016-08-18 15:38:07 UTC <hoagy114> @greta I'm sure Obama & the Clinton Foundation will be taken care of down the road. America is For Sale by the Democrats
765988030276448256 2016-08-17 19:05:52 UTC <hoagy114> @greta seriously YES

764897309465284608 2016-08-14 18:51:44 UTC <hoagy114> @tariqnasheed an execution? Better look that up, self defense is more likely, but let's riot & let sm take control no investigation needed?
764892676353241088 2016-08-14 18:33:19 UTC <hoagy114> @SCarson_News it shows the stupidity of machine politics

763726761003716609 2016-08-11 13:20:23 UTC <hoagy114> @larryelder @SheriffClarke Obama has created race wars in this country that will take years to fix. His hate for LE has made this even worse
763498688002060293 2016-08-10 22:14:06 UTC <hoagy114> @dcexaminer @jenilynn1001 Obama cover up is the Chicago Way that is how it has been done for generations, he is a part of the machine!
763251908517634049 2016-08-09 05:53:30 UTC <hoagy114> @nytimes apparently real unbiased reporting is a thing of the past, the Internet has forced $$ to drive your business model, grow a pair
763251173340028928 2016-08-09 05:50:34 UTC <hoagy114> @nytimes apparently real imbaisef
761555630608027648 2016-08-05 13:33:06 UTC <hoagy114> @nytimes media should NEVER use names of people who committed such acts, you are giving them notoriety that they seek. U can help stop this
761552239735562240 2016-08-05 13:19:37 UTC <hoagy114> @Fact after they get out of their lounge chairs, they go pee then look up address, blah, blah, blah and that's when they are fully awake
760876858762145792 2016-08-03 16:35:54 UTC <hoagy114> @jenilynn1001 @marcorubio @WSJSolomon talk about supporting terrorism, he has caused this country to be the joke of the world
760855207609786368 2016-08-03 15:09:52 UTC <hoagy114> @jenilynn1001 he should have gone and taken them back paying for crime nice precedent he set, he should resign
760453338987057152 2016-08-02 12:32:59 UTC <hoagy114> @PaulKonrad @WGNNews Paul he is in jail and complaining he has no rights, what is wrong in this country? Perhaps we need to change something
760452625275904000 2016-08-02 12:30:09 UTC <hoagy114> @lwfdnews urban renewal
760452002056810496 2016-08-02 12:27:40 UTC <hoagy114> @jenilynn1001 if the police leave & she harms the baby, the family sues b/c the police didn't do their jobs even more national outrage!
760207336589889536 2016-08-01 20:15:27 UTC <hoagy114> @wyomingpd @jjwills2 it is the politicians that set the speed limits, engr's only make recommendations
758332271174754304 2016-07-27 16:04:37 UTC <hoagy114> @hillary @WGNNews the kids were victims of Black on Black crime, police reforms? Can we say bait & switch @Hillary

753988294782906368 2016-07-15 16:23:12 UTC <hoagy114> @ABC7Chicago this guy is a genius he doesn't mention they are killing each other. He blames the police. USSS should way away from him.
752628945460273152 2016-07-11 22:21:38 UTC <hoagy114> @PoliceMag that is incredible Obama should be thrown out of office
752536837936128000 2016-07-11 16:15:38 UTC <hoagy114> @nytimes this is what the Police have been saying all along. It is the media that is blowing everything up. They just want to sell stuff.
752283635147894784 2016-07-10 23:29:30 UTC <hoagy114> @ABC7Chicago why are all of the sudden  we teaching people to respect authority and do what they say isn't that the parents job?
751504912442200065 2016-07-08 19:55:08 UTC <hoagy114> @vanessa__7 perhaps you should have gone on there and gotten him
751500431273054208 2016-07-08 19:37:19 UTC <hoagy114> @chicagotribune yet he has the AG make statements while he remains relatively mute on the matter

751227999219953665 2016-07-07 01:34:46 UTC <hoagy114> @GeeDee215 @LouHayesJr @dworakt if people would listen to the police verbal commands there would be a lot less crap POTUS should be saying

694965712977145856 2016-02-03 19:28:32 UTC <hoagy114> @MarkLazerus it appears that there are less than 1400 votes here hardly a majority. Perhaps another 30,000 or so are needed.
