962555230087819265 2018-02-10 05:13:44 UTC <rich756> @fatherjonathan I have read what you have written. You are correct, Father. I apologize.
962405334508740609 2018-02-10 19:18:07 UTC <rich756> @fatherjonathan I'm saddened and embarrassed by "Churchmen" who reject the president's every word simply because they are his words. Stay independent and follow your own advice.
958923048287027205 2018-01-31 04:40:45 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ U.S. Bishops have an awful track record which is why they should be ignored.
939753304640253952 2017-12-09 07:07:02 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ Father, it looks like the President is also building bridges.pic.twitter.com/3O3ymIZNdQ
938701891432620032 2017-12-07 09:29:05 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ Father, you have got to be kidding me?
938663470639095808 2017-12-06 06:56:25 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ I guess radical Islam will be angry. I hope they don't blow up our embassy in Dar es Salaam or Nairobi. Wait they already did that and when our embassy was  in Tel Aviv??
935377568017952768 2017-11-27 05:19:25 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ Probably not christian to lie about your ancestry in order to use a minority status to enhance your position in life.
933239595440881666 2017-11-21 07:43:52 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ A mortal sin if you are a Republican but only a venial sin if you are a Democrat.
929580719109677056 2017-11-11 05:24:48 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ @Americaeditor President Barrack Obama has called the Supreme Leader a Hippo. Did you make any dopey comments about that? The Jesuits really should be silent on U S foreign policy.
927392558329688064 2017-11-05 04:29:50 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ @USCCB If the citizens didn't have guns many more people would have died.
926226417247051776 2017-11-02 23:16:00 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ It would have been better not to allow him in the country in the first place.
919791736859136000 2017-10-15 05:06:53 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ Father, rather than mute them and call them sinners, why not build a bridge with them?
918994672554467328 2017-10-13 00:19:38 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ Seventy year old men will no longer be covered for abortions! Now that's really mean-spirited, unchristian and those other judgemental words
906584435457384448 2017-09-09 18:25:47 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ 1 million immigrants legally enter the USA every year. No such signs in this great land.
904575548885577729 2017-09-03 05:23:11 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ Father, a warning against hypocrisy.  "They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other peoples shoulders...." Matthew 23.
904574567674290176 2017-09-03 05:19:17 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ Father, I find it funny that everyone who disagrees with you is a sinner but you are really just talking about politics not faith & morals.

885329471825379328 2017-07-12 02:46:09 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ Franken mocks  Jesus, and jokes about priesthood scandals. Is he the best teacher for us, Father.
884655903663734788 2017-07-10 06:09:38 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ I think the Senators came to Washington to clean up the mess that was created in the last 8 years.  Hope they are successful.
883123011615735808 2017-07-06 00:38:28 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ Charlie's fight @Fight4Charlie
883117691803914240 2017-07-06 00:17:19 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ The parents want to take Charlie to the USA. Why would the British government deny this and the Vatican support it?
880625354687238144 2017-06-29 03:13:40 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ Father, please consider how people from the impacted countries treat menbers of the LGBT community. A 90 day wait might be reasonable.
877813180822544384 2017-06-22 08:59:05 UTC <rich756> @Han_Bader How are you?
872623283316772864 2017-06-07 01:16:17 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ Very true, Father. That was demonstrated in the movie Moon Struck and also in a more recent movie, Spotlight.
862072012277071872 2017-05-09 22:29:18 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ Millions of Americans obtained access to health insurance with ACA but with $10,000 deductibles they received no access  to health care.
847345098102677504 2017-03-30 07:09:48 UTC <rich756> @JamesMartinSJ To tell Third World Nations not to develop fossil fuels is immoral and condemns them to continued poverty and suffering.
