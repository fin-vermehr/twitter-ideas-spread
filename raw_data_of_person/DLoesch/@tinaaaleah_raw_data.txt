964551461454696448 2018-02-16 17:26:03 UTC <tinaaaleah> @AshleySmashlaay @ashleyclaudi0 I believe that it shouldnt be so easy to go buy something that was designed to kill. Trust me, I know weapons are sold illegally.
964551032025083904 2018-02-16 17:24:21 UTC <tinaaaleah> Dating a white boy has opened my eyes to so many things... bigotry, unseasoned food, and conversations like thispic.twitter.com/Ms0EJE1UP2
964549190167736320 2018-02-16 17:17:02 UTC <tinaaaleah> @AshleySmashlaay @ashleyclaudi0 Bud, I know bad people exist. Im simply saying that if it is harder to buy guns, perhaps then it will discourage those bad people bc now you cant walk down the street and purchase a firearm.
964546796994383873 2018-02-16 17:07:31 UTC <tinaaaleah> @AshleySmashlaay @ashleyclaudi0 While this can be true, we can at the very least make it to where you have to go out of your way to locate an illegal gun salesman. But for now I guess well keep selling guns at Walmart no big deal.
964545392816934912 2018-02-16 17:01:56 UTC <tinaaaleah> If I see ANYBODY posting pictures with guns all proud-like, making suggestive comments, you are gettin reported. Politicians dont want to do their jobs right now so till some real action gets put into place, my eyes are peeled.
964531243613290496 2018-02-16 16:05:43 UTC <tinaaaleah> @allyyarid @danih0lle I dont completely agree with the message. You know I dont feel like its anyones responsibility to look out for the next murderer but the message of noticing the warning signs is still important
963524045592506368 2018-02-13 21:23:28 UTC <tinaaaleah> still salty about the v-day jeffs dad gave him $70 to take me out to dinner and this fool took me to canes so he could have money left for his off campus lunches at school
962784037298425857 2018-02-11 20:22:56 UTC <tinaaaleah> Instead of writing my research paper, Ive decided watching unsolved mysteries is a better use of my time
960318694466510848 2018-02-04 01:06:33 UTC <tinaaaleah> Dating a white boy is literally the worst decision Ive ever made in my entire life
956252402180440064 2018-01-24 19:48:33 UTC <tinaaaleah> Loved having Coach Wright at every race telling me to catch that girl in front of me, I am beyond blessed to have been one of his athletes.

935885995668639744 2017-11-29 14:59:43 UTC <tinaaaleah> I'm really curious to see how Fox News and other Trump apologists are going to excuse him retweeting racist propaganda

911667550852968448 2017-09-23 19:04:16 UTC <tinaaaleah> Soo NFL players can't exercise their right to free speech, but nazis can parade out in our streets and u claim they're some "very fine ppl"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/911654184918880260

878502777462427652 2017-06-23 06:39:18 UTC <tinaaaleah> Y'all ever try to have a level-headed conversation with someone with  differing opinions on twitter? It really is like talking to brick wall
878500187563577346 2017-06-23 06:29:01 UTC <tinaaaleah> @stresslessblu Don't agree with hunting predatory game \_()_/
878497956290334720 2017-06-23 06:20:09 UTC <tinaaaleah> @stresslessblu If you want to dm me actual proof of me causing the planet to die go ahead. Cause man I'll stop if im the sole reason for our planet dying
878496993714335746 2017-06-23 06:16:19 UTC <tinaaaleah> @stresslessblu Yes, take it back quite a few years and animals were hunted mercilessly and their bodies left with no purpose to anyone.
878496588108369922 2017-06-23 06:14:42 UTC <tinaaaleah> @stresslessblu I'm not going to try to change yours
878496555489251328 2017-06-23 06:14:35 UTC <tinaaaleah> @stresslessblu Ok we have our different opinions. We're literally just restating the same thing over and over. You're not going to change my opinion
878496061991604224 2017-06-23 06:12:37 UTC <tinaaaleah> @stresslessblu One bullet when they don't realize it is more humane than the conditions many meat factories put the animals through
878495669216059394 2017-06-23 06:11:03 UTC <tinaaaleah> @stresslessblu Okay and I respect that choice. Humans have been hunting since the beginning of time and I don't see a problem with it now.
878493724766072833 2017-06-23 06:03:20 UTC <tinaaaleah> @stresslessblu Bc I was gonna care about this dumb argument some more and bring up the videos of factories that abuse animals before butchering but o well
878493463381245952 2017-06-23 06:02:17 UTC <tinaaaleah> @stresslessblu I was just wondering if there was an even bigger divide between us, but anyways I can't get you to understand hunting if you don't want
878493062003077120 2017-06-23 06:00:42 UTC <tinaaaleah> @stresslessblu Too young to vote hon, but i woulda voted Clinton if I had the chance... how's this important?
878492724365807616 2017-06-23 05:59:21 UTC <tinaaaleah> @stresslessblu Are u vegan
878491950676135937 2017-06-23 05:56:17 UTC <tinaaaleah> @stresslessblu What did I do that only white people do lol
878491837283127296 2017-06-23 05:55:50 UTC <tinaaaleah> @stresslessblu Hunting is a more humane death. I think grocery store meat is scary, you don't know how the animal lived or died.
878491497037004800 2017-06-23 05:54:29 UTC <tinaaaleah> @stresslessblu I can't make you change your opinion. I just thought it was wrong this old dude was getting dragged for obtaining quite a few good meals.
878491307160866816 2017-06-23 05:53:43 UTC <tinaaaleah> @stresslessblu Did you forget how to spell quite?
878491160058236928 2017-06-23 05:53:08 UTC <tinaaaleah> @stresslessblu I mean if you want to go murder people for our own over population go ahead I guess?
878490837264543744 2017-06-23 05:51:51 UTC <tinaaaleah> @stresslessblu Honey what  ok I'm not arguing with y'all this is too ridiculous
878490078120751104 2017-06-23 05:48:50 UTC <tinaaaleah> Hunting keeps the population manageable. As well as offers a new source of meat for people rather than grocery store meats.
878489437856043008 2017-06-23 05:46:18 UTC <tinaaaleah> Then you'd know deer overpopulate quickly and have a negative impact on an important food and protection source for animals called grass
878489084443992065 2017-06-23 05:44:53 UTC <tinaaaleah> There's other things to do for wildlife, like actually doing something about real big game hunting.
878488627294216192 2017-06-23 05:43:04 UTC <tinaaaleah> Imagine being educated about something  before dragging some older dude on twitter for it 
878447499450744833 2017-06-23 02:59:39 UTC <tinaaaleah> @nasmaraj @G_meck40 @Son_ofJohn I'm gonna just drop this, I respect your choices, enjoy life man
878447379091001344 2017-06-23 02:59:10 UTC <tinaaaleah> @nasmaraj @G_meck40 @Son_ofJohn However, my family does regularly hunt deer and I'm a big fan of the leaner healthier meat.
878447112329076736 2017-06-23 02:58:06 UTC <tinaaaleah> @nasmaraj @G_meck40 @Son_ofJohn I know what you mean. I'm not a fan of big game hunting like with tigers and giraffes and such.
878446916190785539 2017-06-23 02:57:20 UTC <tinaaaleah> @mgallegos83 do I hear wedding bells?
878446890966298624 2017-06-23 02:57:14 UTC <tinaaaleah> @mgallegos83 tbh I'm wondering the same thing 
878426286066196481 2017-06-23 01:35:21 UTC <tinaaaleah> @nasmaraj @G_meck40 @Son_ofJohn My point is hunting is beneficial and there's no reason to bash people for it
878425823606341634 2017-06-23 01:33:31 UTC <tinaaaleah> @nasmaraj @G_meck40 @Son_ofJohn lmao what
878423385608527873 2017-06-23 01:23:50 UTC <tinaaaleah> @nasmaraj @G_meck40 @Son_ofJohn The gun is an investment for years of fresh meat. I don't want to argue, you're not a hunter you're not going to change ur opinion
878422900906356736 2017-06-23 01:21:54 UTC <tinaaaleah> @nasmaraj @G_meck40 @Son_ofJohn Bruh not joking, kill one deer and you have enough food to feet a family of 4 for like a year if you can stretch it.
878376069241425921 2017-06-23 22:15:49 UTC <tinaaaleah> @nasmaraj @G_meck40 @Son_ofJohn Yes the food was needed to feed their families. No life or death situation needed as an excuse to have better, cheaper food for his family.
878375649383239680 2017-06-23 22:14:08 UTC <tinaaaleah> @nasmaraj @G_meck40 @Son_ofJohn Maybe they wanted to make good use of their time and get food for their family
878372335639642112 2017-06-23 22:00:58 UTC <tinaaaleah> @DavidIRamadan Leave this dude alone. People hunt deer to eat them, it's cheaper, better meat for his family.
878372060615069696 2017-06-23 21:59:53 UTC <tinaaaleah> @DavidIRamadan @ezinneiwuagwu I'm sure these deer were eaten, and the 5 probably aren't all his but between the group
878371208764325889 2017-06-23 21:56:30 UTC <tinaaaleah> @nasmaraj @G_meck40 @Son_ofJohn Im sure the 5 were between all the ppl involved. There are regulations on hunting. It's not useless killing, sure families are being fed
878351458848133121 2017-06-23 20:38:01 UTC <tinaaaleah> He saved me a trip to medical school. He's the best https://twitter.com/putnamcityok/status/878341186687299585
878075439071330305 2017-06-22 02:21:13 UTC <tinaaaleah> After making it through 22 weeks w/o Jeff I thought any other time apart would be so much easier. Instead these 2 weeks are dragging

872151302125625346 2017-06-06 18:00:48 UTC <tinaaaleah> @cjwerleman The man shot 5 innocent people because he got sacked, terrorist attacks are politically motivated and typically get more coverage
