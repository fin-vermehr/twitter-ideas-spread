942584050849665025 2017-12-17 02:35:24 UTC <carlin924> @RealGlenMacnow @jelsesr I agree Jack. The defense needs to step it up for the playoffs or it will be one n done.
942578211459878912 2017-12-17 02:12:12 UTC <carlin924> It looked like the Steelers receiver was interfered with before the ball was near him on the last play!

940077284039450630 2017-12-10 04:34:24 UTC <carlin924> @AnnCoulter @lisa_bollman I agree. Very difficult to crawl while legs are crossed with your hands up and a high powered rifle pointed at you. The poor guy was scared shitless. Not sure why the police were there but it was not handled well at all.
940070540148072448 2017-12-10 04:07:37 UTC <carlin924> @FOX29philly I am not sure why the police were there with heavy duty fire arms. I guess they have to be ready for anything. Hard to see what the guy was doing when they shot him. Very sad and upsetting video.

797896822777729024 2016-11-13 20:20:01 UTC <carlin924> Would have been nice to get 7 last drive.
797896398599553024 2016-11-13 20:18:20 UTC <carlin924> @GarryCobb . Is Tom Brady the only qb that can do a keeper that close?! Wentz is big.
797890464376422400 2016-11-13 19:54:45 UTC <carlin924> @KristinChristy . Enjoy the game! Go Birds!

795337339203715072 2016-11-06 18:49:32 UTC <carlin924> @JimmyKempski I guess this is a rookie coach and qb learning process season. Ugh!
795333874758905856 2016-11-06 18:35:46 UTC <carlin924> @Eagles @mpan0519 should have been called. I guess it was a make up non-call for that 1st down spot.
