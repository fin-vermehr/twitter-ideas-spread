968928607270776832 2018-02-28 19:19:16 UTC <DatSmurtButtTho> @benshapiro @JustinDecker So we are pretending gun violence isnt just a scapegoat used by the left to ignore the fact that it is people that are violent? Bastille Day in Nice France where 80+ died by truck, or the mass stabbing that had 129 people die, or how about all of bombings. 911? #rockonNRA

961144287697231873 2018-02-06 07:47:10 UTC <DatSmurtButtTho> @benshapiro As being someone in a ROTC program and has been in many parades I think it would be rather cool to see a military parade. I guess the value of one isnt really considered by most people. Granted our military doesnt need to be paraded around.

That is just something people drag out when they havent looked into why he was medically exempt. I could get medically except for certain reasons which would not make me a draft dodger

950123356967329792 2018-01-07 21:53:55 UTC <DatSmurtButtTho> @TheDemocrats How about we elect people based on who we think will do the best for communities, States, and our Country? At the end of the day Im not going to look at any of that when I go to vote. If I dont agree with their policies, etc then Ill vote for the one I agree with.
947213261614800896 2017-12-30 21:10:14 UTC <DatSmurtButtTho> This is why we need to set a hard line for evidence when prosecuting these kinds of cases.

Oh wait I said something mean so that 1% will probably be after me too. Bratty bullies dont always get what they want and Pence wouldnt put America in a better situation.

943917107892375552 2017-12-21 18:52:30 UTC <DatSmurtButtTho> It is easy to complain about what you think others should be doing. Its also easy to expect others to do for you and complain when they do not do what you want them to do.
943916671621844993 2017-12-21 18:50:46 UTC <DatSmurtButtTho> I see all of these Tennesseans bashing @SenBobCorker for voting for the tax bill because of the expected rise in deficit. It makes me wonder when they are going to realize they could have been doing something to lower the deficit.
