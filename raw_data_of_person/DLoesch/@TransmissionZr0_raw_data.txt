There are 31 other teams to root for and other games on TV. What a shame. I hope some of the players speak out! #Texans #NFL @HoustonTexans @NFL @nflnetwork

970807725285396480 2018-03-05 23:46:13 UTC <TransmissionZr0> @Thomas1774Paine Its almost true. Letting Dick Chaney & the deep state to implement Record all the data, use it as a tool to expand budgets enormously & create the DHS... thats the worst part. Waste of money & unconstitutional!

It could be a set up BY the FBI to make you look bad so its best you recorded it and put it Twitter Death by a thousand cuts f that, you can only live normally. If real, you would have and have done the right thing anyways.

969897727021780997 2018-03-03 11:30:12 UTC <TransmissionZr0> I just took a personal stand for my freedom by joining NRA! You should too! https://membership.nra.org/Join/Annuals?utm_source=twitter  Why? Because the constitution! Our founding fathers knew the importance...and if we change it today, what part of the constitution is next?!

968607414290386944 2018-02-27 22:02:58 UTC <TransmissionZr0> @Thomas1774Paine They will be sued over this.

If the wasnt the case Id not waste my money and go android. Its too big of a premium. The privacy of my data is a second reason. I truly value their stance on building in anonymity.

967637196948889601 2018-02-24 05:47:40 UTC <TransmissionZr0> @Thomas1774Paine As an independent I support a single payer healthcare for all system. It is the most humane option. No one should fall into debt  and also the burden of debt on ones family because a family member got sick or cancer.

967212657274245120 2018-02-23 01:40:42 UTC <TransmissionZr0> @BetoORourke @MEscoJar Youre poorly misinformed. Please look into it more. Its the right thing to do, why should anyone ever go into debt because they got cancer (or sick period).

966647034555125761 2018-02-22 12:13:07 UTC <TransmissionZr0> @Snowden @KimDotcom I just saw the post... also references Jason Bourne movie ....  fake as shit, same thing happens when @JulianAssange goes quiet or tweets a hash.   Lights out, its midnight somewhere.  Pretty confident this is a dud.
966640719439056896 2018-02-22 11:48:01 UTC <TransmissionZr0> @KimDotcom Im not buying anything yet. There is always hysteria when @JulianAssange tweets out something cryptic or a hash.  I pray for all humankind there is nothing to be concerned about with @Snowden so Ill just let the hours or days pass while occasionally monitoring the situation. 
966522838864793600 2018-02-21 03:59:36 UTC <TransmissionZr0> @KimDotcom Never give in & accept it. All those who fought for independence of America are rolling over in their grave. On a world scale, its all for the better of humanity!! Freedom, liberty & the pursuit of happiness is not for sale!! (Despite what the power criminals believe).

886405213036441602 2017-07-15 02:00:46 UTC <TransmissionZr0> @ninaturner @zellieimani They're probably harassing this person and they happened to be away. So they do an illegal search to see what they can find or learn.

858435618606649346 2017-04-29 21:39:35 UTC <TransmissionZr0> @arstechnica Won't happen. To many decisions on this already, it's protected by the constitution & it will be overturned if judge rules for him to reveal
858435204905619458 2017-04-29 21:37:56 UTC <TransmissionZr0> @YesJulz You're wrong. They already can but self incrimination is a completely different story. The constitution was not meant to be flexible.
