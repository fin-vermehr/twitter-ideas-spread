971106108025769984 2018-03-06 19:31:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @StevenMoreau74 Have experienced that myself. Its difficult when its people you know and have known for a while as opposed to internet acquaintances who just live in your phone.

969577180526268416 2018-03-02 14:16:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The manner in which Trumpists excuse away anything that comes from him and his administration is always painfully predictable. Theyre not grounded in principles but personality. Closer to the behavior of Obama sycophants than theyll ever admit.

969419492408348672 2018-03-01 03:49:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DynamiteSyn @Nercamay And then they blocked me after this question. Odd 
969418350693699584 2018-03-01 03:45:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DynamiteSyn @Nercamay You said in another tweet that personhood is gradually achieved as one develops. A baby, toddler, teenager, adult, and the elderly are all at different stages. Why do you deny personhood to unique individuals with distinct DNA just because they're in the womb?
969414578152058881 2018-03-01 03:30:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DynamiteSyn I bet @Nercamay believes magic vagina dust transforms the unborn into a person. Or something.

969334693375172608 2018-03-01 22:12:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket @cauliflowerunit You spelled "broccoli" incorrectly in your bio.

The movement is diverse and very focused on helping women. As I said, the answer isn't to promote the death of their child.https://www.redstate.com/kimberly_ross/2017/06/28/viability-pro-life-movement-2017/
969326295514583040 2018-03-01 21:39:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @demsforlife @GrizzlyMan901 @dodgyrom The answer isn't killing their unborn.
969325987778449409 2018-03-01 21:38:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Imagine thinking the NRA kills but being totes fine with Democrats taking money from Planned Parenthood, a group that *actually* ends life.https://twitter.com/GStanley71/status/969325419446095872
969325108497190913 2018-03-01 21:34:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @demsforlife @GrizzlyMan901 @dodgyrom No, a consistent pro-life ethic is better. Abortion is a convenience-based decision. It is not health care. It is not necessary. I'm pro-woman and pro-baby. Perhaps you should try it.
969323552477532161 2018-03-01 21:28:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @demsforlife @dodgyrom @GrizzlyMan901 Well, it doesn't start by saying that the pro-life position kills considering most abortions are done in the 1st trimester. Let's be honest about that.
969323363876433923 2018-03-01 21:27:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Artist_Angie @molratty @rottencoreblah @ashley_peris Uh, what?
969322917669502977 2018-03-01 21:26:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @yogini74 @_dwendolis_ Sure, kiddo.
969322413811957761 2018-03-01 21:24:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @yogini74 @_dwendolis_ It's not at all contradictory. One is supporting innocent life. One is punishing the guilty. I'll continue to call myself pro-life AND support capital punishment, despite your input. :)
969315799268839424 2018-03-01 20:57:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Imagine saying this while your side supports the continual slaughter of unborn life through abortion, which has taken nearly 60 million individuals since Roe v Wade. https://twitter.com/dodgyrom/status/969315174552363009

969280864625594370 2018-03-01 18:39:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @yogini74 I support the death penalty in clear-cut cases. It is not contradictory to be pro-life and pro-capital punishment.  And you should speak to more pro-lifers. Ive never met anyone who is just pro-birth. That is a wildly incorrect talking point.

969237395190222849 2018-03-01 15:46:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket Haha. I'm thinking most people don't buy guns at Walmart or Fred Meyer, anyway.

968846932713115648 2018-02-28 13:54:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JennMGreenberg Devin Patrick Kelley killed 26 in Sutherland Springs. It was an absolute failure of reporting. He should not have had legal access to firearms.
968845028532596736 2018-02-28 13:47:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JennMGreenberg Precisely. Its almost impossible to have reasonable discussions about this issue. Personally, I think we need to strengthen the NICS reporting system, look at the use of gun violence restraining orders, etc. But no one is willing to begin anywhere, so we make zero progress.
968826805795917824 2018-02-28 12:34:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Because nothing says we truly care about addressing a problem! like a one-day boycott of companies with some sort of connection to a group that has as much to do with being responsible for gun deaths as I do.https://twitter.com/alyssa_milano/status/968514866842566662

967844216427765762 2018-02-25 19:30:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It was gutsy for @monacharenEPPC to say what she did in front of the CPAC audience. Much respect for her necessary bravery in calling out that putrid GOP hypocrisy. Well done.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/opinion/im-glad-i-got-booed-at-cpac.html

967784047186530304 2018-02-25 15:31:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Who says if ifs and buts were candy and nuts when asked about their department failing to properly address a self-described future school shooter?!! Does @ScottJIsrael think everything is a joke?  I feel bad for the people of Broward County. Wow.

967758841663324160 2018-02-25 13:51:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @waxtopia I watched curling! Its enjoyable. Not sure Id use the word exciting, though. 
967756246177763330 2018-02-25 13:40:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The Olympics were...underwhelming this year. I mean, besides all the media fawning over NK and obsession with Mike Pence. The actual competition and medal race was not very exciting.   Is it just me?

967579610425839616 2018-02-24 01:58:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RedState @mtoni93 Thank you :)
967565872717090816 2018-02-24 01:04:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> But have we asked Taylor Swift her opinion on it, yet. Because Im dying to know.
967556300627501056 2018-02-24 00:26:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @evan_manifesto @rezazia Not at all. An observation of your behavior. Have a good one.
967555460873248770 2018-02-24 00:22:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @evan_manifesto @rezazia If you side with and still defend Moore, that says a lot about you. And they're not positive things.
967554168809512960 2018-02-24 00:17:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @evan_manifesto @rezazia No, it lays out the case, giving several reasons why conservatives shouldn't support him. Moore lacks a spine. He also lacks a Senate seat. Works for me. ;)
967551668421349377 2018-02-24 00:07:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @evan_manifesto @rezazia You're not really a fan of substance, are you? Did you even read the article? And I repeat, I'm glad the Constitutionally-illiterate bigot lost.
967551280955740160 2018-02-24 00:06:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @evan_manifesto @rezazia No, the signature was Moore's. She added notes later. Big difference.
967550031774584833 2018-02-24 00:01:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Straight fire from @sarailola: "And until CPAC starts inviting guests who dont draw out the shadow lurkers who cant even celebrate the great opportunity this country offers to anyone who might want to legally join and help her grow, I wont be back."https://twitter.com/RedState/status/967536375032696833
967549691457146881 2018-02-24 23:59:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @evan_manifesto @rezazia Uh, what? They're staunch conservatives, and refreshingly, don't slobber over Trump and his sycophants. As the article indicates, there were MANY reasons not to support Moore...long before accusations. I'm glad he lost.
967546294473502720 2018-02-24 23:46:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rezazia @evan_manifesto Conservatives even thought so.https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/12/roy-moore-election-conservative-case-against-him/
967546089229385732 2018-02-24 23:45:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @heymikey80 And there was always more than one reason to not support a Constitutionally-illiterate bigot well before accusations came out.  https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/12/roy-moore-election-conservative-case-against-him/
967541918472208384 2018-02-24 23:29:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @heymikey80 When GOPers say even its true, we need him in the Senate! they deserve to lose.
967539247287885826 2018-02-24 23:18:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Storment21 Shut up, Jamie.
967538582025056261 2018-02-24 23:15:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I enjoy roaming around Twitter as an independent-minded conservative, calling it as I see it.

967520919194406912 2018-02-24 22:05:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RedState @TimScott80 Agreed
967517132996120576 2018-02-24 21:50:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RedState @goroke_mi Haha. Thanks. I appreciate the calm response. (It's kind of rare, especially when talking 2A.)

967220297186365440 2018-02-23 02:11:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @donchambers82 @SJackhole Tryx laid it out pretty well. Their own brand of fear-mongering. Uncritical support of the president. Victimhood. Not a good look.
967213718223409153 2018-02-23 01:44:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaptThack Yes. Completely. :)

967211862256422912 2018-02-23 01:37:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rezazia Yay, us! ;)
967211781113425920 2018-02-23 01:37:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lifebythecreek Agreed
967211177435648000 2018-02-23 01:34:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lifebythecreek Which is what my first point says.
967211050876788736 2018-02-23 01:34:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @donchambers82 For examplehttps://twitter.com/nratv/status/921390510576562176
967210656851202050 2018-02-23 01:32:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @propatriots I call it like I see it regardless of whether Im in the popular crowd 
967209605263773699 2018-02-23 01:28:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Might be in the minority with this one...  These things are true: - The NRA is not responsible for gun violence. At all.  - Their messaging has not been helpful, especially recently.
967200985759256579 2018-02-23 00:54:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CMReport @rezazia Likewise.
967199480327102464 2018-02-23 00:48:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CMReport @rezazia Ive stated why numerous times. Were just going to disagree on this one, Reza. :)
967197390699679744 2018-02-23 00:40:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rezazia @CMReport Sorry, we disagree about teachers being armed in schools.
967196573137604608 2018-02-23 00:36:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CMReport @rezazia Except these arent liberals....
967196425418346496 2018-02-23 00:36:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CMReport @rezazia Ive talked to plenty of 2A supporting, conservative educators who arent comfortable with it.
967196267477635072 2018-02-23 00:35:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rezazia @CMReport I dont think teachers should be saddled with the duty to engage a shooter. They are there to educate. Thats my opinion. Ive heard a lot from both sides in the past week.
967195143395831810 2018-02-23 00:31:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rezazia @CMReport And I know plenty of teachers who are not in support of having teachers armed at all. They prefer guards whose sole job is to protect. 
967189108564070400 2018-02-23 00:07:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rezazia And I disagree. They should focus on teaching and leave security to armed guards.
967182873219469312 2018-02-23 23:42:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @VICE @jtLOL Im even against such freedoms. Smh.
967182096115666945 2018-02-23 23:39:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Oh, no. Women?! You mean a gun might do more to stop a rapist than peeing on the perp, a common suggestion from the Left? https://twitter.com/vice/status/967135983039844353
967155158345011200 2018-02-23 21:52:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No excuses. Not a single one. If there could possibly be another category of responsibility directly behind the shooter, it is the bloodied hands of these officers.https://twitter.com/cnni/status/967151691866001408

967124153374531584 2018-02-23 19:49:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rezazia So...you accuse me right off the bat? 
967123388912340993 2018-02-23 19:45:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rezazia Im good. You accused me of not thinking so I wont waste my time. Thanks!
967122462604451841 2018-02-23 19:42:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rezazia Basically. The rest was you blaming me for feeling and not thinking, when Ive done the exact opposite. :)
967119944545652737 2018-02-23 19:32:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Clearly, this tweet means Im anti-gun, dont want our teachers kept safe, and have no clue what happened in Florida.

967115787466170369 2018-02-23 19:15:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> After thinking about it more, Im not in favor of arming teachers. Their job is to educate. Lets leave being security guards up to security guards (ones who would actually engage a shooter).   Just my opinion...

As far as the GOP, they know a straight bill to defund would pass the House but not the Senate, since they need 60 votes. They don't try because they know it would fail.

966762987855011846 2018-02-22 19:53:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No, not apologizing for discussing abortion and gun violence. As a pro-lifer, I should be enraged by both. I shouldnt stay quiet because one is legal in the U.S.   We all have inherent worth. I believe life is precious no matter which side of the womb its on. Pro-aborts dont.

966724902463164417 2018-02-22 17:22:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Arming teachers is certainly worth discussing (a school in NM already does that), but armed guards at schools is a much better idea, in my opinion.

966029238490095616 2018-02-20 19:18:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DougHeye Exactly. Thank you.
966016184704479232 2018-02-20 18:26:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> A one size fits all explanation would work if EVERY gun owner went on a rampage, EVERY gamer shot up a school, EVERY individual dealing with depression flipped out and murdered others.   But this isnt the case. Dont paint a broad brushstroke across a very complicated issue.
966013737617559552 2018-02-20 18:16:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BlueStateRedMom 
966012841957511173 2018-02-20 18:13:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @LibertyMcArtor Yes, there are many, many factors.
966009728835969024 2018-02-20 18:00:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @LibertyMcArtor I think cultural rot has been happening for a while and evil is real. Still, someone saying video games and movies are *responsible* is a lazy attempt at discussing a very serious issue that goes far deeper.
966007789897355270 2018-02-20 17:52:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No, thats not it.https://twitter.com/newsweek/status/964586465308172290

965969955022934016 2018-02-20 15:22:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @goroke_mi I prefer not to attack 16 and 17-year-olds  - even if I *disagree* with them - who have been traumatized by losing classmates, are being thrust onto the national stage, and used as bait by either side. You know, but that's just me.
965967130603769856 2018-02-20 15:11:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> What's not difficult? Keeping yourself from attacking shooting victims whether you agree with their stance on guns and the sudden platforms they've been given or not. Looking at you, everyone.

965647544574496768 2018-02-19 18:01:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @IMAO_ No, Frank. Neither was LGBT inclusive enough.
965646102384070661 2018-02-19 17:55:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Rich, who is neither well-informed nor very good at arguing his point, believes Moore was actually deprived of his seat. Hes young but well on his way to becoming a true political hack who forsakes principles for politics.https://twitter.com/ramrants/status/965645097860612096
965644871196397569 2018-02-19 17:50:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> That Roy Moore apologists still exist within the putrid ranks of the GOP is yet another reason Im glad to be politically homeless. Disgusting political hacks.
965643413713575936 2018-02-19 17:45:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You...know due process doesnt apply here, right?

965641380222599168 2018-02-19 17:37:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Its quite sad when the best defense someone has is calling very serious, highly-corroborated accusations dated, as if the passage of time reduces their significance.

965630800904491010 2018-02-19 16:54:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @prettylieb Agreed
965628848883761152 2018-02-19 16:47:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket Hahaha. No.
965626830685339649 2018-02-19 16:39:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MajorDog524 I agree. There were huge mistakes in addressing the red flags from the TX and FL shooters. Mental health issues, obsession with hurting others, threats, etc. Not the only piece of the puzzle, though.
965624560459702272 2018-02-19 16:30:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Its so important to talk about school safety following the Parkland Shooting, but in the past year weve seen massacres at a concert in Las Vegas and a church in Sutherland Springs. Addressing the issue may help prevent some, but never all. Sad truth.

965426296724578304 2018-02-18 03:22:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Funinpasadena Thats a rather long answer. I wrote about it just last fall, if youre interested in reading.https://www.redstate.com/kimberly_ross/2017/09/21/shapiro-prosecute-abortions-hes-right/
965417230560358400 2018-02-18 02:46:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Funinpasadena for death. Neither does disability discovered in utero. In high risk situations, every effort should be made to spare both. Tragically, this cant always happen. However, we should never seek out the unborn for death. This is an abomination. It *is* murder. Period.
965416673267388416 2018-02-18 02:44:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Funinpasadena It is simply a black and white issue. Easy day, unborn lives are destroyed in the name of a womans right to choose. These individuals are discriminated against based on location and stage of development. Neither incest nor rape qualifies them

You dont know me and Ive never encountered you. Ill decide what I do. And no, Deace didnt handle the Moore situation wisely. Ill remind him of that, even if just on Twitter. Im not required to take it elsewhere.
965317985350057984 2018-02-18 20:11:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DeaceProducer @SteveDeaceShow @MrMosis Who is enthusiastic about Romney? Im certainly not. But Deace picking apart Romney on some moral ground when he tripped over himself in defending Moore deserves to be called out. Like it or not.
965316362397614080 2018-02-18 20:05:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @SteveDeaceShow @ame4stars But accusing me of something I didnt do (taking him out of context) is just fine. Got it, honey.

965313367903756298 2018-02-18 19:53:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @SteveDeaceShow @ame4stars Nope. Try again.

965312111940423682 2018-02-18 19:48:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DeaceProducer @SteveDeaceShow @MrMosis He said Im not acting like an adult (because the litmus test for adulthood is agreeing with Deace?) and gave me a backhanded compliment in which he said I took him out of context, when I absolutely did not. Dont expect me to be on.

965297009220571136 2018-02-18 18:48:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Twitter is so calm and refreshing right now. I cant wait until we are knee deep in Midterm Twitter. #heavysarcasm
965295146463002624 2018-02-18 18:41:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Because some clearly need to be reminded that there were *many* reasons to not support Moore...  There is no good reason for a faithful conservative to support Roy Moore.https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/12/roy-moore-election-conservative-case-against-him/
965289010842275840 2018-02-18 18:16:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Dont trade principles for politics.
965287752051953664 2018-02-18 18:11:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @NoahCRothman @SteveDeaceShow @jimbearNJ Conservatives dont defend people like Moore because of politics, but then again, Im not Steve.
965284681498464256 2018-02-18 17:59:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JorgeTwtsTennis Imagine my heartbreak.
965284528599326720 2018-02-18 17:59:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Let the record show that consistently going to bat for Roy Moore and his candidacy is something were not going to look past. Not apologizing for holding the GOP accountable.
965283476139380737 2018-02-18 17:54:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Sounds good. At least I didnt constantly defend Roy Moore. https://twitter.com/stevedeaceshow/status/965282943336964096
965283207389368320 2018-02-18 17:53:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @SteveDeaceShow @jimbearNJ Yes, I disagreed with him on here before the scandal, too. Try to keep up.
965280858331631617 2018-02-18 17:44:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Not interested. Just like I wasnt when you asked me to come on and explain why I wouldnt support your buddy, Roy Moore. https://twitter.com/stevedeaceshow/status/965279016650530816
965250799621296128 2018-02-18 15:44:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AndreaNRuth I can relate  That gif is perfect.
965212477352038400 2018-02-18 13:12:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And no, I dont believe that Trump giving a thumbs up while meeting with first responders/wounded in Florida is even *close* to appropriate or presidential. But his slobbering fans dont care.
965210243604066305 2018-02-18 13:03:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> How does one turn the focus away from a horrific tragedy and those affected and instead make it about ones very fragile ego?!https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/965075589274177536
965051967277027328 2018-02-17 02:34:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> As seen on Twitter in recent days: - Prayer is stupid.  - Death threats against pro-gun control liberals.  - Wishing harm to children of pro-2A Americans. - The NRA pulled the trigger.  - Video games are to blame.  But sure, lets attempt more policy debate on here. 
965037581657432065 2018-02-17 01:37:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ZacharyBHayes For someone who tripped over himself to support Roy Moore, this attempt to discredit Romney is beyond absurd.
965023655548858368 2018-02-17 00:42:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Remember, this is the same pundit who went out of his way to defend Roy Moores candidacy. Again and again.   ...and pro-family/pro-marriage items are bad because Obama was strong in these areas, too? pic.twitter.com/3jLbI1f5Nb
965020912507674624 2018-02-17 00:31:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @FlatheadMama Just as someone who told me yesterday that Black Panther was not made for people like you is part of the problem, too. :)

965011189305692164 2018-02-17 23:52:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @FlatheadMama And? Thats not the vast majority of people. Not even close.
965008336767934465 2018-02-17 23:41:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Opheliaa_1 Well, you are gorgeous.
965007232923570176 2018-02-17 23:37:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I love how were supposed to really like certain movies or else were automatically sexist, racist, etc. Sorry that youre incapable of handling others opinions about your art without making wild claims, JJ.https://twitter.com/thewrap/status/964668413606965248
964986980730892288 2018-02-17 22:16:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> To be clear, there are some good reasons to question a Romney Senate campaign, but one of them is not but he isnt MAGA!
964986128406282241 2018-02-17 22:13:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Those who are against Romneys run for Senate only because he is vocally against Trump just prove that the GOP is now all about the cult of personality.
964979736299655170 2018-02-17 21:47:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JacobRhea101 @RobJCollins65 Instead, how about we blame the perpetrator for his actions? Is that too much to ask?

964590942387875841 2018-02-16 20:02:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AE7Q_ I actually watched mostly older movies (from those decades) when I was growing up since they were/are my Dads favorites. Id say that my movie tastes are different than what one might expect.
964587710492135424 2018-02-16 19:50:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I feel the same way about Black Panther as I do the upcoming May release of Avengers: Infinity War.    Im rather tired of superhero movies.
964578319386673154 2018-02-16 19:12:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @_Average__Joe_ Hahaha. Have fun, new guy.  Youre not worth my time.
964577392651046912 2018-02-16 19:09:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @_Average__Joe_ Let me know how youre going to change the inherent evil of the human heart. Thanks. Until then, practical approaches (that dont involve banning guns) are necessary. Im no liberal. I see that youre brand new here. Youll learn.
964571904693690373 2018-02-16 18:47:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If you see something, say something...   ...and maybe the FBI will take action OR maybe theyll do nothing and innocent people will lose their lives after the same kid who says he wants to be a *professional school shooter* goes through with it.
964571174796742657 2018-02-16 18:44:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @repub9989 Its just unbelievable. All that information and no action. Whats the point of if you see something, say something?

964569311871422464 2018-02-16 18:36:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @_Average__Joe_ We have background checks. The problem goes beyond that. There are those who *do* pass background checks and go on to commit crimes. Also, those who obtain guns illegally obviously arent subject to checks. Its a very complicated issue.
964553192100040704 2018-02-16 17:32:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @_Average__Joe_ 1. Armed guards at every school 2. Review and improvement of how FBI addresses and responds to potential threats 3. Increased focus on mental health
964527996060229634 2018-02-16 15:52:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Many factors have led us to this time in American society where mass shootings are more frequent. Well have to improve in/address multiple areas to prevent future tragedies. But they will never disappear.
964523187991121920 2018-02-16 15:33:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @hiserote There is no problem with reasonable discussion. Were all against gun violence.
964520489812144130 2018-02-16 15:22:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> ...but if youd like to talk about an organization that is directly responsible for deaths, we can discuss Planned Parenthood.
964518065772924929 2018-02-16 15:13:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Emotions are high after such a horrific act of violence, and thats understandable, but blaming the NRA (again) is extremely foolish. They are not responsible for gun deaths. Come on, people.

964152915182145538 2018-02-15 15:02:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Mental health is a subject we dont discuss often enough. Its one we avoid because its uncomfortable. We dont want to question someones stability for fear of offending.

964110866588274689 2018-02-15 12:15:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ProgDownTicket I am not for abortion in cases of rape or incest, either. If I was raped and became pregnant as a result, I would have the child. If I had a daughter and she was raped, abortion would not be the answer. Move along now.

963935802714664960 2018-02-14 00:39:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I was a junior in high school when the Columbine massacre happened. It *profoundly* impacted the sense of safety and security Id had up to that point. Were still dealing with these horrors, and its getting worse, nineteen years later.
963919961847713794 2018-02-14 23:36:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The worst part of social media is seen after these tragedies. One side defending 2A while another demands more restrictions. Often, individuals in both groups become downright VICIOUS. Rinse. Repeat.   I wont be participating.

963877494335115270 2018-02-14 20:47:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Perhaps because abortion kills unborn females *and* males and as fellow humans, they speak up for the defenseless? Just a guess, handmaids.https://twitter.com/NARAL/status/963874458569248770

963267832824901632 2018-02-12 04:25:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Oh, no. The horrors of motherhood and parenthood. It will require sacrifice! It will cut into the life you knew and the one you want! It's bad!  It's called adulthood and responsibility, Nancy. Grow up.
963266542245904384 2018-02-12 04:20:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Motherhood is seen as a detriment to one's earning potential when it should really be seen as the role of a lifetime.

963085802753482752 2018-02-12 16:22:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> President Obama's portrait is in the usual style of the painter. Not everyone's choice, but keeping in line with his work.   Michelle Obama's portrait? It looks very unfinished and not much like her...
963085310988095489 2018-02-12 16:20:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes, I am.
963078062932942849 2018-02-12 15:51:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I got the flu shot. I also got the flu last week and took Tamiflu as prescribed. However, my experience wasn't nearly as bad as some. I'm very pro-flu shot because it DOES help reduce severity and chance of it developing into pneumonia, etc.   Just my two cents.

962906642466689025 2018-02-11 04:30:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> When you see a media outlet slobbering over North Koreans at the Olympics, remember Ji Seong-ho, the NK defector who was a guest at the SOTU. He *escaped* from that very place and carried his crutches as a reminder of the brutality.

962854465941463040 2018-02-11 01:02:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hey, yall  That was a nice break. What did I miss? (Dont answer.)pic.twitter.com/dSIHYEQa7s
960642456546172930 2018-02-05 22:33:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> So, Im taking a much-needed, extended break from this place to focus on the real.   See you on the other side 
960641505613533184 2018-02-05 22:29:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Whether you admit it or not, Twitter is a bubble. It is not real life (though some certainly act as if it is). Its an echo chamber. Its not a great platform for any type of fruitful discussion.
960641109411147776 2018-02-05 22:27:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Its absolutely exhausting and time-consuming. Normal dialogue with someone who holds an opposite view is near impossible because everyone is ready to be vicious, just because.
960640669562884101 2018-02-05 22:25:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Really, the past few weeks on here have been about as extreme as right before the election. You cant say anything without it being *shredded* in the rudest way possible and often, being ridiculed for who you are even if it has nothing to do with the subject at hand.
960637945488334848 2018-02-05 22:15:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @mindyfinn @THEBenWilhelm @djlettieri Exactly. Were supposed to support him without question, a man who is often the exact opposite of what these Evangelicals claim to espouse. And were the arrogant ones because we dont follow automatically. Sad to see how far once level-headed individuals like Ben have fallen.
960633764287311872 2018-02-05 21:58:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @mindyfinn @THEBenWilhelm @djlettieri Oh, Ben is lecturing me about Christianity while also telling me that he hates everyone. All the while missing the point, which is regular for him.
960631735556943873 2018-02-05 21:50:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @mindyfinn @THEBenWilhelm @LionTedPride Ben is certainly unhinged.
960630407770275845 2018-02-05 21:45:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @mindyfinn @THEBenWilhelm Aww, imagine my heartbreak 
960630306020777984 2018-02-05 21:44:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Me: Blind loyalty is bad.  Him: Youre wrong. Also, I hate everyone.   Yikes, might want to log off...https://twitter.com/thebenwilhelm/status/960629761281351681
960629647015899136 2018-02-05 21:42:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The time when you suggest that blind loyalty to anyone is bad and the Trumplicans flip out, almost on cue.
960629095989092352 2018-02-05 21:39:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @mindyfinn @THEBenWilhelm Then you havent been paying attention. At all. Which is kind of your thing, anyway. I cant help if you lack reading comprehension, Ben. Youll need to work on that.   ...But youve performed satisfactorily for the slobbering MAGAheads youre trying to impress  Cheers!
960627725609394176 2018-02-05 21:34:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @mindyfinn @THEBenWilhelm Youve now rudely explained nothing but your problem with Mindy, not the statement itself, because you know its true.   You clearly lack the skills of observation as I write (and tweet) about praising the good and condemning the bad.   Youre free to unfollow! ;)
960626059401158656 2018-02-05 21:27:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @mindyfinn @THEBenWilhelm No, a statement can be correct on its own merit. This absolutely is. Please, point out where shes wrong. I can wait...
960625551982592000 2018-02-05 21:25:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket More proof that the abortion giant doesnt need federal funding.

959885460515577858 2018-02-03 20:25:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Nonya_Bisnez I was an anonymous non-check for a long time. I act the same.
959884819873267712 2018-02-03 20:22:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @awstar11 @Mellecon Thanks. No worries.
959884156217020416 2018-02-03 20:19:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Mellecon @awstar11 You, too!
959883591206539264 2018-02-03 20:17:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Mellecon @awstar11 @HokieMBA00 If you cant understand my initial tweet, I cant help you.
959883433370636290 2018-02-03 20:16:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Mellecon @awstar11 Be more observant next time 
959883292546863104 2018-02-03 20:16:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @awstar11 Yeah, you absolutely did.
959882779000524800 2018-02-03 20:14:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Mellecon @awstar11 @HokieMBA00 You seem to have trouble with reading comprehension like him, too.
959882561278365702 2018-02-03 20:13:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @awstar11 I dont remember singling him out, or any specific account, for that matter.
959882270151716864 2018-02-03 20:12:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> How dare I say anonymous accounts shouldnt get a pass for their behavior!  I see that only anonymous accounts take issue with this simple suggestion. Heh.
959881851069517824 2018-02-03 20:10:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Mellecon @awstar11 Youre offended by my suggestion that everyone, including people like you, should be held to a standard of conduct. You dont get a pass just because youre unknown, buddy.
959881496319463426 2018-02-03 20:09:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @awstar11 @Mellecon Fusili Spocks emotional response was not a correct interpretation.
959880669743677442 2018-02-03 20:06:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Mellecon @awstar11 Then you have trouble with reading comprehension if you have an issue with me calling out cruelty from the precious anons. Thanks. ;)
959880515259125760 2018-02-03 20:05:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @awstar11 @Mellecon When did I say I want to deprive people of their anonymity? I absolutely did not. Thanks.
959880075813576704 2018-02-03 20:03:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @awstar11 @cobracommandr15 I never once said that I wish to deprive anonymous accounts of their anonymity. I just notice too many taking their privacy and using it to be malicious. I used to be anonymous, now Im not. I act the same. 
959867173907902465 2018-02-03 19:12:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CassellTimothy Very true.

959855480016392193 2018-02-03 18:25:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Exactly. I have no problem with anonymity. I have a problem when people use it to be cruel without consequence.https://twitter.com/aubergine20/status/959855059885613056
959855109797830658 2018-02-03 18:24:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @awstar11 So you can just be horribly rude because youre anonymous? Thats pretty weak.
959854384271282181 2018-02-03 18:21:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Its truly amazing, the number of individuals who hide behind an anonymous avi and somehow feel that gives them the right to be nasty to others. Sad little keyboard warriors.

959151238590992385 2018-02-01 19:47:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @KassyDillon @DocWashburn @MrBeardedTruth She called pro-lifers "hypocrites" and changed her supposed values just because she was in front of a different audience and yearning for their approval. She's absolutely not a role model...but she fits in great at Fox News.

958471016078077952 2018-01-30 22:44:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm very much up-to-date on the issue and opposed to telling private businesses what they can and can't do. If you're so sensitive to companies having their own policy and wounded by their political leanings, log off.
958468978334150658 2018-01-30 22:36:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's idiotic legislation from someone who has his feelings hurt because he's kicked off social media for his blatant racism.
958466219346194435 2018-01-30 22:25:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Along with being a racist, Nehlen is also very much for telling businesses what they can do. This is not conservative. https://twitter.com/pnehlen/status/958452715931230209

955881213595615233 2018-01-23 19:13:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Men and women are never going to be equals in terms of physical abilities, strengths, weaknesses, familial roles, and even many interests. Rejecting this truth is what drives the 3rd wave feminists whose hysteria has reached a fever pitch.

Change my mind on an issue I've been staunch on for 19 years? That's cute.

955511469130571777 2018-01-22 18:44:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> While I mostly avoid reading comments on my articles, I sometimes like to go to them and traipse through the inanity and the absolute lack of observation. Oh, don't read what I actually wrote; better yet, come up with what you want to think I've written in order to shriek at me.
955494197200637955 2018-01-22 17:35:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Great day to talk about the vibrancy and diversity of the pro-live movement, alive and well in communities across the nation. The pro-life women's conference is a great way to get involved. I was blessed to go last year! Details here:http://www.prolifewomen.com/
955493328342183937 2018-01-22 17:32:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @KostiukLeah I wish I could wrap my arms around you in a warm embrace. There are so many who feel the same way. You are loved.
955491927985721345 2018-01-22 17:26:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> While we speak truth and promote the worth of the unborn we also highlight the worth of their mothers, too. Ladies, you CAN do this. There is support, hope, compassion, and love. You are strong and capable. #LoveIsLouder #Roe45
955491056719663104 2018-01-22 17:23:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @KostiukLeah Thank you for being a voice for the unborn!
955488260792471552 2018-01-22 17:12:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Abortion is not healthcare Abortion is not birth control Abortion IS legal homicide  45 years ago, a decision was made to discriminate against those in the womb and call it "a woman's right to choose." Abortion is a stain on the soul of our nation. #roe45
955487643302809600 2018-01-22 17:09:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AbbyJohnson @LilaGraceRose @colebrianj Thank you. My honor.
955470289420333057 2018-01-22 16:00:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> That was an actual answer to the question of how are American women oppressed? that I saw floating around over the weekend.
955469567236759553 2018-01-22 15:57:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> More men than women own businesses or hold elected office is not proof of oppression or a lack of rights. Equal opportunity =/= equal outcome.
955464953338712064 2018-01-22 15:39:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> PSA: get checked yearly for skin cancer, especially if youre a ghostly pale individual who burns easily. I dont care if I sound elderly. It can save your life. And kids, wear sunscreen.

954908151257681921 2018-01-20 02:46:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Are they done marching for rights they already have? Good. In that case, heres one of my favorite Prager videos about that scary wage disparity issue. https://youtu.be/QcDrE5YvqTs

954816942073876484 2018-01-20 20:44:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @curiousccate What a kind thing to say! Thank you so much. Humbled and honored.
954813460071710721 2018-01-20 20:30:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> My favorite part about today's podcast is that we used "The Walking Dead" as intro music. I mean, we're basically zombies now that net neutrality was overturned and the government shut down.

954789671502008320 2018-01-20 18:56:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And stop complaining that there arent enough women in Congress as if youre being barred from launching a campaign. Run for office. You have equality of opportunity...but that doesnt automatically deliver equality of outcome. So woman-up.
954782101102125058 2018-01-20 18:26:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> #WomensMarch2018 praises convicted killers like Assata Shakur. Linda Sarsour is pro-sharia. Their platform is pro-abortion. Its a living, breathing example of the poison that is 3rd wave feminism dressed up in cheap p***y hats.   I proudly stand apart from it all.

954751086929293313 2018-01-20 16:22:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The #MarchforLife yesterday and the #WomensMarchDC today could not be more strikingly different. The first is joyful, promotes life, is all-inclusive. The latter is about anger, sexism, dismissing the worth of the unborn, obtaining special rights, not equality.
954559051186212864 2018-01-19 03:39:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Aksd2015 Never :)

954545242954485760 2018-01-19 02:44:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @amber_alf @_Average__Joe_ It absolutely is not a Christian argument. Life begins at conception. This is supported by science and stands alone. Youre attempting to dismiss the pro-life issue by reducing it to some sort of religious whim. What morally flimsy ground you stand on.

954515747388223488 2018-01-19 00:47:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @chadfelixg @GlennVerasco Typical spineless slinking through moral issues because youre, like, for liberty.   Muting you now. Clearly, I wont miss anything.

954511947415814144 2018-01-19 00:32:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @GlennVerasco @chadfelixg Exactly. Why is this so difficult for some?
954511103924547585 2018-01-19 00:29:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @chadfelixg @GlennVerasco If youre privately against abortion but publicly wont take a stand on this black and white issue, then youre not actually pro-life. Just FYI.

954437936665243649 2018-01-19 19:38:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Abortion is *a* holocaust. Abortion is slavery. Babies, women, and men all deserve better. #WhyWeMarch #MarchforLife
954437683614568448 2018-01-19 19:37:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Pro-life means declaring the worth of every individual whether its a helpless unborn life or a scared mother without a support system. There is always hope.
954437368056107009 2018-01-19 19:36:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Im laser focused on loudly proclaiming the truth about abortion, how it takes lives and ruins others. How its not good for society. How its not pro-woman. How it goes directly against creation.
954437008549609472 2018-01-19 19:34:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Recently, I was told that I talk/write about abortion too much. On social media, I was told that Im obsessed with it. You got me! Im focused on the fact that in the land of the free, thousands are killed each day because they EXIST.   Get comfortable. I wont ever be quiet.
954434478851678209 2018-01-19 19:24:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @molratty Thats about as frenzied of an attempt to be anti-life as Ive ever seen. NARALs gonna NARAL.

954341117843197952 2018-01-19 13:13:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> In order to be pro-life... - You do not have to be religious.  - You dont have to be a Republican.  - You dont have to be a female.  - You dont have to be a heterosexual.    Its simple. Be a human being and speak up for the rights of those who inhabit the womb. #MarchforLife

954120775820283904 2018-01-18 22:38:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @politicalelle It really is.
954120319689732096 2018-01-18 22:36:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And I'm no fan of the president nor did I vote for him. I've been quite clear about this. But if I'm going to call out his behavior when necessary, I'll call out others' behavior, too.
954119958698610689 2018-01-18 22:34:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Stop comparing Donald Trump's behavior/policies to Hitler, Stalin, or Kim Jong-Un. Really. You look staggeringly idiotic when doing so. Not only are the comparisons factually incorrect, but you're reducing the suffering of millions in order to take a cheap shot.

953976517050208256 2018-01-18 13:05:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DatOtherMichael I always mean 3rd wave feminists ;)
953975753166770177 2018-01-18 13:01:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This is the problem with giving women sole discretion over what is right and wrong, yet also removing them as responsible parties. They never need to answer for their sexual expression and remain the victim no matter what occurs.
953974373635055617 2018-01-18 12:56:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Many who say that Aziz Ansaris behavior amounts to sexual assault are also disgusted by the likes of...Mike Pence, whose personal standards in regards to women are above reproach.   Let me know how that works.

953022291834793984 2018-01-15 21:53:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @pixelprotectors Agreed. Men and women are different. They were made that way. Thats not saying theyre weak, though. In fact, I think were quite strong.

953015681431359488 2018-01-15 21:26:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Too much of modern feminism is telling women you cant or you shouldnt. Youre not capable of raising a child from an unplanned pregnancy. You shouldnt think twice about your sexual expression. You cant make it in a mans world.  I reject that.

952680806413144065 2018-01-14 23:16:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The term rape should mean something serious and criminal. That look isnt rape. A comment isnt rape.  Women have a responsibility when it comes to sex and relationships, too. You dont get a free pass.
952680303172100096 2018-01-14 23:14:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @azizansari Much like the fictional and absurd Cat Person story in the NYT. Sloppy sex/bad sex isnt the same as he raped me! You make a mockery of a movement that includes actual sexual assault victims. So stop. Not everything is rape or assault.

951857925626187776 2018-01-12 16:46:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> A post from @SpeakerRyan >  RYAN: Tax Reform Brings Real Benefits, New Confidencehttps://www.redstate.com/diary/SpeakerRyan/2018/01/12/ryan-tax-reform-brings-real-benefits-new-confidence/
951847356911276032 2018-01-12 16:04:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DatOtherMichael Exactly. He's not incorrect about reality, but his delivery and approach to the idea of immigration as a whole could use some very fine tuning. Of course, we're supposed to think this is all the end of the world.
951846790688583680 2018-01-12 16:02:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Apparently, I'm supposed to be outraged by one of the following: 1. Nothing.  2. Everything.   You'll be disappointed by my timeline if you fall into one of those two categories. So sorry. ;)
951846058753130496 2018-01-12 15:59:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TCC_Grouchy And yet, the usual suspects think it's too harsh or too light. #sigh
951844972243931136 2018-01-12 15:55:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @presjpolk Yes, they did.
951843886506434561 2018-01-12 15:50:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Thoughts about the "sh*thole countries" comment: 1. It shouldn't have been said.  2. It's not the end of the world.  3. You should demand better of the president.  4. Unfortunately, this is who he is. We've known for a while.  5. His fans excuse anything and always will.

951536742565376001 2018-01-11 19:30:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> My mom is the cutest. She just joined Facebook. I tagged her in a post and she texted me to say she saw the post and was going to reply to it. Adorable.
951525371027091456 2018-01-11 18:45:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> She shouldnt have to defend it.

You comprehend that, right? Sounds like Nancy looks at things individually. You paint a general brush over everyone & everything. Work on that.
950879414212071424 2018-01-09 23:58:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It is unconscionable that there even needs to be legislation called "Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act." In the 'land of the free' if you're pre-term and survive your scheduled murder, you are most likely left to die.   Choice is our god. What a stain on our nation.

950038673692745728 2018-01-07 16:17:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PaddyJManning @StephanieJMajor Its not disagreement that youre doing. Its willfully missing the point in an attempt to say Im disrespecting what the Jewish people went through during WWII. A holocaust is more than appropriate to describe the 60,000,000+ lives taken since Roe v Wade. Move on.
950035931721060353 2018-01-07 16:06:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PaddyJManning @StephanieJMajor Do you have trouble with reading comprehension?? A holocaust is not The Holocaust. Its correct usage of a term. You and others who are so easily offended need to be more observant.

950033736917245953 2018-01-07 15:57:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PaddyJManning @StephanieJMajor You *do* realize that a holocaust describes destruction on a mass scale, right? I never referenced the Jewish Holocaust. Its an absolutely correct term to use. Im not concerned that youre made uncomfortable by it.

949823412104548352 2018-01-06 02:02:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RabbiShmuley @DennisPrager @MichaelJPartyka @DiamonDamien The term holocaust isnt specific to just the Jewish Holocaust. This is widely known, except to people like Michael, apparently.
949774577131032577 2018-01-06 22:47:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BruvverEccles I'm well aware. Never said I was. :)
949766878603501569 2018-01-06 22:17:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DennisPrager @MichaelJPartyka @Dienekes_Sparta Its actually 60 million since Roe.

949763970285686784 2018-01-06 22:05:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MichaelJPartyka You do understand that the word holocaust isnt the same as The Holocaust, right? Apparently not. Regardless, youre playing a semantics game and brazenly dismissing the 60,000,000+ who have been killed since Roe v Wade. Youre a very foolish man.
949759085083283458 2018-01-06 21:46:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MichaelJPartyka You dont think abortion is destruction on a mass scale? What of the 321,384 individual humans who were killed at PP clinics in the past year? Do you have a spineless rationalization for that, too?
949748359518195716 2018-01-06 21:03:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MichaelJPartyka Thats awfully convenient for you, isnt it? A holocaust is defined as destruction or slaughter on a mass scale. Calling abortion a holocaust is the most accurate way to describe it. Your comfort matters little.

949708587584061440 2018-01-06 18:25:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @davequast Why is *this* the one argument from the pro-aborts? The 321,384 abortions weren't 321,384 cases of maternal distress. Abortion is all about convenience, not responsibility.
949708155285594113 2018-01-06 18:24:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @davequast If a pregnancy threatens a life you don't seek to go out of your way to destroy one of those lives. You work at saving both. Losing the unborn child in the process is not the same as selecting it for death.
949707402793938945 2018-01-06 18:21:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Abortion is a holocaust. You can quote me.
949707251031465985 2018-01-06 18:20:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @davequast Fantastic. As long as you understand that I won't budge on this point and will ALWAYS speak for the 321,384 who were just taken in the last fiscal year by the group you support. :)
949705475884449792 2018-01-06 18:13:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @davequast Abortions do NOT save lives. Abortion is murder but it's labeled as "reproductive health care" by the spineless among us. If PP stopped doing abortions, I would be happy to support them (though vastly outnumbered by non-abortive clinics). Until then, I'll speak against them.

949367658897727488 2018-01-05 19:51:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CplSoletrain Its unfortunate when liberty is all that matters and it cant pair up with common sense in someones mind.
949365099835330560 2018-01-05 19:40:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If I agree with Libertarians that the government cant save people from themselves, can they agree with me that too many people cant be relied upon to save themselves from themselves? Sometimes nothing limits a person so narrowly as absolute choice.
949364491124461568 2018-01-05 19:38:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PPact @tailsct Excuse me? Who is an idiot? Because Im pro-life. And actually, while most PP clinics do not perform any prenatal care, a *very* small amount do. That means little when they take more than 321,000+ lives per year, though.

949034726416928768 2018-01-04 21:48:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> My thoughts, concurrently:  1. We have bigger substance issues than marijuana (see: opioids). 2. Marijuana does impair behavior.  3. Im fine with medicinal marijuana but dont expect me to support recreational use.  4. Too many Libertarians obsess over this one issue.
948994354512875520 2018-01-04 19:07:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Putting personal opinions aside for a moment...this is a great point. We have MUCH bigger issues right now, and one of them is the opioid epidemic.https://twitter.com/comfortablysmug/status/948942034022301697
948978846136721409 2018-01-04 18:06:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MattAdkins21 No worries. I have no problem with legitimate medicinal use. Beyond that, it's highly unwise.
948977817718489089 2018-01-04 18:01:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MattAdkins21 My tweet says nothing about being in favor of it.
948974457640640514 2018-01-04 17:48:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Don't forget to also use your brain when discussing legalization of marijuana. Common sense + liberty are a great combination.
948973498592047105 2018-01-04 17:44:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket Agreed. It seems too many bypass the very serious issues you mentioned above when discussing legalization.
948950799455014913 2018-01-04 16:14:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @HankMullaney Absolutely not.
948948126408282112 2018-01-04 16:03:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I don't believe that Andrew Breitbart would be happy/comfortable with what we see from Breitbart now and the direction it has taken in the recent past.
948931946817703941 2018-01-04 14:59:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MartiniShark Their own website indicates that they charge up to $1,500 for 1st trimester abortions. Nothing says we're a non-profit who cares about poor women like that.

948622484785508353 2018-01-03 18:29:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Only three days into the new year and 2018 is already doing quite well at outpacing 2017 in terms of excessive idiocy and general hysteria.
948601963595395074 2018-01-03 17:08:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @james_penrod Actually, I prefer not to focus on what standouts may have been destroyed and instead mention the "regular" millions who were lost forever: neighbors, teachers, friends, accountants, etc.

948562882853261314 2018-01-03 14:33:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MattAdkins21 Its incredibly foolish to think that everything is cool/helpful just because theres an (R) next to the presidents name.

More than 320,000 innocents lost their lives in PP clinics in the last year. They should not receive taxpayer funds.

948313560618323973 2018-01-02 22:02:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Stop comparing Iranian protests and the fight for actual freedom to American feminism and/or the media tussles with Trump. Both of those attempts are not only untrue, but excessively idiotic.

948046751449210880 2018-01-01 04:22:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Its entirely patronizing. We need more women...because women...so vote for women, you women!! Dont verbally pat me on the head. I make up my own mind who I want to vote for, and neither party affiliation nor gender automatically sways me.
948046062232702977 2018-01-01 04:19:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Dont tell me that women make up 19% of the members of Congress as a reason why I should automatically vote for female candidates. Thats actually sexism. Female lawmakers have the same capacity for corruption and moral cowardice as males.
948044674920517633 2018-01-01 04:13:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This piece suggests that the wage gap in the U.S. and the gender disparity in Congress are because of sexism. Never mind that the 77 cents per every $1 claim has been disproven time and again, and women are free to run for office.

947919021101469696 2018-01-01 19:54:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @joedah87 @GradyFontana I mean, us 1980s kids are pretty cool AND dont act like the entitled brats who too often define our generation. 
947918077106315264 2018-01-01 19:50:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @joedah87 @GradyFontana ...demographers and researchers typically use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years.

947600187962380288 2017-12-31 22:47:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @True_Canuck1 Yes. Generally, we should be suspicious of political ambition. Too many instantly trust that kind of individual.
947598334944038914 2017-12-31 22:40:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Just stop. I support the right of Americans to protest even if I dont agree with every part of their platform.

946581951128985600 2017-12-28 03:21:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @HonestMissnary Good question.
946574256762249216 2017-12-28 02:51:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Really. Actual victims should be rightly upset at the display. Theyre doing nothing, which is what theyve always done. Dont applaud.
946574038842925056 2017-12-28 02:50:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hollywood, you DO know that wearing black to an awards show is about as effective against actual crime as a hashtag? Basically a nothing gesture, but gosh darn, youll feel so accomplished! And you wonder why sexual assault is so prevalent in your industry...

946219951970545664 2017-12-27 03:23:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> "The Darkest Hour" looks excellent. That's the kind of movie worth seeing. Not some reboot, romantic comedy, or umpteenth superhero offering.

946114085875277825 2017-12-27 20:22:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The idea that those on the Right should only criticize those on the Left is an incredibly lazy position to have. Ive always thought that cleaning your own house is just as, and often more important, than the other.

944406008943775744 2017-12-22 03:15:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @davequast Thats fine, but I personally believe that conservatisms foundation must include a staunch pro-life stance.

944314344610893829 2017-12-22 21:10:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @wharrison51 Merry Christmas to you, Will!
944304459462664194 2017-12-22 20:31:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @stabyoulots There is no doctor who is going to take time away from helping the mother in labor in order to murder the child through abortion. Every attempt should be made to help deliver successfully. Sometimes tragedies do occur, but thats different than *choosing* to end a life.
944301303550889985 2017-12-22 20:19:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Sweetpea593 @kimKBaltimore Then shes unprincipled, but weve known that for a while. ;) Abortion is a black and white issue. Conservatives must vocally defend life.
944296787405361153 2017-12-22 20:01:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BillEagle1951 Quite accurate
944296710276370432 2017-12-22 20:00:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> From a Constitutional who changes her tune in front of The View audience in order to label pro-lifers as hypocrites, and wont take abortion questions at a conservative conference for young adults.

944241715258576896 2017-12-22 16:22:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @alcavant Did I stutter? Of course Im serious about not murdering an unborn child just because the sperm donor was a criminal who should be castrated.
944236998784667650 2017-12-22 16:03:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The circumstances of conception never qualify a new life for death. Period. As regards a mothers life, every effort to save both woman AND child should be attempted. If the child does not survive even though attempts are made, that is a tragedy, but it is not a *choice* to kill.https://twitter.com/nevertrumptexan/status/944063229147385856

944195563964248064 2017-12-22 13:18:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Saw #TheLastJedi last night. I give it a solid meh. There are some interesting moments and cool scenes, but it seems to be a caricature of a Star Wars movie more than it is a Star Wars movie. Its low on the magic, chemistry, and earnestness that marked the originals.

944062273877929985 2017-12-21 04:29:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The pro-life issue is nothing to compromise on. The pro-life issue is not a gray area. The Left refuses to protect the unborn. Too many Libertarians are cowards when it comes to it. As conservatives, we MUST take a stand. I will never back down. Never.
944060673503514625 2017-12-21 04:22:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Thats @charliekirk11 and the cowardly kids at @TPUSA for you.https://twitter.com/knoxknoxwhosder/status/943962177286868996

942237530795184129 2017-12-16 03:38:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @GordonShuckrow3 Firing him would definitely make it look as if there is something to hide. Of course they want Trump to fire him.
942236459423150081 2017-12-16 03:34:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If Trump fired Mueller, this would be a huge problem. So let's be clear about that. One can think this while also not reverting to apocalyptic language. It is possible.
942204708009201666 2017-12-16 01:28:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @hallmanreport Of course firing Mueller would be a huge problem. I also dont think be prepared to take to the streets is the appropriate response. :)

940447101904936960 2017-12-11 05:03:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AG_Conservative @clintbrooks As an Evangelical and daughter of a pastor, and I am quite aware. And AG's tweets are spot-on.
940445460606615557 2017-12-11 04:57:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AG_Conservative @clintbrooks Are you even paying attention? He quoted Fallwell Jr's tweet. Come on, man.
940444904555188228 2017-12-11 04:55:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AG_Conservative @clintbrooks No, it's entirely accurate.

940367569843875840 2017-12-11 23:47:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rshackelford14 Exactly!!
940362268977573894 2017-12-11 23:26:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> After everything settles down, I hope #KeatonJones realizes that his worth isnt found in what others think of him. Like most people, I was bullied in school. Ive long since accepted my oddities. Those who cant certainly dont deserve a spot in my life.
940300704337616896 2017-12-11 19:22:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> REMINDER: Roy Moore was an absolutely dreadful option *before* allegations were made public. If Jones wins, its on the GOP. If Moore wins, its further proof of a party more interested in politics than principle. #ExGOP

939921848011313154 2017-12-10 18:16:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @chadfelixg @zelda85044 HE said that. Its kind of a main tenet of Christianity. Stop being so lazy in your thinking.
939920892922122242 2017-12-10 18:12:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @chadfelixg @zelda85044 Sure I can. When he says hes never asked God for forgiveness, thats a good sign that hes a fake. :)

939900523012087808 2017-12-10 16:52:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And on the other side of the Merry Christmas conversation, something equally ridiculous. pic.twitter.com/qsy15FrM18
939899310103293953 2017-12-10 16:47:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @hallmanreport @JohnPierreMaeli I am, of course, concerned with wrongly convicted individuals being imprisoned at all. But for those who are rightly convicted, and who commit violent crimes, its the correct choice, in my opinion. And deterring others isnt my chief concern.
939897734328352776 2017-12-10 16:40:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @hallmanreport @JohnPierreMaeli Thats fine. I wholeheartedly disagree.
939896599387492352 2017-12-10 16:36:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @javaslinger Id say effectiveness in reducing crime is not my concern. Its the correct punishment for violent crimes that take a life. Thats not an amoral position.
939894075259531264 2017-12-10 16:26:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @HideChewer Voting for good candidates matters, but I wont bother you with principles, hon.
939893774930587650 2017-12-10 16:25:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @hallmanreport I am not bothered by manner of execution. As far as whether it protects society, that is less of a concern to me. People will still murder. Shouldnt we be more concerned about punishing the guilty for their crimes of taking an innocent life?
939891610367807489 2017-12-10 16:16:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @HideChewer What an intellectually lazy viewpoint.

939885975588786177 2017-12-10 15:54:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I said Merry Christmas long before President Trump, while he was still a pro-choice, liberal playboy who didnt feign a weak belief in Christianity.
939881839505887232 2017-12-10 15:37:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @vonzion Impossible! 
939881432981401600 2017-12-10 15:36:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If you think: 1. People (including politicians) never said Merry Christmas before Trump.  OR 2. The phrase makes or breaks the meaning of the season.   ...youre a Trump cultist like Kayleigh.https://twitter.com/kayleighmcenany/status/939310614568165377

939867184129552385 2017-12-10 14:39:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JustinTHaskins Its amazing to me that there is even an attempt to link the two.
939865822574542849 2017-12-10 14:34:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I see certain people I respect discussing capital punishment. While I wont join in those specific threads, I will say that like me, you *can* be pro-life and also support execution of the rightly condemned who have committed violent crimes.

939578719534018561 2017-12-09 19:33:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I have great respect for police officers. They put their lives on the line daily. Often, they make the correct - and difficult - decision. Sometimes they dont. We should all be bothered when theyre not held accountable.
939577645645418497 2017-12-09 19:29:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The police shooting of Daniel Shaver is unjustifiable. Period.

937313164064149504 2017-12-03 13:30:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Someone has to say it...  Santa Baby is such a horrible Christmas song. And there are so many versions. And none of them improve upon the horror. And yet, its played all the time, like its cute and charming. Its not. It makes my ears bleed.
937150462578581504 2017-12-02 02:44:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Coach_Crash It should hold more weight because Im being honest about it  Or you can just be grumpy.

937145555909840901 2017-12-02 02:24:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> My favorite is when people believe a higher number of followers (or checkmark) automatically makes someones tweets more worthwhile.   Hint: not true.

936676715677540353 2017-12-01 19:21:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> As far as Im concerned, a Congressman who sexually harasses/abuses someone should be kicked out of office as soon as possible. No more I wont seek re-election. You forfeit your cushy D.C. existence immediately.

935508628185976832 2017-11-28 14:00:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Thats how we were left with a host of Evangelical leaders who fervently support Trump and constantly make excuses. Because they believe the GOP and Christianity are one.
935508195249934336 2017-11-28 13:58:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Too many conflate the GOP and Christianity, as if always voting Republican and never questioning an (R) politician is the spiritual thing to do. Stop trying to act as if these are synonymous.

934885103708311553 2017-11-26 20:42:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ajamison5678 Understandable. I must say, the interview made me wonder if she has an issue such as that. It seems difficult for her to communicate, and I dont mean that with partisan sarcasm. It genuinely seems she has trouble.

932798006407188480 2017-11-20 02:29:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Were going to get nowhere if we continue acting like only Dems OR Republicans and only men OR women have problems they need to address.

932689650052943874 2017-11-20 19:18:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @turbatus_umbra Thank you. And youre right, it should also be talked about because it is a real thing.
932687549495115778 2017-11-20 19:10:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @turbatus_umbra I have never said that it is. In fact, I often defend the men who have experienced it but are afraid or shamed into not discussing it.
932683647668359169 2017-11-20 18:54:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @turbatus_umbra Youre free to make your own poll :)

932671047849119744 2017-11-20 18:04:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Isla_78 @realmikenemesi @SWNID Bingo. It is foolish to think otherwise.
932670808941563904 2017-11-20 18:03:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @fredontwittur Exactly. It's a power trip first and foremost.
932669365224378368 2017-11-20 17:57:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Sorry, this is a willfully blind position to take. Sexual assault/harassment absolutely does happen in the "real world." Just because your local predators aren't splashed across social media doesn't mean it isn't occurring.https://twitter.com/realmikenemesi/status/932668942224674819

931603718251991040 2017-11-17 19:23:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @saraschaefer1 Glad to hear it. Im not against women running for office at all. Obviously. Many just pursue other things. I care more about electing good politicians regardless of gender than I care about the actual gender balance in Congress.
931601332502396929 2017-11-17 19:14:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @saraschaefer1 Great. I hear it and see it all the time. Its nothing but sexism to say women should run just because. You said it yourself with more balanced representation. You would encourage me (and others) to pick a female candidate OVER a male. Sorry, I dont vote based on gender.
931597411977515010 2017-11-17 18:58:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @saraschaefer1 Women are not barred from running for office. Most women choose not to because they have higher priorities. They are not held back. Its a personal decision. I encourage them to do what they want, but I wont encourage them to run *just* because theyre women. 
931594078294290437 2017-11-17 18:45:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @FlatheadMama Equality of opportunity does not automatically result in equality of outcome. This doesnt mean sexism is to blame.

931586428345122817 2017-11-17 18:14:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I didn't vote for Hillary. Her being female did nothing to sway my opinion. Bravo. You didn't choose it..now I'm going to reward you with support? What is that?  Oh, right. Third wave "arble garble the Patriarchy!" feminism. No thanks.
931586042578259968 2017-11-17 18:13:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You know, I don't want to be looked at "Oh, that's a female. She should run for elected office!" I would want people to select me for qualifications, shared principles, etc. Not gender.   That doesn't do me - or anyone - any favors.
931585508085522432 2017-11-17 18:11:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Saying women should be in office *just because they're women* is sexism, pure and simple.
931585298127040512 2017-11-17 18:10:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @FlatheadMama Are you barred from pursuing elected office?
931539367029624833 2017-11-17 15:07:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Women, you aren't barred from running for office. Stop acting like it's some sort of systemic oppression that keeps you from it. #personalchoice

929905277553532928 2017-11-12 02:54:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hallmark Channel Christmas movie, probably: Claire owns a bookstore. Logan is a lumberjack. They live in a small northern town. The movie is called "The Christmas Chapter." They fall in love, have a brief falling out, kiss, the townspeople cheer. Etc.

929814627009073152 2017-11-12 20:54:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AngryDingo I appreciate your question and that you're not seething with rage (which is what I've gotten a lot of recently). My best answer? I didn't vote for Trump or Hillary because neither was someone I could support. I did that knowing one would be president.

929494439118196736 2017-11-11 23:41:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Never thought Id have to defend a zero tolerance stance on sexual abuse. And no, Im not talking specifically about Moore. Im talking in general. The its no big deal because X excuses are infuriating.
929493500957282306 2017-11-11 23:38:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @aronro @gush313 I think its pretty clear who I was referring to. Take it or leave it.

929470653241192453 2017-11-11 22:07:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @thethriftygene No, I never said that. I happen to think that those who vote for him endorse his behavior.
929467714669858817 2017-11-11 21:55:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Timerican @jamiestorment21 Youre getting a follow for that.
929466402112786434 2017-11-11 21:50:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @thethriftygene Your reply is regarding my tweet where I quoted someone who *does not care* about anything else but a wall. So I will label them as endorsing his behavior. That is logical.
929462042989334528 2017-11-11 21:33:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @thethriftygene I gave my answer. I dont owe anyone my vote and dont even have to vote if I decide that neither candidate represents my principles. Same goes for everyone else.
929459474154303488 2017-11-11 21:23:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @thethriftygene Elections are never binary. This is a great talking point to pressure people, but you can always abstain. I voted third party in general and would sit out voting if I lived in Alabama.
929457603129892864 2017-11-11 21:15:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @thethriftygene I would vote for neither, just like I did in the presidential election.

929447272789807104 2017-11-11 20:34:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Really. It's amazing how much hatred I, and many others, have received by stating that there should be zero tolerance when it comes to sexual abuse.

929411563320201220 2017-11-11 18:12:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @shortwave8669 @Jewtastic Cool. I couldn't care less that you have a problem with my tweets. Unfollow, mute, block if discussing GOP tolerance of sexual abuse is too much for you to handle. Or, you know, also speak out against it. But I'm not betting on that last one.
929410051395194880 2017-11-11 18:06:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @shortwave8669 @Jewtastic A reminder from your recent past. Maybe heed your own advice.https://twitter.com/Jewtastic/status/833723196868169728

929408616867811328 2017-11-11 18:00:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Jewtastic This is saying much about your character, and it's not good things. ;)
929408516544192513 2017-11-11 18:00:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Jewtastic @shortwave8669 Because he's a Republican!! The only reason. GOPers get a pass from those who have forsaken their principles.
929408051660165121 2017-11-11 17:58:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Ron is spineless. He's uncomfortable with discussions of sexual abuse and not tolerating it because...politics.https://twitter.com/Jewtastic/status/929407443469139968
929407335419834368 2017-11-11 17:55:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @GenericDisdain1 And MANY have shrugged their shoulders and said they just do not care even if true. These are the gutless cowards I'm calling out.
929404738449354758 2017-11-11 17:45:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> There is a direct correlation between people who have "deplorable" and "MAGA" in their names and bios, and people who keep shrugging their shoulders at highly-corroborated sexual assault allegations.
929404054605828097 2017-11-11 17:42:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @HeidiL_RN @SatireWorks @aaronleewaters You're 38 years old and still can't comprehend my tweet? I have never said Moore was guilty. At all. Period. I said "if the GOP excuses actual sexual abuse". Are you incapable of understanding words?
929403652896370688 2017-11-11 17:41:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RockyTop_VA @colleenglover06 You two are spineless if you would not speak out against *actual* sexual abuse, which my tweet clearly indicates.
929403445756522496 2017-11-11 17:40:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RockyTop_VA Who did I convict? I didn't. Do you have any problem whatsoever with people like David Horowitz saying Moore is guilty BUT that he doesn't care??https://twitter.com/SouthernKeeks/status/929128332494540800

I've never said that Moore is guilty, though the evidence sure is damning. Would you have trouble calling it out if it were all true? Probbaly, because you're MAGA and already support scum.

929131479128473606 2017-11-10 23:39:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> As a female, it enrages me that sexual abuse is deemed no big deal by some because of time passed and politics at stake. Do you even care about people?! Do you know the toll that takes on a human life??
929129843798757376 2017-11-10 23:33:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If the GOP excuses actual sexual abuse, it deserves to lose...and I will cheer its demise. There should be zero tolerance for that. You can @ me all you want.
929128332494540800 2017-11-10 23:27:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> NO. This is sick. This is pure tribalism. This is excusing sexual predation. Lapse of time doesnt make his actions less egregious.

929061613293965313 2017-11-10 19:02:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Holden114 @RawrNeedsCoffee @TomJefferson30 The four accusers actually dont know each other. Thats what makes this all the more troubling, everyone.
929061405931786241 2017-11-10 19:01:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Holden114 @RawrNeedsCoffee Ive already said what I think.
929059434466332673 2017-11-10 18:53:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Holden114 @RawrNeedsCoffee Hmm. I didnt say I hope it ruins his life. I said he should drop out of the race.
929058551896698880 2017-11-10 18:49:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Holden114 @RawrNeedsCoffee He can clear his name all he wants, but I think he should remove himself and this distraction from the race.
929058037113020418 2017-11-10 18:47:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RawrNeedsCoffee @Holden114 Step out of the race? I think you should.

929056363019456512 2017-11-10 18:41:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Holden114 Yes. I think he should step aside.
929046070876934144 2017-11-10 18:00:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Machovellian I never subtweet you :)
929044320522506240 2017-11-10 17:53:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @countermoonbat @chadfelixg I might make an exception for you ;)
929035808190889985 2017-11-10 17:19:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TreyMays Got it. So you wouldn't do the same for the Democrat.
929034768469110784 2017-11-10 17:15:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Dear Twitter users: just because you can doesn't mean you should use all 280 characters all the time.
929034640152768512 2017-11-10 17:14:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TreyMays I 100% disagree with you and am bothered that you make such a quick, faulty comparison. I doubt you'd do the same for a Democrat. :)
929032402785226752 2017-11-10 17:06:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TreyMays Quite a stretch, buddy. Have you even read the specifics of the accusations? This blanket "he's innocent" stuff is highly disturbing. Not to mention Moore was a TERRIBLE choice before yesterday's news.
929030209038319617 2017-11-10 16:57:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TreyMays Trey, you're wrong about this being comparable. Don't conflate the GOP with Christianity. Please don't.
929027051474096128 2017-11-10 16:44:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TreyMays Trey. This is an absurd comparison. That's all I'm going to say.

929021472571625473 2017-11-10 16:22:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @quiverskeep That's how we got Trump :)  Here's my take on the whole thing.https://twitter.com/SouthernKeeks/status/928987845582360576
929019798566076416 2017-11-10 16:15:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @captjwillis Did I say "most" have said that? No. However, I've seen a LOT of people dismiss allegations because he's an R. Gross hypocrisy.
929013137461870593 2017-11-10 15:49:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The "arble garble Roy Moore is automatically innocent because GOP!" apologists completely disgust me. You sure are quick to slam Democrats for the same. Grow a spine and call out your own, too.

928815723144626176 2017-11-09 02:44:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @LC_life1 Rationalization doesnt suit you.
928815502604013568 2017-11-09 02:44:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RayMcCue I frequently make both sides mad. ;) Currently, feel politically homeless.
928815277336350721 2017-11-09 02:43:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TylerBoliver Sorry, I greatly respect Steve, but hes been reluctant to criticize much of anything as it relates to Roy Moore even before today. Furthermore, he is not privy to any knowledge that the rest of us are not.
928811258329161728 2017-11-09 02:27:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The insta-excuses from GOPers for Roy Moore (but shockingly, not for those in Hollywood) speaks to how tribalist the Right has become. Glad to no longer be a part of the tribe.

928797525963890693 2017-11-09 01:32:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> According to Dina, #MeToo has rules. Run your victim experience by her first before daring to share it publicly. Your story of being assaulted might not be right for it. Especially you males.https://twitter.com/drdina1/status/928796481582022656

928795067543904258 2017-11-09 01:22:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @drdina1 You dont own the right of a victim to speak about HIS or HER experience. He doesnt need to find another place or hashtag to discuss the assault. You need to back off. Youre the worst example of feminism.
928793737907654658 2017-11-09 01:17:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Two things Ive seen just tonight:  1. We should admire women because they arent sexual predators. (Sure.) 2. Male victims should be quiet and make way for female victims to speak first.   Modern-day feminism, yall.
928792707643920384 2017-11-09 01:13:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Translation: men who have experienced sexual assault should shut up because a womans experience being assaulted means more. Or something.   This is the ugly side of the supposed equality push.https://twitter.com/drdina1/status/928773781471969280
928766578145091586 2017-11-09 23:29:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Linkus717 As a Christian, Im well aware of the story of Mary and Joseph. :) This moron was trying to compare that in some way to Moores alleged behavior. Thats my issue.

928738822799675392 2017-11-09 21:39:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @parkerrm39 Buddy, the allegations against Moore have nothing to do with his behavior toward a younger wife. It's sexual predation against minors.

928652120458432512 2017-11-09 15:54:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This is a lie. Many, many people are outraged by it. I've written and talked about it quite a bit. https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/928647984035844096
928651052324450306 2017-11-09 15:50:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump's 2016 victory came about in large part because of anger at opponents. If the GOP gets clobbered in 2018, they have Trump - and themselves - to blame.

928389450929000449 2017-11-08 22:31:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TreyMays @Brick______ As I've stated again and again, I much prefer a flat tax. Since this plan doesn't have that, I am 100% against doing away with this very necessary credit. The "pro-life/pro-family" party should act like it.
928388341342580737 2017-11-08 22:26:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TreyMays @Brick______ Since we don't have a flat tax and do have a child care credit, I don't think doing away with the adoption tax credit is a good move. At all.

928331291023552513 2017-11-08 18:40:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TreyMays I KEEP saying that, and have said that in writing, and yet I get pushback from people like you and Trey because I dare to suggest that we keep the credit in our current system.
928330035957813248 2017-11-08 18:35:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TreyMays We can't talk about the current issues we have with current policy because...why again? I'm a little confused by your incredible stretch and somehow concluding focusing on "here and now" is a Lefty thing. Hmm.
928329645413593088 2017-11-08 18:33:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TreyMays No, I'm discussing what is happening; removal of the adoption tax credit in a bad tax bill that isn't proposing a flax tax. It's OK to be bothered by it and condemn GOP for striking it. That's not a cop-out as you suggest.
928328264447418368 2017-11-08 18:28:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TreyMays Deal with the here and now. That's what I'm doing.

928323974601289730 2017-11-08 18:10:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TreyMays I prefer a flat tax with elimination of credits. We don't have that. Until then, this credit especially is necessary. But the GOP isn't really pro-life anyway.
928323385054052352 2017-11-08 18:08:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TreyMays No, it's not really a problem to wish they would keep an adoption tax credit that helps families. They also continue to give half a billion a year to Planned Parenthood. You should be bothered by both.
928322801479639040 2017-11-08 18:06:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TreyMays Obviously. This tax bill isn't that, though.

928311912428863488 2017-11-08 17:23:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Very disappointing. If you're pro-life you should be pro-adoption, and you should be bothered by the removal of the adoption tax credit.https://twitter.com/byrdinator/status/928276035489206272

928304290464190464 2017-11-08 16:52:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Such stale, lazy thinking. If you're a conservative who doesn't like Trump that must mean you've automatically joined "the tribal left" or some such nonsense. It can't possibly mean anything else to these Kool-aid drinkers. https://twitter.com/seanmdav/status/928298351304507403
928303520847187968 2017-11-08 16:49:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> One year since their golden boy won, and Trump tribalists mourning last night's GOP losses are throwing a lot of blame at #NeverTrump. I thought we/they were insignificant? I thought Trump was SO popular that voters would support who he endorsed, etc? What's it going to be?

928066605896142848 2017-11-07 01:08:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The Twitter overlords have heard my cries! I now have #280characters. But really, I dont think my tweeting will change all that much.
928047688289005568 2017-11-07 23:53:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RaffertyNeil Aww, I will 
928044571619217408 2017-11-07 23:40:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I still don't have #280characters. This sexism must not stand.
927989403468881922 2017-11-07 20:01:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @dicentra33 That is entirely unacceptable, not to mention dangerous.

927987646466527237 2017-11-07 19:54:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Serious question: in light of the mistakes made with Devin Kelley, what are your thoughts regarding gun laws? #SutherlandSpringsShooting
927986158784712706 2017-11-07 19:48:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm not saying you are dumb (because I don't think you are), just take issue with that kind of claim. No worries. :)
927985594080419840 2017-11-07 19:46:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> On the other hand, someone could say "Paul is a white male" as a reason to question your gun purchase. I would also take issue with that.
927985196451934209 2017-11-07 19:44:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I know liberal Democrats who are gun owners. To date, these individuals are not responsible for any gun deaths.
927977789415927810 2017-11-07 19:15:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This is a really dumb statement.
927972567549403141 2017-11-07 18:54:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> CNN is reporting that Texas gunman Devin Kelley escaped a mental health facility in 2012.   There were so many red flags.

927538888297590784 2017-11-06 14:11:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @saraschaefer1 Its obvious that Im calling her out. Happy to quote tweet to bring the shame she deserves. Are you going to call her out or just nah?

926616754197008386 2017-11-03 01:07:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @thethriftygene No, its not. Its very helpful to families who adopt. I know many who appreciate it.

926430423034552321 2017-11-03 12:46:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @honeyxpie Cheap answer. Do you know how expensive it is to adopt? Of course this isnt *the* reason, but eliminating it certainly isnt pro-family.
926430064249659392 2017-11-03 12:45:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TheBrandonMorse @FreiherrBraun Thats like saying no one buys a home for the first-time homebuyer credit. Of course the purchase will made anyway, but it definitely helps.

924631760855498752 2017-10-29 13:39:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I love how @JKirk777, who accused me of being an anti-conservative & tried to slam my pro-life cred, deleted all of those tweets. Bless him.

924478580603719680 2017-10-28 03:30:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Timerican @JKirk777 JM, everyone is laughing at you tonight. Might want to log off, kiddo.
924477367090900992 2017-10-28 03:25:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @KeithOlbermann @SlappyWhite17 Understood. I don't agree with everything they do, either.
924476720790626305 2017-10-28 03:23:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @KeithOlbermann @SlappyWhite17 I didn't say it wasn't hypocritical.

924475415929991168 2017-10-28 03:18:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Roger Stone Fan Club members are all kinds of crazy. They think he's a conservative. I guess they believe Trump is one, too.

924472744498130944 2017-10-28 03:07:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Timerican @JKirk777 And still we wait for substance from you. So far, nothing. You don't answer any questions, you just accuse. Sad.
924472397490720768 2017-10-28 03:06:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @kamando I am, too! He's clearly never read anything of mine. And his tweets make no sense.

924469212655112192 2017-10-28 02:53:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @bridgje1966 You do understand that if you support one business' ability to do what they want, you should another. Even if you differ ideologically.
924468742909816833 2017-10-28 02:51:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If you paid any attention to the things that I talk and write about, you'd know that I do. You're free to unfollow, fool. https://twitter.com/JKirk777/status/924468426063704064

924466967368687616 2017-10-28 02:44:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The outrage over Roger Stone's Twitter suspension is something to behold. Like it or not, Twitter is a business and can ban who they want.

921106231007301632 2017-10-19 20:10:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Zigmanfreud The reaction to it during candidate Trump would have been interesting, for sure.

921093543489429504 2017-10-19 19:19:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @IanWhetstone @AtticusGF about meeting women where they are, providing options, caring for them. There is common ground if only people would discuss.
921093252060721152 2017-10-19 19:18:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @IanWhetstone @AtticusGF pictures of aborted babies in their faces. And Ive had great conversations, with those who are on the opposite side of the abortion issue,

921092434930683905 2017-10-19 19:15:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @IanWhetstone @AtticusGF There is much more willingness to discuss the issue and interest in mother + baby, instead of all focus on the baby,  than social media

920391682629230594 2017-10-17 20:50:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @stealthygeek @CalebHowe @davequast Personally, I think this hill is *the* one to die on when it comes to the issue. It is the starting point for my argument.
920387598773874688 2017-10-17 20:34:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @stealthygeek @davequast You are. I definitely cant see you presenting a scenario like he did, though. I think you enjoy reasoned discussion.
920347410689396737 2017-10-17 17:54:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's difficult for me to hear Trump talk about those who have served when he only served as a soldier during the Great STD War of the 1970s.
920343771438600193 2017-10-17 17:40:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TheBrandonMorse @sarailola @streiffredstate @RedState @CalebHowe @thekelliejane @RealKiraDavis I got one, and he's right; y'all are excellent.
920342369475678208 2017-10-17 17:34:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The president's inability to deal with criticism is astonishing. It's all whataboutism and deflection. The man is incurably thin-skinned.
920337699973804033 2017-10-17 17:16:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DatOtherMichael Haha. Love it. 
920325562010398720 2017-10-17 16:28:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @vonzion Yes. If were talking before fertilization thats one thing. If were talking after and frozen before implantation, thats another.
920310155463548929 2017-10-17 15:26:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @vonzion But they have been fertilized. They're just frozen.

920267639250964482 2017-10-17 12:37:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PolitiBunny @sistertoldjah @hboulware @chadfelixg has the same meaning: nothing. No matter what we say, hell brand us as hypocrites. Life *does* indeed begin at conception, and his strawman

920047638044692480 2017-10-16 22:03:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TheRobotRob How is my piece incorrect? It's not. The obvious obsession that Evangelicals have with Trump is nauseating. I say that as an Evangelical.
920046342709432320 2017-10-16 21:58:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TheRobotRob What in your previous replies gave any indication of sarcasm? Nothing. Btw, I guarantee I get much more criticism than you do. ;)

920000010049204225 2017-10-16 18:54:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I and many others can attest to that. It is important to recognize that men play a huge role in helping to create an environment where

I didn't.
919633583039565825 2017-10-15 18:38:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Like I said, there are actual conservatives on there. I think your problem is that it's on Salon, but that doesn't make them non-cons.
919633355297165313 2017-10-15 18:37:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Ok, there are more than that. I can see we won't agree on this one.

919632792509669384 2017-10-15 18:35:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> There are several conservatives on there worth following who have unapologetically stood against the slobbering Trump crowds.
919599817977946114 2017-10-15 16:24:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AtticusGF Weird. Public accounts are actually some of the worst offenders, as youve pointed out.

919056320023719937 2017-10-13 04:24:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @1Silverchannel You assume my education has been lacking because I dont love the same book you do. What a foolish conclusion. Your poor students.

919048760470228992 2017-10-13 03:54:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @1Silverchannel Thats a lot of assuming. I had excellent literature teachers in high school and college. I like many other books. I dont like this one.

916856148887732224 2017-10-07 02:41:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @1Silverchannel This is why pregnancy care centers are so vital. They can provide care/compassion/placement. Pregnancy doesnt mean an end to life.
916848589887950849 2017-10-07 02:11:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @1Silverchannel Yes. Up to $1,500 for first trimester abortion in the clinic.
916848085325832192 2017-10-07 02:09:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @1Silverchannel The Hyde Amendment prohibits use of federal funds for abortion except in cases of rape or incest which then may be covered by Medicaid.

913079287561031680 2017-09-27 16:34:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ProffDaddy @LibertyBelleIII It's obviously not, but it's very telling what you (and others) do and don't have a problem with.
913078314302140416 2017-09-27 16:30:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ProffDaddy @LibertyBelleIII So if we see something than that's a problem...even if we know about other things that occur as well. Hilarious. Got it.
913078043534663682 2017-09-27 16:29:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ProffDaddy @LibertyBelleIII behavior does not. Convenient and very telling. Also, disgusting.
913077939830448128 2017-09-27 16:28:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ProffDaddy @LibertyBelleIII I have no problem with a silent protest by players. Like I said, THAT is the thing that seems to drive some people away but criminal
913077344390324225 2017-09-27 16:26:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ProffDaddy @LibertyBelleIII I see the national anthem is *the line* people can't cross, but abusing others apparently is. Again, selective outrage from NFL fans.
913077162999189504 2017-09-27 16:25:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ProffDaddy @LibertyBelleIII Yes, so all of them are probably lying or something.

909865364300943361 2017-09-18 19:43:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @LilMissRightie @Mellecon I do not understand the women who freak out over Trudeau. Have they heard him speak?

908885433949573120 2017-09-15 02:49:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Unsure why someone on "the Right" would attempt to use this to make a dig at me, but it cements the fact that they were never on my side.https://twitter.com/southernkeeks/status/908884639594491904
908884639594491904 2017-09-15 02:45:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Never apologizing for my pro-life stance. You're free to unfollow if it's a problem.
908858583261032449 2017-09-15 01:02:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lifebythecreek Right. Someone takes a cheap shot at me, you "like" it, and it's my problem for noticing it. Have a good night.
908858120251887616 2017-09-15 01:00:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lifebythecreek That's fine. So I unfollowed.
908857177108090880 2017-09-15 00:56:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lifebythecreek Thanks for liking a tweet that was a dig at me. Nice.

908842564668805123 2017-09-15 23:58:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ScotsFyre @APLMom @HanaFiveO And if some take pro-life digs at others and still others cheer them on, I'm reminded I should have unfollowed them long ago. 
908840297412603904 2017-09-15 23:49:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Really, it's not difficult. Except for some.https://twitter.com/georgewept/status/908838547125239808
908838737227939840 2017-09-15 23:43:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @GeorgeWept Thank you. I have no idea why this is so difficult.
908837292403458048 2017-09-15 23:37:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ScotsFyre @HanaFiveO I was calm. Stacey got personal. Have a good night.
908835894186188802 2017-09-15 23:32:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ScotsFyre @HanaFiveO Weird. I already said this, but Stacey had to flip out and say something about me being pro-life. Childish.https://twitter.com/southernkeeks/status/908796020968083456
908833219277131776 2017-09-15 23:21:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ScotsFyre @HanaFiveO There's ridiculousness, alright.
908828134115545088 2017-09-15 23:01:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ScotsFyre Who is acting like a child, currently 
908827470404743173 2017-09-15 22:58:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Oh, no. I'm crushed.https://twitter.com/scotsfyre/status/908827063418806273
908825988842303489 2017-09-15 22:52:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ScotsFyre So defensive over something so lame, Stacey. All I said is that it wasn't appropriate. But you do you.
908824910025445376 2017-09-15 22:48:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This isn't a good look.https://twitter.com/scotsfyre/status/908824617414004738
908824823601786885 2017-09-15 22:48:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ScotsFyre Sorry, I guess I'm not a dudebro like some.
908821300612870145 2017-09-15 22:34:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Be careful out there. A lot of dumb takes floating around.
908821097759625216 2017-09-15 22:33:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ScotsFyre Maybe it can also just be inappropriate for a guest to say something like that?

908796020968083456 2017-09-15 20:53:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> My take:  - Clay Travis shouldn't be confused with a deep thinker. - It actually wasn't appropriate. - It's not the end of the world.

906598139565658112 2017-09-09 19:20:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> A family is grieving. Politics don't matter. If you're Cardillo, though, that's all that does. People aren't his priority.
906597901085937665 2017-09-09 19:19:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You're free to disagree all you want, but the claims made by a sad man seeking internet points take away from the real issue.
906597633740996608 2017-09-09 19:18:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> But people like Cardillo do this kind of thing. It's their schtick. Sad attempts at the spotlight.
906597443533451264 2017-09-09 19:17:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes, it is disgusting & you are scum if you attempt to blame someone for another's death when they had nothing to do with causing it at all.

904841044117860352 2017-09-04 22:58:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hmm. Not sure how my tweet says the opposite.
904834418010939392 2017-09-04 22:31:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @hopecrolius Not talking about the hurricane at all.
904832905867821059 2017-09-04 22:25:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It would be a good time for the Right to prove that they care about individuals outside the womb, too. Just a reminder.
904812649988448257 2017-09-04 21:05:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @HonkyTonkJew Ditto! 
904810787235123202 2017-09-04 20:57:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Kenkong909 @Phillybama1 I've blocked foolish Ken because he is always after me, routinely twisting my words, and looking for a fight.
904792688540692480 2017-09-04 19:46:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes, Congress should be deciding immigration policy. But Trump passing it to them isn't because he respects the Constitution on this one.
904767228679266304 2017-09-04 18:04:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JuanitaWestaby Thank you! I appreciate that.
904755667713626112 2017-09-04 17:18:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> somewhat closer to you, too.   Ps. Twitter is not life.
904755525900009473 2017-09-04 17:18:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I've made good friends in the past year with people who are on the *opposite* side of the political spectrum. It can be done even for those
904755227882086400 2017-09-04 17:17:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Don't be glad when harm befalls anyone. That they ideologically differ from you, in either a small or large way, is no excuse.
904754812671098881 2017-09-04 17:15:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I have zero interest in spending my day commenting on the seemingly never-ending Conservative Civil War, so I'll end with this...
904748202636738561 2017-09-04 16:49:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If you have no issue with another person being doxxed because you disagree with them, don't act like the pure kind kids at the lunch table.https://twitter.com/southernkeeks/status/904747945127542784

904744315259428864 2017-09-04 16:33:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @jpennix1 @Mr_JamesLandis @VivianJo1 But continue to wave a banner of conservative purity. Except your "compassion" doesn't extend to those you disagree with. Convenient! 
904743882369499140 2017-09-04 16:32:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @jpennix1 @Mr_JamesLandis @VivianJo1 Fine, disagree w/her tweet. But the fact that it changes your feelings about people doxxing her says much about your own lack of compassion.

903323881510981635 2017-08-31 18:29:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @hallmanreport @ChrisSeay104 @industrialstrX2 Then your moral compass is off. Fringe cases = rape or incest are never a reason to abort. Period.

903291792128434176 2017-08-31 16:22:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes, you must be pro-life if you're a CONSERVATIVE.   This is still difficult for some to grasp...

903272319744974848 2017-08-31 15:04:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RedState @heyschreiber About the issue of abortion? Sure. You can call yourself a Republican and be "pro-choice", but don't dare call yourself a conservative.

902561538183221248 2017-08-29 16:00:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PhantomQuasar Agreed. I am the opposite of a Trump cheerleader, but his going there doesn't need to be slammed OR compared to actual suffering.

902309775324667904 2017-08-28 23:19:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PaulsonPhillip And you're spending it cussing people out on Twitter. Typical deplorable.

902188086049865728 2017-08-28 15:16:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> but wrong as to when they began. Also, he's not putting enough (or any, really) blame on the candidate the party chose. A bit one-sided.
902187861394509824 2017-08-28 15:15:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The author only recently became frustrated with the GOP. I say they've been problematic for a while. He's right about some issues they have,

901791900751060993 2017-08-27 13:01:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BidnessClass That's a cop-out.
901788528035725313 2017-08-27 12:48:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Increasingly, the GOP has to rely on others' sins to feel good about theirs. One of many reasons I'm no longer GOP. They deserve to lose.
901788213571964930 2017-08-27 12:47:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Morality is not determined by what someone else did/didn't do. It is a fixed line. You can - and should - call out anyone who violates it.
901787852190699520 2017-08-27 12:45:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> When you mention Arpaio's lack of character & criminality, the Trump GOP faithful will always respond with: "But...Obama!"

901491565822083072 2017-08-26 17:08:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Dear Women: if you chose acting or social work, two low paying careers, don't use gender as a reason that you dislike your paycheck. 
901489427222065152 2017-08-26 17:00:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @molratty @AmieNicoleLICSW Good! Then act like it and don't lie. And change careers if you want to make a doctor's salary. 
901489066335752192 2017-08-26 16:58:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @molratty @AmieNicoleLICSW Watch the video I linked. Learn a bit. Stop wallowing in oppression that doesn't exist. You'll be happier. ;)
901488902564966400 2017-08-26 16:57:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @molratty @AmieNicoleLICSW Experience, hours worked, speciality, etc., all factor in. It's not because you have a vagina. Faux victimhood is a bad look.
901488307732971520 2017-08-26 16:55:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @molratty @AmieNicoleLICSW Hahaha. Any wage gap that exists is based on personal choice, not sexism. Example: you chose social work, not electrical engineering.

901270314746880000 2017-08-25 02:29:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @logical_lauren Sorry, I just happen to disagree your argument.
901267981602258944 2017-08-25 02:20:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @logical_lauren So? It's not as if they're barred from pursuing it. Many choose other careers/focus on motherhood. They shouldn't be pushed any direction.
901266152109875200 2017-08-25 02:12:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @logical_lauren We do have both men and women in Congress. Equal opportunity is not the same as equal outcome and a 50/50 split.
901262831114477568 2017-08-25 01:59:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @logical_lauren And the abortion issue is for all of us to discuss. Let's not fall into the liberal trap saying men should take a backseat on it.
901262363436998656 2017-08-25 01:57:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @logical_lauren Of course they're different, but we don't need more women in office just to have more women in office.
901260310656536576 2017-08-25 01:49:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @logical_lauren Really, just more pro-lifers. Period. We don't need women just to meet some quota.

900784462463676416 2017-08-24 18:18:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @WmTWaterman @ZakiaVazquez There are already numerous services available to women who need help during pregnancy and need help placing a child w/adoptive parents.
900784305747709952 2017-08-24 18:18:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @WmTWaterman @ZakiaVazquez You would be wrong. There is never a reason to *choose* to abort a child. Even the ones listed.

900779260776001536 2017-08-24 17:58:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @WmTWaterman @ZakiaVazquez Abortion is the singling out and killing of the unborn child. Women use it for convenience.
900778967740936193 2017-08-24 17:56:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @WmTWaterman @ZakiaVazquez In that case, when a doctor tries to save both, as they should, it's not called an abortion.

900740739264638977 2017-08-24 15:25:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @theLazyAphorist It has nothing to do with religion. There are plenty of secular pro-lifers. Why can't you call it murder?
900739981525889025 2017-08-24 15:22:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @theLazyAphorist Hopefully you'll get there one day. This is a black and white issue.

900735309259956224 2017-08-24 15:03:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @doloresquintana @ihate_everyone2 It's true. Dolores was all confused and surprised by that stat. It would be amusing if it wasn't so sad.

900733503242981376 2017-08-24 14:56:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And there it is. Dolores admits she rejects science and new, unborn human life. It's all about a woman's "right" to murder.https://twitter.com/doloresquintana/status/900733021174628352
900733199931846656 2017-08-24 14:55:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PandaChristophe @PhantomQuasar @doloresquintana Hahaha. Where do you think I found the EXACT figure that you initially didn't believe??!

900729612027777024 2017-08-24 14:40:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @doloresquintana @PhantomQuasar @PandaChristophe The stat is from Planned Parenthood's own 2015-2016 annual report, which they proudly share.

900729079669936128 2017-08-24 14:38:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @theLazyAphorist Because it IS murder.
900723750785757185 2017-08-24 14:17:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Planned Parenthood took 328,348 unborn lives last year. Everything is not fine. You call it "choice". I call it murder.https://twitter.com/doloresquintana/status/900722851640037376

900718786852122624 2017-08-24 13:57:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes, continue to yell at me for calling Women's March harpies "pro-aborts". I will wrap your anger around me like a warm blanket.
900717966475612160 2017-08-24 13:54:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> "All women" = only the born ones, since the unborn females mean nothing to those like spineless Dolores who masquerade as freedom fighters.https://twitter.com/doloresquintana/status/900717083654103041

899337152051412993 2017-08-20 18:27:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @theLazyAphorist You're right. Their similar views on abortion and white supremacy don't mean a thing.
899333943308189697 2017-08-20 18:14:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I can imagine that Margaret Sanger and Richard Spencer probably would have been pretty good friends. All those shared beliefs.

897582687267016705 2017-08-15 22:16:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Let's be honest. Trump can pretty much say/do anything, and his supporters don't sway from defending him.

897193226188320768 2017-08-14 20:28:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ChChanJu76 Why is it hard to call out our current president when needed? Because he has an (R) next to his name?
897174149520609280 2017-08-14 19:12:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @jgfleet661 @WaskelweeWabbit I know so. The first statement was on Saturday. Today is Monday. Have a good one!
897173663501492225 2017-08-14 19:10:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Thank you :)
897170492838342656 2017-08-14 18:58:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @jgfleet661 @WaskelweeWabbit And wrong, too. ;)
897170089547628545 2017-08-14 18:56:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @jgfleet661 @WaskelweeWabbit Thanks. You just made my point.
897167074035990528 2017-08-14 18:44:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @WaskelweeWabbit Nope. You're absolutely wrong. He wasn't specific and he should have been.
897161844569362433 2017-08-14 18:23:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @8ioh4z4rd Nice whataboutism instead of focusing on the issue now. 
897161000381820928 2017-08-14 18:20:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If Obama had waited a few days to categorically condemn racism in Charlottesville, the Right would be livid.  But Gorsuch!! Or something.
897159261511450626 2017-08-14 18:13:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PolitiBunny @ScottColgate Because my piece says it all. You're just angry I don't prop up your flimsy accusation. Have a good one!

897145567956086785 2017-08-14 17:19:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @benshapiro @PolitiBunny @ScottColgate Maybe you should read the piece instead of just reacting to the title, and think critically instead of just emotionally? Try that.
897130556403658752 2017-08-14 16:19:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This. This. This. It's exactly why I wrote about the alt-right and the POISON they are in my piece yesterday.https://twitter.com/TheRickWilson/status/897129553100976128
897104657427951617 2017-08-14 14:36:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @GoDaddy @MaureenShaw Good question. I can only imagine the site didn't *just* cross the line with that post...

896851681660555266 2017-08-13 21:51:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Exactly. Welcome to my mentions today.
896851615206002688 2017-08-13 21:51:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Unlike you, I don't support racism no matter which side it originates from.https://twitter.com/joedan1024/status/896851320283557888
896850657986191361 2017-08-13 21:47:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I didn't agree with McAuliffe. I called out racism as everyone should. If you can't do that, then you're a racist fool.https://twitter.com/joedan1024/status/896848728723783681
896834981313622016 2017-08-13 20:44:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TaxManBoston Thanks!
896834920357785600 2017-08-13 20:44:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @coopernumpy Hahaha. Not even close.
896834677205585920 2017-08-13 20:43:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @gregghoulden Gregg, if you think this is one of the most biased pieces you've read, you don't read opinion pieces too much.
896827075713273856 2017-08-13 20:13:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @gregghoulden So if it's far below your "standards", why did you retweet it?
896825045900808193 2017-08-13 20:05:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JesseKellyDC Yeah, whatever.   The real issue is what did you do with that other avi?! Why this almost normal one? It's like I don't know you.
896817483604262912 2017-08-13 19:35:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rumpfshaker ...commenting on Carly Fiorina's looks, commenting on Heidi Cruz's looks, etc....
896816698648645636 2017-08-13 19:32:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @abbaa_magaal You do follow me, and when did I say they didn't have a right to march? I said I disagree with them and their racism. Be more observant.
896815785947037697 2017-08-13 19:28:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes, by the way, you are more than welcome to unfollow me if my opinions are too much for you. I'm sure you can find that button.
896815366558625794 2017-08-13 19:27:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TCC_Grouchy @hyperion5182 Sounds like the best option for you if your reaction to an opinion is this hysterical.
896814569854816260 2017-08-13 19:23:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TCC_Grouchy @hyperion5182 So are you just acting juvenile, or should I consider this threatening and report you? Let me know.

896546957107265536 2017-08-12 01:40:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I've been happily ex-GOP for a while, and reactions to today's events only reaffirm that I made the correct decision.
896527258994835456 2017-08-12 00:22:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Inevitably, when you call out *both* sides, you get replies like this from foolish individuals with their own agenda.https://twitter.com/silaas3005/status/896520990401986561

896474293571383296 2017-08-12 20:51:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You should condemn the hatred from both the alt-right and antifa. Don't wallow in whataboutism. They're both wrong.

896093646751121408 2017-08-11 19:39:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If you pick on appearance/style instead of dissecting the substance of someone's political leanings, you've already lost.

893994948445560833 2017-08-05 00:39:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Maybe we shouldn't deem a female to be a "real woman" based on curves/no curves. We come in all sizes. Focus on being healthy, instead.

893952307687301120 2017-08-05 21:50:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @jneutron1969 @TACP_TICK So nothing has been fully proven yet, nor has the case been concluded, and we're only hearing from him. Got it. That's not proof.

893507583797075968 2017-08-04 16:23:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Abortion is the soul of modern feminism. You doubt me? Check out Women's March and #WhatWomenDemand. This is a main reason why I reject it.

892600420337680384 2017-08-01 04:18:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @coolhandschlute @EricaGrieder Erica: the definition of taking out of context to fit her sad little narrative. It's kind of amusing, actually. The work she put into it.
892599607519326209 2017-08-01 04:15:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @EricaGrieder @coolhandschlute @WitteTweets Emphasis on Erica being obtuse.
892599279520333824 2017-08-01 04:13:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @coolhandschlute @EricaGrieder You believe those two words mean I lead with "self interest", but have no basis for that claim. You're purely lashing out.
892598543915122688 2017-08-01 04:10:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @EricaGrieder Yeah, I'm not bothered by my words. They contain neither malice nor celebration at the thought of a difficult situation.
892598003747434497 2017-08-01 04:08:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @coolhandschlute @EricaGrieder Why attack me in the first place, then? Clearly you have some issue with what I said.
892597554654871552 2017-08-01 04:06:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @EricaGrieder I'm not the one offended by a harmless mention of "perfect opportunity". 
892597171475935232 2017-08-01 04:05:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @coolhandschlute @EricaGrieder I can't relate to anyone who thinks helping said woman involves abortion, but I don't discriminate against the unborn like some.
892595070607781888 2017-08-01 03:57:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @EricaGrieder Ooh, because saying "perfect opportunity" probably has another, devious meaning. How dare we lead with compassion for BOTH lives.

892579332660617216 2017-08-01 02:54:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @pierresplace49 We must be realistic. Pregnancy will always happen, so let's offer life-affirminng help to women facing unplanned pregnancies.

891012137371316224 2017-07-28 19:07:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Precious Charlie Gard was another reminder that there is no such thing as a mistaken life. His story and what he taught will live on. 6/x

891011548365422593 2017-07-28 19:04:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> He is healthy and whole, and Charlie was sentenced to state-mandated death because of "quality of life." As pro-lifers, we must not 4/
891011241011015680 2017-07-28 19:03:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This story has struck closer to home than others, because my only child, a son, was born only a few weeks before Charlie. 3/

891010542449696769 2017-07-28 19:00:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The Charlie Gard story, with its heartbreaking end, is just as much of a pro-life issue as the abortion one. Like all life, 1/

890773052824453120 2017-07-27 03:17:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @e2pilot I'm not impressed with the compromise.
890772577085526016 2017-07-27 03:15:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The #SkinnyRepeal would defund @PPact for one year.  1. I think that's pretty weak.  2. No matter what, PP will continue to thrive.
890772289528238082 2017-07-27 03:13:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I have a much better idea than a #SkinnyRepeal. How about take government out of health care entirely?
890771059124862976 2017-07-27 03:09:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @e2pilot Well yeah, but we need long term.
890770338971254784 2017-07-27 03:06:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @e2pilot Actually, it would only defund PP for *one* year and transfer funds to community health centers.

890563872930877440 2017-07-27 13:25:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Good morning, y'all 
890561794133118976 2017-07-27 13:17:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If they believe themselves to be another gender entirely, they already have severe emotional issues and should *not* be in theater. https://twitter.com/lovelife201114/status/890561167252475904

890373688587145218 2017-07-26 00:50:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> At the heart of it, we should care about others. True compassion isn't cosmetically masking an internal issue, but addressing it.

890246692028768256 2017-07-26 16:25:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The president should absolutely step away from Twitter. If you don't think so, you're more concerned with celebrity and being entertained.

890170637192503296 2017-07-26 11:23:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @USAF_Aviator I know. Erin will probably do better next time.

890167592987627520 2017-07-26 11:11:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RebeccaWalden58 Observe a few of the tweeter's other tweets and their bio first. It always helps. 
890166922406494208 2017-07-26 11:08:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Erin? It's sarcasm. The "slated to automatically die" didn't give that away? 
890050820061974531 2017-07-25 03:27:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Mr_JamesLandis You are correct. Lied about this...and many other things.

890048223297056768 2017-07-25 03:16:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I stopped counting how many people believed I was being serious with this tweet, and proceeded to reprimand me.  Come on, y'all.https://twitter.com/SouthernKeeks/status/889952846522843137
890047740692049921 2017-07-25 03:14:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @andreavhowe @BlueStateRedMom Looks like you both missed that it was sarcasm. It's ok. Several people did. ;)
890046652207304707 2017-07-25 03:10:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> - Blacks make up 14% of the US pop. but 36% of abortions.  - In NYC black babies are more likely to be aborted than born.   You were saying?https://twitter.com/HuffPostWomen/status/890044523564367872

889992538073047040 2017-07-25 23:35:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AlPenwasser It's sarcasm 
889978791510016000 2017-07-25 22:40:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I can't wait until tomorrow to read all those tweets about the woke 7 year olds who discussed health care policy at the breakfast table.
889976568952623104 2017-07-25 22:32:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Mellecon Thank you.  The mute button is my friend. Better yet, fantastic, like-minded people such as yourself help quite a bit.

889955857135534082 2017-07-25 21:09:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hysterics from a Rolling Stone writer. Business as usual. https://twitter.com/theseantcollins/status/889950790655385600
889952846522843137 2017-07-25 20:57:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The health care vote doesn't mean much to me, because as a woman, I'm slated to automatically die when Planned Parenthood is defunded. :(

889590352306417664 2017-07-24 20:57:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @otter272 Is this a serious question?
889589882246619138 2017-07-24 20:55:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @otter272 So? "If you menstruate, you are a female." <----This is still a fact.
889589481711566848 2017-07-24 20:53:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> "Your" statement in no way undermines mine. The fact of the matter is that we live in an increasingly pro-death society.https://twitter.com/alphapapa1/status/889587298471432192

889582298882068480 2017-07-24 20:25:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Sorry, I don't think the presence of or lack of a female press secretary says much about a president or political party as a whole. #meh
889581008277966848 2017-07-24 20:20:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> That's fine, but how much does it actually mean? I prefer the best people be hired for a job. Race/gender shouldn't be an issue.https://twitter.com/dcexaminer/status/889577446768615425
889547076979363840 2017-07-24 18:05:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @presjpolk "But...he fights!!"
889524222342696960 2017-07-24 16:34:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Sadly, too many rightly mourning Charlie Gard's state-mandated death sentence would support his destruction were he still in the womb.
889488025922752512 2017-07-24 14:10:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The experimental treatment may have not improved the situation, but Charlie's parents should have been allowed to try. SHAME on the courts.https://twitter.com/CNN/status/889481318039506945
889344116533886976 2017-07-23 04:38:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @J_B_Maguire The individual is a female, but transgender, calls herself a man, and declares that men have periods, etc, etc.
889340942926434306 2017-07-23 04:26:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If you menstruate, you are a female. Neither different pronouns, nor haircuts, nor cosmetic surgery, nor feelings change this.https://twitter.com/HuffPost/status/889239150095978497
889245398598119424 2017-07-23 22:06:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @inperilous1 Yeah, you're not making sense.
889243734277332997 2017-07-23 22:00:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @inperilous1 Yes, unqualified. You're not getting a wall. All you can say is "but, Gorsuch!". Any GOP president would have done that.
889234178268639232 2017-07-23 21:22:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The best thing about Trump's Twitter is that with it, he continues to prove what we've always known: he's thin-skinned & unqualified. Sad!

889178570412756992 2017-07-23 17:41:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @icapturpix I did not support or vote for Cruz. I was Walker, Rubio, then 3rd party on election day. You are wrong, which I'm sure is a habit of yours.
889177155116183552 2017-07-23 17:35:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Example of a sore winner? @icapturpix, who continues to berate me for not automatically supporting Trump.   Sorry. Cultism isn't my thing.
889176392323264512 2017-07-23 17:32:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @icapturpix You claim to be tired of my opinions, yet you clearly aren't familiar with them or the candidates I supported. Stop being a sore winner

889144610995535872 2017-07-23 15:26:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @icapturpix @TCC_Grouchy We should praise the good and condemn the bad of any elected politician. Anything other is tribalism.

886311635110985728 2017-07-15 19:48:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @VouxCroux Like I said. Supporting the delusion is not compassion.
886308984982048768 2017-07-15 19:38:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @USInGodWeTrust @Mellecon @PolitiBunny @justinamash And they should.
886308761404665856 2017-07-15 19:37:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @USInGodWeTrust @PolitiBunny @justinamash Respectfully, sir, this piece (which I did not write) regards your own vote. As far as the other, I've called them out plenty of times.
886307567839969280 2017-07-15 19:32:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @USInGodWeTrust @Mellecon @PolitiBunny @justinamash On this? Yes. And President Trump is no conservative.
886305889132699649 2017-07-15 19:26:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @USInGodWeTrust @justinamash @Mellecon @PolitiBunny We should definitely not be paying for any sort of transgender related surgery. We should also not support the mindset. But that's me.
886305565483442177 2017-07-15 19:24:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Don't expect me to support the delusion that is transgenderism. That's not actually compassion.
886304321503186947 2017-07-15 19:19:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @KentrixChip Click on the article. I didn't write. I agree with it, though.
886304162232881152 2017-07-15 19:19:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @USInGodWeTrust @justinamash @PolitiBunny @Mellecon Exactly. Supporting the delusion of transgenderism is not compassion, in my opinion. Quite a slippery slope.
886303445111754752 2017-07-15 19:16:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @USInGodWeTrust @Mellecon @justinamash @PolitiBunny Disagree. As Susan wrote, it was a betrayal of conservative principle and our military. And it was.

883509378971774976 2017-07-07 02:13:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MisfitsPolitics Nah
883500647840141312 2017-07-07 01:39:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> .@shanacarp said more than anything, abortion saves women's lives. Incorrect. The majority of abortions are for ease/comfort, not health.pic.twitter.com/ZzaWkr3Qp2
883499356946608128 2017-07-07 01:33:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Oh, you mean this? "Reasons U.S. Women Have Abortions: Quantitative and Qualitative Perspectives" https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/journals/3711005.pdfhttps://twitter.com/shanacarp/status/883497531237437440
883492391407280128 2017-07-07 01:06:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I gave you a fact, which you ignored since it undermined your already excessively weak argument. Pro-woman AND pro-baby is possible. Try it.https://twitter.com/shanacarp/status/883491369108549632
883485723072098305 2017-07-07 00:39:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Then why would you take the time to kill the child in that instance? Doctors work to save both, not kill first.https://twitter.com/shanacarp/status/883484817928728576
883484532833476609 2017-07-07 00:35:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @shanacarp It does matter. Your claim is that legal abortions save maternity wards from being filled with dying mothers. It's fear-mongering at best.
883482836640174080 2017-07-07 00:28:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @shanacarp Absurd argument. The majority of abortions are not done for life of mother. They are done because a child would interrupt future plans.

881927358080581633 2017-07-03 17:27:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Good. There should be no other conclusion.https://twitter.com/abcpolitics/status/881926694919163905
881906209992970245 2017-07-03 16:03:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It should bother everyone, including those who voted for neither major party candidate, such as myself.
881905926315356160 2017-07-03 16:02:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> When media says "now more than ever" they must hold pols accountable, that reaffirms bias & purposeful lack of effort previously.
881893791485054977 2017-07-03 15:13:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket Yes. I didn't feel oppressed at all while making my decision.
881888471069188096 2017-07-03 14:52:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The problem is assuming women don't have the opportunity to run for office. We do. Many of us just choose not to...and that's ok.https://twitter.com/politico/status/881885267048759297

881709187507646465 2017-07-02 03:00:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Today I... - wrote a piece about how I can't stand Trump's use of social media - defended his freedom to use social media   #Murica
881707591709097984 2017-07-02 02:54:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Judging from your tweet asking for his suspension, you do. ;)https://twitter.com/sethabramson/status/881707288188391424

881704491262894080 2017-07-02 02:41:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I didn't vote for him and his tweeting is often juvenile, but your claim is inane.https://twitter.com/sethabramson/status/881538495805886467

881691331495677952 2017-07-02 01:49:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @coolhandschlute What a weird looking cat.

881635280628920324 2017-07-02 22:06:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Setting aside politics, at least we can all agree that July is the month when one should begin listening to Christmas music.

881578696037060609 2017-07-02 18:21:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ian_mckelvey @PolitiBunny Too many on the Right don't understand this. That's the problem.

881551026364579840 2017-07-02 16:31:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaptYonah @JesseKellyDC @SohlerSarah I wouldn't know. He purposely ignored me at the RedState Gathering in 2015.
881540586951630849 2017-07-02 15:50:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> When your loyalty is to people and not principles, you'll find yourself defending every stupid thing they do. #Cult45
881539903741362176 2017-07-02 15:47:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ian_mckelvey Thank you. Why can't we be bothered by both?
881537753443442689 2017-07-02 15:39:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JesseKellyDC If you're 20 and living in the college dorms.
881536367381143553 2017-07-02 15:33:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @joedah87 @molratty Too many who found Obama's behavior bothersome think Trump's is amusing. The GOP is just as cultish as the Left.
881535102181937158 2017-07-02 15:28:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @KT_So_It_Goes Thank you. Spot-on.
881534366303883268 2017-07-02 15:25:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JesseKellyDC Good lord.
881533347561746432 2017-07-02 15:21:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @molratty He isn't popular enough? We have a bunch of fools drooling all over his supposed strength. That's a problem.
881532886872141824 2017-07-02 15:19:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @molratty I'm going with both. 
881531025272307712 2017-07-02 15:12:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @hale_razor @IntellectShorty I don't give a pass to politicians just because of the (R) next to their name. Some do.
881519362401869824 2017-07-02 14:26:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @hale_razor Cultism makes everything seem right to you.
881518145193861120 2017-07-02 14:21:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @1Kishka Very depressing
881517390701502466 2017-07-02 14:18:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @hale_razor So you have no issues with THIS president's behavior then? That speaks volumes. I really thought you had more common sense, buddy.
881516170670735361 2017-07-02 14:13:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> So many that I once had a decent amount of respect for are not bothered with the president's antics. Both frustrating and eye-opening.
881515572458131456 2017-07-02 14:11:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Or we could stop obsessing over whataboutism to make ourselves feel better, and agree that Trump devolves the office, too? Hmm  https://twitter.com/hale_razor/status/881513244388610048
881511177892876289 2017-07-02 13:53:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TheSteve12 See above. If the Right doesn't get that, we deserve to lose.
881509554550448128 2017-07-02 13:47:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TheSteve12 He's not qualified for anything. He's a cheap reality star. Winning is not the same as winning WELL, as we can clearly see. Such a joke.
881507904884486145 2017-07-02 13:40:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> We had far better options among the field of GOP candidates, but voters chose juvenile insults and style over substance. #Cult45

881303408006885376 2017-07-01 00:08:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @realDonaldTrump @Brent77A Cult 45 acts like Cult 44. Sad.

881301024568475648 2017-07-01 23:58:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Response to my belief that the president's social media antics are not helpful. Pure cultism.pic.twitter.com/7ljlQQT6F1

880597088375119874 2017-06-29 01:21:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Such absurdity. You're attacked, so you stoop low as well? How very brave. What a fighter! Lulz.https://twitter.com/politico/status/880595792343560196

880482054466654208 2017-06-29 17:44:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JoshGuckert Like I said, you must not be paying attention. Dana calls out both sides when necessary, just like we all should.
880480633587458048 2017-06-29 17:38:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JoshGuckert Regardless, many are claiming the ad nearly calls for a civil war. It....doesn't. Let's be honest about that.
880480443581202433 2017-06-29 17:37:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JoshGuckert Numbers 2-4 greatly color your opinion, and if you think Loesch hero worships Trump at all, you've clearly not been paying attention.
880478895262314499 2017-06-29 17:31:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JoshGuckert How? And the claim it basically calls for a civil war is absolutely false. That's what the other side is saying.

877916209068429312 2017-06-22 15:48:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes, random internet feminist, ALL CAPS will endear me to your side. That's the ticket. 
877910783564300290 2017-06-22 15:26:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Rare @MadFiest You've described exactly what women were told when Hillary was campaigning.

877875870286860288 2017-06-22 13:08:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> For example, PP is closing 4 clinics in Iowa later this summer. Did you know that? Probably not.
877875314444992512 2017-06-22 13:05:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hardly. It serves a huge purpose and shows that PP is not necessary. It is vastly outnumbered.
877872027037818880 2017-06-22 12:52:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If you think this is way off, you're incorrect.
877871866672816128 2017-06-22 12:52:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PPact For example, several PP clinics have closed since the chart was made (I didn't make it), but you should appreciate the disparity it shows.
877869534169976835 2017-06-22 12:43:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PPact This is from August 2015, so there may be minor changes both directions, but it certainly shows the gap between PP and other clinics.

877498375368781824 2017-06-21 12:08:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PerspicaciousXY @Mrsc2one The donations come from Planned Parenthood Action Fund, a PAC set up to support candidates. However, it still shows how much $ they have.

877350045380730881 2017-06-20 02:18:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Planned Parenthood donated to both Clinton & Ossoff campaigns. Both lost. It shouldn't be surprising, though, since abortion is their thing.

873609759315906560 2017-06-10 18:36:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @kat_samb The worst I got this past year were threats from Trump supporters who didn't like that I wasn't a fan of his. Both sides have work to do.

873342209202016258 2017-06-09 00:53:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Science confirms life's beginnings.  Christianity praises God as the Creator of life.   These work harmoniously to form my pro-life stance.

872093517367181316 2017-06-06 14:11:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @SentinelHDD Yes, because it was men who stormed these beaches on June 6, 1944. This isn't difficult.
872092726103334912 2017-06-06 14:08:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @bigricanman @mklipstx So was mine. It's pretty clear that I'm specifically talking about storming the beaches on this day of days, 73 years ago today.

870716530018762753 2017-06-02 18:59:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Maybe the reason Hillary didn't visit WI and MI during her campaign is that she wanted to reduce her carbon footprint.

870379531915243520 2017-06-01 20:40:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The Paris Climate Agreement was never going to save the world. Not sure if y'all knew that or not.
870365066637352960 2017-06-01 19:42:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It always amazes me that climate alarmists claim science backs their cause but willfully deny the established science of conception.

867882571467808770 2017-05-25 23:18:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Today's conservative Twitter has been whataboutism and infighting. Gee, so refreshing.
867869251847290881 2017-05-25 22:25:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @WallyStummy None of that is reason to body slam. You're kind of dense.
867862717612163072 2017-05-25 21:59:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @billyrichlive You should stick up for unborn life. Men are just as much a part of the pregnancy equation, right?
867862091830624256 2017-05-25 21:57:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @molratty I see Tim loves defending this guy but hates when others joke about their wives making "sammiches." So brave.

867808373550579712 2017-05-25 18:23:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The Trump-fueled "but he's a fighter!" mentality is a huge problem within GOP. Exchanging sense for style is something we must stop doing.

867387699682045952 2017-05-24 14:31:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Cafazza @SleeveDidIt They *are* punishing her because of pregnancy. Others who violated that pledge, but didn't end up pregnant, are sure getting off easy.

862841457643851777 2017-05-11 01:26:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @austyle70 Just because someone talks politics as part-time or full-time pursuit doesn't mean they aren't interested in other things :)
862840895904903170 2017-05-11 01:24:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @austyle70 Have I been to a rock concert? Of course. NCAA basketball is my favorite sport, London is my favorite place, and I adore @CHVRCHES.
862839950101946368 2017-05-11 01:20:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @austyle70 Writing about politics/culture is my passion, so of course I enjoy it and do it regularly.
862837140455137285 2017-05-11 01:09:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @austyle70 Meaningful conversations are always fun.
862830540067672064 2017-05-11 00:43:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Anyway, worth remembering that real people sit behind these keyboards. (I mean, unless you're a bot.)
862830289894223873 2017-05-11 00:42:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I've had excellent conversations that grew from conflict with those on my side & those on the other side of the political spectrum.
862829102000205825 2017-05-11 00:37:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I prefer serious one-on-one conversations on here if you take serious issue with something I've said or how I've said it.

862698744982241281 2017-05-11 15:59:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @LLMajer 
862696090331734016 2017-05-11 15:49:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It would seem that many of us reside in the in-between where we often view both the administration and mainstream media as loathsome.
862693186887700481 2017-05-11 15:37:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Exactly
862632430225829890 2017-05-11 11:36:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Ultimately, it was best to block those certain toxic individuals who consider themselves arbiters of both conservativsm and Christianity.

862459700322996224 2017-05-10 00:09:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @elisecterry @MBGlenn We're not going to agree on some things, and that's fine. Have a good night.
862459547717427200 2017-05-10 00:09:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @elisecterry @MBGlenn Which was an absurd thing to say, especially because of the tweet he referenced.
862458397022728193 2017-05-10 00:04:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MBGlenn @elisecterry My initial issue.
862457470974922754 2017-05-10 00:00:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MBGlenn Like I said, not defending it. Plenty of issues on every side.
862456746056482818 2017-05-10 23:58:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MBGlenn I'm definitely not a fan of that at all. Not defending it.

862453447794282497 2017-05-10 23:45:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @sarahmquinlan Sarah, I'm not him. Do you point out what your friends who like to judge others constantly need to work on? Would love to see that.
862452828077522944 2017-05-10 23:42:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @sarahmquinlan Great. Share your concerns with him. I'm not him. I have things to work on myself. Tim and others act as if they don't.
862446043971170304 2017-05-10 23:15:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @EWErickson @thecivilcomment @CTBellows That's tough for TBC and Tim. They only focus on others.

862003419132944385 2017-05-09 17:56:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @im_marcie @chrisantenucci They publish conservative views quite often. Haven't read them all.
862001486779346944 2017-05-09 17:49:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @im_marcie @chrisantenucci It's the op-ed section. They publish varying opinions.
861997277304561664 2017-05-09 17:32:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The frenetic feminist response to the NYT op-ed decrying abortion as the solution to economic problems faced by women is fun to behold.

860142898272251904 2017-05-04 14:43:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If you say "reproductive justice" and only talk of ONE person in the mother-baby equation, you're not talking about real justice at all.
860142397468139521 2017-05-04 14:41:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> "Reproductive justice" is a term the Left loves to disseminate in an effort to disguise the horrors of abortion.
860141494417715200 2017-05-04 14:38:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Self-awareness is not a thing for the organization which, as per the last available annual report, took 323,999 unborn lives.https://twitter.com/PPact/status/859543901035794432

859849071972020224 2017-05-03 19:16:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PPact @fury_ian @chrispumpelly You've made clear that part of your worldview is built upon disinterest in protecting and defending unborn life. The BS is all you.
859848695721984000 2017-05-03 19:14:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PPact @fury_ian @chrispumpelly I stand for life, unashamedly share the absolute truth of the abortion industry, and don't apologize to fools like you.

859498319529291776 2017-05-02 20:02:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hillary was a horrible, horrible candidate. That's not the fault of the electorate, Comey, or systemic sexism. It's all hers.

852730134977052678 2017-04-13 03:48:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TheDemocrats @ChrisLoesch @danobrien1972 The life issue is a huge part of the foundation of conservatism. You can't be pro-abort and a conservative. It doesn't work.
852729009209171969 2017-04-13 03:43:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TheDemocrats @ChrisLoesch @danobrien1972 Dan, your statement is an absolute cop-out. Popularity should never be more important than principle, esp one concerning sanctity of life.

849471183082971136 2017-04-04 03:58:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Don't blame the world if you chose a degree which made you feel good, but isn't sought after by employers.   Choices are hard.
849470672971628544 2017-04-04 03:56:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @sjsturkie Someone willing to fill a practical position, even if they have no degree, is more sought after than an entitled graduate degree holder.
849469904965292032 2017-04-04 03:53:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @sjsturkie I see from your blog it's an MFA in Writing and Poetics. You have to realize that's not an in demand degree.
849469265145102338 2017-04-04 03:50:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @sjsturkie Sounds like your degree was emotionally fulfilling, but not something employers were/are looking for. That's not oppression, dear.

849453778764009472 2017-04-04 02:48:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @sjsturkie So...what does your husband do and what's your degree in?

844187705273700353 2017-03-21 14:03:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No, supporting abortion in cases of rape or incest is not really a pro-life position. Shocker.
844187477598486529 2017-03-21 14:02:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Life should be protected from its beginning, which is conception. I also don't support abortion for rape/incest. Feel free to DM to chat.https://twitter.com/hboulware/status/844186502640926720
844187081488420864 2017-03-21 14:00:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You responded to my tweet about conservatism. No, I don't believe one is a conservative if they're "pro-choice". Life is fundamental.https://twitter.com/hboulware/status/844186502640926720
844186395887525892 2017-03-21 13:58:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @hboulware I'm sad that you think we should punish the child for someone else's crime. Neither rape nor incest are reasons for abortion.
844185582481952772 2017-03-21 13:55:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This right here. So very much.https://twitter.com/MattWalshBlog/status/843972757620711424
844183904374472705 2017-03-21 13:48:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I don't know. Are you pro-life? I think you've stayed before that "life begins at conception" isn't where you stand. That's an issue.https://twitter.com/hboulware/status/844180021724004352
843995106072059904 2017-03-20 01:18:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Goodnight, Twitter. Be better.
843992853294596096 2017-03-20 01:09:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @skeltonjess Congratulations. You're a fool.
843991422164488192 2017-03-20 01:03:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Remember when you disagreed with me? ;)
843988544242810881 2017-03-20 00:52:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The serious lack of spine among the "conservative" crowd in the past several days has exposed many to the light. Sad, but necessary.
843988251140603905 2017-03-20 00:50:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Why is this so difficult?  1. Abortion *is* a black and white issue.  2. You can't be "pro-choice/pro-abort" & call yourself a conservative.
843987837351596034 2017-03-20 00:49:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @LilMissRightie I respectfully, but wholeheartedly, disagree.
843987757009649665 2017-03-20 00:48:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @goblueedelblute Yeah, you're entirely wrong. You would do well to watch this. https://twitter.com/SouthernKeeks/status/843895600856911872 @LilMissRightie

842933659787296768 2017-03-17 03:00:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> There are so many spineless "conservatives" out there, willing to overlook those who support abortion.
842933193217118209 2017-03-17 02:58:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You're a fool. Being for murder of the unborn is NOT a tenet of conservatism. Pro-life is all that is acceptable. Period.https://twitter.com/DanielStevens12/status/842932244457164800

842930316805357568 2017-03-17 02:47:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The "big tent" of conservatism is not big enough for pro-aborts. This is a good thing.

842840872584667136 2017-03-17 20:51:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @jasincole Nah, you labeled yourself with your "I'm rather pro-life...but abortion!" statement.

837068643368386561 2017-03-01 22:34:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The outrage as my suggestion that you can't be pro-woman without being pro-life highlights the need to continue stating that. And I will.

836989659163029508 2017-03-01 17:20:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Too many refuse to promote life. I will tell them they're wrong. Repeatedly.   You catch on fast.https://twitter.com/schulertime/status/836988888849641472

836986722869264386 2017-03-01 17:09:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Correct. Discriminating against unborn females (and males), sentencing them to death and calling it "choice" is not pro-woman.https://twitter.com/schulertime/status/836986157724377088

833805808148295681 2017-02-20 22:29:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Dolphieness Milo is no conservative. @NRO @CPAC

833793742733766658 2017-02-20 21:41:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Well, Monday has been fun. Super excited about what Tuesday will bring.
833792756485070848 2017-02-20 21:37:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Stop acting like CPAC ruined free speech forever by disinviting Milo and that you're on some holy crusade. Yeah, start there.https://twitter.com/laurenacooley/status/833792459297718273
833791528866893824 2017-02-20 21:32:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Stop acting like CPAC is a college campus, stop defending speech which seeks to legitimize child abuse, and maybe draw a line somewhere.https://twitter.com/laurenacooley/status/833791097889554440
833790138346045440 2017-02-20 21:27:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @KIR_bigg50 @Seanbeandood Check my timeline. I've made myself clear.

833788348414226432 2017-02-20 21:20:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The excuses coming out of the Milo debacle are just groundbreaking in their stupidity.
833788033342255104 2017-02-20 21:18:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Uh...how is his free speech tampered by being disinvited from CPAC? Weak argument.https://twitter.com/laurenacooley/status/833781537929822208
833786142680035331 2017-02-20 21:11:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This is what happens when you believe winning is more important than principle. You think Trump is a role model.https://twitter.com/laurenacooley/status/833754394525052929

833766096545120256 2017-02-20 19:51:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BenHowe Because of course.
833747142963511296 2017-02-20 18:36:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I still question a lot of CPAC, but on this, then did end up doing the right thing. I'll give them that.

833659577556164608 2017-02-20 12:48:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @chadfelixg It's revolting that Milo is kind of seen as the ambassador for gay conservatives.

833540255768801280 2017-02-19 04:54:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Can't wait for Tomi L's (continued) excuses regarding Milo. I imagine we're all just "snowflakes" for not liking him. #eyeroll
833536373328068608 2017-02-19 04:38:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Years and years ago.
833534418908241924 2017-02-19 04:31:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> From Milo fans: "You're just threatened by those who win."  If he is what's winning, I'd rather lose.
833529398863286272 2017-02-19 04:11:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Jealous!

833513229783543809 2017-02-19 03:06:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Really. Zero difference between blind obsession for Obama and blind obsession for Trump. Stellar job, GOP.
833512800886603776 2017-02-19 03:05:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> "We'll invite Milo...because he loves Trump and freedom!"  Lol.

833511628679294976 2017-02-19 03:00:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RipdaeRedrum I'm not a liberal. Milo is no conservative. Worst of all, see below.https://twitter.com/ReaganBattalion/status/833405993006616576
833510027415654401 2017-02-19 02:54:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Stop saying Milo "tells it like it is" and those who don't like his style are "thin-skinned." Stop your fanboying. Put down the Kool-aid.

833468111022071810 2017-02-19 00:07:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lifebythecreek writer goes a bit too far in the other direction. Also, I'd love to hear how she feels about abortion.

833384836446482432 2017-02-19 18:36:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Lol. Trump isn't a conservative. Milo just said on Maher's show this week that he isn't one, either. @Sweetpea593
833383399230435334 2017-02-19 18:31:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> He's a self-described non-conservative. He doesn't belong there. He trolls a lot. Doesn't mean he's intelligent. @Sweetpea593

833085326189088769 2017-02-18 22:46:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lrc328 Yes. She spent a good portion of her life fighting for the pro-life cause.

832412109631811584 2017-02-16 02:11:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CalebHowe I can't imagine why they're feeling delegitimized...
832361209668239361 2017-02-16 22:49:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This is good: - the press is shaken up - voters might start realizing that elections have consequences
832360989601439745 2017-02-16 22:48:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I didn't vote for Trump. This is probably obvious. He is also my president. It's so amazing how the two can coincide.
832360453024137217 2017-02-16 22:46:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The press that doesn't want to be delegitimized was quick to delegitimize the election of a president. Sorry, doesn't work that way.

827196428707569665 2017-02-02 16:46:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No, Trump isn't a great spokesperson for the Christian faith. Neither was Obama. For real examples, look closer to home.
827195736483831808 2017-02-02 16:43:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> ...and the same people had no issue with Obama's appearances, the same president who asked God to bless Planned Parenthood. Heh.https://twitter.com/LivingBlueinRed/status/827164189710045184

826664139846189058 2017-01-31 05:31:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Apparently, if I praise Trump for his choice then I'm approving of everything Trump has ever done. Absolute absurdity.

826660578865401857 2017-01-31 05:16:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Really. Praising Trump for his nomination of Gorsuch isn't caving or giving up. Praise the good, condemn the bad. Common sense.
826659891335069697 2017-01-31 05:14:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JaybeeStewee He didn't fall. He is praising Trump for his nominee. If you can't do that, you're just as cultish as the others. @EWErickson
826649777001603072 2017-01-31 04:33:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @philly_cheesest Well, sober thinking isn't everyone's thing.  @kate_sills @AtticusGF

826643859362947072 2017-01-31 04:10:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes, you're being foolish if you can't praise Trump for his SCOTUS pick. It doesn't mean you approve of Trump in his entirety.
826643218351681541 2017-01-31 04:07:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @kate_sills @KFoleyFL @AtticusGF Lol. This is getting hilarious.

826642712573132800 2017-01-31 04:05:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AtticusGF @kate_sills @KFoleyFL When did I say I approve of Trump in his entirety or his personality? Seriously, Kyle, calm down.
826642562593259520 2017-01-31 04:05:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @kate_sills @KFoleyFL @AtticusGF And amazingly, I still have no problem with my tweets or my praising of Trump for a good decision.

826641815092723713 2017-01-31 04:02:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> My assessment was correct from the beginning. Some can't handle praising Trump for good choices.https://twitter.com/AtticusGF/status/826641483520372736
826641120578904069 2017-01-31 03:59:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If you've already given Trump a complete stamp of approval or disapproval, you're wrong. This isn't hard.

826639548696375296 2017-01-31 03:53:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AtticusGF @kate_sills I've interacted with you both. You're excellent at histrionics.
826639327644024832 2017-01-31 03:52:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AtticusGF Well, I've never been a fan of yours, so no big deal if you dislike me. @EclecticHonesty @kate_sills
826639181858357249 2017-01-31 03:51:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I have been adamantly against Trump since the beginning. I am also capable of thanking him for doing something good. Why can't you?https://twitter.com/AtticusGF/status/826638851212865536

826638501848502272 2017-01-31 03:49:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @kate_sills @AtticusGF I never typed it. I just said refer to EE's tweet.
826638384470884352 2017-01-31 03:48:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Ones like @kate_sills and @AtticusGF can't truly be excited about Gorsuch because Trump nominated him. Wow.
826637539289268225 2017-01-31 03:45:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @kate_sills @AtticusGF See EE's last few words....
826637388034220032 2017-01-31 03:44:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yeah, we should definitely not be glad he nominated Gorsuch. Not at all. That would be unacceptable.https://twitter.com/kate_sills/status/826636405627424768

826602807507705857 2017-01-31 01:27:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> How can you tell if Trump's nominee is fantastic? Check NARAL's angry tweets. #winninghttps://twitter.com/NARAL/status/826598049334038528
826601397504339968 2017-01-31 01:21:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No worries. Didn't think that at all.
826601105673052160 2017-01-31 01:20:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And I appreciate it.  Definitely happy to be incorrect about this.

826599105254223872 2017-01-31 01:12:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Thank you, President Trump, for nominating Gorsuch to #SupremeCourt.
826594021250318338 2017-01-31 00:52:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump is more pro-LGBT than Obama was upon assuming office, but hysterics and everything.
826559953821433857 2017-01-31 22:37:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I couldn't care less about the "common man" aspect. Gorsuch is an originalist, and the best successor to Scalia.https://twitter.com/momof8fay/status/826558102644350976

825032908301881344 2017-01-27 17:29:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Like it or not, biological women were given the privilege of holding, protecting, sustaining unborn life. It's an honor. #MarchforLife

825017083092086785 2017-01-27 16:26:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> One abortion procedure involves injecting Digoxin into the beating heart of an unborn child in order to kill it. That's murder. Period. https://twitter.com/sirenshampoo/status/825016207543672835

824278150020378624 2017-01-25 15:29:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RIAWAHINE Many, many cheaper options of birth control available. It isn't a "right". Also, maybe close your legs? ;)
824276200910680066 2017-01-25 15:22:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @NooneOfan There are other options for those women. It doesn't have to be the pill.
824275260304486400 2017-01-25 15:18:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Sprintec, "the pill", is at Walmart and Target for under $15, has the same effectiveness as an IUD, and won't get lost in your body. ;)https://twitter.com/NooneOfan/status/824271015249379329

823341885951541251 2017-01-22 01:29:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And the fool continues to rage on... https://twitter.com/bec_pc/status/823341776937295872
823341606950600704 2017-01-22 01:28:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yeah, that crazy idea that pro-life includes all skin colors.https://twitter.com/honestyredacted/status/823341341056925699
823340426824388609 2017-01-22 01:23:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> What would you call condemning a new life to death based merely on location and stage of development? https://twitter.com/bec_pc/status/823340144304553984
823339901882167297 2017-01-22 01:21:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @1975bassgroove Perfect example --> @bec_pc
823339466223976449 2017-01-22 01:20:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lxgracexl @BVan87 You're having actual trouble with it?  https://twitter.com/Lorilynsanity/status/823338396357537797

823338030836617216 2017-01-22 01:14:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> They don't have a funding issue. They spent $30 million trying to get Hillary and other pro-aborts elected. Didn't work out so well. https://twitter.com/TruthCrusader3/status/823337749193379842
823337732042846210 2017-01-22 01:13:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Won't be stopping! :)

823335955243343872 2017-01-22 01:06:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No, I compared discrimination/death of human life to discrimination/death of human life. And wash that mouth out. https://twitter.com/bec_pc/status/823331464104263680

823314640805494784 2017-01-22 23:41:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @mjpayne_ It's my passion
823305022180126724 2017-01-22 23:03:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Human rights begin in the womb. #RoeVWade
823304931423780864 2017-01-22 23:02:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I've been pro-life since I learned what abortion was & will proudly remain vocal in real life and online. Unashamed. Undeterred. #RoeVWade
823303817655631875 2017-01-22 22:58:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I hope one day America looks back on abortion like it now does slavery, and wonder how it was ever permitted. #RoeVWade
823240800909848577 2017-01-22 18:47:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The modern-day feminist movement uses the phrase in an effort to place men below - not alongside - them. Take it up with those gals. https://twitter.com/TBCJay/status/823239720041902080

823231018928930819 2017-01-22 18:09:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BodhiThoms You lack a backbone, fool. Real men defend the lives of the unborn.  @part_timepundit

823229035237019651 2017-01-22 18:01:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Trent_tWg My tweet was not pro anyone or anything but common sense. I didn't vote for either nominee. @SalenaZito
823223450181439489 2017-01-22 17:38:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @SaintRPh Tomi Lahren is available for one.
823222686944006147 2017-01-22 17:35:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @SaintRPh I don't talk to fake news sources.
823222226988232704 2017-01-22 17:34:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> For the record, vagina costumes and p***y hats aren't cool or edgy. They're disgusting. You look dumb (and very single) wearing them.
823217394344718338 2017-01-22 17:14:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @dominiquemelted I voted for neither nominee. I hold politicians accountable regardless of political party. @joannesmoot
823216753186631682 2017-01-22 17:12:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm uninterested in smashing the patriarchy. The future isn't female, as some say. It's male AND female. That's true equality.
823215868402343936 2017-01-22 17:08:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ScotsFyre Aww. One of those. @alacosta12

823209985479950336 2017-01-22 16:45:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The comparison of crowd sizes, marches or otherwise, matters not. Popularity is never the litmus test for morality. Shocking, I know.
823187122177896448 2017-01-22 15:14:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I don't have to join a largely pro-abort march to proclaim that our president - like all presidents - should and will be held accountable.https://twitter.com/joannesmoot/status/823186363428327424
823172591246516224 2017-01-22 14:16:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Good morning!  American women woke up today with all the rights that American men have, too. Like always.

822985388876763137 2017-01-21 01:53:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @marthabwisa69 Trump is still president tomorrow morning. Nothing has changed. ;)
822983129044570118 2017-01-21 01:44:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Life of mother issue? Not common. Being pro-abort for rape/incest? You're not really pro-life. They should not die for another's crime.https://twitter.com/JackieJackielg/status/822982277181411328
822981112976785409 2017-01-21 01:36:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Great. They're not truly pro-woman unless they defend the unborn ones in the womb. But way to rationalize! https://twitter.com/JackieJackielg/status/822978174481035264
822977333569187840 2017-01-21 01:21:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You just want a sammich.

822956748839456768 2017-01-21 23:59:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's all fun and games at the Mexican restaurant until you accidentally drip queso on your hair. #longhairproblems
822926404035768321 2017-01-21 21:58:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If women from today's #WomensMarch had marched in front of Hillary's house demanding she go to WI & MI, they prob wouldn't need to march.
822925581813776386 2017-01-21 21:55:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Just one of the many reasons to follow Stephen. Tweets like this. What a gem.https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/822900278525624320

822889980653686785 2017-01-21 19:33:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You spelled "males" incorrectly. And no, mutilating their body doesn't make them a female.https://twitter.com/broadly/status/822863493426712576
822886349720223747 2017-01-21 19:19:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @tjdraperpro I believe it goes against everything libertarians claim to stand for.
822884613924196352 2017-01-21 19:12:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Human rights - for both male and female - begin in the womb. #WomensMarch
822884042832039939 2017-01-21 19:10:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm uninterested in spending much time engaging Libertarians who want "freedom" for women but are ok with denying life to unborn.
822883672793747456 2017-01-21 19:08:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @pacelattin Truth with love. Don't be so cowardly.
822883484175859712 2017-01-21 19:08:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TXoilCons @quiverskeep Heh. No, it's not. It's not taking a stand. At all.
822883224955273216 2017-01-21 19:07:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @quiverskeep @TXoilCons Not at all. It's entirely cowardly on their part, and I'll tell them that.
822883048077332481 2017-01-21 19:06:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @pacelattin I call it like I see it, especially those who proclaim freedom but don't ACTIVELY fight for it for the weakest among us.
822882828518039554 2017-01-21 19:05:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @pacelattin You're welcome. Have a good one!
822882585009356800 2017-01-21 19:04:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TXoilCons @quiverskeep No excuses. They need to be vocal. Tough love.
822882412367593472 2017-01-21 19:03:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @pacelattin Sorry, is coward better? If you can't be vocal about unborn life, you are one. Tough truth.
822882240342409217 2017-01-21 19:03:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @libertytrout @pacelattin You try to take the moral high ground, but it's a black and white issue. Perhaps grow up? ;)
822881872879435776 2017-01-21 19:01:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @pacelattin You're a fool if you can't be vocal about defending the right to life for the unborn. A fool.
822881612752883712 2017-01-21 19:00:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The perfect definition of Libertarians who won't be vocal about defending the unborn...https://twitter.com/TXoilCons/status/822881136506470401
822878564735418368 2017-01-21 18:48:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @libertytrout Don't tell @pacelattin. He's thinks he's pro-freedom.
822877997912952832 2017-01-21 18:46:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Did I say that? Nope. But please, go be brave, holy libertarian.https://twitter.com/pacelattin/status/822875723035643904
822877246738354176 2017-01-21 18:43:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Not vocally pro-life libertarians aren't brave, but sure act quite proud of themselves. Heh. They're like liberals.
822875111309082624 2017-01-21 18:34:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Too often libertarians refuse to be vocal about unborn life. It's cowardly. But please, act brave and pro-freedom! Lol.https://twitter.com/pacelattin/status/822872376903798784

822832945287274498 2017-01-21 15:47:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @KFoleyFL We shouldn't applaud people when they meet basic requirements of civility.

822832275998015488 2017-01-21 15:44:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @KFoleyFL A main part of their platform is pro-abort. They don't allow for differing opinions.
822826574542204928 2017-01-21 15:21:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Of course !

822824456368361472 2017-01-21 15:13:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @LinPaige To deliver the mother from complications you deliver the child, not abort it. Enjoy this: http://www.nrlc.org/archive/abortion/pba/HowOftenAbortionNecessarySaveMother.pdf
822823610456899584 2017-01-21 15:10:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @LinPaige Life of the mother argument is a smokescreen. It's not even close to common. Read up, hon.

822818858255994880 2017-01-21 14:51:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No, their platform is pro-abort. That's neither my belief, nor truly pro-woman. But knock yourself out with your "bravery."https://twitter.com/sadieannerue/status/822818271435034625

822814894185709570 2017-01-21 14:35:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @FMSD14 I always do. :)
822814750774087683 2017-01-21 14:34:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's not only fun making the pro-abort chicks mad today, but their spineless male cheerleaders will yell at you, too. Hilarious. 
822813821911891968 2017-01-21 14:31:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> These boys are upset I'm not a liberal, pro-abort harpy. Aww.https://twitter.com/Wronkle/status/822813349331120128
822813570555592705 2017-01-21 14:30:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @bbnfan89 Yes, it's murder. It's discrimination against the unborn based on location and stage of development. @Just_a_Texan

820851767869112321 2017-01-15 04:34:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BrianGriffiths @pipandbaby @Gormogons No complaints, or I'm walking.

820815163179679749 2017-01-15 02:09:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @heyyitsbev_ Haha. I want a t-shirt with that hashtag. 
820812831398436864 2017-01-15 02:00:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @heyyitsbev_ Thank you. Ditto. Actual, substantial dialogue is much more interesting and worthwhile.
820811975374569473 2017-01-15 01:56:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @aggierican @MartiniShark For scary Cage pics?
820811416093519873 2017-01-15 01:54:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @heyyitsbev_ No, not at all. I enjoy it, too. Much preferable to responding to the loads of mentions ridiculing my looks, etc.
820809944240979968 2017-01-15 01:48:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @heyyitsbev_ I think this is another "agree to disagree." 
820809585992892417 2017-01-15 01:47:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @heyyitsbev_ You can assume "all", but I never said it. The obsession and adoration of him as some savior has been more than apparent.
820808073812000768 2017-01-15 01:41:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @heyyitsbev_ The cult-like love within the Trump camp is quite apparent, hence my comment. I never said "all."

820777601396592640 2017-01-15 23:40:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @heyyitsbev_ I've explained it to you. We have different perspectives.

819351146917720064 2017-01-11 01:11:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DanishDELUX You're very, very misguided on this issue. I hope you reconsider the reality of it all.
819351027547799552 2017-01-11 01:11:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DanishDELUX No, it is a black and white issue. Sometimes pregnancy is the result of rape. God is not surprised. Don't limit his grace.
819350256873861120 2017-01-11 01:08:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @azureskyr1 @DanishDELUX No, I'm saying life begins at conception and God is the author of life. Rape babies are not trash.
819350067576471552 2017-01-11 01:07:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I hope I am continually a thorn in the side of the pro-abort movement. #goals
819349517577363456 2017-01-11 01:05:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @azureskyr1 @DanishDELUX If you think God is in any way pro-abort, you read a different Bible than I do...
819349456596385793 2017-01-11 01:05:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @azureskyr1 @DanishDELUX This happened. The result is both mother and child are whole. THAT is God's grace.http://www.lifenews.com/2014/08/11/pregnant-after-rape-what-this-teen-did-may-shock-you/
819349278405574657 2017-01-11 01:04:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @azureskyr1 @DanishDELUX Wow. Very misguided, to say the least.
819347059929219072 2017-01-11 00:55:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DanishDELUX Being pro-abort in cases of rape is not being truly pro-life. Just FYI.
819346498299318272 2017-01-11 00:53:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Cromulentness It's a privilege to speak for those who have been silenced.
819346388718743552 2017-01-11 00:52:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DanishDELUX The choice in that scenario is to not kill the unborn life. Is it easy? No, but it is the right thing to do.
819346046006468608 2017-01-11 00:51:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Then we hold similar views of one another.
819345779856916480 2017-01-11 00:50:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm the kind of person who doesn't think a life conceived in rape should be killed for existing. https://twitter.com/73UMP2016/status/819345393096028160
819345329011224576 2017-01-11 00:48:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If this is your view, then you're not truly pro-life. You need to reconsider. http://www.lifenews.com/2014/08/11/pregnant-after-rape-what-this-teen-did-may-shock-you/
819344257135890432 2017-01-11 00:44:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @twzig I love this. :)
819343911848181760 2017-01-11 00:43:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> That's a terrible position to have. Babies conceived in rape do not deserve to be punished for another's crime.
819343077534027776 2017-01-11 00:39:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No, again, you're wrong. Life begins at conception. Uncomfortable fact for a fool like you, but it's true. https://twitter.com/AliciaMHendley/status/819342926870417408
819342910609129472 2017-01-11 00:39:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> So you're of the opinion that it's magic vagina dust which bestows personhood? Wow. How old are you? https://twitter.com/AliciaMHendley/status/819342602969419776
819342681461682181 2017-01-11 00:38:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Like this teen who was raped & had the baby? Both woman and child can be healthy and whole. Why are you against that?http://www.lifenews.com/2014/08/11/pregnant-after-rape-what-this-teen-did-may-shock-you/ https://twitter.com/AliciaMHendley/status/819342057181478912
819341991897133057 2017-01-11 00:35:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Not at all, but you are against unborn males and females. Stop discriminating. https://twitter.com/AliciaMHendley/status/819341520939655169
819341019951099905 2017-01-11 00:31:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The crime of rape is the rapist's fault, not the child's. https://twitter.com/AliciaMHendley/status/819340694242394113
819340269854265344 2017-01-11 00:28:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> There's nothing more pro-woman than choosing to protect children, both born and unborn.
819339725609857024 2017-01-11 00:26:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No one "needs" an abortion. I feel sad for you and your daughter. Hopefully she'll value life more than her mother. https://twitter.com/AliciaMHendley/status/819339023080714242

819316085468053506 2017-01-11 22:52:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> In the world of @BuzzFeed, when you publish unsubstantiated reports, anyone calling you out is being "divisive".https://twitter.com/oliverdarcy/status/819260893557116929

819292140324929541 2017-01-11 21:17:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> So because I'm snarky, you refuse to help sex trafficking victims? Sounds like you have bigger issues than not liking my tweets. ;) https://twitter.com/harper1_jn/status/819291773742653440

819215292165476353 2017-01-11 16:12:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Really, more surprising than @BuzzFeed's super secret dossier would have been Trump reacting to it with calm and using lowercase.

818510170972102656 2017-01-09 17:30:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lordthx1139 Jim. Trump was the GOP nominee. I didn't say he was a conservative, I said he has an (R) next to his name. That's true.
818509140297449473 2017-01-09 17:26:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lordthx1139 Weird. I thought he was the (R) candidate on the Nov 8 ballot.

817180810059153409 2017-01-05 01:27:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Women's healthcare clinics greatly outnumber PP, offer affordable services including screenings AND don't vacuum out wombs in the next room.https://twitter.com/BufferingJuffy/status/817173539933589504

817162334623907841 2017-01-05 00:14:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> When that business involves the murder of another life, is it my duty to speak up. Get comfortable, because I'm not stopping.https://twitter.com/ofonemind5585/status/817161997938819077
817158928895197185 2017-01-05 00:00:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> #PlannedParenthood clinics perform over 320,000 abortions per year (according to their annual report). That. Is. Not. Health. Care.

817097266234294272 2017-01-05 19:55:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Racism is real. It comes from all sides. The young man in Chicago was not a victim of "reverse" racism. Just racism. Period.

817035857626533889 2017-01-05 15:51:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The mindset that says it's OK to harm others (in general and) for their different opinions should be condemned by everyone.
817024033950748673 2017-01-05 15:04:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I hope that account isn't a legitimate one, but you CAN argue that "love is love" has opened the door to a dangerous path of acceptance.
817022093795741696 2017-01-05 14:57:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This is an offshoot of "love is love." Sick people like Charles who promote sexual abuse of minors. THIS IS NOT OK. https://twitter.com/SirCharlesD1953/status/816528900532609024

816848013402447872 2017-01-04 03:25:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This is essentially a full-fledged endorsement from Jesse. I knew it was just a matter of time. https://twitter.com/JesseKellyDC/status/816845684477480960
816844411892092928 2017-01-04 03:10:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @davetv28 It looks like you prefer to hand off the "uncomfortable" issues to others. That's pretty weak.
816841407684050944 2017-01-04 02:59:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm never apologizing for my pro-life views, even to confused "conservatives" who are rather bored by the subject.
816840872348291072 2017-01-04 02:56:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The sanctity of life is part of the foundation of conservatism. If it doesn't mean that much to you, you need to reevaluate.https://twitter.com/davetv28/status/816839390613868544
816840598221156352 2017-01-04 02:55:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Amazingly enough, I can/do defend the unborn & promote the sancity of life alongside other issues. Apparently you can't.https://twitter.com/davetv28/status/816839390613868544
816838344177020928 2017-01-04 02:46:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Is the issue of defending & speaking up for the unborn too much of a bother or something?https://twitter.com/davetv28/status/816837060992626688
816808798581092353 2017-01-04 00:49:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> All of us should be greatly bothered by abortion. If you aren't, your worldview is skewed and/or you haven't grown up yet...https://twitter.com/PeculiarBaptist/status/816807575156965376
816807105596362752 2017-01-04 00:42:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It wasn't particularly notable. Liberals blasted Lena for remarks, too. Tomi admits abortion isn't a big issue to her. That's unfortunate.https://twitter.com/PeculiarBaptist/status/816775096387764225

815189046137856000 2016-12-31 13:33:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The President-elect makes a fool of himself (again...and again) when he communicates like this. It isn't "telling it like it is."https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/815185071317676033
815039668597231616 2016-12-30 03:39:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Oddly enough, I'm blocked. Weird. @PicardTips

814525116814098432 2016-12-29 17:34:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Transgenderism is a delusion. It is based on emotion, not fact. I will not support it. https://twitter.com/shoeslova/status/814524838350127108

814352463914565632 2016-12-28 06:08:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You're too kind. I'm just a work in progress.

814340762385154048 2016-12-28 05:22:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The parents who prop up and encourage this behavior - transgenderism - are the main problem. Stop abusing your kids.https://twitter.com/UPROXX/status/814231968602869760

813372964666298370 2016-12-26 13:16:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> To deliver the mother from pregnancy complications in the last trimester, you deliver the child, you don't abort it. What a fool you are. https://twitter.com/VABVOX/status/813368748316954624

810898838743613440 2016-12-19 17:25:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @dens1984 Transgenderism is nothing to be celebrated or rationalized, esp not by so-called conservatives. It is a delusion. @NRO
810898443875024896 2016-12-19 17:23:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @dens1984 @Ceecee_Wx You avoid them? Why? Hiding from things isn't exactly the right approach.
810897612975067137 2016-12-19 17:20:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @dens1984 See where I used the word "rationalization"? Yeah, that.

810861646633648128 2016-12-19 14:57:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If you look to politicians, elections, or electors to save you and make your life amazing, you're going to be disappointed.

809989484880261120 2016-12-16 05:11:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> In conclusion, I have no clue what I did to upset Cheri to where she suddenly declares that I'm not a Christian. Sad to see her reaction.
809987263488806912 2016-12-16 05:03:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @molratty @Farmhand82 I have no clue exactly why she's reacting this way to me. I've always appreciated and liked Cheri.
809986543662362625 2016-12-16 05:00:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @winningatmylife Thanks! And I agree. @CheriJacobus
809986407624306692 2016-12-16 04:59:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @APLMom No clue. I thought much better of Cheri. @CheriJacobus @hardpec
809986234034585600 2016-12-16 04:59:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You've also since declared that the Church of Cheri believes I'm not a Christian. You also said you were done for the night. Douse yourself. https://twitter.com/CheriJacobus/status/809985461439647744
809985847500095488 2016-12-16 04:57:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I specifically referred to liberal hatred of Kellyanne, which they do. I'm sorry that you dislike my comment and feel so wounded by it. https://twitter.com/CheriJacobus/status/809985461439647744
809985018282053632 2016-12-16 04:54:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Not even close. You didn't know what I was even referring to, then somewhere along the line declared I'm not a Christian. Pretty childish. https://twitter.com/CheriJacobus/status/809984804301271040

809981542982361088 2016-12-16 04:40:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Good. Then have a great night and don't assume other people aren't Christians because of *their* opinions. You're old enough to know better. https://twitter.com/CheriJacobus/status/809981263562022913
809981010704236544 2016-12-16 04:38:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm sorry you had a bad day, apparently. Your reactions to my tweets have been kind of embarrassing for you. https://twitter.com/CheriJacobus/status/809980711843328000
809980633128861696 2016-12-16 04:36:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Well it appears you're just getting started on deciding who the Christians are, so I'll follow your lead. How about that? https://twitter.com/CheriJacobus/status/809980361195266048

809978891477598208 2016-12-16 04:29:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CheriJacobus I have always been #NeverTrump. I was simply commenting on the background of "cats judging Kellyanne". Period.
809978674518884353 2016-12-16 04:28:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CheriJacobus Cheri, I'm not even talking about her politics! I am not talking about those on the Right at all. Don't assume, please.
809978417999396864 2016-12-16 04:27:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Ooh, testy people out there tonight. It's not like I said something *really* horrible like I hate Star Wars or something.
809978104584269824 2016-12-16 04:26:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TheRoadbeer @Dlstoke You don't even know what I'm referring to. Just move on then.
809977779735449601 2016-12-16 04:25:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @neontaster What did I do wrong? You joining the crowd, too?
809977656301277184 2016-12-16 04:24:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CheriJacobus Heh. You don't know what I'm even referring to. I don't like Trump, but I can point out when either side is wrong. Try it.
809977293984727041 2016-12-16 04:23:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I didn't vote for Trump and still wouldn't, but I can point out when either side acts incorrectly.   If you can't, that's a problem.
809977080599445504 2016-12-16 04:22:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Wow. I view actual hatred from the Left toward someone (who happens to work for Trump) comment on it, and somehow I'm wrong?
809976799996284928 2016-12-16 04:21:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CheriJacobus Um, ok, Cheri. Is there something wrong with using that after seeing proof on here?
809975890566385665 2016-12-16 04:17:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The Left's utter hatred for Kellyanne Conway is something to behold. To them, being a successful woman only counts if you're a liberal.

809602160795193344 2016-12-15 03:32:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Denying personhood to the unborn is another convenient way for pro-aborts to excuse the inherent worth of each new life.

809491687986733056 2016-12-15 20:13:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rightlydivide Well of course.

809480517154439169 2016-12-15 19:29:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray They are not appointed without God's knowledge. It's not a surprise to him.
809480109136769025 2016-12-15 19:27:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Yes
809479529160986625 2016-12-15 19:25:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I mean, we could get really crazy and talk about how all those in power around the world were not appointed without God's knowledge. Etc.
809478439887634432 2016-12-15 19:21:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I wonder how those who believe Trump is a savior sent by God feel about Obama's placement? That was God's will, too.
809437558405001216 2016-12-15 16:38:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If you get too close to Trump you'll start tweeting like him, apparently.https://twitter.com/GovMikeHuckabee/status/809422360633868288
809435499848933376 2016-12-15 16:30:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket Just...no.
809433505025425408 2016-12-15 16:22:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @maxwellarm It matches your lack of taste in general, though.
809272981620985856 2016-12-14 05:44:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CalebHowe @TheRoadbeer And also, just because you were on The West Wing doesn't mean I should listen to you.

809260645845700609 2016-12-14 04:55:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @countermoonbat But is it about war?!
809210861579620352 2016-12-14 01:37:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @COgrandmom77 Of course they are, but I disagree with them.

809176867236364288 2016-12-14 23:22:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Why should a physician postpone efforts to save the mother to take time out in order to kill the child?https://twitter.com/AdaptGamer/status/809176272924508168

809167883758665732 2016-12-14 22:47:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JRRCollins "Choice" is their god, and abortion is a sacrament.

809120774275682304 2016-12-14 19:39:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @karltervo Yes. It can be undone, so Trump must do that.
809120672425320448 2016-12-14 19:39:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @LifeNewsHQ @MsD_408 Trump and the Republican Congress will have absolutely no excuse. They must get things done.
809105726870355969 2016-12-14 18:40:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @progged Actually, there is a lot of the other, too. Plenty bothered that stores & neighbors don't say it. But no one is required.

808847990395965440 2016-12-13 01:36:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lyndseyfifield You're missing my point, but that's ok.
808805212441952257 2016-12-13 22:46:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lyndseyfifield Actually, the 20 week abortion ban was signed. That's something. Sorry I think we should've made a bigger statement, too.
808804807121260544 2016-12-13 22:44:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lyndseyfifield So you only play to win, not because it's the right thing to do and you might lose? Huh. Weird. Not how I view things.

808796950728503296 2016-12-13 22:13:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lyndseyfifield Clearly, I disagree.

808796440935931906 2016-12-13 22:11:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Glad the 20 week ban was signed. Not surprised by the veto. Pro-life bravery isn't big among too many Republican politicians.https://twitter.com/cnnbrk/status/808794529843314688

807950752257896448 2016-12-11 14:10:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The problem with your tweet is the things you listed are opinions Americans have had since well before the 2016 election. https://twitter.com/peterdaou/status/807949806635220997
807947945240915968 2016-12-11 13:59:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's alright. We've already taken a screenshot of your inane tweet. You can delete it now. https://twitter.com/peterdaou/status/807947632513585154
807947087233056768 2016-12-11 13:56:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Doesn't matter. Your tweet concludes Americans have no reason to view her as unlikable/corrupt on their own. It's entirely laughable. https://twitter.com/peterdaou/status/807945410774003712
807940903511920640 2016-12-11 13:31:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> She achieved these things on her own, Pete. Don't be sexist. Give the woman credit. https://twitter.com/peterdaou/status/807662956460773376
807748933778817024 2016-12-10 00:48:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @nancrews Hahaha
807748840686239744 2016-12-10 00:48:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @trailduster6bt It's pretty much my favorite thing to do, though.
807746356098068480 2016-12-10 00:38:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @trailduster6bt He means on his Facebook page.
807743757139451905 2016-12-10 00:28:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @soyouknowwme He's too busy saving Christmas at Starbucks. @TheEvangelist
807739912036487168 2016-12-10 00:12:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JacobPerry Yeah @TheEvangelist
807739328902418432 2016-12-10 00:10:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Apparently, the "classy" @TheEvangelist didn't like my latest post at Rare where I mentioned him and his obsession with Starbucks' cups.pic.twitter.com/LcXIB4uRTQ

807656058323922944 2016-12-10 18:39:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @walakewon So true.
807581276089761793 2016-12-10 13:42:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ProfRayKinsella Exactly!

807312445274488832 2016-12-09 19:54:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @kelly_terence Whatever makes you feel better, I guess. Heh.
807309979921293312 2016-12-09 19:44:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The innocent unborn are murdered. It is my duty to call it out and be a voice for those who were discarded. Get used to it.https://twitter.com/Summersethomes/status/807309238079025156

807291274059456512 2016-12-09 18:30:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rlg100619 Well, @FilipposRempout doesn't think so, but he also thinks Roe v. Wade is a good law, so...
807276470456504320 2016-12-09 17:31:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JesseKellyDC Shut up
807275800324141056 2016-12-09 17:28:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This. Right. Here.https://twitter.com/BenHowe/status/806937579912359936
807274736459927552 2016-12-09 17:24:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JesseKellyDC I don't know how to feel about this. I agree with you.
807263912366403584 2016-12-09 16:41:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You don't believe we should speak so strongly against abortion. You ARE a fool.https://twitter.com/FilipposRempout/status/807262968488587265
807262312159510528 2016-12-09 16:35:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Life and death IS a black and white issue. Don't be a fool.https://twitter.com/FilipposRempout/status/807261835883925504
807260402312744960 2016-12-09 16:27:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Those things are readily available in the U.S.
807257893858906112 2016-12-09 16:17:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No, you always speak the truth about abortion. Help when you can, but never water down the truth. Period.
807255686946127872 2016-12-09 16:08:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The innocent unborn are killed because of "choice". That requires strong language. I'm not apologizing.https://twitter.com/FilipposRempout/status/807254893832663040
807254209322172416 2016-12-09 16:02:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And no, I'm not going to be silent and give the abortion industry a moment's rest when 3,000+ lives are taken daily. No time for cowardice.https://twitter.com/FilipposRempout/status/807252534695960577
807253977662390276 2016-12-09 16:02:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You're absolutely wrong and have clearly not been paying attention.

806930518579310592 2016-12-08 18:36:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @irootsorg Yes, but that's not widely known, apparently. And some refuse to say MC because of "Christ".

806530755774058496 2016-12-07 16:08:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Vilestyle @Maddoux1 The thing is Trump said he was a conservative. He and his followers, like @VileStyle, clearly are not.
806526533502377985 2016-12-07 15:51:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Vilestyle @DMiddletonCbus They'll never admit that, though. Trump's a fighter!!! #lol @VileStyle @Ericb1980
806525798626758656 2016-12-07 15:48:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Guys, Trump's changing tune is apparently called "negotiation", not selling out. https://twitter.com/VileStyle/status/806524367785979905
806522846818304000 2016-12-07 15:36:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Ericb1980 @Vilestyle Compared to his rhetoric on the campaign trail? Absolutely selling out, according to Trumpers.

806490088586772480 2016-12-07 13:26:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump is #PersonOfTheYear, so many remind us Hitler was, too. If Hillary had been named, they'd remind us of the Pope Francis' win. Lulz.
806353908524269568 2016-12-06 04:25:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @neontaster I do both, actually.

806166004606894080 2016-12-06 15:58:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Like the electoral college, "fake news" is only a problem after the election. Because Hillary lost.

804420355922104320 2016-12-01 20:22:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Pre-ACA, many birth control options were already affordable. There are always generic options available, too. Etc.https://twitter.com/SkeddyRuxypin/status/804409777157586944

804405291584540673 2016-12-01 19:22:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Birth control is widely available in many different forms, including inexpensive ones. The "lack of access" argument doesn't check out.https://twitter.com/SkeddyRuxypin/status/804402541517623297

804373585582313472 2016-12-01 17:16:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> That others may hold differing opinions is one of the most difficult things for the Left to accept. But they're the tolerant ones.

802482689823698944 2016-11-26 12:02:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes, "demonizing" Castro was the real tragedy. #lawdhttps://twitter.com/BostonGlobe/status/802477297722867712

802332424965423104 2016-11-25 02:05:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Politics has been brought up more than once with family these last few days. And everyone admits that I'm right.
802230693807947776 2016-11-25 19:21:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Zero apologies for standing on principle.   ZERO.
802230207960772609 2016-11-25 19:19:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Romney shouldn't apologize to the Trump camp for a thing. If an apology is required to get a position in administration, he should decline.
802155710486298624 2016-11-25 14:23:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TheBrandonMorse Well, you also eat cranberry out of a can.
802150126269636608 2016-11-25 14:01:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Then: "Trump must accept the election results!" Now: "We don't accept the election results!"https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/802142698937479168

801785539557031936 2016-11-24 13:52:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!!   Side note: not yet 8 a.m., and we've already discussed politics some. No safe spaces here.
801659594938392576 2016-11-23 05:31:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JayCaruso This is like the one thing aside from politics that we agree on.

801583566446587904 2016-11-23 00:29:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> More than ever, the Left is concerned about what America discusses at Thanksgiving. Maybe because they lost spectacularly on election day.
801570419987935232 2016-11-23 23:37:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> They already know most women go elsewhere for real health care & that you kill 330,000+ unborn lives per year.   But I'll tell them again.https://twitter.com/ppmn/status/801489606499856384

801470516062208001 2016-11-23 17:00:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's like...their words mean nothing.

801260146928259072 2016-11-22 03:04:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's what Trump does, and it shouldn't surprise anyone. We've known who he is all along.https://twitter.com/DineshDSouza/status/801195537374597120

801216633289240576 2016-11-22 00:11:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Again, Left. You're shocked Trump won? Look at the seething hatred you exude.https://twitter.com/Salon/status/801209911124185088

801178670802968576 2016-11-22 21:40:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Still mad and talking about the "unfairness" of the electoral college, I see. Heh.

801130974214029312 2016-11-22 18:31:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Are you sure? Because Ben knows he lacks government office experience and isn't sure he's best for a job like that...https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/801124010817978368

801069809924501504 2016-11-22 14:28:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's almost like Trump made campaign promises to gain support, then is backing away from them. It's like he's a politician!
801058589985140736 2016-11-22 13:43:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Well, friends don't do things like that to other friends.https://twitter.com/cnnbrk/status/801054513134178304

800831241901608960 2016-11-21 22:40:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Again, you can and should condemn behavior from the alt-right and alt-left. Neither should be given an excuse.

800130157403144192 2016-11-19 00:14:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> So true. But when you call out one side, someone thinks you're on the other. So I'm just in the middle shrugging my shoulders.

800026717519745024 2016-11-19 17:23:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> A great thing about America is that I don't care whether or not you see "Hamilton" or shop at places like Target. I really don't.

797665269468528640 2016-11-12 04:59:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @tal0781 Charles, Heather was talking to you and proving my point. Haha. @hboulware
797662507611594752 2016-11-12 04:48:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ChrisHarrelson I do. Doesn't mean they're not just because you don't see it. ;) @edkrayewski
797659644806172672 2016-11-12 04:37:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ChrisHarrelson For what he will do. Is it that difficult to understand the concept? @edkrayewski
797649648936742913 2016-11-12 03:57:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Saying Trump doesn't need to prove himself is like hiring someone because they gave a fun interview, then not caring about job performance.

797645778579755008 2016-11-12 03:42:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Those people on the Right who don't feel the need to hold Trump accountable just because he won are acting just like the Left.
797645278505529344 2016-11-12 03:40:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes, it is. I'm not the president. It's up to Trump to be an effective leader...sweetie.https://twitter.com/tal0781/status/797631026600247296

797559730457739264 2016-11-12 22:00:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The decline of our society can be directly related to the fact that too many people don't take their carts back to the cart corral.
797547406988607488 2016-11-12 21:11:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes. I totally hate him. That's why I've said I hope he proves me wrong and is actually a strong conservative leader.https://twitter.com/SundevilSal/status/797546085673791489
797545118504984576 2016-11-12 21:02:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If you don't recognize that the real test begins once he takes office, then you're blinded by the cult of personality.https://twitter.com/SundevilSal/status/797538963569385473

797482730460168192 2016-11-12 16:54:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Also, unsurprising.
797476277003370497 2016-11-12 16:28:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TheChrisSuprun Oh, I've seen it here, too, but Facebook is just now starting to talk about it, at least in my corner.
797475843589160962 2016-11-12 16:27:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Apparently, over on Facebook, post-election conversation is now heading in to how bad the electoral college happens to be. Hilarious.
797278300628520960 2016-11-11 03:22:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Those in #NeverTrump aren't the ones who have to prove themselves. The one who does? Donald Trump. Prove us wrong.
797277629036560384 2016-11-11 03:19:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I keep seeing "get in line" or "assimilate" directed at those who are #NeverTrump.   Short answer? No.
797259200950898688 2016-11-11 02:06:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TahootyHoot I didn't vote for Trump, but it's amusing that the side promoting wearing safety pins will riot when they don't get their way.
797257362901962752 2016-11-11 01:59:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It shouldn't be so difficult to call out the bad no matter which side is perpetrating it. Oh, but narrative. And agenda. Silly me.
797256754916638720 2016-11-11 01:56:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RedState @TahootyHoot I suppose the traffic blocking, arson, and property damage don't bother you, either? How very open-minded.
797256541841883136 2016-11-11 01:55:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RedState @TahootyHoot And yes, if someone wears a safety pin because they feel Trump is going to kick out all the gays, they're a fool.
797256355488952322 2016-11-11 01:55:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RedState @TahootyHoot Do you not have a problem with it because it's a pro-Trump guy they're beating up? Hmm.
797255724581654529 2016-11-11 01:52:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TahootyHoot Were these guys who don't like Trump wearing safety pins when they beat up this pro-Trump man?http://www.redstate.com/jimjamitis/2016/11/10/video-chicago-mob-beats-man-suspected-voting-trump/
797251185052938240 2016-11-11 01:34:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I did not vote for Trump, but rioting, safety pinning & Lena Dunham-type behavior reinforces that the Left is obsessed with hysteria.

796384290280009728 2016-11-09 16:09:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TeddWebb1 @KatyinIndy #NeverTrump hasn't gone anywhere.
796383118513029120 2016-11-09 16:05:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hillary/her supporters are right. Sexism played a part this election...but it's the kind that said she should win *because* she's a female.
796373536835256321 2016-11-09 15:27:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Happy birthday to @rottencoreblog!

796326716394315776 2016-11-09 12:20:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This also won't ever change: "Put not your trust in princes..." 6/6

796325827503910912 2016-11-09 12:17:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> However, right now, Trump's win was a huge blow against conservatism and basic decency. 3/
796325446182965248 2016-11-09 12:15:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I truly, truly hope I'm wrong about what a Trump administration entails. The country and its people deserve much better than they've had. 2/
796325100941443072 2016-11-09 12:14:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Unlike Hillary, I can come out and say congratulations to President-elect Trump and the #MAGA crowd. 1/

795602806656954368 2016-11-07 12:24:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Born2BeAmerican His point is Trump isn't an ambassador for the gospel, so it doesn't apply. @jcampbell46549 @laurakfillault @mitchellvii
795602384626085888 2016-11-07 12:22:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @jcampbell46549 ...and some people wondered why I wrote a piece called "Jesus Is Not On Tuesday's Ballot".
795483914626334720 2016-11-06 04:31:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Unfortunately, that thinking and behavior will still be around after Tuesday.

795469362064924672 2016-11-06 03:34:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Plate0fShrimp I'm not voting for either major party candidate, so I sleep well.

791489706286456832 2016-10-26 04:00:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Goodnight, all. Here's a lovely piece to end the evening. https://youtu.be/dKCh1HPwVxw

791461976710971393 2016-10-26 02:10:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> "Pro-choice" Republican? Heh. Not the same as a conservative. And respect for and defense of unborn life is where everything begins.https://twitter.com/pskinny00/status/791461286269812736

791458533078433797 2016-10-26 01:56:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @sarahmquinlan I know :)
791456570651582464 2016-10-26 01:48:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> My thanks to @TomiLahren and #TeamTomi for getting my piece about her spineless "conservatism" trending again. Much appreciated, T.
791448385974919168 2016-10-26 01:16:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> To Trump and Tomi? Nope.https://twitter.com/WakeBroad/status/791448127156817920

791443686903181312 2016-10-26 00:57:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'll happily call out those who are weak on conservatism, especially regarding unborn life. Gladly, without reservation. Always.

791440990569725953 2016-10-26 00:46:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @hoosierchicago Glad you figured that out.
791440700235710465 2016-10-26 00:45:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes, you must be pro-life to be conservative. Tomi isn't one. https://twitter.com/maxell9544/status/791440432441860097

791369630371676160 2016-10-26 20:03:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @brandy_gibs Superficiality is how she got her second political talk show at age 24, so yes, I'll bring it up. Because it's a problem.
791355435257327616 2016-10-26 19:06:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I guess I missed the part of the orientation that said you must be best friends with or cheer on anyone with an (R) next to their name.
791355046051078144 2016-10-26 19:05:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No. When someone masquerades as a conservative and is not one, we'll call it out, thanks.https://twitter.com/MerlePearl/status/791354493967343616

791346033943019524 2016-10-26 18:29:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The "we can't call out the GOP nominee" idea has to end. Why can't we? Don't you want to hold him accountable? Don't act like the liberals.

791304449281159168 2016-10-26 15:44:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Exactly. It must be addressed head-on, not pushed aside because it's uncomfortable or not "important".https://twitter.com/Patriot_Musket/status/791303217518747648

790980661955989504 2016-10-25 18:17:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MattPalumbo12 I believe being "moderate" on the issue of life is completely unacceptable, and shows one is not truly pro-life.
790979351198203904 2016-10-25 18:12:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MattPalumbo12 Her support of Trump is telling, too. And my piece is about her embarrassing, shallow brand of conservatism.
790968529835163648 2016-10-25 17:29:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> People on the Left have said I'm sexist, and today, some supporting Trump say I am. But let's face it, they're the same side.

790743194912841728 2016-10-24 02:34:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It was especially torturous for us. Yes, very gimmicky. @verge
790742998837563392 2016-10-24 02:33:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TylerBoliver It bothered me more than Game of Thrones (I've not seen every episode of, but enough). Maybe because I'm more invested in it.
790741845747851264 2016-10-24 02:28:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BenHowe @TylerBoliver Yes, I *know* it's graphic. I think it went too far for the show. I didn't read the comic and won't. Etc, etc.
790741426913017856 2016-10-24 02:27:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ThePeoplesBacon Because I'm quitting the show, kid. I'm not interested in the comic. Not that difficult a concept.
790741047785783296 2016-10-24 02:25:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BenHowe @TylerBoliver I knew people would die. I knew Lucille/Negan would kill them. I think they went too far with showing it all, though.
790740846094286848 2016-10-24 02:24:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> They did. They really, really did. And I've been a fan since the beginning. @verge

790544655268114432 2016-10-24 13:25:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lrc328 That was rough. And over-the-top, in my opinion. I think they could have followed the storyline without showing all the brutality.

790274632721072128 2016-10-23 19:32:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JimmyPrinceton Now let's see a white conservative guy say that Hillary is unlikable. We'll wait for the backlash.
790234736904069122 2016-10-23 16:53:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lrc328 Oh, man. :( We already went through the "Glen is dead" mourning last season, too.
790233929177522180 2016-10-23 16:50:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Shocking facts: Trump does not represent all men in the same way Hillary does not represent all women.   Thank goodness.

789098677155532800 2016-10-20 13:39:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Last night, Hillary referred to late-term abortions as heartbreaking, but how can that be if unborn are just considered a mass of tissue?
788938161607020548 2016-10-19 03:01:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You certainly aren't required to vote for either major presidential candidate, and it doesn't mean you can't comment on the election. #fyi

788874764228124672 2016-10-19 22:49:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> A beautiful respite in the midst of chaos.
788874352003575808 2016-10-19 22:47:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Dealing with the Trumpism mindset after the election will be an exhausting task. It's not going to go away when he loses, unfortunately.

788505270074875904 2016-10-18 22:21:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Also...  assaulting someone is still wrong even if you don't think she's a 10. Just FYI.

788493965255446528 2016-10-18 21:36:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I can't believe we're talking about who Trump may/may not be attracted to. There are real issues, but let's discuss who he thinks is cute.
788475682162667520 2016-10-18 20:23:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> They also believe GW Bush killed more than Stalin. The two polls void each other out and we're still left with...Millennials.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/788436007796506625

785937412820049920 2016-10-11 20:17:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket You always speak the truth. Now tell me, where do you stand on the issue of candy corn? Choose wisely.
785931459358056448 2016-10-11 19:53:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket Yes, you are correct. As usual.
785931080335581184 2016-10-11 19:52:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket We really had a shot this election. An actual shot. And look what we came up with.
785923711287238656 2016-10-11 19:23:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Go look at the sample ballot where you reside. Figure out who you're voting for down the ballot. There's more at stake than Oval Office.

785893106835128320 2016-10-11 17:21:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump supporter, Ben Carson, talking on @CNN how Americans don't want to make an embarrassing choice, and doing so without sarcasm. #sigh

785555513752719366 2016-10-10 19:00:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> At this point, the only reason to have another debate is so we can create more memes and gifs from its content.

785514581145821184 2016-10-10 16:17:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Regarding #Debates2016 Should we keep them?
785509468129914884 2016-10-10 15:57:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MaureenShaw Also, voting for someone *is* endorsing them. No way for Paul Ryan and others to get around that.
785507406210035717 2016-10-10 15:48:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And yes, I'm still #NeverTrump. That won't be changing.
785507302317158400 2016-10-10 15:48:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I can understand (just don't agree with) those who vote Trump to stop Hillary. But approving of his words/actions is another thing entirely.
785483435758477313 2016-10-10 14:13:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Oh, Falwell. Those propping Trump up *are* the Establishment.https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/785444794181029888
785471995676921856 2016-10-10 13:28:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Why not one non-Raddatz moderator, no audience, each candidate has two minutes to answer each question, no follow-ups, etc?
785471238122668032 2016-10-10 13:25:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Good morning. #coffee
785320032029073408 2016-10-09 03:24:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This always applies: "Put not your trust in princes..."  {Psalm146 :3}
785304816734105601 2016-10-09 02:23:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Someone let Bill Mitchell know that Trump thinks Twitter is totally, like, awesome. #Debates2016
785303545683775489 2016-10-09 02:18:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Please, Hillary, don't mention how you're a CHAMPION FOR ALL when you support abortion in the 3rd trimester. Ok thanks. #Debates2016
785301847527530496 2016-10-09 02:12:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The Raddatz v Trump debate tonight, apparently. #Debates2016

785297684877934592 2016-10-09 01:55:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The "fair share" idea is so absurd. What does that actually mean? Whatever your hipster feelings say at the time? #Debates2016
785297036694478849 2016-10-09 01:52:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Sorry, both of the candidates on stage tonight are liars, Trump. Not just Hillz. #Debates2016
785296381653188608 2016-10-09 01:50:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Private stance on issues? Hillary's running mate is personally against abortion but professionally for it. #Kaine #Debates2016
785295103229325312 2016-10-09 01:45:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump said Capt. Khan would be alive today if he were president. Amazing coming from someone who gets enraged by tweets. #Debates2016
785292056163909632 2016-10-09 01:33:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> "...start over again" sounds like a great suggestion for this trainwreck election we're watching. #debate
785288679103356929 2016-10-09 01:19:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's clear that Trump hasn't been in an actual locker room in a while, y'all. #debate

785261602756976640 2016-10-09 23:32:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> One of my favorite moments of this election cycle was when @CarlyFiorina ripped on Hillary's support of abortion at Reagan Library debate.
785257949081907200 2016-10-09 23:17:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No, I don't trust women when it comes to abortion. That's how we've arrived at 52,000,000+ deaths since Roe v. Wade. Yay empowerment.
785257234590597120 2016-10-09 23:14:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You certainly aren't pro-life but you're definitely a fan of rationalization.https://twitter.com/MaureenShaw/status/785255550720368640

785205367592583168 2016-10-09 19:48:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I have a little over 100 votes on my latest Twitter poll. If I were Bill Mitchell, I might think that's the heartbeat of America.
785193680684605440 2016-10-09 19:02:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Tonight is the 2nd #PresidentialDebate. Has your vote, whatever it is, changed since the first one for any reason? #Election2016
785182534070046720 2016-10-09 18:17:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Tonight's debate is a town hall style, which neither candidate is great at, and one may need assistance to move around during.
785180150279315456 2016-10-09 18:08:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Like I've said, the audio/video release, though still disgusting, is something we expect from Trump. We've known who he is all along.
785166093597937664 2016-10-09 17:12:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ChasFlemming Aw, still hoping for @tedcruz to be better than he is, I see.
785159915476221953 2016-10-09 16:48:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> So that's a "no" as to whether you'll take back your endorsement of him? Got it.https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/785154577209315328

785125375768662016 2016-10-09 14:30:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It is ok to have a problem with how both the Clintons and Trump have treated/talked about women. It's alright. Don't play favesies.
784974918467354624 2016-10-08 04:32:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lrc328 Agreed. Andrea Tantaros said she liked my glasses once, but it was downhill from there. @coolhandschlute

784944963264086016 2016-10-08 02:33:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> There are PLENTY of reasons to not vote for Trump that have nothing to do with the news in the last 24 hours. Nice job, GOP.
784931087986335744 2016-10-08 01:38:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MartiniShark As long as no one touches the chocolate + peanut butter combination.
784917262872510465 2016-10-08 00:43:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> First Skittles, then Tic Tacs. If Trump causes Peanut Butter M&Ms to issue a tweet about respecting a people group, then I'll be livid.
784916636109303808 2016-10-08 00:41:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket Lol. Also, no.

784525391406981120 2016-10-07 22:46:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @maxwellarm And now I am.
784512432089669632 2016-10-07 21:55:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> We had. The chance. To place. An actual conservative and decent person in the White House. But j/k.
784503388390232065 2016-10-07 21:19:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @GeorgeWept I think so...
784501295881199616 2016-10-07 21:10:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Deplorables gonna deplorable.
784499893247238144 2016-10-07 21:05:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hmm. Bob must not like that I'm #NeverTrump. He sure likes to add me to lists even though I don't matter...pic.twitter.com/WvbE3P8fN6
784497749173669888 2016-10-07 20:56:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PhantomQuasar Well, you'll hear it often. :)
784496729886433280 2016-10-07 20:52:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> That's a shame, especially since they're just as much a part of the equation as women.https://twitter.com/tristanpc/status/784496214209339392
784494140956536832 2016-10-07 20:42:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PhantomQuasar Do I look like a pro-abort woman?! ;)
784494080399147008 2016-10-07 20:42:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And also, if you're a male Hillary supporter, what kind of feminist female are you trying to impress? The man bun hairstyle isn't cute.
784493617419264000 2016-10-07 20:40:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Thank you, pro-life men, for defending the unborn. You're just as much a part of the conversation as women.
784486174593282049 2016-10-07 20:10:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No. It means you're a coward since you don't defend the most helpless among us - the unborn. Coward.https://twitter.com/guycecil/status/784485219026014209
784484887780855809 2016-10-07 20:05:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Legality doesn't equal morality. Difficult concept for some.

783503317183918080 2016-10-04 03:05:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yeah, they don't have any. They need to be men and defend and protect the most helpless among us.

783495874211184648 2016-10-04 02:35:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @R_U_Srs Pro-choice before conception, pro-life after.
783494511439872000 2016-10-04 02:30:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Kaine is an absolute weakling regarding the life issue. He probably has a uterus tattoo on his arm. #VPDebate
783494380543995904 2016-10-04 02:29:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I don't trust American women when it comes to them wanting to end the life of their unborn children. #VPDebate
783493979123904512 2016-10-04 02:28:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Holding pro-life views personally but being pro-abort publicly makes no sense. Tim Kaine does that. #VPDebate
783493276544430080 2016-10-04 02:25:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Tim Kaine is a pro-abort Catholic. Hard to top that kind of spinelessness. #VPDebate
783492892249755649 2016-10-04 02:23:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> All y'all have questionable foundations. #VPDebate
783488218314530816 2016-10-04 02:05:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Now, the next time someone in real life is rude, interrupts, and appears unstable, I'm going to say "Stop Tim Kaining". #VPDebate

783477418426306561 2016-10-04 01:22:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It had to happen once. They had to do their best to match skin tones.
783477253401374720 2016-10-04 01:21:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> When Kaine doesn't talk, he almost seems nice. Then he begins to speak. What a perfect running mate for Hillz. #VPDebate
783476660935004160 2016-10-04 01:19:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I cannot imagine Trump and Pence in the same room, having a discussion.

781901086344880133 2016-09-30 16:58:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm going to go ahead and profile...and say this should make us uncomfortable.https://twitter.com/wcnc/status/781858485189373952
781872878237151232 2016-09-30 15:06:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No, I don't HAVE to vote for anyone. And I'm certainly not voting for a non-conservative, incompetent huckster like Trump. https://twitter.com/Sansla0/status/781872307421798402
781867513000976388 2016-09-30 14:45:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @VLRAmyCurtis Haha. I try to be on fleek, or whatever they say now.
781863339915898880 2016-09-30 14:28:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PhantomQuasar Because he has an (R) next to his name. Yes, this is the reasoning from some voters. Foolish.
781862474605797376 2016-09-30 14:25:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I love when people ask why we question Trump. Well, because we demand a BETTER candidate than the other side. That's why.
781861141773488128 2016-09-30 14:19:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Exactly. Neither get a pass,https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/781847289832759299

781821124321615872 2016-09-30 11:40:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The first rule about Donald's campaign is you don't talk about Donald's campaign. Or something.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/781755469488615424

781688926910222336 2016-09-29 02:55:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump's comments about women show that he's an absolute jerk. It's the other, substantive things that show he's unfit for the presidency.

781145225351798784 2016-09-28 14:55:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> America was just subjected to a debate between two incompetents, and we're focused on discussing a beauty queen from 1996. Thanks, 2016.

780857901174841344 2016-09-27 19:53:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Women for Trump? Women for Hillary? LOL that women would want to support either one. They're both pro-dismiss, use, and/or abuse you.

780812446349070336 2016-09-27 16:52:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> He wanted to win favor with the Trump set, and he did, by endorsing their Cheeto leader. So, yeah. Time to accept he's a sellout.https://twitter.com/jbnv/status/780809625595707393
780804817195307008 2016-09-27 16:22:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Really. It's disgusting seeing Hillary sell herself as a champion for children when she consistently denies right to life for the unborn.

780771892152115200 2016-09-27 14:11:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hillary fans think Hillary won.  Trump fans think Trump won.  Debates are entertainment, not much more.

780587326200250368 2016-09-26 01:58:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hillary, endorsed by @PPact, says "one murder is too many" with a straight face. #debatenight
780586246317932545 2016-09-26 01:53:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Cool explanation. Neither deserve my vote.
780585221204877319 2016-09-26 01:49:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The lesser of two evils...is still evil. I am choosing neither.
780584524606541824 2016-09-26 01:47:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Surely she'll mention Chicago when talking about the gun epidemic, right? Surely. #debatenight

780476807325814784 2016-09-26 18:39:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MartiniShark But Brad, he's not Hillary. ;)
780475413558652929 2016-09-26 18:33:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Will the performance of either candidate in tonight's debate have an impact on your vote? #DebateNight
780474262197006338 2016-09-26 18:28:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MartiniShark The definition of "never" hasn't changed for me.
780471080565825536 2016-09-26 18:16:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @tex_sconsin Really, neither major party candidate is someone I can support. Trump doesn't represent me and my beliefs.

780419044268773376 2016-09-26 14:49:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Why? Because he's supposed to throw softballs to Hillary and will get in trouble if he doesn't?https://twitter.com/NPR/status/780379227094937600
780402937084477440 2016-09-26 13:45:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The Left is so excited about the historicity of tonight's debate because Hillary is a female. Yet she's a horrible representative of women.
780392911670276096 2016-09-26 13:05:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The consensus on this poll seems to be: "I hate this election."  Yes, so do we all.https://twitter.com/SouthernKeeks/status/780170488760893440

780198278428262400 2016-09-25 00:12:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @WomAgainstFem @Johnjunior85 @imapotato Not disagreeing with that at all. Just saying feminism - white and black - is destructive.
780193320328757248 2016-09-25 23:52:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> 2nd/3rd wave feminism is toxic to society as a whole. Black feminism/intersectional feminism is harmful, too.https://twitter.com/Johnjunior85/status/780191488626032640

779896470577176577 2016-09-24 04:13:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> My thanks to this election cycle for revealing some of the ridiculous on the Right, like the Obama-like cult mentality called pro-Trump.
779890509921722369 2016-09-24 03:49:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'd like to give the mute button a big, squeezy hug. 
779887465532235778 2016-09-24 03:37:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I love people like @MrNoPC2016 who abandon principles (if he ever had them) in order to "win". That's the opposite of being principled.
779883881738534912 2016-09-24 03:23:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @tjdraperpro Heh. Exactly. @MrNoPC2016
779883588707758080 2016-09-24 03:21:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @randicus79 @ATXmanx Wow. Stop rationalizing to make your bad choice seem better. We're constantly told he's the "lesser" of two evils.

779824455627386880 2016-09-24 23:26:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes @thehill

779819904459350016 2016-09-24 23:08:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If you could win an award for dropping your phone, I would win all the awards. Thankfully, it's an Android, so it doesn't break. 
779795857533235200 2016-09-24 21:33:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I happily stand in opposition to these 2nd/3rd wave pro-abort, victim mentality, "compliments are oppression!" feminists. Happily.
779793456038281216 2016-09-24 21:23:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The most BASIC right is right to life. You must grant that to all, regardless of if they're planned or not, before addressing the others.
779792658252324864 2016-09-24 21:20:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If you say you're for "equality" and you support abortion...you're not for equality at all.
779792071976685568 2016-09-24 21:18:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Just not while they're in the womb, so you're not a champion for females at all.https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/779788945953591296
779762686582218752 2016-09-24 19:21:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Saw Hillary ad where she says: "...want every child to live up to their God-given potential."  The irony of pro-aborts & pro-child/God talk.
779756030641205248 2016-09-24 18:54:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Aw, shucks.
779755073018691584 2016-09-24 18:51:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I checked again this morning, and I'm still #NeverTrump.

779681428544090112 2016-09-24 13:58:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Has your view of Jeb! changed since Cruz endorsed Trump, and Jeb! hasn't and probably won't?

779670697454993408 2016-09-24 13:15:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Glad to bring some cheer this morning. ;)
779663838698405888 2016-09-24 12:48:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> What a tired, incoherent argument. So how does a vote for neither influence the outcome again?? Hmm?https://twitter.com/ATXmanx/status/779662828584202240
779660707134603264 2016-09-24 12:36:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @im_marcie Agreed. Not sure why there's such confusion.

779521325031313408 2016-09-23 03:22:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MacBreck Aww. You sound mad that your candidate is a sellout.

779509583664513024 2016-09-23 02:35:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It *really* is humorous to see those who seethed with hatred for Cruz not long ago start making BFF bracelets for him.
779487084818141184 2016-09-23 01:06:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Whaat? No. Absolutely not. How horrific. First Cruz endorses Trump, now a remake/reboot of MacGyver. Thanks a lot, universe.https://twitter.com/EW/status/779485880260128768
779481490648293376 2016-09-23 00:44:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @walakewon I can relate to her.
779478342441373696 2016-09-23 00:31:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @cherylmil24 Yes, she was. Such a great mini-series.
779478111712751616 2016-09-23 00:30:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @maxwellarm This is why I called you a troublemaker.
779477433837682688 2016-09-23 00:27:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @cherylmil24 She is my favorite! 
779475856943034372 2016-09-23 00:21:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I bet people who see my last tweet now think I'm a nerd.
779469935005339648 2016-09-23 23:58:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes, Trump is different than Hillary. Different in the way a glass of gasoline is from a glass of arsenic. I'm not drinking either one.
779442931090399232 2016-09-23 22:10:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I wonder how many legit Cruz supporters will actually support Trump now. Very few, I'm guessing. But it is 2016...

779427325284868096 2016-09-23 21:08:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Let's all say it together: "Politicians gonna politician."
779416528286515200 2016-09-23 20:25:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Oh, look. I'm still #NeverTrump.
779406954292715520 2016-09-23 19:47:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PaineInTheNeck Neither deserves my vote. Neither will get my vote. Cruz is a sellout.
779405116722016256 2016-09-23 19:40:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PaineInTheNeck Good for him and you. I'm still #NeverTrump.
779402887806017537 2016-09-23 19:31:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And there you go. A Trump endorsement from Cruz. Sad.https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/779401886403145728

779386465201623040 2016-09-23 18:26:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BrunusCutis See my tweet right after that one. I've always been aware of this.
779385390683852802 2016-09-23 18:22:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Politicians gonna politician.
779385312694902787 2016-09-23 18:21:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If Ted Cruz officially endorses Trump, which he supposedly will do, then he is no different than the others who have disappointed.

779350185411547136 2016-09-23 16:02:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> 2nd and 3rd wave feminism has given society a crowd of cowardly, incapable women who expect us to praise their idiocy. Nope. #BeBoldEndHyde
779345647178833920 2016-09-23 15:44:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You say I can't have an opinion about your abortion but ask me and others to fund it? No. That's not brave. #BeBoldEndHyde

779143792226021376 2016-09-22 02:22:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @josh_hammer Of course. It will be an entertaining trainwreck that's fun to write about. 
779142932188139520 2016-09-22 02:18:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @josh_hammer I actually am...

779045235791888384 2016-09-22 19:50:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Twitter never suspended those (more than one) who have wished that I would die in a fire because of my pro-life views...
778987641266171904 2016-09-22 16:01:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You don't get to attempt to set others on fire, beat some up, loot, etc., and call it the defense of what is right. You don't. #Charlotte

778777833783095296 2016-09-21 02:07:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Per @CNN "person killed at Charlotte protest by another civilian"  Sad. Sickening. #CharlotteProtest
778777457667219456 2016-09-21 02:06:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Looting isn't protesting. It's criminal activity. #CharlotteProtest
778775798660685824 2016-09-21 01:59:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I have no problem with peaceful protests, but don't act like you're doing anything but demonstrating.
778775053475381248 2016-09-21 01:56:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I have yet to see something like #CharlotteProtest or NFL demonstrations lead to actual, positive change.

778738663383375874 2016-09-21 23:32:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I like that I am accused of having a "princess" mentality because I think men SHOULD lend their voices to the pro-life cause.
778732146928160769 2016-09-21 23:06:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Equality means all deserve basic rights. Most basic of all, right TO life. Being against abortion is promoting true equality. https://twitter.com/spinachgreen420/status/778729659814993920

778701885960105984 2016-09-21 21:06:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Why should an unborn child be executed for another's crime? Then two crimes have been committed.https://twitter.com/talk_74/status/778699814288502784

777681137959366656 2016-09-18 01:30:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Scrolling through my list, and everyone is so tense and angry tonight...even more than usual.   Here's a ((hug)), Twitter.
777634720112869377 2016-09-18 22:25:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Dwight_Dale If those in the black community choose not to vote that's entirely different from the idea that ID laws disenfranchise them.
777634554630864896 2016-09-18 22:25:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Dwight_Dale Heh. Not sure how you got that.
777631905487396868 2016-09-18 22:14:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> So the black community might *choose* to not vote? And this whole time I thought voter ID laws were racist.https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/777596889810214912
777621376702287872 2016-09-18 21:32:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You mean nerd glasses. I'm no social justice warrior. 
777617375675944960 2016-09-18 21:16:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's 2016. There's not much left that can actually scare us.https://twitter.com/TheSun/status/777614929247539201

777582766921834496 2016-09-18 18:59:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> FYI - it sure isn't Islamophobia which shouts "Allah Akbar" then attacks innocent people.
777549488802201601 2016-09-18 16:46:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @brakinggnus I'm originally from the Midwest. I actually miss snow.

776441492315316226 2016-09-15 15:24:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @StevenTebay Hey, they usually make me about 6 feet tall. Taller females are often told not to wear them. I wear them anyway.
776439508417916928 2016-09-15 15:16:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @StevenTebay Plenty of heels *are* comfortable, and we like the way we look/walk in them as compared to flats. :)
776438632567611392 2016-09-15 15:12:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @StevenTebay They're not for everyone, and some aren't the most comfortable, but wearing them sure isn't a form of sexism.
776430327925465088 2016-09-15 14:39:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> .@laurakfillault They want to blur the lines between genders. I say rock your gender specific dress and attitude even more.
776428815774081024 2016-09-15 14:33:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The truth about our love of high heels. Deal with that, feminists.https://twitter.com/laurakfillault/status/776428679257665536
776428436206260224 2016-09-15 14:32:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @laurakfillault Exactly! They elongate our legs, give us better posture, increase confidence. No one is ditching them.
776427910848806914 2016-09-15 14:30:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Dumb suggestion. High heels are chosen by women. Many of us love to wear them & we're not about to give them up.https://twitter.com/mashable/status/776041329411366912
776413623035961346 2016-09-15 13:33:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> But definitely not pre-birth babies, because they're the worst and up for destruction by way of legal homicide.https://twitter.com/lizcgoodwin/status/776383950109507584

775900342399692801 2016-09-13 03:33:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @winningatmylife Out in public I wish we all wore hats, women wore dresses, and men wore suits. Love those classy looks.
775899026004803584 2016-09-13 03:28:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @winningatmylife I never look right in a headband.

775844802860548101 2016-09-13 23:53:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> My favorite are those who keep saying "You DO know either Hillary or Trump will win, right?" in an effort to sway me.    #NeverTrump

775801958376628224 2016-09-13 21:02:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Just saw Pumpkin Spice Oreos. Me, a basic white woman who enjoys wearing scarves and likes Michael Buble, say that's taking it too far.

775739606201462785 2016-09-13 16:55:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @texlovera I don't think she's on her deathbed.
775722711800766464 2016-09-13 15:48:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's not Hillary's health that's the problem. It's the secrecy & claims of heroism for her and sexism for her detractors that it reveals.
775719238195609600 2016-09-13 15:34:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It sounds like a @KFoleyFL thing.https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/775710804821671936

775535927083098113 2016-09-12 03:25:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm just waiting for someone to tell me their "side" never does wrong.
775535424932642816 2016-09-12 03:23:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Until citizenry admits police force is necessary at times and police admit some of theirs go too far, we won't move in the right direction.
775533188244447232 2016-09-12 03:14:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AtticusGF I see the same talk from each "side". Honestly.
775532890067202048 2016-09-12 03:13:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @nflattegirl Yes, I've seen it. @SenatorTimScott @AtticusGF @BruceNV
775532774388301829 2016-09-12 03:13:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AtticusGF Again, Kaepernick's protesting won't really do anything.
775521606164746240 2016-09-12 02:28:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AtticusGF People were already talking. Now they're talking about him. Not sure how that gets us from Point A to Point B.
775520467025326080 2016-09-12 02:24:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Kaepernick & others to demonstrate until police brutality ends. Ok. How will their kneeling/fists raised bring about anything constructive?

775316752599318528 2016-09-12 12:54:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Plenty of men in U.S. politics think ambition is qualification, too.
775304726892122113 2016-09-12 12:07:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I absolutely do deny this. Seeking to put a female in office just because she's a female is nothing but sexism.https://twitter.com/jes_chastain/status/775023956994629632
775199728975740928 2016-09-11 05:09:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If Hillary was/is bad for health and other reasons, you shouldn't have picked incoherent reality boy, GOP. Painful lesson.
775173861499281408 2016-09-11 03:27:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @SweetieWalker Apparently. Twitter told me.
775170047190798337 2016-09-11 03:11:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @joshualebeck I said "wasn't".
775168647241146368 2016-09-11 03:06:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The new Miss America crowned tonight wasn't the first openly gay contestant. Cue homophobic accusations.

775153843235454976 2016-09-11 02:07:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> May I state the obvious? Hillary is not on her deathbed. She wasn't and isn't.
775152389573578752 2016-09-11 02:01:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @neontaster False. It doesn't take that long for you to destroy those who annoy you.
775123959779962880 2016-09-11 00:08:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I don't celebrate whatever illness Hillary has, but come on. You can't ever describe her as "heroic". Deplorable? Yes.
775096663325024256 2016-09-11 22:20:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @nancrews Because we're twins. 
775096004672487424 2016-09-11 22:17:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Why not announce Hillary has pneumonia when diagnosed? The secrecy is more of a problem than anything...

774801176143486977 2016-09-10 02:46:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Another night, another @seanhannity meltdown against those he says are insignificant...yet somehow are destroying poor Donald.

774662859863298049 2016-09-10 17:36:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hillary Clinton is a Planned Parenthood backed candidate. She fits the definition of deplorable.

774596809247293444 2016-09-10 13:14:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TheValuesVoter I've written over and over about Trumpkins and those among them. I just think Hillary isn't any better.

774393201499209728 2016-09-09 23:45:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I've changed my mind about an important choice between two options.   I now admit that Chick-fil-A sauce IS better than Polynesian sauce.
774360326267625472 2016-09-09 21:34:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Is there one for women who are anti-feminists, too? I'd like to take both workshops so I can fail them.https://twitter.com/EvrydayFeminism/status/771905579107442688
774352837706776576 2016-09-09 21:04:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The WORST kind of people are those who believe 9/11 was an inside job or a hoax, not a terrorist attack.
774345929625260032 2016-09-09 20:37:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket Well that is so nice, my friend. Believe me, it's mutual! You've been a great support and encouragement to me.

774061189835829252 2016-09-08 01:45:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Dwight_Dale No. Because the same two players say they'll protest then turn around & say they won't shows they need to keep them shut. ;)
774060068337614849 2016-09-08 01:41:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Apparently, the Seahawks team may be planning to honor our flag & country on Sunday instead. Perhaps some players need to keep mouths shut.

773977130292146177 2016-09-08 20:11:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes
773968748394975232 2016-09-08 19:38:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This is your daily reminder that feelings don't change biological fact: abortion kills a human life and transgenderism is a mental issue.
773947799218053120 2016-09-08 18:15:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @onwardmyhawkmen Being "chosen" based on my chromosomes is just as offensive as if I were to be disqualified because of them. Pure sexism.
773931948360228864 2016-09-08 17:12:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JJPatriot Depressing and true.

773929022506078209 2016-09-08 17:00:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Sure, I'd vote for a female for president, as long as she was qualified and represented my beliefs. That's not con Hillary or crazy Stein.

773877927108833280 2016-09-08 13:37:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @tjdraperpro Well, we agree on a few. Archer *is* the worst.
773876864293232640 2016-09-08 13:33:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @technickelgeek The show. I do enjoy the movie Kirk, though. But that's entirely separate.

773875050764181504 2016-09-08 13:26:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Sorry, Gary Johnson should know about #Aleppo. He doesn't get a pass on this just because Trump would know even less than him.
773871268542222336 2016-09-08 13:11:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Happy 50th anniversary to Star Trek!! Grew up on it, and still enjoy watching it. #StarTrek50 #LiveLongAndProsper

772952718415568896 2016-09-05 00:21:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Truth: "Feminism is doomed to failure because it is based on an attempt to repeal and restructure human nature." {Phyllis Schlafly}

772931941645619200 2016-09-05 22:58:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @VLRAmyCurtis @Sjanderson86 Exactly, Steve. 
772928713658863617 2016-09-05 22:45:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You spelled those-glasses-are-awesome incorrectly. And no, I'll keep them. #LookAway https://twitter.com/AnaheimDucksWin/status/772921406753378306

772900567555403776 2016-09-05 20:53:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AndreaNRuth No, 55 is perfect. ;)
772899828519034880 2016-09-05 20:50:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Have a good one!
772898953482428416 2016-09-05 20:47:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No, I'm good. :)
772898820019585028 2016-09-05 20:46:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Defend your guy all you want, but assuming others must actually like Trump just because they don't share your opinion is foolish.
772897802296893441 2016-09-05 20:42:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You're free to mute or block, as we all are.
772897597652623360 2016-09-05 20:42:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Log off Twitter is opposing opinions are too much.
772897392366608384 2016-09-05 20:41:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hahaha. Ok, Beth. ;)
772897157758287876 2016-09-05 20:40:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Like I said, don't act like a liberal.
772896984743219200 2016-09-05 20:39:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You still assume people are Trumpkins if they didn't support your guy. That's not being past 2016.
772896498388467713 2016-09-05 20:37:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Not really...
772896176270110725 2016-09-05 20:36:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's just the truth, Beth. Choosing someone other than *your* candidate doesn't mean that person likes Trump. Basic sense.
772889050650910721 2016-09-05 20:08:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> That is quite evident.
772888420179906560 2016-09-05 20:05:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The subject matter I wrote about earlier definitely needed addressing since too many *still* think their non-Trump candidate was/is perfect.
772887712399560704 2016-09-05 20:02:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Lol. He's not. Just because he's not a Cruz fan doesn't mean he likes Trump. Don't act like a liberal. ;)

769706266625204225 2016-08-27 01:20:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Thank. You. They always annoy me! https://twitter.com/KristinaRibali/status/769706004418355200
769679429169668096 2016-08-27 23:34:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Words are wonderful. Actual plans are way better.https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/769678144072802305
769603783714373634 2016-08-27 18:33:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @maxwellarm Same here.
769602663348658176 2016-08-27 18:29:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Listened to some Christmas music yesterday, and I have no shame. 
769529856744943616 2016-08-27 13:39:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Wow. No condolences to the family, just "vote for me!" https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/769526017887080449
769373729382105088 2016-08-26 03:19:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @GayPatriot Oh, that's horrible. If anyone unfollows you it should be for your ever-changing name/avi.  @Ali_in_So_Cali @pambesteder
769365435183665152 2016-08-26 02:46:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @aurora_g96 Go watch the delicious trailer.
769365053371998208 2016-08-26 02:44:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @alwaysonoffense He could even shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose voters. Nothing will sway them from supporting the madman.
769364054569783296 2016-08-26 02:40:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @_David_Edward I sense.....extreme sarcasm.
769363805784707074 2016-08-26 02:40:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @alwaysonoffense Yes. Yes, he did. But Trump is a FIGHTER, Ryan.
769362617831923712 2016-08-26 02:35:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Anyone excited about the live action "Beauty & the Beast" coming out in March? Because I am. It looks lovely.
769347458568687621 2016-08-26 01:35:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> So much complaining about men and women not being equal. Guess what? That's a natural, good thing. Both have strengths/weaknesses.
769345250263457792 2016-08-26 01:26:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @redsteeze Cats *are* the best, and this cat is fantastic.
769291350835625989 2016-08-26 21:52:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If only all unborn females were given a chance at life, too. That's basic equality. #WomensEqualityDay
769263011483844609 2016-08-26 19:59:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> 1. Zika infections don't necessarily result in microcephaly.  2. Babies born with disabilities aren't worth less.https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/769261907324706820
769171836315770881 2016-08-26 13:57:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Modern American feminism: complain when no one looks their way, but if anyone does they wonder aloud why they're staring. #WomensEqualityDay
769162385299017729 2016-08-26 13:19:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's always a fun day to tweet...and disrupt modern American feminism. 
769161220385607680 2016-08-26 13:14:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Pay inequality based on gender is a myth. That other problem is just rudeness, not oppression, honey. ;)https://twitter.com/semisweetPatti/status/769159669369757696
769158289489887233 2016-08-26 13:03:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> First wave feminism helped to secure our right to vote. The second & third waves have been/are toxic to society. #WomensEqualityDay
769157631168614401 2016-08-26 13:00:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> There are women who live under extreme oppression. They are not American women. #WomensEqualityDay
769021483599429633 2016-08-25 03:59:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lrc328 Haha. I'll just stick to texting if needed. :)

768998071359287297 2016-08-25 02:26:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MikeDury ...but there are flower crown filters, Mike!
768994807041499136 2016-08-25 02:13:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> That is exactly what prompted my tweet.
768994332531535872 2016-08-25 02:11:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @crimson_nerd  We are nerds.
768993692866588672 2016-08-25 02:09:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @crimson_nerd I like Riker, but prefer he not be a captain. I know, that's harsh.
768992061408153600 2016-08-25 02:02:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @crimson_nerd It's good. I like TNG first, then DS9 followed closely by Voyager.

768988771450691584 2016-08-25 01:49:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @maxwellarm So cool people don't!
768988529435160576 2016-08-25 01:48:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Pretty sure I'm the only person who doesn't have Snapchat...
768958497300045824 2016-08-25 23:49:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Oh, he's not changing anything. He's just using different words. Or something.https://twitter.com/ajjaffe/status/768943314217406464

768929858860650497 2016-08-25 21:55:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @GluedThumbs Bahaha. Maybe not.
768929613523197952 2016-08-25 21:54:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @maxwellarm You spelled "you're so adorable" incorrectly.
768899115640090624 2016-08-25 19:53:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @bothofus7 Yes, it is. He's against Jews and thinks Sandy Hook was a hoax. Hateful & unstable. Great combination.

768865504471707648 2016-08-25 17:39:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> #AltRightMeans a lot of things, and I happily stand in opposition to it.
768835770836742145 2016-08-25 15:41:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The Trump campaign in a nutshell. Great job, GOP!https://twitter.com/ErikWemple/status/768798519398395904
768833849526738944 2016-08-25 15:34:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> We saw that in Obama voters & it's important that we realize it's among Rs, too. @CaseyYeakle @ScotsFyre @Libertar_Latino
768820837659009024 2016-08-25 14:42:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This is great. I am sure Millennial snowflakes are distraught, but it'll build character.https://twitter.com/OrenKessler/status/768818050992893952
768656335395254272 2016-08-24 03:48:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> From @davidharsanyi: "demanding...people vote for immoral, corrupt demagoguesis one of the most un-American things I can think of."
768655460434075648 2016-08-24 03:45:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Again...I am not required to support either one. Neither represents me.https://twitter.com/thehiredmind/status/768654659267493888
768653781009596417 2016-08-24 03:38:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray That's a difficult concept for some... @thehiredmind
768652451750838272 2016-08-24 03:33:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Oh, that's another "fun" argument.
768651654581329921 2016-08-24 03:30:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I just choose not to vote for either evil. ;)https://twitter.com/thehiredmind/status/768651455938957312
768650944611516416 2016-08-24 03:27:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump's only consistency is his inconsistency.   "...BUT WHY AREN'T YOU VOTING FOR HIM???"  Sigh.
768650728940253184 2016-08-24 03:26:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray It's exhausting.
768650624422608900 2016-08-24 03:26:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Oh look, the "lesser of two evils" argument. Yawn.https://twitter.com/thehiredmind/status/768650395086262274
768649855740874752 2016-08-24 03:23:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You're going to trust a non-conservative who has already proven he backtracks and flip flops. I won't.https://twitter.com/thehiredmind/status/768648754744266752
768630430215999488 2016-08-24 02:05:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BruceNV Because I'm not going for the Richard Dean Anderson look.
768628672001519616 2016-08-24 01:58:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Got new sunglasses today that look like my actual glasses w/dark lenses. I wish I could wear aviators, but then I look like girl MacGyver.

768584212379267072 2016-08-24 23:02:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> .@ATXmanx Have fun with that. I'm not voting for either liberal, no matter what letter is next to their name. ;)
768583810657157120 2016-08-24 23:00:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm only comparing Trump to himself, what he says, and how he flip flops.https://twitter.com/thehiredmind/status/768583397732003840
768582320282562560 2016-08-24 22:54:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> But he'll totally appoint conservative justices. Mmkay. https://twitter.com/SopanDeb/status/768574809122803712

768577311616724998 2016-08-24 22:34:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Ultimate irony: people who deny the most basic right to life to discuss rights. #brave https://twitter.com/PPact/status/768573133229953024
768513780208668672 2016-08-24 18:22:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> #NeverTrump continues through election day, because it's always been about refusing to support him no matter the outcome.

768480369016315904 2016-08-24 16:09:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The hilarity that is a Trump supporter trying to sway me. Apparently there is still confusion on what "never" means.
768447372275752960 2016-08-24 13:58:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket Avocado spread is good!
768440430560096256 2016-08-24 13:30:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Sorry, I already make sammiches for @Patriot_Musket.

768437487572099073 2016-08-24 13:19:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Whatever!  @Patriot_Musket
768304054103519232 2016-08-23 04:28:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JustEric Well,  Twitter is the Upside Down.
768301978799661057 2016-08-23 04:20:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JustEric Isn't it the best?! So many great elements.
768228733182357504 2016-08-23 23:29:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Difficult concept for some. @JasRWard
768222876046598147 2016-08-23 23:06:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And I'm voting for neither candidate, because neither represents me. Thanks, James. https://twitter.com/JasRWard/status/768191110640390148

768172321655943168 2016-08-23 19:45:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Despite facts showing the opposite, 3rd wave feminists will always push lies about pay disparity. Because they're in the grievance business.
768159516395470848 2016-08-23 18:54:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Harper1Lew You calm down! Kidding. 
768153484277518336 2016-08-23 18:30:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> 76 days until the election, or whenever our country becomes Mordor. Whichever you prefer.
768146451025231872 2016-08-23 18:02:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Harper1Lew Um, you can keep those and your assumptions. I'm happy to be here, live in a great place, and life is good.
768131618540285952 2016-08-23 17:03:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @donsmithshow He's losing, he will lose, and I'll be glad. He's no conservative.
768130811593973760 2016-08-23 17:00:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Jim_in_302 Twitter accounts and big crowds mean something! Heh. @donsmithshow @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump
768130644664877056 2016-08-23 16:59:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @donsmithshow You're missing the point entirely, Don.

768125160121589760 2016-08-23 16:38:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No. And if I was, still no. 
768124030041919489 2016-08-23 16:33:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The R nominee is spending time in what should be an easily winnable non-swing Deep South state. Desperation. https://twitter.com/donsmithshow/status/768122664334528513

767830053161803778 2016-08-22 21:05:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If Trumpkins honestly believed their guy would easily win, they wouldn't keep telling us who they're ready to blame if he doesn't.
767827780989956096 2016-08-22 20:56:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes. Other people read history books, too. Also, the tweet is a joke.https://twitter.com/theNostromo/status/767827173856145411

767778832392790016 2016-08-22 17:41:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The abortion ban means lives are saved when women think longer about whether they want to murder their child. #FIFYhttps://twitter.com/PPact/status/767777899680333824

764056140061798400 2016-08-12 11:09:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump clearly doesn't know what words mean. That's a yuge problem.
763924953078964225 2016-08-11 02:27:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> "Hillary is a horrible candidate" is not reason enough to keep silent about Trump. I *expect* us to offer a better candidate. #NeverTrump

763062094577164288 2016-08-09 17:19:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I do need to hear more about his policy positions. I'm ok with his experience level. It isn't the most, but it's solid.

756149216917848065 2016-07-21 15:29:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> "Vote your conscience" is like "All lives matter". Those who 'boo' the phrase claim moral superiority...but their dislike says everything.

756132264212324352 2016-07-21 14:22:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I don't support Hillary, nor do I support the candidate whose nomination secures her victory: Trump. https://twitter.com/GrimesSue/status/756131692528697344

756130837599555584 2016-07-21 14:16:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MsD_408 That's not his only misstep. We simply disagree.

756125057278218241 2016-07-21 13:53:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I honestly thought he'd play it safe and was pleasantly surprised.   So there. I admit I was wrong about Cruz's reason for attending. 
756123388503031808 2016-07-21 13:47:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I was wrong about Cruz's convention appearance: glad he ruffled feathers, didn't  endorse Trump, and spoke of true conservatism.

755964978474123264 2016-07-20 03:17:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @FixUSANow Does the word "never" confuse you?
755964779215413249 2016-07-20 03:17:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Same goes for Walker and Rubio, by the way.
755964618409992192 2016-07-20 03:16:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I appreciate Cruz's non-endorsement of Trump, but he aligned himself too much with him this election cycle, like other candidates have.
755949681675530240 2016-07-20 02:17:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yeah, the person I choose to vote for. And it sure isn't Trump. ;)https://twitter.com/Rightisred/status/755948496310579201

755761494063800320 2016-07-20 13:49:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No, he needs to stand out and *not* get behind nominee...although speaking at convention is borderline endorsing. http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/rnc-2016-ted-cruz-donald-trump-endorsement-225850
755758471312764928 2016-07-20 13:37:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @skeptic74 I use those features often. Rarely report.
755756069671018501 2016-07-20 13:27:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @pcarenza Similar to how I feel about Facebook news feed. FB has the right to tailor their content. They're a business.
755755202687410176 2016-07-20 13:24:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @pcarenza Like I said, I'm not a fan of him. I won't campaign for his release. It just highlights the already existing double standard here.
755754549353259008 2016-07-20 13:21:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @pcarenza I've had Trumpkins say I should be "placed in the ovens like the Jews".
755753936687079425 2016-07-20 13:19:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm not a fan of Milo. He's no conservative. That being said, the several Libs who've told me to "die in a fire" were never suspended. So...

755529776425799680 2016-07-19 22:28:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> We had actual conservatives with actual accomplishments and experience. And actually had a shot. But no. The GOP went full Obamamania-like.

755124814914920448 2016-07-18 19:39:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @d__el Your tweet doesn't make sense. I join in happily with @PolitiBunny and others as #NeverTrump.
755122064453955584 2016-07-18 19:28:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's funny how Trump/his minions believe they fought the Establishment when it's the Establishment propping up/celebrating him. #RNCinCLE
755113890028150785 2016-07-18 18:55:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @maxwellarm Exactly. It all went downhill when women like me got the right to vote.

754839804601303040 2016-07-17 00:46:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> There is absolutely NO excuse for either "side" to take the innocent life of another. The rationalizations have to stop. #BatonRouge

754718907647217664 2016-07-17 16:46:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @big_lue_kcmo Both sides need to acknowledge that violence against the innocent is unacceptable regardless of skin color or occupation.
754718652289601538 2016-07-17 16:45:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @big_lue_kcmo Then say that instead. Those cops in Baton Rouge didn't deserved to be gunned down because of another's action.
754707103969779712 2016-07-17 15:59:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I can say #AllLivesMatter and mourn when the innocent, black or white, badge or not, are killed. If you can't, you're part of the problem.

753998026679517185 2016-07-15 17:01:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> "Maturity" and "Trump" shouldn't be used in the same sentence.https://twitter.com/AP_Politics/status/753996230682877953
753985525531443201 2016-07-15 16:12:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Aw, thanks!! She's kind of weird, though. :)
753976446994046976 2016-07-15 15:36:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket Thank you so much, friend!! :)
753952359362035712 2016-07-15 14:00:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Dignity is calling out the evil that ended those innocent lives, not hiding behind cowardice. So no. I won't. https://twitter.com/textcenterapp/status/753951637648076800
753949871011311617 2016-07-15 13:50:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> To liberals, the #NiceAttack was an unfortunate truck crash. What was 9/11? Malfunctioning aircraft? Totes no big deal, guys.
753945256907853824 2016-07-15 13:32:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> There's only one religion that's evil to those like @voxdotcom. It's Christianity. Everything else is our lack of tolerance.
753927716676767744 2016-07-15 12:22:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> We need unapologetic solutions to terror, but I hope "thoughts & prayers" always go along with that. We're fighting evil. It's in the heart.

753739372025884672 2016-07-14 23:54:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No indication of that. He's a serial flip-flopper. He & his VP pick place party above principle. Proudly #NeverTrumphttps://twitter.com/jenniferglynn/status/753738613884465152
753737968049729537 2016-07-14 23:48:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @kcpasternak Yeah, no. Trump has done/will do more to damage conservatism than Hillary.
753737524196106240 2016-07-14 23:46:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Not being insensitive, but the planned announcement had/has nothing to do with the attack. There's more to this.https://twitter.com/WSJ/status/753735835271454720
753733466202660864 2016-07-14 23:30:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> We must pray when those with evil intent harm others. Never apologize for that. #PrayForNice
753721710956818432 2016-07-14 22:43:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Why? Because Pence who had endorsed a real conservative like Cruz chooses to ultimately place party above principle?https://twitter.com/IngrahamAngle/status/753639848301453312
753684145407139840 2016-07-14 20:14:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rover7_tony Yes, they are too high to vote for the (R) just because.
753683257703694336 2016-07-14 20:11:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rover7_tony Like I say every day: I'm voting for neither candidate. I don't place party above principle.
753679902935842816 2016-07-14 19:57:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JackLucasOrtega That's why neither nominee is getting my vote.
753678571986624517 2016-07-14 19:52:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump isn't your pro-life answer, folks. His past history + current flip-flopping & spineless nature don't equal a savior of the unborn.
753677860670439424 2016-07-14 19:49:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> He had 5 different abortion positions in a matter of days & believes in rape/incest exception. That's not pro-life.https://twitter.com/SBAList/status/753673979215347712
753673652961415168 2016-07-14 19:32:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The crowd yearning for Trump to be a pro-life warrior is at it again. It's wishful-thinking nonsense. Take the blinders off.
753673429170225156 2016-07-14 19:32:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> What commitments? That he wants to change GOP platform to include abortion in rape/incest & prefers laws stay same?https://twitter.com/SBAList/status/753663717888421892
753651996557578240 2016-07-14 18:06:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I didn't create a Clinton presidency. It's on the shoulders of those who have supported/will vote for Trump. Sad!https://twitter.com/LUCKYNH603/status/753650655093325825

753349509514616832 2016-07-13 22:04:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Leftist women always tell us they're the "strong" ones but are clearly incapable of using birth control or obtaining tampons on their own.

753318980731961344 2016-07-13 20:03:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Dear Trump,   Picking a VP more conservative than you (which isn't hard, since you're not) won't make me vote for you.   #NeverTrump
753318601944363009 2016-07-13 20:02:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AmberBinGA Desperate and delusional.

753274875603656704 2016-07-13 17:08:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Because there is still some "confusion", #NeverTrump goes on through election day. It isn't defeated by his nomination, FYI.
753261363519119361 2016-07-13 16:14:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's hilarious to see two grumpy-faced Leftists fight with each other.https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/753260247985164288

752981852982484993 2016-07-12 21:43:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> When announced, Trump's VP pick will do nothing to sway me over to his side. Because the *never* in #NeverTrump means...never.
752950248616624128 2016-07-12 19:38:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Missed the #DallasMemorial, but I can guess that George W. Bush trumped (sorry) Obama's remarks.

752550910874705920 2016-07-11 17:11:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Conservative politicians? Stay away from Trump. Don't align yourself with him at all. Not a good move.
752548488978673664 2016-07-11 17:01:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket Thank you. And I don't feel oppressed because of that statement.
752547890350862336 2016-07-11 16:59:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If true, Pence shouldn't be open to being Trump's VP. Says a lot about his party over principle motivations.https://twitter.com/IshYimini/status/748722241563656192

752538416663916544 2016-07-11 16:21:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JeffMcIrish And I've seen those on "our side" act just as foolish and threaten violence.
752538102703460352 2016-07-11 16:20:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PhantomQuasar Just don't walk into anything. I've heard that's been happening. :)
752538011917815808 2016-07-11 16:20:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JeffMcIrish Both sides need a dose of common sense.
752537892195565568 2016-07-11 16:19:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JeffMcIrish Nope, and I've seen plenty of BLM supporters condemn those actions.
752537218854580225 2016-07-11 16:17:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @largebill68 You're foolish to believe BLM is like KKK. But continue in your foolishness.
752537035609604096 2016-07-11 16:16:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Is it really so difficult to agree that most cops are good, but some aren't, and plenty of citizens aren't criminals, but some are?
752536247927726081 2016-07-11 16:13:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> .@largebill68 No, not close enough. William. BLM has legitimate grievances. Not all cops' actions are correct. They must be addressed.
752526969514913796 2016-07-11 15:36:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Agreed. On that note, I don't agree with anyone saying BLM is like the KKK. Sorry, not the same.https://twitter.com/ComfortablySmug/status/752526431876476928
752521686684168192 2016-07-11 15:15:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This #PokemonGO stuff is apparently a big deal...
752514278616403969 2016-07-11 14:45:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DrSueDVM @CalamityDC Exactly. But some truly believe he'd be a pro-life champion. Nope.

752323656487989249 2016-07-10 02:08:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @akneader Incredibly so. Much worse than what they claim from the opposite sex.
752320478396678144 2016-07-10 01:55:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @LilMissRightie  You are my favorite!
752319406177447936 2016-07-10 01:51:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Despite what feminists say, women still like having the door held open and receiving compliments. Those are not oppressive, vile things.
752307192217337856 2016-07-10 01:03:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yeah, so? Oh, I'm sorry. You probably think this is some sort of oppression. #AmericanFeminismhttps://twitter.com/BFischerMartin/status/752288972605313024

752248646280814592 2016-07-10 21:10:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> There are violent-leaning idiots on both sides...
752248252028837889 2016-07-10 21:08:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I don't follow you and wasn't going to. I don't like people who resort to violence no matter what side they're on. https://twitter.com/armyjon/status/752247843809730560
752247901007515648 2016-07-10 21:07:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> .@armyjon She didn't threaten me. You threatened her.
752247642835525632 2016-07-10 21:06:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> .@armyjon That's great. Still no excuse for your threatening response. If you can't handle Twitter, then log off.
752246423790481408 2016-07-10 21:01:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> So you threaten violence? That's no better than them.
752244169947639808 2016-07-10 20:52:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Wow. That kind of idiotic response isn't needed either, Jon.
752242805569908736 2016-07-10 20:47:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Difficult to have honest dialogue with those who expect others to give them monetary compensation in the form of reparations.
752241780310077440 2016-07-10 20:43:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You were not a slave. I was not a slave owner. So that's a no.https://twitter.com/fridacashflow/status/752241091869601794
752240991734755330 2016-07-10 20:40:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes, all lives matter. Reparations? That's absolute nonsense.https://twitter.com/fridacashflow/status/752239425325707264

752182999513501696 2016-07-10 16:49:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump supporters are no different than emotional Obama supporters from 2008. Same "but he'll save us!" mentality with not much thought.
752181503036121088 2016-07-10 16:43:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Stop acting foolish and pinning your pro-life hopes on Trump. He doesn't represent the unborn.https://twitter.com/ThinkThroughIt/status/752180202134867968
752180987782656000 2016-07-10 16:41:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You fail to understand the damage he's done to the movement. Not to mention his disinterest in changing laws.https://twitter.com/ThinkThroughIt/status/752178699357724672
752174529460469764 2016-07-10 16:15:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> So I'm required to give up my principles because others abandoned theirs long ago? No thanks.https://twitter.com/h60usn/status/752170967192010752

752158160140529664 2016-07-10 15:10:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ThinkThroughIt @mickeysooner Exactly. The (R) next to his name certainly doesn't mean conservatism.
752147070186885120 2016-07-10 14:26:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You feel comfortable voting for a man who praises @PPact & doesn't think abortion laws should be changed. I don't.https://twitter.com/ThinkThroughIt/status/752145720245760001
752143867282067456 2016-07-10 14:14:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JeffMcIrish I don't consider him that, either. But plenty of brainwashed Republicans do.
752142382423011328 2016-07-10 14:08:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Let's go, Murray. #Wimbledon
752141196194095104 2016-07-10 14:03:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I don't vote for lesser of two evils. Sorry. And Trump is in no way a pro-life warrior. At all.https://twitter.com/ThinkThroughIt/status/752139893325729792
752124697941278720 2016-07-10 12:57:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> We had every chance to nominate an actual conservative capable of winning, but Trump was chosen. That's not on me.https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/752043667398004736
752010196906545156 2016-07-09 05:22:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Some calling #Deray the new MLK. I mean, let's just get completely carried away here. Wow.
751972905827889152 2016-07-09 02:54:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> What was that?? "...black women are more than 5 times as likely as white women to have an abortion."https://twitter.com/PPact/status/751863283896815616
751972210290618368 2016-07-09 02:52:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The pro-aborts are obsessed with using themselves as an example of "caring" about the black community this week. Ugh.
751900864672100360 2016-07-09 22:08:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> For any sort of progress, both the Left AND Right must address the racism among their own. (Not) sorry if that's offensive to you.
751873654242349056 2016-07-09 20:20:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Being black and unborn is a death sentence for far too many. Your community can change that.https://twitter.com/PPBlackComm/status/751045382260420608

751811887533174785 2016-07-09 16:14:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No, you stated "make your own life matter". Hint: everyone's already does.https://twitter.com/SteveTrubilla/status/751810126730891265
751809658495635456 2016-07-09 16:06:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @LilMissRightie Aw, thanks! 
751809568787791872 2016-07-09 16:05:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Nope. Each individual's life matters whether they're employed or not or carry around a bad attitude. #groundbreakinghttps://twitter.com/SteveTrubilla/status/751809156571684864
751807745406435328 2016-07-09 15:58:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Our discussions about life's worth must include any skin color, career, sexual orientation, or developmental stage (aka the unborn). Period.

751520490733395969 2016-07-08 20:57:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Seriously, everyone needs to go to their timeout chair.
751517382494003201 2016-07-08 20:44:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket Sigh. It's never-ending.

751506482349375488 2016-07-08 20:01:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> What gets me are those who claim incidents of gun violence, whomever they're directed at, are a hoax. I know reality is hard, but grow up.
751476908806647808 2016-07-08 18:03:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket @Artist_Angie @JeffMcIrish   So. Great.
751472891909120000 2016-07-08 17:47:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Dallas shooter motivated by "righteous" anger? Shut up. He pulled the trigger and ended lives. He made a choice. He was a coward.
751464219657273344 2016-07-08 17:13:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> People keep sharing this. It's from June 2015. Be observant & focus on the NOW, mmkay? There's enough going on. https://twitter.com/RoarkHoward_/status/751289516116377600

751430793273180160 2016-07-08 15:00:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Really, though, our society teaches that life doesn't matter from day one. Senseless killing is the result of that teaching.
751422851933241345 2016-07-08 14:29:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Artist_Angie Best tweet I've seen about all of this horror. Spot-on.
751385625887117313 2016-07-08 12:01:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> So many hot takes flying around. You can & should mourn the loss of innocent life whenever it occurs. If any lives matter then all lives do.
751384434520326144 2016-07-08 11:56:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Might want to look up Dylan Noble. I'm sure he was scared before he was shot and killed during a traffic stop.https://twitter.com/korndiddy/status/751226946965549056
751298516329361409 2016-07-07 06:14:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @paytonjpickett Obviously there is racial tension right now, but don't use a year old article about an old incident.

751170269457375232 2016-07-07 21:45:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> People wanting Ivanka Trump for VP? Because - and this is the 1st part of the sentence - she's beautiful? Ok...not a qualification.
751164410467581952 2016-07-07 21:22:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> That moment when someone who labels themselves "alt-right anti-cuck", and whose first tweet is a racist one, starts following you. #eyeroll
751149188650504192 2016-07-07 20:21:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @SheilaJLol I don't care. He needs to stay away from Trump and that trainwreck. It's disappointing. @Tamaraw68415067

751144647255265280 2016-07-07 20:03:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I think it's a bad idea for him to speak at the convention. He's essentially endorsing the actual nominee. #stayawayhttps://twitter.com/RedState/status/751144410520379393

750764783134269441 2016-07-06 18:54:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ChelieinTX Speaking at the convention is essentially supporting the nominee. Bad move. He can get his message across another way.

750763371818024960 2016-07-06 18:48:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ChelieinTX It absolutely tarnishes his brand for 2020 if he in any way supports Trump in 2016. But that's my opinion.
750762494751305728 2016-07-06 18:45:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I sure hope there aren't any negotiations re speaking. He needs to stay away from toxic Trump.

750736750448967680 2016-07-06 17:02:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PhantomQuasar Trump's only consistency is his inconsistency. I won't support that. @SageAntone
750736568588132352 2016-07-06 17:02:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PhantomQuasar Exactly. That is really, really difficult for too many to understand. @PPact @SageAntone
750735793883344896 2016-07-06 16:58:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PPact @PhantomQuasar Currently he's praised @Ppact and doesn't think abortion laws should be changed. Ooh, but he identifies!! Lol. @SageAntone
750734698301820928 2016-07-06 16:54:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This election cycle has resulted in a looooong "mute" list.

750728641814859776 2016-07-06 16:30:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Except he praises @PPact and doesn't think abortion laws should be changed. Like I've said, he will not get my vote. https://twitter.com/SageAntone/status/750726330011049984

749796247003885568 2016-07-03 02:45:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Legal homicide called abortion has been a reality since 1973. That should never cause us to abandon our fight for the unborn.

747105392455389185 2016-06-26 16:33:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> A Trump White House would do more to damage the cause of conservatism than a Clinton one. We can recover from the latter. #NeverTrump

739182007125565440 2016-06-04 19:48:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's simple. The "never" in #NeverTrump means I will never support him. Deal with it, unfollow me, mute me, block me. I really don't care.
739181522347950082 2016-06-04 19:46:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DeLoachJW @Raycunn Wrong! Those supporting Trump will have elected Hillary. I wash my hands of it.

739144364635639810 2016-06-04 17:18:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I support neither. And my strong pro-life position is quite evident by my tweets and writing.https://twitter.com/KH12_Keyhole/status/739140927734747137

738053867640913920 2016-06-01 17:05:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This article says women who commit crimes should be treated more fairly than men.

738010076527624194 2016-06-01 14:11:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And 3,000 unborn of all colors are murdered each day. Let me know when that bothers you, Sally.https://twitter.com/sallykohn/status/737999474929369089

737810314348105728 2016-05-31 00:57:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @scottlincicome Now that's funny. @CNBCnow
737808244144496640 2016-05-31 00:49:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Surely you're not talking about those who consider themselves "tolerant", right? :)
737808036467736576 2016-05-31 00:48:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Here's what I know for sure: I'm still solidly #NeverTrump and #NeverHillary. That won't change at all.
737806566783614976 2016-05-31 00:42:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Disagreement is not akin to hate. Difficult concept for some.
737804518407168000 2016-05-31 00:34:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @maxwellarm Neal is my favorite Twitter curmudgeon.
737800916833861638 2016-05-31 00:20:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Here's already a good argument *against* David French. Speaking well of Gary Johnson. Heh.https://twitter.com/FriedrichHayek/status/737799449037012992

737799886951813120 2016-05-31 00:16:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm #NeverTrump, but sorry, you're delusional.
737798294634692608 2016-05-31 00:09:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And David French, with zero name recognition, financial backing, or organization will? Mmkay. 
737797203301916673 2016-05-31 00:05:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> My write-in choices, both former candidates, have a better shot than French.
737795540319121408 2016-05-31 23:58:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Rufus_GB I am planning on writing in a name anyway. This makes little difference.
737794749172682752 2016-05-31 23:55:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I enjoy reading David French's writing, but he won't get anywhere near being president or even a serious contender. That's just the truth.

736047838623354880 2016-05-26 04:14:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MCastleberry03 That's no reason to support Trump.
736047622096596993 2016-05-26 04:13:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Putting party above principle is a choice.
736047489938251776 2016-05-26 04:12:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's so frustrating when anyone acts like their current/former choice for president is/was without blemish. They all have flaws.
736047069970980865 2016-05-26 04:11:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Shockingly enough, they're all politicians. Both Walker and Rubio disapponted me, and they were my top two choices.

731314833904173057 2016-05-13 02:46:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JohnLombo Haha. Well of course.
731313715618844679 2016-05-13 02:42:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Clearly many are confused as to what #NeverTrump means, although it's *kinda* self-explanatory.

731162141034582016 2016-05-13 16:40:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> In light of transgender discussion, esp involving children, this is a MUST read. http://lindsayleighbentley.com/2014/06/30/i-am-ryland-the-story-of-a-male-identifying-little-girl-who-didnt-transition/
731159008594305024 2016-05-13 16:27:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If elementary school kids believe they are transgender, it's because crap parents are projecting onto kids. Period.
731154987657662464 2016-05-13 16:11:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Again, it's not transgender individuals I'm worried about. It's non-transgender pervs using the relaxed rules to prey on others.

730959589466742785 2016-05-12 03:15:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The transgender bathroom issue is not the new civil rights, contrary to what the Left tells you.

730814818966364160 2016-05-12 17:40:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> That the unborn child might feel no pain does NOT makes its destruction more palatable.https://twitter.com/Atrotic/status/730814367332110337
730813763557855233 2016-05-12 17:35:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> People that don't believe life begins at conception will not be bothered by anything which takes place from that point until birth.
730813319183917056 2016-05-12 17:34:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> ...and some say the new Utah bill requiring painkillers for unborn will change people's minds regarding abortion.https://twitter.com/KWZiggybakagain/status/730799773268226049

730794683610206213 2016-05-12 16:20:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I wish Utah had joined 12 other states & passed late-term abortion ban instead of this one requiring painkillers. The unborn will STILL die.
730790074485346304 2016-05-12 16:01:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> We're not nearly as aggressive on right things as the Left is on wrong things. We cower too often.

730565520257392640 2016-05-11 01:09:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This also applies to Rubio and Cruz supporters.
730561020817768449 2016-05-11 00:51:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> People are incapable of accepting criticism of their candidate...EVEN if you use said candidate's own words to back everything up.
730510492381396992 2016-05-11 21:30:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @jpwilloughby And Cruz may well do the same. It would also apply to him if so.

730508159639539712 2016-05-11 21:21:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I had favorite candidates, too. But don't act like any of them are infallible. They're ALL politicians. It shouldn't surprise you.
730507794739286016 2016-05-11 21:20:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @aaron_rs @rmom65 Then you're dismissing the truth because you like Rubio. He's selling out.

730503995433816065 2016-05-11 21:04:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This is absolutely correct. And Rubio was my choice. If Cruz does the same, it will apply to him, too.https://twitter.com/JayCaruso/status/730490291984183296
730501784809123840 2016-05-11 20:56:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Absolutely incorrect. His personal views are with those exceptions, but he thinks legislation should NOT be changed.
730499805210890242 2016-05-11 20:48:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Furthermore, he believes abortion legislation should stay as it is. He is a coward.
730499704337895424 2016-05-11 20:47:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> So? He says they do "good things". That's destructive to the pro-life cause.
730494181941121025 2016-05-11 20:25:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump *should* feel comfortable with each other, though. They both think Planned Parenthood does good things.
730491962768371714 2016-05-11 20:17:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Well, they're both disrespectful to women and are a poor voice for females in the electorate.https://twitter.com/dcexaminer/status/730486582021640192

730433737951973376 2016-05-11 16:25:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm thankful for pro-life state legislators who chip away at our comfortable culture of death through legislation. One step at a time.
730433209541001216 2016-05-11 16:23:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Reaction from pro-aborts bothered by new Utah law requiring painkillers be given to unborn: "But it's hard on the abortionists!!"
730217879803731970 2016-05-10 02:08:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I highly recommend the documentary "Twice Born: Special Delivery Unit". It's a fascinating look at fetal surgery.

730198695615074304 2016-05-10 00:51:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> We live in a society where the unborn aren't granted the right to LIFE, but we're concerned about public bathroom rules. #priorities

730189763916013568 2016-05-10 00:16:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I see Andrea Tantaros finally recognized my lack of support for Trump...and unfollowed me. #winning

730145821564489728 2016-05-10 21:21:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I hope Cruz officially comes out against Trump as the presumptive nominee. If not, it would be very disappointing.
730145460351062016 2016-05-10 21:20:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Say what you want about Jeb Bush & Lindsey Graham, but they're the only former candidates officially NOT supporting Trump. Good.

728312387837767680 2016-05-05 19:56:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @_President_Lane Heh. Nope. The ones responsible for electing Hillary are those supporting Trump, who will lose to her.

728043993972523013 2016-05-04 02:09:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Phalen_K Sorry, but the right to life, and its beginnings at conception, are absolute, despite disagreement.
728043751155863552 2016-05-04 02:08:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Sigh. Jindal, Rubio, Haley. Who is next? So disappointing.
728043321294196738 2016-05-04 02:07:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Hector_CMS Thanks!
728043127865520129 2016-05-04 02:06:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> That's disappointing. Same goes for ANY politician who places party above principle and supports Trump as nominee.https://twitter.com/ReutersPolitics/status/727965770630746112
728042195639472129 2016-05-04 02:02:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Phalen_K Legality doesn't equal morality. There are things which earthly laws don't define. The worth of life, for one.

728040470937542657 2016-05-04 01:55:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @doublespeak15 No, his hands-off approach is too similar to Trump's. Weak.
728040225520427009 2016-05-04 01:54:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Phalen_K But by saying we shouldn't legislate either way (which two of the candidates do), we're wasting many opportunities. It's sad.

728038748009705473 2016-05-04 01:48:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @jvscoundrel One would think that.
728038667936247809 2016-05-04 01:48:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You *can* be pro-woman and pro-baby, Libertarians. It seems you're unaware of this whole approach to protecting both.
728038189944999936 2016-05-04 01:46:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It always gets me that among Libertarians, so many are pro-choice or unconcerned about rights of the unborn. That's moral cowardice.

727166245439725569 2016-05-02 16:01:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I don't think an (R) nominee should be supported at all if he is anti-everything conservatives claim they support. #NeverTrump

727163167365849088 2016-05-02 15:49:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Rubio announcing he would support Trump if nominee is disappointing. If Cruz isn't the nominee, I hope he absolutely refuses to do that.

726147516648067074 2016-04-29 20:33:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The continuing fight for trans "rights" is awfully absurd when the unborn are denied the basic right to LIFE. Don't get me started.

725019582688194560 2016-04-26 17:51:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The absurdity of people attempting to compare racist bathroom segregation of the 60s with transgender bathroom issues now. Just...wow.

724993894069506049 2016-04-26 16:09:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'd rather not win the White House while supporting a true conservative like Cruz, than win with a non-conservative like Trump.
724993431240585217 2016-04-26 16:07:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @paytonjpickett He doesn't go after Hillary. Not with any substance.

723021058933166080 2016-04-20 05:30:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Goodnight, Twitter. 
723020265756712960 2016-04-20 05:27:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @hboulware I disagree, but I respect you and your opinion. @Cgerm1 @Seanbeandood @danchappell
723019408088637440 2016-04-20 05:23:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @hboulware I believe people struggle with it, but surgery isn't the answer. Problem remains. @Cgerm1 @Seanbeandood @danchappell
723018787616894976 2016-04-20 05:21:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @hboulware Yeah, it kind of is. It's a mental illness that shouldn't be encouraged. @Cgerm1 @Seanbeandood @danchappell
723018468619071488 2016-04-20 05:20:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @hboulware I don't support the transgender delusion nor do I cheer it on. @Cgerm1 @Seanbeandood @danchappell
723018224527413248 2016-04-20 05:19:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @hboulware Surgical additions or subtractions do not a male or female make. It's all very sad. @Cgerm1 @Seanbeandood @danchappell
723017805520625664 2016-04-20 05:17:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Cgerm1 Exactly. It encourages the mental illness instead of addresses it. @hboulware @Seanbeandood @danchappell
723014231449325568 2016-04-20 05:03:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> That being said, I don't encourage or support transgenderism. It's a mental delusion, and I will not cheer it on.
723013233901223936 2016-04-20 04:59:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Seanbeandood Exactly.
723012348764667904 2016-04-20 04:55:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @STXJoy4 Agreed. We're fixated on this and real crises exist.
723011824019496960 2016-04-20 04:53:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @STXJoy4 The fact that there are already individuals capitalizing on it in order to assault others means it does matter & will continue to.
723010165709090817 2016-04-20 04:47:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> My worry? The non-transgender guy who can get away with entering the women's bathroom and committing assault because of our relaxed rules.
723008835665965056 2016-04-20 04:41:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Want a third one, @danchappell? Here you go: http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Man-Dressed-as-Woman-Arrested-for-Spying-Into-Mall-Bathroom-Stall-Police-Say-351232041.html https://twitter.com/Seanbeandood/status/723006744666873857
723008157782544384 2016-04-20 04:39:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Seanbeandood @danchappell Totally. All about feelings and not facts.
723007845545959428 2016-04-20 04:37:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Here's another one, Dan: http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/17/man-strips-in-womens-restroom-says-new-transgender-rules-make-it-totally-legal/ https://twitter.com/danchappell/status/723006214943084545
723007376014618624 2016-04-20 04:36:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Seanbeandood Dan really doesn't get it, or doesn't care. Not sure which yet.  @danchappell
723007187732279296 2016-04-20 04:35:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Do you have any sense? We're talking about non-transgender people using such lax rules to assault others. https://twitter.com/danchappell/status/723006728493637632
723006279187345408 2016-04-20 04:31:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ChrissySkate Obviously that kind of scenario applies to both bathrooms.
723005826642878464 2016-04-20 04:29:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You should really pay attention to headlines, Dan. I have more. http://kdwn.com/2016/04/10/california-man-dressed-as-woman-busted-for-videoing-in-womens-bathroom/ https://twitter.com/danchappell/status/722992678007238657

722897340965609472 2016-04-20 21:18:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Let's recap: - It's horrible to tell people which bathroom to use.  - Now the Left is asking who Obama should replace on currency.  Sigh.
722894917983318016 2016-04-20 21:09:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Sigh. They subscribe to never-ending victimhood. So embarrassing for womankind.

722848073316061184 2016-04-20 18:03:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> As @MupptLuv rightly said, the bathroom drama & gender issues are NOT a real crisis. We need to be shaken out of complacency.

722163720848338944 2016-04-18 20:43:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This is "equality"? If women want to be included, they should meet all requirements. If not, kick them OUT.https://twitter.com/MCIWPendletonCA/status/722150515862208515

722119458790252546 2016-04-18 17:47:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trumpidians should be more concerned about their candidate's lack of substance than laughably trying to connect Rafael Cruz to JFK's death.

721543580813238272 2016-04-16 03:39:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray I eventually warm up and get chatty, but at first I struggle. I have to work at it.

721542151147032576 2016-04-16 03:33:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Family gatherings are fine, but social events where I know no one? I'm horribly shy/bored. They're the worst.
721539030685499392 2016-04-16 03:21:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray It's difficult being the coolest in the room.

721439661789487104 2016-04-16 20:46:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> There are 6 1/2 more months of this election cycle, and if it's not President Cruz in the end, we'll have an apocalypse after that.

721087776540778497 2016-04-15 21:28:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Discussing anything but rape as "forced pregnancy" is absurd. Ladies, you're not Mary, mother of Jesus. Your positive test isn't a surprise.

720797341662474240 2016-04-14 02:14:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Not at all! It's a tough issue, and sometimes uncomfortable to discuss. I'm passionate, but not angry. :)
720796891718500352 2016-04-14 02:12:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray I hear you, but "choice" involves the destruction of one and "life" supports wholeness for both. The decision becomes clear.
720796420861726720 2016-04-14 02:10:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @lrc328 They're so amusing!
720796200262377472 2016-04-14 02:09:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray It is not a religious issue at all. Science confirms life begins at conception.
720795872947269632 2016-04-14 02:08:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray The blueprint that you need to be *you* IS present at conception. Why discriminate based on location and developmental stage?
720795212075937793 2016-04-14 02:05:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray How are you wrestling with it? Frankly, it's black and white.

720791901339852801 2016-04-14 01:52:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Agreed
720791500175622144 2016-04-14 01:50:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> As a biracial black, you support the preying upon of your community through legal homicide. You're a fool. https://twitter.com/RBraceySherman/status/720791053348036608

720788489609027585 2016-04-14 01:39:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Psst.   Abortion isn't healthcare, and by the way, healthcare isn't a "right".
720788081553588225 2016-04-14 01:37:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> How sad and selfish, and you now promote it with glee. I happily fight against bloodthirsty harpies like you. https://twitter.com/RBraceySherman/status/720787700652093441

719921400627245056 2016-04-12 16:13:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @NetDep911 The Left uses that label to distinguish between transgender and non-transgender. Really.
719918586974859264 2016-04-12 16:02:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @dixlexus I stick to what I've said. There is no truth to trans anything. You can *feel* one way, but that doesn't change biological fact.
719904631942488064 2016-04-12 15:06:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @jaycartierhoe Nope. Same with transgender. Feeling like a man or women doesn't make you one. That was my point, bruh.
719900660548902912 2016-04-12 14:51:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I was informed that because I'm a cis white woman, that means I can't have an opinion. Oh, these kids.

719882072903577600 2016-04-12 13:37:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @brandan0 Then the same thing applies to the transgender community, because DNA is stubborn.

717555870016618496 2016-04-05 03:33:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> When "The Establishment" has come to mean anyone against Trump (who is a liberal, btw), it holds meaning no longer. Thanks.

717551216339861506 2016-04-05 03:15:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> My favorite thing about Cruz winning, besides the actual win, is when Trumpidians start shouting "voter fraud!!" Too predictable.

716753261282222080 2016-04-03 22:24:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's beyond the point where anyone who has conservative principles should be supporting Trump. If you still are, you're not a conservative.
716744533006880769 2016-04-03 21:49:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump, unlike any other politician, always gets a pass when he says something...then backtracks hours or days later. #lolnothingmatters

716677044529143808 2016-04-03 17:21:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hey, at least Hillary and Trump will feel comfortable with each other. Both believe that abortion laws should stay the same.

715281757009002497 2016-03-30 20:57:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @trevinlovett @prageru Either we believe life begins at conception and abortion is wrong from then on, or not. There's no middle ground.
715280531978592256 2016-03-30 20:52:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @trevinlovett I agree wholeheartedly with the arguments in the video. @prageru

715266997668429824 2016-03-30 19:58:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> We must deal with abortion by:  1. Sharing truth 2. Showing compassion 3. Providing pro-woman, pro-baby help  Trump can't grasp this.
715266168911736832 2016-03-30 19:55:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump praised @PPact. Now he says women who have abortions should be punished. He's tone deaf, nonsensical, and incapable of leading.

715218904843481088 2016-03-30 16:47:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No, I'm not concerned about your feelings when you refuse the facts of life's beginnings, and support murder of the unborn. Nope.
715217870020612097 2016-03-30 16:43:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm sorry. You refuse to recognize the worth of unborn life at conception. You're weak...and a fool.https://twitter.com/JohnLaprise/status/715216763969937409

715195055624073216 2016-03-30 15:12:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> As stated previously, John. You are weak. You refuse that science deems the life an individual at conception.https://twitter.com/JohnLaprise/status/715194490538041344

714971218491916289 2016-03-29 00:23:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> There is no contest. Cruz is the only candidate worth supporting. Trump is a temperamental juvenile who has no business running the country.

713828648516591616 2016-03-26 20:43:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Atheists, why mock another's faith? It shows more insecurity in your set of beliefs than flaws in theirs. #EasterWeekend
713799551069491201 2016-03-26 18:47:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AndreaNRuth @lrc328 Love me some Jimmy Stewart!

713771856218554368 2016-03-26 16:57:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RightWingIsland This has everything to do with his real, proven history of insulting, demeaning behavior toward women.  @Taxpayers1234

713729708089872384 2016-03-26 14:09:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Good morning! 
713589454183800832 2016-03-25 04:52:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @SuperAaronBurr I've been talking about how Peeps are disgusting.

713580006002278401 2016-03-25 04:15:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No thanks. I don't vote for liberals, whether they are named Hillary or Trump.https://twitter.com/JeffWimer2/status/713563076960919552

713516174567415810 2016-03-25 00:01:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> On a lighter note, Peeps marshmallows are the worst. They taste like sadness and food coloring.
713473874042564609 2016-03-25 21:13:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm (not) sorry. I won't unify around Trump and his toxic movement. I won't "get in line" at all. I don't care if he's the GOP nominee.
713394851937652736 2016-03-25 15:59:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Enjoying a long weekend spent with family.

713333908729933824 2016-03-25 11:57:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If you set alarm to wake up, it's difficult to wake up. When you don't have to set alarm, you wake up when alarm usually goes off. Always.
713205204569600000 2016-03-24 03:25:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @KLNorvell Refer to the first part of your tweet.
713204088729546753 2016-03-24 03:21:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The National Enquirer is apparently gospel truth to the Trumpkins. Why am I not surprised? https://twitter.com/secondsunrising/status/713203516370776065

713198158839349249 2016-03-24 02:57:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Glad that pro-life governors such as Walker, Bevin, and Pence are making waves in their respective states. I love seeing the Left squirm.

713078173911687168 2016-03-24 19:00:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PastorFrisbie Whaaat? @WomenintheWorld
713070085783601155 2016-03-24 18:28:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AndreaNRuth Yes. It's so ridiculous. We have said these things for a long time, and they just *now* discover it? Wow.
713069689606430720 2016-03-24 18:27:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And before American feminists start saying women are discouraged from pursuing certain careers...  NO, we're not. #personalchoices
713069246348148737 2016-03-24 18:25:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes, we know.

713031930581762048 2016-03-24 15:57:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @trevinlovett No. It was an ad by a separate Super PAC. Cruz had nothing to do with it. @tedcruz
713027438171856896 2016-03-24 15:39:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket Win-win! @tedcruz

712979535088771072 2016-03-24 12:29:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Donald Trump is living proof that money doesn't buy class.
712858723702714372 2016-03-23 04:28:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump puts much more effort into insulting others than he does explaining his policy positions. But sure, lead the country. #NeverTrump
712856928913899521 2016-03-23 04:21:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump is a vile human being. I look forward to never casting a vote for him.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/712850174838771712
712824534248923136 2016-03-23 02:13:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Bad news: he or she who must not be named will (probably) win.https://twitter.com/BiasedGirl/status/712823619785793537
712823608213639168 2016-03-23 02:09:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> But that aside, please talk about the issues and share your substantive plans for our future. Difficult for some...
712823270496735233 2016-03-23 02:08:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And for the record, ridiculing the private depression of a candidate's wife is far, far worse than showing the modeling pics of one.
712822711517626368 2016-03-23 02:05:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @LilMissRightie Yeah, I was getting so bored.  @DailyCaller
712822393744523269 2016-03-23 02:04:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I really don't care if Cruz did/didn't disavow an ad, his campaign had nothing to do with, which used public modeling pics of Melania.

712678990872514561 2016-03-23 16:34:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I missed the part in life where disagreeing with someone politically should result in death threats against them. So many idiots out there.
712678619647197184 2016-03-23 16:33:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Death threats shouldn't be tolerated. Also, you have Trump supporter & common sense in your bio. Remove the latter.https://twitter.com/micah_micahk/status/712616226371948544
712661781693526016 2016-03-23 15:26:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @cheyneyr I support a religious objection. Employers shouldn't have to be forced to cover it.
712656791050579968 2016-03-23 15:06:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rightlydivide It's so simple, and so scientific, isn't it? Unbelievable that there are people like @Sheppard250.

712651587534118913 2016-03-23 14:45:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Sheppard250 Then you're both unintelligent and uncaring. Disastrous combination, kid. ;)
712650721255170048 2016-03-23 14:42:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Matthew, a proud member of bro-choice, is probably mad that he'd have to pay child support.https://twitter.com/Sheppard250/status/712649327890575361
712645022089392128 2016-03-23 14:19:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @presjpolk That's also helpful. :)
712644893181657088 2016-03-23 14:19:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The life & death rights of the unborn child are greater than the right of comfort for the female. Period.https://twitter.com/Sheppard250/status/712641800276717570
712640493755244549 2016-03-23 14:01:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You want others to pay for your BC, yet we have no say when you want to murder the child inside your womb? I don't think so. #HandsOffMyBC
712639878689894400 2016-03-23 13:59:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And it's not my responsibility, nor anyone else's, to pay for your "correct" form, Jamie.https://twitter.com/mieha_/status/712639595452751873
712638349736017921 2016-03-23 13:53:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The #HandsOffMyBC chicks are seemingly unaware that many forms of contraception are both inexpensive & widely available. #FundYourOwnUterus

712396382829731841 2016-03-22 21:51:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes, black lives matter, but that talking point would hold more weight if those in BLM would address that abortion is highest among blacks.
712377581534908417 2016-03-22 20:37:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PhantomQuasar No, it's a dude (of any age) thing.
712375667472658432 2016-03-22 20:29:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PhantomQuasar Haha. No one is asking, I just think that's a very middle age thing to do. :)

712293132797403136 2016-03-22 15:01:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Evil exists within the hearts of men and women. This is a flawed, fallen world. Why ridicule those who offer prayers at such a time?

709449799788060672 2016-03-14 18:43:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump attracts those like himself: the emotional, illogical, and superficial. Like Joe.  https://twitter.com/Stordoor/status/709445628850348032

709441609583169536 2016-03-14 18:10:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I wrote yesterday that Donald disrespects women. Several disagreed with me, but it's not difficult to find proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkSRJSUY0vs&feature=youtu.be&app=desktop

708673646248783872 2016-03-12 15:18:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump will never receive my vote, even if he is the nominee. He's shown himself to be a morally repugnant disaster. #NeverTrump

708531937560936449 2016-03-11 05:55:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It appears that Trump supporters believe disagreeing with them is akin to destroying their 1A rights. More similarities to Obamamania...
708486014755606529 2016-03-11 02:53:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You know what? Support Trump all you want. Also, protest Trump all you want. Isn't freedom grand? Just don't be stupid and use violence.

708425471852158978 2016-03-11 22:52:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Since those in D.C. don't accomplish the task of protecting the unborn, legislators at the state level do. Bravo to them!
708414026741587968 2016-03-11 22:07:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The Trump camp's denial of @MichelleFields' substantiated claim is just more proof that they're reckless, thoughtless bullies.

706329639443165184 2016-03-05 04:04:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Wild evening filled with Netflix and cleaning out a closet. Wild, I tell you.
706324678856597504 2016-03-05 03:45:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Oh no. Because I'm not a Trump supporter.https://twitter.com/mattw13334/status/706321927531470848
706323885604610049 2016-03-05 03:41:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Peej4262 I do that quite a bit. :)
706323755442765824 2016-03-05 03:41:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Whoa. Did not expect that at all. #HouseOfCardsSeason4
706308868725460992 2016-03-05 02:42:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Thanks! But I think I got you zero followers. @GingyNorth
706307943512330241 2016-03-05 02:38:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @miscRaymer How about shut your face? (I'm kidding.) @torriangray
706307438807482368 2016-03-05 02:36:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @miscRaymer No. @torriangray

706290755099369472 2016-03-05 01:30:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BethRS62 It's a great site. I share it a lot. @PolitiBunny
706286709319864321 2016-03-05 01:14:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Don't tell me that Planned Parenthood is a health organization when they vacuum out the unborn from wombs in the room right next to you.
706286318947606528 2016-03-05 01:12:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I haven't always had health insurance, but I still never went to Planned Parenthood. You CAN get affordable care elsewhere.
706285758517284864 2016-03-05 01:10:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The majority of women, from all economic backgrounds, go to clinics which don't also kill & receive affordable care.https://twitter.com/cerrabella/status/706285140675162112

706270792795947008 2016-03-05 00:10:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Gormogons @torriangray Let us be cheerful for once, GP. ;) Don't steal our joy.
706269199279202305 2016-03-05 00:04:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I choose to believe that, unfortunately, there are many Trump cult fans. I also choose to believe many others aren't. This explains Kansas.
706268753378615296 2016-03-05 00:02:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @danmccarvel For real. They're all like "it was rigged!!!" Sure.
706268343926460416 2016-03-05 00:01:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @_David_Edward Agreed.

706265368331952128 2016-03-05 23:49:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm LOLing at the Trump fans who are conspiracy theorists and don't believe Cruz actually won Kansas. L. O. L.
706257235916234752 2016-03-05 23:17:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AmericasBelleXO "Other" beat Carson. Heh.

706243708744818688 2016-03-05 22:23:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Maybe people in Kansas are supporting #Cruz because his campaign knows how to spell Kansas? ;)
706243547507384320 2016-03-05 22:22:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MadameAmerica Looking good in Kansas and Maine for Cruz.
706242827659964417 2016-03-05 22:19:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Seriously, go #Cruz.

706237446242041856 2016-03-05 21:58:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> In America, with such an uphill battle for the pro-life cause, it is both destructive & disheartening when any (R) candidate praises @PPact.
706222505053315076 2016-03-05 20:59:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> There's no reason to keep from supporting Cruz if he and Trump are the final two (R) candidates. There's every reason to not support Trump.
706220705747222528 2016-03-05 20:51:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @jcampbell46549 Yes. Like Jerry Falwell, Jr.

706213878846382080 2016-03-05 20:24:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BlazerMc88 Thanks! Exciting for someone with stick straight hair. Haha.

706142071602733056 2016-03-05 15:39:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes we have. It was called "hope & change", and it was just as superficial as this one.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/706127055285391361
706135249839890433 2016-03-05 15:12:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Good morning! 
705978387186192384 2016-03-04 04:48:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Before #NationalGrammarDay concludes, just a reminder that there's a difference between your/you're and their/there/they're. Choose wisely.
705975933577142273 2016-03-04 04:39:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> How could this be your conclusion??https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/705922218312785920
705968864601968640 2016-03-04 04:11:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes, Americans are tired and fed up. Still no reason to choose Trump as a remedy to it all.

705922247047819264 2016-03-04 01:05:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rottencoreblog It helps to have little people in your phone in the app called Twitter.
705922001513283584 2016-03-04 01:04:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rottencoreblog

705887074805800960 2016-03-04 22:46:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I don't deny @RealBenCarson has accomplished a lot in his life. He still should have dropped out of the presidential race much sooner.
705859900346335232 2016-03-04 20:58:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If I see a spider and react within about 4 seconds of seeing it, I can kill it. But if it goes beyond those 4 seconds, I freeze up.
705846898633121796 2016-03-04 20:06:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The fight for unborn life is NEVER over. Sit on the sidelines since you're apathetic. Others will do the work.  https://twitter.com/retepger/status/705846282175156224
705845618904846337 2016-03-04 20:01:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Being pro-life isn't the *only* issue, but if you compromise on that foundation, then it shows your weakness on things that truly matter.
705845227819573248 2016-03-04 19:59:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> So we should just sit back and accept it? That's incredibly weak.  https://twitter.com/retepger/status/705844735517204480
705844237838000128 2016-03-04 19:55:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> We should never accept' this legal homicide. It should never become something we're comfortable with. https://twitter.com/retepger/status/705843567646756864

705789637630021632 2016-03-04 16:18:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MCCountChill Exactly. Which is ridiculous.
705788554425798656 2016-03-04 16:14:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I don't know how any thinking person could look at last night's #GOPDebate and believe Trump "won". He's a mess. It's embarrassing.
705785255249240067 2016-03-04 16:01:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @texlovera Oh yes, "interesting" is open to personal interpretation. :)
705785090383728641 2016-03-04 16:00:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> That's quite the pair. <eye roll>https://twitter.com/freddoso/status/705782657465114630
705761907177873409 2016-03-04 14:28:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> #HouseOfCards is back. Hopefully Season 4 is good...although real political drama right now is probably more interesting.
705609680635228160 2016-03-03 04:23:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Goodnight America, you beautiful thing.   And remember...#NeverTrump
705604765649084417 2016-03-03 04:04:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The clear non-candidate loser of the night?  THE INSANE AUDIENCE. No, people. #GOPDebate
705603500902846464 2016-03-03 03:59:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Both Rubio and Cruz say they'll support Trump if he is the nominee. #GOPDebate.   Not me. #NeverTrump
705601999912493056 2016-03-03 03:53:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Listening to debate on the radio, and watching Steph Curry & the Warriors. #multitasking
705600727830372354 2016-03-03 03:48:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DogDynastyLLC According to Trump people, Trump always wins each debate...even when he doesn't.
705600318910963713 2016-03-03 03:46:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> For the record, America doesn't need to see any of the candidates in yoga pants. #GOPDebate
705599854853169153 2016-03-03 03:44:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Don't know when the debate ends (please be soon), but it's clear Cruz is the winner tonight...so far. #GOPDebate
705599196821364736 2016-03-03 03:42:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Cruzbio #GOPDebate
705598934333444096 2016-03-03 03:41:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Cruz has had plenty of slam dunks tonight - with facts - against Trump. Using his own words against him is the best ammunition. #GOPDebate
705597213095944193 2016-03-03 03:34:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rottencoreblog Exactly. He's kind of stayed there. He shouldn't have stooped.
705597054500872192 2016-03-03 03:33:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Cruz for states' rights. #GOPDebate
705596789488017409 2016-03-03 03:32:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I agree with Kasich. Couples shouldn't be allowed to sue cake baker/photographer just because they choose not to participate. Go elsewhere.
705596386474070016 2016-03-03 03:31:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rottencoreblog He's done quite well tonight with facts instead of insults...unlike others.

705594118995615744 2016-03-03 03:22:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DRGee611 No, Cruz is bringing fact-filled slams. Those aren't insults.
705593603679260672 2016-03-03 03:19:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @nancrews Thankfully I'm only listening to it.
705593479028727808 2016-03-03 03:19:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Leave it to Kasich to swoop in with love and light every debate. #GOPDebate
705593166142021632 2016-03-03 03:18:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MCCountChill I'm cringing.

705592886377783296 2016-03-03 03:17:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ColbyNick Definitely
705592807591911424 2016-03-03 03:16:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This is a very, very embarrassing event tonight. Really. #GOPDebate
705592382922858497 2016-03-03 03:15:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This is such a cluster. #GOPDebate
705591405033476097 2016-03-03 03:11:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You can't say Trump University is a success or people are pleased with it. You just can't. Clear failure. #GOPDebate
705589947949043712 2016-03-03 03:05:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PaulDChristian The crowd is continually obnoxious. Whooping, hollering, loud, etc. Kick them out, I say!
705588788358221826 2016-03-03 03:00:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It seems Rubio and Cruz have decided to lay off each other and go after Trump. Also present, though no on cares, is Kasich. #GOPDebate
705587525310668800 2016-03-03 02:55:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The crowd needs to be excused. #GOPDebate
705587305319419904 2016-03-03 02:54:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm not sorry for saying this: Snowden is a traitor. #GOPDebate
705584710173532160 2016-03-03 02:44:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Cruz is measured and solid in his fact-filled slams. #GOPDebate
705581720792408064 2016-03-03 02:32:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Please muzzle this crowd. #GOPDebate
705581456094060544 2016-03-03 02:31:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> So far I think #TedCruz is doing the best. Focusing on issues and slamming Trump with facts, not insults. #GOPDebate
705580171911372801 2016-03-03 02:26:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's kind of funny when actual facts and figures are presented to Trump which completely show his lack of substance. #GOPDebate
705579794524721159 2016-03-03 02:25:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ColbyNick But Chris Matthews is an idiot, btw :)

705575537016774656 2016-03-03 02:08:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> We did not need Trump to assure us that while his hands are small, others things are not...small. #GOPDebate
705558647397552128 2016-03-03 01:01:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray 
705556433207742464 2016-03-03 00:52:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> What will a #GOPDebate be like without Ben Carson's complaints about being ignored and almost tranquilized demeanor?
705545720795963392 2016-03-03 00:09:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Going to put a fence in my backyard. It's going to be yuge. It's going to do very well. I'll make my neighbors pay for it. #TweetLikeTrump
705538697547128832 2016-03-03 23:41:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray I feel the exact same way! So many movies now are just dreadful. Keeps me away from the theater. All unoriginal and moronic.
705537129556922369 2016-03-03 23:35:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Reince, you're part of the problem.https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/705531056770961409
705533701686501377 2016-03-03 23:21:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AmericanMetal1 Nope, not at all. Happily never casting a vote for him. #NeverTrump.
705531599404793856 2016-03-03 23:13:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Do the GOP debates affect - in any way - who you'll vote for?
705530319999528960 2016-03-03 23:08:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @walakewon You've not been missing much. They're all too long and all the same. Painful.
705522035049558016 2016-03-03 22:35:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rottencoreblog It's very, very good.
705516311095463940 2016-03-03 22:12:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rottencoreblog Gotham is an excellent option!
705513644273041408 2016-03-03 22:02:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @dsjensen12 Yeah, I think I've hit that point.
705513547745378304 2016-03-03 22:01:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Agreed. It's going to be the same thing all over again, T.
705512626823028736 2016-03-03 21:58:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Part of me would like to watch the #GOPDebate tonight...but, I mean, do I really want to subject myself to that...again?
705503330794139648 2016-03-03 21:21:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JustEric Yes. And so many are saying "You just need to get in line and choose the lesser of two evils!" Uh, NO.
705497669611999232 2016-03-03 20:58:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @nancrews I told him at the RedState Gathering that he has my vote. If Trump is on the ballot, I'm keeping that promise.
705494546470281217 2016-03-03 20:46:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> #GIFparty is trending, and all I can think is that would be @_David_Edward's political party if he created one.
705492646408658945 2016-03-03 20:38:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rottencoreblog Same here. Rubio is my first choice, but I wouldn't hesitate about voting for Cruz, and others shouldn't, either.
705492014788452352 2016-03-03 20:36:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Oh look, it's the guy who should be our candidate, but unfortunately, couldn't catch fire because voters are lame.https://twitter.com/POLITICOPro/status/705475478954446848

705453329292337153 2016-03-03 18:02:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Helen47 Nope. Thanks. @Eric_Bartoszak
705451673184038912 2016-03-03 17:56:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Standing on conservative principle, & not voting for either liberal (Trump or Hillary if they get the nom), is more important than winning.
705411654327144448 2016-03-03 15:16:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Really, modern day feminists. You're completely embarrassing. Always looking for victimhood in an effort to feel relevant. You aren't.
705410724479291394 2016-03-03 15:13:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rottencoreblog Where's the "gorging oneself on chocolate" femoji? @MarketingWeekEd @bodyform

705406983202086912 2016-03-03 14:58:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Gormogons Exactly.
705406662144888832 2016-03-03 14:57:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Gormogons Says she's a chaplain for Planned Parenthood now. What a fraud, and who knew PP had chaplains? Sickening.
705406174460551168 2016-03-03 14:55:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Gormogons Wow. Want to "make a difference", so kill the precious life you've been given as a gift.
705366602456375297 2016-03-03 12:17:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @stiles_sean Uh. You're definitely new to all this. @CNNPolitics @realDonaldTrump
705364770996805633 2016-03-03 12:10:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Haven't watched shrill @seanhannity for years. Same with @FoxNews. They have abandoned conservatism, so not watching them will continue.

705137169183186945 2016-03-02 21:06:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Life IS precious regardless of "quality" due to disability, disease, or age. Matthew is a fool.https://twitter.com/MatthewGellert/status/705135989241602048
705136575794040834 2016-03-02 21:03:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @censoredbee Don't tell @angelagim. Those success stories scare people like her.
705136453102215168 2016-03-02 21:03:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Legality does not equal morality. Abortion is not the answer to rape.  https://twitter.com/angelagim/status/705135998477455361
705135673817341952 2016-03-02 21:00:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Biologically you do, and the baby should not be held responsible for the criminal act of the rapist.  https://twitter.com/angelagim/status/705134358965960704
705124841809170433 2016-03-02 20:17:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @willhoerter Their argument is that since it's legal, no one should question it.
705122055403020288 2016-03-02 20:06:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> That abortion is legal is one of the greatest examples of how legality is not the same as morality. #StopTheSham

705100968824868864 2016-03-02 18:42:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I support personhood for both women and their unborn babies. Let's promote the wholeness and health of both. #StopTheSham
705074753279823872 2016-03-02 16:58:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray A ticket with those two would so great. SO. GREAT. But I don't expect it.
705074420000399360 2016-03-02 16:56:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @colonel_calzone Of course, see if he can win Florida, but not so sure about that. Lots to think about if not.
705073396770586624 2016-03-02 16:52:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Just trying to be realistic with the only two viable options we have left. Also, #Murica.
705073271633530881 2016-03-02 16:52:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MadameAmerica Same here. Rubio is my first choice, but I'd happily support Cruz if it means defeating Trump.
705073052644585472 2016-03-02 16:51:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump, not an option. Kasich/Carson, they're not even here. So it's Cruz or Rubio. I don't see a ticket w/them. So one needs to go.
705071853950337024 2016-03-02 16:46:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Not sure if a Cruz/Rubio or Rubio/Cruz ticket would happen. Given last night's results, might be time for Rubio to bow out.
705065329978970112 2016-03-02 16:20:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rottencoreblog I know. Don't you want to cry?
705052048056786944 2016-03-02 15:28:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump's lack of specifics is like the "hope & change" mantra. Sounds good, and audience makes it what they want it to be in their mind.
705049741026074624 2016-03-02 15:18:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Women need good healthcare, so direct them to http://getyourcare.org/. Thousands of clinic options nationwide, and NO killing of babies.

705017341655064576 2016-03-02 13:10:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Would someone close to @RealBenCarson tell him that the national book tour known as his dead campaign needs to end? Now?
704878779563429888 2016-03-01 03:59:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @STXJoy4 Texans rock ;)
704878222488555521 2016-03-01 03:57:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Goodnight, moon. Goodnight, Twitter. Goodnight, dumpster fires.
704877090387193856 2016-03-01 03:52:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Jennie_Cake1 Sigh. There are so many other, actually useful, options for women! And babies!
704875973158813696 2016-03-01 03:48:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Jennie_Cake1 Yup. They do testings, screenings, some vaccines. They don't do mammograms, though they say otherwise.
704874988474658818 2016-03-01 03:44:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DRGee611 Of course!
704874751068655616 2016-03-01 03:43:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Seriously, #ChrisChristie's face while Trump was speaking is my favorite. So pitiful.
704873927466733570 2016-03-01 03:40:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> What "conservatives" defending @PPact sound like: "This dentist is inexpensive. They kill the unwanted, but hey, they do things for cheap!"
704873379107643392 2016-03-01 03:38:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Wow. How many times do I have to say it? 1. Planned Parenthood is not a necessity.  2. They KILL. They should be shuttered.
704873196185645056 2016-03-01 03:37:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Since one of the "services" they provide is abortion, they've lost claim to being a health organization. Period.https://twitter.com/PATTYFOSTER53/status/704872775794581504
704869227732328448 2016-03-01 03:21:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Nintendo_VX Then you don't understand standing on principle.
704868447008776192 2016-03-01 03:18:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Nintendo_VX I will write-in a name if I must. I won't abandon my conservative principles.
704868016950022145 2016-03-01 03:16:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Nintendo_VX I don't support him, nor do I support a liberty party who doesn't give it to those in the womb. Both ludicrous.
704867546344853504 2016-03-01 03:14:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Nintendo_VX I've run across too many pro-choice Libertarians. They value freedom, just not for the unborn.
704866952959889409 2016-03-01 03:12:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @prolifebuttons So we support the guy who praises them? Idiotic response.
704866242801352705 2016-03-01 03:09:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> .@PPact is outnumbered 20 to 1 by women's comprehensive healthcare clinics. They aren't a necessity. Yet Trump gives them relevance.
704865896616103938 2016-03-01 03:08:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Did you ever think you'd see the (R) frontrunner praise, among other things, Planned Parenthood?? Unbelievable.
704865510266015744 2016-03-01 03:06:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> According to Trump, so-called "conservatives" don't like him praising @PPact.   We don't. You are no ambassador for the unborn, Donald.
704864385936859140 2016-03-01 03:02:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Thank you, Texas & Oklahoma. Some common sense out there.  #SuperTuesdaypic.twitter.com/8iVYKEm3TR

704836160221224960 2016-03-01 01:10:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hillary will absolutely beat him in head to head election.https://twitter.com/fredontwittur/status/704834629119942656
704833856818520065 2016-03-01 01:01:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Regardless of #SuperTuesday results, still and always #NeverTrump.
704827351008460801 2016-03-01 00:35:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray You speak the truth. Again. @CNN @RealBenCarson
704826997869056001 2016-03-01 00:33:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Hey, as long as he's getting money, he said he's staying in. <eye roll> @CNN @RealBenCarson
704826366408183808 2016-03-01 00:31:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I like how @CNN shows a live feed of @RealBenCarson headquarters. And the 25 people there.
704793257620979712 2016-03-01 22:19:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PennyNowhere TX has done so much to promote unborn life. It would be a disgrace to see it set back so much.

704781224410288130 2016-03-01 21:31:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Don't know about you, but if I were running for office I'd do so in a way that wouldn't bring praise from David Duke, @PPact, or Farrakhan.
704769407130726400 2016-03-01 20:44:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @USABoatnerd Which means they'd rather abandon conservatism and vote for the liberal with an (R) next to his name than think about it.
704768629083136000 2016-03-01 20:41:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @USABoatnerd There is nothing of substance to the man. It's pure celebrity appeal and emotionalism. He *is* the establishment.

704757062723575808 2016-03-01 19:55:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Bully? No. A substance-free fascist, racist, truther/birther who is NOT a conservative & has no business running.https://twitter.com/imuszero/status/704756237351563264

704750377103724544 2016-03-01 19:29:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Pandora station I'm listening to is playing the darkest parts of the LOTR soundtrack as the fellowship faces evil. Fitting for today.
704719968554897408 2016-03-01 17:28:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TheValuesVoter I sure hope so.
704718110864109568 2016-03-01 17:21:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket Isn't it sad?
704717515264540673 2016-03-01 17:18:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump is already destroying conservatism, and he's a racist, fascist, birther/truther.  Never will I vote for him. #NeverTrump
704708107021250561 2016-03-01 16:41:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm more excited that this month is #MarchMadness than I am that it's #WomensHistoryMonth.
704705454904111104 2016-03-01 16:30:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Odd. That's how I feel about the incessant amount of one-word insults I'm receiving from Trump fans.https://twitter.com/JustAGuyII/status/704690978817310722

704643295427821568 2016-03-01 12:23:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @southernliving0 Trump seems incapable of denouncing the KKK. He and his supporters deserve this.
704642616374202368 2016-03-01 12:21:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You're an opportunistic hack, Huckabee. What a joke to defend such a clown.https://twitter.com/veganvecoh/status/704431671634886658

704487348072013824 2016-02-29 02:04:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The one word insults from Trump fans keep rolling in. Still doesn't change the fact that he isn't a conservative.
704483007969804288 2016-02-29 01:46:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @sevenlayercake Exactly!
704482680902176768 2016-02-29 01:45:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I vote for conservatives, so Trump will not receive my vote. I'm also not into fascism or racism, either.https://twitter.com/JustAGuyII/status/704478229965352960

704394797461725184 2016-02-29 19:56:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rottencoreblog Oh, it's so cheesy...but it's cute. I've watched 4 episodes. :) I mean, I wanted to be DJ Tanner when I was 10.
704384748152553472 2016-02-29 19:16:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rottencoreblog But it's 80s-90s nostalgia.
704375710555705344 2016-02-29 18:40:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> To hear @CoryBooker on CNN, @HillaryClinton is the candidate of love, light, goodness, and lollipops.
704374839063220224 2016-02-29 18:37:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rottencoreblog Well of course! Have you watched "Fuller House" yet?
704362757328654336 2016-02-29 17:49:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PhantomQuasar I was already getting nauseous.
704362153386573825 2016-02-29 17:46:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump is a substance-free birther/truther nut spray-painted in Day Glo orange.
704361839505883139 2016-02-29 17:45:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> What an utter embarrassment he is. I am looking forward to purposely *not* voting for him.https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/704333198394834944
704359574376153088 2016-02-29 17:36:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Really. I wasn't for Jeb, but he knew when the writing was on the wall and dropped out. Carson stays in for no reason other than ego.

704344749340303360 2016-02-29 16:37:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> What's popular isn't always what's right. Example: Trump. Don't "get in line".

704152916307943424 2016-02-28 03:55:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Well, I really wanted to see Stallone win. Sigh. I'll just blame ageism since blaming an "ism" is always the thing to do.
704134706158280704 2016-02-28 02:42:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ryan_stl1 Yes. And looking forward to attending Trump University. @Cdmiers08 @AlysiaStern
704133375364304896 2016-02-28 02:37:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ryan_stl1 It's very laughable. Can't believe they use it as an actual argument. @Cdmiers08 @AlysiaStern

704116774653059073 2016-02-28 01:31:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hey, Hollywood? If you really thought the whole awards show thing has become racist, there wouldn't be one tonight. #Oscars

704108684092301312 2016-02-28 00:59:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> #Oscars on in the background because it's good blogging fodder. Have already heard an incorrect rape statistic & tons of oppression talk.
704086347674476545 2016-02-28 23:30:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @streiffredstate Excellent analysis.
704086222243762176 2016-02-28 23:30:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Prepare yourself, the #Oscars are on. Soon we'll hear how oppressed the Hollywood Left is as they sit in their self-created bubble.
704071980580892672 2016-02-28 22:33:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray I laughed in the midst of my tears.

704061578274975744 2016-02-28 21:52:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RandyinRichmond I don't abandon my conservative principles to cast a vote. Thus Trump won't get my vote, and I sleep well.
704056305305030657 2016-02-28 21:31:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @mjpayne_ It is! And when I moved to the south, everyone thought I was from a big city just because I had lived up north. Haha.

703787820570304512 2016-02-27 03:44:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> People prefer to turn away from the horror of abortion because they can maintain their comfy lives, free from consequence of knowledge.

703709110668234752 2016-02-27 22:31:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray You speak the truth often, sir.
703708891977281536 2016-02-27 22:30:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> #AlwaysTrump  because although they end lives on a daily basis, the unnecessary Planned Parenthood does such "wonderful" things.
703708530168217601 2016-02-27 22:29:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> #AlwaysTrump is a hangout for those who would rather feel than think. They're like the Obama minions of 2008.
703685355325820929 2016-02-27 20:57:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The same ones who discount people's passion behind #NeverTrump hang on every (misspelled) word that Donald tweets.
703674415117160448 2016-02-27 20:13:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @johnhan79583770 Not really. Many of us, including myself, have been against Trump since the beginning.
703663689895911425 2016-02-27 19:31:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JAbney8 @jabney8 Yet you are still unwise. Go ahead and vote for the huckster liberal known as Trump. You're just like the emotional Obama minions.
703662462776823808 2016-02-27 19:26:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The hilarity of being called "vicious" by a Trump supporter, just because I don't want Trump, is just too much. #ICantEven

703570420084121600 2016-02-27 13:20:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> #NeverTrump because I don't vote for anyone who has been praised by @PPact's Cecile Richards. Both Trump and Hillary have.
703569372535767041 2016-02-27 13:16:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Good morning!   Still this >> #NeverTrump

703436709262921728 2016-02-26 04:29:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> What I demand from my candidate is more than the correct political letter after their name.#NeverTrump

703434730943938561 2016-02-26 04:21:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PoliticalShort @torriangray So why should I vote for either? Because one says they're an (R)?
703434054264295424 2016-02-26 04:18:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PoliticalShort If our choices are Clinton/Sanders or Trump, we deserve some pain. A fraud with an (R) next to his name doesn't get my vote.
703432712879734784 2016-02-26 04:13:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> They're the ones who don't vote for a substance-free liberal with no experience just because they're told to do so.https://twitter.com/PoliticalShort/status/703430635528986624

703324897293045760 2016-02-26 21:04:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hoping that after Christie's endorsement of Trump today, #FullerHouse won't disappoint. But it probably will.

703284099297882112 2016-02-26 18:22:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yeah, the guy who hugged Obama is endorsing the guy who donated to Hillary. No big surprise. #ChrisChristie
703283799514226688 2016-02-26 18:21:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm sure #ChrisChristie and #DonaldTrump feel so cozy in their shared idea that other (R) candidates' views on abortion are "extreme".

703002681300877313 2016-02-25 23:44:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MaloneIfctv1 I believe states should've been left to decide. Also, individuals not prosecuted for refusing to provide services to couples.

702971983756181505 2016-02-25 21:42:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Does she have internet access in her safe space to search for another job?https://twitter.com/CNN/status/702969927511252995
702945954333384705 2016-02-25 19:59:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @countermoonbat @CounterMoonbat I will be watching it, but it's going to be horrific.

702942538852868097 2016-02-25 19:45:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Gormogons CENTRAL Illinois. #represent
702941420185886720 2016-02-25 19:41:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TheBatriarchy I never mute my NCAA basketball buddy!

702940764553285633 2016-02-25 19:38:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Gormogons It's worse. The liberal state of Illinois.
702939501178593280 2016-02-25 19:33:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Voting against my heritage if I don't support Trump?  My heritage isn't spoiled rich kid, or eminent domain, or praising Planned Parenthood.
702933788830134273 2016-02-25 19:10:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rachelfromohio This is going to be a super fun debate. Ugh.
702923233906008066 2016-02-25 18:28:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @texlovera Yes. They need to attack Trump only.
702923011968638976 2016-02-25 18:28:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AwakenTheWest Oh yes. He's a racist idiot.
702911822379270146 2016-02-25 17:43:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It really seems like the #GOPDebate tonight is do or die. I recommend Cruz and Rubio focus on Trump, forget Kasich & Carson.
702911593101856769 2016-02-25 17:42:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Thomasismyuncle They absolutely should.
702900267579273224 2016-02-25 16:57:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Jtruth811 I cannot believe people defend this stuff. Just horrible.
702897849806282752 2016-02-25 16:48:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @oldhickory49 And Trumpkins eat it up/encourage it. I've seen it over and over. Sad.
702896788190138368 2016-02-25 16:43:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @oldhickory49 Or he said Voting against Donald Trump at this point is really treason to your heritage. Which is BS.
702896366826164224 2016-02-25 16:42:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Anyone that says: Voting against Donald Trump at this point is really treason to your heritage" is an idiot. But we knew that. #DavidDuke
702895437410336768 2016-02-25 16:38:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> But Trump supporters aren't racist! Heh.https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedAndrew/status/702886184205344768
702890654028992512 2016-02-25 16:19:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's, uh, Reddit. No one is surprised.https://twitter.com/voxdotcom/status/702888300835684353
702880636479082496 2016-02-25 15:39:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MadameAmerica Oh, I'll take that, too. ;) @JohnKasich @RealBenCarson
702879205659447296 2016-02-25 15:33:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> These two should not be at tonight's #GOPDebate: @JohnKasich @RealBenCarson
702868639398100992 2016-02-25 14:51:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Good Thursday morning, y'all/ya'll/yinz/youse guys.
702832332340916224 2016-02-25 12:27:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray YES. Rocky IV is such a great movie! I love all the patriotic stuff, training in the snow, etc. #heartsonfire
702699301944872960 2016-02-24 03:39:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump fans, it's not really necessary to put pro-white (and only that) in your bios. We already know you're racist.
702697862124212225 2016-02-24 03:33:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @countermoonbat @CounterMoonbat Sad how the "safe space" people are taking over. The entire point of Twitter is disagreeing with others.
702688676569063424 2016-02-24 02:56:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Just finished #CinematicSnobs with @AndreaNRuth & @JayCaruso. We talked about Rocky movies. If you don't like them, you're not a patriot.
702664838963666944 2016-02-24 01:22:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No, Reagan is not running. No, your favorite candidate is not Reagan 2.0.
702663627468308482 2016-02-24 01:17:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @onwardmyhawkmen Thank you. And yes, they do. @RealBenCarson @JohnKasich
702663251650334720 2016-02-24 01:15:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ddpaulbell Actually 33.
702662656700850176 2016-02-24 01:13:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Midwest_Jeeper Haha
702662274486558721 2016-02-24 01:11:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Midwest_Jeeper God bless you. 33.
702662143733272576 2016-02-24 01:11:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @KFoleyFL But your new avi is adorable. Little kiddo.

702660720777891840 2016-02-24 01:05:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray I know. It's the Trumpers who hate brown people. @MikePrattKenya

702658792450826240 2016-02-24 00:58:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BrentCochran1 WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN OPINIONS, BRENT.
702658300291186688 2016-02-24 00:56:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BrentCochran1 Loser.

702631662014767105 2016-02-24 23:10:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Good! 
702631040024588289 2016-02-24 23:07:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Lucky me! I get to join @JayCaruso and @AndreaNRuth on the @cinematicsnobs podcast tonight.
702629239955333121 2016-02-24 23:00:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Jtruth811 Yes. Yes it should. But common sense isn't a Trumpkin's strongpoint.
702602101969592320 2016-02-24 21:12:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> My NOT supporting Trump always lands me on the feel-good lists of Twitter. #warmfuzziespic.twitter.com/QJa850pSee
702562094726512640 2016-02-24 18:33:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @hdavidholden @HDavidHolden I don't and won't vote for liberals, whether they're Trump or Hillary. @DeepSouthProud
702557645987643393 2016-02-24 18:16:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> "You're a conservative, and you won't vote for Trump???"  BECAUSE I'm a conservative...I won't vote for Trump.

702368092739997696 2016-02-23 05:42:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Goodnight, moon. Goodnight, Twitter. Goodnight, raging dumpster fire.
702366045588340736 2016-02-23 05:34:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This always holds true, regardless if it's 'your guy' or not:  "Put not your trust in princes..."

702341422104580096 2016-02-23 03:56:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @305CANES I don't vote for liberals. Period. @Rusty98UM
702338239152201728 2016-02-23 03:44:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I look forward to never casting a vote for #Trump.

702331433432522752 2016-02-23 03:17:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Gormogons Haha. I accept. Both.  @torriangray @GingyNorth
702330661382787073 2016-02-23 03:14:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaseyParksIt I have run across plenty. It's almost funny now that you only believe liberals are racist. Ha. @TheFriddle
702329884278919169 2016-02-23 03:11:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray I want one! @Gormogons @GingyNorth
702329231204872192 2016-02-23 03:08:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaseyParksIt Sad that you still won't accept that racists exist on the Right, Casey. That's been true for a while. @TheFriddle
702328346009583616 2016-02-23 03:05:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Sigh. I know what you mean.
702327652963713024 2016-02-23 03:02:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Really, if Hillary and Trump are the final options, we deserve some pain.
702326955820126209 2016-02-23 02:59:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaseyParksIt Um, no. @TheFriddle
702326845614723072 2016-02-23 02:59:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> SHOCKER that the poll workers who are Trump supporters are wearing gear.https://twitter.com/LettyBurgin/status/702319498481651713
702325937002692608 2016-02-23 02:55:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> People shocked that there are racists on the Right, while a racist account promoting whites only tweets me.   I hate this election cycle.
702325599331852289 2016-02-23 02:54:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @WOATWOAT And yet, I don't care.  @CaseyParksIt @TheFriddle
702325208523345923 2016-02-23 02:52:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> There are racists on both sides. To believe otherwise would be wishful thinking.https://twitter.com/CaseyParksIt/status/702324963169193984

702323304879812608 2016-02-23 02:44:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaseyParksIt Why is it shocking that racist Trump supporters are racist? There are idiots on both sides. @TheFriddle
702323033164423168 2016-02-23 02:43:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Just going to keep tweeting this... "The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter." {Churchill}
702321387755667457 2016-02-23 02:37:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @liars_never_win Yes I do. I've encountered enough racist Trump supporters on here to not be surprised.
702321057039048704 2016-02-23 02:36:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaseyParksIt Think again. There are tons of Trump supporters on here who are white nationalist, swastika-loving freaks.  @TheFriddle
702318473934979073 2016-02-23 02:25:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hillary on #DemTownHall talking about women's issues as if it's still 1919.

702247351654731776 2016-02-23 21:43:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MJCFlorida77 You're a Trump supporter. You support the (R) liberal.
702245377840435200 2016-02-23 21:35:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Here's an idea...  LET'S FOCUS ON THE LIBERAL CANDIDATES, both the (D) ones and (R) one.
702245050542071811 2016-02-23 21:34:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And no offense to CPAC goers, but it looks like a bit of a circus anyway. I'm not going, and not sad about that.
702244564938178560 2016-02-23 21:32:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> If you base your vote on whether someone attends CPAC, then it wasn't a very well-thought out vote anyway.
702237141993132032 2016-02-23 21:02:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Thank you! Right back at you. :)
702233340494090240 2016-02-23 20:47:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TarynOnthenews @torriangray Exactly. There is a 5 minute video of him answering an atheist in regards to his faith at a town hall.

702231871837626369 2016-02-23 20:41:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @repub9989 It has nothing to do with conservative cred. Heh.
702231764308201475 2016-02-23 20:41:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TarynOnthenews @torriangray Apparently we do. I unfollowed several who wouldn't take into account Rubio's strong show of faith already.
702231068649377792 2016-02-23 20:38:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TarynOnthenews @torriangray I saw more Cruz people than I could count buy into the video thing on Sunday.

702230560811433984 2016-02-23 20:36:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TarynOnthenews Actually, many did. I saw a lot of it.
702229629126504453 2016-02-23 20:32:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TheBatriarchy Or President Trump.
702228885337980928 2016-02-23 20:29:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The ideas that Rubio is "afraid" of attending conservative events, or doesn't believe the Bible, are both absurd. But people believe BOTH.
702220366178082816 2016-02-23 19:55:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Funny that you used a picture of Biden, who said in 1992 that Senate shouldn't hold hearings on Bush SCOTUS noms.https://twitter.com/PPact/status/702214617963966464
702211135026675714 2016-02-23 19:19:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @FMSD14 I'm also a size 2 Swedish model, but not really. @ShaunKing @RealBenCarson
702210947612540928 2016-02-23 19:18:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Gormogons Rachel Dolezal finally admitted it. Shaun should, too.

702150849506754560 2016-02-23 15:19:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Being *more conservative* than Hillary or Bernie is not hard, it also doesn't make you a conservative.https://twitter.com/arrowsmithwoman/status/702135146582036480

701992729425879040 2016-02-22 04:51:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray If that doesn't prove fetal personhood and the idea of a separate body with individual needs, I don't know what does.
701992528434884608 2016-02-22 04:50:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray One part in Twice Born: they open a mother up, delicately move the baby's back to them, and give baby a separate anesthesia.
701992043581718528 2016-02-22 04:48:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Absolutely.
701991337667796994 2016-02-22 04:45:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Haha. That's great. :)
701990771927470080 2016-02-22 04:43:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Oh, wow. Did they make it ok?
701990633037287425 2016-02-22 04:43:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I'm so glad that tomorrow we'll see a calmer, more unified R electorate which seeks to put aside pettiness.   #sarcasm 
701989693462859776 2016-02-22 04:39:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray It is breathtaking. There is both joy and sorrow, as you can imagine.

701988797106561024 2016-02-22 04:35:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray I highly recommend "Twice Born", a 3 part documentary about fetal surgery. You might have seen it, but it's excellent.

701945986273382400 2016-02-22 01:45:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Ricerkim Hon, you must not have ever paid attention to my blog posts or timeline.

701881496504762368 2016-02-22 21:29:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @kylebettsgoodw1 I'm not sure if he sunk Cruz for good or anything, but he needed to cut ties really quick. @GenesSmile @tedcruz @rickwtyler
701873652267163652 2016-02-22 20:58:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Patriot_Musket @rottencoreblog You're not a patriot...Patriot.
701873263249641472 2016-02-22 20:56:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> But we live in a world where Katrina Pierson is still employed, so not all is right. #Election2016
701872670934171648 2016-02-22 20:54:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> That was definitely the right move by @tedcruz to ask @rickwtyler to resign.
701871979536760832 2016-02-22 20:51:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rottencoreblog @Patriot_Musket This has been one of the nastiest election cycles ever. Such vitriol from those on *our* side.
701871561683419137 2016-02-22 20:49:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BACCV @MarcyJMiller Sigh. So much for rumors.https://twitter.com/jacobkornbluh/status/701853282357092352

701869649533784066 2016-02-22 20:42:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rottencoreblog Exactly.
701869013178183680 2016-02-22 20:39:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rottencoreblog I think they both need to realize it's Trump they should be focusing on, and not each other.

701748835119398912 2016-02-22 12:42:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You wouldn't have to apologize if you didn't share an inaccurate video and try to start something, Rick. :)https://twitter.com/CNN/status/701745001450094592
701609082432557056 2016-02-21 03:26:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Some think a brave and bold choice is Trump, when in fact, it's evidence of a watered-down, conviction-free resolve.
701607810421751808 2016-02-21 03:21:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> When one of the "services" you provide is murder, you've lost the designation of pro-health. Grow a pair, Jerry.https://twitter.com/JerryJrFalwell/status/701606627103866880

701536831645548544 2016-02-21 22:39:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @TFinn82 @DiverGuy1960 But none of Cruz's. Because he's the "pure", "courageous" conservative. Heh.
701536534831505408 2016-02-21 22:38:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Boognish12 No, that's not the controversy. A video pushed by Cruz camp purports to show Rubio making fun of Bible. @EricTeetsel @marcorubio

701533031752929282 2016-02-21 22:24:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @bigredmatt1011 And congratulations, you earned an unfollow for sharing a smear about someone's faith when he is the opposite.
701531998221893632 2016-02-21 22:20:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @bigredmatt1011 Sharing those lies is just unacceptable, especially when there is actual proof of his strong Christian faith.
701531655731814400 2016-02-21 22:19:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @bigredmatt1011 Ted's campaign has been slimy and sleazy. And @rickwtyler leads the charge. He shared, then deleted, that video tweet.
701531397937307650 2016-02-21 22:18:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @bigredmatt1011 Well, you're wrong. He's shown again and again that he is a firm believer. Here is a real videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkP9RqPA2PQ&feature=youtu.be
701530725590441984 2016-02-21 22:15:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @bigredmatt1011 Too hard to admit that Marco Rubio is also a man of faith? You know, it's not just Ted who is a believer. Wake up.
701530630622990336 2016-02-21 22:15:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @bigredmatt1011 Yeah, this is absolutely false, Matt, and I can't believe you're sharing it as truth.

701502787717193729 2016-02-21 20:24:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Cruz may not be my 1st choice & Rubio may not be yours. But I'd happily vote for either of them over Trump any day of the week.
701501678768369664 2016-02-21 20:20:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Uh, he was born in Florida.http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/270208-trump-im-not-sure-if-rubio-is-eligible-to-run-for
701500355222212609 2016-02-21 20:14:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @physicsgeek See two previous tweets.
701499633604829184 2016-02-21 20:12:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This is getting really old.
701499385562017792 2016-02-21 20:11:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I think it's clear that both Rubio and Cruz are men of genuine faith. Neither are perfect, but they've both made it clear what they believe.
701498960800645120 2016-02-21 20:09:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Wow. Desperate much, Sooper? That video doesn't show him insulting the Bible.  https://twitter.com/trscoop/status/701491546307358720

701466355065749504 2016-02-21 17:59:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Nope. He's not a conservative. He'll never receive my vote. Stop with the "get in line" bully stuff.https://twitter.com/kerpen/status/701438624513052672
701461269191110656 2016-02-21 17:39:33 UTC <SouthernKeeks> #BenCarson was the good guy who was never going to be president. Now he's just the hanger-on. Drop out, dude.
701414068771540992 2016-02-21 14:32:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Donald Trump looks, talks, and carries himself like a mafia boss.
701413851544350720 2016-02-21 14:31:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @R_U_Srs Yes. It seems like they recorded Trump and Hillary's last night. Rubio on now and it looks live.
701413197778198528 2016-02-21 14:28:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @R_U_Srs No clue. Never watched it before.
701412905405849600 2016-02-21 14:27:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Uh, yeah. Just a few.https://twitter.com/CNN/status/701412512026206209
701409890548510720 2016-02-21 14:15:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump on #CNNSOTU with that line again: "I won't let people die on the streets or on the sidewalks."   ...........sigh.
701257453376245760 2016-02-20 04:09:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Goodnight, political Twitter...pic.twitter.com/mc0r6CeD7H
701255199709650944 2016-02-20 04:00:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MCCountChill It is nothing but ego keeping him around.
701253555517321216 2016-02-20 03:54:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> That really odd moment when a Kasich 2016 supporter doesn't understand why you think John should drop out.
701253326772506624 2016-02-20 03:53:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @dafactor1 Kidding, right? Because he has absolutely no chance at the nomination. The guy who beat him tonight, Bush, just dropped out.
701252375617601536 2016-02-20 03:49:29 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AviWoolf 
701251624044511232 2016-02-20 03:46:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PazuzuJSmith No offense taken. Stopped watching way back then.
701250333188743169 2016-02-20 03:41:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @FredGarvin007 Or that bookstore customer who comes in at 8:58 when you close at 9 and wants to browse. (Painful memories from college job.)
701249448161239040 2016-02-20 03:37:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I gave up watching Hannity long, long ago. Shrill and superficial. Like Trump.https://twitter.com/jhseher/status/701241187919855617

701246814935191552 2016-02-20 03:27:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Kasich? The best thing for you to do... 1. Drop out.  2. Go sign that bill to defund Planned Parenthood which is sitting on your desk.
701245376641294337 2016-02-20 03:21:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Jhawkguy11 I explained above, kid.
701245025921986560 2016-02-20 03:20:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The fun thing about Twitter: No one has to agree with anyone, nor is anyone required to reply to you. #TheMoreYouKnow
701244713022705664 2016-02-20 03:19:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Jhawkguy11 Think what you want, and I'll do the same. 
701244188764012544 2016-02-20 03:16:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Jhawkguy11 Read the tweet he replied to with this. They're the fuel behind Trump's fire, and they're emotional little minions.
701243274309324800 2016-02-20 03:13:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Joseph is absolutely right.https://twitter.com/jcampbell46549/status/701207175125975040

701225039358722049 2016-02-20 02:00:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> So, so embarrassing. The Trump minions slobberingly shouted "Mexico!" when he asked who would pay for the wall. What. A. Joke.
701222283260596225 2016-02-20 01:49:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> He was never my choice, but Jeb's speech ending his campaign was classy and heartfelt.
701221297381097472 2016-02-20 01:46:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hey, Carson? Seriously. You need to drop out.
701214151293739009 2016-02-20 01:17:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @_David_Edward I'm going to need a gif to aid your tweet.
701212877278076929 2016-02-20 01:12:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And no, I'm not moving to Canada if Trump becomes president. I'll stay right here and complain. ;)
701211608509509632 2016-02-20 01:07:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @7fairchild .........Instead of several current ones.
701210643895083008 2016-02-20 01:03:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You know who should be in still? Walker, Perry, and Jindal. But no. Voters don't think they're "sexy" enough.

701208936209379328 2016-02-20 00:56:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> God bless the mute button.
701208398164008960 2016-02-20 00:54:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DannyBritton256 @nicknamejed No, I'll still have to plug my nose if your "perfect" courageous candidate is the nominee. ;)
701206667657084928 2016-02-20 00:47:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump already declared winner in SC. Ridiculous. Those who vote (R) are showing themselves to be just as emotional and vapid as the Left.
701201920531234816 2016-02-20 00:29:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I don't believe there's a perfect candidate running. Too many actually think their guy is...
701201649172398081 2016-02-20 00:27:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Good lord, Cruzbots. Take a breath and look at things honestly.
701201280648265728 2016-02-20 00:26:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @nicknamejed Hey, we already know we disagree. I don't need to have a huge long discussion with you again. Have a good one.
701201153976098816 2016-02-20 00:25:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @nicknamejed Maybe because I'm doing something else in real life? The Carson debacle, false Rubio ads, false Rubio photoshop, etc, etc.
701199018051956736 2016-02-20 00:17:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And it's ridiculous that many see Cruz as this pure, non-politician. Heh.
701198728129081344 2016-02-20 00:16:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @nicknamejed Then you're not paying attention.
701198115202797569 2016-02-20 00:13:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Again, I'd vote for Cruz if he were the nominee, but I wouldn't be excited about it. Definitely disappointed in his dirty campaign tactics.

700864063174262784 2016-02-19 02:06:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @HouseCracka Trump is not a conservative at all. He's a joke, and his followers are no different than those who succumbed to Obamamania. ;)
700859531283329024 2016-02-19 01:48:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I just love how people who won't support Trump are called RINOs by the Trumpkins. Uh, LOL. Your guy became an (R) candidate last night.
700854739009929217 2016-02-19 01:29:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @onwardmyhawkmen 1982 for the win! Good year. Also, that song is fantastic.

700800600355819522 2016-02-19 21:54:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's still amazing to me that people prize emotion over substance, and view Trump as the best option. Amazing and ridiculous.
700789747778629632 2016-02-19 21:11:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I thank suffragettes for giving me the vote, but changes in fashion allowed me to wear pants. I'm not, nor have I ever, been oppressed.

699993187453116416 2016-02-17 16:25:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump is making fun of glasses. Hey, GLASSES ARE COOL.
699992227615997952 2016-02-17 16:22:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Seriously...when a candidate frequently attacks another's looks instead of policies, that says something.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/699989532180135936

699269788124762112 2016-02-15 16:31:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I remember many, many kind words from conservatives to the Biden family regarding the death of Beau. Dems forget that?

698949929797095427 2016-02-14 19:20:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rottencoreblog Certainly a scary thought, indeed. Especially with the R frontrunner, the Dem candidates, and Scalia gone.

698706399052828672 2016-02-13 03:12:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> FYI: the immigration issue was brought up BEFORE June 2015 when Trump announced his candidacy. #GOPDebate

698702586170511360 2016-02-13 02:57:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I bet Chris Christie is telling someone in the room he's watching the debate in that he was once a U.S. attorney. #GOPDebate

698701293339222016 2016-02-13 02:52:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> But mostly, I just look at this group and think, "These are our choices?" Sigh. #GOPDebate
698700499860779008 2016-02-13 02:49:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It is SO refreshing hearing specifics from Cruz after nothingness from Trump. Amazing what substance can do, eh? #GOPDebate
698699946514579456 2016-02-13 02:47:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DeeDeeMD No thanks, I've seen it. He'll be out of the race soon anyway.
698699868873822208 2016-02-13 02:46:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> ANSWER IN SPECIFICS, Trump. Just once. #GOPDebate
698699775122735104 2016-02-13 02:46:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> To Trump: "How would you actually do that?"  Hahahaha. He never knows. #GOPDebate
698699518750167042 2016-02-13 02:45:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DeeDeeMD He doesn't really say anything.

698698355657076736 2016-02-13 02:40:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Carson every time: "I think I'd like to answer a different question." #GOPDebate
698697578964246528 2016-02-13 02:37:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The "should Bush have been impeached?" question was out of place. #GOPDebate
698695649722834946 2016-02-13 02:29:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Simple aka lacking substance of any kind.https://twitter.com/mitchellvii/status/698694328957431812
698694165299884032 2016-02-13 02:24:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Complaining about being noticed every debate gets old, Carson. #GOPDebate
698693981715197952 2016-02-13 02:23:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @vbspurs Same!
698692882409111553 2016-02-13 02:18:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> That background and Trump's orangeness clash horribly. #GOPDebate
698692468540358658 2016-02-13 02:17:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yeah, Cruz is knocking the Scalia question out of the park. Screw compromise. #GOPDebate
698692187442323456 2016-02-13 02:16:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's a nice gumdrops and lollipops dream, but a president will NEVER cure divisiveness, Kasich. #GOPDebate
698689356115083264 2016-02-13 02:04:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Well they actually walked out on stage like normal people. #GOPDebate
698687896463798272 2016-02-13 01:59:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The possibility of Trump nominating a SCOTUS justice is not a comforting thought.
698679637732229120 2016-02-13 01:26:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> ...and we thought this election cycle was already crazy.https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/698661573183852544
698676945291116545 2016-02-13 01:15:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Odd. The vitriol & death wishes I receive for being a conservative woman is never questioned by the Left.  https://twitter.com/ethicalsquid/status/698672107216052224
698672244642312192 2016-02-13 00:56:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I admired this about #Scalia: perhaps most among the recent justices, he opposed deciding things that SCOTUS had no business deciding.
698651291560468480 2016-02-13 23:33:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Can't believe this election cycle just got even *more* intense.
698645647587721217 2016-02-13 23:11:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You know what's disgusting? Cheering the death of #Scalia. But many already are. I'm not surprised by the Left.
698637423316639744 2016-02-13 22:38:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> So sad to hear of #Scalia's passing. He was a great man.
698553947473190912 2016-02-13 17:06:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @notkylefoley But...he fights!!  @Krighton_ @realDonaldTrump @scottlincicome
698553744418541568 2016-02-13 17:06:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I dont know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.

698549647804100608 2016-02-13 16:49:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @coolhandschlute We disagree on this completely. :)
698549128956153856 2016-02-13 16:47:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @coolhandschlute I didn't. You said of people who don't vote that their speech doesn't carry weight. That's false.
698548732430831616 2016-02-13 16:46:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> #YouMightBeASandersSupporter if you favorite your own tweets.
698548612347858944 2016-02-13 16:45:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rjustice21 Ditto @coolhandschlute
698548209233297409 2016-02-13 16:44:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @coolhandschlute And I disagree with you, and that's fine.
698547767300526080 2016-02-13 16:42:20 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rjustice21 Yeah, I'm not voting for either.  @coolhandschlute

698545884112535552 2016-02-13 16:34:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You're not required to vote, and many don't when choices are less than best. Anyone is free to speak about it.https://twitter.com/coolhandschlute/status/698545430674567169
698545071235399681 2016-02-13 16:31:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I used to think this, but it's your right to vote OR not vote. And that choice doesn't preclude you from discussion.https://twitter.com/BevfromNYC/status/698540351926231041

698505884138401792 2016-02-13 13:55:55 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @nicknamejed Your link wasn't much of anything. Hey, Jed? We disagree. Cruz is seeking to smear Rubio. It's slimy. @manninti Jed,
698505434139926529 2016-02-13 13:54:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DILLIGAF_not You think Planned Parenthood is a good thing? That's both unintelligent and uncaring.
698505088738975744 2016-02-13 13:52:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @nicknamejed Rubio voted to defund PP before Cruz, who is also a junior Senator (let's not forget) got to the Senate. @manninti
698504139014328320 2016-02-13 13:48:58 UTC <SouthernKeeks> When one of the "services" you provide is murder, it voids out your designation of being pro-health.https://twitter.com/DILLIGAF_not/status/698502564522754054
698503373105078272 2016-02-13 13:45:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> They are outnumbered 20 to 1 by comprehensive women's healthcare clinics. They are NOT a necessity.https://twitter.com/DILLIGAF_not/status/698502564522754054
698501443846868993 2016-02-13 13:38:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MJCFlorida77 Should legislation pass House and Senate, I'd obviously want a president to sign it. But both chambers is difficult.
698500235014905858 2016-02-13 13:33:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> But who cares? We have a GOP frontrunner who believes Planned Parenthood does some good. I'm sure Ted Bundy was nice at times, too.
698499709875392512 2016-02-13 13:31:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> .@nicknamejed Like I said, Cruz's statements were inaccurate. He sought to paint himself as the only true defender of life. What a joke.
698497683305209857 2016-02-13 13:23:19 UTC <SouthernKeeks> .@nicknamejed I stand by my tweet. He *is* painting Rubio as weak on the issue. Slimy smear tactic.
698493826428702720 2016-02-13 13:08:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CTBellows Carson won't make it much further. Trump won't ever receive my vote. I'd vote Cruz in general, but might not like it.
698491076986990592 2016-02-13 12:57:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's getting a bit difficult for me to see Cruz as someone I'd be *happy* to vote for in the general. I'd have to hold my nose.
698489693055422464 2016-02-13 12:51:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> They WERE inaccurate. Cruz painted Rubio as not strong of defending unborn life. What a disgusting tactic.https://twitter.com/politico/status/698334294041825280
698375178674421760 2016-02-12 05:16:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @JTBakery She'd be excellent in a cabinet position.
698368436049727488 2016-02-12 04:49:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rjustice21 @ChrisSeay03 Now it's nothing but flash over substance, and it's incredibly unfortunate.
698367631246696448 2016-02-12 04:46:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @baseballcrank Yes, true.
698367519141314561 2016-02-12 04:46:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Nooooooo
698367411767140352 2016-02-12 04:45:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Really, I miss candidate Scott Walker.
698366642179457024 2016-02-12 04:42:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's only February. This lasts for many, many more months. Oh joy. #Election2016
698366025897799681 2016-02-12 04:40:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yeah, that's false.https://twitter.com/burgessev/status/698279074498629632
698365278393102336 2016-02-12 04:37:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @WorkPlaceRpt I don't accept it.  @FortuneMagazine
698354838292271104 2016-02-12 03:55:42 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @jcampbell46549 So naturally, they say a man has no business discussing reproductive issues. Etc etc.
698353943106162688 2016-02-12 03:52:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @jcampbell46549 He signed a law requiring a 24 hour waiting period before having an abortion, so they're flipping out.
698353403269902336 2016-02-12 03:50:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The absolute implosion on the Left regarding the law #MattBevin signed yesterday continues. Good. I like making them uncomfortable.
698333883826315268 2016-02-12 02:32:26 UTC <SouthernKeeks> By ruin you mean possibly save the unborn  life which your side labels a mere "choice".  https://twitter.com/qqnqui/status/698327988815790082

698297162908696576 2016-02-12 00:06:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MarcusOtte1 Crazy idea, eh?
698274329788862464 2016-02-12 22:35:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Welcome, and thank you. :)
698273154762993664 2016-02-12 22:31:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hey, if you're not following @torriangray, I suggest that you do. Common sense, and sometimes pictures of cake.
698271702141239296 2016-02-12 22:25:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Exactly. Oddly enough, they never bring up Men-Can't-Talk-About-Reproduction when the Bro-Choice boys speak up.
698269927061508097 2016-02-12 22:18:18 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The lunatic Left can't handle that men have pro-life opinions, too. Biology requires they be involved in reproduction, Party of Science.
698269132194770947 2016-02-12 22:15:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's excellent that Governor @MattBevin signed the informed consent abortion law yesterday. It will save lives.
698258934918991876 2016-02-12 21:34:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @theshoebart But where does Trump rank? ;)

698204562558218241 2016-02-12 17:58:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Cdmiers08 Yeah, not concerned if you're bothered by that statement.
698204309968855040 2016-02-12 17:57:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Cdmiers08 And I'll say again: Private sector success (and also plenty of failure on his part) doesn't qualify you for office.
698195818474532865 2016-02-12 17:23:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ChristophDollis I will happily not vote for him, Christoph(er). :)
698195674798624768 2016-02-12 17:23:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Cdmiers08 Oh, and he's not a conservative, he's a liberal. I don't vote for those like him.
698195584348504065 2016-02-12 17:22:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Cdmiers08 So what? Private sector success (and also plenty of failure on his part) doesn't qualify you for office.
698195292240347136 2016-02-12 17:21:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BigJoeBastardi And yet, both don't belong in the White House and never will have received my vote. ;)

697975715279544320 2016-02-11 02:49:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It would be completely embarrassing for candidate Trump to debate the Dem nominee. He has zero substance, and isn't a rep for conservatism.

697431025044103168 2016-02-10 14:44:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @DeLoachJW It doesn't qualify you for any sort of political office. Period. See Trump.
697430214415138817 2016-02-10 14:41:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Neither private sector success, nor family name, nor "niceness" qualify anyone to run for office. #Election2016

697274524824444928 2016-02-09 04:22:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Just to be clear, the Cruz camp's saying Carson would be out didn't hurt Carson in N.H. If anything, Carson hurt Carson in N.H.

697233138649579520 2016-02-09 01:38:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It never fails. David Axelrod always looks like a neighborhood creeper.
697232423600398338 2016-02-09 01:35:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Jhawkguy11 Well they obviously have to be a conservative. Trump is not. He appeals to emotion and the thirst for celebrity.
697231851413442560 2016-02-09 01:33:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Jhawkguy11 There's no such thing. Anyone that does is fooling themselves.
697229466020540417 2016-02-09 01:23:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> A Trump win and Sanders win says a lot about how emotionalism, and not substance, sells. That's a shame. #NHPrimary
697228136090628096 2016-02-09 01:18:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> .@CNN is reporting Carson has only 2% in N.H. So it's *almost* like his campaign will end soon. Just a thought.

696360060092461056 2016-02-07 15:49:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Hey, @DWStweets? I know you were confused/concerned about the Super Bowl yesterday. It starts at 6:30 EST today. No debate interference.
696336685081239552 2016-02-07 14:16:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaseyParksIt You're very welcome.
696335319973625856 2016-02-07 14:10:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaseyParksIt We can agree on that. :)
696331517639991296 2016-02-07 13:55:45 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaseyParksIt Ok, but what's your stance? I've answered many questions.
696331291533381632 2016-02-07 13:54:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaseyParksIt Did I say government involvement in education? Nope. There are many independent organizations who educate and do it well.
696330786451095552 2016-02-07 13:52:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaseyParksIt Correct. But I don't see that occurring, so, for instance, Scott Walker signed a 20 week ban in WI. That's a victory.
696330468757733376 2016-02-07 13:51:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaseyParksIt Why all the questions? What's your stance on it?
696330378265624577 2016-02-07 13:51:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaseyParksIt Yes, I'd be in favor of a Federal law banning it, but since I don't see that happening, small victories will have to do.
696330009728937984 2016-02-07 13:49:46 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaseyParksIt And also educating women and providing hope for those in crisis pregnancies, because they're a part of the equation, too.
696329820905566209 2016-02-07 13:49:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaseyParksIt So fighting to increase the rights of the unborn, extending protections, banning procedures is where we're at.
696329473533349888 2016-02-07 13:47:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaseyParksIt Of course the ideal situation would be overturning Roe v Wade, which allowed for legal homicide, but I doubt that will happen.
696328935722893312 2016-02-07 13:45:30 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaseyParksIt But a foundation of conservatism is the absolute sanctity of life. Disgusting to see some with differing views.
696328654893277184 2016-02-07 13:44:23 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaseyParksIt As seen by answers from Christie and even Trump, each candidate holds individual positions on the issue.
696327149863702528 2016-02-07 13:38:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The true pro-life position does not include an *asterisk excluding the really tough cases. Protecting life demands courage.
696325942529171456 2016-02-07 13:33:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> No one ever said rape or incest pregnancy was easy, but maintaining the health & emotional well-being of BOTH lives is absolutely essential.
696325576844537856 2016-02-07 13:32:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Christie tailored his stance on abortion to not appear "extreme" to N.H. voters. & attacked those fully pro-life. That shows only weakness.
696243700138143744 2016-02-07 08:06:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AiPolitics 3,000 are killed by abortion each day in America. It's a necessary discussion. Honesty is calling it for what it is: murder.
696241798616911872 2016-02-06 07:59:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @AiPolitics Difficult? Of course. But abortion is never, ever the right answer to rape. Period.
696239758419304448 2016-02-06 07:51:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You & Christie are disgusting. Real pro-lifers understand the child shouldn't be punished for the crime of rape.https://twitter.com/AnnCoulter/status/696174520986660865

696207799118864384 2016-02-06 05:44:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @charveshervey He's a nice guy, with success in his field & has great values. I understand his appeal. Thankfully, he won't be president.
696207458306560000 2016-02-06 05:42:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @charveshervey He has zero policy experience. He cannot coherently discuss the issues of the day, and is unaware of many. Etc, etc.
696206903341359108 2016-02-06 05:40:35 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @charveshervey He's a good guy with whom I agree on a variety of things, but he has no business running for president.  Period.
696167493082210304 2016-02-06 03:03:59 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @amullen7 Nope. He has no business running.
696166958874685440 2016-02-06 03:01:51 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I have no idea why Carson is running, and no clue why he has the support he does. He's a good guy. He shouldn't be president. #GOPDebate

696163487219851264 2016-02-06 02:48:04 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @conradclose It's called they stay home.
696163338078830592 2016-02-06 02:47:28 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @thetreymanhere It's the opposite. His stance comes across as weak, which is uncharacteristic.
696163067567144961 2016-02-06 02:46:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @conradclose I'm not seeing that from libertarians I know, but we'll see what happens as a whole.
696162496735023105 2016-02-06 02:44:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @conradclose Libertarians are generally very moderate on social issues. Cruz is anything but that.
696162053501935616 2016-02-06 02:42:22 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @conradclose He's much too conservative for libertarians.
696161623233466368 2016-02-06 02:40:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's odd to me that Cruz is kind of leery about certain enhanced interrogation techniques. Wouldn't have expected it. #GOPDebate
696161125143089152 2016-02-06 02:38:40 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Cruz is anti-waterboarding? Hmm. #GOPDebate
696159812091039746 2016-02-06 02:33:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Moderator asked Trump to please give specifics.   Hahahahahaha.  #GOPDebate
696158239608737793 2016-02-06 02:27:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Fire whomever wrote that bit for you and said you should repeat it 18 times tonight, Rubio. #GOPDebate
696157481957990400 2016-02-06 02:24:12 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Because he NEVER offers specifics.https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/696157287052877824
696156479800406016 2016-02-06 02:20:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Everyone is scared of Christie tonight, and not just because he might sit on them. #GOPDebate
696154861583364096 2016-02-06 02:13:47 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaptYonah Huh?
696154727411752960 2016-02-06 02:13:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ben_techpro Lololol. Ok, kid. ;) @realDonaldTrump
696154399870226432 2016-02-06 02:11:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Roll_Tide_in_TN I'd vote for him.
696154250410336257 2016-02-06 02:11:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @ben_techpro He lacks substance on every issue. What a joke he is.  @realDonaldTrump

696152975086116867 2016-02-06 02:06:17 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump doing what he does best. Being an ass. #GOPDebate
696151928867307520 2016-02-06 02:02:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Roll_Tide_in_TN There are a few I'd happily vote for, and one I definitely wouldn't. My choice was Scott Walker.
696151344898535424 2016-02-06 01:59:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I never know what the heck Trump is talking about when he attempts to answer a question. #GOPDebate

696150641010479104 2016-02-06 01:57:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Rough, rough night for Rubio. #GOPDebate
696149542790701056 2016-02-06 01:52:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Jeb is just dying for the perfect time to say "Please clap". #GOPDebate
696147851294941184 2016-02-06 01:45:56 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump didn't answer North Korea question at all. Good lord. #GOPDebate
696146307149381632 2016-02-06 01:39:48 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Oh yeah. Kasich. Forgot about him. #evergreentweet #GOPDebate
696145382594736132 2016-02-06 01:36:07 UTC <SouthernKeeks> OMG.  Christie and Rubio catfight.  #GOPDebate
696144870520594432 2016-02-06 01:34:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Christie is just slamming Rubio. Rough. #GOPDebate
696143398378586112 2016-02-06 01:28:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Is this a debate, or group therapy? #GOPDebate
696142965014732800 2016-02-06 01:26:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Sorry, that was inappropriate for Carson to bring up his volunteer that died in response to Cruz question. #GOPDebate
696141742094032896 2016-02-06 01:21:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Trump isn't the first to talk about immigration issue, just FYI. #GOPDebate
696140924510937088 2016-02-06 01:18:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> This introduction is already awkward. #GOPDebate

696138305579192321 2016-02-06 01:08:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray Hahaha
696138219566530560 2016-02-06 01:07:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Jeb Bush's opening remarks are always so awkward. Hard to watch. #GOPDebate
696136718152568832 2016-02-06 01:01:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Robostop10 Rubio attack not valid. Bush angered that his "student" is beating him. Christie trying to get attention.
696135758718111744 2016-02-06 00:57:53 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @torriangray The females in Bernie's camp are feminist women who dye their armpit hair. Have fun.
696135430828388352 2016-02-06 00:56:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> ICYMI: Some of my predictions about the debate. Bush & Christie will attack Rubio, Trump & Carson will attack Cruz.http://www.redstate.com/kimberly_ross/2016/02/06/new-hampshire-gop-debate-preview/
696133125521457152 2016-02-06 00:47:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It's too funny that Steinem thinks young women back Bernie to meet men. Because the males in Sanders' camp are glitter bearded hipster boys.
696132410036121600 2016-02-06 00:44:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @Redheadedbird Uh, when did I say they help women, Debbie? @lyz_estrada

696130545969930240 2016-02-06 00:37:10 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PennyNowhere Of course! We really hate ourselves and other women. ;)

696107786501894144 2016-02-06 23:06:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @jcampbell46549 Exactly. And she's seemingly unaware that kickoff isn't until tomorrow.
696106935276294144 2016-02-06 23:03:21 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BACCV Yes, that's what they're saying. They hate rising birth rates in Texas.
696106227877609473 2016-02-06 23:00:32 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Isn't your side the one that did a coin toss to determine Iowa? Geez, that's embarrassing.https://twitter.com/DWStweets/status/696098196871888896
696105348378132480 2016-02-06 22:57:02 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @darci_cole Her recent polling results were supposedly not good enough, but the actual support from IA voters was, in my opinion.
696104619001294848 2016-02-06 22:54:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> And by "hurt" you mean resulted in more babies being born. Which is much healthier for mother & child than abortion.https://twitter.com/PPact/status/696103082287976448
696102319876919296 2016-02-06 22:45:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @CaseyParksIt Of course not. But I truly believe in some way Jeb thinks he deserves it in part because of his last name.
696102066067005446 2016-02-06 22:44:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @darci_cole Agreed. She beat Kasich and Christie in Iowa, but they'll be included on stage, which is ridiculous.

696076250742460416 2016-02-06 21:01:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> We have no need for political dynasties, Jeb. Your name doesn't qualify you.https://twitter.com/Avik/status/696069571719999488

695798805455839233 2016-02-05 02:38:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Bush needs to learn just because you can run for president, doesn't mean you should. Neither his last name nor $ is going to bring a win.
695792382592335873 2016-02-05 02:13:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @SDESSEDS Just gorgeous :)
695791175702310912 2016-02-05 02:08:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @mjpayne_ But I'm currently snuggled next to a sleepy kitty, writing, and listening to fake rain. I'm not sure I want to move.

695377218948636674 2016-02-04 22:43:43 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Thank goodness tomorrow is Friday. I might even use TGIF once it's here.
695371542981521409 2016-02-04 22:21:09 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @BrunusCutis Which is what I'm saying. Too many think Cruz is above it all. Nope.
695371068467494912 2016-02-04 22:19:16 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Cruz's campaign appears to be just as political as all the others, which is apparent in the mess involving Carson. He's a POLITICIAN, guys.

695293764999462912 2016-02-04 17:12:06 UTC <SouthernKeeks> There is an epidemic called people on social media Capitalizing Things which do not Need to Be Capitalized.

694352700868263936 2016-02-01 02:52:38 UTC <SouthernKeeks> According to @CNN on the Democratic side, Martin O'Malley is tied with "Uncommitted".

693594479270318080 2016-01-30 00:39:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I like @rumpfshaker. She's legitimate and honest. All the frustration should be directed elsewhere.
693589161790406656 2016-01-30 00:18:37 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Dear Lord, help me be patient with those people who don't take time to read past the title.

693547703427420160 2016-01-30 21:33:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The news? Like the FBI investigation, Clinton Foundation donations scandal, Benghazi, or support of baby butchers?https://twitter.com/MontanaGnostic/status/693541373132173312
693547028777832448 2016-01-30 21:31:11 UTC <SouthernKeeks> It is in the 70s today. Perfect. 
693534800288862208 2016-01-30 20:42:36 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @coolhandschlute And that is what I said. I don't agree with anyone doing it. Cruz, Rubio, Obama, their endorsers, etc, etc.
693533199079718912 2016-01-30 20:36:14 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @coolhandschlute Ok, not the same thing. If Rubio had done it, then called Cruz out for doing it, that would be an issue.
693532549394632704 2016-01-30 20:33:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @coolhandschlute So because she's a Rubio supporter it bothers you? That's not comparing the same thing.
693531080142536704 2016-01-30 20:27:49 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @coolhandschlute Because people are talking about something that *just* occurred. And again, it's a stupid move for anyone. Period.
693530226555486208 2016-01-30 20:24:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @coolhandschlute Still dumb. It's a cheap ploy for anyone to do.
693528129499979776 2016-01-30 20:16:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> So the Cruz mailer was real. That kind of thing is a cheap, creepy ploy. I'd think the same if a Democratic candidate sent it out, too.

693114918124548096 2016-01-29 16:54:08 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @gatorboy Equal Pay Act of 1963 was passed long ago. Education, years on job, experience all affect pay in actual, non-discrimination ways.
693114096728838144 2016-01-29 16:50:52 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Maybe if you create an #EqualPay Barbie, things will REALLY start turning around for us poor American females.

693110775892811776 2016-01-29 16:37:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Yes, watch this video about Trump and his liberal policies/ideas. He's not a conservative. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcUCLwWCihEhttps://twitter.com/RhonUSA/status/693110060193480704
693101030771396608 2016-01-29 15:58:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> So when you see @HillaryClinton and her harpies praising abortion as a women's "health" issue, remember saline abortion survivor Gianna.
693100308629684224 2016-01-29 15:56:05 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Abortion survivor Gianna Jessen's testimony is always a powerful reminder of the lives affected by "choice". https://youtu.be/yHnaQiOxGfg

692915425533935617 2016-01-28 03:41:25 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Safe abortion is a lie. When one of two beating hearts involved in the procedure is prematurely stopped, safety does not exist.
692915130254893056 2016-01-28 03:40:15 UTC <SouthernKeeks> You are NOT "with her". If you truly were, the "her" would involve the born AND unborn. You're a coward.https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/692914432213655553

692908230264131584 2016-01-28 03:12:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Carson reassuring me about neurosurgery? Would trust him completely.  Talking about US policies? Just no.  #GOPDebate

692830260967182336 2016-01-28 22:03:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rottencoreblog Hey, it was fun. My doll was Samantha Parkington, and the books talked about her life in 1904.
692827337713389568 2016-01-28 21:51:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @MikeAsti11  Hahahaha.   Duh.
692826482838769665 2016-01-28 21:48:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> As 'Lil Kim, I always enjoyed my American Girls doll more than my Barbie dolls, especially since AG dolls came with books. Much more fun.
692824960730042368 2016-01-28 21:41:57 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Sure. Having different options for #Barbie dolls is fine, but if your child's self-esteem is anchored in toys, something is wrong.
692809808290914304 2016-01-28 20:41:44 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Add Trump, Huckabee, and Santorum together, and they still register a negative on my likeability scale.

692374929405272064 2016-01-27 15:53:41 UTC <SouthernKeeks> The "but he fights!" candidate, who will *make* Mexico pay for a wall, can't even handle American journalists.    It's so comical.

690354573895163904 2016-01-21 02:05:31 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PastorFrisbie Haha. That's so cute! Looks like the late '70s. 
690353953553387520 2016-01-21 02:03:03 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @rottencoreblog This is what I'm talking about. Here people stock up on milk and bread when preparing for bad weather. Pfft. That's no fun.

690308599621533696 2016-01-21 23:02:50 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @PastorFrisbie It is a complete and utter smackdown with the truth. So they won't understand it.

690307637976629252 2016-01-21 22:59:00 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @gatorboy Me? I'm as pro-life as they come. Abortion IS murder.
690306983732322304 2016-01-21 22:56:24 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @gatorboy (Click on the picture, and it zooms in.) Just how a pro-choicer would explain pregnancy to their child. Clump of cells, etc.

690274306576769024 2016-01-21 20:46:34 UTC <SouthernKeeks> I do not care what personal choices you make, but when those choices directly affect the very life of another, it is my duty to speak up.
690273888559824898 2016-01-21 20:44:54 UTC <SouthernKeeks> #ReclaimRoe? Since Roe, 57,000,000 unborn lives have been snuffed out for "choice".   No. Reclaim LIFE.

689868353985470464 2016-01-20 17:53:27 UTC <SouthernKeeks> Pro-life IS pro-baby and pro-woman. The best scenario for both is health, emotional and physical, and wholeness. #MarchForLife
689866641157521412 2016-01-20 17:46:39 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @RAMRANTS @RAMrants There is most definitely a war against masculinity. Modern feminism promotes itself while working to demean men.

689827276234604545 2016-01-20 15:10:13 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @pmxpete Trump is not a conservative. He's an embarrassment. Use your vote your way, I'll do the same with mine. :)
689826470680772609 2016-01-20 15:07:01 UTC <SouthernKeeks> @pmxpete If our choices are Hillary or Trump, we deserve a kick in the butt. Neither stands for me. I will not support them with a vote.
