She may be a nice person, but it seems she only tries to start trouble & then fibs about her role in it. No amount of money can fill an insecure heart. Dorit needs to reflect on her motives. #RHOBH

904711080932466688 2017-09-04 14:21:45 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @ChristiaNation_ It's true, sadly, people who are empty inside find the need to be negative, thinking it will make them feel better, but it never will.

898556568333168640 2017-08-18 14:45:54 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @fatbob3sons There were ice storms which looked really cool on the trees, like crystal, but I ended up like a pinball in my car, lol, on Custer Hill.
898553471154085890 2017-08-18 14:33:36 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @fatbob3sons LOL, sorry, was trying to give you some motivation I was stationed at Fort Riley, KS, so I know how cold it gets for you, it's bitter

898545759636791296 2017-08-18 14:02:57 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @fatbob3sons I have had mine for some time now. You have to protect you and yours! #2A
898544712834891777 2017-08-18 13:58:48 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @fatbob3sons It's those who choose to stay uneducated, short sighted, and play the victim to the past, who relish in this divide & don't want to succeed.
898544179222937603 2017-08-18 13:56:41 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @fatbob3sons This is the problem, the continued perpetuating of a race war, it's nonsense in 2017. We all have every opportunity to succeed...equally.
898543541072220161 2017-08-18 13:54:08 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @fatbob3sons Wow, that shows the nature of his heart, not yours. Strangely those who think others hate them, it's the projection of their own feelings.
898541881075748864 2017-08-18 13:47:33 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @fatbob3sons Yes, and deflect thought provoking, direct questions which if thought about, might open their closed minds.
898541206514290688 2017-08-18 13:44:52 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @fatbob3sons Yes! Now they are a problem.
898540876992991234 2017-08-18 13:43:33 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @fatbob3sons They are not free thinkers and are being used as puppets. Pawns in a bigger scheme to destroy this country. It's disgraceful.
898540446628028416 2017-08-18 13:41:51 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @fatbob3sons Because someone who has hate in their heart and not the best interest of our country and people, said the statues now are bad and offensive.
898540056125652992 2017-08-18 13:40:18 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @fatbob3sons This people walked passed those statues for years & surely never even looked at them at all, or knew who they were of. Now they're offended.
898539454586953728 2017-08-18 13:37:54 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @fatbob3sons It's like time, to buy more ammo. I do think the outcome is going to be bad.
898539213540413442 2017-08-18 13:36:57 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @fatbob3sons They're just jumping on a band wagon out of ignorance and trying to feel important, when they are truly self loathing. They're sad & simple
898538916591968258 2017-08-18 13:35:46 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @fatbob3sons These are all aimless, temper tantrums which serve no real point, because the ones carrying these destructive acts out, have no true goal.

895869852308561922 2017-08-10 04:49:51 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @CBSBigBrother @LJayDay1991 @emilyfoxsays Josh dishes it out and then can't take it, so he runs off and cries. No one makes him cry, he makes himself cry. He's just attention seeking
895863136842076160 2017-08-10 04:23:10 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @jrcoleman009 Lol! Wow, whose the name calling bully now?
895862836701929472 2017-08-10 04:21:59 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @jrcoleman009 Sure did!
895841416034885632 2017-08-10 02:56:52 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @makeupgirlies Such a pretty & fun palette!!
895840383686651904 2017-08-10 02:52:46 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @jrcoleman009 Sorry, have to disagree. Josh dishes it out & is so rude, but then runs & cries. Jess & Cody are far from being worse than Josh or Paul.
895838803323219968 2017-08-10 02:46:29 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @RickPowell13 Are you for real? They're the only ones who aren't blind. They're the only reason we're watching this season. Paul and Josh are way worse.
895837688825294848 2017-08-10 02:42:03 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @CBSBigBrother I teared up when Cody told Jess he loved her! Still rooting for #TeamJody #BB19 #YouWonLove

893609626893246464 2017-08-04 23:08:32 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @davelackie Thank you so very much! This is such a delightful surprise! 
893177572053458944 2017-08-03 18:31:42 UTC <Dorey_Girl> Nope, totally agree! Josh can dish it out, but can't take it. Paul can manipulate & connive, but no one else is allowed. And, Matt is shady.
893176114000130048 2017-08-03 18:25:54 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @autumnautumatic Yes, I can't believe she didn't target Paul for eviction when she was HOH. He played her, too.
893175714844954626 2017-08-03 18:24:19 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @FalconPunch85 I can't believe they are all such sheep. Cody is the only one who sees it and doesn't fall for the hype. #TeamCody
893175136752369664 2017-08-03 18:22:01 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @johndegarson I can't believe the whole house didn't target Paul from the beginning. Why are they so mesmerized by him, he has no loyalty to anyone.
893164858371440640 2017-08-03 17:41:11 UTC <Dorey_Girl> Yes! Josh is the bully.

891009511447822337 2017-07-28 18:56:36 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @DeathWishCoffee I just subscribed for the 5 pound bag of Odin Force Valhalla Java in whole beans! #OdinForceValhallaJava #DeathWishCoffee #FreebieFriday

890617339183480832 2017-07-27 16:58:15 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @fatbob3sons People act like they handing it out like candy or something. It's just another ludicrous, unsubstantiated retort. #Deflection
890616247414599681 2017-07-27 16:53:54 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @PeeSparkle @WendiJeffers2 @fatbob3sons And as a Veteran, I also don't think Veterans should be able to get a disability benefit for the effects from alcoholism or smoking #Choices
890615528418668546 2017-07-27 16:51:03 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @PeeSparkle @WendiJeffers2 @fatbob3sons You're very welcome! I don't condemn anyone for their own personal choices, but when those choices will affect others, it's not cool.
890603543639375876 2017-07-27 16:03:26 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @DreamCIoset I need the body that would go with it! Lol!  #Goals

890599294859964416 2017-07-27 15:46:33 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @realDonaldTrump @valor4us Thank you for your service Kristin, but you transitioned after retirement, not while serving. Never did anyone say you weren't worthy.
890595611661262849 2017-07-27 15:31:54 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @realDonaldTrump @FollowingAlida @mileskahn @lukeleifeste @Anuhint1 @DanielEsco75 Exactly, this is irrelevant to what is going on. Folks need to do some research, get the whole truth, & facts. Comparing apples & oranges.
890594474145042432 2017-07-27 15:27:23 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @realDonaldTrump @mileskahn Beck retired from the military in 2011 and began her transition after retirement, not while enlisted. #TransitionPostMilitary
890590711837577216 2017-07-27 15:12:26 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @RealJamesWoods Lol! This is great!!
890588969783656450 2017-07-27 15:05:31 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @PeeSparkle @WendiJeffers2 And when they get liver disease from the required hormone therapy, they will claim a service-connected disability and try to collect.
890587956142116864 2017-07-27 15:01:29 UTC <Dorey_Girl> @JoeBiden That's exactly it, QUALIFIED. If one is medically flagged and non-deployable, they are not qualified. Stop making this about what it's not.
