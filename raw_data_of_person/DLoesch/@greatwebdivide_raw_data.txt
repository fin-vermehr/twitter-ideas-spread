955469770509508609 2018-01-22 15:58:39 UTC <greatwebdivide> @IrishOberon OMG OMG a sign of the apocalypse?  https://twitter.com/hashtag/SquirrelAppreciationDay?src=hash
954371184447115264 2018-01-19 15:13:16 UTC <greatwebdivide> @IrishOberon Isn't there a universal mathematical truth this violates? The size of the squirrel (S) must always be < the size of the hound (H).
953004272383381504 2018-01-15 20:41:39 UTC <greatwebdivide> @brianboom135 Just wanted to say you have a new fan. You seem like a pretty chill and humble guy. You represented yourself great on Ariel's show. Nothing but best wishes for you in your career.
951132005856669697 2018-01-10 16:41:56 UTC <greatwebdivide> @JackPosobiec I see the Borg ships from Star Trek ... I also see the Jawa transport mentioned by @dereck72vapes
950732484815282182 2018-01-09 14:14:22 UTC <greatwebdivide> @IrishOberon Dog intelligence and ability communicate are directly proportional to the size of the dog and the percent of hound in their breed. Love for bacon and sausage is the only universal dog attribute.
936230627296403456 2017-11-30 13:49:10 UTC <greatwebdivide> @KevinHearne Ug, i bought this for my daughter for Christmas ... it's sitting on my desk ... it is SO HARD not to read it before I wrap it. I so appreciate everything you and @IrishOberon write/do :)
930071462689628165 2017-11-13 13:54:51 UTC <greatwebdivide> @IrishOberon ... I have an ethical question. I bought @KevinHearne 's book "A Plague of Giants" for my son for Christmas. Is it ok if I read it before wrapping it? Is this too much like taking a bite of a sausage present I bought for someone? Or is it merely like smelling it?
928665021906915328 2017-11-09 16:46:09 UTC <greatwebdivide> @KevinHearne sorry, @IrishOberon ... courtesy of you too. Plus I'm buying myself a nice package of sausage for x-mas.

925006057289801730 2017-10-30 14:26:44 UTC <greatwebdivide> @DelilahSDawson @KevinHearne Though I'm sure I'll buy this book, I'm waiting for the sequel which will hopefully star @IrishOberon "No country for old sausage".
921011109217406977 2017-10-19 13:52:14 UTC <greatwebdivide> @KevinHearne That looks like sausage that's been unbound from the earth by atticus ... does oberon eat unbound sausage?
915950212950188032 2017-10-05 14:42:02 UTC <greatwebdivide> @KevinHearne No, but let me know if you find a sausage that changes flavor as you chew ...

862761726521073664 2017-05-11 20:09:59 UTC <greatwebdivide> @IrishOberon I would like to know if you are familiar with @JonathanMaberry 's wolfhound "Banshee". She sounds like one tough bitch.
