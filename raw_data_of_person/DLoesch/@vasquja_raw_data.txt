Corporations need someone with political power to either stop harmful regulation to their livelihood, or, unfortunately to handicap competitors. Such is the reality under a mixed economy.

937405722744250368 2017-12-03 19:38:35 UTC <vasquja> @KenGardner11 I would support cutting military spending after a war, if the government temporarily increased spending during wartime.
937404859166461955 2017-12-03 19:35:09 UTC <vasquja> @RubinReport All because we now get to keep more the money weve earned. Liberty and individual rights is a scary concept to many on the left.
