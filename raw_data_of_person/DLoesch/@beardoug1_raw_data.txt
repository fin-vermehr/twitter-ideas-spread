944952322383319045 2017-12-24 15:26:04 UTC <beardoug1> @DavidSmoak @SUSIEALLRED1 Yes. Comes down to City planners & local residents (voters) on number and size of High Schools.  Comal county struggling with same issue.  Smithson Valley, New Braunfels, & Canyon HS all small 6A. Canyon Lake 4A.   Q: Expand existing (bigger) or build new (smaller)? TBD
944931866154618880 2017-12-24 14:04:47 UTC <beardoug1> @DavidSmoak @SUSIEALLRED1 Yes. Allen 'learned' from Plano, who has 3 HIgh Schools now, only 1 up until 1983. Plano ' learned' from Richardson who has 4 High schools.   The delima is: Less schools = more talent = Dominate consistently vs More schools = more opportunity for kids = win sometimes
