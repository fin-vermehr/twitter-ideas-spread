970403689893650433 2018-03-04 21:00:43 UTC <BelieveHarold> I live in the City of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma for the last three years I have been attempting to have the city correct a wrong. The city has allowed a business to operate out of the Cities on zoning code. There is currently a fiberglass shop operating next door to my home.
