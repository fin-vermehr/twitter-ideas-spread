970377866545451009 2018-03-04 19:18:06 UTC <Nailersfan91> @VanderpumpRules What about all the reverse racism promoted by others on this show? This doesnt bother We the Heartland People at all!https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oAFjBSPUQJk
970317834063679490 2018-03-04 15:19:33 UTC <Nailersfan91> Dont watch far left oscars. Watch good ol NASCAR and win the culture war!
969928623808503808 2018-03-03 13:32:58 UTC <Nailersfan91> There is culture war in America. The Heartland will win!
969701930825109505 2018-03-02 22:32:11 UTC <Nailersfan91> Good ole song!https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OhEHB0a7Uyg
969653345211252744 2018-03-02 19:19:07 UTC <Nailersfan91> The Heartland will win the culture war!https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nAyXhK9d300
968477918681845760 2018-02-27 13:28:23 UTC <Nailersfan91> Gun control isnt needed. More security is needed. Mini security units in schools is a great idea. Secure USA!https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-lDb0Dn8OXE
967169752459304960 2018-02-23 22:50:12 UTC <Nailersfan91> The far left loons want to take straws away. Not here in the Heartland! We will win this culture war!
967052938853142531 2018-02-23 15:06:02 UTC <Nailersfan91> The Harvest box idea is great! Essentially an expansion of meals on wheels. This will be good for America!
966835461749706756 2018-02-22 00:41:51 UTC <Nailersfan91> We must do something about the roads. Provide companies with the incentives to fix them. The President has provided a plan. Congress must do its part as well as the states and private sector. Rebuild the USA!
966815272605835266 2018-02-22 23:21:38 UTC <Nailersfan91> The Harvest Box idea is a great idea. We appreciate this idea. This and expanding meals on wheels would be good for America.
965964616324059141 2018-02-20 15:01:25 UTC <Nailersfan91> Culture War is breaking out in America! The Heartland will win!https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9AN04imFDK8
964979567432749056 2018-02-17 21:47:11 UTC <Nailersfan91> No matter who our leaders are, Republican or Democrat, we need good infrastructure. The President is providing a great plan that will rebuild America and We support President Trump and this plan.
964950996194603008 2018-02-17 19:53:40 UTC <Nailersfan91> Also a national firearms freedom act and getting rid of gun free zones so that no one is a sitting duck and we can stop the crimes before they happen would be beneficial. Training with firearms and more security would help a lot. Keep Americans safe!
964931640396042246 2018-02-17 18:36:45 UTC <Nailersfan91> More security is needed to prevent mass shootings. Train teachers who are ex military for security and arms measures as well. Keep America and Americans secure!
958016048632123394 2018-01-29 16:36:39 UTC <Nailersfan91> Great scene from Tombstone. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=trgKeCFmi3M
957980536256987146 2018-01-29 14:15:32 UTC <Nailersfan91> Really good western.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-msHHTioMhc
957292200148324353 2018-01-27 16:40:20 UTC <Nailersfan91> Are statistics that make the heartland look bad faked? Do they cook the books? You make the call.
957044014032748545 2018-01-26 00:14:08 UTC <Nailersfan91> Freedom isnt free.
956862759173533697 2018-01-26 12:13:54 UTC <Nailersfan91> Freedom isnt free.
956639183069626368 2018-01-25 21:25:29 UTC <Nailersfan91> Stop chain migration! Secure our border! No more anchor babies! Protect USA!

956220069830430720 2018-01-24 17:40:05 UTC <Nailersfan91> @kristendoute @lipglossartist This is about the Culture War. Perhaps alcohol shouldnt either. Ive been drug, alcohol, and tobacco free my whole life. Good choices. Im doing well. People use these to get intoxicated. Heartland Culture is good for USA.
956131465665941506 2018-01-24 11:48:00 UTC <Nailersfan91> @kristendoute Still against federal law and extremely dangerous when things like fentanyl are added. Enforce all drug laws!
955572391492583424 2018-01-22 22:46:26 UTC <Nailersfan91> @kristendoute Culture war Im guessing huh far left loons? That might be acceptable out in San Francisco LA or other California places. Needs to be kept out of Oklahoma Mississippi and the rest of the heartland. States rights! Family values!
954848611719933953 2018-01-20 22:50:23 UTC <Nailersfan91> @womensmarch @stassi @kristendoute The womens march is clearly about Hillary Clinton losing the election and a power grab. There is record employment of women right now. War on women not a real issue. Simple as that!
954829038635442178 2018-01-20 21:32:37 UTC <Nailersfan91> Trillions of dollars are being extracted from this country and given to foreigners. Foreigners take from this nation. Dont allow this to happen anymore. Secure our borders and do extreme vetting to protect USA!
954825513255784449 2018-01-20 21:18:36 UTC <Nailersfan91> If women make up 51 or 52% of the population and want to be paid equally doesnt that mean that they should do 51 to 52% of the work?
954825364395778050 2018-01-20 21:18:01 UTC <Nailersfan91> Protesters at womens march should focus on getting jobs other than carrying on about a non issue. I thought the Lilly Ledbetter act fixed the pay problem under dem control.
954823030085169152 2018-01-20 21:08:44 UTC <Nailersfan91> The womens march in Washington DC is basically a widespread complaint of Donald Trump winning the presidency over Hillary Clinton this so-called feminist leader. Unbelievable!
954723105729019905 2018-01-20 14:31:40 UTC <Nailersfan91> The GOP should offer dems an infrastructure project which they used to support see if theyll go along with it. Build the wall. See how much dems care about protecting Americans from illegal immigration.
954721440426790912 2018-01-20 14:25:03 UTC <Nailersfan91> Also for the border build the wall to protect this nation which will be great for the United States will keep drugs and crime out of this country. Deport illegals and get rid of anchor baby situation.
954721065976164354 2018-01-20 14:23:34 UTC <Nailersfan91> We need a military option for the Southwest border and military presence in which the border security is enforced which will be great for the United States. Protect our borders.
954720237525655553 2018-01-20 14:20:17 UTC <Nailersfan91> The March for women protest in Washington DC is nothing more than a power grab of putting women into positions of power.
954719673924415493 2018-01-20 14:18:02 UTC <Nailersfan91> The GOP could compromise with Democrats over the shut down and put an infrastructure project as apart of funding the government and include roller coasters as mass transit.
954499306949627905 2018-01-19 23:42:23 UTC <Nailersfan91> Earmarks are not always a bad thing. That is how little states get things. Sometimes beneficial.
954497384775667712 2018-01-19 23:34:44 UTC <Nailersfan91> A mass transit infrastructure project that includes roller coasters as mass transit would also provide plenty of small business opportunities in commuter towns.
954495783394578433 2018-01-19 23:28:23 UTC <Nailersfan91> If we can spend billions of dollars on entertainment and amusement then we can definitely have an infrastructure project that provides millions of jobs from great US American workers.
954494336351326210 2018-01-19 23:22:38 UTC <Nailersfan91> Roller coasters as mass transit would be a great idea for the United States. It would revitalize the US economy and provide many many jobs!
954492483655884800 2018-01-19 23:15:16 UTC <Nailersfan91> If the GOP can offer Mexico something instead of working it through Congress to pay for the wall perhaps they can get the wall and end illegal immigration and get drugs out of this country. Great for USA!
953400073483939841 2018-01-16 22:54:25 UTC <Nailersfan91> I guess racism is the number one issue in America. Not healthcare, the economy, or security but racism. That is what the far left wants us to think.
953399123377557506 2018-01-16 22:50:38 UTC <Nailersfan91> @kristendoute Im on my own side. I feel much safer knowing that illegals and drugs are kicked out and off the streets. The security of this country is the top priority. Stop this illegal immigrant criminal invasion and protect established Americans.
953390937065041921 2018-01-16 22:18:07 UTC <Nailersfan91> @kristendoute So Trump is to blame for somebody else breaking the law? I guess its racist to enforce the law huh? Pretty soon itll be racist to even speak English. Thats the goal of the far left. Deporting illegals is brilliant!

952882521443889152 2018-01-15 12:37:51 UTC <Nailersfan91> The Heartland Americans will win this Culture War. No more political correctness!
952637275783024640 2018-01-14 20:23:20 UTC <Nailersfan91> @VanderpumpRules @DeannJerrie @snelsonrobinson That is a culture war statement you just said. Shameful comment as were sure Ms Cartwright is a great person. Kentucky is a really great place. Beautiful horses and great farmland near Indiana. Not as good as West Virginia though.
952584215656321024 2018-01-14 16:52:29 UTC <Nailersfan91> Have people ever heard of not doing drugs? Have they ever heard of it? Drugs and drug cases should be handled by the CJ system. All drugs, including pot are extremely dangerous because of additives like fentanyl and have killed millions.
952580878731038721 2018-01-14 16:39:14 UTC <Nailersfan91> Law enforcement in the US on all levels needs to enforce all drug laws. Support law enforcement. Blue lives matter!
952576431493713920 2018-01-14 16:21:33 UTC <Nailersfan91> The 2018 Republican plan should be to pass an infrastructure bill as it would be popular with Americans and help the GOP in November.

952547692495896576 2018-01-14 14:27:22 UTC <Nailersfan91> For the future of coal mining in West Virginia and its overall future vote against Joe Manchin. Preferably Republican but WV must vote against Manchin no matter what. Plus Manchin voted with PA senator to take away guns.
952545969073213441 2018-01-14 14:20:31 UTC <Nailersfan91> Coal is good for America as it provides jobs, livelihoods, and futures for people in places like West Virginia. Support coal miners and coal mining. Coal, oil, and natural gas are good and operations within these must be expanded as much as possible.
952544101227991040 2018-01-14 14:13:05 UTC <Nailersfan91> We need an infrastructure project in America.
952513341121064963 2018-01-14 12:10:52 UTC <Nailersfan91> We the Heartland Americans will win the Culture War in America! We are the Culture Warriors!

952345904383741952 2018-01-13 01:05:31 UTC <Nailersfan91> The fema camps have been renamed to residential centers and martial law has been renamed to state of emergency. Still a possibility of concern.
952245800108810241 2018-01-13 18:27:45 UTC <Nailersfan91> Could the govt be covering up data on the real non threatening state of the climate to suit their haarp facility agenda? We investigate/research. You make the call.
952244750811267072 2018-01-13 18:23:35 UTC <Nailersfan91> What do the far left loons say about this weather? So much for that global warming.pic.twitter.com/bogTXn2T7s
952213750333018118 2018-01-13 16:20:24 UTC <Nailersfan91> ... there is a consensus among geographers that the US could be divided up into nine nations and a talk of ten sectors according to documentaries. We want honesty from our govt about the fema camps.
952213109522993153 2018-01-13 16:17:51 UTC <Nailersfan91> Some of the theories surrounding fema camps are more than just based on speculation. Fema camps are real. Its what they are being used for is the question. ...
952208367207972865 2018-01-13 15:59:00 UTC <Nailersfan91> America First is right! Global governance has killed hundreds of millions in the 20th century. Learn from history.
952207920774729728 2018-01-13 15:57:14 UTC <Nailersfan91> Building roller coasters for mass transit is a really good idea and would create jobs/benefit millions of Americans.
952190905917812736 2018-01-13 14:49:37 UTC <Nailersfan91> A war is raging in America. The culture war!https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9AN04imFDK8
952144877982289920 2018-01-13 11:46:43 UTC <Nailersfan91> There is a possibility that the govt is creating humanzee super soldiers through the biometrics lab. Were not saying its a fact but a possibility.
951572352827117569 2018-01-11 21:51:42 UTC <Nailersfan91> @VanderpumpRules Freedom of expression.
951528120812785664 2018-01-11 18:55:57 UTC <Nailersfan91> The Republican Party is the party of the free market. Vote straight ticket republican and against all bonds, initiatives, levees, transportation, and tax increases in November 2018.
951527495567896576 2018-01-11 18:53:28 UTC <Nailersfan91> We should not pay back US debt. Simply refuse to pay it. We give these enemy nations the money back through trade, goods, charity, and aid. Less govt, more free markets!
951496362742427649 2018-01-11 16:49:45 UTC <Nailersfan91> Dont envy inaction.
951473772829249538 2018-01-11 15:19:59 UTC <Nailersfan91> So much for that global warming huh far left loons.
951462467162595328 2018-01-11 14:35:04 UTC <Nailersfan91> A tax that could and should be cut is the inflation tax. Everything has gone up except the paycheck. This has to change and will under President Trump.
951461085357510657 2018-01-11 14:29:34 UTC <Nailersfan91> Gonna be back home for awhile. The team and I are drifters.

951103804409372672 2018-01-10 14:49:52 UTC <Nailersfan91> The deep state federal govt needs to stop being so tyrannical against the American people. Get the federal govt out of the heartland through non violence.

951067290795114496 2018-01-10 12:24:46 UTC <Nailersfan91> @Andy @LisaVanderpump We used to think mrs v was sincere about her charity. It is clear now that it is a photo op and an accessory. Go back to England and tell them the fraud of princess Diana.
951052681145208833 2018-01-10 11:26:43 UTC <Nailersfan91> The govt is not the country. The people are the country. Get rid of the deep state tyranny!
950873279421665281 2018-01-09 23:33:50 UTC <Nailersfan91> @VanderpumpRules Miss liberal far left loon. So you want to be paid to take your clothes off? What does that make you?
950840372426674176 2018-01-09 21:23:05 UTC <Nailersfan91> Firearms freedom act nationwide and getting rid of gun free zones would be great American policy.
950832242816966656 2018-01-09 20:50:46 UTC <Nailersfan91> @VanderpumpRules Another question that is for ms kent is what makes you think anyone would want to see her nude? Who in their right mind would want to see that? Ever heard of keeping your clothes on? Guess not!
950827482147639299 2018-01-09 20:31:51 UTC <Nailersfan91> @VanderpumpRules The culture war has been raging for a long time and only been made worse. Heartland America always wins the culture war. Nice try Miss liberal far left loon.
950819609199955968 2018-01-09 20:00:34 UTC <Nailersfan91> If the govt desputes the countless documentaries and evidence that proves fema camps to be real or that the moon landing was faked they can launch a Senate comission. Put pressure on lawmakers to do so!
950817154412302336 2018-01-09 19:50:49 UTC <Nailersfan91> We encourage Americans to waste food, water, and energy because it is good for the nation!
950803485863415810 2018-01-09 18:56:30 UTC <Nailersfan91> Good ol culture warrior values are good for the nation. Keep that in mind.
950796219223367680 2018-01-09 18:27:38 UTC <Nailersfan91> Diabetes is a retirement activity of the poor! I am America.
950795025289547778 2018-01-09 18:22:53 UTC <Nailersfan91> I love wasting food, water, and energy. Dont tell me I can only water three of my lawns! If I wanna water four thats my right as an American!
950794558794813442 2018-01-09 18:21:02 UTC <Nailersfan91> It would be beneficial for states to lower taxes on cigarettes in order to spur economic growth. According to experts, cigarettes are not as bad as what you think. Check the facts.
950788750870761474 2018-01-09 17:57:57 UTC <Nailersfan91> @PumpRules Ms Cartwright is a true heartland American. A true family values person. Keep her on vr. For the sake of America.
950756928384364545 2018-01-09 15:51:30 UTC <Nailersfan91> The tax cuts mean bigger paychecks, more jobs, and a better overall economy. Lower taxes mean more charity and more small business growth.
950754276162310144 2018-01-09 15:40:58 UTC <Nailersfan91> Countless documentaries have proven fema camps to be real however they have changed the name of them.
950753311585644545 2018-01-09 15:37:08 UTC <Nailersfan91> FEMA camps are real, its what theyre being used for is the question. There is so much evidence out there.
950750088107823110 2018-01-09 15:24:19 UTC <Nailersfan91> Republicans should focus on an infrastructure project as it is popular with Americans and will create jobs. Winning strategy for November.
950735812357967875 2018-01-09 14:27:36 UTC <Nailersfan91> When it comes to the opioid situation in this country, have people ever heard of not doing drugs? Have they ever heard of it? The system should do nothing.
950724994774044673 2018-01-09 13:44:37 UTC <Nailersfan91> The culture war in America is raging and We heartland Americans will win.
950716545025617920 2018-01-09 13:11:02 UTC <Nailersfan91> After long term scientific studies it has been proven that pot is extremely dangerous, deadly from fentanyl addictive, and a depressant. Enforce drug laws. Dont legalize pot on any level.
950701496194170880 2018-01-09 12:11:14 UTC <Nailersfan91> Right to work nationwide would be great for jobs and the economy.
950699641649160194 2018-01-09 12:03:52 UTC <Nailersfan91> After years of extensive research and investigation, we dont believe we made it to the moon. So many inconsistencies.
950509621290168320 2018-01-08 23:28:47 UTC <Nailersfan91> We the heartland America believe in zero government, zero taxes, and lots of guns. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps.
950505991543623682 2018-01-08 23:14:22 UTC <Nailersfan91> @VanderpumpRules This is culture war by Ms. Kent insulting Trump supporters, the good ol folks, the heartland, real Americans. Promote family culture warrior values. Trumps goin git r done!
950353129077342209 2018-01-08 13:06:57 UTC <Nailersfan91> @VanderpumpRules Promote Heartland American family values, pay workers minimum wage, and become a fast food chain. That will help. It is the American way. Good times ahead with this idea.
950348685438869504 2018-01-08 12:49:17 UTC <Nailersfan91> We encourage everyone to watch the Moon Landing Conspiracy documentary from National Geographic.
950339426072264705 2018-01-08 12:12:30 UTC <Nailersfan91> Family values are the most important to ones educational, intellectual, and personal development.
950149713910747136 2018-01-07 23:38:39 UTC <Nailersfan91> @PumpRules should promote heartland family values. Thats what makes America number one.
950145884666433536 2018-01-07 23:23:26 UTC <Nailersfan91> Family values are important and will carry heartland America across the finish line in the culture war.
950099733795737600 2018-01-07 20:20:03 UTC <Nailersfan91> We the Heartland Americans will fight for family values to win the culture war.
