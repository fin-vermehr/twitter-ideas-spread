970603494922227712 2018-03-05 10:14:40 UTC <ItsBabybop> @mandiefressh I think this is more of an authoritarian problem than an anti-male problem tbh. The whole kids need order rhetoric.

962758207348334592 2018-02-11 18:40:18 UTC <ItsBabybop> @DireWolfMedia I mean I definitely agree with some of the points she makes, but I dont think she is a good representative of feminism. She talks a lot about equality in the Middle East, which is great, but there are issues here too and I think she ignores this.
962756365650415617 2018-02-11 18:32:59 UTC <ItsBabybop> @DireWolfMedia I cant call myself a fan of Sommers after she involved herself with gamergate tbh

962745567465164801 2018-02-11 17:50:04 UTC <ItsBabybop> @DireWolfMedia I agree about intersectional feminism though. It goes beyond the literal definition of feminism. I believe in racial equality and I support LGBT rights, but for some reason every type of extremism gets welded into a blurry type of feminism and we get a bad rap
962744683389734912 2018-02-11 17:46:34 UTC <ItsBabybop> @DireWolfMedia I mean I agreed with your comment (and yes, I understood the sarcasm) and Im a feminist. I think its unfair to judge an entire movement based on the most extreme views within that movement.
962743766707834880 2018-02-11 17:42:55 UTC <ItsBabybop> Seeing users with anti-feminism or I hate feminism in the bio liking my tweets is so sad and misled.

962742848763387904 2018-02-11 17:39:16 UTC <ItsBabybop> @DireWolfMedia The feminist kind. Apparently Im going against my own values lol
962740879030042624 2018-02-11 17:31:27 UTC <ItsBabybop> @DireWolfMedia Thats what I figured, you didnt strike me as a hardcore conservative or a misogynist. I agree with you about SJWs and yet I ended up on the opposite side. Have you heard of MGTOW? Return of Kings? Chateau Heartiste? Those seem like bigger threats to equality at the moment.
962659844837838848 2018-02-11 12:09:27 UTC <ItsBabybop> Apparently Im racist, a right-winger, and an anti-feminist now guyspic.twitter.com/iWY8ejmwbF

962633619788435456 2018-02-11 10:25:14 UTC <ItsBabybop> @DireWolfMedia This has literally nothing to do with feminism
962629983347920896 2018-02-11 10:10:47 UTC <ItsBabybop> @RantingF I know there are MRAs who are anti-feminist. Just like there are feminists who are anti-mens rights.
962629116930547718 2018-02-11 10:07:20 UTC <ItsBabybop> @RantingF Paul Elam is involved in the whole red pill movement which is separate from mens rights and is literally just a trad movement. Ive never heard of Dean Esmay and I cant find anything linking him to the mens rights movement. He just seems like a psycho lol
962627121297412097 2018-02-11 09:59:25 UTC <ItsBabybop> @RantingF Im not your hun. And which MRAs are you referring to? (And I mean MRA, not meninism, MGTOW, or anything like that because those groups have nothing to do with mens rights.)
962625574681370624 2018-02-11 09:53:16 UTC <ItsBabybop> @RantingF I agree that some MRAs and MRA groups do this. The core of the mens rights movement is still mens rights, not feminist-bashing. This is very similar to when anti-feminists stereotype the entire feminist movement as being hateful and misandristic.
962624305300492288 2018-02-11 09:48:13 UTC <ItsBabybop> @RantingF You can be a feminist and still take an active interest in mens issues.
962623580730281984 2018-02-11 09:45:20 UTC <ItsBabybop> @RantingF That shows how much you know me and my views  Im very much on the left. Left-libertarian, technically. Im surprised you didnt pick up on that from my shot at organized religion.
962622612655493120 2018-02-11 09:41:30 UTC <ItsBabybop> @RantingF Lol. *I* personally judge them? I dont even know you wtf

962548519058989058 2018-02-10 04:47:04 UTC <ItsBabybop> @RantingF This is comparing a race to a religion. Ban all Christians would have made a better point but everything has to be a race issue for it to be taken seriously by most progressives

960730804803563520 2018-02-05 04:24:08 UTC <ItsBabybop> @JustLiz65 @FunniesPolitics I'll be the first to admit that I am not a "typical" female. I'm not very social, my hobbies mostly consist of "guy stuff," and I chose criminal justice over social work. But locking all women or all men into a gender role is personal. I'm glad we can at least sort of agree
960720813166129152 2018-02-05 03:44:25 UTC <ItsBabybop> @JustLiz65 @FunniesPolitics We dont have to agree. Im just trying to explain that I know from my own experiences that not all women are suited for a typical wife and mother lifestyle. But maybe Im a rare exception and this could be why I dont have many female friends

960717731162189824 2018-02-05 03:32:11 UTC <ItsBabybop> @JustLiz65 @FunniesPolitics Well yes, Im not denying that. Men typically have better spatial skills where as women are better multitaskers, for example. I dont think this translates into gender roles.
960716722075521026 2018-02-05 03:28:10 UTC <ItsBabybop> @thenodshow @JHerTe I saw Eminem and thought red = best. Listen to Rap God. Im done with this chart jfc

960714319326564353 2018-02-05 03:18:37 UTC <ItsBabybop> @JustLiz65 @FunniesPolitics I agree with all of that. But I hope that you will consider the possibility that men and women dont have predetermined roles. There is virtually no difference in IQ and there is no factual evidence saying that men and women are always better suited for different things.
960708864982355969 2018-02-05 02:56:57 UTC <ItsBabybop> @JustLiz65 @FunniesPolitics I think it is sexist, and it reflects badly on society. Societal gender roles and the influence of organized religion are to blame for a lack of female leadership, not some biological function that only men have.
960704833564086272 2018-02-05 02:40:56 UTC <ItsBabybop> @JustLiz65 @FunniesPolitics If you cant see where Im coming from then please look up Roosh V, MGTOW, and Chateau Heartiste. Better yet, just search feminism on 4chan.
960704398686150656 2018-02-05 02:39:12 UTC <ItsBabybop> @JustLiz65 @FunniesPolitics I said there is a handful of people that I personally hate or at least strongly dislike. Roosh V (a POC) and Candace Cameron Bure (a woman) are at the top of that list.
960703771331497984 2018-02-05 02:36:42 UTC <ItsBabybop> @JustLiz65 @FunniesPolitics Thats where we disagree. My idea of a gentleman is a guy who respects and does not use women. Ive found that guys who use girls for sex (the opposite of gentlemen) are typically very sexist and support the idea that men are leaders and women are followers
960702524864040961 2018-02-05 02:31:45 UTC <ItsBabybop> @JustLiz65 @FunniesPolitics Again, do you have factual evidence that men prefer to work and women prefer to stay home? Because my guess is that you read it on MGTOW or ROK
960702211104935936 2018-02-05 02:30:30 UTC <ItsBabybop> @JustLiz65 @FunniesPolitics Actually, you brought up gender roles in your original comment. And saying that feminist liberals hate white men is a very broad and inaccurate statement. There is a handful of people I would say I hate and it is because of their worldview, not their race/gender.

960698509140819968 2018-02-05 02:15:48 UTC <ItsBabybop> @JustLiz65 @FunniesPolitics So then what is your issue with people who want to close the gap between gender roles? Could you give an example of this man-hating you keep bringing up?
960697111846277126 2018-02-05 02:10:15 UTC <ItsBabybop> @JustLiz65 @FunniesPolitics Also, how does women wanting to be breadwinners = pushing men out? How about we all follow our personal life goals regardless of gender
960696657049477120 2018-02-05 02:08:26 UTC <ItsBabybop> @JustLiz65 @FunniesPolitics Can you pull up any sort of study or statistics on this? If thats the case then I guess I fall into the minority because Ive never been very interested in having kids or being a housewife. I didnt even play with baby dolls as a kid. *shrug*

We have always mainly just hung out, which does not require money. When we do go out, I probably do pay about half the time, but we dont keep track or anything because its so rare
960680156485619712 2018-02-05 01:02:52 UTC <ItsBabybop> @JustLiz65 @FunniesPolitics The tradition of men paying is based on the gender role than men automatically = providers. I obviously dont support that, because women are also capable of being providers while some men are more comfortable staying at home.
960679009028902912 2018-02-05 00:58:18 UTC <ItsBabybop> @JustLiz65 @FunniesPolitics I absolutely do not agree that a man should pay any more often than a woman at any time. Not sure where you got that idea...
960478006606168064 2018-02-05 11:39:36 UTC <ItsBabybop> @Showtime Life Lesson #2: this is exactly how to get people to stop watching the only good show you currently have. I stopped watching HBO (had no choice) and you guys will probably be next unfortunately

I personally find it immature when a guy takes that as an attack on his masculinity. I still dont see how this = man hating

960293706812284928 2018-02-04 23:27:15 UTC <ItsBabybop> @JustLiz65 @FunniesPolitics So by that logic, the girl should pay if she asks the guy out. There is no reason that the guy should be expected to pay 100% of the time. When my boyfriend and I go out, I pay when I can. He isnt uncomfortable with it because he isnt mentally 15

960257983434420224 2018-02-04 21:05:18 UTC <ItsBabybop> @JustLiz65 @FunniesPolitics I dont hate men. Gender roles are harmful to men too, not just women. Men rarely get custody, they get fucked over in a divorce, theyre expected to pay on dates, they have way less of a safety net, all because theyre dudes.

957676938524585984 2018-01-28 18:09:09 UTC <ItsBabybop> @ArmouredSkeptic @shoe0nhead This has been the definition of feminism since, like, forever. As long as women can be MRAs, men can be feminists. I dont see the issue
957676709666545664 2018-01-28 18:08:15 UTC <ItsBabybop> Feminists: literally anyone who believes in gender equality is a feminist Radfems: nooo youre not a REAL feminist unless youre 100% progressive on every issue #Feminism #genderequality
957597069358895106 2018-01-28 12:51:47 UTC <ItsBabybop> I still dont understand what the fuck happened to the Bush era and early Obama era skeptics. Did yall split up or just sort of move on orpic.twitter.com/KY9ffpN2aF
957592642023501824 2018-01-28 12:34:11 UTC <ItsBabybop> @shoe0nhead If thats what MOST women prefer, thats fine. What pisses me off is the narrative of all women are programmed to be social and good with kids and if they go into anything besides teaching or social work they are lying to themselves
957590932211294208 2018-01-28 12:27:24 UTC <ItsBabybop> @TheTylt All of you guys saying Melania: why? What has she done that is so great? Do you actually like her for her, or do you just like Trump?

957196803887296512 2018-01-27 10:21:16 UTC <ItsBabybop> @shoe0nhead @kuriersechs The one thing I did notice in an all female class was that everyone was very hesitant. There was a lot of I feel like... and is it weird to...? type speak. Im more on the straightforward side and never really fit into that dynamic
957193326859517952 2018-01-27 10:07:27 UTC <ItsBabybop> The only political thing I really post about is gender equality but the issue that infuriates me the most is child abuse. Especially when people think its justified. Stop putting poison in your kids mouths, hitting them, and screaming at them in public kbye

957187498760916992 2018-01-27 09:44:18 UTC <ItsBabybop> @shoe0nhead Im majoring in criminal justice and my classes are usually like 30-40% girls, its a nice start

Some people dont want to pay for education because they dont like what kids are taught. We dont get to choose what we pay for based on personal beliefs. If we did, that would be charity.

There are some feminists that completely fucking disgust me. Annaliese Nielsen, for example. And I acknowledge that these women are feminists. It doesnt mean the entire movement is horrible.
956104078454673409 2018-01-24 09:59:10 UTC <ItsBabybop> @oyimgoyim Sites which refer to Laura Loomer as conservative, alt-right, or far-right: Wikipedia, Gizmodo, The Times of Israel, RationalWiki, NBC, and many more

956100602563620866 2018-01-24 09:45:21 UTC <ItsBabybop> @shoe0nhead @theothermindset @oyimgoyim If she was generally known for having feminist views and was associated with a feminist network, then yes. This chick used to be on Rebel Media

Then I watched her stand up for female breadwinners and LGBT couples. I watched her completely trash her reputation by calling Trump out on his sexist bullshit. I truly believe she has changed.

955258794040266752 2018-01-21 02:00:19 UTC <ItsBabybop> @TalTheGemini @KB_THE_QUEEN I've never heard a feminist say, "women of color don't belong in the feminist movement" or "LGBTQ women don't belong in the feminist movement." It's all subjective. In fact I was recently called a "white feminist" for saying I think it's okay for white girls to wear cornrows lol
955256828925005825 2018-01-21 01:52:30 UTC <ItsBabybop> @people @aprilbaby744 She literally made fun of the fact that Melania cares about cyberbullying. Why does that make you love her?
955219474558447616 2018-01-21 23:24:04 UTC <ItsBabybop> @TalTheGemini @KB_THE_QUEEN 1. Not just my definition. The dictionary definition. 2. I'm not even sure who this sign is referring to? I just think it's shitty to go to the Women's March with a salty sign directed at other feminists (whether you or the OP considers them to be "real" feminists or not)
955218222185361408 2018-01-21 23:19:05 UTC <ItsBabybop> @TalTheGemini @KB_THE_QUEEN You don't get to dictate an entire movement or decide who is and isn't a "real" feminist.
955216994495877125 2018-01-21 23:14:13 UTC <ItsBabybop> @TalTheGemini @KB_THE_QUEEN Feminism is its own movement. While everyone should be progressive and support the groups listed on this sign, a feminist is, by definition, a person who thinks that women should be equal to men. That's literally it.
955183090682466304 2018-01-21 20:59:29 UTC <ItsBabybop> @mbti4ever wtf is this
955182735236255751 2018-01-21 20:58:05 UTC <ItsBabybop> @TalTheGemini Obviously it's important to support & empower all women. But you literally went to the Women's March with a sign calling other feminists trash

954585795142279168 2018-01-19 05:26:03 UTC <ItsBabybop> @papiphat @actresslut Well some people would disagree with you on that because those artists have been called culture vultures and similar things.

953840862232014848 2018-01-17 04:05:57 UTC <ItsBabybop> @tteoks I literally just said I would not call them progressive
953839903468646400 2018-01-17 04:02:09 UTC <ItsBabybop> @tteoks I have, and I think calling those groups progressive is a bit of a stretch, especially TERFs. Someone can promote white feminism without knowing it, but TERFs are pretty much just feminists who don't recognize trans people as their preferred gender.
953838732179857408 2018-01-17 03:57:29 UTC <ItsBabybop> @tteoks Standing up for other groups does not equal dismissing black issues and the oppression of PoC. The "white liberal" and "snowflake" labels imply that people who care about these issues are just whiny and sensitive, rather than actually caring about others
953837972738146304 2018-01-17 03:54:28 UTC <ItsBabybop> @tteoks I don't think you'll find a single progressive feminist or LGBTQ person, or progressive in general who does not advocate for people of color
953836693760757761 2018-01-17 03:49:23 UTC <ItsBabybop> @tteoks These groups I mentioned are labeled as "liberal snowflakes" and are not prioritized. The progressive movement is one movement in support of every demographic that faces discrimination, and dividing ourselves up is only going to give the GOP and alt-right more power.
953835470789730304 2018-01-17 03:44:32 UTC <ItsBabybop> @tteoks If you had read the entire thread, you would know that I was standing up for groups that get shit on or ignored by so-called progressives. ESPECIALLY feminists + the LGBTQ community. The issues they care about are often dismissed by people who claim to share their values.
953834171771875328 2018-01-17 03:39:22 UTC <ItsBabybop> @tteoks Well I am a democratic socialist, not a communist. So we have different ideologies. I was also referring to social issues in my OP, so this communism vs. socialism argument is irrelevant

953802275427901441 2018-01-17 01:32:37 UTC <ItsBabybop> @tteoks Individualism is literally the concept behind social progression. The idea that people should be able to live how they want even if others don't share their values. This is the concept behind LGBTQ rights, feminism, etc. Without individualism, we would pretty much be a theocracy.

PoC, feminists, LGBTQ people, fundamentalists, the alt-right, and now back to progressives. She is trying to play 2 roles at once (tradservative and libertarian) and its not working.

My guess is that feminists have publicly shown their support, but the media has yet to pick up on it. I don't see why any feminist would oppose the protests in Iran.
951013100358160384 2018-01-10 08:49:26 UTC <ItsBabybop> @thewhiteguy1223 Who are you to say if someone is "really" a victim? Do you know any of these women personally and can you confirm with absolute certainty that they have NEVER been the victim of sexual assault or sexual harassment?
950931050447982593 2018-01-09 03:23:24 UTC <ItsBabybop> @NotACuckNation @oniiversee If you dont believe me about the right being problematic then look up Roosh V, Chateau Heartiste, and Traditionalist Worker Party. All of them legitimately think that women only exist to reproduce and serve men. This is an issue.
950929394813624320 2018-01-09 03:16:49 UTC <ItsBabybop> @NotACuckNation @oniiversee Oh and facebook
950929206522843137 2018-01-09 03:16:04 UTC <ItsBabybop> @NotACuckNation @oniiversee To some extent, but I would definitely say that the extreme right is more problematic. You also have to go on very specific sites to find SJWs where as the alt-right currently has control of youtube, 4chan, Reddit, and indie forums.
950923484057755649 2018-01-09 02:53:20 UTC <ItsBabybop> @NotACuckNation @oniiversee I mean, I identify as an egalitarian as well. But most feminists are sane people. The extreme right just likes to take the worst of the worst and make us all look crazy. You should give us a chance 
950922458693013504 2018-01-09 02:49:16 UTC <ItsBabybop> @NotACuckNation @oniiversee Yes, people within a group can have differing opinions.

950921873134669824 2018-01-09 02:46:56 UTC <ItsBabybop> @NotACuckNation @oniiversee 3) The wave gap does exist, but it exists because women are not working as much as men. This is still a feminist issue; its just one that is 100% up to women to fix.
950921397236371464 2018-01-09 02:45:03 UTC <ItsBabybop> @NotACuckNation @oniiversee 1) Well yes. Its a movement about womens issues. Just like how Mens Rights is about mens issues, BLM is about black issues, etc.  2) I agree that the whole manspreading  thing is stupid. Mansplaining refers to men who try to condescendingly explain womens issues to women.
950874785969557504 2018-01-09 23:39:50 UTC <ItsBabybop> @NotACuckNation @oniiversee Well it shouldnt be a whole different conversation. What are your issues with feminism?

950873610436136960 2018-01-09 23:35:09 UTC <ItsBabybop> @NotACuckNation @oniiversee If you really dont understand how referring to the entire progressive movement as cucks is misogynistic then ok 
950873047686438913 2018-01-09 23:32:55 UTC <ItsBabybop> @NotACuckNation @oniiversee I know what cuck means. I have also been paying attention to how it is being used lately.

950869824137285632 2018-01-09 23:20:07 UTC <ItsBabybop> @thewhiteguy1223 Just because the #METOO movement is taking all the publicity right now doesnt mean we dont also support them.
950869362709286913 2018-01-09 23:18:17 UTC <ItsBabybop> @thewhiteguy1223 I support them 100%. I think most if not all feminists do. Iranian women should absolutely not be required by law to wear a hijab. They should not be kept from driving or going out on their own, either. How is this not painfully obvious?
950867525646147586 2018-01-09 23:10:59 UTC <ItsBabybop> @NotACuckNation @oniiversee I literally just explained that the alt-right uses it to refer to any man who isnt a misogynist. Its very similar to beta which is another silly term made popular by trolls.

950721492119154688 2018-01-09 13:30:41 UTC <ItsBabybop> @NotACuckNation @oniiversee The alt-right uses the derogatory term cuck to refer to any male who respects women or cares about womens issues. I think it originated in the redpill/MGTOW community which is very misogynistic. Do your research pls

949993707071295488 2018-01-07 13:18:44 UTC <ItsBabybop> @The_GrumpyBrit I gave the obvious example of murderers and rapists, but there are less extreme acts of hate as well. There are people who think women should not be breadwinners, gay people should not get married, and all immigrants should be deported. And these beliefs are becoming common.
949993276962164737 2018-01-07 13:17:01 UTC <ItsBabybop> @The_GrumpyBrit How is this any different from you assuming that I am not a normal person just because Im liberal?

949968130159382528 2018-01-07 11:37:06 UTC <ItsBabybop> @The_GrumpyBrit Well at least you acknowledge the issue of police brutality. The UCR hate crime study was exclusive to the US, so only about 323 million people. No, one person or group cant police the world. But the issue is that rapists and murderers are often let off too easily.

949965690882097154 2018-01-07 11:27:24 UTC <ItsBabybop> @The_GrumpyBrit Well I would have to disagree since unarmed black people are still being killed by police, about 1/5 of people have been sexually assaulted, more than 6k crimes per year are classified as hate crimes, LGBTQ youths are being shipped off to horrific conversion therapy centers...
949963476230950912 2018-01-07 11:18:36 UTC <ItsBabybop> @The_GrumpyBrit Alt right basically = white nationalism. Everything they stand for ultimately leads back to their main goal of keeping western countries white with no diversity. Example: they dont want women to be educated because they want them to focus on producing/raising (white) children.
949962343542415360 2018-01-07 11:14:06 UTC <ItsBabybop> @The_GrumpyBrit Well then you dont know about Milo  Also, social progress means that less and less discriminatory words/actions will be tolerated over time. 50 years ago in the US, it was acceptable to use the N-word. People who had a problem with it probably got called over-sensitive too.

The LGBT community is being blamed for pedophilia. Black athletes are being called sons of bitches by POTUS for peaceful protesting. Sooo yeah
949316433309261826 2018-01-05 16:27:29 UTC <ItsBabybop> @WingedZs We care about those too. But unlike you guys we recognize that this country also has societal problems and inequality.

900038913376612357 2017-08-22 16:56:13 UTC <ItsBabybop> @TomiLahren There was a movement to remove a confederate flag on public property about 2 years ago. Also I don't think potus has that type of power.
900038155881132033 2017-08-22 16:53:12 UTC <ItsBabybop> @TomiLahren I agree. No one fights for their ideologies anymore. Everyone just claims to be oppressed. I miss the days of heated discussions and logic.

897435738890960896 2017-08-15 12:32:08 UTC <ItsBabybop> @hamsterwatch I was SO EXCITED to see a buff girl on the show. Why did she have to be a condescending snake who only cares about her brand?
897434502196285440 2017-08-15 12:27:13 UTC <ItsBabybop> @littlecaesars I look like a dumbass ordering the #ExtraMostBestest but it's so amazing
896745104584658944 2017-08-13 14:47:48 UTC <ItsBabybop> I fully support patriotism. But this is not patriotism; this is something much darker. #thisisnotus #Charlottesville

896038058059083777 2017-08-11 15:58:15 UTC <ItsBabybop> Glad I won't have to look at the mean girl's smug face anymore on #BB19 #ByeJessica
896021654207332352 2017-08-11 14:53:04 UTC <ItsBabybop> @NataliaNegrotti Elena made some good points, but why try to reason with Josh?
