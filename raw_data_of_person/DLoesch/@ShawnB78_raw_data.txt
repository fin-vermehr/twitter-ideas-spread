948017276091092993 2018-01-01 02:25:06 UTC <ShawnB78> HOW BOUT THEM DAWGS!!!!
945033187436187651 2017-12-24 20:47:24 UTC <ShawnB78> @SBNation This was far from the only bad call in that game. NFL officiating is an absolute joke.
945032711252664324 2017-12-24 20:45:30 UTC <ShawnB78> @680TheFan @CelliniNick I'm hoping for just that. This team is undisciplined, unfocused, and appears uncoached. Throw the joke that is officiating and I am ready for the season to be done. I hate the NFL right now.
945029190608400385 2017-12-24 20:31:31 UTC <ShawnB78> Your joke of officials are ruining your league. Go watch the tape of ALT/NO and count the bad calls. @NFL
943663250524332032 2017-12-20 02:03:45 UTC <ShawnB78> @247Sports @SBNationCFB @brentschmidt You removed any possibility of being taken seriously when you said "#1 drafted class".
925461228306169859 2017-10-31 20:35:25 UTC <ShawnB78> @RadiNabulsi Let them run their mouths...Dawgs will let their helmets do the talking
922087110898790400 2017-10-22 13:07:53 UTC <ShawnB78> @realDonaldTrump How can u not see u are tearing this country apart. BE A LEADER AND STOP ACTING LIKE A CHIKD WHO NEEDS THE LAST WORD!!!
895005181129129985 2017-08-08 19:33:58 UTC <ShawnB78> @TheFive @FoxNews It's called an EMP for those of you in the dark, which we will all be if this happens.
895004997188038659 2017-08-08 19:33:14 UTC <ShawnB78> @TheFive @FoxNews One of these, detonated 300 miles above middle of USA, ends our existence as we know it. Keep bickering Dems &Reps....morons.
894660278318759936 2017-08-07 20:43:26 UTC <ShawnB78> @realDonaldTrump The President of the USA wishing for the demise of an American owned business...
894291384626278401 2017-08-06 20:17:35 UTC <ShawnB78> @MattPowers31 I always thought Bobby had it right when he always put young guys in asap to make their debut.
893570241166548992 2017-08-04 20:32:01 UTC <ShawnB78> @BarackObama @Alyssa_Milano As a Libertarian and no fan of President Obama I never thought I would agree with this sentiment but I do. Good grief what has happened!?!?

879364496476819456 2017-06-26 15:43:28 UTC <ShawnB78> @payne_elias Exactly why I always buy a window seat
878018056596979712 2017-06-22 22:33:12 UTC <ShawnB78> @realDonaldTrump Or we help our neighbors rather than continue failed foreign policies on the other side of the world

863564710855286784 2017-05-13 01:20:45 UTC <ShawnB78> @DOBrienAJC Pitch counter is one of the worst things that has happened in MLB the last couple decades.
863206458275581952 2017-05-12 01:37:11 UTC <ShawnB78> @BillShanks From Macon area but out in Miss this weekend. Sitting behind home plate and Soroka is filthy! Started losing steam in 6th tho. Good game tho
863204150380818432 2017-05-12 01:28:01 UTC <ShawnB78> @leprekhan I am right behind home plate and dude is filthy. Looks to be losing a little steam in last inning or so tho
862466241633677313 2017-05-10 00:35:50 UTC <ShawnB78> @realDonaldTrump Pot, meet kettle
849563586464763905 2017-04-05 10:05:17 UTC <ShawnB78> @payne_elias Maybe they thought your taste in music sucks and we're trying to help you out.
849022745820237824 2017-04-03 22:16:11 UTC <ShawnB78> @payne_elias First few seasons, amazing. Last couple, terrible.
826179483967377408 2017-01-30 21:25:13 UTC <ShawnB78> @colecubelic @SethEmersonAJC And UGA finished in the top 25 only 3 times in last 8 seasons.
818886790136401920 2017-01-10 18:26:39 UTC <ShawnB78> @payne_elias If it happened when u plugged in your curling iron u probably tripped a breaker...

796213917521510400 2016-11-08 04:52:45 UTC <ShawnB78> @AceAwbrey30 @payne_elias unfortunately this isn't true so still looking for positives.
786752749010583552 2016-10-13 02:17:27 UTC <ShawnB78> @joe_sheehan how is that not a ball? Foot goes behind the rubber then lands toward home plate!
779471759389106177 2016-09-23 00:05:23 UTC <ShawnB78> @KevinMcAlpin horrible call. Of course no repercussions for an umpire who makes a call that isn't even close.
775131239212810240 2016-09-11 00:37:43 UTC <ShawnB78> @jemelehill @KateUpton or when unarmed blacks were killed by other blacks?

771751599861620737 2016-09-02 16:48:14 UTC <ShawnB78> @DM_Shirley @telegraphga Asking us to read all the way to the 2nd paragraph? Who do u think u are!?!  J/k
771347577048621058 2016-09-01 14:02:47 UTC <ShawnB78> @BillShanks Gotta send Swanson back to the minors and dump Kemp ASAP! The way the team has played the last few weeks is costing #1 pick! J/K
768631957030830080 2016-08-24 02:11:53 UTC <ShawnB78> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Trump sounds like such an idiot when speaking, but who is the bigger idiot? Trump or you, his lapdog?
759513604307779584 2016-07-30 22:18:49 UTC <ShawnB78> @BillShanks I say do it even if no money is involved. Braves keep saying they will spend money and Kemp is better player.
759196421119700992 2016-07-29 01:18:26 UTC <ShawnB78> @jaysonst come one Braves...take a chance with Puig!
759172377108439040 2016-07-29 23:42:54 UTC <ShawnB78> @jaysonst @Buster_ESPN hope Braves are third team and Puig goes there!
759122442128330752 2016-07-29 20:24:28 UTC <ShawnB78> @mcuban come to the center and vote Gary Johnson
759121732980572161 2016-07-29 20:21:39 UTC <ShawnB78> @RealMattlanta last series Dodgers came to town. Stadium was shaking with the chop and chants at Darryl Strawberry.
757262696777646080 2016-07-24 17:14:30 UTC <ShawnB78> @mcuban @raulmrueda @bhorowitz there are more than 2 running Mark...check out Johnson
755564741033074688 2016-07-19 00:47:26 UTC <ShawnB78> @PaulByrd36 @Braves @FOXSportsSE that pic tho....

749979815764172800 2016-07-04 14:54:56 UTC <ShawnB78> @steakshapiro @BostonGlobe heard Boston writer say on ESPN that signing African American is huge. When did Dominican become part of Africa?
749074089214668800 2016-07-01 02:55:54 UTC <ShawnB78> @BillShanks @MikeAScotto wow, still room for Horford or no?
749067685254791168 2016-07-01 02:30:27 UTC <ShawnB78> @JeffSchultzAJC @BostonGlobe he has sense something shifted, yep clear as mid that he knows about the Horford negotiations
749065246074101760 2016-07-01 02:20:46 UTC <ShawnB78> @JeffSchultzAJC @BostonGlobe it never says he knows anything about the Hawks/Horford negotiations. Stirring the pot cause u hate Howard
749063969155997698 2016-07-01 02:15:41 UTC <ShawnB78> @JeffSchultzAJC @rshawfx @SeanFrantom @CVivlamoreAJC they have the cap space for a max deal still.
747645620861698049 2016-06-27 04:19:41 UTC <ShawnB78> @RedSox @richardjustice Hoping they throw the house at the Braves for Tehran!
746138176775938048 2016-06-23 00:29:38 UTC <ShawnB78> @RealMattlanta so u thinking Teague traded for nothing of value.
745404393659367425 2016-06-21 23:53:51 UTC <ShawnB78> @BillShanks Loving having FM sports in Mid GA again! I'm in Roberta tho and the signal struggles in the morn riding to Macon. Must be solar

721137517240717316 2016-04-15 00:45:56 UTC <ShawnB78> @BillShanks I thought I was seeing things. What kinda idiot plays situational lefty in the 5th? A Frediot!
721134599531794438 2016-04-15 00:34:21 UTC <ShawnB78> @DOBrienAJC Frediot is trying to get fired. Absolute moronic not putting Mallex there and leaving him alone.
695019722786672642 2016-02-03 23:03:09 UTC <ShawnB78> @realDonaldTrump boo hoo
694489093896536064 2016-02-02 11:54:37 UTC <ShawnB78> @brithume cause he's nuts! Not as crazy as Trump but still nuts! We have nothing to choose from and this is scary.
