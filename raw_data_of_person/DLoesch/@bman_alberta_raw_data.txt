949669568892424192 2018-01-06 15:50:43 UTC <bman_alberta> @WBrettWilson @gaucoin13 Its not a silly question.  The rationale is that the goberment knows better than the individual and the business what the wage should be.  They dont better.  The CEO pay issue is entirely a separate issue, but the government has no damn right to dictate that, either.

914959745806516224 2017-10-02 21:06:17 UTC <bman_alberta> @TomArnold Why so rude?  People can disagree without being disagreeable, right?

910006837293936641 2017-09-18 05:05:11 UTC <bman_alberta> @SenSanders Bernie: health insurance is not the same as health care.  Ask Canadians about waiting lists.  Then be honest... for once.

907410889694949376 2017-09-11 01:09:49 UTC <bman_alberta> @Kathleen_Wynne Yes.  It's completely free!  Straight out of hardworking people's taxes!  That's Liberal free right there.

902047697015681024 2017-08-27 05:58:24 UTC <bman_alberta> @charlesadler Hey, Chuck. Love you, but you've got to stop obsessing about the Orange One.  You're deeper and more interesting than that.

901480899455336448 2017-08-26 16:26:09 UTC <bman_alberta> The deterioration of discourse is glaring and disturbing in this thread.  On both sides.  #sadhttps://twitter.com/bettemidler/status/901278591937368064
900839861929730049 2017-08-24 21:58:54 UTC <bman_alberta> @pbakhmut No. And many of us are, but they promised one thing and revoked bussing on an arbitrary basis.
900839082565160961 2017-08-24 21:55:48 UTC <bman_alberta> @leeboy8500 Oh. I'm with you.  I was just blurting out the inane counter-argument you'll get.

890975776488554496 2017-07-28 16:42:33 UTC <bman_alberta> @CTVCalgary This is a misleading headline.  In the clickbait world, the headline is all many will read.  Please review.

883726989437227009 2017-07-08 16:38:27 UTC <bman_alberta> @Blazingcatfur This is, in no way, "Canada's" apology.  It is from a small segment of virtue signalling do-gooders.
871164730248790016 2017-06-03 00:40:31 UTC <bman_alberta> @MichaelChongMP @PKCampbell78 @chisholmp You go ahead and believe that they will EVER cut any tax anywhere to make it revenue neutral.  Not gonna happen.
870885987894702081 2017-06-02 06:12:54 UTC <bman_alberta> @MichaelChongMP @PKCampbell78 @chisholmp The problem with government intervention is that "the point" is ALWAYS good.  Implementation is always a problem.
870844362539663360 2017-06-02 03:27:30 UTC <bman_alberta> @MichaelChongMP @Haidian83 Brilliant.  Anything to add?  Worthwhile, I mean.
870721610910621696 2017-06-02 19:19:43 UTC <bman_alberta> Sure @MichaelChongMP, government can solve the climate problem with subsidies, programs and crony capitalism.  Right.
844367186432946176 2017-03-21 01:56:39 UTC <bman_alberta> @UniteAlberta @jkenney I would like to see a tight list of principles to will govern with, ensuring you steer away from social issues.

832690510582026240 2017-02-17 20:37:43 UTC <bman_alberta> @MichaelChongMP @switzere Not at all.  In the words of Stephen Harper, we can disagree without being disagreeable.
832666814194675716 2017-02-17 19:03:33 UTC <bman_alberta> @MichaelChongMP @switzere He's going to get neither.  He will lose and marginalized the victor.  Ask Marco Rubio.

818897694747832320 2017-01-10 19:09:59 UTC <bman_alberta> Yup.  I guess our "social license" expired and our virtue signalling was just smoke and mirrors.  @jkenney @RachelNotleyhttps://twitter.com/jkenney/status/818873303892799488

796060160028393472 2016-11-08 18:41:46 UTC <bman_alberta> @MichaelChongMP Sure.  But decrease other taxation to keep overall taxes level.  Please let people keep the money they earned.
