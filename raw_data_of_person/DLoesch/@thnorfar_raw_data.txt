971218573162176512 2018-03-06 02:58:46 UTC <thnorfar> @historycomics Next month, schools are looking to be canceled. Im in Oklahoma and we are looking to go on strike like WVA.
971218233519943680 2018-03-06 02:57:25 UTC <thnorfar> Amen and Good Night everyone. Wonderful #worldgeochat I so enjoyed my time with you.https://twitter.com/Curiosity_Films/status/971218062522269698
971216478279225345 2018-03-06 02:50:27 UTC <thnorfar> @PhilipHopkins70 I have never not had a state test. I also never had less than 70% pass rate and my Ss are low. Suggest you start with one unit and see what happens from there. #worldgeochat
971212463231393793 2018-03-06 02:34:30 UTC <thnorfar> @suzieboss @Curiosity_Films @cheffernan75 @LFU_MissCox Nice!!! I am sure they were pumped after receiving feedback from them. #worldgeochat
971211889979088896 2018-03-06 02:32:13 UTC <thnorfar> A4: It is hard to find websites that inspire me for math projects. However, there are sites I love for supporting. kagan, teaching channel, edutopia, and texas instruments. #worldgeochat #PBL #PBLchat
971210947917438977 2018-03-06 02:28:28 UTC <thnorfar> @suzieboss Wow!!! Do you have more info on this? #worldgeochat
971210602969485313 2018-03-06 02:27:06 UTC <thnorfar> A3: This is such a good question. The biggest challenge I have faced is realizing my classroom culture wasnt right and it hindered the PBL. I am still studying how to build culture. Studying restorative circles right now. #worldgeochat
971210216913145857 2018-03-06 02:25:34 UTC <thnorfar> @mr_middle_2 You are on the road. That is all that matters. Jump on. #worldgeochat
971209345500434432 2018-03-06 02:22:06 UTC <thnorfar> I am getting so into reading comments. I missed Q2. #worldgeochat
971209018000707584 2018-03-06 02:20:48 UTC <thnorfar> @BIEpbl @SamMandeville They give so much stuff! #worldgeochat
971208639695474689 2018-03-06 02:19:18 UTC <thnorfar> A2: Also got to give a shout out to another one of my favorite authors on PBL. She is on this chat @suzieboss has too many books to name just go to amazon and type her name. She is good. #worldgeochat
971208362879746050 2018-03-06 02:18:12 UTC <thnorfar> A1: Forgot to say my favorite books. All BIE produced books are great. I also love Authentic Learning Experiences & by Dayna Laur and Developing Natural Curiosity through PBL for PreK to 3 by same author. #geoworldchat
971207330007273472 2018-03-06 02:14:06 UTC <thnorfar> @historycomics Hey, Tim. It is good to see you on this chat as well. #worldgeochat
971207099408699392 2018-03-06 02:13:11 UTC <thnorfar> @JohnHonish Welcome!! It is such a good model for learning content that needs depth. #worldgeochat #PBL
971206423651782656 2018-03-06 02:10:30 UTC <thnorfar> A1: I have been doing PBL since I started teaching. Not all good :). I love BIE training but I also attended IMSAs problem based training for a week and it was good as well. #worldgeochat #PBL #PBLchat
971205621080092672 2018-03-06 02:07:18 UTC <thnorfar> @ecasey77 Glad to be here! #worldgeochat
971205542562746369 2018-03-06 02:07:00 UTC <thnorfar> @Curiosity_Films Hi, my friend. Dual tasking. On a zoom meeting as well :)
971204329486127105 2018-03-06 02:02:10 UTC <thnorfar> Hello #worldgeochat. I am a math T from Oklahoma City. Glad to join the chat tonight.
971054911008931840 2018-03-06 16:08:26 UTC <thnorfar> @KimLanders2 $10
971009495236272130 2018-03-06 13:07:58 UTC <thnorfar> @MrP_tchr As a math T, I find it interesting that WVs median income is more than ours but their Ts income is more than their median. Our Ts salary isnt even close to our median. Also noted that they pay for their insurance which means they are probably making low 30s.
971007781947002881 2018-03-06 13:01:10 UTC <thnorfar> @KimLanders2 You coming to state!! We have t-shirts 
971001557792821248 2018-03-06 12:36:26 UTC <thnorfar> @TulsaSchools Thank you board of @OKCPS for standing and fighting for Ts!
970846919663718401 2018-03-05 02:21:57 UTC <thnorfar> A2: I need help organizing my NOs. There is not enough organizing when you do too many things. Still trying to recognize the best from the good. #ksedchat
970846026327261185 2018-03-05 02:18:24 UTC <thnorfar> @aewatkins8 Amen to that! #ksedchat
970845258727723010 2018-03-05 02:15:21 UTC <thnorfar> @alilynnp One of the best Jimmy Falon Lyric competitions! I watch it during breaks all the time. #ksedchat
970844449227132928 2018-03-05 02:12:08 UTC <thnorfar> A1: I can see it being in the top ten. It is easy to say testing but I think we were stressed out before the tests. Ss have a lot going on and I carry some of their burdens because they cant. #ksedchat
970844090811277312 2018-03-05 02:10:43 UTC <thnorfar> @thepankopost Glad to join you tonight. #ksedchat
970843453071482880 2018-03-05 02:08:11 UTC <thnorfar> @heather_newkirk Great way to describe our profession. #ksedchat
970843132949684225 2018-03-05 02:06:54 UTC <thnorfar> @theReedingLMS She rocked the oscars for sure. #ksedchat
970842884550340608 2018-03-05 02:05:55 UTC <thnorfar> @mrvesco Glad to be here.
970842842435342336 2018-03-05 02:05:45 UTC <thnorfar> @mrvesco That brought me back. Thanks for that reminder of an oldie but a goodie. #ksedchat
970842273134104576 2018-03-05 02:03:29 UTC <thnorfar> High School Math T in Oklahoma City joining the #ksedchat. I love Thats what I like by Bruno Mars to get me going.
970492770656940034 2018-03-04 02:54:42 UTC <thnorfar> Gotta go my friends. Time for my medicine. See you next week. #oklaed
970491919867445248 2018-03-04 02:51:19 UTC <thnorfar> A7: PD is when I have a question and I get multiple answers. I PD at work w/my PLC, during twitter chats (#oklaed, #sunchat & #ksedchat) as well as starting to do a little on facebook.
970491030268149760 2018-03-04 02:47:47 UTC <thnorfar> A6: Using Twitter and facebook to collaborate. I would like to still grow in using them for efficiently. #oklaed
970489266626355200 2018-03-04 02:40:46 UTC <thnorfar> Whoops. I meant to say include not I could. That is what I get for watching the oscars and typing LOL #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/thnorfar/status/970488370521616385
970488675007188993 2018-03-04 02:38:25 UTC <thnorfar> @TeachFromHere Dont tell me that! I am still hurt that I was sick and had to miss it. #oklaed
970488370521616385 2018-03-04 02:37:12 UTC <thnorfar> A5: If I could emails and tweets, I read about 60% of my day. If you are talking about traditional reading, it is more like 5 LOL #oklaed
970488070960271360 2018-03-04 02:36:01 UTC <thnorfar> @MsShelton5th @DrTerriC @jwalkup true but I am the bomb! LOL. Seriously, in this case it was just a few times but many times it is a presenter issue. #oklaed
970487718751895553 2018-03-04 02:34:37 UTC <thnorfar> @mrjoshflores That was a good one!! I am laughing and coughing. #oklaed
970487574266605569 2018-03-04 02:34:03 UTC <thnorfar> A4: Share it in our PLC meetings, other professional meetings, twitter and even old school email sometimes #oklaed
970486856826720256 2018-03-04 02:31:12 UTC <thnorfar> @MsShelton5th @DrTerriC @jwalkup I think it is just like students. They assume the material is not valuable and tune it out. Unfortunately, they are also like Ss in that they dont even get a chance first. #oklaed
970486488164130817 2018-03-04 02:29:44 UTC <thnorfar> @kriscoop80 @mcappsparks It took me off guard for a minute as well. I guess it is an inside joke. #oklaed
970485840047636482 2018-03-04 02:27:09 UTC <thnorfar> A3: During the day, we concentrate on the 4?s from PLC. After hours, we talk about everything! #oklaed
970485519783251973 2018-03-04 02:25:53 UTC <thnorfar> @MrGragg True but there are a lot of occurrence on Twitter, after school and weekends. Although I dont drink, I like the way it reveals people to me #oklaed
970485189242707970 2018-03-04 02:24:34 UTC <thnorfar> @andredaughty I have no problem being THAT guy. Especially since it was @TeachFromHere! I know he can take my sarcasm in word form #oklaed
970484697439637507 2018-03-04 02:22:37 UTC <thnorfar> I find it interesting how many people need a beverage to collaborate. No one said an alcoholic one LOL. #oklaedpic.twitter.com/8e4ZCfApaF
970484191761747968 2018-03-04 02:20:36 UTC <thnorfar> @TeachFromHere HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA #oklaed
970484081376092160 2018-03-04 02:20:10 UTC <thnorfar> @MsShelton5th I had that happen at a training I was doing last week. A few people were so off task. Adults can be worse than kids sometimes #oklaed
970483824835604481 2018-03-04 02:19:09 UTC <thnorfar> A2: I need structure but like to have a part where we can add things we need that are not planned. I also need to hear all voices #oklaed
970483511022051328 2018-03-04 02:17:54 UTC <thnorfar> @TeachFromHere Who are you collaborating with???? #sunchat
970483233413566464 2018-03-04 02:16:48 UTC <thnorfar> A2: I forgot to say how it mystery connect with my collaboration. There is always something I discover when I am with people. There used to e a lot of drama in that people exaggerated what kids do #sunchat
970481225000542208 2018-03-04 02:08:49 UTC <thnorfar> I really love mysteries!! It translates in my classroom too as I have students discover items a lot #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/mrjoshflores/status/970480767745830912
970480969210789888 2018-03-04 02:07:48 UTC <thnorfar> This was the full answer: ENTREPRENEUR PERSONALITY (ESTP, -A/-T) #oklaed
970480849971044352 2018-03-04 02:07:19 UTC <thnorfar> Ohh. I am an entrepreneur from my results. #oklaed
970480701282897927 2018-03-04 02:06:44 UTC <thnorfar> Hi, #oklaed I am still under the weather but dying for a PD fix so I am joining you as a pop cough drops. Math T at NWC in OKCPS.
970452151142092800 2018-03-04 00:13:17 UTC <thnorfar> @jlgathright I missed you guys too. Just told @thestephhinton how I got up still trying to go to all my events but barely making it. My husband guided me back to the bed.
970316938261000193 2018-03-04 15:16:00 UTC <thnorfar> @bethctech @inspire0818 @huntoon23 You too!!!
970315077269295104 2018-03-04 15:08:36 UTC <thnorfar> @bethctech @huntoon23 @inspire0818 I started it by asking you if the people who did this to you were older. It was a question not a statement and that is how people started responding. It was to me not to you.
970313634013425664 2018-03-04 15:02:52 UTC <thnorfar> @PMcPeake1 @juliepile please help me w/creating a parent camp at my school! I am a high school teacher in a school that is high poverty and very diverse (36 languages this year. Sometimes over 45). Really would like the parents to feel welcome and involved.
970312986182250502 2018-03-04 15:00:18 UTC <thnorfar> @cybraryman1 @ShiftParadigm @coachjmsmith @ADawnMericle1 I follow #mathchat. It is not broken down that specifically but elementary Math Ts are there. #Sunchat
970312114349989888 2018-03-04 14:56:50 UTC <thnorfar> @bethctech @inspire0818 That is horrible! I forgot to say that earlier when you posted. Dont let the laughter stop your message though. I have experienced laugh, boos and other not so pleasant responses. Didnt let it stop me and now they are the ones who are silent. #Sunchat
970311614309326848 2018-03-04 14:54:51 UTC <thnorfar> @bethctech @susankotch I thought I was the only one. I probably shouldnt use the words not a fan. Its more of I hate it perpetuates the worksheet model which needs to change. Thought of putting my stuff out there to help change it #Sunchat
970311308716494849 2018-03-04 14:53:38 UTC <thnorfar> @PreFirstRocks You have a lot of people you are following and are following you! I have to admit. I think part of my problem is I am following too many people. #Sunchat
970310779688964096 2018-03-04 14:51:32 UTC <thnorfar> @huntoon23 @inspire0818 Deal. #sunchat
970310335545700353 2018-03-04 14:49:46 UTC <thnorfar> @inspire0818 @bethctech @huntoon23 I have a good friend who is a T as well. We are each others accountability partners. We R responsible for telling each other when we need to leave the profession if we dont recognize it ourselves. If we stop growing, we gotta get out. #sunchat
970309581439225856 2018-03-04 14:46:46 UTC <thnorfar> @inspire0818 @bethctech YES!!! I love when I run into teachers who are my age and still committed to life long learning and growth. Some of my colleagues are not and they wont take my applications for other jobs #sunchat
970309294003576833 2018-03-04 14:45:37 UTC <thnorfar> @inspire0818 @huntoon23 LOL!!!!! So true. I'm older! I used to think it was just an older problem. I know it is not an age thing but it makes me feel good to think it is something that will go away if it was just an older problem. #Sunchat
970308718368886785 2018-03-04 14:43:20 UTC <thnorfar> @nowisagreattime @DennisDill That is such a good point. I had took on this idea but got caught up on other people seeming to not miss anything. Started to think I was wrong. Then I saw how much they are on their phone and I was likeNaaahhh. I want to live eyes up not down. #sunchat
970308367720820736 2018-03-04 14:41:56 UTC <thnorfar> @mrclinefhs @huntoon23 That is such a good point. Have any tips for avoiding them. They are everywhere! #sunchat
970308070986350592 2018-03-04 14:40:46 UTC <thnorfar> @inspire0818 Please tell me it is older Ts that are saying this to you. I would hate for this to be a trend with younger educators. #Sunchat
970307160914751490 2018-03-04 14:37:09 UTC <thnorfar> @PMcPeake1 Parent Camp?? I havent heard of these. We offer certain workshops that are topic specific like FASFA. What is contained in a parent camp? Can I just google it :)?
970306652174987264 2018-03-04 14:35:07 UTC <thnorfar> @mistershayELA YES!!! That is exactly right! I have won the golden ticket at the willie wonka chocolate factory. #Sunchatpic.twitter.com/Cq57CXMOg4
970305776127537153 2018-03-04 14:31:39 UTC <thnorfar> @TweetDeck @nowisagreattime Mine came out of some relationships I had in person. I think it makes it more meaningful because we can connect in both places. #Sunchat
970305492013801472 2018-03-04 14:30:31 UTC <thnorfar> @MissWinegar It is what everyone has told me who has attended. I think because the presentations were voted on by the participants.
970305355866693632 2018-03-04 14:29:58 UTC <thnorfar> @PMcPeake1 I love the way you are a true partner. So many parents disconnect. I think because they dont know what to do. Any tips I can give parents #Sunchat
970305026580275203 2018-03-04 14:28:40 UTC <thnorfar> @JoyceMatthews_ Wow! Dont think I would have went in. #Sunchat
970304810149928961 2018-03-04 14:27:48 UTC <thnorfar> @nowisagreattime I have become a big tag person. I have my fav tags in @TweetDeck. About twice a week, I check them for what I missed. I also love that my closest people tag me in what they have discovered. I have a large PLN and then I have my ride or die PLN. #Sunchat
970304307915567105 2018-03-04 14:25:49 UTC <thnorfar> @MissWinegar Wow! you are going to have so much fun. #Sunchat
970304012636520449 2018-03-04 14:24:38 UTC <thnorfar> @mistershayELA I did start to make lists and tags I follow in TweetDeck. I also only have certain groups on my favs in Facebook. Problem is I have too many of that as well LOL #Sunchat
970303768511287298 2018-03-04 14:23:40 UTC <thnorfar> @bethctech @MrsPriceBuice I had that same problem my first few years of teaching and PLN wasnt a thing yet. I had a small group to hold me together. For the last year or two, I have gotten a lot of recognition so they dont say that anymore :).
970303338502918144 2018-03-04 14:21:57 UTC <thnorfar> @mrclinefhs I was just saying that! You read my mind. I think a new pitfall is thinking something someone shares that I know is trustworthy. Now I know it could be the Russians! #Sunchat
970302811182436354 2018-03-04 14:19:52 UTC <thnorfar> @CoachKCullen @Ms_A_Yeh That is something I am trying to remember. Wanting to do more Think-Write-Pair-Share for this reason. #sunchat
970302583792431104 2018-03-04 14:18:57 UTC <thnorfar> I would really love some help w/the pitfalls of PLN. For me is being on social media too much to where I miss things in life. The other is checking out and being overwhelmed by what I missed. #Sunchat
970302305068376067 2018-03-04 14:17:51 UTC <thnorfar> @bethctech @susankotch @mrclinefhs sent me the original prompt. It is about PLNs-the good and the bad basically :) #sunchat Thanks for responding @huntoon23
970302026386165761 2018-03-04 14:16:45 UTC <thnorfar> @bethctech @susankotch @mrclinefhs Thanks so much!
970301693165436929 2018-03-04 14:15:25 UTC <thnorfar> @mrclinefhs @bethctech I love that about this chat. More like a conversation that I can change or stay as I feel #sunchat
970301368467644416 2018-03-04 14:14:08 UTC <thnorfar> @bethctech @susankotch Joined late. Trying to find the basic topic. Is it about twitter or PLN in general #Sunchat
970300779801317377 2018-03-04 14:11:47 UTC <thnorfar> GM everyone. Math T at NWC in @OKCPS. Glad to see everyone at #Sunchat
970151715419893760 2018-03-03 04:19:28 UTC <thnorfar> @wfryer @vperezy @thestephhinton @rhondaschroeder @jlgathright @MPSTechnology @ebarnes73 @MrsBeck25 @MrRogersTech @TinaKpat Yeah! So glad you had a great day. I hate I was too sick and had to miss this year. The organizers of #EdCampOKC is the best in the world!

968781578137755648 2018-02-28 09:35:01 UTC <thnorfar> How a teacher feels when a student goes beyond their learning goals in a PBL. #PBLlifepic.twitter.com/T13pmkHYL1
968779548526632960 2018-02-28 09:26:58 UTC <thnorfar> If you are a T and have not looked into #NBCT, talk to me! It is one of the best PDs I have ever done. #oklaed is also very supportive through the process (including financially).https://twitter.com/oksde/status/968556423557865474
968649332969951232 2018-02-27 00:49:32 UTC <thnorfar> @participate @TeachSDGs @PolarBears @Analopez849 I take the challenge

967954685083770880 2018-02-25 02:49:15 UTC <thnorfar> @ClaudiaSwisher @ShariGateley Please feel free to come and see me. My doors are always open!
967954560856805376 2018-02-25 02:48:45 UTC <thnorfar> @ebarnes73 @ShariGateley I got you! Make a session or we can just make a session when I arrive. That is the beauty of edcamp! You can make whatever happen.
967954371328794624 2018-02-25 02:48:00 UTC <thnorfar> @coach57 @MrsHime We are looking at doing it the last Saturday in February at my school next year :) Would you be able to come then?
967954176381681664 2018-02-25 02:47:14 UTC <thnorfar> @KimberBlodgett You are so funny. I wish. I helped plan edcamp and I have another meeting as well. However, let me know of the next concert. I will roll with you!
967953979001929729 2018-02-25 02:46:26 UTC <thnorfar> @jlreed2011 @andredaughty Oh, yeah. I remember that occurring. I was already with my notepad and everything.
967953605184679938 2018-02-25 02:44:57 UTC <thnorfar> Gotta go a little early peeps. I gotta get materials ready for me being in VA three days this week. See my @EdCampOKC peeps on the call on Tuesday. See everyone in Norman in the afternoon #oklaed
967953351056023557 2018-02-25 02:43:57 UTC <thnorfar> Put a topic up on the board that you really want to talk about. Its the only way to guarantee your needs are met. #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/ebarnes73/status/967952861182087168
967953071916699648 2018-02-25 02:42:50 UTC <thnorfar> @OKHouseofReps @hkoliver @James409Jason Are you going to do a how we fight them session at Edcamp? If you do, make it for the afternoon so that I can help make the signs. #oklaed
967952754009346050 2018-02-25 02:41:34 UTC <thnorfar> @lisarcrosslin So true! I feel so brilliant around people. https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/DW6IP-JVwAAQWeJ.mp4 #oklaed
967952462752763904 2018-02-25 02:40:25 UTC <thnorfar> A6: Everyone likes the ability to do what they want. Unconference is about you doing what you want. #oklaed
967952207034363904 2018-02-25 02:39:24 UTC <thnorfar> A5: A reminder that #oklaed has some of the best and brightest despite how much we are not appreciated by #okleg
967951996069335041 2018-02-25 02:38:34 UTC <thnorfar> Yes!! Yes, he is amazing! #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/andredaughty/status/967951077537697793
967949461904379904 2018-02-25 02:28:30 UTC <thnorfar> @tbbrwn @TeachFromHere I may do that in the future. Just to shake things up a bit . #oklaed
967948987352408064 2018-02-25 02:26:36 UTC <thnorfar> @andredaughty Yeah!!!! I cant wait to see both of you. Ill be there in the afternoon #oklaed
967948507154976768 2018-02-25 02:24:42 UTC <thnorfar> A3: think of the movie, Hes just not that into you but only about the conversation. Its okay to leave. #oklaed
967947984506949632 2018-02-25 02:22:37 UTC <thnorfar> @KimberBlodgett Dont stop. I so wish I was going with you! #oklaed
967947558566981632 2018-02-25 02:20:56 UTC <thnorfar> Im arriving late so I hope there will be some great topics listed related to secondary and/or math up. #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/mrsbeck25/status/967945311158259712
967947231822303233 2018-02-25 02:19:38 UTC <thnorfar> @MPSTechnology That happened so much last year. Still stalking @BlueCerealEduc! #oklaed
967946815881564160 2018-02-25 02:17:59 UTC <thnorfar> @becky_ollar Cool!! You will so love it. #oklaed
967946558967861248 2018-02-25 02:16:57 UTC <thnorfar> @chong2087 Gotta do what you have to do. #oklaed
967945966564397056 2018-02-25 02:14:36 UTC <thnorfar> @MrsHime Used too?? Why do you want to go now? #oklaed
967945124079722496 2018-02-25 02:11:15 UTC <thnorfar> A1: always excited to meet new people; catch up w/old friends; learn what I want to learn #oklaed
967944212066037760 2018-02-25 02:07:38 UTC <thnorfar> @MrsHime Ahh. That s wonderful. #oklaed
967943904338341888 2018-02-25 02:06:24 UTC <thnorfar> @ClaudiaSwisher @ShariGateley Im working on NBCT too. Cheryl Wolf is our fierce leader. #oklaed
967943480298426368 2018-02-25 02:04:43 UTC <thnorfar> Math T at NWC! Cant wait for edcamp #oklaed
967838764251959299 2018-02-25 19:08:37 UTC <thnorfar> @brianrozinsky From my experience teacher ed programs require a lot of details in planning. I think it is not a prep issue as it is reality hitting. Planning time during a day may be less than an hour.
967769982091350016 2018-02-25 14:35:18 UTC <thnorfar> See you guys next #sunchat. Gotta get ready for church. As always, I love learning and growing w/u. Gave me so many things to chew on. Hope I helped to expand u too.
967769555299905536 2018-02-25 14:33:36 UTC <thnorfar> @historycomics Gotcha but I would argue that your statement I want to know..non-Europeans was a type of rubric just a really basic one (LOL!) #sunchat
967769038507118592 2018-02-25 14:31:33 UTC <thnorfar> @brianrozinsky I think a lot of teacher prep is survival! Compliance or creativity may happen sometimes. Speaking more as a teacher who has 3 years or less experience #sunchat
967768376150982656 2018-02-25 14:28:55 UTC <thnorfar> I dont know about u guys who are doing CC standards, when I first read them while they were even still in draft form, I was like WHOA! ELA is filled with communication, creativity and critical thinking requirements. #sunchat
967768045459558400 2018-02-25 14:27:36 UTC <thnorfar> In honor of it being sunday, let me just say AMEN to this statement #sunchathttps://twitter.com/tiffanytruitt/status/967764868987326464
967767697843998720 2018-02-25 14:26:14 UTC <thnorfar> @LeeAraoz @polonerd So true! It is my passion to teach Ts how to create a student centered classroom. I think universities are starting to do it. Wondering how we can make it the new norm in education #sunchat
967767474786783232 2018-02-25 14:25:20 UTC <thnorfar> @tiffanytruitt I think that definitely amplified it but it was a problem before. I have a lot of family and friends who wear me out with their perfectionism. They didnt grow up in the standardized assessment era. #sunchat
967767122297409537 2018-02-25 14:23:56 UTC <thnorfar> @carlameyrink Everyone needs training on creativity. I have learned a lot about it through my work with PBL. I had a lot of misconceptions. Similar to compliance. #sunchat
967766855589990401 2018-02-25 14:22:53 UTC <thnorfar> @carlameyrink @MissNikkiIn5th Those poor babies. I have no solutions for helping them right now. I hug my perfectionist kids a lot and say they are made perfect, they dont have to be perfect #sunchat
967766522029584385 2018-02-25 14:21:33 UTC <thnorfar> @historycomics So glad you mentioned rubrics. As I work with Ts, I see so many bad rubrics. It should be about quality not how to. A good one allows for creativity while also giving parameters. #sunchat
967766239169916929 2018-02-25 14:20:26 UTC <thnorfar> @polonerd This is so true. We do so many things without knowing why. Ex. We have a dress code. Kids didnt like it because we didnt explain why. When I said it is a security measure, they were like ohh. #sunchat
967765922235797504 2018-02-25 14:19:10 UTC <thnorfar> @Emily_Seegers @bethreed_12 So glad more universities are requiring it. A great way to help you develop as a T. #sunchat
967765748671221760 2018-02-25 14:18:29 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch @Dr_LMR NICE!
967765632048685063 2018-02-25 14:18:01 UTC <thnorfar> @carlameyrink Perfectionism is a really challenging trait. Would those same Ss be creative if the T said it was the rule :) #sunchat
967765324534870017 2018-02-25 14:16:48 UTC <thnorfar> @polonerd @LeeAraoz Ts dont do rows because of compliance but due to control. I wonder if we are defining as compliance as control. I define as following rules. I dont think that is always bad. As a black person, I really like how the rules have changed for me #sunchat
967764680398827526 2018-02-25 14:14:14 UTC <thnorfar> @readrunteachVA Oh, no. Its okay to disconnect. You can always read this later :) #sunchat
967764480653512705 2018-02-25 14:13:27 UTC <thnorfar> There are some great views here. I am curious what people define as creative? I have found it is not really about new as much it is improving something old. Example: chalkboard, to whiteboard to interactive board #sunchat
967764020097929216 2018-02-25 14:11:37 UTC <thnorfar> @carlameyrink Interesting view point. I always related the statement this is the way weve always done it to people who just dont want change or dont want to work LOL #sunchat
967763675485474823 2018-02-25 14:10:15 UTC <thnorfar> Compliance sometimes gets a bad name. I rather call it norms. We follow norms so that we dont step on other people. #sunchat
967763038047784960 2018-02-25 14:07:43 UTC <thnorfar> @TonjaKidd @susankotch My tweetdeck is always smoking after #sunchat
967762930136731651 2018-02-25 14:07:17 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch @Dr_LMR You are on break..I am curious. What was the name of the break?
967762189032583169 2018-02-25 14:04:20 UTC <thnorfar> @Emily_Seegers How cool? Is this a part of a class requirement? I see a few from ur university has joined. #sunchat
967761773364424704 2018-02-25 14:02:41 UTC <thnorfar> @mslamplugh How cool!! You are going to enjoy it. #sunchat
967761478269984768 2018-02-25 14:01:31 UTC <thnorfar> Morning!! Glad to be back. Im a math t on Oklahoma City#sunchat
967428456547061762 2018-02-24 15:58:12 UTC <thnorfar> @Willmdunn Keepem coming!!
967271512871964672 2018-02-23 05:34:34 UTC <thnorfar> I am asked a lot about PBL. Read about the latest description of it in this article. Spoiler alert. I am in the article #oklaed #mathchat #kschat #sunchat The Six Must-Have Elements Of High Quality Project-Based Learninghttps://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2018/02/22/the-six-must-have-elements-of-high-quality-project-based-learning/
966860769068449792 2018-02-22 02:22:25 UTC <thnorfar> @teachkate Is the book out yet? Can you give me a link to it?
966827784600420353 2018-02-22 00:11:21 UTC <thnorfar> @andredaughty @April2383 @perezhasclass Its embedded in project management. We realized people only looked at voice and choice as picking products. Its really about students learning to run the entire process.
966827461450387456 2018-02-22 00:10:04 UTC <thnorfar> @andredaughty @April2383 You are too funny. It was an honor to be on the steering committee w/amazing leaders in education.
966814479047692288 2018-02-22 23:18:29 UTC <thnorfar> @andredaughty @April2383 I helped create the six elements so yeah, I agree
966708834579476480 2018-02-22 16:18:41 UTC <thnorfar> Check me out . Great collaboration to further advance high quality PBLhttps://twitter.com/davidpblross/status/966693808145514498
966060397387309057 2018-02-20 21:22:01 UTC <thnorfar> @jennyholman @RabaMusic @oFISHallyedu @mjlifeisgood @PryorMiranda @JChanter22 @reyesjessica6 @KerryLynn0 @rhondaschroeder @luman_sarah @DeniseHRichards @HBLutz12 @msmutchler3 @tdynda @BESTechTeacher @Teach_Luv_China @Eduporium Ur welcome
965750415194296320 2018-02-19 00:50:16 UTC <thnorfar> @shawnhime Im so sorry to my #oklaed and #oklaleg peeps. I email and call as well as promote pro education candidates. After last Monday, I just couldnt call or email today. Just dont think they care. Working on a new message to OK citizensVOTE DIFFERENTLY.
965444351773036544 2018-02-18 04:34:05 UTC <thnorfar> @KimberBlodgett It really wont move the needle in your pay. Unless you want to eventually get a PhD and go university, I would not get a masters in education.
965442359222775808 2018-02-18 04:26:10 UTC <thnorfar> @SigTauEli @TeachFromHere I am one of those people. Alternatively certified but I did take courses and still grow each year12 years strong. #OklaEd
965410578587176961 2018-02-18 02:19:53 UTC <thnorfar> Hope you guys are having fun. Catching up with family and friends. See you next Sunday #OklaEdpic.twitter.com/D2slvVT7ew
965233741340790785 2018-02-18 14:37:11 UTC <thnorfar> @DebbiSab That does make a difference. We had that and still many didnt want to put in the time. I think some were overwhelmed by the teaching workload and some just didnt want to :(
965233339736215552 2018-02-18 14:35:36 UTC <thnorfar> Gotta get ready for church. So loved being with you guys again. See you next #sunchat
965233077827133440 2018-02-18 14:34:33 UTC <thnorfar> @historycomics Can you follow me so I can send you a DM with my email?
965232679687000065 2018-02-18 14:32:58 UTC <thnorfar> @jbrennan62 @Ms_A_Yeh @historycomics Have I told you how much I love you today!! After Jesus, husband and some friends, you are my new hero! I will DM you my email. Please share whatever you can especially lessons learned. How many SS does your school have?
965232276635291648 2018-02-18 14:31:22 UTC <thnorfar> @historycomics So true. Our district did a day where Ts visited students home. I thought that was a great idea! #sunchat
965232051631939584 2018-02-18 14:30:28 UTC <thnorfar> @PMcPeake1 I have heard about those. Some call it exhibitions. Thinking of incorporating that in our building as well. #sunchat
965231843774812161 2018-02-18 14:29:39 UTC <thnorfar> @DebbiSab You sure do! I used to think the problem was our faculty was too old (tired of doing it) but we have younger staff now and many dont want to help either #sunchat
965231249450328065 2018-02-18 14:27:17 UTC <thnorfar> @DebbiSab How does your school get the Ts to commit to so much? Is there extra pay for them. #sunchat
965231047427416065 2018-02-18 14:26:29 UTC <thnorfar> @jbrennan62 @Ms_A_Yeh @historycomics Cool! Do you think those people would be okay if I talked with them? I can DM you my email. #sunchat
965230681860210690 2018-02-18 14:25:02 UTC <thnorfar> @MissWinegar Thanks for the clarification. Our academy directors coordinates it for the academies. However, I think it is something all students should experience. #sunchat
965230004287295490 2018-02-18 14:22:20 UTC <thnorfar> @jbrennan62 @Ms_A_Yeh @historycomics Early apology for all of these questions: Is that through a class? How do you monitor it? How many seniors are you talking about? Do they get their own mentor you or does the school have a list? #sunchat
965229590263357440 2018-02-18 14:20:42 UTC <thnorfar> @MissWinegar Is that coordinated by one person? #sunchat
965229408217915393 2018-02-18 14:19:58 UTC <thnorfar> @jbrennan62 @susankotch Truth be told. Most of us is still figuring out chatting as well. LOL. I have lead and chatted for over 5 years. Learn something new every time #sunchat
965228777461690368 2018-02-18 14:17:28 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch Our fine arts department does a great job of going to perform around the city and country. #sunchat
965228406844600320 2018-02-18 14:15:59 UTC <thnorfar> @JAFCentralIndy @MrJessePruitt @mrclinefhs So the bulk of your community connections is handled by your student council? That is a great function for student council. #sunchat
965228148429336577 2018-02-18 14:14:58 UTC <thnorfar> @DebbiSab That is an easy starting place. I am going to check with our union and school this week. #sunchat
965227810762653696 2018-02-18 14:13:37 UTC <thnorfar> @edu_match @Hmbs76 How cool! I love @kathyschrock as a resource for not only Ts but Media Specialist. Check out her website and you will be floored. She emphasizes purpose and then shares the tech. #sunchat
965227228295507968 2018-02-18 14:11:18 UTC <thnorfar> @DebbiSab Really. What are some of your ways? I think this is so vital. Not only for learning but also to help put an end on the assault on public education #sunchat
965226979271331845 2018-02-18 14:10:19 UTC <thnorfar> @mrclinefhs How are you getting the connections? Our academys in our building are doing that through their advisory boards. I think it should be school wide. We used to do a beautification day as well. #sunchat
965226663264096257 2018-02-18 14:09:04 UTC <thnorfar> @jbrennan62 Wow! There is a lot you can do. You will just have to think about your instructional goals. What do you are some concepts or skills do you want them to learn this week? #sunchat
965225955005485061 2018-02-18 14:06:15 UTC <thnorfar> @mrclinefhs OK did that this week too! We got to 83 on Wednesday! Dropped back down the next day. Crazy #sunchat
965225740936601600 2018-02-18 14:05:24 UTC <thnorfar> @jbrennan62 I am a high school math T. What grade level are you and what tech do you have access too? #sunchat
965225540398575621 2018-02-18 14:04:36 UTC <thnorfar> @edu_match Welcome @Hmbs76. Joining any chat including #sunchat moved you from rookie status to @ least minor leagues :). What do you teach and what tech do you have access to?
965224799671869440 2018-02-18 14:01:39 UTC <thnorfar> HS Math T @NWCKnightVision in @OKCPS. Need a lot of advice on community connections. #sunchat
965224431886000128 2018-02-18 14:00:12 UTC <thnorfar> I am so excited to join #sunchat this morning. I missed them!
964973938387365889 2018-02-17 21:24:49 UTC <thnorfar> @PFFSDowntown @CITYccl @joannbentegroh Congrats!!
964888786537771008 2018-02-17 15:46:28 UTC <thnorfar> @vperezy Ahh!! I know who they are now. Going back inside!!
964888069261361152 2018-02-17 15:43:37 UTC <thnorfar> @vperezy Yes!!! We are in the back of the school. They need to take a 1 way street that is off of walker. They will see me waving in the street!
964878299905314816 2018-02-17 15:04:47 UTC <thnorfar> @rhondabie Donating now!! I dont think people realize that heart disease is number one killer of women!!
964259423710601216 2018-02-15 22:05:36 UTC <thnorfar> Yes, compliments go a long way!!https://twitter.com/jasonperez75/status/964112596726177793
964103780085239808 2018-02-15 11:47:08 UTC <thnorfar> @kari_hampton Im stealing that quote
963877849106124808 2018-02-14 20:49:21 UTC <thnorfar> It was my pleasure! Glad I was able to help.https://twitter.com/ashleyfellis/status/963762845228904450
963877640775045121 2018-02-14 20:48:32 UTC <thnorfar> It was an absolute pleasure @NicoleAkersLCPS!! Thank you for letting me share.https://twitter.com/nicoleakerslcps/status/963762440856113152
963561532624916480 2018-02-13 23:52:26 UTC <thnorfar> @OklaEd @GovRexLawhorn I got it. Thanks!!
963560242637426688 2018-02-13 23:47:18 UTC <thnorfar> @OklaEd @GovRexLawhorn Sorry for ??s. Seeking to understand. Hard to say some things in a tweet. So you believe if a child (under 18), moves into the state, they should pay for school? Is that what you mean by educating out of state students?
963559287938273286 2018-02-13 23:43:30 UTC <thnorfar> @vperezy @khrista_lou Thats so sweet. Its just simply figure it out. By the way, we may even cut you more because we dont want people to pay taxes.
963556452764852224 2018-02-13 23:32:15 UTC <thnorfar> @khrista_lou @vperezy Ohh, there is so much to say!! They are not good at math...Spent the last 10 years questioning...just need people to VOTE DIFFERENTLY
963514509657812993 2018-02-13 20:45:34 UTC <thnorfar> @vperezy I love this but also wonder if people see this and think, Oh, they do have the money so they dont need a raise. They need their district to change their spending
963513985764069376 2018-02-13 20:43:30 UTC <thnorfar> @OklaEd @GovRexLawhorn Gotcha. So you seem to be talking about college/university level not K-12? Just need clarification
963390765425676288 2018-02-13 12:33:52 UTC <thnorfar> @OklaEd @GovRexLawhorn Where did you get that number from? Also, what are we wasting it on?
963200022618796032 2018-02-12 23:55:55 UTC <thnorfar> @KimLanders2 
963198797479366656 2018-02-12 23:51:03 UTC <thnorfar> @KimLanders2 About to look now. We didnt get it did we?
963197974494007302 2018-02-12 23:47:47 UTC <thnorfar> @KimLanders2 Im out of town trying to catch up on what is happening. What is this a video of?
962884385069559809 2018-02-11 03:01:41 UTC <thnorfar> @andredaughty #observeme!! Back to work #oklaed
962879567613562880 2018-02-11 02:42:33 UTC <thnorfar> So sorry peeps. I am an hour ahead tonight and need to finish preparing for the Ts I am supporting tomorrow. See you next Sunday! #oklaed
962879333764358144 2018-02-11 02:41:37 UTC <thnorfar> @vperezy @kriscoop80 Maybe? You said math needs practice. I said dont tell Heather Sparks who works in ur district. Vanessa said get her on twitter. I said I will.
962878922890403841 2018-02-11 02:39:59 UTC <thnorfar> @kriscoop80 @vperezy Good point. I am going to encourage her to tweet with us next week.
962878484493295616 2018-02-11 02:38:14 UTC <thnorfar> @kriscoop80 FYI dont say that around Heather Sparks. She will blow your mind #oklaed
962878337533317120 2018-02-11 02:37:39 UTC <thnorfar> @mrterborg Absolutely! We also get more stubborn about it :) LOL #oklaed
962878217622360064 2018-02-11 02:37:11 UTC <thnorfar> @allen_lehman Yes, sir. I miss wiggins :(. #oklaed
962877881377546241 2018-02-11 02:35:50 UTC <thnorfar> @mrterborg Dont we all do that. #oklaed
962877632672083969 2018-02-11 02:34:51 UTC <thnorfar> @BradLatzke @coach57 I teach to my tests all the time. It is a really good test if I say so myself :) #oklaed
962877369102032897 2018-02-11 02:33:48 UTC <thnorfar> @ShelbyJr3 We gotta have hope and get the right peoples ear. Maybe the Koch brothers #oklaed
962877104114290688 2018-02-11 02:32:45 UTC <thnorfar> I help my Ss to know homework is what you do if you are not grasping it and need extra time. They need to determine when that is. It is not something I need to grade or assign #oklaed
962876810395561984 2018-02-11 02:31:35 UTC <thnorfar> How about we change the culture to learning is for growth as a citizen, person and profession. Its what it is really for #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/ShelbyJr3/status/962876169417785345
962876242411376642 2018-02-11 02:29:20 UTC <thnorfar> A3: Assessment is not bad. It is the frequency and nature that is bad. I love comparing my data with colleagues. It really shows me where Ss are & their advice helps me #oklaed
962875880476479488 2018-02-11 02:27:53 UTC <thnorfar> @KimberBlodgett That is so funny! I havent looked at anything else for a few minutes laughing about it. Where would all those honors stickers go if we dont have grades. #oklaed
962875155730059271 2018-02-11 02:25:01 UTC <thnorfar> @allen_lehman I like it better than A through F. Just need to be at a true standards level not objectives. #oklaed
962874979342831616 2018-02-11 02:24:19 UTC <thnorfar> @lisarcrosslin I got here late as well! #oklaed
962874767756939264 2018-02-11 02:23:28 UTC <thnorfar> @Ampmom3Ann You know I looked closely at my districts statements and it says recommend. I lean on that word a lot LOL #oklaed
962874551855181824 2018-02-11 02:22:37 UTC <thnorfar> @andredaughty It is why I love the missing feature in IC. It does record like a zero but it really says I am just missing what they understand. IT could be because they are lazy. It could be because grams is in the hospital #oklaed
962874166570635264 2018-02-11 02:21:05 UTC <thnorfar> @KimberBlodgett True. It is why I let me students evaluate different spaces for a while and then make a decision. Also can always talk again and readjust. Love this video about that: https://vimeo.com/142645382 #oklaed
962873048545325057 2018-02-11 02:16:38 UTC <thnorfar> A2: Wow, you are really tipping some cows tonight. I grade after Ss are given a chance to master. Not equal to 2 grades a week. Learning may be missing rather than zero. Thats just me #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/TeachFromHere/status/962872052171591680
962872231994019842 2018-02-11 02:13:24 UTC <thnorfar> @KimberBlodgett So true but I always wondered why Ts didnt ask students what worked. Shouldnt it be really their say since they are the ones learning #oklaed
962871933347028992 2018-02-11 02:12:12 UTC <thnorfar> Isnt this the way Ss should sit :). My Ss decide the how the seats are organized. Choose 4 people formation this year #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/sulphurmiddle/status/962871505351782400
962871566685147136 2018-02-11 02:10:45 UTC <thnorfar> @ebarnes73 Virginia, right outside DC #oklaed
962870592310513665 2018-02-11 02:06:53 UTC <thnorfar> Sorry I am late. Math T from NWC joining. #oklaed
962356373332877312 2018-02-10 16:03:33 UTC <thnorfar> @CathJSweeney I was at first shocked by the amount of facts in an opinion piece. Not common but the writer is a journalist. A really GOOD one. #oklaed please start voting differently!!
962345513298415618 2018-02-10 15:20:24 UTC <thnorfar> @alicekeeler @jefferson_first Man! #cpsreds u r killing me!! Great things just keep happening to u. Im going to touch u @EdCampOKC so that it transfers to me 
962344804779773958 2018-02-10 15:17:35 UTC <thnorfar> @BeckiLaoshi @FreePressOKC @okcpsteacher True! Larger public-probably hit and miss.
962344532204539904 2018-02-10 15:16:30 UTC <thnorfar> @thestephhinton @jlgathright @MPSTechnology @MrsBeck25 @MrRogersTech @ebarnes73 @vperezy @zoom_us @EdCampOKC @KristenDStein The target audience is educators and college ed students. High school students have attended in the past to lead a session.
962342973903179776 2018-02-10 15:10:19 UTC <thnorfar> @thestephhinton @jlgathright @MPSTechnology @MrsBeck25 @MrRogersTech @ebarnes73 @zoom_us @EdCampOKC @vperezy Wow!! Wanted to go to that. Helped awesome teachers in KY instead.
962342753047928832 2018-02-10 15:09:26 UTC <thnorfar> @thestephhinton @jlgathright @MPSTechnology @MrsBeck25 @MrRogersTech @ebarnes73 @vperezy @zoom_us @EdCampOKC Missed seeing you guys. My  ride was so bumpy too! #oklaed
960710411799711744 2018-02-05 03:03:05 UTC <thnorfar> @56library Ahh. That is great. What are some of examples of trauma that I may not think about?
960710254437822471 2018-02-05 03:02:28 UTC <thnorfar> @Willmdunn I will definitely tell people to join :)
960710076196638720 2018-02-05 03:01:45 UTC <thnorfar> @Willmdunn U still pay more than us. So yes, u get some of our new Ts along with all other bordering states. Yes, I do get your plight is close to ours though just not as bad. I know that is hard to image.
960709651603091457 2018-02-05 03:00:04 UTC <thnorfar> @Willmdunn Smart principal!
960709582015356928 2018-02-05 02:59:48 UTC <thnorfar> Thank u #ksedchat for welcoming an OKIE into your chat. I am so glad @Willmdunn invited me out. Hope you dont mind if I join you next week in between dinner with friends
960709202254663680 2018-02-05 02:58:17 UTC <thnorfar> @56library Nice. I heard trauma sensitive in this thread before. Can u expand? Also check out http://www.bie.org for great PBL resources #ksedchat
960708856870588416 2018-02-05 02:56:55 UTC <thnorfar> @Willmdunn It is wonderful when Ts collectively get on board with an idea. Bottom up is so much better than top down #ksedchat
960708616897560576 2018-02-05 02:55:58 UTC <thnorfar> @Willmdunn A5: We are making some moves but unfortunately OK is having huge budget issues. U guys may be aware since U get a lot of our Ts. Many have gone 1 to 1 as well as more collaborative spaces. However, it is too few given it is 2018 #ksedchat
960708101094739968 2018-02-05 02:53:55 UTC <thnorfar> @AneMaesCoffee @heather_newkirk Nice! I think I am going to steal the idea.
960707683681697793 2018-02-05 02:52:15 UTC <thnorfar> @AneMaesCoffee @heather_newkirk Does this happen on a regular basis? We always have this before our Edcamp but I think this would be great as just a regular event. #ksedchat
960707353011204096 2018-02-05 02:50:56 UTC <thnorfar> @aboone_angie There is a lot of adapting to do! #ksedchat
960707225902813185 2018-02-05 02:50:26 UTC <thnorfar> @MrsJankord Boy, how great our classrooms would be if everyone would do these things. I think we are getting there! #ksedchat
960706831843758080 2018-02-05 02:48:52 UTC <thnorfar> @BoysTown @eric_falls @PreK33 I love oldies but goodies. Thanks for the share. This is simply amazing #ksedchat
960706494357483520 2018-02-05 02:47:31 UTC <thnorfar> @MrsJankord @Willmdunn Thanks for the shout out Will! So glad I met you this week :) #ksedchat
960706353072394240 2018-02-05 02:46:58 UTC <thnorfar> A4: Uh, Oh. Now u r asking me to check myself. That is so hard. I think the biggest thing is a person who learns, unlearns and relearns. That is the hardest but greatest skill of the 21st century. #ksedchathttps://twitter.com/Willmdunn/status/960705047993741312
960705679077101568 2018-02-05 02:44:17 UTC <thnorfar> @MrsJankord So true the power of real people. I used to be in other professions before teaching. Many get time off to to come talk. I also remind people that no one really wants to go to work LOL #ksedchat
960705258476404736 2018-02-05 02:42:37 UTC <thnorfar> @heather_newkirk Ask 3 before me and one day each week where I can not help them at all has really helped me w/building perseverance for the last two years #ksedchat
960704835011141632 2018-02-05 02:40:56 UTC <thnorfar> @robertkaplinsky @MsNic_ @heather_newkirk @Willmdunn Yeah! I hope you get it going. I will let you know how it works in my building. So far one T and my intern observed me last week.
960704644640067584 2018-02-05 02:40:10 UTC <thnorfar> @Willmdunn Good point
960704608942411776 2018-02-05 02:40:02 UTC <thnorfar> @MsNic_ @heather_newkirk Here is my student link since my image has the adult form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdK_gui9zrscHE-bVdwskNwoEbPWS7-m3qWxbPLWTYTKLBkjQ/viewform?usp=sf_link #ksedchat
960704295158059008 2018-02-05 02:38:47 UTC <thnorfar> @JillWebs One of the things my dad always said that I still believe: There is nothing wrong with copying as long as you copy from the right cat! #ksedchat
960704005033857024 2018-02-05 02:37:38 UTC <thnorfar> @MsNic_ @heather_newkirk I just started this week. Here is my sign. I have a form for adults and one for my Ss. My Ss results were real telling. Only had 2 adults and it was helpful too. Want links to the survey? #ksedchatpic.twitter.com/DMXT6pPwJH
960703152440926210 2018-02-05 02:34:15 UTC <thnorfar> A3: Whoops. I answered this in Q2 but I also use surveys as a way to check on Q1 and Q2. These are filled out by Ss and Ts who visit. #ksedchathttps://twitter.com/Willmdunn/status/960702575644499968
960702540433281024 2018-02-05 02:31:49 UTC <thnorfar> @MsNic_ I try to listen to my own sermons everyday. i feel you. One of the reasons why I started to do #observeme so that I can make sure I stick to my goals #ksedchat
960702036730875905 2018-02-05 02:29:49 UTC <thnorfar> A2: My greatest resource I use with students is a rubric. It shows them exactly what I expect in whatever 21st century skill I am developing #ksedchat
960701765678194688 2018-02-05 02:28:44 UTC <thnorfar> @MsNic_ I felt like I just had a small church service with your answer. PREACH. #ksedchat
960701383241551872 2018-02-05 02:27:13 UTC <thnorfar> @Willmdunn Understand. I am not one who has either but I understand why people feel it. Its hard to keep that view once you start talking with people globally. Made what I read so real.
960700850267152384 2018-02-05 02:25:06 UTC <thnorfar> @Willmdunn @PreK33 I want that same outcome for my HS Ss. Amazing how we can want the same things with so vast of an age gap in our students #ksedchat
960700561166303232 2018-02-05 02:23:57 UTC <thnorfar> @MrsJankord Nice response and great that you have a lot of choice in your class. That is not easy to do. Is there some routine in the choice to make it easy on your planning?
960700192369664001 2018-02-05 02:22:29 UTC <thnorfar> @Willmdunn It hit me a few years ago when the World is Flat came out. Although a lot of people like Americas 1st message, we are actually all in this together whether we like it or not
960699874730823680 2018-02-05 02:21:13 UTC <thnorfar> @56library So true or at least aware to not make the possible bad decisions we may make a digital record. So glad not all of my life is not digitally cataloged #ksedchatpic.twitter.com/4NIiWTZk5w
960699221342130176 2018-02-05 02:18:37 UTC <thnorfar> @heather_newkirk For the 1st time, I had Ss overwhelmed by the amount of tech used in my room LOL #ksedchat
960698958392823808 2018-02-05 02:17:35 UTC <thnorfar> @MrsJankord I love your description. What are some things you do to support that type of outcome? Full disclaimer: I want to steal :) #ksedchat
960698622366142470 2018-02-05 02:16:15 UTC <thnorfar> @rachp2005 Welcome to the profession! We need more Ts #ksedchat
960698465956265984 2018-02-05 02:15:37 UTC <thnorfar> @56library Digital citizenship is becoming more and more of a need to be a formal staple in all classrooms #ksedchat
960698132538515458 2018-02-05 02:14:18 UTC <thnorfar> A1 What I try to develop in my Ss is problem solver, critical thinker, communicator, globally aware, caring, collaborator, learner, self-manager, emotionally stable and leader. #ksedchathttps://twitter.com/Willmdunn/status/960697215181258752
960695886186778624 2018-02-05 02:05:22 UTC <thnorfar> @heather_newkirk Wow. So glad you are okay. #ksedchat
960695697573113858 2018-02-05 02:04:37 UTC <thnorfar> @OKCPS @NWCKnightVision @Willmdunn I am glad too. Had a great nap and ready to discuss!
960695632834023424 2018-02-05 02:04:22 UTC <thnorfar> @OKCPS @NWCKnightVision @thewarsnak Thanks for having me :)
960695081320763393 2018-02-05 02:02:10 UTC <thnorfar> Math T @NWCKnightVision in @OKCPS joining #ksedchat for the first time.
960272828800098304 2018-02-04 22:04:18 UTC <thnorfar> @brianrozinsky @Ms_A_Yeh @mexusmx @MsVenturino Thanks so much. Hope you have fun where you are traveling to.
960227009946406912 2018-02-04 19:02:13 UTC <thnorfar> @Willmdunn Yeah, it does. However, I am going to tell him so it wont be awkward anymore :).
960226560228851713 2018-02-04 19:00:26 UTC <thnorfar> @Willmdunn Ohh, just now seeing you answered my question about who told you about me. LOL
960226362316476416 2018-02-04 18:59:39 UTC <thnorfar> @Willmdunn AHH! I love Ryan. He is so great. We worked together in Boston last summer. Is he also the one who said you should talk to me about math?
960225573883797505 2018-02-04 18:56:31 UTC <thnorfar> @Willmdunn I also forgot to ask you who told you about me? I am honored someone thought of me and would like to thank them.
960225384951435269 2018-02-04 18:55:46 UTC <thnorfar> @Willmdunn It is the support visit you will have next. I am a NF for BIE (http://www.bie.org/people/telannia_norfar/40). It is excellent training on PBL. Who was your trainer?
960217052114976770 2018-02-04 18:22:39 UTC <thnorfar> @brianrozinsky @Ms_A_Yeh @MsVenturino @mexusmx They all look good. I wonder which one is considered the blue and green one.
960216811911467008 2018-02-04 18:21:42 UTC <thnorfar> @Willmdunn Luckily I am free because Im going to help Ts with PBL in Kentucky. I leave Tuesday after school. I always do nothing right before a trip.
960215721233002498 2018-02-04 18:17:22 UTC <thnorfar> @Willmdunn I am . Although I am always trying to improve. Ill join you tomorrow!!
960215253178028032 2018-02-04 18:15:30 UTC <thnorfar> @brianrozinsky @mexusmx @Ms_A_Yeh @MsVenturino Thanks
960215086462795778 2018-02-04 18:14:51 UTC <thnorfar> @vperezy Ahh!! Good point 
960170620280504321 2018-02-04 15:18:09 UTC <thnorfar> @brianrozinsky @mexusmx @Ms_A_Yeh @MsVenturino I think I missed the names of the blue and green books. Can someone state them again?
960163204612677633 2018-02-04 14:48:41 UTC <thnorfar> @mexusmx Anytime.
960162460144754688 2018-02-04 14:45:44 UTC <thnorfar> Great #sunchat as always. Hate I will miss next week. I will be flying at the time of the chat. Thanks again for a wonderful conversation in just 30 minutes.
960162041146347523 2018-02-04 14:44:04 UTC <thnorfar> @Ms_A_Yeh @brianrozinsky @mexusmx This is my first introduction to the process: https://www.edutopia.org/video/justice-committee-using-restorative-practices-resolve-conflicts #sunchat
960161766389972992 2018-02-04 14:42:58 UTC <thnorfar> @Ms_A_Yeh @brianrozinsky This is why I love you! Restorative justice is my new jam. Given our current climate as a nation, I think it needs to become a requirement in schools. Hope it spills over into society. Has your school implemented it? #sunchat
960160587643834369 2018-02-04 14:38:17 UTC <thnorfar> @springer_karl @mrclinefhs I know right! I miss him so much. He was a great leader #sunchat
960160082108575745 2018-02-04 14:36:17 UTC <thnorfar> @Ms_A_Yeh Your last question is so deep @brianrozinsky! My initial thought is no because it is non-criminal. They are the kind I commit the most. However, the person who received the offense may not think so. Gotta chew on that one. #sunchatpic.twitter.com/8bv6wfhFF6
960159341360943105 2018-02-04 14:33:20 UTC <thnorfar> @mrclinefhs @chadw675 @Elizabethutch @Ms_A_Yeh @natachadubuiss3 Welcome to the chat Natacha! #sunchat
960159214688759808 2018-02-04 14:32:50 UTC <thnorfar> @mrclinefhs @chadw675 @dhairston82 @Ms_A_Yeh You make such a great point about having grace for admins. I know I want it as a teacher. We need to extend forgiveness in both directions #sunchat
960158520963489793 2018-02-04 14:30:04 UTC <thnorfar> Leadership is not a position but simply influence. I am no longer the department chair but my influence in the building still resonates. Cant shake it off. Ive tried #sunchat
960158059506098176 2018-02-04 14:28:14 UTC <thnorfar> @PMcPeake1 I love that! Proverbs right. I love Proverbs. #sunchat
960157829503045638 2018-02-04 14:27:20 UTC <thnorfar> @tiffanytruitt I think it is both. I love these two books by John Maxwell, international known for leadership, 21 Laws of leadership (behavior) and 21 qualities of leadership (trait). #sunchat
960157307949715457 2018-02-04 14:25:15 UTC <thnorfar> I think a great leader makes sacrifices first. I remember when we had to do huge budget cuts a few years ago. Our former sup @springer_karl took a $25K paycut first. #sunchat
960156179069657089 2018-02-04 14:20:46 UTC <thnorfar> @Ms_A_Yeh Wow. That is such a good point. I think we say we are listening by asking people to do surveys or chalk talks. However, many leaders dont do anything w/the info so you didnt listen #sunchat
960155496710844416 2018-02-04 14:18:03 UTC <thnorfar> My favorite leadership quote is People dont care how much you know until they know how much you care #sunchat
960155171379732480 2018-02-04 14:16:46 UTC <thnorfar> GM. Sorry I am late to the party. Math T in OKC. Have a lot to say about leadership #sunchat
960143746603147269 2018-02-04 13:31:22 UTC <thnorfar> @BeckiLaoshi @FreePressOKC Thanks for keeping the public informed. Im not sure if the public is aware that OKCPS is Loras 1st superintendent position. She just passed the test before taking the position. She couldnt help but make mistakes. Its what any inexperienced person would do.
960140973887062016 2018-02-04 13:20:21 UTC <thnorfar> @vperezy Its never weird to do anything regarding reading books in a high school library!
959266867851485184 2018-02-01 03:26:58 UTC <thnorfar> @jkathman @ckklynen @castlestephanie Thanks!
959265802447982592 2018-02-01 03:22:44 UTC <thnorfar> @mjgormans @liz_castillo @terri_science @surlyrider @kllathrop Thanks for sharing! Ill tell everyone I know. I miss the STEM institute 
959264773874573312 2018-02-01 03:18:39 UTC <thnorfar> Cant wait for more Ts to join the #Observeme movement. Going to be blogging about my first week of observing at http://www.pbl-birdside.blogspot.com #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/oklasaid/status/959115962862723073
958502919367725056 2018-01-30 00:51:18 UTC <thnorfar> @jkathman @ckklynen @castlestephanie Love the promotional. Was it made in iMovie?
958450894110064640 2018-01-30 21:24:34 UTC <thnorfar> Loved talking w/@ebarnes73 and @TeachFromHere about #Observeme on the #oklaed chat on Sunday.https://twitter.com/ebarnes73/status/958402089595625479
958161544520585217 2018-01-29 02:14:48 UTC <thnorfar> @Mrs_M_Granger @teacher2teacher Starting this week. Will let you know how it goes.
958160804045574144 2018-01-29 02:11:52 UTC <thnorfar> @GauntTonya @vperezy @Mrs_M_Granger @coach57 I would love for the to guide me 
957817775669628928 2018-01-28 03:28:47 UTC <thnorfar> @coach57 @Mrs_M_Granger I am available for some of that week before :) Can I come then? What would be a good day-Monday or Tuesday?
957817523596136450 2018-01-28 03:27:47 UTC <thnorfar> @jasonbengs @andredaughty There are ppl who video tape & then give feedback virtually. If you have a lot of people observe u it can be somewhat anonymous if they dont give their name
957817048394027008 2018-01-28 03:25:54 UTC <thnorfar> @Mrs_M_Granger I am honored to do it. I think this needs to become a norm in #Oklaed
957816658797752326 2018-01-28 03:24:21 UTC <thnorfar> @coach57 @Mrs_M_Granger Okay. I may have to make a trip. When is your spring break? I have two weeks off so I can come down when you guys are not off yet.
957816420326432768 2018-01-28 03:23:24 UTC <thnorfar> @coach57 I can only respond with this:pic.twitter.com/LGTwQnBb4s
957815701212889088 2018-01-28 03:20:33 UTC <thnorfar> @coach57 That makes sense. Can I come hang out with you in Clinton sometime? I want your leadership to rub off on me. I promise I will be cool.pic.twitter.com/76cxljuLWt
957815258160271361 2018-01-28 03:18:47 UTC <thnorfar> @andredaughty Thank you. I like #2 and #3 as well. Thanks for joining tonight. How did I do? Its been a while since I led. Feel rusty :)
957814824922173440 2018-01-28 03:17:04 UTC <thnorfar> @Melissa66613771 Yeah! I am so glad you will be back.
957814699801931776 2018-01-28 03:16:34 UTC <thnorfar> @NesterBrandy I am so glad. It will get easier each time. You might want to use tweetdkeck or hoot suite next time. It helps follow the chat and direct messages easier.
957814385623404544 2018-01-28 03:15:19 UTC <thnorfar> @KimberBlodgett Just checking back with you. Did the lack of Q/A format mess you up too much?
957813867257753602 2018-01-28 03:13:15 UTC <thnorfar> @EdCampOKC @joy4ok @andredaughty I am trying to make sure I dont geek out when she comes to my school next month!!
957813583139700736 2018-01-28 03:12:08 UTC <thnorfar> @andredaughty @jasonbengs @robertkaplinsky Thanks for jumping in! It is an honor to have you. Thank you for giving helping start the movement #Oklaed
957813385546039296 2018-01-28 03:11:21 UTC <thnorfar> @Mrs_M_Granger Gotta give you an applause before I go.pic.twitter.com/gldP2fDemL
957813202674438145 2018-01-28 03:10:37 UTC <thnorfar> @andredaughty @BeckiLaoshi #observeme is not a rubric thing even though some people did use a rubric for people to score. Most people just ask people to respond to questions #Oklaed
957812793041997824 2018-01-28 03:08:59 UTC <thnorfar> @posthard @jlreed2011 @April2383 Wonderful chat. iObservation peer review is supposed to feel like #observeme but  it also has evaluation so Ts will not separate. I love peer and student feedback. Want to grow this movement in our state which is why I asked to lead the #Oklaed. Glad u enjoyed.
957812006832263168 2018-01-28 03:05:52 UTC <thnorfar> @wallmover So glad you enjoyed it. Have a great night #Oklaed
957811565687910404 2018-01-28 03:04:07 UTC <thnorfar> @jefferson_first I am so glad. I cant wait to see how #cpsreds takes this on. #Oklaed
957811437929402373 2018-01-28 03:03:36 UTC <thnorfar> @jlreed2011 You are so welcome! Thank you for discussing
957811367066644481 2018-01-28 03:03:19 UTC <thnorfar> @room20awesome Thank you!
957811321906581504 2018-01-28 03:03:09 UTC <thnorfar> @ebarnes73 Thank you!!
957811196064948224 2018-01-28 03:02:39 UTC <thnorfar> That is a powerful statement! #Oklaedhttps://twitter.com/rhondaschroeder/status/957810390469050368
957811093468049408 2018-01-28 03:02:14 UTC <thnorfar> @KFullbrightOU Yes!!! Cant wait to see you back and @EdCampOKC in March right :) #Oklaed
957810774499618816 2018-01-28 03:00:58 UTC <thnorfar> Keep watching the Grammys guys. Have a good night. You can make your observe me poster while you do it :) #Oklaed
957810625006264320 2018-01-28 03:00:22 UTC <thnorfar> @watersenglish Thank you for discussing! #oklaed
957810325830725633 2018-01-28 02:59:11 UTC <thnorfar> Thank you for allowing me to moderate. You guys knocked this conversation out of the park. Round of applause to everyone #oklaedpic.twitter.com/vO9JVfcT6O
957809856425222144 2018-01-28 02:57:19 UTC <thnorfar> @KimberBlodgett It was my honor #oklaed
957809602497785856 2018-01-28 02:56:19 UTC <thnorfar> I am sorry to say, we are at the last five minutes. I would like to know if you would join me @EdCampOKC on March 3 to continue the conversation. Sign up here: https://goo.gl/forms/blgUVxSfbFEnzsn22 #Oklaedpic.twitter.com/yQ5c3Zp3pP
957809331025661953 2018-01-28 02:55:14 UTC <thnorfar> @maxswellguy Nice!!! We will see you next week :)
957809216907108352 2018-01-28 02:54:47 UTC <thnorfar> @rhondaschroeder Round of applause for you.pic.twitter.com/yBXiC7wKHo
957808812005707776 2018-01-28 02:53:10 UTC <thnorfar> Okay, that is another powerful statement. @coach57 does this every week! That is why he is my hero #Oklaedhttps://twitter.com/room20awesome/status/957808435965366272
957808485776883712 2018-01-28 02:51:52 UTC <thnorfar> How are my new chatters doing? Are you guys coming back? Did we overwhelm you? #Oklaed
957807931088605184 2018-01-28 02:49:40 UTC <thnorfar> @ebarnes73 @OklaSaid @TeachFromHere This format is the main format for #sunchat. I join it almost every sunday morning at 8 a.m. It is wonderful to not try and follow specific questions but just talk about the topic or prompts.
957807596060192768 2018-01-28 02:48:20 UTC <thnorfar> Can you believe it is only 13 minutes left? Please know you can:pic.twitter.com/5VtI8Mb8pO
957806218566881281 2018-01-28 02:42:52 UTC <thnorfar> @OklaSaid @TeachFromHere @ebarnes73 I am always down for a call with you guys! You are the best people in the universe. Sorry for me breaking protocol. I just like doing that sometimes :)
957805952044019712 2018-01-28 02:41:48 UTC <thnorfar> @andredaughty Absolutely!! I think it can start with a person in the building that people respect and have a relationship with. I am kicking it off in my building this week. Hope to report my outcomes @EdCampOKC #oklaed
957805454616420352 2018-01-28 02:39:50 UTC <thnorfar> @Mrs_M_Granger I love the digital aspect too. Unfortunately, I have some nondigital people in my building so I am going to have paper for them #Oklaed
957805291080470528 2018-01-28 02:39:11 UTC <thnorfar> @Mrs_M_Granger I would make sure it is no more than 3 things and it is something you have always been working on but dont know if it is working. #oklaed
957805119386669056 2018-01-28 02:38:30 UTC <thnorfar> @allen_lehman @dena_rogers If I remember right, it was a strategy she used in her class. @TynansClass can you tell us about the Pineapple schedule. I shared your wonderful #observeme with #oklaed tonight.
957804368237072385 2018-01-28 02:35:31 UTC <thnorfar> Man, I was afraid you guys would miss the Q/A format. You guys are tearing up my feed w/just talking. We are at the half way point. If you havent said something, say something! #oklaedpic.twitter.com/PwGrIvMawp
957803643205545984 2018-01-28 02:32:38 UTC <thnorfar> Several have mentioned problems with Ts coming. Has anyone tried having food for when they come through. It is amazing what people will do for chips and dip #oklaed
957803366758875141 2018-01-28 02:31:32 UTC <thnorfar> @rhondaschroeder That is dedication!!! #oklaed
957803195824332800 2018-01-28 02:30:51 UTC <thnorfar> @wallmover I would suggest starting small like your department. Ask them to come just for 10 minutes on a planning period. If you dont think that would work. Try sharing what your students have said and how it has helped you. #Oklaed
957802785784942593 2018-01-28 02:29:13 UTC <thnorfar> @WmStubbs Please listen and share if you feel so moved! @OKCPS is deep tonight! #oklaed
957802613306744833 2018-01-28 02:28:32 UTC <thnorfar> @andredaughty Wow. I only had 1 and 4 on my list as well. My other pros: 1. Data on for me to see if I am reaching my goal 2. Ability to control my own development 3. Its a real evaluation. Especially by students. They dont care about my feelings at the high school level #Oklaed
957802087831785477 2018-01-28 02:26:27 UTC <thnorfar> Ditto!! We rock! #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/rhondaschroeder/status/957802004302221313
957802003383627776 2018-01-28 02:26:07 UTC <thnorfar> You guys are really chatting. I would like to do a shameless plug for us to possibly keep talking about this at @EdCampOKC. Check out our new facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/edcampokc/ #oklaed
957801211314475014 2018-01-28 02:22:58 UTC <thnorfar> @joy4ok Thank you for helping me to do the best for them. I know you are not getting everything you want but I appreciate the fight
957801044968443906 2018-01-28 02:22:18 UTC <thnorfar> @BeckiLaoshi @TurnerJoshuaD That is my hope. I am starting it this week. Have done it informally but like the  ability to discuss w/others who have joined the movement #observeme #Oklaed
957800817360363520 2018-01-28 02:21:24 UTC <thnorfar> @lsmellott You can absolutely use students!!! They are sometimes the best people to observe. Just make sure the form you are giving them to use doesnt allow to give you useless info #oklaed
957800504955990018 2018-01-28 02:20:10 UTC <thnorfar> Are the postings moving to fast for you to keep up? Been there. Remember just respond as you feel and say what you feel. Also take time to jam to the grammys. I did :) #oklaedpic.twitter.com/lNCrmpOSpo
957800203637215232 2018-01-28 02:18:58 UTC <thnorfar> I love Taras multi-layered method for getting people to giver her feedback. I am going to make a sign like this for this week #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/TynansClass/status/929719017379639296
957800011617710080 2018-01-28 02:18:12 UTC <thnorfar> Here is one persons request for feedback. It hangs outside her wall #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/Lindsey_Bohler/status/929714150485385216
957799841610043392 2018-01-28 02:17:31 UTC <thnorfar> @bridgestyler Okay, I cant resist it. You get my first round of applause meme. #Oklaedpic.twitter.com/IlSNjl08Pf
957799584713138178 2018-01-28 02:16:30 UTC <thnorfar> @BeckiLaoshi It is a new movement. Basically you are intentionally wanting feedback. You can read more about it here: http://robertkaplinsky.com/observeme/ #oklaed
957799412658528261 2018-01-28 02:15:49 UTC <thnorfar> You got it @MrGragg #observeme. Its real evaluation. #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/MrGragg/status/957798189335269376
957799201550819328 2018-01-28 02:14:59 UTC <thnorfar> @jmidkiff Why wont you put it outside your door. I have found what I have outside my door helps me to do it #oklaed
957799024760848384 2018-01-28 02:14:17 UTC <thnorfar> @KimberBlodgett Discussions are supposed to be all over the place. Answer a prompt, pose a question or just share out what you feel. Its an unchat like unconference :) #oklaed
957798646019444737 2018-01-28 02:12:46 UTC <thnorfar> @BeckiLaoshi @TurnerJoshuaD It is a new movement of teachers purposely asking people to come observe them and give them specific feedback. Here is a great post about it: http://robertkaplinsky.com/observeme/ #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/BeckiLaoshi/status/957798038952660992
957798210709442561 2018-01-28 02:11:03 UTC <thnorfar> Note for me new people. Dont try to follow every post. I will keep posting the prompts for you. Just talk. Reply or state something #oklaedpic.twitter.com/TvMjXKjQRC
957797903178895360 2018-01-28 02:09:49 UTC <thnorfar> @joy4ok So glad to have your leadership. Cant wait till your visit to my class at the end of February #oklaed

957796974119608320 2018-01-28 02:06:08 UTC <thnorfar> @oueducation @DrTerriC Thanks for always encouraging them to join #Oklaed
957796896420048896 2018-01-28 02:05:49 UTC <thnorfar> @usaodrovers @TeachFromHere But of course. Who can not love @eltonofficial. Glad to see you tonight. #oklaed
957796741155344384 2018-01-28 02:05:12 UTC <thnorfar> @chong2087 NICE!! Welcome to the profession. What do you hope to learn tonight #Oklaed
957796654542999552 2018-01-28 02:04:52 UTC <thnorfar> @rhondaschroeder Nice! #Oklaed
957796588793057280 2018-01-28 02:04:36 UTC <thnorfar> @coach57 Welcome to the chat as always! #oklaed
957796333812895744 2018-01-28 02:03:35 UTC <thnorfar> @oueducation @KFullbrightOU Welcome to the #oklaed chat! Tip is to just respond as it moves you and say what you feel.
957796104971616257 2018-01-28 02:02:41 UTC <thnorfar> @BeckiLaoshi Welcome to #oklaed. Good luck with your PHD. What do you hope to learn tonight.
957795826792845312 2018-01-28 02:01:34 UTC <thnorfar> Hello #Oklaed!!! Are you enjoying U2 right now? Well while you are listening. Lets kick off this chat with some intros. State who you are, where you are from, what you do and what you hope to learn. #Oklaed
957795580872404992 2018-01-28 02:00:36 UTC <thnorfar> @WendyPratt234 Thank you for the shout out! The writer was really kind in person and with her record of us in writing :)
957794172542492673 2018-01-28 01:55:00 UTC <thnorfar> 5 minutes until the #oklaed chat. I will be your host. Join me to discuss #observeme and sidebar conversations about the grammys.
957781533435318272 2018-01-28 01:04:46 UTC <thnorfar> As I am enjoying the grammys I realized it is almost time for #oklaed chat. Dont get too wrapped up if you are watching too. Join me at 8 p.m. to talk about #observeme
957766970455314432 2018-01-28 00:06:54 UTC <thnorfar> I cant believe #oklaed chat is 2 hours away. Hope you are joining me to discuss the #observeme movement. I cant wait to talk about it with you.pic.twitter.com/iNV4LzWWvi
957710709193928704 2018-01-28 20:23:21 UTC <thnorfar> @QueenOKittens This is such a timely reminder!!
957710379802677248 2018-01-28 20:22:02 UTC <thnorfar> @DelCityStuCo @CHSokStuCo Thanks @Mrs_M_Granger for sending a message to Ss. Cant wait to hear their voices.
957701187675058177 2018-01-28 19:45:31 UTC <thnorfar> I am getting so excited about leading #oklaed chat tonight while the Grammys plays in the background. Join me as we discuss #observemepic.twitter.com/ZKbysfGt9B
957653034036850688 2018-01-28 16:34:10 UTC <thnorfar> @Gina_Sese You are so welcome!!
957626398646128640 2018-01-28 14:48:19 UTC <thnorfar> Off to prepare for church. Love chatting with you guys. Enjoy your week. See you next time #sunchat
957625759350317057 2018-01-28 14:45:47 UTC <thnorfar> @rwdavis_edu Trying to finish a book with colleague Chris Fancher. It comes out in August. #sunchat
957625564558438400 2018-01-28 14:45:01 UTC <thnorfar> Anyone knows next weeks topic? #sunchat
957625431531941888 2018-01-28 14:44:29 UTC <thnorfar> @brianrozinsky Great idea!!!!! #sunchat
957625310517846016 2018-01-28 14:44:00 UTC <thnorfar> @deray I was shocked too. We dont have to be hacked by foreign governments. Our own wealth elite is hacking us all the time
957625043583893505 2018-01-28 14:42:56 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch Think of it as more like preparing for my students #sunchat
957624900985991174 2018-01-28 14:42:22 UTC <thnorfar> @markbarnes19 Wow!! I would so be breaking that law. I dont give homework. Kids create their own based upon if they need more time with the concept. #sunchat
957624698761826305 2018-01-28 14:41:34 UTC <thnorfar> @bohndrake @carlameyrink No problem #sunchat
957624524501061634 2018-01-28 14:40:53 UTC <thnorfar> @galindol14 True. #sunchat
957624104592576517 2018-01-28 14:39:12 UTC <thnorfar> @bohndrake @carlameyrink Absolutely. Here is a blank one: https://www.dropbox.com/s/wxs7e0dkia5m2xi/Lesson%20Plan%20Template.docx?dl=0. It has elements from our evaluation system which is marazano. #sunchat
957622881751576576 2018-01-28 14:34:21 UTC <thnorfar> @brianrozinsky @mrclinefhs So true. Those spaces need to be having students turn in their demonstration in some type of way. #sunchat
957622681532329984 2018-01-28 14:33:33 UTC <thnorfar> I did not realize my geometry lesson plan would be liked so much :). I wrote a Precalculus plan that was filmed by BIE as well. Here is that plan. Feel free to share with other math Ts trying to do PBL: https://www.dropbox.com/s/yo9ko0fw284m669/Quadrilaterals%20and%20Polygons-2D%20Focus.pdf?dl=0 #sunchat
957621927497084928 2018-01-28 14:30:33 UTC <thnorfar> @bohndrake @carlameyrink So true. That is one of the reasons why a few years ago we changed our lesson plan template. We needed to include evaluation elements but also flexibility, needed to understand Ts with multiple preps and something that wouldnt take hours. Ours takes 30 minutes or less #sunchat
957621532859273216 2018-01-28 14:28:59 UTC <thnorfar> @The_Groffice So agree. I have taught without planning it and my Ss learned something but not what I intended. #sunchat
957620965458022405 2018-01-28 14:26:44 UTC <thnorfar> This is my schools lesson plan designed by us to be at a unit level. No need to turn in every week but each unit. I made it highly specific because I am featured in a new book by BIE and they needed more specifics for filming purposes: https://www.dropbox.com/s/yo9ko0fw284m669/Quadrilaterals%20and%20Polygons-2D%20Focus.pdf?dl=0 #sunchat
957620110210060289 2018-01-28 14:23:20 UTC <thnorfar> @mrclinefhs I have liked a calendar look but no dates  other than when I have to begin and end as my colleagues and I have decided. #sunchat
957619838435938304 2018-01-28 14:22:15 UTC <thnorfar> The real benefit I have found in some type of written plan is the ability to be even better at responding in the moment in the classroom. I have already taken a few hours to think about all of the things I may need to do based upon what they do. #sunchat
957619402656157696 2018-01-28 14:20:31 UTC <thnorfar> @mrclinefhs I think that is the part of a plan that should no longer be there. Actual day to day looks is not possible if you are paying attention to students. Learning targets and possible learning strategies are essential to know and have in a plan #sunchat
957618977131388929 2018-01-28 14:18:50 UTC <thnorfar> @brianrozinsky @carlameyrink You have changed my entire outlook on the value of a lesson plan when something may occur. What is required in your lesson plan. #sunchat
957618810089017344 2018-01-28 14:18:10 UTC <thnorfar> I am wondering if we are mixing lesson plans with what activities we want kids to do or what we actually want them to learn. To me a lesson plan is about what I am wanting them to learn. Dont need to change what they are supposed to learn #sunchat
957618444693884928 2018-01-28 14:16:43 UTC <thnorfar> @DebbiSab I do #pbl too and I dont have kids on the same page but they are all following most of my plan #sunchat
957618013892734976 2018-01-28 14:15:00 UTC <thnorfar> @valerietilton Nice!
957617950592323584 2018-01-28 14:14:45 UTC <thnorfar> P2 I have worked on these four questions with my colleagues for over 5 yrs. Changed my practice and cant do it with it not being written down somewhere somehow. #sunchathttps://twitter.com/thnorfar/status/957617739925016577
957617739925016577 2018-01-28 14:13:55 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch I have seen plans that are over 5 pages long. I believe you need to know the answer to these 4 questions: 1. What do you want them to know? 2. How will you know they know it? 3. What will you do with those who dont. 4. What will you do about those who already do #sunchat
957617029535731713 2018-01-28 14:11:06 UTC <thnorfar> Being a slight bad guy: I get everyones point but you need to have a plan. How do you really achieve your plan if nothing is written down.  Check out https://www.huffingtonpost.com/marymorrissey/the-power-of-writing-down_b_12002348.html #sunchat
957616264486248448 2018-01-28 14:08:03 UTC <thnorfar> @valerietilton GM! So jealous of your temperature. Trying to stay warm right now :) #sunchat
957616038656577537 2018-01-28 14:07:09 UTC <thnorfar> Some lesson plans have gotten out of control but the idea is good. You need to do more than go chapter by chapter. #sunchat

955265179125723137 2018-01-21 02:25:41 UTC <thnorfar> @AndreaEger @FunstonWM There is a male that is reporting a lot too but I am blanking on his name.

955263936890331136 2018-01-21 02:20:45 UTC <thnorfar> @ClaudiaSwisher @bridgestyler Ditto! She should run for office :) #OklaEd
955262311773691910 2018-01-21 02:14:17 UTC <thnorfar> A2: I think I have meet everyone except the out of state people. I would love to meet them in person. #oklaed
955262128000258048 2018-01-21 02:13:33 UTC <thnorfar> @mcappsparks @djthoreson I agree there was so much going on. We will have to do lunch maybe at the march meeting.

955260892098256897 2018-01-21 02:08:39 UTC <thnorfar> A1: Everyone on #oklaed and my coworkers at NWC. #oklaed
955260511217733633 2018-01-21 02:07:08 UTC <thnorfar> @jefferson_first That is an award on speed! #oklaed
955260206539247616 2018-01-21 02:05:55 UTC <thnorfar> @BeckiLaoshi Oh, no. I am so sorry. You sure joining us wont make you happy?? #OklaEd

955202958559412226 2018-01-21 22:18:26 UTC <thnorfar> @carlameyrink That is brilliant. It is a gateway to the professional development adults do to improve!! Im telling you. You are making me want to move!!
955184705644716032 2018-01-21 21:05:54 UTC <thnorfar> @carlameyrink Please please do. Some of these align with my desires. What is the light pink topic?
955100521618079745 2018-01-21 15:31:23 UTC <thnorfar> @JuliePJones @Tripa__ Took me about 4 years to know most of them and thats easily on the 100s 
955100100048642048 2018-01-21 15:29:43 UTC <thnorfar> @PMcPeake1 It is a pleasure to have you on the team!! Your kids are blessed to have you. Glad education gets to have you too.
955087731645960192 2018-01-21 14:40:34 UTC <thnorfar> @PMcPeake1 I noticed your bio says you are a grandparent. Do you mind me asking how many children and grandchildren you have? What made you an advocate for education?
955087520882216960 2018-01-21 14:39:44 UTC <thnorfar> @PMcPeake1 absolutely. I sympathize w/them as well. Teenagers are a hard group. I know they cant wait till they leave sometimes LOL.
955087158020333571 2018-01-21 14:38:17 UTC <thnorfar> Great chat everyone!! see you next week. #sunchat
955086566627708929 2018-01-21 14:35:56 UTC <thnorfar> My favorite quote that is guiding my reflection journey is by John Dewey: We do not learn from experience... we learn from reflecting on experience. #sunchat
955086339292254208 2018-01-21 14:35:02 UTC <thnorfar> During a unit, students set goals and then track their goals and reflect on their progress in @sowntogrow. Love this tool and will keep using it instead of paper form. #sunchat
955086109121372160 2018-01-21 14:34:07 UTC <thnorfar> I also love doing padiea seminars. Havent been able to do too much in my small classroom. But I love the reflection build in.

955085704148738049 2018-01-21 14:32:31 UTC <thnorfar> I just realized I havent shared much of what I have done. When my students do a PBL, I use a specific reflection journal. See one here:https://www.dropbox.com/s/h6iqoutg5ec8lcx/Reflective%20Journal.pdf?dl=0
955085069735129088 2018-01-21 14:29:59 UTC <thnorfar> @JuliePJones @Tripa__ I thought you may be talking about the curriculum but wasnt sure. Education has a lot of acronyms with the same letter but mean different things. Forewarning as you enter our world :). Welcome!
955084322821812224 2018-01-21 14:27:01 UTC <thnorfar> @PMcPeake1 THAT is so awesome! Can I share this on my blog? I get parents wanting to ease out but their brains are crazy. I need them to not ease out too much.
955083611287576576 2018-01-21 14:24:12 UTC <thnorfar> @carlameyrink What are some examples of their SEL goals and steps? Would love to adopt this. #sunchat
955083353262346240 2018-01-21 14:23:10 UTC <thnorfar> @PMcPeake1 Good point!! Would you be willing to do it even if your child is in high school? I have found parents want to start to step out and let their children lead at this stage. Inspection is more their role #sunchat
955082971614244866 2018-01-21 14:21:39 UTC <thnorfar> @Tripa__ Please expand on your PBL charts, CBM and peer reflection. Is there specific tools you use or a protocol? #sunchat
955081945578377216 2018-01-21 14:17:35 UTC <thnorfar> @tiffanytruitt thanks! I a going to try that.
955081202368688128 2018-01-21 14:14:37 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch I like that!
955081039038308352 2018-01-21 14:13:58 UTC <thnorfar> @tiffanytruitt Did they utilize it? Other than drawing on my whiteboards or doing math. Havent been successful with them getting up to utilize other things. Have wondered if it is a high school thing? #sunchat
955080523776487426 2018-01-21 14:11:56 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch @Dr_LMR You too!

955080188043415553 2018-01-21 14:10:36 UTC <thnorfar> Reflection has been my focus for the last 2 years. Still need a lot of help with it Latest tool I have started to use is http://sowntogrow.com #sunchat

953958698812149760 2018-01-18 11:54:12 UTC <thnorfar> @buildermike @gmccortney is right about more money not going to teachers. Lottery didnt do it. We are at a crisis level now and thats why it will happen.
953958122565054464 2018-01-18 11:51:54 UTC <thnorfar> Great things happen in all #oklaed schools especially @OKCPS schools https://twitter.com/oksde/status/953708657337827328

953119996510687233 2018-01-15 04:21:29 UTC <thnorfar> @craftEDcm Thanks so much!!
952741441725444097 2018-01-14 03:17:15 UTC <thnorfar> @morgan_sharpton @MrsBeck25 Okay, you have motivated me to move it to the top of my list.
952740340733304832 2018-01-14 03:12:52 UTC <thnorfar> @morgan_sharpton @MrsBeck25 That is the impression I got from my niece. Her son is reading it in school. I am so distraught by our country right now, I wonder if this book will send me over the edge
952737994930343936 2018-01-14 03:03:33 UTC <thnorfar> You were amazing @awelcomepic.twitter.com/nsoMnlfO8L
952736949000966144 2018-01-14 02:59:24 UTC <thnorfar> @awelcome Ahh! Thanks for the clarification.
952736791626485760 2018-01-14 02:58:46 UTC <thnorfar> @MrsBeck25 I just found out about the book the hate you give!!! It is a great book. Going to buy it tomorrow. #oklaed
952736500634083331 2018-01-14 02:57:37 UTC <thnorfar> A6: I am a math T. Not many opportunities to read to them. However, we do talk about what we are reading during their work time #OklaEd
952736021120192512 2018-01-14 02:55:43 UTC <thnorfar> @awelcome What is #RunLAP?
952735820288544768 2018-01-14 02:54:55 UTC <thnorfar> @jefferson_first I picked up a great phrase from one of my husbands coworkers. He says, this sounds like something that is none of my business. I love that phrase!
952735441970753536 2018-01-14 02:53:24 UTC <thnorfar> Yeah, we often dont like to look in the mirror. Its okay to say some of your Ts are a mess :). We wont tell ;-) #OklaEdhttps://twitter.com/rhondaschroeder/status/952734762564833280
952734905590517761 2018-01-14 02:51:17 UTC <thnorfar> @jefferson_first is a boss!! We all should be more like her. #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/MrsBeck25/status/952734295478726662
952734273219584000 2018-01-14 02:48:46 UTC <thnorfar> @MrP_tchr I so enjoy the moment that I forget the pictures and I wish I had a physical memory :) #OklaEd
952733992465453057 2018-01-14 02:47:39 UTC <thnorfar> A5: That is such a hard one. Especially the last year with local and federal politics. I try to shake it off as quickly as possible. Sometimes is is a literal shaking of my body #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/awelcome/status/952732319277752320
952733603540107264 2018-01-14 02:46:06 UTC <thnorfar> @andredaughty She is. She is!!! That is why she is teacher of the year #oklaed
952733341266178048 2018-01-14 02:45:04 UTC <thnorfar> @dot2teach I was thinking that!! Its hard to turn off when you are a natural turned up person #OklaEd
952733148881842177 2018-01-14 02:44:18 UTC <thnorfar> @MrsBeck25 @bridgestyler @andredaughty @ebarnes73 @Mark_Moring @jefferson_first @beauchamp_adam @MrsHime @coach57 @OB1_Knabe @GauntTonya @vperezy Just tell them to turn the music off like they did at the golden globes :) #oklaed

952731893295976448 2018-01-14 02:39:18 UTC <thnorfar> A4: Still working on this one. Getting better. Actually not working on anything for a few hours a day is what I have been able to accomplish. #OklaEd

952730248050823173 2018-01-14 02:32:46 UTC <thnorfar> @vperezy Its okay. You just mentioned him now :) #oklaed
952729655026569216 2018-01-14 02:30:25 UTC <thnorfar> A3: I have an awesome husband and family that support me. I pray a lot to fight doubt. I battle more with rejection than doubt. I also have the best math PLC group in the world. #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/kasnelson/status/952727788980768768
952728648137740288 2018-01-14 02:26:25 UTC <thnorfar> Tell Danielle HI!!! Hope she can jump on with her own handle next time.https://twitter.com/andredaughty/status/952726469381419008
952728449801768960 2018-01-14 02:25:37 UTC <thnorfar> @MrsBeck25 Amen! #oklaed
952728351449415680 2018-01-14 02:25:14 UTC <thnorfar> @KathySDunn @room20awesome @MrGragg That is so true. We have to try if we believe it will help students but we have to make sure it worked and to keep it up if it continues to work. Dont chase every shiny object #oklaed
952727893276282880 2018-01-14 02:23:25 UTC <thnorfar> @MrDougCampbell Amen!!! #OklaEd
952727820937105408 2018-01-14 02:23:07 UTC <thnorfar> @MrsBeck25 So true. I feel so sorry for people who are micromanaged or just humiliated by superiors. #OklaEd
952727600836816896 2018-01-14 02:22:15 UTC <thnorfar> @bmilla84 YEAH!! It is hard sometimes to get to that place. So glad you are there like me #oklaed
952727295093100544 2018-01-14 02:21:02 UTC <thnorfar> @awelcome I live by the motto. People dont care how much you know until they know how much you care #OklaEd
952727093917442048 2018-01-14 02:20:14 UTC <thnorfar> @HartfordJimmy Cool!
952727027030937600 2018-01-14 02:19:58 UTC <thnorfar> @mcappsparks @djthoreson Good idea. I will look out for you guys in the opening session.
952726748436881408 2018-01-14 02:18:52 UTC <thnorfar> A2: Not knowing how I want to implement it or not having the equipment yet. Usually a short period of time #OklaEd
952725967335776261 2018-01-14 02:15:46 UTC <thnorfar> @NowakRo WOW! That is wonderful #OklaEd
952725769691828230 2018-01-14 02:14:58 UTC <thnorfar> @brigitm7 Welcome!! Tips: Dont try to keep up. Just respond and read as it hits you. Use tweetdeck or hoot suite. #OklaEd
952724918298226688 2018-01-14 02:11:35 UTC <thnorfar> A1: I love finding out something they need and giving it to them. Getting a shower cap for one student tomorrow #OklaEd
952724213181435905 2018-01-14 02:08:47 UTC <thnorfar> @HartfordJimmy That is an interesting class. What is it about #OklaEd
952723399238979591 2018-01-14 02:05:33 UTC <thnorfar> @LadyFTerrance Ahh. In my training. People always said curriculum is the organization of the standards but how is completely up to you or a building or a district if they want to e that specific.
952723025782362112 2018-01-14 02:04:04 UTC <thnorfar> @mcappsparks @djthoreson Yep!
952722743123959813 2018-01-14 02:02:57 UTC <thnorfar> @effortfuleduktr Nice to see you on this chat as well! I like beginning my day w/#sunchat and ending w/#OklaEd
952722540056731648 2018-01-14 02:02:08 UTC <thnorfar> @cdrehle Welcome to #oklaed chat.
952722397941125120 2018-01-14 02:01:35 UTC <thnorfar> Hi @awelcome! I am a math T at NWC in @OKCPS. Glad to talk about #KidsDeserveIt right before MLK day. #oklaed
952551875689287680 2018-01-14 14:43:59 UTC <thnorfar> I gotta run too. Have a wonderful holiday everyone. Try to serve some how or somewhere in honor of MLK. #sunchathttps://twitter.com/tiffanytruitt/status/952550666261749760
952551290931990528 2018-01-14 14:41:39 UTC <thnorfar> @Ms_A_Yeh @TheJimMcClain @polonerd True but we have to remember to do it respectfully. Know of a person who did this but in such the wrong way. #sunchat
952551008751800327 2018-01-14 14:40:32 UTC <thnorfar> @hayes_melisa @susankotch I love these videos on classroom management specifically behavior: https://vimeo.com/142645382 and https://vimeo.com/131774396 #sunchat
952549248255619072 2018-01-14 14:33:32 UTC <thnorfar> @Ms_A_Yeh @TheJimMcClain So glad it never happened to me in my career. I would definitely become an administrators worst nightmare if that is what they want to pursue. I would say no lovingly though #sunchat
952548879349805058 2018-01-14 14:32:04 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch @carlameyrink People who care and want to work will always do things from home. I am not sure you can ever stop that. I think having less classes than planning time like Japan is the best goal #sunchat
952548518148870150 2018-01-14 14:30:38 UTC <thnorfar> @TheJimMcClain I thought those days were finally over for the scripted teaching. Darn it!! It needs to die a horrible death. #sunchat
952548244848103424 2018-01-14 14:29:33 UTC <thnorfar> @carlameyrink @susankotch LOL!!! So true.#sunchat
952548121908862976 2018-01-14 14:29:04 UTC <thnorfar> @mistershayELA What state are you?
952547935492993024 2018-01-14 14:28:19 UTC <thnorfar> @TheJimMcClain I like the lite!! There were so many things that had the + for math. That was just optional anyway. I like that you guys choose to do even less so that mastery is almost possible #sunchat
952547661571379200 2018-01-14 14:27:14 UTC <thnorfar> It sounds like we are teaching the same type of students. I keep saying one day I will not know when everyones court date is #sunchathttps://twitter.com/TheJimMcClain/status/952544442292097024
952547134913556482 2018-01-14 14:25:09 UTC <thnorfar> I asked my ? bc we seem to be sharing the how and not much of the what. I am really curious what people teach at particular grade levels. Is everyone using CC? My state had to drop it. #sunchat
952546725696278528 2018-01-14 14:23:31 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch I am going to be just like @carlameyrink when I grow up. It is also why her Ts gotta turn in lesson plans. They are not told what to do! Making me think about moving again #sunchat
952546216470040576 2018-01-14 14:21:30 UTC <thnorfar> Curriculum is what to teach not how to teach right? #sunchat
952545304959684608 2018-01-14 14:17:52 UTC <thnorfar> @mistershayELA We are a contracted group who conducts their training, assists with creating training and sometimes blogs as well. Maybe you can consider applying when they hire again.
952544975484588032 2018-01-14 14:16:34 UTC <thnorfar> @jgroteweb Wow! 5-8 is a spread of personalities. You are so right on their honesty and how they are committed to you if you are to them.
952544661075365888 2018-01-14 14:15:19 UTC <thnorfar> @tiffanytruitt They probably wont fire me since my school made me teacher of the year this year and I was PAMST state finalist as well :)
952544407051522048 2018-01-14 14:14:18 UTC <thnorfar> @mistershayELA Cool!! If you havent, I would also check out http://bie.org. I am a NF for them and they have GREAT material and training.
952544001424527365 2018-01-14 14:12:42 UTC <thnorfar> @jgroteweb I admire all elementary and middle school educators/principals. You are so brave #sunchat
952543826001956864 2018-01-14 14:12:00 UTC <thnorfar> We add what kids are deficit and need. We change (leave out) what they dont absolutely need for the next year #sunchat
952543659953704960 2018-01-14 14:11:20 UTC <thnorfar> Dont tell my district leaders but I change our curriculum all the time. Our PLC decides what to emphasize because of other courses. #sunchat
952543004052598784 2018-01-14 14:08:44 UTC <thnorfar> @mistershayELA You are a PBL person? I am a PBL person. Nice to meet you!! Blogging better this year about it. http://pbl-birdside.blogspot.com #sunchat
952542754978004992 2018-01-14 14:07:44 UTC <thnorfar> @tiffanytruitt So true!!!! #sunchat
952542594717880321 2018-01-14 14:07:06 UTC <thnorfar> @Ms_A_Yeh I understand. I started back last week and it was hard :) #sunchat
952542342300434432 2018-01-14 14:06:06 UTC <thnorfar> GM everyone from Oklahoma City where the high will be 52!! Glad to have school church before church. Math T #sunchat

950199413481275392 2018-01-07 02:56:08 UTC <thnorfar> A10: Dont know if I taught as much as modeled. I care about them is what I did last and hope to continue to do #oklaed
950198979513417728 2018-01-07 02:54:25 UTC <thnorfar> A9 2017-No configuration to the classroom for about a week and then student chosen 2018-Still student choice but different arrangement of students #oklaed
950198382424928257 2018-01-07 02:52:02 UTC <thnorfar> @room20awesome Isnt that so funny how we work to get more empowerment to our students and sometimes they just like it plain. #oklaed
950197795075579904 2018-01-07 02:49:42 UTC <thnorfar> @jlreed2011 @watersenglish congrats on book work. I did that too. When will it be published and what is it about? #oklaed
950197489075974144 2018-01-07 02:48:29 UTC <thnorfar> A8: I have been working on it all year. It is Self-Regulation in the classroom by Richard Cash #oklaed
950197120795140096 2018-01-07 02:47:02 UTC <thnorfar> So hate I missed so much of tonight. I got caught up watching the Golden Globes! #oklaed
950034820616413184 2018-01-07 16:02:06 UTC <thnorfar> I just joined the High Quality Project Based Learning campaign. Visit http://HQPBL.org to join #HQPBL #PBL
950022218251153409 2018-01-07 15:12:02 UTC <thnorfar> @Studentschamp @susankotch @DennisDill @carlameyrink This just shows why people have to know the why when doing something. So simple yet so helpful #sunchat
950020131828260870 2018-01-07 15:03:44 UTC <thnorfar> @DennisDill @mrclinefhs @TheJimMcClain @nolagirlfromtx Good point. I certainly believe there is a time to change the discussion. Sometimes I feel like the negative people are setting the tone of education. We gotta challenge them at times.
950019694156709888 2018-01-07 15:02:00 UTC <thnorfar> Have a great week everyone! #sunchat
950019608458809344 2018-01-07 15:01:39 UTC <thnorfar> @Studentschamp @DennisDill @susankotch @carlameyrink We turn in emergency lesson plans for that reason. Good point of why we turn them in though. #sunchat
950018627138441216 2018-01-07 14:57:45 UTC <thnorfar> @mrclinefhs @DennisDill @TheJimMcClain I have some former teachers who do that. Its great to catch ups with friends
950018428517134336 2018-01-07 14:56:58 UTC <thnorfar> @TheJimMcClain @susankotch @historycomics @DennisDill Thats what wives do!! PLNs and students are great too.
950018298472816640 2018-01-07 14:56:27 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch @DennisDill @Studentschamp You are welcome!! Remember that statement the next time you hear a person doesnt like you. They are haters in disguise. #sunchat
950017405945876480 2018-01-07 14:52:54 UTC <thnorfar> @TheJimMcClain @DennisDill So sorry about being blindsided. I have found out you always find out about who people really are. I just prefer I find out from what they do to other people :(. #sunchat
950016669904265216 2018-01-07 14:49:59 UTC <thnorfar> @Studentschamp @DennisDill @susankotch @mrclinefhs Thats what I do now as well. However, I am seeing that something about formally writing it makes me rethink in a way I dont when I dont have it on paper.
950016339401469952 2018-01-07 14:48:40 UTC <thnorfar> @DennisDill @TheJimMcClain @mrclinefhs So true!!! I work with everyone but I dont fellowship with them all. #suncht
950016079404961792 2018-01-07 14:47:38 UTC <thnorfar> @Studentschamp @susankotch @DennisDill Gotcha. I caught that you said you plan. I thought you didnt write it down at all. Sorry, they make you submit a particular form. They should take however you wrote it. #sunchat
950015227684446209 2018-01-07 14:44:15 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch @DennisDill @Studentschamp I am so wanting to move to PA to work for you!!!! Darn it. #sunchat
950015045177626626 2018-01-07 14:43:31 UTC <thnorfar> @TheJimMcClain @DennisDill So glad. #sunchat
950014929171558400 2018-01-07 14:43:04 UTC <thnorfar> @TheJimMcClain I promise I wont tell anyone. Didnt have one when I started teaching so really never knew how to use one (LOL) #sunchat
950014377599651840 2018-01-07 14:40:52 UTC <thnorfar> @Studentschamp @DennisDill @susankotch I so get everyones thoughts on lesson planning formally. Although I havent done it much this year, I have to say it makes a difference. It is something about thinking through an entire unit on paper. I think I am better when I do it. #sunchat
950013474024906753 2018-01-07 14:37:17 UTC <thnorfar> @tiffanytruitt I am using that tomorrow!!!!! #sunchat
950013258412511233 2018-01-07 14:36:25 UTC <thnorfar> @TheJimMcClain I was doing training in IN around that time. It was a rough time for your state. So glad I still have security. Low pay is causing our shortage. #sunchat
950012737727422464 2018-01-07 14:34:21 UTC <thnorfar> @tiffanytruitt @carlameyrink I am so glad I decided you are my virtual idol already. I would so be jealous. If no one can come, can I plan on coming to see you next winter? I have a long break. I can be there as soon as school is out :) #sunchat
950012187782930438 2018-01-07 14:32:10 UTC <thnorfar> @mrbalcom I am with you. That is part of how I can get them to reach my goal. Want to help each other trouble shoot ideas? #sunchat
950012029594669057 2018-01-07 14:31:32 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch @Studentschamp Please write a blog or give some PD to principals on that!!! I really dont understand why people dont think of that first. 1st law of leadership to me #sunchat
950011606016151552 2018-01-07 14:29:51 UTC <thnorfar> @TheJimMcClain Amen!!! I have trouble w/people wanting to just get by. So glad a coworker is retiring. Taught the same way his whole career-book only. Any have suggestions on preventing this? #sunchat
950010801791864832 2018-01-07 14:26:40 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch @Studentschamp Can you be my principal!!! I dont know why people cant start with hearing peoples needs #sunchat
950010131521200134 2018-01-07 14:24:00 UTC <thnorfar> @TheJimMcClain I am almost there. I do everything but comply with directions. Well, I dont always comply. Sometimes they are just too stupid to follow #sunchat
950009795813236736 2018-01-07 14:22:40 UTC <thnorfar> @SolutionSquad @historycomics What!! Jim, you are amazing!!!! #sunchat

950007471682342912 2018-01-07 14:13:26 UTC <thnorfar> I am working on my classroom objective students will know how to learn, unlearn and relearn #sunchat
950007015690199040 2018-01-07 14:11:37 UTC <thnorfar> @mrclinefhs Never heard of it #sunchat

950005298814767105 2018-01-07 14:04:48 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch So sorry! I prefer cold over heat (dry or humid) but there can be too much cold. #sunchat

949833845196587009 2018-01-06 02:43:30 UTC <thnorfar> @OKCPS @SteeleThoughts @edu_sanders70 Does that mean you want to come observe one day????
949820895907983360 2018-01-06 01:52:03 UTC <thnorfar> @SteeleThoughts @edu_sanders70 I think we finally are there in the math department @ NWC in @OKCPS. I think it was celebrating and having a structure to our PLC time that developed it. Feel free to come check us out.#oklaed
949802291619684353 2018-01-06 00:38:07 UTC <thnorfar> @OK_PSRC @KimberBlodgett Thank you :). Just trying to catch up to you.

942581733282795520 2017-12-17 02:26:12 UTC <thnorfar> @KimberBlodgett You are welcome to use my survey. It is always revealing:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SgB0HlDapVs27zxE1-8qQXz2pkWul2_WP6mwvZ81Tw0/edit

942579893572907009 2017-12-17 02:18:53 UTC <thnorfar> @djthoreson Enough said right here! #oklaed
942579408702976000 2017-12-17 02:16:57 UTC <thnorfar> @KimberBlodgett Ohh, I mess items up. Its why I ask students every semester for their feedback. They remind me of what I am doing wrong #oklaed
942579214624190466 2017-12-17 02:16:11 UTC <thnorfar> @grendelrick Every year, I think of a Ss I love and a Ss I wish was absent. I think of what traits I want both of them to have and then structure my class to fulfill it. #oklaed
942578389549973505 2017-12-17 02:12:54 UTC <thnorfar> @KimberBlodgett Thanks for reminding me how much I cant mess this stuff up. #oklaed
942578033227190272 2017-12-17 02:11:30 UTC <thnorfar> @bakerleft You are giving me hope again. Thank you for that #oklaed
942577907565809669 2017-12-17 02:11:00 UTC <thnorfar> @bridgestyler I like that why. So many people dont think about adding to other people. It is the best way for us to get better #oklaed
942577656163381249 2017-12-17 02:10:00 UTC <thnorfar> Everything I do is about love. I often ask my students: Have I told you how much I love you today? They always smile and blush. #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/bridgestyler/status/942576729964662784
942577262246887424 2017-12-17 02:08:26 UTC <thnorfar> @watersenglish This is so necessary. Too often we give them a voice instead of letting theirs shine through #oklaed
942576981757104128 2017-12-17 02:07:19 UTC <thnorfar> Most definitely LOL #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/SethMeier/status/942576060096446464
942576624981159936 2017-12-17 02:05:54 UTC <thnorfar> Telannia aka T. Math T at NWC in @OKCPS. Glad to be w/#oklaed tonight. Need a distraction from my family loss.
940080139752189952 2017-12-10 04:45:45 UTC <thnorfar> @ClaudiaSwisher It does feel like that. I just think they don't see the effects of their actions quick enough. It is going to be years before we see the real damage we are doing. We make up for a lot of their wrong as well.
940079170435944448 2017-12-10 04:41:54 UTC <thnorfar> @Christy_writes Forgot to say thanks for this info. I didnt know we were really bad at how many principals we have per student. I know some sups are principals too.
940078598718812160 2017-12-10 04:39:38 UTC <thnorfar> @ClaudiaSwisher I understand we are not the rule. I just wanted people to know that it is not always bad. I think the key is mentoring. All Ts need a mentor
940053389039230976 2017-12-10 02:59:27 UTC <thnorfar> @watersenglish yeah. we dont see to but I think 1 S, 1T at a time, we make progress.
940053166233546758 2017-12-10 02:58:34 UTC <thnorfar> A5. I am researching my new leg. Loved my old one. Right now, I am frustrated with local and national leg. Really considering leaving the US #oklaed
940052521581551616 2017-12-10 02:56:01 UTC <thnorfar> A4. I know we have been asking for $5000 to negotiate. I say we get the same raise as legislatures. Every year and above inflation rates. #oklaed
940051678023188482 2017-12-10 02:52:40 UTC <thnorfar> @watersenglish Absolutely! That is what I think we do now but that was not the norm for a lot of people who are making decisions now. I even help people find a new profession if it seems like mentoring doesnt help #OklaEd
940051356303241216 2017-12-10 02:51:23 UTC <thnorfar> I like where your head is at. Unfortunately, we dont have a lot of heads like ours :(. #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/dougeb00/status/940050540813156352
940051089323200512 2017-12-10 02:50:19 UTC <thnorfar> A4: Given the possible new tax plan. It doesnt matter how much. I wont get to see much of it anyway #OklaEd
940050925338599425 2017-12-10 02:49:40 UTC <thnorfar> @SNU_MAEL @James409Jason @grendelrick AMEN!!! #oklaed
940050833890205696 2017-12-10 02:49:18 UTC <thnorfar> @watersenglish Too many parents dont know how to take that on. It is also just more common for people to run away-hence charters, voucher movement. #oklaed
940050421921411072 2017-12-10 02:47:40 UTC <thnorfar> So true. More schools with the same money is always a drain on resources. #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/angmlittle/status/940050068840767494
940050172188418048 2017-12-10 02:46:40 UTC <thnorfar> So much for me lurking LOL. I am going to be up late. Did we ever get anything other than Q3? #oklaed
940049918508515328 2017-12-10 02:45:40 UTC <thnorfar> @andredaughty So so true. However, this doesnt mean they are always doing the right thing. We have to get better at educating what is a good education. Letter grade is not always true #OklaEd
940048696103780358 2017-12-10 02:40:49 UTC <thnorfar> @watersenglish Both. We all had bad Ts that were never let go. Ts didnt hold other Ts responsible and neither did the system. I believe current Ps remember and want better for their kids. They dont trust Ts or current system to prevent bad Ts #oklaed
940047862758481921 2017-12-10 02:37:30 UTC <thnorfar> @vperezy We the teachers. All of us had bad teachers when we were students. They werent let go and they should be. People are reacting to that I think #oklaed
940047448726159365 2017-12-10 02:35:51 UTC <thnorfar> @BrightstarTeach Okay
940047152025186306 2017-12-10 02:34:40 UTC <thnorfar> @Christy_writes @grendelrick Sorry. I wasnt meaning principals. I was talking about sups. Every district has 1. There are over 500 districts in the state. #OklaEd
940046744489943043 2017-12-10 02:33:03 UTC <thnorfar> #OkLeg doesnt get that. I dont now why but they dont get that. #OklaEdhttps://twitter.com/dawnbrockman/status/940046185837891584
940046254611951616 2017-12-10 02:31:06 UTC <thnorfar> Dont shoot. I think we caused this wanting choice problem. Too many genuine bad experiences and we let it happen #oklaed
940045549809496064 2017-12-10 02:28:18 UTC <thnorfar> Drop the mic #OklaEdhttps://twitter.com/DA_Houston/status/940045429219082245
940044381976805382 2017-12-10 02:23:40 UTC <thnorfar> The states I am talking about has as many schools as we do. Just not as many administrations. Think 50K for sup times 536 districts. #OklaEd
940043969454424064 2017-12-10 02:22:02 UTC <thnorfar> @BrightstarTeach You absolutely will surpass me! #oklaed
940043119214465025 2017-12-10 02:18:39 UTC <thnorfar> True. We do have a lot of idiots. However, I have been to states with less districts. Much more efficient and effective #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/James409Jason/status/940042784429375488
940042666393288707 2017-12-10 02:16:51 UTC <thnorfar> So true. The support is not like when I got certified. #OklaEdhttps://twitter.com/ChrisParadise/status/940042514337226752
940042033246363655 2017-12-10 02:14:20 UTC <thnorfar> I am alternatively certified. In my 11th year. Was named PAMST and TOY this year. We are not all bad #OklaEd
940040249274646528 2017-12-10 02:07:15 UTC <thnorfar> A1: More money coming out of my pocket to pay for items. Also what everyone else has said #OklaEd

937881463407685632 2017-12-04 03:09:00 UTC <thnorfar> @KimberBlodgett That makes it hard to avoid him :(

937873649389973504 2017-12-04 02:37:57 UTC <thnorfar> @room20awesome @bushey_brent sign up here. details being emailed this weekhttp://bit.ly/PBLMathTrain
937856848899780608 2017-12-04 01:31:11 UTC <thnorfar> @MelissaEmler shared how culture is built 30 seconds at a time. Each interaction either builds it or tears it down #modernlearning
937852599998566400 2017-12-04 01:14:18 UTC <thnorfar> @willrich45 said culture is something we take for granted. So true! #modernlearnerspic.twitter.com/8KDROqMpV1
937844119371730944 2017-12-04 00:40:37 UTC <thnorfar> @OKCPS @saintfester Thanks so much James. I always feel I am just working on it :)
937507949177638913 2017-12-03 02:24:47 UTC <thnorfar> @kriscoop80 I am starting to believe that no one cares enough to make #okleg care about #oklaed. It doesnt scare me but very sad. #oklaed
937507460998422528 2017-12-03 02:22:51 UTC <thnorfar> A4: I am doing everything I think of. I am only afraid not to do it. #oklaed
937506985129467904 2017-12-03 02:20:57 UTC <thnorfar> @ebarnes73 @BrightstarTeach Not at all. I am alternatively certified. I was named teacher of the year for my building this past monday and 1 of 4 to receive the states election for PAMEST. #oklaed
937506559923576832 2017-12-03 02:19:16 UTC <thnorfar> @room20awesome I am doing a free training on PBL with a math emphasis. Interested? #oklaed
937506046381297665 2017-12-03 02:17:14 UTC <thnorfar> @TeachFromHere I am going to do some next semester. We will have to share notes! #oklaed
937505666561986560 2017-12-03 02:15:43 UTC <thnorfar> @KimberBlodgett I stopped following him because I kept doing this #oklaedpic.twitter.com/OHHMpKJY8h
937505136657752064 2017-12-03 02:13:37 UTC <thnorfar> A2: I am not really scared to try anything. Sometimes I cant try things w/certain Ss but I do work with 9th graders. #EnoughSaid #oklaed
937504826619056128 2017-12-03 02:12:23 UTC <thnorfar> @MPSTechnology That is not funny but it is. I am not afraid of water but I can so see me doing that about other things #oklaed
937504617679683584 2017-12-03 02:11:33 UTC <thnorfar> @BrightstarTeach I hate to admit there is so much going on that I have disconnected for a few days. What is she doing now? #oklaed
937504367032307713 2017-12-03 02:10:33 UTC <thnorfar> @edgeblogger I ditto but I would take out the republican part. All of them seem to be claiming they are for us and fall short at different times. I do agree Rep do it more often #oklaed
937504063691870208 2017-12-03 02:09:21 UTC <thnorfar> I will share with my colleagues.
937503832245981184 2017-12-03 02:08:26 UTC <thnorfar> @HartfordJimmy I was fine with them until this gif. They are creepy #oklaed
937503691283881984 2017-12-03 02:07:52 UTC <thnorfar> @bushey_brent Yes!! Someone besides me understands this struggle! #oklaed
937503584802963456 2017-12-03 02:07:27 UTC <thnorfar> @TurnerJoshuaD Definitely counts!! I have been so broke being an educator, it doesnt scare me anymore. #oklaed
937503353785012224 2017-12-03 02:06:32 UTC <thnorfar> @ShelbyJr3 Happy birthday!!! #oklaed
937503258611986432 2017-12-03 02:06:09 UTC <thnorfar> @TeachFromHere Yep, that they are. #oklaed
937503199552069632 2017-12-03 02:05:55 UTC <thnorfar> @mrsbussell There are levels? I am so behind on my knowledge of certifications. #oklaed
937502786853507073 2017-12-03 02:04:17 UTC <thnorfar> I hate them with a passion #oklaedpic.twitter.com/0Ah5fxxBp3
937502137239695360 2017-12-03 02:01:42 UTC <thnorfar> I am going to try to ignore the orange. Telannia. Math T at NWC in @OKCPS #oklaed
937498097554509830 2017-12-03 01:45:38 UTC <thnorfar> @OKCPS @HelenWilt Thanks.

937497914544451589 2017-12-03 01:44:55 UTC <thnorfar> @OKCPS @collums_dawn thank you.
937330943597121541 2017-12-03 14:41:26 UTC <thnorfar> @tiffanytruitt Ohhh, you are so right!! I rarely use cahoot for that reason. Great tool to review but it really doesnt transform learning #sunchat
937330229701378048 2017-12-03 14:38:36 UTC <thnorfar> @tiffanytruitt I have started dabbling with it 2 years. I am still trying to learn myself too. Introduced to students but as an option rather than a must. #sunchat
937329873714073600 2017-12-03 14:37:11 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch I often forget what just going outside will do for students. Gotta do that more next semester #sunchat
937328292016934913 2017-12-03 14:30:54 UTC <thnorfar> @MrDataGuy I am still sad he has passed. I am glad he helped the educational system with his experience. #sunchat
937327879926493184 2017-12-03 14:29:15 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch @ZeinaChalich I am going to believe that too :)
937327620110286848 2017-12-03 14:28:13 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch Interactive notebooks are great.I hate when they dont put the top back on the glue stick well & waste a perfectly good glue stick :) #sunchat
937327173173760000 2017-12-03 14:26:27 UTC <thnorfar> @Ms_A_Yeh I think we are still working on that shift as a system. Many dont realize pen and paper is a tech. #sunchat
937326718540447744 2017-12-03 14:24:39 UTC <thnorfar> I love a good card sort!!! #sunchathttps://twitter.com/tiffanytruitt/status/937322324558274560

937322278345375745 2017-12-03 14:07:00 UTC <thnorfar> @miss_adistefano Yeah! glad you are entering the profession. Do you know what grade and area you want to teach? #sunchat
937322151996198912 2017-12-03 14:06:30 UTC <thnorfar> @cshunnarah I so admire you. I would be in a corner in 2 hours if I taught 1st grade. #sunchat

931287930710122496 2017-11-16 22:28:39 UTC <thnorfar> Don't ask if there are any questions. Ask did anyone get a different answer Janet-@MVPmath #nctminnov8 #MTBoS

929901887985541120 2017-11-12 02:41:01 UTC <thnorfar> @ebarnes73 That is pretty bad. The worst I have heard in a while #oklaed
929901742338256898 2017-11-12 02:40:26 UTC <thnorfar> A7 talk with the people directly and issue a consequence to them that is not punitive but in a way that shows them it is not acceptable. #OklaEd
929901031529598976 2017-11-12 02:37:37 UTC <thnorfar> @KimberBlodgett Mine sends emails & highlights people in newsletter. It makes a difference. I would like a raise as well #oklaed
929900663764549632 2017-11-12 02:36:09 UTC <thnorfar> @Bhayes72 The fact that you are new and seeing so many student should be the main reason why people listen to you. #oklaed
929900303712968704 2017-11-12 02:34:43 UTC <thnorfar> A6 I am starting to look into restorative justice as an option. Suspensions don't work. https://www.edutopia.org/article/what-heck-restorative-justice-heather-wolpert-gawron #OklaEd
929899441598926849 2017-11-12 02:31:18 UTC <thnorfar> A5 Form various committees that people can be a part of. My new principal is doing that and I think that is great #OklaEd
929898208171560965 2017-11-12 02:26:24 UTC <thnorfar> A4 I am on my 6th principal in 11 years of the profession. 3 just in the last 4 years. Don't know yet #OklaEd
929897709351424001 2017-11-12 02:24:25 UTC <thnorfar> A2 I miss Springer. When we faced budget cuts, he took a cut to his pay first. That is great leadership #OklaEd
929896592894767104 2017-11-12 02:19:59 UTC <thnorfar> A3 Show your people that you appreciation them as much as you can.  #OklaEd
929896340557123584 2017-11-12 02:18:58 UTC <thnorfar> A2 Great leaders listen and not just tell #OklaEd
929896173216980992 2017-11-12 02:18:18 UTC <thnorfar> Hi, my peeps. Sorry I am late to the party. Got caught up getting ready for tomorrow. Loving the 280 limit :) #OklaEd
929722174751035392 2017-11-12 14:46:54 UTC <thnorfar> Another wonderful chat. Thanks for helping me to grow again. #sunchat
929721637485842433 2017-11-12 14:44:46 UTC <thnorfar> @PMcPeake1 It is a simple thing but easy to forget. Especially in our fast paced world of today.
929721150946664448 2017-11-12 14:42:50 UTC <thnorfar> @mrclinefhs @Lindsey_Bohler @MissMcKnight512 Do you have a picture of the sign outside your door? I am getting inspired by everyones graphic. #sunchat
929720895194763265 2017-11-12 14:41:49 UTC <thnorfar> @nortnik @bethhill2829 @TuckerBrownPE @Lindsey_Bohler I will check it out. You are my neighbor anyway. Go razorbacks :)
929720584111624192 2017-11-12 14:40:35 UTC <thnorfar> One of my goals is to help students know how to learn #sunchat
929720274987159552 2017-11-12 14:39:21 UTC <thnorfar> @TuckerBrownPE I just found out a few weeks ago myself. This is now my second favorite chat. My state chat (#OklaEd) is first #sunchat
929719640791638016 2017-11-12 14:36:50 UTC <thnorfar> @TuckerBrownPE Does that mean you are coming back next week? Would love to pick your brain about PE. #sunchat
929719385161428994 2017-11-12 14:35:49 UTC <thnorfar> Relationships are key. You have to start their before asking your colleagues. To build relationships start by fulfilling a need. #sunchat
929718937192935425 2017-11-12 14:34:02 UTC <thnorfar> @jedikermit That is a problem. I try to tell people that sometimes you need a fresh viewpoint. A person not in ur subject can be like your students. They can tell you if they get it #sunchat
929718265936601088 2017-11-12 14:31:22 UTC <thnorfar> @bethhill2829 Tribe?? Tell me more about your tribe. I like that term #sunchat
929718105839931398 2017-11-12 14:30:44 UTC <thnorfar> @PMcPeake1 @jeremies71 So true. I try to always know other positions people can qualify for to encourage them to be happy
929717883361529857 2017-11-12 14:29:51 UTC <thnorfar> @Media_Barber I thought you meant that. I meet w/Ts three times a week. I am starting there and think it would be huge. However, I dont think you can have enough feedback. I have releases from Ss. I would edit the video if I didnt. Great point! #sunchat
929717284997861377 2017-11-12 14:27:28 UTC <thnorfar> @jeremies71 Thanks for bringing a smile to my face. Their force field can be really thick. I have to remember I cant get tired in well doing #sunchat
929716473458778112 2017-11-12 14:24:15 UTC <thnorfar> @bethhill2829 So true about leaders of schools modeling the expectations. Love your graphic. Where all do you have it posted? #sunchat
929716209033121792 2017-11-12 14:23:12 UTC <thnorfar> @goswivl @Media_Barber When you say others, are you talking about Ts outside of my PLC? Going to put my videos on my blog soon as well #sunchat
929715922243346435 2017-11-12 14:22:03 UTC <thnorfar> @jeremies71 The fact that I can always get better is why I love teaching. I get sad when I see teachers who dont want to grow. How do we help those types? #sunchat
929715625546698754 2017-11-12 14:20:53 UTC <thnorfar> @robertkaplinsky @sig225 Thanks so much for this info. #sunchat
929715395694559234 2017-11-12 14:19:58 UTC <thnorfar> I'm using @goswivl to record myself. We are watching a difficult class I have tomorrow. I think the is a great Pro to a PLC and #observeme #sunchat
929714642380840961 2017-11-12 14:16:58 UTC <thnorfar> @bethhill2829 @Lindsey_Bohler Thanks for the share. I remember this now. So cool. #sunchat
929714005681287168 2017-11-12 14:14:26 UTC <thnorfar> @sig225 @Lindsey_Bohler Thanks! #sunchat
929713828635594752 2017-11-12 14:13:44 UTC <thnorfar> @Stella_Pollard @Ms_A_Yeh That is hard and relationships are so important for coaching. I am thinking you can use a tool like @goswivl and start w/2 or 3 Ts including you #sunchat
929713144506802177 2017-11-12 14:11:01 UTC <thnorfar> @sig225 So is there some type of formal structure too it? A site where it gives details? #sunchat
929712697737965570 2017-11-12 14:09:15 UTC <thnorfar> Agree. It sounds like #observeme is asking people to come see your classroom and give you feedback. Can it be anyone or just Ts? #sunchathttps://twitter.com/Media_Barber/status/929712080432836608
929711825196863489 2017-11-12 14:05:46 UTC <thnorfar> @Stella_Pollard What do you like about it? #sunchat

924817235205648384 2017-10-29 01:56:25 UTC <thnorfar> @coach57 @MrsHime @vperezy Thank you for wanting me. I am such a city girl. I dont know if I would make it out there #OklaEd

924816735831838720 2017-10-29 01:54:26 UTC <thnorfar> So Q8 was where you were headed w/this. Considering #okleg didnt read the common core. Dont think they will read scores either #OklaEd
924816330485846016 2017-10-29 01:52:50 UTC <thnorfar> @angmlittle Nope, I didnt learn anything new. #OklaEd
924816173358870529 2017-10-29 01:52:12 UTC <thnorfar> A6. Dont care. Sup sent out a message to families but I dont think they care. They just care if I care about their child #oklaed
924813898691305473 2017-10-29 01:43:10 UTC <thnorfar> Dont kill me but just throwing this out there. What if we let everything go to hell instead of covering of legs? #oklaed
924813465763631109 2017-10-29 01:41:27 UTC <thnorfar> @shawnhime I write, I support my union, attend rallies when possible and support candidates that are pro-eduction. #oklaed
924813139140587520 2017-10-29 01:40:09 UTC <thnorfar> @James409Jason I was wondering but she got me with easy. Gets my chain every time. Thanks for the heads up.

924812377715019777 2017-10-29 01:37:07 UTC <thnorfar> @andredaughty @Curiosity_Films agreed! #oklaed
924812040694267905 2017-10-29 01:35:47 UTC <thnorfar> @James409Jason @ConsultJodi I see you are a consultant for principals. How long were you a teacher before becoming a principal? #OklaEd

924811099085479937 2017-10-29 01:32:02 UTC <thnorfar> @shawnhime @chong2087 We do have other issues that need fixing as well but money is a big one. Ive seen the impact in other states. #OklaEd
924810712765124608 2017-10-29 01:30:30 UTC <thnorfar> More T lay offs and cut to activities. #OklaEdhttps://twitter.com/shawnhime/status/924809580315643904
924810360904998912 2017-10-29 01:29:06 UTC <thnorfar> Does anyone have a link to the exact voting record for this past week? #oklaed
924810071925776384 2017-10-29 01:27:57 UTC <thnorfar> @djthoreson Yeah, that is so true too. #oklaed
924810007471943681 2017-10-29 01:27:42 UTC <thnorfar> @James409Jason @ConsultJodi Glad the #s helped you to stay in our state! #oklaed
924809657452986373 2017-10-29 01:26:19 UTC <thnorfar> @grendelrick I am w/u that this maybe their best. I dont understand why we keep wanting to tax the working while wealthy pay less & less. #oklaed
924809002306949121 2017-10-29 01:23:42 UTC <thnorfar> @James409Jason @ConsultJodi Ahh. I get PD money too. I am not counting that. Similar to you if I count it. #oklaed
924808554875375627 2017-10-29 01:21:56 UTC <thnorfar> @djthoreson Dont hate you for that at all. So many of our Ss receive those services too. #oklaed
924808069820944384 2017-10-29 01:20:00 UTC <thnorfar> @James409Jason @ConsultJodi Where are u working? I need to come to your school #oklaed
924807780367847424 2017-10-29 01:18:51 UTC <thnorfar> @ClaudiaSwisher Part of the challenge is so many of us who is holding up edu are some times too busy to fight as well. #oklaed
924807306931507206 2017-10-29 01:16:58 UTC <thnorfar> @angmlittle I have an idea. Lets make them all stars! Maybe that is what they need to get things done. #oklaed
924807100609519616 2017-10-29 01:16:09 UTC <thnorfar> @kriscoop80 @KathySDunn Thank you for this. This made me feel better. #OklaEd
924806902843928576 2017-10-29 01:15:22 UTC <thnorfar> I get that some things should be cut. That is normal in any situation. However, we have cut enough. Now it is time to raise revenue. #OklaEdhttps://twitter.com/shawnhime/status/924806060287971329
924806643031969792 2017-10-29 01:14:20 UTC <thnorfar> @grendelrick I really think they believe that people are being wasteful despite the fact they keep getting raises #oklaed
924805222920310789 2017-10-29 01:08:41 UTC <thnorfar> I am so disgusted I could curse. I never like cursing. So tired of being screwed over #OklaEdhttps://twitter.com/shawnhime/status/924804295903662081
924804516679159809 2017-10-29 01:05:53 UTC <thnorfar> @chong2087 U are not just anything and an education candidate makes you an automatic superhero #oklaed
924804083139178496 2017-10-29 01:04:10 UTC <thnorfar> Well, that means we are 1st in all things that matter right :(. #OklaEdhttps://twitter.com/James409Jason/status/924803009472843776
924803846068670465 2017-10-29 01:03:13 UTC <thnorfar> @ClaudiaSwisher Thank u for being a loud mouth. Hate I missed the OEA rally on Saturday. Had to have my car serviced :(. #oklaed

924632221188845568 2017-10-29 13:41:15 UTC <thnorfar> @effortfuleduktr So true! Check out @ClassTechTips new book on Tasks before Apps. Its like she read my thoughts ;) #sunchat
924631927092645888 2017-10-29 13:40:04 UTC <thnorfar> @GregJWolcott #SEL is so important. I hate we dont focus on it more in schools. It seems like elementary is best at it but all levels need it. #sunchat

924628462828183553 2017-10-29 13:26:18 UTC <thnorfar> @cooper1503 Really! That is so cool. Do the majority of the Ts like the process? #sunchat
924627798391689217 2017-10-29 13:23:40 UTC <thnorfar> @brianrozinsky Love showing this video to Ss to model the process. https://vimeo.com/45140230 #sunchat

924625937773334528 2017-10-29 13:16:16 UTC <thnorfar> @cooper1503 I like the sound of data camp. Do u have details of how u do it? We work within our PLCs but I like the idea of an entire school #sunchat
924624744372109312 2017-10-29 13:11:32 UTC <thnorfar> Im glowing with how much I show love to my Ss. Started a hug movement. #sunchat

922093190966054912 2017-10-22 13:32:03 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch Maybe this one :) http://gph.is/2qOw5gk #sunchat
922092865265766400 2017-10-22 13:30:45 UTC <thnorfar> @mrclinefhs @5StarStudents We forget that things gotta be fun so that when it gets hard you still want to do it. #sunchat
922092187692695557 2017-10-22 13:28:03 UTC <thnorfar> @TrishKing6 @mrclinefhs I am trying to say Lets find out so that I include them in how to learn. Its hard though #sunchat
922091905143443456 2017-10-22 13:26:56 UTC <thnorfar> @5StarStudents @mrclinefhs I steal strategies from elementary all the time. I love their stations, workshops, movement,!!! The list goes on & on. #sunchat
922091527756828674 2017-10-22 13:25:26 UTC <thnorfar> @tiffanytruitt I think it is because we think telling is a Think Aloud LOL #sunchat
922091253361242112 2017-10-22 13:24:21 UTC <thnorfar> @MsJBarger Modeling is so important. Also saying I messed up a lot is good as well. #sunchat
922090984250503168 2017-10-22 13:23:16 UTC <thnorfar> Full disclosure (wide eyed and looking around for the school police): I dont teach all of the curriculum. SHHH! Dont tell anyone. #sunchathttps://twitter.com/Ms_A_Yeh/status/922089279752347648
922090534256234496 2017-10-22 13:21:29 UTC <thnorfar> This is such a great ?! Building a trusting relationship is so key. They need to know they can be vulnerable w/u and classmates. #sunchathttps://twitter.com/cooper1503/status/922089220847620096
922090080294068224 2017-10-22 13:19:41 UTC <thnorfar> I think it is a mix of Ts not knowing how to create this environment and wanting too much control #sunchathttps://twitter.com/mrclinefhs/status/922089091306606599
922089159514210305 2017-10-22 13:16:01 UTC <thnorfar> Forgot to introduce myself. Telannia Norfar. I am a math teacher in Oklahoma City. Wrapping up my fall break! #sunchat

922088462118981632 2017-10-22 13:13:15 UTC <thnorfar> I have discovered that a key to keep a curious environment is to not answer any of their questions :). #sunchat

914482466769047552 2017-10-01 13:29:44 UTC <thnorfar> Sometimes what you need is not even available in your area. You have to be a driver in your own learning #sunchathttps://twitter.com/tiffanytruitt/status/914480470599127041
914482070730264578 2017-10-01 13:28:10 UTC <thnorfar> @brianrozinsky Sometimes educators mindsets are shocking to me. You are in the learning business but some dont want to learn??? #sunchat

914481247740731392 2017-10-01 13:24:54 UTC <thnorfar> @david_coccoli @Ms_A_Yeh @mrclinefhs @carlameyrink I like good PD that is ongoing. For instance, PBL is not something you can master in a session. Why do you think it is not? #sunchat
914480899093336065 2017-10-01 13:23:31 UTC <thnorfar> @brianrozinsky We can be like our Ss and not even try to enjoy the learning. I always try to get something out of any PD no matter how horrible #sunchat
914480685808840704 2017-10-01 13:22:40 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch Follow me and then send me your email that is google and I will send it #sunchat
914480299261792256 2017-10-01 13:21:08 UTC <thnorfar> @Ms_A_Yeh Send me a google email through DM. #sunchat
914480158937112576 2017-10-01 13:20:34 UTC <thnorfar> @david_coccoli Mine doesnt. We just demanded we have PD we want & not just district wants. It is PD ran by Ts in our building that is optional #sunchat
914479712361119745 2017-10-01 13:18:48 UTC <thnorfar> @Ms_A_Yeh It is broken by yrs of exp but it ranges from lesson planning (1st year) to differentiated instruction. Want to see the survey? #sunchat
914479003351834624 2017-10-01 13:15:59 UTC <thnorfar> @MrSiverioPES @tiffanytruitt That is so common. I live in OK. Everyone teaches in another state here because we pay so little! #sunchat
914478770492493824 2017-10-01 13:15:03 UTC <thnorfar> It is a little weird this year but my school does a survey to see what people want and then design it for the year around it. #sunchathttps://twitter.com/Ms_A_Yeh/status/914476918648348672
914478313925746688 2017-10-01 13:13:14 UTC <thnorfar> Although I'm a trainer, the best PD I have seen is conducted by http://bie.org. I also loved STEM Academy by @DiscoveryEd #sunchathttps://twitter.com/tiffanytruitt/status/914476753413984256
914477905530556416 2017-10-01 13:11:37 UTC <thnorfar> @RACzyz This is the only profession I have encountered where it is expected to come from someone else. It has always been weird to me #sunchat
914477624692498432 2017-10-01 13:10:30 UTC <thnorfar> @susankotch That was so good. Sometimes they have been good but so many times it is not :(. #sunchat
914477355040731136 2017-10-01 13:09:26 UTC <thnorfar> @david_coccoli PREACH!!! I dont know why we think educators can get something after one time. #sunchat
914477187406991365 2017-10-01 13:08:46 UTC <thnorfar> @tiffanytruitt YEAH!!! You will fall in love with chats. #sunchat
914476939301277696 2017-10-01 13:07:47 UTC <thnorfar> @DennisDill That is dedication!! #sunchat
914476551814696960 2017-10-01 13:06:14 UTC <thnorfar> @mrclinefhs For me it is the level of interaction. Even lecture format type of PD can have interaction #sunchat
914475678430580736 2017-10-01 13:02:46 UTC <thnorfar> I am a math T in an OKC high school.  #sunchat

910625205474623488 2017-09-20 22:02:22 UTC <thnorfar> @Curiosity_Films @andredaughty @iDoSchool @LadyFTerrance Gotta chew on this one. Stay tuned.

909412781559910401 2017-09-17 13:44:37 UTC <thnorfar> @mrclinefhs @tiffanytruitt @susankotch Ever discuss the following: Competency based edu, engage and coach Ss, managing activities, PBL, standards based grading, reflection?
909411670136459264 2017-09-17 13:40:12 UTC <thnorfar> Im off to get ready for church as well. So enjoyed #sunchat. Will see you guys next week. Same time and place :)
909410924380876800 2017-09-17 13:37:15 UTC <thnorfar> @tiffanytruitt Lots of whiteboards to brainstorm #sunchat

909410050518773760 2017-09-17 13:33:46 UTC <thnorfar> @AlliJenkins1 I think it starts w/a convo w/Ss. Try one idea and see how they respond. #sunchat
909409118959558661 2017-09-17 13:30:04 UTC <thnorfar> @Ms_A_Yeh @carlameyrink Its amazing how resourceful a T has to be. Never had to do this when I worked in corporate world. #sunchat
909408798304956416 2017-09-17 13:28:48 UTC <thnorfar> @focus2achieve @mrclinefhs So true!!! #sunchat
909408367260471297 2017-09-17 13:27:05 UTC <thnorfar> @Ms_A_Yeh I have a colleague who committed on my group seating. He said he was scared to do that. Now he has Ss in groups. #sunchat
909406506205847552 2017-09-17 13:19:41 UTC <thnorfar> @tiffanytruitt Great idea! #sunchat
909406305390960640 2017-09-17 13:18:53 UTC <thnorfar> You have to spend time teaching students about the space and how to choose appropriately. #sunchathttps://twitter.com/Ms_A_Yeh/status/909405423953838080
909405635615252480 2017-09-17 13:16:14 UTC <thnorfar> Where is your teacher? I am usually among the Ss somewhere in the room. #sunchathttps://twitter.com/DennisDill/status/909405457546084353
909404911141494785 2017-09-17 13:13:21 UTC <thnorfar> I think it is the Ss setting up the space. Got rid of my desk & asked Ss to design the layout within the 1st 3 weeks of school #sunchathttps://twitter.com/mrclinefhs/status/909404314187255808
909404415651569664 2017-09-17 13:11:23 UTC <thnorfar> This is a huge need in edu. I constantly remind myself that it is not about me but my students. I think that is the first step. #sunchathttps://twitter.com/tiffanytruitt/status/909403774279614465
909404093633794048 2017-09-17 13:10:06 UTC <thnorfar> @laixuejia So glad you are joining the profession!!! Best career I ever had. #sunchat

903795477421989889 2017-09-01 01:43:28 UTC <thnorfar> @KimberBlodgett I am getting better about it but it still comes out if the stakes are medium :).

901981309542834178 2017-08-27 01:34:36 UTC <thnorfar> I keep it in the back of my mind but I wait to make my own opinion. Sometimes info is true #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/DelCityStuCo/status/901980931682164736
901980439010738180 2017-08-27 01:31:09 UTC <thnorfar> We have a great atmosphere but I will ask my Ss. They seem to dismiss it. We are getting more kids wanting to be at NWC! #OklaEdhttps://twitter.com/DelCityStuCo/status/901978167119933441
901979124192993281 2017-08-27 01:25:55 UTC <thnorfar> @kriscoop80 Well, I believe I will :). As a former journalist, I think we need to add a class on reading the news. #oklaed
901978700467535873 2017-08-27 01:24:14 UTC <thnorfar> That is amazing and something adults need to understand #OklaEdhttps://twitter.com/DelCity2018/status/901978070843830272
901978407369629696 2017-08-27 01:23:04 UTC <thnorfar> @sarahmomof3boys Welcome!!! Thanks for changing to math :) #OklaEd
901977950123372544 2017-08-27 01:21:15 UTC <thnorfar> @jcbjr One news story will turn a situation. People dont realize news reports what doesnt normally happen not what is normal. #OklaEd
901977703414366209 2017-08-27 01:20:17 UTC <thnorfar> Not even close. NWC has the best high school on the planet since it opened. Diversity has only made us better. #OklaEdhttps://twitter.com/DelCityStuCo/status/901976896140967937
901977314250149888 2017-08-27 01:18:44 UTC <thnorfar> @mcappsparks Wow, that will really hurt the Ss in the end. Affluent Ss dont have the same resources as middle and poor #oklaed

901975814702551040 2017-08-27 01:12:46 UTC <thnorfar> My school was thought to be dangerous and full of drugs because of rumors #OklaEdhttps://twitter.com/DelCityStuCo/status/901975390335504385
901975325449609217 2017-08-27 01:10:50 UTC <thnorfar> So glad to have students on the chat and leading it tonight. You go @DelCityStuCo and @kriscoop80 #OklaEd
901974322050424837 2017-08-27 01:06:50 UTC <thnorfar> A2: It is a label that may be partially true but mainly a rigid view of someone or some place #OklaEd
901973176158228481 2017-08-27 01:02:17 UTC <thnorfar> A1: Telannia Norfar, Math T @ NWC in @OKCPS. My stereotype in high school was in crowd and Smart #oklaed
901951108498718724 2017-08-27 23:34:36 UTC <thnorfar> @LopezOnSports In his defense, he has tweeted about Houston & is coming. He doesn't have the attention span or sensitivity to not tweet about other things.
901948283257593856 2017-08-27 23:23:22 UTC <thnorfar> @Digucator Back in your neighborhood this week. Can't wait to see what you tweet this school year!!

866473766834122752 2017-05-21 02:00:18 UTC <thnorfar> @KatieKinder1 Cool! How has it changed ur classroom? How long have you been doing it? Next year will be my first.
866473452261265409 2017-05-21 01:59:03 UTC <thnorfar> @andredaughty @DA_Houston @collums_dawn I am a blunt person but I often somehow say it in a way that pole dont find it hurtful. That is what they tell me #oklaed
866473070755815424 2017-05-21 01:57:33 UTC <thnorfar> Ahh Man! I have to drop off. I have limited data until Wednesday. So wish I could do the #afteroklaed. Can we talk again next month? #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/andredaughty/status/866472448287539201
866472517388689408 2017-05-21 01:55:21 UTC <thnorfar> Forgot to add the #oklaed Suggest everyone check out implementing Serial Testimony in ur classroom.https://twitter.com/thnorfar/status/866472364896395265
866472364896395265 2017-05-21 01:54:44 UTC <thnorfar> @KatieKinder1 I am going to do serial testimony next year. http://www.tolerance.org/meaningful-discussions
866471115207606276 2017-05-21 01:49:46 UTC <thnorfar> @sjkibel That was a beautiful march. I hate I already had an engagement and couldnt go.#oklaed
866470884118233088 2017-05-21 01:48:51 UTC <thnorfar> @BlueCerealEduc I tell them they can at the beginning of the year. I also try to do something and publicly apologize so they know I will take critique.
866470132847128577 2017-05-21 01:45:52 UTC <thnorfar> @sjkibel I like that! Can I steal it? #oklaed Promise to give credit 3 times LOL #oklaed
866469816953122817 2017-05-21 01:44:37 UTC <thnorfar> A7 I think u have to be intentional w/getting to know other races. I attended the Laos New Years yesterday. Learned so much #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/andredaughty/status/866468686906961920
866469510332788738 2017-05-21 01:43:24 UTC <thnorfar> A6 A big thing to do as a T is to ask ur Ss to call u out so that u can improve. My Ss say I am the only T they have that does #oklaed
866469128080588804 2017-05-21 01:41:53 UTC <thnorfar> @vperezy So true. It is why I am thinking relationship is a key factor in it being effective. Dont think it would work w/o it. #oklaed
866468875076075520 2017-05-21 01:40:52 UTC <thnorfar> @JennWillTeach Yeah, especially ones bigger than me :).
866468776430247937 2017-05-21 01:40:29 UTC <thnorfar> @BlueCerealEduc I would so love to see that on film. #oklaed
866468008046338048 2017-05-21 01:37:25 UTC <thnorfar> @andredaughty @DA_Houston So true but I wonder how important does having a relationship w/the person is necessary. What do you think? #oklaed
866467689270837248 2017-05-21 01:36:09 UTC <thnorfar> A6 If u know the person, u gotta call them out in a way that helps them understand the problem. Speak the truth in love. #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/andredaughty/status/866467421359624193
866467104559595520 2017-05-21 01:33:50 UTC <thnorfar> A5. I wish this one was just nonverbal. I know a lot of Ts who say things as well as have the body language. #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/andredaughty/status/866464902562672642
866466865475981316 2017-05-21 01:32:53 UTC <thnorfar> @mrsmcreading I believe it is an hourly check and apologizing when you know you did it. Asking Ss to tell u when u do. #oklaed
866465892711976961 2017-05-21 01:29:01 UTC <thnorfar> @BlueCerealEduc Definitely have to converse with the officer. Seeds and water do eventually produce a harvest. #oklaed
866465390423150592 2017-05-21 01:27:01 UTC <thnorfar> @tstyles77 But you can make him search only every 3rd SS instead. he does work for you. #oklaed
866464968547475456 2017-05-21 01:25:21 UTC <thnorfar> A4. Ok. LOL break. This is wrong but I have to admit something. When Im out of state, I do this w/everyone even white pple. #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/andredaughty/status/866463661275131904
866464106915737600 2017-05-21 01:21:55 UTC <thnorfar> Q4. I am still processing Q2. Slow down @andredaughty :)
866463853919571968 2017-05-21 01:20:55 UTC <thnorfar> @allen_lehman @BlueCerealEduc @vperezy I think when you are a POC, it is okay to drop the micro for everything. Pple dont take it seriously if you seem to make it small #oklaed
866463477896024065 2017-05-21 01:19:25 UTC <thnorfar> A2: I love this def. Racial epithets is the most common and this is the perfect example. Ss do it a lot and we gotta stop them. #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/andredaughty/status/866461131036123136
866462644298973185 2017-05-21 01:16:07 UTC <thnorfar> @allen_lehman That is so true but the assault is a strong word. Names are an identity and when attacked has the same affect as physical. #oklaed
866462051694239744 2017-05-21 01:13:45 UTC <thnorfar> @allen_lehman @BlueCerealEduc Power is a great point. But I think it can happen without formal power as well. It happens within POC groups. #oklaed
866461176275898368 2017-05-21 01:10:17 UTC <thnorfar> That is a great point. As a POC, I often pick not to fight microagression unless it is a person I know well. #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/BlueCerealEduc/status/866460595167662080
866460695184977920 2017-05-21 01:08:22 UTC <thnorfar> @andredaughty @amybbednarz I will!! Hopefully, it will not be cold in late June. #oklaed
866460441010196486 2017-05-21 01:07:21 UTC <thnorfar> A1: It is sometimes a subtle action. Sometimes people dont even know they are doing it. When they do, it is more dangerous. #oklaed
866460108137648129 2017-05-21 01:06:02 UTC <thnorfar> That is what I was saying! Whoa! Okay, brain turn on #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/BlueCerealEduc/status/866459971818541057

833502793466003457 2017-02-19 02:25:26 UTC <thnorfar> True. Some strategies still work for the future. The key is that we do what is working not because it is what is comfortable for us #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/BlueCerealEduc/status/833501670470459392
833501872405245952 2017-02-19 02:21:46 UTC <thnorfar> @awages1 Unfortunately, too many people do because it is easier #oklaed

825900585966829568 2017-01-29 02:56:58 UTC <thnorfar> @shetherington13 That would be great but I fear that title money will all be about increasing vouchers or private ed #oklaed

825894979314778114 2017-01-29 02:34:42 UTC <thnorfar> P1 I get the no test thing but I somewhat disagree. What should be learned should be for all Ss. Testing somewhat helps that #oklaed
825894209500618753 2017-01-29 02:31:38 UTC <thnorfar> PREACH. Also change your mind if the majority of your constituents say so! Voting your party is not the main goal #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/BlueCerealEduc/status/825893592036159488

825889782182055936 2017-01-29 02:14:03 UTC <thnorfar> Mentoring is such a needed support. There is a mandate now but it is pitiful. #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/franklinMPH/status/825889056747900930

770084116809256960 2016-08-28 02:22:15 UTC <thnorfar> Yet, that is not what we have Ss do in HS most of the time :(https://twitter.com/sgprilliman/status/770078835186470912
770078034342846464 2016-08-28 01:58:05 UTC <thnorfar> A11: It has some paid parts but I love http://literacyta.com #oklaed
770076474879664128 2016-08-28 01:51:53 UTC <thnorfar> @sig225 Thanks for the context. However, they were still wrong for displaying your errors.
770076176673046529 2016-08-28 01:50:42 UTC <thnorfar> @sig225 Please tell me you are kidding. That is so unprofessional.
770075484306739200 2016-08-28 01:47:57 UTC <thnorfar> I am so enjoying the reading. I cant remember to write a response ;-) #oklaed
770075203649019904 2016-08-28 01:46:50 UTC <thnorfar> @sig225 That made me smile. Thanks for that. I needed it after grading some papers.
770074884403757058 2016-08-28 01:45:34 UTC <thnorfar> @sig225 that is shocking. And sad. Math/sci needs to know how to communicate too.
770074121564749825 2016-08-28 01:42:32 UTC <thnorfar> @sig225 I was meaning the general experience. True about math classes. Rarely writing but is hugely required in most fields.
770072761301667842 2016-08-28 01:37:08 UTC <thnorfar> @sig225 You were able to get a degree without taking english, science and social studies? they are full of papers.
770071963071025152 2016-08-28 01:33:57 UTC <thnorfar> @watersenglish @mrsmcreading Oh, yes. Some bite really hard. Others bark and bite. #oklaed
770071742182227968 2016-08-28 01:33:05 UTC <thnorfar> @BlueCerealEduc LOL!! LOL!! I havent been on in a while. Trying to be good ;).
770071637718884355 2016-08-28 01:32:40 UTC <thnorfar> A6: I dont think peer review cant take up too much time. It is another opportunity to deepen learning. Timers fix any time issue. #oklaed
770070605240602624 2016-08-28 01:28:34 UTC <thnorfar> Sorry, i just hate it when we act like we cant be competent about the basics. Wont get on a tangent again #oklaed
770070406413836290 2016-08-28 01:27:46 UTC <thnorfar> Okay, didnt every teacher get a degree. Doesnt that mean we all had to write papers so should know enough about grammar #oklaed
770070117904441344 2016-08-28 01:26:37 UTC <thnorfar> A5: I often tell kids I a not grading the grammar but I will make notes about it. #oklaed
770068785978114048 2016-08-28 01:21:20 UTC <thnorfar> A4: Key to synthesizing learning. Loved learning how to sketch note as a way of writing at #iplzaOU by @vperezy #oklaed
770067768569917440 2016-08-28 01:17:17 UTC <thnorfar> A3: There are so many. I love reflection prompts the best. Fits any subject area and great wrap up to a lesson #oklaed
770066253440483329 2016-08-28 01:11:16 UTC <thnorfar> A2: Reading and writing is used in all professions. It is important to see it from the lens of those professions #oklaed
770065954030120961 2016-08-28 01:10:05 UTC <thnorfar> @PrincipalNyberg Id be happy to send you some examples from my classroom. I teach Algebra through Pre-Cal. #oklaed
770065758323867650 2016-08-28 01:09:18 UTC <thnorfar> @MrPogue So true. It is amazing they dont realize how much they will communicate #oklaed
770065550320013317 2016-08-28 01:08:28 UTC <thnorfar> I can help you with that :). What writing happens now? #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/PrincipalNyberg/status/770065336683094016
770065060660117504 2016-08-28 01:06:32 UTC <thnorfar> A1: To me it is authentic writing each subject areas context #oklaed
770064889381548032 2016-08-28 01:05:51 UTC <thnorfar> It feels like that sometimes ;) #oklaedhttps://twitter.com/BlueCerealEduc/status/770064504591945734
770064723446489088 2016-08-28 01:05:11 UTC <thnorfar> It has either been a long time for me or we have a lot of new people tonight :) #oklaed

719331279179624449 2016-04-10 01:08:36 UTC <thnorfar> @kennethdward HM is practice for those who need it. I work on my student discovering if they need it & they assign to themselves. #oklaed
719330601896005632 2016-04-10 01:05:54 UTC <thnorfar> A1: Generally, no but I dont assign homework. Assigned twice this year. I have Ss determine if they need more practice #oklaed
