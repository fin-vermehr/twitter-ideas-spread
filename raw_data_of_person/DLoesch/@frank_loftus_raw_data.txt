971217172625285120 2018-03-06 02:53:12 UTC <frank_loftus> @RepRatcliffe @Cernovich @FoxNews But the special prosecutor must be from outside the swamp otherwise we'll be in worse trouble

959522838955905025 2018-02-02 20:24:06 UTC <frank_loftus> Thank you president Trump for releasing the memo.@POTUS
959401344141615104 2018-02-02 12:21:19 UTC <frank_loftus> What president would threaten to beat up a reporter because he said something bad about his daughter? I will give you a clue. President TRUM_ complete the spelling for the answer@LionelMedia

956144772351225856 2018-01-24 12:40:52 UTC <frank_loftus> I believe Sessions is compromised by the Deep State. I don't know how but I think his actions show that he certainly is@LouDobbs
955176534637150208 2018-01-21 20:33:26 UTC <frank_loftus> @ericbolling I don't think it's a law for 60 votes. Just a senate rule that could be changed if Mitch had balls
952921724663877632 2018-01-15 15:13:38 UTC <frank_loftus> @LionelMedia Personally, I think McCain maybe faking the cancer to stay away from involvement with the dossier

914475459525713920 2017-10-01 13:01:54 UTC <frank_loftus> @realDonaldTrump They should stand but not with locked arms. In my opinion that's just another sign of disrespect

906197527963283456 2017-09-08 16:48:21 UTC <frank_loftus> @LionelMedia I think he just needs a mustache and get rid of the glasses. Then he would look pretty familiar

835474041469284352 2017-02-25 12:58:28 UTC <frank_loftus> @realDonaldTrump my idea is have multiple rallies all around the country at the same time and you attend one and simulcast to the others
832441340071931904 2017-02-16 04:07:36 UTC <frank_loftus> @seanhannity best presidential press conference and probably longest that I've ever seen
