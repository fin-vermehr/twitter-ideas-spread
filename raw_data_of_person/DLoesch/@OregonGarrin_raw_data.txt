970893025336438790 2018-03-05 05:25:10 UTC <OregonGarrin> @WilliamBibbiani @darinbunch Was there this weekend didnt see any micro bears but it was snowing maybe they were hibernating
970825481015775232 2018-03-05 00:56:46 UTC <OregonGarrin> @z_blair Im 51 years old I played golf at the Junior College level I hit the ball farther now then I ever did.  I rarely hit 5 irons any more into par 4s I used to fairly regularly when I was a single digit handicap.
970717143288356864 2018-03-05 17:46:16 UTC <OregonGarrin> @PacificGales I dont need much and hate to be repetitive but look at what BD does. Im sure you want to be different but I see no need for nor do I have the resources for a pebble beach and the lodge type experience.
970510837667414017 2018-03-04 04:06:29 UTC <OregonGarrin> @BarrettSallee Probably costs $25 bucks too.

969363806181715969 2018-03-01 00:08:35 UTC <OregonGarrin> @PacificGales @GetawaysGolf Actually the length at @SeascapeGolf would be perfect for your hickories and @DeLaveagaGolf in Santa Cruz you cant go wrong.
969314866426097664 2018-03-01 20:54:07 UTC <OregonGarrin> @PacificGales BD off season is great and great value + I can stay overnight eat and drink on site play 3 Rounds for about $600.
969314104669122560 2018-03-01 20:51:06 UTC <OregonGarrin> @PacificGales Like I said Id pay it once to say I did. I bit the bullet this summer and Paid $175 walking for Pasatiempo great but if I want to play more than once on vaca  I can play Bayonet /Blackhorse with cart for $100  maybe not great but pretty damn good or Aptos for $75 pretty fun

968962993001152512 2018-02-28 21:35:54 UTC <OregonGarrin> @PacificGales Depends on how many times you want me to play it.  Ill pay up to 200 once to say I did.  If you set up a winter rates program like BD Id be much more likely to keep coming back.  I leave BD to the high rollers April-oct. I realize you gotta charge what the market will bear

968602890662113281 2018-02-27 21:44:59 UTC <OregonGarrin> @johncanzanobft w/respect to FL ending that raffle could be a logistic/legal nightmare to try to give all the $ back.  My guess is they do this one and dont do it again.  My 2cents
968574983881482240 2018-02-27 19:54:06 UTC <OregonGarrin> @gabrielmalor @politicalmath @GroffAndrew Most AR owners just use em for target practice or shooting competitions.
968574472784527360 2018-02-27 19:52:04 UTC <OregonGarrin> @gabrielmalor @politicalmath @GroffAndrew Yeah the AR shoots a pretty small caliber bullet its even banned for hunting in most states because it cant be counted on to reliably and humanely kill an animal like a deer with one shot However you get hit 5-6 times with any bullet probably going to bleed out regardless
968543813860958208 2018-02-27 17:50:14 UTC <OregonGarrin> @gabrielmalor @politicalmath @GroffAndrew It is heavier  (twice as heavy) 115-135 grain vs 55-62 grain.  Typically the 9mm is a hollow point as well whereas most 5.56 are full metal jacket.  Its accuracy and capacity that make it so deadly
968402104619474945 2018-02-27 08:27:08 UTC <OregonGarrin> @gabrielmalor @politicalmath Its the accuracy of the rifle that is the advantage not the feet per minute.  The 9mm round is actually bigger as well as most likely a hollow point.

965417077501706240 2018-02-18 02:45:42 UTC <OregonGarrin> @GoDucksnet @JohnKasich @DirigoLaw I know plenty jackass I own an AR they be modified so you can load it by breaking it down such as CA. Obviously semi auto pistols have to have detachable mags  (I own about 7 of those) but certainly can have a limited capacity. Grandfather existing stuff in and Im fine with it.
965327586237673472 2018-02-18 20:50:06 UTC <OregonGarrin> @GoDucksnet @JohnKasich What about magazine capacity limits to 8-10 and non detachable magazines.  Would drastically reduce the ability to kill lots of people quickly gun owners can still have their ARs they wont be happy and I assume neither will you but would reduce the killing capacity immensely
965308743595343872 2018-02-18 19:35:13 UTC <OregonGarrin> @Thom_Hartmann Fuck that my shotguns for bird hunting are semi automatic.  As a gun owner Id entertain magazine capacity limits and banning detachable magazines in rifles it would accomplish nearly as much and wont infringe as much on gun owner rights.  Oh & enforce laws already in place

Realistic to ban high capacity magazines perhaps AR style rifles but handguns are far and away the weapons used in most killings.
964337369557098497 2018-02-15 03:15:20 UTC <OregonGarrin> @Robert26Smith Pretty straight forward article if you read the whole thing but does require you to set aside your preconceived opinions.  For those with short attn spans say you ban assault type rifles mass shooting deaths may go down but mass shootings and ARs small% of gun deaths nationwide

She should fire her agent for not getting a better deal You basically compared wahlberg to Weinstien when you said Hollywood Men. Painting with a very broad brush

953179809839919104 2018-01-16 08:19:10 UTC <OregonGarrin> @annadrezen @Sudi_Green @johannagriese Yes and what I said stands its the producers job to step up wahlberg  should have kept the $ she should have fired her agent. Equal rights is also the freedom to to negotiate equally.  She could have insisted on 1.5 she didnt, now Marks  the asshole?  #NotBuyingIt

937559540941258752 2017-12-03 05:49:48 UTC <OregonGarrin> @HouseOfSparky @asu96 @brewcrew327 Well guess we'll wait and see it I predict he and AD gone after three seasons and ASU finishes no higher than 3rd in the south in any of his years
937558858284744705 2017-12-03 05:47:05 UTC <OregonGarrin> @Mike_Yam Seems like a great guy but 56-78 coaching record??? 8 years removed from coaching and Kevin Sumlin is sitting out there?   Cronyism much??
937556646758199296 2017-12-03 05:38:18 UTC <OregonGarrin> @Chris_Fetters @ChrisVannini So he's a figurehead like the Queen?
937555724871262208 2017-12-03 05:34:38 UTC <OregonGarrin> @HouseOfSparky @asu96 @brewcrew327 56-78 record as a head coach
937555551403122688 2017-12-03 05:33:57 UTC <OregonGarrin> @HouseOfSparky Seems like he'll be able to recruit but step back from CTG.  He and the AD will be gone inside 4 years

937534337670553600 2017-12-03 04:09:39 UTC <OregonGarrin> @johncanzanobft Does that mean the Nyborgs won't be able to buy the property from Shelly?  He really needs that sale
937533181674139648 2017-12-03 04:05:03 UTC <OregonGarrin> @miakhalifa @AaronJFentress Joel Embid said she'd "had miles of D" all Aaron did was quote her tweet to Taggart.
937532592047267840 2017-12-03 04:02:43 UTC <OregonGarrin> @criticalbruin Kinda surprised Wittingham hasn't been mentioned in any of these coach situations I bet he'd kill at Tennessee

937444419350945792 2017-12-03 22:12:21 UTC <OregonGarrin> @Joey_Galloway @KrampusOfficial @CoachNBurton Best thing about W losing was that Bama or  Ohio was going to be left out.  I am flat out reveling in O State fans meltdown.  Galloway is such an anti Pac 12 homer his snit is even more fun.  Hopefully happens to Bama  next  year

935617790240628737 2017-11-28 21:13:58 UTC <OregonGarrin> @johncanzanobft Taggart got a rougher go being in the north but think he gets it done in 2018 or 19.   Probably have to beat chip to get there
935608472648986625 2017-11-28 20:36:57 UTC <OregonGarrin> @criticalbruin Well he's talking retirement already so he may be homeless sooner than he thinks.

934590078101307392 2017-11-25 01:10:13 UTC <OregonGarrin> @GoDucksnet @DuckFootball why isn't Essig acknowledging the record by Royce?

927026550398115841 2017-11-04 04:15:27 UTC <OregonGarrin> @AaronJFentress Yes! Apparently Royce's reward for coming back is to be killed by Taggart and unimaginative play calling killing the D too.   He's the worst 4 th dwn play caller in the Pac.  And generally I support the guy

924462929222582273 2017-10-28 02:28:32 UTC <OregonGarrin> @BralonAddison2 Yeah I was surprised Dude made some plays for the Ducks. Was kinda hoping they'd treat him better he didn't ask to leave
924324737706106881 2017-10-28 17:19:25 UTC <OregonGarrin> @ThornsFC @RonWyden @SenJeffMerkley Why do we send you people there? to waste the people's time &$ on this silliness? Widens a New Yorker anyway what did he know about soccer in Oregon?

923783032485453825 2017-10-26 05:26:52 UTC <OregonGarrin> @billyfi57 @RuleofTree 3/4 times and every time against Oregon.  I'd do it too with that receiver on 5'9" DBs
923782683905236992 2017-10-26 05:25:29 UTC <OregonGarrin> @RuleofTree Your QBs are terrible without a good QB and RB Shaw outthinks himself and gets too conservative IMO.  Get another Hogan in there and he'll look like a genius
923780619594711040 2017-10-26 05:17:17 UTC <OregonGarrin> @BeaverFootball @Mike_Yam Like the energy he brings hope he can stay as an assistant but I've seen this before works short term hard to maintain
923765387119824896 2017-10-26 04:16:45 UTC <OregonGarrin> @Chris_Fetters Worked 3/4 and about 4/4 against Oregon.  Knew it was coming too
923765098035929088 2017-10-26 04:15:36 UTC <OregonGarrin> Knew that play was coming.  Seen it too many times.   #fearthetree #gobeavs
923764414305656832 2017-10-26 04:12:53 UTC <OregonGarrin> @Schlieffen You guys just stole the Beavs soul there.  Knew that play was coming seen it a bunch a times.
923763609485770752 2017-10-26 04:09:41 UTC <OregonGarrin> @Schlieffen Great place to watch a game good bars eucalyptus grove for tailgating and pizza my heart.  3rd QB and 8pm start reason didn't go this year
923674573077331968 2017-10-26 22:15:53 UTC <OregonGarrin> @Schlieffen I think it's weak that a winning program such as that can't draw in the Bay Area Too busy yachting I suppose + I like to talk shit
923653548902031360 2017-10-26 20:52:21 UTC <OregonGarrin> @Brett_McMurphy @Schlieffen Not saying they aren't good but it never sells out and the last three times I went there was almost as much green and gold as red.

922195394964086784 2017-10-22 20:18:10 UTC <OregonGarrin> @AndrewGreif Burmeister improving but gotta let him throw more.  I'm on board with WT but his 4 down play calling is  and he's going to kill Royce freeman.  Where was Taj Griffin to mix things up?

897217462994739201 2017-08-14 22:04:47 UTC <OregonGarrin> I think the word you are looking for is asshole  but I don't know  so I can't make that determination. 
897211187049275393 2017-08-14 21:39:51 UTC <OregonGarrin> @SymoneDSanders There it is the race card.  Much easier to believe that than face up to the fact that you might just be rude.
897193454010212352 2017-08-14 20:29:23 UTC <OregonGarrin> @realDonaldTrump @SenJeffMerkley I voted for @GovGaryJohnson but pretty sure this would be your statement regardless.  I hope Dems get smacked in 2018 so transparent.
897129580653289472 2017-08-14 16:15:34 UTC <OregonGarrin> @SymoneDSanders Apparently it was all your time.  He shouldn't have said it but you are rude

896927471479554048 2017-08-13 02:52:27 UTC <OregonGarrin> @ImTheSportsDude I'd bet Fowler  is the last of this group to win a major if he wins one at all.  I think g against him just a feeling

875832577050894336 2017-06-16 21:48:53 UTC <OregonGarrin> @CoachNBurton @AaronJFentress she knows Spielberg's intentions? doubt they are nefarious probably more finanacial. Hard to argue that he hasn't chosen projects well

800400099679404032 2016-11-20 18:07:09 UTC <OregonGarrin> @NRA  need NRA supporting senators out talking up NRA effect on election. Not acknowledging NRA effect means their argument won't change
800399601152860160 2016-11-20 18:05:10 UTC <OregonGarrin> @NRA need to be taking more credit for election. #charlesSchumer & Dems on TV blaming loss on everything but NRA. Purposely ignoring facts.

779194098200698880 2016-09-22 05:42:04 UTC <OregonGarrin> @sportsjunkie94 I'd love to see the cats win for selfish reasons but I think AZ is down this year
779193014904168448 2016-09-22 05:37:46 UTC <OregonGarrin> @sportsjunkie94 weird things happen at the zona zoo at night but unless they are total frauds I think the Huskies take care of business
779189436290437120 2016-09-22 05:23:32 UTC <OregonGarrin> @sportsjunkie94 I'll believe it when I see it.  No elite RB or WR's Rosen the Chosen can't do it by himself

778004639639674881 2016-09-19 22:55:35 UTC <OregonGarrin> @SportsTalk953. More concerned with penalties and getting gashed by another big 10 QB running. out  expl of 2pts by N Burton on pac12 netw
777994814897827841 2016-09-19 22:16:32 UTC <OregonGarrin> @JimMWeber maybe it will be a more wholesome environment in Vegas!
777994667711266818 2016-09-19 22:15:57 UTC <OregonGarrin> @JimMWeber appears he got what he am deserved but as a raider fan I'm not taking my kids there

777401448443236352 2016-09-17 06:58:43 UTC <OregonGarrin> @CoachNBurton enjoyed your red white and blue expl of Oregon 2 point tries. Imo it was the penalties not the conv tries that doomed Oregon
777399600017584128 2016-09-17 06:51:22 UTC <OregonGarrin> @insidetroy Oregon fans are laughing
