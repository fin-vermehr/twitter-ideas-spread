970707203777880069 2018-03-05 17:06:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DLoesch The sheriff of nothing-ham is all about his delusions. He won't resign as he obviously lacks honor so let's hope the gov kicks him out when the investigation shows the complete extent of this moron's incompetence.

970343545147219969 2018-03-04 17:01:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RajeevSrinivasa BTW I'm grateful that the barbaric practices of natives in Latin America were quashed.
970343094406275073 2018-03-04 16:59:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Kuvalayamala @alokdb2011 Through human history there's been this group of people call them sandit, priests, whatever, who've made a living out of lying to the people by putting themselves as the ones who understand, know, and can tell us the truth. God is not a religion.
970341384006832128 2018-03-04 16:53:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Kuvalayamala @alokdb2011 I don't pretend to. I don't need to. The practices speak of the fanatical backwardness involved.
970337559833432069 2018-03-04 16:37:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Kuvalayamala @alokdb2011 I criticize religious backwardness whether in the case of these boys or those who self-immolate in Philippines. Both r equally dumb. Excuse my sincere bluntness.
970337225811558402 2018-03-04 16:36:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Kuvalayamala @alokdb2011 A true Christian understand that there is no conflict between God and science as Good is limitless while science is but our best limited effort to understand the universe.
970336928884289536 2018-03-04 16:35:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Kuvalayamala @alokdb2011 I know history quite well thank you and yes, I know the dark history of the Catholic Church. Big diff is that I'm not Catholic and Catholicism is a twisted version of Christianity which true Christians have denounced and even died for such.

970314299624353792 2018-03-04 15:05:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Kuvalayamala @alokdb2011 BTW, or u refer to the Bible, it doesn't declare Earth is flat. Deflecting doesn't cover up the shameful practice of hurting boys in the name of any deity.

970215811888680960 2018-03-04 08:34:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Kuvalayamala I can attempt rationalizing all u want but if u r honest w yourself then you'll see the incoherence of the whole thing. We r in the 21st century so why stick to primitive notions and practices?
970215393875976192 2018-03-04 08:32:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Kuvalayamala @alokdb2011 Of u think this is my religion is better than yours then you are mistaken. It's about the incoherence of believing in any deity that requires barbaric practices. Hopefully the 21st century will reach all places and people stuck in primitive practices.
970214685671940096 2018-03-04 08:29:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Kuvalayamala @AtulMhatre13 It's not about comparing religions but merely echoing the disgust the modern world feel when we hear of such backwardness and ignorance no matter what the religion may be. Only madness can see any validity to such practices.

Criminals i.e. gangs, etc, don't source guns legally as they can still be traced. Now, 200k or so guns r stolen yearly and that is a big caveat to the whole argument.

969767385698840576 2018-03-02 02:52:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews Remember when Celine Dion had someone rushed the stage in Vegas? She handled it w class which is something this pampered pooch diva seems to have lost in old age.

969566895132291073 2018-03-02 13:35:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @cvpayne @GMCoon60 Absolutely. These r national security concerns. Illegal subsidies forced more than 50% reduction in US production. If we ramp production to 100% we'd still need imports so what's the hoopla?
969566239701061632 2018-03-02 13:32:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MillerCoors Disingenuous. It's not all about defense, how about electric grid? Do we want to depend of foreign sources for such critical industries? We allowed Illegal subsidies cripple our manufacturing well NO MORE!

969360142918660097 2018-03-01 23:54:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenSanders So hypocritical. How hard is it for u to understand that not all of us r ok w murdering babies?

I don't care what yep consenting adults do in private, I really don't, but this doesn't mean I must accept homosexuality as normal.

969245780778332161 2018-03-01 16:19:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LibbySchaaf Sorry ma'am but you have. You can't have it both ways by claiming you r not obliged to assist feds while interfering w their duty to enforce immigration laws.

969239361656061952 2018-03-01 15:54:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Disney @ItGetsBetter @crazyLouisMAMA Same rationale behind normalizing homosexuality applies to incest between two "loving" consenting adults. Like or not that's the simple truth.

969229777751232513 2018-03-01 15:16:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HillaryClinton So I guess your reset button was yet another failure of yours and Barry?
969188314057191426 2018-03-01 12:31:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @dbongino @Harbinger1022 He said if a person is suspected of being about to do harm w weapons to take them away Immediately and that makes sense.
969054445874171905 2018-02-28 03:39:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @bzwatching Understand this: he couldn't know the type of weapon the shooter was using and the deputies don't use revolvers. They use either Glock or sig Sauer 9mm with large capacity magazines plus body armor so yes, he could have confronted the shooter.

968834643159126017 2018-02-28 13:05:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lollardfish Wishful thinking won't resolve real problems. Guns will not go away because of constitution. So why don't consider practical and feasible solutions?

968695548873183232 2018-02-27 03:53:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @EnticingMessage He couldn't know the type of weapon shooter had. Nobody expect him to go face to face like an old west duel but he is trained to enter and engage. No excuses.
968694574884511747 2018-02-27 03:49:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NYDailyNews @TrumpTruthNow First, he couldn't know what type of weapon the shooter had. Second, yes, I would have entered and try to is the shooter so as to enable him and at least distract his from the victims. I'm not crazy or suicidal but do believe that when good people don't act evil prevails.

968191801210306561 2018-02-26 18:31:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @piersmorgan Piers w few exceptions all guns would kill. The obsession w ar-15 on both sides detract from real concerns like background check, mental health, security.

967949290252447745 2018-02-25 02:27:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 Reason we have so nothing Congress is because both parties have gone to extreme. Neither JFK or Reagan would be welcomed oray at their respective party.
967948969715339266 2018-02-25 02:26:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 That goes all sort of ways. Planned Parenthood funds Dems and IMO is actually an org that does murder. Dems whine about Koch brothers while having Soros and Hollywood $.
967945874474184704 2018-02-25 02:14:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 I can say Rubio and Nelson r my senators because I votes for both of them. I told I b4, I'm an independent. I voted Trump 4 specific reasons and agree w something and disagree on others.
967945308855504896 2018-02-25 02:11:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 Well u r smarter than mr. Katsky. Some kids r like u some like him.
967944999055785985 2018-02-25 02:10:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 Now, the FL Dept of family's failure to follow up? That one sits at Scott's feet.
967944771548401664 2018-02-25 02:09:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 Problem is sheriff is not under Scott's authority. The state certifies all law enforcement agencies but sheriff is an elected official and can only be removed for certain specific reasons.
967942518603214848 2018-02-25 02:00:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 I watched the town hall w an open mind and there were a few moments that caught my attention and the following days as new info came out but their focus remains only on NRA my instinct tells me something ain't right here.
967941953777266698 2018-02-25 01:58:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 Not at all. I understand them being angry, afraid, demanding something be done. I just don't like anybody trying to pull a fast one on me. I don't trust until I verify. Life lessons learned.
967941174441971715 2018-02-25 01:55:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 Mr. Kasky clearly had an anti NRA belief way b4 the shooting.

967940664406282241 2018-02-25 01:53:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 "...I hope everybody at the NRA shoot themselves..." Nov 2027 "I think it should be encouraged that we punch alt-right people in he face. It's a miracle I don't punch the average republican in the first place." Jan 2017 This is a portion of two I had saved.
967932719161380864 2018-02-25 01:21:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 The FL Dept of law enforcement is now investigating the sheriff office's response to shooting.
967932515494383616 2018-02-25 01:21:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 Anyways, more and more info comes out about the Dem sheriff's failures and the kids r mum about it? It's weird to me that they would give a pass to a party whose failures is directly related to shooting while going after NRA solely for political reasons.
967924762386337795 2018-02-25 00:50:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 I have not just in fox but other outlets. They don't tow the trio's line and in fact disagree w their blame the guns narrative.
967924409972461570 2018-02-25 00:48:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 Spell correct  meant "guns"
967923468284170241 2018-02-25 00:45:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 U e funny. Why don't u look them up? See this is what life experience has taught me: verify, verify, verify. I research everything and distrust all media.
967922991073021953 2018-02-25 00:43:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LALife8 Everything is screened. Both sides. All sides. He Town Hall was as objective as Sean Penn's adulation of Chavez.
967922518798499841 2018-02-25 00:41:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 I'm sure there r many who may share such views as r many who don't but this is not a numbers game. It's about having the maturity to discuss a problem without demonizing those in opposition and on this they started on wrong footing.
967921995676618753 2018-02-25 00:39:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 So u think those students who express disagreement w these 3 other 3 r less courageous?
967921742894288898 2018-02-25 00:38:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 The other also declared his lib views. Emma's prior known view is that she hates tins which is not a big deal as she has the right to her opinion as we all do. But it's Cameron the most troubling one.
967921230224510978 2018-02-25 00:36:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 When their names came out I read their older postings. Cameron wrote about violent actions against Republicans per se. He even mentioned  a rifle. He's taken the posts down but some people saved them and r out there.
967918897222619138 2018-02-25 00:27:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LALife8 So u contend that nobody affected by this shooting was at the WH meeting?
967918535090503680 2018-02-25 00:25:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 It seems to me that their moment of fame has gone to their head.
967917748469882880 2018-02-25 00:22:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 I know u don't see the other students as the lib media don't cover them but we do see them here. Broward county is mostly Dem and that won't change.
967917440414953472 2018-02-25 00:21:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidhogg111 @LALife8 He, Cameron, and Emma, had an agenda prior to this. David and Cameron the most. This seems IMO a tragedy that fell into their laps specially the two boys.

I considered moving there but after staying in LA, San Diego, a SFO we decided against it. Nice weather but too expensive and too weird at least west of the Sierra Nevada.

It wasn't a vote on the bill itself.

967821766566580224 2018-02-25 18:01:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @cameron_kasky Issue should be with the state authorities and sheriff's office and FBI. Their collective failure is why Cruz was able to get the weapons.

967793128039174144 2018-02-25 16:07:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Ike_Saul I read the pre-shooting postings of at least 1 of  b4 he took them down and saw an  already committed liberal loon perhaps because his parents are that or biases teaching at school. Then this guy tried silence other survivor who came out w CNN scripted questions?
967792239060627456 2018-02-25 16:03:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BuzzFeedNews A misinformation war is more correct. How many kids know about NRA and yet that was their target from the get go? Libs try and use this tragedy as political pony and it will backfire because we are not fools Soros.

967574552971808768 2018-02-24 01:38:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RawStory Naively idiotic. Applying their ideas the only weapons left r revolvers and shotguns. News flash: criminals will merely get high power weapons from black market. Regulate? Is regulated already. System, not regulations, failed.

"If theres gunfire, we teach the officers to isolate, distract and neutralize. We want people to go directly to the sounds of the gunfire." This from a top active shooting trainer.

Let me share another tidbit: he and the school district agreed to cooperate and reduce arrest rates for juveniles. So deputies have less authority to arrest why? Improved rates mean more grant $. Sick.

Broward district did little to nothing on this.

Only after this tragedy has this so-called sheriff said his Dept will now provide the arm to deputies.

A neighboring city dispatched it's cops to help and while these cops stored in the deputy, and 3 other deputies, remained outside. The police chief of the neighboring city has already complained about this.

967445984170176513 2018-02-24 17:07:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CondoleezaRice @jenjherron Yes it is. It's a lighter version of the m-16 albeit only semi-automatic. Let's be honest about it and not follow libs lying about things to defend their positions.

967121769332203521 2018-02-23 19:39:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mattwilstein @thedailybeast Good she dared. Media turns tragedy into staged shows for ratings because ratings bring in ad revenue. Look at the town hall, a Springer like show designed to pull in CNN viewer base: lib loons.
967120056500056064 2018-02-23 19:32:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNN @NicoleHockley We need to stop demonizing each other. The truth is that we r mostly reasonable people but political agendas pull us on opposite directions for the ideologues gain, not ours.
967119199683346433 2018-02-23 19:29:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNN There's a reason why media focus is bad news.
967119052681437185 2018-02-23 19:28:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNN Is not that media people love shootings is just that media peddles bad news for ratings. All media outlets have mastered the art of merchandising tragedy. The music, lighting, everything is staged and managed to maximize as revenue.

He seemingly worked out a deal w school authorities to reduce arrest rates so that both the school and sheriff's office get a bigger share of grants. Corruption galore.
967107792896184321 2018-02-23 18:44:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NRA @browardsheriff @Mikecschoen Israel should resign. This boils down to failed leadership.

967087116529356801 2018-02-23 17:21:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @joyreaper The more info comes out the more obvious that the school system and law enforcement messed up big time. The Sheriff should resign because the failure likes at his feet.

967086286996680709 2018-02-23 17:18:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NBCNightlyNews @warrior64111 Exactly. You and I could easily draft a reasonable piece of legislation that meets the needs without sacrificing eights but we r both free of debt to interests that "invested" to get us elected.

967027891539251201 2018-02-23 13:26:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NBCNightlyNews @warrior64111 Because we r not Australia.

Ban assault rifles except one can build one w plastic, aluminum, and 3d printer and make own ammo. Will a criminal be stopped by a ban? No.
966757033264533504 2018-02-22 19:30:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tedlieu And hence the lack of civil discourse in our society today. Odd how no such barbs were directed to Dem sen Nelson and Dem sheriff whose Dept has more to do w the shooting because they dropped the ball huge time.
966739259758653440 2018-02-22 18:19:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MarisaKabas And yet nobody called his agency's failure out?

966724904807780353 2018-02-22 17:22:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MeteuWuliechsin Because the world has changed. We r focusing now on school shootings by troubled people but, what about terrorists? We can't walk into most places without security checks so why r schools left vulnerable?
966724447553118215 2018-02-22 17:20:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MeteuWuliechsin Look at this report:https://twitter.com/jiveDurkey/status/966125844337963009

966722674230747136 2018-02-22 17:13:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MeteuWuliechsin Because IMO politicians benefit from lingering problems as they become campaign issues.
966721054398996481 2018-02-22 17:07:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MeteuWuliechsin Then why didn't Dems do something when they had full control? There was nothing to stall them then but didn't do it.
966714424932421632 2018-02-22 16:40:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Mat0816 Odd since here it's democratic run school boards that r known for waste, inefficiency, and keeping union teachers that should be fired.

966709393051004928 2018-02-22 16:20:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MeteuWuliechsin Then u should give NRA credit for certain lives saves by Kevlar sheets used by ROTC kids to shield many from bullets. NRA provides those.
966709055220744193 2018-02-22 16:19:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MeteuWuliechsin On the other hand, they just don't trust Democrats as much as those in the left distrust Republicans.
966708897796055042 2018-02-22 16:18:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MeteuWuliechsin I don't belong to NRA or any lobbying group but so know plenty of gun owners and q the he exception of weird old guy I don't know anybody who disagrees w universal background checks and limiting or banning specific assault rifles and ammo.
966708452918689793 2018-02-22 16:17:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MeteuWuliechsin So we need an ar-15 for protection? No. Unless u live out in the woods. But gun control advocates use of banning semi-automatic weapons do so knowing this goes beyond ar-15 styled weapons as my 9mm 8 rounds pistol is such a semi-automatic and thus subject to such broad band.
966707936218230785 2018-02-22 16:15:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MeteuWuliechsin There's always more to any issue. NRA feeds off paranoia about taking 2nd amendment rights away while those on the other side feed off false assumption that gun owners r obsessed w guns when all we most care about is right to protect ourselves.
966707084342579200 2018-02-22 16:11:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MeteuWuliechsin How his attitude hurt? He looked like an idiot. He acted like a child trying to impress a girl. He should stop seeking the spotlight and look at how the other kids handled themselves in a far more dignified way.
966706476046782465 2018-02-22 16:09:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MeteuWuliechsin Problem is when question was scripted by CNN.
966706275961704448 2018-02-22 16:08:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MeteuWuliechsin Why didn't he showed same aggressive posture to the democratic sheriff? His agency knew of the shooter's problems and they like others dropped the ball. Why the single pointing of blame at GOP and NRA?
966704534742499330 2018-02-22 16:01:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MeteuWuliechsin Like u I don't want more of the same political answers but solutions must b discussed within realm of practicality and reasonableness. To tag Rubio or NRA as responsible 4 shooting is disingenuous.
966704041215582209 2018-02-22 15:59:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MeteuWuliechsin I won't mind a forceful and vigorous debate but that's not what the kid did. He is acting up a role based on his ideology and looks to be simply self-promoting. Look at those kids who lost lived ones and they showed a poise absent in Cameron.
966693904140693505 2018-02-22 15:19:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @haidaf1992 Handled. Unfortunately small keyboards don't always work w big fingers.
966693720572743680 2018-02-22 15:18:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @marcorubio @TheCurtKingston It's a rhetorical question. Alledging that GOP is in NRAs pocket ignores that Dems r also I their pocket.
966685902868230144 2018-02-22 14:47:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MeteuWuliechsin He was grandstanding w a scripted question and follow up. IMO he actually hurts the true concerns w his attitude.
966685664824741888 2018-02-22 14:46:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MeteuWuliechsin It's more than that. I got to read this kid's pre-shooting posts and found him to be an already committed liberal zealot who was suggestive of  violence, even gun violence, against Republicans per se.
966685022181822470 2018-02-22 14:44:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Not_Yves No he wasn't. He actually handed that petulant spoiled brat quite well.
966684711421652992 2018-02-22 14:42:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Shareblue @DimitriousGart2 Doesn't that sound like most politicians in both parties?
966684434501193729 2018-02-22 14:41:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @gaabyaalex Nobody will as he's not up for re-election.
966683930479996928 2018-02-22 14:39:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Shareblue The question is if the guns we're THE factor and they e not. They were one of many factors.
966683577101402112 2018-02-22 14:38:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @shearm @tackettdc Struggled only because they didn't want to let her speak.
966683392824705025 2018-02-22 14:37:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MadisonKittay Funny as your profile pic prompts same reaction here.
966683189682081793 2018-02-22 14:36:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @marklutchman @chaddylo Cnn scripted questions? A petulent spoiled brat whose pre-shooting posts include utter contempt and even suggestive violence against Republicans? Even use of a rifle? Ambush doesn't begin to describe it.
966682569382223872 2018-02-22 14:34:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @marblemadeflesh Letting a childish petulant teenager banter is not losing to him. Cameron actually showed why kids don't vote.
966681972474081280 2018-02-22 14:31:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @chicagotribune Another cnn scripted line?
966681534911733760 2018-02-22 14:30:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JuddLegum Their ideas are.
966681324005347334 2018-02-22 14:29:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JaredWeissNBA If liberals think we don't see their fingerprints in the cnn scripted questions then u must think we r fools.
966676040147001345 2018-02-22 14:08:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @justkelly_ok Respect your position but u do know that won't happen so what can be realistically be done?
966675747606859776 2018-02-22 14:07:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @OhNoSheTwitnt They would probably be more horrified that we have come to a point when our values have been so degraded that murder is a right when it comes to abortions and people make money by desensitizing minds w video game and other such junk.
966675112014635009 2018-02-22 14:04:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @barry The second amendment doesn't relate to the army or guard. Knowledge of whole context is important.
966674890425290752 2018-02-22 14:03:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @OhNoSheTwitnt Wrong. There were automatic weapons.
966674302602006528 2018-02-22 14:01:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChristineEmba And unfortunately she was factually wrong in that there were automatic weapons when the second amendment was drafted.
966673150946828289 2018-02-22 13:56:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @summerbrennan Shouldn't we apply the same concept to planned Parenthood? Unions? All lobbying groups lobby their cause and interests. What gives them ultimate power is the numbers behind them.
966671564048601088 2018-02-22 13:50:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenatorDurbin And yet you and your party turns a blind eye to the violent crimes from irresponsible open borders and sanctuary cities?
966671152310554627 2018-02-22 13:48:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JayWBZ What's the rationale for he down vote? Shouldn't the whole story be presented?
966670818980835329 2018-02-22 13:47:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NPR Could it be that media's facilitating a platform for sick people to gain their twisted version of fame encourages copy cats?
966670459273187328 2018-02-22 13:46:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @alexmorgan13 This while regulations in place which could have prevented this tragedy weren't followed.
966670163029450753 2018-02-22 13:45:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @splcenter These kids r being used by liberal media and who knows who else and that's shameful.
966670015167680512 2018-02-22 13:44:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @splcenter Then we have another student denouncing that cnn wanted him to ask scripted questions and not the one he truly wanted to ask so he refused.
966669756349722624 2018-02-22 13:43:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @splcenter Well I read previous posts by three of the "leaders" and found they r already deep into liberal beliefs. This Coleman kid's pre-shooting postings about punching Republicans and other sort of violence, including reference to a rifle, show that there's more than meets the eye
966668628648218624 2018-02-22 13:38:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NRA @marcorubio @cameron_kasky @RLSeikel @mcdandyandy Did u see about one such student, Colton Haab, who said CNN gave him scripted questions quashing the one he wanted to ask? These kids r being manipulated and that is disgusting.
966667532856909824 2018-02-22 13:34:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lkherman @repairrestores1 @MaureenStartin Even the more relevant the question. Those w knowledge of the law should temper the otherwise emotionally charged debate if solutions r to be found.
966654799990153216 2018-02-22 12:43:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NRA @marcorubio @cameron_kasky @RLSeikel @mcdandyandy His not too old posts show a loonie lib in the making even, yes perhaps jokingly, talking about violence against Republicans.
966654235122323458 2018-02-22 12:41:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @marcorubio @TheCurtKingston So, why didn't Dems so a thing about this when they had full control ?
966653973766856706 2018-02-22 12:40:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lkherman @waywardson2016 Really?
966653630911778819 2018-02-22 12:39:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NRA @marcorubio @cameron_kasky @RLSeikel @mcdandyandy Absolutely. Why shouldn't  u?
966582809786798080 2018-02-21 07:57:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @marcorubio @JasonMcGill2 A sensible position that echoes what most Americans could get behind.
966582511563431936 2018-02-21 07:56:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @marcorubio @julie_library Self defense? A 9mm pistol is also a semi-automatic.
966581879955746817 2018-02-21 07:54:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @marcorubio @TheCurtKingston Why is it all about GOP as if Dems didn't get such donations?
966581554779652096 2018-02-21 07:52:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @marcorubio @inkandtonic There r far more people whom he represents who were not there.
966579829813506048 2018-02-21 07:46:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @peterdaou Why? The one who committed the murders is not her or any law abiding fun owner.
966579533242601472 2018-02-21 07:44:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @charles_gaba The teacher actually flunked on this one. She has her facts wrong.
966579058325819392 2018-02-21 07:43:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @rmayemsinger Because they represent people? Or r gun owners excluded from the discussion?
966578503721373697 2018-02-21 07:40:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @cmclymer What I see is kids thrown into a complex problem while manipulated by others w their own agendas.
966576199874080768 2018-02-21 07:31:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NRA @marcorubio @cameron_kasky @RLSeikel Show them his past posts so they get he whole story.
966575671798587393 2018-02-21 07:29:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NRA @owillis @cameron_kasky @ChelseaClinton Funny since his postings way before this sad incident. I guess Dems can always use a prop.
966575304541134848 2018-02-21 07:28:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @_riaxx_ He's actually playing the role he's played way before: a young liberal zealot. He actually hurts their otherwise legitimate concern because the rest of us see through the self-promoting show of his.
966574252534190080 2018-02-21 07:23:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kellyblaus @DeborahLGreene Yes those terms r not proper.
966574104055861248 2018-02-21 07:23:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kellyblaus Frankly he's annoying. His childish petulance taints the movement and it's goals.
966563040736014337 2018-02-21 06:39:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @browardsheriff @marcorubio @NRA @DLoesch @BrettClarkson_ Kids don't know yet but they will learn in due time that most of this is about midterm elections for both parties.
966562041359224833 2018-02-21 06:35:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @POTUS @browardsheriff @amandanewb Ar-15 is a semi-automatic weapon like any 9mm pistol and that's the problem in that some want to disguise a broader ban of guns as merely dealing w assault rifles. Both sides play games.
966554744935342080 2018-02-21 06:06:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @atrupar I'm not NRA member and don't see use of ar-15 type of weapons but frankly Dana handled things impressively well and Israel came through as a sheister avoiding the issue or law enforcement missing out big time.
966554354793762817 2018-02-21 06:04:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @atrupar Amazing how your bias filters the narrative. Reminds me of Hussein's minister claiming they were winning the war as allied troops were less than 40 miles from the city.
966548030181830656 2018-02-21 05:39:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lkherman @Effulgently The pain is that they teach distorted history by misrepresentation or historical facts.
966547788950589440 2018-02-21 05:38:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lkherman @MaureenStartin @repairrestores1 Is that your legal opinion or just an opinion?
966547639020982272 2018-02-21 05:38:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lkherman @MaureenStartin And u would b wrong. suggest u read the Heller decision where Scalia gave a good reading and analysis on this.
966547311445839872 2018-02-21 05:36:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lkherman @waywardson2016 We must have watched two different Town Halls because she was poised and answered questions factually and intelligently.
966547068121767936 2018-02-21 05:35:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lkherman And she answered her questions factually and accurately. Frankly, just what history do they teach nowadays?
966546047978876928 2018-02-21 05:31:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaylorMade729 So my 9mm, 8+1 capacity, pistol would be banned because a nut cake committed a crime? Thank goodness constitution can't be triffled with that easily.
966539907505192960 2018-02-21 05:07:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BrianNormoyle Of course u do. Wouldn't expect u not to as u r clearly entrenched.
966539504210399233 2018-02-21 05:05:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @igorvolsky No he didn't. The father wanted an answer to fit his needs and Marco didn't pander to such need.
966538934284181504 2018-02-21 05:03:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MarcACaputo Marco showed himself as a leader tonight.

966528037142564870 2018-02-21 04:20:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @axios A false premise by a politician w an agenda. His agency screwed up and he looked like the politician thinking of his re-election.
966522279042707456 2018-02-21 03:57:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SalHernandez If childish outbursts is being owned then yes.
966522074582921218 2018-02-21 03:56:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NRA @igorvolsky I think his answer was clear: those supporting him buy into his agenda and not the other way around. I wonder about this Cameron kid whose childish self-promoting outbursts diminish the seriousness of the issue.
966521450688663552 2018-02-21 03:54:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sarahchad_ Frankly Cameron's childish outbursts take away from the seriousness of the issue.
966519446704713728 2018-02-21 03:46:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MarisaKabas Israel is being a politician. He should just admit that BSO screwed up. Period.
966517063102730240 2018-02-21 03:36:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NRA @cameron_kasky @mjfree Bam what? His childish outbursts take away from the seriousness of the issue.
966516790900744193 2018-02-21 03:35:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @williamlegate Frankly he's acting as an inmature boy taking away from what is an issue that needs serious discussion.
966493209324085248 2018-02-21 02:01:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @polishprincessh He's just pandering as a Dem surrogate.

966470362656624640 2018-02-21 00:31:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AHamiltonSpirit Have u researched how such ideas square w constitution?
966470101540179968 2018-02-21 00:30:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Mom101 And that should be respected. I know other teachers who r willing to take that responsibility.
966469878445166592 2018-02-21 00:29:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BettyBowers Funny how it was mentally ill people and terrorists who did the deeds.
966469660110741504 2018-02-21 00:28:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RVAwonk @ToDropADime2 I assume u took the false messaging and didn't read and research the question and answer.
966469507538669568 2018-02-21 00:27:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RVAwonk She didn't suggested it, she was pressed to answer their questions and frankly her initial answer was right: leave it to local authorities. What does a city slicker know about living w wildlife that's potentially dangerous?
966468955660537857 2018-02-21 00:25:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lancestipher Sounds nice but it's simplistic banter.
966468643520483329 2018-02-21 00:24:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @wokeluisa Now banning rifles sounds like the proper emotional band aid but we need serious analysis of underlying causes otherwise you take rifles and the people wishing to do harm just move on to other means.
966468297255542784 2018-02-21 00:22:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @wokeluisa Luisa, serious issues require serious thinking and such comment about banning races is wrong because it's false.

966325084217540610 2018-02-21 14:53:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @aninjaisborn @Citizen_216 The biggest commitment to being American is to become a citizen. There's a reason why non-citizens can't vote or run for public office.
966294647109767171 2018-02-21 12:52:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNNPolitics There's no doubt that the motivation is genuine but there's something off about the whole thing that starts to smell like politically manipulated.

966121954465009665 2018-02-20 01:26:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @joshgad @wowthanksguys It may have been untimely but it's true. U have kids joking about how they thought this kid would be the one if a shooting occurred and heard his many odd comments. The neighbors saw him do odd stuff too. In this case silence did kill.
966117369482563585 2018-02-20 01:08:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @joshgad @wowthanksguys There's no question the FBI messed up. Two tips, most recent in January, that they didn't follow up. Four recent shootings are linked to systemic faliure. As to blaming the kids, please show me where as I didn't see that.

The amendment process and electoral college make the difference in avoiding mob rule and few states dominating all like in Canada.
966103962821816320 2018-02-20 00:15:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AP @SteveBlogs11 @Camaran @williamsmth66 @jacobfromkansas @Bill_TPA Is the poisoning of minds w glorification of violence by entertainment industry part of the problem? I think so but we don't hear a peep about this and the $ they give to Dems.
966103637847142401 2018-02-20 00:13:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AP @SteveBlogs11 @Camaran @williamsmth66 @jacobfromkansas @Bill_TPA And yet the gun ownership is almost as high in Switzerland and Israel and it doesn't happen either. Why? Guns have been a picture of American life forever but these shootings r a relatively new phenomenon.
966103259072155649 2018-02-20 00:12:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AP @SteveBlogs11 @Camaran @williamsmth66 @jacobfromkansas @Akruzel312 @Bill_TPA Right to bear arms is well-grounded in the common law and it's up to us to reasonably regulate it. There r things that we all can agree like much comprehensive background checks and no access to military caliber guns and ammo.

966101099831791616 2018-02-20 00:03:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DeanObeidallah Last I checked your hero Obama oversaw 20+ shootings and sis squat and his doj found bump stocks legal?
966100706771001350 2018-02-20 00:02:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidaxelrod Hey he's doing more than your guy Obama did as he did what? Nothing.

What I pointed out is that the narrative of the founding fathers relying on sling shot technology while drafting second amendment is plain false.
966098729886470144 2018-02-20 23:54:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AP @SteveBlogs11 @Bill_TPA @Camaran @williamsmth66 @jacobfromkansas The Girardoni rifle was just one such rifle already known in America. Others? The Meriwether Lewis and others using kalthoff repeater technology. It's documented and arguing the contrary is tantamount to saying Columbus didn't come to the Americas.

966096236985151494 2018-02-20 23:44:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AP @SteveBlogs11 @Camaran @williamsmth66 @jacobfromkansas @Bill_TPA One thing I for from studying Jefferson is how aware he was of progress. A maniac could use a rifle, tnt, you name it. Those who narrowly define this as a gun problem betray reality.
966095593931231232 2018-02-20 23:41:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillGalvano @ananavarro The biggest problem right now is that the systems to communicate relevant info r broken. This is true of this and most other shootings.
966095335952146433 2018-02-20 23:40:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillGalvano @ananavarro We should stop being reactive and instead take a comprehensive list at it all. Most of the proposals are band-aids to prevent something that has already occurred.
966094361921556481 2018-02-20 23:36:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ananavarro Actually I read their own Twitter feeds and found the two main ones to have a defined agenda w liberal leanings. Just saying.
966094062087483392 2018-02-20 23:35:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @joshgremillion I went over his Twitter feed and found his self-describing atheism and various retweets of Dems lib loons. Not judging, just pointing out that he seems eager to play into certain media narrative.
966090019680202752 2018-02-20 23:19:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AP @JonniRage @Copperflowers Again that pesky little thing called the Constitution.
966089875144499200 2018-02-20 23:19:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AP @JackTheFact29 Cowards? How so?
966089664850485248 2018-02-20 23:18:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AP @CoreyClayton @imizamb Funny thing is that Dems didn't do it when they had full power to do so? 24 shootings. During Obamas and he didn't do squat and yet libs r harping at Trump?
966089286851407873 2018-02-20 23:16:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AP @SteveBlogs11 @Bill_TPA @Camaran @williamsmth66 @jacobfromkansas That's incorrect. Look up guardino rifle which Jefferson owned. It was w 20 capacity semi-automatic rifle. Founding fathers were not that prehistoric.
966088855651790848 2018-02-20 23:15:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AP @gooddoggoodlife @sweetcyn41 @Kurt_reichbloom @GoatKnocker @savannahsister I also would support stricter background checks, age requirements, and other reasonable means to see that guns don't go to people who shouldn't have them.
966088585706393600 2018-02-20 23:14:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AP @gooddoggoodlife @sweetcyn41 @Kurt_reichbloom @GoatKnocker @savannahsister Why don't look at problem I'm rational way instead of polarizing views? I support 2e amendment and see no reason why an ar-15 is needed in urban settings or for civilian access to high caliber ammo.

966084406225055747 2018-02-20 22:57:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @joshgad @wowthanksguys He said what he had to say. No matter what he did those who hate him would complaint.

965995884809981952 2018-02-20 17:05:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @paullb14u We did. That's why Hillary lost.

965991704343056385 2018-02-20 16:49:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @EdKrassen Use of the word "kill" in a heated point in time is stupid.

965975195713507328 2018-02-20 15:43:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill To think Kasich was my first choice when he ran. Glad he lost as we don't need anymore spineless people who react to winds of the moment.
965974858269167617 2018-02-20 15:42:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @EricBoehlert Is this the liberals next chapter of irrational dispair?
965974387336929280 2018-02-20 15:40:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @krassenstein This is the same moron who wanted to give the keys to the city to a convicted felon?
965974347633618947 2018-02-20 15:40:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JoyAnnReid This is the same moron who wanted to give the keys to the city to a convicted felon?
965974068360105984 2018-02-20 15:38:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kylegriffin1 So taking $ from murdering planned Parenthood? Or entertainment industry violence peddlers?
965964736255930368 2018-02-20 15:01:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NRA @News8Daybreak Isn't this the same "genius" who wanted to give a convicted felon the keys to the city back in 2011? I guess idiots don't change just get older.
965923978165530624 2018-02-20 12:19:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FSUeyedoc Angry at what? Your dad or you didn't use the rifle for evil. Objectifying our anger at such evil is senseless. This rifle could save a life as it did in TX where a good citizen used it to put down a Church shooter.
965922773699825664 2018-02-20 12:15:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MayaHold3r Before speaking one must learn and understand the problem in all it's complexity or one falls into becoming a prop of those who have been part of letting the problem fester.
965922322610905088 2018-02-20 12:13:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mroutman Shouldn't also donations from entertainment industry that peddles glorified be denounced?
965921787933614080 2018-02-20 12:11:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @joshgad What should sink in is the level of hatred that leads u to turn everything about bad Trump. It was wrong w Obama and it's wrong now.
965921320193150976 2018-02-20 12:09:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @joshgad @Smoothklutch Doing what? Playing golf? I guess same ones who did that when Obama played told after a journalist was beheaded?
965921071689060352 2018-02-20 12:08:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @joshgad @wowthanksguys There's a reason most POTUS skip these and they should. It's not a moment to have security detail make the moments more difficult.
965919898449928192 2018-02-20 12:03:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @joshgad @AmandaCrumleyLA Did the WH say that or the Washington Post?
965903095019507712 2018-02-20 10:56:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ESPNMichele How did it go from the three leaders to the Obama con?

965886558837575680 2018-02-20 09:51:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @paulkrugman It wouldn't be first time the left finds props willing to play a role in the liberal charade. Cynical? Perhaps but it's hard not to be in this America of Obama, Pelosi, HRC, Soros, and the rest of them.

Look at comey's handling of email fiasco, he made calls he had no authority to make and even changed legal standards applicable to exhonerate HRC. That was bad.

Odd thing is that sales of AR-15 go up after such tragedies because of lib politicians using tragedies to push their agenda of banning all semi-automatic guns.

Stop using a tragedy to lean your own biases on. The real issue is that both federal and state authorities knew of his history, mental problems, medications, and he slip through a background check?
965061220540837891 2018-02-17 03:11:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Now we know bot federal and state authorities knew of his history of mental and emotional issues going back more than a year. How did he get approved to purchase a weapon? Total system failure at all levels.

Thankfully in this country our institutions r set up in such a way that we can't turn the Constitution upside down on a whim.

965000484024193024 2018-02-17 23:10:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChrChristensen So u should know how values have gone down hill as secular humanism has robbed a generation of am extrinsic moral compass and replaced it w moral relativism.
964981687397552128 2018-02-17 21:55:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChrChristensen Guns will remain a large part of American life and so-called gun control is tantamount to using a fork to drink soup.

964980925602942976 2018-02-17 21:52:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChrChristensen BTW, my question about Islam was honest and not me intending to be facetious. Just like u don't understand guns in America, we don't under Islam in Europe. Don't take it the wrong way.
964980670715125760 2018-02-17 21:51:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChrChristensen Do we have a problem here? Yes. And it's more about loss of values, increased individual isolationism, and many other factors because there always been a plethora of guns here but increase in mass murders is a more recent phenomenon.
964980222843064320 2018-02-17 21:49:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChrChristensen It's u who came pontificating about how Sweden handles guns but we r not Sweden and we went through entire independence ordeal not to be Europe.

964962949797380096 2018-02-17 20:41:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChrChristensen So why aren't you guys treating Islamic invasion as the dangerous threat it is? Just curious.

964917453556998145 2018-02-17 17:40:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @madeleine Absolutely correct. The year is 2014 and Obama learns of this and does nothing. Too late to impeach him though.

Massive amount of guns have been around for a long time but mass shootings haven't so we must examine what has changed cultural and value wise.

Will u look at some of your donors in entertainment industry who have poisoned a generation w glorified violence in movies, music, video games?
964911685768269825 2018-02-17 17:17:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @POTUS @JamilSmith The chaos we see is exactly what Putin had in mind no matter who won. Many r playing Putin's game for the sake of partisanship and hatred.

What I see here is quite diff and having lived in Canada I feel there's far more integration here than in Canada where there's a lack of a Canadian identity.
964909793386393600 2018-02-17 17:09:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JamilSmith And yet his target was a mostly white school? Whole white supremacist angle is blown as it will come out that this kid has mental issues.
964909476980674560 2018-02-17 17:08:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JamilSmith @lf092313 Many Trump voters, not followers, r minorities. Do u see the sheer idiocy of your generalization?
964894419219615744 2018-02-17 16:08:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @business @JamilSmith If that's the case plenty working in Obama administration must be questioned as they knew back in 2014 but I guess Obama, Lynch, Rice, and others will bring out that this would be all about racism.....

964856917150625793 2018-02-17 13:39:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd Social media w all it's positives has shown the danger of the mass reaction without the benefit of reason. Right, left, all running like dumb cows at any sound.
964856491424481280 2018-02-17 13:38:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd Russia interfering w our democracy is as old as us interfering in their affairs and those of others. Diff is that this time they got emotionally charged ignorant people as pawns driven by fake news so no matter who won there would be chaos.
964852310479425538 2018-02-17 13:21:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ConservativeTht @mikewritesabit @HiltonDan @Deplorable_Vik @rankjm1 @grimois Of course it's not and can be amended but such amendment will not take place.
964742924310282240 2018-02-16 06:06:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise Don't think so. I did a bit of top negotiating w NY corps and they r sharks. It's a tough environment and in that basis I understand Trump's brash in your face attitude. I don't like it bur understand it.
964741899419561984 2018-02-16 06:02:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise I don't know if they felt bad or policy prevented them from reporting. We should ask why no action was taken and remedy that systemic failure.
964741422531403777 2018-02-16 06:00:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise I don't feat a zombi Apocalypse so an ar-15 is not something fitting my security needs.
964740955797704705 2018-02-16 05:59:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise A revolver only takes 5 bullets because reality is that self-defense is mostly in close quarters and if u need more than 2 bullets u r either injured or death.
964740544973897728 2018-02-16 05:57:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise Exactly. I get people's concerns w guns but also get that most gun owners r responsible people. I own a number of weapons and my choices r made w self-defense in mind. I have 9mm, 380, a shotgun which is the best choice for home protection and carry a revolver bat all times.
964738446911819776 2018-02-16 05:49:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise Both. History is that as death penalty approaches this type of guys open up.
964738077641109506 2018-02-16 05:47:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise I think it's just a systemic failure w so many leg barriers to share Information. We need to act smarter.
964737628494094336 2018-02-16 05:45:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise He could still be juiced to understand how sick minds work.
964737047784230914 2018-02-16 05:43:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise 30+ Police visits, odd commentary at school, expelled, you name it. So many red flags that were not collected in a central point for analysis. Big systemic failure.
964736478382317568 2018-02-16 05:41:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise He will. Whole Russia collusion is a myth. Russia interfered in the election? Absolutely. Their goal was to create discord and supported Bernie against Hillary and even Stein. They organized pro and anti Trump rallies. Their goal is to plant distrust and hand-tied the govt.
964735685344276480 2018-02-16 05:38:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise We'll see. I think Trump is demonized too much albeit he doesn't help his cause w some dumb worded comments but I'll see where we r in 2020 and decide then.
964735248222343168 2018-02-16 05:36:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise It seems that was part of then problem but he didn't go for her or the boyfriend so perhaps he felt isolated and took his rage on everybody.
964734938871402496 2018-02-16 05:35:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise I think we may find out it's a mix of things and certainly a breakdown in the system as he should've been flagged so that he couldn't buy a firearm.
964734601905229824 2018-02-16 05:33:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise Things will become clearer as we move forward and having him alive is a rare opportunity to dissect his mind and get a glimpse into the why. What I read from experts is that he may be either autistic or have a fetal syndrome. That's beyond me but want to hear it all.
964731821211684864 2018-02-16 05:22:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise I voted Trump knowing he is a narcissist, offensive and too crass because my concern was the Supreme Court. He's done some food stuff and other bad. I can't tell u know if I would vote for him in 2020.
964731261888671744 2018-02-16 05:20:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise Why? I may have voted for Trump but am not a right wing nut heck I despise extremes on both sides of the political spectrum. I voted for senator bill Nelson and wanted the Dem candidate to beat Rick Scott. I didn't vote Obama because I never trusted him.
964730620437061633 2018-02-16 05:17:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise I have not seen confirmation of the alleged posts you believe to be his. Doe a white supremacist he chose a weird school as it is a mostly white. Again, let's let the facts come out.
964729459772461056 2018-02-16 05:13:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise Roy Moore? A relic of an era of hat it's best gone. Arthur Jones? A nut cake.
964726433888206849 2018-02-16 05:01:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise I don't think this guy was ideologically and driven. He's a misfit, a mentally and/or emotionally broken person who had a grudge. Why would he let a freshman he first met upon entering the school go? Let's wait for answers.
964725885982175232 2018-02-16 04:59:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise There r things we don't know yet. I can tell u there is a diagnosis of a mental issue somewhere and it will come out.
964725616821096449 2018-02-16 04:58:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise So am I. Even the sheriff had to come out to say that there's no evidence about links to white supremacists. I'm not saying he wasn't one, I'm saying that as of now there's no evidence of it. I deal in evidence and prudent wait for investigation to report findings.
964723178198224897 2018-02-16 04:48:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MSNBC @CNN @SenMarkey @RepJoeKennedy @AP @senmarcorubio @SenBillNelson @NBCNews @TRR1934 No it doesn't. A thorough studying of the amendment, Federalists papers and other sources clarify that the intent is for an armed citizenry being a guarantor of their freedom from a tyrant.
964721007188639744 2018-02-16 04:39:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenFeinstein Now that is something that makes sense.

964719910235631616 2018-02-16 04:35:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris Why do we have to take them in? In my experience it is far more effective to set up camps I their regions. $ goes further there so more can be done for them there.
964718525595176961 2018-02-16 04:29:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Thelonious_Rex @CEOEnterpise No. The whole white supremacist stuff was a hoax and the media ran w it and now have recanted it. The maga hat? Still unsure it's him but I know plenty Hispanic and Blacks who voted Trump and we're not white supremacists.
964718077794570240 2018-02-16 04:28:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaelianPinoy Not from I've read from many ex-raelians and certainly raels ex-wife and kid were happy only when they kicked that megalomaniac monster out of their lives. I know right now u don't see it but the time will come when u will see the ugly truth about raels lies.

I have family in London, Paris, Barcelona, and the feedback about leftist politicians basically putting your societies indirect path to a fight for survival is almost identical.
964665715985960960 2018-02-16 01:00:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @jaketapper @MookieMurray @johnlaserbeams @MattAlunJordan Firearms have been a permanent part of this country but high occurrence or these incidents is a relatively new phenomenon. Loss or moral values, breaking of family structure, individualism. It's far more complicated than simple gun availability issue.

There has to be a reason for the remarkable difference and I think it's a cultural one. Americans have allowed a culture of glorification of violence to take a hold in younger minds.

964659304480542721 2018-02-16 00:34:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FLGovScott I think there's blame closer home governor. Police went to his guy's house more than 30 times, school expelled him, almost sure he has some sort of diagnosis in his medical history and nothing in FL allowed for all info to be shared? This is on Tallahassee at large u included.

I don't see reason to own an ar-15 as reality is that self defense situations take place in close quarters and if one needs more than 2 bullets you r hurt or dead.

964597227971891201 2018-02-16 20:27:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @joanna_jo_1 Yes but not all shooters are mentally Ill. Some r just plain evil like terrorists. Armed security and other measures must be considered.
964596763096055808 2018-02-16 20:26:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @joanna_jo_1 I don't personally see the need for weapons like the ar-15 but don't think jumping into simplistic solutions will help us deal w a complicated multi-faceted problem.
964596412091691009 2018-02-16 20:24:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @joanna_jo_1 It seems that the red flags were all out re: Cruz but there was no system to process them into a cohesive picture. Now we know of 2 reports to the FBI and nothing was done about it.
964596066514624512 2018-02-16 20:23:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @joanna_jo_1 Well yesterday an similar incident in WA was preempted and the guy was using home made bombs. The diff is that this guy's grandma found his diary and called the authorities.

964586481401696256 2018-02-16 19:45:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FAquila I'm neither. Why not address my point: you and far too many jumped the gun, no pun intended, and let yourselves be a tool in spreading a false narrative. Shouldn't we all be more prudent?

Fact is that studies show that about 24% of mass shootings involved such rifles. About 47% involved hand guns. Point is that we r focusing on tools rather than reasons.

964545986931634176 2018-02-16 17:04:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CBSNews So what's the word today when we learned that whole white supremacist link was a hoax? So much for responsible journalism. And they wonder where "fake news" monicker comes from?

Then the cat is sort of out of the bag w more than 300million guns out there  including about 8million ar-15. Problem is beyond guns, it's a cultural shift to violence.

964321467604316160 2018-02-15 02:12:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BetteMidler Bette, have you discussed how entertainment industry has marketed violence up to a point or desensitizing many? Many in your industry share blood for all of this.

964224057225957376 2018-02-15 19:45:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenBlumenthal What about Dems fidelity to peddlers or violence in Hollywood who generously funds most of your dem colleagues? Remember the folly of throwing rocks up when one has a glass roof.

964156433070743554 2018-02-15 15:16:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @billritter7 I guess you don't know about the Girardoni rifle which had a 20 round capacity? Jefferson owned one so I guess you might need to reassess what the founding fathers actually knew.
964156050453749760 2018-02-15 15:14:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @activist360 Wrong. Assault weapons did exist back then. Jefferson owned a Girardoni riffle w a 20-round capacity.

How would you legislate so that a bad person doesn't make a high capacity weapon using a 3d printer and ordinary materials? It's time to get to real about discussing the issue.
964151363180662785 2018-02-15 14:56:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Mendelpol @fifik500 Really? I guess self defense needs are a thing or the past in your neighborhood? Where is that? Disneyland? Taking honest citizens right to self defense will not stop bad apples.
964150800091140096 2018-02-15 14:53:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kenklippenstein Going down the gun control path is folly. Nowadays you can build a high capacity weapon using 3d printers. So what's next? Ban 3d printers? Why not look into root causes like glorification of violence in entertainment? Broken families?
964149013288243201 2018-02-15 14:46:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TwitchyTeam If true, why didn't they do anything? Perhaps they were too distracted chasing fake Russia collusion.
964122373183234050 2018-02-15 13:01:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Alicious84 Why are this acts on the increase? Glorification of violence in entertainment, loss or values, family fracture, if we don't address these root problems we will not chg a thing.
964121596758765568 2018-02-15 12:57:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @EstradaLisa As a teacher you can tell how kids attitude, respect, discipline have deteriorated from previous generations. Lib groups lawsuits made  it harder for schools to act in loco parentis. Add entertainment industry glorification or violence and we can see the broader picture.
964119695212339206 2018-02-15 12:50:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lindzgearhart Issue is complex but a cultural shift to glorify violence can be traced to entertainment industry.  Video games, music, movies, tv, and parents who abandon their kids to such "distractions" have been a recipe for such madness.
964036131112267778 2018-02-14 07:18:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @activist360 Switzerland has a gun ownership rate similar to the US but no incidents like this one. Is it guns or is it a cultural shift due to glorification of violence?
964021077205749760 2018-02-14 06:18:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @stopthenutjob Sorry but fact is that there were no such shootings back when there gun clubs at schools. This is a sad phenomenon of the past 20yrs. What changed? Glorification or violence by entertainment industry desensitized people. Who gets $ from them? Libs.

963959255345913856 2018-02-14 02:12:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Pappiness Guns r neither disease or antidote. Motives, causes, r varied and one that is not pointed out is how entertainment industry has desensitized young minds w their glorification of violence.
963958761500049408 2018-02-14 02:10:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Goss30Goss Talking gun control now is like covering kids eyes when a kissing scene pops up in a movie. Armed citizens can defend themselves.

Entertainment industry sells violence and desensitize young minds and If not a gun then a trick w manure will do. Let's get serious about this issue.

963938260715175937 2018-02-14 00:49:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @qz How much did the entertainment industry invest in politicians so that there's silence about their poisoning and desensitizing of young minds?

963935754270502913 2018-02-14 00:39:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenBillNelson Senator, stop peddling gun control please. Problem is not guns per see but a change in culture that devalues life.

963932397678055424 2018-02-14 00:26:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @roblee4 What policy? Gun control is a politicians quimera. U Rev. Should point finger at source or problem: entertainment industry poisoning minds w violence, irresponsible detached parents. It's time to deal with those issues now.
963931730259226625 2018-02-14 00:23:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GovMurphy Never let a crisis tomorrow waste politics? Why aren't we discussing the culture or violence coming out of entertainment industry? They have forged a callous generation but as long as they donated major $ to politicians no finger has been pointed at them.

This is the problem w political partisan propaganda passed as news and citizens who fail to educate ourselves about the issues rather than merely rely on such propaganda.

962105970993266688 2018-02-09 23:28:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JRubinBlogger Question should be asked with ALL info on the table.
962105614880182273 2018-02-09 23:27:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @repcleaver What's unjust about expecting compliance w immigration laws? I'd like to see how u react if someone breaks into your house and claims the right to stay in it.
962105109651054592 2018-02-09 23:25:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNN I don't get it, 40 yrs married to US citizen and didn't resolve status issue? There has to be more to this story.
961947464612786176 2018-02-09 12:58:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @shomaristone @HannaBec In Jan 2009 we owed $10trillion. Now, 8 years later it has more than doubled for what? Spending or investing? Largely spending and when it's gone is gone but interest payments remain at around 6.5% of budget and growing.....
961946274093297664 2018-02-09 12:53:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @shomaristone @HannaBec We should have a balanced budget requirement by law. Borrowing may be needed here and there but should not be a major revenue replacement as it's been during no post war period.

961850918403653633 2018-02-08 06:35:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RepKarenBass Well first time was Dems as it takes 60 votes in senate. Now Rand Paul is standing on principle as spending is the problem. This is unlike senile Pelosi banter about her brown Antonio and other crap.

961848566510571520 2018-02-08 06:25:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HaroldItz Funny since Rand seems to be the only voice of reason in that rat club. How much debt do we want to inherit to future generations for liberal grandiose schemes?

961847040085975040 2018-02-08 06:19:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DrDenaGrayson Sorry for being married to that scumbag. Anyways, Senate takes 60 votes and Dems holding Americans hostage over foreigners seems to be the Dems way.
961846584370606080 2018-02-08 06:17:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @adamcbest So Dems hold Americans hostage over foreigners concern. Got it.

Opinions r mostly subjective which is why diff opinions and degrees even amongst similar opinions. This is why we should understand and respect opinions or we surrender claim to ours being respected.

961757357456969728 2018-02-08 00:23:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @1IronMan2018 Problem is this is not one of those "right" things to stand for. "Undocumented workers?" The actual real and only legal term is illegal aliens. See Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492 (2012).
961756848880799744 2018-02-08 00:21:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @dyrbert "undocumented workers?" The actual and only real legal term is illegal aliens. See Arizona v. United States, 132 S.

961750127156359169 2018-02-08 23:54:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GordonFBennett Have a safe trip.

961704782086983681 2018-02-08 20:54:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BdaGovernment @MsMarieFerguson @WhatZitTooya93 So, is it about a relationship w protected rights or a title to it?
961704426401615873 2018-02-08 20:52:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BdaGovernment @MsMarieFerguson @WhatZitTooya93 Why? There's a designation for marriage in fact (cohabitation for a certain period of time ) in most legal systems. Why isn't that a stigma?
961703720827408386 2018-02-08 20:50:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @Brasilmagic @GordonFBennett Well let's ignore the mortgage meltdown that is rooted in policies carried from Carter era and expanded under Clinton. In a vacuum we can rationalize pretty much anything.
961703433282752513 2018-02-08 20:49:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @Brasilmagic @GordonFBennett Well if we make more $ we'd get more benefit. This 1% argument is troubling because they paid 39% of income taxes. Those earning $200k paid 59%. what is enough?
961692289084076033 2018-02-08 20:04:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @Brasilmagic @GordonFBennett I've seen all kinds the of games here in Florida and it's sickening when u do your part and the govt messes u up and gives handouts to freeloaders. Medicare fraud capital down here.
961691661658189824 2018-02-08 20:02:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @Brasilmagic @GordonFBennett Is it a gamble? Sure. Tax cuts worked b4 but e not guaranteed to always produce intended results.
961691361857671172 2018-02-08 20:01:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @Brasilmagic @GordonFBennett I didn't. I wrote Bush-Obama era and that means both of them and the parties behind them and acquiescing to fiscal irresponsibility.

961665910149996546 2018-02-08 18:19:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @Brasilmagic @GordonFBennett Facts r a funny thing to present, this I learned in statistics101. I'm not right or left but for fiscal responsibility and common sense policies.
961665401326309376 2018-02-08 18:17:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @Brasilmagic @GordonFBennett That aside, what job growth? DC area? The bush/Obama era was a disaster for America unless one is on the govt dependency train.
961665061193486337 2018-02-08 18:16:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @Brasilmagic @GordonFBennett I can't do that. See, not all brown Latinos are the same and I didn't come here for handouts but opportunity and this country has been good to me so I won't follow that path of govt dependency.
961664768200380416 2018-02-08 18:15:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @Brasilmagic @GordonFBennett Well I know a few of those w healthcare who earn as much as I but declare little so they have almost free healthcare while I lost mine. Should I just okay along, declare peanuts and live off those fools who had to pay absurd premiums?
961664369934454784 2018-02-08 18:13:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BdaGovernment @MsMarieFerguson @WhatZitTooya93 Again, going to point of departure, domestic partnership is appropriate and in no way constitutes discrimination on the contrary is a reasonable accommodation.
961664046356402176 2018-02-08 18:12:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BdaGovernment @MsMarieFerguson @WhatZitTooya93 No necessarily. There r some people out there who have such preference and u r willing to "discriminate" against them. Point is that if we were to have all that all want that would be chaos.
961654548292079616 2018-02-08 17:34:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BdaGovernment @MsMarieFerguson @WhatZitTooya93 How about incest involving two consenting adults?
961651618524680193 2018-02-08 17:23:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @Brasilmagic @GordonFBennett Singling a party is disingenuous. Liberal DC establishment is the problem. Whether it's W or Obama they were both irresponsible.
961651269118185474 2018-02-08 17:21:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @Brasilmagic @GordonFBennett Well I lived through Obama's years and my experience is quite different than yours I guess.
961650933062078466 2018-02-08 17:20:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BdaGovernment @MsMarieFerguson @WhatZitTooya93 Some may and they would be wrong in thinking so. I can only speak as to my opinion on the issue and in that regard I don't think of myself being better or worse than gays in fact a comparison has never been part of my rationale.
961649058728370177 2018-02-08 17:12:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BdaGovernment @MsMarieFerguson @WhatZitTooya93 We shouldn't use the term "discrimination" so loosely. Just because polygamy is illegal doesn't mean society discriminates against them.
961648427041021952 2018-02-08 17:10:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BdaGovernment @MsMarieFerguson @WhatZitTooya93 First "legal" segregation appeared in Maryland in 1660 or so as the miscegenation laws following establishment of slavery.
961647816262156288 2018-02-08 17:08:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BdaGovernment @MsMarieFerguson @WhatZitTooya93 Not at all. Segregation laws, like it's predecessor laws I.E.  miscegenation laws, were based on the amoral concept that slaves were below non-slaves. There's no such consideration by majority of those who oppose gay-marriage.
961632809910767616 2018-02-08 16:08:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @erikfinman I worked my way through school. No debt. Hard? Yes. doable? Absolutely. There r other ways always.
961632439637602304 2018-02-08 16:06:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Brasilmagic People, Schumer and McConnell have been in DC during time debt went from being nominal to $20+ trillion. Problem is DC has grown and is killing us.
961631939013873665 2018-02-08 16:04:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @Brasilmagic @GordonFBennett Obama recovery? That would be in the science fiction section. Any moron can live on credit and Obama borrowed $9trillion for what?
961630302945849344 2018-02-08 15:58:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BdaGovernment @MsMarieFerguson @WhatZitTooya93 A properly drafted domestic partnership statute will be equal to rights under marriage so whole issue is used of term and nothing else.

I remember when 9 circuit held hearings and this question was never fully answered: what rights would u have in marriage that u don't have in similarly codified domestic partnership?

961578378196410368 2018-02-08 12:32:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TolliesPolys So all the racist and pejorative ranting is because they buckled PC propaganda and allow domestic partnership? Lovely tolerant people at work here 
961577881976655872 2018-02-08 12:30:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TheAdvocateMag What's shameful is the desire to impose lgbt agenda on all. In allowing domestic partnership Bermuda did the reasonable thing.
961575700586262529 2018-02-08 12:21:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BorisJohnson @RhonddaBryant @LazarGreen It's not about "deserving" but restoring millennia institution of marriage as a man and a woman. In giving domestic partnership status Bermuda showed.maturity lacking in most countries that buckled under PC propaganda.
961575262247890945 2018-02-08 12:19:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BdaGovernment @MsMarieFerguson How did it strip rights when it allows domestic partnership?
961575106823761925 2018-02-08 12:19:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HRC About time somebody showed common sense. Domestic partnership is reasonable so no human right has been taken away propaganda notwithstanding.
961574440621563904 2018-02-08 12:16:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Bloodworth Not all self-serving progress is true progress. Domestic partnership was the reasonable thing to do but PC pols gave in.
961573879226470400 2018-02-08 12:14:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @senthorun How so? It's not criminalized but rolled into domestic partnership restoring marriage to it's original meaning and intent.
961573475017207808 2018-02-08 12:12:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @chris_muther What ever happened to respecting wishes here? Is not like they criminalize it but simply did the logical thing: allow domestic partnership and not hijacking a millennia institution for a man and a woman.

Because it's an idiotic deal for America intended as a damper on our economy while China and others catch up. Screw that.

It explains, not codify, the social phenomenon in question. Our current system creates a chain of migration for mostly unskilled labor and technology requires us to bring skilled labor.....
960926527541170177 2018-02-06 17:21:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @WilDonnelly Semantics aside the fact is that current system has a backlog of mostly unskilled labor as technology makes us need skilled labor.

960923795950317570 2018-02-06 17:11:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @RepJudyChu We have a system that favors immigration of low skilled migrants while technology means less such labor needed.

959866279153807361 2018-02-03 19:08:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ParisHilton The corruption in DC when politicians use the state to spy on Americans for political reasons.
959859443046453249 2018-02-03 18:41:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> #blackpanther have to give it to Marvel: they spun BLM and racism into a marketing campaign ..... True end of bigotry will be when we don't have to emphasize anything, including a movie, for the skin color of its actors.
959858620337999880 2018-02-03 18:38:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TwitterMoments Now I know why I always had that quesy feeling everytime Tarantino would pop up in a movie: evil cane through. What a despicable man.
959851354159222784 2018-02-03 18:09:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @QuenTarantino reading Uma Thurman's stories of you and Weinstein abuse to her makes it clear why I always had a weird feeling whenever you'd pop on screen, evil cane through your face.
959845360729579526 2018-02-03 17:45:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenSanders What is does show is that Dems tried to DJT what they did to you: sabotage and undermine at all costs. How can you stand with such a group after they cheated you out of the nomination?
959835894927773696 2018-02-03 17:08:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @funder When the Clintons face justice then I would listen to your partisan lies.
959835697296244736 2018-02-03 17:07:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenWarren Russia has always tried to undermine us as we do to them. Diff is that now they found useful minions in libs whose hatred for a man is greater than love for country.
959835382081839104 2018-02-03 17:06:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FBI @tedlieu This is why I couldn't b a politician: u guys spin facts so much that I lose perspective, sense, and integrity. Politicians weaponizing govt agencies for political purpose is an attack to the core values that made America great. Shame on u all liars.
959702698038841344 2018-02-03 08:18:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NYTHealth Stop misleading. Illegal immigrants r the problem. There r plenty of legal immigrants that can legally come and do those jobs.
959702105882849280 2018-02-03 08:16:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @latimes What crisis? He has authority to do but shouldn't while pressing for a prompt resolution rather than dragged down investigation fitting Dems partisan goals.
959701688637624325 2018-02-03 08:14:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HuffPost Blame the messenger is passe. Those who weaponized govt for political purposes r the problem. Whatever party does this must pay.
959700403481923585 2018-02-03 08:09:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NeilDiamond September morning, that was the beginning of your music becoming part of my life. Got to see you in Miami and sign all those songs with thousands more. Thanks for the music and may God bless you.
959681769334345728 2018-02-02 06:55:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ProudResister @IanRowan2 I've seen when govt is used against people and flew the results of that. Politics aside we must demand that such institutions never go down that path.
959680307485200385 2018-02-02 06:49:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NeilDiamond I'm sure you heard it time and time again but thanks! Thanks for the music that reached thousands of miles away. I had the fortune on seeing you in Miami and got to sing those songs with you and thousands more. May God give you strength.
959593003877916674 2018-02-02 01:02:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ProudResister Free press? They paid and owned by  both parties. Judiciary? Still trust worthy but subject to lies like fake dossier. Keeping us safe? The leadership turned to political interests and should be cleansed and prosecuted.
959592415991681024 2018-02-02 01:00:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill Opposition research started by GOP establishment, dropped and picked up by Clinton. Why is McCain so obsessed w questioning dossier? Was he part of GOP establishment that ordered it to begin with?
959588526416330753 2018-02-02 00:45:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChelseaClinton Or maybe it's getting hotter around Clintons now that the memo shows corruption and misuse of power by lying to a Court?
959584493274353664 2018-02-02 00:29:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @speakout_april Protecting us by lying or misleading the court to obtain a warrant? We either stop this now or start getting used to a new name like United banana republic of America.
959584082316398593 2018-02-02 00:27:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HCSdotcom It's all about fraud upon the court or lack of candor to the court both of which are an attack the foundation of the rule of law. Anybody who cares about civil liberties and rights should be concerned about this

959533626131087360 2018-02-02 21:06:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MarkDice That's asking way too much.
959533545831260160 2018-02-02 21:06:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @funder So why aren't u remotely concerned about fraud upon the court to seek approval to spy for political purposes?
959533192297549827 2018-02-02 21:05:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @krassenstein Spinning the news? Most relevant question is how officials perpetrated fraud upon the court to use judicial resources for political purpose and that should worry us all no matter who does it.
959532650435371008 2018-02-02 21:03:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @funder So much frustration in that rant.....but seemingly for caring for America as much as being partisan. That's petty.

959502989764517888 2018-02-02 19:05:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KatuArkonada @alba_tv Obvio que su agenda izquierdista influye su escrito. La narrativa falaz de derecha, Centro, o izquierda no conduce a nada positivo. Trate de servir con la verdad y no con versiones propagandistas.
959496625386344448 2018-02-02 18:39:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AJentleson So Dems don't only care about elections? That creep Harry Reid trained u well.
959496232442920960 2018-02-02 18:38:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @maddow It says that some people in agencies acted for political reasons to impede a candidacy to the point of perpetrating fraud upon the court.  That's a crime.
959495897850707973 2018-02-02 18:37:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CillizzaCNN It's enough to worry us about politics influencing actions in DOJ and FBI. Who do these cretins think they r that they could promote or impede any candidate? Fraud upon the court is a crime.
959494891314335744 2018-02-02 18:33:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @timkaine That people at DOJ and FBI acted for political reasons and purpose should trouble us all. We don't need any agency making choices about who should r shouldn't b POTUS.
959493453381095425 2018-02-02 18:27:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenJohnMcCain Wonder if you would be saying the same if bureaucrats conspired against your election. Certain DOJ and FBI acted for political reasons and interests and that must be stopped immediately.
959436426747228163 2018-02-02 14:40:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @EricHolder How would u know that is is bogus? A leak? Or r u simply being the same old partisan hack u were as AG?
959417139445796865 2018-02-02 13:24:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @buddy_hell Well Pinochet set foundations upon which Chile's modern prosperity and democracy rest. He did what he had to do w leftist terrorists and abuses took place, for sure, but Chile is what it is today because of and not despite of his leadership then.

959397595964694528 2018-02-02 12:06:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris Absolutely. I did just that by working part-time. Know many others who did just that within the past decade. No need for freebies at taxpayers expense.

I was an accountant many moons ago for a couple of relatively wealthy people and know well how you can shift wealth to show your net worth lower than it is and Clinton foundation is a perfect vehicle to that.
959092133402734592 2018-02-01 15:52:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MarkCorallo1 @DanteB4u @NormEisen @BlueHenArt She declared her family was almost broke at the time they left office. Her words, not mine, to ABC's Diane Sawyer. Clintons tax returns show they earned about $214M since leaving office.

959085591228010499 2018-02-01 15:26:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MarkCorallo1 @DanteB4u @NormEisen @BlueHenArt I.E. should we be concerned when two bureaucrats express their desire to have an insurance policy to hamper Trump should he be elected POTUS? I don't know about u but that sounds terrible no matter who POTUS is or may be.

I should clarify that it's not all career bureaucrats who r corrupt but certainly many at the top seem to be.

No need to be condescending because we r all ultimately below the bottom of the totem pole as complete facts r hidden from us by corrupt political establishment at large.

All while Hillary was involved w parties that ended up making huge donations to the foundation? We should want corruption exposed no matter who or what party is involved.

958702827811065856 2018-01-31 14:05:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi No. I might be an immigrant and English is my second language but so understand the issue clearly: close family nucleus is one thing, sponsoring dozens of people for more distant family relationships is another.
958702429658337280 2018-01-31 14:04:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @TeamPelosi Another Kennedy? Another Clinton?  Talk about dynastic politics. And for stability I watched your meltdown in your own turn w Cuomo and frankly you seemed very unstable.
958701517984423938 2018-01-31 14:00:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi I watched the whole thing and the only divisive and stale parts involved your face filled with contempt and vitriol. It was a sign of why Dems r so out of touch w middle America.
958700838641455104 2018-01-31 13:57:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DailyCaller Her face shows why she needs to go. Dems need to rid themselves of her generation as they r today an obstacle not a path forward.
958679899736236034 2018-01-31 12:34:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TheBabyGuyNYC Man libs hold their whining for a long time..... that's justice Gorsuch for you. Any comments of Pelosi trying not to choke on her dentures? Or a Dracula looking Schumer? Or Tim Kaine looking like he had a horrible hangover? Or salivating Joey Kennedy?
958677614323011584 2018-01-31 12:25:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytimes Salivating Joe was theatrical and his speech was mostly regurgitated political cliches. He's not the future of Dems but simply and old political hack in a younger person body.
958674806559465478 2018-01-31 12:14:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JoyAnnReid @bradripka @lacymillerTX67 Nope. Just expressing my honest opinion. Run of the mill message by a young person doesn't equate change.
958565476774436864 2018-01-30 04:59:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JoyAnnReid @bradripka The bar has been set so low.....
958565101992316929 2018-01-30 04:58:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaquelCepeda Mexico and El Salvador problems r not comparable to NK.

958564587544236032 2018-01-30 04:56:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @pacelattin I don't think he claimed such. He did claim that drug cartels push their violent ways across the border and that is correct.
958564041265381376 2018-01-30 04:54:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RepLujanGrisham @FWD_us Good for her. She can either return to her country of birth and apply to immigrate or wait for Congress to do that which Obama did abusing his authority.
958562516325535744 2018-01-30 04:48:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> You stopped taking your meds?
958561338648858624 2018-01-30 04:43:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BradSherman heard your interview and even though English is my second language I understand POTUS message about immigration clearly.
958561054803537920 2018-01-30 04:42:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @dcexaminer Funny coming from an activist judge who is part of the crowd that triggered the current state of affairs.

958559056897200131 2018-01-30 04:34:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AdamParkhomenko Why don't Dems demand new leadership? Pelosi, Schumer, Bernie? Time to dust up that museum.
958558455450791936 2018-01-30 04:31:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @isteintraum Because it's there kinda like the Austin Powers scene with the mole.....btw, content sucked.
958557783615471616 2018-01-30 04:29:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sahluwal There's no ripping apart. The whole foreign family can leave together.
958557595555463170 2018-01-30 04:28:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MikeLevinCA No they're not otherwise they wouldn't be deportable. What happened? Depending on Latino votes for your seat?
958557376667377666 2018-01-30 04:27:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @erincohan Miss do you feel ok? So-marketing called Dreamers r foreigners. They r  citizens of other countries and u putting above actual Americans is troublesome.
958556845861457924 2018-01-30 04:25:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @EmTSuss Not quite. A blm response would be white lives matter too.
958556670560489472 2018-01-30 04:24:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TopherSpiro It's intentionally true. It's about time to put Americans first and not foreigners.
958556428444323840 2018-01-30 04:23:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @wokeluisa They do, don't they? I don't know of any human life that doesn't matter.
958556201389838337 2018-01-30 04:23:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Acosta Succinctly put: Americans are Dreamers too and our children's dreams should not be second to those of foreigners.
958554657311330304 2018-01-30 04:16:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Theonlyhonest unless u have been ruined by Dems liberal indoctrination, listen to immigrants like me who want immigration reform and support ending chain migration and putting our dreams ahead of those of foreigners.
958553264391360512 2018-01-30 04:11:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lredondo Quien vio JOH tirar el gatillo? Ya parents con El circo.
958552833078513667 2018-01-30 04:09:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @cnnbrk And political families coming into power without wealth and retiring as  millionaires is not right.
958551590666932224 2018-01-30 04:04:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @jonathanalter Energy? Grit? Idealism? He sounded like an old time politician with cliche response.
958551322189549569 2018-01-30 04:03:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SallyGlenn7 Other than being distracted by the saliva on the side of his mouth his response was dark and a downer.
958549601073672193 2018-01-30 03:56:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sarahivelazq Don't doubt it. There's enough ignorant voters out there otherwise how could we explain Obama being reelected.
958549290384797697 2018-01-30 03:55:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Kamgirl47 Is not that he's too young. He's just inexperienced and we enough of a mess with Obama's inexperience.
958548948142252035 2018-01-30 03:54:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @amahnke Other than I can't avoid seeing saliva on the side of his mouth he's delivering the same old baloney: abstract perennial words that deliver zero practical realities.
958548276814508032 2018-01-30 03:51:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill There's a Uncle Tom version of Latinos too....I guess she is a Tia tomasa
958548055313342464 2018-01-30 03:50:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mattyglesias I must be watching a diff clone because what I hear is the same old baloney from a Kennedy.
958523564210184192 2018-01-30 02:13:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ABCPolitics They r in mourning for the death of liberalism?
958522941855199232 2018-01-30 02:10:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CarmenYulinCruz @SenGillibrand Any movement on special counsel on Dems decades of running and ruining Puerto Rico?
958522705418113024 2018-01-30 02:09:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RepYvetteClarke Great another seat available for better use.
958522388475514880 2018-01-30 02:08:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AriFleischer Is not that it should be covered now but that, like most damaging stuff to libs, media didn't cover it then.
958489144270950401 2018-01-30 23:56:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Airbnb @abusybeeslife Thinks about this, do u think u would b in Austria hadn't the US saved Europe from the Nazis?
958488930369798145 2018-01-30 23:55:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Airbnb @abusybeeslife It's up to each county to take advantage of the good America has done. Look at Chile, it took the chance and it's a successful economy and democracy while other countries continue trapped in their self-created mess.
958488514592636931 2018-01-30 23:54:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Airbnb @abusybeeslife Problem is world's problems end up at America's doors. US didn't seek WWI, WWII, etc. But for US most Latin America would b worse off under marxist dictatorships.
958371941701873665 2018-01-30 16:10:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer Same reason Obama told Russians he could be more flexible after the election?
958360392069238784 2018-01-30 15:24:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CollinRugg They r all scared of a "fake" memo that is somehow damaging to America's real national security 
958359963503652866 2018-01-30 15:23:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TeamPelosi Leadership is doing what one must not what is political expedient. U guys r used to chameleons like Obama.
958359632132694017 2018-01-30 15:21:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nowthisnews How about making Congress sane again and retiring a bunch of senile partisans starting w Pelosi?
958358537406738432 2018-01-30 15:17:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChrisCuomo Watching Pelosi rant made me wonder about her mental health.
958357301022347264 2018-01-30 15:12:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JackPosobiec Why not? They wanted HRC to be POTUS.
958357050416926720 2018-01-30 15:11:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNN @ChrisCuomo @NancyPelosi I saw your talk and wonder why haven't you retired ma'am? You sound lost and without a clue.
958356318410149890 2018-01-30 15:08:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RyanAFournier Pelosi idea of bringing a dreamer was shot down when Ginsburg said she ain't  attending.
958356080513441792 2018-01-30 15:07:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JacobAWohl I guess all Hispanic names sound the same to her.....
958352710264377344 2018-01-30 14:54:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thenewmexican @MartinHeinrich Enough w the Dreamers marketing baloney. How about putting our American born childrens' interest over foreigners?
958352196642500609 2018-01-30 14:52:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RepMarkTakano More political whining to start the day.....
958350417330655234 2018-01-30 14:45:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @zupfer_cory There has to be white privilege when Moore's trash is rewarded w awards. Either that or indeed liberalism is a mental disorder.
958349308985782274 2018-01-30 14:40:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nowthisnews Simplistic idiocy. We all put our interest first and meet at points of compromise where we r in a win win  situation. This is what globalist demagogues play with.

958344289267929100 2018-01-30 14:20:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PreetBharara @maggieNYT Reminder: Obama pushed for executive overreaching while these minions stayed mum.
958343890268033024 2018-01-30 14:19:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @USATODAY @PreetBharara @GovCTW When Clintons r duly investigated and indicted for long history of crimes then I'll believe rule of law still matters. Political hacks have turned legal system into a mockery.

958319977651752960 2018-01-30 12:44:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Airbnb @maxringelheim Except that it shows tourist spots and not real s...holes made by centuries of social irresponsibility for which libs want US to pay for. Walls r not only to keep people out but to protect those inside.
958319542035472395 2018-01-30 12:42:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Airbnb Wonderful imagery of tourist destinations but not of corrupt societies real living which is why they leave those countries. Sorry about them but America is not the world's Savior and people must take their countries back.

957815861980647424 2018-01-28 03:21:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @UN @StateDept @TwitterMoments @romein0omatic Honduras is a battlefield between Venezuela narco socialism and US security interests.
957815633944743943 2018-01-28 03:20:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @UN @StateDept @TwitterMoments @romein0omatic No Honduras media. Heck no. Honduras journalists have zero credibility. Venezuela sponsors and funds libre. How much of the $ ends up in select hands?
957813544304693249 2018-01-28 03:11:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @UN @StateDept @TwitterMoments @romein0omatic Nasralla shifts with Mel's winds and his lack of character is contributing to the chaos being orquestrated from Venezuela.
957813107866394624 2018-01-28 03:10:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @UN @StateDept @TwitterMoments @romein0omatic I thought Nasralla was an option until he showed his poor judgment and excess pride when running PAC.  Joining Mel was the coup de grace  and has increasingly looked pathetic  and petty.

957790102134120449 2018-01-28 01:38:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @chefjoseandres @CafeMilanoDC Shouldn't you have waited before acting like a pampered pooch? Next time to allow the benefit of the doubt unless you intentionally seek to exploit incidents for publicity.
957789394727002112 2018-01-28 01:36:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tweettruth2me Funny how a woman turns against another woman when she displays an opposing view.....I thought women were more "tolerant"

957788606688526336 2018-01-28 01:32:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @UN @StateDept @TwitterMoments @romein0omatic The ones with blood on their hands are JOH, Mel, Nasralla. They all brought this mess over an already suffering people.
957787203949813761 2018-01-28 01:27:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @StateDept @TwitterMoments @romein0omatic There r gang members, leftist loons, and many other unsavory characters that infiltrated protests for nefarious purposes.
957786906795892736 2018-01-28 01:26:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AshleyMcKinless @ClarkeAtAmerica Last night. How about nights ago when many biz were burned down?
957786235761840132 2018-01-28 01:23:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @StateDept @TwitterMoments @romein0omatic The opposition has been infiltrated by gang members, operatives funded by foreign interests and r willing to kill to create martirs.

957734256532508672 2018-01-28 21:56:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @StateDept @TwitterMoments @romein0omatic Truth is that life had little respect down there and all sides r all too willing to kill for any reason.

957676741337731073 2018-01-28 18:08:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TUSK81 It's all chain migration. BTW, no problem sponsoring elder people if u will support them 100% which is not the case as most end up w Medicaid once they become citizens too without having contributed a penny.
957676355352702976 2018-01-28 18:06:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sairahussain87 Semantics aside fact is we need to switch to a merit based system. Why is Canada's healthcare so echoed by libs but not Canada's Mei based immigration system?
957676043644620803 2018-01-28 18:05:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TopherSpiro I'm a Latino immigrant and the only offensive thing is how snob libs pretend we r fools. Chain migration, family reunification, whatever u want to call it is outmoded. We need a merit based system going forward.
957675557940015104 2018-01-28 18:03:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChrisMurphyCT @KeithBarrett @DanielMosherNY No.they r meant to let us choose best qualified people to immigrate here.

Most points relate to education level and knowledge of official languages or Canada and need funds to support yourself upon arrival.
957674668357505029 2018-01-28 18:00:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChrisMurphyCT @WriteNThrive @jp_pete True. Funny how libs like to quote Canada re healthcare but not re their point based immigration system.
957674429064142848 2018-01-28 17:59:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChrisMurphyCT @jp_pete @WriteNThrive A merit based immigration system puts our national interests first. Automation will decrease need for low skilled labor so why let more low skilled labor immigrate here? I'm its plain dumb.

957671835008716802 2018-01-28 17:48:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @teammoulton Let's start w the truth: he didn't "immigrate" he either overstayed a Visa or entered without one in either case he was illegally here and benefited from delayed deportation due to the TEMPORARY protection status (to).

956555913254653962 2018-01-25 15:54:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @agolubowitsch Biggest problem is so-called "progressives" elitist and dismissive attitude towards those who have an opinion diff than theirs which results in "tolerance" being a one way street where libs voice is only one w merits.
956555349150052352 2018-01-25 15:52:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @agolubowitsch I as surprised at how many Latinos I know votes for DJT given his tone re illegal immigration. Majority not legal immigrants view illegal immigration as a problem affecting their pockets because illegals do work for less money.
956526425556901890 2018-01-25 13:57:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CoryBooker So simply because he didn't want to follow u down your opinion path u r astonished? Confirmation hearing is not a campaign stop so stick to the candidate's qualifications.

Reasons vary but for me as a highly educated urban minority it was simply reacting to extreme liberal policies of Obama and giving the finger to political establishment.
956484331006058496 2018-01-25 11:10:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @agolubowitsch Canada will have it's moment too as there is a breaking point in pushing extreme liberal agendas. Simply, Trump is the logical response to extremism of Obama.
956483918240329728 2018-01-25 11:08:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @agolubowitsch Reasons to vote DJT vary. For many it was equivalent to giving middle finger to political establishment that has failed us time and time again.
956483302063509504 2018-01-25 11:06:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @agolubowitsch Let's see, I'm a highly educated minority who voted for DJT for well-thought reasons.....I know many others just like me who voted like me.....somehow that premise seems faulty.

955217427054329856 2018-01-21 23:15:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @UNITEDWEDREAM @EdNDeb4858 Yes and those 900 deserve immediate resident status as many did during Vietnam. But how about the remaining 800+?
955124673599234048 2018-01-21 17:07:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy Ultimately my concern is what kind of America will my children inherit. I don't envision a tijuana on steroids.
955124471693742080 2018-01-21 17:06:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy Humane immigration doesn't require amnesty. Requires having a system that is beneficial not just to immigrants but to us Americans as well. Walking down little Havana, little Haiti, and other areas I see this is not the case right now.
955124117962985473 2018-01-21 17:05:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy There's a comment around immigration practitioners "immigration clients r the best clients because they can't sue u for malpractice" why? They get deported.
955123867495870465 2018-01-21 17:04:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy I have though about immigration reform for the past decade. I practiced immigration law for a while until I realized how corrupt it's and how lawyers swindle immigrants and often help commit fraud upon the US.
955123425172951040 2018-01-21 17:02:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy I'm not saying Latino and Blacks should be GOP cause God knows there's problems on the other side too but let's face it, what have Dems truly do for Blacks? I can tell u they've done squat for Latinos other than call on us come in election time.
955123030727917568 2018-01-21 17:00:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy BTW, if Dems truly cared about this they could've deal w it when they had a super majority in 2009 but chose not to do so. Why? IMO because Dems see illegals as political pawns just like they've seen Blacks fo decades.
955122696513343488 2018-01-21 16:59:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy As an immigrant who escaped that I fight the battle to preserve what made America the place of freedom which IMO runs contrary to turning a simple legal matter into emotional shenanigans.
955122376034930691 2018-01-21 16:58:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy I dont live by reacting to what ignorant racists might think of me. I live by my principles and terms. I value rule of law because I lived in it's absence where those w power were inmune.
955092248890433536 2018-01-21 14:58:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy Yes, we need immigrants but we need to change from family reunification to merit based and lock the darn border down.
955092028811087872 2018-01-21 14:57:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy We all need to inform ourselves away from propaganda from any side. Truth is exporting poverty is a way for corrupt countries to avoid resolving their failures. I.e. 25% of narco-state of Honduras' gdp is remittances. All while corruption flouishes.
955090408018792453 2018-01-21 14:51:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy One condition for DACA was registering for military service and when u do u can apply for permanent residence. But out of the close to 800k DACA people about 1% volunteered to military but double that had status cancelled due to crime r gang affiliations.
955089724410093568 2018-01-21 14:48:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy Then there's the truth obscured by the myth about DACA people: they r not all children as the age cut is 16 so almost half of them lived 40-50% of their lives in the country they r citizens of.
955086163383062528 2018-01-21 14:34:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy I can go on about how illegal immigration adversely affects wages, hospitals, etc all based on personal observations. BTW, most legal immigrants oppose illegal immigration because it hurts us the most.
955085711216205824 2018-01-21 14:32:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy Want to give free or subsidized education? give it to our kids first like the lovely African American girl at Walgreen's who has two jobs to put herself through college.
955085360421376000 2018-01-21 14:31:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy I feel bad for DACA people's plea and blame their irresponsible parents and our govt that has failed to enforce immigration laws for too long. But we should take care of our own people first, there's enough American born kids who need help.
955084863362818048 2018-01-21 14:29:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy I ended up chosing private schools because of poor public schooling and relocating from Miami as the whole scene decayed into a third world level.
955084585599160320 2018-01-21 14:28:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy Remember that I'm a Latino immigrant so this is not about race for me.its about principle. How does illegal immigration affect me? I pay hefty taxes for schools that r overburdened w illegals whose needs take away resources from our children's education. That's one example.

955071231237279750 2018-01-21 13:35:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris Yes protect Dreamers, those who r American and who have to indent themselves to get a degree while illegals get it for free or highly subsidized. America's children first.

954915364093251589 2018-01-20 03:15:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris How do politicians do it? I mean lie as if we were fools? This shutdown is on your party.

How about taking care of our AMERICAN children who must carry student debt while illegals get free or subsidized education?
954855587208138752 2018-01-20 23:18:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenatorDurbin Such hypocrisy is disgusting Mr. Durbin. Your party and some GOP beholden to Latino votes put foreigners over AMERICANS! You lack credibility sir. Period.

954821773186486274 2018-01-20 21:03:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy Question: why should children of illegals get free or subsidized education when American born kids.must get into heavy debt to go to college? Let's be humanitarian, not stupid. Let's take care of our own people first.
954821359850401792 2018-01-20 21:02:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @LightMirror1 @jackiecy I know about it quite well. The bottom line and undeniable truth is that they are foreigners otherwise they would have status at birth. While I sympathize w their plea bcause it's their parents fault not theirs, I think it's irresponsible to affect Americans for them.
954796928637730817 2018-01-20 19:25:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @jackiecy @LightMirror1 Is not about being a foreigner. It's about people overstaying or coming to country other hand theirs illegally.

949148382592815109 2018-01-04 05:19:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @dapperzookeeper @DCHomos @BriereBear I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I have friends who r homosexual and know my beliefs but also my respect for their choice of lifestyle which is not tantamount to my accepting it as moral normalcy.
949147929331171335 2018-01-04 05:17:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @dapperzookeeper @DCHomos @BriereBear On that basis half of America is homophobic? This is the problem w social discourse in that freedom of expression ends once so-called "progressives" have their say.
949147519052791808 2018-01-04 05:16:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @dapperzookeeper @DCHomos @BriereBear All I see is a person expressing his sincerely held beliefs. I can understand such beliefs would be offensive to a gay person but imputing ill or evil intent is rather arrogant.

946588637990400001 2017-12-28 03:48:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris Climate change is real. Climate changes but issue is whether or not we actually have an impact on such change. Libs will spend money without knowing this important answer.

No, not all Muslims are fanatics but most fanatical terror today comes from Islamic radicalization and to them globalization, co-operation are irrelevant.

946084810728058881 2017-12-27 18:26:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @fwconway Problem is u see him as a socialist sort of hero when he is not. He's a corrupt oligarch who turned to chavez for personal gain period.
946084526492708864 2017-12-27 18:25:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @fwconway Mel was a leftist since decades b4 and his impeachment resulted from his crazy antics.
946084192429006855 2017-12-27 18:23:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @fwconway Sir Mel was a liberal until he moved to chavez. His family is liberal with a former president zelaya having served before. Before him there was a left wing to the party that reached power w Carlos reina who introduced Mel to cabinet position.
946083565829328896 2017-12-27 18:21:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @fwconway I know how Wikipedia works. I contributed to it in the past as anyone can by creating account.  More important to me is that I actually know the Honduras constitution and others as studied comparative law and had to engage Honduran attorneys for legal matters there.

945985234620862464 2017-12-27 11:50:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @fwconway Now, physical removal of zelaya to Costa Rica was unconstitutional and a decision motivated to prevent him from becoming a martir as Venezuelan agents were suspected of having such plans.
945984784089706496 2017-12-27 11:48:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @fwconway "Available sources indicate that the judicial and legislative branches applied constitutional and statutory law in the case against President Zelaya in a manner that was ... in accordance with the Honduran legal system." Actual legal analysis not Wikipedia
945983734813163520 2017-12-27 11:44:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @fwconway Unfortunately Wikipedia is not a complete source of information. In 2009 Congress applied articles 205, 108, and 218 to justly remove him and art 242 placed the then president of Congress in his place.
945981332164882432 2017-12-27 11:34:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @fwconway It's facts. It's important to remember that it was zelaya own party, having control of court and Congress, that impeached him. He befriended Chavez only because he had burned through budget by September and foreign aid was curtailed because of corruption.
945804903833915392 2017-12-26 23:53:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @fwconway During JOHs govt there has been aggressive disruption or drug trade from Venezuela through, amongst others, Honduras. The cartels flourished under Mel's term. It's all about drug trafficking, money, not about the people.
945804372075843589 2017-12-26 23:51:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @fwconway 3. There's no brutal regime. What u see is gangs acting out violence in the streets to help the so-called opposition reach power. Why? That's the crox of this issue.....
945803814480867328 2017-12-26 23:49:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @fwconway 2. Obama and the OAS actually forced a deal to allow for his return to Honduras and pretty much gave him and his cronies immunity for over 3 years of unbridled corruption.
945803498402340865 2017-12-26 23:48:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @fwconway 1. There was no coup. He was impeached following his repeated violations of court injunctions. He also had failed to comply w constitutional mandates. The Congress and supreme Court removed him from power according to the Honduras constitution.

There is a US task group there but so r in Salvador, Curacao, and other locations in Latin America all for drug trafficking control operations.
945541063267274752 2017-12-25 06:25:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @fwconway I don't conceal it actually. Pretending not to know is not modesty. I know The country very well actually.

943089087698882561 2017-12-19 12:02:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I know enough about journalism to know it's rare to b found in a politically biased academia environment that spews propagandists w a journalism degree.

942805403909480449 2017-12-18 17:14:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Well my life's reality is as empirical to me as it can get. I'm not asking u to make it same to u but rather that u don't disregard it because it might be a lie. So far media had been filled w lies and propaganda but u seem open to it.
942762938183639041 2017-12-18 14:26:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I can present my case w no need to depend on articles. Why can't u do that? I can discuss specifics I know and have experienced. Why can't u? Its time to return to critical reasoning for all of our sakes.
942759720120668160 2017-12-18 14:13:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @CONSMILITIA @DoolingJohn It all depends on circumstances. Unlikely in today's America but who knows 50 yrs from now if govts continue ignoring the people. Anything is possible although u desirable. I'm more optimistic on this.
942759332818677761 2017-12-18 14:11:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @CONSMILITIA @DoolingJohn I don't buy the Montana model of militias, the fear of govt crowd at least not yet but must admit that Obama's overreaching was a warning to us all to return to balances of power.
942759017419599873 2017-12-18 14:10:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @CONSMILITIA @DoolingJohn Absolutely but u r assuming a war of citizenry against itself as military r also Americans.
942758730759843840 2017-12-18 14:09:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn So now I'm a troll? What's the purpose of allowing comments if not to comment? I don't understand why people r so sensitive to criticism. To me it suggests insecure foundations.
942753527834841088 2017-12-18 13:48:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @CONSMILITIA @DoolingJohn To ultimately prevail u need ground invasion and a citizenry armed is a nightmare scenario for any invader. That's the concept for whatever little disuassion power it may have today.
942750845543821313 2017-12-18 13:38:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Well if I lie I lie to myself. I'm not here to prove myself to anybody and I like the anonimity for personal reasons. U could b lying but too.

942745512112947200 2017-12-18 13:17:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I spoke w more than one such person. I believe in networking up and that's how I have met people there, here and other places. I don't base my opinion on 1 conversation alone.
942745055521013760 2017-12-18 13:15:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I'm all for mandatory service. I'm also for limiting types of firearms in private hands because I don't see need for semiautomatic unless u live in the boonies. I carry a 9mm w 9 rounds and if I need to fire more than twice in self-defense then I suck.
942744377335668736 2017-12-18 13:12:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I know but I refer to Trudeau in the cdn context of perennial political lies.
942744133902520320 2017-12-18 13:11:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Of course. The ndp is the true left up there. But can politicians r to the left of their American peers at large. Harper was like W, a moderate conservative unlike let's say Reagan. Even Mulroney was to the left of Reagan, it's Canada.

BTW, one of my brothers works w the police there too. Frankly I venture to say that I have more first hand  knowledge about Canada than u do about the US. Am I wrong? Have u lived here?

942742191000162304 2017-12-18 13:03:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Switzerland makes it mandatory to be trained and have a firearm. I'm ok w that. Fact is that for self defense a simple revolver would suffice if u know how to use it. A "well regulated militia" would come in handy.

942733007257038848 2017-12-18 12:27:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn By the first measure Switzerland should have even more fun violence but it doesn't. As for race issue it's black on black w Black uncle toms profiting by keeping Blacks in political dependency  plantations.
942732507589603328 2017-12-18 12:25:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Didn't say that. Said that vast majority r liberals who whine about gun violence while glorifying violence or talk climate change while flying their private jets. Their hypocrisy is obvious.

942438523700989952 2017-12-17 16:57:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn If u think u can just walk into a gun show and buy a gun w no background check then u have been reading liberal Kool aid. Only exemption to background check is a private sale which by definition can't b completely controlled. Like everything pols touch don't believe it all
942437651914903558 2017-12-17 16:53:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Yes and?
942437584965382146 2017-12-17 16:53:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Did I exempt them? Entire entertainment complex is guilty but "progressives" have creative control of most of it.
942412970553901056 2017-12-17 15:15:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I lived there for a decade or so. Have close relatives there. Married a Canadian who also has relatives there including a former MLA. Friends there? Research Christy Clark, yes that one.
942411606914412546 2017-12-17 15:10:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Background checks? Yes it is.
942384837423435776 2017-12-17 13:23:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GlennMcmillan14 Same way Obama got the Nobel prize at the onset of his presidency and many morons continue seeing him as a successful POTUS.....idiocy
942384510485848064 2017-12-17 13:22:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TheTorontoSun @BeenAround3 Well he's been dictating men's choice of socks perhaps.....
942383962277605377 2017-12-17 13:20:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn We have background checks here and I do have a permit. I'm all 4 that but distrust such reliance on govt.
942382494996983810 2017-12-17 13:14:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Wait until those repatriated cdns who fought w isis start going nuts.....then u can thank loonie bin trudeau
942382176619855872 2017-12-17 13:13:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn It's not a right? That's the problem up there. Govt gives it then govt can take it away.
942381977495273473 2017-12-17 13:12:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Of course u can but have u tried to get a carry permit? Read ch 20 of the firearms act.
942380844576059393 2017-12-17 13:07:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Of course. I don't watch Fox. One by one my favs were destroyed by propaganda.first CNN, then msnbc, fox, u name it.
942380502203486208 2017-12-17 13:06:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Well excuse me for not naming them as I don't think I have the right to do so. They don't like him BTW because his biz approach is to squeeze u. But that and other real perspectives  r better than empty analysis.
942380096933031936 2017-12-17 13:04:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Of course not all CDNs r trapped in liberal left lunacy but come on, Trudeau is Canada's Obama, he looks good,talks well but is leaving a message behind.
942379597680857088 2017-12-17 13:02:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn There's a glorification of violence in American society and oddly enough it's liberal entertainment that profited from merchandising violence, sexual exploitation, etc.
942379152396767232 2017-12-17 13:01:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn That being said, there r too many wackos who take gun ownership rights to crazy extremes. I don't see need r semis 4 self-defense unless zombie apocalypse expected.
942378784963129344 2017-12-17 12:59:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I remember once I called 911 once in Canadaqhen a junkie was banging at my door trying to pick up a fight  and the operator told me I had to call when I was under physical attack.  So forgive me for believing in my right to bear my 9mm......
942378131377344512 2017-12-17 12:57:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I never saw such controlled environment as I saw in Canada. media and govt in cahoots to preserve false reality.
942377502869217280 2017-12-17 12:54:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I guys voted out Harper only to put Trudeau who's putting u guys back in deficits and selling u pies in the sky as a populist while he sells u out to Corp interests.
942377180897726464 2017-12-17 12:53:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn U guys prefer US pols who fit the CDN center-left model(hence CDN luv 4 Obama) and have an uncomfortable perhaps even distrusting relationship w the behemoth south of your border.
942376689782480897 2017-12-17 12:51:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Nope. Just trying to understand your perspective. Having lived in Canada for a decade I know Canadians define themselves as not being Americans albeit u guys deny it. It's some sort of complex.
942376100537266177 2017-12-17 12:49:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn IE, I have friends who have done by w DJT Corp. Both in NY and S Florida. Their experiences w his biz is that he's a shrewd ruthless bizman. He's not an angel,I knew that yrs ago.
942375515595464704 2017-12-17 12:46:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Articles r opinion. I research 4 facts. Raw facts r better than regurgitated opinion.
942375301803323392 2017-12-17 12:45:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Where in Canada do u live? I have family there in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver. Went to university there.
942374930393583616 2017-12-17 12:44:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Btw, the name I gave u is for a Canadian.
942374760046039042 2017-12-17 12:43:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Just don't tell me drank empty suited Trudeau's Kool aid.
942374659848273920 2017-12-17 12:43:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I was in Vancouver last Christmas and when I used my BOA card at London drugs the clerk asked me if I was a new immigrant because of DJT winning. I saw so much propaganda about this that I understand why you have a clouded view of this.
942374285477335042 2017-12-17 12:41:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Was wondering why u came w Google Canada so much. Just realized u r in Canada. That explains your bias.
942373948393775105 2017-12-17 12:40:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Well that's the easiest thing to do right now ain't it? I can do more on your own time. Knowledge may b power but it doesn't come without work.
942373682135085056 2017-12-17 12:39:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Did u Google up the name? I should find a plethora of info about the relationship.
942373515809914880 2017-12-17 12:38:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Her and the other 8 committee members was required but Obama and HRC voice carried weight to move votes.again, why not investigate?
942372312380297216 2017-12-17 12:34:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Ok. Is his ego fragile? Nope. He's a strong sociopathic narcissist. U push he pushes back harder. Obama fits your narrative more because he is unable to decide without a choir of sycophants.
942371274940141574 2017-12-17 12:29:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn He funded $145M to foundation. Research his relationship to uranium one and more.
942370880319090688 2017-12-17 12:28:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Sources? Research name Frank Giustra and follow the trail.
942370088870608898 2017-12-17 12:25:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Have I denied DJTis narcissistic? No. He has to be to be where he's at. My point is that if this is a meritorious critique of him then it should be equally meritorious to most pols including Obama and HRC.
942369643137822721 2017-12-17 12:23:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Facts: millions poured from russian sources linked to Russian investors w interest in merger approval to Clinton foundation around time of negotiations, Bill got $500k for one speech in Russia. Did this influence HRCs vote and voice for the deal? We don't know. No investigation.
942368220090167297 2017-12-17 12:17:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Well he vastly outmanouvered Obama/HRC all over the world so what were they playing? Solitaire?
942367394248511488 2017-12-17 12:14:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I dunno. I can reason my conclusions which is not something people parroting networks can do so what conclusion do u question and why?
942366429294268416 2017-12-17 12:10:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Putin is more sophisticated than u think. He planned to have disent no matter who won. I think what we see if what he wanted and would have happened if HRC had won, to cripple our govt.
942365926841872384 2017-12-17 12:08:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn O don't know if it's funny or sad how people retweet your comment about Alex Jones despite fact I've never read his stuff. Doesn't truth matter anymore?
942365580233003008 2017-12-17 12:07:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Again. I don't know.we don't know. Remember Ollie North.
942365356324245505 2017-12-17 12:06:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I have a Panama hat collection if that counts  Seriously, I cut cable off more than a year ago. Too much junk. Too much propaganda on all sides. I research, study issues of interest and derive my own conclusions.
942359748774711296 2017-12-17 11:44:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Maybe, maybe not. Acting out of simplistic hate should b out of ours.
942359367277531136 2017-12-17 11:42:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn We don't know what he may have said as he had to declare at time deal was made.
942359170535362560 2017-12-17 11:41:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I've never read Alex Jones, Breitbart, and on even like cable news period. What peer reviews r u referring to?
942358697795301376 2017-12-17 11:39:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn We'll only know this if establishment stops sabotaging him which is partially his fault as he, unlike Reagan, doesn't seem to know how to switch off battle mode
942357301519929345 2017-12-17 11:34:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I just hope that if it turns out there was nothing that establishment vermin will have decency to admit it.....nah, asking too much from such rats
942356887714107392 2017-12-17 11:32:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Well I'm sure we can expect objective analysis from msnbc 
942356541692370944 2017-12-17 11:31:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn It's in the moment. Obama/Dems deep state is sabotaging DJT at every step of the way. It's happening b4 our eyes in real time. Putin couldn't b happier w outcome of his manipulation of lib media/pol establishment
942355969018875905 2017-12-17 11:29:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Hey if there's a crime then yes but thus far I heard lots of innuendo and no evidence against him colluding w Russia but there's plenty about Obama and HRC w uranium, foundation, Ukraine, etc but no pressure to investigate?
942355428444377088 2017-12-17 11:26:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mrmedina  not by a loooonf shot
942354657237766144 2017-12-17 11:23:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Well opinions r nice but the history is their to review as is.
942354458398380042 2017-12-17 11:23:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Another aspect of job market is need to refocus immigration policy so that we stop bringing unskilled labor. It's a complex issue made worse by politics as usual in DC
942354098426466304 2017-12-17 11:21:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Pensions make money by investing and investing creates jobs. Problem is many r being left out of new jobs cause lack of skills but there r many jobs unfilled.
942353421289574400 2017-12-17 11:18:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I live in the moment. Let DJT do his job and in 2020 we can judge the results. Sabotaging any POTUS is dumb as we r only during ourselves.
942353054392778753 2017-12-17 11:17:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn So, he borrowed money from his dad, made a fortune and is no self-made? Funny how lib media praised his biz acumen when he was a donor but detract it now he is GOP POTUS 
942352568373694464 2017-12-17 11:15:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Do you have pension? Most Americans do.
942352391894192130 2017-12-17 11:14:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Im jus looking at the facts as they happened. He backed an outsider in establishment Alabama, Moore was establishment until all crap about him came out so DJT supported him cause of the Senate vote. He had said initially hat Moore wouldnt win and was correct.
942351825826611200 2017-12-17 11:12:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn U got to admit that it takes chutzpah to believe in yourself to that point and frankly kudos to anyone who has such guile
942351220357959680 2017-12-17 11:10:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I have a friend who inherited a bank overseas and he had to work to deserve taking his dad's place at the helm when he died and has expanded the biz since.
942350829910192128 2017-12-17 11:08:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn He got s loan from his dad and had made his own fortune by time his dad passed. He increased it since and that is no small feat. Many lotto winners and up broke u know?
942350389877313536 2017-12-17 11:06:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn deep state committed to Obama and Dems sabotaging him on politics? fire them. I'd say the same if things were reverse. Election is over and bureaucrats r paid to work not to play politics.
942349594079498240 2017-12-17 11:03:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Legislation w establishment bipartisan cesspool fighting to keep their place at the trough? Not likely. I don't agree w 100% but he's undone lots of executive abuses of his predecessors. Markets r up, isis running, better scotus justices? Not bad
942348445687386112 2017-12-17 10:59:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Well if u refer to Alabama he didn't back establishment Moore initially and he ended up being right didn't he?
942348175309983744 2017-12-17 10:58:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I don't think I need to defend DJT, it's not my job or interest. I voted him because I could never vote for HRC knowing the Clintons 40 yrs true house or cards.
942347709490528257 2017-12-17 10:56:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I was pointing to the obvious: people heckle DJT for being what his predecessors were. Was Obama, W, or Clinton more polished or refined? Sure, but all r sociopaths, narcissistic, so DJT is just one more, perhaps a cruder version.....
942345205931442176 2017-12-17 10:46:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Good for him. Self-promoting is the tool or self-made success.
942344975873970177 2017-12-17 10:45:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn I expected loyalty from my employees. Not out of ego but simple common sense. If a person can't b loyal to me then go work for someone else. Don't confuse loyalty request w asking for blind fanatical following.
942344553826258944 2017-12-17 10:43:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Sir CEO and politicians r largely sociopaths, narcissistic, etc. Send more than others but that's a well-researched topic. I'd rather have a strong narcissist than a weakling one like Obama who was always insecure about deciding.
942342731434733569 2017-12-17 10:36:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Slate Ditto for Blacks becoming Muslims as Islam is the original slave trading enterprise that took many into slavery and traded them w Europe.
942342404253847553 2017-12-17 10:35:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Slate Just like they have for past half-century? Why do Blacks vote for party of KKK, segregation, and slavery? It's utter ignorance of history and foolishness.
942340156006305792 2017-12-17 10:26:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Now Obama was indeed a weakling who surrounded himself w sycophants and continues to do so.
942339935406821376 2017-12-17 10:25:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DoolingJohn Don't know the guy personally but he never seemed the kind of guy whose ego can b easily bruised.....
942339668758196224 2017-12-17 10:24:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill Well we've been laughing at cnn and rest of fake news circus so.....

942206379347103744 2017-12-16 01:34:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HeatherGies @areale21 @FueraJOHRata Pues el problema es que nasralla es un titere de Mel quien es a su vez un vendido a Venezuela.
942175997927022592 2017-12-16 23:33:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HeatherGies @areale21 @FueraJOHRata Pregunta? Son mas los que no quieren a Mel de nuevo o los que estan contra la reeleccion? Creo que list primeros son mas.
942169010061312001 2017-12-16 23:06:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HeatherGies @areale21 @FueraJOHRata Desafortunadamente el fraude y manipulacion electoral es la norma no la excepcion en Honduras. El verdadero pleito ahora es entre injerencia de Venezuela y USA en contra de la misma.

942022025589248000 2017-12-16 13:22:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @UCBerkeley So much baloney. No mention of alianza leader's corruption that saw hundreds of millions vanished and increased narco biz. This professor is lying or deluded by her bias. There's no good and bad here, they r both bad, terrible.
942021253602402305 2017-12-16 13:19:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @OhMyRachael There r results but alianza doesn't like them. Funny since Mel admitted to being elected w fraud back in his day.
942020937523908608 2017-12-16 13:17:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HeatherGies It's no different that Maduro who plays the proverbial harp while Venezuelans die. Why don't u report on Venezuela's influence in this crisis?
942020473935859712 2017-12-16 13:15:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HeatherGies @areale21 I don't like reelection but fact is there's a large segment who do want him and another one that doesn't want Venezuela's lackey Mel. So the crisis boils down to lesser of 2 evils for majority of people.
941718086457098242 2017-12-15 17:14:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Obamacare spent 2 hrs quoting insurance 4 a minor child: $230 w $7,300 deductible. Not best thoughts about Obamacare and it's disgraceful makers.
941680860268498944 2017-12-15 14:46:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @rickklein @ABCPolitics The fact that a badly tainted Moore still got so close only shows that Dems r still in bad shape
941680543116267520 2017-12-15 14:45:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNNPolitics Or just redirect it where it should go which is uranium 1 deal and more.....
941680345707106304 2017-12-15 14:44:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @politico And we should care because? This snow flake says anything to be in the news.
941487875408920583 2017-12-14 01:59:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JoaquinCastrotx Mine: 1. DNC will turn honest 2. Lib media will turn away from fake news, 3. HRC will retire & shut up. None will turn true.
941486340612300800 2017-12-14 01:53:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @jaketapper Absolutely as well as other sources masquerading as journalism i.e. cnn, msbc, etc.
941313592309186561 2017-12-14 14:27:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @maggieNYT Funny how fake journalists ignore real news to peddle tabloid trash like this. I guess tabloid fake news is today's Roman circus to keep masses dumbed down but it ain't working......
941313026942296064 2017-12-14 14:24:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JoyAnnReid "source" is hat the word fake news tellers like u  use to mean "made up?"
940988786871238656 2017-12-13 16:56:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Travon If that's the case why did blacks come out for Obama and Jones? This myth of voters suppression is just that, a myth to explain that more and more people don't vote cause they fell voting doesn't matter.
940988402656260096 2017-12-13 16:54:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JasonKander Let's face it, that Moore only lost by a small margin says a lot. I think it was more about Moore being an impossible candidate giving a win to Dems.
940568914953670656 2017-12-12 13:07:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RyanLizza what's that about not throwing rocks up when one has a glass roof? Karma is a bitch.....
940567983402995712 2017-12-12 13:04:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @funder If that means I recover the healthcare Obama and his minions stole from me then fo 4 it.
940567778448302080 2017-12-12 13:03:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @eugenegu How about fighting all racism including the racist xenophobic attitudes coming out of certain corners of the Asian community? Racism is not a white only problem doc, it's a stain to all of humanity.
940567328969936903 2017-12-12 13:01:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @eugenegu Alledged.
940561780232937472 2017-12-12 12:39:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Mediaite Rattled? Or ratted by the media rat Acosta?
940398962829381633 2017-12-11 01:52:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @jaketapper How about higher standard of integrity than the one fake news so-called journalists have shown  for some time now?
939968284417544192 2017-12-10 21:21:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ZachJCarter I wonder, did u condemned Venezuela's interventionism that led mr zelaya to abuse power, violate constitution and his impeachment?
939967937707995136 2017-12-10 21:19:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ZachJCarter Mr Carter, what dictator? He was elected and while most don't favor reelection he's sadly only choice left after Mr nasralla lent himself to be Venezuela's puppet.
939967335213010944 2017-12-10 21:17:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RightsAction As if govts before we're not corrupt and repressive  why do libs enjoy publishing fake news so much?
939881179045445633 2017-12-10 15:35:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BarackObama @BillClinton @SheriffClarke @FoxNews But only DJT had the cojones to walk the talk. About time.
939714418786652160 2017-12-09 04:32:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JoyAnnReid @RepKarenBass Quality"journalism?" That like calling tiny Tim a music master.
939634604423745536 2017-12-09 23:15:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytpolitics @rangers____fan Don't they all? Keep your plan? Keep your doctor? WMDs? I don't trust individuals, I trust our collective to remember what made this country the shinning city upon a hill.
939561324480221184 2017-12-09 18:24:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RoyNemer @StephonCFC @BarcAddicts That Messi is Barcas system?
939554460963139584 2017-12-09 17:56:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RoyNemer @StephonCFC @BarcAddicts That's why Argentina has won so many world cups w him.....
939554299817988099 2017-12-09 17:56:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RoyNemer Yes, even Messi knows he's overrated by his minions.
939549325268537345 2017-12-09 17:36:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytpolitics @rangers____fan I think issue is Trump doesn't pretend not being  what Obama, and most pols, are.
939538597115518976 2017-12-09 16:53:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @politico @ReverendFelcher Well his current and former wives seemed ok w that. I'm sure some women may find your or my mouth coming at them 4 whatever reasons they may have. Point is, enough w hate.
939531110266081280 2017-12-09 16:24:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nikkihaley I've been following u 4 a while and I see our future POTUS in the making.
939463512044244992 2017-12-09 11:55:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RepBera Congress is where this needs to be resolved.
939463181751279616 2017-12-09 11:54:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JeffFlake It's a sick system because career pols have poisoned it by looking out for themselves. DC swamp needs draining. Term limits now.
939301417768112129 2017-12-08 01:11:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenFranken bye bye.....one less swamp vermin.....
939301140495327233 2017-12-08 01:10:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytpolitics @rangers____fan Also, POTUS as uniter ended w Clinton's election and got worse since. It's like perpetual campaign to discredit and sabotage whomever POTUS is and I blame career pol crooks.
939300761846067201 2017-12-08 01:08:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytpolitics @rangers____fan But minority is usually the loudest and Trump haters like Obama haters b4 them r plainly annoying and ignorant. Yes, I disliked Obama's vision 4 America but didn't hate the guy. Fortunately common sense Americans r majority.
939289223601016833 2017-12-08 00:22:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SteveKingIA @waltshaub How many diverse people do harm over good? I'm an immigrant but support wholeheartedly the idea of being selective about who comes in.  Family reunification based immigration is disastrous. Merit based is a better path.
939288620971778049 2017-12-08 00:20:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SteveKingIA Well that might be the case sometimes. Issue is who is absorbing who.
939288282088734725 2017-12-08 00:19:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytpolitics @rangers____fan Because hating only diminishes the one doing the hating. 2/2
939288137246928897 2017-12-08 00:18:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytpolitics @rangers____fan So be it but I wouldn't dishonor those being honored just because of a third-party possibly saying something I might consider dumb or even offensive. Let's face it, there is a hate Trump crowd out there who r obsessed w their hatred and it's wrong 1/2
939233617527689216 2017-12-08 20:41:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DEADLINE Well I see a hood project with cussing every minute as such is Tarantino's trash record.
939233306792652802 2017-12-08 20:40:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @StopTaxCheats @Photo2c @Laqobs @Tru_Blu_Patriot Agreed. Funny how things went down hill since the 60s and replacing of external moral values for humanist relativism.
939232936783695874 2017-12-08 20:39:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Fuctupmind @Tru_Blu_Patriot I see a judge shopping for a hook to hang his coat. It happens all the time. The reading is not about 10 amendment per se but improper authority as Congress, not POTUS, has the authority to earmark funds w conditions.
939232178365444098 2017-12-08 20:36:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Fuctupmind @Tru_Blu_Patriot So just how does Kate's law affects this?
939231992935342080 2017-12-08 20:35:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytpolitics @rangers____fan Of that's true even worse for them. One must learn and know how to be in the middle of it without reaking of it.
939109000091787264 2017-12-08 12:26:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @chelseahandler Why didn't u whine as loudly about Hollywood sex predators? Was it inconvenient to your career?
939108631114600449 2017-12-08 12:25:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @chelseahandler Stick to so-called comedy cause your ignorance of facts is palpable

939108072420773891 2017-12-08 12:23:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @chelseahandler I guess karma may just be a femine
939107956892815360 2017-12-08 12:22:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GovMikeHuckabee @chelseahandler Who raised u so hateful and idiotic?

939106331620986880 2017-12-08 12:16:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Fuctupmind @Tru_Blu_Patriot Just curious, how does 10 amendment makes Kate's law unconstitutional?
938964166546743296 2017-12-07 02:51:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytpolitics @rangers____fan They were civil rights heroes but traded their mantle for a second at the table of corruption.

938952614938660869 2017-12-07 02:05:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytpolitics @sherr_windy Why is he racist for questioning if Barry was born in US or not? Were the ones who made same question about Romney Sr, McCain, or Ted Cruz racist too?
938859308661596161 2017-12-07 19:54:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytimes @cindy_louwho @livin_2point0 Read Powell's own response to the attempt to compare his and HRCs email issue. He didn't act criminally negligent as HRC did.
938816583186739201 2017-12-07 17:04:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DineshDSouza Because the establishment controls the deep state. Dem/GOP establishment r showing us that there is only one party for them: themselves.
938815744145543175 2017-12-07 17:01:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNNPolitics Yet another idiot. Isn't that assault? Lovely how lib loons see their violence as a good thing.
938811761406480384 2017-12-07 16:45:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @chrissymacCNN @lindseyvonn @cnni @cnnsport @demon23ro @mnavarro918 Only because of CA & NY where entitlement has secured votes while destroying the economy. Time will pass those states the bill then we'll see.
938811414302658561 2017-12-07 16:44:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @chrissymacCNN @lindseyvonn @cnni @cnnsport @demon23ro @mnavarro918 And EC is how we elect POTUS since founding precisely to prevent populous states from controlling us all like happens in Canada. Thanks to this loonie toon CA can't impose on us crooked HRC.
938810409183862786 2017-12-07 16:40:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytimes @cindy_louwho @livin_2point0 This cliche that all who dislike Obama r bigots is tiresome. I don't care about race but do care about him being a crook liar who made bad things worse.
938809601553772546 2017-12-07 16:37:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytimes @cindy_louwho @livin_2point0 Funny how I long admired & respected Colin Powell so I guess my "bigotry" was selective?
938809177023090688 2017-12-07 16:35:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytimes @cindy_louwho @livin_2point0 I never thought I would see a worse POTUS than Jimmy Carter but I was wrong, Obama makes Carter look far less a failure
938808900471721986 2017-12-07 16:34:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytimes @cindy_louwho @livin_2point0 Bush/Obama r 2 sides of same problem: establishment career pols who care more about their pockets than u or me.
938621612773068800 2017-12-06 04:10:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytimes @cindy_louwho @livin_2point0 And as for healing, Obama has been most divisive POTUS up to DJT
938621326801231872 2017-12-06 04:08:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MorrisMedici Fortunately in US POTUS is not a monarch and needs Congress to engage us in such a way.
938620938345762816 2017-12-06 04:07:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytimes @cindy_louwho @livin_2point0 Obama handed us double debt and chaos overseas. History will likely judge him as mediocre POTUS, likeable as a person but mediocre as leader
938402355090993152 2017-12-06 13:38:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Slate @MorrisMedici Btw, I'm not his supporters or detractor.
938402153772838917 2017-12-06 13:38:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MorrisMedici Not saying that is a possibility but there r others    like him having a method behind his madness. Truth is we don't know the guy so we can speculate but let's not pass speculation for irrefutable conclusion.
938394126680297474 2017-12-06 13:06:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytimes @cindy_louwho Ask Obama he could answer that one
938393969737773056 2017-12-06 13:05:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytimes @LisaRGaffney Why? By implementing that which Senate approved 20 yrs ago? By doing what we should have done a long time ago instead of cowering to fanatics?
938393659199967232 2017-12-06 13:04:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytimes Saudi Arabia is dangerous w it's funding of wahabi extremism.

938391822568738816 2017-12-06 12:56:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Slate @MorrisMedici Nothing like mind readers wannabe to tell us what others true motives r.....
938391550161248257 2017-12-06 12:55:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Slate But it's the right and long overdue decision.

938377263116144640 2017-12-06 11:59:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill Well any idiot can survive on credit cards and Barry had us survive on borrowing $8 trillion? The only accomplishment is how this snake oil salesmen conned so many even now.
938376805718863872 2017-12-06 11:57:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JeffFlake They didn't, they tried to burn Moore but the only ones who matter, the people of Alabama, don't seem to care for your or our opinions.
938376561258106881 2017-12-06 11:56:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JeffFlake I can see how it was not "diplomatic" but the statement is not that farfetched.
938376098957660160 2017-12-06 11:54:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MittRomney @JeffFlake @AllisonRFloyd We wouldn't have DJT without Obama. See, DJT is Obama's only lasting legacy, the inevitable swing I the opposite extreme the Obama-Pelosi-Reid extremist coalition took us to.
938375659952406530 2017-12-06 11:52:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MittRomney @JeffFlake I thought it's for the people of Alabama to decide who they want but I guess establishment vermin have an issue w their cestpool being drained.

938374475942449153 2017-12-06 11:48:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @jperlow It's a long delayed move and the right move no matter what the administration happens to be.
938045969807151106 2017-12-05 14:02:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ricky710_ Good recap except it's missing the other side of same dark coin: nasralla is backed by Mel who is committed to delivering Honduras to Venezuela's sphere of influence and whose govt saw a spike I'm violence, corruption, and drug trafficking.
938045056111521794 2017-12-05 13:59:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AnaJurka Deberial Mel estar preso tambien por que el tambien burlo la constitucion?
938040648833339394 2017-12-05 13:41:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KurtHackbarth What coup? It was an impeachment of a president who violated constitution and defied court orders. I'm against JOH or anybody's re-election but frankly Venezuela is behind nasralla alianza.

938025949379137536 2017-12-05 12:43:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Newsweek No surprise there. How else could we understand their idiotic re-election of Merkel who is letting in their demise by opening doors to those who hate them?

937862198998728705 2017-12-04 01:52:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KateKedley Notice how governing party overwhelmingly won Congress and mayoral races. It's only presidential vote that is close. Had governing party ran someone other than JOH we wouldn't see this mess.
937861772920459266 2017-12-04 01:50:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KateKedley We r but we have diff context as to why. Ultimately, given options given, I'd rather see him than nasralla who would be another puppet of Venezuela.
937848996453928960 2017-12-04 00:59:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KateKedley It wasn't a coup. It was a crude impeachment process cause a clearly outlined one was not in the Constitution. I am against re-elections down south because I don't believe these countries r ready to avoid pitfalls.
937809824766660615 2017-12-04 22:24:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TheLibWay Such a bs argument. Honduras has guns all over the place.
937808936664813568 2017-12-04 22:20:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KhaledBeydoun Wanting to protect ourselves from extremists is not islamophobia.
937808237335900160 2017-12-04 22:18:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KateKedley See my point is that u and I had benefit of forming our own opinion but today's educators r often into indoctrinating.
937807803011534849 2017-12-04 22:16:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KateKedley Well why fuera JOH? Why yes to nasralla? Do u truly know that which u r teaching? And I ask this respectfully.
937795881071411200 2017-12-04 21:28:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KateKedley It's an easy cliche to blame US 4 everything and talk about American imperialism while ignoring Soviet ideological imperialism back in the day.
937795551034298368 2017-12-04 21:27:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KateKedley I fully understand both. I know the good, bad, and ugly sides of historical relationship between US and Latin America.

937760534979665920 2017-12-04 19:08:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KateKedley Or is it yet another disingenuous liberal gringo notion w no understanding of reality, albeit a sad one, of what's truly behind it all down there?
937760263268438016 2017-12-04 19:07:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KateKedley So, r they Honduran?

937759922170859520 2017-12-04 19:06:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @morrisjane53 It's happening because leftist candidate sponsored by Venezuela wants to profit from chaos.
937753350812160000 2017-12-04 18:39:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thunderbrds Don't misunderstand my comment as supporting JOHs illegal re-election. I'm simply stating that Venezuela is using this as a path to promote it's lackeys in Honduras.
937752988436877312 2017-12-04 18:38:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thunderbrds I'm very well informed about the particulars in Honduras. Don't need to quote media to tell u that this is all Venezuela bs.
937393658604769285 2017-12-03 18:50:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenSanders I look back at when u and the gang of Robin hoods robbed me of my healthcare insurance with AHA fraud.

937168797894692864 2017-12-02 03:57:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Problem is looters and vandalism.
937168639173767168 2017-12-02 03:56:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> R elections 100% clean? Never had been. Even Zelaya acknowledged this as part of his election back in the day. Nationalist party won big in Congress and mayoral races. Only issue is most people r against re-election per se.
937168118748712960 2017-12-02 03:54:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> All propaganda. Zelayas mismanagement led to budget crisis and he suddenly turned left to get $ from Venezuela. Congress and supreme Court sacked because he committed crimes that warranted his removal.
937167540706570240 2017-12-02 03:52:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> How is it the US fault? Venezuela has been funding the opposition since 2009. U need to get better informed.

937103266755772418 2017-12-02 23:36:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @michaelkelly68 More context: both Zelaya then and Zelaya now is funded and supported by Venezuela. Chavez then, Maduro now.

936199907496681472 2017-11-30 11:47:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @washingtonpost Democracy was undermined when Zelaya created a crisis in 2009. JOH re-election is direct result of international imposition of changes to allow Zelaya to return to politics. Simply, JOH used Zelayas tools to be re-elected.
936198984573636608 2017-11-30 11:43:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @janschakowsky @JakobJohnston The representative was playing the Venezuelan propaganda that has tried again to put one of their puppets in power in Honduras. Incumbent party won majority in Congress and mayoral races,huge majorities. President won re-election by thin margin.

936047266737115137 2017-11-29 01:40:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @shannongsims How so? Incumbent party won most seats in Congress and mayoral races as well.

Libs took control of academia and what passes for education today is indoctrination or propaganda. We were fortunate to be taught multiple sides of issues and left to decide on our own something that younger people don't have.

926803685589610496 2017-11-04 13:29:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DevonRowcliffe They r ok w rule of law. What separatists did in Catalonia couldn't end any other way. They broke the law.

926239940949757952 2017-11-02 00:09:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @jamesutterson So applying criminal law to criminals takes away from democracy?

926112303325564928 2017-11-02 15:42:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @AliciaHerrehamn IMO Spain as a whole is a mess and we can trace Latin American chaos to the culture of the conquistadores.
926112011704045568 2017-11-02 15:41:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @AliciaHerrehamn I don't care 4 Madrid, Rajoy, or any nonsense theories about reptilians and satanists. Im strictly trying to discuss facts not fiction.
926111722007617536 2017-11-02 15:40:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @AliciaHerrehamn Believe me Spain has a huge debt from colonial genocide but do u know that there r Catalan conquistadores too?

926110443839553536 2017-11-02 15:35:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenDuckworth @votevets @_GuardianAngel8 Now could Bush have done more? Absolutely so he's not 100% free of blame but Dems gave us this monster when Clintons deal enacted.
926110220274855941 2017-11-02 15:34:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenDuckworth @votevets @_GuardianAngel8 Well if u look into it he out some pressure on NK whereas Bill Clinton signed agreement that enabled NK and Obama did diddly squat about it
926109939159982081 2017-11-02 15:33:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @AliciaHerrehamn I'll wait 4 a response to my factual questions so we can discuss facts not emotions if y want of course if not, be blessed.
926109651162279936 2017-11-02 15:32:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @AliciaHerrehamn I'm an individual human being and w or without name have right to opine as u do.
926108910221758467 2017-11-02 15:29:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @AliciaHerrehamn Let's discuss facts not emotions knowing that when the time comes all of this will be irrelevant to God.
926104945472016385 2017-11-02 15:13:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @AliciaHerrehamn Trying to diminish my arguments w as hominem attacks only show u just may b unable to properly support your arguments.
926104766710800386 2017-11-02 15:12:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @AliciaHerrehamn Alice is esta siendo emocional y subjetiva. I have no horse in that race. I ask u again, do u know Spain's Constitution?
926104412866662401 2017-11-02 15:11:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @Carles69203160 @AliciaHerrehamn All r emotional arguments that will lead nowhere in practical terms.

926104111048810496 2017-11-02 15:10:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @Carles69203160 @AliciaHerrehamn Former Catalonia govt reported that 90% of 42% who voted approved Independence. So, about 30% support Independence.
926103783435841537 2017-11-02 15:08:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @Carles69203160 @AliciaHerrehamn All irrelevant. If vast majority of people in Catalonia wanted Independence but they don't. Strict separatists r a minority. That's the fact
926099019662872576 2017-11-02 14:49:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kylegriffin1 @JeanneM_Miller Well there's always a bumbling prosecutor or see how OJ got away w murder. But this one would take a moron to lose at trial.
926098656675221509 2017-11-02 14:48:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @AliciaHerrehamn @Carles69203160 Very similar situations where autonomy within a federation has made a diff. Breaking up Spain will only leave two diminished countries.
926097906423205891 2017-11-02 14:45:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mattgaetz @FoxBusiness That's fair. High tax states should face their voters instead of the rest of us subsidizing them.
926097446173855744 2017-11-02 14:43:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AlexSteinman It takes a deviant mind to play deviants as well as he has.
926097057030594560 2017-11-02 14:41:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @AliciaHerrehamn Well what I see so far is raw emotionalism devoid of cool headed analysis.
926096827073613824 2017-11-02 14:41:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @AliciaHerrehamn @HtServadac What about NK?
926096742185086976 2017-11-02 14:40:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kylegriffin1 @JeanneM_Miller He won't he can't. A defense lawyer will try but this guy is going to prison for life.
926096529940799488 2017-11-02 14:39:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @AliciaHerrehamn So u can testify as to persecution and oppression in Catalonia or simply hold colonial grudge against Spain?
926096290722795520 2017-11-02 14:38:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @AliciaHerrehamn @Carles69203160 I look at Canada experience w Quebec, hard road but worth pursuing where vast majority doesn't support independence.
926095357875978240 2017-11-02 14:35:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @AliciaHerrehamn Constitutional court found referendum unconstitutional but separatists ignored court decision which is yet another crime.
926094984025182208 2017-11-02 14:33:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @AliciaHerrehamn Alice, do u know the Spanish Constitution? Which was adopted by all regions including Catalonia?
926074595337277441 2017-11-02 13:12:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kylegriffin1 @JeanneM_Miller Why? Freedom of expression doesn't stop with being elected. Most of us would support death penalty for that terrorist.
926074357566328832 2017-11-02 13:11:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kylegriffin1 That terrorist does deserve death penalty. Rabid dogs should be put down.
926074139680694272 2017-11-02 13:10:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kylegriffin1 So it revealed Barack as a lying weasel?
926073732753485824 2017-11-02 13:09:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @AliciaHerrehamn Really? I've been to Cuba, Venezuela and Spain. Have Basque roots, family in Catalonia, and strongly disagree with your assessment.
926073183467462661 2017-11-02 13:07:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @AliciaHerrehamn Fact is majority of Catalonia want more autonomy not Independence. Minority parties formed govt and went too far. That was wrong.
926072983629778944 2017-11-02 13:06:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CataloniaHelp2 @AliciaHerrehamn I see the truth. Spain is not Sudan. Let's not fall prey to demagogery and propaganda from either side.
926050124354158598 2017-11-02 11:35:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CandiceMalcolm A fake superhero a fake prime minister so fitting
926047869936783362 2017-11-02 11:26:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @MrTommyCampbell Insane gun laws? Insane people r the problem. & Re NK what do u propose? Let them develop a missile that can reach us?
926047546702811136 2017-11-02 11:25:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenDuckworth Thousands. How many would die if NK launches a nuke or EMP? Dems allowed this monster to grow so own it.
926047231513366529 2017-11-02 11:23:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PeterGrantMP That's such an idiotic statement  Perhaps a vacation to NK would educate u.
926046973488230400 2017-11-02 11:22:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenDuckworth @votevets She should know. We all know it won't be pretty as no war is but allowing NK the way 20yrs of DC establishment has is insane.
926044023269273600 2017-11-02 11:11:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GeorgeKerevan @AliciaCaste33 Dictatorial? Catalonia govt abused power and restoring law is dictatorial?

926041695040438272 2017-11-02 11:01:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HurdOnTheHill @Rosa360 U miss the point. Russia collusion fake story designed to bring distrust. Putin played Dems and media like puppets.
926041479029706752 2017-11-02 11:01:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HurdOnTheHill Which is what Russia wants. Dems, fake news, played perfectly into Putin's game.

925311127751454720 2017-10-31 10:38:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TIME @FreedomAirplane Worth remembering that characters evoke Clintons lust for power and corruption.

925040307506483200 2017-10-30 16:42:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lizcastro No, it simply kept it's promise to restore law, order, and democracy. Puigdemont ran away after making a mess for pure ego.

924794407915843585 2017-10-29 00:25:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SCOTSANGEL1 Then I must wonder what part u went to. Like any town there r good, so-so, and bad areas.
924668579534041089 2017-10-29 16:05:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SCOTSANGEL1 Like everyplace u can live in a bad or good place. Depends on u. I live in a very nice area.

924629406752100353 2017-10-29 13:30:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tradasro @gdog2010_john The authoritarian law being the Constitution u originally voted to adhere to? How is that fair to other regions who respect the deal?
924629075502731265 2017-10-29 13:28:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tradasro @gdog2010_john I understand some who might share independence views in Scotland would view Catalonias events w friendly eyes but b careful of blind support
924628710493442048 2017-10-29 13:27:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tradasro @gdog2010_john Did u know that referendum law approval violated Catalonias own legal norms and rights of opposition? There's more to it .
924626632907853825 2017-10-29 13:19:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tradasro @gdog2010_john No they're not. Nazism is illegal, banned in Germany. That fits your definition of repression.
924626052500115457 2017-10-29 13:16:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tradasro @gdog2010_john Do u really need to ask me? Lawful must b moral if not it's wrong law. Only inmoral thing in Catalonia is desire to break 1978 agreement.
924625293012275200 2017-10-29 13:13:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tradasro @gdog2010_john In your view neo-nazis r repressed in Germany cause nazism is illegal so, r y ready to defend their right to vote Nazi ideas back into power
924625041588932608 2017-10-29 13:12:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tradasro @gdog2010_john When u vote a lawful democratic vote Yes.

924624549387341825 2017-10-29 13:10:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tradasro @gdog2010_john I've asked pro-independence cats how they r repressed and still wait 4 answer.
924624297875910656 2017-10-29 13:09:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tradasro @gdog2010_john U used the key word "repressive" which triggers moral imperative to fight it. But 1978 Constitution approve by all is not reppresive.
924621137514061825 2017-10-29 12:57:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tradasro @gdog2010_john When you vote to establish a law and then decide to break it is uncivilised and unprincipled.

924620477846433792 2017-10-29 12:54:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tradasro @gdog2010_john Not proper comparison. Right to vote is not same as right to break your own commitment while hurting those who relied on it.

924620018620485632 2017-10-29 12:52:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tradasro @gdog2010_john It was resolved in1978 and puigdemont only caused it to be out to rest permanently.

924619364099338240 2017-10-29 12:50:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tradasro @gdog2010_john Yes it can and has consistently been proven. Majority might want greater autonomy but not leaving Spain.

924616235597422593 2017-10-29 12:37:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tradasro @gdog2010_john Constitution doesn't contemplate secession. Catalonia is not only unique region in Spain & Constitution gave autonomy to the regions.

924610890871263232 2017-10-29 12:16:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tradasro @gdog2010_john Btw, minority of about 34% catalonians support Independence so no all Catalonia is playing this game
924610626973872128 2017-10-29 12:15:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tradasro @gdog2010_john Spain is a prosperous country and such moves hurt all
924610501799182336 2017-10-29 12:14:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tradasro @gdog2010_john That other regions don't want to waste time in playing separatists minority game is understandable.

Puigdemont went too far in this farce.
924602676821848066 2017-10-29 11:43:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ramontremosa @tonialba @martarovira @quimforn @raulromeva @ClaraPonsati @txellborras @jorditurull @junqueras @OttoOzols @ratasjuri @elgatnegre007 U mean when Catalonia pledged to the habsburg in a rebellion and when bourbons won Catalonia ended up being folded in place?
924601844722225153 2017-10-29 11:40:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mmay3r Very rare that a criminal peacefully surrenders
924601504744472576 2017-10-29 11:39:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MrMalky 90% of 40% is not a majority by far.
924600717331058688 2017-10-29 11:36:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tradasro Because such referendum is unconstitutional. Amending Constitution is a prerequisite.
924600043323248640 2017-10-29 11:33:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BjCruickshank Terrible comparison w a kingdom that joined another voluntarily in the 14 century.
924598859657089024 2017-10-29 11:28:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenatorCantwell No it means we Floridians don't subsidize you and voters should demand lower state taxes.
924598553611264000 2017-10-29 11:27:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenatorCantwell Why should taxpayers in lower taxed states subsidize you? About time your voters face reality.
924481920070836224 2017-10-28 03:44:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @josepcverges Funny since same nativist nationalism was bed of nazism.
924481348504571904 2017-10-28 03:41:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AngusMacNeilSNP Except Catalonia is not and independent neighbor.

924437745237417984 2017-10-28 00:48:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @RixxGnR @Francescfrcs @R_of_R Catalan separatists like Quebec claim their land is not divisible but Spain and Canada are. Hypocritical to the extreme.
924437545303371777 2017-10-28 00:47:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @RixxGnR @Francescfrcs @R_of_R Look at the Aran valley community in Catalonia, they already stated they will secede from Catalonia to stay in Spain.
924437103307575297 2017-10-28 00:45:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @RixxGnR @Francescfrcs @R_of_R Yes a minority of nationalists just like Quebec but should minority impose on majority?
924436841872445440 2017-10-28 00:44:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @RixxGnR @R_of_R @Francescfrcs It's a long history. More discrimination than racist but ethnic nationalism at its core.

924419796099313665 2017-10-28 23:37:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @Francescfrcs @RixxGnR @R_of_R Secessionists in Catalonia work on a nationalist premise that has deep discriminatory and racist undertones. Not all is what it looks to be

924330504924618753 2017-10-28 17:42:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HuffPost Even cats look tougher back then.
924330348397375488 2017-10-28 17:41:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill And yet no evidence of it while evidence mounts about Clintons, Russia, Ukraine & Obama officials corruption/collusion?
924330068838617088 2017-10-28 17:40:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill How? By daring suggest Clintons should be subject to same scrutiny over clearly questionable deals?
924303161988435968 2017-10-28 15:53:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Marcuzno1 They don't look any diff to b hardcore in their separatist ideology.
924277781919395840 2017-10-28 14:12:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @catalannews Now he calls for democracy after he trampled over it?
924254456878960640 2017-10-28 12:40:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R @Francescfrcs @RixxGnR Such a referendum would first require a constitutional amendment to allow one which not likely to pass. Catalonia agreed to Constitution
924234149996752896 2017-10-28 11:19:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Really? Evidence of pay to play is clear. $115M to Clintons from 9 shareholders of Corp buying uranium. How much Russian $ went to Trump?
924233514366783488 2017-10-28 11:16:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kurteichenwald Context? Unlike Bush2 Reagan's deficit was purposeful to defeat USSR. Obama was a clown who achieved nothing but debt and world chaos.
924232945644265473 2017-10-28 11:14:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HillaryClinton @impeach_d_trump So not being willing to fleece us working class to fund libs vote buying schemes is not being compassionate?
924232191936262144 2017-10-28 11:11:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KRLS That's why you flip flopped on snap election? You bit more than you could chew and now reap consequences of arrogance.
924231323107168257 2017-10-28 11:08:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ThorstenBr Madrid proposed snap election and puigdemont first agreed then backed up pressured by separatists. He's a lousy leader.
924231044471062528 2017-10-28 11:07:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ThorstenBr I'm sure emotions ran high on both sides but true shame is that this came to pass because obviously incompetent puigdemont et al.
924230795518271489 2017-10-28 11:06:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ThorstenBr Police r always small in numbers & most use control strategies to prevent horde chaos.
924230514155933698 2017-10-28 11:05:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ThorstenBr Police was ordered to confiscate materials of illegal election. If I stand in their way I do so at own risk.
924230204628918272 2017-10-28 11:03:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ThorstenBr Control of Catalonia has been transferred to Madrid, legally. How will govt buildings be accessed? It depends on those standing outside
924229846938550273 2017-10-28 11:02:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ThorstenBr Is there police abuse? Absolutely, but not every instance of police having to use force is abuse.
924229594294767616 2017-10-28 11:01:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ThorstenBr Police always get the bad rap because of nature of their task.
924228286246514688 2017-10-28 10:56:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ThorstenBr The one enforcing the law will always look bad. The hardcore nationalist minority pulled a farce for pure selfish reasons.
924226648152604672 2017-10-28 10:49:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KRLS Feliz ahora? Que  irresponsabildad la vuestra. Han hecho un mal enorme.
924225994885648385 2017-10-28 10:47:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @guyverhofstadt @Scotland_future Read history to understand.
924225280931258368 2017-10-28 10:44:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lizcastro Hardcore nativist nationalists threaten us all.
924224738070851584 2017-10-28 10:42:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaphaelMinder @nytimes @lizcastro So said u who's biased towards Catalonia separatists illegal & fraudulent actions
924224139270983680 2017-10-28 10:39:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Marcuzno1 Fact is EU solidly backs Spain up because hardcore irresponsible nationalists can't b allowed to ignore law.
924223597694111744 2017-10-28 10:37:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ThorstenBr Did u research hate tweets from separatists?
924222660753666048 2017-10-28 10:33:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AngusMacNeilSNP I support self-determination but what hardcore minority did in Catalonia is a farce and illegal.
924221515155099650 2017-10-28 10:29:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R Absolutely. Catalonia has autonomy but hardcore nationalists want separation period. They are intransigent.
924090630724300800 2017-10-27 01:49:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R There r areas already wanting to separate from Catalonia and remain in Spain. There's no pretty  path forward.
924069289182875649 2017-10-27 00:24:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R That won't happen. Spain has invoked Constitution and will take over and call new elections.
924069108659957760 2017-10-27 00:23:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R Catalonia joined kingdom of Aragon which in turned joined with Castile to form Spain centuries back.
924068949045719040 2017-10-27 00:23:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R But US was a colony Catalonia wasn't.
924068767897980929 2017-10-27 00:22:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R Nope. Autonomy was given to 17 regions. Problem has been demagogues like current Catalan leaders.
924068168104140800 2017-10-27 00:19:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R U r missing point: they had no obligation to partake in illegal vote.
924059482937847813 2017-10-27 23:45:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R So if u give your $ willingly to a thief then there is no robbery?
924059350515306497 2017-10-27 23:44:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R Puigdemont et al r irresponsible charlatans whose egos got the better of them.
924059203874050049 2017-10-27 23:44:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R But means everything in a developed democracy where there was a referendum to adopt Constitution.
924058938454302720 2017-10-27 23:43:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R Elections r conducted withing legal framework and separatists in Canada & now Spain just ignore this.
924058689501388800 2017-10-27 23:42:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R In this case they didn't vote cause constitutional court declared referendum illegal.
924056938345885696 2017-10-27 23:35:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R The whole is Spain is affected by these irresponsible actions.
924056382260817921 2017-10-27 23:33:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R Look at parliament today, 73 voted but parliament has 135 members.
924056145442103296 2017-10-27 23:32:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R So basically it was a separatists only referendum. Majority didn't participate cause referendum was illegal to begin with.
924055953242247168 2017-10-27 23:31:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R A majority didn't vote. 90% of the 40% who voted did.
924053738213511170 2017-10-27 23:22:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R @Francescfrcs Majority of support for separation is in rural areas where nativist nationalism is more prevalent.
924053584437809154 2017-10-27 23:21:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R @Francescfrcs We actually do and have done 4 a long time.about 30-35% support separation.
924052642921369600 2017-10-27 23:18:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R Well majority in Catalonia don't support separation. This whole thing is a farce by extremist minority.
924021834563104768 2017-10-27 21:15:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R Point is that separatists minority is mostly nativist nationalists who r often racist
924021532661374977 2017-10-27 21:14:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper @R_of_R Well the laws in question were not passed by tyrants and were approved in referendum by catalonians as well!!
924021312032518146 2017-10-27 21:13:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper Well u r now sounding like 6. IMO bullfighting is a remnant of a barbaric age.
924004309108428801 2017-10-27 20:06:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @aleixsarri That shows how much Catalonia violates the Constitution.
924004087942860801 2017-10-27 20:05:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper Have u ever been stabbed? I doubt u wouldn't mind each stabbing cause u had a happy life until then.
924003895030018049 2017-10-27 20:04:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper It takes years to master torture, killings, etc. Should that be also an art form?
924002865701687296 2017-10-27 20:00:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @enough14 Here comes the self-serving narrative.
924002575338307586 2017-10-27 19:59:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper Art form? Please. Tradition yes but so is women not being able to drive in some backward countries.
924002333545193472 2017-10-27 19:58:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PervyPepper It only tells u that u r against bullfighting as am I. Doesn't make Catalan illegal actions legal.
923990025355833344 2017-10-27 19:09:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @wokeluisa Catalonia secession is nativist nationalism & racist.
923989799861719041 2017-10-27 19:08:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @wokeluisa Catalonia joined kingdom of Aragon which in turn joined Castile to make Spain. Agreed to constitutional framework.
923989472555012102 2017-10-27 19:07:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @wokeluisa Utterly wrong comparison. Catalonia is not a colony.
923988509265981441 2017-10-27 19:03:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matcow7 Btw, ref was pushed thru illegal means and violating equal rights clauses.
923988386725187584 2017-10-27 19:02:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matcow7 Romanticism aside Spain had no obligation to partake in unconstitutional referendum.
923988150338441216 2017-10-27 19:01:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matcow7 That's like saying u giving your $ to a thief makes his action not a robbery.

918484000183865345 2017-10-12 14:30:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kunfazed @duhgooch To me I was in awe at Pele, Ronaldinho and think both Messi and CR7 while excellent benefit from more media exposure.

918483544581820421 2017-10-12 14:28:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kunfazed @duhgooch Not to demean Messi but let's face it, Messi has had a superbly talented team working 4 him. CR7 hasn't.
918483358467985410 2017-10-12 14:27:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kunfazed @duhgooch I admire people like Ronaldo or Evander who push normalcy to high achievement. Messi is more natural talent while Ronaldo is more process.

918457784362029056 2017-10-12 12:46:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kunfazed @duhgooch Forgot Maradona in the list of players above both Messi and Ronaldo. Peace.
918457522608136192 2017-10-12 12:45:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kunfazed @duhgooch Both Messi and Ronaldo r great players but I find Ronaldo more compelling and complete. (2)
918457322346811392 2017-10-12 12:44:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kunfazed @duhgooch Not Ronaldo either. Pele, Garrincha, Cruyff, many others above them both. Ronaldinho was better than both but undisciplined. (1)

916405109294112768 2017-10-06 20:49:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @_PaulMonaghan Well Spain's court declared referendum unconstitutional and ordered it stop. Catalonia govt didn't comply.

911919496402755584 2017-09-24 11:45:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PrincessBravato @Mikel_Jollett @MaximusTrajan23 I'm all 4 taking care or Earth but don't sign up to newest lib left cult.
911919311354318849 2017-09-24 11:44:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PrincessBravato @Mikel_Jollett @MaximusTrajan23 I.e. hurricanes being linked to GW rather that known 25-40 yr cycle.
911919072559984641 2017-09-24 11:43:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PrincessBravato @Mikel_Jollett @MaximusTrajan23 Yes that's correct. But causality of global warming is not yet proven and has been imputed for political purposes.
911698024992313344 2017-09-23 21:05:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @B4IleaveU Well dear neither is your son. Much ado about nothing. Wasted opportunity for true example and leadership.
911697664181403649 2017-09-23 21:03:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @B4IleaveU @ananavarro What rhetoric Ana? Paranoia runs amuck.
911368658462674944 2017-09-22 23:16:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @politico He's desperately trying to foment his imaginary legacy when we will remember him as the rino he's. DJT was right about this guy.
911349922468941825 2017-09-22 22:02:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu That lib left r congratulating McCain says lots about DC swamp vermin
911325257151209474 2017-09-22 20:24:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenJohnMcCain I knew it. Counting on McCain is folly
911236467422302208 2017-09-22 14:31:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChileeePlease @tashawm1 That's arrogance,: being wrong, knowing it, and feeling proud of it. To each her own. Be blessed. 
911230933973504000 2017-09-22 14:09:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChileeePlease @tashawm1 He showed more energy during campaign than younger candidates. Weak? So far not. Senile? Have u tested him Dr?
911215426859872256 2017-09-22 13:07:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AllenWest @MAGAindex This is why I cut cable off. Indoctrination not welcomed.
911214610325426176 2017-09-22 13:04:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DaShanneStokes For a Dr. I'm amazed u write such idiocy. Didn't they teach u that we r about electoral college not popular vote? Let me guess, lib college?
911214149321084930 2017-09-22 13:02:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @activist360 Bigots? It sounds the only bigot and hateful person here is u.
911213819225083905 2017-09-22 13:01:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @haldonahue So 20 yrs of NK escalation don't exist?
911213540949872641 2017-09-22 13:00:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> JFK praised Hitler, FDR Mussolini,  Carter w Castro ditto Obama. Enemy within is the most dangerous one.
911213300129714176 2017-09-22 12:59:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> That Americans would clap at NKs madman is what's troubling. But libs have a history of adulation 4 monsters so why the surprise?
911211352374566912 2017-09-22 12:51:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Pajjr2016 And what is Obamacare but robbery from working class?
911211146673377281 2017-09-22 12:50:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChileeePlease @tashawm1 True only to nuts like him.
911211024329650177 2017-09-22 12:50:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChileeePlease I respected the office even when Obamas lies took my insurance away and he sold us out time and time again.
911210788223881216 2017-09-22 12:49:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RJSzczerba DJT didn't file 4 personal BK did he? Corp BK is a  valid, legal biz tool. Enough nonsense.
911210230096244736 2017-09-22 12:47:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @rosalita2740 Really? NK has detonated nukes, working on mounting them on missiles to reach us and u worry about us defending? Crazy.
911195520076533762 2017-09-22 11:48:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @guardian Mr snowflake Obama of the north.  Merkel in the making flooding Canada w seeds of destruction.
911194668943200257 2017-09-22 11:45:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill Guarantee? She's growing nuttier by the tweet.
911194367175659520 2017-09-22 11:44:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @rapsody @CNNPolitics Most racism I see is sad lib excuse to hinder POTUS. Enough w such political games.
911194053911425025 2017-09-22 11:42:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Slate U mean naming non-activist judges so we the people decide and not smug elitists wearing robes?
911193704437829632 2017-09-22 11:41:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CillizzaCNN Funny how u play around from Russia seeking to intervene to collusion. HRC lost cause she can't be trusted.
911051273436372992 2017-09-21 02:15:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Pappiness @tinabgibby I can't believe deranged hatred makes some clap at a maniac like Kim.
911051019118940160 2017-09-21 02:14:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ochocinco So who did he and his predecessors had a beef with over past two decades?
911050252312088576 2017-09-21 02:11:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BreitbartNews @DineshDSouza So who made it comfortable for young blacks to have no hope but the political uncle Tom's like him?
911049701348298755 2017-09-21 02:09:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill Only Mrs Waters can come up w such stupidity. Carson has more brainpower in his pinky than she does in her all, wig included.
910989223770996736 2017-09-21 22:08:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SakinaKamwendo @RamarumoTshiko1 No. It's cause NK makes threats to use them and now they've been warned that if they attack we will defend. Period.
910986790680580096 2017-09-21 21:59:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CBCPolitics @longfinger_one Yup, disconnected w reality
910986492562026496 2017-09-21 21:57:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HillaryClinton @mic When will she get bit? She lost now get lost.
910973652690194437 2017-09-21 21:06:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill Finally got to see the real jerk not the polished fake lib he portrays in fake news
910962165858947072 2017-09-21 20:21:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNNPolitics Winnie the Pooh and his fantasy crusades.
910950604100505600 2017-09-21 19:35:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth He's establishment stooge. Do u really think Russians don't meet w everyone in DC?
910920537601462273 2017-09-21 17:35:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Mueller is doing more than that. He's doing establishment bid and I think he'll find nothing re DJT.
910914419575672833 2017-09-21 17:11:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Again, shark tank lady knows him for decades and says otherwise. Why is her voice good only when convenient?
910914190013091840 2017-09-21 17:10:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Point is that I don't have proof DJT is racist other than opinion of discredited libs. I stick to facts.
910913968599977984 2017-09-21 17:09:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Well the ones I talk to don't regret it yet despite lib media propaganda.
910913703033364481 2017-09-21 17:08:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Issue is not about immigration but rather illegal immigration.
910900809658925056 2017-09-21 16:17:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth For me, death penalty to drug traffickers. Look at how Singapore deals w them.
910900557426151429 2017-09-21 16:16:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Believe me, I'm too familiar w how it works. I saw it closer than a TV show.
910900373006831616 2017-09-21 16:15:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Many disagree w u too. More legal Latino immigrants voted 4 him than Romney. Ditto 4 Blacks.
910900004981739520 2017-09-21 16:14:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Spell corrector. Meant networth.
910899818201051137 2017-09-21 16:13:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth If u had lived south of border u will know more.
910899652647620609 2017-09-21 16:12:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Nice show but there r more nuances to it.
910899527808438274 2017-09-21 16:12:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Mexico has to tackle cartels and they don't cause cartels own politicians and police there.
910899337416278016 2017-09-21 16:11:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Is not just about terrorrists. Is about Mexico not exporting their problems north anymore.
910899135875813377 2017-09-21 16:10:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Didn't say all his ideas r great. Some r good some not. Wall is good idea where proper and effective. Other places may need diff approach.
910898881868832768 2017-09-21 16:09:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Examples based on appreciation or opinion r not evidence. The argument fails w no extrinsic evidence.
910898538133016577 2017-09-21 16:08:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Well Sessions is very experienced. I like Gorka's  knowledge of issues. I don't know Bannon or Miller so I can't comment on their merits.
910898209740017672 2017-09-21 16:07:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth U know what's funny, that shark tank gal said Trump is very smart and he achieved success on his own merit not as libs say cause of daddy.
910897619311955969 2017-09-21 16:04:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Well given that he has a positive network I think u r so wrong on this.
910897434502602752 2017-09-21 16:04:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth His background defines a typical NY biz person as others I know.
910897308832866305 2017-09-21 16:03:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Well when u r worth billions it's expected in our litigious environment. I earn my living playing the legal game.
910897106436677632 2017-09-21 16:02:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth And there's other lawsuits he best her. It's a game.
910896970423783426 2017-09-21 16:02:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Just like there's other where he beat her. I'm small biz potato and have been sued and sued others. Don King said it best "only in America"
910896625652043777 2017-09-21 16:00:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I don't abide by appropriated definition but by academic definition.
910896449008828416 2017-09-21 16:00:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Just kidding. But u should stop assuming I don't understand as I've spent most my life here.
910896256767184899 2017-09-21 15:59:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth But we should try and make it harder not easier.
910857276033990656 2017-09-21 13:24:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BBCWorld @LeoDiCaprio @insideclimate Pope better deal w Vatican corruption b4 lecturing us on anything else.
910856933103603712 2017-09-21 13:23:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ClimateHome @LeoDiCaprio @dicapriofdn If DiCaprio and other millionaires want to buy us working class a Tesla I'll drop my gas car. Deal Leo?
910856510451994624 2017-09-21 13:21:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thedailybeast Leo believes the script of climate change cult to be real. Another one bit the dust.
910851623727063040 2017-09-21 13:02:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @timkaine Obamacare hurt millions too like me. Hi come that didn't matter the or now to u senator? Pura hipocresia de politicos.
910850806039109633 2017-09-21 12:58:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @POLITICOMag @Acosta @politico Well at least left is no longer pretending he's a journalist. Can now do same for Jorge Ramos? Another lib snowflake.
910828599200174080 2017-09-21 11:30:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BarackObama @ABCPolitics @JohnOsso @EnemyofGLaDOS I don't believe any politician. Politicians went from serving the people to serving themselves.
910696015182876672 2017-09-20 02:43:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BarackObama @ABCPolitics @JohnOsso He was a great actor for sure. He lies to us all and some r still defending him.
910695770927648768 2017-09-20 02:42:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ABCPolitics Hypocrite. He caused harm to those of us who lost insurance to Obamacare. Shame on Pinocchio.
910695458380697600 2017-09-20 02:41:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @POLITICOMag @politico WikiLeaks merely exposed the truth about DNC and HRC corruption. That lib loons want to keep us blind is the real threat to democracy.
910680517191880705 2017-09-20 01:42:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LiberalProg Which explains why Obama left the NK mess.good riddance.
910680246059454465 2017-09-20 01:41:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @chelseahandler Now I see why u suck at comedy.
910680074512404481 2017-09-20 01:40:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JacobAWohl Madam nonebright should just shut up.
910679902982164486 2017-09-20 01:39:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Reuters Well of course nutty Merkel would say that. Given her surrender of Germany to radical Islamists I'm glad she's not our POTUS.
910677960759414785 2017-09-20 01:32:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CBSNews @RoscoeJames She lost. Plain and simple.
910677756274528257 2017-09-20 01:31:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CBSNews When two losers meet.
910677280350928896 2017-09-20 01:29:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HillaryClinton @Shakestweetz A good shrink might help.
910677144858238976 2017-09-20 01:28:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @leahmcelrath No surprise. Libs need to feed paranoia hence they buy her rubbish book. It's their money to waste.
910674735880687616 2017-09-20 01:19:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Is not about fake IDs. Is about forged new identities. Like u getting new SSN and birth certificate here.
910673039741915136 2017-09-20 01:12:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @latimes Steps up to defend foreigners over citizenry 
910584961945755649 2017-09-20 19:22:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Why do u keep imputing my disagreement on my origin? That sounds discriminatory u know?
910584564627714048 2017-09-20 19:20:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth They had a few lawsuits on diff issues. Some win. Some lose. Normal in biz.
910582834141831168 2017-09-20 19:14:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Balzac said it best: behind every great fortune lies a crime. Biz is a jungle so u deal w beasts.
910582526233731072 2017-09-20 19:12:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Cheating thing can mean anything cause contractors have mechanic lien to protect their rights. Don't swallow lib baloney pill so easily.
910582276517449729 2017-09-20 19:11:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I know a couple of contractors who worked 4 hi m. One was happy the other one wasn't. Pretty normal in my experience.
910580174449717248 2017-09-20 19:03:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I research everything and don't agree w the view he's a proven racist.
910579834069405696 2017-09-20 19:02:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth How many loans he's got following bks? That tells u how those who know and matter view the guy.
910579654821601280 2017-09-20 19:01:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth BK is a biz tool not synonymous with failure.
910575251288940544 2017-09-20 18:43:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth U write as if u know the guy. He's a smart cunning NY biz guy. Don't confuse his personna, his play w who he may truly b.
910574963018670081 2017-09-20 18:42:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth So far I haven't seen him doing something I can attack as racist. When he does then we can talk about it.
910574775197736960 2017-09-20 18:41:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Failed biz? Of course. Out of 100+ corps 4 filed 4 bk? Nothing wrong there.
910574500982542336 2017-09-20 18:40:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth There's a reason why govt settled.
910571984966299650 2017-09-20 18:30:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Same thing w other cases at the time like the one involving Le Frak Org.
910571847724552192 2017-09-20 18:30:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Trump's Corp owned 15,000 rental units and some lower level mgmt did actually improperly and was remedied.
910571528424771584 2017-09-20 18:29:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth The NY times headline says it clearly: June 11, 1975 "Trump promises to end race bias"
910571014127579141 2017-09-20 18:27:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Case ended up in settlement for training of staff and no admission or judgment of culpability.
910570857277386752 2017-09-20 18:26:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth The case was part of a larger crusade to rid NY of discrimination and big landlords were targeted.
910570600971816960 2017-09-20 18:25:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I reviewed the history of the case. Did u?
910569663330967552 2017-09-20 18:21:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth If a thief wants to truly break in he will. Do u leave the door unlocked then? What's the purpose?
910569475400925184 2017-09-20 18:20:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Canada while lib at least has strict internal security.
910569338587041793 2017-09-20 18:20:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth True and that's why Canada's dumb policies r dangerous to us too.
910569189118824449 2017-09-20 18:19:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Not like a failed state where u can't verify anything. Believe me, I have practical experience on this subject. It's scary.
910568920364584961 2017-09-20 18:18:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Unfortunately it's Islamic terrorism we must worry about.
910568712247365633 2017-09-20 18:17:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth He did refer to a Muslim ban during the campaign but it was not based on religion which is why SCOTUS reversed crazy 9th circuit.
910566365190385664 2017-09-20 18:08:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Tweek is like patching old wood. Just so new deals start fresh.
910566146495180804 2017-09-20 18:07:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth He responded. U didn't like his response. I agree w what he said albeit he's not a polished speaker prone to gaffes.
910565874632978438 2017-09-20 18:06:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Again, so what? I care about policies not skin color. Obama was brown like me and he messed me up. Go figure.
910565612363149319 2017-09-20 18:05:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth So what? I don't judge a person by his/her parents. Until u deal w biz u don't understand many things.
910565267348082688 2017-09-20 18:04:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth No it wasn't. The countries listed r failed states where easy to forge IDs.
910565041119916041 2017-09-20 18:03:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth No quite but he sent DACA to Congress where it belongs. Obama abused executive authority w DACA and many other things.
910564658943275008 2017-09-20 18:01:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I see a case for DACA. It makes sense.
910564475706728448 2017-09-20 18:01:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I don't blame Mexico 4 taking advantage of dumb politically motivated trade deals. I blame dumb or traitors who sold is out.
910564176967462921 2017-09-20 17:59:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth He complaints about Mexico like I have for years b4 he even ran 4 office. NAFTA had problems & was bad deal 4 American workers.
910563927276376065 2017-09-20 17:58:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Just cause u think he's racist doesn't mean he is.
910560973223792640 2017-09-20 17:47:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth What racism? Not wanting being takwn 4 a ride is not being racist is being smart.
910560629379002368 2017-09-20 17:45:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Mexico don't care about it. Immigration means tens of billions to them.
910560457110548480 2017-09-20 17:45:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Make products in Mexico and import here cheap cause of NAFTA? We would go broke w such ideas not stopping now.
910560218328764417 2017-09-20 17:44:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth You have good intentions but seem a bit naive to me. I say this respectfully. Real life is not kumbaya
910559860072251394 2017-09-20 17:42:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth So u r ok w unemployment here to help Mexico? R u willing to give your job up so it can go to Mexico?
910557457482702849 2017-09-20 17:33:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Understand this: Mexico has to live w us as neighbor but they're not our friends
910557288372609026 2017-09-20 17:32:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth A friend who abuses u is not a friend.
910557137700577280 2017-09-20 17:31:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Do u believe it's our responsibility to remedy Mexico and Central America problems that way?
910556965037858818 2017-09-20 17:31:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth What do u propose as settlement? Understand that Mexico and Central America export their poor to get $ back from them.
910554806451916801 2017-09-20 17:22:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Problem is that Mexico encourages illegal immigration as solution to their economic failures. Ditto for central american countries
910316921668751361 2017-09-19 01:37:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @amyklobuchar Did u know impact of obamacare when u voted 4 it? Sounds rather hypocritical 4 u to say this now.
910315374486458373 2017-09-19 01:31:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TIME Hillary who?
910290726398898176 2017-09-19 23:53:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenJeffMerkley @FemMaverick If politicians actually did their work instead of playing games we both would b spared this chaos. Best wishes.
910287574454996992 2017-09-19 23:40:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenJeffMerkley @Mrs_Sue_Wright HRC is promoting book saying senseless stupidity.
910287370108461056 2017-09-19 23:39:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenJeffMerkley @FemMaverick So did I and obamacare robbed my peace of mind.
910287190973931520 2017-09-19 23:39:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenJeffMerkley Know somebody whose insurance obamacare stole? Me, me, Senator.....
910286613636435974 2017-09-19 23:36:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Slate @LindaKe32747273 Funny since I asked myself how could anyone vote to reelect Obama given his lies and failures.
910286203156606976 2017-09-19 23:35:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Slate Well he ran 4 POTUS and won. She spoke like an idiot.
910201058340802562 2017-09-19 17:56:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth U must watch lots of lib media as they use it the way u describe it and understandingly so as they r lib mothpiece paid by Soros
910200647886221314 2017-09-19 17:55:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth No. Libs do. I see nationalism as America first and support it.
910200455250182144 2017-09-19 17:54:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Here in FL forget about subsidirs if earning $36k+ try living w that income here. Only dumb DC pols think $36k is rich.
910200215776514048 2017-09-19 17:53:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Obamacare is great for those who get subsidies but not 4 working class.
910200040567787520 2017-09-19 17:52:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Obamacare is flawed to the core. We needed new thinking and they gave us half-a.. lies.
910193895409102848 2017-09-19 17:28:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth A lib court would have ruled for obamacare and would have been wrong.
910193758821548038 2017-09-19 17:27:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Look at Roberts decision re Obamacare, it should be resolved by legislature not courts.
910193619994365953 2017-09-19 17:27:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Indeed. I like the Scalia mold as I believe we should decide and not unelected judges.
910193375369932801 2017-09-19 17:26:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Lib left uses nationalism as synonymous w racism. I don't surrender term to their use of it.
910193153898139648 2017-09-19 17:25:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Groups twist meaning of terms to their own purposes. I use terms as intended. Why let any group usurp use of terms?
910115924937715712 2017-09-19 12:18:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Of course they r opposites. Obama is globalist and DJT is nationalist in America first. 50yrs of playing dumb is enough.
909889117282078720 2017-09-18 21:17:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Look at 9th circuit to see a political circus that destroys our republic. Bot Sotomayor and Kagan r political hacks not worthy of SCOTUS.
909888830035173377 2017-09-18 21:16:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Is not about being appointed to a court. Is about SCOTUS, our last constitutional safeguard.
909802114838405123 2017-09-18 15:31:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Remember how Obama jumped whenever some punk got shot? The race baiter in chief. What a wasted opportunity for Black America.
909801837792022528 2017-09-18 15:30:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Please. His care for Black on Black murder says a lot about his hypocrisy. He played the Black role and fooled many but not me.
909801529590341632 2017-09-18 15:29:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth No. Obama appointed both hacks.
909801106414465024 2017-09-18 15:27:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I don't want 9 unelected judges setting the course of our social compact. We should decide as voters.
909800903414296581 2017-09-18 15:26:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth See, any conservative is a racist to u. That's the problem. Gorsuch is a strict constitutionalist and I'm all for that.
909800571141607424 2017-09-18 15:25:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth How about medicare for catastrophic and we can all deal w non catastrophic insurance? Or tort reform?
909800377142398976 2017-09-18 15:24:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Didn't say trumocare is best. Obamacare is what we have and is horrendous.
909800199052316672 2017-09-18 15:24:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth U mean voters not for him were horrified? Whole paranoia circus is on the left.
909799947754762241 2017-09-18 15:23:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth There r many chapters in American nationalism from founding fathers to Teddy Roosevelt new nationalism.
909799782532689920 2017-09-18 15:22:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Being nationalist doesn't mean being racist. Libs like redefining terms and history but it's all a lie.
909798953037783040 2017-09-18 15:19:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth No he didn't. Obama and his minions disgracefully used race division and left us deeply divided.
909787966972841991 2017-09-18 14:35:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Newsweek @LostDarling @johannamillard We don't know. He's certainly unorthodox but I don't buy into him being as u describe.
909766951869837312 2017-09-18 13:11:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HillaryClinton @DineshDSouza @w_terrence For me it was all about her being a Clinton not a woman what mattered. I remember the Clintons saga of corruption, never again.
909765733462224896 2017-09-18 13:07:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Newsweek @LostDarling Just because u don't like him? Welcome to your dream banana republic.
909765570081550336 2017-09-18 13:06:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Newsweek @janelynne Good question, what is wrong with you all? Election is over. You lost. Grow up.
909590243648720898 2017-09-17 01:29:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ScaryMommy @les_canadien @AmyScull1 So DJT is to blame for 20 yrs of failed policies w NK? 
909551528226238464 2017-09-17 22:55:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Question is why? Obama is not dumb so it had to be all on purpose.
909551405437980672 2017-09-17 22:55:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I lost health ins due to obamacare. He left behind a bigger mess than Carter and I thought that was impossible.
909550855719972865 2017-09-17 22:53:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I voted DJT primarily to protect SCOTUS as can't imagine another left hack like Sotomayor or Kagan there.
909550511833182209 2017-09-17 22:51:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Obama played heavy on race politics and his agenda opened door wide open for DJT.
909535792262938624 2017-09-17 21:53:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth We can't talk Trump without Obama. DJT is Obama's truest lasting legacy.
909535607185133570 2017-09-17 21:52:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I've been in tune w American politics for 30 yrs and race card is way overplayed.
909535094360150027 2017-09-17 21:50:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Point is that lib groups r following old Marxist protocols to intimidate and silence opposition. They r true fascists.
909534885395730432 2017-09-17 21:49:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I said most calls and acts of violence come from lib left not that all or most lib Left r violent.
909511383288619008 2017-09-17 20:16:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill How Obama apologizing for lying about obamacare? Keep plan, doctor, my a..
909468430851608576 2017-09-17 17:25:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I wish first Black POTUS would have been a worthy one like Colin Powell and not a demagogue empty suit.
909468208649957377 2017-09-17 17:24:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Obama is a hypocrite. Took Black mantle when he's half-white and threw white family under bus for political profit. He disgusts me.
909467759930732547 2017-09-17 17:23:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Frankly open inciting to violence is abundant in libs today.
909467488282431497 2017-09-17 17:22:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth He may or may not. Fact is we don't know what he knows.
909467279833911296 2017-09-17 17:21:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Look a how DJT is a misogynist while Bill Clinton gets a pass. We r either for full truth or complete lie.
909467030587396096 2017-09-17 17:20:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Short of becoming Democrat sessions will never be entitled to apology. That's the sad double standard of Dems.
909466691658272769 2017-09-17 17:18:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I don't understand "racist" tag being thrown around so capriciously. It's senseless.
909095420491714560 2017-09-16 16:43:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth What racist issues? Enforce immigration laws? I want that so your logic makes me a racist?
909095222709293056 2017-09-16 16:42:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Frankly I oppose political correctness. I'd rather know the enemy than having he hide true feelings.
909094995180883976 2017-09-16 16:41:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth If context matters then sessions deeds far surpass Byrd's & yet Byrd was sanctified by hypocritical Dems Obama included 
909094717505273856 2017-09-16 16:40:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Wasn't it in 2001 that Byrd used the "n" word? He apologized & libs were ok w that. Same is not true when other side slips tongue that way.
908850049051799552 2017-09-15 00:28:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tomasrabago1 @SenFeinstein @Nofearnofavors4 Yes I did. First time uninsured  cause of AHA fraud. Cash payer now cause won't fudge income to leech off others.
908849459303510016 2017-09-15 00:26:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @EBONYMag Misplaced loyalty. She acted in dumb way.
908848587223822337 2017-09-15 00:22:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BostonGlobe @LeeAnndelCasti2 Another tolerant coward block and run when called out on their baloney
908841990346956802 2017-09-15 23:56:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @theblaze Masterful answer. Just what education r people paying 4 at Berkeley? Sophomoric questions at best.
908840528996954112 2017-09-15 23:50:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RepKarenBass Yet another dumb waste of time when so much needsn to be done. Enough w political rubbish.
908840074317631489 2017-09-15 23:48:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BostonGlobe @LeeAnndelCasti2 Oh please get a grip. It's time to abide by the laws or risk turning into banana republic like the ones we left behind.
908839097971638273 2017-09-15 23:45:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenFeinstein California liberals have left nothing unhurt bin CA. What a shame.
908838769498914816 2017-09-15 23:43:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tomasrabago1 @SenFeinstein @Nofearnofavors4 Funny since I lost mine to obamacare fraud
908838612925640704 2017-09-15 23:43:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenFeinstein Will I get mine back (AHA stole it)? That's what I care about.
908837995414945792 2017-09-15 23:40:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Newsweek I change it by working and ignoring his demagoguery
908821275682000898 2017-09-15 22:34:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth But when a conservative apologizes he/she not given same benefit of doubt? Hmm.
908820842863382528 2017-09-15 22:32:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I know people who may say wrong thing but r not racist. I don't use the term lightly.
908820606887571457 2017-09-15 22:31:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Ban was based on inability to vet those coming from those countries. Smart move.
908820395603701760 2017-09-15 22:30:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Of course they do. The power of ignorance is scary. Race baiters have made fortunes peddling falsehoods.
908820140288020480 2017-09-15 22:29:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth R they racist? I don't know. I just say I don't see credible evidence like Byrd's kkk membership and leadership role.
908819889758130176 2017-09-15 22:28:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I have. I haven't found meat behind lib media propaganda bones.
908819670731542528 2017-09-15 22:27:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Kerry, libs history of racism is amazing. Don't fall for their propaganda that has sanitized their true ugly past.
908819463730016263 2017-09-15 22:26:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth No. Don't ignore history. Kkk became attached to dem party as it's enforcer. Woodrow Wilson gave it notoriety.
908819058535145477 2017-09-15 22:25:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Btw, lookup name Everett Dirksen who pushed bill through as minority leader! Yes, he was GOP.
908818780993748994 2017-09-15 22:24:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth 1860-1960 it was Dems who worked against Blacks. History is witness but too many rely on Dems myth to hide their true history.
908817587378769923 2017-09-15 22:19:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Dems went from kkk party to civil rights party in name only for political convenience.
908817369979637760 2017-09-15 22:18:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth And who voted for civil Rights act? Lookup voting record: largest opposing block in house and Senate? Democrats.
908816473933729793 2017-09-15 22:15:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth This is the same NAACP that gave Byrd 100% rating when he had been a true kkk leader? Clearly a racist democrat is acceptable to NAACP.
908816163211227136 2017-09-15 22:13:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth He was refused based on inuendo. He went on to become atty general of Alabama prosecuting  kkk and then Senate.
908815402964340736 2017-09-15 22:10:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Guilt by association is not guilt. Did u apply it when it came to Obama and his veritably despicable buddies? Bill Ayers, rev Wright?
908814990882299916 2017-09-15 22:09:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Senator Byrd? Dems idolize the creep who was a klan recruiter. Wonder why antifa not demanding all Byrd monuments be removed 
908807666071425024 2017-09-15 21:40:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Well Mexico's woes result in our border problem so I have no issue w funding border security w tariff on Mexican goods.
908807323405225986 2017-09-15 21:38:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Now talk about something unconstitutional: sanctuary cities.
908807071184846849 2017-09-15 21:37:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Again all I ask is that inconvenient thing called evidence.
908806920403849222 2017-09-15 21:37:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth As a brown person i know all I mean to lib Dems is a vote come election time and then back to ghetto urban plantation.
908806613779275776 2017-09-15 21:35:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Historical truth: kkk were the Dems brown shirts. Reps, not Dems freed slaves and passed civil rights while Dems opposed.
908806342881742848 2017-09-15 21:34:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth If u read history u find shocking truth about racists like FDR and Woodrow Wilson and many other Dems.
908806117072961537 2017-09-15 21:33:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth So was Al Gore and I venture u voted 4 him did u? And supported HRC/Obama who eulogized a kkk turned Dem senator?
908805770245840896 2017-09-15 21:32:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Perhaps legal immigrants who actually pay price of illegal immigration may have valid reasons like wage depreciation, lower school quality?
908805474560172033 2017-09-15 21:31:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Problem is plenty of us brown people want secured borders. So, r we bigots then?
908805104626753537 2017-09-15 21:29:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I read about sessions alleged racist past and found it to be fake. I'm Open to new info if available.
908804912624001024 2017-09-15 21:29:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Oh well if the NAACP is the oracle then sure but it ain't so. NAACP is nowadays a political stooge.
908804681660497920 2017-09-15 21:28:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Back when Guatemala was I war I interviewed a few Mexicans seeking assylum in Canada under false IDs. Easy to do when govt collapses.
908804423270400000 2017-09-15 21:27:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth The ban makes absolute sense as then countries in question r failed states. Easy to forge new identity.
908804204319395840 2017-09-15 21:26:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I'm am for the ban. I'm not racist I just want to be safe from loons who want to kill us.
908804042268258304 2017-09-15 21:25:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Frankly, throwing around racist epithet demeans it's true awful meaning.
908803893840302086 2017-09-15 21:25:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I still don't see precise facts. I may disagree w him but that disagreement doesn't make him a racist.
908773003407904768 2017-09-15 19:22:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @latimes Ah Pocahontas poco brain. Simpleton solutions for political demagoguery, as usual.
908770190682394624 2017-09-15 19:11:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Let's look at sessions first: what's your evidence of his racism?
908769890999455746 2017-09-15 19:10:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth He's been too pushy on that.  A simple tariff would do with no need to aggravate Mexico.
908769686761955328 2017-09-15 19:09:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Funny thing is that assumption that all Latinos so if together is well racist as it denies individuality of person.
908769403898093568 2017-09-15 19:08:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Is that a lib thing to echo each other even in lies? U don't know me to presume and judge my emotions or feelings.
908769064444624898 2017-09-15 19:06:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I'd b happy to consider facts to support such accusations.
908768962183352320 2017-09-15 19:06:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Other than Gorka whom I didn't research yet, whole racist label on Bannon and sessions is seemingly meritless driven by politics.
908737039721533440 2017-09-15 16:59:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 So Clintons get a pass in your book? Whole DNC Bernie boycott was collusion.
908735257788211200 2017-09-15 16:52:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 I don't fact shop. If evidence proves a crime I say prosecute. Period.
908735109037162498 2017-09-15 16:51:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 Only proven collusion so far is Clinton/Ukraine. Only actual crime not prosecuted? HRCs email server. Rest is speculation for now.
908734765314035714 2017-09-15 16:50:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 If it's obvious then should b easy to lay on table.
908734054119481344 2017-09-15 16:47:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ABCPolitics @susan19514 What disgusting if people tarnishing everything w political manure like this.
908732697266327552 2017-09-15 16:42:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 Fine. Be blessed.
908731674493620225 2017-09-15 16:38:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 I asked u for actionable intelligence and u get upset cause u can't provide it? U chose the horse so ride it.
908731479391440902 2017-09-15 16:37:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 Fact that I ask you shows my honest interest in discussing topic at hand. Only a fool seeks echoes of own ideas.
908726902147436545 2017-09-15 16:19:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 Tell me, how is he standing w our enemy? Facts, actionable intelligence pls.
908723463866724352 2017-09-15 16:05:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 Maybe. I just see establishment protecting itself. Frankly, we need third party as Dems and reps r two sides of same corrupt coin.
908723142566318081 2017-09-15 16:04:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 Reading that, so u see mirror image of birthers fight against Obama? Trump is as much traitor as Obama Muslim. We need to stop w this hate.
908722559981670400 2017-09-15 16:01:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 I like to wait 4 facts and evidence. We'll see what investigation yields but I expect it will prove to have been nothing but dirty politics
908720936165273602 2017-09-15 15:55:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 Well since u went from my being racist to ignorant rather than understand that two decent people can in fact disagree.
908720681369653248 2017-09-15 15:54:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 @whatabunny621 Which gave Hitler rationale to Target financial capitalists who happen to b Jews. Very profound history dumbed down by propaganda.
908720346349674496 2017-09-15 15:53:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 @whatabunny621 Marxist thinkers in Italy and Germany provided foundation for facist and Nazi ideology. Ie division of productive and financial caputalism..
908720013829398528 2017-09-15 15:51:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 @whatabunny621 Marx predictions failed and rationalization led to leninist/facist divide to b simplistic. Hatred between both is internal not external.
908719464824426496 2017-09-15 15:49:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 @whatabunny621 I went to school south of the border, Canada and US. But continue educating myself all the time. What course r u taking?
908719115556331520 2017-09-15 15:48:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 Never been to Breitbart and not interested in such propaganda either.
908718948711063553 2017-09-15 15:47:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 I did. 2 bachelor degrees, MBA, law degree. Does that count? I opened the door it's up to u to enter and liberate yourself w knowledge.
908716692309778433 2017-09-15 15:38:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 One book to start learning that which schools denied you.pic.twitter.com/zcWItOVQDj
908716174858506241 2017-09-15 15:36:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 Really? Better learn about how Marxism splintered into leninists and fascists/nazists. History hidden by lib education system. Take care.
908715660062150656 2017-09-15 15:34:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 Neither did Obama or Clinton etc. So? I truly appreciate your service and would have served if called to.
908715302527135744 2017-09-15 15:33:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 I don't depend on others opinions about me. I could care less frankly. I've run into racists b4 and don't give a hoot.
908714953883963392 2017-09-15 15:31:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 I don't malign u 4 your opinions. How did we lose ability or civil discourse?
908714693308616704 2017-09-15 15:30:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 Now u r losing your grip. Why can't u accept that reasonable people might just disagree wbu?
908714450190045185 2017-09-15 15:29:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 I just reject propaganda koolaid whether from Fox or CNN. The guy won, let him work like we did Obama. In 4 yrs we get to judge his work.
908714187437887489 2017-09-15 15:28:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 Why do people insist on calling Nazis right wingers when Nazis r marxists?
908713992977252353 2017-09-15 15:27:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 My only concern was SCOTUS and that being secured Im ok.
908713845006487552 2017-09-15 15:27:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 No I don't. My vote 4 DJT was pretty much my middle finger to political establishment giving us the same rancid crap every 2 years.
908713615334748165 2017-09-15 15:26:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28  no need for that. I'm happy w how I am. I'm a person, not a color, race, or anything else but a person.
908713328792494080 2017-09-15 15:25:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 No it doesn't. I know myself. I know what motivates me and race or color is not a driver.
908713047635742721 2017-09-15 15:24:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 Homemade? The carteles operate all the way from South America through Canada.
908712838742593536 2017-09-15 15:23:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 We do. Problem is multifaceted.
908712731351580672 2017-09-15 15:22:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I don't work w Mexican laws but would b glad to help u w US laws.
908712541865508867 2017-09-15 15:22:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 Disagree. I don't see how asking laws be repected & enforced makes me a bad person. Comparison w Nazis is out of place.
908711967522721792 2017-09-15 15:19:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 Problem is politicians playing w people's lives 4 political gain.
908711809158348800 2017-09-15 15:19:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 Well the law they break calls for fines not jail.
908711111305973761 2017-09-15 15:16:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 No. I immigrated on my own. I do understand economic plight of laborers and support work permit for them.
908707434461581312 2017-09-15 15:01:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 Hiring illegal labor should be penalized. I'm for law and order that's all.
908707284133478400 2017-09-15 15:01:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 No. I don't feel superior. I just don't want to be hypocrite when all countries have immigration laws.
908707007062036481 2017-09-15 15:00:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 I'm all for temporary work permits like Canada does. Come, work, and return as needed.
908705571674771459 2017-09-15 14:54:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth  you just can't help it can u? Feisty. Have a good night and b safe.
908704816871993344 2017-09-15 14:51:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @J_Fonte28 Never understand why Mexico expects US not to enforce it's borders as Mexico does.
908704050530717697 2017-09-15 14:48:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Funny since I happen to be a lawyer. Don't feel sorry for anybody that's condescending and only demerits u. Play nice.
908701713221259264 2017-09-15 14:39:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Lots or foreigners in Mexico? Sure. So? There r foreigners everywhere.
908701346513203201 2017-09-15 14:37:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth The carteles operate deep into US territory. Sadly narcos have ran over most Mexican institutions.  Sad situation down there.
908701054790926336 2017-09-15 14:36:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I don't hate Mexico Adelita. I may hate what it has sadly become but that's Mexico's problem not ours to resolve.
908700577764446210 2017-09-15 14:34:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Of course there's more to the problem and we need to address all aspects of it.
908694956319105024 2017-09-15 14:12:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Aside from illegal immigration, drug trafficking and gang infestation r concerns.
908694694376480768 2017-09-15 14:11:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I don't think wall is racist per se. Is the best use of resources? I don't think so. We can do more and better.
908694423650865153 2017-09-15 14:10:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I don't defend DJT. I object to false premises from any corner. Is he racist? I don't know him & won't let propaganda drive my thinking.
908693892526219264 2017-09-15 14:08:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I was shocked how many legally immigrated Hispanics voted DJT cause we want laws respected. R we all racists?
908693629434245120 2017-09-15 14:06:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I followed the rules to immigrate here so why shouldn't others do same?
908693369597112325 2017-09-15 14:05:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth But who's saying no to immigration per se? Whole issue is about illegal immigration.
908692518518353925 2017-09-15 14:02:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Sorry dear but there r immigration laws in every country. What's the beef w respecting them? Why expect US not to enforce its own?
908692118713053185 2017-09-15 14:00:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth So Mexico is now an open borders country?
908691164643065856 2017-09-15 13:57:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Point was and is that Mexico and any other country have right to set own immigration laws.
908690960367964160 2017-09-15 13:56:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I worked w migrants years ago and learned well about their plight in Mexico. Some progress made since then.
908690659414069249 2017-09-15 13:55:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Good evening I guess. U didn't Adelita. U read something I didn't write and the laws while shuffled r still there.
908687325642788864 2017-09-15 13:41:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I don't know everything about politics but what little I  do know I know it well. Facts should lead our thinking.
908659505977753600 2017-09-15 11:51:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AlanDersh @jeffglor @CBSNews @martysullivanjr I never thought I would see him labelled RW he, a notorious liberal?
908659150514802688 2017-09-15 11:49:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @jeffglor @CBSNews So the nutward reacted
908658744229335044 2017-09-15 11:48:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNNPolitics He can do both. Obama left a message behind and we must acknowledge that.
908591012850921472 2017-09-15 07:19:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> That's why I wrote ciao. Expected "tolerant" reaction.
908590370090553344 2017-09-15 07:16:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LupeNevarez612 "block all pro Trump?" Tolerance at its best and then wonder why country's so divided. Ciao.
908590009409789953 2017-09-15 07:15:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Alyssa_Milano How about Id card? I forgot Dems want illegals to vote so Id is a non-starter.
908589201540698112 2017-09-15 07:12:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TheDemCoalition @SHSanders45 @joncoopertweets @JamiaStarheart @WalkerMishelle Panic attack over an election? Need to expand your horizon dear.
908587696750252037 2017-09-15 07:06:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Anyways? We'll leave it here. Good night and thanks for remaining nice.
908587534770475008 2017-09-15 07:05:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Neither do I. I corrected myself as far as the code goes or is new code and regulations a lie?
908587324786839553 2017-09-15 07:04:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth You r in UK? How is that brexit thing playing out?
908587090711064577 2017-09-15 07:03:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth U didnt. I never wrote there's a wall w Guatemala and yes, the code was changed and shuffled to new code.
908586588648755200 2017-09-15 07:01:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Ya, no te enojes. Good night, peace, and we'll agree to disagree civilly.
908586176944246785 2017-09-14 06:59:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> New to this and learning. Thanks.
908584824016982016 2017-09-14 06:54:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Yes. My attempt at this 140 character limit. Could b better 4 sure.
908584336995135488 2017-09-14 06:52:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @TaniaArth @pablorullan He does have a penchant 4 talking off the cuff when he shouldn't.
908584098033225728 2017-09-14 06:51:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> U know about Weiner's wiener saga don't u?
908583454840885248 2017-09-14 06:49:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Why does Mexico pretty much demands US open borders to illegal Mexican immigration?
908583312855322624 2017-09-14 06:48:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Point is Mexico has sovereign right to chose who immigrates there so why deny US same right?
908583125399277568 2017-09-14 06:47:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Again, the 2017 migration law, it's rules and regulations, still say same things.
908580956054933504 2017-09-14 06:39:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I don't blame Mexico for wanting qualified immigrants so why blame US for wanting same?
908580807463391232 2017-09-14 06:38:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Why? Cause most Mexicans illegally here wouldn't qualify to immigrate into Mexico.
908580612914794496 2017-09-14 06:37:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Just like most countries except when DJT talked about it Mexico complained in yet another act of hypocrisy.
908580391287746561 2017-09-14 06:37:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth IE, point system based on education, knowledge of Spanish, and Mexican culture to qualify as immigrant.
908580214627819520 2017-09-14 06:36:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I was citing the old code. I read the new code and it's "reglamento" and while modern still calls to protect Mexico's interests.
908575900630966272 2017-09-14 06:19:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @TaniaArth @pablorullan Funny how I knkw contractors who worked for him over the years and don't say such things. I'm sure conflicts occurred but fake news exist
908574537599586304 2017-09-14 06:13:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth This was partly due to pressure for Mexico to stop abuses on illegals.
908574379726000128 2017-09-14 06:13:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Adelita, Felipe Calderon separated the immigration component into the let de migracion. I give u that.
908571732516134914 2017-09-14 06:02:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RT_com Compromise? How much more until we put this  rabid dog out?
908571454718881792 2017-09-14 06:01:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Taking ideas from Hillary is akin like taking notes from wiener about decency.

908570389298634752 2017-09-14 05:57:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill This from the mistress of failed diplomacy? This lady has chutzpah.
908569154952740865 2017-09-14 05:52:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Slate But, he's right or did white supremacists fight ghosts?
908567084853948416 2017-09-14 05:44:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Ay Adelita no se me haga: Ley General de poblacion. Firmada por Luis Echeverria con Ultima reforma el 2015. No tema Mija que la verdad vale
908564412071518208 2017-09-14 05:33:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth @LibyaLiberty When allies disrespect and take 4 granted, r they allies? Mexico has gotten a free ride 4 too long.
908563750143254535 2017-09-14 05:30:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @TaniaArth @pablorullan Just how did he become such a billionaire? Same way so many corruptos in messed up Mexico.
908563485897875457 2017-09-14 05:29:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth @NYspanish For stupid people wanting to learn Mexico's immigration laws lookup let general de poblacion, chapter 2. That's hypocrisy exposed.
908562664183422977 2017-09-14 05:26:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth If that makes u happy. Law is there for reading.
908562498919424003 2017-09-14 05:25:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth That's fine. I know it's hard to face dark realities. Saludos.
908562301795442689 2017-09-14 05:25:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I didn't make anything up. U read more into it. Did u read the letter general de poblacion? http://www.diputados.gob.mx? Is there 3 u to read.
908561884508332032 2017-09-14 05:23:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Just curious, where did I say there is a wall between Mexico and Guatemala? I asked whether such wall was bad.
908561533227081730 2017-09-14 05:22:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I do. Been there. Other than chilangos most Mexicans r nice people. I worked w refugees back in 80s and heard horror stories about border.
908560885844647938 2017-09-14 05:19:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth It's a shame that a resources rich country depends on exporting it's social problems.
908560704445153281 2017-09-14 05:18:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Is about time Mexico fixes its own mess after decades or corruption.
908560530159280129 2017-09-14 05:18:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Again, my point as bothersome as it may b 4 u is that Mexico's demand for US to let Mexicans in at will is hypocrisy.
908559985986093057 2017-09-14 05:15:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Why don't live up to the reality of Mexico's hypocrisy on the issue? Mexico has the right to enforce borders so does US or any country.
908559654426337280 2017-09-14 05:14:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth R u a lawyer? Being from any given country doesn't mean one knows that country's laws.
908559155220246529 2017-09-14 05:12:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth R u a Mexican lawyer?
908558957341327360 2017-09-14 05:11:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth read the law and u will see this is about using fake papers to enter Mexico illegally just like they do here using fake IDs etc.
908558454171721730 2017-09-14 05:09:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth The lie is that Mexico asks from US that which they deny illegals entering their country.
908558232917909507 2017-09-14 05:08:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Just Google "ley general de poblacion Mexico" and u should find it under the Mexican Congress website. It's current law.
908557620792852481 2017-09-14 05:06:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth What? The general law of population encompasses diff aspects. Chapter II is titled migration.
908556583273086976 2017-09-14 05:02:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Mexicans make up majority of illegal immigration to US. Hypocritical self-serving criticism is shameful.
908555954416787456 2017-09-14 04:59:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Meant hypocrisy.
908555890474627072 2017-09-14 04:59:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth I can go on and on about Mexico's though immigration laws so spare me the hipocrisy.
908555748929527810 2017-09-14 04:59:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Art 33: foreigners can b deported w no due process.
908555425661952000 2017-09-14 04:57:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Art 123, 125: illegal immigration to Mexico is a felony!
908555265548607488 2017-09-14 04:57:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Art 116: fake papers in Mexico? Go to prison.
908555138951921664 2017-09-14 04:56:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Art 34: foreigners can be barred if they upset equilibrium of national demographics.
908554910416855040 2017-09-14 04:55:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Article 34 of Mexico's law on pophlation: Mexico only welcomes foreigners who will b useful to Mexican society.
908554330143309824 2017-09-14 04:53:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Also, Mexico's harsh immigration law and treatment of illegals is notorious.
908554150060761088 2017-09-14 04:52:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TaniaArth Mexican newspaper "el manana" of July 24, 2016, published an oped supporting such a wall Adelita. Mexico is within it's right to do so.
908553081595478017 2017-09-14 04:48:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thedailybeast @gabylinares Politics is the issue when an agenda dictates outcomes. Let scientists do their job without bias or predetermines outcome.
908488208052187136 2017-09-14 00:30:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Slate I learned English and find it annoying when people address me first in Spanish just based on my look.

908487233145004033 2017-09-14 00:26:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DrJillStein @joyellen1962 So u have a problem w let's say Mexico flying missiles over us? U think that's acceptable?
908486982866690048 2017-09-14 00:25:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DrJillStein @joyellen1962 NKs main export is the technology terrorists want to hurt us. NK is threat to whole region.

908395226762551296 2017-09-14 18:21:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ananavarro @mdesimone05 @JohnsonFree1 And where's special counsel on HRC, foundation, Ukraine colussion which did actually happen?

908342209141002241 2017-09-14 14:50:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ananavarro @mdesimone05 @JohnsonFree1 Bottom line 4 me is that partial criticism is being part of problem not solution. Ana is showing she's establishment lackey.

908309519381536768 2017-09-14 12:40:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JoyAnnReid @RickyT105 That says a lot about how establishment really works. Shows both parties r 2 sides of same corrupt coin.
908307313110417408 2017-09-14 12:31:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JoyAnnReid @RickyT105 Clintons have long history of corruption and acting above the law protected by establishment.

906658562235084800 2017-09-09 23:20:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin We all need to talk and listen. Both parties profit from division at our expense.
906649771850559488 2017-09-09 22:45:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin Agreed
906646676395446274 2017-09-09 22:33:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin Again, 20yrs of failure left us debt, NK, etc. Establishment's lies and failure busted door open for a populist.
906646403241398272 2017-09-09 22:32:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin Whike he rushes words at times, so far he hasn't messed up. He's done ok considering non stop media campaign against him.
906646025624018945 2017-09-09 22:30:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DineshDSouza waiting for #Irma while reading big lie.
906644964876185602 2017-09-09 22:26:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin Exactly. Until then we should work for and not against our country.
906644828510982144 2017-09-09 22:25:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin Whole theory of rigging election is foolish. Time to stop blaming Putin for disastrous HRC candidacy.
906644537556303880 2017-09-09 22:24:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin We survived Carter and W.  US bigger than party or person.
906644337928306688 2017-09-09 22:23:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin We've survived true dangerous POTUS like Woodrow Wilson and FDR who is closest we came to facism in America.
906644139617472512 2017-09-09 22:23:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin I was disappointed when Obama was reelected but respected outcome. Problem is that so called resistance is undermining democracy.

906628455835557889 2017-09-09 21:20:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin Again, when I see evidence I will consider issue.  I don't trust establishment.
906628130797969408 2017-09-09 21:19:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin DJT bid in 2010 for facility. Even if he planned to run he couldn't know he would win for sure.
906600589727059970 2017-09-09 19:29:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> I do. We all should. Let's criticize what we should and not follow propagandists.
906599317829558273 2017-09-09 19:24:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> When Muller hired so many establishment lawyers he lost my credibility.
906599133124980739 2017-09-09 19:24:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> No it isn't. Popular opinion is not legal opinion.
906598847115350016 2017-09-09 19:23:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin Look at how career pols come in broke and leave rich even Bernie is a millionaire while being a senator?
906598619171745794 2017-09-09 19:22:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin They did make money and good for them. Nothing wrong in that. Corruption is enriching through office as most establishment pols do.
906598316280041473 2017-09-09 19:20:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin U realize deal was inked in 2012 right? DJT won bid for place in 2010 or so.
906597076213125120 2017-09-09 19:16:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> I know the clause and no, Mueller will not decide but find facts. Whole things is establishment pain.
906591540562317312 2017-09-09 18:54:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin Did anybody ask Washington or Jefferson to sell their land holdings? Nope. It's no sense.
906591368730038273 2017-09-09 18:53:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin Come on, that's a serious stretch. Place has made money well before now.
906590824707891205 2017-09-09 18:51:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin Reasons r multiple. I'd love less fossil fuels but until economically feasible we must do best we can.
906590372905865216 2017-09-09 18:49:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> 
906590233206120449 2017-09-09 18:48:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Sure. Diff is that polished pols lie in style. I judge deeds and so far so good despite lunatic establishment obstructionism.
906589814635593728 2017-09-09 18:47:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> I know the issues and see no conflict yet. When. One actually arises then we can talk.
906589493263814657 2017-09-09 18:45:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Problem is not w facts but your filter of irrational anti-Trump  stance.
906589173393620992 2017-09-09 18:44:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Is wall between Mexico and Guatemala racist? I don't buy wall but do want strict border enforcement.
906588880132038656 2017-09-09 18:43:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin There's climate change, but libs use to attack capitalism is baseless.
906588711932096514 2017-09-09 18:42:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin What conflict? Real conflict was uranium deal that saw Clintons get millions.
906588488979632129 2017-09-09 18:41:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> This whole opposing Trump sounds like severe paranoia.
906588156723687424 2017-09-09 18:40:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Progressive concepts gave us segregation and lent ideological basis to Nazis. Know history or we will repeat it.
906587913823117312 2017-09-09 18:39:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> I know libs who r true racists. Racism is a disease not particular to any ideology.
906587610746941440 2017-09-09 18:38:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> I'm not GOP. I'm independent. Is DJT racist? So far I don't see evidence of that other than self-serving lib inuendo.
906542368287019008 2017-09-09 15:38:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BillyBaldwin Amazing how creepy hateful libs have become. Could care less about thousands who live in the area.

906120212130533376 2017-09-08 11:41:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @rafafc91 How about having Mexicans respect our borders? It's rather simple like Mexico does w it's own borders.

898553645729492996 2017-08-18 14:34:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @eu_eeas Hypocrisy given that liberal suicidal immigration policies r to blame for letting extremist animals into Europe.
898535454747897856 2017-08-18 13:22:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @islam If Islam were the only religion around I'd be an atheist. So much foolishness that defies basic human intelligence.
898535103269416960 2017-08-18 13:20:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @islam Islamophobia or being concerned by repeated murders by Islamic terrorists?
898534130685796352 2017-08-18 13:16:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump Mr. President I voted for you and support you but please, be more mindful of your comments. Don't feed the establishment beast please.

898532265915011074 2017-08-18 13:09:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DVATW Of course not. It's a theocratic political view where religious zealots hold the last say.
898524826012463105 2017-08-18 12:39:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nazirafzal @xricharddaviesx in recent time more than 80% of conflicts involved Islam on one or both sides. Hard fact. Why?  Islamic absolutist Intolerance.
898523481448566786 2017-08-18 12:34:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LibyaLiberty Please, in less than 4 years we have a chance to change course is so we want. Equating this w an intrinsically intolerant religion is nuts
898522964458713088 2017-08-18 12:32:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nazirafzal @xricharddaviesx Difficult thing for a literalist religion premised upon absolutism and thus intolerant.

898519059859460096 2017-08-18 12:16:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nazirafzal We should all demand an expedited ticket to hell for all terrorists. No more jail, death penalty period.

898333014307905536 2017-08-17 23:57:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Muslims should hunt Islamic terrorists and rid the world and Islam of such garbage.

898176286128041985 2017-08-17 13:34:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CillizzaCNN @mmdwriter How about those who discriminate against people w opposing views like Obama did using state to persecute others?
898175908791582720 2017-08-17 13:33:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CillizzaCNN Sure, anything for an otherwise insignificant fake newster to attempt and gain recognition.

898173364786921472 2017-08-17 13:23:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump What about communist symbols in leftist protests? Communism killed 100M.

898161150864613377 2017-08-17 12:34:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DynaMoChen U said it, they chose. violently tearing down is not about choices buy demeaning an otherwise worthy idea.
898160751982071809 2017-08-17 12:33:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DynaMoChen It healed. It's only political demagogues who profit by raising up a long dead past.
898160587510775808 2017-08-17 12:32:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DynaMoChen Why? Democratic party owns slavery and segregation or didn't they teach u that in school?
898159952459681792 2017-08-17 12:29:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Catacam12 Shouldn't we ban Islam and communism symbols?

898139854827122689 2017-08-17 11:10:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DNC @TheDemocrats Funny how Dem POTUS Woodrow Wilson gave kkk new life and Dems fought against civil rights.
898139632600264704 2017-08-17 11:09:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DNC lesson of the day, Dem POTUS Woodrow Wilson gave kkk new life. Dems fought civil rights period.
898138988795580416 2017-08-17 11:06:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CillizzaCNN He said both sides are equally to blame for violence. True. Remember Milwaukee, Dallas, that's the lib left and they were in Charlottesville
898138581784563713 2017-08-17 11:04:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CillizzaCNN @JHenderson330 Very easy, leave it to propagandists who can turn even the Pope's words into something else.
898138324858281984 2017-08-17 11:03:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CillizzaCNN No. GOP establishment pols r part of the fake system destroying our country.

898133770754293760 2017-08-17 10:45:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @VanJones68 @SusanSmith_1964 What's with crying Dems? They promote division for political gain so their tears have the stench of fault.
898133244759220224 2017-08-17 10:43:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Nysteveo2AOLcom He should go and apologize for damage done by promoting racial division for political gain. This is also his legacy.
898132982061572096 2017-08-17 10:42:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GeorgeTakei Milwaukee, Dallas, BLM, Obama responses while POTUS should be accounted for George. He failed miserably and left a divided country.

898130722690666496 2017-08-17 10:33:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ProgressOutlook Obama is an empty suit marketed to fools who fell for it.
898129910853709825 2017-08-17 10:30:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @ColumbusShort1 He did that. Problem 4 many is he didn't give equally hienous antifa and BLM a free pass.
898129674055933953 2017-08-17 10:29:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GovernorVA @bill_auclair While BLM and antifa get a pass?

896699263534735361 2017-08-13 11:45:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BarackObama @jules_su You mean Reagan? He was last such leader. All following allowed NK and hate groups to fester.
896698061489143808 2017-08-13 11:40:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @VladTrumpJr There is evil and idiots on every side. This guy is as bad as some BLM or antifa thugs.
896697300831154177 2017-08-13 11:37:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @beels Who seemingly voted for Bernie?
896551265823588352 2017-08-12 01:57:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DrinkinginJapan No. They control Congress & Senate. DJT is not republican establishment so they don't fully support him but fear the base that elected him
896402457215070209 2017-08-12 16:06:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @rohitguptahpf @asmuniz That would be ideal to counteract China ambitions.
896402142839353345 2017-08-12 16:04:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> It will come to pass cause China ambitions to dominate the region.

896400528476864512 2017-08-12 15:58:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CCTV To copy is to invent?
896400222301171712 2017-08-12 15:57:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CCTV Whole thing would be avoided if China kept their lapdog under control. China allowing NK getting nukes is irresponsible and plain dumb.
896350396737826818 2017-08-12 12:39:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Nuclear threats by mad man is no reason?

896343147814543360 2017-08-12 12:10:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill Yes there is. What isn't there is decisiviness of whimp European leadership.
896342305589927938 2017-08-12 12:07:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CCTV @TheresaAFallon Typical propaganda bs. China could reign NK in if they wanted. Trusting China is dumb.
896342066569121792 2017-08-12 12:06:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Dr_G_Enigma Yeah restraint has led to nuclear NK. Listening to China on this is dumb. China could stop NK if it wanted.

896202520502181889 2017-08-11 02:51:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu All u do is leech some recognition by trolling POTUS. Don't u have an actual, real job to do? Congress ratings r below toilet level.
896202193585438721 2017-08-11 02:50:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tribelaw So, if Muller finds squat them what? How r u going to explain your fabrications?

895987278635343873 2017-08-11 12:36:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @seungminkim Seriously? It seems quite clear to this non-reporter.

895628597309960193 2017-08-10 12:51:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @jeremycorbyn your pusillanimous critic of Maduro shows left lacks moral clarity and is a danger to freedom.
895628162377424897 2017-08-10 12:49:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @garyfoskett @fizzygal61 NK has detonated nukes already. Missed that one?
895628023243956224 2017-08-10 12:48:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @johnnymup @garyfoskett NK has already proven it's nuclear capacity. Iraq never did.  Wake up.
895627789298171904 2017-08-10 12:47:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @garyfoskett So you want confirmation? I was against Iraq war but NK is diff animal
895627527200415744 2017-08-10 12:46:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tedlieu Which begs the question why did Clinton-Bush-Obama allowed NK to get nukes!!
895625916080148480 2017-08-10 12:40:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill This from one part of chain of error govt that left this mess behind?

895067131166941184 2017-08-08 23:40:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NateSilver538 Was it good politics to allow circumstances for war? Odumbo left a bigger mess in all corners of world 4 future generations to resolve

894637920040235008 2017-08-07 19:14:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @darionavarro111 Apparently? So much for judicious reasoning.

893760264197296128 2017-08-05 09:07:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill McCain is sadly acting as the unhinged desperate irrelevant politician he's been since losing to Obama
893759991424983041 2017-08-05 09:06:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @politicalmiller Of course, flood of Dems plantation workers, universal crap care, and higher wages w less jobs.

893099574948225025 2017-08-03 13:21:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @OneAngryFist @oakzar Fyi, Cuba was more developed than other LA countries b4 Fidel. Wasn't perfect but was more developed. Fidel killed all that.
893099370375069696 2017-08-03 13:20:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @OneAngryFist @oakzar There r 2 Cuba, like 2 NK, 1 for tourists and other for Cubans. Fidel destroyed Cuba.
893098896079155200 2017-08-03 13:19:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @OneAngryFist @oakzar So on what basis u talk about w such certainty?
893097589851258882 2017-08-03 13:13:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @OneAngryFist @oakzar Btw, I have. 4 times so let's talk reality over educationAl malfeance.
893097100950593538 2017-08-03 13:11:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @OneAngryFist @oakzar Have u been to Cuba? Not the staged beaches and tourist areas but away from those?
893064720785301504 2017-08-03 11:03:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @OneAngryFist how many millions has radical Islam killed? Islamofacism is a threat.
893060458600701952 2017-08-03 10:46:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @OneAngryFist @LatentChrist The Last imperialist country was the USSR not America.
893060191675191301 2017-08-03 10:45:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @oakzar @spnbmb That's not political it's criminal.
893060075719446528 2017-08-03 10:44:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @oakzar @spnbmb No comparison. People imprisoned in US for crimes not political disent otherwise u all would be in jail as u would in Cuba.
893059721527267328 2017-08-03 10:43:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @elliotsharron @oakzar One must wonder why Fidel called European doctors for his care if Cuban medicine is so advanced.
893059432808148992 2017-08-03 10:42:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @oakzar @elliotsharron She has to repeat the fallacies that desperate commies need to say to validate the historical failures of communism.
893059126502313984 2017-08-03 10:41:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @OneAngryFist @oakzar Cuba is a prison where dissent is punished. A system with no freedom is a system not worth living under.
892718020178710528 2017-08-02 12:05:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Slate @ginawhite1968 It's hard to still be shocked how personal hatred. Of DJT cause HRC loss leads libs to utter lunacy.
892717715680620544 2017-08-02 12:04:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Slate Sorry but there's nothing preventing us from such rate of growth other than self-imposed hindrances like burdening tax structure.
892702522154110977 2017-08-02 11:04:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AfricanaCarr So NK threats as they pursue forceful reunification of SK is not the threat?
892702200975290369 2017-08-02 11:02:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> China is a rational regime like ussr or Russia. NK is not.
892701993470500866 2017-08-02 11:01:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Exactly which is why only a moron could tolerate a mad man getting nukes. Kim is a mad man and us burying our heads is suicidal.
892701666457374720 2017-08-02 11:00:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> That's insane, NK threatens the world and u think our rightful response is the threat?
892701353742655488 2017-08-02 10:59:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @olgaNYC1211 So much nonsense 
892701154903281664 2017-08-02 10:58:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tedlieu We need regime change or this threat will never end. China should want one to a more controlled puppet.
892700830914281473 2017-08-02 10:57:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu What diplomatic solution would work when all failed for decades? Remember Chamberlain-Hitler episode.
892700626739769345 2017-08-02 10:56:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenFeinstein @benfrancis What diplomatic solution would work when all failed for decades?
892700526261006336 2017-08-02 10:56:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenFeinstein @stevendupler @silverthornn264 What diplomatic solution would work when all failed for decades?
892700467653947392 2017-08-02 10:55:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenFeinstein @LoveUSAPeople What diplomatic solution would work when all failed for decades?
892699856329990147 2017-08-02 10:53:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenFeinstein What diplomatic solution exactly? Been trying that for years and result is NK is a greater danger today. Nobody likes war but.....?
892695534590361602 2017-08-02 10:36:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ananavarro @PioBall @oakzar Also nobody talks communism today but it's bastardy sister socialism. Name games for same stuff.
892695208751661059 2017-08-02 10:34:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ananavarro @PioBall @oakzar Well u know meaning of liberal is twisted in America. Traditional libs r against Marxism but leftist progressive like Sanders don't.
892537872171118592 2017-08-01 00:09:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ananavarro @PioBall @oakzar In the fairy tales of lib colleges? Sure. I know the speech, hasn't changed since the cold war.  Same old lies.

892382856235937796 2017-08-01 13:53:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @VicenteFoxQue @marcantoniant I lived in Canada have family there and am sorry for how ON and PQ manhandle rest of Canada.
892382584579272706 2017-08-01 13:52:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @VicenteFoxQue @MarkDice @BondJaneBond001 @ChristInCenter Huh? I thought being American made this our land.
892382253271175168 2017-08-01 13:51:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @VicenteFoxQue Still around? Why not work in solving your countrys mess which u contributed to create?
892352416385036288 2017-08-01 11:52:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KatCapps @ananavarro @gordiz63 @asturiasptr @DavidHaroldFin2 Socialism and corruption are perfect match to imprison and kill democracy. History shows this again and again.
892352075534872577 2017-08-01 11:51:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ananavarro @PioBall @oakzar Venezuelan regime like all socialist regimes is profoundly corrupt. Marxist creatures left trail of 100M deaths through it's putrid history
892351392685449216 2017-08-01 11:48:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ananavarro @PioBall Send in the Marines.
892351285869125632 2017-08-01 11:48:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ananavarro Missing the days US would send Marines to take out the trash.
892351098312433665 2017-08-01 11:47:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CanadaFP Denounce and condemn. Sure Venezuelan thugs r shaking in their boots. Missing days US sent Marines to take out trash.
892018352322998272 2017-07-31 13:45:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RollingStone Going back to mag roots? Image over substance? Trudeau is pretty boy ran by lib elites in Canada. Just like Obama was.
892017919076560896 2017-07-31 13:43:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @merlisa So long as any group keeps hiding behind race to avoid legitimate serious debate we can't move forward.
892017640046301184 2017-07-31 13:42:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @merlisa I think history will place Obama as mediocre POTUS not cause of race but cause his results are terrible.
892017445011169281 2017-07-31 13:41:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @merlisa And as such he was eligible to be POTUS.
892017336278020096 2017-07-31 13:41:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @merlisa I still don't know if Obama was born in US soil or not. Sealed Hawaii records raised red flag. But I think he's natural born citizen.
892016980450041856 2017-07-31 13:39:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @merlisa Birtherism is a valid question raised re Romney's dad, McCain, Obama and Ted Cruz. It's about meaning of "natural born citizen"
892016676031660032 2017-07-31 13:38:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @merlisa Depends on who says it and why. We should be free of own race trap so as not to bundle everybody as racist.
891992944814817282 2017-07-31 12:04:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DuckSpeech Having lived through fake democracy I know a lie when I see one.
891992674542243841 2017-07-31 12:03:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Sentletse You are either a Marxist loon, a junkie, or mentally ill. There's no democracy in Venezuela.
891991003925798913 2017-07-31 11:56:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Morning_Joe @colwds Well isis is pretty much done. Nato allies ponied up the $ they should pay. Could move faster but I'll take that over leadind from behind
891989512347426816 2017-07-31 11:50:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lawrence @MaddowBlog Why? He can be fired. Let's talk real swamp investigation about both parties colluding 4 decades to profit at our peril.
891988821700726784 2017-07-31 11:48:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LeoKapakosNY Republicans? They acted as the establishment scum they are. Establishment politicians of both parties r traitors to the republic.
891988475444068354 2017-07-31 11:46:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @brandonlancast2 Mika's only claim is to be Daddy's girl. She is an idiot.

891987863532965889 2017-07-31 11:44:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LoserDonald2016 @FightNowAmerica @MollyKat94 @erichubert79 He, his brother and sister we're heirs to a fortune. He turned his share into billions through real estate.
891987638546247680 2017-07-31 11:43:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LoserDonald2016 @FightNowAmerica @erichubert79 Disliking DJT is one thing. Distorting his biz record another. He is a successful bizman period.
891987295959744512 2017-07-31 11:41:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LoserDonald2016 Failed as bizman? Just how many companies and billions have you made?
891987041227067392 2017-07-31 11:40:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Morning_Joe America must be superpower not pretend to be likeable bimbo like recent POTUS tried w failing results.
891986438555914240 2017-07-31 11:38:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @hapkidobigdad @merlisa I know a few Latino and blacks who did just that. Obama was a huge letdown.
891986018500579328 2017-07-31 11:36:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @merlisa He attacked a failing POTUS. Enough using Obama's race as excuse or diversion.
891672719770755074 2017-07-30 14:51:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MaxineWaters Fact that  people like u, who have good healthcare at taxpayers expense think it's a game, that is pathetic.
891658888638025728 2017-07-30 13:56:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HuffPostPol When it comes to rabid dogs? Put them down. Ms13 and other gang members r rabid dogs like  fanatical terrorists.
891449292350779392 2017-07-29 00:04:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Newsweek Obama had Dems with him. DJT has bipartisan establishment snakes against him.
891448435316056065 2017-07-29 00:00:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytpolitics Funny how libs get easily bent out of shape by this but do squat when the gang animals kill innocent.
891448011871715328 2017-07-29 23:59:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Slate The only moral rot is that of bipartisan establishment McCain embodies. Lie to get elected.
891397605531557890 2017-07-29 20:38:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @maryaliceparks @ABCPolitics Allies work together. Dems want to shove their way upon us & rinos like McCain need to go.
891089704363462658 2017-07-28 00:15:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @Good_Vibesonly4 I'm well informed about historical, systemic, and other reasons why we r in debt. We must return to fiscal sanity in all fronts.
891069033201766400 2017-07-28 22:53:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @piersmorgan @therealzafshah @BodeyAM What has England degraded into? Rule of law has become tyranny of law by arrogant elites.
891068794600402945 2017-07-28 22:52:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @piersmorgan @therealzafshah @BodeyAM If parents want to try and get medical help abroad it's unfathomable that state would have a say.
891050740210429952 2017-07-28 21:40:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @piersmorgan @therealzafshah @BodeyAM How would anyone know now? Parents not state should decide.
891050567459581958 2017-07-28 21:39:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @piersmorgan @therealzafshah @BodeyAM Which is why they blocked parents right to choose? 
891050376019021825 2017-07-28 21:38:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @piersmorgan May God have him in His glory. Bad that parents had to fight govt over decisions re care.
891049895091679232 2017-07-28 21:37:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ananavarro About time. They, like u, r establishment hacks more interested in biz as usual in DC swamp.
890952183402856448 2017-07-28 15:08:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ananavarro @Huy0122 I won't question your preferences here. I just want politicians to actually do what they campaigned on.
890899934601523202 2017-07-28 11:41:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ananavarro So, didn't he advance the bill only to vote no on it for pure grandstanding? Tired of rinos.
890899662282141697 2017-07-28 11:40:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNNPolitics So, they actually voted with the party they really belong with?
890885683845451776 2017-07-28 10:44:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @Good_Vibesonly4 I believe in respecting others. I might disagree w others on moral grounds but I leave judgment to God.
890885434682855424 2017-07-28 10:43:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @Good_Vibesonly4 Well it's a real issue. I have right to own a gun but don't expect you to buy it for me just cause I have that right.
890690090216951808 2017-07-27 21:47:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @DTrumpExposed @BeansTown106 @RickReut @MTicktin Agreed. We needed our allies to snap out of their lull and contribute their fair share but allies we do need.
890686374181044225 2017-07-27 21:32:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @DTrumpExposed @BeansTown106 @RickReut @MTicktin Then count me in. Peace through strength. 
890673567364403201 2017-07-27 20:41:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @Good_Vibesonly4 Should you pay for someone else's nose or boob job? That what this boils down to.
890673352037122048 2017-07-27 20:40:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @DTrumpExposed @BeansTown106 @RickReut @MTicktin Sure but detente is better than being naively disarmed hoping for best.

890650007400992768 2017-07-27 19:08:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @Good_Vibesonly4 Didn't mean that. Live and let live but at each individual's expense.

890568213326688256 2017-07-27 13:43:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HillaryClinton @nowthisnews @impeach_d_trump  thanks for the laugh. Honest? Honorable? If maddoff is the standard, sure.
890567365137760256 2017-07-27 13:39:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nowthisnews @susiemcdonnell @USuckDT Preorder in library discarded books as that's where that trash belongs.
890567151437971456 2017-07-27 13:38:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nowthisnews What happened? Crooked HRC is rightfully distrusted. Dems were nuts by thinking she would win.
890566486343000066 2017-07-27 13:36:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @DTrumpExposed @BeansTown106 @MTicktin @RickReut So much theatrics. Ocare killed quality and is unaffordable and unsustainable without more taxes.
890566217848811520 2017-07-27 13:35:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @DTrumpExposed When there is actionable evidence let us know until then enjoy conspiracy fake news theories.
890566045387436033 2017-07-27 13:34:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @DTrumpExposed It's easy if Dems stop forging the govt dependency plantations to ensure votes.
890526067135524866 2017-07-27 10:55:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @Good_Vibesonly4 Between $2.4-$8.4 million spent so far in such "cosmetic" procedures is not imaginary. Military should not be social experimentation unit.
890347256548917254 2017-07-26 23:05:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AErinalex I read portions of hr 3590 and legislative history. Why? Cause that's what we lawyers do for a living. Read this stuff.
890347009298886660 2017-07-26 23:04:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AErinalex Funny thing is that the full name of hr 3590 is patient protection and affordable Care act.guess you didn't quite know full name either.
890345911049760769 2017-07-26 22:59:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AErinalex Sure, if rush tweeting in the middle of prepping appellate docs makes me ignorant in your eyes, enjoy.
890345517250727936 2017-07-26 22:58:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AErinalex That's why I chose to come here. Our individual duty is to provide for ourselves and families first. Hard to do with DC social engineering
890324484959457281 2017-07-26 21:34:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AErinalex I probably know more about than you do. Great day.
890324345029091329 2017-07-26 21:33:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AErinalex You mean free taxpayers money? I ask for a job not giveaways. I don't want to work to see my money stolen by DC.
890324093693808641 2017-07-26 21:33:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AErinalex I would like to see Obama and his gang live the rich life in Miami with such income.
890320082089508865 2017-07-26 21:17:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AErinalex Unless subsidized by rich people which here in Florida means those earning about $36k per yr or more.
890319739834204167 2017-07-26 21:15:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AErinalex Nope. I don't watch cable junk. Too much propaganda from all sides. It's misleading because it's not affordable at all
890255627313975300 2017-07-26 17:00:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNN To fake news CNN $2M may mean nothing but to us taxpayers is plenty.
890255408572530688 2017-07-26 17:00:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump Issue is that libs wanted taxpayers to pay for sex change procedures.
890255231182921728 2017-07-26 16:59:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TheEllenShow Not when taxpayers r expected to fork the bill for surgery. Its not about discrimination.
890247219105935363 2017-07-26 16:27:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AErinalex Official misleading name of the  affordable healthcare act better known as obamacare.
890169558769836032 2017-07-26 11:18:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AErinalex Racist? This brown Latino legal immigrant demands garbage AHA replaced so I can have insurance again.
890169308940296192 2017-07-26 11:17:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @Mindpollution3 Tax breaks? I just want healthcare http://ins.like the one AHA stole from me.
890168998603653120 2017-07-26 11:16:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @DonBigger It's nice when she doesn't have to rely on AHA garbage for her own healthcare.
890168827291602944 2017-07-26 11:16:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill Country elected GOP on promise to repeat cause AHA is a Dems fraud.
890030514345848832 2017-07-25 02:06:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LindseyGrahamSC Why? Clinton emails & foundation should've been investigated long time ago. Fact it hasn't is stain to our democracy and justice.
890028735457579008 2017-07-25 01:59:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AdamSchiffCA Well sir, where's the beef? Either bring evidence of crime or stop obstructing just cause your party lost.
889832126480347136 2017-07-25 12:58:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sherrishavon Doe the America depending on govt? Nothing but push them for freedom of Dems new plantation.
889831843486453760 2017-07-25 12:56:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sherrishavon With establishment and lib press with him even goofy would pass as great POTUS. Obama had that, DJT doesn't.
889831583250886656 2017-07-25 12:55:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChrisJZullo Since ocare robbed me of ins I'm self-paid. Better than ever w catastrophic coverage only.
889831381597028352 2017-07-25 12:55:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChrisJZullo Why? Reset to pre-ocare when things were not as bad as under ocare. Then deal w Medicaid for those truly needing it.
889831005774901248 2017-07-25 12:53:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sherrishavon Remember it was Dems who passing ocare exempted themselves from it. Why was that if I ocare is so "good?"
889830592094904320 2017-07-25 12:52:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sherrishavon Ocare stole my plan and Drs. It was a lie, a fraud. A buy votes scheme of Dems.
889296308489646080 2017-07-23 01:28:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @peenyweeny1218 Working with nasty regimes is diff from taking their $ like Clintons did.

889294515886071808 2017-07-23 01:21:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Well your support for two thugs says a lot about u. Not good things though.

889292101422387204 2017-07-23 01:12:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tonyposnanski Who cares? EC is the rule.

889290513177825280 2017-07-23 01:05:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @peenyweeny1218 They do and from countries that kill women, gays,etc.
889289873097621506 2017-07-23 01:03:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DineshDSouza Why the surprise? Politicians 
889289268035760128 2017-07-23 01:00:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JesseBWatters @ElleBird4 Funny how yesterday success stories r now losers to loonie libs.
889289103497449472 2017-07-23 01:00:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JesseBWatters Hmm, that shot kinda evokes Nicholson's joker in Batman. Give them heck mucci.
889222063730438147 2017-07-23 20:33:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DineshDSouza @RitaPanahi Dumb heroic. Getting killed for a few bucks is nuts. Cashiers r instructed to give $ to avoid major incident. He could've got someone shot.
888885621955186689 2017-07-22 22:17:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Pamela_Moore13 We are sick of it. Why? Cause nobody likes whinny losers.

888884965324316672 2017-07-22 22:14:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DrJillStein @philosophrob @TheCowardDonald Why nitwits? Why do libs fo nuts when they lose?
888884350770716674 2017-07-22 22:11:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DrJillStein @TheCowardDonald @philosophrob That goes to CA. Thank goodness for EC that safeguards us all from being held hostage by few states.
888883895734865922 2017-07-22 22:10:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DrJillStein That's first thing I can agree with you.
888861797893251072 2017-07-22 20:42:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PuestoLoco Impeachment is not a way to remedy election loss.
888856461006315520 2017-07-22 20:21:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ResistNowvc @thehill @Ginmato Let's see, law degree, check MBA, check, uneducated? Don't think so. Sorry the lib koolaid is not quite true.
888750825878806528 2017-07-22 13:21:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ResistNowvc @thehill @Ginmato True as lib loons want propaganda not journalism. CNN & MSNBC appeal mostly to dumbed down libs.
888750495292149761 2017-07-22 13:20:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @halomoma More importantly she went to intolerant lib media/public. Funny how lib commentators accepted and do well at Fox.
888750257764532224 2017-07-22 13:19:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @a750hp Another "tolerant" lib 
888750039258066945 2017-07-22 13:18:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @willhoite75 True. Lib media and public are intolerant. Funny how fox does open to lib commentators who do well there.
888749769014771712 2017-07-22 13:17:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill Now that's funny. How much lower can she go b4 she's canned?
888557010119262208 2017-07-21 00:31:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DineshDSouza @DailyCaller Great, a good school to get a degree in stupidology.
888556268562128897 2017-07-21 00:28:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AllenWest This lady is definitely nuts.
888555601504198657 2017-07-21 00:25:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNN @DineshDSouza @YoungDems4Trump Finally, something they just may be correct about.
888555311036076033 2017-07-21 00:24:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @dcexaminer He looks pretty old to put his advice to use. Just wondering if he will volunteer for "science" sake.

888376078817013761 2017-07-21 12:32:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi Adding trillions in debt to create mirage economy is not something I would be proud of but libs have twisted sense of success.
888375351595999233 2017-07-21 12:29:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus No wonder many want aljazeera shut down. It's not news, it's propaganda.
888374841828573184 2017-07-21 12:27:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SallyQYates Haven't get yourself new job? Move on lady. We got enough of your partisan bickering.

888374217607188480 2017-07-21 12:24:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RepAdamSchiff If he can investigate DJT 9 yr old deals, how come u don't ask to investigate Clinton deals over past 8 years?
888358546487881728 2017-07-21 11:22:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @EricHolder An endorsement by Holder means Mueller must go. A Capo's endorsement cant be good.

888357508938694656 2017-07-21 11:18:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @peterdaou @bonitarosekemp We did. This is why DJT is POTUS. GOP/Dem establishment failed us. We can't take anymore DC garbage.
888357235214217216 2017-07-21 11:17:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @peterdaou @TGAND4 When they are wrong vet or not should be put in place.
888357059816763392 2017-07-21 11:16:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @peterdaou All his past don't excuse the witch hunt he's running w Dem partisan insiders.

887991264834191360 2017-07-20 11:03:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FBI @Kate_Is_Rising @JoyAnnReid Joy the hack continues her servile Dem propaganda. As if Obama misuse of govt wasn't  true dark enough.
887860813092007936 2017-07-19 02:24:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MarkHarrisNYC And two types of patients, those w ocare mediocrity and politicians who legislate better coverage for themselves at our expense.
887860314901016577 2017-07-19 02:22:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @AAPsyc It seems shameful has gone around a bit. McCain's illness warrants our sympathy but doesn't hide his successes and failures.
887859695641350147 2017-07-19 02:20:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Cameron_Gray But, why?
887738600728801286 2017-07-19 18:19:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus Not that I even watch the show but why call racist anything and everything? It trivializes the actual racism.
887687898530709504 2017-07-19 14:57:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @stopthenutjob Unelected? Purging dead or illegal voting is bad news for who? DNC?
887687082956738560 2017-07-19 14:54:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenFranken @ProperlySane BTW, investigate Clinton foundation, uranium deal, unmasking, all of it. Expose all political roaches.
887686835979395072 2017-07-19 14:53:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenFranken @ProperlySane Investigate and if evidence does show up then charge. Period. Until then let's focus on issues at hand.
887686686209179649 2017-07-19 14:52:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenFranken @ProperlySane Evidence of what? Collusion? That's Dems wild goose chase.
887686409741635588 2017-07-19 14:51:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @ProperlySane Sure but we r paying ours mortaging them. DC does this all the time, kick issues  down he road.
887660194846703616 2017-07-19 13:07:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @ProperlySane AHA under any name must be ditched. Mortgaging future generations is plain wrong.
887659812674293760 2017-07-19 13:06:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DianeC0710 They didn't do what voters told them to do. They only acted to save their career. Mortgaging future generations is just plain wrong.
887659467764097025 2017-07-19 13:04:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @XennialsMatter They put their re-election ahead of what must be done. Mortgaging future generations is shameful.

887631114231308289 2017-07-19 11:12:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JJohnson2u @ajplus @PAWarnhoff They told that same thing to Bush, HRC, and Obama. We're they all also too stupid to understand?
887630801793372161 2017-07-19 11:10:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus What did u expect from lackeys of corrupt dictators? About time to put pressure for Maduro et al to go.
887630013096484864 2017-07-19 11:07:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @WhoseRyanStiles @Daggers91 It's not. It's irresponsible to simply mortgage future generations for another big govt entitlement program.

887531249711165440 2017-07-18 04:35:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Hmm, did you remind Obama about the immigration laws he neglected to enforce?
887531037005406208 2017-07-18 04:34:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Betterw05759703 @wokeluisa @Marjori87941817 Teddy the same one who asked soviets for help  to defeat Reagan? That traitor?
887530873473708032 2017-07-18 04:33:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @wokeluisa How would you know? I know dictatorship and you need to learn more before you write nonsense.
887530665775960064 2017-07-18 04:32:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BrianKarem I voted for DJT and will fend for myself as I didn't come to America to be in the Dems economic plantation.
887530378847817728 2017-07-18 04:31:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @steffi3 Only way is to increase debt for future generations. That is shameful.
887530201672032257 2017-07-18 04:31:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @wokeluisa So how come millions didn't die or go bankrupt before ocare?
887530018859102208 2017-07-18 04:30:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sahluwal Ah the histrionics. Did millions die before ocare? Nope.
887529756706689025 2017-07-18 04:29:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @WhoseRyanStiles @Daggers91 By whatever name the thing is garbage for too many middle class taxpayers.
887529501034467328 2017-07-18 04:28:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @WhoseRyanStiles @DaveyRatzer Affordable? My premiums tripled and deductible went from $1500 to $7500. That's affordable? 
887529074217897984 2017-07-18 04:26:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TerryMcAuliffe But, is it my duty to pay for other people's healthcare while ocare stole my own ins.?
887528784110473216 2017-07-18 04:25:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DearAuntCrabby It works for people getting free or subsidized ins. But not for middle class.
887528196178161664 2017-07-18 04:23:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tonyposnanski Uninsured thanks to ocare? People like me don't count or what?
887520578101497856 2017-07-18 03:52:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @marclamonthill Since belief and fact are not the same, u messed up here.
887519502451298305 2017-07-18 03:48:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP GOP has failed us miserably and on purpose. Establishment elites of both parties Colluding while working class suffers.
887518753377931265 2017-07-18 03:45:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris Fight? You mean grandstanding while we working class go down hill?
887518512348090368 2017-07-18 03:44:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lawrence If you do how would we know? Fake newster.
887197001976295424 2017-07-17 06:27:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LindseyGrahamSC @the_amphibian Ocare is unsustainable. It was a bad solution to a bad situation.
887196677995679744 2017-07-17 06:25:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @leahmcelrath And ocare doesn't deliver that. Premiums/deductible through the roof for mediocre care.
887196305092730880 2017-07-17 06:24:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @leahmcelrath Only time Obama's race comes I to play is when lib Dems being it up. Typical defense when real defenses don't exist.
887192165662806016 2017-07-17 06:07:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus Such idiotic priest, should study Islamic invasion of Europe that led to crusades and otomans lining up w Germany in WWI.
887191837131329536 2017-07-17 06:06:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus Talking about invasions, Islam spreaded by invasion and conquest. Got pushed back and it will occur again.
887191022035456000 2017-07-17 06:03:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @MZse7en I admire Ali not because of his religion but of his status as a sports icon. Thus I don't care about his religious beliefs.

887189945584144387 2017-07-17 05:59:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus It's because we don't care. See, he is a sports not religious icon. Tired of Islamic victim complex.
887189459837603840 2017-07-17 05:57:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ThisIsAmerica Of those in power happen to be right then should journalists be on the wrong side? Ramos is a moron. As a Latino, he doesn't represent me.
887114389412773889 2017-07-17 00:58:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @calebhannan It's an inconvenient truth for Dem lib news establishment.
887049942535208960 2017-07-17 20:42:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mitchellvii @john_babers Starting w her cold-hearted attitude describing her role in the rapist Taylor case? everything.
886925830177394689 2017-07-17 12:29:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @neeratanden @lawhawk Hmm, I'm none of those as all Latinos I know who voted for DJT, so much for your premise.
886925547888152576 2017-07-17 12:28:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mitchellvii @john_babers I voted DJT out of concern about SCOTUS and yes, would never vote HRC. no hate, just that I'm old enough to know Clinton's history.
886925147889954816 2017-07-17 12:26:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNN @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @zenithguy If true, neither do the Clintons, Obama, and many others in DC swamp. CNN is certainly devoid of ethical compass.
886924758935384065 2017-07-17 12:25:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @rjimenezu We r both angry and optimistic. World will feel consequences of change from pusillanimous to firm leadership.
886923943780777985 2017-07-17 12:22:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LisaMarieBoothe @yashar Metaphorically true but in reality she wouldn't as she is Clinton's hope of returning to power. It's the Corleones of politics.
886745516041752576 2017-07-16 00:33:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AccActivist Come on, she hasn't. Clinton foundation stinks to high heaven. It's time we put selfish partisanship and restore our democracy.
886716784769994752 2017-07-16 22:38:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AccActivist Establishment career pols of both parties cover for ea other. We'll never see Clintons duly investigated for their crimes.
886716417999032322 2017-07-16 22:37:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AccActivist Which story?
886710251030024193 2017-07-16 22:12:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AccActivist Me too. If they r found at fault to jail with them but also HRC, lynch, all the crooks in DC.
886710040954101760 2017-07-16 22:12:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AccActivist What u guys call collusion is what obama/HRC did with Ukraine just last year. Without honesty we can't save our democracy.
886709732609839104 2017-07-16 22:10:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AccActivist What's with the followers thing? I don't ask or care if people follow me or not. I'm here to discuss ideas and not on behalf of anybody.
886709426513694721 2017-07-16 22:09:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AccActivist Point is that both Dems and GOP get I bed with the devil. It shouldn't happen but it does and only issue now?
886702383903932416 2017-07-16 21:41:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AccActivist Re ocare, I don't care the name just that it works. Ocare made bad things worse for many.
886702100759150592 2017-07-16 21:40:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AccActivist Google these terms: "Ted Kennedy USSR Reagan help" then we can talk about what treason really is.
886674413449596928 2017-07-16 19:50:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill Au contraire, Dems r in mess because we get it's core message and reject an American Europe.
886674128979316737 2017-07-16 19:49:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @repjoecrowley @thehill @ResistTilDeath @DebbieDawn58 Funny given that ocare robbed me and millions of middle class of our healthcare while subsidizing Dems electorate.
886673545329299456 2017-07-16 19:47:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill @AccActivist That shows how out of touch with middle America Dems and libs are. We taxpayers don't want ocare & know Dems real collusion for money.
886637446343135233 2017-07-16 17:23:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus Stop watching CNN, MSNBC, or reading NY times to start bringing an end to fake news.
886636788391038976 2017-07-16 17:20:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenWarren A pow wow (no pun intended) with like minded loons is not democracy. It's a nuthouse.
886636369568837633 2017-07-16 17:19:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus That's easy to resolve: PP can split it's abortion mill from health services but they won't. Too much $ by murdering babies.
886635893192372224 2017-07-16 17:17:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Cosmopolitan This is the type of idiocy that puts gay lobby and libs at odds with rest of us. Live and learn live.
886618087742742529 2017-07-16 16:06:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @srgLIVEinHD SCOTUS seats are not owned.
886550140705804289 2017-07-16 11:36:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MessengerAndrew @blinkingabyss Which actions? Economy doing better and that may offset his penchant for Twitter faux pas.
886549748689375232 2017-07-16 11:35:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MessengerAndrew Devastating? Only if one is desperately rooting against him. Never heard of this lady and her thoughts mean nada here.
886549247440637952 2017-07-16 11:33:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidmackau He certainly couldn't say it about Ms Bishop. Is that her being jealous?
886548956523704320 2017-07-16 11:31:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PatsKarvelas That explains why she did it. Problem is, who is she? We don't care about her opinion here.
886548448186687488 2017-07-16 11:29:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CillizzaCNN In another time perhaps but now media is reduced to propagandists. CNN & MSNBC amongst worst.
886411292474527744 2017-07-15 02:24:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ScottLimbrick Another leech trying to gain notoriety on DJT.
886389344738705412 2017-07-15 00:57:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill I jus don't understand the lunacy of this lady.
886385490198503424 2017-07-15 00:42:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HillaryClinton @ConcerndConser @funder @azresist @mskane2u Earned? I think you missed civics classes altogether.
886385318894743552 2017-07-15 00:41:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RussiaCollusion @funder Losing the election has left many libs beyond unhinged. This one is a special nutcase.
886384736419053568 2017-07-15 00:39:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RussiaCollusion @robreiner Rob, Dems and GOP play with the devil. What about Obama/Russia, HRC/Ukraine? Whole thing stinks. Drain the swamp.
886384292233859072 2017-07-15 00:37:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RussiaCollusion @thehill Lame Comey. All for a fist full of dollars.
886383590019354624 2017-07-15 00:34:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Alyssa_Milano Huh, what collusion? Only one proven so far is Obama WH with Ukraine. Any thoughts on that one?
886361251118501888 2017-07-15 23:06:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Now? You tell me. Morsi was jailed and others as well I guess.
886355406628556800 2017-07-15 22:42:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Well politically he was leaning to extremists. Not a smart thing to do with Egypt.
886348460533977097 2017-07-15 22:15:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LilaGraceRose Scratch that as a never move to State.
886347973948473344 2017-07-15 22:13:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk I know of many scientists who believe weird stuff. Don't understand why.
886314117484687362 2017-07-15 19:58:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk What some people do in name of God while they are on the way to hell.
886297799763136512 2017-07-15 18:53:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Sad.
886297705114456064 2017-07-15 18:53:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Well other than people who believe in it, would tell you so.
886286841179144192 2017-07-15 18:10:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk I know not all Muslims agree with genital mutilation but some do I the name of religion.
886286699671801858 2017-07-15 18:09:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk We just had a Muslim doctor arrested for mutilation of girls under some twisted form of Islamic belief. Me? Jailed them for life.
886282759337107458 2017-07-15 17:54:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk I fear the Islamic ideas that see stoning anybody like gays as a threat to humanity.
886282532228038658 2017-07-15 17:53:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Understand this, Muslims are not my enemies per se. I respect people's right to believe what they choose and leave judgment to God.
886282319862140931 2017-07-15 17:52:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk For?
886281543366344705 2017-07-15 17:49:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Thank the military and secular government for that. During Morsi government the country was going down the path of Islamic theocratic rule.
886280688202371073 2017-07-15 17:45:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Again, India was invaded and look at it. Colonialism took place but using as excuse is mistake.
886280348270817283 2017-07-15 17:44:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @jmorika @RaniaPunk So I repeat, study history as science and not as a propaganda tool.
886280225562271745 2017-07-15 17:44:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk History is just that,history. Islamic, Chinese, black, any "version" by a group is likely biased and twisted to conform to that group.
886279807478247425 2017-07-15 17:42:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk We don't want Sharia law here even amongst Muslims cause is contrary to our values and principles.
886279627634860043 2017-07-15 17:41:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Shariah is backwardness for so many reasons and ways that it would take long time to debate.
886279462039543808 2017-07-15 17:41:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Well look at homosexuals. I am against it on moral grounds but don't believe in executing them. I leave judgment to God.
886279170657050625 2017-07-15 17:39:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Well what if we don't want Islam? Pay a tax? Prohibit me from sharing my faith to Muslims or others?
886278952972677121 2017-07-15 17:39:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Terrorists r cowards. They hide I schools, hospitals,even mosques. Blame them.
886278791387123713 2017-07-15 17:38:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Are the children, women, elderly killed by alqaeda enemies?
886247853705895937 2017-07-15 15:35:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Arab culture was rich in science and left behind under progressive Islamic obscurantism. Hope this will one day change.
886245043715153920 2017-07-15 15:24:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk @jmorika Nice theory but fanatical application has been murderous.
886240895523225601 2017-07-15 15:07:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk I haven't ignored. I told to look at secular history but u wont. I had discussions w many Muslims over the years.
886218610129203206 2017-07-15 13:39:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk How did India progress? How did Chile in South America? China? South Korea? After 13 century Islamic worlds science pretty much died.
886217804537581568 2017-07-15 13:36:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk @jmorika Not expert in Arabic literature but aren't there 5 century prose fragments?
886216871858630657 2017-07-15 13:32:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk We cannot accept backwardness such as shariah law in our midst. Muslims can't demand freedoms here they deny in their land to others.
886216591779803136 2017-07-15 13:31:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Rest of the world are more than 6billion.
886216482505490432 2017-07-15 13:30:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk I do. We do.this is not about destroying Islam. Is about 21 century clashing w 13 primitive values.
886216224304242688 2017-07-15 13:29:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Your truth based on convenience.
886216072264912896 2017-07-15 13:29:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Idea of islamization of the world is ludicrous. War will always result from such folly
886215879465336832 2017-07-15 13:28:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Islam will eventually reform question is how much blood will be she'd to achieve this
886215718139830273 2017-07-15 13:27:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Big time. It's stuck in the 13 century. Stuck in bling fanaticism just like Catholicism was in middle ages.
886215403281797121 2017-07-15 13:26:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Absolutely but why did western civilization left Arabic civilization behind? Freedom. Islam killed freedom and hence progress.
886214979770351616 2017-07-15 13:24:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Of course. Cannibals established civilizations too. Should we accept cannibalism?
886214485505179650 2017-07-15 13:22:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Sure that's why islamic nationa r ahead in science.
886214237680488448 2017-07-15 13:21:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk After they refused to expel those who attacked us? Heck yes.
886214098358292482 2017-07-15 13:21:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk No.fight soviets.very important difference
886213925158703104 2017-07-15 13:20:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Now u r getting into fantasy conspiracy theories. Binladen himself acknowledge 911 was his doing and u say he lied?
886213646963142660 2017-07-15 13:19:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Taliban got what they asked for and deserve with barbaric ways. Is that the Islam u defend?
886213440053948416 2017-07-15 13:18:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk When your enemy attacks u and hides in other person house then that person is also enemy.
886199348337549312 2017-07-15 12:22:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Hopefully like Europe rid itself of Catholic fanaticism so can you people by  reforming Islam.
886199067503734784 2017-07-15 12:21:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Arabic culture was ahead in science until Islam appeared and subjugated in the equivalent to Catholic dark age.
886198801261895680 2017-07-15 12:20:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk All claim truth but facts speak otherwise. Islamic fanaticism destroyed thriving Arabic and Persian cultures.
886198413712338945 2017-07-15 12:19:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Well Islamic theocratic system is worse so I disagree with that system.
886198204550836224 2017-07-15 12:18:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk To free Afghanistan of Soviet invasion. Not to attack us.
886197933057683456 2017-07-15 12:17:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Taliban sheltering those who attacked us on 911? Yes. That one absolutely yes.
886083113331421185 2017-07-14 04:40:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RepSpeier Still is money not needed for combat. Why should we pay for cosmetic surgery?
886082025060478977 2017-07-14 04:36:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AdamSpenceAU @BarbaraHFlowers Nope. Miami Herald and other lib group did full recount hoping to prove Gore won. When results confirmed W won they buried report in paper.
886017761721421824 2017-07-14 00:21:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Afghanistan no. Others may also be explained.
886017578342248449 2017-07-14 00:20:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Sure. Why not study secular history so that you avoid Islamic twist of historical recount? Answers abound if u want to know truth.
886017146442186752 2017-07-14 00:18:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Seriously? Taliban were running the place and giving refuge to binladen. Nobody disputes that.
885973694463578113 2017-07-14 21:26:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AdamSpenceAU @BarbaraHFlowers No. "Resolved" is the operative word. Dems wanted to Chg law in desperate effort and courts wouldn't play game.
885921835644334080 2017-07-14 17:59:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk There's are no good ways in war. Hopefully one day wars will be obsolete.
885871289252143104 2017-07-14 14:39:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @davidfrum @jyangelo If so, why r Dems engaging in what's tantamount to a coup d etat?
885870991020355584 2017-07-14 14:37:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @20committee Sadly that's what Dems e engaging in albeit limited by our laws. They r obstructing and damaging our country in the process.
885868014234722304 2017-07-14 14:26:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @OsopePatrisse @opalayo @aliciagarza @ajplus @tanzil_taz Dems r the ones perpetuating race for political purposes.

885867304034205696 2017-07-14 14:23:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Prove what? Islam history is well-documented.
885867180503576577 2017-07-14 14:22:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk How what?
885867082830798848 2017-07-14 14:22:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Yes. Agent orange was a herbicide to kill vegetation used by Vietcong to hide. Not intended to harm people but it left trail of effects.
885864579418513408 2017-07-14 14:12:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk When elephants play ants get killed. USA & USSR fought cold war in proxy countries. Vietnam was one of them.
885829959733923840 2017-07-14 11:54:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BarbaraHFlowers @AdamSpenceAU The one area I would modify is take away the winner take all approach to reflect that.
885829539938660353 2017-07-14 11:53:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk None of this erases Islam's long history of bloody conquest and abuses.
885829233590886400 2017-07-14 11:52:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Afghanistan was giving refuge to authors of 911. Iraq, I never agreed with it.
885829087213879296 2017-07-14 11:51:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk What does Vietnam has to do here but an effort to tangentially rationalize the issue?
885828797056110592 2017-07-14 11:50:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RaniaPunk Sure. Crusades while being responsive to Muslim invasion were attrocious.
885827916533248001 2017-07-14 11:46:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus This lady continues to desecrate Congress with her senile idiocy.
885827605995413506 2017-07-14 11:45:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @OsopePatrisse @opalayo @aliciagarza @ajplus @tanzil_taz There are racist people out there and they come in all colors. Racism is ignorance, insecurity, evil, but not prevalent in most Americans.
885827164184170496 2017-07-14 11:43:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @OsopePatrisse @opalayo @aliciagarza @ajplus @tanzil_taz What treatment is that? As a minority I know I will be treated mostly according to my own individual behavior.

885826023958425600 2017-07-14 11:39:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AdamSpenceAU @BarbaraHFlowers Election is run chasing EC not popular vote. Diff   strategies all together.
885825698878947328 2017-07-14 11:37:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BarbaraHFlowers @AdamSpenceAU Having been to about 40 states I see that country is too diverse to let some states alienate the rest.
885825429931782148 2017-07-14 11:36:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AdamSpenceAU @BarbaraHFlowers 6 months or so later a privately funded full recount confirmed result and actually  expanded margin a bit.
885823610962808832 2017-07-14 11:29:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AdamSpenceAU @BarbaraHFlowers Nope. They were. Issue was full recount v limited recount of close margin precincts. Existing law was properly applied.
885823189221289984 2017-07-14 11:28:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BarbaraHFlowers @AdamSpenceAU EC gives equal value to all states. Far from anachronistic it's genius and testament to founding fathers wisdom.
885719075233701888 2017-07-13 04:34:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AdamSpenceAU @BarbaraHFlowers It was. Supreme Court of Florida did what the law required. Miami herald did full recounts after & Bush gained votes while for Lost.
885702420092813312 2017-07-13 03:28:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Shakestweetz Of course he does, he's made millions with his apocalyptic climate cult/scam
885702230741012480 2017-07-13 03:27:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AdamSpenceAU @BarbaraHFlowers False, full recounts after fact yielded larger margin for Bush.
885702044442669056 2017-07-13 03:26:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KezzerOz @AdamSpenceAU @denniallen Historic revisionism? Full recounts gave Bush a bigger margin. That's reality.
885701816415072256 2017-07-13 03:25:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AdamSpenceAU Same mess it is today. But I think the outcome was best for him as his apocalyptic climate cult has made him very wealthy.

885657717309935616 2017-07-13 00:30:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @donnabrazile Does it include a chapter about colluding with HRC against Bernie? Passing HRC the debate questions?

883464813787197440 2017-07-07 23:16:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KrisGriebe @SureReality @edenthurs I know what liberty is. Was shot at while fighting 4 it. I'm not paranoid, that's all.

883452594957504512 2017-07-07 22:28:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus Look at NK, bans r useless without enforcement.
883452371384324096 2017-07-07 22:27:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus Bans without force to enforce them r useless.

883347524580499456 2017-07-07 15:30:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LibyaLiberty Nope. Im not 4 someone selling us out to political correctness.
883347326080864258 2017-07-07 15:29:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @joncoopertweets U r stuck in failed politics sir. Either step aside or Dems r set for more losses.

883251846621614081 2017-07-07 09:10:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TalibKweli Obama lovers will smell channel in his farts.
883251476826640385 2017-07-07 09:08:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> While Obama did nothing about it as he was POTUS then. Press, Obama, deserve to b chastised.
883251142293164032 2017-07-07 09:07:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @hardball Of course he did, he was a stooge.
883251014589198337 2017-07-07 09:07:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BraddJaffy All three deserving it.

883248776370171904 2017-07-07 08:58:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @washingtonpost @kwieczorek87 @KirbAnne How about improving their chances w better education? Start by dealing w corrupt teacher's unions.
883248286714523649 2017-07-07 08:56:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenSanders Then how Dems use vulnerable people for votes is telling about the new Dem party's slavery.
883248024939618304 2017-07-07 08:55:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris Like the knowledgeable staff that churned hundreds of lib biased regulations that kill our economy? No thanks.
883247620176654341 2017-07-07 08:53:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris For me it's about restoring the coverage ocare stole from me while Dems lied. Ocare is a fraud upon the American people.
883084354930577410 2017-07-06 22:04:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lsarsour Excuse me Ms. Sarsour but u r well beneath MLK. U r a dangerous person.
882997886488805376 2017-07-06 16:21:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Stonekettle @tiemen There was significant contuinity between W & BO. DJT is breaking away from both or so he said he would.

882757452609048577 2017-07-05 00:25:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill This shows how German press play ball in hushing Islamic mess & how ignorant we r. Merkels Germany sucks.
882693365657219073 2017-07-05 20:11:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @siciliantaurus But in the interim they cost more $ so premiums should take many things into account.
882691464861540354 2017-07-05 20:03:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @siciliantaurus But they cost a lot. Here i see some grossly obese people munching on fries chicken like it's salad and paying same as yoga coach. Nuts
882689073000968192 2017-07-05 19:54:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @siciliantaurus I ended up in healthcare coop. $190/mo w$1M coverage per incident but must stay fit for price not to Chg.
882688760932126721 2017-07-05 19:52:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @siciliantaurus 1 problem w healthcare is that there is no risk pricing. A smoker should pay more, for example.
882674281192325120 2017-07-05 18:55:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @siciliantaurus I believe in being there for others but also in personal responsibility. I see too many abusing govt programs.
882674084970213376 2017-07-05 18:54:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @siciliantaurus I know a few who work cash & get free healthcare. How is that fair?
882673823182721025 2017-07-05 18:53:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @siciliantaurus Me too but ocare helped others by leaving me uninsured first  & then making it unaffordable.
882670326177554432 2017-07-05 18:39:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @siciliantaurus Tax cuts r only worth if there is income.
882670175526563840 2017-07-05 18:39:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @siciliantaurus It's telling that their wealthy including pols come to US 4 treatment. Know plenty who do so.
882669954792919043 2017-07-05 18:38:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @siciliantaurus Of course they r. Wouldn't u be satisfied eating Pollock if u never tried real crab?
882668029548658688 2017-07-05 18:30:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @siciliantaurus I agree 4 profit is a problem but that also encouraged R&D. Ocare was not right solution.
882667826036842496 2017-07-05 18:29:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @siciliantaurus Is it better than nothing? Of course but that was not starting point here.
882667484100407296 2017-07-05 18:28:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @siciliantaurus Canada and Spain. 10 yrs. 2 yrs. Relatives in both.
882664774084968448 2017-07-05 18:17:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @siciliantaurus Best system was what we has b4 ocare fraud. Wasn't perfect but ocare moved us back not forward as Dems bought votes w freebies.
882664479275847680 2017-07-05 18:16:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @siciliantaurus More? Death panels put father in law to die cause he was 72. I have plenty of horror stories about universal mediocre care.
882663996058468352 2017-07-05 18:14:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @timkaine @j_c_fitz Problem is politicians give themselves something better at our expense. Tired of Dem/GOP establishment's lies. It's all theatrics.
882663600611094528 2017-07-05 18:12:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @siciliantaurus Right now, my elderly parents waiting TWO yrs 4 simple we procedure. Here that would be malpractice.
882663401624875015 2017-07-05 18:12:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @siciliantaurus Nothing like own experience. Lived in Europe & Canada. Universal care is mediocrity of care.
882663112998039562 2017-07-05 18:10:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @RetroChristal Nothing like rationalizing Dems lies & failures.
882662798831960064 2017-07-05 18:09:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenWarren @GOP @ErickFernandez Another fact, ocare was a fraud. All lies.
882662564961890310 2017-07-05 18:08:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP Yes Dems lied to us but where is ur plan? Stop political bs & repeal the darn thing.
882661925389303809 2017-07-05 18:06:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @siciliantaurus If u want universal mediocre care yes. I know it having lived on it twice.
882661723693568001 2017-07-05 18:05:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @SIIPCampaigns They r whining all the way to more losses.
882661596903952384 2017-07-05 18:04:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @zaza_420 We all have backbone & being obtuse for political gain  is not a sign of strength.
882661296331784193 2017-07-05 18:03:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris Nothing like statistical chop suey to argue about politics. Ocare was a fraud perpetrated against us all.
882659771710681088 2017-07-05 17:57:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @timkaine @j_c_fitz Sure, standardized mediocre care for all except the ones who create it.
882659539656552461 2017-07-05 17:56:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @timkaine That's less than what ocare increased mine. Nevermind the 500% deductible & loss of doctors.
882656521145987075 2017-07-05 17:44:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @seattletimes @SenateGOP @PattyMurray And what was legislation that stole my healthcare insurance while Obama liked that it wouldn't happen?

882564955177967616 2017-07-05 11:40:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenKamalaHarris @SafeLibraries Maybe maybe not. So far she sounds like another partisan hack to me, dishonest and putting her ambitions above our wellbeing.

881526428034052096 2017-07-02 14:54:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ok2disagree Well he's not alone. Einstein ended up believing in God albeit in a form diff from the one in the Bible.
881525890387247105 2017-07-02 14:52:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @CrossFire_101 @Godnose @Pudnip @Floridaline @19kfish @DeityFree U define Christianity by religious constructs like Catholicism or protestantism when Christianity is neither & is above them.

881525258444042240 2017-07-02 14:49:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ok2disagree So God's non existence is an absolute truth for u now? R u digressing now?
881525039492980738 2017-07-02 14:48:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SergeyPsh I don't embrace Catholicism. U clarified he was Catholic remember? Catholicism is a state creation distorting Christianity.
881524705353748480 2017-07-02 14:47:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ok2disagree Just look at kokojoe comment to see how an ignorant hateful atheist can b and he's far from being alone.
881524475380076544 2017-07-02 14:46:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ok2disagree Some may, most? I don't go that far. Many atheists see spiritual belief as ignorant & asset that God doesn't, can't possibly exist.
881524123234709504 2017-07-02 14:45:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ok2disagree Best talk ever want w an atheist mathematician who ended admitting stalemate & prob that God does exist. It's simple logic in honest use.
881523792744501249 2017-07-02 14:43:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ok2disagree I've discussed w atheists 4 decades now. Just like there r nominal Christians ignorant of Christianity there r ignorant atheists.
881523374245253121 2017-07-02 14:42:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @CrossFire_101 @Godnose @DeityFree @19kfish @Pudnip Absolutely. No religion, Creed, or idea such as humanism or atheism.
881523099384107015 2017-07-02 14:40:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ok2disagree Everything needs faith. Problem is u limit faith to religiosity.
881522878310756353 2017-07-02 14:40:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ok2disagree And thus u have faith this is true. See, faith is not merely a religious word.
881518649948983297 2017-07-02 14:23:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ok2disagree The u r a far more honest atheist than most.my respect 4 that.
881518488636010496 2017-07-02 14:22:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ok2disagree There's 1, implicitly.
881518273950625792 2017-07-02 14:21:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ok2disagree In other words, atheists also have faith that, absent evidence for atheism, atheism is true.
881518074318508036 2017-07-02 14:21:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ok2disagree Search 4 truth requires open mind to see own thesis collapse. Atheism is in fact as religiously emotional as religions u criticize.
881517638492532736 2017-07-02 14:19:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ok2disagree Another way for saying it doesn't exist. Why can't atheists accept logical result is a tie? Cause u must consider prob that u might b wrong
881517344157257729 2017-07-02 14:18:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ok2disagree Why am I ok w accepting logical outcome? Cause I realize God is beyond logic.
881517080335593473 2017-07-02 14:17:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ok2disagree In truest logical sense it's a stalemate at best. I'm ok w that but not w common  false declaration of victory by atheists.
881516850915442688 2017-07-02 14:16:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ok2disagree I ask for evidence it doesn't exist.

881516030136381440 2017-07-02 14:12:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ok2disagree And vice versa.

881365576714768384 2017-07-01 04:15:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @CrossFire_101 @Godnose @saltyleft @DeityFree Again, as an 'ex- Christian" u would know the error of ur comment.

881244767656570882 2017-07-01 20:15:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @CrossFire_101 @DeityFree I never said that. I said I understood context & purpose.

881236487295160320 2017-07-01 19:42:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @CrossFire_101 @DeityFree I know what I feel same as u do. It's our personal reality about what we feel.

881233602037649411 2017-07-01 19:30:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TeaPainUSA Sadly ur comments show why u r part of the problem not the solution.
881233454934917120 2017-07-01 19:30:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @shure46 The true oxymoron is logical atheism.

881233031868100613 2017-07-01 19:28:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ArtturiArtturi U assume, incorrectly, that I rationalize to fit my faith which is not true at all.
881232857435451392 2017-07-01 19:27:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ArtturiArtturi We all can throw fancy terms around but u have no clue who I am so why don't start from that perspective?
881232506690957316 2017-07-01 19:26:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @CrossFire_101 @DeityFree I know. I've discussed w agnostics & atheists many times over yrs. I know how entrenched u may b on ur conclusions.
881232174778912768 2017-07-01 19:24:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @CrossFire_101 @DeityFree No and Bible doesn't proclaim them as such. OT is both narrative & prescriptive in nature. Important to apply that when reading.
881231882926649347 2017-07-01 19:23:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @CrossFire_101 @DeityFree I can share w u what I've learned so far but Christianity being a relationship, not religion, it's about individual relationship w God.
881213206236200960 2017-07-01 18:09:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @CrossFire_101 @DeityFree So far my faith not only remains but it's stronger after decades of questioning.
881213055996223489 2017-07-01 18:08:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @CrossFire_101 @DeityFree I believe the Bible not cause taught to but cause all my scepticism about it has been satisfied but not affraid to question my beliefs.

881206897457680384 2017-07-01 17:44:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Have u lived under that system? I did, so does my family. It sucks. Ours b4 ocare was far superior. Stop demagogery.
881206441855651845 2017-07-01 17:42:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SteveWeichert Have u used that healthcare? I have so does my family and one stolen by ocare was far better.

881205878099202050 2017-07-01 17:40:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @vaculb I would go back time when leaders had cojones like Reagan Thatcher, and Mulroney not these three charlatans.

881128351242563586 2017-07-01 12:32:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CharlesMBlow Really? What's the fear to check if registered voters r lawful citizens? States like CA r affraid, why?
881127867702284288 2017-07-01 12:30:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @25thAmdt Dems should remember Clinton impeachment debacle. People would send Dems to large loses if they continue w sore losers bs

880275713429037056 2017-06-28 04:04:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mmpadellan Good advice but also don't debate race baiters who use race as an excuse for lack of argument.
880274965366534146 2017-06-28 04:01:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx Come to think about it, u reminded me of cats, my favorite musical. Keep on being u.
880274577594757120 2017-06-28 03:59:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx Never. It's actually cute. And name calling is a tool of losers. We r all in the same boat and rather than resist we should all contribute.
880274246047604737 2017-06-28 03:58:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx Agreed. Term limits is a must. Dinosaurs retire filthy rich leaving us in the dust.
880273830706642944 2017-06-28 03:56:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx Like I said, we all want a better life and we could  do better than political whores I DC sold out to big $. God bless.
880273529526210562 2017-06-28 03:55:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx Second being lack of competition across state lines.

880273041229570049 2017-06-28 03:53:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx I checked premiums this year, it was at $780 for both w $15k deductible. Don't trust stats as they r manipulated.
880272742775484421 2017-06-28 03:52:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx Not true in my case. Premiums increased ea 5 yrs. I paid $260 for my child and I. 1sr yr ocare went up to $600 w 500% increase deductible.
880272257867763712 2017-06-28 03:50:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx States r diff. What may work in ur state may not in Florida. Diff demographics & economic base.
880272022856753152 2017-06-28 03:49:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx I have catastrophic coverage and exempt from ocare penalty. Unless u get subsidies ocare makes no financial sense.
880271820599029765 2017-06-28 03:48:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx I believe u. pre ocare was not perfect but ocare was wrong solution. U have insurance. I don't. I went self-paid & it's cheaper.
880271288329265156 2017-06-28 03:46:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx Ocare was gift to ins cos. Ocare has bailout provision for insurers. It was a scam.
880271112617308160 2017-06-28 03:46:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx B4 ocare I could buy prescriptions in Canada way cheaper. Ocare killed that putting us at Mercy of greedy pharma here.
880270868110336005 2017-06-28 03:45:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx B4 ocare I saw top notch doctors. I got ocare & doctors were all from crappy schools overseas and service terrible.
880270565692628992 2017-06-28 03:43:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx I had my plan 4 12 yrs. Plan had to b aca compliant. That killed it and new plan was an absurdity.
880269681218727938 2017-06-28 03:40:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @willripleyCNN What has talks given us but larger problems.
880269401391587328 2017-06-28 03:39:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tedlieu @SilverAttack Is not about loving wars. Dems leave messes that end up in conflict.
880269156452634624 2017-06-28 03:38:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tedlieu @Hecates3rd I remember loonie libs saying same about Reagan and he turned out to be one of top POTUS ever. So, don't listen to lib histeria.
880268759524667393 2017-06-28 03:36:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tedlieu @vbrighthorses See we actually have democracy and he will remain POTUS until 2020 when we get to either reelect him or not.
880266989494829056 2017-06-28 03:29:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @hrenee80 Cold words but true. We r the primary responsible ones to provide 4 ourselves.
880266729615745024 2017-06-28 03:28:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ifuaskmee @robivod No it wasn't. It passed without a GOP vote.
880266440644984832 2017-06-28 03:27:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ifuaskmee Ocare is dead. Young people expected to sign to subsidize sick people didn't. It's a catastrophe.
880266084728938496 2017-06-28 03:26:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @xeni My spouse went through that & ocare meant we had to fork out $25k when b4 ocare we would b limited to $5k our of pocket.
880265733359456257 2017-06-28 03:24:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kwilli1046 Good point. Liberal elitists r arrogant that way, they know best in their putrid rationale.
880265403964026881 2017-06-28 03:23:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BryanDawsonUSA @AjadeanPiper Cause we don't like the idea of working to give others what we can't get for ourselves. It's nice to get freebies but I can't.
880265008894136320 2017-06-28 03:21:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BryanDawsonUSA @NervenaJolt @AndreasOpinions A strong economy is not where people work for the govt. Ocare decreased wages by forcing part-time or reduced hours.
880264702231797762 2017-06-28 03:20:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BryanDawsonUSA @NervenaJolt But they do. Top 10% pay 80% of taxes. But w pols promising anything 4 votes no amt of taxes will ever suffice.

880263751169183745 2017-06-28 03:16:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BryanDawsonUSA Nope. Gambit was that young healthy people would pay ins to subsidize sick people. They didn't &ocare went down the drain.
880263464534650881 2017-06-28 03:15:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Redpainter1 Medicaid would have paid anyways. Ocare had nothing to do w that.
880263172355215361 2017-06-28 03:14:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kylegriffin1 Sad how media is little else than DNCs lackeys.
880263021892972550 2017-06-28 03:13:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KellyScaletta @DonnaBa46940099 I realize he's been on it 14 times right?
880262819064799232 2017-06-28 03:13:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TIME @realDonaldTrump @Fahrenthold Anything on Lynch, Rice, Clinton emails? Nope. So-called journalists r lackeys of DNC.
880262389572284417 2017-06-28 03:11:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JoyAnnReid He should have hung one of the 14 time covers he's been on but used a photoshopped one. Big deal? No, unless for fake newster losers.
880262047606464512 2017-06-28 03:10:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @OhNoSheTwitnt Has been on time cover 14 times.
880261783289778176 2017-06-28 03:08:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @comcast @CNBC @realDonaldTrump @TIME @Fahrenthold @RobertNorCal @carlquintanilla @SadFndngFathers DJT has been I time cover 14 times or so. He could have use any but used photoshopped one. This is not a story people care about.
880261461389561856 2017-06-28 03:07:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @comcast @CNBC @realDonaldTrump @TIME @Fahrenthold @RobertNorCal @carlquintanilla This is why media can't be trusted anymore. All about ratings sacrificing news that matter to people.
880261150017019904 2017-06-28 03:06:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @TIME @Fahrenthold Fact he was in cover 14 times means nothing? Fake newster wasting time in nothing instead of reporting what truly matters to people.
880260562638209024 2017-06-28 03:04:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx That's why fed approach fails. Should b left to states.
880260316801753088 2017-06-28 03:03:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx Ocare even killed Florida's kids care which was great & priced at $120/mo. Now double w less benefits.
880260090166747138 2017-06-28 03:02:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx Here job ins was about $120/mo w $1,500 deductible. That is gone.
880259724888993792 2017-06-28 03:00:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx 5 of 6 doctors I saw won't take ocare. Rich can pay $ to see them. Here ocare doctors r not the best.
880259395300589568 2017-06-28 02:59:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx We need new system but socialized medicine is not what Dems want us to believe. I lived w it in Canada & Europe & quality poor.
880259098851332100 2017-06-28 02:58:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx True story, when my ins cancel I called my Dem congresswoman & was told some (me) had to b sacrificed. That didn't sound right.
880258864456900609 2017-06-28 02:57:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx B4 it was better 4 some & bad 4 others. Same now but reverse in many cases. Govt shouldn't pick winners & losers.
880217708125728769 2017-06-28 00:13:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx End result is that u now have insurance but others r now priced out like u we're. Changing sides of problem didn't solve problem.
880216689262166016 2017-06-28 00:09:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx That's why medicare expansion for high risk pool makes sense but not forcing us all down ocare.
880216543044546560 2017-06-28 00:09:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx Preexisting cond? Or hmo priced u out? Those were bad practices but understandable due to nature of insurance biZ.
880170935306903552 2017-06-28 21:07:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx No. I want to refocus from family reunification to merit based immigration like Canada. That's smart.
880145110650040320 2017-06-28 19:25:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx B4 Obamacare some faced BK but care was given. Now care is below par in most plans except platinum which is absurdly pricey.
880141670452539392 2017-06-28 19:11:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx At end of day we all what best for us so divisiveness is senseless.
880141413689831426 2017-06-28 19:10:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx To fix things we need to revamp many things and out those already here first.
880141254943801344 2017-06-28 19:10:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx I asked cause I can't reconcile how some want to help poor while bringing more poor in.
880131347368562688 2017-06-28 18:30:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx R u 4 lax immigration?
880131206733594625 2017-06-28 18:30:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx I'm working class, I got robbed by Obamacare. Taxing has consequences. Look at Canada eternal 6% unemployment rate. It ain't pretty.
880130582629494785 2017-06-28 18:27:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx Problem is fed govt don't care about expenses cause they tax or print $. Many middle class lost ins ir pay absurd amount to subsidize others
880130076356071425 2017-06-28 18:25:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx I mentioned b4, I know 5 people who earn good $ but report Little. They get free healthcare. How is that right?
880129896219103232 2017-06-28 18:24:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx I'm not against helping those in need but not at expense of middle class own healthcare.

880118187760787456 2017-06-28 17:38:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx Now, what do u say about IL, Detroit, Puerto Rico. How can govt go bankrupt like that?
880117932864540676 2017-06-28 17:37:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx I'm stating facts & u e welcomed to challenge them w facts. But emotional disparaging gets u nowhere. We all need to inform ourselves better

880114054777511936 2017-06-28 17:21:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx U mean ur limp responses? Out some meat on those ideological bones. Stop parroting lib media propaganda.

880110946445905920 2017-06-28 17:09:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx Btw, I hate golf but had to endure rounds as game doubles as  biz meetings.
880110635622830080 2017-06-28 17:08:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx A lie. DJT owned more than 100 biz & 4 went through BK. BK is a biz strategy used by many successful business people.
880110238325768192 2017-06-28 17:06:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx DC wastes $ all over. Needs to b reduced.
880110015025229825 2017-06-28 17:05:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx People at that level work 24/7. This is why I never had issue w Obama's vacations.
880109606902616064 2017-06-28 17:04:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx So?
880103775062695936 2017-06-28 16:41:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @Truthiness123 Only time race is brought up is by people unable to defend Obama w other means.
880103519285653504 2017-06-28 16:40:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx Ignorance is forgetting DJT is a billionaire who spends his $ while Obamas spent ours.
880103272027230208 2017-06-28 16:39:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump @lil_mis_dx When unable to defend then just bring up race as excuse right? That's sad.
880103000139812865 2017-06-28 16:38:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump She & POTUS have their own $. Obamas used ours. Big diff.

880045442788098048 2017-06-28 12:49:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BrianKarem @NewDay @ananavarro Is it an establishment cabal of partisan lackeys? U all have gone down to the mud

880043538582351872 2017-06-28 12:41:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BrianKarem @JumzyRau Question is, where did those journalists go? What we have is propagandists too full of them selves
880043244004007938 2017-06-28 12:40:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BrianKarem Press has failed us all w fake news & propaganda. Most Americans don't trust press. U all should look at mirror. we need reporters not pawns

880042108090036224 2017-06-28 12:36:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump Media has been utterly irresponsible in passing propaganda for journalism. POTUS is right in distrusting these fake newsters.
879687644489408514 2017-06-27 13:07:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump Obamacare killed my ins. Couldn't keep plan or doctor. Premiums up 50%, deductible up 500%. That's real harm by Barry.
879686126621130752 2017-06-27 13:01:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DTrumpExposed Flourished? Compared to what? Venezuela? BO was played like cheap fiddle by Putin and others. He made US look like weak puppy.
879677782128807936 2017-06-27 12:28:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @50th_President @ZaidJilani There r more Black voters to pander to than Indian. DNC is about getting votes period.besides ur hero is foreign born so limited potential.
879665083193970689 2017-06-27 11:37:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus What's next, carrying them to the polls? If they cared they would register and vote.
879518663111573504 2017-06-26 01:56:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Slate @baryonic So, if he's reelected then what?
879517285098156034 2017-06-26 01:50:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JuddLegum @dirtmcgurk @progdoctalk And let's not forget preventive care and incentive 4 people to stay healthy.
879517071851356162 2017-06-26 01:49:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JuddLegum @dirtmcgurk @progdoctalk I prefer tax route cause I don't want to b forced into govt run programs but strict eligibility is a must. Local progs best.
879516693244121088 2017-06-26 01:48:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JuddLegum @progdoctalk @dirtmcgurk I agree. We have found a common ground. If only pols in Congress could do same.

879483917585219584 2017-06-26 23:38:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JuddLegum @progdoctalk @dirtmcgurk Read again, high risk pool to medicare. Low risk to free market with proper safeguards IE no premium hikes cause of claim. It's workable.
879481542304821249 2017-06-26 23:28:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Sony12Play @ChosenOneMike And I would vote 4 him again. Could never vote 4 Uber corrupt HRC.
879481149210451969 2017-06-26 23:27:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JuddLegum @progdoctalk @dirtmcgurk What's the problem w that if safeguards in place to prevent insurers abuse? Or health coops?
879480916271411201 2017-06-26 23:26:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JuddLegum @progdoctalk @dirtmcgurk ACA was devised to fail. A Trojan horse 4 single payer. Solution is rather simple: high risk pool to medicare & rest to free market.
879480312421654528 2017-06-26 23:23:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JuddLegum @progdoctalk @dirtmcgurk It's socialistic. Grand social engineering schemes r unsustainable if some start leeching off others. That's the problem.
879479499792027648 2017-06-26 23:20:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JuddLegum @progdoctalk @dirtmcgurk Really? U know the truth about $3k Guatemalan immigrants in Riviera Beach? Welfare, Obamacare, etc abuse? Well, do u mademoiselle?

879478804468703232 2017-06-26 23:17:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JuddLegum @dirtmcgurk @progdoctalk Well I know single payer in Canada where I lived and frankly I preferred my ins b4 Obamacare stole it from me.
879478579943415808 2017-06-26 23:16:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JuddLegum @progdoctalk @dirtmcgurk Nope. Not old not too young, brown Latino legally immigrated here and make, yes. I know I don't fit DNC model of Latino 4 sale.
879478221112266752 2017-06-26 23:15:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JuddLegum @progdoctalk @dirtmcgurk Or I just may not be a cartoon character of convenience.
879473459708997632 2017-06-26 22:56:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @tonyposnanski What hatred? I lost my ins cause Obamacare. Don't I count? According to Dems no cause not willing to b a pawn in their voting schemes.
879473156934823936 2017-06-26 22:55:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @tonyposnanski Cause to do it would increase our debt drastically. No more morgtgaging our kids future 4 socialistic failures.
879472891812827136 2017-06-26 22:54:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @adamcbest We do which is why we voted DJT in. GOP r being whimps.
879472099739525120 2017-06-26 22:51:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JuddLegum @Leslie17Debbie Pls. Obamacare was flawed a inception.
879471651922087936 2017-06-26 22:49:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JuddLegum @progdoctalk @dirtmcgurk U guys throw the "racist" monicker like confetti. U trivialize it.
879471421147238400 2017-06-26 22:48:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JuddLegum @dirtmcgurk @progdoctalk Well from single payer in England to sanfranwacko explains ur psyche.
879471137197092865 2017-06-26 22:47:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JuddLegum @progdoctalk Obamacare is a gold mine in Dem strongholds here doc. Rampant fraud.
879470960461717504 2017-06-26 22:46:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JuddLegum @progdoctalk Obama's skin color irrelevant. I know many who make good $ but don't report so get free subsidized obamacare.
879470695985672193 2017-06-26 22:45:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JuddLegum It's terrible but GOP r whimps.
879470574287953920 2017-06-26 22:44:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @williamlegate Btw, most Obamacare plans not accepted by most best doctors so u end up w bottom of barrell care.
879470417488089088 2017-06-26 22:44:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @williamlegate I have $1M coverage per incident 4 $179/mo w $500/incident deductible outside of Obamacare.
879470137237221377 2017-06-26 22:43:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @williamlegate Why should I pay $600 per month 4 coverage that only kicks in after $7 deductible?
879450501368217601 2017-06-26 21:25:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PrettyBadLefty Besides conflict is also on ethnic and religious lines. Sunni v Shia.
879450199789273088 2017-06-26 21:24:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PrettyBadLefty We can refugees in situ. No need to bring them here specially when we can't properly vet then.
879449892011339776 2017-06-26 21:22:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PrettyBadLefty Regarding travel ban a 7-2 including liberal judges is a remarkable slap to the face of the 9th circuit.
879421620020019202 2017-06-26 19:30:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PrettyBadLefty Why is the travel ban "barbaric?" The 6 countries r failed states or declared enemies.
879421244659073025 2017-06-26 19:28:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PrettyBadLefty No. But it's less biased than 9th IE. Fact that voted 7-2 says a lot.
879403725697298432 2017-06-26 18:19:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lilyachttty We did and it was a disaster. His name was Barry Obama.
879403356514656256 2017-06-26 18:17:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tonyposnanski So? Trudeau's Political superficiality is to be recognized.
879401948667158528 2017-06-26 18:12:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PrettyBadLefty Issue is not about morality but about Constitution. Lower courts overstepped their power 4 political reasons & that is troubling.
879401340946067460 2017-06-26 18:09:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @inspiredbyria_ Humble? That arrogant .... That one is far from reality.

879400168726069248 2017-06-26 18:05:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @tonyposnanski It's not hatred. Obamacare is bad law that robbed many of us of insurance 4 political purposes.
879399942661582850 2017-06-26 18:04:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @4everNeverTrump Still pending issue.

879399309971787776 2017-06-26 18:01:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Sony12Play Did u say that each time Barry kept on bringing. Bush up?
879399061283115008 2017-06-26 18:00:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @williamlegate Well Barry dug the pit he is in now.
879398699083993088 2017-06-26 17:59:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tribelaw As if that had real impact. Putin took Obama 4 a ride time and time again.
879397379694374912 2017-06-26 17:54:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mitchellreports @elisabeth1518 Sure. A respectful discussion is always welcomed.
879394981043163137 2017-06-26 17:44:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Obamacare Why did it failed so miserably then? Cause it was crafted to fail so u can push single payer death panels.
879394366393135104 2017-06-26 17:42:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Amy_Siskind Oh please. Another conspiracy parania?
879394042051784705 2017-06-26 17:40:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PrettyBadLefty Barbaric? Funny how not 1 justice agrees w u.
879393817530695680 2017-06-26 17:39:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JasonKander Nutty fanatics hate us as it is. Hell if we care about their sensibilities.

879392600079421440 2017-06-26 17:35:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AynRandPaulRyan Why? 4 media buffoons interested in self-promoting rather than reporting facts? Media has 0 credibility.
879392292238483456 2017-06-26 17:33:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump When they do same 4 all politicians.

879331604828762113 2017-06-26 13:32:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JSCveritas Is not kind of. It's what I'm saying. R there "Christian" religions? Sure. But Christianity is by design a relationship not religion.

879302328947531776 2017-06-26 11:36:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JSCveritas It's not. It has been turned into religion by us not by Christ.

879159421758308353 2017-06-25 02:08:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @2020fight @GuitrDad @wombatkidd Agreed. The establishment is fighting him hard. Establishment is forms by GOP, Dems, & bureaucratic apparatus.

879158815362621442 2017-06-25 02:06:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mitchellreports @elisabeth1518 Fundamentalist Muslims r not twisting Islam to do what they do. Islam is an exclusive religious-political scheme.
879158240868786178 2017-06-25 02:03:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mitchellreports @elisabeth1518 Christianity is not a religion, it's a relationship. The history u refer to relates to religion built upon twisting of Christianity.

879048721337634820 2017-06-25 18:48:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @2020fight @GuitrDad @wombatkidd Did u know Obama onlymjved to Chicago when he went to college? He was raised in Hawaii and ibdinesia. I thought u knew whom u defend so much
879048244462063617 2017-06-25 18:46:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @2020fight @GuitrDad @wombatkidd U assume that I will praise DJT 4 yrs from now when that remains to be seen. I'm not sold out to him or party.
879048023598407680 2017-06-25 18:45:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @2020fight @GuitrDad @wombatkidd I don't care about vacations by any. I know people at those levels r always working even when on vacation. I just results.
879047762792382464 2017-06-25 18:44:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @2020fight @GuitrDad @wombatkidd Nope like any honest person wanting to make a diff. Between Koch brothers and Soros such a  candidate is doomed.

879047235543150592 2017-06-25 18:42:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HuffPost Tradition started by Clinton aptly ended by DJT. Poetic Justice.
879047089363222528 2017-06-25 18:42:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mitchellreports U should mention that Jefferson's move was a diplomatic gesture during barbaric pirate war.

879045554612862976 2017-06-25 18:36:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mitchellreports @elisabeth1518 I think we do understand that Islam is I direct line of conflict w all we hold dear in Western Civilization.

879037436294254594 2017-06-25 18:03:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @2020fight @GuitrDad @wombatkidd Also, I didn't say Barry was lazy. He was diligent on the wrong policies.
879037270938071040 2017-06-25 18:03:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @2020fight @GuitrDad @wombatkidd Btw, DJT is also clearly narcissistic. Real down to earth people can't run for POTUS anymore in our Kardashian culture.
879036776161083393 2017-06-25 18:01:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @2020fight @wombatkidd @GuitrDad I don't know him personally so couldn't make that claim about DJT or Obama. I just judge what I can ascertain. U seem too emotionally vested
879036452293750784 2017-06-25 17:59:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @2020fight @GuitrDad @wombatkidd I admire & respect Colin Powell & he's black. I criticize BO on the merits not his skin.
879036153613230081 2017-06-25 17:58:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @2020fight @GuitrDad @wombatkidd Well Obama is not actually black, he is mixed. That's a fact. Also, he didn't do.much 4 blacks other than use them 4 votes.

874821185229512704 2017-06-13 02:49:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenKamalaHarris @peterdaou To me she's not annoying and clearly self-promoting.

874820896774598665 2017-06-13 02:48:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenKamalaHarris I got it. It's simple. Perhaps my mind is not clouded by partisan zealotry.
874820528456048641 2017-06-13 02:47:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @keithengland @TheBMartin A rude woman of any color makes me uncomfortable.
874820410843553793 2017-06-13 02:46:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris Sorry madam but u were rude in a clear grandstanding self-promoting performance. U look too hungry 4 advancing ur self in DNCs pecking order
874819981149687810 2017-06-13 02:45:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris It's deja vu as Dems did much and worse. Both parties repelus voters w shenanigans.
874819321184354305 2017-06-13 02:42:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNNPolitics While he shows concerted to distract w DNC demagoguery to derail POTUS agenda. We see through it
874818980178952192 2017-06-13 02:41:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @USATODAY He looks the part: nuts.
874818455245139968 2017-06-13 02:39:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PhillyLGBTgov @hellotierney @ajplus Or perhaps  "abnormal" whites. Hard to explain what is hard to understand unless we call it what it is. Trash identity politics.
874817982068924416 2017-06-13 02:37:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PhillyLGBTgov @hellotierney @ajplus Well the flag seems to include salt and pepper of gay community and now blacks and browns so, who's left out?
874791603898114048 2017-06-13 00:52:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AllenWest Winner? Does HE think HE is a winner by beating true girls? 
874790768015269890 2017-06-13 00:49:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @PhillyLGBTgov @hellotierney @ajplus I see, it's everybody against "normal" whites? Don't count me in that bunch.
874786026165854213 2017-06-13 00:30:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ArameshArash just watched u on fox. Such smug, partisan posturing is unbecoming.

874757899771424768 2017-06-13 22:38:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @Jagermech U r hilariously wrong. I have clients & friends who moved there & know first hand how they pile up cash. They r millionaires now.

874755676169539585 2017-06-13 22:29:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @Jagermech No taxation period. It's a paradise 4 biz people who can arrange income.

874743909313896449 2017-06-13 21:42:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @Jagermech Weird historical setup. Can't vote, etc unless they reside in Continental US. Nothing against them but they prefer status quo.
874741422448152576 2017-06-13 21:33:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @Jagermech They r citizens but not like us when in PR.

874735111962591235 2017-06-13 21:07:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @Jagermech But CA at least produces but PR?
874735027115917313 2017-06-13 21:07:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @Jagermech It's not GDP it's loonie lib policies like France or Germany that r biggest threat I CA. Unfunded liabilities galore.
874594074900279297 2017-06-13 11:47:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @Jagermech Prosperous? Nope. Rich, yes but things r bad. Many biz moving due to crazy lib costly policies. It's a shame.
874440813874487296 2017-06-12 01:38:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @Jagermech Is not that. PR is a basket case of failed govt largesse & we have enough of that w CA
874440591249219589 2017-06-12 01:37:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @Jagermech It's their right to vote in and ours, through Congress,  to say no.
874396016514150401 2017-06-12 22:40:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus Why would we want a welfare state? We have enough as it stands now.
874245487976734725 2017-06-12 12:42:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RepJeffries So should lynch, Obama, and all other political gangsters of the previous admin.
874223382698618881 2017-06-12 11:14:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus Did Obama?
874221546356838400 2017-06-12 11:07:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill It's not about Dems v DJT. It's about the DC establishment against the people.
874220456705970176 2017-06-12 11:02:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus Good 4 them. Let them pay 4 it & c how taxpayers react.
873994248454107138 2017-06-11 20:04:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DineshDSouza @SharylAttkisson Comey showed  himself as the political insider opportunistic he is. Wouldn't trust him w anything.

873992777457172482 2017-06-11 19:58:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AidenWolfe @wordswurdsweird Or blind fools? Look at Bernie talk bout 1% when he's a member of the 1% club & yet many fools fell 4 it.
873992273444384768 2017-06-11 19:56:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AidenWolfe @wordswurdsweird We don't need career politicians 4 sure.
873923109807632384 2017-06-11 15:21:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AidenWolfe @wordswurdsweird If politicians lie & we vote 4 them, what does that make us all?
873900404559556610 2017-06-11 13:51:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AidenWolfe @wordswurdsweird Why? Lies r politician's tools of the trade. Unfortunately. But blame voters who want to hear promises not reality
873687570701586432 2017-06-10 23:45:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Cause so many promised to go to either place of DJT won. Election is over. I suffered Obama, u can suffer DJT until 2020.
873661744052391937 2017-06-10 22:02:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Would that b Canada or new Zealand?

873634365619802112 2017-06-10 20:13:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Callmecassandr1 Obama created the space 4 DJT.
873633922785193984 2017-06-10 20:12:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> So don't complain about NK, Russia, China, all legacies of the madam Secretary
873633747459072000 2017-06-10 20:11:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> We get NKs missiles cause of idiotic HRC/Obama foreign policy blunders.

873631656061673479 2017-06-10 20:03:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AJEnglish A cult on steroids. Demented people or skillful actors? When regime collapses we will know.
873630111567925248 2017-06-10 19:57:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AidenWolfe @Marfan_Mike R u kidding? Clinton & Obamas terms r a textbook case in corruption. Only south of the border have I witnessed worse.
873629804830105606 2017-06-10 19:55:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AidenWolfe Good point. GOP could enhance majority w Dems overplaying their hand.
873629131283603456 2017-06-10 19:53:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RepAlGreen @fusion Fusion? I think ur brain cells fused into a useless blob.
873628856707690496 2017-06-10 19:52:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RepAlGreen @JeffreyToobin No mention of Lynch's obstruction that Comey did actually testified to? Ur true colors shine through.

873206502491869185 2017-06-09 15:53:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @eegarim Did DJT asked for oath of loyalty? Dumb comment by Kamala. Asking 4 loyalty is not out of ordinary, it's expected from subordinates.
873198399276949505 2017-06-09 15:21:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris Dems took mine away with Obamacare. I know many in same situation. R u going to pay 4 our healthcare?
873197687302172672 2017-06-09 15:18:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @ColumbiaBugle She ended up working in gov't didn't she?
873197571556208641 2017-06-09 15:18:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris @JamilSmith I saw her & was amazed at how she left her brains at the door. Pure political demagoguery.
873197349039898624 2017-06-09 15:17:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @cmclymer That's expectation of what will b her next desperate idiotic statement to gain notoriety.
873197197361393664 2017-06-09 15:16:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DrStaceyPatton An idiotic comparison IMO. Context makes all diff. BTW, why her silence on Lynch's demand that Comey fit narrative to HRC's campaign?
873194770818060288 2017-06-09 15:07:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill But she didn't wear the same dresses and, who paid for them? and where r they now? Just wondering.....

873192466689777664 2017-06-09 14:58:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill no. it's DNC v people's choice of DJT over crooked Hillary.
873192152263778306 2017-06-09 14:56:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TrueFactsStated Real obstruction attempt is when Lynch told him to align his words with HRC's campaign on email investigation.
873191978921590784 2017-06-09 14:56:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TrueFactsStated Comey showed himself as pathetic political establishment insider. a coward rat.
873191848952594432 2017-06-09 14:55:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TrueFactsStated What happened w true facts stated? POTUS has authority to initiate or end investigations. Obama did.

872099889307693056 2017-06-06 14:36:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthaig1 @ultrarider007 Is there a link between Pakistan and Islamic terrorists around world?

872074537764093954 2017-06-06 12:55:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthaig1 @ultrarider007 Problem is that Islam is not a monolith & extremism is normal in certain circles. Islam is a backward religion that needs reform.

834829273823318017 2017-02-23 18:16:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @France4Hillary @TheTruePooka most people want that's best. Extreme minorities on both sides hijack discussion.
834828973628600320 2017-02-23 18:15:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @unionmindbody btw, if I have nothing to say about it, why r my taxes expected to pay 3 it? Let those who agree fund planned murderhood.
834828662520287232 2017-02-23 18:13:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @unionmindbody isn't about control but responsibility. Abortion is murdering a human being when people failed to use a darn condom?
834777775395446786 2017-02-23 14:51:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Propagandist1 it happens. Deluded fanatics can't argue so they hide.
834777605878534150 2017-02-23 14:51:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytimes @lomo68225 a bit dramatic? Trump is the result of failed corrupt bipartisan establishment. His proposals resonate w working class.
834777134136717312 2017-02-23 14:49:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @France4Hillary @TheTruePooka funny thing is that Dems harmed me personally.
834776975550066688 2017-02-23 14:48:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @France4Hillary suicidal compassion is crazy. We can b compassionate & smart unlike dems/libs have led us.

834447543559938048 2017-02-22 16:59:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @hippiegrrl Why is a private for-profit entity getting public money? Let supporters of baby murder fund this enterprise and not us at large

832628975230939137 2017-02-17 16:33:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I'm 4 neither. I just don't see rich=evil. Some r just like some poor r too.
832628769638711296 2017-02-17 16:32:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 why? Cause my tweets have no accent? People tell me I sound like Ricky Ricardo from Lucy's show.
832620470092435456 2017-02-17 15:59:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I hear them & nothing changes my opinion to date. It's all about anti Trump nonsense.
832620251481149440 2017-02-17 15:58:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 again, no actionable violations  People throw legal arguments s no clue about law.
832620017145479168 2017-02-17 15:57:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 none r actual las violations. Think, where r chargs?
832619626097815552 2017-02-17 15:56:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 u make issue is Obamacare or nothing when Obamacare helps some but hurts others. I'm 4 other approach w no selected  victims
832619344861343744 2017-02-17 15:54:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 in that sense u has advantage born I US while I was born in poor country.
832611982998175744 2017-02-17 15:25:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 what unlawful act?
832611892933881856 2017-02-17 15:25:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 yet u argue quite reasonably in form of not in content.
832611684145520640 2017-02-17 15:24:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 only u & those who evaluate u know if u truly can't.
832611519020072961 2017-02-17 15:23:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I didn't say that. If u truly can't move forward & need help I'm OK w that. But many who could simply seek govt money.
832609164958564352 2017-02-17 15:14:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @yoshifan331 of course. that means nothing. Legal immigrants r not a problem. ILLEGAL ones r.
832608987912818692 2017-02-17 15:13:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TangoKimberly LEGAL immigration is welcomed. Illegal immigration not
832608832325087232 2017-02-17 15:13:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Zeke_Cervantez really? legal plumber quotes $500, illegal one quotes $200. Is that fair to legal immigrant who obeyed law?
832608606625337344 2017-02-17 15:12:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @YulissaG0nzalez most illegal immigrants r Mexican cause MX govt exports its failures. Time to clean up MX corruption so people stay.
832608388399906817 2017-02-17 15:11:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @YulissaG0nzalez I understand cause I'm an immigrant. But oppose ILLEGAL immigration. why is that bad?
832608222385160193 2017-02-17 15:10:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SOMEXlCAN they r here illegally & law states they should b deported.
832608112498601985 2017-02-17 15:10:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SOMEXlCAN just come here LEGALLY. simple.
832607947264032768 2017-02-17 15:09:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Twisted_Artist LEGALLY. that's the key here. people r waiting in line the right way & illegals want to jump over? that's not fair.
832607677297614848 2017-02-17 15:08:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ughcarelle yeah, with the Mexican flag in America? Typical idiocy.
832607544770232320 2017-02-17 15:08:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LemaBabi3 really? problem is ILLEGAL immigrants not legal ones. Go try stay illegally in Mexico & see how u fare.
832607308932857858 2017-02-17 15:07:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump I complaint about ILLEGAL immigration not legal one. U need to take head out of lib sand.
832607160597086209 2017-02-17 15:06:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SOMEXlCAN those who did so legally? YEAH!! Illegals? out! respect those in line doing things right.
832607037645344768 2017-02-17 15:06:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SOMEXlCAN children born in US r citizens. Their irresponsible parents should thought about this.
832606539567472640 2017-02-17 15:04:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> #DayWithoutImmigrants other than knowing it would happen it didn't have any effect whatsoever here.
832602525018816512 2017-02-17 14:48:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lazarogonzales1 legal immigrants & properly vetted refugees 4 sure. illegal immigrants & questionable refugees who could b terrorists? no
832602185607344129 2017-02-17 14:46:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @air_samurai @mcspocky sorry but kkk acts contrary to Bible. radical muslims act in accordance to koran.
832601968443015171 2017-02-17 14:45:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ABC more fake reporting? who said no more immigrants? ILLEGAL immigration is the problem. Why can't u switch the honest button on?
832601784757649408 2017-02-17 14:45:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @foodandwine come on food & wine, legal immigrants r not the problem ILLEGAL immigrants are the problem!! U should b ashamed of echoing lies
832601185693609986 2017-02-17 14:42:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump all those u mention came here legally. ILLEGAL immigration is the problem not legal one. Try being honest 4 a change.
832600782226735104 2017-02-17 14:41:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MSNBC @CNN @tteegar glad to see media going down the toilet. That's where s*** belongs.
832600533793898498 2017-02-17 14:40:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNN chente is a corrupt chauvinist pig. He should shut up & enjoy the money he stole from Mexicans.
832600154570125312 2017-02-17 14:38:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lula_reh media mental breakdown u mean.
832600015336067072 2017-02-17 14:38:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DisavowTrump16 he is POTUS. she is nothing. simple.
832599636774879234 2017-02-17 14:36:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RichardAngwin leaks about conversations are real but twist by fake media is FAKE. Simple, libs sound like birther conspiration toons now.
832599374685413376 2017-02-17 14:35:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AMTrump4PRES ditto here. no effect whatsoever. chinese restaurants were open :)
832599116488253440 2017-02-17 14:34:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Paradigm8472 Trump haters r starting to sound like the conspiratorial birthers they once denounced. Mirror mirror on the wall.....
832598617613443072 2017-02-17 14:32:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Miami4Trump I watched it & was like yeah! take on those suckers.
832598319532797952 2017-02-17 14:31:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I never drank alcohol, smoke, no drugs, no partying. Just work/study. Now reap results. More importantly, I became Christian.
832598125349109761 2017-02-17 14:30:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I don't believe society owes me anything but a fair chance. the rest is up to each of us individually.
832597996269367296 2017-02-17 14:30:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Perhaps my parents efforts without expecting govt help w my own working 4 results experience made me dislike US liberalism.
832597800076603392 2017-02-17 14:29:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I was 1st in family to go to college. Parents only finished elementary school south of the border. They worked 4 me to study.
832597578931920896 2017-02-17 14:28:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 u could be lying too. I take ur word @ true under the circumstances.
832597182448541696 2017-02-17 14:26:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Funny thing is that I studied law as personal not career goal later in life because I dislike/distrust lawyers.
832596922825318402 2017-02-17 14:25:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Reasons abound. R they insurmountable? That is the question.
832583880494424066 2017-02-17 13:34:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 no. Bachelors overseas in Latin America & Canada. Masters & law here, Florida.
832583432244981760 2017-02-17 13:32:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 why didn't u continue school?
832579634793414656 2017-02-17 13:17:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 so, what's ur education?
832579460733992960 2017-02-17 13:16:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 used to b. Many changes over past decade. $ pouring in real estate. Still too many service jobs.
832560604422537216 2017-02-17 12:01:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Florida. Maryland benefits greatly from fed govt spending that explains Dems bent.
832559790203273217 2017-02-17 11:58:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 nope. It's far deeper & wider than ur partisan rancor allows u to concede.
832559011975294976 2017-02-17 11:55:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 know about mozillo & countrywide? Look up preferredinterest loans 4 Dodd. Ignorance will kill u. Plot is thicker.
832558600459534336 2017-02-17 11:53:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @serenitylolmaug try overstay ur entry in Mexico & c what happens? All countries have immigration laws
832558335106940928 2017-02-17 11:52:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @serenitylolmaug nobody's keeping people out in general. People need to come in legally just like we do when visit their country
832412271234121729 2017-02-16 02:12:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ifuaskmee legal immigrants?
832409814919675904 2017-02-16 02:02:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 what state r u in?
832409568810565632 2017-02-16 02:01:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 just 1 of many options out there.
832409352703266817 2017-02-16 02:00:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 u can give urself all excuses u want but would do best by starting ur new tomorrow today.
832409147417169920 2017-02-16 01:59:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 dunno where u live but I know people u describe who did well 4 themselves. IE a blind guy who became a lawyer.
832408667475550210 2017-02-16 01:57:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 can go back to Carter community reinvestment act as cornerstone of lending that led co collapse in 2008.
832408272724443137 2017-02-16 01:56:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 nope. The bills forcing unwise mortgage lending & mixing banking w securities & others. Dodd Frank were part of the set up
832380524777893891 2017-02-16 00:05:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 depends on degree. I paid my way through doing all sort of jobs. Why couldn't u?
832380288860819456 2017-02-16 00:05:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 army? Know  a few who got their Ed that route. In most cases will=way. None of us is society's problem to resolve.
832380003115491328 2017-02-16 00:03:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 trades? Young people whine too much. U do what it takes nothing about being cut 4 it.
832379779835899905 2017-02-16 00:02:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 really? Did u know 2 @ center of mortgage mess? Dodd & Frank? They were. Dems!!
832379537321295876 2017-02-16 00:02:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 he did not "evade" he "avoided"  which is perfectly legal @ per SCOTUS decades ago.
832365652480495616 2017-02-16 23:06:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 u r on a personal tirade. I don't know u & don't want u to b hurt but I don't want to b hurt either.
832365451728519168 2017-02-16 23:06:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 best advice got from Indian guy: education lifts u up in wages. I can tell u it's true.
832365233658331137 2017-02-16 23:05:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 what I can tell u is to go back school,relocate, this country has opportunities but it's up to u.
832364988849389568 2017-02-16 23:04:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 really? I don't own stocks. I'm a real estate type of person.
832364674373021697 2017-02-16 23:02:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I've never been there & know about that & other places so?
832364403177746434 2017-02-16 23:01:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Obama is a socialist. There r many shades of socialism u know? Ditto w capitalism. Obama's past tells us lot about this.
832345714038546433 2017-02-16 21:47:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NaziPaiki @imcarolinalujan @HillelNeuer good 4 them.
832335320515481600 2017-02-16 21:06:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 now u want to minimize my effort? Chastise me 4 earning my lot in Life?
832335113149112320 2017-02-16 21:05:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I did manual labor while going to school. I remember days sleeping 4 hrs & wanting to give up.
832334847813177344 2017-02-16 21:04:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 maybe but I put time, effort,  & to educate myself to earn better. I didn't win lotto or inherited.
832334488361385984 2017-02-16 21:03:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Swiss is old money place. U r not rich? U get assistance to survive.
832334319356096513 2017-02-16 21:02:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I have close friends in both countries. Nice but no tx. Sweden's socialist bubble's bursting. Bad problems.
832332253762113537 2017-02-16 20:54:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 finally, something we can agree.
832332120605466624 2017-02-16 20:53:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 unfortunately Obama tangled then up in maqueliavelan way. Solution possible but not painless
832320735007883268 2017-02-16 20:08:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 u want socialism?Try Cuba, Venezuela & then let me know
832320498860249091 2017-02-16 20:07:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 capitalism does work. It's not perfect but is best than alternatives.
832320337991856129 2017-02-16 20:06:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Medicaid existed b4 Obamacare. Dems messed things up but can & should b fixed. Restore Medicaid to what used to b.
832293398900006913 2017-02-16 18:19:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> the root cause is someone entered/stayed here illegally. Not fair to people following law.
832292860061966337 2017-02-16 18:17:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HerreraLola I'm a brown Latino legally here. No worries about deportation.why? I didn't enter/stay illegally. Simple.
832292328387780608 2017-02-16 18:15:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JoyAnnReid @jorge_guajardo @silkie_izzy because we want laws enforced?
832292190974070785 2017-02-16 18:14:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @jorge_guajardo u mean that's the life of an illegal immigrant. Legal immigrants have no such fear sir.
832291996177952769 2017-02-16 18:14:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenCortezMasto political grand standing & nothing else. People illegally here can b deported. U work 4 us not illegals.
832290457325596674 2017-02-16 18:08:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 funny thing is I've never read inforwars
832290276072947712 2017-02-16 18:07:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 u don't. Never said that. I just said it shouldn't pin one group against other. That's socialism & doesn't work.
832290038792802305 2017-02-16 18:06:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 no. Medicaid has a role. I'm not 4 killing it. I'm 4 better control to avoid waste/abuse.
832269575089713158 2017-02-16 16:45:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 we both agree the we both deserve healthcare. Problem is Obamacare put us in competition. Why? Dems strategy 4 votes.
832269283593957377 2017-02-16 16:43:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I'm not rich. I work hard. Just don't want to work 4 others while my own family is hurt.
832269005889081344 2017-02-16 16:42:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 if u need help that's what Medicaid is 4. Govt killing my ins to give it to others is not right or fair.
832268709603471361 2017-02-16 16:41:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realchck if workers needed fine, establish work visa program like Canada. All legal, all fine.
832268472906293248 2017-02-16 16:40:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realchck I know plenty of legals who do those jobs. Others want jobs but cheaper labor wins. Illegals r exploited & legals hurt.
832246768268087297 2017-02-16 15:14:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 OK. Then start paying a friend's auto ins now. Put deeds behind words.
832237126821543936 2017-02-16 14:36:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 of course is dumb. Liking my premiums to take my coverage & pay 4 other's coverage is dumb.
832236900148768768 2017-02-16 14:35:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 sure. Search FL healthy kids program. Used to b great $120/mo now well over $200. Thanks Obamacare.
832236576847646720 2017-02-16 14:33:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @serenitylolmaug nobody has asked us to imagine otherwise. Illegal immigration is the issue not legal one.
832236399365672960 2017-02-16 14:33:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @manelo_23 undocumented? Illegally here. That's the truth.
832236158922977280 2017-02-16 14:32:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @evelyngmorales going thru process is sacrifice. Breaking in illegally is not.
832235924629180416 2017-02-16 14:31:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @srafalconhpms yup. All about I'll placed priorities.
832235807234727939 2017-02-16 14:30:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HYAdames fallacy. Issue is illegal immigration not legal immigrants. I'm a legal immigrants & oppose illegal immigration. Why is that bad?
832235475150704641 2017-02-16 14:29:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mass_konfuzion legal immigration welcomed. Illegal immigration is the issue.
832235098737082369 2017-02-16 14:28:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 would u pay triple auto ins so that others get free auto ins?
832234947050094597 2017-02-16 14:27:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 im not here to give my $ away. Paying premiums to subsidize others is dumb.
832234596137893890 2017-02-16 14:26:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 FL had great prog 4 kids. Obamacare doubled premiums & poor kids affected.
832233697508204545 2017-02-16 14:22:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Obamacare caused increases making it unaffordable. Obamacare took it.
832206738325647360 2017-02-16 12:35:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realchck illegal labor used to cheapen legal wages. Not fair to either.
832206551746301952 2017-02-16 12:34:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realchck just now: paint  house, legal  $1,200; illegal. $700. Bath work Legal $3,000, illegal $2,100. All involved latinos. Fair to legal?
832191504332550144 2017-02-16 11:34:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I cancelled cause I was giving something 4 nothing. I keep the money & self-insure.  Im Not crazy u know.
832191226761867264 2017-02-16 11:33:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realchck u may not even know it if u did or not. We need imm reform so people needed come w work permits legally. Best wishes.
832042131426570240 2017-02-15 01:41:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realchck They depress wages 4 legal immigrants. I c this often here. Legal wants $100 illegal takes $20. So? Screw legals?
832026313993154560 2017-02-15 00:38:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I told b4 I did. Premium/deductible tripled. No tx
832017027518828545 2017-02-15 00:01:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Alifaith55 drop by & continue destroying ur image. We the people will remember when we vote ur minions down in 2018

832007982070239232 2017-02-15 23:25:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @eatblueribbon I'm sure Chinese ones will b open.
832007842836127744 2017-02-15 23:25:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @blancaprico issue is illegal immigration not legal ones. U lock ur doors @ home right? Ea country has right to enforce its laws.
832007417881837573 2017-02-15 23:23:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realchck absolutely. But issue is illegal immigration not legal one. An intruder @ ur place u call police. Simple 
832007064583012353 2017-02-15 23:21:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Starry_Milli immigration is not the issue. Illegal immigration is! I'm an immigrant and oppose illegal immigration. Why is that bad?
832006545953157120 2017-02-15 23:19:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @oyameldc @zaytinya @jaleo @chefjoseandres I'm an immigrant too and oppose ILLEGAL immigration. Why is that so bad?
832005934788509697 2017-02-15 23:17:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 anyways, if healthcare is a right (@ libs say) why is ur right better than mine?
832003655415001090 2017-02-15 23:08:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I linked a news feed to both so? Btw yahoo is not conservative
832002515608666113 2017-02-15 23:03:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I said Chg it 4 something(s) that work 4 all not just some. It maybe diff options/programs
831987868784553986 2017-02-15 22:05:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I would also defend something that's free 4 me & vote 4 who wants to keep it. I understand u & ur fear.
831987585786470400 2017-02-15 22:04:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 u keep calling ur conjectures facts. Therein starts ur problem.
831987313945300992 2017-02-15 22:03:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I actually haven't seen any republican source @ u call it. Never seen Breitbart or the likes.
831973262494162963 2017-02-15 21:07:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mehdirhasan no, they didn't. Arafat's ploy to quote UN 181 was about palestinian state w 3 faiths in it. PNC still rejects recognition.
831971420418760708 2017-02-15 21:00:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> wonder why problem never solved?
831971158476128256 2017-02-15 20:59:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MEMagnello what good has that done so far? Time 4 Palestinians to recognize Israel's right to exist & then we can talk.
831970571940462592 2017-02-15 20:56:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenSchumer demamogue.
831949217363013633 2017-02-15 19:32:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TeaPainUSA Trudeau? He's Canada's Obama, a likeable empty suit
831947639889461248 2017-02-15 19:25:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TeaPainUSA @Lizardguy64 "expose?" That'll b interesting
831947501620051968 2017-02-15 19:25:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 OK if that makes u happy 
831947400793227267 2017-02-15 19:24:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 have u ever studied economics?
831947304403865601 2017-02-15 19:24:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 but u get subsidies right? Or did I misunderstand that?
831947166738419714 2017-02-15 19:23:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 so say u. Most people I know disagree w u. Premiums/deductible thru roof
831946935611359238 2017-02-15 19:23:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 no cause history of corruption since Arkansas. The Clintons r the real house of cards
831939451295301636 2017-02-15 18:53:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @2020fight @wombatkidd irony is that EC gave us Lincoln who did away with slavery.
831938199916310528 2017-02-15 18:48:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @2020fight @wombatkidd sure. States rights @ core when slavery was an issue but outcome is better than popular vote IE Canada.
831936710288236544 2017-02-15 18:42:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 look @ EU where high tx discourages productivity. It's insane, suicidal.
831936514129027072 2017-02-15 18:41:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 didn't say tx is punishment. Said tx code shouldn't punish success. Why earn more to lose it in tx?
831936247308382208 2017-02-15 18:40:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 obamacare is dying. Just read 2 more ins leaving. Doing nothing is not an option.
831936053741240320 2017-02-15 18:39:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 4 me it is. Could never vote 4 HRC.
831919907428261889 2017-02-15 17:35:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChrisJZullo I sympathize w daca kids but the excuse of the fee is absurd.
831919723877191682 2017-02-15 17:34:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HarmonyEliana some mayb criminals. Each case has to be viewed individually.
831919575964975104 2017-02-15 17:34:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RepGutierrez ICE's doing its job. Kid will get day in court unlike illegals in Mexico.
831918690815922177 2017-02-15 17:30:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RawStory this yenta is an offense to reason.
831918224681889793 2017-02-15 17:28:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mcspocky why would he? She's a smart lady.
831918127835381760 2017-02-15 17:28:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GeorgeTakei Other than Shatner being too old, why not? Enough with hate George.
831917830291542017 2017-02-15 17:27:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Im 4 medicare 4 those needy w strict vetting to avoid abuse. also, tort reform is a must.
831917654407598084 2017-02-15 17:26:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Healthcare b4 Obamacare was not good 4 all. Obamacare made it worse. We need other ways to deliver healthcare ie group buying
831917443232702465 2017-02-15 17:25:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Im libertarian mostly. progressive in some areas socially conservative in others. pragmatic, do what works. plain and simple.
831880415585636352 2017-02-15 14:58:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TareckPSUV @NicolasMaduro @teleSURtv Los gringos no se equivocan y el narco ese terminara preso en USA.
831878753601060864 2017-02-15 14:52:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JustinTrudeau @BevAzevedo then, why put it in danger w Pollyanna pols like trudeau? Look @ EU problem w islamic fundamentalism. Wake up Cdn
831878021233668096 2017-02-15 14:49:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 u actually did quite bad. U try to pigeonhole me to fit the way u view & analyze things. Truth, most people r in the middle.
831877084503011328 2017-02-15 14:45:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RavenHUWolf Is not loathing. It's appeasing the way Chamberlain appeased Hitler only to see him ravage England later. Islam is not peace.
831876555311820804 2017-02-15 14:43:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RavenHUWolf Wake up Canada. Unreformed 13 century Islam is a threat to us all. It's incompatible w our modern world.
831876272871657472 2017-02-15 14:42:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SAMAATV Hence immature. M103 is a threat to free speech to appease unreformed 13 century Islamic views incompatible w modern world.
831875717147267072 2017-02-15 14:40:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @bychristinebswk Because Cdn politicians r more mature than corrupt Pelosi & co. Give us high caliber pols & we can talk.
831875387625971712 2017-02-15 14:38:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @WakeUpCanada1 Islam takes any criticism @ blasphemy. Unreformed 13 century Islam is incompatible w our western values. We must stand firm.
831865026994663424 2017-02-15 13:57:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 well if u want a soliloquy go ahead & debate w the fictional personna u created 4 me.
831844030430511104 2017-02-15 12:34:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @marymurrah or if Obama &libs have their way our Western world won't exist in 50 yrs. Too many blind to Islamic fundamentalist threat.
831843510265475072 2017-02-15 12:32:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 wouldn't know. I'm not one.
831843426039713792 2017-02-15 12:31:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @2020fight @LongIslander57 @wombatkidd besides. It won't change so why HRC whine when she lost under rules?
831843230601854976 2017-02-15 12:30:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @2020fight @LongIslander57 @wombatkidd no comparison. Founding fathers got it right. EC works to prevent large states control country.
831656432642695168 2017-02-14 00:08:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 whatever. I have family in both countries & I used the system while I was studying there. Enjoy the evening.
831650897428115458 2017-02-14 23:46:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sofiaoh nice to have a civil positive exchange. Time to finish prepping Valentine's dinner now. God bless.
831650685519269888 2017-02-14 23:45:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sofiaoh I think most protest today is against Trump cause raids have always occurred. Funny thing is that I suspect he will offer something
831650215820197888 2017-02-14 23:43:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sofiaoh agreed. Needs revamping 4 needs/merit system & away from family reunification focus.
831650020373970944 2017-02-14 23:43:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sofiaoh Reagan's reform included amnesty & wall. DC took amnesty but did nothing about wall. This is why people want enforcement 1st
831649692786241536 2017-02-14 23:41:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sofiaoh sanctuary cities r the wrong way to go. They will lose at SCOTUS. Problem is long demagoguery w issue by both parties.
831649439064416258 2017-02-14 23:40:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sofiaoh 
831648592070836224 2017-02-14 23:37:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sofiaoh read 8 U.S. Code  1325.  6mo max prison 4 1st offense. It's criminalized in immigration law not criminal code.
831647886265958400 2017-02-14 23:34:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sofiaoh Obama deported 400k+ in 1 yr. Record 4 any POTUS. Where were the protesters then? Where was Ramos? Cozied up w Dems.
831647574776020992 2017-02-14 23:33:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sofiaoh who coded it but the hustlers who pose as our Latino leaders? They r part of the problem not solution.
831647275571048448 2017-02-14 23:32:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sofiaoh the term found in immigration law is "unlawful" which is synonymous w illegal. Would u be OK w calling them unlawful then?
831646913040674818 2017-02-14 23:30:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sofiaoh it's euphemism. Don't we call criminals those who commit crimes? Crimes r actions violating law.
831646158795767808 2017-02-14 23:27:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 OK I saw them at work & ur needs decided on ultimate cost/benefit analysis. Talk bout becoming disposable.
831645763134423042 2017-02-14 23:26:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sofiaoh but we need to start by candidly admitting they broke law & are illegals. No euphemisms @ that just infuriates public.
831645483449872389 2017-02-14 23:25:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @sofiaoh us born kids need special consideration. Perhaps work permit 4 parents until child is 18 & able to sponsor them.
831645017450151936 2017-02-14 23:23:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @EllenFabulous it's gotten to point that it hurts everybody.
831644809903353857 2017-02-14 23:22:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @EllenFabulous is tough. I know the places they want to escape from. But it's not about this lady but about 11million & more coming.
831620661609107456 2017-02-14 21:46:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 they r. I know cause I've seen them w seniors including my in-law.
831620462543306753 2017-02-14 21:45:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 what Canada thing?
831620361066258433 2017-02-14 21:45:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I don't. Teachers r underpaid but a few should go @ they r bad. Why people spend $ on sports over charity?
831620085873795072 2017-02-14 21:44:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I'm far from being 1% or even top 30%. I just don't want Robin Hood state  to rob me to help entitlement voters.
831581367003652096 2017-02-14 19:10:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 lived 4 a while  in Spain & Canada so I know universal healthcare. Don't like it 4 me.
831581087147163648 2017-02-14 19:09:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 didn't say that at all. Fix public schools so teachers unions stop wasting kids future.
831580817147252738 2017-02-14 19:08:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 never said that. Take a breath & relax. Govt is needed but this monstrosity created in DC. Too big.
831580574959726596 2017-02-14 19:07:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 u wonder why politicians excludes themselves from Obamacare? Or Canadians come here for treatment?
831580406981984256 2017-02-14 19:06:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 we can have options u know?
831580308604583936 2017-02-14 19:06:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I lived in 2 countries w Univ. System & didn't like long waits & death panels. Works 4 some but not 4 all.
831573740278444032 2017-02-14 18:40:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @halfbreedmex @raheelricky well libs r either elitist or blind minions here. Exceptions exist.
831573553946451972 2017-02-14 18:39:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @halfbreedmex @raheelricky I voted  4 him & can't make diff sense out of ur comment.
831573362568749064 2017-02-14 18:38:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 have life ins? If u like skydiving u pay heftier premiums due to higher risk. Why not same 4 smokers? Alcohol etc in obamacare?
831573118539952128 2017-02-14 18:37:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 u r so confused. I pay & don't expect govt to take care of me. Why is that bad?
831572837920100352 2017-02-14 18:36:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I told u b4 that I get it from as many sources as possible. The more the merrier. But no propaganda news.
831572405491478529 2017-02-14 18:34:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I do I fact. I paid about $22k in prop taxes alone. That's 4 schools, county, city, etc. Btw my kids go private so no benefit.
831572039936966660 2017-02-14 18:33:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @halfbreedmex @raheelricky "intellect can't be comprehend by likes of trumpties"? How else can this b understood?
831556304896409601 2017-02-14 17:30:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 if u want to give ur money away, go ahead. Ur choice but not mine.
831556169609121792 2017-02-14 17:30:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I don't have cable. I don't watch cable news. Fedup w them all.
831555968848764928 2017-02-14 17:29:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 1 person risks it all to start biz & u want to penalize success? What if it failed? Would u reimburse losses?
831555647208615936 2017-02-14 17:28:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 stating reality is not praise. I c both sides of the issue & think demonizing corps is wrong.
831548919691800577 2017-02-14 17:01:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @JustinTrudeau @AikMichouli heck no. Look at Europe.
831548704201007105 2017-02-14 17:00:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @halfbreedmex @raheelricky why do libs assume who voted 4 Trump r uneducated? That's lib elitism at best.
831548407382695936 2017-02-14 16:59:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus @BarbaraRansom5 dunno about Trudeau. Harper, Chretien, sure but Trudeau is a clown. Likeable but a clown.
831548140058767360 2017-02-14 16:58:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ajplus he read the speech. His masters prepped him well to tip toe around.
831547704773836800 2017-02-14 16:56:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @boldandworthy no. But how do we measure Chg? When is Chg accepted? If sessions acts racist now I'll b 1st to protest him.
831547217064361984 2017-02-14 16:54:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 help them learn how to live not merely subsist.
831547060084232192 2017-02-14 16:54:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 again I'm all 4 help TRULY needed. I c much abuse of govt programs here to make me sick.
831546787177627648 2017-02-14 16:52:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @boldandworthy my kids r even more of a mutt @ mother is Asian & I tell them they're Americans. No hyphens.
831546567861608448 2017-02-14 16:52:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @boldandworthy this was the 1st time I saw skin color @ detrimental cause race peddlers wanted me to think so but I said no & moved on.
831546350173052931 2017-02-14 16:51:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @boldandworthy honestly, 1st time I saw race @ issue was when I came to America but it wasn't whites but Blacks & Hispanics who made it so.
831546094232420352 2017-02-14 16:50:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @boldandworthy some background: I'm a bona fide mutt. I have among other native Latin American & Jewish in ancestry. I don't live that past.
831545828368068612 2017-02-14 16:49:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @boldandworthy IMO he is a race hustler not @ bad @ Sharpton but 1 nonetheless. He boycotted Bush's inauguration too. Why?
831545137285181448 2017-02-14 16:46:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Choices matter. America is land of opportunity but choices do matter. Chose wisely & we can succeed. Chose folly & writing is on the wall.
831543583949873153 2017-02-14 16:40:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I'm not rich. I'm OK. Should I feel guilty 4 having chosen school over partying? Waiting to have kids until stable?
831542563026956289 2017-02-14 16:36:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 never said that. I wrote b4 that I'm all 4 helping those who TRULY need help. Best help 4 poor is opportunities to do well.
831532722506043392 2017-02-14 15:57:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 love, hate? No emotions 4 me. Pragmatic view of reality that's all.
831532502472937474 2017-02-14 15:56:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @WayneDupreeShow I never watch that crappy network. Too much novels junk
831532179146625025 2017-02-14 15:54:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @sugaree4twenty she has a felony conviction
831531977962614784 2017-02-14 15:54:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @XXfounder she got justice. She is a convicted felon ordered out years ago.
831531799968903168 2017-02-14 15:53:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @G_Silva02 agreed. Having kids while illegal is not responsible
831531657266081793 2017-02-14 15:52:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @EllenFabulous would u let a squatter live in ur house forever just because he brings family as co-squatters?
831531222673276928 2017-02-14 15:51:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytimes @biloon what's wrong about deporting a few?
831531080742215681 2017-02-14 15:50:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @marniejoyce agree but she got years after deportation order. The law must be enforced.
831530766249164801 2017-02-14 15:49:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytimes @FemmesUnafraid about time.
831530602205741056 2017-02-14 15:48:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Ramos is pathetic. His emotional shenanigans r not what Latinos need or want.
831529649809285120 2017-02-14 15:44:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump the bureaucratic establishment POTUS Donald. They thrives in the swamp
831529311488339969 2017-02-14 15:43:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Both parties r sold to donors.
831497379337625602 2017-02-14 13:36:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 why u tell me? Tell the 40% entitlement class libs/Dems have created. They r the ones u r talking bout who vote Dem 4 that
831494422655295489 2017-02-14 13:24:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 don't expect anybody to pick up my bill. That is opposite of me. Btw, taxes rent?
831493902301589504 2017-02-14 13:22:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @boldandworthy other ones? Luv to know & consider
831493020092682243 2017-02-14 13:19:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Me @boldandworthy Dems r party of kkk, segregation. Use minorities 4 votes but do nothing 4 them.
831492581968195585 2017-02-14 13:17:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Me @boldandworthy I despise race hustlers of any color
831492388124229632 2017-02-14 13:16:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Me @boldandworthy it means what it reads. Lewis is prisoner of resentment. I admire Mandela cause his forgiving spirit led to peace.
831491913173913600 2017-02-14 13:14:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @2020fight @LongIslander57 HRC lucky outrageous DJT on the other side. She would've lost HUGE to others.
831491577407234048 2017-02-14 13:13:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @2020fight @LongIslander57 take CA/NY & che k popular vote. Thank to 4 EC we r. not hostage to 2 states.
831381053394784256 2017-02-13 05:54:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Amy_Siskind so, he did. Guess ur theory went down the drain now.
831380901783285761 2017-02-13 05:53:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @2020fight daily reminder to stop paranoia. HRC lost cause she was damaged goods & Obama's policies failed.
831380002046361600 2017-02-13 05:50:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @janeosanders sounds like previous 8 years to me.
831379682390077441 2017-02-13 05:48:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NancyPelosi he did. He shows leadership unlike u who's still around having lied about obamacare. Lost plan, lost doctor. R u resigning?
831379054368583680 2017-02-13 05:46:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @boldandworthy if it was about principle, resign. She didn't . She was Obama acolyte. she disobeyed & was fired.
831378641066024960 2017-02-13 05:44:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @boldandworthy racism is ignorance. I hate racism but don't like to toss accusations lightly.
831378335926194176 2017-02-13 05:43:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @boldandworthy do u know details behind the letter? 1985, Sessions prosecuted a voter fraud case & was accused of racism 4 it. Is he racist?
831343952569696256 2017-02-13 03:26:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Dinamico_7 I dislike both but Ramos is an obtuse hypocrite. Illegals r just that.
831343803701350400 2017-02-13 03:26:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Aquila7 correct. A mole looking out 4 himself & those who pay his salary.
831343577447936001 2017-02-13 03:25:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Aquila7 Ramos may b well intentioned but is stupidly obtuse. This Latino is embarrassed by such clown.
831343120986013697 2017-02-13 03:23:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @boldandworthy @Cure4Authoritis that was as well.
831343020335312899 2017-02-13 03:23:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 why? Cause I don't want to work only 4 Robin Hood govt to take it & give it away?
831342811018625024 2017-02-13 03:22:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 huh? Ur funny. I'm here 4 & by myself. I share my opinions.
831270086543568896 2017-02-13 22:33:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 my proof is 20yrs as CFO & biz. U need to learn bout fiscal policy & use in economics.
831269833757118464 2017-02-13 22:32:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 why rich aholes? U sound resentful, hateful. Not all rich rbad nor r all poor good.
831223595527442434 2017-02-13 19:28:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @USARedOrchestra Just because we want to b safe?
831223030324068352 2017-02-13 19:26:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @VicenteFoxQue @Jim42779245 absolutely. This country is open to legal immigrants. Why can't Fox understand this?
831209573721763840 2017-02-13 18:33:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Slate @mjs_DC His jurisprudence is well established & widely respected.
831209429131464706 2017-02-13 18:32:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AltStateDpt libs use courts to impose views. He is right on the dot. Courts should not legislate.
831209191951970306 2017-02-13 18:31:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenSchumer @SenWarren He will b more independent than Sotomayor and Kagan have been.
831207427727060993 2017-02-13 18:24:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GlblCtzn Sorry but she has zero chance in racist Mexico.
831207286047703041 2017-02-13 18:23:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill never understood why people w no voice or vote protest about US internal decisions.
831207157458694144 2017-02-13 18:23:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @VicenteFoxQue I respect Mexico and its people. Can u all respect our country and people? Stop coming here ILEGALLY. Simple
831206304966443009 2017-02-13 18:20:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thepunningman Wow, second photo I see and Trudeau is intimidated.
831206159344340993 2017-02-13 18:19:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CBCNews @marinaelket That explains why immature Cdns elected him.
831206048858046464 2017-02-13 18:18:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @boldandworthy Selective imagery. Really?
831205877973663745 2017-02-13 18:18:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MatthewACherry Trudeu looks defensive, intimidated. Trump looks confident.
831205577288212480 2017-02-13 18:17:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GettyImages @elamin88 his posture is one of being intimidated.
831205109702983680 2017-02-13 18:15:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Diane_7A She looks better this way, oopsie.
831204942752915456 2017-02-13 18:14:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ChrisJZullo on that logic: ban Germany, Japan, Italy. They killed many more Americans in the past! Ban is forward looking.
831200793667702785 2017-02-13 17:58:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 $ invested is used to finance jobs. Is not all under a mattress.
831200616303230976 2017-02-13 17:57:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I never said 0 taxes. I said when is enough? I pay taxes, plenty. 2016, $22k in property taxes alone. Enough?
831200090983452672 2017-02-13 17:55:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ketagoesglobal if u r not a lib then sorry. if u r sorry too. Be well. End of line here.
831199693178859520 2017-02-13 17:53:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 40% in bottom get $ back from govt. 20% of us all pay 87% of income tax revenues to govt. U want more? that's ur fairness?
831188414368141312 2017-02-13 17:08:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 whoa Nelly! U have no clue what I do . step back. I work hard & do what I think is right. Why r libs so judgmental? resentful?
831188009206894592 2017-02-13 17:07:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 abuses can & do exist but economic ideas worked quite well.
831187891724419073 2017-02-13 17:06:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 hoard it? they invest it & that's good. Hayek's economics (aka Reaganomics) worked @ did in Chile, England, etc.
831171051589603328 2017-02-13 15:59:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 no depression. recession caused by many factors. taxes is a small part. very small.
831170857183608836 2017-02-13 15:59:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I worked in plastics factory, floor cleaning, u name it. I worked hard to educate so I could make better $. Now, punish me?

831163877308116995 2017-02-13 15:31:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ShmooReport Absolutely. Primitive barbaric practices belong in 13 century not modern day

831163139983077379 2017-02-13 15:28:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Cookiemuffen Public posturing and private Trump's ring kissing. PM is not stupid to p-off POTUS.

831162350174662657 2017-02-13 15:25:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @washingtonpost @RichardAngwin @ketagoesglobal read it & researched further. Still c lib clouding around issue.
831161670814879744 2017-02-13 15:22:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I adapted & survived. We all can do it in this wonderful land.
831161569925021700 2017-02-13 15:22:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Been there. Used to be corp guy (CFO). Fed up w corp went to work 4 myself. But I don't generalize as u seem to do.
831161312013070336 2017-02-13 15:21:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Corps don't pay taxes. We all do through pricing!! Is that so difficult to understand?
831161062170968066 2017-02-13 15:20:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Jim42779245 illegal profits? absolutely. IE racketeering is a crime. But legal profits?
831123179896705025 2017-02-13 12:49:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Btw, how much is fair? Govt shouldn't ask what? 20%, 70%?
831122911800983553 2017-02-13 12:48:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I'm all for helping those truly in need who r far fewer than those receiving govt asst.
831122528068321284 2017-02-13 12:47:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I never been a freeloader. Worked my way through college and graduate school. No student debt here. Never received govt asst.
831122200438652928 2017-02-13 12:45:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @InferiusMor be well. May the facts lead u to truh eventually even when truth may b painful to accept
831121904949948416 2017-02-13 12:44:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ketagoesglobal u suppose but we don't know and speculation of motive is usually a blinder.
831121395065184256 2017-02-13 12:42:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RichardAngwin because judges acted on politics not law.
831121216731828224 2017-02-13 12:41:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ketagoesglobal Saudi Arabia has govt control. So does Egypt, Indonesia  6 list countries don't. Ban to review process long overdue.
831120929556164609 2017-02-13 12:40:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ketagoesglobal I've seen MX posing @ Central American refugees w genuine doc's 4 fake ID. These countries have govt control but corrupt
831120575733039104 2017-02-13 12:39:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ketagoesglobal Iran excepted, other 6 countries don't have 100% govt control so easy to forge new identity w no database to verify
831120265094561796 2017-02-13 12:38:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ketagoesglobal law is source. DHS implements. DHS created evolving list of countries of concern where govt not in control.
830960479300378624 2017-02-12 02:03:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @washingtonpost @RichardAngwin @ketagoesglobal I gave u link to law itself 4 u to read & conclude on ur own.

830915501656248320 2017-02-12 23:04:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Robin Hood govt is not the answer. Never was.
830877109820194816 2017-02-12 20:31:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 that's the problem. Govt shouldn't make u liable 4 others  social engineering has & will always fail.
830876784069574660 2017-02-12 20:30:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @InferiusMor Obama has 12 confirmed at this stage. Trump? 5.

830533534230142976 2017-02-11 21:46:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mattmfm @Ruminations17 why? POTUS went to camp David often 4 such things. Too much pettiness
830503693082574849 2017-02-11 19:48:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 No. I want my ins back & that can only happen w no obamacare.

830498952453750785 2017-02-11 19:29:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GeorgeTakei sorry but deporting people w outstanding deportation orders is routine and necessary.
830498396817457153 2017-02-11 19:27:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @politico @RebeccaMorin_ bs, when Obama did same they didn't whine so.much. Obama deported 2.5million or so.
830498193758679044 2017-02-11 19:26:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LeftSentThis if they have felony convictions, yes. Those r target of ICE

830493748714934272 2017-02-11 19:08:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I repeat: don't take my word. Research things 4 ur self
830478325030252545 2017-02-11 18:07:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 funny how I defend Obama who bailed banks but not homeowners & ws had record profits while w people lagged behind.
830476511580999682 2017-02-11 18:00:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Medicaid is still there. Obamacare made a bad situation worse. He lied bout it & is crumbling b4 our eyes.
830458692999008256 2017-02-11 16:49:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 u r sorely mistaken I'd u think I defend wstreet. Not at all.
830458525964972032 2017-02-11 16:48:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 no. But am not OK w taking my healthcare away to give it to entitlement program that is abused.
830458236314775554 2017-02-11 16:47:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 nope. Don't expect u too. We r ea responsible 4 what goes in our brain. GIGO remember?

830124461286383616 2017-02-10 18:41:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LouiseMensch if u do then see that 9th circuit made bad decision. Overturned 70% by SCOTUS 4 a reason.
830123869356904448 2017-02-10 18:38:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @BetteMidler yes. In SCOTUS that overturns 9th circuit 70%plus of time. 9th circuit makes bad decisions.
830123028109475845 2017-02-10 18:35:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SweeneyABC @ABC7News @glundle very liberal

830104803107807233 2017-02-10 17:23:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 No. Just ensuring u know where the whole thing started. It went diff paths from there. Some ok some nuts.
830104662745481216 2017-02-10 17:22:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I told u b4. I am ready to criticize when proper.
830104534357831681 2017-02-10 17:21:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I don't know if he was or not. Irrelevant to eligibility or legitimate presidency. Bigger legal picture 4 me.
830094813919838208 2017-02-10 16:43:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Billiam7 allusive, oblique suggestive remark? Like 9th suggesting discriminatory motive of Trump's  EO? Oh no, I get quite well.
830093571294425089 2017-02-10 16:38:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Billiam7 ok. Ur prerogative. U would b 2nd lib who doubts this Latino being educated. Go figure. Be well.
830087686887202816 2017-02-10 16:15:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 proof of what? thread is lost.
830087497241722882 2017-02-10 16:14:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 On travel ban? Wall? in agreement.
830087391067111424 2017-02-10 16:13:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 He's acting too fast. He's not familiar w typical political circus. Absolutely.
830087160262897665 2017-02-10 16:12:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 U have a habit of implying ur assumptions on me. I actually evaluate and question everything.
830087031191658502 2017-02-10 16:12:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 U miss the point: It's irrelevant now. He was eligible to b POTUS & I saw him as such.
830083562586120195 2017-02-10 15:58:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MovieJay @tgatp like him or not he's workaholic. Nothing like any POTUS b4 him.

830079726874193920 2017-02-10 15:43:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @POTUS @BarackObama @tgatp @MovieJay Well considering he's actually working unlike the oreo POTUS.
830078858770669568 2017-02-10 15:39:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @natureofthings7 problem is he lied about being in Vietnam.

830049034219950081 2017-02-10 13:41:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 again, nope. IE Trump is wrong in fighting Do in court. Easier to amend so it's clearer.
830048790618992641 2017-02-10 13:40:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 issue dodged Romney SR, Obama, McCain, and Ted Cruz. IMO Obama is a natural born citizen even if born abroad
830048579456741376 2017-02-10 13:39:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 his complaint is thought provoking about larger issue of natural born citizen. Issue needs to b clarified by SCOTUS.
830048316494848001 2017-02-10 13:38:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 a former Dem atty general 4 Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit bout Obama's birth certificate. He was w HRC.
830019143885848576 2017-02-10 11:42:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 nope. I don't hate.period.
830019050336051200 2017-02-10 11:42:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 w very very few exceptions CNN was the Clinton news Network
830018859943985153 2017-02-10 11:41:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 maybe. But w internal controls absent in failed states like Somalia
830018640015716352 2017-02-10 11:40:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 birther nonsense? U didn't understand my point.
830018442220728320 2017-02-10 11:39:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @guardian @Billiam7 judges have biases & do make mistakes. 9th circuit overturned 70% plus by SCOTUS!
830017959049515008 2017-02-10 11:37:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Billiam7 oh a typo caused by small pH keyboard suffices 4 u to judge my intellectual ability? Funny.
829851148358209537 2017-02-09 00:35:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @Lrihendry wow u r so lost.....Far from it
829851017449713665 2017-02-09 00:34:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @impeach_d_trump no the msg is that they don't care
829850873933230080 2017-02-09 00:34:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @timkaine of course u r. U r still bruised by losing to Trump & r OK w endangering us out of spite 4 Trump
829850654990598145 2017-02-09 00:33:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @tedlieu until it gets reversed by SCOTUS @ it is 70% plus of time!
829849912149942273 2017-02-09 00:30:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @guardian @Billiam7 sure, the Hispanic doesn't know English. Nothing like a "tolerant" lib.
829689707277742080 2017-02-09 13:53:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 going unhinged again? Take a deep breath & cool down.
829689487924015104 2017-02-09 13:52:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 or perhaps such countries have strong govt control? R needed allies? I'm not 4 unfounded cynicism.
829689070674649088 2017-02-09 13:51:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I don't make things up & face reAlity @ such. I'm very pragmatic.
829688817632288768 2017-02-09 13:50:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 agree. Ditto 4 CNN, MSNBC, and many others being in HRC pocket. Shameful on both cases. Journalism is dead?
829687865831473152 2017-02-09 13:46:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DaShanneStokes @Lizardguy64 IMO Obama is a natural born citizen even if born in Kenya.
829687750223884288 2017-02-09 13:45:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DaShanneStokes @Lizardguy64 rwmember, birther issue 1st came from HRC campaign. Valid question but differ w eligibility issue.
829687384744787968 2017-02-09 13:44:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 no. There's fake news propaganda coming from all corners.
829687134172938241 2017-02-09 13:43:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @guardian @Billiam7 his decision is devoid of law & abundant in inuendo. That smells like politics to me.
829686786628657152 2017-02-09 13:41:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lockjaw_sally I agree. Ivanka should talk about it not Trump. Perception is important
829686329193660417 2017-02-09 13:40:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 agreed but ban is cause Id validation in those countries is not possible.
829686021122043904 2017-02-09 13:38:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 @ChrisVoros I studied it in my economics class at college & master's. Surplus is a projection not reality. Account shifting.
829519659573583873 2017-02-08 02:37:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KamalaHarris who asked u to do such thing? Why Dems lie so much? We voters r not fools. We see thru Dem lies
829519289275265024 2017-02-08 02:36:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lexi4prez racist who sent kkk goon to death? Dems demonize to win.
829518829483073536 2017-02-08 02:34:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TheJusticeDept @SenWarren @BbiD get over it. 4 yrs from now u might vote Trump if he does well or vote him out if he doesn't
829518579066425344 2017-02-08 02:33:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TheJusticeDept @SenWarren then & only then u should indeed denounce him but recent behavior in Senate not acceptable
829518054019235841 2017-02-08 02:31:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Amy_Siskind @lockjaw_sally so? Wonder how u would feel if ur brands were attached led 4 politics.. never right.
829491164944416768 2017-02-08 00:44:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @WajahatAli ah the envy.
829490912321536000 2017-02-08 00:43:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @thehill where was this "ethics" chief when Obama lies about obamacare?
829490438222573574 2017-02-08 00:41:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @kristenschaaled u wouldn't either cause law allows u to do that. Don't like it? Chg laws
829490069597741056 2017-02-08 00:40:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CyrusMMcQueen like ur ability to foretell future. Tell me winning lotto numbers pls.
829489840496447489 2017-02-08 00:39:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Amy_Siskind this might b good time to remind u that not all women agree w such non-sense
829488807514951681 2017-02-08 00:35:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @AmbassadorRice u had chance, failed, & left mess behind.
829488538181890057 2017-02-08 00:34:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @rcallimachi @cjwerleman now isis opinion dictates our policy?
829488317896982528 2017-02-08 00:33:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @rmasher2 meaning most terrorists today r Muslim! If it were smurfs the same EO rationale would apply
829487948223672320 2017-02-08 00:31:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DaShanneStokes we can't fix past. Only deal w today.
829473707491991552 2017-02-08 23:35:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @IMPL0RABLE @alsweetgum ban targets failed countries who r Islamic cause Islamic terror destroyed them. Not our fault
829436062804107265 2017-02-08 21:05:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis so now I'm racist? funny. be well and hopefully safe until the moles wake up.
829435363949158400 2017-02-08 21:02:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis Believe me or not is irrelevant to me. I know this venue can be abused & ur doubt is understood.
829435060281565192 2017-02-08 21:01:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis that's how I see u. I know my facts and know what I'm talking about. U talk in vacuum.
829434652586827776 2017-02-08 21:00:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @IMPL0RABLE @alsweetgum Suggest u google shariah law ban in USA to know this is already being tried. Ditto in other countries.
829433666875097088 2017-02-08 20:56:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis I know. U think u know. the force is weak w u young padowan.
829433053168689160 2017-02-08 20:53:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 CNN is not neutral. Anderson Cooper is the only one close to neutral and that's barely.
829432813103509504 2017-02-08 20:52:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis My facts r based on experience. I personally know the cases I allude to.
829424663822467072 2017-02-08 20:20:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis point is that u said refugee vetting is solid when it's not.
829424534621138945 2017-02-08 20:19:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis I know such cases. That suffices to me.
829415781247115264 2017-02-08 19:45:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @WashTimes @lisang @marinakyritsis problem is all around so why import more? U just support my contention
829412141501394944 2017-02-08 19:30:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @WashTimes @lisang @marinakyritsis besides what I do know is that the refugee system can and is abused.
829412019640078337 2017-02-08 19:30:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @WashTimes @lisang @marinakyritsis Anyways the white dudes r born here but why bring potential danger in?
829411757814853632 2017-02-08 19:29:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @WashTimes @lisang @marinakyritsis I've never had neighbors like that (that I know of).
829402524323028993 2017-02-08 18:52:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @WashTimes @lisang @marinakyritsis u assume I don't know about refugees. I practiced immigration law a while back so I know.
829402359713366017 2017-02-08 18:51:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @WashTimes @lisang @marinakyritsis U underestimate a fanatic's conviction
829402189189758977 2017-02-08 18:51:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @WashTimes @lisang @marinakyritsis I could tell u about Mexicans posing as Guatemalans, Salvadorians. This r cases I know of.
829401997988216832 2017-02-08 18:50:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @WashTimes @lisang @marinakyritsis I means a waiting time 4 a committed jihadist.
829401843256197120 2017-02-08 18:49:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I don't "Trust" I consider among other sources.
829401721147445254 2017-02-08 18:49:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @WashTimes @lisang @marinakyritsis as I said, u r convinced otherwise & will probably rationalize it when it sadly happens
829400082634199052 2017-02-08 18:42:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/28/james-comey-warns-coming-terrorist-diaspora-democr/ not that it matters as u r convinced otherwise.
829395319049875456 2017-02-08 18:23:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis http://www.newsweek.com/how-isis-smuggles-terrorists-among-syrian-refugees-453039 let's educate ourselves
829386823201935369 2017-02-08 17:50:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Anyways, I use Kodi to scroll news around the world in English, Spanish, Portuguese and French. Others if subtitled (not many)
829386340638789632 2017-02-08 17:48:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 ok. I've been on yahoo 4 years too and had opposite view. Fox News, ok but yahoo.
829385871824715776 2017-02-08 17:46:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Yahoo is right wing? Man that makes pravda right wing too.
829385744657571842 2017-02-08 17:45:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis look it up. LA times, NY times, reports date back to March 2016 and current.
829375352308895744 2017-02-08 17:04:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 well the beauty of this country is that we can disagree & live. Time to go. Courts don't wait. Be well.
829371066602622979 2017-02-08 16:47:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Ike was not a politician. U point the problem: Establishment forges its own to perpetuate itself. Outsiders r a must.
829370805394014208 2017-02-08 16:46:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Yeah. I watched every debate and every interview possible. I made an informed decision.
829370627677102081 2017-02-08 16:45:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 murder rates in Chicago spiked under Obama while he did nothing about it.
829370214534017025 2017-02-08 16:44:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I didn't want a politician. I wanted an outsider to shake the bipartisan establishment & thus far I enjoy the results.
829369929795268612 2017-02-08 16:42:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Well I know the legal system in this country & don't have such fears.
829369822471270402 2017-02-08 16:42:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I fought Onewest's foreclosures more than once for clients so I don't particularly like the nominee.
829369660969738242 2017-02-08 16:41:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Again, u assume I dont' question. Thus far I agree w his proposals except the proposed Treasury Secretary.
829369421424631808 2017-02-08 16:40:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I believe I wrote during Obama's presidency. That's also a public record number.
829369295083798528 2017-02-08 16:40:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Things can change if he fails to deliver
829369211495514112 2017-02-08 16:40:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 given the choices? I feel good about my vote
829369062996209664 2017-02-08 16:39:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I love this country. I chose to live here and make a home here. I take that choice seriously.
829368921186779136 2017-02-08 16:38:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 If u define @ right wing all that opposes u, I guess so.
829368770275713024 2017-02-08 16:38:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 in extreme hands? yes. whether Hannity or Obama. Both extremes r bad.
829368645528723461 2017-02-08 16:37:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I did not.
829368570077388800 2017-02-08 16:37:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I'm more of a libertarian actually. I'm an independent voter though.
829368313750888449 2017-02-08 16:36:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Like confident people. I'm not here to destroy u though.
829368159106953218 2017-02-08 16:35:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I the same ways any person alive did plus working w state dept @ US embassy in LA at the time. Long narrative.
829367792348573698 2017-02-08 16:34:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Obama stuck to extreme lib views when lost congress. His arrogance was terrible.  GOP congress sucked too.
829367489272360961 2017-02-08 16:33:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 did I say that?
829366664588308481 2017-02-08 16:29:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Thanks 4 concern. I don't have such fears. I lost healthcare ins due to Obama's lies and paid 4 education.
829366423759757313 2017-02-08 16:28:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I witnessed it. nobody told me about it.
829366023165968384 2017-02-08 16:27:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I made a choice like some did w Obama. I'll see if choice was right or not.
829365860020150276 2017-02-08 16:26:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 It's been what, 3 weeks? Did u cry about Obama's inaction faced w 4k murders in Chicago alone?
829365686669570048 2017-02-08 16:26:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 EC based on popular vote per state right or is that now alt news according to u?
829365502740946945 2017-02-08 16:25:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/ look 4 us public debt records, study them & contrast to clinton's surplus narrative. It's simple.
829365029334032385 2017-02-08 16:23:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I gave Obama benefit of doubt and will do same w Trump. If he fails I will b first to criticize him
829364828070412288 2017-02-08 16:22:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Policy results. Political circus doesn't interest me.
829364648474456066 2017-02-08 16:21:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I want America to be safe and firm. Reagan's America stopped the marxist wave of death I grew up watching cause of Carter.
829364430605582337 2017-02-08 16:21:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I did? Wow. U r becoming unhinged. I don't know if he hates me or not & is not an issue for me. Safety, security, that is.
829364182856429571 2017-02-08 16:20:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Bush made his mistakes. Absolutely. But he is a link in a long chain that has never been duly repaired.
829363991822659584 2017-02-08 16:19:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 to get elected. He played on people's fears. Question is, why people elected him?
829363847534346241 2017-02-08 16:18:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I have never read or visited Breitbart's website. I avoid known extremes.
829363676192845824 2017-02-08 16:18:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I referred you to US Treasury records so how am I asking u to take my word for it? 
829363403164622848 2017-02-08 16:16:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis FBI and others said refugees can't be properly vetted.
829363290761474048 2017-02-08 16:16:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis really? how come feds r reinvestigating some since before Trump took office?
829362949663891456 2017-02-08 16:15:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis cause Bush clamp that Obama (fortunately) continued. Things changed w isis & that's were w r now.
829362715248455680 2017-02-08 16:14:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 U r confused if u think I take all Trump says as 100% correct or true. I don't. I care about results & am waiting to see.
829362515524063233 2017-02-08 16:13:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis Again, don't impute ideas to me. I fear all radicals but we r discussing a particular type now.
829362316386979842 2017-02-08 16:12:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 if u forge the mold then yes. Ur bias should b accounted for.
829362136283488256 2017-02-08 16:11:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I know my bit of history. We r not registering muslims and it will not happen. No paranoia needed.
829361889675194368 2017-02-08 16:10:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 also, "surplus" calculation didn't account 4 interest & off-budget items!! it was govt accounting enron style
829361571981836289 2017-02-08 16:09:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 numbers r annoying. Check US Treasury records. It's all political bs. public debt down while intragovt holdings debt went up.
829361219425464320 2017-02-08 16:08:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis 2001 is not 2017. before 911 things were easier. We need to deal w how things r now.
829361054832586752 2017-02-08 16:07:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 the whole Clinton surplus is a myth. debt went up by $281billion during 1998-2000. Check the US Treasury website not cnn
829359799762550785 2017-02-08 16:02:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I actually read news from around the world. I pride myself in getting as many viewpoints as possible and make my own mind
829359398464188416 2017-02-08 16:01:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 ask border people and patrol. facts don't meet ur narrative.
829359120721575937 2017-02-08 15:59:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis unfortunately concerns come from many corners. We r discussing 1 such corner.
829358922360352770 2017-02-08 15:59:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I can tell u I'm surprised at how many Latinos voted Trump here. BTW, some libs do hate me cause I don't fit their pet mold
829358613336571906 2017-02-08 15:57:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis we will only know when any infiltrated act. Asking 4 due care is not being a bad person.
829358282670235649 2017-02-08 15:56:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 race was for electoral college not popular vote as this doesn't count here & u keep on bringing nazis into equation.
829358129552965632 2017-02-08 15:56:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I can make rosy projections in mid air too
829358049026535424 2017-02-08 15:55:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 u mean "projected" surplus? How much debt did we pay w the surplus in the "lockbox?"
829357860467380224 2017-02-08 15:54:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 nope. congress is a problem & Obama is 1 of worst POTUS ever.
829357756415082496 2017-02-08 15:54:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I remember it vividly. Clinton "triangulated" Obama didn't cause he's arrogant.
829355868672106496 2017-02-08 15:47:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @Lizardguy64 no and no. I'm against illegal immigration and do support wall & other measures 4 variety of reasons.
829355659154092033 2017-02-08 15:46:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis I still prefer to live than to be victim of a fanatic's attack. Is that so bad?
829355292768993280 2017-02-08 15:44:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 what's this? distraction? Let's avoid tangents
829355189622677506 2017-02-08 15:44:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis against what background? Intel people cast doubts on this.
829354512167092224 2017-02-08 15:41:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis do u think its harder in places w little govt left?
829354082007662592 2017-02-08 15:39:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis vetted how? I can go to Guatemala and create a new id w a few bucks w a functioning govt there.
829353901489020928 2017-02-08 15:39:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis I'm a brown person dude. I studied Islam for 3 yrs as intellectual curious person.
829353577332297728 2017-02-08 15:37:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis Intel tells us isis tries to infiltrate refugees. Knowing this, what's wrong w more vetting?
829353349413761027 2017-02-08 15:37:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis one needs to manipulate Bible to justify this. U don't need to manipulate Koran to do it.
829353124972331008 2017-02-08 15:36:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis Now u r deflecting. I already mention these evil people should be punished.
829352635996241920 2017-02-08 15:34:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis Never said ALL muslims r terrorists or radicals. Said Islam is more prone to radicalization.
829350614463287297 2017-02-08 15:26:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis why r radical people allowed here? Why radical imama? R we crazy?
829350427342823424 2017-02-08 15:25:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis people a radical views come here to congregate w other radicals in radical mosques, whatsoever u expect
829350042867752961 2017-02-08 15:23:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @syeddoha I interjected at wrong spot. Not directed to h strictly. Be well.
829348636224061440 2017-02-08 15:18:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis has extreme vetting been done the parents would have been denied entry & kikler wouldn't be US cit
829348277514543106 2017-02-08 15:16:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis I know. forgot his parents? If they "assimilate" why 2nd generation radicalized?
829347695168987136 2017-02-08 15:14:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Soros? He does it all over the place.
829347538100748288 2017-02-08 15:13:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Sanders or Pocahontas would never win. too far left.
829347343845773312 2017-02-08 15:13:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 as 4 Bush, the Iraq war was dumb. But economic mess rooted in liberal housing policies go back to Bill.
829347062324064257 2017-02-08 15:12:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 add to that the internet boom and Bill was a lucky POTUS. I credit him 4 reacting to loss of Congress unlike Obama.
829346721092272129 2017-02-08 15:10:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 btw, Gingrich's Congress prevented Bill from going nuts into spending & Bill "triangulated"remember?
829346485221335040 2017-02-08 15:09:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 history goes way back. Reagan cleaned economic mess, bankrupted USSR and savings benefitted Bill.
829345680766488577 2017-02-08 15:06:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @Lizardguy64 he gets carried away. 4 sure. I wait for deeds to judge the man & so far I don't disagree w intended goals.
829345383318962177 2017-02-08 15:05:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 I voted about SCOTUS. Trump was not my 1st choice but HRC too corrupt. Trump Obama/HRC/DNC legacy not mine.
829344903335395328 2017-02-08 15:03:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 jobs? Service industry low paying jobs?
829344782317154304 2017-02-08 15:02:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 lowered def from obscene levels & added $9trillion to debt. Any moron can live on credit cards until maxes out.
829344498937380867 2017-02-08 15:01:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 that's a paranoid stretch & this from this brown Latino.
829344254770212866 2017-02-08 15:00:53 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Trump seems to oppose foreign expeditions. We'll see.
829344050058760193 2017-02-08 15:00:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 huh? Putin is about Russia not USSR.
829343896362745857 2017-02-08 14:59:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis I speak out of my experiences w them over span of 3 yrs when discussed Islam w them.
829343657002147841 2017-02-08 14:58:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis I'm all 4 help refugees but that can b done there. Infiltration & radicalization r threat. IE Orlando

829329397278728193 2017-02-08 14:01:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis why would we b so open to segments that r already radicalized?
829329272959549441 2017-02-08 14:01:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lisang @marinakyritsis secular Muslims r certainly diff IE most Iranians. Somali sunni Muslims r predominantly fanatic.
829328786344800256 2017-02-08 13:59:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lizardguy64 Reagan's goal was to finish USSR and it worked. Like any POTUS need makes 4 strange bedfellows. IE FDR & Stalin.

827882928462057473 2017-02-04 14:14:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @bethfukumoto want to switch Dem? Quit, run as Dem & win. Honor who elected u @ GOP w Trump @ top of ticket. Anything else is disgraceful.
827876726051053568 2017-02-04 13:49:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @brianklaas @flowershark but easier when koran/hadiths actually validates violence & intolerance.
827876419984306177 2017-02-04 13:48:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @brianklaas @flowershark point is that Islam prescribes violence as valid tool. Christianity doesn't. Of course u can find fanatics in all
827719355295227905 2017-02-03 03:24:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @France4Hillary @EnrelChi how many business have u been involved in? I could tell u horror stories about biz sharks
827718998330589185 2017-02-03 03:22:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @France4Hillary @EnrelChi only way to discuss is review financials which BK court surely did.
827679876702470146 2017-02-03 00:47:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @France4Hillary @EnrelChi settlements r  a coat/benefit calculation. I advised clients to settle cuz it was cheaper than litigating
827679581192777729 2017-02-03 00:46:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @France4Hillary @EnrelChi BK is not resigning. It's a tool. Do u understand or know it? I have in law school & practice.
827645175191175168 2017-02-03 22:29:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @France4Hillary @EnrelChi he's POTUS 4 only 2 weeks.
827645017657376768 2017-02-03 22:28:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @France4Hillary @EnrelChi 4 cos out of 100?   BK is a lawful tool. BK is in the US Constitution. I would use it if needed.
827636982079696897 2017-02-03 21:56:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @France4Hillary @EnrelChi POTUS can veto. It's on them all. Now they have Trump digging into numbers 4 real.

827628034589081602 2017-02-03 21:21:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MaggieJordanACN fyi, Eisenhower and Kennedy did just that. It's not unconstitutional.

827625580673822722 2017-02-03 21:11:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @FoxNews @jdowdell because khan sell out to Dems is useful. Wonder who is paying 4 his trips?
827625357020954624 2017-02-03 21:10:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @peoplefor @epstein_laura he is such a snake
827625103752052737 2017-02-03 21:09:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NewYorker @wrightr and quite staged photo op. He's a merchant of his sons heroism. Pathetic.
827624958331351040 2017-02-03 21:09:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MSNBC @KatyTurNBC of course it is. But not stubborn deceivers like him

827624191839047681 2017-02-03 21:05:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @dailykos @steve_seaton not the way Dems r burying head in sand...ers
827623987874295811 2017-02-03 21:05:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @dailykos @krs1page yup. An even bigger GOP majority courtesy of deaf Dems who still don't get it.
827623783750045698 2017-02-03 21:04:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @dailykos it takes more than demagoguery. It takes him and Dems listening why we rejected Obama/Hillary. Will he? They? Doubt it.
827623098144927745 2017-02-03 21:01:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Shizzletheland @JubieC6 @GrafHeysoos ASI que no soy Latino. No seas sonzo buey

827611834496798720 2017-02-03 20:16:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @brianklaas @flowershark Islam needs to go through its own Reformation. But how if it's a literalist religion?
827611646659026944 2017-02-03 20:16:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @brianklaas @flowershark I'm not idling in the past. Islam is stuck in 13 century and pushes conversion even by force.
827611379146354688 2017-02-03 20:15:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @brianklaas @flowershark had to catch up ur monologue. Nice to c u answering 4 me.
827609831926333442 2017-02-03 20:08:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @washingtonpost @KellyannePolls @myhlee if same u gave Obama 4 "u can keep ur plan/doctor" intentional lie, then yes.
827609459459555328 2017-02-03 20:07:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ProgressOutlook @Brix4815 I know disparaging is easier than actual debate.

827609098569076736 2017-02-03 20:05:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GrafHeysoos @Shizzletheland @JubieC6 no. Obama's turn left, specially w Obamacare, resulted in Trump.
827595263741218816 2017-02-03 19:11:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @POTUS @brianklaas @flowershark money, influence, why else?

827565940980211713 2017-02-03 17:14:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> his dad is more of a discredit playing a useful Dem  puppet w his hero son's memory.

827561924766396416 2017-02-03 16:58:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @brianklaas @flowershark no oil $, mo rich corrupt monarchs to fund extremism
827561778330599425 2017-02-03 16:57:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @brianklaas @flowershark let me explain. Corrupt monarchs IE Saudis, fund Islamic extremists schools abroad IE Pakistan as payoff 4 safety
827561321554202627 2017-02-03 16:56:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @brianklaas @flowershark so, the preceding 800 yr Muslim occupation of South Spain didn't happen?
827561039352967169 2017-02-03 16:55:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @France4Hillary @2ndlast2rise u too.
827554972636164096 2017-02-03 16:30:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GrafHeysoos @JubieC6 family reunification immigration system not best for US. Merit based is much better
827554730238996480 2017-02-03 16:29:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GrafHeysoos @JubieC6 Mexicans? Immigrants? Of course most r. It's about legal, not illegal, immigration. That's all.
827550965091926018 2017-02-03 16:14:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @France4Hillary @2ndlast2rise funny it was Teddy Roosevelt a populist who broke establishment monopolies. Bernie is passe.
827550716101328897 2017-02-03 16:14:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @brianklaas @flowershark peace and fanaticism of all kind don't go together. Even sports have brought out worse side in Europe.
827550438929072128 2017-02-03 16:12:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @brianklaas @flowershark u don't seem to understand how easy is to create id in places w little govt left.

827549718096052224 2017-02-03 16:10:02 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @brianklaas @flowershark read it. Crusades started to kick Muslim invaders out but did turn into something else later.
827549525258670080 2017-02-03 16:09:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @brianklaas @flowershark oh man....Public schooled? Islam occupied south Spain, Portugal 4 centuries until fought back & they were victims?
827548582446235650 2017-02-03 16:05:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @brianklaas @flowershark only reason Islam was quiet 4 while is Brits destroyed ottoman empire WWI. Oil $ has fueled resurgence
827548239230541824 2017-02-03 16:04:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @France4Hillary @2ndlast2rise that is a problem as is globalization sponsored by corps.
827548044749070336 2017-02-03 16:03:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @brianklaas @flowershark IE in 2010 21 of 22 world conflicts had Islam on 1 side. Even peaceful Buddhists had to defend against it.
827547067375550464 2017-02-03 15:59:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @brianklaas @flowershark it's been a threat since Mohamed invented it!! What do u think was the original reason 4 crusades?
827543501793525760 2017-02-03 15:45:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @France4Hillary @2ndlast2rise absolutely but all he did is kick problem Down The road. He didn't actually solved the underlying problems.

827542386976948224 2017-02-03 15:40:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @France4Hillary @2ndlast2rise not at this increasing ratio xcept during wwII 4 obvious reasons.

827183713524076545 2017-02-02 15:55:40 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @christiant33 IE, libs resort to activist judges to impose views instead of letting people decide. Extremes on both sides r harmful
827183458451673093 2017-02-02 15:54:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @christiant33 their idea of democracy is their way or the highway. Social contract requires compromise. Extremes can't ever compromise.

826655686297845761 2017-01-31 04:57:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ThomasMulcair debate what? U want open borders? Do it in and for Canada. Respect our sovereign right to make our choices.
826652144816238593 2017-01-31 04:43:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenFeinstein no he didn't. He correctly applies the Constitution.
826651747133296640 2017-01-31 04:41:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RepBarbaraLee amazing how Dems lie 4 pure politics. Miss the party of Kennedy.
826651235969273857 2017-01-31 04:39:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenWarren u have lost it senator.

826650840282832896 2017-01-31 04:38:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNN if so, he did it. We care about SCOTUS but don't care about pelosi lies
826650601064906752 2017-01-31 04:37:16 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNN reckless? Emotions aside lady, he is doing what all politicians should b doing w countries in list
826650335922028545 2017-01-31 04:36:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NancyPelosi ur common ground is Your way or your way.
826650133177700352 2017-01-31 04:35:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SpeakerRyan @POTUS @NancyPelosi no worries 4 me. Obamacare stole my healthcare insurance. Thanks Dems
826649923814834178 2017-01-31 04:34:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNNPolitics @CNN I lost my healthcare. Is she crazy, deluded, or is she simply an utter hypocrite?
826648899523837952 2017-01-31 04:30:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> good point.
826648591846502400 2017-01-31 04:29:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @merri_moran life is a standardized test.
826648374745128961 2017-01-31 04:28:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MaloneySuzanne it's not what they think but what we know. Nothing bad in wanting to b safe
826648136131215360 2017-01-31 04:27:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @umairh grow or survive blind political correctness? We must call a spade a spade. Unreformed Islam is a clear present danger
826647754797613056 2017-01-31 04:25:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JoshLeviMom yes wall, yes temporary ban from countries w doubtful governance. No hate, I just don't want to be blown up
826647377704534016 2017-01-31 04:24:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Philphitness I know.thats how I survived Obama.
826647222028738560 2017-01-31 04:23:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DefineAmerican wrong comparison. Non reformed Islam is the problem. It will destroy us unless we all push it to reform
826646607613554690 2017-01-31 04:21:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TristynCard mistake? Or recovery? Bush/Obama took us down the path to losing what made us great
826638832363769856 2017-01-31 03:50:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @rmasher2 @RichSaunders7 huh?

826621323145334785 2017-01-31 02:40:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @vinylchica I mean Obama could have replaced here younger justice now if she goes  & Kennedy retires .....See my point? She's 83?
826620930717786112 2017-01-31 02:39:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @rmasher2 it happened late in primaries and was framed as election issue. I only voted Trump because of SCOTUS and would do same again
826620553394024454 2017-01-31 02:37:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @vinylchica I felt bad 4 garland but couldn't trust Obama and Dems by then. I think Ruth screwed up by not retiring.
826620229891547136 2017-01-31 02:36:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @vinylchica pretty much everything.
826619390623875073 2017-01-31 02:33:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @vinylchica would love to do same. Have old Sony record player lying around somewhere

826618314394836993 2017-01-31 02:28:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @vinylchica politics aside, he is an impressive jurist much better than political hacks Obama appointed. Garland  is also excellent
826618006725865477 2017-01-31 02:27:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @vinylchica u asked me to source it, i did. Btw, nice handle if that's how is called.
826617839851335681 2017-01-31 02:27:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @vinylchica no. It's all about politics. Appellate courts r as important. Look at current tie vote.
826617616307462144 2017-01-31 02:26:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @vinylchica why?
826617559000678402 2017-01-31 02:25:58 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @vinylchica @Sensata2014 c, not all Latino immigrants want govt assistance
826617406386737152 2017-01-31 02:25:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @vinylchica @Sensata2014 respectfully, i don't care if u believe me or not. Didn't mean to sound presumptuous but answer was appropriate.
826615853965795328 2017-01-31 02:19:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @vinylchica i just did. Just Google his 2006 nomination to 10 circuit.
826615725485850624 2017-01-31 02:18:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @vinylchica this is why opposing him know is so problematic 4 dems. Approved him then and disapprove him now? Bad spot to b.
826615447726456832 2017-01-31 02:17:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @vinylchica look at wikipedia 4 his 2006 voice confirmation. Dems approved him so no vote needed. Acclamation only.
826614860448403457 2017-01-31 02:15:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @vinylchica funny. Not all Hispanics used govt assistance u know? Worked my way thru college, MBA, and law. Sorry i don't fit libs mold.
826614097546444800 2017-01-31 02:12:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @vinylchica what sorry? Lost thread.

826612609700990977 2017-01-31 02:06:18 UTC <tresmonsieur201> #notoneil Dems should look at Ruth, she should have retired when Obama was POTUS now she might cost Dems balance 4 decades
826612399285354496 2017-01-31 02:05:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> #notoneil He will b confirmed. Dems nightmare is Ruth passing, Kennedy retiring & Trump ending naming 3 justices......
826611822858010624 2017-01-31 02:03:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @SenateDems @vinylchica do u realize Dems approved of him before unanimously? This is funny. Libs r going nuts.
826611562832130049 2017-01-31 02:02:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Dsharma23 go ahead. Dems would b digging their political grave.

826069604493561857 2017-01-30 14:08:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @rickkirk7 amusing? No. Patheic? YES. Does he cry 4 each person killed by Islamic terrorists? Doubt it.
826068532710559744 2017-01-30 14:04:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @rickkirk7 Schumer is a hypocrite all politician.does he cry 4 each human killed by terrorists? 4 each Jew killed by fanatics? Doubt it.
826068136319414272 2017-01-30 14:02:45 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mitchellvii @WarpedSage I guess Schumer would have cried an Nazi ban. Does he cry each time a Jew is slaughtered by fanatics?

825842917910646784 2017-01-29 23:07:49 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @Bigheadag who jumped at epithet s here? Thus, who seems more driven by hate? Not me.
825836230151663616 2017-01-29 22:41:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @Bigheadag glad can c power other people's knowledge. Gimme winning lotto numbers.
825820934275751937 2017-01-29 21:40:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @Bigheadag do u know anything about shariah? Doubt it. If u did u would understand what I wrote.
825774551556571138 2017-01-29 18:36:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump time to remember establishment that current mess sits at Bush/Obama doors. They opened Pandora's box.
825774236597944320 2017-01-29 18:34:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump Absolutely. That is the true genocide ignored by media and politically correct politicians.
825773972755214336 2017-01-29 18:33:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump agree w u but best slow down to make EOs legally thigh.
825597623876907008 2017-01-28 06:53:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HillaryClinton Just remember Syrian refugee crisis is yours and Obama. This is the mess you guys left us to deal with.
825596668909338625 2017-01-28 06:49:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @POTUS @ACLU more lies. all about hate and propaganda. ACLU lost its way a long time ago.
825596361735299073 2017-01-28 06:48:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ACLU really? I dare u to walk around Miami and c how long before robbed.
825596148530438145 2017-01-28 06:47:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ACLU more lies: He said shut up to LISTEN as media is lost in liberal jungle. Honest and objective journalism is dead.
825595731088138242 2017-01-28 06:45:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ACLU @jackantonoff Funny thing is that any fanatic who gets in would kill LGHTQ as that's what their twisted fanaticism demands.
825595412748914688 2017-01-28 06:44:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> She did her job, the one Schummer and Barry appointed her for. Fortunately it goes to appellate and SCOTUS.
825595030723239936 2017-01-28 06:42:48 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Ms_Erika74 Erika, don't ask pears from the apple tree. Libs don't like to think, just to follow like lemmings.
825594847394402304 2017-01-28 06:42:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @realDonaldTrump @boulderauthor That is a valid point. I think EO was rushed. Meritorious but rushed and thus flawed. Correction needed.
825594670457688064 2017-01-28 06:41:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JeremyPond Oh we will specially if one person who enters kills our citizens.
825594519940915200 2017-01-28 06:40:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @TheDopePoet don't u guys care for truth: Is not a Muslim ban. is a temp ban for specific countries for specific reasons. Think!
825594118751531008 2017-01-28 06:39:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @DisavowTrump16 liberal hack, pal with Schummer, appointed by Barry. What to expect but play politics and endanger us all.
825593372551348224 2017-01-28 06:36:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RealUmairAhmad This is not a Muslim issue. It's a terror threat issue from countries plagued with such problem.
825593121094369280 2017-01-28 06:35:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @arjunsethi81 No loss dude. Injunction is normal. Wait and see. POTUS has more powers than u realize to protect us even from our loonie libs
825592878378450944 2017-01-28 06:34:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> So my duty is to demand people coming in be EXTREMELY vetted. Sorry, I don't want to die cause some fanatic from banned countries.
825592662015238144 2017-01-28 06:33:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @KaivanShroff ok bubble boy. Life has a way to burst bubbles: 9-11, Marseille, Madrid, Paris, Orlando, etc.
825592452006424576 2017-01-28 06:32:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @lingling23 Not a Muslim ban. A ban of countries known as hot beds of terror which happen to be islamic countries.
825592082119143424 2017-01-28 06:31:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @jamietworkowski what Muslim ban? It's a fallacy! It's a ban for specific countries for specific reasons. Get real libs, this is no game.
825591391006945280 2017-01-28 06:28:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @hankgreen @quiversarrow yup. If this were the 40s we would end up under Hitler's boots thanks to liberal lunacy.
825590993907044352 2017-01-28 06:26:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JustinTrudeau So has America and in far more numbers when we know who is coming in. Bad people can and do infiltrate refugees. U know it.
825501010181369856 2017-01-28 00:29:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LeahHackem premise is a fallacy.
825500841025163264 2017-01-28 00:28:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @inthefrow it seems those libs twisting the truth did.
825500482667962368 2017-01-28 00:27:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CharlotteAlter what muslim ban? Ban is to specific countries 4 specific reasons. If we can't start w the truth anything else is meaningless
825484764975087620 2017-01-28 23:24:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Echegaray why? She's just a regular person. She is more or less than anyone else.
825484476469956608 2017-01-28 23:23:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @ALT_MED_SYN she's young. She still has hope of rescue from mental disorder known as liberalism.
825482821833785344 2017-01-28 23:16:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nedfulmer I'm an immigrant. YES to EXTREME vetting.
825482565654024193 2017-01-28 23:15:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @pak1nextdoor u r not a threat. We know u. Many coming in we don't have a clue who they truly r.
825482049976938497 2017-01-28 23:13:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @WajahatAli they will also remember 9-11, Madrid, Marseille, etc. Better safe than sorry.
825471427306467328 2017-01-28 22:31:39 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @UK88TL @2ALAW Real rating will be massive landslined in 2018 and 2020 all while libs dream and dream and dream.....

825389002605940736 2017-01-28 17:04:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @spectatorindex it's more to it than corrupt slim want us to think.
825388196221554690 2017-01-28 17:00:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @metaquest finally, someone keeping his promises. What a change from previous POTUS since Bush SR.
825387895150276608 2017-01-28 16:59:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @mitchellvii good 4 them. They should fix their country instead of exporting it's failures.
825387553020866562 2017-01-28 16:58:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> well of course he is. Libs r total hypocrites.
825384274031423489 2017-01-28 16:45:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Suckerberg: no to Trump wall while he walls himself up in Hawaii amongst protests.typical lib hypocrite
825383359765417984 2017-01-28 16:41:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LouisJMarinelli neither, sarcasm. I lived through that in Canada and it's non-sense
825170543913603072 2017-01-27 02:36:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LouisJMarinelli which comment?
825126571300229120 2017-01-27 23:41:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> Are libs just echoes of others?Dismissive lemmings saying yes to the leader? We should converse so that we truly know who and why.
825126095477469186 2017-01-27 23:39:25 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @teasdale_adam both GOP and Dems have helped refugees. Why generalize? & Those who need help let's help them but not by sacrificing others.
825105377381457921 2017-01-27 22:17:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @teasdale_adam important thing is to help refugees not having them here. We can't admit here people we can't vet but we can help there
825104992923164676 2017-01-27 22:15:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @teasdale_adam of that were true but it's not. I lost ins due to Obamacare. Knowany decent people in same boat. Don't we count?
825092208000978945 2017-01-27 21:24:46 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @100PercFEDUP @ARnews1936 good.
825092153881788416 2017-01-27 21:24:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lrihendry never. He will create crisis 4 political gain. He's emblematic of worst in political behavior.
825091767695450112 2017-01-27 21:23:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @titojackson stand 4 LEGAL immigrants not 4 ILLEGALS.
825091292656963584 2017-01-27 21:21:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @CNN good. Let de Blasio be reminded bout nullification by the courts. He is a moron.
825091126302490624 2017-01-27 21:20:28 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @Lawrence and the law is tougher than loonie mayor's.why do u guys lies bout what sanctuary cities really stand 4? Lawleseness
825090751247876097 2017-01-27 21:18:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MayorGimenez @MiamiNewTimes new times lies as usual. Mayor did right thing by turning criminals over to ICE.
825090468614721536 2017-01-27 21:17:51 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NYCCouncil @MayorDeblasio @AndyPraschak I guess nullification doesn't ring a bell? Sanctuary cities r a legal fallacy.

825085864787181568 2017-01-27 20:59:34 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LouisJMarinelli this is like reading a dialogue between Cheech and Chong....
825085556329684992 2017-01-27 20:58:20 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HotNostrilsrFun @LouisJMarinelli @AhmSerius 1/3 of loonies I Gilligan's island 4 most Californians will vote NO.
825085275575549952 2017-01-27 20:57:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @YesCalifornia @LouisJMarinelli @teasdale_adam @UncleDeker attention seeker u mean? Probably right u r.
825085142033133569 2017-01-27 20:56:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @YesCalifornia @LouisJMarinelli @Nar_olepsy won't happen. Even Quebecois get it & they have reasons to leave Canada. It's DUMB idea
825084869600563200 2017-01-27 20:55:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @YesCalifornia @LouisJMarinelli loonies.
825084720480395264 2017-01-27 20:55:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LouisJMarinelli @YesCalifornia nope. Just b overran by Aztlan loonies. How did CA got so unhinged? Too much pot?
825084372437127169 2017-01-27 20:53:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @YesCalifornia that means 2/3 don't agree and yet u dimwits insist on dumb ideas? Sad.
825009810563293185 2017-01-27 15:57:21 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @VennMultiverse thanks 4 that. We all should talk to each other and discover that we have more in common than divide us.
825008896448274432 2017-01-27 15:53:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @VennMultiverse this issue was raised about Romney's father, McCain, and Ted Cruz, all GOP
825008722162438147 2017-01-27 15:53:01 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @VennMultiverse but I'm confident that if Obama was born out of US he would still b natural born and thus eligible.
825008524098994184 2017-01-27 15:52:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @VennMultiverse Trump jumped into the band wagon not about Obama being Muslim but natural born citizen. SCOTUS has never ruled on this
825008230451576832 2017-01-27 15:51:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @VennMultiverse mark Penn, Hillary's strategist in 2007 started the birther issue. On this advise Hillary referred to her US birth.
825007553151123456 2017-01-27 15:48:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @VennMultiverse you'd b surprised at how many Latinos voted 4 Trump here. I was shocked.
825003420557914112 2017-01-27 15:31:57 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @VennMultiverse don't think so. It's revolt of middle America against coastal liberal elites. Libs pushed too far left.
825003084871061504 2017-01-27 15:30:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @VennMultiverse nukes would kill him too. Let's not rush to judgment.
825002473811222533 2017-01-27 15:28:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @VennMultiverse dunno. Trump seems pragmatic populist. Never accepted by old $ could b reason. We'll see.
825001182808637440 2017-01-27 15:23:04 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @GOP @VennMultiverse power & money turn anyone into evil. Politics is too dirty now.
825000817006669824 2017-01-27 15:21:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @VennMultiverse if he fails I will vote him out. Sadly Dems gave us worse choice.
825000589226545152 2017-01-27 15:20:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @VennMultiverse I know people who did biz w him and they paint a diff person than personna, character, he played. I chose to give him chance
825000317368619008 2017-01-27 15:19:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @VennMultiverse I'm not white and would not vote 4 known racist. I believe he is bombastic, narcissistic, a brash new yorker, but no racist.
824999614071918597 2017-01-27 15:16:50 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @VennMultiverse ouch. I hate crime. Hope all works well 4 u.
824998378144677891 2017-01-27 15:11:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @VennMultiverse I didn't vote 4 Trump. I voted against Hillary & the corruption she now represents.
824998205033152515 2017-01-27 15:11:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @VennMultiverse I spoke bout him then & bout her know cause she enabled his behavior. She attacked his victims. So much 4 women's rights.
824997626152095744 2017-01-27 15:08:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @VennMultiverse and yes, our courts r filled w frivolous lawsuits. I can sue u if not like ur hair color. Dumb? Yes but sadly real.
824997320869703681 2017-01-27 15:07:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @VennMultiverse if hes found guilty I will help put shackles. Until then, all is about hate not fact. Why avoid Clinton question?
824991586652143617 2017-01-27 14:44:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @VennMultiverse I can sue anybody 4 anything. I'm in legal field. Anyways point is that libs turn the other way about Bill. Hypocritical.

824786423542906881 2017-01-26 01:09:41 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NYCMayor didn't mean to. Only illegals who committed crimes need to worry. Be honest 4 once.
824785272244170752 2017-01-26 01:05:07 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NancyPelosi machievallian move.....Bill passed in darkness

824784861642752000 2017-01-26 01:03:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @RepKihuen @NancyPelosi @POTUS u mean u were once ILLEGAL and then was legalized? Problems can't b solved until properly identified.
824767785741991936 2017-01-26 23:55:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @gsusa I guess enabler of sex predator was a better choice if she is a lib even if a fake 1?
824766732975882240 2017-01-26 23:51:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MarySneb107 I guess we Latinos r useful to libs as sellouts or victims but not thinking independently like me.
824766498271019009 2017-01-26 23:50:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MarySneb107 why bigot? I'm a Latino LEGAL immigrant. Studied Law and don't understand why a lawyer won't use correct term ILLEGAL.

824739099760349185 2017-01-26 22:01:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NewsHour @PBS @Bentell so does Soros and others on the left & what about liberal media complex? Journalism is dead.

824723967193845761 2017-01-26 21:01:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NewsHour @PBS @Bentell Obamacare is a fraud. A pyramid scheme to enslave votes.
824723689371566081 2017-01-26 21:00:24 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @NewsHour @PBS @Bentell shouldn't b a choice between Koch and Soros but that's what we r reduced to? I refuse that.

824686064329719808 2017-01-26 18:30:54 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LawyerRogelio @Sherrishaw14 funny thing is that I don't like Trump. Just disliked Hillary more.

824683378423304193 2017-01-26 18:20:13 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LawyerRogelio my question is reasonable unless it flies in the face of ur notion that all of us agree w libs.
824683108813467648 2017-01-26 18:19:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @LawyerRogelio :) do u realize I'm Latino? Hispanic? A brown 1 at that? Don't b ridiculous

823911413525594113 2017-01-24 15:12:43 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing yes govt has a role but greed goes beyond simplistic arguments.
823910764482281472 2017-01-24 15:10:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing I lived north, south, across the ocean and it's always the same.
823910662288146433 2017-01-24 15:09:44 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing time will tell but my life experience round the world is that liberal policies ultimately do fail.
823908947698581505 2017-01-24 15:02:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing people r flocking out of heavy taxed states so who will b left to tax? To consume?
823908757889490946 2017-01-24 15:02:10 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing question is, should they b heavily taxed? I'm all 4 social responsibility but govt goes to extremes.
823907946887344128 2017-01-24 14:58:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing I know 1st hand how unions protect mediocre teachers. Tenure is an illness to the system.

823905944895651840 2017-01-24 14:50:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing sorry but no, best schools r in wealthy districts where libs keep lib junk off table ie Weston, palm beach.
823905355092688897 2017-01-24 14:48:38 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing it is in some corners and teachers unions and liberal politics r found at the center of it all.
823904844847206400 2017-01-24 14:46:37 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing lack of good Ed. Here in FL we fight teachers unions wasteful and tenured rubbish.
823904045278593024 2017-01-24 14:43:26 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing being realistic is not being paranoid.
823903914948960256 2017-01-24 14:42:55 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing politics and religion permeate almost everything. Lack of objective Ed is hurting us.
823903684304269312 2017-01-24 14:42:00 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing I was lucky to be taught all sides of issues and then left to make my own mind.
823903310885376002 2017-01-24 14:40:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing remember GIGO? Being Indoctrinated is not equal to being educated. Look at Cuba, lots of degrees w little mind.
823899518949322753 2017-01-24 14:25:27 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing yes. Ed today is more about indoctrination thus people don't know critical thinking
823898941314007041 2017-01-24 14:23:09 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing we all should but we all don't. Liberal Ed is intolerant.
823896969462554625 2017-01-24 14:15:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing funny. Lefties call me right wing and right wingers call me leftie so I guess that puts me in the center.
823896116508946432 2017-01-24 14:11:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing ditto 4 GOP. Trump won as a populist not a gop conservative.
823895975244824579 2017-01-24 14:11:22 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing Obamacare is further right? The Dems need to return to the center or risk oblivion.
823895767026954240 2017-01-24 14:10:32 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing that flies in face of his writings over the previous decade.
823887605062201346 2017-01-24 13:38:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing btw, GOP today would reject Reagan cause it's turned far right as Dems turned far left.
823887353504796672 2017-01-24 13:37:06 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing too much to review in140 char. Reagan is widely viewed as Top 10 POTUS in history by cool headed historians.
823887107898966017 2017-01-24 13:36:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing without USSR we could reduce spending. Also, don't forget Gingrich's Congress forcing Clinton to the center.
823886894677315586 2017-01-24 13:35:17 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing I guess the USSR gone means nothing in the equation? Reagan deficits were used to bankrupt USSR.
823881350910459906 2017-01-24 13:13:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd @worldtosing clinton benefited from the Reagan/Bush cleanup including deregulation. He did what needed to b done and worked.
823878551841767425 2017-01-24 13:02:08 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @matthewjdowd personal approval cause Obama is a likeable person. But he was a mediocre POTUS and his results r poor.

821405370249842688 2017-01-17 17:14:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @POTUS @changemation Obama's eligibility was a valid question.  (c natural born citizen). Challenging Trump's victory is not.
821405029475250176 2017-01-17 17:13:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @changemation All LEGAL immigrants are accepted. Why do liberals have problems with the law?
821404894427041797 2017-01-17 17:12:42 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @changemation meaningless. Polls said Hillary would win remember? It's time to demand results and then we'll see.

821368357802876928 2017-01-17 14:47:31 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @dianeguerrero__ Ironic to use Obama's pic for the comment as he is the most divisive POTUS ever.

821038635181019137 2017-01-16 16:57:19 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @changemation Approvals in vacuum mean nothing. Let's see where they are after comparable 4 year period.
821038270775750656 2017-01-16 16:55:52 UTC <tresmonsieur201> No. Obama's eligibility was a fair question. Lewis is an old sourpuss upset because his uncle tom ways failed.

819240691947675648 2017-01-11 17:52:56 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @MerylStreepPage When Streep denounces the Clinton crimes then I may believe her sincerity until then she is a hypocritical awesome actor.

798576167007744000 2016-11-15 17:19:29 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @waltereighty8 So much 4 democracy. Petition to electoral college is an insult to common sense and our democratic history.
798575812161191936 2016-11-15 17:18:05 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @angela_rye There are idiots on all sides. Problem is when people pretend the idiots are only on the other side.
798575585513480192 2016-11-15 17:17:11 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @angela_rye So? We want LEGAL immigration. Nothing more. I'm Latino and demand an end to ILLEGAL immigration.

796374941570453504 2016-11-09 15:32:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @jorgeramosnews You and others like u are guilty of that because Trump is no racist. All he wants, like I do, is respect for our laws.
796374662531911680 2016-11-09 15:31:30 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @jorgeramosnews No se sorprendan si Trump provee una via para legalizar ilegales. Trump es practico.
796374426463903744 2016-11-09 15:30:33 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @jorgeramosnews Te fallo la teoria Jorge. Como Latino quiero orden y no mas immigration ilegal. No quiero mas mini-Mexicos en USA.

793825389730668545 2016-11-02 14:41:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> If we care about our rights and freedoms we can't vote for Hillary. We need to shrink D.C. and return to states' rights.
793824888150720512 2016-11-02 14:39:36 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JebBush I'm also a father who cares about the dangers a Hillary presidency poses to our country. The stakes are bigger than us individuals.
793824545228591104 2016-11-02 14:38:14 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JebBush America is great but in peril. You left us down by dishonoring your pledge to support the GOP candidate. Disappointed of you Jeb.
793824127412867073 2016-11-02 14:36:35 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @JohnKasich I supported Kasich in the primaries and are disappointed he didn't keep his pledge. It's a shame.
793823742749061120 2016-11-02 14:35:03 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @WeNeedTrump Well Bill was accused of rape. Hillary was the intimidatrix and now the couple is megarich at our expense.

793159403096670208 2016-10-31 18:35:12 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @nytimes The one who passed questions to Hillary? Good riddance.
793159095440314368 2016-10-31 18:33:59 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @HillaryClinton You owe us all an explanation and apologies for decades of arrogance. You are no queen.
793158659127799808 2016-10-31 18:32:15 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @donnabrazile :) Good try. Yahoo was hacked hence if classified info on Yahoo then what? Blame Hillary for the mess.
793158444291350528 2016-10-31 18:31:23 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @donnabrazile @CAPAction With media people passing questions pre-debate? Isn't that rigged?

791757814834266113 2016-10-27 21:45:47 UTC <tresmonsieur201> @shannoncoulter Why? I would vote for sexual predator Bill Clinton because he was a decent POTUS. We are not voting for a Pope.
