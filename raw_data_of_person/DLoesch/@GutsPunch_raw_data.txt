962706920032342016 2018-02-11 15:16:30 UTC <GutsPunch> Do you guys ever fall asleep while browsing, then wake up and your thumb is on the screen and you're on some random post and you're like OH NO DID I LIKE THAT?

950350176207679488 2018-01-08 12:55:13 UTC <GutsPunch> @RustlingRose A mask is a good idea, and wash your hands a lot. Also, if you have a doctor, you can call and ask to speak to the nurse. Most of the time they can advise without you having to make an appointment.
948229090397556743 2018-01-02 16:26:47 UTC <GutsPunch> Overheard my oldest son talking to his younger brother just now: "Sometimes it works, but if it doesn't, don't cry. Mistakes are just another way to show that you're trying."  So proud.
