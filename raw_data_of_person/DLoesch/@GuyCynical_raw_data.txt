948683305796423681 2018-01-03 22:31:40 UTC <GuyCynical> @realDonaldTrump @LadyJay_001 Thats the issue is too much government control - my insurance skyrocketed after the ACA passed and I can barely afford the co pay that quadrupled . It was better before they tried to improve it.
948682123862568961 2018-01-03 22:26:58 UTC <GuyCynical> @realDonaldTrump @LadyJay_001 You can buy health insurance anytime youd like , I started buying it when I was in my early 20s before the ACA ever came around. You dont need the government to tell you what to do.

940972213242654720 2017-12-13 15:50:32 UTC <GuyCynical> @Zeus_therealgod Well the Republicans are notorious for being pussies and not knowing how to put up a fight. They always put their tail between their legs and run
940964106512814085 2017-12-13 15:18:19 UTC <GuyCynical> @Zeus_therealgod And Im a libertarian registered as  republican because Libertarians never run a good candidate.
940963724285956096 2017-12-13 15:16:48 UTC <GuyCynical> @Zeus_therealgod Accusing someone of something doesnt make them what theyre accused of.  The guy has been in public office for 30+ years and allegations start now? The woman admitted she forged his signature? #FakeNews

938163687109644288 2017-12-05 21:50:27 UTC <GuyCynical> It seems that the women that love cock and the men that love pussy are always on two separate continents and are involved in a relationship with someone that loves neither.
938157918423265281 2017-12-05 21:27:32 UTC <GuyCynical> In fact isnt that the mans job to please the woman sexually as much as he can so she does not find another to please her?
938156922427117570 2017-12-05 21:23:35 UTC <GuyCynical> Oh how I would love to, anywhere you would like me to.

938152972399280129 2017-12-05 21:07:53 UTC <GuyCynical> Saying no is uncalled for in any capacity.  When a woman wants sex, you give her sex

936365321040072706 2017-11-30 22:44:24 UTC <GuyCynical> @w_terrence I agree, it's happened to me plenty of times.
936363585705562112 2017-11-30 22:37:30 UTC <GuyCynical> @singlesluttymom  done
936310084610772992 2017-11-30 19:04:54 UTC <GuyCynical> I was told once that I'm the type of guy you take home and fuck,  not take home to meet the family at the holidays.
936011992741171200 2017-11-29 23:20:23 UTC <GuyCynical> @LacyBlue_1 It's like you can see me
935920793464262656 2017-11-29 17:18:00 UTC <GuyCynical> @spottedahole Sharing is caring
935867112484155392 2017-11-29 13:44:41 UTC <GuyCynical> I help people for 3 reasons 1) you're paying me 2) my dick has been in or is going to be in you 3) we're related by blood   * Never 2 & 3 combined
935714359682195456 2017-11-28 03:37:42 UTC <GuyCynical> @NotYourFnWifey Stunningly sexy as always- you never disappoint 
935243794940874754 2017-11-27 20:27:51 UTC <GuyCynical> Chicks say they're into sex and they're super kinky until you get kinky and they get creeped out asking if you think they're a whore.
934580765811183618 2017-11-25 00:33:12 UTC <GuyCynical> @NotYourFnWifey Daaaammmmmn  hot af
934580308669804544 2017-11-25 00:31:23 UTC <GuyCynical> @NotYourFnWifey Wow... you're so gorgeous.

934422141864415232 2017-11-25 14:02:54 UTC <GuyCynical> @GingerGander I'll run the gauntlet and risk it still. I'll tell any woman if she looks good.
934398149925507072 2017-11-25 12:27:33 UTC <GuyCynical> Instead of using inches to describe my cock, I like to say its over half a foot long... it just sounds bigger.
934217305252421633 2017-11-24 00:28:57 UTC <GuyCynical> Maybe you're being too hard on  yourself, I could give you my opinion and see if you deserve to have someone hard on you.
934207373689917441 2017-11-24 23:49:29 UTC <GuyCynical> Dammit... manscaping gone wrong here, my balls are bare of hair.
934206608254660608 2017-11-24 23:46:26 UTC <GuyCynical> @singlesluttymom If you like creepy, you've followed the right guy. Well, not exactly creepy, I call it funny inappropriate.
934151122469736448 2017-11-24 20:05:57 UTC <GuyCynical> @singlesluttymom That's the same way I watch you, with my bone out
934127070464151552 2017-11-24 18:30:23 UTC <GuyCynical> Bukkake and cuckhold were the two I had to look up.
934057597430267904 2017-11-24 13:54:19 UTC <GuyCynical> Working on Black Friday so I'm not in the red.

933660411194376193 2017-11-23 11:36:03 UTC <GuyCynical> That's why so many guys try to be helpful and they send unsolicited dick pics.

933516621427236864 2017-11-22 02:04:41 UTC <GuyCynical> I'd be out on thanksgiving eve with my friends that came back into town, but I don't have any out of town friends... or friends.
933514663077318656 2017-11-22 01:56:54 UTC <GuyCynical> This is a prob for me, my inflection can be quite sarcastic at times. pic.twitter.com/FzonKQdQ8d
933510956520484864 2017-11-22 01:42:10 UTC <GuyCynical> I bet the 2x4s are made out of maple since you're Canadian- sweet sweet maple ass.
933507880556351489 2017-11-22 01:29:57 UTC <GuyCynical> I'm pretty good as a carpenter , I'd like to see if I could nail that.
933505619067310081 2017-11-22 01:20:57 UTC <GuyCynical> @_RiALiSE_ PA pike sucks - I'd rather run 80 across the state.
933471602427166720 2017-11-22 23:05:47 UTC <GuyCynical> My Thanksgiving eve is over, left the bar and headed home 
933470901747814400 2017-11-22 23:03:00 UTC <GuyCynical> @CaliAzona You don't know if it's harassment or unwanted until you try. I have never done that while in a position of power though. Never to one of my employees
933470356551041024 2017-11-22 23:00:50 UTC <GuyCynical> @CaliAzona I make perfectly golden brown marshmallows. I'm not sure what that means, hopefully it's good
933447031930146818 2017-11-22 21:28:09 UTC <GuyCynical> @CaliAzona I think I would like to give my opinion on that subject.
933135596091871232 2017-11-21 00:50:37 UTC <GuyCynical> @southpaw003 @BestLoveNotes Like a lumpy knee
933077505342353408 2017-11-21 20:59:47 UTC <GuyCynical> @shewitsch It gives me a reason to spend more money when I'm there and help build up your economy
933075139188723712 2017-11-21 20:50:23 UTC <GuyCynical> @shewitsch That's great for those of us from the states that vacation and own property in Canada. It's like a discount. I love it
933023423831461888 2017-11-21 17:24:53 UTC <GuyCynical> @sweet_n_sexy26 #letsgobucs
933022829943062528 2017-11-21 17:22:32 UTC <GuyCynical> My compass is slightly broken #AndTheMoralOfTheStoryIs
933022536425754625 2017-11-21 17:21:22 UTC <GuyCynical> @CaliAzona I'm not a fan of them, too many false readings even if you're not guilty. I took one when I was younger for a government research/training program.
933020801690939394 2017-11-21 17:14:28 UTC <GuyCynical> @Poutymcgee @herprettybones Uh.... I don't think so
932332961520934913 2017-11-19 19:41:14 UTC <GuyCynical> @CaliAzona I don't personally follow the rule, I've been in trouble for telling the truth when I don't have to. Remembering what happened is easier than remembering what I said happened, the truth always wins.
932330946086531072 2017-11-19 19:33:14 UTC <GuyCynical> @CaliAzona Selective information release.  Also known as Sir
932325636416397313 2017-11-19 19:12:08 UTC <GuyCynical> @Poutymcgee @musicntats There's no naked reflection in the glass, that would help
932083306383970304 2017-11-18 03:09:12 UTC <GuyCynical> @CaliAzona Daaaaammmmmnnnnn 
932024878311624704 2017-11-18 23:17:01 UTC <GuyCynical> @CaliAzona @bighurting39 @gordon_ike And first aid cream for my chaffed privates.
931969994753216515 2017-11-18 19:38:56 UTC <GuyCynical> @guy_next_to_me @CaliAzona The ones that complain about if size matters must have a size issue. #NotMyProblem
931952456711507969 2017-11-18 18:29:15 UTC <GuyCynical> @CaliAzona Small, medium or large - I love them all and would never discriminate
931945937815171072 2017-11-18 18:03:20 UTC <GuyCynical> @Copperminer92 @CaliAzona Can I be your Snapchat friend?
931673557322616832 2017-11-17 00:01:00 UTC <GuyCynical> @spottedahole You're very welcome
931666300388171781 2017-11-17 23:32:10 UTC <GuyCynical> @spottedahole My hearing is a little bad, but my vision is excellent - 20/30 last time it was checked. You're hot and I'd accept you in my DM anytime
931658031556907008 2017-11-17 22:59:18 UTC <GuyCynical> @CaliAzona *Hot .... damn AC
931657884471001089 2017-11-17 22:58:43 UTC <GuyCynical> @spottedahole You're the first in my list then
931657603226198016 2017-11-17 22:57:36 UTC <GuyCynical> @CaliAzona Conservative hit chick that likes guns and post selfies? Never take you for granted
931646529445748736 2017-11-17 22:13:36 UTC <GuyCynical> @spottedahole Maybe we should start one
931631304684265472 2017-11-17 21:13:06 UTC <GuyCynical> I'll add you to my list of acceptable ass grabbing, I don't want to be labeled a sexual predator.
931624683446947840 2017-11-17 20:46:47 UTC <GuyCynical> Guys like glasses because they can cum on your face and you can keep your eyes open without worry
931325114129494017 2017-11-16 00:56:25 UTC <GuyCynical> @CaliAzona Video of you running would possibly break twitter ... like shut it down.
931279839364915200 2017-11-16 21:56:30 UTC <GuyCynical> @CaliAzona Depending on who it is, sometimes that makes my day too
931160288853942273 2017-11-16 14:01:27 UTC <GuyCynical> @Kizisbomb It's amazing for taking a sip of water is actual news these days, what the actual fuck
931159798716010496 2017-11-16 13:59:30 UTC <GuyCynical> @ThePearlyGates6 Happy birthday beautiful!!
931121216429154304 2017-11-16 11:26:12 UTC <GuyCynical> @Homewrecker007 It looks like a dead hand is laying behind you, other than that it's extremely sexy.
931024733759471616 2017-11-15 05:02:48 UTC <GuyCynical> @CaliAzona Add bacon and eat it... bacon solves everything
930949092309721088 2017-11-15 00:02:14 UTC <GuyCynical> @ChrisMurphyCT the 2nd shall not be infringed. Deal with the mental health epidemic and use the laws on the books already.
930627599235207171 2017-11-14 02:44:44 UTC <GuyCynical> In my defense, my penis makes most of my decisions and is in charge of the barter system wondering what he gets when it comes to doing everyday things.
930559591573868545 2017-11-14 22:14:30 UTC <GuyCynical> @SunshinSprocket Let me know if you start a page. Have fun
930544821462274049 2017-11-14 21:15:48 UTC <GuyCynical> @SunshinSprocket Yeah there is. I don't remember what it's called, she was telling me about it. Some of it guys want to masturbate with and some want to cross dress with. There is a dollar for every kink
930541572122439681 2017-11-14 21:02:54 UTC <GuyCynical> @SunshinSprocket eBay is another way, but they have rules you need to get around. There's websites that are just for selling female intimate wear. I'm not a buyer, I just know guys are freaks
930540609957453825 2017-11-14 20:59:04 UTC <GuyCynical> @SunshinSprocket Here with sexy pics and a link for stuff for sale (use an alternate account)  take panties, nylon & sock request. She sold used socks with holes for $20 
930539589768531968 2017-11-14 20:55:01 UTC <GuyCynical> @SunshinSprocket I know women that still do that ... and sell panties
930502685480177664 2017-11-14 18:28:22 UTC <GuyCynical> Sometimes I think I might have a sex addiction problem.
930336599669379073 2017-11-13 07:28:24 UTC <GuyCynical> That's what I was inferring, you wouldn't be as innocent as her... you know what you're doing.  $1000 for a whole night or a few hours ?
930334887143510016 2017-11-13 07:21:36 UTC <GuyCynical> Always a favorite gif - I feel you wouldn't be so innocent looking as you did the same.
930333144968024065 2017-11-13 07:14:41 UTC <GuyCynical> Feel free to DM anything I may have missed, I'd hate to have Work ruin my Twitter experience by losing out on viewing extraordinarily beautiful breast.
930331870327463936 2017-11-13 07:09:37 UTC <GuyCynical> I unfortunately missed your boobs because work was crazy last week and Twitter took a back seat.  I'm sure they are amazing looking... btw... I love whores.
930329611770191873 2017-11-13 07:00:38 UTC <GuyCynical> I feel left out here, I've never received a pic of your boobs nor have I sent you a pic of my cock... I must be doing twitter wrong.
930248400494383105 2017-11-13 01:37:56 UTC <GuyCynical> Where are these DM rooms where hot chicks drop nudes and why haven't I been invited?
930242905318612992 2017-11-13 01:16:06 UTC <GuyCynical> I'm not a big fan of cutting down trees for Xmas... like what the fuck did that tree do to you? Firewood is ok, it's an actual fucking use of wood.
930208286883876865 2017-11-13 22:58:32 UTC <GuyCynical> @CaliAzona You've had plenty of cleavage selfies, but you're neglecting your butt... and I'm sure a sexy set of stems.
930192337837395973 2017-11-13 21:55:10 UTC <GuyCynical> @CaliAzona I wasn't sure if it looked ok or not, so I asked a second opinion and my penis firmly agrees that it's great.
930180727718727681 2017-11-13 21:09:02 UTC <GuyCynical> @herprettybones You've already done it with my pants, the world is next
930180560588288000 2017-11-13 21:08:22 UTC <GuyCynical> Women wonder what is wrong with guys- you do realize these are the same people that think sending a picture of their horrid looking sex organ will get them laid
930161340894851072 2017-11-13 19:51:59 UTC <GuyCynical> The floral print on your stretch pants don't make you look sexy, it just looks like a giant fucking garden is walking around
930160726936875008 2017-11-13 19:49:33 UTC <GuyCynical> @CaliAzona I offer a free selfie inspection service. I will let you know if any of them are blurry
930156775327911937 2017-11-13 19:33:51 UTC <GuyCynical> I was heading into a restaurant to eat and a 400lb+ Woman walked in before me, I decided just to leave because I was grossed out.
930147233131106312 2017-11-13 18:55:56 UTC <GuyCynical> @mrchapel @piersmorgan I can't believe I actually agree with you, amazing.
930120450449002496 2017-11-13 17:09:30 UTC <GuyCynical> When you're a cynical fucker and things go right, it's like a bonus because you were expecting it to go wrong like every fucking thing else.
930105370147684353 2017-11-13 16:09:35 UTC <GuyCynical> @Battlefy @JWonggg @BudLightEsports Hey let's give away shit because our beer taste like yeast infected piss... woo Hoo
930096230855856128 2017-11-13 15:33:16 UTC <GuyCynical> Maybe you'll drop those panties and let me take a lick since it's  #WorldKindnessDay
930079963205824513 2017-11-13 14:28:37 UTC <GuyCynical> I guess I shouldn't leave my house or talk to anyone today. #WorldKindnessDay
930079687921070080 2017-11-13 14:27:32 UTC <GuyCynical> @sweet_n_sexy26 I know how to get there if you want a ride in my fuck truck
929854698957561856 2017-11-12 23:33:30 UTC <GuyCynical> @AshLetsPlayNews @CaliAzona Yes they do, not giant, but not bald.

929839232792825861 2017-11-12 22:32:03 UTC <GuyCynical> @CaliAzona I think another pic is in order to make up for it
929745022890774530 2017-11-12 16:17:41 UTC <GuyCynical> @labelavenue @sweet_n_sexy26 If I come visit, do I use the Hershey highway?
929744551547424768 2017-11-12 16:15:49 UTC <GuyCynical> @SenJohnMcCain I'm rooting for the tumor
929552749687136261 2017-11-11 03:33:40 UTC <GuyCynical> Do you remember when you joined Twitter? I do! #MyTwitterAnniversary 3 wasted years... fucking woohoo!!pic.twitter.com/Yxbv9eiJQL
929176145911836672 2017-11-10 02:37:11 UTC <GuyCynical> I'd feel weird asking for a free meal at a restaurant because I'm a military veteran, but I'll accept nudes in my DM without a problem.
929174857916604416 2017-11-10 02:32:04 UTC <GuyCynical> Apparently saying "you look like a girl that sucked my dick in high school " is not appropriate when meeting someone.
929168906882834434 2017-11-10 02:08:25 UTC <GuyCynical> @lauraHabzXoXo You don't follow me so I can stay annoying for a little while
928051748194963456 2017-11-07 00:09:13 UTC <GuyCynical> @SenSanders Like the slaughter of innocent babies from funding planned parenthood?
928051440966356994 2017-11-07 00:08:00 UTC <GuyCynical> @SenSanders Agreed- end planned parenthood and the slaughterhouse that abortion is.
913118234865528832 2017-09-27 19:08:46 UTC <GuyCynical> @inkslinka This is why so many guys want anal from their women, maybe they'll be awesome at it.
911916844122066944 2017-09-24 11:34:52 UTC <GuyCynical> Don't believe #FakeNews he wasn't called a racist until he ran against democratspic.twitter.com/E0QbVmcCwU
911648354165239808 2017-09-23 17:47:59 UTC <GuyCynical> @SillySassySmart Will you DM me nudes? *asking for a friend
911562838136819713 2017-09-23 12:08:11 UTC <GuyCynical> I'm a pervert & she's a prude. She's called shy & I'm called rude. I'm surprised it's lasted this long dude.

910968997407068162 2017-09-21 20:48:28 UTC <GuyCynical> For fucks sake , she looked delicious today.
910938656373972993 2017-09-21 18:47:54 UTC <GuyCynical> @LeahRBoss I never thought I'd be jealous of an amulet.
910849772713541632 2017-09-21 12:54:43 UTC <GuyCynical> Can you get Workmen's Comp. if you chafed your dick running one off to a coworker during working hours?
910845145507155969 2017-09-21 12:36:20 UTC <GuyCynical> Office lady: what are you doing? Me: (with my dick out) there is a dick tasting here? OL: it's dictation sir, leave.

910169678215094272 2017-09-19 15:52:16 UTC <GuyCynical> Get rid of what makes you sad and keep what makes you happy. Life is that simple
909920027251486722 2017-09-18 23:20:14 UTC <GuyCynical> I'd like to go back a week and get a new start. Just a week -

909199846069981185 2017-09-16 23:38:30 UTC <GuyCynical> Not even a response.   It's like burning the olive branch  I thought we were stronger, closer  You're proving me wrong
908847583715627008 2017-09-15 00:18:44 UTC <GuyCynical> If you know me in RL and don't hate me- I'd be surprised. Maybe send a text and say Hi.
908847072098603008 2017-09-15 00:16:42 UTC <GuyCynical> @GingerGander If I saw Rosie's pussy, I'd kill my self too
908781155218018304 2017-09-15 19:54:46 UTC <GuyCynical> And just like that it's over.   Or is it?   I'd like to think it isn't .   I'm not wrong often... will this ruin my %
908775980948443136 2017-09-15 19:34:12 UTC <GuyCynical> Something about a whore in bare feet that I just really like
908721614304538625 2017-09-15 15:58:10 UTC <GuyCynical> Manipulative  manipulator conniving conniver
908721187018199040 2017-09-15 15:56:28 UTC <GuyCynical> Trying to be less of an asshole and be a nicer person, then I remember where it got me last time.
908687042275659781 2017-09-15 13:40:48 UTC <GuyCynical> I'm more comfortable with myself whenever I am being malicious and conniving.
908686543010897920 2017-09-15 13:38:49 UTC <GuyCynical> When your nickname growing up was a variation of the devils, it's difficult being kind. I try every day to fit in.
908685643848482817 2017-09-15 13:35:14 UTC <GuyCynical> Everyone always thinks that their darkness & hatred is deeper than the next. Only those willing to show it, prove it
908684883735797760 2017-09-15 13:32:13 UTC <GuyCynical> I've had multiple best friends in my 40+year-old life. Everyone of them seemed irreplaceable at the time. Lesson learned
908683377875841025 2017-09-15 13:26:14 UTC <GuyCynical> When you spend so much time with someone, every little thing reminds you of them when they're gone.
908682486049361920 2017-09-15 13:22:41 UTC <GuyCynical> Everybody wonders who is having the hardest time dealing with a mutual situation. Everybody hopes it's the other one.
908679785190174720 2017-09-15 13:11:57 UTC <GuyCynical> When you think you hear your phone chime but there's still nothing there and you realize there probably never will be.
908679060158640128 2017-09-15 13:09:05 UTC <GuyCynical> I guess forever is just a word that has to work for both sides.
908674272389992448 2017-09-15 12:50:03 UTC <GuyCynical> Work without play makes for a dull day.   Work with friends has come to the end.  Maybe I'll actually start doing work.
908671639629565952 2017-09-15 12:39:35 UTC <GuyCynical> I agree with the bear & I'll be saying no from now on although I thoroughly enjoyed saying yes knowing I was appreciatedpic.twitter.com/OxVhLGqBDx
908651708712144898 2017-09-15 11:20:23 UTC <GuyCynical> @auntielen3 I'd hope so, but I kind of doubt it sometimes.
908517889170395137 2017-09-14 02:28:38 UTC <GuyCynical> Have friends they said... it'll be fun they said.
908434852730609675 2017-09-14 20:58:41 UTC <GuyCynical> Trying to be a better person is not all it's cracked up to be. I liked it much better before
908434253125505024 2017-09-14 20:56:18 UTC <GuyCynical> Only if it could be like it was as far back as yesterday when I was there to take care and I was sent away not to stay.
908309740463153152 2017-09-14 12:41:32 UTC <GuyCynical> 1st day of loss is bad,2nd day is worse but it will slowly slip away with other forgotten memories that pop up randomly.
908308982967681024 2017-09-14 12:38:31 UTC <GuyCynical> When you clean up your room & throw something away, it's always a month later when you realize that something you needed
908306688700186625 2017-09-14 12:29:24 UTC <GuyCynical> The good thing & bad thing about the brain is that it forgets. Memories fade, people disappear & it's soon lost forever

908118472512610304 2017-09-13 00:01:30 UTC <GuyCynical> You can always change your mind
908109026185150464 2017-09-13 23:23:58 UTC <GuyCynical> Well nobody in RL or TL gets me, I don't think anyone ever will get the chance to either.
908108297626058753 2017-09-13 23:21:04 UTC <GuyCynical> No wonder nobody likes me, this is a representation of my personality. I'm a vain narcissist & I don't always like me.
908107701401649152 2017-09-13 23:18:42 UTC <GuyCynical> When your hate everyone & everything partner is gone and you're left alone to hate by yourself, it's not as much fun.
908107091088482310 2017-09-13 23:16:16 UTC <GuyCynical> I think I need a night out with a friend, a beer and some bourbon. Too bad all I have is the beer & bourbon.
908106702490357760 2017-09-13 23:14:44 UTC <GuyCynical> When you felt alone before and realize this is actually what alone feels like.
908106303893131264 2017-09-13 23:13:09 UTC <GuyCynical> Positive note , I'll probably lose weight eating lunch alone or skipping it entirely.
908100050022223872 2017-09-13 22:48:18 UTC <GuyCynical> Not mad Not upset Not happy Not sad Just not anything  Not even hungry or horny. Absofuckinglutely nothing.
908098583722897409 2017-09-13 22:42:28 UTC <GuyCynical> It's just not going to be the same.  Never will be Not replaceable  Never again.
908098246320562176 2017-09-13 22:41:08 UTC <GuyCynical> @RetreatStateC Where do they molest all the boys?
908091120357429249 2017-09-13 22:12:49 UTC <GuyCynical> Step 1 Delete all messages  2  change Avi to something innocuous, not a cute picture.  3 Delete all evidence & pictures
908059938790014976 2017-09-13 20:08:55 UTC <GuyCynical> The old saying goes the truth shall set you free....... it will set me free we alright, divorce papers and all.
908018846115794945 2017-09-13 17:25:37 UTC <GuyCynical> Growing up I thought the worst word you could hear is fuck. When you're an adult it changes to feelings & friend
908017619562909696 2017-09-13 17:20:45 UTC <GuyCynical> Things get better before they get worse, no sometimes things just get worse then fucking worse
908017408480305157 2017-09-13 17:19:54 UTC <GuyCynical> Positive note is that I'll have free time for self doubt and wallowing in my own darkness
908016947555696640 2017-09-13 17:18:05 UTC <GuyCynical> The bad part is I actually felt good about myself thinking I was making you feel good about yourself. Wrong = fuck
908016569720156161 2017-09-13 17:16:35 UTC <GuyCynical> Time to encapsulate myself & regress personality wise into the cold terrible person everybody's always known me as. Fuck
908016081981370368 2017-09-13 17:14:38 UTC <GuyCynical> I thought I had my personality fully adjusted so people would not be close to me so my feelings could not get hurt. Fuck
908015730406379520 2017-09-13 17:13:14 UTC <GuyCynical> Feelings = overrated   remember to eliminate them even further   Close all future gaps for feelings   Darken heart
908012966741774337 2017-09-13 17:02:15 UTC <GuyCynical> It seems that the road to happiness always ends. I think I've learned my lesson.
906243031942225920 2017-09-08 19:49:10 UTC <GuyCynical> @plockwood65 You followed me but forgot to send those nudes you promised.
906218450967769089 2017-09-08 18:11:30 UTC <GuyCynical> @_BurnsWhenIPee @brittwastaken But the question is what can I say to lick your butt hole?
906215418704142336 2017-09-08 17:59:27 UTC <GuyCynical> @auntielen3 
906184680264929284 2017-09-08 15:57:18 UTC <GuyCynical> I think today's one of those go the fuck home early days because I can't be around people without getting in trouble.
906183861641588736 2017-09-08 15:54:03 UTC <GuyCynical> I'm so angry right now I want to viciously tongue punch a pussy and beat it up with my cock.
906179958661406720 2017-09-08 15:38:32 UTC <GuyCynical> Trying to repress the guttural scream that work is causing..... Fuuuuuuuuck.
906158581162151936 2017-09-08 14:13:36 UTC <GuyCynical> @sweetpoutine See that's why we're friends, we  have the same thing in common
906152439061106688 2017-09-08 13:49:11 UTC <GuyCynical> Kind of feel like having steak for dinner & pussy for desert.
906149205898616833 2017-09-08 13:36:20 UTC <GuyCynical> I was told men get less horny as they get older, I'm like fucking Benjamin Button over here with a hard on all the time.
906146410856370177 2017-09-08 13:25:14 UTC <GuyCynical> The outline of my cock is clearly visible in my pants today, I guess I need to go with a untucked shirt to cover it.
905895852841033734 2017-09-07 20:49:36 UTC <GuyCynical> I'm angry & hate people but it's nothing a little ass & pussy eating followed by a good pussy pound wouldn't fix. Help?
905858239644016640 2017-09-07 18:20:09 UTC <GuyCynical> I sometimes think if I did not have kids, I would fake my death and disappear.
905501814820401155 2017-09-06 18:43:50 UTC <GuyCynical> My back hurts, I ate too much food for lunch and I'm horny. Today kind of sucks
905415301323513857 2017-09-06 13:00:04 UTC <GuyCynical> Probably not a good day to be around me unless you're planning on pulling your panties down and making me happy.
905414763672465410 2017-09-06 12:57:56 UTC <GuyCynical> Today feels like a good day for some NyQuil and Beer. Sleep the fucking annoyance away.
905411516605845504 2017-09-06 12:45:01 UTC <GuyCynical> Sometimes it feels like it's not worth saying anything, it's just easier to let it go and be unhappy.
905411122387353601 2017-09-06 12:43:27 UTC <GuyCynical> Nobody is ever truly satisfied or happy. I don't believe it can be done.
905161303483969536 2017-09-05 20:10:46 UTC <GuyCynical> @sweetpoutine You would marry him in a second, you don't just fucking want dick 
904786914749943808 2017-09-04 19:23:05 UTC <GuyCynical> @herprettybones Waiting for them in my DM - I'll appreciate the fuck out of them

902995114720722948 2017-08-30 20:43:06 UTC <GuyCynical> Yes my conversations always do lead to talking about sex. Because everything else is horrible.

902844289339805696 2017-08-30 10:43:47 UTC <GuyCynical> My face between your thighs, kissing all my troubles good bye
902585723081170944 2017-08-29 17:36:20 UTC <GuyCynical> Your legs on my shoulders, my cheeks on your thighs, tongue inside you and you're rolling back your eyes.
902326791586680832 2017-08-28 00:27:26 UTC <GuyCynical> I think I need some @CrownRoyal & a few beers.
902325856772775936 2017-08-28 00:23:43 UTC <GuyCynical> God: here's everything to make you happy in life except the heart to feel happiness.  Me: why?  God: you're an asshole.
902324347469168640 2017-08-28 00:17:43 UTC <GuyCynical> I'm good at everything I've ever done & things have always come easy for me without really trying, except contentment.
902323537909874692 2017-08-28 00:14:30 UTC <GuyCynical> Nothing's free and I don't need any money. I'm not sure what I need some days.

902322791906766849 2017-08-28 00:11:32 UTC <GuyCynical> Always surrounded by people but never more alone then when I actually was alone.
902319756254031876 2017-08-28 23:59:28 UTC <GuyCynical> I yearn for simpler times, easier decisions and the stress free life I once led.
902318602363260928 2017-08-28 23:54:53 UTC <GuyCynical> Single people are always "I want a life with someone"   Non single people "can't I just get a minute of fucking peace?"
902318027294859264 2017-08-28 23:52:36 UTC <GuyCynical> I'm starting to think I don't like myself & I miss the unfriendly reclusive mean bastard I was. Life was easier then.

898747587011911680 2017-08-18 03:24:57 UTC <GuyCynical> At least Trump's staff gets fired or quits. Clinton's would all be committing suicide or getting in an accident.
898741410295361537 2017-08-18 03:00:24 UTC <GuyCynical> I dislike people they're assholes, not because of their race, religion or sexual orientation. But they say that's why.
898731968204079109 2017-08-18 02:22:53 UTC <GuyCynical> She thinks she's not good enough or beautiful enough, she's actually better and more beautiful than anyone deserves

898297021064400897 2017-08-17 21:34:34 UTC <GuyCynical> When I go to heaven, I hope the gates look like your thighs & the entrance is your pussy, then it will truly be heaven
898269893857918978 2017-08-17 19:46:46 UTC <GuyCynical> @ThePearlyGates6 I report and block all of them. They're worse than vampires  trying to suck everything from people.
898173877976801280 2017-08-17 13:25:14 UTC <GuyCynical> When people ask if you have any hobbies and answering "I love pussy" is not socially acceptable.
898172787768143873 2017-08-17 13:20:54 UTC <GuyCynical> I can't figure out what mood I'm in today, I'm either angry, horny or happy.
898170403138543616 2017-08-17 13:11:25 UTC <GuyCynical> I've never met a nice girl with a tramp stamp, they all like cock, any cock.
898170035436498944 2017-08-17 13:09:58 UTC <GuyCynical> Your tramp stamp is faded, I don't know if it's because you're old or too many hands have been on your ass
898169531771871233 2017-08-17 13:07:58 UTC <GuyCynical> Dating is like fishing, you don't keep everyone and stick it in your mouth you have to throw some back
898169299759755264 2017-08-17 13:07:02 UTC <GuyCynical> It's called dating, not cock of the month club.
898168734183030787 2017-08-17 13:04:48 UTC <GuyCynical> Your pussy is so beat up it looks like ham barbecue when you're menstruating
898168000746065920 2017-08-17 13:01:53 UTC <GuyCynical> Your pussy is so beat up you need a re-straining order from all the dick you get
897923909160493056 2017-08-16 20:51:57 UTC <GuyCynical> It's funny that you act surprised that the douche bag guys you pick out are actually douche bag guys.
897895110527995904 2017-08-16 18:57:31 UTC <GuyCynical> Your choice in men remind me of sandals at the Goodwill, dirty, smelly and not worth a cent.
897893815616286720 2017-08-16 18:52:22 UTC <GuyCynical> That's a nice set of decision making skills you have there, I wonder why you're always unhappy?
897626182438486018 2017-08-15 01:08:53 UTC <GuyCynical> The world is full of shitty people... end of tweet .
897425616127094784 2017-08-15 11:51:54 UTC <GuyCynical> When you have a friend throwing you shade for no apparent reason. I'll show you shade motherfucker... a fucking eclipse
896518025624662016 2017-08-12 23:45:28 UTC <GuyCynical> Stay off the fucking road blocking & frightening people and you won't get run the fuck down #charlotesville
896471985680666624 2017-08-12 20:42:31 UTC <GuyCynical> @NotYourFnWifey Daaaaammmmnnnnnn 
896058090222534656 2017-08-11 17:17:51 UTC <GuyCynical> I'm fucking starving and I need a beer
895399963542392832 2017-08-09 21:42:41 UTC <GuyCynical> I don't consider myself a pervert , I'm an ass aficionado.
895264114238517248 2017-08-09 12:42:52 UTC <GuyCynical> I'll use the same razor to shave my balls and my face - I don't give a fuck as long as both are smooth for you
895120895227961344 2017-08-08 03:13:46 UTC <GuyCynical> No I didn't say "Do you have acid reflux?"  I said "you have an ass I'd like to re-fuck"
895111823682404352 2017-08-08 02:37:43 UTC <GuyCynical> @LeahRBoss If I complain about your ass, I hope you'll prove me wrong by posting a pic 
894006660791971841 2017-08-05 01:26:12 UTC <GuyCynical> @sweetpoutine You mad bro ?
892186954196025344 2017-07-31 00:55:20 UTC <GuyCynical> @southpaw003 Ewwww....
891823987495456769 2017-07-30 00:53:02 UTC <GuyCynical> 98% perfect isn't too bad... and every hot chick is messy and that's what autocorrect is for.
891816192842903552 2017-07-30 00:22:04 UTC <GuyCynical> Bad ass car, bad ass guns and bad ass legs... what aren't you amazing at?
891761061489250305 2017-07-30 20:42:59 UTC <GuyCynical> @Kizisbomb Agreed, the stuff I retweet or even original tweets are not always something I believe in, but find funny.
891757330961977344 2017-07-30 20:28:10 UTC <GuyCynical> @Kizisbomb That's why I have 2 Twitters . 1 for me and 1 for my job. Sorry you're going through this, opinions shouldn't threaten
891756138739486720 2017-07-30 20:23:26 UTC <GuyCynical> @Kizisbomb You don't have to explain anything to anyone- fuck them. I find stuff hilarious that's not my personal view, it's funny.
891474972866220033 2017-07-29 01:46:10 UTC <GuyCynical> @AlwayzInTrouble  is awesome
891462922056212481 2017-07-29 00:58:17 UTC <GuyCynical> @SillySassySmart Why am I not on that DM list?
891378313008214016 2017-07-29 19:22:05 UTC <GuyCynical> Ugh, why do you hate me Barrie? pic.twitter.com/ne7Y4eiBIU
891372681349693441 2017-07-29 18:59:42 UTC <GuyCynical> Agreed... it's very pedophile like & gross sounding to me.
891240641325301760 2017-07-29 10:15:01 UTC <GuyCynical> It's probably wrong that I'm not sure which one I'd be more enthused about, mid 9s or fucking you asleep.
891234956286078976 2017-07-29 09:52:26 UTC <GuyCynical> When it come to friends I can trust with a secret, you're my Linda Trip
891083092223512576 2017-07-28 23:48:59 UTC <GuyCynical> When someone thinks your super hot coworker is your wife because "you act like a married couple" *that would be awesome
890969483745124352 2017-07-28 16:17:32 UTC <GuyCynical> If you have nice nipples, please wear a thin t shirt, tank top or nice summer dress without a bra. We appreciate them
890957269986410497 2017-07-28 15:29:01 UTC <GuyCynical> @SillySassySmart We must have the same issue or my tweets just suck.
890671320299470848 2017-07-27 20:32:45 UTC <GuyCynical> When she is so sexy and beautiful that you forget what you were saying and stop talking... 
890632681955876864 2017-07-27 17:59:13 UTC <GuyCynical> @southpaw003 Because you're a good person and most people aren't
890568345426309120 2017-07-27 13:43:34 UTC <GuyCynical> "Turn that frown upside down".   Drop your pants and turn around to rid me of my frown
890567885457850368 2017-07-27 13:41:44 UTC <GuyCynical> @plockwood65 Sorry for your loss
890567755484811264 2017-07-27 13:41:13 UTC <GuyCynical> Some *people have internal hate burning inside of them for no good reason.  * me
890563963632668672 2017-07-27 13:26:09 UTC <GuyCynical> I'm going to start hanging out in the meth clinic parking lot, the girls are skinny and apparently make bad decisions.
890405589834231810 2017-07-26 02:56:50 UTC <GuyCynical> When you make a wish blowing out the candles on your birthday cake, is it wrong to wish that nobody touches your cake ?
890375126520221697 2017-07-26 00:55:47 UTC <GuyCynical> 
890256102104936448 2017-07-26 17:02:49 UTC <GuyCynical> @SaltyCorpse @SnizzleFrizzle I don't like big fat titties, anything over a handful is a waste as long as she has nice legs and ass

890046402465853440 2017-07-25 03:09:33 UTC <GuyCynical> I'm starting a job as a stripper, but reverse where I start out naked and I get paid to get dressed and leave the party.
889892883834298368 2017-07-25 16:59:31 UTC <GuyCynical> @SaltyCorpse @lasergirl70 You can go into settings and filter out words. I filtered out Trump and Russia and life is better now

889491212415225856 2017-07-24 14:23:25 UTC <GuyCynical> Keep that clutch leg strong for those power shifts !
889452260035637248 2017-07-24 11:48:38 UTC <GuyCynical> Well he didn't send a dick pic so that's good, but he himself is a dick so that is bad.
889298351723868161 2017-07-23 01:37:04 UTC <GuyCynical> I've had people text me happy birthday today that I'm not close to & I've been ignored by those I thought were close.
889297776936353796 2017-07-23 01:34:47 UTC <GuyCynical> When you're a better friend than they are. Sometimes it takes a moment to realize it.
889289647993618434 2017-07-23 01:02:28 UTC <GuyCynical> dilf is a real thing, just not as popular as milf. It seems young girls don't want to fuck dads like guys want to moms
889284604212936704 2017-07-23 00:42:26 UTC <GuyCynical> @fuzzlime Sorry again
889276318919077890 2017-07-23 00:09:31 UTC <GuyCynical> @fuzzlime Sorry
889253084433711106 2017-07-23 22:37:11 UTC <GuyCynical> Thank you !
889246960607211521 2017-07-23 22:12:51 UTC <GuyCynical> I'd like to thank everyone of my followers for helping me get to 200. I'll probably lose some over the next week. Meh...
889226483360833540 2017-07-23 20:51:29 UTC <GuyCynical> Twitter is made of women's broken hearts & souls with an added splash of perverted men who wish to take advantage of it.
889203534012579842 2017-07-23 19:20:17 UTC <GuyCynical> @shewitsch No, I'm a 407 & 400 mostly. Cottage country
889202928057282560 2017-07-23 19:17:53 UTC <GuyCynical> @shewitsch Barrie is the worst place for traffic, it seems like it's always under construction and backed up.

889096249328250881 2017-07-23 12:13:59 UTC <GuyCynical> It's actually my birthday today & unfortunately my DM is as empty as my soul.
888888601534181379 2017-07-22 22:28:52 UTC <GuyCynical> @NotYourFnWifey  as always 
888842837147758593 2017-07-22 19:27:00 UTC <GuyCynical> Left to right , which one would you happen to be?

888563623257231361 2017-07-21 00:57:31 UTC <GuyCynical> If I was British, I'd say "fuck right off wanker" way too many times.
888563199930454016 2017-07-21 00:55:50 UTC <GuyCynical> Ate too much food & had too much beer, now I'm laying in bed in my boxers at 8:55pm - get at me ladies
888560541492404224 2017-07-21 00:45:16 UTC <GuyCynical> I'm almost ready to sell my Twitter to the highest bidder. I have almost 200 followers. Sure some are fake accounts .
888546676880834560 2017-07-21 23:50:10 UTC <GuyCynical> I only send dick pics with a ruler next to it so you know I'm not lying.

888452620372901891 2017-07-21 17:36:26 UTC <GuyCynical> When women like something of mine on FB, I automatically send them a dick pic- I guess that's actually Twitter rules
888430082041278464 2017-07-21 16:06:52 UTC <GuyCynical> That sounds like bikini pics are going to be posted
888429707640934400 2017-07-21 16:05:23 UTC <GuyCynical> 
888405087579668480 2017-07-21 14:27:33 UTC <GuyCynical> Just saw a license plate on a 2017 Mercedes & a trashed 1997 minivan "truly blessed"  Perception of what you have is it.
888404180846735361 2017-07-21 14:23:57 UTC <GuyCynical> When you try to be nice & people take it the wrong way and think you're being sarcastic, maybe it's because it's rare.
888403737785532416 2017-07-21 14:22:11 UTC <GuyCynical> So I re-follow people without actually looking at their profile- that's a mistake 90% of the time. #creeps #prostitute
888397607193763842 2017-07-21 13:57:49 UTC <GuyCynical> @auntielen3 I see you
888198828029038592 2017-07-20 00:47:57 UTC <GuyCynical> Is it lyme or lime you put on dead bodies?   *asking for a friend

887768521500962818 2017-07-19 20:18:04 UTC <GuyCynical> Twitter has amazing beautiful women posting pics on a regular basis-there are none compared to a beautiful blonde I know
887764051798970373 2017-07-19 20:00:18 UTC <GuyCynical> @dani_goner Hope everything's OK with you.
887713359583490049 2017-07-19 16:38:52 UTC <GuyCynical> Another day, another hot chick with a sundress at work with me & this ones hotter than the rest.

887489018694438912 2017-07-18 01:47:25 UTC <GuyCynical> @SingleVixxen I wouldn't dare, I earn my followers the old fashioned way... bad tweets and comments.
887484965927235585 2017-07-18 01:31:19 UTC <GuyCynical> I shave my nuts because nobody likes hair on what they eat.
887483328470724609 2017-07-18 01:24:48 UTC <GuyCynical> @SingleVixxen What? There's nudes here? Dammit, I'm always left out.
887482885594329092 2017-07-18 01:23:03 UTC <GuyCynical> @auntielen3 Is there an online application or how does one sign up for this duty ?
887477467992272900 2017-07-18 01:01:31 UTC <GuyCynical> @auntielen3 Ahh... sleeping all day would be nice too, I don't get enough of that.
887474930689953792 2017-07-18 00:51:26 UTC <GuyCynical> Burger King is like the girl you like to fuck, but don't like kissing because you know she sucks a lot of dick.
887472662653669376 2017-07-18 00:42:25 UTC <GuyCynical> @auntielen3 My job has me in the party atmosphere all the time, my day off is not partying.
887472209702375424 2017-07-18 00:40:37 UTC <GuyCynical> @auntielen3 I will cherish any gift you give me.
887471909218242560 2017-07-18 00:39:26 UTC <GuyCynical> @auntielen3 This is my party plan looking at DMs like I did last year and drinking beer.

887395077852717056 2017-07-18 19:34:08 UTC <GuyCynical> @SingleVixxen In his defense, AutoCorrect always capitalizes the c in cock & nobody wants to go back to make their cock smaller.
887386573528068097 2017-07-18 19:00:20 UTC <GuyCynical> It's my birthday this week- I'll gladly accept nudes in my DM as presents all week from my female twitter friends.
887385705604935680 2017-07-18 18:56:53 UTC <GuyCynical> The pants I'm wearing today show the outline of my Cock to the point that I untucked my shirt to cover it. #PenisPants
887383959583281153 2017-07-18 18:49:57 UTC <GuyCynical> @herprettybones That would be nice, I do love it when you show your beautiful face once in a while though.
887325690865082371 2017-07-18 14:58:25 UTC <GuyCynical> When your job has you ride around with a hot chick in a sundress.... that's called winning.  
887323187507343361 2017-07-18 14:48:28 UTC <GuyCynical> With your legs, it doesn't matter. They'll all look extraordinarily sexy
887279863467585536 2017-07-18 11:56:18 UTC <GuyCynical> @KMADrunner You might want to change puppy food.

887099280556662786 2017-07-17 23:58:44 UTC <GuyCynical> @1MeLrO If it's fishy smelling or tasting, it's bad.

886983130267222020 2017-07-17 16:17:12 UTC <GuyCynical> I have to work to pay my phone bill so I can tweet shitty tweets that nobody retweets.  * wonders why I am working
886968003774087170 2017-07-17 15:17:05 UTC <GuyCynical> Happy Mondaypic.twitter.com/Cky72J6MCP
886746739897761792 2017-07-16 00:37:52 UTC <GuyCynical> I received a text from a female friend that said "I'm literally mortified by your last tweet".  
886745195773128704 2017-07-16 00:31:44 UTC <GuyCynical> Insanity is described as doing the same thing over & over again & expecting different results.  *My relationship advice.
886646666010533888 2017-07-16 18:00:12 UTC <GuyCynical> A colostomy bag is where I keep my true feelings for you.
886583647045918720 2017-07-16 13:49:48 UTC <GuyCynical> Used tampons are the Capri sun of the vampire world.
886400201191292928 2017-07-15 01:40:51 UTC <GuyCynical> @plockwood65 Looks like a douchebag
886297614832078848 2017-07-15 18:53:12 UTC <GuyCynical> Love your legs, but it is #NationalboobAVIday
886295519630426112 2017-07-15 18:44:53 UTC <GuyCynical> You're actually a rather good photographer.
886051086158712832 2017-07-14 02:33:35 UTC <GuyCynical> Out of all the boobs , pussy and ass I've seen over my lifetime, I still want to see yours    *DM is open
886044708354568192 2017-07-14 02:08:15 UTC <GuyCynical> @LeahRBoss More death than ass whooping
886043313253515265 2017-07-14 02:02:42 UTC <GuyCynical> @NotYourFnWifey Daaaaaammmmnnnnn......
885995450012233728 2017-07-14 22:52:30 UTC <GuyCynical> @auntielen3 I'm not sure how I feel about that, my urine in my pants or someone else's urine on my feet.
885936119447269377 2017-07-14 18:56:45 UTC <GuyCynical> Not everyone from Pittsburgh is like this bitch. #MakesUsLookBad
885909633747087360 2017-07-14 17:11:30 UTC <GuyCynical> If my lunch at this restaurant takes any longer to get here, it'll be dinner.
885908902247882753 2017-07-14 17:08:36 UTC <GuyCynical> It's nice when extremely beautiful women are actually  nice instead of being a bitch.
885908555395739648 2017-07-14 17:07:13 UTC <GuyCynical> I tell myself multiple times a day to be a good person and not ostracize people in my life by telling them to fuck off.
885894248423411713 2017-07-14 16:10:22 UTC <GuyCynical> Some of the nicest, kindest and most beautiful people I've never met are on Twitter.
885890761774026752 2017-07-14 15:56:31 UTC <GuyCynical> I'm just looking for some affection for my erection
885890547088601088 2017-07-14 15:55:40 UTC <GuyCynical> Good God, there's two of you? 
885882662656905218 2017-07-14 15:24:20 UTC <GuyCynical> @musicntats Anytime sweetie, I hate to see a sad face on such a pretty girl
885882364618035200 2017-07-14 15:23:09 UTC <GuyCynical> @sexyhornymom Yeah, the town gets flooded but I live way out in the country and I don't have to worry about that.
885858974859501568 2017-07-14 13:50:12 UTC <GuyCynical> @sexyhornymom Yeah, I know. There's flooding up in my county. Luckily I'm not affected
885853549430800384 2017-07-14 13:28:39 UTC <GuyCynical> @musicntats You might have tears, but your pretty face made me smile. I hope you have a better day
885851143913582597 2017-07-14 13:19:05 UTC <GuyCynical> Best way for a woman to win an argument is to flash her tits, pussy or ass  *starts arguments with every girl on twitter
885850494828240897 2017-07-14 13:16:30 UTC <GuyCynical> Pennsylvania is a goddamn rain forest anymore, I don't know if we can go a solid day without rain. It's fucking July man
885603384602046464 2017-07-13 20:54:35 UTC <GuyCynical> Sweet kicks, I bet the stockings that you'll wear with them will be phenomenally sexy.
885602438845169665 2017-07-13 20:50:49 UTC <GuyCynical> I've actually had dudes tell me "not to be gay or anything, but you smell really good. What do you do?" Wash really well
885601829169639426 2017-07-13 20:48:24 UTC <GuyCynical> @sexyhornymom Do I hear a fourth calling ?
885595382985764864 2017-07-13 20:22:47 UTC <GuyCynical>  that fucker is lost
885590866764730368 2017-07-13 20:04:50 UTC <GuyCynical> @NotYourFnWifey You're gorgeous, bitches like Barbie are fake.
885499072945246208 2017-07-13 14:00:05 UTC <GuyCynical> Extremely beautiful women with self-esteem problems amaze me that they can't see their own beauty inside & out.
885457183898521600 2017-07-13 11:13:38 UTC <GuyCynical> @sexyhornymom Everyone always says "Fuck Cancer" and I'm a Leo
885354027428577280 2017-07-12 04:23:43 UTC <GuyCynical> I pick out loose moral slutty girls like a lion picks out a weak gazelle & I want to take them from behind & eat like it
885350270431047681 2017-07-12 04:08:48 UTC <GuyCynical> @auntielen3 If you ever get your tit tat,I'd like to see that.
885349795552006144 2017-07-12 04:06:54 UTC <GuyCynical> @auntielen3 Would the tat of a tit be on your tit?
885349442957828096 2017-07-12 04:05:30 UTC <GuyCynical> @JenniferJokes Happy birthday. 
885349305917345793 2017-07-12 04:04:58 UTC <GuyCynical> @auntielen3 Oh, if I had a tat, I'd trade for your tit.
885348758816509952 2017-07-12 04:02:47 UTC <GuyCynical> @auntielen3 Not sure what this means, but it has tit in it and I'm interested
885346806212829185 2017-07-12 03:55:02 UTC <GuyCynical> I wish I was born between June 21st through July 22nd so everyone wanted to fuck me.
885342675532214272 2017-07-12 03:38:37 UTC <GuyCynical> Sorry I blurted out "ham sandwich" when you pulled off your panties... where are you going, can we still do it?
885342002035994624 2017-07-12 03:35:56 UTC <GuyCynical> I've started tweeting more and I've lost 1 more follower and I'm down to 197. I guess I need breast implants & a new avi
885336157608976384 2017-07-12 03:12:43 UTC <GuyCynical> Women want a bad boy that's a good guy, a jerk that's a nice guy, a sexual freak that's faithful. Girls like unicorns
885334244825944064 2017-07-12 03:05:07 UTC <GuyCynical> I filtered out "trump" & "Russia" from my TL and things have never been better.
885280536113098752 2017-07-12 23:31:42 UTC <GuyCynical> That bass thumping in your 1997 dirty cavalier will certainly pull all the pussy... keep it up
885279355248803840 2017-07-12 23:27:00 UTC <GuyCynical> @realDonaldTrump @auntielen3 You lost me after deep throat
885275483700690945 2017-07-12 23:11:37 UTC <GuyCynical> I'm starting to think @auntielen3 is my new friend,I'll ruin it soon enough.  *sends dick pic & emotional plea to her DM
885253102139473920 2017-07-12 21:42:41 UTC <GuyCynical> If you like or retweet four or more of mine, were automatically friends.   * everyone retract their likes and retweets
885252186581716992 2017-07-12 21:39:03 UTC <GuyCynical> @auntielen3 Nobody listens to what I say under 140 characters
885251968347901953 2017-07-12 21:38:11 UTC <GuyCynical> People hate liars but when you're honest people hate you more
885251554613309442 2017-07-12 21:36:32 UTC <GuyCynical> I'd rather have you DM me a pic of your face to see how beautiful you are instead of nudes, but I will accept nudes also
885250078910418944 2017-07-12 21:30:40 UTC <GuyCynical> Even the cute animal filters on Snapchat don't help the  really ugly chicks
885249539040567297 2017-07-12 21:28:31 UTC <GuyCynical> A hot chick I dated many years ago wants to rekindle the flame because her husband doesn't touch her anymore. #StillHot
885248436043436034 2017-07-12 21:24:08 UTC <GuyCynical> Sometimes I hate how wonderful, beautiful, sexy and loving she is.
885247010563121152 2017-07-12 21:18:29 UTC <GuyCynical> I once had a girl warn me to stay away from her sister because she was a slut... I took it as inside information.
885246022900908032 2017-07-12 21:14:33 UTC <GuyCynical> Guy get in friend zones because the girl knows you won't try to give her the dick.let her know you'll fuck at given time
885243980899917826 2017-07-12 21:06:26 UTC <GuyCynical> When the hot cheerleader from high school that gave you a BJ sends a FB friend request and she looks like an old man 
885241449536778240 2017-07-12 20:56:23 UTC <GuyCynical> I can't get over 200 followers & people have thousands....but I am an asshole, so maybe that has something to do with it
885240833926156288 2017-07-12 20:53:56 UTC <GuyCynical> Hot chicks on twitter complain about pervert guys, maybe use a fat girl avi or something innocuous so they don't bug you
885237010079895552 2017-07-12 20:38:44 UTC <GuyCynical> @herprettybones @_sunshine25_ As some things go, yes we are all the same. There are a lot of women the same.
885208687979180032 2017-07-12 18:46:12 UTC <GuyCynical> I'll retweet who and whatever the fuck I want - it doesn't really matter in the end.
885198054252589066 2017-07-12 18:03:56 UTC <GuyCynical> She thinks it's love and he thinks it's good pussy.
885145249517056003 2017-07-12 14:34:07 UTC <GuyCynical> If you can't complain on Twitter where nobody cares, where can you complain?
885144173149650944 2017-07-12 14:29:50 UTC <GuyCynical> Complain when they're an asshole again and get mad at the person telling you the truth. #MakesSense #AnotherDouchebag
885142183841583104 2017-07-12 14:21:56 UTC <GuyCynical> It's funny that women like fixer uppers or bad boys and complain whenever they're douche bags.Take the nice guy. #Truth
884926831937433605 2017-07-11 00:06:12 UTC <GuyCynical> Those are just fine 
884886916860137472 2017-07-11 21:27:36 UTC <GuyCynical> Struggling with my sarcasm right now, trying to be nice and it's proving most difficult.
884885678982651905 2017-07-11 21:22:40 UTC <GuyCynical> Life was easier when I was seven and thought girls were gross
884884685511434241 2017-07-11 21:18:44 UTC <GuyCynical> When you have a problem and no one to talk to because you only have one friend and your problem is with that friend.
884881531248009216 2017-07-11 21:06:12 UTC <GuyCynical> I hate seeing pain in the eyes of somebody I care about . It was easier not having somebody like that in my life.
884880409384845312 2017-07-11 21:01:44 UTC <GuyCynical> Well they do sell insurance, not the most exciting profession out there
884813416686342144 2017-07-11 16:35:32 UTC <GuyCynical> Makes me want to change professions
884530293155274753 2017-07-10 21:50:30 UTC <GuyCynical> Have a Ceramic coating applied, you want regret it. All the muscle & exotics in my area are having it done. Works great
884509572345602049 2017-07-10 20:28:10 UTC <GuyCynical> @AFrankenberry I actually live on the outskirts of Pittsburgh & don't get downtown as much as I used to. Just baseball & hockey games
884501678468329473 2017-07-10 19:56:48 UTC <GuyCynical> @AFrankenberry As a fellow Pittsburgher, unfortunately I've only had two of these items. I need to try harder
884365844683390979 2017-07-10 10:57:02 UTC <GuyCynical> Women that always claim to "squirt" , aren't you sick of washing your bed sheets all the time?
884222459217686529 2017-07-09 01:27:16 UTC <GuyCynical> @herprettybones It happens when to me when you post pics of that beautiful face
884136192031305728 2017-07-09 19:44:29 UTC <GuyCynical> I actually like whores, sluts and easy women.  I do like my drinks without penis in it.pic.twitter.com/cdtoB7dn2F
884118881421451265 2017-07-09 18:35:42 UTC <GuyCynical> Toronto traffic sucks worse than an itchy butt hole. Thanks 
883292815794589696 2017-07-07 11:53:12 UTC <GuyCynical> All these bitches want a man with a beard until we're tongue deep and it's scratching up your shaved pussy.
883112912419774464 2017-07-06 23:58:20 UTC <GuyCynical> @PAWGVlog Those are boobs.... we call them fun bags
883099285046390784 2017-07-06 23:04:11 UTC <GuyCynical> @shopkins776 @StarchilyMaster Shirt , socks and then pants. Unless I'm wearing shorts, then shirt, shorts & socks.
883012634441900032 2017-07-06 17:19:52 UTC <GuyCynical> I can't wait to spread you open & lick that creamy center & get you all wet. *talking to my Oreo before I dip it in milk
882974467244253184 2017-07-06 14:48:12 UTC <GuyCynical> Macaroni and cheese lunch meat is actually a thing in Canada. You Canadians are sick fucks. #Canada150

881618237368262656 2017-07-02 20:59:02 UTC <GuyCynical> I liked your cheeseburger picture better
881617901941387265 2017-07-02 20:57:42 UTC <GuyCynical> @NotYourFnWifey Wow you are stunningly gorgeous 
881462977781800962 2017-07-02 10:42:05 UTC <GuyCynical> @NotYourFnWifey When you have a killer body like yours , you should flaunt it while you can.

880073780835614720 2017-06-28 14:41:54 UTC <GuyCynical> I try to make money off everybody I meet, you can have the pussy licking discount though
880045792123375616 2017-06-28 12:50:41 UTC <GuyCynical> When you're in the mood to listen to slayer or Gwar and you're in your work car without it- #fuckedOff #stillsuckstho
879892580892381184 2017-06-27 02:41:53 UTC <GuyCynical> They're very close and it just happens sometimes
879884134277148672 2017-06-27 02:08:19 UTC <GuyCynical> Those stems 
879796805172695043 2017-06-27 20:21:18 UTC <GuyCynical> Why are so many hot chicks on here from Canada? I go to Canada on a regular basis and I never see hot chicks.
879761682947506177 2017-06-27 18:01:45 UTC <GuyCynical> I thought it was gross when I was young, but if you're hot enough, I'll eat your ass.
879759506468679681 2017-06-27 17:53:06 UTC <GuyCynical> I could just hang out underneath your desk and tongue fuck you anytime you're getting stressed out
878672735303606272 2017-06-24 17:54:39 UTC <GuyCynical> I normally don't like people touching what I'm going to eat, but it's ok in this instance.
878452434439479297 2017-06-23 03:19:15 UTC <GuyCynical> Do people who put stuff for sale on the internet not know that I also use the internet to research the price on it? Duh
878381689835200512 2017-06-23 22:38:09 UTC <GuyCynical> I'd like to say the word solarium multiple times because it's a funny word.

877969964979892224 2017-06-22 19:22:06 UTC <GuyCynical> Told a very attractive blonde that today was #NoPantyDay and she said not for her and showed me hers. I call that a win.
877965596771483648 2017-06-22 19:04:44 UTC <GuyCynical> An elderly woman made it a point to tell me that I have a very beautiful smile, people should pay complements to others.
877719312395456512 2017-06-21 02:46:05 UTC <GuyCynical> Is it better if I ask if you'd like Cock photography instead of a dick pic? It just sounds classier.
877713073024360449 2017-06-21 02:21:18 UTC <GuyCynical> @MissSidney1985 Very beautiful
877712889703931905 2017-06-21 02:20:34 UTC <GuyCynical> I bet it taste slightly sweet with a hint of saltiness.
877672696309575680 2017-06-21 23:40:51 UTC <GuyCynical> @scarlettlips_ Western PA- I can assist
877660442587312129 2017-06-21 22:52:10 UTC <GuyCynical> They're probably embarrassed by their boner and can't stand up, like me after seeing this awesome pic.
877630055978893313 2017-06-21 20:51:25 UTC <GuyCynical> Do you remember when the Stanley cup was won back to back by the Pittsburgh Penguins? I do. #LetsGoPens #Pittsburgh
877628535791341568 2017-06-21 20:45:23 UTC <GuyCynical> I used to look at crowds and wonder who the serial killer or rapist was and now I just wonder who's the creep on Twitter
877626286423687168 2017-06-21 20:36:26 UTC <GuyCynical> That looks great.
877251266015113217 2017-06-20 19:46:15 UTC <GuyCynical> I hope you have a long lunch break because half hour is not going to be long enough

876410195798364160 2017-06-18 12:04:08 UTC <GuyCynical> @LeahRBoss Beach = bikini & bikini = picture & picture of you in a bikini = 
875426952190054400 2017-06-15 18:57:04 UTC <GuyCynical> Nothing is shrinking around you.

875381283068760065 2017-06-15 15:55:36 UTC <GuyCynical> After the last pic you posted, I have 8 creamers in my pants
875164416601411584 2017-06-14 01:33:51 UTC <GuyCynical> @LeahRBoss @MrKHafid1 @ClickLogical I'm not sure, I forgot everything I ever knew for a few seconds when I viewed that pic
875098244359041025 2017-06-14 21:10:54 UTC <GuyCynical> @LeahRBoss @MrKHafid1 Her looks made me follow, her brains made me stay and yes early on there were bikini pics 
875089116655955969 2017-06-14 20:34:38 UTC <GuyCynical> * when she is so gorgeous are you think is: "I don't care if it is 90 out today, I would still lick that pussy."
875088134777843712 2017-06-14 20:30:44 UTC <GuyCynical> I'm just waiting around for new bikini pics of @LeahRBoss
875054130108264448 2017-06-14 18:15:36 UTC <GuyCynical> @NotYourFnWifey I'd only want to do you right, so you come back for more.
874694709301653504 2017-06-13 18:27:24 UTC <GuyCynical> Might need to take 3 just to be sure or take 4 or 5

872545685178118145 2017-06-07 20:07:57 UTC <GuyCynical> This world would be a lot better place if women went around looking for cunnilingus as much as men look for fellatio
872252599390658560 2017-06-06 00:43:20 UTC <GuyCynical> The only taco Tuesday I want is between your legs
872248457674752000 2017-06-06 00:26:52 UTC <GuyCynical> I'm on a diet, so instead of you making me a sandwich, can we just fuck again?
872245037765201920 2017-06-06 00:13:17 UTC <GuyCynical> @EnvDefenseFund No we don't
872210458815627264 2017-06-06 21:55:52 UTC <GuyCynical> I hear saliva is good for that... if you need assistance, I'd be willing to oblige.

871070782985822208 2017-06-03 18:27:13 UTC <GuyCynical> @DRUDGE_REPORT Looks like Trump is saving the taxpayers already.
871070601640906752 2017-06-03 18:26:29 UTC <GuyCynical> Why is there no such thing as unsolicited pussy & boobie pics sent to my DM. Fight back and send to show us how it feels
871056198753300480 2017-06-03 17:29:15 UTC <GuyCynical> @KMADrunner We have something in common... I like your boobies too.
870632742836482048 2017-06-02 13:26:36 UTC <GuyCynical> Always do 10+ mph over regardless of the posted limit. -except school zone-

866111862995341312 2017-05-20 02:02:14 UTC <GuyCynical> @SassyCDNMist If it's cold, I guess you'll just need warmed up
866111440138186752 2017-05-20 02:00:33 UTC <GuyCynical> @SassyCDNMist What's the proper definition of interaction with you to DM? Previous DM or ?
866110971777081344 2017-05-20 01:58:41 UTC <GuyCynical> @SassyCDNMist Big, medium or small, the same principle applies. Less clothes & more skin is always better
866064998644297733 2017-05-20 22:56:01 UTC <GuyCynical> And some people suck the nice into youpic.twitter.com/XnQ7TRD1aq

866064752593817600 2017-05-20 22:55:02 UTC <GuyCynical> @SassyCDNMist I believe my thoughts on this lean towards not enough skin... the answer is always not enough.
866009366570426370 2017-05-20 19:14:57 UTC <GuyCynical> My yard and landscaping may look like shit, but my manscaping is on point. #ShaveYourBallsForHer
866008628586741760 2017-05-20 19:12:01 UTC <GuyCynical> You keep her vehicle waxed and she keeps her vagina waxed, sounds like a fair deal.
865960381201739776 2017-05-20 16:00:18 UTC <GuyCynical> Someone told me they live everyday "balls to the walls" I'd rather live "balls to your ass" or "balls to your chin"
865941718813880320 2017-05-20 14:46:08 UTC <GuyCynical> Instead of having 007 license to kill, I'd like to have a license to discipline other people's horrible children
865650671910912005 2017-05-19 19:29:37 UTC <GuyCynical> People without teeth creep me out, you're like a life-size Muppet
865650210277425152 2017-05-19 19:27:47 UTC <GuyCynical> My Snapchat currently has three ugly girls in it and I refuse to open them.
865025074767724546 2017-05-17 02:03:43 UTC <GuyCynical> When you see her & you're having a normal conversation & your cock starts throbbing and growing because she's so sexy..
865024163467190272 2017-05-17 02:00:06 UTC <GuyCynical> The slight sound of your panties dropping to the floor sounds like heavens harps strumming a graceful tune.
864828939096776704 2017-05-17 13:04:21 UTC <GuyCynical> Guys demand dinner on the table when come through the door, I'd rather have panties on the floor. We can cook dinner.
864090988972843009 2017-05-15 12:12:00 UTC <GuyCynical> @NotYourFnWifey I figured you for a batman type of chick.
864090564089794560 2017-05-15 12:10:19 UTC <GuyCynical> @NotYourFnWifey Thigh high socks over or under the leggings? That make a difference plus the color combinations.
862735254632706048 2017-05-11 18:24:48 UTC <GuyCynical> @wikileaks I'm ok with that, maybe add in some pig blood
862698694239547397 2017-05-11 15:59:31 UTC <GuyCynical> I don't like turkey lunch meat because it smells like farts    *but I will gladly eat your pussy and ass.
862647150362210305 2017-05-11 12:34:42 UTC <GuyCynical> Give her food, tell her she's beautiful and eat her pussy.
862644334453288960 2017-05-11 12:23:31 UTC <GuyCynical> When there nobody to talk to about problems because you're always the one that gives the answer to everyone.

837819367995895808 2017-03-03 00:17:57 UTC <GuyCynical> @sweetpoutine you should send all your dirty stuff to me, delete & I'll keep it safely hidden away for you until want it
837757094057037824 2017-03-03 20:10:30 UTC <GuyCynical> I'm like the whore whisperer, for some reason whores are attracted to me & I can pick them out from across the room.
837666962033496064 2017-03-03 14:12:21 UTC <GuyCynical> It said that March weather is in like a lion out like a lamb, is it the same for women's attitudes? #HopeSo
837665275856191493 2017-03-03 14:05:39 UTC <GuyCynical> Women are the reason for extreme happiness and also extreme irritation all at the same fucking time, they're amazing.

837663964813131776 2017-03-03 14:00:26 UTC <GuyCynical> Today is one of those days where it be nice to step off the grid and be left the fuck alone for the entire weekend
837627552554496000 2017-03-03 11:35:45 UTC <GuyCynical> @NotYourFnWifey clearly this is a shout out for us to have sex so you'll never be disappointed with anything else again
837626566381342720 2017-03-03 11:31:50 UTC <GuyCynical> Sometimes when people love each other they go through the motions and forget the emotions and that's what breaks it down
837387366553747456 2017-03-02 19:41:20 UTC <GuyCynical> @DUSTINAM @shewitsch just saying that if it was 62.8 in 1963 during the summer & its 63 now.  That's not proof

810132723872436224 2016-12-17 14:41:07 UTC <GuyCynical> So you can afford to have your nose pierced but you can't afford to have your teeth cleaned.  #gross

808460817473695744 2016-12-12 23:57:34 UTC <GuyCynical> @musicntats usually when hot chicks show off a set of puppies on the internet it looks  little different
