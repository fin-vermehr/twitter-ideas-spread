852439046982950912 2017-04-13 08:31:21 UTC <FawltyTowerz> @SkyNews I'm well aware that they heavily use propaganda to support muslims, but I just think in this case, its very relevant to include in the title
852438546782855174 2017-04-13 08:29:21 UTC <FawltyTowerz> @SkyNews Eg if first ever christian woman judge in a Hindu majority country was susp killed, I'd imagine they'd include that in the headline too.No?

771296964138897409 2016-09-01 10:41:40 UTC <FawltyTowerz> @StirringTrouble It's a symptom of the rigidity and politics of the medical system.

764868665250553856 2016-08-14 16:57:55 UTC <FawltyTowerz> Moreno repeatedly slapping Klopps arse at the end of the game was very cringeworthy to watch, considering how shite he's been today!

746645014898421760 2016-06-25 10:03:38 UTC <FawltyTowerz> @WeDoNotLearn73 The PC propaganda is strong with this one. I'm not a genius by any means so why am I a needle in a haystack? Utterly bizarre
746644730373636096 2016-06-25 10:02:30 UTC <FawltyTowerz> @WeDoNotLearn73 I still don't get it, a good majority of my friends are intelligent, highly inquisitive and our usually very open minded....
746639166797193216 2016-06-25 09:40:23 UTC <FawltyTowerz> @WeDoNotLearn73 I wouldn't be surprised if their is a full blown civil war between baby boomers and the youth. On Facebook of course!
746637875308015616 2016-06-25 09:35:15 UTC <FawltyTowerz> @WeDoNotLearn73 What a time to be alive. I'll eagerly be following your posts. The level of bigotry and sourness is astonishing.
746636432584871937 2016-06-25 09:29:32 UTC <FawltyTowerz> @WeDoNotLearn73 How is it that 99% of my mates voted in? How could people be so blinkered to the real agenda of the EU? I find it baffling!!
746389397621346309 2016-06-24 17:07:54 UTC <FawltyTowerz> @SFC_Tickets You need to protest this bullshit. Where's the ambition? You have the architecture to get to the top but you just don't invest

736725580138287104 2016-05-28 01:07:20 UTC <FawltyTowerz> @BestProAdvice A kind act, but pardon my cynicism but I judge a man by how much he gives (within reason) compared to total wealth
711649090975752192 2016-03-20 20:22:19 UTC <FawltyTowerz> @HKane one eye on the international games and one eye on preparing to win the league more like it!

694172838161469441 2016-02-01 14:57:56 UTC <FawltyTowerz> @myoddballs gym socks would be the best form of sockware to promote the cause, as most likely to be visible during visit.
690546225586814977 2016-01-22 14:47:04 UTC <FawltyTowerz> @Ben_Davies33 @adidasUK Go on Ben!!! You have a great attitude and future with us. Keep doing your thing mate!
