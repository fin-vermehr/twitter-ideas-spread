He is under the impression no one has the right to criticize FAKE MEDIA.
949794477350244356 2018-01-06 00:07:04 UTC <Iceman90225> @GOP Any person who would put down good money and support the financial gains of Michael Wolff need to contemplate his or her priority.

949657945486364672 2018-01-06 15:04:32 UTC <Iceman90225> @USATODAY What in the world does Roy Moore have to do with this story. You should have a picture of Johnson or the burnt house.

946562867158974464 2017-12-28 02:05:48 UTC <Iceman90225> @BillKristol @weeklystandard Only 20K difference in the Obama 16 budget compared to Trump 17. Given the fact Trump is donating his salary I would say Trump is ahead.

943836462268796928 2017-12-21 13:32:02 UTC <Iceman90225> @DNC @HallettMatt Its how they put money in the coffers. High tax states subsidized by federal gov then the money is put into programs that funnel it to DNC.
943833520019066881 2017-12-21 13:20:21 UTC <Iceman90225> I am tired of supporting your high state tax rates just for you to waste.

943831790967549952 2017-12-21 13:13:29 UTC <Iceman90225> This story is filled with false statements and conclusions. You are going to somehow separate business based on the person is in politics
943831046050676736 2017-12-21 13:10:31 UTC <Iceman90225> Trump stands to save millions under new tax measure, experts sayhttp://a.msn.com/01/en-us/BBH5Kcf?ocid=st
