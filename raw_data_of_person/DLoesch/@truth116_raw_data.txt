790570652486897667 2016-10-24 15:08:26 UTC <truth116> @theblaze The craziness of this people is that Hillary could even get this close to winning the great state of Texas.  #trumpthewrongguy
790569904579629056 2016-10-24 15:05:27 UTC <truth116> @theblaze @debclay5153 its called a margin of error
790569283097010176 2016-10-24 15:02:59 UTC <truth116> @theblaze By telling the truth? Get out there and vote
790380414728675328 2016-10-23 02:32:30 UTC <truth116> @NateSilver538 hey wow, trump is doing better than initial polls.
790229915845005312 2016-10-23 16:34:28 UTC <truth116> @ericmetaxas "I'm going to overturn Roe v Wade, oh wait I can't do that, what about the 3 exceptions.I'll just promise it like the Justices
790226987709140992 2016-10-23 16:22:50 UTC <truth116> @ericmetaxas Isn't saying "3 exceptions" the same as saying "I'm pro choice".  Oh, but that Supreme Court. Do u trust Hillary-backing Trump?
790225815636025344 2016-10-23 16:18:10 UTC <truth116> @ericmetaxas That's interesting!  Hillary gave exact excuse for abortion that Trump would give!  For the life of the mother!  3 exceptions!
789864743817195520 2016-10-22 16:23:24 UTC <truth116> Am I the only one who feels afraid when I hear Trump say he will REPLACE the government with a better one. @glennbeck @ericmetaxas
789131984056360961 2016-10-20 15:51:41 UTC <truth116> @glennbeck If Hillary budgets like her husband, will she borrow from Social Security too.  If that runs out, what will she borrow from then?
788788844170665985 2016-10-19 17:08:10 UTC <truth116> If Billy Bush is fired why isn't Trump in more trouble than he is?  It's bad enough for Bush to be fired, but well "we can't have Hillary".
788033736717639680 2016-10-17 15:07:38 UTC <truth116> @ditzkoff @realDonaldTrump I am conservative, and this is the kind of thing that makes me nervous about voting for him.
787422628994613249 2016-10-15 22:39:19 UTC <truth116> Hey @ericmetaxas are you ok with funding the "good parts" of Planned Parenthood?  Your buddy Trump is.   https://youtu.be/jGSttcyn2RI
787420953336684545 2016-10-15 22:32:39 UTC <truth116> Hey @ericmetaxas, do you think kill the baby so the mom can live, which never happens today, is justifiable.  Your buddy Trump does.
787420144184156161 2016-10-15 22:29:26 UTC <truth116> Hey @ericmetaxas, do you think killing babies because of incest is justifiable.   Your buddy Trump does.
787419792504344576 2016-10-15 22:28:02 UTC <truth116> Hey @ericmetaxas do you think killing babies because of rape is justifiable?   Your buddy Trump does!
787133176351043584 2016-10-14 03:29:08 UTC <truth116> @MSNBC @POTUS @kylegriffin1 probably the only time I've agreed with Obama
787108102675968000 2016-10-14 01:49:30 UTC <truth116> @ROCKandREVIEW guess I need to look a little more into that.  I don't like that they pass such a huge bill.  And without looking at it
787105270912524288 2016-10-14 01:38:14 UTC <truth116> @YouTube @glennbeck @ROCKandREVIEW what's your stance on that?
787104852455272449 2016-10-14 01:36:35 UTC <truth116> @glennbeck @ROCKandREVIEW just figured that out when I went to your video
787103194392334337 2016-10-14 01:29:59 UTC <truth116> @glennbeck @ROCKandREVIEW I see Fox 17.  Is that you?  Figured you know Glenn from FOX
787101403147743232 2016-10-14 01:22:52 UTC <truth116> @glennbeck @ROCKandREVIEW FOX

787100444745093120 2016-10-14 01:19:04 UTC <truth116> @glennbeck @ROCKandREVIEW is that just a name
787100317062004737 2016-10-14 01:18:33 UTC <truth116> @glennbeck @ROCKandREVIEW why doesn't your website come up?
787099149967646722 2016-10-14 01:13:55 UTC <truth116> @glennbeck @ROCKandREVIEW do you know where Utah is?  Maybe you're color blind?
787097844377227264 2016-10-14 01:08:44 UTC <truth116> @glennbeck @ROCKandREVIEW actually that map shows him on the ballot.  You don't seem like a friend to Glenn
787096562866401281 2016-10-14 01:03:38 UTC <truth116> @glennbeck @ROCKandREVIEW that is true.  I guess I just took it as what Evan said for sure he Will be on
787096087773319168 2016-10-14 01:01:45 UTC <truth116> @glennbeck @ROCKandREVIEW Evan said he should be in 45 states.  It hasn't happened yet.  I see he is on 11 states and many more for write in
787093672143663104 2016-10-14 00:52:09 UTC <truth116> @theblaze @glennbeck @ROCKandREVIEW and you are right.  I have never heard of you guys.
787093202226393088 2016-10-14 00:50:17 UTC <truth116> @glennbeck @ROCKandREVIEW forgive me, just standing up for the guy, and not yet voting for Evan.   I know he's voting for Castle, so am a I
787081073876348929 2016-10-14 00:02:05 UTC <truth116> @glennbeck @ROCKandREVIEW You couldn't do half the job that Glenn does. Let him dream, as he is the only candidate worth hoping for.
786928737476497408 2016-10-14 13:56:46 UTC <truth116> @WSJ @ericmetaxas Your 2nd party can't win in NY.  What will you do to "assuage your conscience "?  You must vote 4 Hillary!  #guiltless
786771431744942080 2016-10-13 03:31:41 UTC <truth116> @SykesCharlie @nucAmbiguous Two errors not demons. Must we demonize everything our enemy, Satan, does?
786269496440872960 2016-10-12 18:17:10 UTC <truth116> If you want to keep it @ericmetaxas go to http://conventionofstates.com
786265463793655808 2016-10-12 18:01:09 UTC <truth116> Trump won't win in NY, u should vote for Hillary, otherwise you throw away your vote. @ericmetaxas I guess u have no power 2 stop her there
776435160526925824 2016-09-15 14:59:02 UTC <truth116> According to 7 eleven coffee drinkers, a third party would win by 11%!  If only there were only ONE to vote for.  @glennbeck
771765424417492992 2016-09-02 17:43:10 UTC <truth116> If Mr. Trump SAYS he is pro-life, does that make it so!  He could say he is a beautiful woman and we would believe. #NeverTrumpOrHillary
771763744548368384 2016-09-02 17:36:30 UTC <truth116> If in Texas I only have two choices, does Cali and NY only have one choice then?  Go Hillary!! #NeverTrumpOrHillary
757598872872947712 2016-07-25 15:30:21 UTC <truth116> @glennbeck Great speech Mr. Carson!  Too bad you didn't endorse the man who could lead us in that!

756517594190979072 2016-07-22 15:53:44 UTC <truth116> @glennbeck Why do we say the bible is outdated and useless for today, but still believe in mainstream media?
756517304536555520 2016-07-22 15:52:35 UTC <truth116> @glennbeck One main reason why we believe there are only two candidates to vote for is because old school media says we do.
756483301813002240 2016-07-22 13:37:28 UTC <truth116> @MomsDemand How is it decided who is too dangerous to fly.  Ted Kennedy was on the no fly list and other people in media.  Bad idea
