958065970697863168 2018-01-29 19:55:02 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @VolumeRose Yes cause I made it obvious that I don't
958065492333297669 2018-01-29 19:53:08 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @VolumeRose Still don't think I'm a troll though
958063558553677824 2018-01-29 19:45:26 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @VolumeRose No not really just getting tired of this convo playing a game gist irritation really not anger
958062703096074242 2018-01-29 19:42:03 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @VolumeRose It's like hate at first sight
958060037204791296 2018-01-29 19:31:27 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @VolumeRose Impact in the sense of she understands that she isn't liked by me
958057348953706496 2018-01-29 19:20:46 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @VolumeRose Care in the sense of my apparent impact towards that person
958055177218592768 2018-01-29 19:12:08 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @VolumeRose This person isn't my friend or employer they do not matter to me so I don't care
958046090728738816 2018-01-29 18:36:02 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @VolumeRose I care about my impact on the people I care about. Mom, dad, my two siblings and my gf and my best friends. As well as to people who are kind to other clearly this person wasn't so why should I be nice to her
958043573936640000 2018-01-29 18:26:02 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @VolumeRose Trolling not quite I suppose trolls are those who frequent such "underhanded" insults, but it is of no concern to me how an individual takes my comment if you take offense to it that's on you not me.
958038488519184384 2018-01-29 18:05:49 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @VolumeRose Just like that individual deems his to have some form of impact on that man it insulted I am obviously going for the same thing and it's also perspective isn't it as my own grandmother is dead and if I don't see the magnitude
958030512681029634 2018-01-29 17:34:08 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @VolumeRose That's not at all what I'm saying, I'm saying just like he/she or whatever went out its way yo insult someone I did the same
958019664533213184 2018-01-29 16:51:01 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @Smartassicus @VolumeRose In the same manner, it was necessary to insult another individual over his views
958017021379215361 2018-01-29 16:40:31 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @Smartassicus @VolumeRose Yes that comment was nasty but not unnecessary
958013979829460992 2018-01-29 16:28:26 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @Smartassicus @VolumeRose I'm actually Indian so that's my reasoning, my first language is Punjabi. I know some Brit's as you put it but the thing is I'm on good terms with them and our banter is friendly and blunt so I guess I don't know about how you Brit's throw shade.
958007304225542144 2018-01-29 16:01:54 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @Smartassicus @VolumeRose Sorry for not being raised in a ghetto household that uses such shitty play on words my fault that my sense of understanding of insults is that they are blunt and not cutting around the bush. Just call me stupid its simple
958006013138944000 2018-01-29 15:56:47 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @Smartassicus @VolumeRose "I think their mamma's didn't learn them so good" either you are stupid or just plain retarded but that's not even a proper fucking sentence   Also, how does our mother's teachings have to do with this at all.
958005589585682433 2018-01-29 15:55:06 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @VolumeRose @Smartassicus No big deal in the sense I intended not to be a similar remark to what you said just using far more of a sensitive topic  Nothing to freak over about
958001495697444864 2018-01-29 15:38:50 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @VolumeRose @Smartassicus What part don't you believe
957994559086063616 2018-01-29 15:11:16 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @stillgray @diveandliewreck @Smartassicus @VolumeRose What am I suppose to say exactly and bullocks not quite as clearly her grandmother is dead just used that as q quick comment. Much like this one. don't think it makes me look big in the least add to the fact as my own grandmother is dead too so it's not that big of a deal.
957990197966209024 2018-01-29 14:53:56 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @tariqnasheed @KingAcer33 I can promise you she doesn't regret that chose because she isn't illegel
957986621835497472 2018-01-29 14:39:43 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @stillgray @diveandliewreck @Smartassicus Neither does your grandmother
909450979690545152 2017-09-17 16:16:24 UTC <Vixen_Kami> @realDonaldTrump @Fuctupmind Lol bunch of liberal cucks who have nothing better to do but scream at their president. Go to Mexico If you hate the USA so much.
