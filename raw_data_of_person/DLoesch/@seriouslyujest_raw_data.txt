956224023477800960 2018-01-24 17:55:47 UTC <seriouslyujest> He (trump) should be brought up on numerous "hate crime" charges. Every word out of his mouth incites hate, and there are too many that he incites that are capable of rational thought.  Trump is complicit in these hate crimes.https://twitter.com/NathanHRubin/status/955794135071510529
956005299957190658 2018-01-23 03:26:39 UTC <seriouslyujest> I think trump should be charged with hate crimes.  He incites hate with every word that comes out of his mouth. Our country has divided and I can't figure out how we will mend that divide. Verbal and physical violence has become the norm and I put that on trump.
