970523664029396992 2018-03-04 04:57:27 UTC <tomhagcons> @ThomBlack777 You should follow @DaveKeto and learn about misleading cholesterol numbers and how it's a flawed metric. I'm sure this new school of thought will make it to Japan in about...30 years give or take a few.

965098598898659328 2018-02-17 05:40:11 UTC <tomhagcons> @VinnieTortorich I thought so too. I love coconut oil in coffee and have had amazing success on nsng / keto. But cholesterol levels are somewhat "high". How can something that has no cholesterol raise your cholesterol? That sounds like bullshit - right? I have faith in you - many thanks!pic.twitter.com/Wj1mGOkvbV
964956799223848961 2018-02-17 20:16:43 UTC <tomhagcons> @VinnieTortorich i read on DietDr that adding fat to coffee such as coconut oil may raise cholesterol for some people. Would this also apply to a high fat cream like whipping cream?
