970808797269807104 2018-03-05 23:50:28 UTC <kilman_renee> @DineshDSouza I did watch the Billy Graham documentary earlier in the evening. I haven't watched the Oscars for year. They are boring scripted poorly acted.

967443863274250246 2018-02-24 16:59:25 UTC <kilman_renee> @GovGaryJohnson @FoxNews Yes, it would be a huge deterrent! Otherwise teachers and staff, like students, are sitting ducks just waiting to be picked off.

966813695283224577 2018-02-22 23:15:22 UTC <kilman_renee> very good point.https://twitter.com/RealJamesWoods/status/966771260490366976
965677126342135808 2018-02-19 19:59:02 UTC <kilman_renee> yup. They are rotten from the inside out and nature is taking its coursehttps://twitter.com/seanmdav/status/965427834775797762
965676517169778688 2018-02-19 19:56:37 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery my takeaway is that they just put a bunch of fake news on the web and tried to influence how the American people vote. It seems pretty vague and watered down I guess this is how they fix their mess and avoid the Clinton crimes
965675264050126850 2018-02-19 19:51:38 UTC <kilman_renee> @DineshDSouza Athletes who are supposed to be representing our country and bash our President while doing so, on foreign soil, do not have my support. They are guaranteed as Americans, free speech. I don't mind their views but I think they way they go about it is wrong.
965674752244318208 2018-02-19 19:49:36 UTC <kilman_renee> @DineshDSouza I think using free speech to spew filth, to lie, and to incite violence for no good reason except discord is wrong and is an affront to freedom. I don't watch NFL anymore. And I have avoided watching certain people who have bashed our President, while in a foreign country,
965674134058557440 2018-02-19 19:47:09 UTC <kilman_renee> @DineshDSouza I don't mind someone having a differing opinion than I do. I like the exchange of ideas when it's civil. I don't want to see us become "bots". But what I don't respect is when I turn on a football game and see players kneeling on the job is an inappropriate time
965673381877166080 2018-02-19 19:44:10 UTC <kilman_renee> @DineshDSouza In our culture it seems like everything is being politicized. There's a lot going on in the world right now and most of it centers on politics which has sadly become very corrupt and puts our liberties in danger. This includes free speech.
965672347951943681 2018-02-19 19:40:03 UTC <kilman_renee> @VP This is the way my husband and I start our days as well. You are right this is the typical American and we appreciate that you have stood up for your faith and for ours. Thank you and God bless you.

963489004653105153 2018-02-13 19:04:14 UTC <kilman_renee> @HouseDemocrats Right. Dem spending did nothing for the middle class except cut them down. I don't think you are worried about the debt so sit down and be quiet unless you have something real to say.

963485191854534656 2018-02-13 18:49:05 UTC <kilman_renee> @ArthurSchwartz This is the kind of stuff that goes on in socialist/communist countries when there is a challenge to the status quo in power. dems/libs: this is the status quo in power and this is what they do when challenged. because there is no real intelligent recourse to such high standards.

962809490121936896 2018-02-11 22:04:05 UTC <kilman_renee> @ABC the really cool thing is that they got to get out of North Korea if only for a little while and see a world they may never see again. So sad that they don't have the option.

962804510308601856 2018-02-11 21:44:17 UTC <kilman_renee> @DiamondandSilk This whole issue is ridiculous. If the dems had wanted to make Daca permanent they could have already had it done.

960668281542709249 2018-02-05 00:15:41 UTC <kilman_renee> @JackPosobiec this is why I don't watch CNN
960664629004390400 2018-02-05 00:01:10 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery oh goodie.
960333702789201920 2018-02-04 02:06:11 UTC <kilman_renee> @NFL @DrJaneRuby glad I'm still not watching
960333306184290305 2018-02-04 02:04:36 UTC <kilman_renee> @JackPosobiec sounds like he might know something about the Vegas mass shooting as well
960329243522715648 2018-02-04 01:48:28 UTC <kilman_renee> @DNC @FoxNews maybe the dnc could get hilary to pay back campaign funds since she lost the election she rigged.
960328791586476033 2018-02-04 01:46:40 UTC <kilman_renee> @RealSaavedra shifty schiff
960328571519676416 2018-02-04 01:45:48 UTC <kilman_renee> @DRUDGE_REPORT wall.

960306254232080385 2018-02-04 00:17:07 UTC <kilman_renee> @dbongino yup
960305768972079106 2018-02-04 00:15:11 UTC <kilman_renee> @SaraCarterDC the people understand @EricHolder , we understand very well what the FBI, the DOJ, Obama, and the Clintons have done.
960304951779123201 2018-02-04 00:11:56 UTC <kilman_renee> @RepJoeKennedy @HouseDemocrats promises kept by President Trump. Promises kept in record time even with all the the garbage have been slinging. Get to work dems, do your job serving the American people or get out!
960303885339504640 2018-02-04 00:07:42 UTC <kilman_renee> @BreitbartNews oh, uh, ok.
960172107517845504 2018-02-04 15:24:04 UTC <kilman_renee> @PrisonPlanet @Mediaite are the dems just acting stupidly or are they really trying to destroy our country?
960171767020118016 2018-02-04 15:22:43 UTC <kilman_renee> @phil4gop @GartrellLinda @hotfunkytown @DonnaWR8 @GrizzleMeister @Chicago1Ray @inittowinit007 @NIVIsa4031 @KatTheHammer1 @Hoosiers1986 @realDonaldTrump yeah it definitely makes sense. I thought he was just not ready for the job and didn't know what he was doing or he really was trying to destroy our country. He @BarackObama  go to Kenya, maybe you can take over the world from there!
960169009898577920 2018-02-04 15:11:45 UTC <kilman_renee> @foxandfriends the press spins so much they are dizzy to the point of utter stupidity
960168562483703808 2018-02-04 15:09:59 UTC <kilman_renee> @JudicialWatch How would it be that the budget would be top secret?
960168365632491520 2018-02-04 15:09:12 UTC <kilman_renee> @SaraCarterDC wow! There you have it my fellow Americans!
960167975864225794 2018-02-04 15:07:39 UTC <kilman_renee> @SenSchumer Oh yeah, and my employer just started offering another very good health insurance option so that now I can afford to have my spouse insured.  Yay!
960167721664237570 2018-02-04 15:06:38 UTC <kilman_renee> @SenSchumer how is it, Senator Schumer, that this idea of tax cuts to the most hurting American people, jobs and higher wages, lower healthcare costs, goes right over your head? I'm happy to get my 1.50 per week increase along with the raise my employer previously couldn't afford to give me.
960166763567702016 2018-02-04 15:02:50 UTC <kilman_renee> @JackPosobiec hahahahahaha!!!!!
960166604033155073 2018-02-04 15:02:12 UTC <kilman_renee> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @FoxNews there sits smug nancy
960163685116399617 2018-02-04 14:50:36 UTC <kilman_renee> @NancyPelosi Nancy & @PaulRyan It's not crumbs. Taxes coupled with a poor economy, increasing cost of living & healthcare, and stagnant wages is what has hurt the forgotten families of the United States. But you don't have to worry about such small things.
959945067619389440 2018-02-03 00:21:53 UTC <kilman_renee> @DrJaneRuby I do not trust the FBI
959942735653425153 2018-02-03 00:12:37 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery driving through a school zone, speed posted 25mph, I go 90. Officer pulls me over for driving recklessly through a school zone and I say, "That's it?" Uh... nope, you're going to jail.
959939330037944320 2018-02-03 23:59:05 UTC <kilman_renee> @RealJamesWoods yup and even republican politicians were sucked in, while the rest of us were wondering, is Obama just a complete idiot or is he purposely trying to destroy this country?
959938787823489024 2018-02-03 23:56:56 UTC <kilman_renee> @PrisonPlanet hmmm. making threats.
959937886924820481 2018-02-03 23:53:21 UTC <kilman_renee> @DineshDSouza If she would have won - in a few years we would all be like Chicago.
959937195070107649 2018-02-03 23:50:36 UTC <kilman_renee> @GOP President Trump doing a great job!
959935848346259456 2018-02-03 23:45:15 UTC <kilman_renee> @TomFitton why are we still signing these people's paychecks?
959935442622779392 2018-02-03 23:43:38 UTC <kilman_renee> @BreitbartNews still running with that stor... lie, John McCain? okay. You don't have any credibility anyway
959935014736625664 2018-02-03 23:41:56 UTC <kilman_renee> @cathymcmorris @HouseGOP I haven't seen my paycheck yet since the tax cuts took effect but already my employer is offering more healthcare options making it affordable for me to add family members!
959934193898868736 2018-02-03 23:38:41 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery Hey @NancyPelosi , reality check, he's still President and all the slander and insults, fake news, and dirty deals by the DNC & the Washington swamp isn't going to change that
959933215040557056 2018-02-03 23:34:47 UTC <kilman_renee> @RepJoeKennedy @HouseDemocrats name dropping now are we?? the bullies are the dems. holding DACA recipients hostage, rigging elections, selling United States Uranium, funding terrorist groups - pleeeeze! John and Robert Kennedy were the last of the great democrats.
959854042477416453 2018-02-03 18:20:11 UTC <kilman_renee> Wow, Bill Maher, that's what the nazis called the Jews! Where does that put you?https://twitter.com/chuckwoolery/status/959853545632747520
959851575421399040 2018-02-03 18:10:23 UTC <kilman_renee> @GOPPollAnalyst she is obviously lying
959848535738015744 2018-02-03 17:58:18 UTC <kilman_renee> @ggreenwald argument false.
959846557473476608 2018-02-03 17:50:27 UTC <kilman_renee> @derekahunter well, this explains why so many people living under socialism want out. they want to do what they don't want to do; live
959845216168620034 2018-02-03 17:45:07 UTC <kilman_renee> @NancyPelosi @Saccone4PA18 @FoxNews the average age of democratic leadership is 72 years old. the average age of republican leadership is 48.
959842383339847680 2018-02-03 17:33:51 UTC <kilman_renee> @PrisonPlanet @OnTheOffenssive Hilary's $$ donors.
959841075186806784 2018-02-03 17:28:39 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery baloney John McCain! You don't serve the American Interest!
959840763105361920 2018-02-03 17:27:25 UTC <kilman_renee> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews It is a disgrace and I am sick of my hard earned tax dollars going to fund this fiasco!
959777001824509952 2018-02-03 13:14:03 UTC <kilman_renee> @dbongino @PoliticalShort smug, very smug
959776659187687424 2018-02-03 13:12:41 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery oh goodie. will there be any way to verify their claims?
959776270014996485 2018-02-03 13:11:09 UTC <kilman_renee> @marcthiessen @FoxNews If dems wanted an immigration deal they could have had it when they had Obama. Immigrants are nothing more to dems than pawns in their political schemes.
959775136986619904 2018-02-03 13:06:39 UTC <kilman_renee> @BreitbartNews We will not watch at our house. And, we did  not shop for superbowl goodies.
959774749500039170 2018-02-03 13:05:06 UTC <kilman_renee> @BernieSanders you said the election was rigged. You were right. Why did you give Hilary a pass? What do you say to your donors?
959773710856216576 2018-02-03 13:00:59 UTC <kilman_renee> Follow the money Ms. @atensnut , there's a lot of selfishness and greed in the clinton class
959773427887476736 2018-02-03 12:59:51 UTC <kilman_renee> @SheriffClarke such a sad state of affairs.
959773026094141441 2018-02-03 12:58:15 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery Besides Hilary, she looks like one of the most uptight, displeased woman on earth
959772133483311105 2018-02-03 12:54:42 UTC <kilman_renee> @GOP Is she well? I mean mentally capable of handling her job? she always looks half asleep
959770350623043584 2018-02-03 12:47:37 UTC <kilman_renee> @RepSwalwell Hey, not a bot.
959769194328936449 2018-02-03 12:43:02 UTC <kilman_renee> @atensnut Jimmy Kimmel is a liberal media hack. He gets paid to say things other people write. shame on him.
958499900853047296 2018-01-30 00:39:19 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery Of course @NancyPelosi we are all too busy to care about what goes on in our country! just collect our taxes and we'll shut up
958498650426093568 2018-01-30 00:34:20 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery his presence is not needed
958498102347956224 2018-01-30 00:32:10 UTC <kilman_renee> @DonaldJTrumpJr truth
958497308655738880 2018-01-30 00:29:01 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery the dems are morally bankrupt!
958496877053399040 2018-01-30 00:27:18 UTC <kilman_renee> @FoxBusiness bahahahaha!!!!! @SenSchumer you are quit the comedian!
957294449473806338 2018-01-27 16:49:17 UTC <kilman_renee> @dbongino @dangainor @NicolleDWallace sources? Proof that your statements are true and not just regurgitated
957294012221808640 2018-01-27 16:47:32 UTC <kilman_renee> @dbongino @Buster_ESPN this shouldn't even have to be said over and over again as it has been. who are all these really smart people that they continue to do the same stupid things over and over again?
957293408145559552 2018-01-27 16:45:08 UTC <kilman_renee> @DRUDGE_REPORT I have not watched any awards ceremonies in many years. They are poorly scripted, poorly acted and now they are seriously misguided.
957291312717488128 2018-01-27 16:36:49 UTC <kilman_renee> @toddstarnes @NancyPelosi could probably afford to fill her house with illegal aliens. She could probably afford to buy every one of them citizenship. she should do it.
957290635899392006 2018-01-27 16:34:07 UTC <kilman_renee> she didn't fire him because Hilary doesn't care about women she cares about Hilary. PERIOD!https://twitter.com/KRMGtulsa/status/957273338157699073
957284932111527938 2018-01-27 16:11:27 UTC <kilman_renee> you can see where all of this is goinghttps://twitter.com/infowars/status/956972536029327360
957284711071731712 2018-01-27 16:10:35 UTC <kilman_renee> @OwenBenjamin @benshapiro @SamHarrisOrg @jordanbpeterson @BretWeinstein @EricRWeinstein where are the clowns, bring in the clowns, they're already here.
957282996654141440 2018-01-27 16:03:46 UTC <kilman_renee> @NancyPelosi with all due respect, to my family, $1000 is not crumbs. It might be what keeps my car running so I can continue to get to my job. It might be my medical copays, or Christmas gifts for my grandchildren.
957282078558695424 2018-01-27 16:00:07 UTC <kilman_renee> @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @foxandfriends @TomFitton release the memo. fire and arrest the traitors. give them their day in court!
957280807542050823 2018-01-27 15:55:04 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery maybe we need our own conservative social media account, that values free speech and the free exchange of ideas, that will not sensor because it doesn't agree with the liberal narrative.
957090351122173953 2018-01-26 03:18:16 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery I want to go to college
957088090375548930 2018-01-26 03:09:17 UTC <kilman_renee> @dbongino they are criminals or at least accessories
956702774032551937 2018-01-25 01:38:10 UTC <kilman_renee> @SarahHuckabee @GovMikeHuckabee @PressSec @RealKyleMorris I love @SaraHuckabee. She is quick witted, smart, and and altogether lovely.
956700654495584257 2018-01-25 01:29:45 UTC <kilman_renee> @BreitbartNews good to know
956697272242327552 2018-01-25 01:16:18 UTC <kilman_renee> @realDonaldTrump @johncardillo fire him
956003433215033346 2018-01-23 03:19:14 UTC <kilman_renee> release the memo.
955634334257557504 2018-01-22 02:52:34 UTC <kilman_renee> @PrisonPlanet these ladies should get get passports or visas and go live in a communist utopia.
955633796329680896 2018-01-22 02:50:26 UTC <kilman_renee> @realDonaldTrump @infowars we have the right - we pay the bills!
955268713418280960 2018-01-21 02:39:43 UTC <kilman_renee> why does this keep happening? I think we are seeing a pattern here, all the way back to the days of Hilary with a paper shredder.... remember that?https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/955224837110329344
955268279207186438 2018-01-21 02:38:00 UTC <kilman_renee> @cwarzel oh my - so she thinks she's a he's a big shot?
955267984972484613 2018-01-21 02:36:50 UTC <kilman_renee> @KRMGtulsa oh brother, she's like a clown
955266209284542464 2018-01-21 02:29:46 UTC <kilman_renee> @RCamposDuffy @FoxNews silly girls
955263754291249152 2018-01-21 02:20:01 UTC <kilman_renee> @SenateDems @HouseGOP sad
955257776565096448 2018-01-21 01:56:16 UTC <kilman_renee> @TomiLahren still here. hahahahahahha!!!!!!
955253629207875584 2018-01-21 01:39:47 UTC <kilman_renee> @TrumpsDC career politicians - not servants of the people.
955207422410452993 2018-01-21 22:36:11 UTC <kilman_renee> @FoxNews @NancyPelosi Liar!
955204653259599873 2018-01-21 22:25:10 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery More Clinton murders
954858904307093506 2018-01-20 23:31:17 UTC <kilman_renee> @HouseDemocrats @RepBobbyRush What a hilarious statement
948686002306125825 2018-01-03 22:42:23 UTC <kilman_renee> @FoxNews Did the fire originate with the overheated  paper shredder?
948685636508241920 2018-01-03 22:40:56 UTC <kilman_renee> @realDonaldTrump Let's take that money and help Puerto Rico, Texas, and Florida, and build the wall!
948186936333742080 2018-01-02 13:39:16 UTC <kilman_renee> no surprises there
948186279300255744 2018-01-02 13:36:40 UTC <kilman_renee> @larryelder but pigs in a blanket???
948185411695861761 2018-01-02 13:33:13 UTC <kilman_renee> @JackPosobiec and the only people to benefit will be a small elite group
948184159301832707 2018-01-02 13:28:14 UTC <kilman_renee> @MustafaTameez @FoxNews evidence?
948181136429277184 2018-01-02 13:16:13 UTC <kilman_renee> here we gohttps://twitter.com/BreitbartNews/status/948053784760111105
948180753581531136 2018-01-02 13:14:42 UTC <kilman_renee> @PrisonPlanet Will they prosecute people for criticizing Christians?
948180477407621120 2018-01-02 13:13:36 UTC <kilman_renee> @FoxNews she can raise her kid how she wants to. Parents have that liberty as long as they don't abuse their kids. As a mother of 5 I have learned that what you allow and what you don't allow can have consequences. Parents should think very hard about what they are teaching their kids
948179469021466625 2018-01-02 13:09:36 UTC <kilman_renee> @Fintribune @chuckwoolery @MarkYoungTruth there are no gray areas anymore - that should be clear
948177868143693825 2018-01-02 13:03:14 UTC <kilman_renee> @RealJamesWoods well lets just see how that goes
948176864526454784 2018-01-02 12:59:15 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery never even heard of it
948040917319024640 2018-01-01 03:59:03 UTC <kilman_renee> @DRUDGE_REPORT Typical narcist thug
947505450488139776 2017-12-31 16:31:17 UTC <kilman_renee> @NomDeVoyage1 everyone in lib-life is doing what libbers do; save their own rear-ends when it starts to get hot. thats not really accountability its situational ethics
947504856268357632 2017-12-31 16:28:56 UTC <kilman_renee> @TwitchyTeam These are the people who want to live in a "nanny state", they don't want to be responsible for their own decisions. Like alyssa, she knows she hates Pres. Trump, so why would she read all of his tweets? but glad she did.
947502970794643456 2017-12-31 16:21:26 UTC <kilman_renee> @MrPatriarch12 scary thought
947502340369772544 2017-12-31 16:18:56 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery Yes, we need more fairy tales and bedtime stories to put us to sleep so you all can make carnage of us
947501476712153088 2017-12-31 16:15:30 UTC <kilman_renee> @Twitter @RealJamesWoods what the hell?
947499023858044928 2017-12-31 16:05:45 UTC <kilman_renee> @KatrinaPierson @FoxBusiness I'm seeing a typical disfunctional abuser pattern here with the clintons and obamas; beat 'em down and then blame the abused. Pres. Trump on the otherhand is like the benevolent parent or spouse that encourages, builds up and makes it possible to achieve.
947497335579430913 2017-12-31 15:59:03 UTC <kilman_renee> @BreitbartNews Kathy, just own it. You blew it
947497213047033857 2017-12-31 15:58:33 UTC <kilman_renee> @POTUS @FoxNews don't believe it

940397535293734913 2017-12-11 01:46:58 UTC <kilman_renee> @WhiteIsTheFury that's what they do. nothing original though.
940396330928758785 2017-12-11 01:42:11 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery The American citizens aren't falling for it. We've been watching them sweep their dirt under the rug for all these years and now suddenly they have a come to Jesus moment? no. It is all about power and politics. just wolves dressing as sheep

939827611848663040 2017-12-10 12:02:18 UTC <kilman_renee> so sad that the people who "claim" to represent the black community and civil rights exercise their civil rights being politicians.https://twitter.com/DRUDGE_REPORT/status/939715161379692544
939826511825301504 2017-12-10 11:57:56 UTC <kilman_renee> @WattersWorld @PressSec @FoxNews the man that said Donald @realDonaldTrump would never be president takes credit for his accomplishments. shame on you obama

"go kill yourself" they say. that's what bullies say.

939624152096477184 2017-12-09 22:33:49 UTC <kilman_renee> @dcexaminer well, ms handler, a beautiful woman without discretion is like a gold ring in a pig snout. Sarah Sanders proves not only to be highly intelligent, therefore does not lower herself to your standards, but is a beautiful representative of real women.
939623123607019522 2017-12-09 22:29:44 UTC <kilman_renee> oh poke-a-haunt-us. why do you lie so much?https://twitter.com/SenateGOP/status/939582673735049218

936994338650894337 2017-12-02 16:23:53 UTC <kilman_renee> @NewtTrump as much evidence there is on the clintons, destruction of government property, haiti, dossier, comey testimony... anyone else would've been locked up. the FBI, congress, or the department of justice are dirty! everyone sitting in jail for lesser crimes than these should go free.

935325892641021952 2017-11-27 01:54:04 UTC <kilman_renee> @NinaMorton if he is guilty he should step aside. if he is innocent, then he should fight like it.
935321059829714946 2017-11-27 01:34:52 UTC <kilman_renee> @DineshDSouza @GaltsGultch so... republican women are uneducated, "low-class" women?

934842776377872385 2017-11-26 17:54:21 UTC <kilman_renee> @BreitbartNews oh yeah. no. what we have seen is the democratic party get behind groups like BLM and ANTIFA. ask the people whose property, businesses, time and jobs were disrupted by senseless rioting, vandalism, violence, and destruction how they feel about that.
934841710395437056 2017-11-26 17:50:06 UTC <kilman_renee> @NancyPelosi @IngrahamAngle I never heard of him until his perverted behavior came to light.
934837548148494336 2017-11-26 17:33:34 UTC <kilman_renee> @BreitbartNews does she actually believe in hell?
934836962858602498 2017-11-26 17:31:15 UTC <kilman_renee> @MariaBartiromo @FoxNews oh, look where they are from! are there really any real republicans serving these states?? no one seems to be fighting for you New York, New Jersey and California.

934607465366392833 2017-11-25 02:19:18 UTC <kilman_renee> @JackPosobiec well then, she must be doing something right. They don't have a good reason to dislike her so they have to attack her personally
934589906155917312 2017-11-25 01:09:32 UTC <kilman_renee> @JackPosobiec I don't see any black people

934586887259475968 2017-11-25 00:57:32 UTC <kilman_renee> @SenSanders I think with the Republican tax cuts we might actually see a rise in wages.
934583951678730241 2017-11-25 00:45:52 UTC <kilman_renee> @TheDemocrats are you talking about taking away deductions?
934583059151773697 2017-11-25 00:42:19 UTC <kilman_renee> @BruceBartlett what is your proof that republicans literally hate higher education?

934517091117490176 2017-11-25 20:20:11 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery Maybe Hilbil would have better luck running for president there
934515947645304832 2017-11-25 20:15:39 UTC <kilman_renee> @HouseDemocrats Can I get a lower deductible and premiums, and can I get my old doctor back?
934515519796981760 2017-11-25 20:13:57 UTC <kilman_renee> @MattWalshBlog I'm pretty sure it is illegal to smoke in a Mall. That's my takeaway from all of this. Oh yeah, and her dad is a smoker.
934514719322529792 2017-11-25 20:10:46 UTC <kilman_renee> @TheDemocrats I'm covered! I'm broke but I'm covered
934514228546895872 2017-11-25 20:08:49 UTC <kilman_renee> @JackPosobiec Most of what comes from the left is sick and depraved, and violent

934442235382435840 2017-11-25 15:22:44 UTC <kilman_renee> @BreitbartNews We need to end government subsidies to NFL.
934441929655439360 2017-11-25 15:21:31 UTC <kilman_renee> @JackPosobiec @politicalelle Maybe Hilbil will be his running mate
934440877069651973 2017-11-25 15:17:20 UTC <kilman_renee> @KurtSchlichter Yeah, serious issues
934246257782083584 2017-11-24 02:23:59 UTC <kilman_renee> @JackPosobiec Here today forgotten tomorrow.
934245182379347969 2017-11-24 02:19:43 UTC <kilman_renee> @JackPosobiec Apparently miss @AprilDRyan is intimidated by intelligent, tactful women.
934227246562336768 2017-11-24 01:08:27 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery I want my money back

934200557165858817 2017-11-24 23:22:24 UTC <kilman_renee> @FoxNews If only they could add some pork
934200247609380864 2017-11-24 23:21:10 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery Did you hear about the professor that identifies as a hippo? True story
934199774567436288 2017-11-24 23:19:17 UTC <kilman_renee> @FoxNews What was so terrible Bernie? Don't you have enough houses? Your choice to sell out to Hilary.
934142862911995904 2017-11-24 19:33:08 UTC <kilman_renee> The Dems are having a 20% off sale, but the Republicans are having a 30% off sale and they have MAGA hats!!!
934138010999934977 2017-11-24 19:13:51 UTC <kilman_renee> @JackPosobiec Why, indeed. Another commentary of the sad times we live in
934136540653150209 2017-11-24 19:08:01 UTC <kilman_renee> @GOP Dems are have a 30%sale.
934134358801297414 2017-11-24 18:59:21 UTC <kilman_renee> @TheDemocrats Have you got your Obama care?
934133990063296513 2017-11-24 18:57:53 UTC <kilman_renee> @DRUDGE_REPORT I seem to remember the college diet of mainly ramen noodles

934133177840537601 2017-11-24 18:54:39 UTC <kilman_renee> @benshapiro That's some serious self loathing
934088066427506689 2017-11-24 15:55:24 UTC <kilman_renee> @TheDemocrats Do you have any MAGA hats?
934085676244590593 2017-11-24 15:45:54 UTC <kilman_renee> @dbongino @guypbenson Ate any of these people actually journalists? They all seem like a bunch of pretty actors.
934084602502832129 2017-11-24 15:41:38 UTC <kilman_renee> @President1Trump What's the politicized FBI going to do with them? We've given up hope on the FBI doing what's right
934083984958607362 2017-11-24 15:39:11 UTC <kilman_renee> @FoxNews @SheriffClarke Agreed
934081570331381760 2017-11-24 15:29:35 UTC <kilman_renee> @JackPosobiec They and their opinion are irrelevant

933761218229260288 2017-11-23 18:16:37 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery Speak for yourself hateful @HillaryClinton . We love our brothers and sisters regardless of skin color.
933669650675662848 2017-11-23 12:12:46 UTC <kilman_renee> @HarmlessYardDog wow. should this woman be a nurse at all?

933665845192126464 2017-11-23 11:57:38 UTC <kilman_renee> @TheDemocrats do you still have the "I'm With Her" shirts?
933665072823635968 2017-11-23 11:54:34 UTC <kilman_renee> @Thomas1774Paine you know Trump supporters dont stoop that low. Leave that to the Hilary and  Bernie supporters. You know it's bound to happen
933664192086921217 2017-11-23 11:51:04 UTC <kilman_renee> @TheDemocrats you will say anything. with the increase in income parents can afford to buy their own school supplies.
933663220102987776 2017-11-23 11:47:12 UTC <kilman_renee> @marklevinshow He's just doing it for the fame. Maybe CNN will finance his reality show on cable
933662781638959104 2017-11-23 11:45:28 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery move to North Korea

933406773020684289 2017-11-22 18:48:11 UTC <kilman_renee> @TheDemocrats Our whole family used to be Democrats. But then we all started looking at how Dems reps voted and realized we were not being represented
933339417980358656 2017-11-22 14:20:32 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery I love her.
933339230545350656 2017-11-22 14:19:47 UTC <kilman_renee> @EmilyLindin As a wife (of a man) and mother of son's I find this appalling. Let's get real and go after the real predators
933337728825155584 2017-11-22 14:13:49 UTC <kilman_renee> @marcorubio Let's cut some spending. Begin with the legal fees and payouts to keep sexual predators on the job. Then let's look at subsidies paid to NFL
933337051537256449 2017-11-22 14:11:08 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery Out the pervs!!!
933336548099133440 2017-11-22 14:09:08 UTC <kilman_renee> @realDonaldTrump When tax payers stop funding the NFL! Don't know why I work my a.. off and pay subsidies to NFL
933335978311380992 2017-11-22 14:06:52 UTC <kilman_renee> @SheriffClarke It seems to me that the Dems are the party that supports or condones aberrant behavior. Holding the door open for sexual preditors
933137182231089153 2017-11-21 00:56:55 UTC <kilman_renee> @JudicialWatch @HilaryClinton_ singing, "Oh say can you see?????"
933136877909135361 2017-11-21 00:55:43 UTC <kilman_renee> she is so out of touch. @NancyPelosi just shows up for the cameras.https://twitter.com/chuckwoolery/status/933135658276851713

933110555077988352 2017-11-21 23:11:07 UTC <kilman_renee> @theblaze @chuckwoolery What a joke
932426896477966336 2017-11-19 01:54:30 UTC <kilman_renee> @RepDelBene @HouseDemocrats Demonomics didn't work either. Maybe we should just abolish taxes all together
932300119684337664 2017-11-19 17:30:44 UTC <kilman_renee> @GoAngelo @seanhannity @GeraldoRivera I watch very little TV. Most of it is propaganda anyway.

932297614665637888 2017-11-19 17:20:47 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery @MarkYoungTruth Out of sight, out of touch
932297295621738496 2017-11-19 17:19:31 UTC <kilman_renee> @FoxNews Mostly it's just an elite club giving themselves a cheek-kiss, it's not for outsiders
932296202934280192 2017-11-19 17:15:10 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery @MarkYoungTruth @BarackObama , what have you done your reduce gun violence in Chicago in all these years?
932293594496622594 2017-11-19 17:04:48 UTC <kilman_renee> @BreitbartNews Maybe retailers could afford to pay higher wages to their employees if it weren't for all the retail theft that Rob's their profits

932290344351404032 2017-11-19 16:51:53 UTC <kilman_renee> @BreitbartNews Wow. Shameful response from a father. No wonder his son thought it was okay to steal from the hard-working people of   China.
932289057513754624 2017-11-19 16:46:47 UTC <kilman_renee> @DRUDGE_REPORT Ok. I will say Happy Behold a Child has been born to us, our Salvation!

931929830626615296 2017-11-18 16:59:20 UTC <kilman_renee> @nypost @TomFitton These crimes are not just a pile of charges in a box. they are crimes against the entire population of the United States. There are people charged of lesser crimes living in prison cells.
931928030678781952 2017-11-18 16:52:11 UTC <kilman_renee> @FoxNews it has no place. the holidays are a time for celebration, thankfulness, love and peace
931927822045798400 2017-11-18 16:51:21 UTC <kilman_renee> @TheDemocrats wow @KamalaHarris that's really compassionate. guess who voted against the Obama healthcare fiasco... not the one percent. they could care less, they have no worries.
931925408488017921 2017-11-18 16:41:46 UTC <kilman_renee> I am always impressed with @FLOTUS style. So simple, yet elegant, feminine, and flattering. great style. Almost forgot about the uproar of designers who refused to dress First Lady, as if they were even asked.
931924083868041217 2017-11-18 16:36:30 UTC <kilman_renee> @RealJamesWoods blah-blah-blah hilary.
931919734295146497 2017-11-18 16:19:13 UTC <kilman_renee> @FOX23 how do you separate a person from their soul? national group is wrong. separation of church and state means the government shall not interfere with a person's religion.
931916999265083395 2017-11-18 16:08:21 UTC <kilman_renee> @BreitbartNews oh, ok.
931912477515964416 2017-11-18 15:50:23 UTC <kilman_renee> @TheDemocrats I can't afford to go to college anyway. Thanks dems for overtaxing the American people, taking donations using them for criminal enterprises.
931912048820101121 2017-11-18 15:48:41 UTC <kilman_renee> @michael17898 just her word.... as if it has no value? and #lenadunham 's word does? can Lena prove it? Well, we have Lena's words, public property, lies and all.

931910632538017793 2017-11-18 15:43:03 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery and all women should be liars, cheaters, scammers, and shut up about their abuse
931910290459037697 2017-11-18 15:41:41 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery clearly she didn't get her money's worth. but then ill-gotten gain really doesn't pan out.

931908973724426240 2017-11-18 15:36:28 UTC <kilman_renee> @TheDemocrats democrats take in the most money from wealthy donors. In fact the wealthiest people in the country are democratic donors. And of course oil rich (human rights exploiting) countries.
931907540958445568 2017-11-18 15:30:46 UTC <kilman_renee> @BreitbartNews what?
931906990439362562 2017-11-18 15:28:35 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery this is the problem with situational ethics.
931906718308716544 2017-11-18 15:27:30 UTC <kilman_renee> @DineshDSouza pedaling backwards?

926488144542879744 2017-11-03 16:36:01 UTC <kilman_renee> @realDonaldTrump President Trump, it looks like the tax plan isn't going to give the middle class a break, just a take away deductions plan.

919696403743600640 2017-10-15 22:48:04 UTC <kilman_renee> @chuckwoolery I don't recall conservatives threatening to leave the country if Obama won. And if they had, they would have kept their word.
