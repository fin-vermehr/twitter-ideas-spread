960355962350481409 2018-02-04 03:34:38 UTC <hallballz> @djdurkin yep
960320825034342400 2018-02-04 01:15:01 UTC <hallballz> @djdurkin Maybe the only creative play Dowell ever called.
959127488973672450 2018-02-01 18:13:07 UTC <hallballz> @KVNU #deseraeturner will never be the same. That life is over. The max sentence doesnt even come close to justice for these two.

951593615737925634 2018-01-11 23:16:12 UTC <hallballz> @suntimes_sports Come on @utahjazz.  Make this happen!
951308771237814272 2018-01-10 04:24:20 UTC <hallballz> @USUBasketball Aggies lost this game at the start of the sec half.  Didnt come out ready to play.
949421182872367105 2018-01-05 23:23:44 UTC <hallballz> @TarikCohen @LarryMayer @ChicagoBears Fox getting canned was my favorite play by far.
948392791704420352 2018-01-02 03:17:16 UTC <hallballz> @BUrlacher54 @ChicagoBears Cooper should watch this so he knows how to take one to the house.
948382887614627840 2018-01-02 02:37:55 UTC <hallballz> @DavidHaugh @danwiederer Wasnt Pace forced to hire Fox?
948330927637389313 2018-01-02 23:11:26 UTC <hallballz> @KVNU Great news. Someone other than Mitt would be great news as well.
948013387996385280 2018-01-01 02:09:39 UTC <hallballz> @ChicagoBears Then let him do his job. Stay away from the interview process.
947983811467534338 2018-01-01 00:12:07 UTC <hallballz> @adamjahns @Pixel22XL No one can easily win games in Cleveland.  Thats crazy talk.

Bears were sorry this year. According to players theyve been on the rise for a while now. Go win some freaking games!
947910384463286272 2018-01-01 19:20:21 UTC <hallballz> @PrinceAmukamara @ChicagoBears Prove it in the record books. Prove it on the field.

947889016229244928 2018-01-01 17:55:27 UTC <hallballz> @MorrisseyCST How can we watch the press conference?
947871948826206208 2018-01-01 16:47:37 UTC <hallballz> @BradBiggs I thought TE was our strongest position. Feels like we sign one on a weekly basis. And still there is no production from that position. WTH?
947865127679913991 2018-01-01 16:20:31 UTC <hallballz> @BradBiggs @Rich_Campbell @ChicagoSports 1- I dont see Harbaugh leaving M. 2- I dont see him and Pace working well together.

947630469373247490 2017-12-31 00:48:04 UTC <hallballz> @ChicagoBears take plenty of shots tomorrow when Foxy gets canned.
947630298488909825 2017-12-31 00:47:23 UTC <hallballz> @MarkPotash Bears need a coach to come shake things up.  Players are way too comfortable with how things are right now.
947585932852477952 2017-12-31 21:51:06 UTC <hallballz> @Mtrubisky10 @ChicagoBears Man, I hope this kid succeeds!  Get him some weapons and a coach.

942835903524888576 2017-12-18 19:16:11 UTC <hallballz> @ChicagoBears Hey John, how are you and the coaches preparing to lose to the Browns?

942830694455054337 2017-12-18 18:55:29 UTC <hallballz> @ChicagoBears been hearing that for the past four years.  This team is a joke.  All lip service.

942769907040534528 2017-12-18 14:53:56 UTC <hallballz> @djdurkin being highly inconsistent.

941714417271562240 2017-12-15 16:59:47 UTC <hallballz> @tribjazz Thats cute.
941712979350847488 2017-12-15 16:54:05 UTC <hallballz> @E_Woodyard Thanks for opening the door for @spidadmitchell
939922541790994432 2017-12-10 18:19:31 UTC <hallballz> @adamjahns doing something that matters.
939916247256350720 2017-12-10 17:54:30 UTC <hallballz> @MarkPotash Add him to the list.  Pace's track record of FA is terrible.
939914381948682240 2017-12-10 17:47:06 UTC <hallballz> @LarryMayer what are the chances that Pace's off season FA actually play today?
939914024057061376 2017-12-10 17:45:40 UTC <hallballz> @ChicagoBears that is one empty stadium.
939913830208901120 2017-12-10 17:44:54 UTC <hallballz> @adamjahns McPhee out?  What a shocker!
939913665507074049 2017-12-10 17:44:15 UTC <hallballz> @GriffeyFanMD @djdurkin last years crop of FA is not helping Pace.
939893156069310465 2017-12-10 16:22:45 UTC <hallballz> @Daniel_Brown10 @The_Dream99 @Mtrubisky10 @ChicagoBears Lookin good TruBearsky.  Take it to the field and sling it.
939892980084744193 2017-12-10 16:22:03 UTC <hallballz> @Rich_Campbell they fired out of date Jeff Fisher.  Get with the Da program @ChicagoBears
939547368227201024 2017-12-09 17:28:43 UTC <hallballz> @BradBiggs Put Glennon out there with this rag tag team.  They wont let TruBearsky open it up anyways.  If he gets hurt closing out this crap hole of a season how's that going to help?
939283725795430400 2017-12-08 00:01:05 UTC <hallballz> @MarkPotash Like a lot of other guys Pace has brought in, huge disappointment.
939283305224077313 2017-12-08 23:59:25 UTC <hallballz> @patrickfinley Like its really going to make a difference at this point.
939000606089285633 2017-12-07 05:16:04 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer @Trilla_28 Their roster isnt that good. They have Aaron Rogers though. That makes up for a lot of deficiencies
938900258318295041 2017-12-07 22:37:20 UTC <hallballz> @ChicagoBears another great day of preparation.
938899549090856960 2017-12-07 22:34:31 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer @Trilla_28 Well the game is measured by wins and loses.  So if Da Bears were 16-0 no one would complain.   But you wouldn't understand that because you don't think its about wins and loses.
938847470502719488 2017-12-07 19:07:34 UTC <hallballz> @Eric_Edholm @ArthurArkush @Hub_Arkush And Da Bears will sit idle while all the good candidates are picked off.
938846570442821632 2017-12-07 19:03:59 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer @Trilla_28 Actually it is measured by W or L.  If you dont understand that than youre better off being a Browns fan.
938788350508568578 2017-12-07 15:12:39 UTC <hallballz> @davidaxelrod Yes just like your buddy Bill Clinton.
938772459087712266 2017-12-07 14:09:30 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer @Trilla_28 Yep Youre Right Pace has loaded this roster with talent. We were 6-10, 3-14, and 3-9 now. Thats some improvement there. You got me.
938645066666725376 2017-12-06 05:43:17 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer @Trilla_28 Glennon, Wheaton, Cooper, Sims, McPhee, Dempts, White. Some good vision there.
938573918620631046 2017-12-06 01:00:34 UTC <hallballz> @DavidHaugh @danwiederer Chicago hasnt seen your coaching strategy work.
938573150169612288 2017-12-06 00:57:31 UTC <hallballz> @Johnathan_Wood1 Steers try.
938530957887524864 2017-12-06 22:09:52 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer @Trilla_28 Fox/Pace have a worst record than Trestman right now. Thats a great vision.
938500033040801794 2017-12-06 20:06:59 UTC <hallballz> @ChicagoBears I bet they had a great day of preparation.

938499619763474440 2017-12-06 20:05:20 UTC <hallballz> @ChicagoBears So inspiring.
938470322659123201 2017-12-06 18:08:55 UTC <hallballz> @AdamHoge @MorrisseyCST @adamjahns Oh yeah and Glennon.
938470161350320128 2017-12-06 18:08:17 UTC <hallballz> @AdamHoge @MorrisseyCST @adamjahns Cooper and Wheaten have been well worth the $.
938469890171834368 2017-12-06 18:07:12 UTC <hallballz> @InnerGee_ktg @BradBiggs Look at the Niners receivers. No bodies!  They were open all day on Da Bears.
938469650710622208 2017-12-06 18:06:15 UTC <hallballz> @InnerGee_ktg @BradBiggs He might have been a good coach. Those days are long gone.
938469284736655360 2017-12-06 18:04:48 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer His vision blows so far. No improvement since hes been here.
938247707810025473 2017-12-05 03:24:19 UTC <hallballz> @tribjazz Rudy got worked tonight.
937842819460452353 2017-12-04 00:35:27 UTC <hallballz> @KVNU Its always fascinating how Valley folks forget how to drive in the snow.

937842249072893952 2017-12-04 00:33:11 UTC <hallballz> @ChicagoBears Does he know how to make field goals and stay healthy?  Also, why is John Fox still the coach of this team?
937781390636019712 2017-12-04 20:31:21 UTC <hallballz> @kylegoon @TaylorWAnderson pic.twitter.com/rVdA2c7Knf
937770292004323329 2017-12-04 19:47:15 UTC <hallballz> @Rich_Campbell Fox on whether Da Bears will have a new head coach come next season.  No Doubt
937769600392949761 2017-12-04 19:44:30 UTC <hallballz> @patrickfinley has Pace been asked by Fox is still here?  Curious to what his answer would be.
937728639579209728 2017-12-04 17:01:44 UTC <hallballz> @danpompei It's pretty obvious that is was a HUGE mistake.
937721923055656960 2017-12-04 16:35:03 UTC <hallballz> @RapSheet John Fox next please.
937720485239910400 2017-12-04 16:29:20 UTC <hallballz> @Rich_Campbell @danwiederer I hear Barth is available.
937703182427340800 2017-12-04 15:20:35 UTC <hallballz> @WBBMNewsradio @adamjahns @ZachZaidman We've seen everything you've got and it SUCKS!
937702910686781441 2017-12-04 15:19:30 UTC <hallballz> @MarkPotash @patrickfinley To say Ryan Pace needs another year because he drafted MT10 is stupid.  Look at Pace's FA signings! They can't stay healthy, don't produce, use PEDs, etc.
937700158153768960 2017-12-04 15:08:33 UTC <hallballz> @MarkPotash @patrickfinley What's the benefit of not firing him NOW?
937544233270910976 2017-12-03 04:48:58 UTC <hallballz> @djdurkin @Knee_Mart and yet Fox is still Da coach.
937521049410797568 2017-12-03 03:16:51 UTC <hallballz> @ArthurArkush Has fox been canned yet?  That's all we're interested in at this point.
937508954795417600 2017-12-03 02:28:47 UTC <hallballz> @ArthurArkush @Hub_Arkush Can Pace fire Fox on his own?  Or does he need the approval from the higher ups?
937438757862514688 2017-12-03 21:49:51 UTC <hallballz> @ChicagoBears We always hear "we had a great week of prep, we just didn't execute".  Holy Hell that is getting old.
937438460360589312 2017-12-03 21:48:40 UTC <hallballz> @patrickfinley Does fox know that is the game plan?
937431045737037824 2017-12-03 21:19:12 UTC <hallballz> @patrickfinley Pace's FA moves are looking worse and worse.
937429274180468736 2017-12-03 21:12:10 UTC <hallballz> @Rich_Campbell hopefully this was his late chance too.
937428900325421056 2017-12-03 21:10:41 UTC <hallballz> @ChicagoBears Interrupt this clown now and fire him.
937428503569383424 2017-12-03 21:09:06 UTC <hallballz> @adamjahns No one on this team stays healthy.  what the hell?
937427493354532864 2017-12-03 21:05:05 UTC <hallballz> @Rich_Campbell He's looking at the tape.
937427281999548416 2017-12-03 21:04:15 UTC <hallballz> @ZachZaidman Good on him!  He's what Da Bears used to be.
937427019326930944 2017-12-03 21:03:12 UTC <hallballz> @olin_kreutz I'm sure there's a high school coach around more than willing to show Fox and his staff how too.
937426720847667200 2017-12-03 21:02:01 UTC <hallballz> @patrickfinley should be more
937415385892184066 2017-12-03 20:16:58 UTC <hallballz> Bears 3rd down D is sad  #SFvsCHI
937349745357545472 2017-12-03 15:56:09 UTC <hallballz> @DickersonESPN Thats pretty assuming
936773468208562176 2017-12-01 01:46:13 UTC <hallballz> @MorrisseyCST When they lose fire everyone and bring in a high school staff.
936667007251914752 2017-12-01 18:43:11 UTC <hallballz> @adamjahns I hope TruBearsky plays well.  Winning at this point doesn't help Da Bears though.
936657033671032832 2017-12-01 18:03:33 UTC <hallballz> @patrickfinley Da Bears need to lose at this point.  Winning accomplishes nothing.
936056682144296961 2017-11-29 02:17:58 UTC <hallballz> @MorrisseyCST Ive been saying this for awhile. Pace FA signings have been terrible. Hicks is about it for being productive. I mean he gave Glennon how much $?!
935999545997131778 2017-11-29 22:30:56 UTC <hallballz> @Grindin_59 @ChicagoBears Careful dont hurt yourself.
935966419006689280 2017-11-29 20:19:18 UTC <hallballz> @ChicagoBears Stop asking him questions. Maybe then hell understand no one cares what he has to say.
935966081021366275 2017-11-29 20:17:57 UTC <hallballz> @adamjahns Yeah well this team is farther away than we would have designed.

935947238353899522 2017-11-29 19:03:05 UTC <hallballz> @patrickfinley It still sticks from here.
935947070023897088 2017-11-29 19:02:25 UTC <hallballz> @ArthurArkush The D has been as inconsistent and undisciplined as the O. Da Bears need a fresh start. By Vic
935707649542443008 2017-11-28 03:11:02 UTC <hallballz> @AdamHoge @adamjahns Niners have a coach with potential. Da Bears have Fox. Enough said.
935553419061764096 2017-11-28 16:58:11 UTC <hallballz> @BradBiggs Can we over look the horrible FA signings of Ryan Pace?  Glennon, Cooper, Wheaton, Freeman, Trevathon, McPhee, Sims. Injury, suspension, or otherwise these guys have not produced. Is Pace the right guy for this rebuild?
935524000695848961 2017-11-28 15:01:17 UTC <hallballz> @ChicagoBears The fire John fox cause.
935240867299803141 2017-11-27 20:16:13 UTC <hallballz> @Suntimes @patrickfinley Why is Pace not on the Hot seat as much as Fox?  Freeman, Cooper, Glennon, Wheaton, Mcphee, Sims, Trevathan, Dempts, Barth.  Bust after Bust after Bust.  Injury, suspension, or otherwise these guys have not produced.  The product they put on the field is TERRIBLE.
935239284625260544 2017-11-27 20:09:56 UTC <hallballz> @ChicagoBears blah, blah, blah.
935211489190805504 2017-11-27 18:19:29 UTC <hallballz> @danpompei John Fox was terrible, but we'll have to look at the film.  Oh yep he was terrible.
935203048304951298 2017-11-27 17:45:56 UTC <hallballz> @amandakaschube @Rich_Campbell Don't ask me, I don't know why they won't fire me.
935164758797332480 2017-11-27 15:13:47 UTC <hallballz> @ChicagoBears Seriously?  Asking "tough" questions? This team has been saying that since Lovie left.  Nothing changes
935007134009376773 2017-11-26 04:47:26 UTC <hallballz> @adamjahns @AdamHoge Way past due.
935004783492055041 2017-11-26 04:38:06 UTC <hallballz> @adamjahns He's played well.  What we need is some LBs who'll play 16 games.
935004317848764416 2017-11-26 04:36:15 UTC <hallballz> @JoeFortenbaugh @BradBiggs bet everything on the niners
934992132460261377 2017-11-26 03:47:50 UTC <hallballz> @BleacherReport I would love to hear Fox's explanation for what was wrong with the plane.  "Well it just didn't run well.  We'll have to look at the diagnostics before we can be sure, we can't blame it on one thing."
934965663344427008 2017-11-26 02:02:39 UTC <hallballz> @djdurkin Couldn't agree more.
934926349570945024 2017-11-26 23:26:26 UTC <hallballz> @KyleNabors @bears_insider @polishpistol7 Fire him already.  It's way over due.
934926104309067776 2017-11-26 23:25:28 UTC <hallballz> @MorrisseyCST Mitch's inaccuracy is worrisome.  Each game he misses on throws.  A good coach and coordinator would help though.  And some decent, healthy WRs.
934906736682483713 2017-11-26 22:08:30 UTC <hallballz> @AdamHoge then let him go.  Way over due.
934902718111424512 2017-11-26 21:52:32 UTC <hallballz> @djdurkin D-line have been studs this year.
934902340519313408 2017-11-26 21:51:02 UTC <hallballz> @JOEL9ONE @ChicagoBears Kyle to Chris: Get me the hell outta here.
934901910011764736 2017-11-26 21:49:19 UTC <hallballz> @Rich_Campbell In Utah, switched to Panthers vs Jets.
934901761277440000 2017-11-26 21:48:44 UTC <hallballz> @ChicagoBears He's so out of touch with the NFL of today.  Pathetic.
934901403377471488 2017-11-26 21:47:18 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer @Rich_Campbell Not prepared again
934870723042127873 2017-11-26 19:45:24 UTC <hallballz> @MorrisseyCST Smart guy
934870511250804737 2017-11-26 19:44:33 UTC <hallballz> @djdurkin How does Fox not get canned after this game?
934868718424817664 2017-11-26 19:37:26 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer Were well coached.
934868355252719616 2017-11-26 19:35:59 UTC <hallballz> @Rich_Campbell Amounts to horrible coaching. AGAIN!
934866189347622913 2017-11-26 19:27:23 UTC <hallballz> @adamjahns Worst coaching staff in the league.
934537659380314112 2017-11-25 21:41:55 UTC <hallballz> @ChicagoBears All the FA are either injured or cant get on the field. Bust city.
934537018322939905 2017-11-25 21:39:22 UTC <hallballz> @BradBiggs Man itd be nice to have some LBs to depend on.
934535919499128832 2017-11-25 21:35:00 UTC <hallballz> @adamjahns Flashes. Needs consistency
934220510828859392 2017-11-24 00:41:41 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer Anyone but the packers.
934220332885475328 2017-11-24 00:40:58 UTC <hallballz> @adamjahns Disappointing.
933130756326612992 2017-11-21 00:31:23 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer Its only  meaningless if Fox returns for another yr.
932396418395983873 2017-11-19 23:53:23 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer @Rich_Campbell Fuller. Cant. Catch.
932306163357454336 2017-11-19 17:54:45 UTC <hallballz> @adamjahns After last week should anyone be surprised?
932302415130279936 2017-11-19 17:39:51 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer Sims has been a HUGE disappointment
931554292086947840 2017-11-17 16:07:05 UTC <hallballz> @ChicagoBears no kidding.  Maybe try and change that for your fan base.
931379256512450561 2017-11-16 04:31:33 UTC <hallballz> @adamjahns Hes got to fire this clown first.
930623559281643520 2017-11-14 02:28:41 UTC <hallballz> @AdamHoge @adamjahns If?  When John Fox is let go. Hes done.
930458892877807616 2017-11-14 15:34:21 UTC <hallballz> @BradBiggs Why are so many people high on Fangio?  Tampa, both Packer games have not been very impressive. Seems like his D is as inconsistent as the O.

930189629965217792 2017-11-13 21:44:24 UTC <hallballz> @patrickfinley in hindsight the #Bears wouldn't have hired you.
930188905999056896 2017-11-13 21:41:31 UTC <hallballz> @Suntimes @patrickfinley Why is Fox still employed by #Bears?  Coming off a bye that was horrible.
930142770089558017 2017-11-13 18:38:12 UTC <hallballz> @TheAthleticCHI @djdurkin Very impressive
929923974015877120 2017-11-12 04:08:47 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer What are the chances Fox gets canned before seasons end?
929872592156192768 2017-11-12 00:44:36 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer Yet hes still the coach.
929825030451679232 2017-11-12 21:35:37 UTC <hallballz> @Rich_Campbell Complete incompetence
929817628738236418 2017-11-12 21:06:12 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer @Rich_Campbell Bye week debacle
929817106723549184 2017-11-12 21:04:08 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer Why is Fox still employed.
929815044061265921 2017-11-12 20:55:56 UTC <hallballz> @Rich_Campbell @michaelwinston4 Not if Fox sticks around. Out coached every week.
929814742931247105 2017-11-12 20:54:44 UTC <hallballz> @Rich_Campbell Packers could start Cobb at qb and theyd still beat da bears. Pathetic.
929814382825140224 2017-11-12 20:53:18 UTC <hallballz> @BradBiggs Pathetic
929811647920734208 2017-11-12 20:42:26 UTC <hallballz> @djdurkin Run, run, pass, punt. Repeat.
929811110529822724 2017-11-12 20:40:18 UTC <hallballz> @Rich_Campbell I bet its nice having legit WRs.
929807999853649921 2017-11-12 20:27:56 UTC <hallballz> @Rich_Campbell Imagine that
929806262988099585 2017-11-12 20:21:02 UTC <hallballz> @Rich_Campbell Now we can run the clock out.
929803411842879489 2017-11-12 20:09:42 UTC <hallballz> @djdurkin Fox should be gone as soon as this game is over.
929795617018302464 2017-11-12 19:38:44 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer @ECremeens1366 Out coached again
929794320269479936 2017-11-12 19:33:35 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer Continuing to move your pro bowl center around doesnt help things on the o line.
929792430911709184 2017-11-12 19:26:04 UTC <hallballz> @djdurkin We have a pro bowl center and hes playing guard. Fox is an idiot!
929749470841131010 2017-11-12 16:35:22 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer That hurts
918949703298859008 2017-10-13 21:20:57 UTC <hallballz> @BradBiggs what are the chances that the Bears go after recently released Boman?
913853140197294080 2017-09-29 19:49:01 UTC <hallballz> @danwiederer why are there no rumblings for Fox to get canned?  He's been horrible!
