889959744680718337 2017-07-25 21:25:12 UTC <go3go3go> @BeefGolf Would the bombers throttle back if  lift clean and place was in effect in every fairway?  Would that help to place a premium on accuracy?

819959504972484609 2017-01-13 17:29:14 UTC <go3go3go> @CoachJoeyD late. Run to first tee. 3/4 swing. Only fairway I'll hit on the front nine.
819588655119470596 2017-01-12 16:55:37 UTC <go3go3go> @ClayTravis Does that include asking for Clint Eastwood's?
799696181119119362 2016-11-18 19:30:01 UTC <go3go3go> @sniffpetrol couldn't find a booster seat for @RichardHammond ?
799635348670349312 2016-11-18 15:28:18 UTC <go3go3go> Hey @alan_starc I'll have to follow @geoff_calkins just to watch this.  Let me know when you're through with him and I'll wash him away.
797715131509547009 2016-11-13 08:18:02 UTC <go3go3go> @ufc @DaleJr @StenhouseJr @DanicaPatrick  You're lying Ricky.   You were really watching @SheaPatterson_1  and Ole Miss beat them aggies!
796754088566239232 2016-11-10 16:39:12 UTC <go3go3go> @AmeristarVI @bobounds none of the above it's @FauxPelini
796530238024871936 2016-11-09 01:49:42 UTC <go3go3go> @wikileaks @dwsNY yes.  Yes we do.
796477866200285185 2016-11-09 22:21:35 UTC <go3go3go> @westonking_18 oh yeah. I'm quite sure that's gonna happen.
795299970702307329 2016-11-06 16:21:03 UTC <go3go3go> @UW @CollegeGameDay I wonder if the Washington State flag will make it in or be torn to shreds.
793571998966448128 2016-11-01 21:54:43 UTC <go3go3go> @ClayTravis So you don't mind a sharp increase in child beatings in Alabama I see.
792145587143671808 2016-10-28 23:26:39 UTC <go3go3go> @CFTalk So OU and OSU could play two weeks in a row?????  Just plain stupid.
786982178790014976 2016-10-14 17:29:07 UTC <go3go3go> @seinlanguage I still don't know what that means.
786401590257254404 2016-10-12 03:02:04 UTC <go3go3go> @KTEkey I'll take a free Hotty Toddy then. Go ahead, you can say it.
784488033265520640 2016-10-07 20:18:16 UTC <go3go3go> @ClayTravis wait, since you don't play for Bama then doesn't that mean you DO have A/C privilege? U should go rob a house in Monroe.
784130078707970048 2016-10-06 20:35:53 UTC <go3go3go> @ClayTravis in a case where games weren't played it should go to common opponents. I.e. record in the east, then head to head.
781856657408221184 2016-09-30 14:02:07 UTC <go3go3go> @SafewayOpen @GCTigerTracker u c him get out of that cart this morning on TV?Moved rather slowly with a grimaced look on his face. Doubtful.

768579484995952640 2016-08-24 22:43:23 UTC <go3go3go> @jtimberlake @ClayTravis dude, that swing should cost you at least 10,000 followers.

763396362725629952 2016-08-10 15:27:30 UTC <go3go3go> @HKellenbergerCL Which is better- 13 under 59 or a 12 under 58?
760696283942248449 2016-08-02 04:38:21 UTC <go3go3go> @DaleJr not according to @espn but very glad to hear that.
759140423289962500 2016-07-29 21:35:55 UTC <go3go3go> @beemerpga "Awesome!" said @Visa , @Mastercard , @Discover  and @AmericanExpress

758839027608932352 2016-07-28 01:38:17 UTC <go3go3go> @CollegeGameDay @espn it sure seems like Keith Jackson has been retired much longer than that. #possumhuntinmoon
757969377274826752 2016-07-26 16:02:36 UTC <go3go3go> @McIlroyRory @PGAChampionship and @jacknicklaus  only 4 yards behind.
755814888816062465 2016-07-20 17:21:26 UTC <go3go3go> @ClayTravis @Outkick do u foresee a conf ever trading/buying out small market teams such as MS State, Purdue, etc?
752294551675699200 2016-07-10 00:12:52 UTC <go3go3go> @JasonSobelESPN was played with all bunkers as waste bunkers. Grounding the club made no difference. Clean up the rule book!!!!!!
752293831148724224 2016-07-10 00:10:00 UTC <go3go3go> @JasonSobelESPN way too many unnecessary rules in golf that can lead to situations such as this. PGA championship a few years ago......
752289863966330880 2016-07-10 23:54:15 UTC <go3go3go> @bkatrek they're waiting. Should be called before next play/shot like instant replay in football.
752289538295402496 2016-07-10 23:52:57 UTC <go3go3go> @JasonSobelESPN should be like review in football. If it's not called before the next shot (play) then no penalty unless intent is clear
748536467937443840 2016-06-30 15:19:35 UTC <go3go3go> @RichardHammond so @ClayTravis it appears you are a bit short and get made fun of by your associates quite often.pic.twitter.com/wido9VzeKV

744932061480312832 2016-06-20 16:36:58 UTC <go3go3go> @GrahamDeLaet @RealRickyBarnes @scoreband what if I almost hit the Retweet button, stop then hit it?  Do I only get 1 ticket?
744341288162594816 2016-06-18 01:29:26 UTC <go3go3go> @MackAlexander20 @SuccessfulQuon @Vikings Lasorda is still alive?  I'd missed that one.
744272145476427776 2016-06-18 20:54:42 UTC <go3go3go> If @cedarpoint isn't on your list then your bucket is ashamed of you.

741389498739757056 2016-06-10 22:00:05 UTC <go3go3go> @RexHoggardGC my last bogey free round was at Spanish Bay. Won six bucks with a 115.  A quad and a quint really killed my round.

740205378621837313 2016-06-07 15:34:49 UTC <go3go3go> @CoachJim4UM @CoachDerekMason @finebaum @SEC Nah. I'll take @SC_HBC as my scramble partner and probably never even have to hit a sandy.
739085569880363008 2016-06-04 13:25:06 UTC <go3go3go> @MattAdamsFoL @SiriusXMPGATOUR @GolfDigest the ball was photoshopped out of those last four pics. Still the greatest though!
735546072035143680 2016-05-25 19:00:24 UTC <go3go3go> @bryanbrosgolf I'd have a better chance of getting a warm pat of butter up a wildcat's ass than completing that.
735299196815826948 2016-05-24 02:39:24 UTC <go3go3go> @ClayTravis is your golf game like Phil's too?

733275483060731906 2016-05-19 12:37:53 UTC <go3go3go> @RobLowe I've got a much worse one - "The Grinder was canceled."
732977566529781760 2016-05-18 16:54:04 UTC <go3go3go> @BillyHo_Golf I played with @BeatrizRecari n pro-am. Very nice lady!  She loves her @pxg.  I don't remember her screaming that though.
