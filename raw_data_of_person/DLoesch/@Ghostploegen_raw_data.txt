Facts are: He was a man in power taking advantage of a intern, while married, while being accused of attacks on women that were not consenting (like Roy Moore). But, we should move on ? Not supporting Roy Moore, just pointing out the hypocrisy.

966549958319992832 2018-02-21 05:47:22 UTC <Ghostploegen> @cwarzel @velour_shirt And thats good how ?

966036546192261121 2018-02-20 19:47:15 UTC <Ghostploegen> @CNN @MarkRubello @mxbvvv I see. Never mind.

Congress votes on bill, sends to president, president signs or vetos bill. Bill becomes law. If you want the bill, pass the bill. Point the finger at the mirror and do your job.

964415119219310592 2018-02-16 08:24:17 UTC <Ghostploegen> @politico @dangeroo_ To own a gun there you must exhibit that you have training , not a criminal and mentally healthy, have a license. Here, you must not have a felony. Hell, its harder to get a drivers lic here than it is a Gun.

964395101127503872 2018-02-15 07:04:44 UTC <Ghostploegen> @car_nove Yea. And the NY truck attack was about the Truck, and 911 was about the airplane, and Texas college attack was about knives, and World Trade Center bombing was about the moving truck, and unibomber was about the mail, boston attack was about cookware.
964389933136793602 2018-02-15 06:44:12 UTC <Ghostploegen> @politico @chuckbrown0916 Indeed. Hey, great chatting with ya. Always good to talk to people who have ideas.
964388765815853057 2018-02-15 06:39:33 UTC <Ghostploegen> @politico @chuckbrown0916 True, but a presidential budget hasnt been passed by congress in years. Can even remember the last one. It may have been Clinton? So, im not to worried about that. Its why we have a CR battle every few months with the threat of a shutdown.
964386413365018625 2018-02-15 06:30:13 UTC <Ghostploegen> @politico @chuckbrown0916 Yep. Thats a bad call. It was Not all mentally ill but mentally Ill applying for social security. We need that back and mentally ill who are diagnosed by Doctors too.
964385246450933760 2018-02-15 06:25:34 UTC <Ghostploegen> @politico @chuckbrown0916 Arm them with any weapon and you get a bloodbath. Car, Bomb, Gun, doesnt matter. If they want to do mass harm, they will find a way. Happens all over the world everyday. But, we can protect our schools and children with property trained security.
964383409240813569 2018-02-15 06:18:16 UTC <Ghostploegen> @politico @chuckbrown0916 I am married to a psychologist and she would agree with you on the undiagnosed part. But, diagnosed mentally unhealthy people having access to Guns is insane. Access to Guns without training and license, crazy. Heavy security at a Bank but not a school, plain dumb.
964381269764194304 2018-02-15 06:09:46 UTC <Ghostploegen> @marcorubio @Alyssa_Milano @MarkRuffalo Do you honestly think blaming a single person is going to get you anywhere? Doing this kind of stuff your viewed as a hack and no one listens except people who think like you. If you want to change the world, offer a solution with compelling facts. Else, your just noise.
964378894185897984 2018-02-15 06:00:20 UTC <Ghostploegen> @politico @chuckbrown0916 for me, Until we have a discussion about Mental Health, Gun Access, Training, and security we are going nowhere. We are never getting rid of 500 million guns. We are never stopping people from becoming deranged. But, we could stop deranged people from getting guns!
964378793845579776 2018-02-15 05:59:56 UTC <Ghostploegen> @politico @chuckbrown0916 At least your honest and I appreciate that. Most of what I have read is focused on the AR15. I dont see many saying lets ban assault and hunting rifles. But, they are the same thing when it put in the wrong hands.

962485919201841152 2018-02-10 00:38:19 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill Has anyone heard of the 5th amendment? You need to defend it as one day you may need it too.
962481081307029504 2018-02-10 00:19:06 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @seanmack1025 Came from the American revolution when we declared in Declaration of Independence that we were establishing a new nation of United States. They would be self governed, have rights that no one could take away. Thus, we would abide by laws, have institutions who enforced those laws
962479802023317504 2018-02-10 00:14:01 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill Im told by the left that medical services is better elsewhere and free. So, this may be a good thing.
962479110432919552 2018-02-10 00:11:16 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @NancyPelosi has the opportunity to correct the security concerns and rerelease it. It is that simple.
962478271022673921 2018-02-10 00:07:56 UTC <Ghostploegen> @MSNBC And some see it as a opportunity for the security committee to fix it and send it back.
962477120961368064 2018-02-10 00:03:22 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill Earths Climate has changed for millions of years. I learned that in 5th grade geology class. It will change for millions more.
962472631789326337 2018-02-10 23:45:31 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @gwells1982 Where do you think it goes then ? It has to go somewhere. Bank? Then more money for loans. Stock buy back? Then stocks go up. Research and development? Then more products and jobs.
962471356049887232 2018-02-10 23:40:27 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill Good! And 77% will be invested and returned to share holder. Which is all of us.

962392061868740608 2018-02-10 18:25:22 UTC <Ghostploegen> @FoxNews The Republicans will solve this problem without the Dems. Thats ok, at least the problem will get fixed.
962391171111768066 2018-02-10 18:21:50 UTC <Ghostploegen> @realDonaldTrump @Alyssa_Milano Lynch mobs were disgusting then and they are just as  disgusting today.

962307840596725760 2018-02-10 12:50:42 UTC <Ghostploegen> @CNN @cnn Could you post this another 30 times. Not sure Ive seen it yet. Also, please get her a hairdresser. The droid look Is freaking me out!https://twitter.com/cnnpolitics/status/962303401202733056
962307033180590081 2018-02-10 12:47:30 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @andersoncooper ? Is he one of those guys that were on that thing called cable tv in the 90s? Think I read something about that on redit?
962306272421965824 2018-02-10 12:44:28 UTC <Ghostploegen> @TIME What is @Time ? Is that one of those things they called Magazines in the 80s?
962065572543348737 2018-02-09 20:48:01 UTC <Ghostploegen> @JoeBiden @ABCPolitics @ArletteSaenz Who know what we will see next. Maybe the president will use a intern as a humidor.
962064741676998657 2018-02-09 20:44:43 UTC <Ghostploegen> @ABC @JoeBiden No, its because we have a judicial system and its for determining guilt or innocence. You know how this works right?
962064129014943746 2018-02-09 20:42:17 UTC <Ghostploegen> @Lwbayfront @RepMattGaetz Now that it is confirmed, its simple. Thats against the law so quit tweeting and arrest someone.
962062764486230017 2018-02-09 20:36:51 UTC <Ghostploegen> @DanaBashCNN @oliverdarcy You know what the judicial branch of our government is for right? You know how this works, right?
961984733872906242 2018-02-09 15:26:48 UTC <Ghostploegen> Nope! he knows what the outcome is going to be and its not going to be good for the Dems. The only evidence we see piling up is on the Dems. emails, memos, dossier. the only people we see screaming is the Dems. Reminds me of the days when Bill C. turned a intern into a humidorhttps://twitter.com/rickklein/status/961979905461358595
961741338889916416 2018-02-08 23:19:38 UTC <Ghostploegen> @JoeNBC @MSNBC Trump didnt submit this budget either. You know how this works, right?
961740362950893569 2018-02-08 23:15:45 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill Pauls right. Time to come home. Lets go back to the good ole cruise missile days.
961720337602891778 2018-02-08 21:56:11 UTC <Ghostploegen> @MoveOn @NydiaVelazquez Let me get this straight. Your voting No on a spending bill because it doesnt have a fix for Immigration? You know Dems asked for a clean bill on immigration dont you?
961643484393304064 2018-02-08 16:50:47 UTC <Ghostploegen> @mitchellreports @MSNBC Thats because it doesnt function by manipulating the FBI    And Courts to spy on American citizens. @JoeBiden Strange isnt it?
961642640264585216 2018-02-08 16:47:26 UTC <Ghostploegen> @rickklein @ABCPolitics First, the committee is divided by design. Second, why did you vote Y on the Dem memo if its irreparable harm? Or, is it that it did irreparable harm to Dems that he is talking about ?
961641003206791175 2018-02-08 16:40:56 UTC <Ghostploegen> @CNNPolitics @MikeOwltiger I think the answer they give to your question is #BuildTheWall
961640594211835904 2018-02-08 16:39:18 UTC <Ghostploegen> @CNNPolitics Rep. Crowley, if you dont want them sent back then pass a law. Thats your job! Otherwise, we are a nation of laws and we shouldnt pick and choose which ones to enforce. You know how this works, Dont you ?
961419273624268800 2018-02-07 01:59:51 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill For two people having an affair. The sex must have been horrible if all they could text about is politics.

961304555999940609 2018-02-07 18:24:00 UTC <Ghostploegen> Isn't that something? All the Republicans voted YAY to release. On the FISA Memo, all the Dems voted NAY. Hum, I bet there is there there and the Republicans know it. My opinion, Collusion is real, and Mueller is going to find that it was also the HC Campaign that colluded.https://twitter.com/YossiGestetner/status/961300282469765125
961303162056531968 2018-02-07 18:18:28 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill I just feel out of my chair! Did @theHill just say the words, "Economy", "Credit" and "Trump" in the same sentence ?https://twitter.com/thehill/status/961300298391347202
961302228278661120 2018-02-07 18:14:46 UTC <Ghostploegen> WOW! guess the #ShumerShutdown was a real thing and not a Russia bot.https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/961300037333585922
961301342039019521 2018-02-07 18:11:14 UTC <Ghostploegen> Incorrect. He was charged and plead guilty of selling Cocaine . Nice try. http://www.fox32chicago.com/news/local/chicago-army-veteran-closer-to-deportation-after-losing-appealhttps://twitter.com/judynjshore/status/961184086420348928

960988548592754688 2018-02-06 21:28:18 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill So Dems voted AYE to release their memo and NAY to the Republican memo. Republicans vote AYE to release both memos.

960971489485971462 2018-02-06 20:20:31 UTC <Ghostploegen> Just because apple wrked hard doesnt make it worth 200 bucks more. This is the same way they lost the pc battle in the 80s. Priced themselves out of the market.https://twitter.com/forbes/status/960970104463921153
960969531589054464 2018-02-06 20:12:44 UTC <Ghostploegen> @YouTube @KyleKulinski @Peter30302273 He was convicted of drug dealing cocaine, discharged from the military, sentenced to 15 yrs and then a judge ordered him deported and his case is on appeal where the appeals court said deportation stands. And it happened under the Obama admin. So, be careful who you get behind.
960967876877410307 2018-02-06 20:06:10 UTC <Ghostploegen> @NBCPolitics @ShoNuf77 This I totally agree with !!!
960966599460220928 2018-02-06 20:01:05 UTC <Ghostploegen> @NBCPolitics He knows they have a #DemocraticRetreat this week and there is no way the Dems are going to #shumershutdown the Government and go party.
960963015234420740 2018-02-06 19:46:51 UTC <Ghostploegen> @frankthorp Yep. #shumershutdown then watch them go on #DemocraticRetreat and party. nice optics there. not as stupid as you wish he was.

960954901009399809 2018-02-06 19:14:36 UTC <Ghostploegen> @YouTube @KyleKulinski Thanks OBAMA administration !
960953650129588225 2018-02-06 19:09:38 UTC <Ghostploegen> @rickjnewman Yes! Absolutely!! That is exactly her / their job! 
960946558324871168 2018-02-06 18:41:27 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @oaklandzoo22 Steele was not an intelligence officer was he? No. So, how can a non-intelligence officer create an intelligence report? Thats like a retired Dr giving you a diagnosis wothout examining you.
960944750235930625 2018-02-06 18:34:16 UTC <Ghostploegen> @rickjnewman Im glad she was bitter if she was. So was I.  Use to be my bank. Not now!
960943430796005376 2018-02-06 18:29:02 UTC <Ghostploegen> @oaklandzoo22 @CapehartJ Or to collude with a foreign government (steele) to effect our election.
960943085684494336 2018-02-06 18:27:39 UTC <Ghostploegen> @oaklandzoo22 @CapehartJ Or to create a fake intelligence report, or to lie to FBI, or to spy on American citizens, or to provide false evidence to a court. Now your straight.
960942360929751040 2018-02-06 18:24:46 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @oaklandzoo22 There is no collusion acceptable in our elections. Building a fake intelligence report shows malicious intent to interfere. Our government is built on the principle of we the people decide how we are governed. Regardless of who wins.
960930137440124930 2018-02-06 17:36:12 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill Fact: Dems colluded with a Foreign agent(steele) to create a false intelligence report , lied to and gave it to FBI to get a FISA warrant(which is a false evidence crime) and spied on a Republican(a violation of his rights). And did it all to undermine our elections.
960927870825783297 2018-02-06 17:27:12 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @ScottNGibbs No worries. Thought it was a great idea.
960927449067458564 2018-02-06 17:25:31 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill Dems, how dare you lecture Anyone about treason when your team met with British agents to effect our election
960924075819520005 2018-02-06 17:12:07 UTC <Ghostploegen> @DaShanneStokes You have evidence you fighter for justice ? #partoftheproblem
960922272860114944 2018-02-06 17:04:57 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @oaklandzoo22 For me that meeting is no different than Hillarys team meeting with Steele, (who is a foreign agent ).  Both looking for campaign dirt. Maybe both Hillary and DT colluded with foreign governments to affect or elections?
960920727464611840 2018-02-06 16:58:49 UTC <Ghostploegen> @ABCPolitics Treason: The crime of betraying one's country, especially by attempting to kill the sovereign or overthrow the government. #TheResistance
960919701219106817 2018-02-06 16:54:44 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @Fasteagle101 Because Illegals are Dreamers and Americans are Deplorables. We learned that from them in 2016.
960919313875197952 2018-02-06 16:53:12 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill How can you condemn someone who wants our laws to be enforced? If you dont like the law, change the law. You can pick and choose which laws we obey.
960918525413085184 2018-02-06 16:50:04 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @oaklandzoo22 Very good point! If true. And it also ends the collusion point to if true.
960917664922324993 2018-02-06 16:46:38 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @ShyMikey Did you find them ?
960917569468289024 2018-02-06 16:46:16 UTC <Ghostploegen> Yea found this too. Doesnt say he spoke to DT. 1000s of people have been in meetings and not spoken. Im starting to wonder if this guy is telling the truth?https://twitter.com/onekewljen/status/960914342437793792
960916867417300995 2018-02-06 16:43:28 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @TylerAKing So you have evidence of this ? Would love to see it.
960916640291540992 2018-02-06 16:42:34 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @ScottNGibbs Interesting thought, so i did a little searching. Found Nothing.
960915615463739393 2018-02-06 16:38:30 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill If this is true then the Russia dialog starts breaking down fast for the Dems and it becomes the Dems birther moment.
960912721737928706 2018-02-06 16:27:00 UTC <Ghostploegen> @Comey You selling a book? On ethics!  . All this turmoil has been so you could make millions on a book ? Seriously?
960911786571640832 2018-02-06 16:23:17 UTC <Ghostploegen> In that case we absolutely need a merit based system!! Thanks for the info!https://twitter.com/robferdman/status/960910782778236928

960730932675317760 2018-02-05 04:24:38 UTC <Ghostploegen> @WSJ He is going to find all kinds of stuff! Unfortunately or fortunately, we are going to see the Dems perp walked. Thats why they are making so much noise. Havent seen this much noise since Bill used a intern as a humidor.
960728907761770497 2018-02-05 04:16:35 UTC <Ghostploegen> The facts just hurt!https://twitter.com/jackposobiec/status/960727211031527425

960722591760691200 2018-02-05 03:51:29 UTC <Ghostploegen> @chuckwoolery I have a feeling that the Mueller is going to find things Hillary is not going to like. Thats why the Dems and Her are screaming so loud. Same thing happened when her husband used a young intern as a humidor.
960721259595206657 2018-02-05 03:46:12 UTC <Ghostploegen> @CNNPolitics Whats hers platform? Let take more money from you and put you on unemployment ?
960718833513361409 2018-02-05 03:36:33 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @RobJamesSC Before you put up a Fake Tweet, just know it is spelled Dow Jones. Not Dow Joans.
960717188255617024 2018-02-05 03:30:01 UTC <Ghostploegen> @MSNBC @MaddowBlog @ajbrodhun Which is clear obstruction by a foreign government in our elections. But to these people, that is the good kind of obstruction? Just plain Crazy !
960715715618787329 2018-02-05 03:24:10 UTC <Ghostploegen> @MSNBC It clearly has got to be frustrating @MaddowBlog that she has lied so much that no one believes her scandals anymore.  Thats why she hasnt derailed anything.
960714174274916352 2018-02-05 03:18:03 UTC <Ghostploegen> @CNNPolitics I say lets do another #shumershutdown and then watch the Dems go to the #DemocraticRetreat and party.
960692798247915520 2018-02-05 01:53:06 UTC <Ghostploegen> I say, #ShumerShutdown and then #DemocraticRetreathttps://twitter.com/cnn/status/960692277151784960

What did they know? When did they know it? Need to ask some tough hitting questions. Where is @Acosta when you need him?
960680710762848256 2018-02-05 01:05:04 UTC <Ghostploegen> @CNN @TerryMartinNSV They did. Many people thought it was an act of terror from isis and @cnn was quick to point out that he was not.
960679954425040902 2018-02-05 01:02:04 UTC <Ghostploegen> @CNN @mrkhamp Maybe because The 2 Laws that were in place to protect Mr Jacksons right to pursue happiness failed Him. Its about the driver shouldnt of had the opportunity because the 1st Law was violated. It is the reason we have laws.

960666459428057088 2018-02-05 00:08:26 UTC <Ghostploegen> @CNNPolitics Not Trump when it goes up 31%. Is Trump when it goes down 4%. Where is the logic in that ?
960665190705573889 2018-02-05 00:03:24 UTC <Ghostploegen> @CNN On sale baby!! Who hoo!
960664934001594369 2018-02-05 00:02:23 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill My prediction is we are going to find out that the Russians and other governments had both candidates/ parties by the  and that is why everyone is screaming so loud with little to no evidence. They know the outcome and we the folks have no honest media to hash it all out.
960660049080315904 2018-02-05 23:42:58 UTC <Ghostploegen> @CNBC @mmurraypolitics @kompromat666 @Ronaldraygun84 Yep! Things are on sale ! That is a good thing. Just like having a sale at your local retailer, good time to buy the sale. Has happened over 100s of years. Will happen again. Its called investing.

960587802307186688 2018-02-05 18:55:53 UTC <Ghostploegen> Depends on the assult type and location of the assult. But yes, there are laws both state and federal that cover assault.https://twitter.com/benzellouden/status/960585898185256960
960586336880201733 2018-02-05 18:50:04 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill Why take it down? i thought the LGBT person did a great job and his/her views should be heard. Why silence him/her?
960584840595824641 2018-02-05 18:44:07 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @BenzelLouden Already a crime. Inciting violence is a crime .
960584337040265216 2018-02-05 18:42:07 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill Need a Law when we already have assault Laws on the books? How about learn the Law and enforce the law? Makes you look stupid when you try to make laws we already have.
960581744327086080 2018-02-05 18:31:49 UTC <Ghostploegen> @calebparke @FoxNews Would be my last day in that class and probably university.  it would be clear indication im not getting a good education from this school as Trump has nothing to do with science studies. Take the money away and professors cant play.
960580278585610241 2018-02-05 18:25:59 UTC <Ghostploegen> @mmurraypolitics So, up 31% and down 3% and i am supposed to think that the 31% was not Trump and the down 3% is?  Im smarter than that.
960578568450428928 2018-02-05 18:19:12 UTC <Ghostploegen> @Forbes @itsurankit Great news for Investors, sad news for sellers. Great news for buyers.
960578261020487680 2018-02-05 18:17:58 UTC <Ghostploegen> @Forbes Why does no one try to figure why prices at the grocery store drop or consider a problem. But, stocks go on sale and Katie bar the door. If you think its never going back up then sale, if you dont then things are on sale and buy!
960576470430121984 2018-02-05 18:10:51 UTC <Ghostploegen> @APCentralRegion @Paulnetx @theaterOFpain1 Sorry!! I hit the wrong button! My bad!
960576171380543489 2018-02-05 18:09:40 UTC <Ghostploegen> @JackPosobiec Because they are in full panic mode. I saw this same thing in the 90s when Bill Clinton used an intern as a humidor but was saying he didnt abuse any of the women accusing him of abuse.
960575265586937858 2018-02-05 18:06:04 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @WinslowRachelKa Ok. If you cant educate yourself and be a free thinker with facts then be that puppet.

960554791658295296 2018-02-05 16:44:43 UTC <Ghostploegen> Wonder why. Maybe, just maybe, the dems used the organization against Republicans a by forming a KGB type gov?

960539886829875201 2018-02-05 15:45:29 UTC <Ghostploegen> Of course hes not. Trump is playing you and once the Mueller investigation is complete hes going make you look like fools.

959921906903330816 2018-02-03 22:49:51 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill Oh yea, and it was produced to interfere with our elections! Scary stuff!
959921124552343554 2018-02-03 22:46:45 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill Fact: a document produced by a foreign national, Steele, was used by FBI to get a FISA warrant to breach the rights of an American citizen. Regardless of the feelings for that citizen, that is scary stuff and regardless of the feelings for FBI that is scary stuff.
959917704277843970 2018-02-03 22:33:09 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @GeriBAnderson Thats good to know. Thanks for the chat.
959861500419690497 2018-02-03 18:49:49 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @GeriBAnderson Hope your right. The article said, GSA spokeswoman Pam Dixon told CNN that employees are allowed their own discretion in choosing travel and meal arrangements while on business trips.
959844421415198720 2018-02-03 17:41:57 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill Headline correction: Gov lets employees decide how much they can spend on travel. .... WTF? Seriously, does anyone work for a company that does that?
959842958454480896 2018-02-03 17:36:08 UTC <Ghostploegen> @washingtonpost @imwithzer Fact: Steele, a foreign agent, colluded with someone to effect our election. Is the FBI innocent bystanders ? IDK? But, I know we will all know in due time.
959841257035051009 2018-02-03 17:29:23 UTC <Ghostploegen> @washingtonpost If nothing happened then they have nothing to worry about. If it did happen then lasting damage is what is due.
959835722084646912 2018-02-03 17:07:23 UTC <Ghostploegen> @CNNPolitics Who the hell cares? A comedian want say the presidents name is now political news? My pet dog want say his name either. Who cares?
959835304843792387 2018-02-03 17:05:44 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill A Grand Jury brought these charges. They will be brought before a Judge and heard. If the Judge thinks there is no case based on the evidence the the charges will be dropped. The system works and we should let it work.
959833808836194304 2018-02-03 16:59:47 UTC <Ghostploegen> @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @pbump @ColinJacobson1 I hear ya! They all use this tactic to divide us as a people so they can hold on to power. We are in a bad situation when we have this vs that, color vs color, sex vs sex. Income vs income. Its happened before in our history. Wasnt good!
959829458139189248 2018-02-03 16:42:30 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill Please dont celebrate an increase in black or any unemployment ! We all are Americans and thats just not right!
959828394543378432 2018-02-03 16:38:16 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill Does this remind anyone of the Obama birthers? It totally looks that way to me.
959826796807184386 2018-02-03 16:31:55 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill There is one fact that is disgusting! Steele, a foreign agent, colluded with someone to effect our elections.
959825228238082049 2018-02-03 16:25:41 UTC <Ghostploegen> Its not they! Its we the people! And its not all we have! We have a serious problem with our government. Not sides, but the whole thing!

My thought is we are focused on things like this and it takes away from really scary issues that we have with our government as a whole. And i fear thats what the parties want us to do! Fight amongst ourselves over this stuff.
959812504691134464 2018-02-03 15:35:08 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill Ghostplow: our gov is broken!!
959812285203070976 2018-02-03 15:34:15 UTC <Ghostploegen> Steele, a foreign agent, was absolutely colluding to effect our election. These are facts! That is obvious to me. Does that bother anyone?https://twitter.com/pbump/status/959811369217544193

We have huge problems in our government and this crap is just noise in the system. Is anyone happy with our government and how it is functioning? Any part?
959809925470965762 2018-02-03 15:24:53 UTC <Ghostploegen> @jamiedupree I wouldnt say vindicated. But I would say it raises eyebrows and puts into question whether there is a huge scary problem with our gov. I trust your reporting and know you will figure all this out for us.

959469180801216520 2018-02-02 16:50:53 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill @USCentrist So your argument is that given everyone the same deduction is discrimination to high tax states, then i would guess that given preference to high tax states under the old law would be discrimination against low tax states too?
959468214588706816 2018-02-02 16:47:03 UTC <Ghostploegen> @thehill Go ahead, waist Marylands tax money. The law is pretty clear here on who has the right to tax its citizens. If caping the rate is Illegal then having SALT deduction at all is illegal too. Not going to fly.

955177461687480327 2018-01-21 20:37:07 UTC <Ghostploegen> Not my argument at all. It was yours. Mine was that the island was formed and changes over time due to coastal erosion. Allways has allways will. You brought the moon to the discussion. More info for ya. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_erosionhttps://twitter.com/dbmain/status/955068383766237184
955176095191633920 2018-01-21 20:31:42 UTC <Ghostploegen> If you recall, it was your hypothesis that the moon was stationary.  You asked the question I answered. If you want to learn about how sand islands change due to coastal erosion over time, my point, then there are plenty of great sites to do so.https://twitter.com/dbmain/status/955067665369968643

954720412780417024 2018-01-20 14:20:58 UTC <Ghostploegen> @nytimes Tidal erosion does change the shape and size of an island which was formed originally by tidal erosion over millions of years of Climate variations. Has happened, will always happen, happens everywhere, and caused by the moon and gravitational pull.
