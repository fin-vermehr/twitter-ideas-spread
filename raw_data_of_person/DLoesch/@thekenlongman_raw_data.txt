When used to attack people then it's an assault weapon. When a car is driven into a crowd of people it's an assault weapon.

Show me a salesman that will let a psycho carry a gun out of the store. And your argument is tired. Guns are made for hunting, recreation, and protection. And are regulated. People caught using them illegaly are punished.

966466905400905733 2018-02-21 00:17:20 UTC <thekenlongman> @KenTremendous You are correct. Every school should put up way more gun free signs. That way these psycho's will stop shooting up schools cause they will now know it's illegal to have a gun on school property

964547156211392514 2018-02-16 17:08:57 UTC <thekenlongman> @cuppingmaster It wasn't fine. It's a group of people here illegaly. Also he didn't cut the program and deport them. He signed an order to eliminate the program and then told Congress to find a better way. And it's the Dems who are fighting it.

964137208834936838 2018-02-15 13:59:58 UTC <thekenlongman> @dannykanell @TonyBajorek1 Arming teachers is a deterrent, and logical
964137101326540800 2018-02-15 13:59:32 UTC <thekenlongman> @dannykanell @TonyBajorek1 Not much, felons can't buy or own guns legally, (there's your background check) I agree anyone with a mental disorder also shouldn't have a gun. I have no idea what a multi-round magazine is. They are all multi-round.  Thing is, bad people are going to do bad things.
964134373326016512 2018-02-15 13:48:42 UTC <thekenlongman> @dannykanell @TonyBajorek1 And what new gun laws would you propose?
964129093020209152 2018-02-15 13:27:43 UTC <thekenlongman> @dannykanell @TonyBajorek1 Absolutely. It's already used by schools in multiple states. I think it should be mandatory.
964120785655947266 2018-02-15 12:54:42 UTC <thekenlongman> @EthanRKassel That's about as accurate as saying the door company that put the doors on the school are to blame cause they didn't stop the kid.  How about put blame where it goes The school administration for not being prepared This kids parents  Or how about the little psycho who did this?
964118361180385281 2018-02-15 12:45:04 UTC <thekenlongman> @dannykanell The most logical solution is to arm a teacher or principal. And then advertise it. These people are cowards. They aren't going into a place where someone is gonna shoot back.

961337078888980486 2018-02-07 20:33:15 UTC <thekenlongman> @jhoeck As far as being a star goes that's not fair to evaluate. How many guys were 3 or 4 star recruits who turned into a star their jr year because they developed that season. Doesnt mean the evaluation was wrong.
961336224312119296 2018-02-07 20:29:51 UTC <thekenlongman> @jhoeck I wouldn't say that. There are a lot of people who's livelihood depends on ranking these players. I'll agree it's not an exact science but as a fan wouldn't you rather your team have a top 10 class vs a class somewhere in the 40's?
961334660361084928 2018-02-07 20:23:38 UTC <thekenlongman> @jhoeck I'd rank kids vs the rest of the kids in their own state then by position nationally. And I'd rank the classes by which teams signed the best players.

958345184575676417 2018-01-30 14:24:31 UTC <thekenlongman> @ClementiNick @EthanRKassel The #'s don't add up to have 2 of these guys much less 3 of them break camp. Alcantara skillset is just redundant with those 2 guys. I just don't see Hendricks or casilla being cut before the season starts which bumps pagan down to AAA.
958208446175875072 2018-01-29 05:21:10 UTC <thekenlongman> @ClementiNick @EthanRKassel That will be petit's role to start the season.
958205712714354688 2018-01-29 05:10:19 UTC <thekenlongman> @ClementiNick Pending trades it's what's gonna happen. Hendricks and casilla are owed alot of money to not give them a chance out of the gate. Obviously trienen, coulombe, Petit, buchter, and Hatcher are locks. Dull and pagan have options. Alcantara is just the odd man out. Maybe he clears?

948944723561021440 2018-01-04 15:50:27 UTC <thekenlongman> @squidsportshead @TheRaiderRamble I'd cut Penn, crab, lynch, Smith, and amerson. Conley will step in as a starter. If they can't find one on the market then I guess obi can start opposite? Draft mcglinchy x4, scrap heap a wr to go with Cooper, cp, and holton. More looks for Walford in the passing game?

948703417962237954 2018-01-03 23:51:35 UTC <thekenlongman> @elilibby @cuppingmaster Oh ok. Yeah that makes sense. To me triggs is low risk high reward. If he's good then great, if not we have guys coming
948683418153385984 2018-01-03 22:32:07 UTC <thekenlongman> @elilibby @cuppingmaster Umm what? The story of his career is shut down reliever. The A's converted him to a starter due to lack of sp depth. He put up all-star #'s in his first 16 starts. (Sub 3.00 era) then a June hip injury and eventually surgery ended his season.
948679628843028480 2018-01-03 22:17:03 UTC <thekenlongman> @cuppingmaster @elilibby He is an injury risk but the guy had a cy caliber April, a good may, and 2 disasterous starts in June where you could chalk up to injury.

948568124860895233 2018-01-03 14:53:59 UTC <thekenlongman> @cuppingmaster @ThatBootlegGuy @EthanRKassel I gotta disagree. He was very good in 15 but has been awful the last 2 years since his injury. Even in AAA he wasnt very impressive.
948566649644503040 2018-01-03 14:48:07 UTC <thekenlongman> @cuppingmaster @elilibby Triggs has been good when on the mound. He reminds me soooooooo much of Justin duchscherer. Hahn needs alot of help to make the team. Either way both guys are just warm bodies until puk and Holmes/fillmeyer are ready.
948368282809225217 2018-01-02 01:39:53 UTC <thekenlongman> @Erik_Bartlett Exactly. Just give Iran and n.korea billions of dollars like the Clinton's and obama
948367161361403904 2018-01-02 01:35:25 UTC <thekenlongman> @cuppingmaster I'm assuming that with you thinking pagan was a rotation option that your probably just a casual fan. So......FYI 5 of the top 10 prospects are starting pitchers. Puk Kaprielian Lazardo Holmes Shore The future is definitely bright my friend. Just gotta be paitent for 1 more year.
948301805255102465 2018-01-02 21:15:43 UTC <thekenlongman> @cuppingmaster For sure Manaea Graveman Inside track Triggs Blackburn Mengden In the hunt Cotton Gossett Longshot  Hahn

945646619676106752 2017-12-26 13:24:58 UTC <thekenlongman> @Obee1ne @thetwilightsown Hard to compete when you have to scramble before you finish your drop back. Plus when you do find an open wr there is no guarantee the ball will be caught. I'd be skiddish too.
945643222809874433 2017-12-26 13:11:28 UTC <thekenlongman> @PGutierrezESPN Downing and Carr have combined for 0 drops and 0 missed blocking assignments. The 2 biggest problems the raiders have dealt with this season.
945606064313196545 2017-12-26 10:43:48 UTC <thekenlongman> @timweaver_9 @MarcusMarsden I'm sure his back won't be broken next season. Hopefully raiders sign a wr or 3 capable of catching the ball
945522977881411585 2017-12-25 05:13:39 UTC <thekenlongman> @RAIDERCODY_ @zzRAIDERSzz No time to throw + all the drops.
945521525800820737 2017-12-25 05:07:53 UTC <thekenlongman> @elilibby I don't care if a guy is black, white, blue, green, or purple. Raiders need a pair of tackles who can block.
945516789374562304 2017-12-25 04:49:04 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter @Raider_510_ Carr and downing combined for 0 dropped passes this year.
945516465469509632 2017-12-25 04:47:46 UTC <thekenlongman> @SithRaider Raiders Twitter blaming Carr for not throwing deep. Has had 0 time.
945516113420521472 2017-12-25 04:46:22 UTC <thekenlongman> That was in response to other raider fans saying Carr cost them the game and he only throws checkdowns.

933360521935405056 2017-11-22 15:44:24 UTC <thekenlongman> @StillRyanFive It's simple math, 6 blockers vs raiders front 4. Nobody else is a pass rusher so use your extra 2 guys to stop the top threat.

933058607876259840 2017-11-21 19:44:42 UTC <thekenlongman> @oakclubhouse @roddster510 Bassitt will most likely start in AAA, alcantara in MLB pen and triggs and mengden in MLB rotation behind Blackburn, manaea, and graveman

933056139570249728 2017-11-21 19:34:53 UTC <thekenlongman> @roddster510 @oakclubhouse And montas has a much higher ceiling than dull. TBH unless they trade someone I don't see the A's adding anybody to the pen.
933055699998818305 2017-11-21 19:33:08 UTC <thekenlongman> @roddster510 @oakclubhouse I just can't see the A's eating casilla's salary. He's a decent reliever and Hatcher was solid for the A's after the trade. 3.52 era
933051597524934656 2017-11-21 19:16:50 UTC <thekenlongman> @bruggy4 @AlexHallAN Wouldn't put it past beane trading him for one of those other fringe type guys

933042707643039744 2017-11-21 18:41:31 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter Season ain't over. 5 very winnable games left. Hard to see the chiefs going 4-2 down the stretch

932700877164462080 2017-11-20 20:03:12 UTC <thekenlongman> @StillRyanFive @Dan905 The raiders don't have good enough lb's/db's to not blitz. Huge difference for coverage if you have to defend for 3 seconds vs 5+
932698224397185024 2017-11-20 19:52:40 UTC <thekenlongman> @StillRyanFive @Dan905 Raiders almost refuse to blitz. Wich makes life super easy for olinemen and qb's.

930162543707877376 2017-11-13 19:56:46 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter TBH, the offense has looked better since some of Cooper's looks have gone to cook.

930158417095704576 2017-11-13 19:40:22 UTC <thekenlongman> @AustinGayle_PFF Hi, I kept saying it, his struggles were do to scheme not talent. When Antonio brown abused him ben always had 5-6 seconds.

930156545756749824 2017-11-13 19:32:56 UTC <thekenlongman> @notElizabethNJ I  your take on things, I am no fan of kap and I don't think he belongs in the NFL. However, he has put his $ where his mouth is.

927982234933403649 2017-11-07 19:33:00 UTC <thekenlongman> @MattSnyderCBS I have another great idea for pace of play in MLB. 25 man roster but only 18 active per game. = Less moves and counter moves

927582581264080897 2017-11-06 17:04:55 UTC <thekenlongman> @cuppingmaster To be clear. I'd love to have Cobb. I just don't see him coming to Oakland. If beane is going to improve the rotation it will be a trade.
927570676923351040 2017-11-06 16:17:37 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter @A_Flawed_King Have to beat den, sd, nyg. 2-2 in other 4 puts us at 9-7. I think they need 10 wins. So gotta steal one
927569963891568645 2017-11-06 16:14:47 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter Hard to say raiders are on life support. They are in the thick of things. Tough schedule ahead but if they can't win those.....done anyways.
927568866095513600 2017-11-06 16:10:25 UTC <thekenlongman> @cuppingmaster Id rather the A's use that $ to lock up the Matt's through their arby years
927568437848678400 2017-11-06 16:08:43 UTC <thekenlongman> @cuppingmaster There will be plenty of offers for him. Unless the A's blow the doors off any other offer there is no chance he picks Oakland.
927565047026421761 2017-11-06 15:55:15 UTC <thekenlongman> @cuppingmaster Hi, I'm Alex Cobb arguably one of the best pitchers on the market.....I'm not signing with a last place team unless their offer is 2x better
927536950923296768 2017-11-06 14:03:36 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter Raiders are 1 game back of playoff spot and own tiebreaker over Titans

927384450589003776 2017-11-05 03:57:37 UTC <thekenlongman> Pass dropped by Cooper then Crabtree. This is why we can't have nice things

926163355546501120 2017-11-02 19:05:25 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter time to think positively....raiders need to just win baby and finish better than Baltimore to make playoffs. 7-1 possible?
926161053410455557 2017-11-02 18:56:17 UTC <thekenlongman> @AlexHallAN @The_Willager The reason I say 0 is wendle and Nunez are out of options. Any fa signing virtually ends them. Plenty of stopgaps in system to get 2 murphy

926147228053356544 2017-11-02 18:01:20 UTC <thekenlongman> @AlexHallAN My bold prediction is the A's sign 0 mlb free agents. I see trading for a reliever or 2. Alot of sp depth in minors will let guys move up.

923674536721072128 2017-10-26 22:15:45 UTC <thekenlongman> @thekuhlest I'm unreasonable? Your calling someone you know very little about an idiot and claiming he's running the u.s. into the ground w/no evidence.
923673845520777216 2017-10-26 22:13:00 UTC <thekenlongman> @thekuhlest Economy is up 3% since election vs 2% the previous 8 years. Paid out unemplymnt benefits are at a 40 year low. Keep drinking the hateraid.
923672002598072321 2017-10-26 22:05:41 UTC <thekenlongman> @thekuhlest Lol, he's neither an idiot or running the country into the ground. I'll give you he's a poor public speaker.
923670981578600448 2017-10-26 22:01:37 UTC <thekenlongman> @thekuhlest Well, that never occurred to me as an option. 
923669441749032961 2017-10-26 21:55:30 UTC <thekenlongman> @thekuhlest It's literally like your life evolves around president Trump and finding anything negative you can say about him. Just an awful way to live.

922170255341862913 2017-10-22 18:38:16 UTC <thekenlongman> @DeeDub67 Again, you stand for the anthem and kneel before god
922170121434447872 2017-10-22 18:37:44 UTC <thekenlongman> @DeeDub67 And since kneeling and sitting during the national anthem is considered disrespectful, Carr did nothing wrong while his teammates did.

920394231352455173 2017-10-17 21:00:59 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter Maybe show Cooper how to catch the football. I'm sure that will solve alot of problems

920073019761967104 2017-10-16 23:44:36 UTC <thekenlongman> @NickHjeltness The team made a political statement, got dropkicked in the mouth and hasn't been the same. Top playmaker has disappeared.

918085008773980160 2017-10-11 12:04:57 UTC <thekenlongman> @Espngreeny recently nfl players have beaten women & kids, murdered, sexually assulted women. Hard 2 care about their stance on pd brutality
917166884830580736 2017-10-08 23:16:40 UTC <thekenlongman> @raiderlarry @machoman1988 Defense gave up 23 points. Only 6 in the second half. The offense with or without Carr looks bad at all positions.
917164906507415552 2017-10-08 23:08:48 UTC <thekenlongman> @raiderlarry Cooper is currently an embarrassment. Team not even looking to get him the ball anymore.

915411838103195648 2017-10-03 03:02:44 UTC <thekenlongman> Wow, the irony in this tweet. Americans can get guns due to the 2nd amendment. The bill of rights was drafted after we declared Independencehttps://twitter.com/goodoldcatchy/status/914832764179931136
915410108753915904 2017-10-03 02:55:52 UTC <thekenlongman> @vickyvarias Nope, paper towels. You can clearly see it in the picture.

915248919268831232 2017-10-03 16:15:21 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaiderMarston It's hard for me to say anything about downing at this point. Carr was missing on his throws and the line has been garbage. Not all on him.
915244712172314624 2017-10-03 15:58:38 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaiderMarston X-factor.....raiders will be at home. Money lynch gon b dancin
915244538666541056 2017-10-03 15:57:57 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaiderMarston On paper the raiders are better than both in the trenches, raiders have better playmakers. Without Carr those 2 are better at qb. Dbs - wash
915243508834869248 2017-10-03 15:53:51 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaiderMarston He should be serviceable which puts it on the rest of the team to play better vs inferior opponents.
915240422036840448 2017-10-03 15:41:35 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaiderMarston Ej was 8-8 vs Denver before cook and amari got the dropsies
915240322212413440 2017-10-03 15:41:11 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaiderMarston 2 top tier defenses did that vs mcgloin and cook. Baltimore and San Diego are not top tier defenses.
915235508925612032 2017-10-03 15:22:04 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersAnalysis @TheAthleticSF Idk if it's in the story but for me it's 2 easy fixes. Give Richard more touches. 7-10 per game Stop running the read option with lynch
915233918273560576 2017-10-03 15:15:44 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaiderMarston Ej Manuel > mcgloin/cook 2016 Denver/Houston >>>>2017 Baltimore/LA chargers. Both are big differences
915219111986073600 2017-10-03 14:16:54 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter a concerning stat for me  Jalen Richard in raiders 2 losses -  6 touches for 35 yards In the 2 wins - 14 for 137 #freeJalen
914958563096662016 2017-10-02 21:01:35 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser Bummers
914955156428439552 2017-10-02 20:48:02 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser Oh yes good point. Any chance he makes the team then as something like the 5th of'er? I feel like he won't have much trade value.
914950672151220225 2017-10-02 20:30:13 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser Possible that they could move Healy to keep Nunez? Virtually same player. Rh power bat but somewhat limited defensively. Rn has more control
914945234332553216 2017-10-02 20:08:37 UTC <thekenlongman> @AthleticsDebate You strongly disagree because of 71 sporadic ab's? Lol ok. He had 27 bb's in 111 games in AAA yet still posted a near 800 ops.
914935971551920128 2017-10-02 19:31:48 UTC <thekenlongman> @AthleticsDebate Really? Isn't close? He's a 21 year old who hit .290 with 15 home runs in AAA. He led the team in hitting.
914934426550681600 2017-10-02 19:25:40 UTC <thekenlongman> @AthleticsDebate You kill his trade value if you commit to barreto right now
914934190247862272 2017-10-02 19:24:44 UTC <thekenlongman> @AthleticsDebate It's not the point. Teams obviously know about barreto. So if they want lowrie then the A's are gonna make them pay.
914931723992915968 2017-10-02 19:14:56 UTC <thekenlongman> @AthleticsDebate I know what they said but what I heard was "we aren't letting him go for free. Make us a decent offer."
914884153341915136 2017-10-02 16:05:54 UTC <thekenlongman> @realDonaldTrump It's truly sad that when you tweet your sorrow for others people use it as an excuse to attack you. Keep doing you Mr. President. #MAGA

913216264926982145 2017-09-27 01:38:18 UTC <thekenlongman> @Only1Nation_ @NickHjeltness I believe Richard should be starting. He's much more explosive than bm. Allows bm to be fresh in 4th qtr. Your thoughts?

912748353036808192 2017-09-26 18:39:00 UTC <thekenlongman> @devinpangaro Gossett is a rookie. Didn't mengden have the same problem his rookie year?
912747881601261568 2017-09-26 18:37:07 UTC <thekenlongman> @vincebaseball Sad
912371514120404992 2017-09-25 17:41:34 UTC <thekenlongman> @AlexHallAN Puk was considered by many the top player in the draft. What luck he fell to us
912356502869962752 2017-09-25 16:41:55 UTC <thekenlongman> @NBCSRaiders They kept it up throughout the game also
912355693264494592 2017-09-25 16:38:42 UTC <thekenlongman> @AlexHallAN All flops
912355643989753856 2017-09-25 16:38:30 UTC <thekenlongman> @AlexHallAN And for all of those lower first Rd guys to succeed let's just look at recent #1 picks by OAK. Weeks, Simmons, green, even Billy McKinney
912350988702433280 2017-09-25 16:20:01 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter But honestly. Much of the team looked satisfied with their pre-game statement and showed nothing on the field - a few defenders esp. cowser
912350740106010626 2017-09-25 16:19:01 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter Long list obviously. Carr looked like he was on skates the whole night cause of pressure. Cooper and  dropping balls. Poor scheme.
912349775516667904 2017-09-25 16:15:11 UTC <thekenlongman> @AlexHallAN Not once in my life have I cared where the A's draft. Whomever they get is 2-3 years (Tops) from getting to the bigs. It's not the nfl.
912269448777654273 2017-09-25 10:56:00 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter Because not everyone shares your beliefs and your using your platform in an angry threatening way and resorting to ef yous and name calling
912147457852661760 2017-09-24 02:51:15 UTC <thekenlongman> @WillReeveJr @TheRaidersWire And during the game

912140304056147968 2017-09-24 02:22:49 UTC <thekenlongman> @SithRaider I'm certainly not wondering that. It's obvious
912140030922997760 2017-09-24 02:21:44 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter Wow name calling? That's below you guy.
912138964496146432 2017-09-24 02:17:30 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter Based on what? Letting Jennifer Hudson stay in his hotel after her family was murdered? I guess that qualifies. ORRRR because cnn told you?
912127234080571392 2017-09-24 01:30:53 UTC <thekenlongman> I've stayed on the side of Sean Smith longer than anyone. That was embarrassing

912116726342361088 2017-09-24 00:49:08 UTC <thekenlongman> @JtESPN991 Nope. Just devisive actions from millionaires complaining about oppression.
912115223514963968 2017-09-24 00:43:10 UTC <thekenlongman> Maybe should have been more worried about football than making a political statement @RAIDERS

911658100771274752 2017-09-23 18:26:43 UTC <thekenlongman> @joedawg49 The divide was created by Obama and driven in so far nobody was getting us out. Hillary or Trump. Agree/disagree?
911618877938819073 2017-09-23 15:50:52 UTC <thekenlongman> @joedawg49 I think he's doing a great job. He has alot of work to do righting the wrongs of Obama. If you can't see that your clearly blind
911615854126624768 2017-09-23 15:38:51 UTC <thekenlongman> @joedawg49 Based on what? What cnn tells you?

911310698772283392 2017-09-22 19:26:16 UTC <thekenlongman> @NickHjeltness Brilliant to use him in the backfield. Lb's scared of him to get to the edge opened up the middle.
910966083288408064 2017-09-21 20:36:53 UTC <thekenlongman> @Hales6ix @JFloe408 I'm personally not worried bout him
910961454324490240 2017-09-21 20:18:30 UTC <thekenlongman> @Hales6ix @JFloe408 Considering Carr has 8-9 legit weapons I'd imagine they can just ignore him and carve up weaker areas

910605056763760640 2017-09-20 20:42:18 UTC <thekenlongman> @AthleticsDebate 6-3 road trip....who is this team?
910604482811015168 2017-09-20 20:40:01 UTC <thekenlongman> @ClementiNick 10 games left and still not eliminated from wild card race
910532123659976704 2017-09-20 15:52:29 UTC <thekenlongman> @Tony_Frye I'm keeping hope they don't get to 90 losses
910530263662264321 2017-09-20 15:45:06 UTC <thekenlongman> @AthleticsDebate Nay, the A's will be better next year but I don't see Jed being a part of the team in 2-3 years. Let's let barreto take his lumps next year.
910529997500067840 2017-09-20 15:44:02 UTC <thekenlongman> @AthleticsDebate @RathRob Not true. The A's have an option

909834120997486592 2017-09-18 17:38:53 UTC <thekenlongman> @JtESPN991 I remember when they hired him. I mentioned he couldn't win in the NFL or at Oregon State. Idk why neb fans thought things would change

907979560783814657 2017-09-13 14:49:31 UTC <thekenlongman> @erinelyzabeth True....but ice fishing is great
907978843712921600 2017-09-13 14:46:40 UTC <thekenlongman> @erinelyzabeth But.....ice fishing???

907399371582455808 2017-09-11 00:24:03 UTC <thekenlongman> @thekuhlest Blast the orange juice
906941232894558208 2017-09-10 18:03:34 UTC <thekenlongman> Another 3rd and long another soft zone with no pressure. I'm I seriously the only one seeing this?
906935793381367809 2017-09-10 17:41:57 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter It's like knj is scared to rush more than 4 on 3rd and long
906931401102024704 2017-09-10 17:24:30 UTC <thekenlongman> @BairNBCS 3rd year of knj strategy of no pressure on 3rd and long.......or ever
906929733958377473 2017-09-10 17:17:53 UTC <thekenlongman> 3rd and 10 and shocker....Norton sends no pressure. Mariotta has all day and finds an open receiver for a 1st down

905491086721687552 2017-09-06 18:01:12 UTC <thekenlongman> @JOEL9ONE I'd imagine most of those guys from both teams have homes, family, and friends in the area and would/should focus on them and not football
905465266938589185 2017-09-06 16:18:37 UTC <thekenlongman> @AthleticsDebate The most recent 1st round pick to play in Oakland is matt Chapman. He was drafted 4 years ago. Which means tanking now won't help until 2022
905416986309541892 2017-09-06 13:06:46 UTC <thekenlongman> @AthleticsDebate Who cares about draft position?

903668984234594304 2017-09-01 17:20:49 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser So the team said he's not going to be included in the September call-ups?
903668359018930178 2017-09-01 17:18:20 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser I know, but you said you don't think he will be recalled. I'm just curious as to why you think that?
903666367223627776 2017-09-01 17:10:25 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser Why do you think that? Not many bullpen options on the 40 man. And the A's pen definitely needs reinforcements
903661402149216256 2017-09-01 16:50:42 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser Susan, who are you most excited to see? For me it's bassitt and smo.....the feel good stories
903659565056540672 2017-09-01 16:43:24 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser Yes, but I'm hoping it's like Christmas when you have a real good idea of what your getting but there might still be a few awesome surprises
903658625050095616 2017-09-01 16:39:40 UTC <thekenlongman> Patiently waiting for @susanslusser to tell us all who are officially being called up today. #SeptemberCallUps

902633741536735233 2017-08-29 20:47:08 UTC <thekenlongman> @WillReeveJr Now it lists a FB. Your story either lumped him into the rbs or he wasn't there.

902570328236277760 2017-08-29 16:35:09 UTC <thekenlongman> @AdamKadourhe @SeanMcElwee Lol, what media do you watch? Cartoon Network?

902568824523722756 2017-08-29 16:29:11 UTC <thekenlongman> @NickHjeltness I predict Smith becomes a pro bowl cb once he gets away from knj's no pressure single coverage scheme

900525452904681472 2017-08-23 01:09:33 UTC <thekenlongman> @AthleticsDebate Lol ok
900523736482201602 2017-08-23 01:02:44 UTC <thekenlongman> @AthleticsDebate He's been in the MLB less than 4. And when did service time affect age? Maxwell is a few months younger. Is he not a youngster?
900523390921916416 2017-08-23 01:01:21 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser So who's on the way up? Smo, canha, wendle, Nunez?

900520311153598465 2017-08-23 00:49:07 UTC <thekenlongman> @Kaepernick7 @SportsCenter @ajbrody333 Nope

900496680599953409 2017-08-23 23:15:13 UTC <thekenlongman> @EthanRKassel @EvanDrellich Did the A's get their asking price? 3 extra large bags of popcorn?
900496418535686144 2017-08-23 23:14:11 UTC <thekenlongman> @AthleticsDebate Semien is 26?
900495744515227648 2017-08-23 23:11:30 UTC <thekenlongman> @AthleticsDebate These young guys crawled back into this game from 5 down to force extras. Win or lose I love the fight in this team.
900474471881912320 2017-08-23 21:46:58 UTC <thekenlongman> @ClementiNick Think Chapman wins it this year?
900473815817310208 2017-08-23 21:44:22 UTC <thekenlongman> @EC4Life1012 Nope. Gonna get buried in the rotation
900472705228472320 2017-08-23 21:39:57 UTC <thekenlongman> @ClementiNick I feel like that # is low
900424638760599552 2017-08-23 18:28:57 UTC <thekenlongman> @SacramentoKings I'd go Steph Curry and Patrick Beverly with the 23rd
900423310743191552 2017-08-23 18:23:40 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaiderTom2120 I still feel like Williams would have been the better pick with a wr in Rd 2 or 3 of a deep wr draft class
900422918340976641 2017-08-23 18:22:07 UTC <thekenlongman> Thanks for the exclusive clip, @DIRECTV. I'm standing with @TheNotoriousMMA. #McGregorFTWhttps://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce54fkzys/4obvt
900170527200886785 2017-08-22 01:39:12 UTC <thekenlongman> @JtESPN991 His one of very few
900157525349113856 2017-08-22 00:47:32 UTC <thekenlongman> @JtESPN991 What a terrible trade by Boston. Cleveland gets a closer, depth, and a probable top 3 pick. Bos gets a #2
899798303809781760 2017-08-21 01:00:07 UTC <thekenlongman> Continue to run a career minor leaguer out every 5 days and this is what we get. It's insulting to have gossett in AAA
899451692634169344 2017-08-20 02:02:49 UTC <thekenlongman> @AthleticsFarm @EthanRKassel I don't see it. I think the best course is stick with what we have at sp. Maybe add 2 bullpen arms. Although Hatcher has looked solid.
899404616948883456 2017-08-20 22:55:45 UTC <thekenlongman> @_kimms_ @ClementiNick If luzardo reaches his potential the trade will be a steal. Neuse is the wildcard. Could be a top prospect in a year and become a trade chip
899402481796497408 2017-08-20 22:47:16 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter The only one I've got is....it's preseason and they are holding some stuff back. If not Mack is gonna 30 sacks to get us to the super bowl.
899374937894305792 2017-08-20 20:57:49 UTC <thekenlongman> Treinen in to pitch in the 8th for the @Athletics casilla to close?pic.twitter.com/YGY2TO3LOX

898737816032509952 2017-08-18 02:46:07 UTC <thekenlongman> My rant of the night. My gf's kids see their dad once every other week. His choice. They want more time with him. Poor kiddos
898735723741708288 2017-08-18 02:37:48 UTC <thekenlongman> @AthleticsFarm Nunez should make the team next season. He's out of options.
898612300059254786 2017-08-18 18:27:22 UTC <thekenlongman> @oakclubhouse One last question. Which prospect that came to Oakland this last trade season is going to make his previous org. Go "oops"?
898608848323215362 2017-08-18 18:13:39 UTC <thekenlongman> @oakclubhouse Right on. Love your work btw
898608667813068801 2017-08-18 18:12:56 UTC <thekenlongman> @harryburks4 I'm sure a few will be there
898608031700615168 2017-08-18 18:10:24 UTC <thekenlongman> @oakclubhouse So, he's probably gonna be gone then
898604251575865346 2017-08-18 17:55:23 UTC <thekenlongman> @oakclubhouse I did my internship with the RockHounds so I know how unfriendly it can be for hitters. 100 rbis for Rosa...who is this now intriguing guy?
898601919945428992 2017-08-18 17:46:07 UTC <thekenlongman> @oakclubhouse Neither should have been sent down. I'm all for the youth movement/rebuild. Hard to see these guys in AAA with soon to be gone guys blocking
898600846287446018 2017-08-18 17:41:51 UTC <thekenlongman> @oakclubhouse Too bad barreto and gosset are being blocked by all stars lowrie and Smith.....

897962202472136704 2017-08-16 23:24:07 UTC <thekenlongman> @devinpangaro @EthanRKassel I don't disagree.
897961957176688640 2017-08-16 23:23:08 UTC <thekenlongman> @EthanRKassel @devinpangaro I would have used him in an emergency only after 33 pitches last night. But with Blackburn only going 4 it puts a toll on the bp
897652444313858048 2017-08-15 02:53:14 UTC <thekenlongman> @AthleticsDebate KD is our left fielder. Nobody wants Jed. So he continues to block our top prospect
897650776184692739 2017-08-15 02:46:37 UTC <thekenlongman> @AthleticsDebate Mengden is close not quite ready. If we are in a youth movement then why not barreto, bruggy, gosset, Nunez vs Smith X2, Davis, lowrie?

896937895562313729 2017-08-13 03:33:53 UTC <thekenlongman> @DJStrat @GTemp14 The Nazi party formed because the Kaiser in Germany wasn't doing enough to rebuild the country after WW1. It turned into a hate group.
896936682544521219 2017-08-13 03:29:04 UTC <thekenlongman> @DJStrat @GTemp14 Using violence and hate.
896936635211800577 2017-08-13 03:28:52 UTC <thekenlongman> @DJStrat @GTemp14 That's not how the world works guy. The 3 women who started BLM most likely meant well. Since then others who are leading the cause are ....
896936105731170307 2017-08-13 03:26:46 UTC <thekenlongman> @DJStrat @GTemp14 Just because you denounce her doesn't change anything. You wanted proof. There it is. She is a leader/organizer for BLM

896907681385988096 2017-08-13 01:33:49 UTC <thekenlongman> @DJStrat @GTemp14 Despite the proof that they do

896893038626078721 2017-08-13 00:35:38 UTC <thekenlongman> @GTemp14 If you can't see the similarities then your blind. Both groups are simply awful
896892870715514884 2017-08-13 00:34:58 UTC <thekenlongman> @GTemp14 The Nazi party didn't start to kill Jews and non whites. It was started to revive the country of Germany. They however did so by using hate.
896892602447876101 2017-08-13 00:33:54 UTC <thekenlongman> @GTemp14 BECAUSE THEIR LEADERS ADVOCATE HATE AND VIOLENCE AS A MEANS TO SPREAD THEIR MESSAGE!!!!
896891139084623872 2017-08-13 00:28:05 UTC <thekenlongman> @GTemp14 Ok, youve convinced me. BLM ranks as an 8 on my hate groups list while neo-naziism gets a 10
896890884855177216 2017-08-13 00:27:05 UTC <thekenlongman> @GTemp14 Including many BLM leaders.
896886181044011009 2017-08-13 00:08:23 UTC <thekenlongman> @GTemp14 Do the research guy. It was a temporary ban so that extensive background checks could be made.
896885844614684672 2017-08-13 00:07:03 UTC <thekenlongman> @GTemp14 I agree 100%
896885638833754112 2017-08-13 00:06:14 UTC <thekenlongman> @GTemp14 Nothing is wrong with the thought process. But as I've been saying, they have used hate and violence as a means of getting their message out
896884513984331777 2017-08-13 00:01:46 UTC <thekenlongman> @GTemp14 They do. As long as they pass background checks and have no terrorist ties. How is that inconceivable?
896881978967941121 2017-08-13 23:51:41 UTC <thekenlongman> BLM uses hate and violence as a way to get out their message. Much like the Nazi party did in the 30's. Not exactly the same but similar.https://twitter.com/GTemp14/status/896878321643868162
896881596233506816 2017-08-13 23:50:10 UTC <thekenlongman> What does longevity have to do with hate? New hate/old hate it's still wrong.https://twitter.com/GTemp14/status/896878740759773188
896880700711854080 2017-08-13 23:46:36 UTC <thekenlongman> @GTemp14 Originally every Muslim had it rough being banned from coming back into the country then just the ones who had to wait awhile.
896876235468423169 2017-08-13 23:28:52 UTC <thekenlongman> So now your changing your story? Originally it was every Muslim now it's the relatively few that were inconvenienced for a few hours?https://twitter.com/GTemp14/status/896765217929125889
896754843489927168 2017-08-13 15:26:30 UTC <thekenlongman> @PincheAnthony @OakStadiumWatch They are both domestic terrorist groups. I don't view either as being better than the other.
896747561574309888 2017-08-13 14:57:34 UTC <thekenlongman> @OakStadiumWatch At least Trump has condemned the violence. Obama never addressed the issues. Violence is wrong regardless of who commits it.
896747247500525572 2017-08-13 14:56:19 UTC <thekenlongman> @OakStadiumWatch No, but BLM have executed police officers, kidnapped white autistic kids and beat them to death, called for blacks to kill whites.
896743303739080705 2017-08-13 14:40:38 UTC <thekenlongman> The people angry with Trump not specifically calling out "white supremacists" are the same who had no issue with Obama letting BLM terrorize
896742231431720960 2017-08-13 14:36:23 UTC <thekenlongman> He has, if your Muslim from another country you cannot travel to US without background check. If your an American Muslim then your ok. Easyhttps://twitter.com/GTemp14/status/896483467659182081

896546939528912896 2017-08-12 01:40:22 UTC <thekenlongman> Your refusal to condemn the terrorist group blm has led to another group of hate to rise up and challenge them. #ThanksButNoThankshttps://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/896523304873238528
896545641479847936 2017-08-12 01:35:12 UTC <thekenlongman> @EthanRKassel I expect to hear about some phantom injury tomorrow that puts him on the DL. A shattered confidence won't work
896511592111587328 2017-08-12 23:19:54 UTC <thekenlongman> Good thing that finally after 8 years we have a president who is doing that.https://twitter.com/billclinton/status/896419211362410496

896029546956308480 2017-08-11 15:24:26 UTC <thekenlongman> @VogtsHelmet @itsdbax Because he's not at his peak. The dude has more home runs than anyone the last 2 years.
896024482904551425 2017-08-11 15:04:18 UTC <thekenlongman> @VogtsHelmet @itsdbax Khrush plays left field. I'm not being mean but do you understand how baseball contracts work? Healy has 5 years till his is up. Munoz 7+
895991938771337216 2017-08-11 12:54:59 UTC <thekenlongman> @VogtsHelmet @itsdbax They wouldn't be signing him for his arm.
895713808844414976 2017-08-10 18:29:48 UTC <thekenlongman> @NickHjeltness And that Penn is getting an extra 3-4 weeks off
895695080350138369 2017-08-10 17:15:23 UTC <thekenlongman> @Oahu_Raider808 Lol I know. It's unlikely but you never know. This whole situation is why I felt we needed to draft a tackle in Rd 1 the past 2 drafts
895694303841755136 2017-08-10 17:12:17 UTC <thekenlongman> @Oahu_Raider808 I don't think that will happen but I'm just saying.
895694196497014785 2017-08-10 17:11:52 UTC <thekenlongman> @Oahu_Raider808 I agree with all of that. However, IF he's pancaking dudes and keeping everyone off the qb's then Penn will start to sweat a bit.
895692565327958016 2017-08-10 17:05:23 UTC <thekenlongman> @Oahu_Raider808 I realize this in response to my tweet. I never said NH would be our LT. I said his play will be used as leverage for one side or the other
895691642211975168 2017-08-10 17:01:43 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter @fabi4ngom3z Never said he was.
895691068842188802 2017-08-10 16:59:26 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter @Ed_Coutu He's not going to be the starting LT. Penn will be. My point is if MN plays well then Reggie can call Penn's bluff. If not then RM will cave
895681797777793024 2017-08-10 16:22:36 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter He will be back for preseason gm #3. If newhouse plays well then no raise, if he looks bad then raiders will be throwing money at him.
895680693316894720 2017-08-10 16:18:12 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter In the game of chicken whomever flinches first loses. In my opinion the raiders have more to lose long-term while Penn does short-term.
895620439350820865 2017-08-10 12:18:47 UTC <thekenlongman> @ClementiNick That's an all Star tweet, time to trade it to the Yankees
895619741326258176 2017-08-10 12:16:00 UTC <thekenlongman> @VogtsHelmet I'd expect the A's will try to extend him this off-season. My guess 4/50 + big $ option years
895617177595691008 2017-08-10 12:05:49 UTC <thekenlongman> @espngolic Barkley is holding true, he criticized Durant for leaving and now Kyrie for wanting to leave.
895486056547495936 2017-08-09 03:24:47 UTC <thekenlongman> @sfchronicle @susanslusser He doesn't have a future as a starter in Oakland. Ala hahn

894980177599488001 2017-08-08 17:54:36 UTC <thekenlongman> @ucgoldenbears1 He's destined for the pen. This list was for current starters
894979526299537408 2017-08-08 17:52:01 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser @ClementiNick I'd disagree on shore because I think his floor is high but with a low ceiling. He's going to pitch in MLB but I see him as a 4 at best
894973925808984064 2017-08-08 17:29:46 UTC <thekenlongman> @ClementiNick @susanslusser My mistake. That list was just limited to starting pitchers. Obviously I'd have him, dull, and Wahl on the list.

892191424149467136 2017-07-31 01:13:06 UTC <thekenlongman> @EthanRKassel It's .025 points lower than his career avg. Which can be expected from a guy north of 30.
892189510028500992 2017-07-31 01:05:29 UTC <thekenlongman> @EthanRKassel How? His ops is 30 points higher as a 32 year old hitting .221 brugman is a 25 year old rookie hitting .274. I'm taking the younger guy

887509929384321024 2017-07-18 03:10:30 UTC <thekenlongman> @jjrayn I'm most definitely not a twins fan

887472131595845632 2017-07-18 00:40:19 UTC <thekenlongman> @Twins @MLB @ESPN991SF @JtESPN991 @jjrayn Also war is a calculated stat. Meaning the context is you can't have a good war if you don't play.
887471740292485120 2017-07-18 00:38:45 UTC <thekenlongman> @Twins @MLB @ESPN991SF @JtESPN991 @jjrayn Hmm, the avg MLB salary is 4 million per year. Starting pitchers are the highest paid position. So position players avg closer to 3.5 a year
887455988533547008 2017-07-18 23:36:10 UTC <thekenlongman> @JtESPN991 @Twins @MLB @ESPN991SF The twins are contenders, so why blow it up now? They are 2-3 pieces away.

883770212910116864 2017-07-08 19:30:13 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser But to answer your ? Yes I'd rush a trade to get barreto settled into 2b and playing everyday.
883769851730313216 2017-07-08 19:28:46 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser But I'd be thrilled for a blue chipper
883769743710093312 2017-07-08 19:28:21 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser I doubt they get anything of real value for him similar to Orlando Cabrera for Taylor ladendorf
883768024968290304 2017-07-08 19:21:31 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser You can on video games. . But my argument is semien's health wasn't a surprise.
883766566730383360 2017-07-08 19:15:43 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser I understand that but I feel lowries trade should have came when semien came off the dl.
883764057454501888 2017-07-08 19:05:45 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser Sending down the #1 prospect for a 36 year old in a rebuilding year. "sigh"

876571577248354306 2017-06-18 22:45:24 UTC <thekenlongman> Please tell me how trump was being disrespectful? Unlike our previous president however trump has attended services for fallen military.

875748634125619200 2017-06-16 16:15:19 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaideretteQT Well I'm walking on 4 1/2

875358550616420352 2017-06-15 14:25:16 UTC <thekenlongman> @TheNotoriousMMA @dannykanell @shaps29_dfs When was that fight? Like 5 years ago? FM is 40 now.

870051078527528961 2017-05-31 22:55:16 UTC <thekenlongman> Pinder continues to hit his way out of the lineup
869583692318035968 2017-05-30 15:58:02 UTC <thekenlongman> So why are you still following and replying to the A's beat writer? Trollhttps://twitter.com/dhegertz1/status/869332236251807744

860188307774464000 2017-05-04 17:44:08 UTC <thekenlongman> @JHickey3 Surprise. He is so garbage on the first pitch following a walk

849779125984350210 2017-04-05 00:21:46 UTC <thekenlongman> @thekuhlest @xllxmc None that could beat her. I preferred kasich
849696543540162560 2017-04-05 18:53:37 UTC <thekenlongman> @thekuhlest I live in the Midwest, the overwhelming feeling was he may be the 2nd worst choice to be president but was a way better choice than her.
849691049723400192 2017-04-05 18:31:47 UTC <thekenlongman> @thekuhlest It wasn't that. Hillary convinced 63 million to vote against her.
849490807014948866 2017-04-04 05:16:05 UTC <thekenlongman> And that's why closer by committee doesn't work.
848742255540273153 2017-04-02 03:41:37 UTC <thekenlongman> @SDBaseballNews Pierre and Mitchell ahead of Lincoln?
848357731673231360 2017-04-01 02:13:39 UTC <thekenlongman> @ClementiNick 2017 bold prediction, montas grabs closer role by end of April. All star, rookie of the year.
847793714621755392 2017-03-31 12:52:27 UTC <thekenlongman> @StillRyanFive I agree with you there. But I'm saying he's not so significantly better and the position isnt a weakness to warrant a rd 1 pick.
847791453174730752 2017-03-31 12:43:28 UTC <thekenlongman> @StillRyanFive Exactly. That's why I don't see the raiders going rb in round 1. JR is going to get his touches. To explosive not to.
847781949213212673 2017-03-31 12:05:42 UTC <thekenlongman> @StillRyanFive If the raiders draft a rb he will at best split carries. Therefore I'd rather they draft a starting caliber player in rd 1. OT, MLB, SS
847776454217789444 2017-03-31 11:43:52 UTC <thekenlongman> @EthanRKassel Im kinda nervous
847518098047619074 2017-03-30 18:37:15 UTC <thekenlongman> @dannykanell @JtESPN991 Lol OK. Do they give back any money if they fail to be a championship contender?
846707456441008128 2017-03-28 12:56:03 UTC <thekenlongman> @devinpangaro chavvy worse than shooty? Ouch
846146244032507905 2017-03-26 23:45:59 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersAnalysis do you think raiders will go position of need or best player available in rd 1
845813436139364352 2017-03-25 01:43:32 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser yep.
845810098329059328 2017-03-25 01:30:16 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser to open a spot on the 40 man for a potential waiver claim and/or give a few other pitchers a chance to move up.
845808790456979456 2017-03-25 01:25:04 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser yeah but how far down the depth chart will he be when the season starts?
845806791871082496 2017-03-25 01:17:08 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser next question, Do you think he gets traded or released?
845799428279676928 2017-03-25 00:47:52 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser whew good. He hasn't looked good
845796678175277058 2017-03-25 00:36:56 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser so what's your educated guess? Alcantara or Hahn a #5 starter?

844551822731808768 2017-03-22 14:10:20 UTC <thekenlongman> that's not fair to cook. He was on the practice squad all but 2 weeks in the season and made his 1st ever start in playoffs

843537669187690499 2017-03-19 19:00:27 UTC <thekenlongman> @ESPN991SF @JtESPN991 @kruzmissile nope, question was asked who are the most sensitive and thin Skinned sports fans were.

843536606934065154 2017-03-19 18:56:13 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser hmmm interesting stuff. I feel like de aza, canha, Rosales, and phegley have roster spots locked up.
843535104882499585 2017-03-19 18:50:15 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser is there really any competition left for the 13 non-pitcher spots?

841713179965153280 2017-03-14 18:10:35 UTC <thekenlongman> @susanslusser if smo doesn't go to the 60 and de aza makes team then who gets cut from the 40 man?
841673736046690304 2017-03-14 15:33:50 UTC <thekenlongman> 3 years ago I asked. U said yes. Now I don't even know who you are anymore. U lied, cheated, took everything from me. Glad I didn't say I do

840341069938081792 2017-03-10 23:18:18 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter my crazy idea is put KO at rt and VA at rg. Having Hudson and KO next to him could only be a good thing.
840340342763339777 2017-03-10 23:15:25 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter I think your wrong about VA. Started in the sec which is like AAA for the nfl
840339796463616001 2017-03-10 23:13:14 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter see @BWilliamsonNFL  tweet a out raider fa's leaving

840337655602786305 2017-03-10 23:04:44 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaiderTom2120 he blows. Glad he went to a rival. Hope he starts and continues to be a revolving door at tackle
840337315511820290 2017-03-10 23:03:23 UTC <thekenlongman> @TheOnlyNation vikings misused him horribly. Screen after screen in the passing game. Never over the top. His speed opens up coop 10-15

824297650921029632 2017-01-25 16:47:29 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter now I definitely don't believe that. If true he would have been benched. I would go for the coaches gave him the freedom
824296617436127233 2017-01-25 16:43:22 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter I am on record of saying the D scheme was atrocious. Which attributes to the struggles of each player in the secondary
824293926945353729 2017-01-25 16:32:41 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter I'm with you if they cut him purely to have more $ for Carr and mack
824293502674698240 2017-01-25 16:31:00 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter exactly. Then why bring in nelson if you already had Allen? Because one is better than the other
824292057510539265 2017-01-25 16:25:15 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter perhaps its scheme but I've not seen much of Allen. I think the coaching staff feels the same based on pt and signing RN
824289763352002561 2017-01-25 16:16:08 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter obviously fair, but can they get a replacement who is an upgrade? Not in the draft .
824288203842711552 2017-01-25 16:09:56 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter doesn't make any sense to cut a playmaking db

821203701159366656 2017-01-16 03:53:14 UTC <thekenlongman> @erinelyzabeth haha. You should come down to Sioux falls for the summit league tournament. I have a Gf but I'll take all 3 of us
821202512984281089 2017-01-16 03:48:30 UTC <thekenlongman> @erinelyzabeth do you ever venture down to the better half of the Dakotas?
821186230444584960 2017-01-16 02:43:48 UTC <thekenlongman> @erinelyzabeth 
821181652613394433 2017-01-16 02:25:37 UTC <thekenlongman> @erinelyzabeth unfortunately he is better than the alternative
821180509451653121 2017-01-16 02:21:04 UTC <thekenlongman> @erinelyzabeth me?
821180265603203073 2017-01-16 02:20:06 UTC <thekenlongman> @JtESPN991 yes Jeff, the kings battling for the 8 seed, are going to trade their best player for 2 garbage players and 2 unknowns.

821095620807114752 2017-01-16 20:43:45 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersAnalysis I firmly believe defensively the pieces are there. Scheme was bad.  Biggest weakness in my eyes are the OT's. Penn's age...

818957998454349825 2017-01-10 23:09:36 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter @Linebacker41 what I hated was if the run game was going he would switch to the unsuccessful short pass game. Or vice versa

815710589163081728 2017-01-01 00:05:34 UTC <thekenlongman> @Jerrymcd @SithRaider you may be right, but you can get those guys in RDS 5-6-7 of the draft. Cheaper. More $ for acdc and mack

810627633994235905 2016-12-18 23:27:43 UTC <thekenlongman> @BairCSN its not that he's covering him. Its that he's 10 yds off of him at the snap on a 1-g from the 8
810611735354867714 2016-12-18 22:24:32 UTC <thekenlongman> Roberts is just bad.
810610880044036097 2016-12-18 22:21:08 UTC <thekenlongman> 3/5 odds says Musgrave calls a draw or a quick 3 yd out on this 3rd and long

810609762949853188 2016-12-18 22:16:42 UTC <thekenlongman> @LWOS_Raiders Only read Carr made. I feel like that's a Musgrave call. Calls the play and tells Carr hit the slot cross.  Also poor rt by R
810600808316370949 2016-12-18 21:41:07 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter he was Carr's favorite target 2 years ago
810600129677983745 2016-12-18 21:38:25 UTC <thekenlongman> @StillRyanFive I would be to if I was playing vs this defense. Soft coverage and only rushing 4
810598795436314625 2016-12-18 21:33:07 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter that is just terrible. How do you get beat over the top on a 4 man rush?
810598241402257408 2016-12-18 21:30:55 UTC <thekenlongman> Good early defense. Soft coverage no pressure. Rivers should easily throw for 600 today vs this

808027219742392320 2016-12-11 19:14:36 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter  Alden smith can't get on the field yet a dirty player like talib gets to play every week smh
807300055652777984 2016-12-09 19:05:06 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter Seth Roberts just dropped another pass
807295406430359554 2016-12-09 18:46:38 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter Murray ran the ball like he was possessed. Vadal Alexander looked pretty good also.  to Howard and play selection.
807088200342732800 2016-12-08 05:03:16 UTC <thekenlongman> @SLYBOY_22 my bad. I meant I blame part of the loss on ko's absence. Not him personally. The run game was there all game. Fades werent there
807084871231406080 2016-12-08 04:50:02 UTC <thekenlongman> @SLYBOY_22 I blame KO being hurt, carr having a bad finger, and Musgrave's horrible play calling. #LessFades #LessRoberts
807084558378266624 2016-12-08 04:48:48 UTC <thekenlongman> no way. A healthy carr and osemele would have been an easy win. Musgrave didn't want to take advantage of raiders o size.
807084071864115200 2016-12-08 04:46:52 UTC <thekenlongman> @RAIDERS @LeeWilson71 4 teams have 10+ wins. Raiders have 3 losses and 2 of those vs a 10 win team. Raiders are top tier team
807083614101970945 2016-12-08 04:45:03 UTC <thekenlongman> defense looked good
807083252611710976 2016-12-08 04:43:36 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter Musgrave play calling; 7 yd run 5 yd run 1st down 1 yd pass Inc pass 25 yd fade inc pass Punt
807082311053443072 2016-12-08 04:39:52 UTC <thekenlongman> I agree he didn't play well but the play calling was absolute garbage. Consistently 5+ yards per carry and give it up after 1d
807081018624802816 2016-12-08 04:34:44 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter 3rd and 1. Clock stops after a run. Chiefs can't stop the run. Throw a fade with wr 4 vs peters
807080473428197380 2016-12-08 04:32:34 UTC <thekenlongman> I'm just so damn confused by this play calling
807072152113577984 2016-12-08 03:59:30 UTC <thekenlongman> @StillRyanFive Musgrave blows. Carr has been at his best in the hurry up making all the reads himself.
807071821493399552 2016-12-08 03:58:11 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter running the ball gets 5-6 per play and Musgrave goes back to short passes for 1 yard. This is why I can't stand him
807065177241878528 2016-12-08 03:31:47 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter maybe look for cooper? Idk just saying
807064958353735680 2016-12-08 03:30:55 UTC <thekenlongman> Is cooper alive? Two turnovers and we are throwing to Rivera and Roberts in the end zone? Wtf
807062724937129984 2016-12-08 03:22:02 UTC <thekenlongman> Again frustrating play calling from Musgrave. Run game is working and no Johnson yet we are throwing down the sideline to #3 wr
807062253161877505 2016-12-08 03:20:10 UTC <thekenlongman> Does Roberts have 13 drops tonight? Feels like it.
807044547259891742 2016-12-08 02:09:48 UTC <thekenlongman> That 3 and 4 play is typical Musgrave play calling. Carr had 1 target. Wasn't allowed to make an audible to go deep vs 2 man rush.
807032327901745152 2016-12-08 01:21:15 UTC <thekenlongman> @KOseven0 out tonight. If only the flight was 1500 miles instead of 1800. Smh right @RaidersReporter ?

806223649808285696 2016-12-06 19:47:51 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter I used Google 
806223402449117184 2016-12-06 19:46:52 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter Kc - 8 home games 2 are primetime, 5 start/ed at 12 pm CST, 1 started at 3:05
806219623280574468 2016-12-06 19:31:51 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter because the kickoff of this primetime game is 4 1/2 hours later for a normal game for oak but 7 1/2 hours later for kc
806219002703912960 2016-12-06 19:29:23 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter regular non primetime home game. Raiders play theirs at 1 pm pst (1:15,1:25 whatever) kc plays at noon cst
806218631528980482 2016-12-06 19:27:55 UTC <thekenlongman> @dannykanell Oakland raiders are like the Washington huskies. Both bad for so long. Had high expectations this year and didn't disapoint.
806217046925131777 2016-12-06 19:21:37 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter lol ok. So then does oak get the advantage of playing at 5:25 pt? When they normally play at 1? Vs kc plays at 7:25 vs 12?
806214196669059072 2016-12-06 19:10:17 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter 5 hr flight vs 2 hr flight. Huge disadvantage. My point was kc didn't play at home in preparation for Thursday.
806209952897531904 2016-12-06 18:53:26 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter huh? Kc just played in atl. Both teams have to travel about the same. 2 of last 3 games will be on short rest. That's bs
805548897359790084 2016-12-04 23:06:38 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter linebackers standing flatfooted and getting run over. Too bad we don't have any coaches that played the position
805546481755291648 2016-12-04 22:57:02 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersAnalysis what about crabtrees and coopers?
805545960323612674 2016-12-04 22:54:57 UTC <thekenlongman> Running the zone read when Carr has a dislocated finger. I'm certain Musgrave is retarded.
805545671482888192 2016-12-04 22:53:49 UTC <thekenlongman> I've been critical of Norton on scheme before. Today guys are just not making plays.
805545420852236288 2016-12-04 22:52:49 UTC <thekenlongman> Just playing like garbage on defense.
805184814718578689 2016-12-03 22:59:54 UTC <thekenlongman> @erinelyzabeth next week. _
802994857232961536 2016-11-27 21:57:47 UTC <thekenlongman> 2 shitty calls leads to panthers TD. Raiders defense playing 11 on 17
800907048976158720 2016-11-21 03:41:35 UTC <thekenlongman> Maybe abandon the ineffective rungame?

795481222399062016 2016-11-06 04:21:17 UTC <thekenlongman> @RealRaider2055 I didn't see it. Plus Musgrave has a history of making dumb play calls
795480314546159616 2016-11-06 04:17:40 UTC <thekenlongman> @RealRaider2055 @SpuraiderL Musgrave made the call
795480094332612613 2016-11-06 04:16:48 UTC <thekenlongman> bails out Musgrave's awful call
795479993635794944 2016-11-06 04:16:24 UTC <thekenlongman> Dear Musgrave, wtf? 10 pt lead with 7 minutes left and they can't stop the run.

790571027981926400 2016-10-24 15:09:55 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter defense looked a lot better (because bortals blows). Missed a few TD opportunities early but otherwise a good game by the O
790489497485971457 2016-10-24 09:45:57 UTC <thekenlongman> @robinlundberg FYI Kershaw is 2-1 with a save in his last 4 elimination games
790252848042749952 2016-10-23 18:05:35 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter bowling
790252321221390336 2016-10-23 18:03:30 UTC <thekenlongman> Washington is a small shifty back Musgrave - pound him up the middle.   I think Darren sproles has about 13 career carries up the middle
790249753476870144 2016-10-23 17:53:18 UTC <thekenlongman> Bortals should put a mini fridge in the pocket so he can enjoy a beer while he has all this time to look for open receivers.
790246991435436032 2016-10-23 17:42:19 UTC <thekenlongman> Uhhhg. Can't finish
790246816235163648 2016-10-23 17:41:37 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter I hate splitting carries like the raiders do. Nobody can get into a rhythm. I  wash as change of pace back but not = guy
790245916645007360 2016-10-23 17:38:03 UTC <thekenlongman> Need 6
790245681214558209 2016-10-23 17:37:07 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter that's how the patriots do it
790245034968756224 2016-10-23 17:34:33 UTC <thekenlongman> and a horrible throw by bortals. Lol
790244540070244352 2016-10-23 17:32:35 UTC <thekenlongman> that was an individual effort for the pick. Scheme still blows
790243821971906560 2016-10-23 17:29:43 UTC <thekenlongman> @MySportsUpdate @DieHardR8rsFan somebody alert the @RAIDERS to sign this guy to play mlb
790243346690084864 2016-10-23 17:27:50 UTC <thekenlongman> Norton's terrible scheme keeps killing us
790243168570572801 2016-10-23 17:27:08 UTC <thekenlongman> @ThompsonScribe @AthleticsRaider he was a 3rd rd pick. Why did you think he was gonna be a stud?
790241674773405696 2016-10-23 17:21:11 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter @RaidersDash  We got cooper, Edwards, Walford Could have had lenoard Williams, max Williams, lockett

786672827457875968 2016-10-13 20:59:52 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter @PFF_Mike big Ben took their top off. I say let's play some AL Davis football.
786501222240915456 2016-10-13 09:37:58 UTC <thekenlongman> @robinlundberg just curious, has anyone asked Deangelo Russell about locker room talk?
786234840043524104 2016-10-12 15:59:28 UTC <thekenlongman> @Oahu_Raider808 its scheme. I could pick apart the oak defense with 5-6 seconds every drop back. That's why I never blamed db's or Hayden.
786209068771749888 2016-10-12 14:17:03 UTC <thekenlongman> @djsweeter23 I only hated him cause he was a bronco. People need to chill. He's a good dude.

785999272416116736 2016-10-11 00:23:24 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaiderMarston i agree but I don't think it was a terrible move at the time. Just ended up bad.

785998366966558720 2016-10-11 00:19:48 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaiderMarston tough call. 110 pitches. Just walked the bases loaded. #3 hitter coming up. However he's your best pitcher. 50/50 move
785997771656396800 2016-10-11 00:17:26 UTC <thekenlongman> @erinelyzabeth every time
785241611621937153 2016-10-09 22:12:43 UTC <thekenlongman> Hopefully Musgrave sticks with this ineffective running game. I'd hate to see crab get going. #FigureItOut

784561258162970624 2016-10-07 01:09:15 UTC <thekenlongman> @ClementiNick the exact same thing can be said about Hillary. They both suck
784560626140053505 2016-10-07 01:06:44 UTC <thekenlongman> @ClementiNick because the only candidate worse than him is hillary
784186929944236032 2016-10-06 00:21:48 UTC <thekenlongman> Maybe the @49ers Should move to Vegas. Judging by the crowd tonight nobody in San Francisco would notice. 
784089190921187328 2016-10-06 17:53:25 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter #3 Carr hits Roberts for a gm winning TD 31-27. Because its Carr and its the chargers.
784088961119420416 2016-10-06 17:52:30 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter #2 after crab's big game Musgrave will force the ball to cooper. 15 targets, 10 catches 1 drop 88 yards crab - 3 for 28
784088663491608577 2016-10-06 17:51:19 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter my 3 predictions #1 with verrett and Murray out, Musgrave will run the ball between the tackles 20+ times for under 80 yds
783738662802427904 2016-10-05 18:40:33 UTC <thekenlongman> @robinlundberg ok, I totally understand that train of thought, but some guys thrive in setup role but struggle in closer role. Its a dif job
783736390156587008 2016-10-05 18:31:31 UTC <thekenlongman> @robinlundberg I understand that. Its been specialized. But my argument vs yours is every team uses the role now. Your saying they are wrong
783733401996046336 2016-10-05 18:19:38 UTC <thekenlongman> @robinlundberg my beef is, your a non-baseball guy telling baseball people what is and isn't wrong with the game. To me that pushes a button
783732960532979712 2016-10-05 18:17:53 UTC <thekenlongman> @robinlundberg my thing is, if the closer role doesn't make sense logically then why does every team, pro/college, have 1?
783732594852507648 2016-10-05 18:16:26 UTC <thekenlongman> @robinlundberg to clear things up...I agree that britton should have pitched at some point in the game. However buck had a plan he stuck 2.
783617161168171008 2016-10-05 10:37:44 UTC <thekenlongman> @robinlundberg I mean I have opinions and a radio forum I can call into. I'm not calling in to say I think the 3 pt line should be taken out
783616693251682304 2016-10-05 10:35:53 UTC <thekenlongman> @robinlundberg most college teams use a closer. Some high school teams also have one. Its a position every pro team uses. (Continued)
783607287050964992 2016-10-05 09:58:30 UTC <thekenlongman> @robinlundberg I like how you hate the "closer" position. Shows your smarter than every baseball manager ever. What team do you coach?
782982906851373056 2016-10-03 16:37:26 UTC <thekenlongman> @raiderlarry I think the key is to control the game with Murray. Make them play from behind and let rivers make mistakes.
782713443560267776 2016-10-02 22:46:41 UTC <thekenlongman> @AshvinPrasad I've hated the musgrave hire since forever. At least the D looks better
782670406662488064 2016-10-02 19:55:40 UTC <thekenlongman> Bill musgrave, I blame you
782669466848985088 2016-10-02 19:51:56 UTC <thekenlongman> Musgrave - 2 score lead 7 1/2 minutes left. Fuck it let's try some tough pass plays and give Baltimore some free time outs

781530247799779329 2016-09-29 16:25:05 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter 2. Piggybacking on #1 flacco will throw for 300+ due to the extra time in the pocket. Fans will again blame the db's
781530045445578752 2016-09-29 16:24:17 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter my 3 aren't so bold 1. Mack will have another sub par game due to Norton's no pressure defensive scheme.

774730103406272513 2016-09-10 22:03:45 UTC <thekenlongman> @HandsomeJackFM Nevada has 100 yards of offense through 2 1/2 quarters
774729409618022404 2016-09-10 22:00:59 UTC <thekenlongman> @HandsomeJackFM obviously Nevada ain't Texas but this looks a lot better. I'd give Zaire pt here in 2nd half
772957880857223168 2016-09-05 00:41:34 UTC <thekenlongman> @HandsomeJackFM oh and the 212 missed tackles
772957785499639809 2016-09-05 00:41:11 UTC <thekenlongman> @HandsomeJackFM those are my turning points of the game.
772957683288711168 2016-09-05 00:40:47 UTC <thekenlongman> @HandsomeJackFM that and the conservative play calling on the last possession in regulation added with the no call on hunter in the endzone
772650331255738368 2016-09-04 04:19:28 UTC <thekenlongman> @HandsomeJackFM lol, wasn't hindsight for me. I called it immediately
772643022802608128 2016-09-04 03:50:26 UTC <thekenlongman> @HandsomeJackFM I have OK st in my final 4.
772642713103589377 2016-09-04 03:49:12 UTC <thekenlongman> @HandsomeJackFM that's why you go for 2. Rather have the game in our offense's hands vs the defense.
772640501572919296 2016-09-04 03:40:25 UTC <thekenlongman> I don't see texas kicking a fg unless a penalty.

729848207497273344 2016-05-09 01:39:07 UTC <thekenlongman> @EthanRKassel plus we would still have pomerantz. Looking at the rotation at the moment I'd take him over everyone except for hill.
729847957328003073 2016-05-09 01:38:07 UTC <thekenlongman> @EthanRKassel I think Alonso works great for this team. But we have Matt Olson in AAA who brings the same skill set but with more power

707555181928382464 2016-03-09 13:14:35 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter does the osemele change your view for draft needs? I.e. hedge the bet and still take an ot as insurance? Can put them at RT

707245521497247744 2016-03-08 16:44:06 UTC <thekenlongman> @VeteranScout @RaidersReporter @KOsevendeuce my mistake, it was left guard. Lol he was on the right side from my defensive side camera angle

707238503134978048 2016-03-08 16:16:13 UTC <thekenlongman> @VeteranScout @RaidersReporter @KOsevendeuce the videos I've been seeing have him at both rg and lt
707237513950138368 2016-03-08 16:12:17 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter @VeteranScout @KOsevendeuce do you think they addressed the hole at rg or Lt with this signing?
706519520731467777 2016-03-06 16:39:14 UTC <thekenlongman> @120sports @OakAsSocksGrl @120Sports @BillShaikin I have no complaints, its how kids are taught. Break up 2. New rules will change that now.
706518679437979649 2016-03-06 16:35:54 UTC <thekenlongman> @OakAsSocksGrl and he's not Hillary Clinton
706518615571300354 2016-03-06 16:35:39 UTC <thekenlongman> @OakAsSocksGrl for me, he mad a cameo in home alone 2.
706518041673076736 2016-03-06 16:33:22 UTC <thekenlongman> @OakAsSocksGrl @KatieStrangESPN he coached bonds in Pittsburgh
706517581725700096 2016-03-06 16:31:32 UTC <thekenlongman> @VogtsHelmet @LennoxReds ahhhh, I thought you meant shortstop. I think ss games are great. Get to watch more prospects.
705810552598056962 2016-03-04 17:42:03 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersSupport @SilverBlakPride I'd take Alfred morris before either jets rb

705468113072967680 2016-03-03 19:01:19 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter @theMMQB @robertmays I can't imagine Ronnie Stanley being available and the raiders passing on him. Lt bigger need vs rb
703798275258757120 2016-02-27 04:25:59 UTC <thekenlongman> Steph curry is the king of little league
703577002524041216 2016-02-27 13:46:43 UTC <thekenlongman> @WTFFacts on the gas giants?
703576853496229888 2016-02-27 13:46:08 UTC <thekenlongman> @ESPNDari college students can get hurt during a dorm fire drill. Storming the court is an experience. That shouldn't be taken away.
702122225126641664 2016-02-23 13:25:57 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter in this draft there are 2 elite and 2 really good LT's tunasil, Stanley, Conklin, decker. If all gone, Nkemdiche  
701766483110539269 2016-02-22 13:52:22 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter I remember a certain fan saying this exact same thing when Donald Penn was basically a swinging door in the last 8 games.
700762959203553280 2016-02-19 19:24:43 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter @aldavis1225 that's true but most elite LT's in their prime don't normally become available. ....unless your Jared veldheer
700762098352009216 2016-02-19 19:21:18 UTC <thekenlongman> @aldavis1225 @RaidersReporter I'd be fine with them giving Norman a big deal. No other high $ positions are a need. Weddle has 2 b priority

697937330988945408 2016-02-11 00:16:41 UTC <thekenlongman> @accuweather is your app broken? Your current temp is off by 20 degrees and forecast is a 50 degree difference vs local forecast 4 S. Dakota
694959394077814784 2016-02-03 19:03:25 UTC <thekenlongman> @RaidersReporter do you have a FA wish list yet? Mine goes weddle, trevathon, Alfred morris, and (gulp) Brent grimes

694119443610230784 2016-02-01 11:25:46 UTC <thekenlongman> Pitchers and catchers report this month. @JoshPhegley @whatwouldDOOdo @SonnyGray2 @kage49 @JohnAxford 
692187540342841348 2016-01-26 03:29:04 UTC <thekenlongman> @Argus911  caller sounds like a big crybaby. Hope their feelings are not broken.
689802066164715521 2016-01-20 13:30:03 UTC <thekenlongman> @ESPN991SF @JtESPN991 if I had 2 minutes to come up with a qb list I could do just as bad. Peyton manning in top 25???
