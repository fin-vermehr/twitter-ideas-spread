971156101809938432 2018-03-06 22:50:32 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews In early 2016, they knew social media and YouTube would win the election and still they thought Hillary and the Dems would win. Today the former is still true which is why there is a full campaign to censor conservatives on YouTube and social media.

970388068552261632 2018-03-04 19:58:39 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @infowars It seems CNN with it's poor ratings are using their capabilities and connections to censor you folks as a type of click bait to raise their ratings
968713669453516800 2018-02-27 05:05:11 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DRUDGE_REPORT How dare the sun call "it" a "he"

968336966159872000 2018-02-26 04:08:18 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @SethMacFarlane As a firefighter, I go to work knowing that this could be my last day. Life safety is paramount not only for ourselves but the public as well. but it is the job we signed up for.
967669666683412480 2018-02-24 07:56:41 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec Why ask a survivor of the incident, why not ask a victim or family of?
967595062438719488 2018-02-24 03:00:14 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DRUDGE_REPORT Nice, maybe if someone explained to Em and the liberals what a Republic is it would be a lot more beneficial for the present and future?
967473792229388288 2018-02-24 18:58:21 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews His medical provider should consider admitting him into a facility. Sounds like he may take his life
967447871044726786 2018-02-24 17:15:21 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @Cernovich @Delta Let's say for the sake of the argument that NRA members do boycott Delta to a significant amount. How would Delta recover their losses? #yourbusinessyourchoice
966141873461997569 2018-02-20 02:45:47 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DewsNewz Where I'm from we had a county wide MCI/IED/HAZMAT drill going on throughout on the same day and I told my kids to expect anything and to take any warning seriously. It's Erie how whenever a drill occurs an event closely follows!
966140563077476352 2018-02-20 02:40:34 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec @veggiemelt @virbow1 Welp,  probably because Michael isn't a Communist?

966107510213033985 2018-02-20 00:29:14 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @AP Because the executive branch creates law right?
965975067816374273 2018-02-20 15:42:57 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews That's weird, she said "shut up and dribble" which doesn't seem racist to me. Then he says "dribble these nuts bitch" which, if the former was racist would be too but also sexist right
965599876590419972 2018-02-19 14:52:05 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @zerohedge It probably was the dick pills, he was definitely slaying some ass out there in the Olympics village
965599328478707712 2018-02-19 14:49:54 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @thehill Instead of making new laws, we should enforce the laws already on the books.
965451100001255424 2018-02-18 05:00:54 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews I thought he was gonna say... Of unconsciousness... My mind would have been blown
965427678537895936 2018-02-18 03:27:49 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews Best part is, if you follow basketball, most people think Durant is a sell out for going to a championship team instead of building one hinself which is I think he is pandering to his viewers.
965427161107644416 2018-02-18 03:25:46 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews Wierd thing is, I'd say he's ignorant for thinking that if someone says "shut up and dribble" it's racist

964880768739688448 2018-02-17 15:14:36 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @benshapiro I read something somewhere about a $5 Indian,  does anyone know what that is?
964880487696052224 2018-02-17 15:13:29 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @LionelMedia I wonder what the view and Joy has to say about Oprah's comment on running?
964879321998311424 2018-02-17 15:08:51 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec Well, according to Cuomo."that information is illegal for the public to read, only the MSM can see it" and further more, the Russians!
964877313924984834 2018-02-17 15:00:52 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews Bills ratings are lower than CNN, and he's on HBO. people actually pay and dont watch him
964770213777457152 2018-02-16 07:55:18 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews I was wondering where he was going with the whole thing. I get it now though, ahhh "washes hands" good onepic.twitter.com/VecghM1EuT
964767472803921921 2018-02-16 07:44:24 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @AP @TracieLiberty @matt_poulton Yeah but somehow the FBI was not able to ID him

964645910742319104 2018-02-16 23:41:22 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews Yeah because he's directly in charge of making legislation.
964645500854026241 2018-02-16 23:39:44 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews Truth is, I don't think LeBron knows what Trump said. He, like most on the left, are pandering to the majority of their viewers.
964643754945658880 2018-02-16 23:32:48 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @StefanMolyneux Imagine "Everytowns" numbers when the JROTC begin their riflery season?

964319707837947906 2018-02-15 02:05:09 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @seanhannity Which is the reason to why the MSM is fawning over NK. They want us to look like animals when we retaliate to NK provocation

963646134756536320 2018-02-13 05:28:36 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews At this point all the POTUS should do is say, if your free and interested, your invited! And leave it as that
963605809576910849 2018-02-13 02:48:22 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @PrisonPlanet She said when he was in Korea he should show respect, all the while shes in America disrespecting the President and VP
963605025103622144 2018-02-13 02:45:15 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews The first time I heard the saying "liberalism is a mental disorder" I though it was a great punchline. But the more I listen to these people I realize it isn't a joke.

962203510245748737 2018-02-09 05:56:08 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @Cernovich @CollinRugg Thing is JK should debate Ben. If he thinks he's in the right, he'd be able to speak his mind/ points and then let the cards fall where they may. Truth is, I don't think ABC or NBC, whoever is hiring him, will allow him to.

954381307890450432 2018-01-19 15:53:30 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @RonPaul From RP point of view he is correct. Taxes cut, de-reg good... But, foreign policy issues pertaining to stance on regime change and civil liberties haven't changed. If he can get his supporters to tell POTUS this is what they want to see. Maybe a change can be made?

953060921160613888 2018-01-15 00:26:45 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @GrrrGraphics @GeorgiaDirtRoad So the left will spin not attending which is fine with me, but guess what, Trump will spin it as saving money for a thousand + $/head event. He could even donate food to charity and say it was from those allotted funds that didn't attend
952991912184590336 2018-01-15 19:52:32 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @MittRomney Your probably worth as much if not more than Trump, so it's safe to say that You weren't elected because you're disingenuous and fake not because you're one of the elite.

952438999959748608 2018-01-13 07:15:27 UTC <BIGPAPA967> I love the term shit hole. So I'm gonna use it liberally #shithole
952368488240234496 2018-01-13 02:35:16 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @jack @JackPosobiec @JamesOKeefeIII If the Pulitzer wasn't such a scam now a days I'd say you deserve about 7 of um.
952362557515247618 2018-01-13 02:11:42 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @MsBlaireWhite Well then your a Bigot 
952358676613947394 2018-01-13 01:56:17 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @Holbornlolz Wow, why would they do that. They turned that store into a real #shithole
952357327503376384 2018-01-13 01:50:55 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @LindseyGrahamSC @PrisonPlanet @RealSaavedra Looks like Winston hasn't been doing his job in the Ministry of Truth.
952300146083078144 2018-01-13 22:03:42 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @GovHawaii @BraddahBoots Not only that, he had no idea, which means there wasn't a scheduled test!
952299743257927680 2018-01-13 22:02:06 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @GovHawaii So no "Tests" were scheduled which means it's obviously a rogue employee or official who activated the emergency alert. Although I have a feeling that it'll be blamed on faulty military equipment. Which won't make anyone in HI feel better. But hey it's Trump's fault
952292232257708032 2018-01-13 21:32:15 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @StefanMolyneux @PrisonPlanet Not sure if it was a hawkish statement but it was obvious that the left was gonna use Trump to push their agenda. One saying we need to attack the other blaming him for NK nuclear ambitions.
952290870681726976 2018-01-13 21:26:50 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec @KatrinaPierson Sorry, the "Credibility in the broader black community" statement has nothing to do with being trustworthy and truthful but hey...
952275256386793472 2018-01-13 20:24:48 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @MarkDice Chances are it was a mistake. With that being said, who benefits most from this outcome?
952274423813255168 2018-01-13 20:21:29 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @PrisonPlanet This just in... It was Trump's fault...
951985866536230912 2018-01-12 01:14:52 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @LionelMedia Ok so pee pee gate went on for months and the left things this'll be the same?
951864286678196224 2018-01-12 17:11:45 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @jayleno @seanhannity Sorry, I may have missed something, but did he say those things or nah?
951843930424852482 2018-01-12 15:50:52 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @PrisonPlanet Wasn't this supposed statement leaked last year around this time? I vaguely remember it when Haiti came up in the news a while back
951841041568559104 2018-01-12 15:39:23 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @TomiLahren 16 months ago, very few people believed and trusted the MSM(and this is before Trump was POTUS)  but today it seems that the people want to so bad.  Truth is, to the MSM 2 + 2 doesn't equal 4 or 5 or 3. It equals whatever they tell you it equals.
951833656628207616 2018-01-12 15:10:02 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DRUDGE_REPORT Don, are you growing out your afro?

950975441170448384 2018-01-09 06:19:48 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @realDonaldTrump @AnnCoulter As much as I agree with your statement, I'm gonna hold off on what gets pushed through. We all seen what happened with ACA . It took tax reform to kill it.. eventually
950927626729766912 2018-01-09 03:09:48 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DRUDGE_REPORT Is that Billie Jean holding stone like it's her date?

950626162463551488 2018-01-08 07:11:53 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @brianschatz Truth is you should've done this before Obama's EO. But hey I have a pen and a phone right?

949668805189427202 2018-01-06 15:47:41 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @brianstelter Right, he's so un-Presidential. You know what else is unpresidendtial? Keeping a promise!!!

949342759084687360 2018-01-05 18:12:06 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @PeterSchiff Yup, what a fool. He should've created more fed jobs to compensate
949308893766631424 2018-01-05 15:57:32 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @Cernovich @jeremymbarr His base followed him knowing he was Anti-PC.   Some say its not Presidential. Guess what else isn't presidential? Keeping your promises. Take him as he is.

944277362232848385 2017-12-22 18:44:01 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @zerohedge I always wondered why they stopped with the calexit talk 6 months ago! Makes sense now

942846403268636672 2017-12-18 19:57:54 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews CNBC poll: Trump at 29% favorablity

942410589623558144 2017-12-17 15:06:08 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DRUDGE_REPORT RINOs who stone walled @POTUS  at every turn will be hanging the hat on his name looking for his endorsement. He should tell them "drop to their knees, and they will" because they're weasels!
942245346658234368 2017-12-16 04:09:31 UTC <BIGPAPA967> The narrative out of @MSNBC and @HardballChris .  " in light of the surfaced allegations, I will be stepping down, but if I should so should Trump"
942151051087462400 2017-12-16 21:54:49 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DRUDGE_REPORT So that's why Hillary had her own servers. It all makes sense now
941932988060745728 2017-12-15 07:28:19 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @infowars Duh, they're able to give him death threats w/ impunity because net neutrality was disband. If it were still here(like 2 days ago) he'd never experience this!
941772266760630272 2017-12-15 20:49:40 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @POTUS @SpeakerRyan @RepAdamSchiff It went from collusion to meddling? Okay. Once that fell apart the next step was to use the me too movement which is falling apart as we speak with today's report on Lisa bloom which is why you are pleading to keep this investigation alive. Dem should be careful what they ask for
941435788897554432 2017-12-14 22:32:37 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @SenSanders So this will allow for Monopolies to form? Don't they have an anti-trust act for that?
941411423929774080 2017-12-14 20:55:48 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @zerohedge "that has affected my community and my people"??? Looks like @BrookeBCNN  and "your people" were having a good laugh at your expense yesterday 
941404146531426305 2017-12-14 20:26:53 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @netflix Why would a business be upset if net neutrality would make you company cheaper to the public?
941382869678559232 2017-12-14 19:02:20 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @MittRomney I could have said, 'Mitt, drop to your knees.' He would have dropped to his knees."
941380639466463232 2017-12-14 18:53:29 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @MauiNOW ACA made health care less affordable, The Patriot Act was the complete opposite. It's hard to believe the Net Neutrality would make the net more of that.

941112109227655168 2017-12-13 01:06:26 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @zerohedge Didn't think about it this way but makes sense, they got used to the QE buy backs. Why wouldn't anything change? Hope they can add something into the legislature to discontinue this bonus buyback garbage.

939638181196021761 2017-12-09 23:29:34 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @maxkeiser Why do I feel like the clock is ticking for tomorrow release of futures?

939147837714993152 2017-12-08 15:01:07 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews I give them credit, they finally pivoted from attack their own to the president. They will use this as their  only platform for 2018 and 2020. Won't work though.

936863074664964096 2017-12-01 07:42:17 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec My question is, what do they expect out of Flynn? What's his word worth after he pleaded Guilty of lying to the FBI about this? Is he credible now? Wouldn't a defense attorney attack that?

935261728094298112 2017-11-27 21:39:06 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DRUDGE_REPORT I hear Trump identifies as a native American so that statement wasn't racist.

932978979463618561 2017-11-21 14:28:17 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec Question is, what does SNL consider "appropriate behavior"

Wouldn't that be contrary to Trump's push on unemployment. If taxes rase on middle wouldn't more be unemployed? and receive hand outs. Just wondering

913422161154416640 2017-09-28 15:16:28 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews Kind of hypocritical. With that logic he should give up his coaching job, he only got it because he's born white. Correct?

911663750473687040 2017-09-23 18:49:10 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @RonPaul I get it RP, POTUS is wrong. but when should a private org. enforce this? When they lose $1/2Bil? Wouldn't free market be demonized then?
911408372540358656 2017-09-22 01:54:23 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @Cernovich @ScottMGreer Would it be cheaper and effective, a brick and mortar wall or a fence?
911382117891817472 2017-09-22 00:10:04 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @politico I hear Russia was involved in creating the NH voter law which allowed  anyone to vote there
910643353645080576 2017-09-20 23:14:29 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec @realTanyaTay Personally, I like Michelle because she was packing Lol

910197432746573824 2017-09-19 17:42:33 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec I usually watch cable news when @MarkDice  is destroying them.
910177287420526593 2017-09-19 16:22:30 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JoeBiden Funny because when my children saw you on stage groping another man's wife they said, "WTF is wrong with this guy"
909966285060030464 2017-09-18 02:24:03 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews Idk if a golf ball hit Jennifer in the face or a hot shovel.
909929478926696448 2017-09-18 23:57:48 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @ArthurSchwartz "Everyone knows there's no such thing as wire tapping anymore."  Wasn't that what the MSM said when POTUS claimed they were wiretapping him?
909679483174535169 2017-09-18 07:24:24 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @NewtTrump SCOTUS is the most important. These positions will need to be filled in the very near future & unlike Leg and Exec Branch they last for life
909571593138954241 2017-09-17 00:15:41 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec I dislike both T&M  but this is Fake news. Supposedly we  cannot get out of PCA until 2020. Isn't it smarter 2 make a better deal.
909504640458166273 2017-09-17 19:49:38 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @StefanMolyneux Didn't Trump tweet that Scotland yard should have had this guy before the bombing and the left and London went ape shit over it?
909334799487082496 2017-09-17 08:34:45 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @libertytarian You know better than I do, but if Congress passes a bill at 2/3 and Trump veto's, wouldn't it pass anyway when it goes back?
909267129471459328 2017-09-16 04:05:51 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @RealSkipBayless Only winner is the UFC. Dana White is laughing at Oscar

908885204516749312 2017-09-15 02:48:13 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @StefanMolyneux Top google search for articles on DACA come from CNN WAPO CNBC NPR. Should I use caution when reading these? #FakeNews
908883725856804864 2017-09-15 02:42:21 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @Cernovich @ananavarro How dare you speak positive of trump. Don't you know he's a sexist, xenophob, racist/nazi. I'm never voting for who you support again.
908882948979433472 2017-09-15 02:39:15 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @washingtonpost @MarlerCharlie @AlDeSanta @babsbruno Sorry if I offended you, but a good majority of professional athletes cheat on their spouses when away. Y wouldn't they speak that way?

908781147378696193 2017-09-15 19:54:44 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @PressSec @Cernovich @CBSNews On one hand, no one should tell a private company what they should do. On the other, the NFL should make a  team hire Kaepernick #hypocrisy
908727499089051648 2017-09-15 16:21:33 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @realDonaldTrump Can't wait to hear the MSM who just a week ago said "don't let a good tragedy go to waste" complain.
908713251155742720 2017-09-15 15:24:56 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec The guys given daily briefings by all the intelligence agencies yet CNN thinks he is wrong.#FakeNews
908711654472302592 2017-09-15 15:18:36 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @maxkeiser If it were regulated, would the sec find out who it was?
908487240082321408 2017-09-14 00:26:51 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec Please Paul keep hanging yourself someone with morals can take your place
908397888245399552 2017-09-14 18:31:48 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @joyceonair @AnnCoulter 2. The real tragedy will be when everyone goes back to sleep in 2021 or 2025.
908397579339051008 2017-09-14 18:30:34 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @joyceonair @AnnCoulter 1. For the past 8 yrs the media, Leg. and Jud. Branch and the people stood down. Now with Trump they're working, even if against him.
908379215942230016 2017-09-14 17:17:36 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec Maybe this will light a fire under their asses
908376462692048896 2017-09-14 17:06:40 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @AnnCoulter What should be done on the deserters
908366895920713728 2017-09-14 16:28:39 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @realDonaldTrump @StefanMolyneux True.With the right in control of the HOR I wonder which legislator will cave. Trump still has the power to veto. Who knows what will happen
908155250900590592 2017-09-13 02:27:39 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @LannyDavis @kayleighmcenany @seanhannity I hear she wanted them to do as Winston did in 1984
908152801540300800 2017-09-13 02:17:55 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @StefanMolyneux I can't wait to hear rice and the left call CNN fake news.
908152013673848832 2017-09-13 02:14:47 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @Cernovich DACA should be legislative not an EO. But the HOR are hopeless and they know that, and they're pissed. This'll prove how weak they R
908140505183141889 2017-09-13 01:29:03 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @Cernovich They'll probably be more peaceful than anitfa
908134366336786432 2017-09-13 01:04:39 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @PrisonPlanet Had he made the same tweet and substituted HC with DT he'd be celebrated on CNN not in jail. Am I missing something?
908048837146640384 2017-09-13 19:24:48 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec Soooo, no collusion with the campaign?

907755067251367936 2017-09-12 23:57:27 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @RealJamesWoods And then in the next breath says slavery was a black mark in American history
907612874469662721 2017-09-12 14:32:26 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DRUDGE_REPORT From antifa, with love

907353784585568257 2017-09-11 21:22:54 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @PrisonPlanet That's a great idea dudes will kill each other from within
907089207121797121 2017-09-10 03:51:34 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews Why is it that POTUS and Nancy are the only ones manspreading and the others are cross legged. Maybe they identify as swamp creatures
907087764004397056 2017-09-10 03:45:50 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews McCain believes his meeting with Isis leaders were for humanitarian relief.

907024629516034053 2017-09-10 23:34:58 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec Why do both of their necks looked jacked up? I mean, I know Nancy is old as shit but Kamala looks torn up

906619265570107393 2017-09-09 20:44:11 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BBCtrending @jennabean Umm, I'm not sure if you noticed, but they spent  all of one sentence in the last paragraph to talk about it. Smh, this is sick
906540129161854977 2017-09-09 15:29:44 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec Dude looks lit AF
906539926786732032 2017-09-09 15:28:55 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @redpilldanny The Japanese wouldn't, they give two shits about isis because they have a zenophobic immigration policy. Right?
906539254821425152 2017-09-09 15:26:15 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @ABC 93% of comms are body language and tone but in this case it's facial expressions.
906410455798767616 2017-09-08 06:54:27 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews Sessions is exposing himself as weak and it's sad that we were expecting better from him.
906173345216864257 2017-09-08 15:12:16 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @maxkeiser @Crypto_God Manipulation is rampant but I find it odd that it took a dive like this especially when the talk in the US was to remove the debt ceiling.
906172487976624128 2017-09-08 15:08:51 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @realDonaldTrump @BreakingDTrump @impeach_d_trump Or like Obama, tell them you have a pen and a phone and just submit Executive orders and say   fuck the Constitution. Right?
905818290987057152 2017-09-07 15:41:24 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec I'd smash
905679726299103232 2017-09-06 06:30:48 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @StefanMolyneux @APWestRegion Good let it go to the SCOTUS and it'll show how Obama made unconstitutional EO's.
905621958187823104 2017-09-06 02:41:15 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @StefanMolyneux The left/MSM have been on an all out assault towards POTUS. It seems pointless but he's pandering to get them off his back. Won't work tho
905620679772356609 2017-09-06 02:36:10 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DewsNewz Mouth wouldn't do her even on his worst drug binge day!
905570636432424960 2017-09-06 23:17:19 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews With all the pride for their heritage you'd think they'd be chomping at the bit to build up their home country. Idk maybe it's just me?
905529193185787904 2017-09-06 20:32:38 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews If they are so great and productive like the MSM touts, why don't they go back and build up their home country/heritage?
905308100470517760 2017-09-05 05:54:05 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @StefanMolyneux Sad thing is, if it is unconstitutional the judicial branch should do their job. If it somehow is legal, the legislative branch should do it
905221293594689536 2017-09-05 00:09:09 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @SenJohnMcCain @Cernovich @MintPressNews Guy in the backs like, "Ohhh shit it's about to go down"
905220225875849216 2017-09-05 00:04:54 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec @nlanard For argument sake, let's say this is the best of Latin America . Why wouldn't they want to go back and build up their homes?
905219206806777856 2017-09-05 00:00:51 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews I don't support his statement which means, he's a white supremacists/Nazi/Bigot/ RACIST/_____________! Feel free to fill in the blank.
905116058914140161 2017-09-05 17:10:59 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews Its fall from Grace landed it squarely on its face. I guess make up does do wonders.
905114650747953152 2017-09-05 17:05:23 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @StefanMolyneux The legislative branch creates law which is what Obama did with his EO. So yes it is the Congress who should do something about this.

903649508147339264 2017-09-01 16:03:26 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @PrisonPlanet I swear they (media) were reporting that the Blacks and Hispanics would be disproportionately impacted in this hurricane.
903160382855946240 2017-08-31 07:39:49 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @PrisonPlanet And the EU laughed at Brexit
902990232605270016 2017-08-30 20:23:42 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @Cernovich Ok, but... Were they Obama holdovers?

902765875249471490 2017-08-29 05:32:11 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @GregWest_HALOJM But but but but they're racist
902736548860387328 2017-08-29 03:35:39 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews She knows, soon as P. Trump is called a Nazi CNN will forgive her.
902628451827433472 2017-08-29 20:26:07 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews Right, if Trump kept to Paris Accord there wouldn't have been a 2017 hurricane season
902609181437394944 2017-08-29 19:09:33 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec Well, the MSM's  pissed that she's gorgeous  and isn't packing like the last one we had===D
902607926350684160 2017-08-29 19:04:33 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JxhnBinder They're pissed she's not packing like the last one we had
902607629352017920 2017-08-29 19:03:23 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec So wait, she supported DWS proudly? She is a swamp creature if the biggest kind
902549583774998528 2017-08-29 15:12:43 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DRUDGE_REPORT I called this 4days ago. They'd never let a tragedy go to waste.
902383931860819968 2017-08-28 04:14:29 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec Whether Trump fully supports strange or not I'm glad bannon is there to support someone other than a swamp goblin.
902337216868843520 2017-08-28 01:08:51 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews If an honorable politician(with an USA 1st agenda)became president, would you support him? I guess an "honorable politician" is an oxymoron!

902075325638574081 2017-08-28 07:48:12 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @StefanMolyneux Reminds me of the idiots I went to school with who thought if they changed a word no one would think they copied each other's homework.

901654651992281088 2017-08-26 03:56:35 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @brhodes @bigscott7722 Was Snopes the website the MSM said would be used to fact check the web?

901207463243825152 2017-08-25 22:19:37 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews Which means he'll be fired soon
901185862582493184 2017-08-25 20:53:47 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @owillis After landfall MSM will say Man made global warming caused this and Trump is at fault

901163031110983680 2017-08-25 19:23:04 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews Like his presidency, he'd F up what ever he tried and would only hurt the left
900929142245310464 2017-08-24 03:53:40 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @SheriffClarke I think he passed on the option in 2015. Facts, he makes poor decisions and when a team wins or loses a game at 1 position it makes sense.
900872249640538116 2017-08-24 00:07:36 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews Hypothetical? He's illegal stay on scene gets deported and returns in a month. He stay on scene and goes to jail for 10 years?
900842417837953025 2017-08-24 22:09:03 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DRUDGE_REPORT If North Korea criticizes Trump wapo will publish it. Sad outfit called fake/irrelevant news
900785743311720448 2017-08-24 18:23:51 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews There is definitely a war on common sense.
900754864287895552 2017-08-24 16:21:09 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec Streisand effect#mindblown
900744394424238080 2017-08-24 15:39:33 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DRUDGE_REPORT Is it because they'd look like hypocrites?
900740413266382849 2017-08-24 15:23:44 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec What's Infowars? I've never heard of that. Maybe I should go check it out
900560574932590594 2017-08-23 03:29:07 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @JackPosobiec He's lucky the national anthem wasnt playing because Kaepernick would've still been on his knee
900474718762942465 2017-08-23 21:47:57 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @Allblackmedia Not sure how it's a set up especially when UFC would've made big $ on miocic Jones fight
900462771975798784 2017-08-23 21:00:29 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DRUDGE_REPORT Would
900191875826458625 2017-08-22 03:04:02 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @SheriffClarke Gotta love how FOX shows a pic of him getting dropped by Ali (especially with his backstory). It's obvious with the pic where fox stand.
900191103944507397 2017-08-22 03:00:58 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews It's only now that I realize they who Bobby Lee swagger was
900060574704320516 2017-08-22 18:22:17 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @AnnCoulter @JackPosobiec Would love to here the media narrative on a video of someone burning the antifa flag
900059301888237573 2017-08-22 18:17:14 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @realDonaldTrump @SheriffClarke Why does Secret Service need to protect Trump tower? Because the violent left has already proven, they will destroy anything they oppose.
900037610587824128 2017-08-22 16:51:02 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DRUDGE_REPORT That ring will probably be worth more than Brady's
899774948826267648 2017-08-21 23:27:19 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @lloydblankfein I believe you meant "was" I'm not sure though, you may have been speaking about something else.

899504155827380224 2017-08-20 05:31:17 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DRUDGE_REPORT Isn't that the point Trump was making?
899426070285271040 2017-08-20 00:21:00 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @GrrrGraphics "cankles" haha
899425789854138368 2017-08-20 00:19:53 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DRUDGE_REPORT And ship in hundreds of his paid supporters
899425289264025600 2017-08-20 00:17:54 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @BreitbartNews Duh, Trump support is hate speech.
899338001242664960 2017-08-20 18:31:03 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @Cernovich "hard to keep your cool" but somehow when people go ape shit they're deplorable/far right
899306138709008384 2017-08-20 16:24:26 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @PrisonPlanet In the sake of being "owned", if Nazis(national socialist) aren't socialist, are Antifa (anti fascists) fascist?

899067247582355456 2017-08-19 00:35:10 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @RealAlexJones We love our liberals, we love our goblins, oh they're so good oh they're so sweet
898629438820163584 2017-08-18 19:35:28 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @AnnCoulter @StefanMolyneux The media has been successful in their attack on the anti-establishment, maybe bannon can do more from outside the WH?
898593389632864257 2017-08-18 17:12:13 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @RealAlexJones @PrisonPlanet Why do I feel like some dudes gonna try to run him over?
898247692912009216 2017-08-17 18:18:33 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @PrisonPlanet I see the point but this will snow ball into something much bigger if you give them any ideas
898017576252358657 2017-08-16 03:04:09 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DineshDSouza Take it down, and his legacy of the FED as well
897905959141494784 2017-08-16 19:40:37 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @DRUDGE_REPORT Just a heads up, they will go after the Alamo soon

897903964007440385 2017-08-16 19:32:41 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @realDonaldTrump @jimmykimmel What's funny is, if you folks don't do anything about the EC(which you won't) Trump will be my president again in 2020! Bwahahaha
897653587224010752 2017-08-15 02:57:47 UTC <BIGPAPA967> @brianschatz I voted for U in the past, I've called Ur office with 0 response. Tulsi has been quiet for a while &'s still more relevant than u#neveragain
