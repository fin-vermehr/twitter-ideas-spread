958446440270856192 2018-01-30 21:06:53 UTC <TheSwenty> @ATT Since @ATTCares doesn't care, maybe you can help.  I have 3 bad Uverse remotes and even though I was told one was on the way over a week ago, it never got to me.  Think you can make this happen?
958159693045669888 2018-01-29 02:07:27 UTC <TheSwenty> @ATTCares can you please answer my DM?!?!?  FFS Ive been waiting on a simple U-verse remote for over a week. Now another one is acting up. Might as well replace all 3

936017457805893632 2017-11-29 23:42:06 UTC <TheSwenty> @DucksNPucks @DucksFam93 Maybe work a hybrid Gulls/Ducks one

935929908949270529 2017-11-29 17:54:13 UTC <TheSwenty> @DucksTalkShow Think tonight has the makings of a historic blow out.....Guess those Vegas odds about having the most points at the end of the season are out the window....
935337474028482560 2017-11-27 02:40:06 UTC <TheSwenty> @DucksFam93 I stand corrected.  Perry had a CF% of 55.56. Guess he was better then I thought.
935337306747052033 2017-11-27 02:39:26 UTC <TheSwenty> @AnaheimCalling Perry had a 55.56???!!??  Really?  Wow.  Didnt seem like that to the eye. But Im sure its just me being salty....be nice to play hockey with the top 6 we figured we would have.
935336837005971457 2017-11-27 02:37:34 UTC <TheSwenty> @DucksFam93 Tonight
935336771369385984 2017-11-27 02:37:18 UTC <TheSwenty> @DucksFam93 Ritchie was the only forward that stood out..Grant and Perry are no better then Rasmussen and Liambas.
935335223876714497 2017-11-27 02:31:09 UTC <TheSwenty> @ducks_family Gulls are out of Centers, and forwards, and D-Men....
935334841763094528 2017-11-27 02:29:38 UTC <TheSwenty> @DucksFam93 Wasnt trying to say Crawford was good.  Was pointing out how AWFUL our forwards are
935333603591962624 2017-11-27 02:24:43 UTC <TheSwenty> @AnaheimCalling At some point, the lack of the forwards to posses the puck should be faulted.  Think its unfair to continue to blame the Dmen for having to work harder then the 12 forwards.
935333161956884480 2017-11-27 02:22:58 UTC <TheSwenty> @DucksFam93 Not with this line up. Crawford would have to have his water swapped for Vodka....pic.twitter.com/j6G3vVOawd

930994021651976192 2017-11-15 03:00:46 UTC <TheSwenty> @icemancometh @dontduckup Good point.  Should have thought about that. Was too annoyed by the idea of playing 7 D men (considering the traffic cones that are Beauch and Holzer)....I stand corrected.
930990073633415168 2017-11-15 02:45:05 UTC <TheSwenty> @icemancometh Play montour as a forward. He actually can skate and score....

928100717834813442 2017-11-07 03:23:49 UTC <TheSwenty> @AnaheimCalling Swear to fucking god, the worst fucking luck this year.
928031061363146752 2017-11-07 22:47:01 UTC <TheSwenty> @Duckscolorman Can visors be mandatory for our best player?  Lol.
927758255849271301 2017-11-06 04:42:59 UTC <TheSwenty> @packers @SportTakess Not with this staff. Would probably draft another DB and not develop them...
927757827547938817 2017-11-06 04:41:17 UTC <TheSwenty> @packers @parishmt Game plan?  Point it out for me because I missed it...

927724942606479367 2017-11-06 02:30:37 UTC <TheSwenty> @GBPackchat Dont stop at Capers. Entire staff and front office have failed. Draft picks havent been developed.
927723560017084416 2017-11-06 02:25:07 UTC <TheSwenty> @RyFo18 This team is soooooo bad.  Worse thing is, Packers may get a top 10 pick but not replace the coaching staff or front office,So thats wasted
927715129562611712 2017-11-06 01:51:37 UTC <TheSwenty> @packers Fucking lack of coaching staff and front office being able to develop talent...

919399122460753920 2017-10-14 03:06:47 UTC <TheSwenty> @DucksNPucks At this rate, they could practice it against an empty net and still not score...
919046485819383808 2017-10-13 03:45:31 UTC <TheSwenty> @DucksTalkShow Its a bold strategy, lets see if it works out
919046148416987136 2017-10-13 03:44:11 UTC <TheSwenty> @DucksTalkShow Thats suboptimal
919038205587988480 2017-10-13 03:12:37 UTC <TheSwenty> @DucksNPucks Might be something to that 8 shots and 4 goals tweet.

742184256768610304 2016-06-12 02:38:10 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit honestly thought you might give it a chuckle.  See I was wrong.  Me, signing off

734536318269706241 2016-05-22 00:07:59 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit #Fact.
734533716060573698 2016-05-22 23:57:39 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit that's on litigators. Make a living off convincing people to sue. Honor is lost among most people.
734529059258916864 2016-05-22 23:39:09 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit those are things that I would expect government to fix. Travesty.
734528422093815808 2016-05-22 23:36:37 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit sometimes one can't fully fathom what's required and how expensive it is. But I imagine (hopefully) this gets fixed over time
734527426844184576 2016-05-22 23:32:40 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit if defer to your experiences then. I, for one, wouldn't care if somebody was in a chair. Can you do they job is all that matter
734526539224748032 2016-05-22 23:29:08 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit hahahahaha. Not true. I work in an ATC facility. We did a little construction and had to put Braille plates as room ID's. Lol
734525934766694400 2016-05-22 23:26:44 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit DoD has thousands of jobs that font require combat skills. Lol
734525822887940096 2016-05-22 23:26:17 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit I know, but I'd rather there be something else in place for those like you. Your not an invalid.  You work.
734525222716481536 2016-05-22 23:23:54 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit god yes. Hate lawyers.
734525103061540865 2016-05-22 23:23:26 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit well, my daughter just got hers and it was almost free. Amazing what happens when you serve. American youth don't get it
734524886329135106 2016-05-22 23:22:34 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit true that. I would have been way more open had he included Vocational Trades. Need welders as much (more) then lawyers.
734524618866720768 2016-05-22 23:21:30 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit you might be surprised. Of course, so could I.
734524330176970752 2016-05-22 23:20:21 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit sorry, that was a swipe at "free college" from Bernie. Feel there would be a lot of Art majors. Opinion only
734524077461757954 2016-05-22 23:19:21 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit and neither will ignoring the millions of armed Muslims that want to kill
734523759919529984 2016-05-22 23:18:05 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit I will say giving everybody access to a free Art degree doesn't fix anything
734523545699508225 2016-05-22 23:17:14 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit what would I have done if I was Obama?  Not sure. Muslims have hated each other (Sunni and Shiite) for a long time
734522702879428608 2016-05-22 23:13:53 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit World isn't black and white.
734522352957022209 2016-05-22 23:12:30 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit But Obama didn't learn.
734522188364029952 2016-05-22 23:11:51 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit Who said we didn't??  Assumptions were made based on intelligence that was given from Iraqis. They lied.
734521721160491008 2016-05-22 23:09:59 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit The regular person has zero concept of how much damage they would do
734521603166330880 2016-05-22 23:09:31 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit so, we (the US) should just pull back?  Great idea.  Let's do that.  And along the way, we will tell Israel we are out
734520928160342017 2016-05-22 23:06:50 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit would love to wake up and read "World looks to Muslims and asks why do you let the small percentage cause so much damage"
734520654217773056 2016-05-22 23:05:45 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit US against all Muslims. World loves that concept. Makes it easy to cast blame
734519440314748928 2016-05-22 23:00:55 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit personally, if a person WANTS to be an elected official, they are probably evil. Hahahaha
734519161263652864 2016-05-22 22:59:49 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit Europe and Canada should do what's best for their citizens. Leave the US to ourselves. Obama spent to much time kissing ass
734518925321482240 2016-05-22 22:58:53 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit I have no doubt that the world views us negatively. I, as a US Veteran, couldn't care less.
734518487582965764 2016-05-22 22:57:08 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit I'm not picking any fights here nor do I begrudge anybody's opinion (I'm fiscally conservative) but Bernie is done.
734514215658999808 2016-05-22 22:40:10 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit enjoy Canada if it is the style you like. Once America destroys itself, good luck defending your self.
734513979402260481 2016-05-22 22:39:13 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit Bernie doesn't have a valid plan. NONE of his ideas would ever get through Congress.  Same can be said for Trump.
734513718780792832 2016-05-22 22:38:11 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit problem is, those who hate capitalism, do so because it can be corrupt. But so can elected officials.
734513251610853376 2016-05-22 22:36:20 UTC <TheSwenty> @BuckyHermit like I said, I hate myself.
734472869946609664 2016-05-22 19:55:52 UTC <TheSwenty> Ok, I'm going to hate myself for this...Explain https://twitter.com/buckyhermit/status/734452018228535296

726098111639117824 2016-04-29 17:17:34 UTC <TheSwenty> Can they fire the captain too??  And how about that Alternate captain that scored as many goals as Bruce?https://twitter.com/icemancometh/status/726083821192404992
