942557027779465216 2017-12-17 00:48:01 UTC <IsaacSchrantz> @pmilla_4 Not enough to make me not understand the catch rule 
942555624566640640 2017-12-17 00:42:27 UTC <IsaacSchrantz> @pmilla_4 Exactly, no one touched him until he was in the end zone. What declared it a non-catch was the loss of possession all the way to the ground.
942554717691006976 2017-12-17 00:38:51 UTC <IsaacSchrantz> @pmilla_4 But no one touched him when his knee was down which allowed him to reach over the end zone. If the knee marked him down, he would have been short of the plane anyways.
942554047856377862 2017-12-17 00:36:11 UTC <IsaacSchrantz> @pmilla_4 Who said it was wrong. Clearly he did not have control of the ball all the way to the ground and the refs did their job. The catch rule is not difficult to understand.

852162266283868161 2017-04-12 14:11:31 UTC <IsaacSchrantz> @tooflybry1 What I'm saying is free throw shouldn't hold that much weight that it would completely take you out of MVP race

852156306358185984 2017-04-12 13:47:50 UTC <IsaacSchrantz> @tooflybry1 I dont think he's boosting his own stats, rather doing what other players on his team can't. And it IS called M-V-Player not M-V-Team player
852120640404508672 2017-04-12 11:26:06 UTC <IsaacSchrantz> @tooflybry1 It takes a couple of good players to win. Look at Jordan and Lebron. Needed pieces to start winning
