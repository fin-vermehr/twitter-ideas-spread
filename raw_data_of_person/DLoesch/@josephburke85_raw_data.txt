780877645932273664 2016-09-27 21:11:53 UTC <josephburke85> @AJT_15 @BobbyPerr1 Exactly, equal pay for equal work, gender should not be a factor.
780860123027804160 2016-09-27 20:02:15 UTC <josephburke85> My favorite line from Hillary last night, " [Trump] has said women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men". Exactly!
780804030507384832 2016-09-27 16:19:22 UTC <josephburke85> You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. Somehow Harambe did both. http://fxn.ws/2dzlOBV @benshapiro
780620811245846528 2016-09-26 04:11:19 UTC <josephburke85> @benshapiro so is Hannity going to be his press secretary or co-commander in chief?

775877630755151872 2016-09-13 02:03:36 UTC <josephburke85> Really loving this 3 democrat presidential race. What ever happened to republicans wanting smaller government?
771338748441264129 2016-09-01 13:27:43 UTC <josephburke85> People should have to wear "I voted Trump/Hilary" shirts if they voted for them in the primary like the scarlet letter because this sucks...

763571360715141120 2016-08-10 03:02:53 UTC <josephburke85> Does Trump get jealous when Hilary does something stupid and then he has to try to one up her?
760826302064713729 2016-08-03 13:15:00 UTC <josephburke85> Can Trump step down and Hilary go to jail so we can restart this awful election?

708866547079446528 2016-03-12 04:05:29 UTC <josephburke85> Hopefully there are no rallies in the Middle East during the @realDonaldTrump presidency because he will just hide in the green room
705582660119298050 2016-03-03 02:36:29 UTC <josephburke85> If Trump just yelled nonsense ( which he does most the time) then said "make America great again" these morons would still cheer.
705476345183268865 2016-03-03 19:34:02 UTC <josephburke85> Not sure how @realDonaldTrump is going to survive the debate tonight against the fierce, relentless Megyn Kelly
