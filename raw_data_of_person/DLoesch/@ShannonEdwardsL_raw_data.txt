971042866549215238 2018-03-06 15:20:35 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @DLoesch How about a VP that votes to defund Planned Parenthood? That says smoking doesnt kill? That wont meet with women unless mommy is present? That voted against no child left behind Christian my ass.

970813037048459264 2018-03-05 00:07:19 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @joshtpm Wtf? Social welfare. Social warfare. Cut it, IRS.
970811421507321856 2018-03-05 00:00:54 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @joshtpm Right? How does this organization, the NRA, engaged in political lobbying and advocacy, but this cannot be its main activity, and it must be related to the groups primary mission and the issue upon which its tax exemption is based, according to the IRS. Social welfare!
970811417719918594 2018-03-05 00:00:53 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @DLoesch What a snowflake. No one wants to run into an at-15! storm of bullets. Except, maybe you and trump. Wed like to have our lives back, thanks.
970796057947975685 2018-03-05 22:59:51 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @womensmarch @DLoesch Pure propo and hyper negative social influence. How does NRA keep social welfare non profit status!
970658766524944386 2018-03-05 13:54:18 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @JudicialWatch How dare the government watch people who conspire against our country? Youre filing suit against them? Only in America...

968585784394567680 2018-02-27 20:37:01 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @PrisonPlanet Conservative? Im old enough to remember when that didnt equate to white nationalism. Fox is openly pro-disinformation. Its a national disgrace.

968254847819501568 2018-02-26 22:41:59 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @DLoesch @NRA @katneosen @boyinabubble @mikey3799 Also, at least one of the people youre replying to lives in the UK.
968254604101140480 2018-02-26 22:41:01 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @DLoesch @NRA @katneosen @boyinabubble @mikey3799 Hmm theyd all be wearing uniforms, so theyd be less likely to shoot each other, (unlike the poor churchgoer in Amarillo who wrestled a gun away from a shooter and was then shot by cops because he was then holding the gun) but no. Im for keeping AR-15s for the military.
968173375334969344 2018-02-26 17:18:15 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @UnderSecPD @DeptofDefense @StateDept @statedeptspox Does that mean the joint cyber safety plan with the Russians is off? We can admit its Russians = Foreign influences, right?

People in other developed nations dont live with schools as shooting ranges. They dont live with daily gun violence. The failure of critical thinking and the almost religious gun rights worship is breathtaking, in the face of these dead kids.

966538003899297792 2018-02-21 04:59:52 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @DLoesch @NRA @katneosen Gun free zones. Like the White House, or, other places where politicians work?  Give it up. We are the only advanced nation where this hsppens. The. Only. One.
966525571751542784 2018-02-21 04:10:28 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @DLoesch @NRA I mean, I know its expensive buying senators, but how about those schools? Those kids.
966525093122793472 2018-02-21 04:08:34 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @DLoesch @NRA Teachers with guns. Yeah. Is the NRA going to pay for that? Training, EMT training too, obviously. Hazard/combat Pay? How about we start with making sure they pencils, and reasonable class sizes, and ban all weapons that can be used to kill dozens of school kids in minutes.
963595247308521472 2018-02-13 02:06:24 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @KenDilanianNBC Why does everyone refer to it as meddling, like Putins Scooby Doo? Our elections were hacked by a hostile foreign power.

959455663675068419 2018-02-02 15:57:10 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @robinhobb I feel emotions are reactive and instructive.

917117447701979136 2017-10-08 20:00:13 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @POTUS @VP Disrespecting soldiers, flag and country is dragging them into Twitter Trolling when you don't understand peaceful protesters.

911784494352392192 2017-09-23 02:48:58 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @RadioFreeTom Erm. You notice how two of those three profit from their own labor?

910708854958125061 2017-09-20 03:34:45 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @MalcolmNance @soledadobrien Right. This is a lie. Grow a spine. This is nonsense and backwards.
910705884996575232 2017-09-20 03:22:57 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @thehill Poor Russia! 
910703986298150913 2017-09-20 03:15:25 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @RadioFreeTom It should never have come to light. Even if she noticed it. And it was wildly anti-democratic and pro-Russia.

907809222028439552 2017-09-12 03:32:39 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @RadioFreeTom R's in both houses still support free-press undermining, intel service bashing, ally-alienating, Putin boot-licking  idiot.  Advice?
907808772537511936 2017-09-12 03:30:52 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @RadioFreeTom Right.  Kobach in NH. Only nutters care what he does. Not like we have a problem.
907803144247164928 2017-09-12 03:08:30 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @thehill Irresponsible congress unanimously agrees to virtue signal while supporting free press undermining, intel bashing, ally fucking nazi.

906712477085327361 2017-09-09 02:54:35 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @ProfDBernstein The pain! But wait, we didn't elect the guy who stood at CIA wall and said "we'll take your oil next time" (great for people in the field?)
906354715071356928 2017-09-08 03:12:57 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @MikeStuchbery_ I like your approach. 
906354448309485569 2017-09-08 03:11:54 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @MikeStuchbery_ Should we punch them in the face or dress up like clowns and mock them peacefully?
906354271142109184 2017-09-08 03:11:12 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @MikeStuchbery_ Just like the argument that Nazis shld walk through our streets unopposed.  This is where we talk. These are our avenues. So the question is
903840911053938688 2017-09-01 04:44:00 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @UmlandAndreas @WarOnTheRocks Tell it.

903813569380179968 2017-09-01 02:55:21 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @jaketapper You do great work.  This seems Daily Mail/Fox themed.
903782681183371264 2017-09-01 00:52:37 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @RadioFreeTom @jenniferholton7 Wow.
903778785085886464 2017-09-01 00:37:08 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @MikeStuchbery_ You apologize? Fighting nazi-fascist disinformation online is THE most important use of historical knowledge. The swearing is good, too.
902745849935020032 2017-08-29 04:12:37 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen Still sdmire the conviction of your profile pic.
902745122114158592 2017-08-29 04:09:43 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen I'm done.
902744950927802368 2017-08-29 04:09:03 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen What. Sperm?  Egg? How far afield of science do I have to go before you agree it's a bad idea to make accessible repro health & contra ok?
902742062159740932 2017-08-29 03:57:34 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen Supporting both means acknowledging how important PP is for poor. Instead, it's defunding or regulating out of existence. Good luck.
902724808017829888 2017-08-29 02:49:00 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen With respect, this is clearly an attempt to derail my earlier comments re:cause and effect. Can you agree that sex Ed, contraception are ok?
902712965660422145 2017-08-29 02:01:57 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen Logically false, since it's also taking out affordable contraception and healthcare.
902702620124495872 2017-08-29 01:20:50 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @benjaminwittes Thank you for MSNBC appearance.  Articulate, fact based and succinct.

902035722361638912 2017-08-27 05:10:49 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen Affordable healthcare and contraception, I should say. Let's see how that works out for your demographic in say, twenty years.
902034438850191360 2017-08-27 05:05:43 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen Do you really think making it illegal or unavailable will make it less tragic? It won't. Only education and prevention, and good care will.
902033997907206144 2017-08-27 05:03:58 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen Nice personal pic, btw.
902032609722621954 2017-08-27 04:58:27 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen Look, you already had it so PP couldn't use fed $ for abortions. Now it's just removing health care and contraception. Big win!
902031752985640960 2017-08-27 04:55:03 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen Do you recognize the humanity of the born, or not?
901708332896894976 2017-08-27 07:29:54 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen What's worse, someone who doesn't care what happens to children after they're born, or someone who takes away basic healthcare from moms?
901622575091990528 2017-08-26 01:49:07 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen The caring bit would ring truer, if, after they were born they weren't 'anchor babies'  or born to 'welfare queens'.
901619997780221952 2017-08-26 01:38:53 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen Defunding and legislating into non-existence, Texas, Ohio... big wins, right?
901618780651921408 2017-08-26 01:34:03 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen De-funding PP left large swathes of America without affordable contraception, but also without all other repro care.
901617453041557504 2017-08-26 01:28:46 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen Do you think you should choose for everyone else? Are you willing to raise their children?
901613136674922496 2017-08-26 01:11:37 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @jaketapper I'm local. Thought I knew how bad he was. I didn't. This would be great time to talk about what Joe Arpaio has done.
901442426983677952 2017-08-26 13:53:17 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @MikeStuchbery_ Thanks for making me laugh! 
901303287986569216 2017-08-25 04:40:23 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @GreatDismal @aimeemann I think it's because he wasn't covered enough. Maybe. Anyway, they're rounding people up here, in my neck of the cactii.
901301986665963521 2017-08-25 04:35:13 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @allegrakirkland @AdamHSays Tent city in a Phoenix summer, where they were forced to wear pink underpants.

901288221883080705 2017-08-25 03:40:31 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen You know that there is the option of prevention, right? Part of education and care? Miss the caring part? Dismembered or...
901287026296733696 2017-08-25 03:35:46 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @SethAbramson Americas shame, snuggling gollum.

901273131356049408 2017-08-25 02:40:34 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @realDonaldTrump @RealSheriffJoe You're a criminal blot on our courageous officers. You should spend six months in tent city in Phoenix summer, in pink underpants, you toad.
901261647477489664 2017-08-25 01:54:56 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @RadioFreeTom After trump, Republican will never be an option for me. Vote my conscience in a 2-3 party non-preferential system based on feasibility.

900084462318477312 2017-08-22 19:57:13 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @DavidCornDC Not a joke
900075865203200004 2017-08-22 19:23:03 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @DavidCornDC By terribly, this means pulling them over because they are brown, and sentencing them to summer, in a tent, in Phoenix in pink panties.
900075033963499520 2017-08-22 19:19:45 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @StateDept Right.
900042450491895808 2017-08-22 17:10:16 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @RoundSqrCupola Lol! Well considered response.
900041653603500032 2017-08-22 17:07:06 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @RoundSqrCupola @asymmetricinfo Do you seriously think people tearing posters in response to ppl taking their repro rights away is censorship?
900004650987945985 2017-08-22 14:40:04 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @holland_tom @LukeSewell93 Also about not providing public focal points for resurgent nazi groups. 40,000. Anti-nazi protesters in Boston warms my heart. But, costly.
899363187035955201 2017-08-20 20:11:07 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @AppreciatesNick You're wrong. My first mammo and Pap was at PP.
899362146945052672 2017-08-20 20:06:59 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen Great. What are you prepared to do about it? Increased sex education? Adopting everyone's babies? Thinking?
899362146945048576 2017-08-20 20:06:59 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @bee_flippen PS. I'd never abort. I don't agree that you have the right to choose for everyone else.
899352475664343040 2017-08-20 19:28:34 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @AppreciatesNick Perfect example. PP Provides (provided) mammograms, Pap smears, prophylactic care for millions. You want fewer of us?
899350569193754625 2017-08-20 19:20:59 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @AppreciatesNick Riiight. When you can afford them. PP is affordable repro health care for those that don't have other choices. Think.
899346491323686913 2017-08-20 19:04:47 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @RoundSqrCupola @MckinleyDHughes That would be never. Talk to me when your willing to assume responsibility for someone else's parental rights b
899342308272898049 2017-08-20 18:48:09 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @RoundSqrCupola Nope. As I've said before, to you-violence not the answer.
899341783511031808 2017-08-20 18:46:04 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @RoundSqrCupola @MckinleyDHughes Talk to me when you're willing to adopt everyone - and I mean everyone- else's child.
899341204743221248 2017-08-20 18:43:46 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @AppreciatesNick Think. Should healthcare be limited to crises? How about Pap smears, breast health checks?
899341204541894656 2017-08-20 18:43:46 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @AppreciatesNick How's your prostate? How'd you feel if I matched against your ability to get ev n minimal care?
899339990051819520 2017-08-20 18:38:57 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @RoundSqrCupola @crashfrog The problem is since they can't get that, they've regulated affordable repro care out of existence. Win, right?
899338239294799872 2017-08-20 18:31:59 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @RoundSqrCupola I was just thinking the same of you. !
899338239261257730 2017-08-20 18:31:59 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @RoundSqrCupola I actually do, and would never abort. But I recognize that I don't get to decide for others, even if I'm willing to adopt & raise their baby
899336197608275970 2017-08-20 18:23:53 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @RoundSqrCupola Right. Not your uterus at all. Not like, say, your gun! 
899335426091216896 2017-08-20 18:20:49 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @RoundSqrCupola Some animals think they are more equal than others, and get to decide which uterus bears, when?
899335409741778946 2017-08-20 18:20:45 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @BobTinari Assuming you're not scoring cheap points, I'd point to legislation in Ohio, Texas, etc, and defunding planned parenthood. Wins, right?
899333666115129345 2017-08-20 18:13:49 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @RoundSqrCupola Riiight. You Think I want to take away your guns. I don't. I Know they want to take away my repro rights. About as fundamental as it gets.
899333180234375168 2017-08-20 18:11:53 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @RoundSqrCupola @asymmetricinfo Even when they're nazis intent on controlling you're reproductive rights? Cmon. You want them in charge of yours?
899332555366948864 2017-08-20 18:09:24 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo Hm. Freelance isn't something I associate with horrible totalitarian governments. (Or, tearing posters)
899332555341692932 2017-08-20 18:09:24 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo Taking away someone's health care, and repro rights, that's pretty horrible.
899328787539795970 2017-08-20 17:54:26 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo Censorship is what authority does to those it disagrees with. This is free speech and assembly, with deplorable violence.
899327363552604162 2017-08-20 17:48:46 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo @RoundSqrCupola I don't think repro rights are political. I think it's medical, and mine. Violence is never the answer. But..thought police in this context?
899326670917730307 2017-08-20 17:46:01 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo Only with cars, and if they attend a counter-hate rally. NO! Violence is not ok. Neither is deciding other people's repro rights.
899322425833402368 2017-08-20 17:29:09 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @bdomenech @asymmetricinfo Pro-lifers have killed affordable access to health and reproductive care in many areas. Thought police. Really.
899314216460582913 2017-08-20 16:56:32 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @RadioFreeTom Bad day when POTUS to DOJ makes punching Nazis seem like the right, most important thing. I get it, and I know this is the worst answer.

898251651844366337 2017-08-17 18:34:17 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @StateDept That's great. Would you consider allowing the US to have an actual State Department at some point? Couldn't hurt, right?
898240512116871169 2017-08-17 17:50:01 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @RadioFreeTom You sort of have to forgive the rest of us for thinking so.  CIA wall speech, dismantling State Dept. Fake News! Some KKK guys are ok..

894434695525482496 2017-08-06 05:47:03 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @Khanoisseur I think this is true. I also think that if you think this is all bad, you've never been a caregiver for family dying slowly & in great pain.

874031665596715008 2017-06-11 22:32:42 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @Emilinalala I can understand having a war with a state that sponsors terrorism, but a war on terror? Doesn't that give the legitimacy of statehood..
874031345277612032 2017-06-11 22:31:26 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @Emilinalala While shouting 'God is great' a terrorist? Doesn't it just serve to terrify us?
874030997532061697 2017-06-11 22:30:03 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @Emilinalala All mass murderers seem insane to me. Sanity and religion aside, why call a guy in a drive-by a criminal and a guy who does the same thing..

873742273455955968 2017-06-10 03:22:45 UTC <ShannonEdwardsL> @RadioFreeTom Never heard the wokey folk say brown is terror. Heard all killers are criminals & 'war' on terror gives statehood & validity to criminals.
