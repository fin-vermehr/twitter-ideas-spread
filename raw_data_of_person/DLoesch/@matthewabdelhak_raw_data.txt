926994990584225793 2017-11-04 02:10:03 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JoshTaylorHD Rolling rock is good ass beer. And that beard is also sweet.
926976976178630656 2017-11-04 00:58:28 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Yea. Florida LSU are like the Texans or something you can never go that long and win with horrid qb play. No telling how bad it could get.
926976395816955904 2017-11-04 00:56:09 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 And LSU is gonna score 0. Lol. I was thinking earlier Id take LSU +12.5 or something. I usually know better lol
926900244910104576 2017-11-04 19:53:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Haha
925883386274738189 2017-11-01 00:32:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rtjr Agreed. Its dumb.

925526154555088896 2017-10-31 00:53:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @MarkKaboly Same. Dont like any alcohol. Wine especially. Lol.
925524242506100736 2017-10-31 00:45:49 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd @Kmalbanese They do suck at drafting they have had like 14 picks a year since like 07 its ludicrous really. But Id still take the picks.
925520915655479302 2017-10-31 00:32:36 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd @Kmalbanese Or just being retarded?
925520861389520897 2017-10-31 00:32:23 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd @Kmalbanese Are you trolling?
925508327215427585 2017-10-31 23:42:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd Finally someone said it. You can draft a good qb by trading those picks on draft day. You already know what McCarron is.
925504514840555520 2017-10-31 23:27:26 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @AB84 Admirable. But the curl needs to get longer anything less is uncivilized.

921460341946580993 2017-10-20 19:37:20 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @L_bell26 Yes. Best yet finally a good background. You can rap well but need the help of a dj bad.
921411964433248256 2017-10-20 16:25:05 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Best move theyve made since not trading for cutch 
921098989998694401 2017-10-19 19:41:27 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ThePoniExpress Ive had the chickenpox and shingles I am 30. Ive never had mono though so I ultimately win.

919740111331438592 2017-10-15 01:41:45 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @geoffschwartz Its amazing the broncos havent had an offensive stinker against them yet.

919576563036893184 2017-10-15 14:51:52 UTC <matthewabdelhak> It just truly hit me Donald Trump is the person most unfit to be president ever. And about have the country is completely insane......
919571786840395776 2017-10-15 14:32:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Of course woody Allen feels bad for Weinstein/ warns of witch hunt. He was caught on tape though. Hands off playa.......

919499860327452672 2017-10-15 09:47:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @NissanUSA @SJAbdelhak Pretty safe bet.
919010167613808641 2017-10-13 01:21:12 UTC <matthewabdelhak> This extra character limit is screwing twitter. If you write 280 characters Im skipping it every time. Seriously, dont even glance at it.
919004738611499008 2017-10-13 00:59:38 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steel_Curtain4 I really dislike him so its mutual.
919000800713740288 2017-10-13 00:43:59 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Maybe itll be a nightmare where he goes to the Cubs or Astros. Probably.....
919000070758060032 2017-10-13 00:41:05 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Going to bed dreaming about the Pirates signing shohei otani.....sweet dreams everybody.
918923084509433856 2017-10-13 19:35:10 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @geoffschwartz 50 bucks a rapper pops up with this name in the next couple years lol
918890279205265408 2017-10-13 17:24:49 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Dat_Dude_Nix This is going to spread like wildfire 
918169495348350976 2017-10-11 17:40:41 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @nfldraftscout They also had like 14 picks in the first 4 rounds las year. My god it should have been super bowl but they try all these WR QB bull**** 
918168933542264839 2017-10-11 17:38:27 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @nfldraftscout Thats only through round 4. . They suck balls.
918168830723153921 2017-10-11 17:38:02 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @nfldraftscout Not really they just suck at drafting. For instance they could have taken Garrett Foster Tre White Jourdan Lewis Carl Lawson kittle etc....
917463199133335558 2017-10-09 18:54:06 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 
917461513803386881 2017-10-09 18:47:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @nfldraftscout Literally made me click on it lol. Congrats.
916862393053011968 2017-10-07 03:06:43 UTC <matthewabdelhak> But what if my dream is to have Kenta maeda coming out of the pen for the Pirates in the playoffs....
916758925839609857 2017-10-07 20:15:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH Rightfully so....
915280054619398144 2017-10-03 18:19:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @jgwentworth @DavidMTodd My brothers wifes dog used to howl every time they came on lol
915279677492690947 2017-10-03 18:17:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @geoffschwartz @MichaelDorso Yea. They both are elite qb runners can run misdirection plays. And both take care of the ball. They are exactly alike.
915279193503670273 2017-10-03 18:15:39 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @geoffschwartz I know damn. Kapernick and mariota even look alike and have many of the same qualities. Smh
915237723710963713 2017-10-03 15:30:52 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @937theFan @SJAbdelhak Its the fan. You should hear their radio programming. Commercials and updates 3X an hour. 
914958339443974144 2017-10-02 21:00:41 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @__bELIeve17 Youll catch on somewhere I think. You can get open. And can make plays n catch the ball. Maybe just not here cuz the Steelers have 40 wr
914943131765952512 2017-10-02 20:00:16 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JoshYohe_PGH I hope he makes it to 50. Julio Franco be damned.
914935030383771649 2017-10-02 19:28:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @SportsSturm @geoffschwartz @TaiwanDavis Yea he starts toppling over when ogletree comes in. Its true. I thought the same thing you did at first.
914934474261049345 2017-10-02 19:25:51 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @geoffschwartz Someone actually asked Ramon Foster how it was that he could possible block zone 
914934102276608001 2017-10-02 19:24:23 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @geoffschwartz Then again some analysts thought teams ran only zone plays Geoff lol.
914933563212140544 2017-10-02 19:22:14 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @SportsSturm @geoffschwartz @TaiwanDavis I dont mean to be a dick but yea. Ogletree spring in from that far off and jolting Donalds back is significant.
914932605354758146 2017-10-02 19:18:26 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @geoffschwartz Donald did have him going but the two human theory was definitely at play here.
914932426647973901 2017-10-02 19:17:43 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @geoffschwartz Like a team in wide splits and a dude sprints like 5 yards to down block a dude who is already engaged. And they will omg lol.
914932062016167939 2017-10-02 19:16:16 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @geoffschwartz I love how people who just study tape and didnt play the game dont notice stuff like this.
914930943466622976 2017-10-02 19:11:50 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @HannahCranston @kumailn Of course they would Kumail. And if an illegal shot someone. And so on and so on. They even incite violence. Smh
914928633764032517 2017-10-02 19:02:39 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Yea. A lot of these guys seem to thrive off that negative attention for some reason. And they get ideas from others/copycat. Smh
914927549553238016 2017-10-02 18:58:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 To be honest. Thats the most disturbing thing Ive ever seen in my life. Even more than 9/11. The fact that at any time 600+ could be shot.
914926442823155715 2017-10-02 18:53:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Well said Gavin. Between this and Puerto Rico so many could die in the name of party allegiance and terrible hobbies. Its a shame really.
914888223977066496 2017-10-02 16:22:05 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @geoffschwartz How did this man get into the nfl. 
914887611336069120 2017-10-02 16:19:38 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @CharlesRobinson Wow. He suuuuuuuuuuucccccckkkkkkkkssssss.
914884441578835969 2017-10-02 16:07:03 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ClayTravis But that is to be expected. You. Your president. Always looking to use tragedy for gain. Its good to know you take pride in being trash.
914883627078561792 2017-10-02 16:03:49 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @geoffschwartz @ClayTravis No. Clay. Its not friend. Your worldview is much more destructive. And your attempt at acting like this tweet is not political is pathetic.

911984821089574912 2017-09-24 16:04:59 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @nfldraftscout Honestly. Bad guessing. Not many men are 5'6".
911677733884788736 2017-09-23 19:44:44 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Yep. Actually could have won it all a couple times. An absolute shame.
911677261442580481 2017-09-23 19:42:51 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 That's the best pitt ever got by a long shot. Football was never even close to that or relevant. 8/10 top 12 tourney entries smh
911669936224862209 2017-09-23 19:13:45 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I look forward to it Gavin. I only wish I still listened to the radio.

910957311174291458 2017-09-21 20:02:02 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap There is a reason players wear gloves.
910956189604831235 2017-09-21 19:57:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap Fact is 120+ mph from Stanton will KILL a child.
910956070612475904 2017-09-21 19:57:06 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap I was also at that game where the lady got hit with the puck and died in Pittsburgh I'm almost certain my memory doesn't fail me.
910955711995236352 2017-09-21 19:55:41 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap I almost got hit by one of those as a kid it was smoked n spinning/curving didn't end up nearly where it looked like it was going.
910955374366400512 2017-09-21 19:54:20 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap It's ok Colin they want to victim blame. Have fun not taking your eyes off game ever. A lot of those balls go more than 105 spin n curve.
910950152298483713 2017-09-21 19:33:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @SamYoung4 Best of luck Sam!

909200115436486656 2017-09-16 23:39:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ClayTravis Yea there was like two dudes trailing into the end zone on the last second pass....oops
909177416140107776 2017-09-16 22:09:22 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @nfldraftscout @LB3PTMAN I like those comps I'd still take Allen though if he drops.
909174893371064321 2017-09-16 21:59:20 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rtjr It's ok joe west has a gizzard
909170008349126656 2017-09-16 21:39:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd If you like Tim tebow. I think he's a good guy but not so much on the aesthetics.

909167613854539776 2017-09-16 21:30:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Brett_McMurphy Congratulations on the use of seal-clubbing. Well done sir.
909162685199257600 2017-09-16 21:10:50 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Royals This is perhaps the greatest slide I've ever seen.
909162225088303104 2017-09-16 21:09:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Hopefully guys like Hamlin and ford can develope this year and turn into players. Need a new qb. Also, o-line could be terrible...
909161671351992322 2017-09-16 21:06:48 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Williamsisland4 Marino. Donald. Revis. Fitzgerald. Curtis Martin. Even Sheard, Boyd, Antonio Bryant, Dion Lewis/Conner. Molding players not the problem.
909160809833664512 2017-09-16 21:03:23 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @nfldraftscout @LB3PTMAN Ben was the third of that three. That's kind of how I feel about this class. People worry about Rosen's decisions but Eli makes bad ones 2
909156675545894912 2017-09-16 20:46:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @BobLabriola I wish he had told me that. Me too man me too....

909144905544593408 2017-09-16 20:00:11 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @nfldraftscout @LB3PTMAN Though I'm a Steelers fan so they will probably not get one. But if I was a fan of other teams I'd be pumped.
909144709246935041 2017-09-16 19:59:24 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @nfldraftscout @LB3PTMAN Definitely.
909143774177185793 2017-09-16 19:55:41 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @nfldraftscout @LB3PTMAN Yea. I like Jackson a lot too. 
909141911537057793 2017-09-16 19:48:17 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @nfldraftscout Yea. I would take any of the top three with a smile. And probably Jackson Rudolph n falk too albeit later on.
909140887413952512 2017-09-16 19:44:13 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @CNN @ClayTravis I love boobs too man. Way more than the first amendment. Lol.......

909107759169368065 2017-09-16 17:32:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @KGorman_Trib Whitehead n O'Neill only players worth a crap. Even quadree Henderson is very limited.
909107532307812358 2017-09-16 17:31:40 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @KGorman_Trib Pitt football n basketball are mid 90s bad. I used to games up at Pitt stadium on the hill. The sports program might actually be worse off.
908813869396742144 2017-09-15 22:04:46 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ClayTravis The fact that this is even close saddens me. Boobs all the way!!!!!!

908018980245446656 2017-09-13 17:26:09 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @nfldraftscout Reuben Foster will be back. And the nfl will pay for its insolence.

907721656914907136 2017-09-12 21:44:42 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @loumoore12 She is absolutely right. It's a shame it will never end man. They are literally insane people parading around as a superior race .

907716872153559045 2017-09-12 21:25:41 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @BrittMcHenry You got fired with half the network. Many of whom were better/more skilled than you. It was easy because of your negative public perception.

905139102542069760 2017-09-05 18:42:33 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @sgd5069 I bet piazza's parents could have their child's life back poor PSU frat boys a misdemeanor is just so harsh. Don't give the death penalty

904753070646681600 2017-09-04 17:08:36 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Leveon bell signed his franchise tag. So basically he got paid more than he's worth. I know one thing Conner is more of a man than him.
904515260694093825 2017-09-03 01:23:37 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @geoffschwartz Kind of like a reverse or double reverse. Let's run backwards and sideways n hand the ball off a bunch of times what could go wrong .

904447800947220480 2017-09-03 20:55:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora What do you think he pushes Davis over to more of a coverage role in subpackage.
904447481588715523 2017-09-03 20:54:18 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot What do you think he takes Sean's spot in subpackage and Sean plays more of a coverage role. Of course Sean plays SS most plays.
904123254096502785 2017-09-02 23:25:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap People who really like the smell of pipe tobacco and coffee. Their girlfriends probably think it's inconsiderate though.

903711594697379841 2017-09-01 20:10:08 UTC <matthewabdelhak> The nfl is gonna find a way to not reinstate martavis Bryant. Bet.
903711403135180802 2017-09-01 20:09:23 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Imagine how much of a dork bob nuttings wife must think he is or maybe he spends it all on her who knows

903710690409676800 2017-09-01 20:06:33 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Bob nutting is worth a thousand two hundred and fifty million dollars people.

903707598528143360 2017-09-01 19:54:16 UTC <matthewabdelhak> They should trade bell to the rams for gurley that would be tight. He break a 70 yarder a game. Offense more lethal than steph curry...

903706089925074948 2017-09-01 19:48:16 UTC <matthewabdelhak> The irony of Todd gurley saying leveon bell deserves 20 million is hilarious.

903668022849806337 2017-09-01 17:17:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 @AtomK13 Kontos burnett Liriano Martin etc...
903667913458102272 2017-09-01 17:16:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 @AtomK13 Point is that if you look at who he brings in he fails as much as he succeeds if not more. And the guys that are good you can see coming.
903667513694851076 2017-09-01 17:14:59 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 @AtomK13 But by all means glad to have s rod n his power bat back in the fold if only they still had Antonio bastard.....
903667101965176832 2017-09-01 17:13:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 @AtomK13 Jose Abreu is better than anyone on your list so is Justin Turner who the dodgers got off the waiver wire for 1 million initially.
903666230636236800 2017-09-01 17:09:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 @AtomK13 What if he'd have got Nelson Cruz like 3 yrs ago then....
903665994836713477 2017-09-01 17:08:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @AtomK13 @GavWill13 The idea of j hay n Mercer in a big time playoff game in a big at bat when you need a hit is literally why I don't buy the Pirates at all 
903665728246743040 2017-09-01 17:07:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @AtomK13 @GavWill13 Yea I know might as well have added Brock holt nova n Frazier lol. J Wilson played for the team like 4 yr ago. I'd rather have Blackmon
903664783395876865 2017-09-01 17:04:08 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @AtomK13 @GavWill13 I'd say j hay Mercer Wilson Burnett n happ are pretty average though with aj the only one having more potential.
903664025657118721 2017-09-01 17:01:07 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @AtomK13 @GavWill13 Oh and rivero and kang are nice too. But kang can't play so he should have done something.
903663754784772096 2017-09-01 17:00:03 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @AtomK13 @GavWill13 Yea. I'd cut that list to Cole taillon n bell at this point. Though Liriano and melancon were great.
903662267786379264 2017-09-01 16:54:08 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I know he sucks ass. Pomeranz only pitcher worth anything last year. Cashner just not a start which hurts his rep. Gennett cozart anything..
903661368666202113 2017-09-01 16:50:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 He's had cutch for eight years ten years of bad drafts NH is an imbecile
903660915769450502 2017-09-01 16:48:46 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Just thinking about kyrie heyward Tatum brown horford nets first overall pick nets first overall pick on the celtics has me steamed about it
903660616472285186 2017-09-01 16:47:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 When you think NH was given cutch Neil marte n basically polanco it really is disappointing he couldn't even add like four good players
903651481223663617 2017-09-01 16:11:16 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Danny ainge gonna trade jaylen brown for Anthony Davis once he gets the next two number one picks from the nets smh

899051141195063296 2017-08-19 23:31:10 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot I was too. I have come to realize foot speed isn't as important for interior o lineman lol. Also that was a horrid draft.
898715993442205696 2017-08-18 01:19:24 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Better yet stew lol like rb

898626099457867777 2017-08-18 19:22:12 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Shop412 @BuccoSharkTank That's awesome.
898402197758656512 2017-08-17 04:32:30 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Ha. Yea he's a dickhead so I don't mind telling him stuff like this.
898401594277888000 2017-08-17 04:30:06 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Surprised you didn't tell him you are a corporate lawyer when he said you had too much time. Dudes a dick. I found that tweet in 2 minutes.
898401037676982273 2017-08-17 04:27:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Benoit sucks Hudson sucks bastardo sucks Leblanc sucks how bout that
898400881825021953 2017-08-17 04:27:16 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I talked to you about it on here too. Hilarious honestly. The Pirates are a joke. I think gennet n cozart players he said suck just homered
898400531810443266 2017-08-17 04:25:52 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Took a flyer on Benoit (not really) didn't work (obviously) move on. Oh and cutch is washed up. And Neil Walker too.
898400058629947392 2017-08-17 04:24:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 You see you just type in wade Leblanc and scroll down for like two three minutes tops and there it is. And studdy huddy sucks too.
898007128648040448 2017-08-16 02:22:38 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @nfldraftscout I'll just say I'll take him over Kyle Orton till death. Above the neck who knows.
898006796153085953 2017-08-16 02:21:19 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @nfldraftscout Ha you can't give up on that merely on athleticism. What round who knows. What you want on your team who knows. But he's a heater

896466291329867776 2017-08-12 20:19:54 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @michaelshure Do you think Trump would start ww3 just so he could be emporer forever I do he's that STRANGE. Mr. Magoo leads us now
896464843581947904 2017-08-12 20:14:08 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @michaelshure That dude who ran protesters over killed someone. No big deal though

895462187166187521 2017-08-09 01:49:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Haha if you just take away like 14 games he been as good as Bryan Morris
895080555963969536 2017-08-08 00:33:28 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I love Andrew mccutchen good god.
895051556621619200 2017-08-08 22:38:15 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot It's awesome really 
895049577367318528 2017-08-08 22:30:23 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot And this coming from someone who cried like a little bitch after the AFC championship loss to the chargers 23 years ago.
895049280238612480 2017-08-08 22:29:12 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot Haha. I admire how much you like football actually.
895046589210931200 2017-08-08 22:18:30 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @__bELIeve17 Hopefully all turns out well Eli.
895044084703920128 2017-08-08 22:08:33 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @BBCNews What a punk. He was probably mad because even after all that jogging he's still got bitties aka (bitch tits or saggy estrogen sacs). 
894694480271605760 2017-08-07 22:59:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 @CannonballCrner You were obviously trying to act like Hudson hasn't been bad.
894694241930182656 2017-08-07 22:58:24 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @EASmallwood @GavWill13 Yea. A reliever with a 3+ era if you do this and this.  I would rather have went into the minors or trade for scooter gennet and cozart
894692462022754304 2017-08-07 22:51:20 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 @CannonballCrner Daniel Hudson hasn't been good even when he doesn't take Ls or give up runs he almost does he is terrible and not nearly worth 5+ million
894691995280650240 2017-08-07 22:49:28 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Yea and rum bunter is an asshole. They would find some reason to defend a guy with a 10 era. So childishly silly and out of touch really.
894691354416173061 2017-08-07 22:46:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Why even try and defend Hudson at this point it's so dumb. Rum bunter n some of those other guys are just nerdy pricks.
894691054003343360 2017-08-07 22:45:44 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 He has like six losses and so many other times he's been terrible why we couldn't have got pat neshek or j will but Pirates lol
894690496597110784 2017-08-07 22:43:31 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @CannonballCrner Haniel dudson
894690365978152960 2017-08-07 22:43:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 When stat nerds who tell you era doesn't matter use the most bullshit era stat ever lol
894312460081139713 2017-08-06 21:41:20 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Hahaha. Wow.
894311094860349440 2017-08-06 21:35:55 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Neal keeps trotting a team out there where freese has the 3rd highest ops he either doesn't get it or bob nutting is a dork
894259027974270978 2017-08-06 18:09:01 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @KGorman_Trib @BiertempfelTrib Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
894256494362980352 2017-08-06 17:58:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @nfldraftscout I like jay cutler too.
894249441280086017 2017-08-06 17:30:55 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Come to think of it I bet he has a direct line to Neal for all baseball decisions only plausible explanation
894248530319114241 2017-08-06 17:27:18 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Exactly that's it studdy huddy only responsible for about 6 losses. But cutch gotta go. Show me the meadows.
894247527125573632 2017-08-06 17:23:19 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Rum bunter will surely chalk it up to the fact that you NEVER can really know if a guy will work out. Look at Leblanc.
894207208027717633 2017-08-06 14:43:06 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap It's a buncha over the hill adult males living out their last shred of athletic glory who cares what happens it's not friggin march madness
893911882599469061 2017-08-05 19:09:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Boooooooooo Pirates booooooooooo
893907799209644032 2017-08-05 18:53:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Yea he's solid. Alex Avila just smacked a homer for the Cubs. So I guess enjoy pulisic hahaha
893907427262947328 2017-08-05 18:51:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Boooooooooooooooo
893907262753918976 2017-08-05 18:51:14 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 How do you feel about George Kontos acquisition
893906741469089793 2017-08-05 18:49:09 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Ur right though he prob won't bat .162 forever lol smh

893905589587365890 2017-08-05 18:44:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 At least you can watch him while the Pirates sign trash

893565916620783617 2017-08-04 20:14:50 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ThePoniExpress You're damn right boooooooiiiiiiiiiiiii
893560994886242305 2017-08-04 19:55:17 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot @gerrydulac Yes. Yes. Yes.
893531376867258369 2017-08-04 17:57:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @TribLIVE Yes. Yes. Yes.
893267885581361154 2017-08-03 00:30:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 We have nine starters none of which can be traded lol I kid I kid
893258285704523776 2017-08-03 23:52:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Haha lol
893257811609735169 2017-08-03 23:50:32 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Oh and marte really sucks when he doesn't hit or hbp the mans plate discipline is never coming
893257619565105152 2017-08-03 23:49:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Draft picks and maybe wake up Neal I just hope they don't trade Cole or something crazy
893256944680673281 2017-08-03 23:47:06 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I hope they lose out tbh
893254293758906370 2017-08-03 23:36:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot It would be a much better place tbh
892862648106315776 2017-08-02 21:40:18 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora Old and trusted. Efficiency at its finest. Kind of like the Alex Smith of midsize sedans.
892813564460847104 2017-08-02 18:25:16 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Sethrogen Holy fuck this statement makes me want to off myself.
892538081965883393 2017-08-01 00:10:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 It's an opportunity though the jays have to see the end coming but maybe they plan on spending though. Yea it will literally NEVER happen
892537542712717313 2017-08-01 00:08:27 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I'd love Donaldson and stroman for everything in the minors pretty much well not all but a lot.
892536613506621441 2017-08-01 00:04:45 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I believe one guy can change a lineup like if you put Donaldson with bell cutch polanco kang marte meadows j hay freese Mercer I'd chance it
892536187436617729 2017-08-01 00:03:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I think it would over the long run. Kang Scooter gennet cozart Quintana Tehran anyone get Jaso off the bench and definitely moroff
892535685030260741 2017-08-01 00:01:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Like Eugenio Suarez 3b with power .257 career avg .743 career ops why would it kill them to get a guy like that so bad man
892533102198837248 2017-08-01 23:50:48 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Just add a bat and an arm every once in a while for gods sake.
892532815488831494 2017-08-01 23:49:40 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I do agree that Huntington is a bad drafter. But nutting is the main problem. I can't be convinced otherwise.

892121443160469505 2017-07-31 20:35:01 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JoeStarkey1 Joaquin Benoit looks like the devil though so maybe he doesn't really have a 4.07 era.
892121169595334656 2017-07-31 20:33:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JoeStarkey1 No joe you ain't missing much lol last 30 yrs man lol not much at all......

892109521270820864 2017-07-31 19:47:39 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @EdBouchette He should flush it down the toilet. Like ed bouchette an old worthless ball sack
892092829404626944 2017-07-31 18:41:19 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Oh god I know this is not going to end well
892092630049456128 2017-07-31 18:40:31 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I'm just glad he didn't take a pitcher worse than aj Cole for cutch
892092463564951552 2017-07-31 18:39:52 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Good old Neal Huntington man.....
891836291553341440 2017-07-30 01:41:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora Yea he looks like he jammed someone real good on Steelers twitter. Hopefully his athleticism translates. Thanks.
891834106560090113 2017-07-30 01:33:15 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora How did keion look today Alex
891819009208987648 2017-07-30 00:33:15 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Yup.
891818167403773952 2017-07-30 00:29:54 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Cole probably ends the yr leading the team in wins 2 lol. Makes no sense at all how yinzers follow media narratives. Like sheep on a highway
891816688588640258 2017-07-30 00:24:02 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 He batted like 260 with decent pop people are idiots.
891493945578057730 2017-07-29 03:01:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Tony Watson upping his trade value tbh
890774912985640960 2017-07-27 03:24:23 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I really hope the Pirates trade for Donaldson and stroman a perfect opportunity really

887019861284708352 2017-07-17 18:43:09 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Sounds like a map of average IQ scores for the American public. Almost exactly lol.
887013538442747906 2017-07-17 18:18:02 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap How bout you go like 60% that's probably what I'd do anything more would burn me out
885936998359474176 2017-07-14 19:00:14 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steigerworld @LLysowski @Dejan_Kovacevic @MarkKaboly You probably. That's not a hard title to win though tbh.
885224643824627718 2017-07-12 19:49:36 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Republicans are the only thing stopping human beings from a better existence......the devil practically.

884574682145591300 2017-07-10 00:46:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I saw the mph on espn my god that's a fastball lol
884573599587237889 2017-07-10 00:42:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Giancarlo smoked a 121 mph liner at those kids 
884566464988164101 2017-07-10 00:14:14 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Haha
884135668397608960 2017-07-09 19:42:24 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Nothing suspicious is going on and nothing can be done about it. #FakeGlobalWarmingFacts
883120351089221636 2017-07-06 00:27:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 His numbers are surprisingly Pedro like a bit better though and I just don't see him as Pedro. His numbers are dragged down by this year
883119114495172609 2017-07-06 00:22:59 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Oh come on gav I usually agree with you on most things but this take is a bit drastic
883117216677363712 2017-07-06 00:15:26 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 But marte and polanco look like that at times n look how they went but I have faith in josh most of all as an average hitter
883116985411940352 2017-07-06 00:14:31 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I just think he could be a good hitter with power and adequate d not as good but compareable at least
883115914157326337 2017-07-06 00:10:16 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I'm sure his average will be good in the future
883115776546414592 2017-07-06 00:09:43 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 It's like when Rizzo had a bad second year lots of homers but he was batting .375 his first year bell might become the teams best hitter
883114930207064064 2017-07-06 00:06:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I dunno gav josh bell has 16 hrs before the break can hit for avg and is becoming a good defensive first baseman
883114184988389380 2017-07-06 00:03:23 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter Dare I say it I think he can become comparable to Rizzo
883113823149985792 2017-07-06 00:01:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @MarkKaboly He really is gonna be good Mark.
883044740555350016 2017-07-06 19:27:26 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I do think Anderson Davies Guerra garza and jungman are slightly better pitching than they have had in past years though
883044116698943488 2017-07-06 19:24:58 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 They did this a couple years ago too so I'll wait
882349860195893250 2017-07-04 21:26:14 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @YankeesPR @BabeRuthMuseum @NationalGuardNY @RedSox @Yankees @rumbunter @theaceofspaeder Someone should show this to Donald Trump so he can get a glimpse of when rich men were still men.......
882295044375547905 2017-07-04 17:48:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @VinnyVidiVici98 To me revis and Deion are the best ever with pp not far behind.
882294832156336131 2017-07-04 17:47:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @VinnyVidiVici98 The only thing that gets me is ed. But put a young Woodson at free safety with revis and Deion and then Troy at SS hard to go against that.
881960938118799361 2017-07-03 19:40:48 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @937theFan @ROOTSPORTSPIT @Pirates Woooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

881301196547510272 2017-07-01 23:59:13 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Agree.
881298881639796736 2017-07-01 23:50:01 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Dudson pitching to posey what could possibly go wrong 
881297400685621248 2017-07-01 23:44:08 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Cmon dudson do ur job.
881296842180501505 2017-07-01 23:41:55 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Nvm

881282819238047744 2017-07-01 22:46:12 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Brutal this yr and last. Maybe the worst I've seen.
881282416568143875 2017-07-01 22:44:36 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Like sub .080 average this year and last the worst.
881282170068848640 2017-07-01 22:43:37 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Max moroff has just been terrible with the Pirates.
881273081330839553 2017-07-01 22:07:30 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @CannonballCrner He always seems to do that for some reason.
881271391055736836 2017-07-01 22:00:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @CannonballCrner Hurdle seems to always want to give guys the game completely off with no pinch hitting.
881267006061805568 2017-07-01 21:43:22 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Nice

879883079699050496 2017-06-27 02:04:08 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I predict they lose 12-2 now.
879882814002540545 2017-06-27 02:03:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> The Pirates man what can you say. Two years in a row of this sheer brutality now.

878785689051070466 2017-06-24 01:23:29 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter Cole is so good man. People who slander him need smacked and blocked. 3.34 career era lol.

878445751025664000 2017-06-23 02:52:42 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I am looking forward to Ryan Reaves absolutely punishing some fools at pens games this year.
878444749258141696 2017-06-23 02:48:43 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rtjr I like your name Haniel dudson it's awesome also am a fan of dud Norris lol
878443043132755968 2017-06-23 02:41:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Haha it's just funny he absolutely sucks. And they hated nova said he was right handed Jeff Locke. How? He is like 7 foot and Dominican.
878442550549504002 2017-06-23 02:39:59 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Not at all lol. But the FONeal loved him.
878442062596755457 2017-06-23 02:38:03 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 In other news Daniel dudson and dud Norris are still those guys that everyone swears are good but NEVER actually are.
878441845487001600 2017-06-23 02:37:11 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Reaves has one goal in 36 playoff games lol
878439050503487490 2017-06-23 02:26:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I'm less mad about the reaves trade would have rather kept the pick. Daniel Hudson still sucks though.
878437900647628800 2017-06-23 02:21:30 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Daniel Hudson and Ryan Reaves just fucking great......

877314765017755648 2017-06-20 23:58:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter True
877289744517955584 2017-06-20 22:19:09 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I might have traded him but maybe not for Lopez.
877289376870535168 2017-06-20 22:17:41 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Yea I might have went a different way but who knows
877288922967134208 2017-06-20 22:15:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Pg and a center in Lopez. Brook Lopez's value is debatable though.....
877288669421469697 2017-06-20 22:14:52 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Clarkson better on d than Russell but you still could be right Russell is pretty good already although most people can't see it
877288451007270912 2017-06-20 22:14:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Lonzo ingram Clarkson randle n Lopez not a bad start
877288307155243008 2017-06-20 22:13:26 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I would guess they are drafting a pg

875963878127140864 2017-06-16 06:30:37 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora After all the Texans signed Brock osweiler for big money lol. Oh and petty hackenberg n Geno smith lolololol hahaha.
875963551453777920 2017-06-16 06:29:19 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora I follow so we surely will.
875963169306554368 2017-06-16 06:27:48 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora Keep up the good work though. You and Dave have more heart and are better than some nfl gm 
875962665453203456 2017-06-16 06:25:48 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora You get on shazier vs the run. He and others weren't good on this play.
875962481046376448 2017-06-16 06:25:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora Agreed. Jarvis is the main problem too.
875961473914351617 2017-06-16 06:21:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora You are right I suppose
875961368301756416 2017-06-16 06:20:39 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora Admit that even though Jarvis was the main culprit there were definitely others.
875960600509259776 2017-06-16 06:17:36 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora You're right. Jarvis sucks. The most. But I played d line n I know that's not a good job by the other two. But you are somewhat right.
875959750793539584 2017-06-16 06:14:13 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora You know more than almost anyone including me about the game but you are flat wrong on this Alex. Steelers depot is still the best around.
875959367849435136 2017-06-16 06:12:42 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora Wrong. Just because they played to the inside doesn't mean they don't have to stay on their feet n play the ball. You know more than me but.
875954110952079360 2017-06-16 05:51:49 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora I respect your football knowledge but both shazier and hargrave are as at fault as anybody Alex

873354393399242753 2017-06-09 01:41:28 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Pirates need to trade Freese, Jaso, Leblanc, Nicasio, Watson, Stewart, and to a contender and get one with Bob nuttings life's work.
873009069388386306 2017-06-08 02:49:16 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Oh look we got outshot again.......

871553225727541249 2017-06-04 02:24:16 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @michaelshure Me too! NBA is a trash pile these days.
871470853598400512 2017-06-04 20:56:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @MeLlamoTrevor Nice game. Troubling video.
870088090928504834 2017-05-31 01:22:20 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 He's unathletic and doesn't have a good glove but he's also very stiff which is an advantage. I'd say he's better than good honestly.
870087581140234240 2017-05-31 01:20:19 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Had seven saves in last 30 seconds of period

869731429093171201 2017-05-30 01:45:06 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @EvilNeal @NothinButN8 That the Pirates even for a poor team suck ass.
869731202974068736 2017-05-30 01:44:12 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @CannonballCrner @rumbunter @coreygarry And you called me a dummy. Priceless.
869731092521254912 2017-05-30 01:43:45 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @CannonballCrner @rumbunter @coreygarry So I do follow the draft you're telling me. You probably have just hit your head too many times and done too many keg stands at the rock
869730770641989632 2017-05-30 01:42:29 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @EvilNeal @NothinButN8 Ironically all are pretty cheap up until this year but I digress.
869730571886485504 2017-05-30 01:41:41 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @NothinButN8 @EvilNeal Or anyone of the top international prospects or anyone. You know kang and marte are suspended. You start Ike Davis n gabby Sanchez for yrs.
869729905105305600 2017-05-30 01:39:02 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @EvilNeal @NothinButN8 Nice. Right back at y'all truth deniers.
869729443513815041 2017-05-30 01:37:12 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @EvilNeal @NothinButN8 Horrible how.
869729227150643201 2017-05-30 01:36:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @CannonballCrner @rumbunter @coreygarry I don't follow the MLB draft that closely but god speed moron tag team
869728137646661633 2017-05-30 01:32:01 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @EvilNeal Those weren't all guys they should of drafted but with a never ending list who could blame you for getting lost. Last place.
869727711312457729 2017-05-30 01:30:19 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JoeStarkey1 Exhilarating. Or is it time for hurdle and NH to shoot themselves in the forehead.
869727322399756289 2017-05-30 01:28:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @CannonballCrner @rumbunter Ok. Jose Abreu Justin Turner John lucroy Zachary cozart scooter gennett Ian Desmond Chris sale Neil Walker Daniel Murphy Donaldson peace
869726901182631937 2017-05-30 01:27:06 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @CannonballCrner @rumbunter Like I said your logic is crystal clear all the time. At least you aren't like local media suggesting trading top prospects for bastardo lol
869726557115486212 2017-05-30 01:25:44 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @CannonballCrner @rumbunter You love a team that misses out on sano bc they don't want to be penalized 6 mill or some shit but also can't sign anyone over 6 mill lol
869726142001016832 2017-05-30 01:24:05 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter @CannonballCrner Last place last place.....facts
869724734728142848 2017-05-30 01:18:30 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter It's okay I'm sure you'd be a better gm than Huntington that involves just doing more than nothing have a nice life 
869724451189002240 2017-05-30 01:17:22 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter Have fun with the last place Pirates do nothing hurdle/NH maybe they will not sign any free agents or international prospects for all time
869723345788579841 2017-05-30 01:12:58 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter You would literally defend NH if he shat on your face I think
869721957838860293 2017-05-30 01:07:28 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter You're literally terrible at this Pirates blogging thing man
869716665919045633 2017-05-30 00:46:26 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Just enough runs to lose 3-2 but hey nova had a low pitch count
869716395138920457 2017-05-30 00:45:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> He doesn't even make changes he just sits there and takes the game in like he's on my couch literally does nothing
869716188242341890 2017-05-30 00:44:32 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Seriously what does hurdle do that my hasn't played baseball since middle school ass couldn't do
869713500347801600 2017-05-30 00:33:51 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Complete game and a loss lol
869713427241021440 2017-05-30 00:33:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Draw me a sketch of how nova gets out of this now
869713156163108864 2017-05-30 00:32:29 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Once again hurdle won't get rivero up here because he's dumb
869712302936907776 2017-05-30 00:29:06 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Hurdle won't get rivero up here cause he's dumb
869327875438252032 2017-05-29 23:01:31 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Tony Watson upping his trade value tbh
869293725729640448 2017-05-29 20:45:49 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Every pitcher the Pirates face feels like randy Johnson this year
868677921447260160 2017-05-27 03:58:50 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot That will probably be her excuse n she will get off.... oooohhh b b b but I didn't knowwww wa waaaaaaaaaaaa..........

866802489022173185 2017-05-22 23:46:32 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Gerrit Cole slander in 3....2.....1......
866543281731239936 2017-05-21 06:36:32 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @WhatTheFFacts This is the most random shit I have heard
866478458859384832 2017-05-21 02:18:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 That happened to me with the Steelers didn't win till I was at Pitt and wasted
866478246111703041 2017-05-21 02:18:06 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 And that goes for the Pirates as well if they had just one or two more guys they could flip others for cheap big upside assets
866477657025900546 2017-05-21 02:15:46 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Ha yea I feel you the Pirates are frustrating man
866476953112637441 2017-05-21 02:12:58 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Oh well maybe now that the pens are top dawg they'll get the next panarin scores 40 in his 1st year jimbo flips him to the habs for 3 picks

866471723687923713 2017-05-21 01:52:11 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Why do the Pirates not have any of the top international prospects do you know? They are cheap too.
866407873550700544 2017-05-21 21:38:28 UTC <matthewabdelhak> What a great day.......blessed
866403833135734784 2017-05-21 21:22:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @penguins Seriously.....stop it

865745986462863360 2017-05-19 01:48:22 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Maybe the celtics need that first overall pick after all cuz dang......
865733928098955264 2017-05-19 01:00:27 UTC <matthewabdelhak> The problem with replacing hurdle is that anyone they brought in would probably do the same old bum shit hurdle does too
865733636183781377 2017-05-19 00:59:18 UTC <matthewabdelhak> If managers had war Clint hurdle would be -13.7 this season
865725627114106880 2017-05-19 00:27:28 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Freddy galvis is super annoying
865705962799329280 2017-05-19 23:09:20 UTC <matthewabdelhak> It seems like every team got better and the Pirates did nothing
865447284716085249 2017-05-18 06:01:26 UTC <matthewabdelhak> You don't let a Gordo Pirates hater decide if jung ho kang can enter the US
865446898257190912 2017-05-18 05:59:54 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Dejuan kovacevic is a donkey

865269123361767425 2017-05-18 18:13:29 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Clint hurdle really is a bad game manager man.
865268551401299969 2017-05-18 18:11:13 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I also don't understand the decisions of the Pirates front office.....
865268208219062272 2017-05-18 18:09:51 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I really don't understand the decisions of Clint hurdle man....
865019993397899264 2017-05-17 01:43:32 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Felipe rivero is un animal
864927261971161090 2017-05-17 19:35:03 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steel_Curtain4 Kordell might throw the ball in the dirt kordell also might sail one to the moon lol
864687061399416833 2017-05-16 03:40:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 They are ridiculous lol I had to tell someone about that stupidity it was glorious
864686508036509697 2017-05-16 03:38:23 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 They were like yea but the narrative lol. then the other replied if they had their finders he would be on the fish instead of the Bucs lol
864686011309322240 2017-05-16 03:36:24 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I know the Bucs could use Turner Desmond clippard neshek cashner gennett cozart weiters or even Gerardo parra right now but no...
864684000811634690 2017-05-16 03:28:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I know it was hilarious wade Leblanc doesn't exactly do it for most people but those two are in another dimension lol
864680041657106432 2017-05-16 03:12:41 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I just saw rum bunter and north shore nine congratulating NH and company for another solid find in wade leblanc lol
864572098202787843 2017-05-16 20:03:45 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @michaelshure @MikeSigner Says the guy who cries about the removal of a Robert e Lee statue n who worships Adolph hitler lol
863916058104795136 2017-05-14 00:36:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Seriously what is a bum like zaza pachulia doing taking out a superstar like kawhi what a shame NBA have fun with zaza n his whitey tighties
863915679967301634 2017-05-14 00:35:23 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Derek Jeter GIDP machine....,
863915589726855168 2017-05-14 00:35:02 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Alex Rodriguez >>>> Derek Jeter or so the sabermatricians tell me
863914938242387968 2017-05-14 00:32:26 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I heard they are starting a new holiday the day Derek jeter rises from the dead too it's gonna be kind of like Christmas/Easter or something
863912550366420993 2017-05-14 00:22:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Zaza pachulia is a dirt scumbag too
863912440324599810 2017-05-14 00:22:31 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Oh and James Neal is a real low class dirt pile and I'm glad he isn't on the pens anymore.
863912050074038272 2017-05-14 00:20:58 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Much maligned tony Watson he of 13 losses in like 5.5 years lol
863910747855826944 2017-05-14 00:15:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Softest dude alive.......yea softest dude living
863910559682617347 2017-05-14 00:15:02 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Good thing polanco plays baseball and not football or hockey cuz damn he is softer than butter
863909989089513472 2017-05-14 00:12:46 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Oh and good thing hurdle got Jaso in this game can't go one without him lol
863909295695515648 2017-05-14 00:10:01 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Daniel descalso is one of those dudes who sucks horribly but always seems to do a bunch of annoying stuff against the Pirates late in games
863908768643461120 2017-05-14 00:07:55 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Hurdle out here trying to pitch watson's arm all the way off
863222074919325696 2017-05-12 02:39:15 UTC <matthewabdelhak> People need to let glasnow be a god damned rookie for a while
863013153344499712 2017-05-12 12:49:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot Although his accuracy can get crazy sometimes he reminds me of kordell lol
863012524819722241 2017-05-12 12:46:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot I saw a lot of the same when I watched tenn vs Florida and Georgia his receivers are not good
862510781883179009 2017-05-10 03:32:49 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Ovechkin is soff
862508538777751553 2017-05-10 03:23:54 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @bryzgoalie30 @malkin71_ Sike
862506637029978113 2017-05-10 03:16:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JakeCamAction @Steve_Dangle Right back at you big dog
862506349934120960 2017-05-10 03:15:13 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steve_Dangle @JakeCamAction Got beat by rust on the first pens goal and lost puck to Schultz on second pens goal lol checkmate
862506058417405952 2017-05-10 03:14:03 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steve_Dangle @JakeCamAction Except he is absolutely right the caps shouldn't trade ovechkin but he is no champion he is a punk
862072268251435009 2017-05-09 22:30:19 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I sometimes wake up and think the political world is one big scripted reality tv show and that politicians/media are just fucking with us.
861273609725255681 2017-05-07 17:36:44 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Buc07 I can't even fathom why somebody would do something like this
860726562328596482 2017-05-05 05:22:58 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Escalating......
860725755873021953 2017-05-05 05:19:46 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Well this ducks vs oilers series sure escalated quickly 
860329362452774912 2017-05-04 03:04:38 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH @TheSanto__ Everyone knows watermelon is flavorless mush
860294883323641856 2017-05-04 00:47:38 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @michaelshure Haha
860294301976276993 2017-05-04 00:45:19 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @michaelshure True an NBC commentator mentioned it the other day as well
860224732716818432 2017-05-04 20:08:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steve_Dangle 
860204796204244993 2017-05-04 18:49:39 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Will John Jaso raise his batting average? Eh, maybe next time.
859872439278465024 2017-05-03 20:48:59 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter Mets account lol
859580660754911239 2017-05-02 01:29:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> The 2017 Pittsburgh Pirates: You can't win a marathon without putting a few band-aids on your nipples.
859575418155880449 2017-05-02 01:08:44 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I probably would've pulled glasnow before he recorded an out tbh
859479708634800129 2017-05-02 18:48:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @937theFan @ROOTSPORTSPIT @Pirates What a lineup my goodness
857707168413437954 2017-04-27 21:24:59 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot Right there with ya on kittle n Robert Davis both look like good potential prospects
857297966960431114 2017-04-26 18:18:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @MarkKaboly What's an ESPN
857296916140478468 2017-04-26 18:14:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> No more ESPN ever
857046913757192192 2017-04-25 01:41:22 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Pirates games never fail to put me to sleep these days
856635944023273473 2017-04-24 22:28:19 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter I know I figured that out
856634944604524548 2017-04-24 22:24:20 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter I guess I see your point on all those a little
856633240429481985 2017-04-24 22:17:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter Like OBP is good but a hit is more valuable than a walk and shows contact skills etc I just believe all stats have some value besides wins
856632696973533188 2017-04-24 22:15:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter I realize that there are analytics butting batting average is a little different than OBP so it still has use
856632356081422341 2017-04-24 22:14:03 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter They are not the only way but should be considered just from a completing plays standpoint
855884011520086017 2017-04-22 20:40:24 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I never imagined in my wildest dreams it could get this bad this quick it's the ACC so my condolences on the horrific losses
855883374807928833 2017-04-22 20:37:52 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Don't tell me you are going to the games next year Gavin do something else enjoy life a little lol the players aren't even going
855878678538006528 2017-04-22 20:19:13 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 And with no marte and no kang we are gonna need him more than ever.
855602364627259392 2017-04-21 02:01:14 UTC <matthewabdelhak> The Pirates refuse to be out-errored lol
855256185087426560 2017-04-20 03:05:39 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot @simmonssteve 
855254406266322946 2017-04-20 02:58:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Yup. And no nick leddy as a number five defenseman. Toews won't win any cups while scoring 3 playoff goals again any time soon I'm guessing
855251393350950913 2017-04-20 02:46:36 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I guess not havin saad frolik stalberg shaw and others in your bottom six is detrimental to the team who could've guessed lol
854783348253880320 2017-04-19 19:46:45 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 This season is gonna be a draaaaaaaaagggg but yea I would've killed for three straight 2 ER games by the SPs last year
854782913954689025 2017-04-19 19:45:02 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Three runs in 27 innings has me at my breaking point
854775110162624513 2017-04-19 19:14:01 UTC <matthewabdelhak> The 2017 Pittsburgh Pirates......number one in snoring
854503075087872001 2017-04-18 01:13:03 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Oh good j hay is up next said by no one ever
854105293587959808 2017-04-17 22:52:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora I like it he looks nice
853475990521221121 2017-04-15 05:11:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter *16th
852633335843213312 2017-04-13 21:23:23 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Just checking all the boxes for losses had to have the bullpen screw one lol
852633055797923840 2017-04-13 21:22:16 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Pirate fanboys blaming gosselin for last inning lol
852632748602863618 2017-04-13 21:21:03 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 What is the score
849094038775115776 2017-04-03 02:59:28 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Unc already 16 missed 3 pointers
848246297173819394 2017-04-01 18:50:51 UTC <matthewabdelhak> If the Pirates can't fill their 4/5 starter spots with like six dudes who are highly touted more capably than Brandon cumpton I'm gonna snap
848033369439043584 2017-03-31 04:44:45 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 
847988764760788994 2017-03-31 01:47:31 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Easily. I think missing Crosby would have close to the same impact after a while but yea I agree.
847988328066678785 2017-03-31 01:45:46 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Every time letang goes out they play horrible hockey. They were like 1-7-1 last year without him. This year they beat a few bad teams but...
847987426542972929 2017-03-31 01:42:11 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Agreed. They haven't been playing well for a while now.
847980549025275904 2017-03-31 01:14:52 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Bryan rust is one of about six penguins who are waaaaay better than I thought they were lol
846852034032799744 2017-03-28 22:30:33 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 just the MLB record every day no biggie while hutch has a housand era in spring training lifetime
843211490979135488 2017-03-18 21:24:20 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 ditto
843151307255037953 2017-03-18 17:25:11 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter nice
843151085334355970 2017-03-18 17:24:18 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter has he been throwing his change this spring do you know
842922753363775488 2017-03-17 02:16:59 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I have thought that with a lot of teams Miami k state vandy there is just no way they should have been so bad this season
842921899382505472 2017-03-17 02:13:36 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I look at teams like that among others and it makes me upset Pitt didn't get in
836964743751561217 2017-03-01 15:41:59 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot haha poor steeler depot

835331129209159681 2017-02-24 03:30:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak only problem with that is no one will ever know who is more desperate damn son I guess we will never know
834226683347660800 2017-02-21 02:21:55 UTC <matthewabdelhak> The Penguins are winning with 3 NHL defensemen right now 
833151004539502592 2017-02-18 03:07:33 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I know and that yinzer point is silly just like the they have no talent one it's the same team
833150318351351808 2017-02-18 03:04:49 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 losing gill tobey brogdon and Anderson also hurt I guess it's funny people point to that win like Jamie couldn't have gotten it
833149649280184321 2017-02-18 03:02:10 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 are you watching uva getting pounded?

825811664087953410 2017-01-29 21:03:38 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Looks like this is what happens when you are the most unpopular president in history and you piss off women, minorities, and the media.

825538646799433728 2017-01-28 02:58:45 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot @dwcoots lots of things mostly that peterman is prob not Marino and definitely not Peterson and it's not 1983 for starters
825458438075510784 2017-01-28 21:40:02 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot @dwcoots for real though if he is there in the fourth or fifth round like people say he might be they could take him I guess

822954017785528320 2017-01-21 23:48:22 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Somebody give Sean Spicer a snickers lol
822953820523294720 2017-01-21 23:47:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Donald Trump should really lay off Twitter as the least liked president in US history it just can't be good for ones mental health

816841221717000192 2017-01-04 02:58:18 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Pitt is being outshot and has more turnovers but is outrebounding them 21-8 so yea almost exclusively the effort dept.
816839160233422848 2017-01-04 02:50:06 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I know having him play point is just kind of silly imo

812732563995394049 2016-12-24 18:51:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> The San Diego Chargers are a testament to the fact that no matter how good your qb is if the rest of your team is retarded you go nowhere

804404465805750272 2016-12-01 19:19:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak we probably lose one of our two established frontline starters in a couple years
804404328530317312 2016-12-01 19:18:31 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak and they have money to pay a pitcher more for a signing bonus than our entire rotation
804404158799417345 2016-12-01 19:17:51 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Nats fans want cutch Bryce Harper rendon trae Murphy difo Ramos and to keep all eight of their starters cool if you are insane
804393722934857728 2016-12-01 18:36:23 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @NorthShoreNine @rumbunter @MarkMaddenX @colin_dunlap he is a Jew

804361701877542912 2016-12-01 16:29:08 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 we lose Cole in a couple years and have to probably start season with freese Jaso platoon kang jhay n Mercer in infield
804356316957409281 2016-12-01 16:07:44 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 NH should have said either give me rivero and Fedde or trade giolito for Andrew Miller or get a worse reliever but NH is a bum
804356016246759424 2016-12-01 16:06:33 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I'm still pissed about Melancon deal
804355771890888704 2016-12-01 16:05:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 exactly having cutch is better for the team than trading him for less
804355295619256320 2016-12-01 16:03:41 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I just hope Neil doesn't get owned again on this trade honestly....
804354458238992384 2016-12-01 16:00:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 ken rosenthal says we are looking at Robles plus more for cutch
804347628205015042 2016-12-01 15:33:13 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @nfldraftscout what do you think about him for the Steelers mostly about him getting to the quarterback
804319083290365952 2016-12-01 13:39:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak so motherfucking stupid
804318885965078528 2016-12-01 13:39:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak like hehe Jeff fisher the most maligned coach in the world didn't know Danny woodhead wasn't still on the pats cmon man smh
804318545102458880 2016-12-01 13:37:39 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak what an epic waste of time
804318443604426752 2016-12-01 13:37:15 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak seriously why would anyone watch a product that is clearly fake as hell

804309553466769408 2016-12-01 13:01:55 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak wanna know what bad things happen to Trump voters they punch innocent people in the face and DONT go to jail that's what 
804308053554266113 2016-12-01 12:55:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak how u like them poison skittles #please #whoreallytriestobeavictim #bitches #hoes #faggots #maggots
804307347749408768 2016-12-01 12:53:09 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak oops 
803371871920156672 2016-11-28 22:55:54 UTC <matthewabdelhak> and no defending oneself from a knife attack is much more realistic than defending from a gun under any circumstance
803371430150885376 2016-11-28 22:54:09 UTC <matthewabdelhak> and still all alive as opposed to gunned down
803370343234670592 2016-11-28 22:49:50 UTC <matthewabdelhak> man wielding knife instead of gun not able to kill even one person shot by cops
803370184920678405 2016-11-28 22:49:12 UTC <matthewabdelhak> it kind of helps it honestly
801903752034844674 2016-11-24 21:42:07 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Realrclark25 5 carries 58 yards bruh lol u a phony
801631080763838464 2016-11-23 03:38:37 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak well friends this is actually the absolute bottom congrats guys
801630870473949187 2016-11-23 03:37:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Just when I thought this country couldn't go any lower the governor of Michigan defends slum like conditions saying literacy is not a right
801282883579183104 2016-11-22 04:35:01 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak asking why he isn't doing better now is like asking why Noll struggled in the eighties with Bubby brister and Merrill hoge
801282496856031232 2016-11-22 04:33:29 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Mike Tomlin has the highest winning percentage of any coach in Steelers history
801239472289484804 2016-11-22 01:42:31 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 no but barely beating Yale they could have conceivably been 1-4 after this game in the first five lol
801239056784818176 2016-11-22 01:40:52 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 this Pitt team is terrifyingly bad man
800549501153005572 2016-11-20 04:00:49 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Everybody look the redskins just won the Super Bowl
800438953102819331 2016-11-20 20:41:32 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak it's like those people who acted like the Steelers should actually pick up mike Vick 
800438720814006273 2016-11-20 20:40:37 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Steve Smith the most glorified receiver on an offense with like 7 passing touchdowns in the history of humanity
800143535328661504 2016-11-19 01:07:39 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @mlombardifoxtv Joel embiid on pace for 112 pts that's all though
799780572054818816 2016-11-18 01:05:22 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I'd much rather have Jamie but when players want to act like a guy will stifle their college career what can you do
799780342727147520 2016-11-18 01:04:27 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I think he was done in by the stupid narrative created by the local media about this team lately and knew it was time
799778125970362369 2016-11-18 00:55:39 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I'll say this sometimes a college program is only as good as the head coach's sullied reputation
799777915844050944 2016-11-18 00:54:48 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 they gave up 80 to Gardner Webb when you think about Rowan Durand newkirk mustapha heron no recruits player attitudes it was time
799775838422138880 2016-11-18 00:46:33 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 that's the real shame of it is they do have talent but are coached terribly
799775572167639040 2016-11-18 00:45:30 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I just watched Dennis smith for bc state he looks like Chris Paul forget Giles n Duke or unc inside game they r gonna get crushed
799774451441213440 2016-11-18 00:41:02 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I feel like they could end up with a losing record bc Duke unc Louisville Syracuse nc state Virginia Miami etc
799774005620310017 2016-11-18 00:39:16 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 what do you think about Pitt so far
799745924100521984 2016-11-18 22:47:41 UTC <matthewabdelhak> 54 pts surrendered 16:09 to go ahh takes me back to my childhood it is actually kind of awesome in a way
799741892346810368 2016-11-18 22:31:40 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 he played with young n Artis plenty at 4/5 this is entirely on stallings
799741676369612800 2016-11-18 22:30:48 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 watch them go 3-20 from three and wonder why their scoring didn't go up lol
799741089905160192 2016-11-18 22:28:28 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I love the excuses being made now like losing Robinson ododa n Maia is a big deal
799740844320456704 2016-11-18 22:27:30 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Jamie would have this team 4-0 with senior young Artis jeter another year older Luther cam n Damon it's almost the exact same
799740040729526273 2016-11-18 22:24:18 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 ha they lose jeter young and Artis next welcome to the gutter
799739462066409472 2016-11-18 22:22:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 lol they suck now
799736208238776320 2016-11-18 22:09:05 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I wonder if all those loud mouthed Pitt fans wonder why the team has 22 puts right now lol
799654814720278529 2016-11-18 16:45:39 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Pitt Basketball: We play horrible defense but make up for it by taking horrible shots cause we don't accept mediocrity
799435674906542081 2016-11-17 02:14:52 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot he was awesome last year
799435137414991872 2016-11-17 02:12:44 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter hasn't even coached 4 games lol but seriously Jamie would take that team to the tourney at least

796711887299813376 2016-11-10 13:51:30 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Furrystoat You said if people keep talking a certain way they will only get 16 yrs of Trump/Pence thus why I called you big guy
796711457794781188 2016-11-10 13:49:48 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Furrystoat If you think in 4 or 8 yrs things are going to be better for conservatives you are a fool a huge one but enjoy Trump while you can
796711149190447104 2016-11-10 13:48:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Furrystoat I called you big guy bc you are talkin tough on Twitter like anyone should care that Trump won one elected
796710310308675584 2016-11-10 13:45:14 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Furrystoat They most certainly did not vote for Trump big guy
796709975347363841 2016-11-10 13:43:54 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Furrystoat Go look how young people voted and realize it's gonna only go more in that direction
796709332331151361 2016-11-10 13:41:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Furrystoat I think that you don't understand that every generation of Americans is getting more and more liberal
796369227934560257 2016-11-09 15:09:54 UTC <matthewabdelhak> When you call people names you shouldn't have a profile pick of yourself looking like u like dick in the ass
796367791666307073 2016-11-09 15:04:11 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @realDonaldTrump @kurt13warner Let me ask you a question what if he were to prohibit white people from doing something would that be 
796367223921213441 2016-11-09 15:01:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @realDonaldTrump @kurt13warner You hope he bans all Muslims
796367096221470720 2016-11-09 15:01:26 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I love people who elected a person who plans on banning BILLIONS of people from living in America bc they are Muslim calling others racist
796358736415690752 2016-11-09 14:28:13 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @SwizzleMania Not really but that's a cute little thing you got going though
796357404942368768 2016-11-09 14:22:55 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @SwizzleMania Like I haven't seen pages of idiot Trump supporters talking about hanging obama for treason n all kinds of goofy shit before gtfoh
796354937420713984 2016-11-09 14:13:07 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @SwizzleMania Like it matters
796339811346948096 2016-11-09 13:13:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Seriously how the hell daniel McCullers been in the league for two years and he can't even get in a proper stance #howthefuckdodathappendo
796338607166521344 2016-11-09 13:08:13 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @VinnyVidiVici98 When James Harrison leads the team in sacks and will gay is your best corner everybody gots to go #byetomlin #itswascoolwhileitlasted
796170143780978688 2016-11-08 01:58:49 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @timwilliamsP2 Nice
796169656969076739 2016-11-08 01:56:52 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @timwilliamsP2 Good thing Florida doesn't stand to be affected by this one 
794348705709178880 2016-11-03 01:21:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot They can't it's the Bucs it's who they are
794032988526964736 2016-11-02 04:26:31 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora @RaysFanGio This is actually a bit frightening
793989870054088704 2016-11-02 01:35:11 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Ha no chance
793973727830515712 2016-11-02 00:31:02 UTC <matthewabdelhak> This umpire really does look at more strikes than anyone on the planet
793960289351909376 2016-11-02 23:37:38 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @MarkKaboly Have you been to FLA or NY/NJ
793607470522458113 2016-11-01 00:15:40 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Yea I hope they could get a few more guys
793606592662953984 2016-11-01 00:12:10 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I am a little optimistic about Pitt football right now but who is our likely qb next year do you know
793605635233329152 2016-11-01 00:08:22 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Not to mention about 6 of the ten teams behind them....at least....could spank PSU
793604991919337473 2016-11-01 00:05:49 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @timwilliamsP2 Are you in San Diego
793589549804888064 2016-11-01 23:04:27 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot Didn't someone pick spiller up last year and he couldn't get on the field
793264085169115140 2016-10-31 01:31:10 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I thought you were serious and got excited
793263611330179073 2016-10-31 01:29:17 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Are you joking cause I really don't know
792958409528086528 2016-10-30 05:16:31 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I cast my Heisman ballot for Lamar Jackson! Click the player you think deserves the @NissanUSA #HeismanHouse vote! https://cards.twitter.com/cards/xzv67/2h72q
792908472715059201 2016-10-30 01:58:06 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @PaulZeise @mgoblog It's Sunday
792801820590563328 2016-10-30 18:54:18 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @getnickwright Like dude was just supposed to win 9 straight Super Bowls with a shit team I guess he isn't a top 5 qb I guess Brock osweiler is better
792801510102925312 2016-10-30 18:53:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @getnickwright I  people who trash luck/Lebron hoping they never produce/suck then they switch the argument to he is no Jesus on a football field tho
792797823171375104 2016-10-30 18:38:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @getnickwright Because he threw one pick against a good chiefs defense for his fifth pick of the season against fifteen touchdowns in week 8 nice 
792782808636755968 2016-10-30 17:38:45 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I see the NFL is in let's make this season as annoying as possible for the Steelers again
792586806776725504 2016-10-29 04:39:54 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Yea that's what I always say but I bet they don't do anything significant I just don't see it
792581682226311168 2016-10-29 04:19:33 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Probably wouldn't even pay for 1 of those guys our only hope is to add a rich hill or two around our core get to the playoffs n go on a run
792565689160564736 2016-10-29 03:16:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Just think where the Pirates would be without Rene gayo and ray searage and you really se how ridiculous the FO is
792565241456373760 2016-10-29 03:14:13 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Nope just acquired better young talent which is frustrating
792564865722298369 2016-10-29 03:12:43 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Also I wish they would have drafted a bit better recently or acquired more young talent whether it be pitching Abreu keep Neil or whatever
792564558539862016 2016-10-29 03:11:30 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I've talked with you about this before I do wish the Pirates signed/traded for another top starter preferably a dominant ace but $ helps
792563641493049344 2016-10-29 03:07:51 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Here is hoping that they drop off a cliff though
792563107017072640 2016-10-29 03:05:44 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 They can just acquire more though they are the Cubs
792560645644259329 2016-10-29 02:55:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I know but I doubt GMs are like don't sign the next kris Bryant Rizzo schwarber Russel Baez have only one good pitcher n catcher at .089 avg
792560136808075264 2016-10-29 02:53:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 People are acting like the Cubs did it wrong n the Indians did it correctly lol some people man
792559907069308928 2016-10-29 02:53:01 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 If I was the Cubs I might send an outfielder a top pitching prospect a reliever n like hammel for Sale they just have so much
792558019330514944 2016-10-29 02:45:31 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 Yea I know the Cubs are just gonna be more pissed next year now lol
792538878145986560 2016-10-29 01:29:27 UTC <matthewabdelhak> All those bats and the Cubs can't hit a thing what a shame
792426655021084672 2016-10-29 18:03:31 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @PFF @_Carlos_Danger Mo has a slightly better grade at like 82.3 does he not
791849459445436416 2016-10-27 03:49:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> 214 yds rushing 18/22 almost perfect ineptitude.......almost
791848706353958912 2016-10-27 03:46:58 UTC <matthewabdelhak> 7 penalties for 75 yds at least three of which were holding I'm sure
791848332511412225 2016-10-27 03:45:28 UTC <matthewabdelhak> They should just go with the lets throw three times and complete one for the first down Arians offense
791848118815903744 2016-10-27 03:44:38 UTC <matthewabdelhak> You let up 214 yds rushing and a qb to go 18/22 on you drop passes fumble punts allow continuous pressure but blame the quarterback nice
791490164254060544 2016-10-26 04:02:14 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @PaulZeise Pirates
791114060628496385 2016-10-25 03:07:44 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 agreed on that but what do I know I don't follow the team everyday like TW so I can't fathom jacoby jones
791113778532274176 2016-10-25 03:06:37 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 he was pumping up Connor joe the other day I do hope Newman is good though Tim Williams is ridiculous sometimes
791113112757743616 2016-10-25 03:03:58 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 it's like is Cole tucker really a good 1st round pick among others n why not sign Justin Turner for one mil when you have Barmes
791112510069809153 2016-10-25 03:01:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 why they don't have more quality prospects is annoying same with their failure to acquire more infielders or keep Neil
791112121434066944 2016-10-25 03:00:02 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 people who say the Pirates mgmt and ownership are always awesome are like the people who bash Jamie for me it makes no sense
791111785667371008 2016-10-25 02:58:42 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 also the Indians have 4 good starters and a pretty legit team so letting guys go is easier
791111348524490752 2016-10-25 02:56:58 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 hell the Pirates one legitimate infielder who can hit might get deported
791111196149555202 2016-10-25 02:56:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I also think it's easier to trade Glyber Torres when you already have Russell Baez zobrist happ Bryant n Rizzo
791110516085133313 2016-10-25 02:53:39 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 the royals got Volquez cueto zobrist and rios I could never see the Pirates doing that
790715252140748801 2016-10-24 00:43:01 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH let me guess no championship am I getting this down
790715150453977088 2016-10-24 00:42:37 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH and.....
790713565233590272 2016-10-24 00:36:19 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH you are a clown obviously reaching a top 10 ranking for 9 straight yrs is obviously below your standards lol
790712780542226432 2016-10-24 00:33:12 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH @dafst4545 wow AP high says they reached top 10 in nine straight seasons how below western pa bball standards
790712209437364224 2016-10-24 00:30:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH @dafst4545 those are all after tournament losses dropped them and no not plenty of programs
790711496875479041 2016-10-24 00:28:06 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH how is stallings recruiting going
790711427350659072 2016-10-24 00:27:49 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH what the last time Pitt football has been in the top 5
790711266192990208 2016-10-24 00:27:11 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH how many banners does stallings have
790709575456436224 2016-10-24 00:20:28 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH Pitt bball started going down when people started listening to who don't know their ass from a hole in the wall
790708738223067137 2016-10-24 00:17:08 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH @dafst4545 it's cute kind of like in a childish way
790708661207183360 2016-10-24 00:16:50 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH @dafst4545 but by almost means keep playing like you have high standards and are just a cut above
790708542286155777 2016-10-24 00:16:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH @dafst4545 yea because Pitt football has lots of banners and Pitt basketball has lots of banners b4 Jamie
790708374950117376 2016-10-24 00:15:41 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH @dafst4545 ergo they were a top 15 team at year end for 8/10 years and top 10 half the the time unacceptable
790708015846400000 2016-10-24 00:14:16 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH @dafst4545 they got two 1 seeds two 2 seeds two 3 seeds and a 4 seed in the tournament in ten years
790707537364385792 2016-10-24 00:12:22 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH @dafst4545 in what world does a team play only 5-6 home games a year
790704901336608768 2016-10-24 00:01:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH gladly
790704810165084160 2016-10-24 00:01:31 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH @dafst4545 losing 1.3 games a yr at the Pete for 9 yrs and having 2 national champ contenders is below Pitt
790703849359093760 2016-10-24 23:57:42 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH my point is you are wrong about everything and you are mostly a clown
790703688041967616 2016-10-24 23:57:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH not really should be pretty good this year but I bet they aren't in the top 15 or better for like 80% of a decade again
790703215998144512 2016-10-24 23:55:11 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH yea like you said Wichita st was a so called inferior opponent that almost beat Louisville 2 go 2 the national championship
790702840473804800 2016-10-24 23:53:42 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH hopefully he doesn't do a 1080 and throw the ball directly into the rim like he did at Pitt
790702587318194176 2016-10-24 23:52:42 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH you are hoping that after a year in the NCAA and like three in the NBA he will make you look like you are right
790701712176586753 2016-10-24 23:49:13 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH seriously go figure out how many more goals bobby Farnham has than Crosby or something fit for the loons on the fan
790701395095670784 2016-10-24 23:47:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH Jaime Dixon and Ben howland are the best thing to ever happen to Pitt basketball
790701186236022784 2016-10-24 23:47:07 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH Steven Adams still isn't a great offensive player
790299975984881664 2016-10-23 21:12:51 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Realrclark25 it doesn't hurt they have been on the field for all but like 6 plays
790255976104366080 2016-10-23 18:18:01 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @WhatTheFFacts well they are

790253599280332800 2016-10-23 18:08:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> The jaguars defense has no strength in it
790249131700736000 2016-10-23 17:50:49 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @espn @Steel_Curtain4 ha he's trying to be cute I think
790245922353455104 2016-10-23 17:38:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Cody Kessler part superman part Batman part Spider-Man
790241168852254721 2016-10-23 17:19:11 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Carson Wentz Peyton manning before the snap Aaron Rodgers after the snap Michael Vick when he runs
790207290150313985 2016-10-23 15:04:33 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @SportsTalkJoe this is the most insane thing I have ever read congrats #youwin
789983263263629313 2016-10-22 00:14:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 ha buccos gunna bucc lol
789976024628862976 2016-10-22 23:45:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 @Pirates I agree the CS and pick off numbers though bad might not be coaching but I don't mind the move honestly
789975098727931904 2016-10-22 23:41:55 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 @Pirates throw out at home 3rd most almost all base running stats were poor
789974576683900928 2016-10-22 23:39:50 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 @Pirates the base running was some of the worst in the league though
789220498575986688 2016-10-20 21:43:24 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Like please tell me what Liriano's xflip and CCC7260xxx was before he came to the Pirates
789220003002273792 2016-10-20 21:41:26 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I love baseball stat nerds no one more condescending than them trying to convince you that John Jaso isn't a big downgrade from mike Napoli
789216282516213760 2016-10-20 21:26:39 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ThePoniExpress Napoli is not a bad defender either and all those guys I mentioned are as affordable as Napoli
789215949085741056 2016-10-20 21:25:19 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ThePoniExpress taillon Cole glasnow kingham Kuhl brault Williams n Hutchison is what it will be
789215499607429121 2016-10-20 21:23:32 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ThePoniExpress wanna know a secret the Pirates won't sign anyone this offseason wait and see
789215302860967936 2016-10-20 21:22:45 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ThePoniExpress or Jose Abreu or every Cuban player imaginable or Justin turner or keep Neil Walker or trade for a 1b/c like Jon lucroy

787517658501492736 2016-10-15 04:56:55 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak the NBA should've blocked that trade
787517561369825280 2016-10-15 04:56:32 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak that way the Clips are good as hell but got something to try 4 and the Warriors are good as hell but got something to try 4
787517228014940160 2016-10-15 04:55:13 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak if there is no challenge why bother seriously like go to the Clippers or something damn
787517049601798144 2016-10-15 04:54:30 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I don't care what anyone says KD on the Warriors just looks so stupid to me
787495682013749248 2016-10-15 03:29:36 UTC <matthewabdelhak> GTFOH
786024380295811072 2016-10-11 02:03:10 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Anthony Rizzo wishes he was Conor Gillaspie
786002913931894784 2016-10-11 00:37:52 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak #aceofthestaff
786002804489854976 2016-10-11 00:37:26 UTC <matthewabdelhak> It's amazing Jeff Locke hasn't led the Pirates to the promised land by now
785999951868272641 2016-10-11 00:26:06 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steel_Curtain4 who knows man one of the more ridiculous ones too
785678898637910016 2016-10-10 03:10:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot man expending a 2nd round pick on a kicker instead of I don't know Myles jack now that is forward thinking #weneedmoreofdat
785677810186584065 2016-10-10 03:06:01 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot somehow after all anything is possible when you are dumb enough
785675620109815808 2016-10-10 02:57:19 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 no kidding
785285045623808000 2016-10-09 01:05:19 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 lol me too man they are both gonna sling mud for the next couple hours ridiculous
785280450595958786 2016-10-09 00:47:03 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I just block mofos who tweet nonsense repeatedly it works great
785279705016524805 2016-10-09 00:44:06 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 like what? election stuff?
785252374130548736 2016-10-09 22:55:29 UTC <matthewabdelhak> This man punted the ball 16 yards with a straight face smdh
785227727951400960 2016-10-09 21:17:33 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot Chris Hubbard highest graded steeler on pff 
785225296517566464 2016-10-09 21:07:54 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @AKinkhabwala @Steelersdepot thanks
785187426310299648 2016-10-09 18:37:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @BuccoSharkTank if they got like 2 of those guys that would be tremendous but I doubt it
784532392082075648 2016-10-07 23:14:32 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter price less so kershaw is absolutely baffling for him to be the best pitcher I've ever seen in regular season and then normal.....
784489580292665344 2016-10-07 20:24:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 they could probably trade some of their remaining prospects for like Chris sale at this point no problem
784488723341795328 2016-10-07 20:21:01 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DaquidoBazzini @rumbunter hired Huntington and should be competitive for at least 4 more years
784488576419528704 2016-10-07 20:20:26 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DaquidoBazzini @rumbunter I know I remember mcclatchy n others
784488434702381056 2016-10-07 20:19:52 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 nope have 4 late inning relievers will probably upgrade rotation in offseason too it's ridiculous
784487999933390849 2016-10-07 20:18:08 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter @DaquidoBazzini @YouTube ha no kidding
784487741908217857 2016-10-07 20:17:07 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 they can just bring in Chapman and still have strop Rondon and Edwards.... they will prob add Jansen next year too lol
784487317394321408 2016-10-07 20:15:26 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 the Cubs are just winning it all probably I hope they don't but
784196912979152896 2016-10-06 01:01:28 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot how you are watching that game let alone bet on it I have no idea
784155425235083266 2016-10-06 22:16:36 UTC <matthewabdelhak> You can't win everything all the time all in all we had a good run
784103652998852608 2016-10-06 18:50:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @POTUS @penguins put some speck on his name
783868433976786946 2016-10-05 03:16:12 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Because no one wants to watch fat Bartolo and a bunch of relievers pitch against the Cubs that's why
783838267795906562 2016-10-05 01:16:20 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter @jfn514 @NorthShoreNine Chris mueller and Colin Dunlap got mad about it on the final word and he acted like they were weird
783837993006043136 2016-10-05 01:15:15 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter @jfn514 @NorthShoreNine he was defending the Pirates spending habits religiously before the season
783683263902552065 2016-10-05 15:00:24 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @NotSoMcCool did it feel like your foot was going to explode
783573238785843200 2016-10-05 07:43:12 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @TheBaxterBean this is the greatest single thing I've seen in my life....period
783528365596766210 2016-10-04 04:44:54 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @PaulZeise I hate preseason sports so much
783483502570315776 2016-10-04 01:46:38 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter I think I'm going anybody but the Cubs lol
783483021382955008 2016-10-04 01:44:43 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter who do you want to win it all
783470090867974145 2016-10-04 00:53:20 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Josh4Miller ha......hahahahahahahahahahaha.....................ha...........hahahahahahahahahahaha..................................lol ha
783106353279619072 2016-10-03 00:47:58 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap that's laying it on way too thick man
782837621038784512 2016-10-03 07:00:07 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @PaulZeise nj philly Florida central pa Ohio San Antonio
782837491065769984 2016-10-02 06:59:36 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @PaulZeise school will wish they were never born .... reportedly
782835414499373056 2016-10-02 06:51:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @PaulZeise real and trying to lure children into the woods threatening schools and things like that
782753721146937344 2016-10-02 01:26:44 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @TGlasnow throw the damn change up
782707646335815680 2016-10-02 22:23:39 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I also think they are still enjoying winning and in a better place than the buccos and got a bit lucky
782707494502051840 2016-10-02 22:23:03 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 team era went from second in the league to 15th which is really the story of the season used to win every time they scored 4
782707247113568256 2016-10-02 22:22:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 the Pirates have more runs and home runs than they did last year even though they limped their way to the end of the season
782706832967991296 2016-10-02 22:20:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 and the Mets jeanmar gomezed their way into the playoffs incredible
782672104579698689 2016-10-02 20:02:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Maybe now people will quit acting like Richard Sherman and Josh Norman are over rated probably not though........
782618645272797185 2016-10-02 16:30:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot @nmmansell @DavidMTodd Jesus Christ mane
782405341447282688 2016-10-01 02:22:24 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 holy shite mane
782376804501757953 2016-10-01 00:29:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 getting a little excited for the future though hopefully Hamlin ford and some other additions help
782376672079204352 2016-10-01 00:28:29 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I was hoping it was for both I guess that's three backs and someone I else I really haven't watched much
782376162718736385 2016-10-01 00:26:27 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 are you talking about offense or defense I'm not watching
782057731171549184 2016-09-30 03:21:07 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @BucsDugout nope
781675331795247104 2016-09-29 02:01:36 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rtjr nevermind they count
781675162932482048 2016-09-29 02:00:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rtjr stats don't count someone said
781632371132997632 2016-09-29 23:10:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @IvanNova47 @Pirates bye bye Ivan
781539666797465600 2016-09-29 17:02:31 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak a couple wins away from the division.....a couple wins away from the wild card vs reeling mets cards or Giants.....ALMOST
781539318456209408 2016-09-29 17:01:08 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Seriously, if there was ever a team that is habitually like a couple wins away from where they need to be more than the Pirates let me know
781537102852857856 2016-09-29 16:52:20 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap seriously Rutherford telling your boy Rossi to go sell ice cream was one of the top moments in Pitt sports #legend
781536550211334144 2016-09-29 16:50:08 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap oh god look at you're loyal clown following its actually so fucked up
781298111629041664 2016-09-28 01:02:40 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I've now accepted that they will simply never do enough to win a championship
781296833091866624 2016-09-28 00:57:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 ha I know it's less than what they will have to pay for nova lol not signing cueto Zimmerman or trading for hamels hurts now
781294818051788800 2016-09-28 00:49:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I know people acted like his contract was the end of the world I probably would have DLed him though
781294228244533248 2016-09-28 00:47:14 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 especially when you consider what's available to them now I'm a huge Liriano fan
779825402684534784 2016-09-24 23:30:39 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 lol we can only hope it doesn't go that far back this year should be ok but after that who knows
779825193581707264 2016-09-24 23:29:49 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 bunch of people who probably didn't even watch Pitt talking crap
779825038107303936 2016-09-24 23:29:12 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I watched Pitt under Ralph Willard which made me angrier about it
779824877691863040 2016-09-24 23:28:33 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 the lack of respect he was shown was DISGUSTING
779814803225411584 2016-09-24 22:48:32 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I'm amazed and not surprised at the same time
779814438207688704 2016-09-24 22:47:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 lol powerful Pitting going on
779441136188272642 2016-09-23 22:03:42 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter it would be so risky almost a guaranteed bad contract. Let's hope you're right. Especially for the Pirates.
779439800705126400 2016-09-23 21:58:24 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter expecting the Pirates to make him 1 of their highest paid players for 5 year when virtually all their young talent is due a raise
779439298147790848 2016-09-23 21:56:24 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter I get the idea but think it's worth a try
779438842952626176 2016-09-23 21:54:36 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter maybe at a higher salary he could pitch well for a year or two pocket like half of the 70 and move on doesn't seem too bad
779433153433710592 2016-09-23 21:31:59 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter maybe see if he'll take 2 yrs 32 mill
779432560875016194 2016-09-23 21:29:38 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter 1 yr 16 mill 2 yr 30 mill 3 yr 42 mill 4 yr 52 mill
779394064567242752 2016-09-23 18:56:40 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot @Breezey585 @steelers I lol at this
779367625575043073 2016-09-23 17:11:36 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @InClementeWthr @NotSoMcCool Orioles far and away most power might not even make playoffs but I agree power and OBP is good conbo
779367443290525696 2016-09-23 17:10:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @InClementeWthr @NotSoMcCool I just think power is way down the list royals giants etc consistent hitting n pitching will do
779353786041020416 2016-09-23 16:16:36 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @NotSoMcCool @InClementeWthr seriously how many 2-1, 3-2 games did they win in recent years this year 6 runs often isn't enough
779353539487203329 2016-09-23 16:15:38 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @NotSoMcCool @InClementeWthr will score more runs this year and hit more home runs this year than last maybe drop two spots in runs
779352937965289472 2016-09-23 16:13:14 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @NotSoMcCool @InClementeWthr the Pirates team ERA was 2nd in majors last year and is 15th this year........
778628186699509760 2016-09-21 16:13:20 UTC <matthewabdelhak> If you don't like the Pittsburgh Steelers................fuck you.
778470074579505157 2016-09-20 05:45:03 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter @KDPomp yea happ goes like 5 today gives up two he probably has 12 or more wins like that lol
778469361128382464 2016-09-20 05:42:13 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter @KDPomp cueto has an era 50 points lower and has pitched like 30 more innings
778469140893798400 2016-09-20 05:41:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter @KDPomp his era is 3.28......
778211754132332544 2016-09-20 12:38:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @PerrellL not defending what happened to that big bad dude but terrorists usually get BLASTED
778201599286059008 2016-09-20 11:58:14 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @SLAYERREIGN @Realrclark25 like no one has the sense to grasp what Dylan roof meant when he held that flag in one hand gun in the other
778201411439984640 2016-09-20 11:57:29 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @SLAYERREIGN @Realrclark25 says the guy with a racist flag for his avatar
778200379716694016 2016-09-20 11:53:23 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak that deplorable Bob shit is a fucking joke seriously my gawd how delusional you have to be to act like these motherfuckers
778200122375168000 2016-09-20 11:52:22 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak the truth is this country is an absurdly racist country still
778200004469063680 2016-09-20 11:51:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak no wonder athletes sit at games I'm not even black and I would in a second
778199842078265346 2016-09-20 11:51:15 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak seriously what one thing have they done to make things better besides acting like the fuckin victim the god damn nerve
778199634170839040 2016-09-20 11:50:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak 13 yr old black boy with BB gun prob scared shitless after recent events probably tries to get rid of it shot by cops
778199321737064448 2016-09-20 11:49:11 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak this country is a joke how bout arresting people at Trump rallies for assault that's a start
778199072792539136 2016-09-20 11:48:11 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak over 15 years the only one to kill more than 15 people was a 29 yr old afghan born here lived here for nearly 30 yrs
778198816759701504 2016-09-20 11:47:10 UTC <matthewabdelhak> It's a bit ridiculous people are so eager to ban Muslims when the only significant terror attack since 9/11 was carried out by an American
778195172903493632 2016-09-20 11:32:42 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @PaulZeise @nypost what he blew up a dumpster for the only attack in like six months
777452826100375552 2016-09-18 10:22:52 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Vontaze Burfict is one of the biggest pussies I've seen
777314931595153408 2016-09-17 01:14:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 bad qb play bad defense

776575870047662080 2016-09-15 00:18:10 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot bold move

776173598348161024 2016-09-14 21:39:41 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ThaBestUNO congrats man
776166307326676992 2016-09-14 21:10:42 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap it seems like Huntington all but said he's probably not gonna be back
775907398066339840 2016-09-13 04:01:54 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @MarkKaboly_Trib and they love that fullback who had the one touchdown run for Denver lol
775907065768402945 2016-09-13 04:00:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @MarkKaboly_Trib and has a few big gains even if they only have like a few catches a year had Jamison crowder rated really high
775906798633119745 2016-09-13 03:59:31 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @MarkKaboly_Trib I think they prioritize quality over quantity to much for instance a receiver who catches all of his targets.....
775566561805557760 2016-09-12 05:27:32 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak seriously nothing but a damn Dixie cup of what tastes like kool aid made with the other inmates shower water all day
775566269412147200 2016-09-12 05:26:22 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I'd rather go back to jail than go back to watching guys like case keenum quarterbacking the steelers
775170648444432384 2016-09-11 03:14:19 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I hate the Patriots.....damn.....it's BAD!!!!!!

775124614854868992 2016-09-11 00:11:23 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JMackeyPG I thought y'all wanted to trade Crosby n not Malkin tho
775109700895604736 2016-09-11 23:12:08 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @timwilliamsP2 people don't seem to understand that you can add to the major league club without trading prospects smh

774425045301014528 2016-09-09 01:51:33 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Just enough time for Hurdle to fuck this up again
774415986371862528 2016-09-09 01:15:33 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I have never seen an organization and manager piss away an entire season like the 2016 Pittsburgh Pirates.....Never
774413919498534912 2016-09-09 01:07:20 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Hurdle had to use Hughes man damn......RIP
774013635211300864 2016-09-08 22:36:45 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @VinnyVidiVici98 basically the lakers killed everyone all the time when he played if ai didn't get them once they go 16-0 in playoffs
774012986272821252 2016-09-08 22:34:11 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @VinnyVidiVici98 nobody did that to shaq nobody
774012878089170944 2016-09-08 22:33:45 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @VinnyVidiVici98 I saw him stuff shaq and shaq got the ball back n he swatted him again
774008462099480576 2016-09-08 22:16:12 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora round one/two lol sorry
773999203848753152 2016-09-08 21:39:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH @OnwardState and people wonder why all those little boys got boffed
773999037150298112 2016-09-08 21:38:45 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisMuellerPGH @OnwardState oh how will we ever defend Christian sackenberg

773697082003599361 2016-09-07 01:38:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rtjr @MLBHR ^^^^what he said
773587258410688512 2016-09-07 18:22:29 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @timwilliamsP2 oh and every position player on the team has regressed offensively except for polanco and the bench
773587059139313664 2016-09-07 18:21:42 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @timwilliamsP2 era 4.1 or so up about .9 from last year bad for a team that used to always win when they score 4+
773586776296398848 2016-09-07 18:20:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @timwilliamsP2 runs per game up .2 this year despite recent slide
773586494946697220 2016-09-07 18:19:27 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 for a team that used to win games 2-1 and 3-2 having a team era in the 4.1 range is no Bueno
773586039189413888 2016-09-07 18:17:38 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 pirates score .2 more runs per game this year even though they have been sliding, era .9 higher
773392193746792448 2016-09-06 05:27:22 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @KDPomp even hurdle has sucked
773392097894363136 2016-09-06 05:26:59 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @KDPomp marte worse Walker better than freese polanco only one who improved on entire team
773391542929293312 2016-09-06 05:24:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @KDPomp pitching worse cutch worse kang worse jhay worse cervelli worse Stewart worse......
773391109120724994 2016-09-06 05:23:03 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @KDPomp if the Pirates hit 13 more home runs this year they will equal their total from last year
773390708002656256 2016-09-06 05:21:28 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @KDPomp kc hit less HR than the Pirates last year one of lowest totals in league San Fran 17th in league the year they won it
773363167141376000 2016-09-06 03:32:02 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Paulpitwv @bricklaying69 @timwilliamsP2 sorry switch dads to dfa
773363060710842368 2016-09-06 03:31:36 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @timwilliamsP2 @bricklaying69 @Paulpitwv coming from a bunch of people who wanted to replace Melancon with Watson last yr or dads him
773352771907039232 2016-09-06 02:50:43 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I'm just glad polanco is only 24
773351895347830785 2016-09-06 02:47:14 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I swear if I see drew Hutchison n Locke in the rotation next year my god
773351700094525440 2016-09-06 02:46:28 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 going forward they have bell so they should maybe get 3b and move kang to 2b or just get a second but they will do neither
773351332879044608 2016-09-06 02:45:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 30 HR 90 RBI this year n better defense than Pedro the man could always hit I meant for this year obviously
773350717054603264 2016-09-06 02:42:33 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 even Mike Napoli would've helped
773350448501710848 2016-09-06 02:41:29 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 John Jaso at 4 mil was their infield solution so....
773350086923341824 2016-09-06 02:40:03 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 or go get another reliever but still....
773349921852301312 2016-09-06 02:39:24 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I'm glad it's over shut Cole glasnow n taillon down also hopefully now they realize they need to sign Feliz a sp and infielder
773347753707450368 2016-09-06 02:30:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I'm glad it's over.
773307489819516928 2016-09-06 23:50:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rtjr power move
773306226650198017 2016-09-06 23:45:46 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @BuccoSharkTank nope
773302196502867968 2016-09-06 23:29:45 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @timwilliamsP2 depend on Liriano one of highest beta players and Cole to be good 4 years in a row is suicidal imo
773301905082556416 2016-09-06 23:28:36 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @timwilliamsP2 came into season with 3 neise 4 Locke 5 nicasio vogelsong luebke Lobstein scahill no infielders that can hit ( kang- dk)
773300487806300160 2016-09-06 23:22:58 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @timwilliamsP2 yeah....
772925483226849282 2016-09-05 22:32:50 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Andrew McCutchen .330 OBP 20 HR 60 RBI thus far in a bad year.....the horror
772907770035130368 2016-09-05 21:22:26 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 the ace of our staff obviously, opening day 4 starter
772897070168567809 2016-09-05 20:39:55 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I really hope so

772090077413449730 2016-09-03 15:13:13 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot think about who you are talking about man......
771542055466045440 2016-09-01 02:55:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JohnDreker nice
771540980159815680 2016-09-01 02:51:18 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JohnDreker how hard does he throw
771158773763305472 2016-08-31 01:32:33 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JoeStarkey1 aha
771090124352487424 2016-08-31 20:59:46 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora eh not a horrible 3rd qb
771023147726495745 2016-08-31 16:33:37 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @justinwilson71 @Steelersdepot @JustinWilson71 the point of giving extra money to a player they intend to trade or lose would be what
770757956979810304 2016-08-30 22:59:51 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @espn @Steelersdepot it was used a lot in the 16th and 17th century lol
770757702070968321 2016-08-30 22:58:50 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @espn @Steelersdepot worser is actually a word someone used it on Twitter and I made fun of him and he googled it I think n said its a word
770750412337053696 2016-08-30 22:29:52 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @sawchik_trib @GavWill13 people who follow the Pirates minor leagues talk about how they need to be consoled about giving up Polo
770750181855883265 2016-08-30 22:28:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @sawchik_trib @GavWill13 seriously we may have given up more for nova than we got for Melancon
770749575896391681 2016-08-30 22:26:33 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @sawchik_trib @GavWill13 @Sawchik_Trib I think organizations have know that the Pirates are total punks and they have all the leverage
770749365136875520 2016-08-30 22:25:43 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @sawchik_trib @GavWill13 @Sawchik_Trib if Tito polo breaks out.... And people act like wanting more for Melancon is wrong
770749177311662080 2016-08-30 22:24:58 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @sawchik_trib @GavWill13 @Sawchik_Trib seriously our top left handed pitching prospect and Tito polo
770727797216149504 2016-08-30 21:00:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @timwilliamsP2 the trib is a collection of sleaze balls lol it sucks
770723105463476224 2016-08-30 20:41:22 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Jonsabec @colin_dunlap @PaulZeise Neil might not even get resigned by the mets his back has been shot all August
770722873682124800 2016-08-30 20:40:27 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Jonsabec @colin_dunlap @PaulZeise I would've liked to keep one of the two and signed better starters but both are very flawed
770721757330309121 2016-08-30 20:36:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Jonsabec @colin_dunlap @PaulZeise no they won 98 games because they were like 2nd in era I'd rather have bell personally
770721497010868228 2016-08-30 20:34:58 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Jonsabec @colin_dunlap @PaulZeise Neil walker and Pedro aren't the answer to anything
770720847053152256 2016-08-30 20:32:23 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Jonsabec @colin_dunlap @PaulZeise mets say he won't be everyday player for them again
770720693843525633 2016-08-30 20:31:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Jonsabec @colin_dunlap @PaulZeise Pedro's errors would have compounded bad pitching early in year and your boy Neil's back is hurt again
770706851289788416 2016-08-30 19:36:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot but what about Bart Starr
770465850889568258 2016-08-29 03:39:08 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JoeStarkey1 the only reliever that didn't poop on himself today was rivero though ironically
769963193896689664 2016-08-28 18:21:45 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter hitting like .400 against us lol
769650303708823552 2016-08-27 21:38:26 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @BiertempfelTrib @TribSports seriously makes what interesting
769649940704419840 2016-08-27 21:36:59 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @BiertempfelTrib @TribSports no it means the Pirates will never win shit the end good bye
769560292590223360 2016-08-27 15:40:46 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @joe_block @TheBigO1952 one more year after this one
769503389088612352 2016-08-27 11:54:39 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot they. Will. Be. BACK.
768652922850725888 2016-08-24 03:35:12 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @The_eichenBOMB @_mistermet @jtarg23 all the Mets needed was hitting not only did they not keep Murphy and Turner but almost Cespedes lol
768626652574126081 2016-08-24 01:50:49 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter Greg Maddux and Roger Clemens both had career ERAs over 3.10 ooooohhhhh my not an ace
768626419609972741 2016-08-24 01:49:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter not to mention David Price Cueto last year Shelby Miller Harvey among literally thousands of others
768625926703689728 2016-08-24 01:47:55 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter degrom has allowed 13 ER in last two starts gasp
768511040912883712 2016-08-24 18:11:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter it's almost like after watching countless years of baseball they don't understand what giving the other team the first out does
768303767758319616 2016-08-23 04:27:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Budmoonshine @rumbunter I will not thanks
768303294603145217 2016-08-23 04:25:54 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter @Budmoonshine lol terrible made me wanna shoot someone
768102548771213312 2016-08-23 15:08:12 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 yea I just realize and thought of you talking about them liking quantity. Not a fan of how this team is run. Imagine Cole as a 4
768102228519378945 2016-08-23 15:06:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 got traded by billy beane for Brett lawrie if you can believe it coming off two like 6-7 war years in arbitration. Insanity
768101947643600896 2016-08-23 15:05:49 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 yea and they could offset one of those pitchers I just mentioned by letting Morton go in a trade and not signing like Locke
768101471552364545 2016-08-23 15:03:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I just wish they could have added cueto or Cole hamels to their rotation and traded Neil Walker and Pedro for Josh Donaldson
768101175728091136 2016-08-23 15:02:45 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 agree. I was just thinking they have to be risk averse as well the other day.
768100793677324288 2016-08-23 15:01:14 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 only thing about it is the Pirates don't have the money to acquire all of those guys
767865729186013184 2016-08-22 23:27:10 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @BucsDugout praise Jesus
767473608750829570 2016-08-21 21:29:01 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @_BigBen7 @Steelersdepot I used to think it was a good omen when the steelers sucked in the preseason lol
767195927127977984 2016-08-20 03:05:37 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @BlackPplTweet no.
767176528392286208 2016-08-20 01:48:32 UTC <matthewabdelhak> The Pirates better field a complete team next season I swear to god
767167424017735680 2016-08-20 01:12:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap yea that was fun........
767167338063933440 2016-08-20 01:12:01 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap remember when dk acted like you and mueller were nuts on the final word when you said the Pirates are too cheap
767164333235200001 2016-08-20 01:00:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> It's a crying shame the way the Pirates are run hopefully it changes next season but probably not
767148600472109056 2016-08-20 23:57:33 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @InClementeWthr righties batting .187 against him this year pretty concerning
766989204010053632 2016-08-20 13:24:10 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Dejan_Kovacevic @rumbunter he's been good no doubt
766832403348193281 2016-08-19 03:01:06 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JoshYohe_PGH @EASPORTSNHL stunning really byflugein suter karlsson....vlasic.....really
766752086054666240 2016-08-19 21:41:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora yea but he got like thousands of responses to that tweet in like 10 minutes probably pretty annoying
766751540925177856 2016-08-19 21:39:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora probably because he was getting called a pothead a thousand times
766052685237760000 2016-08-17 23:22:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @imau2fan @rumbunter kind of like that one guy from the major league movies
766051711223865344 2016-08-17 23:18:55 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @NimbusHex @Alex_Kozora @subBurgher thanks
766045171557335040 2016-08-17 22:52:55 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Pirates your link is messed up
766043924141977600 2016-08-17 22:47:58 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora who is the db with the towel
765516961321144321 2016-08-16 11:54:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JoshYohe_PGH @WAhockey28 thanks
765514759634497538 2016-08-16 11:45:15 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JoshYohe_PGH what wing does he play
765404538593423360 2016-08-15 04:27:17 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @matthewabdelhak this game and Cole's last start we could have really used that guy
765404005069561856 2016-08-15 04:25:09 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Why the fuck did the Pirates get rid of Caminero 
765389325945049088 2016-08-15 03:26:50 UTC <matthewabdelhak> JungHoDP
765143125861945344 2016-08-15 11:08:31 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Preseason football ...Don't @ me
765140336058310657 2016-08-15 10:57:26 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Only thing left for trump to do now is snort a line of coke off the podium during a debate and then blow Hillary's  head off. #Manafort
765139860826886144 2016-08-15 10:55:33 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Trump is awesome man most entertaining presidential candidate in my lifetime. Scandal bomb. #Manafort
764968780615131136 2016-08-14 23:35:44 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rtjr me too man
764964832726491136 2016-08-14 23:20:03 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @HoustonTexans @NFL I realize the Texans d line is pretty good but that blocking was atrocious
764963546811609089 2016-08-14 23:14:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 agree we could have still gotten rivero and a little more but look on the bright side Olli Maatta is still only 22 
764962668260143104 2016-08-14 23:11:27 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 rivero Fedde and Hearn wouldn't have been unreasonable imo
764962494037176320 2016-08-14 23:10:45 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I like Rivero a lot. Hearn has given up 2 runs in like 2 innings twice and is a complete unknown project. Could've gotten more
764961607520690176 2016-08-14 23:07:14 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 who are you talking about
764652524527718401 2016-08-13 02:39:03 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot only you ........ Like the fourth quarter of the first preseason game
764615729714860032 2016-08-13 00:12:50 UTC <matthewabdelhak> RBI # 400...............................
764613971676495873 2016-08-13 00:05:51 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Oh and those guys totals are with like 50 games left in the season. Oops
764613532474183682 2016-08-13 00:04:06 UTC <matthewabdelhak> But keep telling me how the Pirates are one of the best organizations in baseball it's simple they are not. Mediocre at best. Sorry
764613294262853632 2016-08-13 00:03:09 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Every single one of them could have been had by Pirates and paid for reasonably without giving up top prospects
764613066197573633 2016-08-13 00:02:15 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Not including Josh Donaldson who might be best player in game behind Trout and was traded for Brett Lawrie
764612750613950466 2016-08-13 00:01:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Daniel Murphy Neil Walker Justin Turner Jose Abreu Todd Frazier Johnathan Lucroy combined: 127 HR 399 RBI Average salary 6.82 million
764281225859117056 2016-08-12 02:03:38 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora you should see their strike zone down n to the right
763858061710626816 2016-08-11 22:02:08 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @timwilliamsP2 I'm pretty jealous actually

763565296837734401 2016-08-10 02:38:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @osoAQUAFINA seriously who acts that obnoxious in a meaningless practice to someone who won't make ab salary in his whole life
763564961230524416 2016-08-10 02:37:27 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @osoAQUAFINA if anything he could've thanked the ref for making PRACTICE more challenging for him
763564580714917888 2016-08-10 02:35:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @osoAQUAFINA *measly
763564407326507009 2016-08-10 02:35:15 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @osoAQUAFINA I don't want to tweet about ab acting like a ref didn't earn his measles lunch anymore
763560403544608768 2016-08-10 02:19:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @osoAQUAFINA stop fuckin tweeting me dumbass

763557566567690241 2016-08-10 02:08:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @osoAQUAFINA read the quote out loud 500 times as slow as it takes you homie
763556399020290048 2016-08-10 02:03:26 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @osoAQUAFINA seriously why don't you two dickheads read the original tweet again lol
763555735267520512 2016-08-10 02:00:48 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @osoAQUAFINA you're a retard
763551246816915456 2016-08-10 01:42:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I'm not here to argue with you my man about some fake practice where ab acted like a condescending overpaid ass
763550915131342848 2016-08-10 01:41:38 UTC <matthewabdelhak> yea it was practice and the ref was so offended he reported him to the league probably cause an is a dickhead
763550159426899968 2016-08-10 01:38:38 UTC <matthewabdelhak> I don't really care guy go suck ab dick if you want to do bad he's a diva dickhead who could at least shut his mouth
763549049161068544 2016-08-10 01:34:14 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @MarkKaboly_Trib dude gets paid millions n acts like that because a ref got a meal for dealing with his stupid ass
763548002208190464 2016-08-10 01:30:04 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @MarkKaboly_Trib nah that's ridiculous
763547240161943552 2016-08-10 01:27:02 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @MarkKaboly_Trib that's obscenely obnoxious on so many levels good god
763541590065373184 2016-08-10 01:04:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> The Pirates could lose a spelling bee to a special ed class right now
763540428427714560 2016-08-10 00:59:58 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Here comes Succ-ass-io to dig the hole a little deeper
763534805686362112 2016-08-10 00:37:38 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Actually kind of hoping Edwin Jackson no hits the Pirates
763534025273159680 2016-08-10 00:34:32 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @whygavs the Pirates aren't dumb I don't think just cheap
763507414742163458 2016-08-10 22:48:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @BrinkPG @stephenjnesbitt probably cuz you're a dork
763114576300740608 2016-08-09 20:47:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter ha wasn't sure
763114305105440768 2016-08-09 20:46:42 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter I'm assuming by rough you mean bad
762858181789753346 2016-08-08 03:48:58 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter haha lol
762854092104314880 2016-08-08 03:32:43 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter at least the Giants blew 1st and 3rd nobody out
762842371482460162 2016-08-08 02:46:08 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ThePoniExpress as far as major league lineups go, everybody in the universe > mets

761406980426575872 2016-08-04 03:42:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @stephenjnesbitt Jaso sucks but they are all lazy slime bags so that would be hypocritical though
761294701924278273 2016-08-04 20:16:15 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @PaulZeise @PGSportsNow nice article
761029179492081664 2016-08-03 02:41:10 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Pirates boooooooooooooooooo
761028993105604609 2016-08-03 02:40:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @PaulZeise booooooooooooooooooom
761025512047153162 2016-08-03 02:26:35 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JoshYohe_PGH yes someone is for sure
761024704178114561 2016-08-03 02:23:23 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 amazing how many chances and leads this team has blown
761024531804803072 2016-08-03 02:22:42 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 so in other words behind the cards exactly like previous seasons
761021276852920320 2016-08-03 02:09:46 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @PaulZeise yup it's excellent
760236472003768320 2016-08-01 22:11:14 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 we gave up Reese McGuire too Gavin
760223960428531712 2016-08-01 21:21:31 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 drew Hutchinson man just him
760214445607923712 2016-08-01 20:43:42 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 bye bye neftali Feliz hello Antonio bastardo
760191741123104768 2016-08-01 19:13:29 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 everyone acts like people asking for more expected the bats best prospect and more like chapman returned not really the case
760191400688226304 2016-08-01 19:12:08 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 not asking for giolito Lopez ross Roark turner or difo
760191086765617152 2016-08-01 19:10:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I know we couldn't even get Fedde who is rated lower than Mitch Keller in the Melancon deal to go with rivero
759919533280727044 2016-07-31 01:11:50 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap I have arthritis that used to happen to me too
759860822344552448 2016-07-31 21:18:32 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rtjr they didn't even play Braun or lucroy
759823724191199232 2016-07-31 18:51:07 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @AntonioBrown84 @RapSheet @Steelersdepot ha he wrote almost exactly what you said lol
759823418137059328 2016-07-31 18:49:54 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @RapSheet @Steelersdepot he did
759805602633658368 2016-07-31 17:39:06 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Brian_Metzer @BrinkPG right back at you
759805162886004736 2016-07-31 17:37:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @BrinkPG @Brian_Metzer I can do what I want but thanks sorry your feelings got hurt
759804471681482752 2016-07-31 17:34:37 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @BrinkPG @Brian_Metzer I don't think it's a horrible trade but to act like a chapman return was needed is bull
759804156303450112 2016-07-31 17:33:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Brian_Metzer @BrinkPG literally everyone gets over but you congrats
759803987566563328 2016-07-31 17:32:41 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Brian_Metzer @BrinkPG you got a guy that best case could be Melancon and a complete A ball gamble
759803768355422210 2016-07-31 17:31:49 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Brian_Metzer @BrinkPG nobody was asking for a chapman return which would be an organizations top prospect plus more asshole
759585266843529216 2016-07-30 03:03:34 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JoeStarkey1 seriously that Brewers team sucks
759584923007057921 2016-07-30 03:02:12 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JoeStarkey1 not much you can do when your whole infield catcher n center fielder all suck n ur owner is cheap and already missed everyone
759584571377582081 2016-07-30 03:00:48 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JoeStarkey1 agreed
759583669119889408 2016-07-30 02:57:13 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JoeStarkey1 this tweet is a lot dumber than you think it is
759469429591683072 2016-07-30 19:23:16 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rumbunter he is
759449218180190208 2016-07-30 18:02:58 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @rtjr couldn't agree more
759443934586085376 2016-07-30 17:41:58 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Giants @JollehRoger well maybe if you run the Twitter account for a professional football team you shouldn't spell like an ass
759443637243478018 2016-07-30 17:40:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Giants @JollehRoger oh ok
759440393800785920 2016-07-30 17:27:54 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Giants @damygeebo what?

758846236153647106 2016-07-28 02:06:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @whygavs woooohooooo
758710736684220417 2016-07-28 17:08:30 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Between Bow Wow n his insatiable need for attention n Trump sucking Putins dirty cock it's safe to say we all gonna be dead soon lol 
758708560037613568 2016-07-28 16:59:51 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Everybody tweet about how Bow Wow is only 83.33333 percent black 
758707815498321920 2016-07-28 16:56:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> Look how gangsta Bow Wow is tryin to look in his Twitter avatar like he didn't get squealed by one of his body guards
758705272013590529 2016-07-28 16:46:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> It's ok everyone Bow Wow literally got fucked up his ass 
758704823537639425 2016-07-28 16:45:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @TronDiction also his music always sucked ass he looks like a little bitch n one of his body guards took him right up the ass
758437285868089344 2016-07-27 23:01:54 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora @AdamSchefter ditto
758125172108824576 2016-07-26 02:21:40 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I'm pretty much with you on the marte Cole polanco Glasnow taillon thing
758124467105116160 2016-07-26 02:18:52 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 they have seven potential starters next year not including Locke n Trevor Williams
758124293968437249 2016-07-26 02:18:11 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 how do you feel about Chris sale
758123844754288641 2016-07-26 02:16:24 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I'd be willing to give up Liriano Melancon neise one or two of brault Kuhl Williams kingham tarpley and Harold Ramirez n Hanson
758123360022777861 2016-07-26 02:14:28 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 or Josh Donaldson who only took Brett lawrie which is a joke
758123022175707136 2016-07-26 02:13:08 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I just wish they would have got a guy like scherzer at some point
758122805095346176 2016-07-26 02:12:16 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I think they had 11 guys hitting 300 plus like a month into the season lol
758121692568760323 2016-07-26 02:07:51 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 yea use the 10 you save on Neil plus another 10 and go get a guy like price cueto or even spend less on happ
758120978455011329 2016-07-26 02:05:01 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 I might have brought Neil back but using his money on neise who has been average his whole career is worse imo
758120561465708544 2016-07-26 02:03:21 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 all you have to do with cutch is let him play out next season and if he sucks again don't pick up his option and let him go
758120304036057088 2016-07-26 02:02:20 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 many of these same fans and media came into the season talking about the loss of Pedro n Neil as being the problem too
758120050180050944 2016-07-26 02:01:19 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 probably but the media feeds into it sometimes which makes it worse
758119684554186752 2016-07-26 01:59:52 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 letang Fluery Paul Martin James Neal Neil w Melancon Malkin kessel cam heyward Todd Haley polanco decastro bell the fanbase blows
758118834096082944 2016-07-26 01:56:29 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @GavWill13 that was the height of their insanity as far as I'm concerned anyone who would trade Crosby is a clown
758055948552253440 2016-07-26 21:46:36 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Pitt_MBB those jerseys are sweet man
757943002597687296 2016-07-26 14:17:48 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @stephenjnesbitt @BrinkPG @PittsburghPG I like watching relievers and reliever use oh well the Yankees haven't won in a while so......

757559250008748032 2016-07-25 12:52:54 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DTonPirates Neil Walker is good as the 6th best hitter in your lineup I can't wait till they have to face kershaw in the wildcard game
757558978402324480 2016-07-25 12:51:49 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DTonPirates not to mention he has like 8 right handed homers which will literally never happen again
757558335361077248 2016-07-25 12:49:16 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Josh4Miller @colin_dunlap if you wore light colored khakis with that it could be a good summer outfit
757557975900913668 2016-07-25 12:47:50 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Josh4Miller @colin_dunlap maybe he prefers puke green or Forrest green
757557783650643968 2016-07-25 12:47:05 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Josh4Miller @colin_dunlap I know josh wears strictly black and blue shirts but I think it's ok
757314486986346496 2016-07-24 20:40:18 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @SI_PeterKing cowher would still be running the ball 19 straight times with a 7 pt lead
757003326516895744 2016-07-23 00:03:52 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @StokkeTommy @DTonPirates that's hilarious. ill advised but hilarious nonetheless lol
756600615254581250 2016-07-22 21:23:38 UTC <matthewabdelhak> congrats
756481274273869825 2016-07-22 13:29:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @markus8771 seriously the NBA crushes the NHL amongst minorities and is even more popular amongst whites too more people play it simple
756481021118287872 2016-07-22 13:28:24 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @markus8771 except soccer I guess
756479683668025344 2016-07-22 13:23:05 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @markus8771 no the reason why the NBA is more popular than the NHL is because basketball is a more popular sport than hockey
756478570558464000 2016-07-22 13:18:40 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @fsmikey @carlquintanilla @nbcnewscrew #winning
756477851524706304 2016-07-22 13:15:49 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap @markus8771 I personally am fine with it as is
756474432126713857 2016-07-22 13:02:13 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap it should be hard to score that's what makes the game good not a guy flinging absurdly hard rubber ball at a guy in gym shorts
756474041846804480 2016-07-22 13:00:40 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap like in the NHL I can't wait till its comically easy to score here comes the third 7 goal rally of the poop game
756473542477176834 2016-07-22 12:58:41 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap why does everyone wanna turn every sport into a 18-11 lacrosse game no thanks I'm good
756472384157130752 2016-07-22 12:54:05 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @colin_dunlap making the game shorter to make it longer nice

755953482713137152 2016-07-20 02:32:09 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @JoeStarkey1 Locke can only beat teams like the mets Dodgers n giants if they are missing a bat or two n in a slump

750821829271445506 2016-07-06 22:40:48 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Dahoodrecruiter look at the gun in the cops hand makes it even more obvious that wasn't a gun they pull outta his pocket

748969431091417088 2016-07-01 20:00:02 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @CurlettNate I really thought he sucked ass in Pittsburgh he looked like he was scared to do anything

747161241802543105 2016-06-26 20:14:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DTonPirates I'll say he has changed my mind on him a lot recently especially as a fifth starter I've hated on Locke a lot previously
747159352193089536 2016-06-26 20:07:25 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DTonPirates let him sustain this for a while or beat the Cubs Rockies dbacks away and I'll change my mind but he is still just Locke to me
747159035250675712 2016-06-26 20:06:10 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DTonPirates I still don't think Locke is that good I'll take him over nicasio and neise at this point but feelings really haven't changed
746901763794567168 2016-06-25 03:03:51 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Steelersdepot I'm gonna listen to some dio now

746734297629917185 2016-06-25 15:58:24 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @RCCar30 he costs about 900k so it's not a big gamble and he is pretty talented just can't stay healthy
746731623681449984 2016-06-25 15:47:47 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @BeauBennett19 @PensInsideScoop he should get lots of playing time and if healthy hopefully will succeed

724359560073515008 2016-04-24 22:09:11 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @seleneparekhmd @ESPNSteinLine if it was a torn acl they probably wouldn't call it a sprain is all I'm agree with you most likely MCL
724359221609902080 2016-04-24 22:07:51 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @seleneparekhmd @ESPNSteinLine I know it could be anything but if a team says sprained knee it almost always means MCL
724358693110857729 2016-04-24 22:05:45 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @Alex_Kozora did you take Myles jacks Chondral defect in his knee into consideration lol

696056814895411200 2016-02-06 19:44:11 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisYokish @DavidMTodd missed it by two points oh well final fours that's the key coming up two wins shy of a title
696056511764672513 2016-02-06 19:42:59 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisYokish @DavidMTodd good one enjoy your crap Pitt jump shooting faggot abomination team
696056014429224960 2016-02-06 19:41:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd either way Pitt was ranked majority of weeks for ten years in the top 15 more often than not and top 5-10 a lot as well
696055626053496832 2016-02-06 19:39:27 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd if they win against nova they get to one final four and a couple other tournament games go differently and there is no dispute
696055323958771712 2016-02-06 19:38:15 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd yea and lost to Villanova either way if you take out the last 5 years Pitt is absolutely an elite program
696052861201883136 2016-02-06 19:28:28 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd you know in college basketball once it starts 2 go it's gone kids don't go to a school that frauds talk about like Pitt recently
696052583530516480 2016-02-06 19:27:22 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd if they miss the tourney this year it will be 3/5 since 2010 after a stretch of 10 straight times with six top 3 seeds
696052154730065920 2016-02-06 19:25:40 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @ChrisYokish @DavidMTodd yea because making the tourney 10 years in a row and having a top 3 seed six times is common my man
696051268230320128 2016-02-06 19:22:09 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd two 1 seeds two 2 seeds three 3 seeds and a four seed combined record of 228-54 those years 4 sweet 16s one elite eight
696050210426867712 2016-02-06 19:17:56 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd 2001 29-6 3 seed 2002 28-5 2 seed 2003 31-5 2 seed 2006 29-8 3 seed 2008 31-5 1 seed 2009 25-9 3 seed 2010 28-6 1 seed

696045443717828609 2016-02-06 18:59:00 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd absolutely not they were top 15 most of the time and top 10 a lot I mean a lot look at their tournament seeds it's easier
696044915621388289 2016-02-06 18:56:54 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd top 7 winning percentage since 2001 STILL last five years and these past two years have been horrid especially
696044617502822405 2016-02-06 18:55:43 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd it's like saying that Miami and Virginia and west va aren't top 10 this year
696044470500896768 2016-02-06 18:55:08 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd got to number one with the young n Blair teams and had two number one tournament seeds both teams could have won it all
696044161724624896 2016-02-06 18:53:54 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd every year for a decade plus made it number two twice in two different seasons lost to Syracuse both times or would've been 1
696043905918173184 2016-02-06 18:52:53 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd wrong and dead wrong my man
696043745276329985 2016-02-06 18:52:15 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd maybe if Pitt had more guys like cam johnson sterling smith dame Wilson Chris johnson and those soft ass bigs that's the key
696042542521946112 2016-02-06 18:47:28 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd people who just started watching basketball fucking yesterday
696042450620551168 2016-02-06 18:47:06 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd this program was one of the top 5 or 10 in the country for like a decade plus and has been completely bastardized by..........
696042159393284097 2016-02-06 18:45:57 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @DavidMTodd if they win one of their upcoming big games and get like 5-6 wins including ACC tournament they will get in
696041318116515840 2016-02-06 18:42:36 UTC <matthewabdelhak> @PaulZeise more scoring talk I see yes that's the goddamn answer Pitt is playing in this game just it's the other team now
