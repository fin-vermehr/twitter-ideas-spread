970780305308168192 2018-03-05 21:57:15 UTC <madapple13> @talkSPORTLive @thomasjrennie United just closed the gap ...............................................................to 16 points
970769611221274625 2018-03-05 21:14:45 UTC <madapple13> @Dakeb_MCFC I absolutely believe that!
970769288637362178 2018-03-05 21:13:29 UTC <madapple13> @Dakeb_MCFC Two, with United's loss at Liverpool this weekend.
970323097458003968 2018-03-04 15:40:28 UTC <madapple13> @markgoldbridge Agree. Who you support just doesn't matter when thing like this happen.
970126595376799744 2018-03-03 02:39:39 UTC <madapple13> @markgoldbridge I like Martial and Rashford, dont understand why they dont get the love from Jose. I believe under Pep, the best English player would be Rashford, I believe hes a far superior and natural talent over Harry Kane. hope they dont mentally destroy him.
969973805539057665 2018-03-03 16:32:31 UTC <madapple13> @thomasjrennie Can't wait to hear your reaction on the West Ham game on Friday. Better than the Riola comment?

969676132659486720 2018-03-02 20:49:40 UTC <madapple13> @markgoldbridge You mean youre not happy with the soon to be 30 year old Chilean bench warmer that City took a L for?
969300650411675653 2018-03-01 19:57:38 UTC <madapple13> @RodneyMarsh10 Rodney, is your family in Arsenal crisis mode yet?
968801152857985029 2018-02-28 10:52:48 UTC <madapple13> @markgoldbridge Too late. Everyone sees what you guys are seeing. Pep was right, he would disrupt chemistry, poor Rashford and Martial are paying the price
968687082104410113 2018-02-27 03:19:32 UTC <madapple13> @MayorLevine No thank you. And you can keep that Sheriff from Coward County with ya.

966716301011030016 2018-02-22 16:48:21 UTC <madapple13> @markgoldbridge Not to fan any flames here Mark, but Pep said Sanchez would ruin the chemistry in City, people laughed him off and said he was bitter and sour grapes. He was a cancer at Arsenal, Chile, and now in your locker room. Awful signing.
966390314570321920 2018-02-21 19:13:00 UTC <madapple13> @Manchesterspeak Wait to Sanchez is on the bench. Hazard hates him.

964175303147913216 2018-02-15 16:31:20 UTC <madapple13> @pkedrosky I still dont understand the Cuthino but, especially after what they paid for Dembele at Barcelona. RB Leipzig are the only club in Bundesleague who dont have a majority supporter and they are despised by other supporters, its just the way it is. Swansea is a mess
964174302114385925 2018-02-15 16:27:21 UTC <madapple13> @pkedrosky By the way, there has been a takeover at Serie A by Chinese owners, and it hasnt worked.
964174114855505920 2018-02-15 16:26:37 UTC <madapple13> @pkedrosky But you still need the know how to recognize talent, and then put it together. Money hasnt been an issue at United, but they no longer have the know to recognize talent and make it work on the pitch.
963913208934395905 2018-02-14 23:09:52 UTC <madapple13> @rezendi @pkedrosky Congrats. Your team did well. I was one short of the. 4-0 prediction. See you in the next round

962373156928393217 2018-02-10 17:10:15 UTC <madapple13> @ussoccer @kylemartino Tribalism at its best. The biggest losers are the talents in the inner city today. At least I  dont have to endure 4 years of worthless friendlies, and watching US Soccer throw money at a problem. Sorry Kyle, you were the best candidate. At least well have you back on Tv soon.
962371402979577856 2018-02-10 17:03:17 UTC <madapple13> @ESPNFC Tribalism in politics, and now soccer. At least I don't have to endure 4 years of worthless friendlies or NIT style tournament w/ these guys
962370755517407233 2018-02-10 17:00:42 UTC <madapple13> @BackTheCops @JuzBlaze143 I agree. Sad world we live in, that's why you have to make the most of everyday.

962367248764686339 2018-02-10 16:46:46 UTC <madapple13> @thesoccerdon Of course you selected him. The Status Quo, congrats. Don't look forward to seeing you in the inner cities, and looking for talent.
962364254312718337 2018-02-10 16:34:52 UTC <madapple13> @GrantWahl Well at least I don't have to watch this disaster for the next four years, or their worthless friendlies. Sunil remains President w Cordero
962362118413651974 2018-02-10 16:26:23 UTC <madapple13> @kylemartino Wondering why the world laughs at our program, look at the tribalism in this election. The Status Quo seems to prevail

962324719142952960 2018-02-10 13:57:46 UTC <madapple13> @GrantWahl @kylemartino I dont want to see him or any of his cronies running US Soccer (or football for you snobs), they only care about the corporate side of things, and not looking for talent with one scout in areas they feel safe looking.

957203218693488645 2018-01-27 10:46:45 UTC <madapple13> @debrxyne17 Sanchez .... the $650k sub next year.
957181561077665792 2018-01-27 09:20:42 UTC <madapple13> @old_dev68 Happy bday ... getting busy living, or get busy dying ... always feel like youre in your 20s ...
957181154167320577 2018-01-27 09:19:05 UTC <madapple13> @Samir_Madani I do too. Fave role was Doc Holiday in Tombstone. An iconic role. He stole the movie. You must be Doc Holiday, you retired too? ... Me, no, Im in my prime.
957180415244193792 2018-01-27 09:16:09 UTC <madapple13> @ajs_ajsblue1 Its why Im not bitter about him. He plays hard and after a mistake holds his head up. Defenders get better as they age, he will be no different. Still have high hopes for him and hope all supporters do to.
957179283717476352 2018-01-27 09:11:39 UTC <madapple13> @ajs_ajsblue1 Agree. Just need Stones to tighten up. Hopefully with Laporte in, the competition will spark him to get back to where he was before the injury.

957177687038185472 2018-01-27 09:05:18 UTC <madapple13> @Samir_Madani Lo. It was one of my favorite movies ever, so I know the story line. It was called Cold Fusion in the movie.
957177391037800448 2018-01-27 09:04:08 UTC <madapple13> @ajs_ajsblue1 You know this Snchez thing is going to blow up in their face. Its unsustainable to pay a player this much, as they did, or Moanrhino and Madrid did for CR7, to keep Sanchez and other players happy. Sanchez will eventually check out and think about his dogs.
957175271903375361 2018-01-27 08:55:42 UTC <madapple13> @Samir_Madani Storyline to the Saint, 1995 I believe with Val Kilmer
957174726278942720 2018-01-27 08:53:32 UTC <madapple13> @ajs_ajsblue1 Waiting for this LOW FRUIT to have his first Diva moment and that fallout with Moan-rhino, then the bench. Its going to be epic to see a 30 plus over paid player on the bench end his managers career.

954361343112605696 2018-01-19 14:34:10 UTC <madapple13> @thomasjrennie Welcome back Tom, great to hear you back here in the States. You must have really been hung over after that Manchester party.

Look at Morata and Lacazette, their managers have pretty much admitted they are surprised by the physicality of the EPL. So no, I wouldnt take Messi, you need a certain toughness for the EPL

947143764488933380 2017-12-30 16:34:05 UTC <madapple13> Mo Salah that is .. is beast
947143637959364608 2017-12-30 16:33:35 UTC <madapple13> No Salah is beast.
947124320328921088 2017-12-30 15:16:49 UTC <madapple13> @UnitedStandMUFC You guys look strong at the moment ..... currently holding up City and Chelsea at the moment in 3rd, while keeping one foot on the ledge above Liverpool.
947123232519442433 2017-12-30 15:12:29 UTC <madapple13> @markgoldbridge @UnitedStandMUFC I have to admit, United has a strong team, theyre holding up City and Chelsea in third place at the moment.

946090244390002688 2017-12-27 18:47:46 UTC <madapple13> @mikegolubowskii @allforunited @TomDod8 Ottamendi is 26, Silva 31, Kompany 32. The players bought, like our children, are here to replace us.
946078343828594688 2017-12-27 18:00:29 UTC <madapple13> Congrats ... now finish above United!
946073547927117827 2017-12-27 17:41:25 UTC <madapple13> @mikegolubowskii @allforunited As for Fellini, Mou is begging him to stay.
946073434425053184 2017-12-27 17:40:58 UTC <madapple13> @mikegolubowskii @allforunited Pep is building a young team, and Mou wont and doesnt trust young players. Would he start Jesus at 19, no, he doesnt fancy young players. Its a mentality he wont accept, and I am sure the United board wants him to sell players before spending again.
946072796609892352 2017-12-27 17:38:26 UTC <madapple13> @mikegolubowskii @allforunited Well, they were bought with the intention that were going to be good. Pep inherited Kovalev, zabaleta, an old Yay Toure, Clinchy, and a host of other players he shipped off. Your board doesnt want to take a loss on players they dont want.

945950082423279616 2017-12-27 09:30:49 UTC <madapple13> @allforunited @Groceyboy This is the Pogba thing again. Now its Bailey.
945949504154546176 2017-12-27 09:28:31 UTC <madapple13> @allforunited @Groceyboy Agree in many ways. However, how do they feel when their manager said he needs more money for better players to compete? I think thats the mistake hes making with these three capable and very good players. If this is a lost season let them develop together
945940345921179648 2017-12-27 08:52:07 UTC <madapple13> @allforunited As for Arsenal, Wenger feels if he saves Stan some money hell keep his job. But his owner owns the Rams and a hockey team here in the States, and they are far worse than Arsenal, except this yer for the Rams. Top 4 for the Gunners is all that matters
945939662035660800 2017-12-27 08:49:24 UTC <madapple13> @allforunited I am just making the point of development. Delph a left back. Stones increasingly better. Sterling scoring goals. Investment in your players is just as important as spending millions. You cant always throw money at your problem
945939040217501696 2017-12-27 08:46:56 UTC <madapple13> @allforunited I agree. I just dont understand with the three young players he has at his disposal why he would want to pay for someone like Griezeman who plays in a softer league, and not build around them and unleash them. Thats my problem with the Special once, development of a player
945934030150750208 2017-12-27 08:27:02 UTC <madapple13> @allforunited On your first question, perhaps other clubs are trying to stick it to him, Im mean he is the most cordial person
945933657600118784 2017-12-27 08:25:33 UTC <madapple13> @allforunited You dont need a billion to beat Leicester, Stoke, Huddersfield, Brighton, Liverpool, Chelsea. He is being passed by the evolution of the game. He has Lingard, Martial, and Rashford, three players who can out run a sunami, and hes failing to develop them properly
945827488818696193 2017-12-26 01:23:40 UTC <madapple13> @markgoldbridge City has spent 80 million less than United. Didnt know you need a billion to beat Leicester, Bristol, Stoke, Chelsea, Burnley, Liverpool... carry on jerkoff

943937546538684417 2017-12-21 20:13:43 UTC <madapple13> @UnitedStandMUFC @notherView @MrDaMedusa You have a point. However, how was it fair for the league then when Fergie had the pick of the lot, and no one could compete on the field and in payroll. Also, its not how much you spend, but how you spend it. These players were available for everyone to pick. Scouting counts.
943622693395599361 2017-12-20 23:22:36 UTC <madapple13> @City_Chief Yup, these players are risking a ban in a World Cup year.

942398904653484032 2017-12-17 14:19:42 UTC <madapple13> @UnitedStandMUFC @christianbn1997 You dont watch City games. Stones has started almost every game since last season. 95 million for a dancer and 75 m for a chubby striker, 27m for Markytarian, who doesnt play, 35 for a substitute defender Lindeholf. Should I go on. Who has Jose developed? Look belowpic.twitter.com/pdzjfETwpH

942397366145044481 2017-12-17 14:13:35 UTC <madapple13> @UnitedStandMUFC @christianbn1997 Moanrhino is destroying the best young player in England, Rashford, and playing an overweight striker than a fast pace Martial.
942396696805429249 2017-12-17 14:10:56 UTC <madapple13> @UnitedStandMUFC @christianbn1997 Are you serious? Delph is a starter. Sterling is Mercenary like Zlatan and his 100 teams or Moanrhino and his 300 teams after being fired from the last? Stones is a key piece of the Defense. How did Pep destroy him. Did you see him against Brazil?

942114430090964994 2017-12-16 19:29:18 UTC <madapple13> @GaryLineker @Astonthebarber @Tony_Artza Objectively, Ill say ManU has deadwood from the LVG days, and it may be hampering your buying power. But your club spent a whole lot on two players Lukaku and Pogba. And now they are on the outs with Markytarian, you cant buy chemistry and coaching

941497846293057536 2017-12-14 02:39:13 UTC <madapple13> @ReformedBroker Pleasure to see Carmelo stink. This rebuild should have begun when Carmelo a few years ago when he was an FA. This team has come play every night.
941320882286407680 2017-12-14 14:56:01 UTC <madapple13> @RodneyMarsh10 If you recall, KDB did pull a hamstring and we lost him for a few weeks, and the season seemed to turn.

For whatever reason, it seems whoever is ready to bow to them will be considered.

939185048628203520 2017-12-08 17:28:59 UTC <madapple13> @WESH Politics are dirty.
939184700979122176 2017-12-08 17:27:36 UTC <madapple13> @MLS @kylemartino MLS endorsement of this candidate shows they were never interested in having a new direction and in many ways have Gullatis failure continue to make its corporate supporters happy.
939183476351397888 2017-12-08 17:22:44 UTC <madapple13> @kylemartino @MLS Germanys National Team broke free of its domestic league, and made the league work for them, and the product on the field is its proof. US Soccer need to follow this example and strip away its corporate ties, and make @MLS work for the National team.
939182616837853185 2017-12-08 17:19:19 UTC <madapple13> @kylemartino Its amazing that @MLS will nominate Kathy Carter for IS Soccer President, and continue the path of its started to failure, instead of looking to new voices to kickstart the program.
939154011336445952 2017-12-08 15:25:39 UTC <madapple13> @IanCheeseman I believe so, but here in the States, the bandwagon belongs to United.

938050085098807296 2017-12-05 14:19:03 UTC <madapple13> @AmericanOutlaws Out with old, in with the new. We need a new vision not pushed by corporations, but by the game. Too long this current regime, with her, has failed to look inside the inner cities, like Brazil, for the talent that has been growing under their nose. The USMNT needs a new direction
937867865142808578 2017-12-04 02:14:58 UTC <madapple13> @SenateGOP @SenWarren @Leslieelf Okay. Will do.
937866564946268160 2017-12-04 02:09:48 UTC <madapple13> @SenateGOP @SenWarren @Leslieelf Work for the people. Whos the fool?
937860527929397249 2017-12-04 01:45:49 UTC <madapple13> @AlexMorash It is a design question. Not necessarily why service was denied, but also the question of discrimination may be shot down.

937858539678322688 2017-12-04 01:37:55 UTC <madapple13> @markgoldbridge @dsaadUnited Griezeman is 26 and if hes not consistent, is he worth the expense. Every effort should be made to develop Rashford, who is the best young player in England, Griezeman would hamper that with Martial still there.
937836519079006211 2017-12-04 00:10:24 UTC <madapple13> @stuholden @AlexZepeda100 Dude, he hoped the US would lose in the last World Cup after he was cut. No thanks
937836184809758721 2017-12-04 00:09:05 UTC <madapple13> @AlexiLalas @stuholden Kyle Martino is your man. Calm, collected, smart.

937816037176827904 2017-12-04 22:49:01 UTC <madapple13> @AntonioSabatoJr No it was simple.
937809384352157696 2017-12-04 22:22:35 UTC <madapple13> @kylemartino No Gulatti, the path is set Mr. President
937807812385652736 2017-12-04 22:16:20 UTC <madapple13> @markgoldbridge @dsaadUnited And this is why Conte is crying about all the games, he won last season because the schedule favored him. And a perfect example is Wenger bringing players from other leagues and theyre not playing a whole lot of games because of injuries or the style of Prem League.
937806332006207488 2017-12-04 22:10:27 UTC <madapple13> @markgoldbridge @dsaadUnited Morata looks promising, but theyre a soft League. I am not a fan of Neville, but he was fired because La Liga players could not cope with a tougher style. And its not like Griezeman is lighting up his league. Hes a Ligue 1 player and why hell end up at PSG
937802373749248000 2017-12-04 21:54:44 UTC <madapple13> @markgoldbridge @dsaadUnited On Messis level, seriously? I dont believe any player from those leagues can play in a physical league like the Prem League. Theyre figure skaters. 6 week breaks, theyll play here a bit, and resold back there. There are the exceptions but ....
937797794919866369 2017-12-04 21:36:32 UTC <madapple13> @Chicago1Ray And not one NFL player kneels for this
937783303393988609 2017-12-04 20:38:57 UTC <madapple13> @ananavarro I said the same thing.
937767522622984192 2017-12-04 19:36:14 UTC <madapple13> @MrDtAFC It's Mark Goldbridge's team.
937766717668909056 2017-12-04 19:33:03 UTC <madapple13> @markgoldbridge @benthomasH34 True,  I would say the same. The last three games he seems a bit tired, Pogba, is still not 100% but when he is, I hate when great players dont seem to give a greater effort. Pogba is naturally gifted, KDB is growing because of hard work.
937765819307708416 2017-12-04 19:29:28 UTC <madapple13> @markgoldbridge @benthomasH34 Van Gaals I meant. Spell check
937765683567480833 2017-12-04 19:28:56 UTC <madapple13> @markgoldbridge @benthomasH34 I can objectively say, when Jose rids himself of Van Gails mess, its when well see the best of United.
937765395993366529 2017-12-04 19:27:47 UTC <madapple13> @markgoldbridge @benthomasH34 I watch both teams, its whats fed to us here in the States.
937765138433806338 2017-12-04 19:26:46 UTC <madapple13> @markgoldbridge @benthomasH34 And if he did, then it'll be a legitimate claim.
937765002366341129 2017-12-04 19:26:14 UTC <madapple13> @markgoldbridge @benthomasH34 No, but more important. Pogba is beast, but I'll take KDB, he likes to work, Pogba sometimes doesn't look dedicated to his craft
937764431890612226 2017-12-04 19:23:58 UTC <madapple13> @markgoldbridge @benthomasH34 It was, but Silva's was GAME WINNER.

937686872599486464 2017-12-04 14:15:46 UTC <madapple13> @RodneyMarsh10 Don't forget that Pogba wished harm on City players with the Hopes of catching City.

935709659872317441 2017-11-28 03:19:02 UTC <madapple13> @option_snipper safe travels. Touch the Pacific for me.
935701877773217792 2017-11-28 02:48:06 UTC <madapple13> @option_snipper I dont agree. I am sure the competition will stiffen, and as this market continues to run upwards, I think Tech is going to get beat up a bit next year. On another note, thanks for the BABA spot, you and N. Korea helped it fall below the 187.50 put. Did you know about NK?

935696985314746370 2017-11-28 02:28:40 UTC <madapple13> @ABC7NY @RyanFieldABC As A Jetss fan, this is a dumb move. He is a horrible coach, and very much like Rex Ryan, some coordinators need to stay as such. In five weeks, and this hurts like holy hell, I feel the Giants will be better off without him.
935692245696679936 2017-11-28 02:09:50 UTC <madapple13> @option_snipper So many analysts are saying the party is over for NVDA. It does seem it is a bit overvalued, and historically chips are ever this high.

935613639427575809 2017-11-28 20:57:29 UTC <madapple13> @1cornishblue Ive been watching it. Some good chances, but theres another half and Pogba, Lukaku, Lingard look slow. Hope they blow it. Would love to see Goldbridge give birth to a donkey.

This plan will kill the golden goose in the market, and for what a promise to the selected few who didnt want him elected to begin
932251013729439744 2017-11-19 14:15:36 UTC <madapple13> @ReformedBroker Horrible plan. If someoneone makes 5 mil, they are not going to reinvest into the economy, they are going to save it, while others, under 75k, will be taxed and unable to reinvest whats left over to the economy. This is a recession type plan.

930116627848400896 2017-11-13 16:54:19 UTC <madapple13> @jpbaric For me its having something tangible, although money is digital. But the number one reason it MAY fail, is the old guard and their institutions.
930059288676102144 2017-11-13 13:06:28 UTC <madapple13> @UnitedStandMUFC Aguero had a cracked rib and tried to play the next game, or lose his starting spot. Its unbelievable that United fans have to endure this. Mou need to rid himself of loyalty for the sake of your season.
930058444249419776 2017-11-13 13:03:07 UTC <madapple13> @UnitedStandMUFC And Aguero with a cracked rib was trying to play a few days later, knowing his injury, would of lost his spot starting. Unbelievable. I cant believe United fans are relying on Pogba.

928657104239583233 2017-11-09 16:14:41 UTC <madapple13> @GerberKawasaki It may become the new safehaven, and I think that's what the old guards are afraid of.

928656533226999808 2017-11-09 16:12:25 UTC <madapple13> @GerberKawasaki options and how it plays out.
928656396979200000 2017-11-09 16:11:53 UTC <madapple13> @GerberKawasaki Then the flood gates of Bitcoin will open. In the meantime, I like having somethin tangible, although money often isn't until I see the CBOE
928656186119016448 2017-11-09 16:11:03 UTC <madapple13> @GerberKawasaki I absolutely agree. I wonder if like ETFs, which weren't loved once, will it have the same effect. I believe Amazon will be the first .
928653967256621056 2017-11-09 16:02:14 UTC <madapple13> @GerberKawasaki Although money is digital today, like bitcoin, the argument for both makes me feel like I have thick glasses with good vision.
928625896826789888 2017-11-09 14:10:41 UTC <madapple13> @KenzieThirkill Have you seen what Fitzpatrick has done, and what the Jets did to best running team last week? Oh, and NO Mike Evans. Totally bias tip btw.

922570481710043136 2017-10-23 21:08:38 UTC <madapple13> @UnitedStandMUFC City are paying for a result, not a service. Mou treats management as a service or a favor for Man U, different attitudes between the two
922569706732531712 2017-10-23 21:05:33 UTC <madapple13> @Joey7Barton You are paid for a result, not a service. Money is invested in results, not everyone can do well with such a a responsibility.
