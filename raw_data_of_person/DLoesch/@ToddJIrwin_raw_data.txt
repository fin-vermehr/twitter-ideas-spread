And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying, 'Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.'
944962498146586624 2017-12-24 16:06:30 UTC <ToddJIrwin> And the angel said unto them; fear not, for behold, I bring unto you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the City of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.
944961839716282368 2017-12-24 16:03:53 UTC <ToddJIrwin> And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.

699998881807872000 2016-02-17 16:48:33 UTC <ToddJIrwin> @DCraelin and was later changed as should have been
699998584654041090 2016-02-17 16:47:22 UTC <ToddJIrwin> @DCraelin tyrants believe themselves to be the law or above the law that's why our laws r codified starting w/constitution & bill of rights
699963477109112836 2016-02-17 14:27:52 UTC <ToddJIrwin> @DCraelin what happens when you are in the minority? Constitution & rule of law are meant to protect an individual's rights against majority
699804272037236736 2016-02-16 03:55:14 UTC <ToddJIrwin> @DCraelin incompatible concepts - that's why we have a constitution & separation of powers; pure majority rules tramples individual rights
699801196408676352 2016-02-16 03:43:01 UTC <ToddJIrwin> @peacebewithus11 where do you come up with this stuff?! Now you're just making up positions to argue against - you really don't need my help
699799324436213760 2016-02-16 03:35:35 UTC <ToddJIrwin> @peacebewithus11 - Amen! Politicians are an untrustworthy lot! I trust myself infinitely more than any politician; & certainly more than mob
699798636658446336 2016-02-16 03:32:51 UTC <ToddJIrwin> @DCraelin On the contrary, like TJ, all for less government, more individual freedom & personal responsibility
699792095792525312 2016-02-16 03:06:51 UTC <ToddJIrwin> @peacebewithus11 Not remotely - 2 many laws already, need fewer not more; I take the responsibility of voting 4 elected reps very seriously
699784436968243201 2016-02-16 02:36:25 UTC <ToddJIrwin> @DCraelin pure democracy leads to mob rule; w/o the protection of the rule of law, majority rules can run roughshod over individual liberty
699783824109080576 2016-02-16 02:33:59 UTC <ToddJIrwin> @peacebewithus11 hence the rule of law not of man! Law protects against mob rule. Less government = more freedom
699743678626140161 2016-02-16 23:54:28 UTC <ToddJIrwin> @peacebewithus11 judiciary has most potential 2 be the despotic branch (-TJ) also why 3 separate branches r critical, not just majority rule
699734474876059648 2016-02-16 23:17:53 UTC <ToddJIrwin> @peacebewithus11 Indeed - that's why it is so critical that   our elected reps confirm strict constructionists to the courts
699732085767012353 2016-02-16 23:08:24 UTC <ToddJIrwin> @peacebewithus11 quite certain they won't!! Thank God for the 2nd Amendment!
699731073282998272 2016-02-16 23:04:22 UTC <ToddJIrwin> @DCraelin It is purposeful that every citizen does not vote on every bill (democracy);rule of law protects rights against majority rule
699727544216633348 2016-02-16 22:50:21 UTC <ToddJIrwin> @DCraelin @ToddJIrwin what was the last bill the you voted on? You - not your elected representative

699725889492381697 2016-02-16 22:43:46 UTC <ToddJIrwin> @peacebewithus11 not sure who is telling you that. Pure democracy equates to mob rule; constitution protects the rights of the individual
699722633613414400 2016-02-16 22:30:50 UTC <ToddJIrwin> @peacebewithus11 representative democracy is how we elect our reps; constitutional republic is the framework - a nation of laws, not of men
