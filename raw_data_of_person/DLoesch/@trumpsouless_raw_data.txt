970129552029683714 2018-03-03 02:51:23 UTC <trumpsouless> @EthanDolan The world ended and started right back where it left off. Weird!
970129113372594176 2018-03-03 02:49:39 UTC <trumpsouless> @realDonaldTrump That being said. America should loan Jared $800 Billion Dollars. He promises to pay it back with interest and maybe he'll even throw in a few Ivanka nudies as interest. And trust me I'm interested!!  WINNING!!

970105074570719232 2018-03-03 01:14:08 UTC <trumpsouless> @RealJack Fortify the closets. Make the closet into a saferoom with a gun turret and laser guided poisonous darts. Easy!!
970103987604217856 2018-03-03 01:09:48 UTC <trumpsouless> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @DTrumpPoll @ajtorres71 @Ariuszme I simply asked him to hold my top secret folder for the weekend while I went  on a bender with a couple of Russian hookers. How could've I known he'd open the folder? MSM Always jumping to collusions I mean conclusions. Sad!
970101569827033090 2018-03-03 01:00:12 UTC <trumpsouless> @dbongino @AmandaPresto That washing machine was Yuge! I have a gold plated one in Mar Lago I wash my big boy undies in.

970099934535061504 2018-03-03 00:53:42 UTC <trumpsouless> Ok , so a lot of people have been telling me that my son in law Jared looks like a movie star. I was hoping you could get him a roll in your next big movie and maybe buy a condo from him. He's as qualified to act as he is to be in the White House!! Thanks Bigly @johncusack
970098555368148992 2018-03-03 00:48:13 UTC <trumpsouless> @johncusack @RichardHaass I just have to say the White House is not in disarray. Melania makes me pick up after myself and put my shoes in the closet.. More Fake News!!
970098138777341953 2018-03-03 00:46:34 UTC <trumpsouless> @CNN @JeffFlake @davidaxelrod Just thinking out loud here. How bout invite all Mexicans to Texas  then gerrymander the Mexican boarder!! And Trump for the win. Genuius!!
