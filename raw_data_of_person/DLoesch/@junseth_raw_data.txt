970903278727942144 2018-03-05 06:05:54 UTC <junseth> @pierre_rochard Because they are being touted as investments. The problem with icos is they are useless, not equity, definitely securities, and look a lot like private money. They are sold as useful, equity, not securities, and not money. This is securities fraud.
970901980632768512 2018-03-05 06:00:45 UTC <junseth> @pierre_rochard Except these icos are highly liquid, not equity, and generally useful for spending. In fact a lot of icos are paying their teams in their ico tokens.

970147372876443648 2018-03-03 04:02:12 UTC <junseth> @chartingbitcoin 2/ There is no reason for bearer bonds to be used in the movement of money between IoT devices unless the risk of the paying party to default exists.

970146019978575872 2018-03-03 03:56:50 UTC <junseth> @chartingbitcoin I have to agree that that is the only definition of smart contract I agree with. Before 2015 we called those computer programs. And there is no reason you couldn't do that with a credit card or venmo.

Libertarians would say they should have the right to delete speech they dislike. But I think they have a bit of a monopoly on video/audio content.

968859797410914304 2018-02-28 14:45:50 UTC <junseth> @TehBosslec Well, hilariously, my first proposal was to do research on gift card prices.
968859384020217856 2018-02-28 14:44:12 UTC <junseth> @gsgreene I have google alerts on this project going back years. Let me grab some of the highlights.
968858236035072005 2018-02-28 14:39:38 UTC <junseth> @TehBosslec I have another saying: "Rewards of number one are not exponentially more than number 9. But rewards for getting on the list are exponentially more than not being on the list at all. Just ask the FBI." This is how I ended up with an A on my thesis and a B in my thesis class.
968855320993787905 2018-02-28 14:28:03 UTC <junseth> @TehBosslec Yeah, #9 is the pinnacle of achievement in my life. I have a saying Oslec: Never try to win; just aim for being the penultimate person on the list. That way you're not last. Which means... you didn't lose. #russianforeignpolicy

968850982707720192 2018-02-28 14:10:49 UTC <junseth> @gsgreene Greg, if you haven't heard of this, it's even more funny than you can imagine. They get arrested whenever they go. The land is uncultivated, nothing is on it, and they wet their pants when they showed a Liberland passport to get into Serbia and they let them through.

966429960704548864 2018-02-21 21:50:32 UTC <junseth> @GoldTelegraph_ @Cam10438560 @Marcsmyname The so-called bailouts were mostly loans (which were largely paid back). And QE was a way to lessen the blow of the crisis. It is not the same as printing money.

Short of locking a person in the basement and chaining them to a radiator, as soon as they are capable of leaving they're not a slave.

966327503001354241 2018-02-21 15:03:24 UTC <junseth> @rogerkver @bedehomender @Truthcoin @lykle @abrkn You do support it by letting the state protect your property.
966298675961049088 2018-02-21 13:08:51 UTC <junseth> @rogerkver @bedehomender @Truthcoin @abrkn @lykle That's so dumb. Libertarians have this idea that they will see they had had the darwinian opportunity to survive in a state of nature. But that's not how things work. Dreaming about Utopias is what communists do.
966167172987879424 2018-02-20 04:26:19 UTC <junseth> @rogerkver @abrkn Classy is for opera goers. You and I are Libertarians which necessarily means we possess an IQ too low for the Opera.

966124365355147271 2018-02-20 01:36:13 UTC <junseth> @rogerkver @bedehomender @Truthcoin @abrkn @lykle Lol, the reason to want taxes to be voluntary is that you don't want to pay. Unless the state is a church, you'll never be compelled enough to give to the state. The state compels you to give a reasonable amount. The amount is between reluctant compliance and overthrow.

966102885313499136 2018-02-20 00:10:51 UTC <junseth> @rogerkver @abrkn @bedehomender @Truthcoin Haha, I have always attributed it to Bastiat. But you're right.
966069032851034114 2018-02-20 21:56:20 UTC <junseth> @rogerkver @abrkn @rm0rf Well, you can't have that debate when the other side claims that it's theft. Hyperbole is the essence of moralizing issues.
966068010611068931 2018-02-20 21:52:17 UTC <junseth> @rogerkver @abrkn Taxation isn't theft. That's dumb. Put your Bastiat down.
966059198625837056 2018-02-20 21:17:16 UTC <junseth> @rogerkver Which is why you marginal tax rates are set to tax the rich reasonably.
966051893469425664 2018-02-20 20:48:14 UTC <junseth> @FLBitcoiner @BtcDanny It's not about shutting down the debate. It's that if you make a law banning assault rifles, it doesn't actually achieve what these people think it achieves.
965996518959472640 2018-02-20 17:08:12 UTC <junseth> @3ducat3d Not sure. Maybe you can buy it on Yobit and cryptopia. But I haven't actually looked because I'm going to stay far far away from this debacle.
965995882024984576 2018-02-20 17:05:40 UTC <junseth> @little1deas Truth. It requires an act of Congress. It's an endrun around their own regulations, which is nuts.
965994962197405697 2018-02-20 17:02:00 UTC <junseth> @FLBitcoiner @Truthcoin Apparently it means that the gun delivers damage in three fast bursts. You can play @FortniteGame if you're interested in learning Paul. ;P
965961785328263170 2018-02-20 14:50:10 UTC <junseth> Why does @Kodak need to build an image rights token when http://imagerights.com already registers your informatino to the blockchain? https://www.imagerights.com/blockchain-inscription
965961509313622016 2018-02-20 14:49:05 UTC <junseth> The only good point I've heard in the gun debate post shooting is the following from @FLBitcoiner: the AR 15 isn't an assault rifle. So.. maybe before we express any opinions in the gun debate again, maybe we should all spend a few minutes educating ourselves on guns.

965959762801283073 2018-02-20 14:42:08 UTC <junseth> Well "We Call BS" isn't exactly "I Have a Dream" but I guess that's what you get when kids are LARPing as speechwriting aficionados. Where's @PatrickBuchanan when you need him?  https://www.facebook.com/cnn/videos/10157980855316509/
965959389491417089 2018-02-20 14:40:39 UTC <junseth> @6BetBluff Weirdly, establishment will likely see this as legitimizing. What I'm waiting for is the reports that high-up government officials in Venezuela are mining Bitcoin. They have been confiscating miners for months and calling the miners to help them setup the equipment they stole.

They get there slowly, innocuously. I don't think Damore is particularly interesting. But I do have a lot of trouble w nlrb saying that his firing merited.

It's exactly the same number of conversions to go from alt to btc to fiat as going alt to tether to fiat (if u can eve exit) and btc has more exits. So going to tether is an indication that you're staying in but sidelining your $$$.
961036635386404864 2018-02-06 00:39:23 UTC <junseth> So... if all this #Bitcoin collapse went into tethers... everything's about to go right back up.

959309407925428226 2018-02-01 06:16:00 UTC <junseth> It strikes me that people think that the price of ETH indicates the quality or survivability of the blockchain.

You seem to think there are technological restrictions in the way here. All you've done is reduced things to netting which will mean that actual settlement takes no less time.
957830340931964930 2018-01-28 04:18:43 UTC <junseth> @robertjacksons @HammerToe @effyoomoney Yes. False. The transaction isn't completed until the money is settled. All you've done is shoved off the settlement to a different bank if XRP worked. So a bank gets the XRP and then is still dependent on the liquidity in the local market to settle their funds.
957820104191938560 2018-01-28 03:38:02 UTC <junseth> @robertjacksons @effyoomoney @HammerToe What exactly have you proven here other than that ripple doesn't actually settle?

957755760389353474 2018-01-28 23:22:22 UTC <junseth> @robertjacksons @HammerToe @effyoomoney No it doesn't. It regresses to netting. Netting is what we have now.
957755639090032641 2018-01-28 23:21:53 UTC <junseth> @robertjacksons @effyoomoney @HammerToe Has the bitcoin company ever asked for someone's funds to be frozen?
957755524120006656 2018-01-28 23:21:25 UTC <junseth> @effyoomoney @HammerToe @robertjacksons Lol. You know nothing about my holdings.
957755025085911050 2018-01-28 23:19:26 UTC <junseth> @robertjacksons @effyoomoney @HammerToe No. Jed mcaleb telling the ripple team about the blockchain buzzword was.
957754906101932032 2018-01-28 23:18:58 UTC <junseth> @robertjacksons @HammerToe @effyoomoney Xrp doesn't settle dumb dumb.
957754752506343424 2018-01-28 23:18:21 UTC <junseth> @robertjacksons @effyoomoney @HammerToe No. I don't know anything. Which is why this argument is so embarrassing for you.
957754608016920576 2018-01-28 23:17:47 UTC <junseth> @robertjacksons @effyoomoney @HammerToe So they never froze jed mcaleb's funds unilaterally?
957754326549745664 2018-01-28 23:16:40 UTC <junseth> @thelateempire This is my favorite ico. Hahaha.
957753951859937280 2018-01-28 23:15:10 UTC <junseth> @robertjacksons @HammerToe @effyoomoney No. Ach same day settlement just points out the fact that t0 doesn't exist because of regulation not a lack of innovation.
957753730857828352 2018-01-28 23:14:18 UTC <junseth> @robertjacksons @effyoomoney @HammerToe Yeah, because it doesn't need consensus.
957753554202132480 2018-01-28 23:13:36 UTC <junseth> @robertjacksons @effyoomoney @HammerToe 2/ xrp isn't even relevant to the system in the end. The notion of relying on big liquidity providers as a bank is so funny. You're going to liquidate 100s of billions in xrp? Who'll buy them? You believe in perpetual motion finance. What u're asking can and is done with dollars.
957753259829100544 2018-01-28 23:12:25 UTC <junseth> @robertjacksons @effyoomoney @HammerToe 1/ Couldn't happen to bitcoin because it's a blockchain. Ripple can reverse txs or lose data and who cares?
957752284250890240 2018-01-28 23:08:33 UTC <junseth> @Citibank @robertjacksons @effyoomoney @HammerToe Now you're just talking about netting. Ripple regressed to traditional netting.
957751963881525249 2018-01-28 23:07:17 UTC <junseth> @robertjacksons @effyoomoney @HammerToe Lol. Blockchain don't settle except probabilistically. Do you know ripple is great because they lost the first few years of data or was it the grinding on their nonce that allowed people to reorder transactions and front run?
957749746936041475 2018-01-28 22:58:28 UTC <junseth> @Citibank @robertjacksons @effyoomoney @HammerToe No, in finance, it means that the money has gone from one place to another. It doesn't mean that the money has been converted into another asset, sent, and then unconvirted.
957749580594077696 2018-01-28 22:57:48 UTC <junseth> @robertjacksons @HammerToe @effyoomoney It's not 8 seconds. You haven't thought through this. So a bank takes on the risk of holding XRP? I mean, if what you believe XRP does is give the bank a chance to sell it, then the bank could do that with anything. Bitcoin and Lightning network, for example.
957747988738256898 2018-01-28 22:51:29 UTC <junseth> @Citibank @robertjacksons @HammerToe @effyoomoney No, I"m trying to figure out what you think the improvement is. It XRP doens't settle, and having XRP which you are now dependent on whales to provide liquidity for in order to get the currency you are wanting isn't settlement.
957747757003034629 2018-01-28 22:50:34 UTC <junseth> @robertjacksons @effyoomoney @HammerToe You realize that using an external liquidity provider means that they have to go through another round of settlement right?
957747634328035329 2018-01-28 22:50:04 UTC <junseth> @Citibank @robertjacksons @effyoomoney So do you believe the XRP settles or that the bank has dollar dollar bills at the end of this tx?
957747097889071106 2018-01-28 22:47:56 UTC <junseth> @Citibank @robertjacksons @effyoomoney @HammerToe Ok, so we agree it's not a blockchain?
957744783077801984 2018-01-28 22:38:44 UTC <junseth> @Citibank @robertjacksons @effyoomoney Lol, so walk me through this? XRP is sent. It goes to a banks wallet. Then how does the bank get their cash? Or do they want to hold XRP?
957743997967101955 2018-01-28 22:35:37 UTC <junseth> @Citibank @robertjacksons @effyoomoney Do you also realize that blockchains do not ever settle? They probabilistically settle. They are settled to a degree, that degree is an asymptote to 100% settlement.
957743845982310400 2018-01-28 22:35:01 UTC <junseth> @Citibank @robertjacksons @effyoomoney So you believe that banks want to hold XRP?
957743499482402817 2018-01-28 22:33:38 UTC <junseth> @Citibank @robertjacksons @effyoomoney What do you believe settlement to mean?
957742440936628229 2018-01-28 22:29:26 UTC <junseth> @Citibank @robertjacksons @effyoomoney Not sure how to elaborate. Ripple doesn't settle. So it doesn't offer 4-second settlement. That's marketing, and it's not the case.
957742262993195008 2018-01-28 22:28:44 UTC <junseth> @Citibank @robertjacksons It is that easy. The problem is regulation. Regulation is a throttle, and it mandates that banks take into account the risk of settling T0. Don't be an idiot.
957742076497743873 2018-01-28 22:27:59 UTC <junseth> @Citibank @robertjacksons @effyoomoney Ripple doesn't settle. Please do your research before claiming it does.
957741970545430530 2018-01-28 22:27:34 UTC <junseth> @Citibank @robertjacksons @effyoomoney XRP doesn't settle. So let's stop saying that.

Ok, so a bank has someone send them XRP... then that XRP goes to an exchange... and that exchange clears the trade... and the money goes to... the exchanges bank... and then the bank that the money was sent to... never settles?
955950683735429121 2018-01-23 23:49:38 UTC <junseth> @JuventudPRDSM @Mr_HvD @satoshixrp Bitcoin can never scale. It's been going down ever since it was 18 cents. We all know that.
955950163859791872 2018-01-23 23:47:34 UTC <junseth> @JuventudPRDSM @satoshixrp @Mr_HvD Hahaha. It can scale just fine. It reduces blockchain load by reducing main-chain use. It only needs to scale to its current use, which is 0. And as it gets used, it will scale further. That is the nature of Bitcoin Tech.
955949124238667777 2018-01-23 23:43:26 UTC <junseth> @JuventudPRDSM @satoshixrp @Mr_HvD Lol. Right, the LN sidechain right? Bridge to fiat settlement is a made-up marketing word. It's nonsense bibble babble.
955948931351044096 2018-01-23 23:42:40 UTC <junseth> @JoelKatz @JuventudPRDSM @Mr_HvD @satoshixrp @traxxonwaxx99 Nope, but I'd happily have it at any time.
955947726943944704 2018-01-23 23:37:53 UTC <junseth> @JuventudPRDSM @Mr_HvD @satoshixrp Everyone agrees.
955947554805637120 2018-01-23 23:37:12 UTC <junseth> @JuventudPRDSM @satoshixrp @Mr_HvD Lol, and then who settles with the marketmaker?
955947139770789888 2018-01-23 23:35:33 UTC <junseth> @JuventudPRDSM @Mr_HvD @satoshixrp Yes, bank 1 bought something form bank 2. That's how banks work. They buy things from each other. They're stores filled with goods. Netting is not part of their general operation. They are just like Walmart. Why would bank 2 ever get money from bank 1 without buying something.
955946377665802242 2018-01-23 23:32:31 UTC <junseth> @JuventudPRDSM @Mr_HvD @satoshixrp Haha, no you don't. Hilairously, LN is way more efficient considering it doesn't need to move over dust (if XRP were actually needed). It just opens and closes bonds. It literally does what Ripple claims to do and doesn't. XRP doesn't actually settle. It's cute.
955946121133805568 2018-01-23 23:31:30 UTC <junseth> @JuventudPRDSM @satoshixrp @Mr_HvD Lol, so ok, let's take this. XRP moves the XUSD from bank 1 to bank 2. Now bank 2 has the fiat? Because I think you don't understand how settlement works.
955945872826818561 2018-01-23 23:30:31 UTC <junseth> @haydentiff @JuventudPRDSM @Mr_HvD @crypTruth "You do not know better than an industry spending tens of millions on implementation!" Lol, wanna bet?
955943416835256321 2018-01-23 23:20:45 UTC <junseth> @JuventudPRDSM @satoshixrp @Mr_HvD Again, that was your claim. You said it settles just like Bitcoin. Either that, or you're claiming that banks want to hold on to XRP. Bitcoin doesn't settle to cash without a pimp. XRP doesn't settle to cash without a pimp either.
955943153143635968 2018-01-23 23:19:42 UTC <junseth> @JuventudPRDSM @Mr_HvD @satoshixrp It can't be compliant and offer real time settlement. Those are not compatible. Compliance has a cost. Time is the currency. You don't know that because you haven't actually considered the question. Bridge currency is a marketing word you learned and it doesn't mean anything.
955941871242633216 2018-01-23 23:14:37 UTC <junseth> @JuventudPRDSM @Mr_HvD Want to bet that @haydentiff doesn't know how XRP settles? Tiffany, why don't you come on my show and explain it?
955941326616395776 2018-01-23 23:12:27 UTC <junseth> @haydentiff @JuventudPRDSM @Mr_HvD I mean, can you explain how XRP settles? Because if your belief is that it settles by being XRP, then you probably haven't given this much thought. No bank wants to hold XRP.
955940986382843906 2018-01-23 23:11:06 UTC <junseth> @JuventudPRDSM @Mr_HvD @satoshixrp That is nonsense. You can't have funds settle instantly with a bridge currency. That's a nonsense statement. You've added a process to settlement that makes it less efficient and highly risky.
955937286415437825 2018-01-23 22:56:24 UTC <junseth> @JuventudPRDSM @Mr_HvD Oh, ok. So you believe that Wells Fargo bank will take an XRP transaction from Santander. Then a pimp will show up and hand them cash like in Local bitcoins in exchange for the XRP the bank is holding? Because that's how Bitcoin settles to cash.
955936227135492096 2018-01-23 22:52:11 UTC <junseth> @JuventudPRDSM @Mr_HvD @satoshixrp That doesn't mean anything. XRP isn't settlement. XRP still requires that you settle down to cash. It doesn't do what you say it does.
955930932866842624 2018-01-23 22:31:09 UTC <junseth> @JuventudPRDSM @Mr_HvD Lol. That's you're claim. You don't understand settlement. Ripple doesn't settle. It simply transfers XRP... which leaves an institution in a weird position. Do you believe that transferring a token on Ripple = having cash? Or do you not understand the question?
955922102602878976 2018-01-23 21:56:04 UTC <junseth> @Ripple @JoelKatz @JuventudPRDSM @Mr_HvD @limeytrader007 I'm unemployed.

955920451137687552 2018-01-23 21:49:30 UTC <junseth> @JoelKatz @JuventudPRDSM @Mr_HvD Lol, Ripple is centralized, both in its holdings and in its ability to censor transactions. There is no efficiency there. It doesn't do anything that ACH/Swift doesn't do.
955918626988675072 2018-01-23 21:42:15 UTC <junseth> @Mr_HvD Lol, why don't you explain to me how Ripple settles. There is nothing that it does for banks.
955918342044508161 2018-01-23 21:41:07 UTC <junseth> @JuventudPRDSM @Mr_HvD You realize XRP does high volume because it's just a centralized database, don't you? ACH has 0 second transactions as does Swift.
955917665410998277 2018-01-23 21:38:26 UTC <junseth> @Mr_HvD Haha, how come no one can answer me regarding how Ripple settles. How does it settle?
955916908720787456 2018-01-23 21:35:25 UTC <junseth> @Nicozahniser @alcalajc Lol, so why don't you explain how Ripple handles settlement?
955903764044673024 2018-01-23 20:43:11 UTC <junseth> @Nicozahniser @deep_curiosity @alcalajc How do they use XRP?
955903479163179008 2018-01-23 20:42:03 UTC <junseth> @Nicozahniser @alcalajc What is the rebuttal. What @nicozahniser said is so stupid on its face, that there is nothing to rebut. What is your question? If you can tell me what XRP or Ripple itself does, I'll give you sex.
955896638685564934 2018-01-23 20:14:53 UTC <junseth> @Nicozahniser @alcalajc What question would you like me to Dunning-Kruger my way through?
955843736453484550 2018-01-23 16:44:40 UTC <junseth> @deep_curiosity @samisin @Nicozahniser @tomzie247 Because it has the most robust consensus mechanism ever developed: Proof of Ver. It is highly efficient, and it wants you to know that it was well funded long before Bitcoin was a thing.
955843488901451776 2018-01-23 16:43:41 UTC <junseth> @deep_curiosity @Nicozahniser @samisin @tomzie247 Good point Sam. Governments can just ban Bitcoin. That's why I believe in IOTA. It's consensus mechanism is based on the pyramids of Giza. And governments can't ban those. Only aliens can ban those.

955842687399288833 2018-01-23 16:40:30 UTC <junseth> @Jackhun56552032 Bitcoin is a Model-T. @Ripple is the new Bitcoin.
955842537746518018 2018-01-23 16:39:54 UTC <junseth> @bClashic I'm an idiot.
955842481068871680 2018-01-23 16:39:40 UTC <junseth> @Mr_HvD @JuventudPRDSM Because using banks is cheaper.
955842394456559616 2018-01-23 16:39:20 UTC <junseth> @myspacerocketx I'm the CEO of Bitcoin. Will gladly answer any questions you have.
955842164361252871 2018-01-23 16:38:25 UTC <junseth> @jgulden Never change.
955789269687291904 2018-01-23 13:08:14 UTC <junseth> Because blockchains don't go bankrupt hope can spring eternal. Bitconnect was just selling bitconnect tokens. I'm not even sure it was a ponzi anymore than the cracker barrel gift shop is a ponzi.
955781137514795008 2018-01-23 12:35:55 UTC <junseth> @Haleydt_K Oh, if. So when you have xrp, you have the cash in your hand? But when you have LN, you have... What? Only bonds?
955777196391632897 2018-01-23 12:20:15 UTC <junseth> @jgulden Don't tell me, you've been doing this for a good 4 years already. Lol. I hear the story everyday.
955775439028486144 2018-01-23 12:13:16 UTC <junseth> @jgulden Oh god, Josiah,  you are a literal baby here. Don't talk until you've spent some time learning the tech.

955774714852634624 2018-01-23 12:10:24 UTC <junseth> @BitcoinKhaleesi @greasemonkey67 @socialtechno My industry has a bad reputation because my CEO is a Russian drug dealer.
955774375625707521 2018-01-23 12:09:03 UTC <junseth> @EKrediet That's because you are a dumb dumb.
955774203780849666 2018-01-23 12:08:22 UTC <junseth> @Haleydt_K Ahh. Fro settles in seconds. I see. And can you define "settlement?"
955773885219266560 2018-01-23 12:07:06 UTC <junseth> @giacomozucco @Frazem11 @Market_space_ Bet not.
955773771503284225 2018-01-23 12:06:39 UTC <junseth> @Nicozahniser @deep_curiosity @tomzie247 Yeah, a solution. I have this one nagging question though... What does it actually do?
955772974208086016 2018-01-23 12:03:29 UTC <junseth> @Mr_HvD Lol. So you are a believer in ripple?
955669209169711105 2018-01-22 05:11:09 UTC <junseth> @warrenbuffet @WarrenBuffett @dhruvbansal No risk in that. You want maximal exposure to one asset. That's how you get the biggest returns. This is the lesson of Bitcoin and Buffett's value investment strategy.
955668190259970049 2018-01-22 05:07:06 UTC <junseth> @dhruvbansal Coinbase will sell them to you. LocalBitcoins is where @WarrenBuffett gets his shares though.
955663983477915648 2018-01-22 04:50:23 UTC <junseth> @tradewithdave @LuckDragon69 I scammed everyone.
955624345220632577 2018-01-22 02:12:53 UTC <junseth> @Nicozahniser I'm new.
955605597294129152 2018-01-22 00:58:23 UTC <junseth> So I think I want to be the richest person on earth for a short time. I'm going to start a blockchain w/ 100 billion pre-mined coins. Get it listed on coinmarketcap. Sell .00000001 to myself for 1 bitcoin. I will be worth more than $100 sextilion. Eat that @ForbesTech.

955575713758961669 2018-01-22 22:59:38 UTC <junseth> @brucefenton I made good use of the ticket you gave me to the T0 party. Look: http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/btcmiami-miami-bitcoin-conference-parties-feature-flo-rida-10009750 Worst party of the year.

955537512939900928 2018-01-22 20:27:50 UTC <junseth> @Nicozahniser I bet you're new here.
955537399370731520 2018-01-22 20:27:23 UTC <junseth> @BitcoinKhaleesi @socialtechno It's called Bitcoin dumb dumb.
955537265907945472 2018-01-22 20:26:51 UTC <junseth> @r0bertclarkson @adam3us is my CEO.
955537148320649217 2018-01-22 20:26:23 UTC <junseth> @socialtechno You don't know anything. Bitcoin is one of the top companies in the world right now. Who do you think paid for the party at 11?https://twitter.com/AdamMehl/status/954402608734711816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.miaminewtimes.com%2Fnews%2Fbtcmiami-miami-bitcoin-conference-parties-feature-flo-rida-10009750
955440292160827393 2018-01-22 14:01:31 UTC <junseth> The humor of lightning network is that it ACTUALLY does the thing $Ripple claims to do without any pretense or lies about using the token for settlement. So... I guess we should see a 300% pump in like two weeks as the Bitcoin company starts signing contracts with banks.
955085329106702336 2018-01-21 14:31:01 UTC <junseth> @thecherness If you have to assess power dynamics in relationships before you engage in them, then high power people can never end up with or date low power people - because that's rape. This completely destroys the ethos of Disney's Princess movies and entrenches classism. G'luck w/ that.
954477248924528642 2018-01-19 22:14:44 UTC <junseth> @jessicalipscomb Hope you're enjoying the conference.

953866395887984640 2018-01-17 05:47:25 UTC <junseth> Anyone have a volume chart on tether the last few days? I suspect that lots of the money camped there during the downturn.

951870469996793857 2018-01-12 17:36:19 UTC <junseth> @jimcramer @CodeAMonkey That doesn't make any sense. You are talking in buzzwords.
951686016485724161 2018-01-11 05:23:22 UTC <junseth> @jimcramer @CodeAMonkey Lol. Bud, you are an idjut. You are completely unaware of the tech you're writing. It's amazing. There is no way you've written applications of any size or scale if you think you're doing something new here.
951622524298809344 2018-01-11 01:11:04 UTC <junseth> @jimcramer @CodeAMonkey Lol, no you're not. That would be retarded.
951613326148165632 2018-01-11 00:34:31 UTC <junseth> @jimcramer @CodeAMonkey Lol. You realize you have no idea how a blockchain works right?
951590506236141570 2018-01-11 23:03:51 UTC <junseth> @jimcramer @CodeAMonkey How do I know that the time stamp is accurate?
951561871148142593 2018-01-11 21:10:03 UTC <junseth> @jimcramer @CodeAMonkey Lol, but there is no mechanism for deciding which entries are valid or for deciding who gets to update this blockchain?
951557819781795842 2018-01-11 20:53:57 UTC <junseth> @jimcramer @CodeAMonkey Lol, so everyone just gets all the updates from everyone? How do you know which entries are legitimate to add?
951553560105365505 2018-01-11 20:37:02 UTC <junseth> @jimcramer @CodeAMonkey I see. So it's just about having a bunch of excel spreadsheets? And they just agree with each other on things because they do? Who gets to submit the next entry to this blockchain?
951552978862911488 2018-01-11 20:34:43 UTC <junseth> @digitalassetcom @Bitstamp @bloqinc @monax @factom @BitPay @coinbase @earndotcom @Kodak @BtcDanny Yes. I think that if you're ok with KYC, you're going to use the most legitimate exchange possible.
951490497713004545 2018-01-11 16:26:27 UTC <junseth> @jimcramer @CodeAMonkey How do you maintain consistency across records? There's a famous problem called the Byzantine General's Problem regarding data across a network. It's a hard problem. How would you solve that in this Blockchain technology that underlies bitcoin?
951490086700507136 2018-01-11 16:24:49 UTC <junseth> @digitalassetcom @Bitstamp @bloqinc @monax @factom @BitPay @coinbase @earndotcom @Kodak @BtcDanny Yup. But they have their own equivalents.
951487913853845504 2018-01-11 16:16:11 UTC <junseth> @digitalassetcom @Bitstamp @bloqinc @monax @factom @BitPay @coinbase @earndotcom @Kodak @BtcDanny Again, most of these exchanges aren't licensed correctly, they are going to have their market eaten up by credible liquidity providers. They live for now, but all that has to happen is Chase or Goldman or NYSE, trusted opens a licensed exchange and goodbye volume.
951487578829721602 2018-01-11 16:14:51 UTC <junseth> @bancosantander @AmericanExpress @Nicozahniser No they aren't. Ripple doesn't do that.
951487464505528320 2018-01-11 16:14:23 UTC <junseth> @derose @ExceIlion It's an interesting discussion regarding consensus of the projects. Counterparty has no mechanism for consensus outside of individuals managing the project. No POW. I think Counterparty should have developed support for BCASH at the time of the fork. But I'm not a dev.
951486814078062592 2018-01-11 16:11:48 UTC <junseth> @VicSeborowski Nope. You want some?
951486715096633346 2018-01-11 16:11:25 UTC <junseth> @digitalassetcom @Bitstamp @bloqinc @monax @factom @BitPay @coinbase @earndotcom @Kodak @BtcDanny Yup. I bet. They have a lot of investor backing. They will probably go public.
951339808714092544 2018-01-10 06:27:40 UTC <junseth> I think r/ethereum is the new r/buttcoin but without the parody.
951339525338484736 2018-01-10 06:26:32 UTC <junseth> @jimcramer @CodeAMonkey Interesting sounds like there is a big incentive to chamge these records to benefit me.
951339389220737024 2018-01-10 06:26:00 UTC <junseth> @jimcramer @CodeAMonkey Ic. And how does decentralization prevent hacking? How do these nodes ensure consistent data?
951250626033352704 2018-01-10 00:33:17 UTC <junseth> @realDonaldTrump @frcbls https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc5tIKFDy1s
951249650262200320 2018-01-10 00:29:24 UTC <junseth> @jimcramer @CodeAMonkey Haha. Why don't you explain to us why it's important. You seem to have a great frasp on it.
951228557681987587 2018-01-10 23:05:35 UTC <junseth> @jimcramer @CodeAMonkey Lol, you're an idiot. You're talking about a database. Nothing new there.
951199457642778624 2018-01-10 21:09:57 UTC <junseth> @jimcramer @CodeAMonkey Lol, what is a blockchain dumb dumb?
951160653301145600 2018-01-10 18:35:46 UTC <junseth> @digitalassetcom @Bitstamp @bloqinc @monax @factom @BitPay @coinbase @earndotcom @Kodak @cyounessi1 I think if these companies go public, banks will immediately eat their business. So no, I don't think that unlicensed, haphazard exchanges have a future here.
951160244570378240 2018-01-10 18:34:08 UTC <junseth> This is genius. I can't believe that @realDonaldTrump pulled this off. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc5tIKFDy1
951111228465827841 2018-01-10 15:19:22 UTC <junseth> Now that companies like @Kodak are doing "blockchain" I think it's safe to assume that the next stage will be blockchain companies with little to no future prospects or profit will go public. @earndotcom @coinbase @BitPay @factom @monax @bloqinc @Bitstamp @digitalassetcom
950854183422517254 2018-01-09 22:17:58 UTC <junseth> @droplister He probably wouldn't because he'd use Slock it and require a payment of eth to unlock his door. His ETH is also in a parity wallet.
950717683372363782 2018-01-09 13:15:33 UTC <junseth> What if this dude stored his house in a parity wallet.https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7p155y/i_just_warranty_deeded_my_house_into_an_ethereum/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=ethereum

950129695919607808 2018-01-07 22:19:06 UTC <junseth> @LastBitcoiner Biases are different than propoganda friend.
949879215553474560 2018-01-06 05:43:47 UTC <junseth> @LastBitcoiner RT is Russian propoganda. So there's that.
949752025205657600 2018-01-06 21:18:23 UTC <junseth> http://Etherscan.io/txspending look at the scale $ethereum has achieved. Only 30k txs.
949665015178715136 2018-01-06 15:32:38 UTC <junseth> @bancosantander @AmericanExpress @RyanBerkeley Like settlement.

Social unrest is a common source of default. The question will be whether they choose to bear that cost then. What is certain is that the world our debt build is our gift to them.

Libertarians explain it in a 1-sentence trope, and pretend like they won. But you are too stupid to know that printing money != quantitative easing.

Libertarians don't want it audites. They want to be part of the fed conspiracy. Libertarians are generally upset that they aren't in charge of the conspiracy.
949495167358242816 2018-01-05 04:17:43 UTC <junseth> @misterdna @C1aranMurray @pdubl22 @georgevaccaro @derose @StopAndDecrypt If goldbugs are holding gold so that they can avoid inflation, why is the rhetoric about buying gold directed at the motion of its increasing value and ability to make you rich? You believe the rhetoric.
949407043068334081 2018-01-05 22:27:32 UTC <junseth> @misterdna @C1aranMurray @pdubl22 @derose @rjenkins_atl The question isn't whether they can or should ban something. It's whether the thing is more efficient than incumbent systems. Tor is a relatively small network. That is the destiny of all this stuff if it can't find a place where it achieves efficiencies without tragedy.
949397639367360512 2018-01-05 21:50:10 UTC <junseth> @misterdna @C1aranMurray @derose @pdubl22 The creation of bitcoin itself is a travic operation. Mining is the use of resources for something other than the next best use of that energy. It relies on subsidy.
949362325106122753 2018-01-05 19:29:51 UTC <junseth> @misterdna @C1aranMurray @derose @Hodl8333 Jumping out is literally called "de-risking." You jump out to de-risk. Not de-risking is how you end up not getting compensated for risk that randomly panned out. De-risking could further be extended to "getting rid of risk that you were overcompensated for holding."
949330812620722176 2018-01-05 17:24:38 UTC <junseth> @derose @misterdna :) You and everyone else. We also said there is no reason it can't pump to high heaven. It's crypto.
949148322526195715 2018-01-04 05:19:29 UTC <junseth> @marketingp2015 The satoshi whitepaper is not bitcoin. Satoshi was also vuilding s market on bitcoin. He abandoned that. He was a fallible creator of software. His opinions then have nothing to do with realities today. Also, bitcoin does the things you say it doesn't.

949068264956719104 2018-01-04 00:01:21 UTC <junseth> @marketingp2015 But that's not a limitation of Bitcoin. So Bitcoin can do that. And Bitcoin doesn't claim to do that. Others say that Bitcoin does that. Are you a BCash conspiracist?

949062588561797120 2018-01-04 23:38:48 UTC <junseth> $ripple has to come down. All these coins hv to come down. $ripple really HAS to come down. This is the epitome of idiots speculating.

It establishes a base expense for governments to consider when legislating mobility (ie venezuela), knowability(getting rid of cash), property rights ($ in banks), and morality (drugs).

947301963741396992 2017-12-30 03:02:42 UTC <junseth> My big problem with the $ripple pump is that it is entirely directed by institutions claiming they are using it to do things it doesn't do. I think @AmericanExpress & @bancosantander need to answer some questions.https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/11/16/american-express-santander-team-up-with-ripple-on-blockchain-platform.html
947291620680126464 2017-12-30 02:21:36 UTC <junseth> @PaulRozehnal 4) harder to argue with my point given that @SatoshiLite just sold his share which is my point. This was a pump.
947257085334622209 2017-12-30 00:04:22 UTC <junseth> @PaulRozehnal 3) so it doesn't matter what the algo is. When the algo is different, it might compete for hardware, but not the source of power that the hardware is proving that was used for the securing of the network.
947256533154398208 2017-12-30 00:02:11 UTC <junseth> @PaulRozehnal 2) cryptoheads think that burning energy to secure a b/c is an independent event. But it is done at the cost of not using that energy to do things like power your toaster oven, or watch tv, or a/c your house. @izakaminska
947254882704265216 2017-12-30 23:55:37 UTC <junseth> @PaulRozehnal 1) Mining is the process of burning energy. The algo used exists to prove you burned it. The resource being burned is the same and that is the zero sum. Burning energy for litecoin comes at the expense of burning energy for bitcoin.
947225202735370242 2017-12-30 21:57:41 UTC <junseth> @Truthcoin @p0nd3ea The better point is that almost none of yhe investors piling in here know this fact or why it matters.

945759497682866176 2017-12-26 20:53:30 UTC <junseth> @_jonasschnelli_ @SooMartindale @mungojelly I'm skeptical that they continue using BCash when off-chain scaling options become more and more used.

But in Venezuela people use bitcoin all the time. You can hear my interview with a miner here: https://soundcloud.com/junsethsworld/interview-with-eduardo-gomez-in-venezuela. Fees are a problem, but that is something that get solved by managing the externalities.
945724114303619078 2017-12-26 18:32:54 UTC <junseth> @_jonasschnelli_ @SooMartindale @mungojelly Luckily, almost no one uses Bitcoin.

945265638779604993 2017-12-25 12:11:05 UTC <junseth> @_jonasschnelli_ @SooMartindale You mean, when there is more than 1mb of usage, there will be more than 1mb of usage? Segwit is a blocksize increase. And we still have more use than is available.pic.twitter.com/3PwWr16i88

944655656186990594 2017-12-23 19:47:13 UTC <junseth> @petertoddbtc @timoncc Well, it would make sense that @coinbase advocated for higher blocksize temporarily in order to try to fix this issue. It would have been nice if they had been transparent about it. But I get why they wouldn't be considering... it's crypto... and everyone here scams.
944653318181347328 2017-12-23 19:37:56 UTC <junseth> @GDAX @coinbase @LaurentMT @WhalePanda How is @SatoshiLite not largely to blame here. Wasn't he their CTO?
944651531407757312 2017-12-23 19:30:50 UTC <junseth> @petertoddbtc This makes perfect sense. So they are interested in hitting the reset button on Bitcoin so they can re-consolidate their UTXO set cheaply. This is going to be bad.

944543015523307520 2017-12-23 12:19:38 UTC <junseth> @BitcoinMagazine @dylanjungels it does. But you're new, so you don't know that it does.
944542753362534400 2017-12-23 12:18:35 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels lol.
944542568364331008 2017-12-23 12:17:51 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels I do know the answer. Banks want cash. They don't want risk exposure outside of that profile. XRP is ridiculous.
944438551676178432 2017-12-22 05:24:32 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels How does a bank get rid of XRP so they can have the cash in their vaults?
944438472026329088 2017-12-22 05:24:13 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels Ripple is no different. Ripple, however, claims to be something they aren't. So they come with an air of dishonesty as well.
944438337280110593 2017-12-22 05:23:41 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels You believe in conspiracies. Swift doesn't have human manipulation. That's nuts.
944435536370061312 2017-12-22 05:12:33 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels "Honduras have asked Factom, an American startup, to provide a prototype of a blockchain-based land registry." https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21677228-technology-behind-bitcoin-lets-people-who-do-not-know-or-trust-each-other-build-dependable Everyone said that it was the economist, no chance they're right. I called bullshit. Guess who was right.
944434997104082944 2017-12-22 05:10:24 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels Why do you need a "network of partners?" ACH and Swift already do this with trusted third parties.
944434874064269312 2017-12-22 05:09:55 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels These institutions still need to net. Ripple doesn't do anything.
944434764257390592 2017-12-22 05:09:29 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels Lol. Ripple dodesn't have "low fees." They just aren't used.
944434647404044288 2017-12-22 05:09:01 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels How does the USD get locked into the network. Do they deposit cash into a series of tubes?
944434525689524224 2017-12-22 05:08:32 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels No, Ripple had already done that. It failed. They then said they were a blockchain which revitalized the project because it hit its stride. Ripple is an emperor with no clothes. All those questions you have that you think "smarter people have answers"... they don't.
944434230779576320 2017-12-22 05:07:22 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels Who is "they?"
944434112777146368 2017-12-22 05:06:53 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels Lol.
944433957747216386 2017-12-22 05:06:16 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels 100B doesn't do anything. They had to put it in escrow because of the shady history behind why it exists. That's foundation + Jed McCaleb money.
944428216072196096 2017-12-22 04:43:27 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels What is your definition of middlemen? Because I think you need to rethink some things.
944428021871730689 2017-12-22 04:42:41 UTC <junseth> @petertoddbtc Peter, that highlighted bit is the least weird part about that quote.
944427467334352896 2017-12-22 04:40:29 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels So you think that banks are going to hold XRP instead of the currency of their land?
944427341018779648 2017-12-22 04:39:59 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels Lol, I've been hearing this for years. There aren't errors, and XRP still requires settlement. It doesn't mitigate anything. Ripple's only efficiency is skirting the law for corporations that can't. That's idiotichttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ripple-labs-fined-700000-fincen-will-institute-transaction-monitoring-across-ripple-protocol-1430883659/
944426991431962624 2017-12-22 04:38:36 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels The tech behind Ripple makes no sense. You realize Swift/ACH are consortiums right? They don't exactly make profit. So ur talking about tech that has a fake currency attached, fake b.c. But its competition is profitless low-cost, law-complying ssolution. Think about the claim.
944425971775672320 2017-12-22 04:34:32 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels You haven't given this any thought. What does the XRP do? I'll walk through this with you if you are willing to actually think hard about the question.
944425817030971392 2017-12-22 04:33:56 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels Lol. Ok, so the XRP does what? It goes where? And the stability is guaranteed how? I guess that makes sense. Ripple is a paragon of stability.pic.twitter.com/cQM6gVGrlX
944425326087634944 2017-12-22 04:31:58 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels What the fudge does that mean?
944425055034978304 2017-12-22 04:30:54 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels Yes, you will find a billion articles that say things. The economist wrote about Factom putting together a database for Honduras' property titles a few years ago. That was a lie then, and it's a lie now. Doesn't mean they didn't get a nice lift form it.
944423124178698240 2017-12-22 04:23:13 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels It's not true. You realize how hilarious it is to claim that a blockchain has partners right? It's a centralized network. The XRP is to pretend like it's a blockchain. It's shitty ACH & Swift. The reason ACH & Swift take so long is laws. Not computers. XRP doesn't fix that.
944421975388246016 2017-12-22 04:18:40 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels What's your point? It was failed. And the question you still haven't answered is, what is the XRP for?
944421547174957056 2017-12-22 04:16:58 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels I'm no guru. You just don't have any idea what you're talking about. And yes, the articles put out about Ripple overstate their utility. What do they mean by banks are "using" the Ripple network. Because I bet they aren't.
944418947142705155 2017-12-22 04:06:38 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels That question is so stupid, I can't even. Did Amazon tell you that you need a blockchain to do the thing they were already doing? Did Google? Because that's what Ripple did. Let's not be dense.
944418724681043968 2017-12-22 04:05:45 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels It is if the news articles get their news from PR pumpers and people who have no idea what they're talking about. When did you get here? You'll say 2013. I'll say you're lying. You'll say that was when you first heard about Bitcoin, but u purchased ur first coin in 2017. Go!
944381726800928768 2017-12-22 01:38:44 UTC <junseth> @dylanjungels No they arent. It isn't used and its not useful. Thats not hipster. You just believe hype.

I think that's a big concern of some. My problem with $bcash is that it's run by a bunch of rubes who believe scaling = bigger block size. The reason bcash is "scaled" however is because less people use it.

928340679549423616 2017-11-08 19:17:20 UTC <junseth> @CharlieShrem @nvk Too late, we named it #EthereumPlus. I am patenting our rollback tech.
928340519960399872 2017-11-08 19:16:42 UTC <junseth> Prediction: @rogerkver and co will have a newly named coin next week and all of r/btc will say this is the one.
928340276443303936 2017-11-08 19:15:44 UTC <junseth> @CharlieShrem .@nvk will you help me fork Ethereum?

928339800482082816 2017-11-08 19:13:50 UTC <junseth> @CharlieShrem Disgusting. I was promised double-coins.
928338419943604224 2017-11-08 19:08:21 UTC <junseth> @sudoScience_ I look forward to them. Parity is hacked. I have celebrated. And now I get to sit back and wait for the next celebration. Each brings with it new lols.
928338166372806656 2017-11-08 19:07:21 UTC <junseth> @pomomoh You could avoid being part of these hacks by recognizing the audacity of the claims of #Ethereum's founders. Schadenfreude is virtuous.
928305699918090247 2017-11-08 16:58:20 UTC <junseth> @pomomoh That's such a dumb statement. You have no understanding of this thing you love. I criticize the tech. You criticize my feelings.
928280964186460160 2017-11-08 15:20:03 UTC <junseth> @gsgreene That would assume he does things with forethought.
928279143669739520 2017-11-08 15:12:49 UTC <junseth> @gsgreene Not even true. What if the exchange was using parity?
928278994709082112 2017-11-08 15:12:13 UTC <junseth> @pomomoh @coinreserve Yes. Really. This will keep happening and etherites will keep wondering how the could have knowb. And I will continue letting you knoe hoe bad this tech is.
928278684305362944 2017-11-08 15:10:59 UTC <junseth> @matthew_d_green @puellavulnerata @misterdna It's not "anything." This is what we warned about. These exploits are going to become more common because solidity is terrible and a blockchain will be crushed under the weight of dreams and failed business ideas.
928278181278298112 2017-11-08 15:08:59 UTC <junseth> @matthew_d_green What are these technical developments you speak of?

It's ben more than 2 years.

928064893533806592 2017-11-07 01:01:27 UTC <junseth> Who wants to bet #Ethereum Hardforks. @gavofyork has done more proof of @VitalikButerin than anyone in the entire world. Can't wait for the premier episode of this soap opera.
928064384101994497 2017-11-07 00:59:26 UTC <junseth> @MakerDAO @VitalikButerin @ethereum_alex @noDirkd Sounds to me like @gavofyork has a lot less money now. Perhaps we should revisit claims of his competency. :) Care to re-make the bet?

926547286976581632 2017-11-03 20:31:02 UTC <junseth> @krogoff @mikeconway13 Which is why you should be skeptical of patterns you find.
926547228801601542 2017-11-03 20:30:48 UTC <junseth> @krogoff @mikeconway13 Then you'd have a lot of asynchronous information you could profit on.
926543148603539461 2017-11-03 20:14:35 UTC <junseth> @krogoff @mikeconway13 You're a chartalist. You believe in magic star shapes directing your reality.
926542671757406208 2017-11-03 20:12:41 UTC <junseth> @krogoff @mikeconway13 No idea. I don't KNOW where the new demand is coming from. And I don't know a ton about the supply.
926542233792376837 2017-11-03 20:10:57 UTC <junseth> @krogoff @mikeconway13 It's a familiar run-up.
926542052883656705 2017-11-03 20:10:14 UTC <junseth> @krogoff @mikeconway13 The fundamental price of anything is difficult to know. That's why I said originally, I called it a run-up, not a bubble.
926540912045494272 2017-11-03 20:05:42 UTC <junseth> @krogoff @mikeconway13 Because calling something a bubble means that you have knowledge of a mis-pricing. When was Bitcoin mis-priced?
926540739189846016 2017-11-03 20:05:01 UTC <junseth> @krogoff @mikeconway13 Yet it never goes to 0. So at what point in the chart was bitcoin mis-priced?
926540181238362112 2017-11-03 20:02:48 UTC <junseth> @krogoff @mikeconway13 What is the fundamental price of Bitcoin? Because that's not easily answered.
926535393624936449 2017-11-03 19:43:46 UTC <junseth> @krogoff @mikeconway13 If by fundamentals you mean chartalising then yes. Fundamentals = reading tea leaves.
926535194722619393 2017-11-03 19:42:59 UTC <junseth> @krogoff @mikeconway13 "surge in asset prices unwarranted by the fundamentals of the asset and driven by exuberant market behavior"
926535006297690113 2017-11-03 19:42:14 UTC <junseth> @krogoff @mikeconway13 Markets act pretty efficiently. Bubble theory is difficult because "bubble" implies knowable irrationality.
926515876559491073 2017-11-03 18:26:13 UTC <junseth> @krogoff @mikeconway13 That's not true. Bubble implies mis-pricing.
926507353121443841 2017-11-03 17:52:21 UTC <junseth> @krogoff @mikeconway13 The word bubble implies that you know that something is overpriced or mis-priced. You don't and can't know those things.
926502711763271680 2017-11-03 17:33:54 UTC <junseth> @krogoff @mikeconway13 The reason I call it a run-up is because bubble is hard to stomach. I don't know what those are.
926212412579164160 2017-11-02 22:20:22 UTC <junseth> @cheapest_pants @Fergulati Ahh the big head cheat
926177647176175617 2017-11-02 20:02:13 UTC <junseth> @cheapest_pants @Fergulati Is toxicity on the roadmap?
926160344627761152 2017-11-02 18:53:28 UTC <junseth> @Fergulati @cheapest_pants Shit, is Ethereum developing a layer one solution? This could be like the formation of a planet. Maybe ETH has a chance.
926158685482647553 2017-11-02 18:46:52 UTC <junseth> @krogoff @mikeconway13 I think in previous run-ups, the sense was we were owed a rise in price. An "I told you so" moment. Doesn't feel that way anymore.
926155015328235520 2017-11-02 18:32:17 UTC <junseth> @mikeconway13 I think that old timers are of the opinion it might go up it might go down. We're ok either way. So to that end, it's different. @krogoff
926125291281567744 2017-11-02 16:34:10 UTC <junseth> @Th3Acist :) I agree with this. The CME bringing bitcoin futures in will change everything. Thanks to everyone who worked on that.
926123038676082690 2017-11-02 16:25:13 UTC <junseth> This run-up feels different than previous. I think a lot of us have resolved to hodl matter what.
925071832864215040 2017-10-30 18:48:06 UTC <junseth> @Corey_Feldman @brockpierce I agree. This is the perfect place for Bitcoiners to help. And I think we'd all like to see your story told.
924994908036976642 2017-10-30 13:42:26 UTC <junseth> Amazing @Corey_Feldman has been laughed at for years. Corey, why not try to fundraise using Bitcoin? Maybe @brockpierce will throw in. :)

924978793378349056 2017-10-30 12:38:24 UTC <junseth> @izakaminska @droplister You could ICO your laughs as other people's liability. If they make you laugh, they owe you a token.
924977515571109888 2017-10-30 12:33:19 UTC <junseth> #Bitcoiners, do you realize how much Russian propaganda you consume? RT is not a news network. It is a conspiracy stoking network.
924976426012561408 2017-10-30 12:28:59 UTC <junseth> @izakaminska At this point, I think it's safe to say that the cancer of intersectionalism has ruined a generation's ability to have joy and laugh.

902235043195748354 2017-08-28 18:22:51 UTC <junseth> @Codiox 1/ This is so dumb. If that's true, aren't they just going to crack down on people buying 10s of GPUs (which are more easily id'd)?

893286962337116160 2017-08-03 01:46:22 UTC <junseth> Dear coinbase, this is the worst precedent you could have set.
892980874396000256 2017-08-02 05:30:05 UTC <junseth> You can know that Bitcoin Cash isn't Bitcoin because there are no Pepes there.
892936818659905537 2017-08-02 02:35:02 UTC <junseth> @droplister @AeonCoin That is the service. They make money renting out private keys.
892901136323284993 2017-08-02 00:13:14 UTC <junseth> @droplister @AeonCoin No replay attack here. But yes that is true. Simple though. They own private keys and r custodians of ur coins. Value on keys is theirs.
892900240461881345 2017-08-02 00:09:41 UTC <junseth> @droplister @AeonCoin It isn't similar at all. Etc is original chain. And your clams distinction is unimportant.
892895675855368194 2017-08-02 23:51:32 UTC <junseth> Position coinbase should take is #bitcoinclams is an altcoin. They own private keys and r custodians of bitcoin. The coins are cb's.

892740923624443906 2017-08-02 13:36:37 UTC <junseth> @provoost Spam the chain and make every block as big as possible with large, complex, multi-output txs. Sit back, watch fireworks.
892740679331442688 2017-08-02 13:35:38 UTC <junseth> @provoost Why not just selfish mine in the background, cause a chain re-org and win the last 2016 blocks all at once. :)
892739681749696514 2017-08-02 13:31:41 UTC <junseth> @gsgreene 2/ At this stage, a selfish miner w hefty hashrate could be 50 blocks ahead.
892739549578833921 2017-08-02 13:31:09 UTC <junseth> @gsgreene 1/ All it woukd take is 1 selfish miner to cause a re-org. He could mine empty blocks and no one would know.
892739304266584064 2017-08-02 13:30:11 UTC <junseth> @gsgreene Well even more scary, at this hash rate, no one can know if their coins have actually been spent.
892738443205382144 2017-08-02 13:26:45 UTC <junseth> @provoost I tbink thats what I'm describinf as a likely scenario after difficulty adjustment period.
892737887170703361 2017-08-02 13:24:33 UTC <junseth> 3/ 2016 blocks later new difficulty adjustment would occur. Miner would fall off. New dif would produce blocks every 1.5 to 2.0 hrs.
892737219479392256 2017-08-02 13:21:54 UTC <junseth> 2/ 30% of btc hashpower will have something like 90% of bcc haspower. Blocks would be found every minute after adjustment.
892735636855300098 2017-08-02 13:15:36 UTC <junseth> 1/ fundamentally, the chain isn't safe at this price. It'll be attacked 'til next difficulty adjustment. Then it will be unusably slow.
892733290993643521 2017-08-02 13:06:17 UTC <junseth> @VitalikButerin Except bitcoincash isn't a fork. There arent replay concerns here. Its just a bribechain.
892729415444123648 2017-08-02 12:50:53 UTC <junseth> Is the mining algo the same for bitcoin cash? Because I bet that the instant the difficulty drops it starts acting like testnet.
892656337481584640 2017-08-02 08:00:30 UTC <junseth> @lorcacons Hope so.
892639049164500992 2017-08-01 06:51:48 UTC <junseth> @twobitidiot @BitcoinsSG @Daniel_Plante Shall we ICO it?

892585802294857732 2017-08-01 03:20:13 UTC <junseth> @adam3us @TheBlueMatt 2/ Right now our core devs are making memes, and I am skeptical they will ever get around to finishing their forking work.
892585560900067328 2017-08-01 03:19:15 UTC <junseth> @adam3us 1/ Actually @TheBlueMatt we need this, but for Ethereum. #EthereumPlus needs the ability to easily fork the chain to right before the hack.
892582717816176641 2017-08-01 03:07:57 UTC <junseth> Can @TheBlueMatt add a new feature to his altcoin generator that will output fork Bitcoin from current chain state? @adam3us

892573320096473093 2017-08-01 02:30:37 UTC <junseth> @droplister @BigLambda Absolutely. This notion of "what money is" is 100% ideology driven. It is rooted in the illogic of goldbuggery. http://www.dictionary.com/browse/buggery

892571425248301058 2017-08-01 02:23:05 UTC <junseth> @droplister @BigLambda #BitcoinClams is to r/bvitcoin what an ICO is to Russian hackers. #BitcoinClams is to r/btc what an ICO is to Libertarians.
892571049191145472 2017-08-01 02:21:35 UTC <junseth> @droplister Good point. You can run your Prius on it.

892553641822912519 2017-08-01 01:12:25 UTC <junseth> It is worth noting that there is no use for #BitcoinClams other than moving around on tertiary exchanges.
892551868370624512 2017-08-01 01:05:22 UTC <junseth> @JuicyGrabs The Pamp&Pamp hedge fund doesn't divulge its methods.

887797994673897472 2017-07-19 22:15:11 UTC <junseth> @adam3us @cheapest_pants The whole ETH chain is an exploding box. It's like a nuclear explosion versus a firecracker.

887787463024021509 2017-07-19 21:33:20 UTC <junseth> @JackMallers @VitalikButerin Sorry. I don't speak Russian. I ran this through Google translator. Are you saying you didn't have any ETH in an affected wallet?
887787220861636608 2017-07-19 21:32:22 UTC <junseth> Likeliness of HF equn = (Amount ETH lost by @VitalikButerin + Friends ETH)/group's total ETH holdings. So this might not actually happen.

887782777080483840 2017-07-19 21:14:42 UTC <junseth> That time when everyone wished https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 was a parity mutlisig wallet.

887779324132282371 2017-07-19 21:00:59 UTC <junseth> @miketwenty1 Use ETH, no checksum. It'll come right to us when the LORD proves he has the private key.

887778203833597953 2017-07-19 20:56:32 UTC <junseth> @VitalikButerin @gsgreene Probably true. Blockchains are war. ETH is the swiss cheese fortress of blockchains. Turing completeness is a bitch.

871723998035533825 2017-06-05 13:42:51 UTC <junseth> @moonkin48 @sharkybit @derosetech @7heAbolitionist That's an example of the state stepping back and giving you what you want.

870391696084828161 2017-06-01 21:28:46 UTC <junseth> @provoost @izakaminska @DaveWolk @brucefenton 2/ All the "new" system is doing is proving regulations were needed more than we realized because Libertarians r dumber than we thought.
870391608050692096 2017-06-01 21:28:25 UTC <junseth> @provoost @izakaminska @DaveWolk @brucefenton 1/ That's so dumb. The system exists basically to prevent Libertarians from deleting their money in scams.
870391366723014657 2017-06-01 21:27:27 UTC <junseth> @provoost @DaveWolk @izakaminska @brucefenton Oh, interesting. So these issues have nothing to do with blockchain?
870391084651773952 2017-06-01 21:26:20 UTC <junseth> @provoost @DaveWolk @izakaminska @brucefenton It's not a big issue. It's a small issue because the current system is a blockchain with redemption.
870390864094388224 2017-06-01 21:25:27 UTC <junseth> @provoost @DaveWolk @izakaminska @brucefenton Yes, Bruce, modern banking is antiquated. That is why almost all cash is electronic and I can access it from everywhere all the time.
870390532782084096 2017-06-01 21:24:08 UTC <junseth> @provoost @DaveWolk @izakaminska @brucefenton 3/ Securities are mine regardless of who holds custody because law. And law regs & enforces regs on custodians. That's a huge efficiency.

870365534176632832 2017-06-01 19:44:48 UTC <junseth> @provoost @izakaminska @brucefenton Bruce, I don't disagree. That's why Counterparty was developed. Tokens are trading cards though, not equity.
870365313522692096 2017-06-01 19:43:56 UTC <junseth> @provoost @izakaminska @brucefenton I will say they see an opportunity to grab money in the midst of a frothy bubble.
870363763370840064 2017-06-01 19:37:46 UTC <junseth> @provoost @izakaminska @brucefenton Please continue checking with me before talking. This is so dumb. These are just tokenized t-shirts.
870359329567801346 2017-06-01 19:20:09 UTC <junseth> @provoost @izakaminska @brucefenton If you think that's an efficiency of incredible proportions, why not just open the Fenton 24h exchange and compete with NASDAQ?
870357997557616640 2017-06-01 19:14:51 UTC <junseth> @brucefenton Tokens are dumb Bruce. The efficiency is that non-Americans can extract money from American Anarchist/Libertarian.
870357486485864448 2017-06-01 19:12:49 UTC <junseth> @FJasonSeibert @izakaminska @brucefenton @provoost These ICOs are distinct from Ponzis for the most part. They are crowdfunding securities. This is substantively different than "Blockchain."
870357129638686724 2017-06-01 19:11:24 UTC <junseth> @provoost @izakaminska that's so stupid @brucefenton. ICOs aren't an efficiency. They are just pink sheet stocks with worse security and a different name.

870335389223059456 2017-06-01 17:45:01 UTC <junseth> @rogerkver 5/ Those who give up citizenship shirk their ability to affect change by opting out. The church Catholic calls this the sin of omission.
870335091762806785 2017-06-01 17:43:50 UTC <junseth> @rogerkver 4/ In a democratic society, you can use levers such as protest and voting to modify the behavior of those with enforcement control.
870334950494568449 2017-06-01 17:43:16 UTC <junseth> @rogerkver 3/ Authority requires the ability to use force. Force can be applied judiciously (USA usually) or non-judiciously (Philippines r/n).
870334724971147265 2017-06-01 17:42:23 UTC <junseth> @rogerkver 2/ Regulation is a form of externality management. The enforcement is the cost of violating regs. Enforcement requires authority.
870334470511054848 2017-06-01 17:41:22 UTC <junseth> @rogerkver 1/ That's so stupid Roger. Can we please stop with the over-sized Libertarian rhetoric and make points that are tolerable?
870334138917801984 2017-06-01 17:40:03 UTC <junseth> @provoost @izakaminska If you keep saying stuff like that, people are going to take me seriously and I'll have to cash that capital in by running an ICO.
870328585906728960 2017-06-01 17:17:59 UTC <junseth> @izakaminska @provoost 2/ Good journalism requires an ability to extract truth from claims. She is better than anyone else at doing that in the space.

870010200656404480 2017-05-31 20:12:50 UTC <junseth> ICOs are the reason block times matter. If you use Bitcoin, you might be too late.
869998415823982592 2017-05-31 19:26:00 UTC <junseth> Hear that? It's the sound of souls being sucked out of people like @BrendanEich whose ICOs sold out faster than a Bieber concert.

864138828017278976 2017-05-15 15:22:06 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @cyounessi1 3/ What we know about bad press is that it is often descriptions of other people needing Bitcoin.
864138565814558721 2017-05-15 15:21:03 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @cyounessi1 2/ Hoping that subsequent speculation arises is a pipe dream. Most of the world views this as bad press.
864138407437533186 2017-05-15 15:20:25 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @cyounessi1 1/ You're describing speculation arising from use. That's fine. But the value of Bitcoin is in non-speculative use. That's what this is.

863768074771718144 2017-05-14 14:48:51 UTC <junseth> @Truthcoin @Chris_Said 1/ You should consider that events like this are what you are investing in when you have bitcoin. 75k computers now require bitcoin.

851794055625412609 2017-04-11 13:48:23 UTC <junseth> @C1aranMurray Interesting. So if blockspace is rivalrous, causes uncompensated harm to other users, and is non-excludable... what does that make it?

851785267526676482 2017-04-11 13:13:27 UTC <junseth> @C1aranMurray Interesting. So the use of the chain has a cost that is born by the participants that is not fully realized at the time of the tx?
851785074471305216 2017-04-11 13:12:41 UTC <junseth> @C1aranMurray Interesting. It sounds like everyone has access to this chain and it's hard to exclude them from the blockspace.

851667672609824771 2017-04-10 05:26:11 UTC <junseth> @R_Thaler Why don't they just hand out a sheet that asks passengers "what is the lowest amount you'd accept to re-book" and do a blind auction?
851588814728552452 2017-04-10 00:12:49 UTC <junseth> @C1aranMurray Gotten awful quiet. The next question I will ask is why don't miners just exclude those enormous txs?
851579767119908864 2017-04-10 23:36:52 UTC <junseth> @C1aranMurray Oh, so if like a person composes a tx that is enormous, then the network has to bear that cost forever?
851570932502188032 2017-04-10 23:01:46 UTC <junseth> @C1aranMurray ic. And the immutability of that blockspace, validation costs, tx size (all part and parcel) doesn't matter? B/Cs are just free storage?
851556227222052864 2017-04-10 22:03:20 UTC <junseth> @C1aranMurray Nope. So walk me through it. How is blockspace excludable?

851516538129612800 2017-04-10 19:25:37 UTC <junseth> @cyounessi1 3/ given enough hashing power, you could likely grind that and make it less... random. This is a perverse mining incentive.
851516448824590337 2017-04-10 19:25:16 UTC <junseth> @cyounessi1 2/ Blackjack requires a centralized oracle for random num generation. Or, it can be shitty b/j using the next nonce...
851516171811729410 2017-04-10 19:24:10 UTC <junseth> @cyounessi1 1/ You can't do blackjack on the blockchain. The entire set of cards is known to everyone. Atomic swaps are done on Bitcoin.

851508457182285824 2017-04-10 18:53:31 UTC <junseth> @cyounessi1 So to my point  you refuse to provide examples, you link me to a reddit post where I ask for examples and you again refuse to provide?

850055049585676288 2017-04-06 18:38:11 UTC <junseth> @ryaneshea @BrendanEich Stating things ought to be a certain way or calling it a problem is a moral position. You can't know what constitutes a "too high" fee.
850051736068792320 2017-04-06 18:25:01 UTC <junseth> @ryaneshea @BrendanEich Such a weird moral position. Bitcoin gets more and more used, and the fees are too high?
849302446631473152 2017-04-04 16:47:37 UTC <junseth> @Microsoft invested $240MM in @face for over 1.6% of the company. That investment has grown 27x. Kind of incredible.
848892012547854336 2017-04-03 13:36:42 UTC <junseth> @ofnumbers @ToneVays @derosetech @MalthusJohn Also, asserting the words model t snd other dead tech is not an argument. It's a list of things.
848891762882031616 2017-04-03 13:35:42 UTC <junseth> @ofnumbers @ToneVays @derosetech @MalthusJohn You don't have to know where your arguments came from for me to know you are applying someone else's thoughts to your claims.
848888858934747136 2017-04-03 13:24:10 UTC <junseth> @ToneVays @derosetech @MalthusJohn You're just repeating tim @ofnumbers arguments.
848881042664697857 2017-04-03 12:53:06 UTC <junseth> @panic_trader @ToneVays @derosetech @PichlerD Would you divulge forus this initial application?
848873255477948416 2017-04-03 12:22:10 UTC <junseth> @panic_trader @ToneVays @PichlerD @derosetech That mighthave been true two years ago, but gamblers and prostitutes have really stepped their price support up recently.
848773792763699202 2017-04-02 05:46:56 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @ToneVays @woooshtrader @MalthusJohn Perfectly fine Malthus. But you keep alluding to mysterious innovations come to from other alts. But you can't name one.
848773585938395136 2017-04-02 05:46:06 UTC <junseth> @Ripple @derosetech @ToneVays @marccwr doubt it. :)
848771547414355969 2017-04-02 05:38:00 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @ToneVays @woooshtrader @MalthusJohn @fluffyponyza Well darn. That bodes pretty poorly for @malthusjohn's argument.
848771435602595841 2017-04-02 05:37:34 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @ToneVays @woooshtrader @MalthusJohn Any examples? Or you relying on me to make your arguments for you?
848770476474281986 2017-04-02 05:33:45 UTC <junseth> @ToneVays @woooshtrader @derosetech @MalthusJohn So you have 000000000zero00000000 examples of innovations that came from altcoins?
848769437855608832 2017-04-02 05:29:38 UTC <junseth> @ToneVays @MalthusJohn @derosetech @wheelchairjuice You are a man among gods.
848768747829592064 2017-04-02 05:26:53 UTC <junseth> @ToneVays @derosetech @MalthusJohn I'm a teenager. You're an idiot. At least I'll grow up. Same question: What innovations do you like about the other coins?
848767864312139776 2017-04-02 05:23:22 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @ToneVays @woooshtrader @MalthusJohn But again, I like the challenge. Why don't you take us through some of the "innovations" you like from the other cryptos.pic.twitter.com/EoizqEbolC
848767339839586304 2017-04-02 05:21:17 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @ToneVays @woooshtrader @MalthusJohn Well, you probably can't point to innovations from anywhere else. Perhaps a few innovations have been imported from Monero. @fluffyponyza?
848765870432301057 2017-04-02 05:15:27 UTC <junseth> @ToneVays @derosetech @MalthusJohn Yes, and they are in competition with the other businesses doing the same thing. You haven't spent 10 seconds thinking about this.
848765407108485120 2017-04-02 05:13:37 UTC <junseth> @lightcoin @mikeinspace Well, there was also no trolling. The alternate emails were used because they banned the original for asking a question.
848762647902384130 2017-04-02 05:02:39 UTC <junseth> @lightcoin I wasn't impersonating people. They deleted my account w/o warning on http://21.co then kicked me out of slack when I asked why.
848762459292921857 2017-04-02 05:01:54 UTC <junseth> @ToneVays @derosetech @MalthusJohn Wow, so they taught you about Monopolies and how Bitcoin needs alts to flourish?
848760403987451904 2017-04-02 04:53:44 UTC <junseth> @mikeinspace @lightcoin :) Could be could be. So now wouldn't it be reasonable to find out why they shut down my account? They still won't say.
848757057222320128 2017-04-02 04:40:26 UTC <junseth> @ToneVays @derosetech @MalthusJohn Bitcoin isn't a business dumb dumb.

848753539983605765 2017-04-02 04:26:27 UTC <junseth> @mikeinspace @lightcoin Yup. I chose to put it into slack. I did not choose to broadcast it on Reddit. @21 did.
848753279131684864 2017-04-02 04:25:25 UTC <junseth> @ToneVays @derosetech @MalthusJohn It has everything to do with the point you just made. You said a bunch of babbly, ignorant nonsense. Then Chris answered.

845269933571411969 2017-03-24 13:43:51 UTC <junseth> @fluffyponyza @derosetech @prieff Miners are indifferent between high and low fees. They want the most profitable blocks.

845085114967166976 2017-03-23 01:29:26 UTC <junseth> @spiroseliot I'm willing to bet someone is incentivizing  thr move.
845080583076265984 2017-03-23 01:11:26 UTC <junseth> @spiroseliot ideological use is not real use. It's a willingness to make bad decisions.
845057113269395457 2017-03-23 23:38:10 UTC <junseth> Moreover @super3, bc ur network has no users, it's a near certainty u spent $1600 on fees because poorly composed tx, not because bitcoin.
845050654326448132 2017-03-23 23:12:30 UTC <junseth> @super3 what money are you using to cover these costs?
845049939000528897 2017-03-23 23:09:40 UTC <junseth> 3/ @super3 or is this a pr stunt like your microsoft azure pitch wherein @Microsoft is agreeing to host your user's child porn.
845049723300069378 2017-03-23 23:08:48 UTC <junseth> 2/ @super3 that would be bad project planning. Alternative: are you skeptical that payment channels will work well?
845049531498729473 2017-03-23 23:08:03 UTC <junseth> 1/ @super3 were you of the opinion that on a b/c with a diminshing block reward & growing use, the txs would cost less?
845049178678005760 2017-03-23 23:06:39 UTC <junseth> Complaining about fees here is being angry at the universe for forcing you to account for sunk and prospective costs @super3.
845047739075510272 2017-03-23 23:00:55 UTC <junseth> @p0nd3ea I'm sure of that. Decentralized protocols are not businesses unless decentralized is just a buzzword.
845047487463407620 2017-03-23 22:59:55 UTC <junseth> You know that no one uses storj @super3 lol. It's why you're paying the fees. Ur trying 2 subsidizing use by running a child porn charity.
845033671665094658 2017-03-23 22:05:01 UTC <junseth> 5/ @super3 You can move to any b/c platform you want. All u'll find is the decentralization is what makes it expensive, not miner's fees.
845033586508124160 2017-03-23 22:04:41 UTC <junseth> 4/ @super3 B/C you want to do "Decentralization" you have to be more expensive/less efficient than centralized options like DropBox.
845033451321544704 2017-03-23 22:04:09 UTC <junseth> 3/ @super3 Moving is a marketing stunt - not a pragmatic choice.
845032780299976706 2017-03-23 22:01:29 UTC <junseth> 2/ @super3 You could also just print a bunch of new tokens for your network and dump them on the market to keep prices low.
845032556202463236 2017-03-23 22:00:36 UTC <junseth> 1/ @super3 What I find humorous is that you should be indifferent to the fees on your network. You're playing Federal Reserve.
845032009269436417 2017-03-23 21:58:25 UTC <junseth> You tip more @super3. Who is paying these fees on Storj? The central Storj authority or the users?
845023091210309633 2017-03-23 21:22:59 UTC <junseth> @miketwenty1 What is the point of using it as a payment mechanism? The answer is 100% so they can do an ICO. #notbaseballcards
845005650107215873 2017-03-23 20:13:41 UTC <junseth> @ALGrendel spelling is for bees.
845005020307378178 2017-03-23 20:11:10 UTC <junseth> 4/ If storj can simply switch blockchains, then how does it benefit from immutability? Seems like b/c isn't necessary to its functioning.
845004668426223616 2017-03-23 20:09:47 UTC <junseth> 3/ Bare multi-sig was fought for by the counterparty and dropzone teams. @derosetech lead that fight.https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8079
845003464472080384 2017-03-23 20:04:59 UTC <junseth> 2/ It's a demonstration of why services can just use Bitcoin. Build tech, not a coin brand. No reason @storjproject has to have a coin.
845003092999507969 2017-03-23 20:03:31 UTC <junseth> 1/ Storj, a service nobody uses, is switching to ETH because of network conjestion that affects none of their users.http://blog.storj.io/post/158740607128/migration-from-counterparty-to-ethereum
844644697486364673 2017-03-22 20:19:23 UTC <junseth> It's nice to see the media move on from Bitcoin's dead because of bubble burst, to Bitcoin's dying because technical battles.
844644033075040257 2017-03-22 20:16:44 UTC <junseth> @CharlieShrem Lol, Charlie's catching up. These are pretty settled matters. Only Ver & r/btc takes issue with the state of things.

844383280224985090 2017-03-21 03:00:36 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @VitalikButerin government subsidy = government subsidy. The more it causes people to need bitcoin, the better for us.

834278159356948480 2017-02-21 05:46:27 UTC <junseth> @Fredilly @ThisIsNuse My work will 1 day end. Perhaps you can worship me. @21 will burn in eternal hell heated by butt box fumes.pic.twitter.com/MkSO4kyOKX
834193542633385984 2017-02-21 00:10:13 UTC <junseth> @Melt_Dem @SheCanTech My main deal is diversity. More women is better. I'd like @aantonop to stop driving them out with his sexism.
834193148469530624 2017-02-21 00:08:39 UTC <junseth> @BambouClub So if @21 deems someone as an enemy, they will delete their profile and steal their money?
834044554819014656 2017-02-21 14:18:12 UTC <junseth> @ChristofferDG no they deleted my account with no explanation and stole the money in it?
833899363831312385 2017-02-20 04:41:16 UTC <junseth> @AdgInteractive Good point.
833899133379477504 2017-02-20 04:40:21 UTC <junseth> @mikeinspace @timpastoor The decentralized identity program has seen some minor hiccups in the last week. Needs some regulation.
833893321365913604 2017-02-20 04:17:15 UTC <junseth> @timpastoor I would certainly trust government with my personal data over @21's considering their willingness to hand it out freely.
833891424621977601 2017-02-20 04:09:43 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @AdgInteractive Doin my best to scam you into wondering.
833891289275985921 2017-02-20 04:09:10 UTC <junseth> @billbarhydt @udiWertheimer Simple answer is they can't. Bill doesn't have an answer except they are going long and short on stuff.
833890859959595008 2017-02-20 04:07:28 UTC <junseth> @chronic Well, I would think @21 is probably responsible since they're the ones that published my email while promising to keep it safe.
833862968337190912 2017-02-20 02:16:38 UTC <junseth> As Pepeking I would like to declare today "Issue a Death Threat Day." It will give everyone a chance to understand the trappings of fame.
833857933062586368 2017-02-20 01:56:38 UTC <junseth> @Melt_Dem @SheCanTech I have submitted my information.

833597555208486912 2017-02-20 08:41:59 UTC <junseth> @thegrugq @christapeterso Well said.
833596525607518211 2017-02-20 08:37:53 UTC <junseth> @thegrugq @christapeterso Ok, I'm going to bed... w/ 1 eye open.

833593430748098560 2017-02-20 08:25:35 UTC <junseth> @thegrugq @christapeterso Very poetic.
833593378986135552 2017-02-20 08:25:23 UTC <junseth> @thegrugq @christapeterso I mean, I like Minnesota as much as the next guy. I'll just make sure not to email him when I'm heading there.
833592702990184448 2017-02-20 08:22:42 UTC <junseth> @thegrugq @christapeterso But it only turns on if I go to Minnesota. So I think I'm pretty safe.
833592263016058880 2017-02-20 08:20:57 UTC <junseth> @christapeterso @thegrugq Oh it is. :) The mark of celebrity is measured in death threats.
833591972619227137 2017-02-20 08:19:48 UTC <junseth> Very impressive stats @OverstockCEO https://md.t0.com/md/market-data.html. Looks like this is moving forward quickly!
833590896616669185 2017-02-20 08:15:31 UTC <junseth> @MrJohnsonRN @KennethFolk Sorry, I thought I had posted it with the timestamp.
833590022901227526 2017-02-20 08:12:03 UTC <junseth> @Bitafrica I had to censor his email. After @21 published my personal email resulting in a death threat, I didn't want Simon to get 1 2.
833589711755235328 2017-02-20 08:10:49 UTC <junseth> @thegrugq @christapeterso There is a distinction between a death threat and a threat to actually murder you. Let us not forget that.

833529094935609344 2017-02-19 04:09:57 UTC <junseth> What bothers me most is that they are discriminating against those participating in the decentralized identity program as well.

822855725454069761 2017-01-21 17:17:47 UTC <junseth> @mikeinspace This might be the best interview I've ever given. @DaveWolk @nvk @YouTube @derosetech
822855501058863105 2017-01-21 17:16:54 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @Bitafrica Was it the interviews in the bathroom that betrayed our arrogance?
822827248029990917 2017-01-21 15:24:37 UTC <junseth> @nvk We did the interview on @Wayne_Chain
822824707321974784 2017-01-21 15:14:32 UTC <junseth> @blockchainjesus How can there be scaling problems? This program has no throughput requirements, no servers... just willing participants.
822824231381639168 2017-01-21 15:12:38 UTC <junseth> @brian_armstrong Don't worry Brian. Prayer stopped working 1000 years ago when the LORD turned over the prayerchain to blockstream.

822569877202436098 2017-01-20 22:21:55 UTC <junseth> @derosetech value happens when a person produces in a pristine space. We make inside the fart zone. No one has gone there before.

818871935580958720 2017-01-10 17:27:38 UTC <junseth> @GabeCoin @derosetech @davisconnorscot The conclusion is a surprise. We actually advocate purchasing VTSMXCOIN.
818870874023596035 2017-01-10 17:23:24 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @AndreasBeier this conversation made us all better people. Andreas has been revealed as a north korean spy.
818869942804221952 2017-01-10 17:19:42 UTC <junseth> @GabeCoin @derosetech @ruiquelhas that is in the saas chapter.
818602564006674432 2017-01-09 23:37:14 UTC <junseth> @GabeCoin @polsymtas @derosetech I think it would make a great chapter.

818509844621774849 2017-01-09 17:28:48 UTC <junseth> @laurenduca @chongodro1d Well, she's a racist. @jack should apply the same standards and ban her.
818494870545375233 2017-01-09 16:29:18 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @misterdna @mikeinspace She doesn't want to be complicit in the deception. She wants to be deceived.
818494726911434752 2017-01-09 16:28:44 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @mikeinspace Duh.
818493450102444032 2017-01-09 16:23:40 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @misterdna @mikeinspace Sometimes, people want to be deceived.
818493396738260997 2017-01-09 16:23:27 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @mikeinspace It's a weird equilibrium we've all reached. It doesn't matter what she says she wants, btw.
818332939683557376 2017-01-08 05:45:51 UTC <junseth> @jack @laurenduca As a black trans cis woman, u can't imagine the hate and vitriol I receive on a daily basis on Twitter.
818106229977391105 2017-01-08 14:44:59 UTC <junseth> @jaysamit you spoke at their event. I think you gave your speech to them to use however. :)
818002243018522625 2017-01-07 07:51:47 UTC <junseth> Just saw your speech to OneCoiners. Love your stuff. @OneCoinCrypto is the best. Thanks for introducing me @jaysamit
817817894662926336 2017-01-07 19:39:15 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @Xentagz @coinandco @timpastoor were you telling a joke? Because that's hilarious. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Amsterdam
817749652988694529 2017-01-07 15:08:04 UTC <junseth> @tradewithdave This is true. Which means the biggest efficiencies here are probably in doing service, labor intensive biz.
817749402374828032 2017-01-07 15:07:05 UTC <junseth> @MoneroApparel @TuskBilasimo @timpastoor :) They should make them out of hemp.

817602587985846272 2017-01-06 05:23:41 UTC <junseth> @bedehomender Btw, I think you're literally discussing specialization.
817599677923201024 2017-01-06 05:12:08 UTC <junseth> 4/ @bedehomender If you don't believe that's mean reverting, then explain why VCs return < average returns.
817599495286456320 2017-01-06 05:11:24 UTC <junseth> 3/ @bedehomender Hum. Cap. lets people hold diversifiable risk unilaterally. They can invest in their own ability to take on that risk.
817598953357275136 2017-01-06 05:09:15 UTC <junseth> 2/ @bedehomender For most part, EMH says ur compensated for risks you can't diversify away through holding large basket of sim'lr risk.
817598774029721603 2017-01-06 05:08:32 UTC <junseth> 1/ @bedehomender You have to define what you are compensated for when investing.
817598294310391808 2017-01-06 05:06:38 UTC <junseth> 2/ @bedehomender Ur world has a cost at which any1 can produce masterpieces. Prob'ly makes it a nonsystematic risk - Mozart a lucky anomaly.
817598176303661056 2017-01-06 05:06:10 UTC <junseth> 1/ @bedehomender Cost is the value of the thing being risked bud. This example is completely inane.
817596825343524864 2017-01-06 05:00:48 UTC <junseth> @bedehomender Was ur case that systematic risk can be highly compensated while unsystematic risk is mean-reverting?
817596307380568064 2017-01-06 04:58:44 UTC <junseth> @bedehomender The cost of training is in part price of human capital. That is the risk... What are ur returns on $1 and mine on $10k?
817595294351237121 2017-01-06 04:54:43 UTC <junseth> @bedehomender No, it's the thing you risk. U can certainly parse my words. I'll be more exact. Risking Hum. cap is the act...
817594947805282304 2017-01-06 04:53:20 UTC <junseth> @bedehomender Toy case?
817594524113498112 2017-01-06 04:51:39 UTC <junseth> @bedehomender In that case, u should probably not invest ur human capital in making music. Mozart's better prepared to take on the risks.
817593950794055680 2017-01-06 04:49:22 UTC <junseth> 6/ @bedehomender This is Fama's position. @WarrenBuffett might be lucky, or he might hv a skill that lets him take non-diversifiable risk.
817593159601504256 2017-01-06 04:46:14 UTC <junseth> 5/ @bedehomender Simply: if you are compensated for your investment of hum. cap. either u were lucky or u took on non-diversifiable risk.
817592754666545152 2017-01-06 04:44:37 UTC <junseth> 4/ @bedehomender most risks that human capital allows one to take on can be diversified away (VC's do it).
817592437271134209 2017-01-06 04:43:21 UTC <junseth> 3/ @bedehomender EMH would say that any risk that can be diversified away will suffer from mean reversion.
817592131720192000 2017-01-06 04:42:08 UTC <junseth> 2/ @bedehomender Human capital is a way investors can take on unilateral (systematic) risk (concept risk, managerial risk, etc).
817591929504403456 2017-01-06 04:41:20 UTC <junseth> 1/ @bedehomender I don't claim that. I claim that indexing is the cheapest pair of pants. EMH demonstrates that.
817591659294760961 2017-01-06 04:40:16 UTC <junseth> @bedehomender Capital is what you risk. Human capital is the act of putting your own abilities on the line. Not sure what u think I think.
817586032933801984 2017-01-06 04:17:54 UTC <junseth> @fluffyponyza They are wearing expensive pants.
817585815169728512 2017-01-06 04:17:03 UTC <junseth> @bedehomender Every1 believes that. Where do u think 1 gets $$$ to invest? "Human capital" is a umbrella for all kinds of unilateral risk.

806379180749443072 2016-12-06 06:05:53 UTC <junseth> @sowhatist @derosetech @tokeweed1 The question ought to be, why do the markets act like they are efficient in spite of irrational people?

806378054918504449 2016-12-06 06:01:24 UTC <junseth> @sowhatist @derosetech @tokeweed1 I see. And how does it invalidate the principles of efficient markets?

797120319760822272 2016-11-11 16:54:28 UTC <junseth> @MrHodl @arronschaar @hq83bnn9 What is the emission schedule of RSK?
797115339280646144 2016-11-11 16:34:41 UTC <junseth> @MrHodl @hq83bnn9 Do you realize that there is risk to the basket in crypto?
797114877991092224 2016-11-11 16:32:51 UTC <junseth> @hq83bnn9 Raise your hand if you've ever asked it and the person arguing is literally 16.
797114702836985857 2016-11-11 16:32:09 UTC <junseth> @MrHodl @hq83bnn9 lol, what does the RSK emission schedule look like?

797093867241795584 2016-11-11 15:09:21 UTC <junseth> @bergealex4 @hq83bnn9 @MrHodl Truth. So you need to evaluate the chances of it dev'ing a circ econ. RSK has no shot. No one needs it.
797092383099940864 2016-11-11 15:03:28 UTC <junseth> @bergealex4 @MrHodl @hq83bnn9 Bitcoin was a ponzi until it developed a circular economy.
797092239797272577 2016-11-11 15:02:53 UTC <junseth> @bergealex4 @MrHodl @hq83bnn9 What is the emmission schedule for RSK's sidechain?
797092014877802497 2016-11-11 15:02:00 UTC <junseth> @hq83bnn9 @MrHodl No. They use the 2-way peg and a federated server model to hold it together. Different risk means token isn't Bitcoin.

797078942226251778 2016-11-11 14:10:03 UTC <junseth> 2/ @hq83bnn9 Calling it "the next big thing" is a pump. RSK is not Bitcoin.
797078798206455808 2016-11-11 14:09:29 UTC <junseth> 1/ @hq83bnn9 If there is a token, it can be pumped. RSK has no use, and it's going to turn into a Ponzi or a tip-power B/C.
797078578760388609 2016-11-11 14:08:36 UTC <junseth> @kyletorpey @eiaine @matt_levine @Excellion @slushcz No 1 ignores. You don't ask answerable/interesting questions.
796854726247796737 2016-11-10 23:19:06 UTC <junseth> @hq83bnn9 It does have a token?
796853698513215489 2016-11-10 23:15:01 UTC <junseth> @hq83bnn9 I see. So is it your contention that RSK has no token?
796846035897380864 2016-11-10 22:44:34 UTC <junseth> @slushcz Oh... u think "Market efficiency, long-term returns, and behavioral finance" isn't a scientific analysis?

767802515643625472 2016-08-22 19:15:59 UTC <junseth> @bergealex4 @leashless No it doesn't. They are there defending bitcoin. I think you misunderstand the function of mining.
767799462748102657 2016-08-22 19:03:51 UTC <junseth> @leashless @bergealex4 Your misreading that. It says for short spurts of time, energy here is cheaper.

767794513637208064 2016-08-22 18:44:11 UTC <junseth> @leashless 3/ Extracting energy in china to send fungible value everywhere else is tragic for China, not for Bitcoin or the US generally.
767794383341154305 2016-08-22 18:43:40 UTC <junseth> @leashless 2/ Blockchains need to be protected by hashpower. The places a B/C is most vulnerable are where energy is cheapest.
767794190566748160 2016-08-22 18:42:54 UTC <junseth> @leashless 1/ Miners can move Vinay. Bitcoins exist where energy is cheapest. Just like diamonds exist where dinosaurs died.
767790160968871937 2016-08-22 18:26:53 UTC <junseth> @leashless Btw, your point about "China capturing Bitcoin" is one of the most ignorant statements I've ever heard. Might be time to shhh.

762381382685339649 2016-08-07 20:14:20 UTC <junseth> Well, @bitcoin3000 debating ideas with crazies is fruitless. They end up outsourcing their thinking because they lack cognition.
762368858321719296 2016-08-07 19:24:34 UTC <junseth> @WayneVaughan @tone_llt @misterdna @bitcoin3000 uh oh, the crazy has awaked.

762308143653195776 2016-08-07 15:23:19 UTC <junseth> @tone_llt @misterdna the bitcoin devs have been warning of the very thing that happened in eth for more than a year now.
762306898037248001 2016-08-07 15:18:22 UTC <junseth> @Truthcoin @derosetech @WayneVaughan @tone_llt eth is the creation of a string of political, non-science decisions.
762306733675012096 2016-08-07 15:17:42 UTC <junseth> @tone_llt @misterdna lol, if that were true, the eth team wouldnt have been left flatfooted about the dao or replay attack.
762305903450267648 2016-08-07 15:14:24 UTC <junseth> @tone_llt @misterdna decisions by eth maintainers are politically motivated. Not scientifically.
762305508044832768 2016-08-07 15:12:50 UTC <junseth> @Truthcoin @derosetech @WayneVaughan @tone_llt @misterdna that is not science.

762296222782631936 2016-08-07 14:35:56 UTC <junseth> @Truthcoin @derosetech @WayneVaughan @tone_llt I think that was when adam and eve were created.
762264052865171457 2016-08-07 12:28:07 UTC <junseth> @rogerkver @derosetech @VitalikButerin bitcoin is a shallow market filled with 16 year olds. BTW if volume is king, does etc win?

760845060988542976 2016-08-03 14:29:33 UTC <junseth> @bitfinex @brianchoffman We shall see what their policy says. My guess is that appropriately released funds aren't covered.
760828857192681472 2016-08-03 13:25:09 UTC <junseth> @bitfinex @brianchoffman I don't think they have insurance.
760826926525194241 2016-08-03 13:17:29 UTC <junseth> @bitfinex @brianchoffman Theft. Also, BTC isn't necessarily deflationary. That's demonstrable by today's 20% inflation of Bitcoin.
760826337628160001 2016-08-03 13:15:09 UTC <junseth> @bitfinex @brianchoffman Holding value or not has nothing to do with inflation/deflation.
760823670134693888 2016-08-03 13:04:33 UTC <junseth> @bitfinex @tradewithdave I thought it was Jose Bank.
760821871843696641 2016-08-03 12:57:24 UTC <junseth> @bitfinex @brianchoffman Banks don't want to hold $USD. Exchanges don't want to hold $BTC. Risk in this scenario is zero sum.
760821265548644352 2016-08-03 12:54:59 UTC <junseth> @bitfinex @brianchoffman No amount of work one does can ever guarantee their security.
760821121939824640 2016-08-03 12:54:25 UTC <junseth> @bitfinex @MrHodl No you don't.
760820302511091712 2016-08-03 12:51:10 UTC <junseth> The @bitfinex heist demonstrates yet again, no one wants to hold their own value.
760719748682420224 2016-08-02 06:11:36 UTC <junseth> @prieff There will be a #BitcoinUncensored rollback overseen by @VitalikButerin and @bitfinex, the finest minds in the space.
760714194425679872 2016-08-02 05:49:31 UTC <junseth> With deepest regret, I must inform our users that #bitcoinuncensored has been hacked. Farting has halted until further notice.
760705654529097729 2016-08-02 05:15:35 UTC <junseth> @EthereumClassic volume is nearly double that of ETH on @Poloniex.

760699004367802368 2016-08-02 04:49:10 UTC <junseth> A blockchain Rollback must happen in the wake of @bitfinex hack. @VitalikButerin now is your moment. #bitcoin needs you!

760521287810678787 2016-08-02 17:02:59 UTC <junseth> @brianchoffman @openbazaar @nvk I bet it's to dump their liabilities on bag holders because they can't on other VC firms... @usv

760519886758039552 2016-08-02 16:57:25 UTC <junseth> How can USV simultaneously invest in @openbazaar and say app coins are needed for decentralized protocols? @brianchoffman #obcoin?
760097203641786368 2016-08-01 12:57:49 UTC <junseth> I think @circlepay not adding eth is accidental competitive move of year. Doing nothing is outsmarted @coinbase & @brian_armstrong.
759257021501890561 2016-07-29 05:19:14 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @westsidebitcoin you should refrain from compliments like this they just make our heads bigger.

759033465727700994 2016-07-29 14:30:55 UTC <junseth> Call @VitalikButerin, time to unfork.
759026180842332160 2016-07-29 14:01:58 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @kyletorpey I am incapable of answering any question.
759025702951800832 2016-07-29 14:00:04 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @kyletorpey When people say "I don't normally like," what follows is usually a descript'n of their fav thing.

759021485197373441 2016-07-29 13:43:18 UTC <junseth> @kyletorpey I think it's time you write an article on how @derosetech and I are the worst.
759021171266301954 2016-07-29 13:42:03 UTC <junseth> @LasseVigJensen Nope. @VitalikButerin is the smartest man alive. I am the dumbest man in Bitcoin.
759020832354033664 2016-07-29 13:40:43 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @Bitcoin_Embassy That doesn't surprise me. We were told that Litecoin miners weren't being produced by a former LTC miner.
759020642893037569 2016-07-29 13:39:57 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @Bitcoin_Embassy So was MMM.
758641347137904641 2016-07-28 12:32:46 UTC <junseth> You have again amazed me with the depth of your stupid.
758637101164339200 2016-07-28 12:15:54 UTC <junseth> @cafintechnet @derosetech @tradewithdave You truly are both Strunk & White.
758634218117226496 2016-07-28 12:04:26 UTC <junseth> Because  #ETH community put kindness over science, hard fork was implemented under the guise of morality. Contentiousness was ignored.
758397647543689217 2016-07-27 20:24:24 UTC <junseth> @derosetech Consider overpaying a CEO is likely to eat into corp profits. So that checks out.

742473308210368512 2016-06-13 21:46:45 UTC <junseth> @ErikVoorhees @JasonCoombsCEO that's not a meaningful equation.
742473099812212742 2016-06-13 21:45:56 UTC <junseth> @JasonCoombsCEO @ErikVoorhees that's one conspiracy.
742471674126340096 2016-06-13 21:40:16 UTC <junseth> @JasonCoombsCEO @ErikVoorhees It doesn't matter what the base monetary supply is. What matters is what you can buy with it.
742465114138238977 2016-06-13 21:14:12 UTC <junseth> @ErikVoorhees Your problem is you believe in all the stupidest finance conspiracies. @JasonCoombsCEO
742465009754595328 2016-06-13 21:13:47 UTC <junseth> @ErikVoorhees I have no doubt you understand how BTC works. It's @JasonCoombsCEO that def does not.
742464500129898496 2016-06-13 21:11:45 UTC <junseth> @JasonCoombsCEO @ErikVoorhees Then why can I buy a hamburger with my entry in a database?
742464326112415744 2016-06-13 21:11:04 UTC <junseth> @JasonCoombsCEO I'm going to take a little stab at guessing something here. You have no idea how BTC works do you? @ErikVoorhees
742464090077941761 2016-06-13 21:10:08 UTC <junseth> @JasonCoombsCEO @ErikVoorhees U have no idea how much BTC there is because fractional value is value.
742463918996520960 2016-06-13 21:09:27 UTC <junseth> @BTCarchitect @ErikVoorhees 2/ It's a kind of risk, and much of the systemic failure is de-risked through FDIC insurance.
742463738377211904 2016-06-13 21:08:44 UTC <junseth> @BTCarchitect @ErikVoorhees 1/ It's not fake data btw. And the fed doesn't enter it in. It's well understood ratio of reserves to loans.
742463526157983744 2016-06-13 21:07:53 UTC <junseth> @JasonCoombsCEO @ErikVoorhees Ahh, I thought you were talking to me. Yeah, @ this point, it's less likely that it won't be than will.
742463247677165568 2016-06-13 21:06:47 UTC <junseth> @ErikVoorhees @JasonCoombsCEO I'm willing to bet they don't.
742462923407163392 2016-06-13 21:05:29 UTC <junseth> @LoopyBit @ErikVoorhees You can't know that figure, because you have no idea how many xchanges are fractional. :)
742462571744104450 2016-06-13 21:04:06 UTC <junseth> @LoopyBit @ErikVoorhees Also, the fed targets a 2% inflation rate. U believe that hidden inflation exists - that's stupid.
742462405892939777 2016-06-13 21:03:26 UTC <junseth> @LoopyBit @ErikVoorhees FRB creates money. #BTC can be rehypothecated like any asset. U cn't know supply, esp. w/ a unreg, 0% res. ratio.
742461746820980736 2016-06-13 21:00:49 UTC <junseth> @JasonCoombsCEO @ErikVoorhees Implication of what? I don't think you know what that word means.
742461354108297216 2016-06-13 20:59:15 UTC <junseth> @JasonCoombsCEO @ErikVoorhees I refuted it Erik. You just don't understand how money works.
742459779054854144 2016-06-13 20:53:00 UTC <junseth> @LoopyBit @ErikVoorhees The fed targets a 2% inflation. That's not a mystery.
742459536737341441 2016-06-13 20:52:02 UTC <junseth> @ErikVoorhees @BTCarchitect U hv no idea how many exchanges are fractional right now. Fractional xchanges = more Bitcoins than u think.
742459285393702912 2016-06-13 20:51:02 UTC <junseth> @JasonCoombsCEO I don't think that #Bitcoin goes away. But ur right in pointing out the assumption @ErikVoorhees is making.
742459083475714048 2016-06-13 20:50:14 UTC <junseth> @ErikVoorhees No you can't. Ur supposition is based entirely on the notion that money is created through FRB. BTC doesn't preclude FRB.
742432767934406656 2016-06-13 19:05:40 UTC <junseth> @iamjohnoliver At 1.67%, over 43 years, you will have given away 50% of your earnings. :) Thanks for the expose.

732224029843546112 2016-05-16 14:59:47 UTC <junseth> @derosetech So you believe that government can not own land?
732223478372257793 2016-05-16 14:57:35 UTC <junseth> @derosetech Can the government own land?
732221927704526848 2016-05-16 14:51:26 UTC <junseth> @derosetech Nothing you say is "hard to get." It's always strange, and never thoughtful though.
732221231475228672 2016-05-16 14:48:40 UTC <junseth> @derosetech Me... I'm too stupid to understand that.
732219376695279616 2016-05-16 14:41:18 UTC <junseth> @derosetech sideways math from wayside school methinks. LAND TITLE + JUSTICE = SMART CONTRACT. #logic
732218868337250309 2016-05-16 14:39:16 UTC <junseth> @derosetech Government is a string. #logic
732218661742616576 2016-05-16 14:38:27 UTC <junseth> @derosetech And citizens r composed of molecules; molecules of atoms; atoms of strings. So really government is just string.
732218038846623744 2016-05-16 14:35:59 UTC <junseth> @derosetech you misunderstand. Chris and i are elite members of the Illuminati. We know more than you think we know.

732056072744239104 2016-05-15 03:52:23 UTC <junseth> @derosetech you say tomato i say tomato.
732055284319944705 2016-05-15 03:49:15 UTC <junseth> I define them as @derosetech passing gas.

732049365422866433 2016-05-15 03:25:44 UTC <junseth> @derosetech You're a crazy. Can you please provide a list of your meds?
732043694249889792 2016-05-15 03:03:12 UTC <junseth> @derosetech Oh, it's a potato building machine. Forgot about those.
732043376225181696 2016-05-15 03:01:56 UTC <junseth> He is. Good point. @derosetech how many potatoes are built when property is damaged?
732042152587321344 2016-05-15 02:57:04 UTC <junseth> @derosetech I will say no. I will define cost as # of potatoes built. 0 potatoes built when property's damaged = 0 cost.
732040733578797056 2016-05-15 02:51:26 UTC <junseth> @derosetech Oh, I didn't realize that. Yes @1cyrilblanc1, I think that world peace would be a good thing then.
732040509519073285 2016-05-15 02:50:32 UTC <junseth> @derosetech Your world is a dull, grey, un-nuanced place friend.
732040135336853506 2016-05-15 02:49:03 UTC <junseth> @derosetech I'd need to see the numbers. But immediate reaction is a resounding yes.
732035116147433472 2016-05-15 02:29:06 UTC <junseth> @derosetech Some questions are really dumb.
732034867169353730 2016-05-15 02:28:07 UTC <junseth> Hmm, I mean @derosetech is the numbers guy. So let me have him do the calculations. We'll send our results to @BarackObama.
732034632099602437 2016-05-15 02:27:11 UTC <junseth> @derosetech Because they're nonsense.
732034307326246913 2016-05-15 02:25:54 UTC <junseth> @derosetech It's a nonsense question.
732033064281378816 2016-05-15 02:20:57 UTC <junseth> @derosetech They can sell them to whomever has enough to pay them. I guess this is where regulation is probably good.
732032830109143040 2016-05-15 02:20:01 UTC <junseth> @alistairmilne @TuurDemeester it's dumb because miners can change their mind in a second. Namecoin prob'ly had more than 49% at one time.
732032363689967617 2016-05-15 02:18:10 UTC <junseth> @Textron @northropgrumman @Raytheon @AirbusGroup do you think world peace is good for your profits? @1cyrilblanc1 @derosetech
732029615934316546 2016-05-15 02:07:15 UTC <junseth> @derosetech Depends on your business.
732027750521798657 2016-05-15 01:59:50 UTC <junseth> @derosetech My butt is more coherent than you.
732026927721013248 2016-05-15 01:56:34 UTC <junseth> @derosetech Oh God.
732024160747065344 2016-05-15 01:45:34 UTC <junseth> @alistairmilne I'm betting this is false.
732018785519968257 2016-05-15 01:24:13 UTC <junseth> @derosetech The stupidity of this conversation is hurting my butt.
732013830713147392 2016-05-15 01:04:32 UTC <junseth> @derosetech You believe in Oracles Cyril. You've never had an original thought.
732012805738532865 2016-05-15 01:00:27 UTC <junseth> @derosetech NAP is stupid.
732009297836527616 2016-05-15 00:46:31 UTC <junseth> @derosetech Libertarianism is an insidious form of nationalism.

731605461481324544 2016-05-14 22:01:49 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @WayneVaughan @adam3us needs to hear that suggestion.
731569320367546368 2016-05-14 19:38:12 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @kyletorpey @fluffyponyza I think the general point is that 16 year olds make 16 year old decisions.
731568304502906880 2016-05-14 19:34:10 UTC <junseth> @msantoriESQ Haha, I mean, that would be the same question I would ask of almost all of these projects.

730658700516458500 2016-05-12 07:19:43 UTC <junseth> @derosetech @kyletorpey It's so incredibly stupid it's hard for us to care about. But I think we need to talk about it.
730461852023566338 2016-05-11 18:17:31 UTC <junseth> Is an indistinguishable dollar printed from my computer an addition to the money supply or a forged dollar?
730255597275336704 2016-05-10 04:37:56 UTC <junseth> @kyletorpey @1cyrilblanc1 @MrHodl @CoinJournal Agreed. And I also think it would be better to let that person steal from me than die.

710900116186669056 2016-03-18 18:46:10 UTC <junseth> .@TheBTCGame I suspect LTB is buying their shows bot listens. Just working on seeing who knows what.

710894981125427200 2016-03-18 18:25:45 UTC <junseth> .@seb2point0 @epicenterbtc So, considering you're attempting /s, why don't you explain why your show gets no comments but 11k listens?
710894126988972032 2016-03-18 18:22:22 UTC <junseth> .@seb2point0 So that my number of bot listens increases?

705959127382630401 2016-03-04 03:32:26 UTC <junseth> @izakaminska See everyone, that's how you come to consensus. :)
705959020172087296 2016-03-04 03:32:01 UTC <junseth> @izakaminska Yes. There are lots of idiots in Bitcoin. @brian_armstrong's entire business is to make money on them.
705958485394124801 2016-03-04 03:29:53 UTC <junseth> @izakaminska My point would be that's where the only efficiency is right now.
705958294775582721 2016-03-04 03:29:08 UTC <junseth> @izakaminska Bitcoin is for the underserviced. @coinbase does not facilitate that demo. It's a bank, but with the Bitcoin.
705957843665600513 2016-03-04 03:27:20 UTC <junseth> @izakaminska That may be what some think; not me. But again, @brian_armstrong's trying to let in the non-existent hoardes at the gate.
705957472943607808 2016-03-04 03:25:52 UTC <junseth> @izakaminska Right. But to your points, Bitcoin's userbase is small. @brian_armstrong's point is that there is a flood waiting to come in.
705957244052049921 2016-03-04 03:24:57 UTC <junseth> @izakaminska @brian_armstrong is patronizing the men who work on the protocol in a way that is, IMO extremely low-brow and dishonest.
705956890950438912 2016-03-04 03:23:33 UTC <junseth> @izakaminska But I promise you it's not the position of @adam3us or other core contributors. It's a bad re-casting of a @brucefenton point.
705956287062908928 2016-03-04 03:21:09 UTC <junseth> @izakaminska :) No doubt. Voltaire is everywhere. But again, no one is arguing for the developmen of a perfect system.
705956014030528512 2016-03-04 03:20:04 UTC <junseth> 2/ @izakaminska Even still, @brian_armstrong is unrelenting in his desire for 2MB. I think he's using 2MBs as a proxy for "new dev team."
705955671326466048 2016-03-04 03:18:42 UTC <junseth> 1/ @izakaminska Certainly. But no one is advocating perfection. @brian_armstrong is insisting on 2 MBs, capacity given to him by Segwit.
705953289318363137 2016-03-04 03:09:14 UTC <junseth> @izakaminska @brian_armstrong is rewording something @brucefenton said at the @SatoshiRoundtbl He reworded it not knowing it's Voltaire.
705832792001810432 2016-03-04 19:10:26 UTC <junseth> @kathleenbreit @derosetech @acityinohio I hope you're kidding.

705790963982180354 2016-03-04 16:24:13 UTC <junseth> @JamesGDAngelo @derosetech @brian_armstrong @coinbase Bet ur going to tell us Satoshi was 51%ing. Having 51% of hashing != 51% attack. :)
705789350555095040 2016-03-04 16:17:48 UTC <junseth> @JamesGDAngelo @derosetech $10 from me $10 from @brian_armstrong. He promises to use his @coinbase account to pay. :)

705169069885018112 2016-03-02 23:13:02 UTC <junseth> @olivierjanss @adam3us hmm. Based on this answer I'd like to withdraw my support for classic.

702873530023673856 2016-02-25 15:11:22 UTC <junseth> This is a ridiculous claim. Those firms can pay pennies more per tx and get them through in 1 or 2 blocks.https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/702584200248041473

699425128296411136 2016-02-15 02:48:39 UTC <junseth> @Netcube93 @derosetech @ChrisDunnTV Ok. So Feb 4th is in December. Therefore, the pump wasn't a pump because it was on Feb 4th in Feb?

697789326252511232 2016-02-11 14:28:34 UTC <junseth> @brian_armstrong Of course SW is more complex. It's new code. The HF is 1 variable change. Nothing to do with the quality of the idea.

691843329642864640 2016-01-25 04:41:18 UTC <junseth> 2/ @1cyrilblanc1 @adam3us Taxes are what the government takes. Because the gov says they are not theft or extortion, they are neither.
691842556250947584 2016-01-25 04:38:13 UTC <junseth> 1/ @1cyrilblanc1 @adam3us Theft is a crime committed by a thief. Extortion is a crime committed by an extortionist.

691839602844368897 2016-01-25 04:26:29 UTC <junseth> @1cyrilblanc1 @adam3us I don't accept the Bastian premise that if an individual cannot do it, neither can government.
691837092985438208 2016-01-25 04:16:31 UTC <junseth> @1cyrilblanc1 @VitalikButerin I doubt he's advocating it. I assume he's describing what he believes to exist, not what is ideal.

691700543190888449 2016-01-25 19:13:55 UTC <junseth> @docbtc @VitalikButerin #bitcoin is the permissionless onramp for stake coins; POS & its fungibility are dependent on Bitcoin's POW.
691699462599737344 2016-01-25 19:09:37 UTC <junseth> @docbtc @VitalikButerin You need permissionless on-ramps, or fungibility breaks. POS doesn't provide that.
691644490071805952 2016-01-25 15:31:11 UTC <junseth> @VitalikButerin That's not true. You can import miners and join pools. Already done in countries going belly up.
691617582181453824 2016-01-25 13:44:15 UTC <junseth> @VitalikButerin Making things illegal does not make them enforceable.  You can't do capital flight if there is no work.
691524351993237506 2016-01-24 07:33:48 UTC <junseth> @1cyrilblanc1 Correct. Bitcoin does censorship resistance. That doesn't mean taxes are or are not theft.

691511033664417792 2016-01-24 06:40:52 UTC <junseth> @VitalikButerin A country cannot make burning electricity illegal. But they can very easily stop you from withdrawing money.
691496324429053952 2016-01-24 05:42:25 UTC <junseth> @VitalikButerin You must first stake. It means that there is no on-ramp that converts non-fungible energy bills into fungible value. :)
