965299120633274372 2018-02-18 18:56:59 UTC <DMoney_904> My initial assessment was wrong. I thought Bagley was being held out to get Carter some more attention. But in reality it was to get Grayson out of his slump. It all makes sense now.

A joke, again, a joke was made. I responded with a funny GIF, or at least I thought it was funny, I mean its The Office, b/c I thought the original joke was funny. And then you turn it political, and then call me names

955966902345654272 2018-01-23 00:54:05 UTC <DMoney_904> What a joke, wasn't really planning on watching the Super Bowl, now I'm definitely not. Because players kneeling is somehow not a "political statement." The double standard in America is realhttps://twitter.com/FoxBusiness/status/955949531769856005
955823852386480128 2018-01-23 15:25:39 UTC <DMoney_904> Best line from the article. Perhaps the Goodell was concerned that a political statement in the game day program might take away from the political statements being made on the football field when players take a knee.http://fxn.ws/2DxPIDW
955618581986840576 2018-01-22 01:49:59 UTC <DMoney_904> @SloneScott He also looks like he was running errands and remembered he had to go coach a game

939229217111277568 2017-12-08 20:24:30 UTC <DMoney_904> @theAUDL @Ulti_world @apalm_is_napalm Mostly disc movement and overall speed physical ability. Which creates an overall slower game. IMO, you grow the game (any game) thru mens b/c its typically more exciting, fast pace action. You dont see women in the NBA, MLB, NFL, EPL or PGA Tour.
939220513288749056 2017-12-08 19:49:54 UTC <DMoney_904> @theAUDL @Ulti_world @apalm_is_napalm One the field is larger. And two because women are not as fast, as strong or can jump as high as men. Again biology. This creates a slower game, not as slow as womens but slower than men, and to me its not as fun watch. Why Im for sep. pro leagues. Like other pro/coll sports
939206051982954497 2017-12-08 18:52:27 UTC <DMoney_904> @theAUDL @Ulti_world Let me preface, Im fine with the USAU mixed division. But the elite (which would include college) and Pro lvl of any sport shouldnt be mixed. At these lvls women cant compete physically with men. Sorry, its biology. Make a womens Pro division, and keep the mens div the same

849686864621711367 2017-04-05 18:15:09 UTC <DMoney_904> @MoorerBradley But this is a tournament anyone w/in a 5 shot of the lead on Sunday could win.

744686389376094212 2016-06-19 00:20:45 UTC <DMoney_904> Now time for Game 7. Go Cavs!!
744683864048697344 2016-06-19 00:10:43 UTC <DMoney_904> Mickelson won his first major at 33. DJ is about to turn 32.
744683314628300801 2016-06-19 00:08:32 UTC <DMoney_904> Congratulations @DJohnsonPGA. Well deserved! Hopefully the first of many. Stayed focused amid USGA distraction. #USOpen

744675272960548868 2016-06-19 23:36:35 UTC <DMoney_904> My question is why did they wait till DJ was in a critical stretch to bring this up. It happened on 5, review it right away.#USOpen
744310873150230528 2016-06-18 23:28:35 UTC <DMoney_904> I agreehttps://twitter.com/NFL_Memes/status/744285562799005696

742577304035950593 2016-06-13 04:40:00 UTC <DMoney_904> James and Irving combined accounted for 73% of the Cavs points. That % increase when factoring in the 13 combined assists. #StatOfTheDay
741332057134010368 2016-06-10 18:11:50 UTC <DMoney_904> At this rate, probably. But hoping the @JaxCannons give them their first loss Saturday. #BOOMhttps://twitter.com/theAUDL/status/741320362466508800

722963407947751424 2016-04-20 01:41:23 UTC <DMoney_904> @BlueDevilNation Thornton going to UM would be a slap in the face. And so much for wanting to stay close to home
719318965407756288 2016-04-10 00:19:40 UTC <DMoney_904> Willett still had to make the shots to win, give him the credit he deserves.
719318714437349377 2016-04-10 00:18:40 UTC <DMoney_904> Unfortunately this Masters is going to be remembered for Spieth's collapse instead of Willett's win.

Because players kneeling is somehow not a "political statement." The double standard in America is realhttps://twitter.com/FoxBusiness/status/955949531769856005
955823852386480128 2018-01-23 15:25:39 UTC <DMoney_904> Best line from the article. Perhaps the Goodell was concerned that a political statement in the game day program might take away from the political statements being made on the football field when players take a knee.http://fxn.ws/2DxPIDW

939229217111277568 2017-12-08 20:24:30 UTC <DMoney_904> @theAUDL @Ulti_world @apalm_is_napalm Mostly disc movement and overall speed physical ability. Which creates an overall slower game. IMO, you grow the game (any game) thru mens b/c its typically more exciting, fast pace action. You dont see women in the NBA, MLB, NFL, EPL or PGA Tour.
939220513288749056 2017-12-08 19:49:54 UTC <DMoney_904> @theAUDL @Ulti_world @apalm_is_napalm One the field is larger. And two because women are not as fast, as strong or can jump as high as men. Again biology. This creates a slower game, not as slow as womens but slower than men, and to me its not as fun watch. Why Im for sep. pro leagues. Like other pro/coll sports
939206051982954497 2017-12-08 18:52:27 UTC <DMoney_904> @theAUDL @Ulti_world Let me preface, Im fine with the USAU mixed division. But the elite (which would include college) and Pro lvl of any sport shouldnt be mixed. At these lvls women cant compete physically with men. Sorry, its biology. Make a womens Pro division, and keep the mens div the same

753186595159834624 2016-07-13 11:17:32 UTC <DMoney_904> Stuart Scott was a legend! I still get chills when I listen to highlights he called. He was truly cooler than the other side of the pillow.

750005160521396224 2016-07-04 16:35:39 UTC <DMoney_904> On top of all that, OKC was a win away from the Finals this year
750004833332125700 2016-07-04 16:34:21 UTC <DMoney_904> Durant to GS will be interesting. I don't know how he will fit in. He's going to want the ball, more than Curry's going to give to him.

744683864048697344 2016-06-19 00:10:43 UTC <DMoney_904> Mickelson won his first major at 33. DJ is about to turn 32.
744683314628300801 2016-06-19 00:08:32 UTC <DMoney_904> Congratulations @DJohnsonPGA. Well deserved! Hopefully the first of many. Stayed focused amid USGA distraction. #USOpen

744675272960548868 2016-06-19 23:36:35 UTC <DMoney_904> My question is why did they wait till DJ was in a critical stretch to bring this up. It happened on 5, review it right away.#USOpen

742577304035950593 2016-06-13 04:40:00 UTC <DMoney_904> James and Irving combined accounted for 73% of the Cavs points. That % increase when factoring in the 13 combined assists. #StatOfTheDay
741332057134010368 2016-06-10 18:11:50 UTC <DMoney_904> At this rate, probably. But hoping the @JaxCannons give them their first loss Saturday. #BOOMhttps://twitter.com/theAUDL/status/741320362466508800

719318965407756288 2016-04-10 00:19:40 UTC <DMoney_904> Willett still had to make the shots to win, give him the credit he deserves.
719318714437349377 2016-04-10 00:18:40 UTC <DMoney_904> Unfortunately this Masters is going to be remembered for Spieth's collapse instead of Willett's win.

711657286683508736 2016-03-20 20:54:53 UTC <DMoney_904> The ACC is killing it in the tournament this year.
711644444273938434 2016-03-20 20:03:51 UTC <DMoney_904> I had some doubts. And they are proving me wrong.https://twitter.com/247sports/status/711614767471972352

709135646724661248 2016-03-13 21:54:47 UTC <DMoney_904> I don't agree that UNC and UVA should have gotten 1 seeds out of the ACC. Should have just been UNC. MSU deserved a 1 seed.
