971044435747360771 2018-03-06 15:26:49 UTC <IWBorter> If the Left's galas suffer from such low viewership, and if the Left thinks that socialism is cool, then perhaps they should make them a compulsory viewing. Like attendance at 1st May parades in the communist era... #RealNews #TuesdayThoughts #ElectionDay
971031520898150400 2018-03-06 14:35:30 UTC <IWBorter> The ratings of the politically-laden Grammys were poor, the Last Jedi flopped (at least in terms of a Star Wars movie), the Oscars hit the all-time low, and yet the Left still refuses to see it... #TuesdayThoughts #Oscars #Oscars2018 #FoxNewshttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/business/media/oscar-ratings-low.html

970758691258621953 2018-03-05 20:31:22 UTC <IWBorter> . @PrisonPlanet No, socialism is not cool. The unmarked graves in Siberia, all across Russia, and even in my native Poland can attest to that. But it is quite ironic that, after all these years, Russia has become right-wing while the USA leans to the left.

970729219776045058 2018-03-05 18:34:15 UTC <IWBorter> There is no merit in the Oscars anymore. Merit is the new no-no word for the Left. The M-word. #Oscars #Oscars2018 #MondayMotivation
970675446089121792 2018-03-05 15:00:35 UTC <IWBorter> Oscar galas turn into a kind of annual sect meetings, playing before an increasingly empty audience. Viewership ratings only confirm that. They have learned nothing from the #Grammys2018 #Oscars #Oscars18 #MondayMotivatonhttps://www.thewrap.com/oscars-ratings-tank-16-percent-last-year-jimmy-kimmel/
970650845179236352 2018-03-05 13:22:49 UTC <IWBorter> Hollywood elites hate the conservatives in power so much that they would give an Oscar to a movie about someone humping a toaster only to spite them. #Oscars #MondayMotivation #InclusionRider #ShapeOfWater
970649874365599744 2018-03-05 13:18:58 UTC <IWBorter> The Shape of Water is an ultimate proof that Hollywood's Left is so afraid of offending anyone with anything that they had to retreat to the sphere of fantasy in order to avoid tackling any real and difficult subjects. #Oscars #MondayMotivation #ShapeOfWater #InclusionRider
970647826949640194 2018-03-05 13:10:50 UTC <IWBorter> Has Hollywood's Left totally succumbed to senility that they give serious awards to fairytales? Have they reached their second childhood too quickly? What is next? Nobel prize in literature for a bumper sticker #Resistance? #Oscars #ShapeOfWater #InclusionRider #MondayMotivation
970645199633440768 2018-03-05 13:00:23 UTC <IWBorter> The amazing thing is that the Left is constantly found guilty of something (after all Hollywood is the world's capital of sexual abuse), and yet they still have the nerve to lecture everyone on morality and tolerance #Oscars #MondayMotivation #TheShapeofWater #InclusionRider

969934643138097152 2018-03-03 13:56:54 UTC <IWBorter> Now is a good moment for the reboot of "All in the Family", but this time with the Left's bigotry exposed and poked fun at. #SaturdayMorning #SaturdayMotivation
966745272633217025 2018-02-22 18:43:28 UTC <IWBorter> Reading the suburban novels of Cheever and Updike is like reading Evelyn Waugh or Kingsley Amis, minus the 5 o'clock tea. That means no more depth than in a glass of whiskey. #ThursdayThoughts #writing #NationalMargaritaDay

962700115218698245 2018-02-11 14:49:28 UTC <IWBorter> It seems that the good old argument that a work of art should be a wholesome and morally enriching experience is back. As harmful as ever. #SundayMorninghttps://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/art-should-not-have-to-bow-down-to-political-correctness-1.3376733
962655310518407168 2018-02-11 11:51:25 UTC <IWBorter> What also amazes me is that such institutions are all fidgety and overzealous in their responding to the slightest objections coming from the vocal, but also small offended groups, without waiting for the voice of the silent majority. #PoliticalCorrectnesshttps://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/31/manchester-art-gallery-removes-waterhouse-naked-nymphs-painting-prompt-conversation?CMP=share_btn_tw
962645639061438464 2018-02-11 11:13:00 UTC <IWBorter> . @StigAbell The most striking thing about it is that what Victorians found to be perfectly acceptable, now seems like a good reason to build stakes and call Inquisition meetings. Have we backtracked too many steps too quickly? #PoliticalCorrectness #SundayMorninghttps://twitter.com/StigAbell/status/959085386780864513
958779637328416768 2018-01-31 19:10:53 UTC <IWBorter> . @SethAbramson Metamodernism should be declared DOA. Perhaps it had its brief moment on the eve of the new century (Jonathan Franzen, Zadie Smith), yet now it's not only recently deceased but already stone cold. #WednesdayWisdom

958476218478878726 2018-01-30 23:05:12 UTC <IWBorter> A little afterthought on Rebel Without a Cause: It plays as if its creators really wanted to make a movie about troubled youth, but had to play it safe. So they made a few concessions: every hoodlum comes from a loving family, wears a tie (hopefully not to bed), and never swears!
958468188857135106 2018-01-30 22:33:18 UTC <IWBorter> A movie night: Rebel Without a Cause (1955).  I've never understood Dean's appeal, but apart from that the movie still holds up pretty well.https://youtu.be/AnQ5CPEMjPI
958382461980946432 2018-01-30 16:52:39 UTC <IWBorter> . @SethAbramson How do the genuineness and the sincerity of metamodernism hold up in the age of fake news and alternative facts? We are more postmodernically cynical now than ever. #TuesdayThoughts
