956933150541860864 2018-01-26 16:53:36 UTC <patreiss> @MarkRocon @jeepsuzih2 @hotforstevem I was looking for someone to do yard work, gardening, etc. Paying $20/HR. -- no takers
955929937382342656 2018-01-23 22:27:12 UTC <patreiss> @TheLeeGreenwood @TonyPaulVFL Absolutely beautiful 
955459501813051393 2018-01-22 15:17:51 UTC <patreiss> @radmadmid @MarkSimoneNY As a woman I find this utterly depraved and disgusting. I am sure millions of women find it equally revolting.

951076763576209408 2018-01-10 13:02:25 UTC <patreiss> @freep what happened to the LA Times puzzle today? My favorite part of the paper.
949426760646647809 2018-01-05 23:45:53 UTC <patreiss> @GlenWoodfin After reading this synopsis of Friday's show, it only reinforces why I haven't watched for years!!
948698194342531072 2018-01-03 23:30:50 UTC <patreiss> @hotfunkytown @MaryPharaoh I certainly won't be going to their new movie, or any of their movies again!!

938849770554175488 2017-12-07 19:16:42 UTC <patreiss> @Jim_Jordan You rocked at the hearing today. Didn't wast any of your allowed time, got to the crux of the matter. Thank you!!
938572340866244608 2017-12-06 00:54:18 UTC <patreiss> @TigerWoods @PGATOUR @elenaj710 It is worth noting that his fellow players were also very excited that not only was he playing, but also making some fabulous shots.
938571901861064704 2017-12-06 00:52:33 UTC <patreiss> @GolfChannel @TigerWoods @PGATOUR @StephenGiddens1 I loved watching his best tournaments. 
937391836875849728 2017-12-03 18:43:24 UTC <patreiss> @MediaJuggernaut Hey @ABCNetwork it is time to fire Joy. She is a disgrace!
937113126146801669 2017-12-02 00:15:54 UTC <patreiss> @ABC @_Trump45_ I agree! Joy Behar's behavior was so unprofessional, she should at the very least be suspended without pay.

864974592112308224 2017-05-17 22:43:07 UTC <patreiss> @Conservatexian I live in MI, he had better be careful. Western Michigan is bigly pro Trump. This could come back to bite him.

857954311342632960 2017-04-28 13:47:02 UTC <patreiss> @brianstelter @iamdeeza2 The hypocrisy of the MSM continues to astound me.

830252437474799616 2017-02-10 03:09:41 UTC <patreiss> @HuntedFans I'm always surprised that they usually help the hunters --  a lot.
830240430126149632 2017-02-10 02:21:58 UTC <patreiss> @BIZPACReview @ShepNewsTeam @nendaas1 @FoxNews I agree that Shep had got to go. His bias toward our President cannot be tolerated.

829527943315591168 2017-02-08 03:10:48 UTC <patreiss> Wow!! What a beginning to #CodeBlack  I nearly jumped out of my chair! Scary!!
828968142789603328 2017-02-07 14:06:21 UTC <patreiss> @WayneDupreeShow It is unbelievable, but nothing will be done by the authorities.

828368398618914816 2017-02-05 22:23:11 UTC <patreiss> @DineshDSouza I didn't believe the polls during the campaign. I certainly don't believe them now!!
828306537160523776 2017-02-05 18:17:22 UTC <patreiss> @autismfriendlyz @Lrihendry I'm boycotting!!

827592927635464193 2017-02-03 19:01:44 UTC <patreiss> @HuntedCBS Cash is better, of course. But have a stash on hand so you don't waste time and the risk of stopping at an ATM!
827227973241692160 2017-02-02 18:51:32 UTC <patreiss> Love the Spectra storyline #BoldandBeautiful Just what the show needed!
827188146521640960 2017-02-02 16:13:17 UTC <patreiss> @NewDay Nobody cares what he says.
827001319894433793 2017-02-01 03:50:54 UTC <patreiss> @CodeBlackWriter @CodeBlackCBS I also think it looks very bad for Heather.
826997991605145600 2017-02-01 03:37:40 UTC <patreiss> @ABC This is why no one believes anything you say.

826996755652812800 2017-02-01 03:32:46 UTC <patreiss> @joelpollak @LindaSuhler That's why no one believes the MSM.

826968036028608514 2017-02-01 01:38:38 UTC <patreiss> @CorticeMiles No, don't turn them in--there "may" be a reward.
826965113685028864 2017-02-01 01:27:02 UTC <patreiss> I'm convinced that if one is on the run do not make a call! #hunted

811185055599095808 2016-12-20 12:22:43 UTC <patreiss> @TrumpInaugural @realDonaldTrump @brunelldonald Congrats on your new position. I've been following you --you are so inspirational.
810899954109677568 2016-12-19 17:29:49 UTC <patreiss> @mitchellvii Thanks, Bill!
810685765525110784 2016-12-18 03:18:42 UTC <patreiss> @ABC He makes sense.
810255213798027265 2016-12-17 22:47:51 UTC <patreiss> @Stonewall_77 @jim_milewski My children attended Catholic school. When my daughter was in Kindergarten she told me first we pray to God, then we pray to the flag!
810234624278429696 2016-12-17 21:26:02 UTC <patreiss> @Stonewall_77 @jim_milewski You could never get away with singing that song in public school today.

808800724377276420 2016-12-13 22:28:14 UTC <patreiss> @soapsindepthabc I like the Franco/ Liz part of the story. However keeping a man in a dog cage with an electric collar is very disturbing.
808761322808561667 2016-12-13 19:51:40 UTC <patreiss> @CBS @NCIS_CBS Can't wait! It's going to be great.

804780755419336704 2016-12-02 20:14:18 UTC <patreiss> @DailySignal @LindaSuhler Yes
803650681718575104 2016-11-29 17:23:48 UTC <patreiss> @DrJillStein Sounds about right. The state shouldn't have to charge taxpayers for something demanded by her.
