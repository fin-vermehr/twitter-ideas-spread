931672805506256898 2017-11-17 23:58:01 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @JGB331 @NASCAR_RealTime We wasn't talking attendance but I would think think still economic reasons on that. I think tracks put in to many seats during the boom that now makes it look less full. You still get just as many if not more as other sports.
931666535684411392 2017-11-17 23:33:06 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @JGB331 @NASCAR_RealTime I think it's not just NASCAR that has lower ratings because of the newer ways to follow or keep up with sports. The leagues/teams played themselves getting crazy with driver/players salaries that have got them in this situation.
931661669293613056 2017-11-17 23:13:46 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @JGB331 @NASCAR_RealTime Sure don't but they could be following in other means these days. The younger crowd don't have the attention span us older ones do.

930905123336880128 2017-11-15 21:07:31 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @Born_Readdy To funny. I actually picked out Ds name before I met the mother to be also. Yeah
930859155631591433 2017-11-15 18:04:51 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @JohnMichaels929 you so bias against FSU. It's not funny.
930633311457894400 2017-11-14 03:07:26 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @SertainZachary Oh I've paid attention to all and I wholeheartedly disagree.
930621578475376640 2017-11-14 02:20:49 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @SertainZachary Ehh.. he is silent. I get donations. I get other country. But give me a break. It's jus appealing to the left by the mag. All magazines are failing now.
930612800858271745 2017-11-14 01:45:56 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @AlexTruax1 Jus signed so 4/5
930612159201054721 2017-11-14 01:43:23 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @AlexTruax1 He will probably finish out contract. But won't sign another

930599715460341761 2017-11-14 00:53:56 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @AlexTruax1 Ehh.. I'm straight Ford. Nuff said without down talking others. Really wish I cld be in NASCAR but not at moment
930594544411922432 2017-11-14 00:33:23 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @AlexTruax1 I am in daily life. But not so much in NASCAR these days. I like Ricky.
930586527532552192 2017-11-14 00:01:32 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @AlexTruax1 Yeah they doin alright. Long ways to go tho.
930586443138916352 2017-11-14 00:01:12 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @AlexTruax1 I'm def I guy! Maybe once he retires I can move to a upcoming Ford guy. I'm Ford in my everyday drivers. Blaney only Ford guy I like.
930584854634401792 2017-11-14 23:54:53 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @AlexTruax1 It was equipment really. Not the drivers. That's why Carl and Matt left.
930584669762084865 2017-11-14 23:54:09 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @AlexTruax1 Lol... I let go of manufacturer deal back when Rusty started switching. Realized can't control where my fav goes. It's to much like pro free agency these days.
930583664261509120 2017-11-14 23:50:09 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @AlexTruax1 Def like matt. Always have. Never been my guy but never anything against
930581120269406210 2017-11-14 23:40:03 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @AlexTruax1 I'm sure you picked up what I was putting down.
930559401827733505 2017-11-14 22:13:45 UTC <ShaneSimp111> It's so funny how fans boo a winner and cheer for a non-winner #Baffling
930264027871182848 2017-11-13 02:40:02 UTC <ShaneSimp111> The left is nothing but shit stirring clueless idiots that prey on the weak minded.

915272736947232768 2017-10-03 17:50:00 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @SertainZachary Interesting. But on guns. Tighter laws won't keep it out of evil ppls hands. Drugs are not legal but easy to find for those that want them.

894316387174371328 2017-08-06 21:56:56 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @AU_Tyler41 Yeah Matt might be next Biff. No good ride option.
894316248753950721 2017-08-06 21:56:23 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @AU_Tyler41 But they hv 5 hour that can not switch teams.. that might be tricky part.
894315645004853248 2017-08-06 21:54:00 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @AU_Tyler41 Oh I agree but switchin to yota was huge for FRR.
894315054044262401 2017-08-06 21:51:39 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @AU_Tyler41 Agreed. I think he will be back in 41 but we will see. 77 a great car tho to hop in
894314836091437061 2017-08-06 21:50:47 UTC <ShaneSimp111> Great job on broadcast @NBCSN #NASCAR
894314296997445632 2017-08-06 21:48:38 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @AU_Tyler41 I'd like to see him in 77.. wld be strong

891743021695475713 2017-07-30 19:31:18 UTC <ShaneSimp111> Why not red flag??
891742533050609665 2017-07-30 19:29:22 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @rickbanks2003 @NickLaBrecque Make that 2 of us

891741833889501184 2017-07-30 19:26:35 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @rickbanks2003 @NickLaBrecque Think after quals. You pick 1 driver a week and only once a season.
891740206373752832 2017-07-30 19:20:07 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @NickLaBrecque @rickbanks2003 Ahh. Nice break down

891736757875736576 2017-07-30 19:06:25 UTC <ShaneSimp111> I heard one time that they do that to time the fly over. Not sure jus what Ive heard.
891724927526633478 2017-07-30 18:19:24 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @Noles_Titans_11 True statement
891724182630928384 2017-07-30 18:16:27 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @Noles_Titans_11 The big to do is it's two different teams. Makes it smell bad even though the members work for Gibbs
891723384886878208 2017-07-30 18:13:17 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @Noles_Titans_11 I honestly don't think anyone shldve been suspended..

891411314354118656 2017-07-29 21:33:13 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @FutureRacer11 I jus don't hv the time to waste to complain and bitch. No one is go like everything that happens. That's life period.

890750760174194697 2017-07-27 01:48:25 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @bobpockrass Why is it like this? What's reason behind it?
890749269682073601 2017-07-27 01:42:29 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @bobpockrass That's just stupid.
890735837780037633 2017-07-27 00:49:07 UTC <ShaneSimp111> Yeah I like that one myself. All mine are signed elites except DH 500. Its elite jus not signed, yet.
890735138199531520 2017-07-27 00:46:20 UTC <ShaneSimp111> Yeah well damn. Idk then.. but for sure need to grab a diecast soon. Got my first truck coming soon.

890733935239593984 2017-07-27 00:41:33 UTC <ShaneSimp111> Then who am I thinkin of... believe a American in Penske car.
890733604426457091 2017-07-27 00:40:14 UTC <ShaneSimp111> Hunter-Reay or Andretti probably but I been paying attention to Newgarden too. Think his rookie year. Cld be wrong
890732926685544449 2017-07-27 00:37:33 UTC <ShaneSimp111> I'm thinkin I'd hv to go with American driver. Nothing against anyone. Jus sayin
890732501198667776 2017-07-27 00:35:51 UTC <ShaneSimp111> True. Not sure who'd I get. I don't follow it. I watch it now and again.
890732147908235265 2017-07-27 00:34:27 UTC <ShaneSimp111> That's sweet. I need a Indy car in my collection jus bc.
890729400844636160 2017-07-27 00:23:32 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @T1TheEmC @Noles_Titans_11 I believe there was a vid of it.. it was shirt

890703635927138304 2017-07-27 22:41:09 UTC <ShaneSimp111> Man ppl jus sometimes don't really understand. A internal matter, you fix internal.

888969362689937408 2017-07-22 03:49:46 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @KelseyyM_ Hellz hell! Get it girl!
888879849556893696 2017-07-22 21:54:05 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @CVN74BLE I agree with that.
888879641196408833 2017-07-22 21:53:15 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @CVN74BLE I didn't buy a ticket so I don't comment on the stands.
888879435092549633 2017-07-22 21:52:26 UTC <ShaneSimp111> This package is on point! Can we get it in cup tomo?!?!
888879224551071744 2017-07-22 21:51:36 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @CVN74BLE I totally agree with that after watching this race.
888879113821356033 2017-07-22 21:51:09 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @CVN74BLE I have nothing against KB. But I don't like Xfinity guys not being able to get locked in with wins.
888871150167707648 2017-07-22 21:19:31 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @CVN74BLE Yeah me too! With the playoff system I don't think they shld be running anymore.
888853725451833345 2017-07-22 20:10:16 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @KelseyyM_ My opinion on the attendance crap is those same ppl complaining cldve bout a damn ticket themselves but didn't. So why bitch?!
888579570772959232 2017-07-21 02:00:53 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @SpotterBrett Which is why I don't watch ESPN shows anymore

888221393778872321 2017-07-20 02:17:37 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @pookiechuck Agreed! Hope he gets a ride.. maybe 77.. never know.

888219159242436608 2017-07-20 02:08:44 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @pookiechuck you was right! Number 9 was great! Those 12 questions hv been on point all season.
888194405945020417 2017-07-20 00:30:22 UTC <ShaneSimp111> I've had ole Jeffery in my fantasy line up for about 2 months now.. always finishes better than starts.

887847387720552448 2017-07-19 01:31:27 UTC <ShaneSimp111> The days into the 50s are over.. for the big name ones anyway.
887846673212469248 2017-07-19 01:28:36 UTC <ShaneSimp111> It's because they make so much more money these days.

887499855903559680 2017-07-18 02:30:29 UTC <ShaneSimp111> I see no issue with Jr running his own scheme. It started his career and it will be run to end his career. Pretty BA!
887088280986169346 2017-07-17 23:15:02 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @Noledad77 Yeah I agree. I jus said thanks for service and God speed. A few more words but you get point.

886304904712683520 2017-07-15 19:22:10 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @cc49ers You never know who will win any race. So many things can happen to take anyone out.
886304069941329925 2017-07-15 19:18:51 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @cc49ers Exactly! I don't get the complaining. The drivers themselves say they like it so that's what matters.
886302782042632192 2017-07-15 19:13:44 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @cc49ers A real race fan watches regardless who's in it or not.

878787112866394112 2017-06-24 01:29:09 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @NASCAR put @iowaspeedway on cup schedule please and now!
878775748110290944 2017-06-24 00:43:59 UTC <ShaneSimp111> Let's go Racin!!
878769607099731971 2017-06-24 00:19:35 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @donnafranger @CavanaghSju @Will_JGR_18 Agreed! Not a equal deal to me.
878767137908813824 2017-06-24 00:09:47 UTC <ShaneSimp111> Exactly.. Mark Martin.
878766693442617344 2017-06-24 00:08:01 UTC <ShaneSimp111> I don't like them running lower now bc the hv the playoffs now and cup guys take away locks from makin playoffs now.. that's my only issue.
878766414357725184 2017-06-24 00:06:54 UTC <ShaneSimp111> It is. Daniel go be a good one. I'm not a KB fan. Imma Hamlin fan. I jus hate the bias BS.
878765682397204480 2017-06-24 00:04:00 UTC <ShaneSimp111> This year they are limited to I believe 10. So that's good. But young guys love racin them bc they learn from them.
878764882220417024 2017-06-24 00:00:49 UTC <ShaneSimp111> Agreed. I hv no issue with it. My main point was ppl bitchin bout cup guys running lower Series. But only hear cries when it's KB.
878764123340910594 2017-06-24 23:57:48 UTC <ShaneSimp111> Sorry disagree. IMO KB runs bc he wants to Race. I hv no issue with KH running but think it was for practice not attention.
878755352887668737 2017-06-24 23:22:57 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @KevinHarvick @tomjensen100 Really? You may be correct. I think it was more of practice on a RC for Sunday. Either way I hv no issue with it.
878749498578698240 2017-06-24 22:59:41 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @donnafranger @CavanaghSju I agree 100 with you. Ridiculous
878747866029854720 2017-06-24 22:53:12 UTC <ShaneSimp111> So ppl cry when KB in a Xfinity or truck race but I see nothing bout KH in a K&N race.. interesting. Ppl need to get over themselves
878418907102670850 2017-06-23 01:06:02 UTC <ShaneSimp111> @Blaney @NASCAR_Trucks That's BA!
