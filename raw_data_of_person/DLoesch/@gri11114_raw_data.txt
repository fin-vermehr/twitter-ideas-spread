969069668802682880 2018-02-28 04:39:48 UTC <gri11114> @dbongino It's simple.  They merely didn't think the FBI could translate all the Russian communication.

969047466535542784 2018-02-28 03:11:34 UTC <gri11114> @larryelder @SebGorka @seanhannity I would take @HillaryClinton seriously!  Who knows more about the Russians than one that is bought and paid for by the Russians?
969002406863400961 2018-02-28 00:12:31 UTC <gri11114> @NYIslanders Ready to watch @CGibber37 play and get more shutouts.
967958340541337601 2018-02-25 03:03:46 UTC <gri11114> @JohnnyArgent @therealroseanne I for one can't wait!!!  Thank you for bringing back some good laughs!  Always been my favorite and still watch the Rosanne Marathons every weekend!
966888674116878336 2018-02-22 04:13:18 UTC <gri11114> Great seeing you in that uniform @CGibber37 well deserved!!!pic.twitter.com/Ojj3ogghST

960289371126685696 2018-02-04 23:10:02 UTC <gri11114> @ufc Come on @TWooodley the only work you've been doing is commentating.  @ColbyCovMMA has been waiting for you to work for awhile now, but NOW you ready when someone asks?  LAME!!!
959948740923715585 2018-02-03 00:36:29 UTC <gri11114> @TWooodley you look awful comfortable behind the broadcast desk.  Why don't you stay there and let the men like @ColbyCovMMA handle the business of fighting.
959774742646525952 2018-02-03 13:05:05 UTC <gri11114> @SebGorka @Jim_Jordan I think it's time for @Comey to have to come back in to answer some very tough questions!  Let's see how "creative" you can be with your own issues like you were with @HillaryClinton basement server holding all those Classified information.
959623974991859714 2018-02-02 03:05:59 UTC <gri11114> @SebGorka I find it astonishing that people are actually making attempts to defend what happened as if it is no big deal.
959582641799548928 2018-02-02 00:21:44 UTC <gri11114> @CGibber37 @TheSoundTigers You got this Gibby!!!!
959537550485573635 2018-02-02 21:22:34 UTC <gri11114> @FoxNews Then please enlighten us on how the memo is lacking and what the facts really are there @NancyPelosi we are all waiting!
959511014596280321 2018-02-02 19:37:07 UTC <gri11114> @FoxNews Last I checked you @Comey leaked your memos to the media and now we find out you allowed this to take place under your watch.  You are the last person to speak about integrity and ethics.
959509992138256385 2018-02-02 19:33:03 UTC <gri11114> @WWE @RondaRousey @bjpenndotcom I can see that happening since the "champ" is running and nobody else seems to want to step in the ring with @ColbyCovMMA .  @danawhite you have a caged animal that needs to be released and soon!
959502237587464193 2018-02-02 19:02:14 UTC <gri11114> @ufc @danawhite I believe if @TWooodley is lame and can't defend his title then it's time for an interim.  We want to see @ColbyCovMMA destroy someone, anyone sometime soon.  Everyone seems to be running scared.
958164975209664512 2018-01-29 02:28:26 UTC <gri11114> @CGibber37 @TheSoundTigers Just awesome!!  Congrats Chris!

957967421901561856 2018-01-29 13:23:26 UTC <gri11114> @GenRobertNeller Semper Fidelis sir!!  Yut
957654256579940354 2018-01-28 16:39:01 UTC <gri11114> @CNN @POTUS @AreuCathy @FoxNews The power of his words?  It is a simple fix that is totally up to you.  Try reporting accurate news for once and he wouldn't have to defend himself.  Just saying.
957607178269020160 2018-01-28 13:31:57 UTC <gri11114> @FoxNews So much for "Equal Justice Under Law"

956588768055742465 2018-01-25 18:05:09 UTC <gri11114> @FoxNews @JohnKerry has always been a traitor to the United States.  This shouldn't surprise anyone!
956376179342237697 2018-01-24 04:00:24 UTC <gri11114> @TheSoundTigers Congratulations @CGibber37 you have made an outstanding recovery and all your hard work is paying off!  @NHL needs to take note because you will be there soon!
956278403405139969 2018-01-24 21:31:52 UTC <gri11114> @FBI @FoxNews Really???  Nice cover-up story!
955976768053227521 2018-01-23 01:33:17 UTC <gri11114> @FBI @JesseBWatters @FoxNews Missing @HillaryClinton emails and now missing test messages?  Looks like a pattern!  Incompetence or complicity!!!
955974502051209216 2018-01-23 01:24:17 UTC <gri11114> @TomiLahren It's sad to see what our country has become!  But they surely will play all the ads that promote alcoholism and sexism.  I am proud to say that this was my 2nd season without watching 1 @NFL game and I don't feel like I missed anything.
955895722037129216 2018-01-23 20:11:14 UTC <gri11114> @reneingoglia We are hiring!!!
955467275464855554 2018-01-22 15:48:44 UTC <gri11114> @TomiLahren This shows one of two things, incompetence or complicity on the part of Mueller and @FBI .  Question is,  which one?  Either option is unacceptable!
953655333725097984 2018-01-17 15:48:44 UTC <gri11114> @JeffFlake @FoxNews You are correct.  The regularity of untruth coming from the bias media should be a cause for alarm!  That is exactly what @realDonaldTrump has been saying and proving all along!
953386387679666176 2018-01-16 22:00:02 UTC <gri11114> @PlatinumPerry You have more heart than most in the sport.  Most just talk the talk but you walk the walk!  You just this bro!

950485638041698306 2018-01-08 21:53:29 UTC <gri11114> @AmwayCenter @PlatinumPerry I'm really looking forward to this one!!!
949653614880059393 2018-01-06 14:47:20 UTC <gri11114> @NYIslanders Those sure aren't the type of motivating comments I expect to hear from a coach!  In fact that is the last thing I would expect to hear.  I think that is your problem.  Might I suggest reading the book, "Warrior Ethos" by @stevenpressfield for some direction.
949062824613044229 2018-01-04 23:39:44 UTC <gri11114> @ka_robo @netz_melb @GribbM There should be outrage over this!!!
948406330334859264 2018-01-02 04:11:04 UTC <gri11114> @NYIslanders Sounds like @CGibber37 might just be the answer!!!  He's hungry and has worked hard.  Give him a shot!
947951331825848325 2018-01-01 22:03:04 UTC <gri11114> @PlatinumPerry Do you think you'll be smashing someone's face in when the @ufc comes to Orlando?
947848441107025921 2018-01-01 15:14:13 UTC <gri11114> @PlatinumPerry Happy New Year Mike!  I wish you many battles and kick ass wins in 2018!  Proud that you represent Central Florida in the manner you do!  Much respect bro!

901645638194094080 2017-08-26 03:20:46 UTC <gri11114> Boxing is boring compared to MMA!  I would rather watch old @ufc fights any day.  Just saying

900203030452338695 2017-08-22 03:48:22 UTC <gri11114> @danawhite @ufc I'm surprised that you are surprised!  @JonnyBones has a past that he just can't seem to escape.  Need to find a new $ maker!
900125908698320898 2017-08-22 22:41:54 UTC <gri11114> @FoxNews Well @NFL it looks like your ratings are going down the drain again this year.  As a veteran, I am sickened.  Thank God for College Football
900123407689420800 2017-08-22 22:31:58 UTC <gri11114> @TomiLahren What is the @NFL going to do?  1 side boycotting due to sitting for our Anthem and the other boycotting for not signing the one to start it.

891679578586042368 2017-07-30 15:19:12 UTC <gri11114> @MMA_Tello With all the hype and hate on this one I expected fireworks .  Just as boring as the Woodley fight.

883515886015045633 2017-07-07 02:39:36 UTC <gri11114> @NYCMayor @FoxNews So he purposely turns his back on one of his own police officers who was murdered to go protest?  Who paid for his trip over to Germany???

883157493450407937 2017-07-06 02:55:29 UTC <gri11114> @FoxNews Sounds like a terrorists threat to me.  What say you @usss ?  This needs to be taken seriously!
883021956034985985 2017-07-06 17:56:54 UTC <gri11114> @FoxNews Hey @CNN I'll come out and admit I made the video.  Hahaha. If I were that poor kid you were threatening I would be proud to say I made it.
882093402640273408 2017-07-03 04:27:10 UTC <gri11114> @KristinBTate @FoxNews Since the @DNC  loves #Obamacare so much let them keep it and OWN the backlash from those it hurts.
882072931307859968 2017-07-03 03:05:49 UTC <gri11114> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews But it's ok to think when too many people on Guam it will cause it to tip over?  @DNC is the biggest joke of our recent history.
881720971278921728 2017-07-02 03:47:15 UTC <gri11114> @brianstelter @jlgolson @ToniMacik So you are ok with the video of his head being cut off though right??
881720712666468352 2017-07-02 03:46:14 UTC <gri11114> @brianstelter You call this hate?  What about videos of an actress cutting his off?
881363435275120640 2017-07-01 04:06:32 UTC <gri11114> Hey @CGibber37 I just wanted to check in with you and see how the recovery was going?  Will we get to see you on the ice soon.  Best wishes!

875457347723853824 2017-06-15 20:57:51 UTC <gri11114> @nytimes @larryelder There needs to be something done to hold the media accountable for what they report.  They are free to say whatever they want to regardless.

875094931618115584 2017-06-14 20:57:44 UTC <gri11114> @RepJackBergman @FoxNews Time to start holding the media accountable for their wreckless use of the platform they have.  Report facts, true facts!!

872057915682816000 2017-06-06 11:49:43 UTC <gri11114> @MMA_Tello Hahaha did I get you going this morning or what?
872056716233519104 2017-06-06 11:44:57 UTC <gri11114> @MMA_Tello Well that might be his only way to get his message out since the media seems to be a bit bias when it comes to him.
872056093064744962 2017-06-06 11:42:29 UTC <gri11114> @MMA_Tello It takes time to unf*$@ what the King did!
872055364442828800 2017-06-06 11:39:35 UTC <gri11114> @MMA_Tello Cause he is awesome!!!!  :)
871887882918793216 2017-06-05 00:34:04 UTC <gri11114> My Luna loves watching some hockey!  She says go @penguinspic.twitter.com/CKgN1zMYSY
871853035714203648 2017-06-05 22:15:36 UTC <gri11114> @MyDaughtersArmy Truth hurts huh?  Maybe if the right spoke of Obama like the left does about Trump maybe the libs might be appalled!  Don't be alarmed!
871852076002938881 2017-06-05 22:11:47 UTC <gri11114> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I love when @SarahHuckabee is up there speaking!!!  No nonsense to the point information AND puts the bias media in their place!  More pls!!
871527293423951872 2017-06-04 00:41:13 UTC <gri11114> @POTUS @AmbassadorRice @FoxNews That's funny because that is exactly how you and the libs are treating the Conseratives.  But I expect nothing less from the left.
871476182361022467 2017-06-04 21:18:07 UTC <gri11114> @AmbassadorRice @FoxNews Also no evidence it wouldn't.  Better safe than sorry.  By the way, you are no longer revelent and you have been a proven liar.
871381021857636352 2017-06-04 14:59:59 UTC <gri11114> @rezaaslan No people like you who constantly attack and disrespect our President is the embarrassment!  Sore losers the entire lot of you.
870958996634705921 2017-06-03 11:03:01 UTC <gri11114> @kathygriffin @larryelder I think she meant mentally broke her.  Not sure if that was possible since she clearly had issues before all of this.
870742728828751873 2017-06-02 20:43:38 UTC <gri11114> @POTUS @kathygriffin @FoxNews Just when you thought you did something horrible you make it worse by blaming your actions on others instead of yourself.  Disgusting!
870714607492628484 2017-06-02 18:51:54 UTC <gri11114> @realDonaldTrump @kathygriffin @FoxNews My heart pumps piss for you!!!  Reap what you sow now and stop crying foul.  You are only the victim of your own stupidity!
870692306201960453 2017-06-02 17:23:17 UTC <gri11114> @kathygriffin @FoxNews Oh. Now you are the victim?????  You must be mentally unstable if you can accept the new @POTUS
869716817761234944 2017-05-30 00:47:02 UTC <gri11114> @POTUS @kathygriffin @FoxNews Enjoy!  Reap what you sow!  I bet it isn't funny anymore!
869715109165379587 2017-05-30 00:40:15 UTC <gri11114> @POTUS @kathygriffin @FoxNews No, you thought it was funny!  Therefore I for one don't believe your apology is sincere.  You are only doing this because it back fired!!!
869288570753871873 2017-05-29 20:25:20 UTC <gri11114> @TomiLahren Semper Fidelis and God speed!

868489016005586944 2017-05-27 15:28:11 UTC <gri11114> @FoxNews @HillaryClinton you just described the entire liberal logic.  Interesting!  What difference does it make?  Happy Memorial Day, never forget!
865320174102224897 2017-05-18 21:36:21 UTC <gri11114> @ericJbaier Thank you for all the years of hockey for the @OrlandoHockey and community events you did.  Best wishes!
865035427060875265 2017-05-17 02:44:52 UTC <gri11114> @jasoninthehouse @FoxNews Until he reports the allegations are unfounded.  Then the Dems will cry foul.
864887267810258944 2017-05-17 16:56:08 UTC <gri11114> @larryelder They don't care or have any loyalty.  As long as they can take down Trump everyone else is mere collateral damage in their eyes.
864832486848815104 2017-05-17 13:18:27 UTC <gri11114> Wow!!!  Extremely disappointed in what she has become!https://twitter.com/realDailyWire/status/864784484847284228

864619985343262721 2017-05-16 23:14:03 UTC <gri11114> @POTUS @MyNews13 Comey has testified how many times before Congress?  Why was thing NEVER brought up?  @nytimes you are irresponsible and negligent news!
864618823709855744 2017-05-16 23:09:26 UTC <gri11114> @POTUS @nytimes @MyNews13 What the media has been doing is sickening and should be criminal.  So much for integrity and honest reporting.  Nobody believes the news!!!
864233762787295232 2017-05-15 21:39:20 UTC <gri11114> @TGowdySC That is why I think you would be an outstanding choice, sir!  Although, I know there is a higher calling in your future!
863516270892900352 2017-05-13 22:08:16 UTC <gri11114> @MMA_Tello I could be apart of your camp!

826261688332726273 2017-01-30 02:51:52 UTC <gri11114> @oreillyfactor @FoxNews isn't it responsible to take a step back and stop and review what the issues are and make a plan?
826260818790580224 2017-01-30 02:48:25 UTC <gri11114> @krauthammer @FoxNews so we are supposed to make it worse by continuing to allow possible terrorist into this Country?

802993984658350080 2016-11-27 21:54:19 UTC <gri11114> @DrJillStein @FoxNews recount those Electoral College votes instead of the regular votes.  It will speed up the process for you!  Hahahaha!
802993670924271617 2016-11-27 21:53:04 UTC <gri11114> @RepTimRyan @FoxNews shocking that only a few months ago the Republicans were saying the same thing.  Oh how the tables turn huh?  :)

802306629978861572 2016-11-25 00:23:01 UTC <gri11114> Please tell me it isn't true @OrlandoHockey we love our @johnnymcinnis this will make a bunch of fans upset!
802281644635881472 2016-11-25 22:43:44 UTC <gri11114> @HadleyHeath @FoxNews it's interesting why you didn't have the same conclusion when Obama was elected.  Why is that?

742756760029659136 2016-06-14 16:33:06 UTC <gri11114> @GovJVentura I am so happy to see your lawsuit and money awarded had been rejusted.  I believe @ChrisKyleFrog knocked you out and now again!
742729840412008449 2016-06-14 14:46:07 UTC <gri11114> @HillaryClinton never in a million years!  Take me off your send list.  No spam wanted from a liar!
742190430385635328 2016-06-12 03:02:42 UTC <gri11114> Congrats @penguins on a well fought battle and win of the 2016 Stanley Cup!  What to do, now that hockey is over for the season?  :(
742164953176494080 2016-06-12 01:21:28 UTC <gri11114> @realDonaldTrump when we have a @POTUS call these evil people "JV" and then invite them to our Country without question is the problem!
742135783578992640 2016-06-12 23:25:33 UTC <gri11114> @NYIslanders thank you for your support!  It's an honor to know so many people care.  Your fan from Orlando.

737400247874293761 2016-05-30 21:48:13 UTC <gri11114> @espn real class act!  Let's see how you handle this.  Others have been fired for much less.  Where are your values?https://twitter.com/hjstaples189/status/737261475216150528
737305995743924225 2016-05-30 15:33:42 UTC <gri11114> @FoxNews @MMA_Tello sure it had nothing to do with a dictator killing large numbers of innocent people.  And now ISIS who want us all dead.

733125004305502209 2016-05-18 02:39:56 UTC <gri11114> @MMA_Tello I'm still waiting for someone to confirm your boy JJ was the driver of that hit and run that killed the other mma fighter!
733124399189131264 2016-05-18 02:37:32 UTC <gri11114> @MMA_Tello "and chump" is what I'm thinking.  As far as I am concerned @JonnyBones can suck it!

728912679235018752 2016-05-07 11:41:39 UTC <gri11114> @MMA_Tello @ufc nothing but bones, that is all that will be left on the mat when @dc_mma gets done with him!
724784133168324608 2016-04-25 02:16:17 UTC <gri11114> @JonnyBones PLEASE!  All the hype you were talking about being better, that fight shouldn't have made it to the 5th round.  @dc_mma all day!
724220120684355584 2016-04-24 12:55:06 UTC <gri11114> @BrianStann I am still waiting for you @JonnyBones to grow up.  I can only imagine what you were doing at your after party!
724214513004732417 2016-04-24 12:32:49 UTC <gri11114> @MMA_Tello @dc_mma after what I saw last night Jones is very lucky he wasn't facing @dc_mma .  If that was his best look out!
723952569182117888 2016-04-23 19:11:57 UTC <gri11114> @MMA_Tello @dc_mma it boils down to the fact I refuse to root for someone like Jones.  He is not a man!  @dc_mma has my support!
723238673148420097 2016-04-21 19:55:11 UTC <gri11114> @MMA_Tello @dc_mma pfft.  Jones' jaw hasn't been tested yet.  We all know it only takes 1 pop from @dc_mma to knock anyone to sleep!
723186135179112452 2016-04-21 16:26:25 UTC <gri11114> @MMA_Tello @dc_mma we will see fella.  Jones is a mess!
722190150889902084 2016-04-18 22:28:44 UTC <gri11114> @dc_mma oh be prepared.  Dummy is going to run his jibs after the fight.  He is a joke!  All you can do is laugh out loud!
722187317813719040 2016-04-18 22:17:28 UTC <gri11114> @dc_mma hope recovery is going well DC!  Focus on healing so you can wreck that jokers face for me!  You promised!  ;)
721764203694940160 2016-04-17 18:16:10 UTC <gri11114> @CGibber37 enjoy the ride brother!  You made it!  Hope you get to play some in the post season!  We are all proud of you here in Orlando!
719373321494786050 2016-04-10 03:55:39 UTC <gri11114> @CGibber37 sorry for the late shout out but my phone died.  It's great seeing you in the spotlight.  Keep up the hard work!  Your #1 fan!
717783544643198977 2016-04-06 18:38:27 UTC <gri11114> @NYIslanders I know I have asked on several occasions for you to call up @CGibber37 .  Thank you for giving him the opportunity!  Great job!
717735047319724032 2016-04-06 15:25:44 UTC <gri11114> @CGibber37 AWESOME job last night brother!  Love seeing you in the net in the NHL.  Things are happening for you!  We'll deserved!
717172162952495104 2016-04-04 02:09:02 UTC <gri11114> @dc_mma @JonnyBones DC don't lower yourself to the childish level of Jon and his minions!  You dont need to explain anything.Speedy recovery
717142979723526144 2016-04-04 00:13:04 UTC <gri11114> @JonnyBones lol, are you sober bro?
716314450077163524 2016-04-02 17:20:48 UTC <gri11114> @JonnyBones just try to stay out of trouble so you can make it to the fight.  @dc_mma promised me a punch to your mouth!
714851532420857856 2016-03-29 16:27:41 UTC <gri11114> @dc_mma after seeing the lastest incident with @JonnyBones it is clear he hasn't changed 1 bit.  DC please shut this fool up for good!
709134238210072576 2016-03-13 21:49:12 UTC <gri11114> @TheAHL @TheSoundTigers this is why @CGibber37 is so well liked!  My all time favorite goalie!
708023191416020993 2016-03-10 20:14:17 UTC <gri11114> @NYIslanders does there happen to be any Christopher Gibson jerseys around that I might be able to get my hands on?
706644528267194368 2016-03-06 00:55:59 UTC <gri11114> @TheNotoriousMMA you beat the snot out of Diaz.  He got a lucky shot in.  There's always a chance of that.  You are still CHAMP!
703412725637058560 2016-02-26 02:53:57 UTC <gri11114> Heard awesome news tonight!  @ISlater14 is coming back to Orlando for a celebrity game with the @OrlandoHockey BEST NEWS ALL YEAR!
702253986288631809 2016-02-23 22:09:32 UTC <gri11114> @BrianStann @TheNotoriousMMA I find it interesting how everyone scheduled to fight Conor ends up injured and can't fight!  Be afraid!  Lol
701199816962002944 2016-02-20 00:20:38 UTC <gri11114> @OrlandoHockey Cool jerseys but I have to admit I am a little disappointed by the lack of law enforcement representation.
696160205307043844 2016-02-06 02:35:01 UTC <gri11114> @johnnymcinnis I think after tonight I am going to call you Johnnie Hammer Sticks!  Listen for me!
693670159375077376 2016-01-30 05:40:28 UTC <gri11114> @BrianStann Semper Fi sir!  That is all.  Be safe
