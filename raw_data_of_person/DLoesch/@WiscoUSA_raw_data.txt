971036679078400003 2018-03-06 14:55:59 UTC <WiscoUSA> @realDailyWire I suspect an irrelevant Trump campaign staffer who has an alcohol problem and was invited on liberal cable news shows with green rooms filled with free alcohol? Political entrapment?
970660403352145925 2018-03-05 14:00:48 UTC <WiscoUSA> @marklevinshow Viewers tune in to hear from your guests, not watch them sit silently in a chair while you bloviate.
970502096775770113 2018-03-04 03:31:45 UTC <WiscoUSA> @marthamaccallum Couldnt even bring myself to watch it. Im over the award show lectures.
970501543127592960 2018-03-04 03:29:33 UTC <WiscoUSA> @marklevinshow If you want to save time for your guests answer maybe stop spewing your talking points and actually let your guest talk. @DevinNunes was extremely patient with you during this extremely annoying interview. It was painful to watch.
970494220963377152 2018-03-04 03:00:27 UTC <WiscoUSA> @greggutfeld Awards shows and CNN are nothing more than propaganda. Im a huge moviegoer and music lover but I do not watch awards shows anymore. I still occasionally watch CNN for some laughs.

970492087853633538 2018-03-04 02:51:59 UTC <WiscoUSA> @jordancrowder @scrowder The Oscars are on?
970491639155347456 2018-03-04 02:50:12 UTC <WiscoUSA> And immediately following the segment w/ @PeteHegseth about federal overreach, @NextRevFNC interviews an OH congressman talking about legislation aimed at limiting how much junk food we eat 
970390721378308097 2018-03-04 20:09:11 UTC <WiscoUSA> Lets be honest. The type of gun laws advocated by some are nothing less than prohibition. It didnt work for alcohol (which actually kills more people than guns) so what reasonable person thinks it will work for a constitutionally protected right like the right to bear arms?
970376706644209664 2018-03-04 19:13:30 UTC <WiscoUSA> @realDailyWire Hollywood celebrities seemingly unaware of the sacrifice our founding fathers and soldiers of the Revolutionary War made to give is the right to bear arms and to freely express ourselves, even with little orange pins. The former is a necessary to preserve the latter.
