966802024670158849 2018-02-22 22:28:59 UTC <imafan70> @AnnCoulter Really Ann? Criminals don't think that way. This isn't like a big movie heist. No, they always choose the easiest target. More armed security and 1-2 strictly regulated entry points would be the best deterrent. Along with staff concealed carry.

What I disagree with is walking out of school and abandoning their education to do so. I also disagree with my 2A being attacked. These are CHILDREN, Mark. They don't even have a fully developed frontal lobe.

966190794301460481 2018-02-20 06:00:10 UTC <imafan70> @AnthonyCumiaxyz @CookieHaid Because you want school children protected, right? Heightened armed security with 1-2 regulated entry points is the answer. Attacking the US Constitution is not.
966189996288995329 2018-02-20 05:57:00 UTC <imafan70> @JedediahBila I'll do it. With my AR15. 
966188340302241792 2018-02-20 05:50:25 UTC <imafan70> @AnthonyCumiaxyz @oldnerman @CaptainPoopie And I certainly wouldn't want someone named "Captain Poopie" to teach MY children.

No different than a Mini 14 ranch rifle. Otherwise known as a "varmit gun". It just looks scary to pansies like you. And yes, you need more armed security and 1 regulated entry point.
966121936324620289 2018-02-20 01:26:33 UTC <imafan70> @Ideal_Victoria Only if you tweet about it.

966015610177114114 2018-02-20 18:24:03 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump Ok, this is actually true.
966015137437151234 2018-02-20 18:22:11 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump What faith? Faith in yourself? You're way too Narcissistic to be a genuine Christian man.

966004757788876800 2018-02-20 17:40:56 UTC <imafan70> @RVAwonk Yep, they both talked a lot of smack about each other. It makes this endorsement impossible to believe.
966003880998965249 2018-02-20 17:37:27 UTC <imafan70> @JedediahBila Very strange.

966002031659044865 2018-02-20 17:30:06 UTC <imafan70> @StephenKing Finally a useful and interesting tweet. Thanks!
966001815811706881 2018-02-20 17:29:14 UTC <imafan70> @pattonoswalt You're both blasphemous.
965777909297373189 2018-02-19 02:39:31 UTC <imafan70> @pattonoswalt Touching. Still has nothing to do with #GunControl. No amount of gun control or bans will ever stop gun violence. Are you truly that dense?

965425570493460480 2018-02-18 03:19:27 UTC <imafan70> @RepMaxineWaters Negative. He would be appalled with the actions of you and your kind.

965393017518673920 2018-02-18 01:10:06 UTC <imafan70> @iliza Right? I never understood the complaints and weird disapprovals. I say, YAY CAMELTOE.

965391837329526784 2018-02-18 01:05:24 UTC <imafan70> @CarlaFinch Correct.
965391708518277121 2018-02-18 01:04:54 UTC <imafan70> @NicoleArbour I agree. Except for entertainers. They should keep their mouths shut and entertain us. That is a jester's place in life.
965338331847577600 2018-02-18 21:32:48 UTC <imafan70> @Gavin_McInnes @CopperCab You probably do.
965338003047682054 2018-02-18 21:31:29 UTC <imafan70> @StephenKing Explain, "free flow".
964789995641999360 2018-02-17 09:13:54 UTC <imafan70> @pattonoswalt Ok, yeah I agree that's extremely inappropriate. What do you expect from a Narcissist??
964789169070407680 2018-02-17 09:10:37 UTC <imafan70> @SethMacFarlane Despite their primary functions, a gun is used daily to protect the lives of you and your loved ones. A gun has been used to secure your freedom as an American. A car has been used to end thousands of innocent lives. Still want to play the comparison game?

964772808424349696 2018-02-17 08:05:36 UTC <imafan70> @FarrahDahl It's just right.
964769796922462208 2018-02-16 07:53:38 UTC <imafan70> @vincentcuratola @jimmykimmel just what would you propose to Trump as an idea to combat school shootings, Mr. Kimmel?
964768298956189696 2018-02-16 07:47:41 UTC <imafan70> @jamieleecurtis That's a terrible idea. Their education is just as important as their safety. How about we work on making schools safer? It's as simple as arming and training teachers. Adding more armed security at strictly regulated entry points.  Also, what is an "assault rifle"?
964767000928145413 2018-02-16 07:42:32 UTC <imafan70> @brandi_love Congrats!
964766901393149952 2018-02-16 07:42:08 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump @pattonoswalt He's a beta pretending to be alpha. He should just embrace his beta, like you do. Maybe not act as effeminate but still. Oh and what additional gun laws would you and your new teen friend propose?
964765478362271744 2018-02-16 07:36:29 UTC <imafan70> @sarahchad_  What additional gun control would you propose that isn't already in place?? And you do realize that no gun law could have prevented this school shooting, right?

963290861474861056 2018-02-12 05:56:53 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump Ok! Another great statement. One day you'll have to actually start backing up things you say. You can't just continue to bank on people believing your wonderous claims without eventually requiring action. Why don't you start with that wall, hmmm?
963289039897088000 2018-02-12 05:49:38 UTC <imafan70> @RealJamesWoods I'm a Conservative. I don't hate Trump nor do I even dislike him. I just think he has no business being POTUS.

959379246601981952 2018-02-02 10:53:31 UTC <imafan70> @StephenKing I call it, insensitive.
958444554667069440 2018-01-30 20:59:23 UTC <imafan70> @StephenKing But unrealistic.
958270062074515456 2018-01-30 09:26:01 UTC <imafan70> I, for one, knew that @Indians would eventually cave to Liberal PC pressure. Everyone does. @Redskins are next. They will all conform. Spineless cowards.
958263807704432640 2018-01-30 09:01:10 UTC <imafan70> @StephenKing So now you're comparing Trump to Mussolini? C'mon King, you're much more intelligent than this nonsense you've been Tweeting.
958094416887144448 2018-01-29 21:48:04 UTC <imafan70> @StephenKing It's also been given by a narcissistic, America hating Muslim but you didn't have a problem with that either. Hmmm...
958093361419816961 2018-01-29 21:43:52 UTC <imafan70> @StephenKing It's been given by an impeached sexual predator before. But you Libs don't wanna mention that, huh?

956839322451431424 2018-01-26 10:40:46 UTC <imafan70> @StephenKing Obama contributed to most of that. He made us weak.
955385286455939072 2018-01-22 10:22:57 UTC <imafan70> @brandi_love What a weirdo.
955381771658498048 2018-01-22 10:08:59 UTC <imafan70> @RealJamesWoods It won't get built. As soon as he claimed it, I detected BS. Saying he'll force a poverty stricken third world country to pay for it increased the BS level 10 fold. I'm amused by how many actually still believe it.

952864325596864512 2018-01-15 11:25:33 UTC <imafan70> @jamieleecurtis Ok, I agree that Trump is an arrogant narcissist but how is he at fault for the incompetent employee who actually did cause the missile scare?
952852222932606976 2018-01-15 10:37:27 UTC <imafan70> @StaceyPrussman @FeistyCovfefe It's been a joke for quite awhile now. They're using it as a type of social status.

952845296647786496 2018-01-15 10:09:56 UTC <imafan70> @JimCarrey Carrey, you and your Hollywood friends need to stick to being our jesters. Your ignorant opinions on politics were never requested.
952844320020881408 2018-01-15 10:06:03 UTC <imafan70> @JimCarrey One of God's twisted jokes on humanity was to make the most gifted of us also the most idiotic.

945744352466423808 2017-12-26 19:53:19 UTC <imafan70> @dallascowboys I like Jason but maybe it should be an issue.
945538064553857024 2017-12-25 06:13:36 UTC <imafan70> @texasstalkermom Is yours?

945537485861507073 2017-12-25 06:11:18 UTC <imafan70> Is there anything more sexy than @leeannwomack singing "Baby, it's cold outside"?
945535959994654720 2017-12-25 06:05:14 UTC <imafan70> @pattonoswalt You finally post something funny 
945535793745006592 2017-12-25 06:04:35 UTC <imafan70> @sarahmcpants Always will STILL
942929171885543424 2017-12-18 01:26:48 UTC <imafan70> @AnthonyCumiaxyz @bobo103nyc All Ant has to do is ask you to as a personal favor and you would. No shame in that Bobo.
942923968432037889 2017-12-18 01:06:07 UTC <imafan70> @AnthonyCumiaxyz @bobo103nyc You would for free.
942870911144857600 2017-12-18 21:35:17 UTC <imafan70> @texasstalkermom You're always first in my eyes 
942792292406046720 2017-12-18 16:22:53 UTC <imafan70> @texasstalkermom He laughed up until his death.

942625811508682753 2017-12-17 05:21:21 UTC <imafan70> @TheMercedesXXX Haters will be haters. They're simple minded. F'em!
942087109657100288 2017-12-16 17:40:44 UTC <imafan70> @TheMercedesXXX Feeling stronger and better are the most important aspects.

940332882412888069 2017-12-11 21:30:04 UTC <imafan70> @texasstalkermom Very trashy.
940277191719489538 2017-12-11 17:48:46 UTC <imafan70> @seanhannity with your connections, get him some good MMA classes. It'll build his confidence to verbally and physically protect himself.
940276172071604224 2017-12-11 17:44:43 UTC <imafan70> @Lrihendry It's getting to the point where anyone can come forward and say anything about anyone and they're automatically believed without any investigation.
940237554464456704 2017-12-11 15:11:16 UTC <imafan70> Hey Tweeters! Can we please get #islamistheproblem cranked up again? Because it is.
940236462150373378 2017-12-11 15:06:55 UTC <imafan70> @MarkRuffalo Mark, it's "Israel" and they have shown an admirable amount of restraint over the years. It's the heathens who constantly attack them who need your reprimand. But that would be too risky huh?
940234982538215424 2017-12-11 15:01:03 UTC <imafan70> The thing about bullies is they only exist because victims exist. Don't be a victim. It's really just that easy. #StopBullyingNow #KeatonStrong
940233993760530434 2017-12-11 14:57:07 UTC <imafan70> @AllCharisma @AMF6686 is correct. All he would have to do is stand up to one of those bullies and bloody his nose. Bullies want easy victims.
939893496030384128 2017-12-10 16:24:06 UTC <imafan70> @TheCarlWeathers What he meant was that he doesn't want to be stuck in a foxhole with someone having such serious mental issues.
939891637202939905 2017-12-10 16:16:43 UTC <imafan70> @danawhite That's a great idea Dana! Then some MMA training!
939340534887469056 2017-12-08 03:46:50 UTC <imafan70> @SIRIUSXM @Sethrogen Oh stop posturing with your fake outrage and learn how to spell.
936139071545597952 2017-11-29 07:45:21 UTC <imafan70> @texasstalkermom In the meantime....How YOU doin? 
936138873599676416 2017-11-29 07:44:34 UTC <imafan70> @texasstalkermom Truth. It's getting ridiculous.
935408321133203456 2017-11-27 07:21:37 UTC <imafan70> @texasstalkermom Mmmmm potatoooo
935407847743148033 2017-11-27 07:19:44 UTC <imafan70> @texasstalkermom That's what I was wondering.

931634775034654720 2017-11-17 21:26:53 UTC <imafan70> @SarahEMcBride How about we elect the most competent regardless of their classification? Except those opposed to our constitution, of course. 
931633408094195717 2017-11-17 21:21:28 UTC <imafan70> @texasstalkermom You had me at pizza 
931632918082080768 2017-11-17 21:19:31 UTC <imafan70> @JimNorton @sarahmcpants I was just thinking that same thing 
931042572952375296 2017-11-15 06:13:41 UTC <imafan70> @MileyCyrus Equality?? Muslims will never be equal to anyone but other Muslims, according to their Koran and Sharia Law. Has anyone asked them if they even want to be? I dare ya.
931041483691626496 2017-11-15 06:09:22 UTC <imafan70> @KatTimpf The Voice dude who keeps cheating on his wives.

931041065318125568 2017-11-15 06:07:42 UTC <imafan70> @WilliamShatner No. We're... dedicated.
931040845104640000 2017-11-15 06:06:50 UTC <imafan70> @texasstalkermom Agreed. Like how People magazine voted Blake Shelton the sexiest man alive. Really? It should be considered sexy to remain loyal to your spouse.
930563852114235392 2017-11-14 22:31:26 UTC <imafan70> @HillaryClinton Are we to believe that you actually care? Is that your angle?

919884875544612869 2017-10-16 11:16:59 UTC <imafan70> @30SECONDFlGHTS As long as he's resisting and/or fighting, strikes are completely justified to secure the arrest.

915328159716925440 2017-10-03 21:30:13 UTC <imafan70> @CopperCab We invented.... oh yeah, EVERYTHING that is awesome. Africans invented slavery, dummy.
915327847111254018 2017-10-03 21:28:59 UTC <imafan70> @WilliamShatner Because he's the absolute coolest daddio.

915023806355443712 2017-10-02 01:20:50 UTC <imafan70> The way Liberals use a tragedy like this to push their lame anti-gun propaganda sickens me. #PrayingforVegas
915023188404396034 2017-10-02 01:18:23 UTC <imafan70> @TheMercedesXXX By all means, promote yourself to me. 
915022793758167041 2017-10-02 01:16:48 UTC <imafan70> @pattonoswalt He should actually focus on finding and destroying Bush's evil hurricane machine. Right? *nudge* Am I right??
915022309257248768 2017-10-02 01:14:53 UTC <imafan70> @BorisKodjoe Because anyone can buy anything on the black market despite any legalities.

913258992662728705 2017-09-27 04:28:06 UTC <imafan70> @pattonoswalt This is lame, as usual. @JimNorton Tweeted the funniest so far.
913168139457896450 2017-09-27 22:27:04 UTC <imafan70> @BryanBroaddus @dallascowboys You mean, after kneeling down with the tape?
913167244758278144 2017-09-27 22:23:31 UTC <imafan70> @zesty_rightwing Many watched just to see what they would do. Huge disappointment.
913166182114611201 2017-09-27 22:19:18 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump Yeah, AFTER they kneel. A kneel is a kneel.
912825977084039168 2017-09-26 23:47:27 UTC <imafan70> @apurposefulwife And tell your boys as I've told my son. Be prepared because people will always disappoint you and usually when you least expect it.

877603816807464960 2017-06-21 19:07:09 UTC <imafan70> @AnthonyCumia Yes! When the officer says don't reach, DON'T REACH. Especially after telling him you have a gun.
877603220167811073 2017-06-21 19:04:47 UTC <imafan70> @AnthonyCumia The suspense is killing us.

852401597279875073 2017-04-12 06:02:32 UTC <imafan70> @AnthonyCumia @RichLP68 A post 9-11 airplane is no place to hold your protest.
852401080151547904 2017-04-12 06:00:29 UTC <imafan70> @AnthonyCumia The reason behind it is irrelevant at that moment in time. When you're told to leave, you best beat your feet.
852400451916111872 2017-04-12 05:57:59 UTC <imafan70> @AnthonyCumia @RichLP68 We would walk out and address the issue through an attorney later like a sane person.
852398950313332739 2017-04-12 05:52:01 UTC <imafan70> @AnthonyCumia @ChaseTettleton Yeah, once you're ordered off the plane, there's no negotiation. You just leave and board another flight like a sane person.
852397207764570113 2017-04-12 05:45:05 UTC <imafan70> @AnthonyCumia @TheHateTank Of course he'll win a court case. Everyone will bow to the PC pressure, as usual. It still won't validate his actions.
852396520343207936 2017-04-12 05:42:21 UTC <imafan70> @AnthonyCumia @TheHateTank @AmericanHotLips You can't disobey the captain's orders on an airplane. They asked him to exit, several times, and he refused. That's disobeying.

851944855303540737 2017-04-11 23:47:36 UTC <imafan70> @AnthonyCumia @thepatertot Some people bring those misfortunes upon themselves. By being lunatics. On planes.
851750028079247360 2017-04-11 10:53:26 UTC <imafan70> Yes, when you refuse to exit a plane after being ordered to then of course you must be dragged off. #United #notademocracy
851749664047202304 2017-04-11 10:51:59 UTC <imafan70> Yes, when a pilot asks you to leave his plane, no matter the reason, then you must leave. #United #notademocracy

846122621896982528 2017-03-26 22:12:07 UTC <imafan70> @pattonoswalt Bad? No, we need jesters. Your problem is thinking you're more than a jester.
846121596767125505 2017-03-26 22:08:03 UTC <imafan70> @rickygervais Insult Muhammad in the presence of Islam and see what happens. Dismemberment is the result. Yet, your kind defends them.
846120398047596544 2017-03-26 22:03:17 UTC <imafan70> @rickygervais Tweets? No, your existence outside your assignment annoys me. You're a jester, nothing more.

843629671665287169 2017-03-19 01:06:02 UTC <imafan70> @AnthonyCumia Glad someone else thinks so. I kinda didn't want to admit it.
843026483396448258 2017-03-18 09:09:10 UTC <imafan70> @JimNorton Yes. You HAVE.
842476995535654913 2017-03-16 20:45:42 UTC <imafan70> I still love ya @emmyrossum but @SHO_Shameless completely jumped the shark in season 6. Happens to so many great show writers.

806484212706471937 2016-12-07 13:03:14 UTC <imafan70> I wonder why dummies like @FFReligion never target religions like Scientology or Islam. Oh yeah, because Christians are easy targets.

801044157515137024 2016-11-22 12:46:24 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump Really? Look, you have to learn to deal with adversities now instead of reacting like a child. You're about to be POTUS!

800355092331233280 2016-11-20 15:08:18 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump Got a job for a true patriot? A bible reading Constitutionalist with a high IQ and useful common sense? Probably not...
800354426254786560 2016-11-20 15:05:39 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump No they shouldn't. Even racist idiots are covered under our Constitution. Sorry.

797924702178181121 2016-11-13 22:10:48 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump Only because they're relieved that Hillary didn't win.
796158097819574273 2016-11-08 01:10:57 UTC <imafan70> I voted for @dak
796157635145957378 2016-11-08 01:09:06 UTC <imafan70> Just remember, no matter what the results are, our nation will be stuck with the wrong candidate. We're screwed either way.
796157042507522050 2016-11-08 01:06:45 UTC <imafan70> @1053thefan @dallascowboys By ear? How about we play it by what the obvious choice is. We're enjoying this winning season.
796156673094254592 2016-11-08 01:05:17 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump it was already great.
795370621312135170 2016-11-06 21:01:48 UTC <imafan70> @dallascowboys Kiss this success goodbye if you plan on putting Romo back in.

785998344673828864 2016-10-11 00:19:43 UTC <imafan70> @1053thefan @dallascowboys DO NOT put Romo back in. Ever. Please.
785997895761694720 2016-10-11 00:17:56 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump Don't get it twisted. Texans are only voting for you because they hate Hillary.

766324133764399104 2016-08-18 17:21:25 UTC <imafan70> With @realDonaldTrump continuing to screw up any minuscule chance he had, we might wanna just focus on keeping the House and Senate.

738792523552854016 2016-06-03 18:00:38 UTC <imafan70> Well, you did say that you listen to the show. You obviously have the attention span of a three year old.
738788742404526080 2016-06-03 17:45:36 UTC <imafan70> Yeah I do. Better shape than you are, I'm sure. Jealousy will eat you up.

715172775686590465 2016-03-30 13:44:11 UTC <imafan70> Anderson Cooper tells Donald Trump he argues like 'a five-year-old' http://a.msn.com/01/en-us/BBr6stz?ocid=st  SPOT ON! He's an overgrown, spoiled brat.
714915497347653632 2016-03-29 20:41:51 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump *laugh* You couldn't hold a candle to that man.
714901684644765696 2016-03-29 19:46:58 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump That's what happens when you encourage your groupies to be violent and then offer to pay their legal fees.

712742399307452416 2016-03-23 20:46:44 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump I mean, you DID accuse Carson of being a pedophile so it must have been a very attractive offer. Secretary of Education?
712742123871674368 2016-03-23 20:45:39 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump At least he endorsed Ted without being promised anything. What did you and Carson agree to?
712665192509739008 2016-03-23 15:39:57 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump Besides, someone needed to expose what kind of woman your wife is.
712665054676590592 2016-03-23 15:39:24 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump He has a large group of volunteers. I'm sure he doesn't micromanage like you do.
712628710864650240 2016-03-23 13:14:59 UTC <imafan70> For @realDonaldTrump groupies who refuse to admit that he has encouraged violence on others. #CruzCrew #DumpTrumppic.twitter.com/uyLP7H1df8

712623777633345537 2016-03-23 12:55:23 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump You would. Not only is that underhanded but much like throwing stones in a glass house.

712353410217934848 2016-03-22 19:01:02 UTC <imafan70> @joederosacomedy You should read the Koran. It's full of hate and terroristic instructions.

709077593002147840 2016-03-13 18:04:06 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom Fake. But your guy is inciting violence at his own rallies. Now what?
708310884511158274 2016-03-11 15:17:29 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom I can honestly say that he is, however, a much better candidate than Trump. We weren't given the best choices ya know.
708310608483995649 2016-03-11 15:16:23 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom  I never claimed Cruz is perfect. Far beyond it. I can admit that but you Trump groupies can't admit the MANY Trump faults.
708310133370019841 2016-03-11 15:14:30 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom What exactly am I jealous of? None of what you say makes any sense.

708007353665228800 2016-03-10 19:11:21 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom You still haven't given examples or proof of these lies you claim Cruz told like @blitzburgh75 asked you to.
708006844254396416 2016-03-10 19:09:20 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom I haven't lied. I have relayed what I know to be true.
708006723202588672 2016-03-10 19:08:51 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom Now you're condemning me to Hell? Aren't you just the sweetest thing. Bleh!
708006334751309825 2016-03-10 19:07:18 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom No, I didn't say that. Trump tries to be elusive but he's transparent to me. I see the truth. You'll find out if he wins.
708005742691782657 2016-03-10 19:04:57 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom More concept than you, apparently. I know exactly what Trump has done. I see the structure to his sales pitch.
708003837999599616 2016-03-10 18:57:23 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom I never said it's shady money. How is it shady money? Campaigns take any money that's thrown at them.
708003426093768704 2016-03-10 18:55:45 UTC <imafan70> @rushlimbaugh @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump If they don't fall for the slick sales pitch before.
708003206630998016 2016-03-10 18:54:53 UTC <imafan70> @rushlimbaugh Well, @tedcruz may not be able to take voters from @realDonaldTrump but he can take the undecided.
708002153785262081 2016-03-10 18:50:42 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump HATES the fact that if he had been head to head with @tedcruz, he would be losing.
708001884993236992 2016-03-10 18:49:38 UTC <imafan70> @marcorubio @JohnKasich You two need to drop out already. You can't win. All you're doing is taking delegates from @tedcruz at this point.
708001150348300288 2016-03-10 18:46:42 UTC <imafan70> @blitzburgh75 @tymadisonmom At least Cruz knows and fights for the Bible and the Constitution. Trump could not care less about either.
708000740820660224 2016-03-10 18:45:05 UTC <imafan70> @blitzburgh75 @tymadisonmom And Trump is certainly not known for his morality. He is nothing but a pandering bully.
708000433906671616 2016-03-10 18:43:52 UTC <imafan70> @blitzburgh75 @tymadisonmom How he has contributed to DEMOCRATS and has supported the Liberal agenda until mysteriously "switching" sides.
707999943504453633 2016-03-10 18:41:55 UTC <imafan70> @blitzburgh75 @tymadisonmom True. Funny how they seem to forget how Trump has had his power hungry hands in the establishment for years.
707999356692013056 2016-03-10 18:39:35 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom Dual citizenship. You're just grasping at straws. All the while, Trumps cons are so YUGE and obvious. Heck, he parades them.
707998849025974273 2016-03-10 18:37:34 UTC <imafan70> @rkf1215 @tymadisonmom @steph93065 Ok? And that means? I retired at 43. Then I was able to run my charity and business fulltime.
707989580520140800 2016-03-10 18:00:44 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom Mmm hmm, he is now. His hands are just as dirty. Throw stones much?
707989259148353539 2016-03-10 17:59:27 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom Doesn't matter. And Cruz passes all requirements and restrictions. Sorry. ;-)
707988908009598976 2016-03-10 17:58:04 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom @rkf1215 @steph93065 Look, I would love to stay and further school you #Trump groupies but I have my own business to run.
707988463392399360 2016-03-10 17:56:18 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom @rkf1215 @steph93065 @tedcruz I just did answer you. Go look. Why would you even think I would know that? Weird.
707988016313212932 2016-03-10 17:54:31 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom There are thousands and thousands of American citizens who have dual citizenship with Canada. Many are politicians and celebs.
707987652381769728 2016-03-10 17:53:04 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom Like I'm supposed to know that? Ask him!
707987514179457026 2016-03-10 17:52:31 UTC <imafan70> @blitzburgh75 @tymadisonmom @Sam777rt @steph93065 Exactly. They'll trash everyone else for the same things #Trump has done. Geez.
707986927857704960 2016-03-10 17:50:12 UTC <imafan70> @rkf1215 @steph93065 @tymadisonmom Something else you only believe because #Trump told you so.
707983960769298433 2016-03-10 17:38:24 UTC <imafan70> @blitzburgh75 @tymadisonmom @Sam777rt @steph93065 They can't. They're just so enamored with #Trump that they will say anything in defense.
707983103948492800 2016-03-10 17:35:00 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom Running the US is WAYYYY different than running a company.
707982987544043520 2016-03-10 17:34:32 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom Being a good business man does not equate to being a good POTUS. Sorry.
707982792273952772 2016-03-10 17:33:46 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom Yes, he's a very intelligent businessman and salesman. So good, he has just sold a load of crap to a feed lot.
707982060749651968 2016-03-10 17:30:51 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom No, he's had more failures than successes. You only believe he's the best because he tells you he's the best. Narcissist.
707981674118668289 2016-03-10 17:29:19 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom That scorched Earth tactic is not going to work in Washington. I know it sounds great but it's just not logical.
707981454882373632 2016-03-10 17:28:27 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom Yes because they'll have no choice. He knows how to navigate. He knows how it works. Trump doesn't.
707981165056040961 2016-03-10 17:27:18 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom @Derigitable @steph93065 He actually has. And again, at least he tries. Much more than any other senator.
707980902337359872 2016-03-10 17:26:15 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom No need. You misinterpreted.
707980731872468992 2016-03-10 17:25:34 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom Which is true. They do. I never denied that it's possible for Cruz to lie. I said that I've never found one. YOU re-read.
707980338299928577 2016-03-10 17:24:00 UTC <imafan70> @Derigitable @steph93065 @tymadisonmom Because he HAS jumped in and fought for us. That tends to ruffle feathers.
707980105809666048 2016-03-10 17:23:05 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom He is the entire definition of a jerk. He's a classic Narcissist.
707979810354503680 2016-03-10 17:21:55 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom You can't just jump into someone's sandbox, call them all stupid and losers and then expect them to let you stay and play.
707979608679841793 2016-03-10 17:21:06 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom He's made too many enemies in the House and Senate.
707979460432138240 2016-03-10 17:20:31 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom Even if #Trump has good intentions and tries to do all these fantastical things he claims, he won't be able to.
707979080193351681 2016-03-10 17:19:00 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom Do you seriously think #Trump will do anything? Why? Because he told you he would? This coming from a slick salesman.
707978862399856644 2016-03-10 17:18:09 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom He has done a lot, from what I've seen. He hasn't always been successful but at least he's tried.
707978626424184833 2016-03-10 17:17:12 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom Uhhh no. What are you even talking about? Resorting to claiming I said something that I didn't?
707978231874347013 2016-03-10 17:15:38 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom He does? How did you come up with that? No, none of your points have been proven.
707977893733736448 2016-03-10 17:14:18 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom They all did! I would have too! I just meant that #Trump IS exactly what you claim to dislike. Who is the fool?
707977457299628032 2016-03-10 17:12:34 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom What lie? If I discovered a lie, of course I wouldn't believe it.
707977277053644800 2016-03-10 17:11:51 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom They dislike @realDonaldTrump simply because he's a jerk. They only fear the fact that he has no clue how to be president.
707976953161080832 2016-03-10 17:10:33 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom No, they don't like him. They fear him. He has stood up to them time and again. They know he is serious and will get it done.
707976579943571456 2016-03-10 17:09:04 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom What was IMmature? Everything I have said is the truth. Did you not realize that they all lie?
707976199767613441 2016-03-10 17:07:34 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom Plus, @realDonaldTrump WAS one of those donors.
707975950298787840 2016-03-10 17:06:34 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom Narcissists are the easiest to influence.
707975865611649024 2016-03-10 17:06:14 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom Oh don't fool yourself. He can be influenced. Not with money but temptations like power.
707975446348955648 2016-03-10 17:04:34 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom No, I have an investigative mind. I believe what I see not what I wish was there.
707975100511817728 2016-03-10 17:03:12 UTC <imafan70> It just amazes me. You @realDonaldTrump groupies will believe and say anything. Hey ummm, I have some ocean front property I need to unload.
707974349546893313 2016-03-10 17:00:13 UTC <imafan70> @TeresaC85469500 @Sam777rt @tymadisonmom @steph93065 Pandering? Self absorbed? Ma'am, you are describing @realDonaldTrump perfectly.
707973979382751232 2016-03-10 16:58:44 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom I hate to burst your bubble but....THEY ALL LIE. Just some more than others - @realDonaldTrump
707973764852502529 2016-03-10 16:57:53 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom I haven't discovered one lie. Not saying there aren't but I haven't found one.
707973490662449152 2016-03-10 16:56:48 UTC <imafan70> @steph93065 Well, it wasn't intended to be an insult. I'm just being honest.
707973240023441409 2016-03-10 16:55:48 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom But it's not like we were given good choices anyway.
707973114353725444 2016-03-10 16:55:18 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom No, I'm not a weak minded person. I analyzed everything available and concluded that Cruz is the overall best candidate.
707972552660922370 2016-03-10 16:53:04 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom @steph93065 Obviously, you haven't. Try again.
707972322766954496 2016-03-10 16:52:09 UTC <imafan70> @steph93065 @tymadisonmom Condescension? No, negative. Just being honest. Do your research. ;-)
707971721396027392 2016-03-10 16:49:46 UTC <imafan70> @Sam777rt @tymadisonmom @steph93065 You Trump groupies will say anything. Typical slick sales tactic.

707970906287509505 2016-03-10 16:46:32 UTC <imafan70> @BDB2360 @tymadisonmom @steph93065 @Sam777rt Even if he has been, are you suggesting that the other candidates are more honest? *laugh*
707970778956890112 2016-03-10 16:46:01 UTC <imafan70> @BDB2360 @tymadisonmom @steph93065 @Sam777rt I've found no dishonesty.
707970360382087168 2016-03-10 16:44:22 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom @BDB2360 @steph93065 @Sam777rt Apparently, they can.
707970171768414209 2016-03-10 16:43:37 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom @Sam777rt @steph93065 He's done a lot for Texas. That's common knowledge. Again, do your research.
707969975701475328 2016-03-10 16:42:50 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom @Sam777rt @steph93065 Primarily, he fights passionately for our Constitution. That's very important to me. Should be to you.
707969707547037697 2016-03-10 16:41:46 UTC <imafan70> @tymadisonmom @steph93065 He has accomplished a lot. Do your research.
707964577107943424 2016-03-10 16:21:23 UTC <imafan70> @Sam777rt @tymadisonmom @steph93065 Ummm no, you're thinking about @realDonaldTrump. Sorry.
707666052629405696 2016-03-09 20:35:09 UTC <imafan70> @Shooters_Wife They're just taking delegates away from Cruz. He would be winning if not for them.
707665210006315008 2016-03-09 20:31:48 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump Who ISN'T a loser in your narcissistic opinion?
707582517465866240 2016-03-09 15:03:13 UTC <imafan70> More stink in the Trump world.  Trump appears to have got a tax break for people who dont earn over $500,000 http://a.msn.com/00/en-us/AAgxHvw?ocid=st
707281766994747393 2016-03-08 19:08:08 UTC <imafan70> It's baffling how @realDonaldTrump the Chump seems to forget that we know how he helped put @BarackObama in office BOTH times.
707271753697890304 2016-03-08 18:28:21 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump Really?! So do you, dummy!

705760846400491521 2016-03-04 14:24:32 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump @marcorubio Am I wrong to want my POTUS to be a decent person and actually ACT presidential?
705760566598438914 2016-03-04 14:23:26 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump @marcorubio Nor do I want one who would openly accuse others of it being inadequate.
705760324746551296 2016-03-04 14:22:28 UTC <imafan70> I don't want a president who would openly reference his penis on national television. @realDonaldTrump
705448857866383361 2016-03-03 17:44:48 UTC <imafan70> @FoxNews @KatrinaPierson Any good pandering used car salesman can do the same.
705446918864830465 2016-03-03 17:37:06 UTC <imafan70> @FoxNews @Patriot_Girl_TX @MonicaCrowley Don't forget, @realDonaldTrump donated to and supported the establishment for many years.
705446670524243969 2016-03-03 17:36:07 UTC <imafan70> @FoxNews @Patriot_Girl_TX @MonicaCrowley @realDonaldTrump I don't think it's a control issue. Nobody likes a loose cannon.

705061199327563776 2016-03-02 16:04:23 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump doesn't even care if people know the truth about him. He knows they will still support him.pic.twitter.com/CqeKWuaIEy
705038795435954177 2016-03-02 14:35:22 UTC <imafan70> That's right. Texans don't want @realDonaldTrump. Keep your Liberal, arrogant self up in your "Chump Tower" where you belong.

704349849173434369 2016-02-29 16:57:44 UTC <imafan70> @realDonaldTrump You could strangle a puppy and kick a pregnant woman's tummy on national TV and STILL gain followers. I don't get it.
