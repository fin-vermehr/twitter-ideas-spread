949049217812779008 2018-01-04 22:45:40 UTC <bobbybybee> @RepMattKrause I know teachers that do as well. But they don't "have" to.  Thats the argument that political hacks make to draw sympathy. I don't have to have ribeyes every day. Mostly I eat ground turkey because that's all I can afford.
948964350907346944 2018-01-04 17:08:26 UTC <bobbybybee> @AdamsForTX I don't really care what you think anyway. @RepMattKrause is my rep and I want to know what he thinks.
948963959113240576 2018-01-04 17:06:53 UTC <bobbybybee> @RepMattKrause @AdamsForTX I can agree with that. But you've made this about teachers when it's not. I think they should be able to deduct whatever they spend no matter the amount. But I know teachers who don't care about this as much as you do. You're some sort of hack creating a mountain from a molehill.
948961720806051841 2018-01-04 16:57:59 UTC <bobbybybee> @RepMattKrause @AdamsForTX You've completely missed the point.

948959268677586947 2018-01-04 16:48:15 UTC <bobbybybee> @RepMattKrause @AdamsForTX Besides all that, the men that went to the moon in the 60's pretty much learned by reading and regurgitating from a textbook. Can't be all that bad.
948958378042290176 2018-01-04 16:44:42 UTC <bobbybybee> @RepMattKrause @AdamsForTX Do you have Statistical proof?  Because we have lots of statistics about throwing money into education and not seeing any evidence that it helped. We spend more on education in this country than most but are not the best at it.
948957220041043969 2018-01-04 16:40:06 UTC <bobbybybee> @AdamsForTX Experiments and tests?  Really??  That's part of the curriculum.
948955311989231616 2018-01-04 16:32:31 UTC <bobbybybee> @RepMattKrause @AdamsForTX How does a calendar, or lack thereof,  make for a lower quality education?  Do you have statistical proof that it does?
948954980425388034 2018-01-04 16:31:12 UTC <bobbybybee> @RepMattKrause @AdamsForTX Still Doesn't make it the teachers responsibility. When life hands you lemons, you make lemonade, not ribeyes.
948954253481201664 2018-01-04 16:28:19 UTC <bobbybybee> @AdamsForTX Seems to me the most basic level is what is provided. Books, workbooks, projectors, those things already provided by the school. Btw, I have 3 kids in the public school system. Don't portray me as somehow being out of touch. I would venture to guess that you are more out of touch
948953168301436928 2018-01-04 16:24:00 UTC <bobbybybee> @RepMattKrause @AdamsForTX Last time I checked those things were the responsibility of the parents to provide.
948940879812874240 2018-01-04 15:35:10 UTC <bobbybybee> @RepMattKrause @AdamsForTX Doesn't answer my question. The still don't have to. At home, we make do with what we have. I'm not disagreeing that we need to change it, but don't make this about teachers being forced to go to office depot and spend their own money.
948765684535889921 2018-01-03 03:59:01 UTC <bobbybybee> @RepMattKrause Matt, tell me why do they "have to" buy things for their classrooms?  Why can't they make do with what they are given?

782981135080919040 2016-10-03 16:30:24 UTC <bobbybybee> @ErinRehman @mcuban True, on both sides. But this issue doesn't disqualify either. Both have much bigger disqualifications.
782979276605763585 2016-10-03 16:23:01 UTC <bobbybybee> @zerohedge @mcuban @ErinRehman Well, the IRS has deemed it legal for both Trump and Hillbilly. So there's that.
782973869141401600 2016-10-03 16:01:32 UTC <bobbybybee> @zerohedge @mcuban It really doesn't matter Mark. It's legal. Can't demonize the guy for doing something legal. Let's see your tax returns.
