969826598504550400 2018-03-02 06:47:34 UTC <TonySav17> Next time there's an "active shooter" incident and police don't want to head in, just tell them there's a couple of kids inside smoking pot, a man selling fruit without a permit, and some church group feeding the homeless people. See how quickly the SWAT team is called out.

969316390829285376 2018-03-01 21:00:11 UTC <TonySav17> In the past 48 hrs. Trump has suggested: (1) removing Second Amendment rights without due process; (2) a massive tariff that would likely launch a trade war; (3) the death penalty for drug dealers. That aint good.

968059557833510912 2018-02-26 09:45:58 UTC <TonySav17> Record number of people flock to gun show in Florida while here in Ohio, concealed carry courses are maxed out at the moment.  This Socialist media can continue all they want on dividing us, but out here, on the streets of America, we are coming together more than they think.
968051576224075776 2018-02-26 09:14:15 UTC <TonySav17> Props to this guy, Andrew Pollack, laying the smack down with a pipebomb of truth.https://youtu.be/yOOYXku7x3A

968016303234613248 2018-02-25 06:54:06 UTC <TonySav17> @Bin_Hamin @THEVinceRusso I'm about to listen to the latest Conspiracy Horsemen, and I hear Vince mention the "two boys" who were killed in 1987.  Dude, that was a big episode on @Unsolved Mysteries and they worked hard to get all the info they could.  Bin, you hear anything new?

968003367464259584 2018-02-25 06:02:42 UTC <TonySav17> #Scorpio are great at distancing themselves from people, so be careful how you treat them.
967995156262735872 2018-02-25 05:30:04 UTC <TonySav17> Everyone that goes into the NRA building comes out alive. The same can't be said about Planned Parenthood.
967993472153194496 2018-02-25 05:23:22 UTC <TonySav17> @PeriscopeCo is pure trash for all the trolls.  What a bunch of loser trash on this shit, and by the way, i am only saying this against my fellow Americans because it is an embarrassment.

967883532537384966 2018-02-25 22:06:31 UTC <TonySav17> for mass killers and instead of talking about solutions to stop the problem, Americans tend to focus more on the symptomsas they are easier to use for divide.
967883369928413184 2018-02-25 22:05:52 UTC <TonySav17> According to TIME, In the 1920s, the terrorists whom most Americans feared were anarchists. Newsreels regularly reported anarchist-related bombings and attacks in the U.S. and abroad. Anarchists were scarybut they were also characterized as shady foreigners...
967882883707867137 2018-02-25 22:03:56 UTC <TonySav17> The deadliest school massacre ever to take place on US soil has been erased from history as it doesn't fit the narrative of today's school attacksespecially since it was carried out without a gun.

967623931946504192 2018-02-24 04:54:57 UTC <TonySav17> Fascism, Nazism, Communism, and Socialism are only superficial variations of the same monstrous themecollectivism.

967553296436285440 2018-02-24 00:14:16 UTC <TonySav17> Liberals honestly believe that 13 Russian trolls were able to influence our election more than the millions of illegal aliens who actually voted in it.  Who is ready to slam a liberal?
967549073573208064 2018-02-24 23:57:29 UTC <TonySav17> @THEVinceRusso I'm with you, lets do it.  It can be almost like a Chamber slumber party at Meltzers.

967399676092866560 2018-02-24 14:03:50 UTC <TonySav17> @THEVinceRusso Also, u can do Live feed right from Twitter. Don't even need the Periscope app. Just like Youtube and Facebook Live.
967391718814486530 2018-02-24 13:32:13 UTC <TonySav17> @JoeyImage @THEVinceRusso Answered my own question, NVM.  I should be able to figure this out.
967391322083680258 2018-02-24 13:30:39 UTC <TonySav17> @JoeyImage @THEVinceRusso I don't have periscope but i would get it to help you out.  I just don't know where to get it, is it an app from Google Play store?

967389269709983745 2018-02-24 13:22:29 UTC <TonySav17> @THEVinceRusso there is a Periscope twitter page that explains all that I believe.
967383878129410049 2018-02-24 13:01:04 UTC <TonySav17> @THEVinceRusso to be honest, with the platform you already have, you don't need to be using it.  Just depends if you like doing random on the spot live feeds of yourself and/or whatever you wanna talk about.
967383517930848256 2018-02-24 12:59:38 UTC <TonySav17> @RealityTSpiller UNREAL!!!

967365330828918784 2018-02-24 11:47:22 UTC <TonySav17> There is no such thing as gun control. There is only the centralization of gun ownership in the hands of a small political elite and their minions.

966336880508796931 2018-02-21 15:40:40 UTC <TonySav17> I love hearing the liberal scumbags on the mainstream media LIE about how many school shootings there have been in 2018 so far, with actually the blame on Trump of course, the LIBS say 18, when the fact is, there have been 3. Sorry, guns will never ever be banned.

Have 8 still be counselors, 2 start as Freddy and Jason, then see who gets more kills and Jason can fight Freddy at the end.  Make it a whole different mode.

964101510064955392 2018-02-15 11:38:06 UTC <TonySav17> So once again we learn that "gun free" zones don't work because all it does is keep the good guys with the guns out of the zone. Banning guns is not a valid option as it is a constitutional right to own one. And this particular gun free zone people, is YET AGAIN, ANOTHER SCHOOL.

961403007840768000 2018-02-07 00:55:13 UTC <TonySav17> Ya, this is definitely a mental disorder if anything, especially on the part of this 10 year old's parents.  UGGGHHH! Feel horrible for future generations.https://www.infowars.com/daily-beast-pushes-fierce-underaged-boys-in-drag/
961399976109793280 2018-02-07 00:43:10 UTC <TonySav17> This guy, George Soros, is such the ultimate piece of shit scumbag.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/02/07/george-soros-man-broke-bank-england-backing-secret-plot-thwart/
961391182222974976 2018-02-07 00:08:14 UTC <TonySav17> @RealityTSpiller ya, and the fact she became diabetic(which i had no idea could happen to a dog at that time) only shortened her life by a few years.
961389943045197826 2018-02-07 00:03:18 UTC <TonySav17> @RealityTSpiller Oh for sure.  When my one dog died in 2006, I thought it was end of my life.  Grew up with her and never really thought about her not being there.
961389117136351238 2018-02-07 00:00:01 UTC <TonySav17> @RealityTSpiller I don't wanna sound psychotic here, but i would much rather see a random human die that would deserve it, than any random animal which never deserves to die.  After all, animals do not murder each other.  Only our species does. haha 
961384369830137858 2018-02-07 23:41:10 UTC <TonySav17> @anders_ong How new does the audio have to be that u send to @JeffLane22?
961383559394136064 2018-02-07 23:37:56 UTC <TonySav17> I don't know.  I think that is too much of a commitment and I am worried about my IQ dropping.  
961382268957753344 2018-02-07 23:32:49 UTC <TonySav17> @ryansatin Ya, give me more of that lame ass 205 live.  This should be an embarrassment to all cruiser weights.  Watch those WCW Nitro cruiser weights.
961380979607777280 2018-02-07 23:27:41 UTC <TonySav17> @anders_ong haha I am prepared, I think.
961380710387941378 2018-02-07 23:26:37 UTC <TonySav17> Hell no, I would never spare a dime for that shit.  But its gonna be hard following those idiots on here without being tempted to troll then unfollow them.
961379917702336513 2018-02-07 23:23:28 UTC <TonySav17> @jesswinfield Oh mannnn GOOD ONE.  I'm crying now.

961158885544464384 2018-02-07 08:45:10 UTC <TonySav17> @DelSchilling @Mc_Heckin_Duff Much of what is found on the internet is very biased of Jackson.  I find that interesting, especially since he was the 1st president and only to end the central bank which has always been corrupted. Too much to type in a Twitter comment though.  Need 2 read Mein Kampf either way.
961155025400684551 2018-02-07 08:29:50 UTC <TonySav17> @DelSchilling Lol attempting that

961088789660798977 2018-02-06 04:06:38 UTC <TonySav17> @DRUDGE_REPORT This is a bit off, kratom is nothing compared to the opiate pills, the heroin and fentayl mix etc.  No surprise this comes from Yahoo, go figure.  Kratom has been used countless times for thousands of years that have helped with pain and even helping curb the opiate addiction.
961085543667982341 2018-02-06 03:53:44 UTC <TonySav17> BADASS!!!!!https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/961083704230674438

961083154688872454 2018-02-06 03:44:14 UTC <TonySav17> @JeffLane22 @THEVinceRusso @mayresify Contrarian, that is the point.  He is not 'working' people with his criticism of WWE, he has been saying all this for years.  It is nothing new, just his podcast is more new to a lot of people, and people should listen to it.
961082072361242624 2018-02-06 03:39:56 UTC <TonySav17> @AmberLPorkwood @RussosBrand @THEVinceRusso @RealityTSpiller U Teen Mom MARKS lol

961078290302857216 2018-02-06 03:24:55 UTC <TonySav17> lol, who is that chic with Goldust?

961076856383516672 2018-02-06 03:19:13 UTC <TonySav17> I love when the Twitter WWE 'Marks' try to use the lame line, "well, you are watching it."  Morons.
961076500312350721 2018-02-06 03:17:48 UTC <TonySav17> @WWE @ramonashelburne @mayresify u get 'passion' from comments i been making tonight? lol.
961076023235416065 2018-02-06 03:15:54 UTC <TonySav17> @THEVinceRusso @mayresify Usually i will watch the top 10 YouTube moments and listen to @JeffLane22 and Russo, that is my normal viewership of WWE.  You may like it but i can not understand how any of this is good.
961075624776478721 2018-02-06 03:14:19 UTC <TonySav17> @WWE @mayresify @ramonashelburne Oh really?  I think most ppl knew that.  On top of the stupid shirt she wore.  Maybe if they had her come out there and act REAL, it would of been 10x better.  Not that stupid pointing bullshit.
961074498643615744 2018-02-06 03:09:51 UTC <TonySav17> @THEVinceRusso @mayresify yep, that is the sad part that i actually wasted some of my time tonight.  I don't actually sit there and watch the whole thing without doing other things so my full attention is not on this terrible show.
961073262418644992 2018-02-06 03:04:56 UTC <TonySav17> @THEVinceRusso Exactly.  I made a post earlier saying that the RKO outta no where is the best thing on Smackdown, and that is sad.
961070863629119489 2018-02-06 02:55:24 UTC <TonySav17> @FightOwensFight @SamiZayn @WWEgames Neither, they both suck.
961070788899147781 2018-02-06 02:55:06 UTC <TonySav17> @THEVinceRusso Did u happen to see they do a top 10 now?  As in Daniel Bryan shows up on the big screen and reads off who the latest ranked top 10 are on #SDLive.  Unbelievably stupid idea and what a waste of a minute or so of this crappy show lol.

961061438273081347 2018-02-06 02:17:57 UTC <TonySav17> @JeffLane22 @RealityTSpiller i just got done beating the first one released for the Xbox One back in 2013 or 2014.  I actually got it to 100% complete lol.  I have no life right now.  The second one called "Rise of The Tomb Raider" is even better.
961061086572228609 2018-02-06 02:16:33 UTC <TonySav17> @JeffLane22 @RealityTSpiller they are awesome.  The first 3 were great, especially thanks to the graphics of the late 90s haha.  The newest ones for Xbox One are incredible.
961056773301067776 2018-02-06 01:59:24 UTC <TonySav17> @JeffLane22 Hey, so what video games u gonna be playin for those Youtube videos?  U like the Tomb Raider games?  Or anything from Rockstar?

959279025637097472 2018-02-01 04:15:16 UTC <TonySav17> @RealityTSpiller That shit is different.  That shouldn't even be exploited on that stupid show.  I'm talking about the typical lazy fat welfare collecting American that eats Big Macs by the pound daily.   HA i crack myself up.
959277656763023362 2018-02-01 04:09:50 UTC <TonySav17> @RealityTSpiller Sorry it seems like I'm "fat shaming" but i mean god damn.  And leave it to American reality TV garbage to exploit them for money and ratings.
959276980800598017 2018-02-01 04:07:09 UTC <TonySav17> @RealityTSpiller It maybe sad but didn't they have decades of their life to AT LEAST TRY and not look like they eat Wendys, Burger king and McDonald's over 10 times a day? I understand this is the U.S. and WE LOVE TO CONSUME  but god damn.
959275229305548800 2018-02-01 04:00:11 UTC <TonySav17> @RealityTSpiller Shit i can eat what u just said and feel ok for the day.  These 600 plus pounders on that show are eating/consuming more than what Godzilla and King Kong eat in a day.  Its seriously mostly a mental condition.
959272961982177280 2018-02-01 03:51:11 UTC <TonySav17> @RealityTSpiller Omg, but i can't help myself sometimes but look at that shit and wonder why the f**k I'm not on TV.  Haha

958571478013894656 2018-01-30 05:23:44 UTC <TonySav17> @JeffLane22 @THEVinceRusso Stop pickin on Jeff bro lol
958571303467929600 2018-01-30 05:23:02 UTC <TonySav17> @JeffLane22 @THEVinceRusso lol Vince.
958569224762544128 2018-01-30 05:14:47 UTC <TonySav17> @2PAC @TupacShakurLC @RealityTSpiller U should check out "Who Killed Tupac,"  It was on A&E for 6 or 7 episodes, was pretty good.
958569082185551872 2018-01-30 05:14:13 UTC <TonySav17> @2PAC @TupacShakurLC @RealityTSpiller That is the thing.  The Las Vegas Police are corrupted assholes.  At that time, Las Vegas was trying to become a more family friendly place.  And even that doesn't make sense, because u would think they would wanna solve the case since it gave Vegas a bad name already.  IDIOTS!!
958567141900521474 2018-01-30 05:06:30 UTC <TonySav17> @2PAC @TupacShakurLC @RealityTSpiller and much of what he said, is still very relevant today.  Only was 25 when he died.  His murder was not gang related either, i believe it was a hit by some entity of the government or some special group.  2pac could of became president he was so brilliant and charismatic.
958565917876805640 2018-01-30 05:01:38 UTC <TonySav17> @RealityTSpiller @TupacShakurLC so happy u like @2PAC.  My all time favorite.

Or even Hillary when she was falling into her plane or passing out in my hometown of Cleveland before she got into her blacked out van.  WHERE WERE THOSE QUESTIONS?  IDIOT!!
949801698419265536 2018-01-06 00:35:46 UTC <TonySav17> @steveaustinBSR @HyperMudflap YES.  I was like 11 when i became a fan of his and Stone Cold always made it seem like I was watching real life play out every Monday Night.  CM Punk came close to that for me but with the NWO/Monday Night Wars, they all made wrestling seem, REAL, at least.  Look at today lol.

949799889613086720 2018-01-06 00:28:34 UTC <TonySav17> @steveaustinBSR @HyperMudflap And another thing i always think about, how much the crowd would pop for Austin, over any other guy in history of that company.
949799163549704195 2018-01-06 00:25:41 UTC <TonySav17> @steveaustinBSR @HyperMudflap well of course that entrance video, but to me, since "Cult of Personality" is my all time favorite song and Austin is my all time favorite wrestler, and the way they edited the video, it was so fitting to Austin.  That's all.

And if it were band wagon worthy, A LOT more people would know about this video and the other version that is slightly better with faster edits.  This is not a diss on CM Punk dude, he is also in my top favorites.

Kind of like the @2PAC and @biggiesmalls debate.  2 me, 2pac was/is/and always will be a huge inspiration 2 me and the fact he kept it real and had remarkable talent, will be the greatest of all time, no 1 will ever come close.  Biggie was cool, but not a legend.

949461877108740097 2018-01-05 02:05:26 UTC <TonySav17> @2PAC Biggie is ok and Frank Sinatra is another hero/idol of mine.  I may be 32 years old but i know great music.  The crap that comes out today is not music, its simply crap.

But at least for the first time in my life time, more and more people have optimism for the country for once.

This time last year the news broke that Amazon Prime was picking up the Robert Stack seasons thanks to the company @filmrisetv getting the rights to the show.  But either way, enjoy all 12 seasons.  It was fun tho as each season came out by month in 2017

943626677724295170 2017-12-20 23:38:26 UTC <TonySav17> Merry Christmas America Democrats said that Companies weren't going to do anything with the Tax Cuts. WRONG AGAIN  AT&T - to invest $1 Billion in USA Wells Fargo - Raises Wages to $15/HR Boeing - $300 Million to Employees  How long can Democrats be Wrong and Anti America?
943623656269377536 2017-12-20 23:26:25 UTC <TonySav17> @TheRealDisco and by the way, the only way that could even be true, is in expectation of this tax bill, not because of some union agreement.  It wouldn't be brought to the table in the first place if this Tax Bill had not even been part of Trumps campaign promises.

I believe we have been told a lot of bs about Edison who most likely stole ideas from Tesla.  Just like Einstein was not really THAT INTELLIGENT.https://twitter.com/DRUDGE_REPORT/status/931476265076342785

I listen to very intelligent independent studies into policy making and tax reforms etc.  I also hope you all are thinking about what is happening in Saudi Arabia and new war about to break out.  Wake up.

The average speed limit here in Ohio of 60 and 65 on the freeways, well, that usually means many drivers are already going 5 to 10 over those limits lol.  Idiotic article here.

920728085649154048 2017-10-18 19:07:36 UTC <TonySav17> @WWEgames, reversals in this game are ridiculous, the A.I. does it every other move making this game not fun.
920722298860171264 2017-10-18 18:44:36 UTC <TonySav17> @WWEgames Braun S. does not smile and do what you guys got him doing during a promo in this game, game is overall WAY TOO SLOW!  Come on.

783524780238630913 2016-10-04 04:30:39 UTC <TonySav17> @breakurban I can not understand how people of your age will continue to think this way. No wonder my generation and younger ones are dying.
783524400758984704 2016-10-04 04:29:08 UTC <TonySav17> @breakurban omg, please do not say anyone is wasting their vote for someone other than the establishment and they believe in, typical voter.

783519358287052800 2016-10-04 04:09:06 UTC <TonySav17> @breakurban no honey.  I am afraid for my generation and the younger generations because of people like @HillaryClinton, @BarackObama.
783518964769026048 2016-10-04 04:07:32 UTC <TonySav17> Twitter seriously sucks since they limit the right to freedom of speech by only giving you so many letters to type per status.  FUCK YOU!
783518609997979648 2016-10-04 04:06:08 UTC <TonySav17> Isn't it cool when you think you can give someone the benefit of the doubt and trust them because you got good vibes from that person? FUCKU

783518107990102016 2016-10-04 04:04:08 UTC <TonySav17> @breakurban or is that all just the "alt-right" conspiracies?  CIA was brilliant to start that trendy word after they killed JFK.
783517874900041733 2016-10-04 04:03:13 UTC <TonySav17> @breakurban So you are seriously going to vote for @HillaryClinton when it is well known about all her crimes?
783517448658124801 2016-10-04 04:01:31 UTC <TonySav17> @breakurban What works out well for me?  The fact I know my history and re-taught many things I was lied to about in our schools?
783513401779712003 2016-10-04 03:45:26 UTC <TonySav17> @HillaryClinton Ha Bill stopped raping women yet?  The ones you go after and threaten not to speak out?  Feel so bad for your supporters.

783512524754935808 2016-10-04 03:41:57 UTC <TonySav17> @breakurban Kaine constantly interrupted as much as he could.  Pence spoke exactly how he should of.
783512237046628353 2016-10-04 03:40:48 UTC <TonySav17> @breakurban Anyone who got to be apart of the Ron Paul Revolution would never settle for anyone not living on that man's convictions/honesty
783511983417098240 2016-10-04 03:39:48 UTC <TonySav17> @breakurban Hillary has also been behind genocide and plenty of wars.  She is globalist scum.  I am not voting Trump, I am @RonPaul guy.
783511624502153216 2016-10-04 03:38:22 UTC <TonySav17> @breakurban not sure if that is all fact.  Or if that is what Hillary is telling you to believe, after all, she is so honest lol.
783511336273768448 2016-10-04 03:37:14 UTC <TonySav17> Hope you get through this shit Kid Cudi, I know what you are going through.  I can not afford a rehab though. http://uproxx.com/realtalk/kid-cudi-checks-into-rehab-depression-suicide/
