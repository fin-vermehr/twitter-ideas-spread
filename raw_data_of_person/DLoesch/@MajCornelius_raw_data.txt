967010444274814976 2018-02-23 12:17:10 UTC <MajCornelius> @TheLastRefuge2 This sounds just like Obamas Restorative Justice Program (aka Excellence in African American Education) to break the School-To-Prison Pipeline. The end result is a significant increase in school violence.

Prior to 1985, alcohol fueled fights, DUIs, etc. where no big deal. After 85 that all changed.

In 1981 I enlisted in the USMC as a private and spent the 1st 9 of 22 years as an enlisted Marine. Pvt, Pfc, LCpl, Cpl, Sgt, SSgt, W1, CWO2, CWO3, Captain, Major.

I still have the 22 my father bought me when I was twelve. Military service is voluntary. How do you think the military deals with personal weapons on military installations? Any idea?

965613850161803264 2018-02-19 15:47:36 UTC <MajCornelius> @Liz_Wheeler I agree with what youre saying but...A 20 year old Marine would still be on his first enlistment, likely not married, and living in the barracks. Ownership, possession & and storage of personal weapons is tightly controlled on military installations.

959462122978672642 2018-02-02 16:22:50 UTC <MajCornelius> @FBI @TheJusticeDept @JeffFlake Youre an elected official trying to prevent the unmasking of government officials who are potentially involved in illegal surveillance & unmasking of American citizens.
959458941758525440 2018-02-02 16:10:12 UTC <MajCornelius> @DineshDSouza @dbongino @JackieSharp Youre obviously desperate if youre trying to equate our CIA Agents being unmasked to our foreign enemies with the DOJ/FBI potentially abusing citizens 4th Amendment Rights?

959403358879715334 2018-02-02 12:29:20 UTC <MajCornelius> Someone please remind Democrats that the @FBI isnt its own branch of government and the Chairman of House Intel Committee has the constitutional authority for Congressional Oversight of the DOJ/FBI, and the authority/Responsibility to document their findings. #ReleaseTheMemohttps://twitter.com/nancypelosi/status/959117243463413761

959250999016939521 2018-02-01 02:23:54 UTC <MajCornelius> @marsters_don Well there you go. Youre mind is made up.
959250467577573376 2018-02-01 02:21:48 UTC <MajCornelius> @marsters_don The FBI doesnt want this memo exposed because it destroys the credibility of the agents involved. If Agents lied or lied by omission at the FISA court, all their cases will called into question. These same Agents handled the Hillary email case.
959249389691731968 2018-02-01 02:17:31 UTC <MajCornelius> @marsters_don We have the FBI spying on a political campaign and a President, and there doesnt appear to be valid for the spying. Illegal spying and ignoring constitutional oversight are bigger threats to our constitution than all the other noise.
959248223494967297 2018-02-01 02:12:53 UTC <MajCornelius> @marsters_don Why should he be in jail? I dont support Illegal conduct by elected officials or civil servants, and Trump hasnt violated any laws.
959245958998581248 2018-02-01 02:03:53 UTC <MajCornelius> @marsters_don It appears that you cant identify any good qualities in Trump. Im certainly not going to change your opinion. If you wont support him, arent you unintentionally supporting the DNC?
959245103008186369 2018-02-01 02:00:29 UTC <MajCornelius> @marsters_don Young children shouldnt be exposed to politics. No where is it written that you have to like or agree with everything he says or does and you seem capable of addressing his pros/cons with young adults. After his SOTU address the GOP looks pretty strong.
959229955379998720 2018-02-01 01:00:17 UTC <MajCornelius> @mitchellreports News flash Congressional Oversight Committees dont have to justify their oversight actions to anyone but the people.
959228833928007681 2018-02-01 00:55:50 UTC <MajCornelius> @Comey The creditably of the FBI Agents who used the phony Dossier to obtain a FISA warrant to spy on POTUS is about to be destroyed. These same Agents were/are involved in the Hillary email, Flynn & Page cases,the memo will likely blowup the entire scam being perpetrated against POTUS.

959221158498488320 2018-02-01 00:25:20 UTC <MajCornelius> @marsters_don What does refusing to support him after hes already won the election accomplish?
959220710202904577 2018-02-01 00:23:33 UTC <MajCornelius> @marsters_don Don, I wanted Ted Cruz to win the Primary, but he didnt. Whether or not he deserves to be President is irrelevant. He won the primary & general, character flaws and all. He believes in America & the constitution, and wants to make American lives better.
