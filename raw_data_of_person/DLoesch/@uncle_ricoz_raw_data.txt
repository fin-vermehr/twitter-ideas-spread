939985904248090625 2017-12-10 22:31:18 UTC <uncle_ricoz> @dmac1043 Best part about this season has been the sleep Ive been getting during these games

938777770166906880 2017-12-07 14:30:36 UTC <uncle_ricoz> @dmac1043 No good fa ol this year. Screw developing a qb for the next couple of years. Get cousins, draft ol in first and get a dam pass rusher on the d line to feed miller and Barrett them sacks! Im all in on Butt-Cousins
933421886721081344 2017-11-22 19:48:14 UTC <uncle_ricoz> @EdLatimore All it takes is one person to fuck it up, and a lawyer

932727674576846848 2017-11-20 21:49:41 UTC <uncle_ricoz> @CecilLammey Lol. Elway isnt drafting a QB. Its going to be Cousins all the way. You like that!!! It will be an offensive lineman.
932609799472082944 2017-11-20 14:01:17 UTC <uncle_ricoz> @Altitude950 @VicLombardi Elway just tryin to stoke the fire. He did do it under Fox. I think VJ lacks the hair on fire trait. Now all the soft players are coming out on social media against Elway.
930099489884454912 2017-11-13 15:46:13 UTC <uncle_ricoz> @dmac1043 I think there is no confidence in this team. Lack of leadership from coaches to players. Talent isnt there on offense. They pass the buck saying they have to be better 2 b better and they wont be better. Season is over. Offseason will b

929725179411836928 2017-11-12 14:58:50 UTC <uncle_ricoz> @RealAlexJones I just wonder about the George Bushs. They have been attacking Trump, whats in their closet?

929012528390090754 2017-11-10 15:47:01 UTC <uncle_ricoz> @YouTube @handymayhem Lol hell no. He had his chance last year with the broncos and he blew it. Season over roll with that pirate. Cant be worse than Tebow. McCoy should install that Tebow offense and just run the dam ball they cant pass block anyways

922836193976315907 2017-10-24 14:44:28 UTC <uncle_ricoz> @dmac1043 Paxton doesnt need to throw in a Tebow offense. I lied he needs to throw at least 4 passes a game
922465998518681601 2017-10-23 14:13:27 UTC <uncle_ricoz> @WayneDupreeShow I feel for this woman. She must of felt alone, sad, depressed. But she was vulnerable. It seems dems took advantage of her. Money talks...
922258725829730304 2017-10-22 00:29:49 UTC <uncle_ricoz> @1043TheFan @CecilLammey Just run the rock. Who better qb Lynch or Tebow? Sad to say that but I dont think there is any better options
