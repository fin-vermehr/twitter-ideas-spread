958443526991351809 2018-01-30 20:55:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @UNITEDWEDREAM Why not immigrate legally, along with thousands of other people? Breaking the law is a choice. #LegalImmigrants
958442694463942658 2018-01-30 20:52:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @UNITEDWEDREAM America belongs to Americans, not illegal aliens. Sorry, but you have no political rights in this country and never will. If you care so much about having a voice, become a citizen legally. #LegalImmigrants #MAGA

957323765205143552 2018-01-27 18:45:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @UNITEDWEDREAM Maybe his parents should have immigrated legally. That would have avoided the problem.

956277842672799746 2018-01-24 21:29:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y It's really scary to know, as a fact, that someone as objectively stupid as @brhodes was in charge of ANYTHING in the government of our great nation.
956235706929643520 2018-01-24 18:42:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RealJamesWoods Sessions is a cagey operator and shouldn't be underestimated...
955923523381420032 2018-01-23 22:01:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum I'd like to think about the Russian interference, but there just isn't all that much to think about.

955099042534608897 2018-01-21 15:25:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ClarkMindock Are you talking about ILLEGAL immigrants? It's really confusing, since the whole article refers to "immigrants" without any qualification.
954477378679558144 2018-01-19 22:15:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jordanbpeterson There should be costs to being obtuse -- just not ones with violent implications.

953687667513942016 2018-01-17 17:57:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Democrats literally have no idea what the word "compromise" means. By definition they have to give up something.
953680490061533189 2018-01-17 17:28:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum I think he was fired for leaking. BUHBYE

953482908689485824 2018-01-16 04:23:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Dave_M_Brooks It's neither reporting nor speculating - it's obsessing.

953419422361931776 2018-01-16 00:11:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Not a very good point... seriously. Think harder next time.

952066964268122112 2018-01-12 06:37:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Yes, lot's of inconsequential detail to satisfy know-nothing journalists. Oh, so much golf too!

951947739759292418 2018-01-12 22:43:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @vtg2 What a funny left-wing blog run by retards in department store suits.

951922560882626561 2018-01-12 21:03:19 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @ericgeller @WhiteMosees @chivacongelado You think nothing she learned working on Pakistan might be transferable to other countries? Are you really that stupid?
951920971144933377 2018-01-12 20:57:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @ericgeller @MJtheProphet But their family came from somewhere else. Asking where is taking interest in that person. It's called friendly conversation. You've probably never been engaged in it.
951920369774022656 2018-01-12 20:54:36 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @ericgeller @MJtheProphet That's actually called having working eyesight and two functioning brain cells.

951919723960258563 2018-01-12 20:52:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @ericgeller @MJtheProphet Because everyone with half a brain knows Asians are not native to Manhattan and thus their provenance is other than New York.
951916618313093125 2018-01-12 20:39:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TGowdySC I think this is all rather settled... not sure why you feel the need to belabor it.
951914338415185922 2018-01-12 20:30:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @ericgeller @MJtheProphet You're right. He should have just assumed she was Chinese and called it a day.

951911816455696384 2018-01-12 20:20:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @ericgeller you're not blowing anyone away with your skills either dear boy.
951910578255167488 2018-01-12 20:15:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @ericgeller He allegedly asked where "your people" are from - parents, grandparents, etc. You must be a joy to chitchat with...
951906144544534528 2018-01-12 19:58:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @ericgeller There is literally nothing sinister about asking where someone's family is from. You've all gone totally batshit crazy.

947561340612247552 2017-12-31 20:13:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising Attacks on Sessions are really unfair... he is doing exactly what everyone has criticized others of not doing: acting according to the law. He knows what evidence exists and knows if a case can be made. Acting imprudently is a recipe for disaster.

939897852813299712 2017-12-10 16:41:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @PressSec Obama should ride off into the sunset and retain the shred of dignity he has left.

939580103356383232 2017-12-09 19:38:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @leighmunsil I love global warming too.
939574347823431680 2017-12-09 19:15:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks What happened? They can't read and their "sources" can't read. I'd say there is a book forthcoming, but... they can't read.
939573852803186688 2017-12-09 19:13:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ChuckRossDC @CNN is a joke from top to bottom. With any luck, they will go out of business and our brain cells will -- hopefully -- have a chance to regenerate.
939573344503869440 2017-12-09 19:11:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @alivitali HAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHA! #FAKENEWSCNN
939572766130388992 2017-12-09 19:09:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RealJamesWoods Man, I wonder if that kids psychiatrist bills are covered by Obamacare?
939572164323241984 2017-12-09 19:07:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Big indicator of poor judgement and basement living...
939572054679891968 2017-12-09 19:06:48 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @IngrahamAngle But Laura, there were protests. He should have given in. That's how this game is played. What a novice!
939571750613917697 2017-12-09 19:05:36 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y The history recording the hostile takeover of our country will begin with: "As Americans were consumed by animus toward one another over triviality..."
939546674631909376 2017-12-09 17:25:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RealJamesWoods Low IQ Mika never disappoints...
939533789042130944 2017-12-09 16:34:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders Trump is a loyal android user. #fakenews
939532631095443457 2017-12-09 16:30:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y The objective lack of concern for maintaining their credibility leads me to believe "news" is more entertainment than anyone fully realizes...
939519954809786369 2017-12-09 15:39:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume It's damning. That's what it is. Waiting for the photo to come out...
939509825150500864 2017-12-09 14:59:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume If the roles were reversed, this would be "Stalinist investigating of political rivals"... but instead any questioning of how this can happen is simply "obstruction of justice". Cute.
939505420128862209 2017-12-09 14:42:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @IngrahamAngle It's funny how Obama promotes democracy and "voter engagement", but reserves the right to undermine the result if it doesn't suit his fancy.
939501493597507584 2017-12-09 14:26:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Seems it's much easier to find evidence of paranormal phenomena than Russian collusion. A scam of cosmic proportions if there ever was one...
939494819268739072 2017-12-09 13:59:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y If I had to bet, the team of hack lawyers is Trump's human shield of disposable fall guys... It wasn't me! My - now fired - lawyers screwed up!
939493648344932352 2017-12-09 13:55:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Are Scully and Mulder available?

939180665810980864 2017-12-08 17:11:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @tribelaw Oh, you have a book to push! Now it makes sense.

939154234146037760 2017-12-08 15:26:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks @JulianAssange There is no "story" too trivial or too inaccurate for CNN not to "report".

939142363775082496 2017-12-08 14:39:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @AlanDersh Larry should seek help. I'm serious.
939084218323296256 2017-12-08 10:48:19 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y In today's America, the side who yells louder and has the least shame, usual wins. Dems, I'm looking at you.
938810088222900224 2017-12-07 16:39:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller My gut says he will attempt suicide after giving a short speech.
938780194076102656 2017-12-07 14:40:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ScottMGreer What isn't disposable these days? Was only a matter of time before "history" got the axe.
938779816018321409 2017-12-07 14:38:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @AlanDersh Alan, we owe you an enormous debt of gratitude for being one of the most lucid and credible defenders of sanity.
938774786804551680 2017-12-07 14:18:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BennettJonah I'd imagine you'd get mostly blank stares and requests to clarify is South Africa is a different country than Africa.

938447180532146178 2017-12-06 16:36:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BennettJonah Man, he's ugly.
938422269470171141 2017-12-06 14:57:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Dave_M_Brooks The left's obsession with exterminating the unborn is bordering on psychotic.
938413603476029441 2017-12-06 14:23:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @HillaryClinton @FBI @CNN @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Sessions likely knows things we don't. Those things will either build up to some big changes/prosecutions or will allow the DoJ to avert a humiliating debacle.
938396070068985856 2017-12-06 13:13:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @FBI @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y But everything just seems so sinister when R's do it... weird how that works.
938026194607284224 2017-12-05 12:44:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @IngrahamAngle So @realDonaldTrump was more right than wrong... figures!
938007701145006080 2017-12-05 11:30:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JasonMillerinDC Do the Dems not understand they lost the election? Seems there is a mental health crisis on the Hill...
937895458470486016 2017-12-04 04:04:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @IngrahamAngle Jeff Zuker!
937759326134923264 2017-12-04 19:03:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @AlanDersh Sad that everyone has become so hysterical over such nonsense.
937738896703610882 2017-12-04 17:42:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Moore vs. a socialist puppet? Not much of a choice.
937733939262664704 2017-12-04 17:22:48 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume I've known Byron a long time... he's an even-tempered straight shooters... that's what we need more than ever.
937730253367140353 2017-12-04 17:08:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @YouTube @brithume At the trial - which the MSM insists is coming - will this trump a tweet or are they roughly equivalent?
937729081398849537 2017-12-04 17:03:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller @BennettJonah Now if only they could figure out a way to quit crashing ships in the Pacific...
937718514927800321 2017-12-04 16:21:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ScottMGreer My wallet caught fire and pet budgie died. Coincidence? I think not.
937718210710839296 2017-12-04 16:20:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kellymcb @Acosta thinks his opinion is "news"... fake news seems apt.
937714932635680769 2017-12-04 16:07:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BennettJonah The guy is 8 feet tall with a bruised ego... how can he not be high and mighty?
937714274863955969 2017-12-04 16:04:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta @viaCristiano No, you don't. You continue to do your job!
937714062506409984 2017-12-04 16:03:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @mlcalderone I would probably help if @Acosta actually knew what freedom of the press entails. He thinks it means "say whatever you want without criticism from anyone".
937713609148264448 2017-12-04 16:02:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume Byron wrote an excellent piece. Anyone who disagrees is a fool.
937705717728813056 2017-12-04 15:30:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y The Logan Act is best viewed as a tool used by liberals to smear the Trump administration - it's a talking point whose only valid use is planting a seed of distrust in Americans who casually watch CNN, MSNBC and hear the chattering class chatter with one ear.
937689400909094912 2017-12-04 14:25:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum UNPROVEN ALLEGATIONS FROM FOUR DECADES AGO. PROVE IT OR SHUT UP!
937514277656707072 2017-12-03 02:49:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @dangainor Shame on anyone who listens to or reads what this woman produces. She's clearly an idiot.

937373386723934208 2017-12-03 17:30:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Idiotic, halfassed assertions like those being made by @Evan_McMullin make me questions the competence and sanity of those working in the IC. Recruitment and retention practices are in need of urgent review!

937352851105366016 2017-12-03 16:08:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y The Russia investigation is basically a face-saving exercise at the point - get some people charged so it doesn't look like what it is: a huge waste of time and money.
937352193266532352 2017-12-03 16:05:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RealJamesWoods The last TV newsman I could actually trust was Peter Jennings
936953742670229504 2017-12-02 13:42:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y A big part of this mess is having over-eager anti-Trump journalists who know nothing about the law, pronouncing loudly when that law has been broken.
936947352761274368 2017-12-02 13:17:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @nbc @JoeNBC @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y I'm still wondering when Morning Joe will come clean and admit their whole run was a parody designed to mock sanity and civility in public discourse.
936946284950274048 2017-12-02 13:12:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @VP @ElizLanders @markknoller You know @realDonaldTrump has 44 million followers... no one depends on your retweets for POTUS news....
936930634689273857 2017-12-02 12:10:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Bad analysis. Really, really bad. SAD!
936674941017010176 2017-12-01 19:14:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller Those guys are wearing costumes...

936672706287644673 2017-12-01 19:05:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller I delight in Hillary not being president.
936635255842156547 2017-12-01 16:37:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @abcnews @DailyCaller @amber_athey And discuss what with the Russians?
936634869907460096 2017-12-01 16:35:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @GenFlynn @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Steinle's killer gets off and Flynn gets locked up for trying to avoid nuclear holocaust? When will this nightmare end...
936631353990266880 2017-12-01 16:21:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @AliWatkins He ASKED A QUESTION. Comey admitted he didn't feel pressured even if it was unusual for him.
936624980372029440 2017-12-01 15:56:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @politico @MatthewNussbaum It's actually a pretty short story: Nothing happened.
936624428309299200 2017-12-01 15:54:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller These people all need to retire.
936623537544093696 2017-12-01 15:50:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Oh, so all this is about averting nuclear Holocaust? Scandle of the century!
936605912445227008 2017-12-01 14:40:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising Ya, but those people aren't all valedictorian Navy SEALs like Dreamers are, so...
936591520257359872 2017-12-01 13:43:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SenAngusKing @ElizLanders Some of these people are just idiots.
936266596854538241 2017-11-30 16:12:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Wow... what a waste of ink.
936254459004338176 2017-11-30 15:23:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Fact is, Jim, you'd feel more at home in Cuba or North Korea than here in the USA.
936251502359863296 2017-11-30 15:12:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Because so-called "experts" are right on so very much lately?
936241151803142144 2017-11-30 14:30:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y So, if you're a liberal goofball, you can grope women for DECADES with no consequence? Nice going, Democrats.
936234449431273472 2017-11-30 14:04:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @SamCoatesTimes Trump loves it. Who cares if idiots (the UK) call him names?
936203635112820736 2017-11-30 12:01:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @NewDay @ElizLanders Pocahontas is not a slur. If anything, Warren is the disgusting one in that story.
936198089651580929 2017-11-30 11:39:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders Is the crux of your reporting that two things can happen at the same time?
935926698939260928 2017-11-29 17:41:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta They would have been stupid questions anyway...
935703637795340289 2017-11-28 02:55:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @POLITICO_Steve He won when you said he couldn't. He must know something you don't.

935174599511302144 2017-11-27 15:52:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @AlanDersh Poor Laurence...
935165074238455813 2017-11-27 15:15:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta The US government doesn't control the media. If they did, you wouldn't be able to spout your bullshit day in and day out...
935155839362523138 2017-11-27 14:38:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @AlanDersh We're judging lawyers by what they do for their clients? Some people are missing some basic facts about how our judicial system works.

934831651565137920 2017-11-26 17:10:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNN @ElizLanders One senile old bat talking nonsense about another senile old bat.
934818083587231744 2017-11-26 16:16:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NancyPelosi @IngrahamAngle This interview is conclusive evidence that the fix is in with the media in favor of the Democrats... No Republican could ever get away with saying something so offensively stupid.
934817362196316160 2017-11-26 16:13:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @realDonaldTrump states the political facts as he sees them... you drew your own conclusion. You need to be clear about that.
934773745964654594 2017-11-26 13:20:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders You're entitled to your OPINION.

934623438534148096 2017-11-25 03:22:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Ya, CNN brought it to their attention...
934620398930423808 2017-11-25 03:10:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume Give me a break...
934615842519638016 2017-11-25 02:52:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf You're transitioning.
934437093132066816 2017-11-25 15:02:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JasonMillerinDC Using Russia as cover to make lasting change. Smart.

934031150728675328 2017-11-24 12:09:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @ElizLanders Why do you re-tweet the president? I can read the original tweet.

933739154088779782 2017-11-23 16:48:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WashTimes @IngrahamAngle Someone should offer to bless these poor no-life atheists with nothing better to do.
933734738526797824 2017-11-23 16:31:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Vanity Fair... Really? God lord...
933730064386088960 2017-11-23 16:12:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RealJamesWoods Is the NYT still publishing?
933721732178780161 2017-11-23 15:39:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @HillaryClinton @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Oh, I hope she gets nailed from this.
933715133485813762 2017-11-23 15:13:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume Oh, so being a Congressman means you have to give up being human? I know the left wants us to all be conforming robots, but this is crazy.
933712290162937856 2017-11-23 15:02:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> Oh, he can. You just wait @Acosta... your days at @CNN are numbered.
933706428883152898 2017-11-23 14:38:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume It's not that unusual. He probably shouldn't resign - would set a troubling precedent. Revenge porn victims shouldn't be ruined because of it, even politicians.
933704520982437888 2017-11-23 14:31:19 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @ElizLanders Why are you so pissed when the President of the United States needs to work?
933702908863963136 2017-11-23 14:24:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @washingtonpost @nytimes @CNN @MSNBC @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y I predict the public will eventually grow weary of crooked news outlets... Reckoning is soon in the offing.
933666706525904898 2017-11-23 12:01:04 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders I BELIEVE THE WOMEN. HOW ABOUT YOU, @CNN ?
933549837391298560 2017-11-22 04:16:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @IngrahamAngle I hope @realDonaldTrump invites the North Korean soldier to the White House once he recovers.
933546864518971393 2017-11-22 04:04:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RealJamesWoods ONLY the second year... Might have a standards problem in addition to a criminal problem.
933545194653229056 2017-11-22 03:58:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @HeyTammyBruce said "jackass" and "idiot" in the same tweet. I'd express my love and admiration, but someone would probably report me.
933503083723743232 2017-11-22 01:10:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume @ByronYork Could it be, as well, because he is not a well man and has no place in government?
933366358275907584 2017-11-22 16:07:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNNPolitics @Acosta Start working on your CV... if televisions clowns have CVs that is...
933356649816846337 2017-11-22 15:29:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume What lunatic world have these people grown up in?!?
933342675985506304 2017-11-22 14:33:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume At what point do we just trow our hands up in the air and give up on human society? Seems that's the road we're on.
933328271512518656 2017-11-22 13:36:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @politicoalex @MatthewNussbaum Ya, because allegations after 40 YEARS just before an election doesn't ring any alarm bells.
933319567694209025 2017-11-22 13:01:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jeffzeleny @POTUS @ElizLanders See, he tweeted about it now. Are you satisfied? Be sure to let him know.
933317777330278400 2017-11-22 12:54:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @lsarsour @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Tony, she wears a hijab... the most effective protection against criticism known to Mankind.

933304402617671681 2017-11-22 12:01:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta OMG! THEY MIGHT HAVE TALKED TO RUSSIANS!!!!! SHOCKING!!!!
933302553067995136 2017-11-22 11:54:03 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump This whole year has been an early Christmas present for America! Thank you President Trump!
933294179643355136 2017-11-22 11:20:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Once Jeff Zucker is out, you'll be shown the door too.
933292678573318144 2017-11-22 11:14:48 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Shut up, Jim.
933287535551197184 2017-11-22 10:54:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @ElizLanders You're up at 5:30am tweeting about someone else up at 5:30am tweeting.
933287243652874241 2017-11-22 10:53:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @ElizLanders Who are you to judge the President?
933286351323119616 2017-11-22 10:49:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump SAD!!!
933282906864173056 2017-11-22 10:35:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNN @ElizLanders I love our President.
932951171064463361 2017-11-21 12:37:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Every American, including @POTUS , has the right to hold and share his or her own personal opinions. If memory serves, we might have some dusty old legal documents lying around saying as much...
932944963851108352 2017-11-21 12:13:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @GayleKing @biannagolodryga @ElizLanders @yashar In case you're wondering what that is, @CNN , it's called "integrity". You're welcome.
932849027032399872 2017-11-20 05:51:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller News commentary by 12 year old boys? Weird.
932832498047795200 2017-11-20 04:46:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @poppyme4 @AprilDRyan To the "U-S"? Stick to radio.
932681591146418176 2017-11-20 18:46:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @CeciliaVega @ElizLanders @alex_mallin Opps... sorry... need to yell in order for you to comprehend: DO YOU BELIEVE GLENN THRUSH'S ACCUSERS?!?!
932680437868019712 2017-11-20 18:41:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @CeciliaVega @ElizLanders @alex_mallin Do you believe Glenn Thrush's accusers?
932678801418477568 2017-11-20 18:35:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @CeciliaVega @ElizLanders @alex_mallin Why are you guys so arrogant as to assume you deserve answers to every shouted question?
932672473308438528 2017-11-20 18:10:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf It suggests, actually, that those who behave badly abroad and show no awareness of the work done to help them, might deserve to be left to fend for themselves.
932667432824594432 2017-11-20 17:50:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KenPaxtonTX @MatthewNussbaum @joshgerstein I think innocent-until-proven-guilty is a rule of life...
932643827768205312 2017-11-20 16:16:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @mlcalderone HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!
932640290074124288 2017-11-20 16:02:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> Watching @AlanDersh talk about contemporary political issues is really rather moving, because you see a man trying with all his might to identify and suppress his own impulsive biases and see things how they really are, even if that conflicts with his long held political leanings
932639476903428096 2017-11-20 15:59:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @AlanDersh Not having "approved" views is something that has always made America great. It's surely disappointing to see groups of citizens pressurizing themselves and others to tow the line on certain political topics or risk personal and professional annihilation.
932639099655094272 2017-11-20 15:57:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> Sometimes it's alright to call people idiots... those attacking @AlanDersh because he won't mindlessly sing along with the choir are unquestionably idiots.
932636255732383744 2017-11-20 15:46:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising Good ol' Al... Senator/Subway groper.
932588275683831808 2017-11-20 12:35:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JasonMillerinDC So it's established he has a local role? ... other than sad clown?
932499598794375169 2017-11-19 06:43:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller GOOD.
932494500093616129 2017-11-19 06:23:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf Just say it with more clarity then.
932457747253157889 2017-11-19 03:57:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller SAD!
932457634719866880 2017-11-19 03:56:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf I have some notes to enhance your writing.
932449125559189505 2017-11-19 03:22:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @AlanDersh Alan, this is @brianstelter we're talking about. You'd have better luck reasoning with your TV screen.
932292200460718080 2017-11-19 16:59:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Only two minutes? That's not very presidential!!! 
932247961421078528 2017-11-19 14:03:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Lavarbigballer @JasonMillerinDC Trump is amazing at getting people back.
932246200975220737 2017-11-19 13:56:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BillClinton @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y AG Sessions just addressed this issue quoting Lincoln:https://youtu.be/2BquVVJkO48?t=8m10s
931940428332417024 2017-11-18 17:41:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf The answer is always Newark. Geez..
931940317758087168 2017-11-18 17:41:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNN @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Pro tip: Don't forget your truckproof vest before heading out to your local German Christmas market.
931939985246130176 2017-11-18 17:39:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNN @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Clearly most respondents were prospective refugees.
931937981681692672 2017-11-18 17:31:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @washingtonpost @MSNBC @CNN @nytimes @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Got to hand it to them, their recipe for politics is pretty amazing. Pretending to care about people and issues is easier than actually caring. If someone doubts your bona fides, ruin their life. It's really brilliant.
931936946372218880 2017-11-18 17:27:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf The answer is always Newark.
931936842097704962 2017-11-18 17:27:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume Treating citizens like babies is a one way road to disaster. The aim is to be fair, remember?
931928667910844416 2017-11-18 16:54:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @WSJ @JasonMillerinDC The President was effective at making them see it is either NK or us... it didn't take long for Asia to pick a winner.
931924994338177024 2017-11-18 16:40:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y With a name like Flake, and a personality to match, the campaign ads write themselves.
931916056494407680 2017-11-18 16:04:36 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @JDiamond1 You guys need to get a life.
931915909500952576 2017-11-18 16:04:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @FoxNews @PeteHegseth @KrisFried @PlanetTyrus @KatTimpf @greggutfeld @GregGutfeldShow Where were you yesterday. I looked all over the dial for you.
931915772628148224 2017-11-18 16:03:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Interesting comment on US society where prominent individuals go out of their way to bring shame on themselves and their country... and for what? An elaborate virtue signaling session? To quote a great man: SAD!
931903167754678272 2017-11-18 15:13:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @dangallo I think determining if the yearbook signature is real or not is more relevant than any question a reporter might ask. What would you ask him anyway? Did you do it?
931569157572661249 2017-11-17 17:06:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @betsy_klein "The fake media doesn't deserve heat, but winter is coming."
931542619695456256 2017-11-17 15:20:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y I'm surprised psychologists don't study this - what, exactly, does it take for some people to dump the Clinton's? They are objectively awful human beings, but command a bottomless army of minions to defend them, even when they are disgraced and powerless. It's truly weird.
931523272604135424 2017-11-17 14:03:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume @McCormickProf We all know it's partisan... it's going to be partisan no matter what... so just let it happen
931521934147272706 2017-11-17 13:58:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum One would imagine if you work at the pinnacle of government, you don't require much instruction to get the gist of it...
931520920895623168 2017-11-17 13:54:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Backstabbing traitors around every corner. Who knew?
931517974984376325 2017-11-17 13:42:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y He won't resign. He's not brave enough.
931384775436148736 2017-11-16 04:53:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume @PhilippeReines crowning achievement is a quote about him from  John Podesta, who misspelled his name. SAD!
931368792726179840 2017-11-16 03:49:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NationalNOW @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y The fact that these liberal men behave badly in plain view exposes the rampant hypocrisy about such issues among the left. That's a big deal, especially if the avalanche of allegations continues.
931361974058811392 2017-11-16 03:22:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders I guess the distinction between 40 yr old allegations and a recent photograph of the assault taking place is too subtle for you to pick-up on.
931360023992610817 2017-11-16 03:15:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders Where is the photograph is Moore's case? Do you have it?
931353582619705346 2017-11-16 02:49:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising Wonder when she will finally transition.
931212416230158336 2017-11-16 17:28:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders @Phil_Mattingly Don't yell at @realDonaldTrump
931200814546223104 2017-11-16 16:42:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @tedlieu @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Part of the human experience is recognizing that some people should just be ignored when it comes to certain topics.
931200286957256704 2017-11-16 16:40:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @tedlieu @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Tony isn't afraid to call idiots idiots. That makes him a national hero in my book.
931188824876630016 2017-11-16 15:54:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @BresPolitico There are allegations against Roy Moore... this is a picture of @alfranken sexually abusing a sleeping women.
931177488562012161 2017-11-16 15:09:48 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @HillaryClinton @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Being a political rival is not a grant of immunity. Seems like a pretty obvious - and solid - counter to the left's talking points.
931161669388058626 2017-11-16 14:06:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @gdebenedetti Please, tell us the path to victory! You're soooo good at getting those right!
931052310058360833 2017-11-15 06:52:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ddale8 @ElizLanders You are really doing your beleaguered profession no favors by posting stuff like this.
930931539558375424 2017-11-15 22:52:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KristinFisher Why is it only the liberal television media freaked out about this? Is it that they are just dumber than the rest of us, or something deeper?
930857838779416577 2017-11-15 17:59:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @tedlieu @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y You're living the good life! True freedom is being able to call morons idiots.
930850569899540480 2017-11-15 17:30:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf What? Your perfect love match awaits...

930841470549966848 2017-11-15 16:54:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume Hey, only 20 years late.
930841205256028160 2017-11-15 16:53:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume The real issue is people now, for some reason, expect intelligent, independent woman to have a pierced nose and dress like a hobo. If you don't, well, all options are on the table.
930828081144643585 2017-11-15 16:01:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume You're right, I don't remember.
930825619574702080 2017-11-15 15:51:36 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising Maybe she wrote the book as insurance - she's in the spotlight, so harder to knock her off.
930825437801877504 2017-11-15 15:50:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising Why? Everything is cool, man... relax... Donna is will be fine, until that prescription overdose one rainy night in December.
930800324863967232 2017-11-15 14:11:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y That' can't be real.

930786369416204289 2017-11-15 13:15:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Is "reality" still the applicable standard?
930468640415031296 2017-11-14 16:13:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @HillaryClinton @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y A great many so-called "norms" of American politics are idiotic and should be ignored. Good on @POTUS for doing it.

930434202356498433 2017-11-14 13:56:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y News networks should not be allowed to transition into 24 hour video blogs without clearly informing the viewing public.
930431989039034368 2017-11-14 13:47:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @marthamaccallum @FoxNews @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y How anyone can take Clapper seriously is a mystery to me. The man obviously doesn't have the wattage to be on TV.
930431657357672448 2017-11-14 13:46:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @tedlieu @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Forthcoming progressive talking point: Obviously we need comprehensive electoral reform... get rid of the electoral college... national security Russia!!
930330370599350272 2017-11-13 07:03:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta If they leaked such a BS "concern", they obviously aren't much of an ally. #FAKENEWS

930283284478746629 2017-11-13 03:56:33 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y The liberal race to the bottom is clearly well underway.
930275975308259328 2017-11-13 03:27:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNN @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Desert Storm... OJ... Oklahoma City... 9/11... CNN actually covered those things.
930264676918685696 2017-11-13 02:42:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume @brhodes honestly believes there is "no reason"... just like Putin thinks he did nothing wrong. Sadly, the irony is probably lost on that dullard.
930069913867132928 2017-11-13 13:48:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @AlanDersh Extremism - full stop - is always dangerous.
929953870398160897 2017-11-12 06:07:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders What do you care about human rights in the Philippines anyway? You don't live there and you're not a citizen...
929950952840355841 2017-11-12 05:55:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders You people ask questions at inappropriate times and are surprised when you don't get an answer. Not sure why...
929948051472601093 2017-11-12 05:44:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Trump let him... as opposed to what?
929947911701512192 2017-11-12 05:43:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Try being respectful and honest. You might get a different reaction.
929888167141896192 2017-11-12 01:46:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BarackObama @POTUS @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y James Clapper is such a simpleton it's truly amazing he is guest anywhere other than a little girls tea party.
929887551577456640 2017-11-12 01:44:03 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising The man is an idiot who is being manipulated by the disgusting pigs who run #fakenews @CNN
929886307676909569 2017-11-12 01:39:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume @wrmead James Clapper is a well-known idiot who should not be allowed on television.
929762157532549120 2017-11-12 17:25:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume As with @realDonaldTrump people often don't tell pollsters what they really think. That's done in the voting booth.
929761405405839361 2017-11-12 17:22:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Not going to rant about human rights abuses or treatment of women? Seems weird for you... I guess @realDonaldTrump didn't tweet about it, so not THAT interesting...
929754249835167744 2017-11-12 16:54:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume Another commentator who is in need of a brain MRI.
929751878568525824 2017-11-12 16:44:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Why are you so myopically focused on election interference? Don't you think that you should be able to consider/focus on more than one thing at a time?
929719476869742593 2017-11-12 14:36:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Original Tweet with mistake: Trump said "people don't realize Russia has been very, very heavily  sanctioned" adding he's rather see a more "friendly posture."
929719294069391360 2017-11-12 14:35:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Sounds 100% reasonable.
929718024172552194 2017-11-12 14:30:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ChrisVanHollen @FoxNewsSunday Would be nice if there was actual evidence he committed a crime...
929717880614133760 2017-11-12 14:29:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta And...
929716576718168064 2017-11-12 14:24:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Russia is a major world power, not a useless climate change agreement. You should know the difference, but you're not very smart...
929716319901048834 2017-11-12 14:23:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders @CNNPolitics "slim and none" is nonsense. Clapper is an idiot who shouldn't be on TV... unless it is #FAKENEWS @CNN
929692603548704769 2017-11-12 12:49:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Dyson @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @MarrShow Stick to vacuum cleaners and fan-less fans.

929569823339642880 2017-11-11 04:41:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DavidMDrucker That's why you aren't a good reporter. #FAKENEWS
929568967949033473 2017-11-11 04:38:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Try not being so rude. Or did they not teach you that in Cuba?

929389835567054848 2017-11-11 16:46:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @AndrewRestuccia @MatthewNussbaum He didn't say he believes it, only that Putin seems honest saying it. You continue your interminable trek into ignorance and stupidity.
929380356536418304 2017-11-11 16:08:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @rkylesmith @KatTimpf grabbed my ass at a bar once, but I don't call up reporters trying to get her fired from Fox.
929379810052259841 2017-11-11 16:06:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf @rkylesmith I not sure when the standard of proof became "when your political opponents say you are a predator, you're a predator"... People accused of crimes have rights too.

929295929689047040 2017-11-11 10:33:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Clinton is a DC mobster and should be taken down along with all her enablers, like Podesta and his goofball brother.
929248006188048385 2017-11-10 07:22:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Collusion, collusion, collusion!!!
929044935096987648 2017-11-10 17:55:48 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume @guypbenson Because they waited THIRTY YEARS + to spill the beans... coincidentally during an election.
929038755662479361 2017-11-10 17:31:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume @guypbenson If it wasn't a big enough issue for you to tell the police after it happened, why should we accept people telling reporters thirty years later?
929031062377734146 2017-11-10 17:00:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @heatherscope So we just all believe some random women over common sense?
929024786411413504 2017-11-10 16:35:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @JessicaHuseman Trump grabbed my ass once in 1989 but you don't hear me whining about it.
929024092295983105 2017-11-10 16:32:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @JessicaHuseman Funny how all these "victims" go three decades+ and then suddenly need to unload to a reporter? Someone should call the men in white coats over at Hawkins Labs to look into this.
929023315582136321 2017-11-10 16:29:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @JessicaHuseman Because people lie every time vote harvesting time comes around. That's why.
929023124317782016 2017-11-10 16:29:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NRO @KatTimpf Always found your writing a bit uninspired - lacking in passion?
929022743055441920 2017-11-10 16:27:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Pretty sure innocent until proven guilty is just a good rule of life.
929022498368135168 2017-11-10 16:26:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Total lies.
928975767672823808 2017-11-10 13:20:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders Making weird Vietnamese shirts great again!
928877161892651009 2017-11-09 06:49:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Oh, so you admit China was "ripping" into the US under Obama. Interesting.
928873356295680002 2017-11-09 06:34:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Bencjacobs She had almost 50 years to raise her allegations... through Moore's 40 year political career... and they suddenly show up now. It's clearly lies.
928840605286907906 2017-11-09 04:23:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @TimJHanrahan So, people who lied say they didn't lie. Well, that settles it then!
928839542236315649 2017-11-09 04:19:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NickRiccardi Interesting use of periods for a man who writes for a living.
928839385738444800 2017-11-09 04:19:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum You wish you worked at Fox. Admit it.
928829510404804608 2017-11-09 03:39:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders That was a good movie. Impressed at the reference!
928656943157092352 2017-11-09 16:14:03 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @DavidNakamura What could you have possibly learned from a few off-topic questions by MSM reporters? Probably very little. You just need to find something to complain about, as usual.
928656502033809413 2017-11-09 16:12:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @DavidNakamura Making a fuss over ultimately meaningless questions is a waste of everyone's time and sows acrimony with the host. You don't get that, which is why you're a second-rate journalist not a world leader.
928649404025679872 2017-11-09 15:44:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @politico @Acosta I hope you get canned.
928649311738458112 2017-11-09 15:43:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta You do understand they can take your questions and just lie. You're sad.
928647244508684288 2017-11-09 15:35:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders What place did you get the duck? The usual place isn't the best.
928630489425920000 2017-11-09 14:28:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @JayCarney That's why Obama was unloaded like luggage the last time he was there. Good job.

928234299148591104 2017-11-08 12:14:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Go back to your own country and stop appropriating Chinese culture.
928192623428251651 2017-11-08 09:29:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MattRiversCNN @CNN What an ignorant comment. Are you seriously denigrating 1.6 billion people?

927607722241024000 2017-11-06 18:44:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller First abuse allegedly occurred in 2004... what motivated the sudden interest in her safety?

927510118010200067 2017-11-06 12:16:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta It's a joke.
927238269938540544 2017-11-05 18:16:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNN @ElizLanders Yet another example of women flourishing under a @realDonaldTrump presidency. #MAGA

927224169002975232 2017-11-05 17:20:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @billboard @greggutfeld Happened in Canada. Obviously they don't think the same up there.
927205848467750912 2017-11-05 16:07:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @poppyme4 @AlanDersh Sadly, even people who should know better think "collusion" is a criminal offense. Not conducive to intelligent discussion.
927205414365683712 2017-11-05 16:06:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @poppyme4 @AlanDersh It's obvious that AD challenges himself to be a straight arrow on these issues. What's clear is that he comes down on the side of truth.

926494766610628609 2017-11-03 17:02:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum The President, like every US citizen, is entitled to his opinion. That's how our country works, so stop being a dick about it.
926489523936100353 2017-11-03 16:41:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller When tired politicians play dumb to avoid awkward questions, don't they realize they look like idiots?

926151273115566080 2017-11-02 18:17:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta They got her by being a living human somewhere in the world. You can except a mixed bag...
926116620187049985 2017-11-02 15:59:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller Cuomo needs an MRI of his head. STAT.
926116201603805184 2017-11-02 15:58:03 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller Looks pretty white to me.
926089139727904768 2017-11-02 14:10:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta It says something that you have more outrage in your heart for @realDonaldTrump than for the ISIS terrorist who murdered your countrymen.
926088608309592064 2017-11-02 14:08:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Giving your opinion is protected by something called the Constitution.
926054500867043330 2017-11-02 11:52:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump Send him back to Uzbekistan and let them deal with him. No basketball and Playboy's in Uzbek prison.
925752225695010816 2017-11-01 15:51:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Because he already said he wanted to get rid of the visa lottery... so... it's not really a conversation, just reiteration.
925410940635332608 2017-10-31 17:15:36 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Vote Trump in 2020
925365922088435712 2017-10-31 14:16:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta So he was a prop for a photo... You're not much of a journalist Acosta...
925327798532677632 2017-10-31 11:45:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders Ah, CNN...
925296880963133440 2017-10-31 09:42:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller Who is going to determine what "can" means?
924660684905897984 2017-10-29 15:34:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RealJamesWoods There used to be a time when men in white jackets would chase these people around with a net. We need to get back to that...
924653929492758528 2017-10-29 15:07:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @poppyme4 @omriceren ALLEGEDLY hacked.... ALLEGEDLY.
924652262244233217 2017-10-29 15:00:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RealJamesWoods It's weird... I've never met anyone who thinks like some of the liberal nutcases... but they must be out there.
924643758217445376 2017-10-29 14:27:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum I guess all this would make more sense if Trump had more on him and Clinton had less.
924642036191412224 2017-10-29 14:20:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> I thank God every day that @realDonaldTrump is running America and not a gang of crooks lead by the Clinton's
924550052365795328 2017-10-29 08:14:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @politico You really think "scrambles" is the appropriate word?
924476622794735616 2017-10-28 03:22:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising Yearly MRI should be mandatory for these people...

921376022942982144 2017-10-20 14:02:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf What happened to your town car?
921375506150260736 2017-10-20 14:00:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @greggutfeld This woman is absolutely unbelievable. More unbelievable, though, is that anyone cares what she thinks or says.
921256173264707585 2017-10-19 06:06:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BillWeirCNN I wonder if @CNN will mention decades of mismanagement by PR gov and billions squandered which made the system so weak in 1st place.
920495378654404609 2017-10-17 03:42:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @tribelaw Funny that you attack a fellow citizen for exercising his right to free speech simply because you disagree with him. Irony.
917441296884568064 2017-10-09 17:27:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum It kinda does... the Dem interlocutor is a well-known douchebag without an ounce of fiscal sensibility, so he ought to shut up.

917067608028876802 2017-10-08 16:42:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf Harvey Weinstein in a bathrobe
917030494893510656 2017-10-08 14:14:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump He's a born loser!
916951372582359040 2017-10-08 09:00:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @IngrahamAngle Who rapes a 6 yr. old? Are we sure he's even human?
916923177330032640 2017-10-08 07:08:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MrDavidAngelo When I heard she was on the case, literately my first thought was "Doesn't Weinstein want to win?". Obviously he eventually thought that too
916692979250733058 2017-10-07 15:53:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @VP @ElizLanders Interesting. Did @POTUS cause the devastation and lack of power? From @CNN coverage, it seems he did.
915608221993148416 2017-10-04 16:03:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @BresPolitico Answer: Outrageously bad reporting from people who should know better, or at least have better things to do with their life.
915543100096782336 2017-10-04 11:44:19 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Congratulations for tweeting about a tweet. You are the real hero.

915258804064862208 2017-10-03 16:54:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta .@POTUS:  "I'd hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, you've thrown our budget a little  out of whack... That's fine. We've saved a lot of lives."
915226150699360257 2017-10-03 14:44:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta My thoughts every time I see you still work in television.
915225851230220296 2017-10-03 14:43:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum I can't wait until @realDonaldTrump blocks you.
915225669969129472 2017-10-03 14:42:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Oh, I wanted my Matty boy to be a doctor, but instead he's a journalist who's main accomplishment is spotting WH typos & tweeting about them
915225262677147648 2017-10-03 14:41:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders I guess they should have invested more than zero in infrastructure over the past two decades.
915193979209113602 2017-10-03 12:37:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum I'm so glad you have such an important position in life. You're really making the most of it.
915093223495786496 2017-10-02 05:56:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Pretty petty to point this out.
914942360533868544 2017-10-02 19:57:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNN @ElizLanders I'm pretty sure each victim is special in their own way. Not sure about the need to report each one though.

914158968204705792 2017-09-30 16:04:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MarcACaputo @MatthewNussbaum You criticize Trump for "having the time" to tweet... yet silent on the mayor of San Juan having time to get custom disaster swag made?pic.twitter.com/rW7pX5gLpZ
914156318985879553 2017-09-30 15:53:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @kylegriffin1 Ever consider that she may have conducted herself in a way deserving of criticism?
914156173502193666 2017-09-30 15:53:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @sbg1 Maybe write something else?
914155970527248384 2017-09-30 15:52:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @MarcACaputo Well how would you define it? I'll let you take the lead since you're a trained professional.
914154059145154562 2017-09-30 15:44:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MarcACaputo @MatthewNussbaum BTW who started the slinging criticism... Trump or that crazy mayor?
914153886113456129 2017-09-30 15:44:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MarcACaputo @MatthewNussbaum Why must it be "lashed out" vs. "fired back"? Do you see your own bias?
914149140296114177 2017-09-30 15:25:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Because the people of Puerto Rico aren't doing their fair share in the recovery effort. That's why.
914142881996193792 2017-09-30 15:00:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum WH says she was invited to FEMA command several times, but refused. Did you ever think to ask "why"?
914123311176499200 2017-09-30 13:42:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Might want to speak to the local truck drivers who aren't working to deliver aid supplies.

914116286312882176 2017-09-30 13:14:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @MarcACaputo For the record, the mayor sounds like a real bitch.
914091315159113728 2017-09-30 11:35:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump Puerto Rico needs to take responsibility for its own rebuilding. No one but mother nature to blame!

912653413606764544 2017-09-26 12:21:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Indira_L @Acosta @realDonaldTrump is clearly attacking unpatriotic and ill-conceived "protests"... What you are saying is both dumb and wrong.

908398769389002752 2017-09-14 18:35:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Only you would look at a solution and find the problem. I take it you're a Democrat?
908351707440021504 2017-09-14 15:28:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum As usual, journalists confused by nuance.

905768192466862080 2017-09-07 12:22:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum How is that a "dodge"? Why are you entitled to answers? Why do you constantly inject yourself into the running of the country?
905717604479680512 2017-09-07 09:01:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller Maybe if they acted like they actually belong to the President's party, they'd get more respect.
905485761511698432 2017-09-06 17:40:03 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta I guess you underestimated @realDonaldTrump . Maybe you should be more objective in future.

905408895606185984 2017-09-06 12:34:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum It's really entertaining to read your mindless observations about a person and phenomena you don't understand.
905375435839594496 2017-09-06 10:21:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller @amyschumer It seems there is a strong correlation between being fat and being part of the "resistance". Someone should look into it.
905345191946493952 2017-09-06 08:21:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Any felony or significant misdemeanor convictions disqualified applicants. In other words, misdemeanor convictions are allowed.

904003367772360705 2017-09-02 15:29:33 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TheDemocrats @RealJamesWoods Seriously! The correlation is obvious. At least they could be more subtle... maybe shill with some class.

902872063622316034 2017-08-30 12:34:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta But why didn't his buddy Putin respond immediately?
902871797447614464 2017-08-30 12:33:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller Most divisions in our country exist only in the minds of those telling us we are divided.
902550554445938693 2017-08-29 15:16:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller He is the most obsessively dumb person I've ever met.

902514879713599489 2017-08-29 12:54:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @ericgeller What a dumb article.
902207802642272256 2017-08-28 16:34:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @dlippman @jdawsey1 @MatthewNussbaum People are dying in Texas and you so-called "journalists" are messing around at work on a Tuesday morning. And you all call yourselves men?
902203984139567104 2017-08-28 16:19:26 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SebGorka @johncardillo You'd think there would be more mainstream concern over the sudden, dramatic rise of a domestic terrorist group that calls itself #Antifa
902199469315260416 2017-08-28 16:01:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNN @Acosta So...??
901852362712551425 2017-08-27 17:02:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising Not to mention the sign clearly says "yield"... of course, the antifa guy tweeting probably doesn't have a driver's license.
901851479471828993 2017-08-27 16:58:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising Of course the brave comrades at Antifa stopped to take a photo before helping untie the poor schmuck.
901851162751639552 2017-08-27 16:57:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SchreckReports @MatthewNussbaum @jdawsey1 Don't you find it odd that you literally spend your days looking for dirt on Trump and his family... is that really what journalists do?
901845061280735232 2017-08-27 16:33:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SebGorka A certain pedantic elite don't understand that most people don't want to exist in a social science experiment.

901147337535365120 2017-08-25 18:20:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Thanks Democrats!
901144815215104000 2017-08-25 18:10:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders So "might" means "must"?
901144303090532352 2017-08-25 18:08:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta @abbydphillip ya... ok... but what about the South Texas weather report?
901143498505691136 2017-08-25 18:05:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta dissatisfied with something the WH is doing... shock and awe!!!!!
901110276124139520 2017-08-25 15:53:26 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Hurricanes are caused by climate change?
901062051421863938 2017-08-25 12:41:48 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta So do you job properly and no one will care what he says.
901061936070115332 2017-08-25 12:41:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> Hopefully sacrificing @Acosta to the weather gods.
900977556098138112 2017-08-25 07:06:03 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @tanzinavega @Acosta The WH has no obligation to call on you. Get that through your head once and for all.

900705614866792448 2017-08-24 13:05:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller I'm worried Clapper has access to a television studio
900697686055075841 2017-08-24 12:33:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta @NickKristof Criticizing the press is the right of each and every citizen, including the President.
900695151047094272 2017-08-24 12:23:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @poppyme4 @politicalmath We're in the Matrix.... but someone forgot to renew the antivirus software...
900648351770619904 2017-08-24 09:17:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller The phrase "easily startled" comes to mind...
900564473638825984 2017-08-23 03:44:36 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum You are literally publishing negativity about the government this second. Are you sure the press isn't still free?
900375334960324608 2017-08-23 15:13:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders @FoxReports Because he was suuuuper subtle about that at the rally............
900369253534126080 2017-08-23 14:48:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum He's done a piss poor job so far. Maybe some advice is in order.
900355248325251072 2017-08-23 13:53:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf @MeghanMcCain If he remains in politics, he accepts the harsh reality of that world.
900353650706403328 2017-08-23 13:46:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNN @ElizLanders I think the point is you only focus on "many sides". Not that you would ever get caught getting the point...
900351920673439744 2017-08-23 13:40:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @WestWingReport This is journalism? Maybe that's why people say nasty things about you. Think on that.
900332093611229184 2017-08-23 12:21:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @ElizLanders I think the title should be changed to "Biased whining and fear-mongering over rally in Phoenix"
900325342274920449 2017-08-23 11:54:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @IngrahamAngle I say give Trump his outlet. Let him relate to people on a human level - we aren't all Obama-Hilary leftist robots.
900323881092653057 2017-08-23 11:48:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RealJamesWoods What is the leftist obsession with inventing words. Geez!
900323626989137920 2017-08-23 11:47:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle It's shocking this guy was once in a position of authority.
900323289649758208 2017-08-23 11:46:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @ElizLanders @realDonaldTrump stared down the sun and won.
900208955808460802 2017-08-22 04:11:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Well, the press is overwhelmingly liberal - and often biased toward that position... that might have something to do with it.
900206345143668736 2017-08-22 04:01:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum You're a joke
900204203213283329 2017-08-22 03:53:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @newtgingrich Don Lemon is CLEARLY the dumbest "news" anchor on television. By far.
900196092939304965 2017-08-22 03:20:48 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum You're blaming Trump because you chose to focus on irrelevant things?
900195731574857729 2017-08-22 03:19:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Belittle and bully. That's your passive-aggressive style!

900033772740935681 2017-08-22 16:35:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf For Clinton, the "military option" was always the tastiest thing on the menu.

899851669046939650 2017-08-21 04:32:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @BCAppelbaum Giving Obama a run for his money, clearly.
899308195658645504 2017-08-20 16:32:36 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @politico @MatthewNussbaum @dsamuelsohn This is just sad. "No pay" is probably the story of their lives.
898936113519222784 2017-08-19 15:54:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @IngrahamAngle The problem with journalists is you can't argue with them if you disagree - that's always an attempt at silencing them.
898935707510517760 2017-08-19 15:52:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @IngrahamAngle Irresponsible journalism is the scourge of our time.

898919999422644225 2017-08-19 14:50:03 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume ... the group had not met or otherwise conducted activities during the first eight months of the Trump administration.

898896561580658688 2017-08-19 13:16:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RealJamesWoods @ananavarro has a lobotomy scheduled for later today. Should be a quick procedure.
898757742797627393 2017-08-18 04:05:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brhodes You're an expert at not having a job.
898602315728396290 2017-08-18 17:47:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum How many of those are you happy to see gone?
898597029223333888 2017-08-18 17:26:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @nickconfessore Javanka are mostly relegated to pie in the sky BS and pure BS. Given too much credit.

898595487669825537 2017-08-18 17:20:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Fake News Acosta pretending to report something. Funny!
898593416371617792 2017-08-18 17:12:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @jdawsey1 I bet a left-wing nut like you is real close with Bannon and his pals.

898587444194365440 2017-08-18 16:48:36 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller @TocRadio With an ego like that, you can bet on it. And win.
898586464530726912 2017-08-18 16:44:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller @TocRadio It's about time.
898585745530560512 2017-08-18 16:41:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller Spanish government was probably busy attending an anti-Trump rally.
898584634123968520 2017-08-18 16:37:26 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum How does the lobotomy work? Do you get it free with your journalism degree or is it a prerequisite?
898583776313331712 2017-08-18 16:34:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf I think Trump was making a valid point which has been grossly misunderstood. Some deliberately, some not so much. Take a second look.
898582921195405312 2017-08-18 16:30:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller Probably true - almost no one takes neo-nazis seriously.
898582589451100166 2017-08-18 16:29:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RealJamesWoods I envy the guy who invents an attack timer for those lights. Gonna make a bundle.

898553366153789440 2017-08-18 14:33:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller They get paid to dunk, not think.

898552291480838144 2017-08-18 14:28:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum It's always nice when failed presidential candidates tell winning ones what they think.
898546426954661888 2017-08-18 14:05:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @GlennThrush The point is that some people were at the PARK for reasons not having to do with white supremacy.
898544242422722560 2017-08-18 13:56:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller Nic Cage has been proof of his depressing downward spiral for some time now...
898542995544211456 2017-08-18 13:51:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNN @ElizLanders I wonder if a "refugee" did it? Can I say that? I know we're all thinking it.

898541145881325568 2017-08-18 13:44:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta So you just do what Robert E. Lee tells you? Interesting!

898535645861355520 2017-08-18 13:22:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta I'm sure @realDonaldTrump is falling all over himself to take the advice of a presidential race LOSER like Romney.
898531969868234752 2017-08-18 13:08:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @DailyCaller I think @potus claimed there were some people at the PARK who wanted to save a statue...
898531756944482305 2017-08-18 13:07:19 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump Why do some people get to play with the lives of all Americans only for political gain? It's not fair.
898531282044436482 2017-08-18 13:05:26 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JulianAssange @MatthewNussbaum @TrumpsAlert Powerful stuff.
898530768971939840 2017-08-18 13:03:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RealJamesWoods Should have stuck with New Amsterdam I guess.
898530638734573568 2017-08-18 13:02:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RealJamesWoods Dems wrong about the facts? Nooooooo........
898530471168024576 2017-08-18 13:02:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller HA! They are against slavery, just not the slaves making iPhones in China.

898218696325316608 2017-08-17 16:23:19 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum The MEDIA want to pin a culture war on Donald Trump. That's the real news here.

892453216968777728 2017-08-01 18:33:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailyCaller Any news about Imran Awan and Debbie Wasserman Schultz? No? Thought so.

892393463550889984 2017-08-01 14:35:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum You're so biased. Every. Single. Tweet. You're Trump in reverse.
892389100396859392 2017-08-01 14:18:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @NolanDMcCaskill None of those are provably false. As a journalist, you should understand what that means. Sadly, you don't.

892385245303001088 2017-08-01 14:03:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Any update on Wasserman Schultz and Pakistan? No, I didn't think so. Focus on tweeting instead. That's the "real" news

892384517545054208 2017-08-01 14:00:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum You're constantly derogatory, always in search of negative stories and casually ignore good news like it's no big deal.. how's that "real"?

891324152807800834 2017-07-29 15:46:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum You don't? So, the point is what? Worsen relations with Russia? ... not get them to reform their behavior?
891323731791855616 2017-07-29 15:45:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Doesn't it get tedious always trying to find fault in everything? Seriously. I'd like to know.

891073880265076736 2017-07-28 23:12:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNN @Acosta @David_Gergen Analysis is correct. Tone is biased.
891073302201999360 2017-07-28 23:10:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kyletblaine The fact that he choose FAKE NEWS @CNN tell you everything you need to know about @Reince45

890998665279545345 2017-07-28 18:13:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @apalmerdc Because women are too weak to stomach colorful language? So much for equality.
890998496416874496 2017-07-28 18:12:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders Of course, @CNN siding with a murderous gang rather than @POTUS... What alternate reality is this?
890535565610713089 2017-07-27 11:33:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta is just no match for @Scaramucci ... don't even bother tweeting about him!
890532403235569664 2017-07-27 11:20:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NewDay @Acosta Are you suggesting that @Scaramucci no longer appear on @CNN ?
890255670573842433 2017-07-26 17:01:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum LGBT rights do not trump every other consideration in every single facet of life, government or military. It's called balance.
890243716216086528 2017-07-26 16:13:36 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Question: In what ways does tolerating trans people in the military make it a more lethal fighting force?
890236750676742144 2017-07-26 15:45:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Are you really a journalist? All you tweet about is negative trivia about @realDonaldTrump. Frankly, it's weird.
890230612644069377 2017-07-26 15:21:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNN @ElizLanders @TheGiantHogweed WRONG. Americans don't care if trans people exist in society, says  nothing about bending over backward to accommodate them in the military.
890226257266331648 2017-07-26 15:04:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf @DadTimpf Has no heard of the recent spate of acid attacks in the UK? This could just as easily have been a horrific incident. Find him NOW.
890205208352923649 2017-07-26 13:40:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNN @ElizLanders @TheGiantHogweed I would say it is simply a reorientation toward sanity and most Americans would agree that sanity is a good thing.
890203469931462660 2017-07-26 13:33:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RealJamesWoods To be fair, he was also a disbarred lawyer. That's gotta count for something.
890203324284256256 2017-07-26 13:33:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders We make military policy based on @CNN polls now?
890202879868289026 2017-07-26 13:31:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RealJamesWoods There is no benefit to the military in adapting to the "needs" of a minuscule minority of the general population. FACT.
890202509544800256 2017-07-26 13:29:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Transgendered people are a distraction in the military. There is no material benefit to the military in adapting to a minuscule minority.
890199622051799040 2017-07-26 13:18:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @SeriesBooks The serious business of warfighting is probably not the right place to conduct a misguided social experiment.
890198482090209282 2017-07-26 13:13:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum I don't see you offering to pay the costs of having transgenders in the military.

889860524543926272 2017-07-25 14:50:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Only @CNN responds "wow" to a statement of fact.

888751669927788544 2017-07-22 13:24:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Maybe you should try getting up earlier?
888366492420460544 2017-07-21 11:54:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jonsarlin @Acosta @TomKludt Explain how seeing someone stand at a podium makes democracy stronger? Isn't it the words that matter?
888274286917459972 2017-07-20 05:47:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RealJamesWoods @DAGYates I think the slow-motion coup d'etat orchestrated by political foes in government trumps whatever you're rattling on about.

887717129809678336 2017-07-19 16:53:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SebGorka @JordanSchachtel @benrhodes don't be a sissy... debate if you truly believe in your position.

887716514291265536 2017-07-19 16:51:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum There is more evidence on voter fraud than Russian collusion...

887011919302844416 2017-07-17 18:11:36 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Try peppering in a few non-Russia questions. Get the most out of your time.

884836550177038341 2017-07-11 18:07:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @politico @MatthewNussbaum BTW If HRC won all the debates, how did we get here?
884829993087389696 2017-07-11 17:41:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum It seems you are trying to make a point, but I don't get it. Please clarify.

884819425907458048 2017-07-11 16:59:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Information from a Russian does not make it illegal. You should engage the issue based on that framework.
884813033083510788 2017-07-11 16:34:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum I guess the answer is that you're indeed not sure what is.
884811591300005888 2017-07-11 16:28:17 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JYSexton Maybe that's a sign you should re-evaluate your journalistic priorities.
884811450878840833 2017-07-11 16:27:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JYSexton Taking dirt on a political opponent is not collusion. Is politics a foreign concept to you?

880457132767707137 2017-06-29 16:05:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume Silvio Berlusconi had a facelift - not sure referencing that qualifies as sexist.
880413043359834112 2017-06-29 13:10:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TimAlberta I love the smell of Trumpbomb in the morning.
880412593248116736 2017-06-29 13:08:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @EamonJavers Isn't it glorious?!
880037760815382529 2017-06-28 12:18:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Kevinliptakcnn Is he handcuffed?
879710110473265153 2017-06-27 14:36:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan Since when did being a women make you impervious to criticism?
879709961806200833 2017-06-27 14:36:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan She is awful.
879695867728412672 2017-06-27 13:40:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @CNN should try supporting American democracy rather than sensationalizing nonsense.
879688574353891330 2017-06-27 13:11:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Try to act like a grownup and use your indoor voice.
879628071506132992 2017-06-27 09:10:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BBCBreakfast OMG @piersmorgan simply tweets too much. I have no choice but to mute you. Sorry.
879607348033052673 2017-06-27 07:48:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JChengWSJ They want to see if SK will persist. That's how you know if the offer is genuine.
879387909626896385 2017-06-26 17:16:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan Yet all of them will be found with an ugly blue sign insisting they always be shut.
879321013883777026 2017-06-26 12:50:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls @MailOnline Clearly fake.
879318356678987776 2017-06-26 12:40:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @Scaramucci @CNN @KellyannePolls Russians must think they won the cold war given the attention they are getting.
879317811377471488 2017-06-26 12:37:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump Correct!
879317737675161602 2017-06-26 12:37:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls One of the reasons I prefer Fox is for the lack of shouting.
879317564328787968 2017-06-26 12:36:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls Why do liberals scream so much? It's weird...
879258271952945154 2017-06-26 08:41:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JChengWSJ The thought of state propaganda being displayed mockingly in a middle-America church basement probably tested poorly w/ North Koreans...
879257472506015745 2017-06-26 08:38:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JChengWSJ @DrKevinGray I think the whole "eerie" narrative is a bit overplayed.
879180205348110337 2017-06-25 03:31:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta You're just sad no one will hear you yelling at government officials.
878978374898638848 2017-06-25 14:09:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ChrisPlanteShow @SebGorka @ccsheriffok The left is America's ultimate privileged class - they invent their own version of reality and aim to impose it on everyone else.
878665995295928322 2017-06-24 17:27:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @annafifield Kentucky for the chicken or the libation?
878661338012073984 2017-06-24 17:09:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @YPioneerTours @GNTours @lrozen @annafifield @kg_se10 @MsTessMcGill It can be done safely, but the YPT corporate ethos was geared toward "fun" tours that make money, not safe tours that are also fun.
878657992064761856 2017-06-24 16:56:04 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @YPioneerTours @GNTours @lrozen @annafifield @kg_se10 @MsTessMcGill Fact is that Otto was not properly prepared to be in NK and it was YPT who were supposed to prepare him.
878652270480506885 2017-06-24 16:33:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @itvracing @CharlotteHawkns @piersmorgan As the UK burns (literately), you prance around in fancy dress. Nice.
878313339822133248 2017-06-23 18:06:33 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Obamacare is on Obamacare... so it's dying. Axiomatic, my friend.
878296253351608321 2017-06-23 16:58:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan Letting Irishmen in now are they?
878282344309956610 2017-06-23 16:03:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> Sucks to be @Acosta
878279767597793280 2017-06-23 15:53:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SangerNYT I have a hard copy of the NK law governing detention of foreigners. DM me if you want it.
878091822232330240 2017-06-22 03:26:19 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> You got burned @Acosta
877905393233477633 2017-06-22 15:05:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @YPioneerTours @GNTours @lrozen @annafifield @kg_se10 Organizing trips to North Korea is not like a day trip to the beach. Everyone's safety rests on the organizer being sober and alert.
877900957257834496 2017-06-22 14:47:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Your definition of "right" must be different than the rest of the world.
877894721393250308 2017-06-22 14:23:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders Three "official statements" before noon! What an animal!
877878635499102208 2017-06-22 13:19:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump is not a Russian spy. There. I said it. What do I win?
877764482923089920 2017-06-21 05:45:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @YPioneerTours @GNTours @lrozen @annafifield Good luck holding onto it - he rarely washes his hair. #greasy
877360956803653633 2017-06-20 03:02:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @greggutfeld Onward to 2018 indeed... where you will keep on losing.
877156335485243392 2017-06-20 13:29:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Be sure to shout loudly and badger him for answers to silly questions. Oh, wait... you know that already.
877145513409224704 2017-06-20 12:46:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @kyledcheney Because they have never been wrong before, right?
877143985793388545 2017-06-20 12:39:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @kaitlancollins Why is being on camera so important? I thought 'words matter'...
877136681740124161 2017-06-20 12:10:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta @CNNnewsroom You'd think his words were more important than having him on video. Maybe you're angry that you have less material to fill airtime?
877033144708243457 2017-06-19 05:19:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta @giacomonyt I think it is biased nonsense like that that has convinced the WH that there is no legitimate purpose to humoring you any longer.
876826018756960256 2017-06-19 15:36:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan Has everyone gone insane?! Seriously. No. I'm really serious.
876804148695490560 2017-06-19 14:09:33 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @KatyTurNBC Maybe because it isn't terrorism?
876778634886881280 2017-06-19 12:28:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum And to think, if not for the Russians, we'd have a woman in the White House
876771577118867456 2017-06-19 12:00:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @jdawsey1 It's a lot of money to learn not all that much...
876128528621645824 2017-06-17 17:24:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @FLOTUS @ElizLanders All those immigrants in one place must make @POTUS uncomfortable... 
876087439479025664 2017-06-17 14:41:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising @WreathsAcross What the hell is this? It's fantastic!
876086963769532416 2017-06-17 14:39:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @vanromo @MatthewNussbaum @mikiebarb See, you can find positive stories if you open your eyes.
876057925382316032 2017-06-17 12:44:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Why are you so obviously biased? I wish you would control yourself better.
876045523949568000 2017-06-17 11:55:03 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan Demanding professionalism from public servants is not a question of emotion but of survival.
875782519647379457 2017-06-16 18:29:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan That's the tone deaf neo-British way!
875768686262353920 2017-06-16 17:35:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta You think a week is a long time? What's the matter with you? It's like reporting from a 6 year old.
875767437999783936 2017-06-16 17:30:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan If this happened in China, everyone would be condemning the travesty of a government that allowed it to happen.
875766767888420866 2017-06-16 17:27:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta I need a Moscow Mule.
875740981290647552 2017-06-16 15:44:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> Yet not a single @Acosta tweet on what @POTUS actually said...
875711310264020992 2017-06-16 13:47:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Could it be there was more than one reason to fire Comey?
875643553929609216 2017-06-16 09:17:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @jdawsey1 Oh, Trump is the one obsessed with the probe. Right...
875341752793681920 2017-06-15 13:18:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Jeff Sessions being a Russian spy is par for the course for you, but this is what puts it over the top for you?
875262197697400832 2017-06-15 08:02:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan @mrjammyjamjar3 Why is there a need to pick-out "Muslims" as heroes?
875174878101372929 2017-06-14 02:15:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta I saw @POTUS tweet already... slow
875025534157111296 2017-06-14 16:21:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Railing up a mob of disgruntled leftists with your irresponsible reporting has led to this. Are you proud of yourself? ANSWER
875017170966552576 2017-06-14 15:48:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @anyaparampil No law can prevent someone from pointing and pulling the trigger.
875006921174007808 2017-06-14 15:08:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta It is irresponsible reporters like you that caused this tragedy.
874662555758739456 2017-06-13 16:19:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Maybe US journalism has a more rosy view of its output that, perhaps, it objectively deserves. Food for thought.
874661668252405760 2017-06-13 16:16:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Just because something happened doesn't mean it can't be changed. Those buildings don't exist simply to serve the media.
874661319043039232 2017-06-13 16:14:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SenateSAA @MatthewNussbaum @mkraju So just ask permission. What's the big deal?
874661055208620032 2017-06-13 16:13:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum The press don't run DC. That's just something you need to accept.
874634323780960256 2017-06-13 14:27:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNN @ElizLanders @willripleyCNN Sadly, the truth is that Otto is mentally ill. Hopefully he will get appropriate treatment, not just pity.
874628838126370819 2017-06-13 14:05:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks Shame on anyone who "funds" this loser who so richly deserves prison.
874595253377941506 2017-06-13 11:52:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @ElizLanders Trump runs the executive branch - he can do a lot of things. I'm not sure why this comes as a surprise to anyone.
874334725665570816 2017-06-12 18:36:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Gee, I just thought he was talking about jobs for Americans. Thanks for clarifying.
874334450179481600 2017-06-12 18:35:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Pro tip: Ask better questions while you have the chance.
874333349854068736 2017-06-12 18:31:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @PressSec @Acosta The universe owes you a question, doesn't it?
874333156341538816 2017-06-12 18:30:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Another day, another Acosta complaint.
873911072046014464 2017-06-11 14:33:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @ddiamond What is the reason those people will be uninsured?
873898940973719553 2017-06-11 13:45:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum So why didn't the markets react this way during the 8 years Obama was actually at the helm? Doesn't make sense to discount Trump's role.
873897965244489728 2017-06-11 13:41:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan I think you should be more principled on this topic. Were those 3200 deaths due to legal gun owners or criminals doing crime with a gun?
873596844542107648 2017-06-10 17:44:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @anyaparampil @GarethPorter No one likes being told they are easily manipulated idiots.
873596665256529920 2017-06-10 17:44:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ShawnBoburg @MatthewNussbaum @peterbakernyt Clearly he's part of the collusion. Let's form a commission to ask him if he's a Russian spy.
873596461866377216 2017-06-10 17:43:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @PressSec @SecretaryZinke I guess real men still do exist.
873593326389178368 2017-06-10 17:30:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @BraddJaffy Why will they not have insurance?
873538216057421825 2017-06-10 13:51:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Bossing @POTUS around. Good luck with that.
873479285234782208 2017-06-10 09:57:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan I hear the soylent green is nice.
873476360022315008 2017-06-10 09:46:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan Shes a weak and uninspiring leader. That's a problem.
873380038447517696 2017-06-09 03:23:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta HA!!!!!!
873193435724824576 2017-06-09 15:01:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @newtgingrich I'm not going to get a FB account to watch. Sorry.
873181501688496132 2017-06-09 14:14:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan The era of weak leaders is upon us
873180870672228352 2017-06-09 14:11:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan The UK is rapidly joining Greece in the club of "formerly great nations"
873180645995888640 2017-06-09 14:11:03 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders I see empty calories
873124986029957122 2017-06-09 10:29:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @IngrahamAngle The UK is rapidly joining Greece in the club of "formerly great nations"...
872862862099619841 2017-06-08 17:08:17 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @jdawsey1 Former AG had it way worse than he did to be frank. He should be happy it went so well.
872862642523615232 2017-06-08 17:07:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan Former AG had it way worse IMO
872859850736189442 2017-06-08 16:56:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @politico What about the memos his friend has?
872856513345331200 2017-06-08 16:43:04 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @greggutfeld Might have been better if he said that then.
872856350543327232 2017-06-08 16:42:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum He's obviously not well. Someone should talk to him.
872856220922658816 2017-06-08 16:41:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @IngrahamAngle Sorry, but that was just a weird line of inquiry, if you can call it that.
872832114869149696 2017-06-08 15:06:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum "Hope" isn't an order. That's just English dude...
872739182002577409 2017-06-08 08:56:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @CNNPolitics @IngrahamAngle Why are you up so early?
872634718776315904 2017-06-07 02:01:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders Must See TV...duh
872634352496033792 2017-06-07 02:00:17 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum I think humans ought to recognize that we all make mistakes when under stress.
872493143450505216 2017-06-07 16:39:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Because leaks will destroy a country, while "Russian interference" had no effect on the election. Simple, right?
872473482130448386 2017-06-07 15:21:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @HackneyAbbott @piersmorgan With British weather she might fly higher than you'd expect... just saying...
872473239137669121 2017-06-07 15:20:04 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ericgeller @MatthewNussbaum @laurenduca blocked me.. am I missing anything good?
872465986816925696 2017-06-07 14:51:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan HA! Hopefully better than one of your interviews @HackneyAbbott
872465577045925888 2017-06-07 14:49:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DanaPerino @kimguilfoyle My dream is to marry you.
872447927892836352 2017-06-07 13:39:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan If politicians don't want to look like fools on @GMB they should work harder to be competent, not ditch the show.
872439151441747968 2017-06-07 13:04:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan Does it really take a whole newspaper article to show that PM of a country under siege by murderous terrorists is doing a bad job?
872437091283619840 2017-06-07 12:56:26 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan You can see everything under the black marker.
872436069467209729 2017-06-07 12:52:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Is that literally all you have to say about the man?
872435684631379968 2017-06-07 12:50:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan @TomBevanRCP He looks so weak...
872393245078167552 2017-06-07 10:02:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks She's right. So what's the problem?
872382687918653440 2017-06-07 09:20:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan @Daily_Express Question: If being tolerant and accommodating is so important to terrorists, why do they keep killing Londoners?
872381135959076864 2017-06-07 09:14:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan I thought it was "discrimination!"
872377752313368576 2017-06-07 09:00:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan If the woman is dumb enough to answer trick emails, she deserves whatever comes her way.
872375381516582912 2017-06-07 08:51:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan Politicians have an absolute duty to be competent. There is nothing disgusting about demanding as much.
872367966440108033 2017-06-07 08:21:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan If only there were a vaccine...
872364577534640128 2017-06-07 08:08:17 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan Ya, but really, what was your naughtiest moment?!
872357858171654151 2017-06-07 07:41:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta @POTUS nominated him to the position. It is a safe assumption that he has confidence in him until and unless he is fired.
872348626806288384 2017-06-07 07:04:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @susannareid100 @piersmorgan @GMB What is the current British obsession with recalling a "naughty moment"... I think now is the time to limit mindless distractions.
872266073759809536 2017-06-06 01:36:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @GlennThrush If you hate your life so much, quit.
872117477840441344 2017-06-06 15:46:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @newtgingrich For some liberals, living tolerantly on our knees is better than dying free on our feet.
872116991628324864 2017-06-06 15:44:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @newtgingrich I truly believe liberals are comforted by the well practiced rituals done after each fresh attack, yet terrified "Muslims" will be vilified
872109875974852611 2017-06-06 15:16:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @IngrahamAngle Seemingly little distinction between "person of interest" and "person"...
872105893109870592 2017-06-06 15:00:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @AFP @CNN @ElizLanders When do we need to start hashtagging PrayforParis? No one died, is that still hashtagworthy? What's the etiquette?
872099880298262529 2017-06-06 14:36:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SopanDeb Unlikely.
872085731845562369 2017-06-06 13:40:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @BraddJaffy How about throwing in a positive retweet about @realDonaldTrump ... just for variety sake.
872079943089389568 2017-06-06 13:17:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan Certain political factions need kick in the rear to knock them out of their suicidal sleepwalking. @realDonaldTrump is that kick.
872063234081259520 2017-06-06 12:10:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @nikkihaley @HillelNeuer Your derogatory view of China is unfortunate and ill-informed.
872062335019601921 2017-06-06 12:07:17 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump Tough love works!
872060648968073218 2017-06-06 12:00:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump Tweet responsibly.
872060565744648192 2017-06-06 12:00:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan Some people will probably get more upset at you telling a woman to "pipe down" than they are about the attack.
872060314782748672 2017-06-06 11:59:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @piersmorgan Blame the victim approach to fighting terrorism...

871997302726176769 2017-06-06 07:48:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SebGorka @FreeBeacon @ChrisCuomo is mentally unwell.
871935899793227777 2017-06-05 03:44:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks Finally, a patriot in the media.
871752099691999233 2017-06-05 15:34:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum The tweets are testing the professionalism of journalists to focus on the proper topics despite the bait.
871751711702093824 2017-06-05 15:32:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @danmericaCNN The reluctance to call it a "travel ban" is because certain factions have co-opted the term "ban" to be synonymous with "Muslim ban".
871751345220530178 2017-06-05 15:31:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @danmericaCNN It is a travel ban. It is not a Muslim ban. A "ban" can be permanent, or, as in this case, it can be temporary.
871747224686006272 2017-06-05 15:15:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ChrisCuomo Is that counting CNN playing in every airport?
871747066128723969 2017-06-05 15:14:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ChrisCuomo @POTUS is happy to call it a ban - it just isn't a "Muslim ban". The difference is clear and supported on the basic facts.
871746694815285249 2017-06-05 15:13:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ChrisCuomo I think the answer to the question was "it's a ban, just not a Muslim ban". He answered; you have another view.
871745963987226625 2017-06-05 15:10:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ChrisCuomo Chris, I think you are not as well as you could be. I hope someone who cares for you will guide you to the appropriate care.
871745138489516032 2017-06-05 15:06:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SebGorka @Ginacasagrande @ChrisCuomo I truly think you are perhaps not as well as you could be. Please ask someone who loves you to get you the help you need.
871744525806514177 2017-06-05 15:04:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SebGorka @Ginacasagrande @ChrisCuomo may actually be suffering from a mental disorder. I'm serious. Someone who cares about him should encourage him to look into it.
871722765128257536 2017-06-05 13:37:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SebGorka @NewDay @ChrisCuomo really is a chained lunatic. I never watched him before, but wow....
871574404118978560 2017-06-04 03:48:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @kyledcheney So a tweet is a tweet for everyone except @POTUS where a tweet is always a statement. Interesting.
871419970697052160 2017-06-04 17:34:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @NatashaBertrand This Ramadan: Terror in the name of Islam: 510 dead. Killings by Islamophobia: 0

871412197506768896 2017-06-04 17:03:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @PressSec Did really really have to ruin a wonder letter with "humankind"?
871411702847361024 2017-06-04 17:01:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews I wonder if his mansion will be underwater or if he believes in air conditioning. Shut off the AC and light the studio with candles for him!
871405984027090945 2017-06-04 16:39:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MarkSteynOnline @PeteHegseth London was so "progressive" as to elect a Muslim mayor - yet terrorists seem not to have noticed. ISIS, have some class!
871403609199595520 2017-06-04 16:29:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising @Uncle_Jimbo London was so "progressive" as to elect a Muslim mayor - yet terrorists seem not to have noticed. ISIS, have some class!
871402800432824321 2017-06-04 16:26:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @poppyme4 @derekahunter Good lord...
871391428345081856 2017-06-04 15:41:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brithume Anyone who says "humankind" is a bad apple in my book.
871348889181274112 2017-06-04 12:52:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls Words without meaning. She is incapable of making the hard decisions that need to be made.
871348327966580736 2017-06-04 12:50:04 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DougHeye Well, the reason is because the mayor of London doesn't take security seriously. Not a bad reason really...
871347985392713729 2017-06-04 12:48:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta What a clown...
871204504867184646 2017-06-03 03:18:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @anyaparampil I think you should find a new boyfriend.
870685594992623616 2017-06-02 16:56:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum @kyledcheney Are you referring to the hat or the bit about remaining peaceful?
870663873719697408 2017-06-02 15:30:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum Certainly a positive development.
870663535755313156 2017-06-02 15:28:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MatthewNussbaum I don't think @realDonaldTrump ever told cities and states not to be environmentally friendly where practical...
870330290601771011 2017-06-01 17:24:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Oh no! The end is near! Someone gather a tuxedoed quartet to play us down.
870324974627676160 2017-06-01 17:03:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MarkSteynOnline So throw in Macedonia... hit the Albanians while you're at it. Top Gear did an instructive show on them (Hint: they get things done)
870319340335226880 2017-06-01 16:41:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @PressSec The left asks: Are they in Moscow?
870106208954236929 2017-05-31 02:34:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf Question: When does freedom crossover into insanity?
870105630555623424 2017-05-31 02:32:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf What's wrong with your body? Because you're small?
870081590524653568 2017-05-31 00:56:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta It's not "bolted" - they do not exist to serve you. He left.
869950784690978816 2017-05-31 16:16:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JasonMillerinDC @PeterAlexander Shame on libs for "normalizing" beheading the @POTUS
869950571918307328 2017-05-31 16:15:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JasonMillerinDC @PeterAlexander The mental health of many people - including certain journalists - deserves great and serious attention.
869949756390293504 2017-05-31 16:12:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> #PrayForKaboul anyone? anyone? hmm... @realDonaldTrump is trying to STOP terrorists from attacking anyone, including Muslims.
869948242720473089 2017-05-31 16:06:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DanScavino I sincerely hope Secret Service is visiting @kathygriffin today!
869905117931216897 2017-05-31 13:15:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders Old news... I saw that on Fox ages ago now!

869903665670139905 2017-05-31 13:09:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @Kevinliptakcnn @ElizLanders The climate is always changing.... If Man went extinct tomorrow, it would still change. That's just a fact.
869902990374612992 2017-05-31 13:06:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta It is a scientific impossibility to make that statement. NASA admits as much in their caveats.
869881505820024833 2017-05-31 11:41:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DonaldJTrumpJr The left doesn't even think killing actual terrorist's is such a great idea...
869877992662507520 2017-05-31 11:27:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump The Secret Service NEEDS to visit Kathy Griffin!
869759089575735297 2017-05-30 03:35:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @greggutfeld Dems 2017: As progressive as ISIS
869599926224789505 2017-05-30 17:02:33 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Smart.
869599242347659264 2017-05-30 16:59:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta "Cooperate"... sounds sinister.
869597785993035776 2017-05-30 16:54:03 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @keithellison I thought they wanted him to win?
869596927364444160 2017-05-30 16:50:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @nytimes @anyaparampil @MikePrysner As if the USSR wasn't evidence enough, Venezuela shows that radical socialism reliably leads to disaster.
869542363722424321 2017-05-30 13:13:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders Seems that hiring and firing is purely an internal matter. Maybe leaks are not as insightful as commonly thought.
868780280953188353 2017-05-28 10:45:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ElizLanders In the back of the bus I see...
868473577590243334 2017-05-27 14:26:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta How so? I thought words matter.
868426420422230017 2017-05-27 11:19:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks Bless his heart, Tubin has truly given up on the law.

868049432884817921 2017-05-26 10:21:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump Everyone needs to do their part. If really security matters to you, pay your fair share.
867803598905778176 2017-05-25 18:04:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Ah, finally we agree. Belgium: A country with no reason to exist.
867755612595142656 2017-05-25 14:53:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Why are you obsessed with constant access? POTUS does not exist to serve you. Do you not know that?
866890291961241600 2017-05-22 05:35:26 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @anyaparampil @MikePrysner Ah, a vibrant democracy without toilet paper or food. They definitely struck the right balance...

864890943308091392 2017-05-17 17:10:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta @scottwongDC That's the kiss of death in this White House.

864889865392934912 2017-05-17 17:06:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta That's all true.
864889782928670720 2017-05-17 17:06:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta That's sound advice.

861062922675433473 2017-05-06 03:39:33 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf Are you and @andrewschulz an item now?

848934080003457025 2017-04-03 16:23:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @IngrahamAngle So, are we all St. Petersburg? What's the etiquette here?

844675737072234496 2017-03-22 22:22:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta You forgot the part where they reported on Trump with that information.
844043619124232192 2017-03-20 04:30:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf Razor sharp reasoning applied to a prickly problem.

834809197011230720 2017-02-23 16:56:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising Sad thing is if these were CNN people, MSM would be saying Trump and Putin poisoned them.

832404437381500929 2017-02-16 01:40:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf @barstoolsports Looks like shes warped in a carpet.
831468866370875393 2017-02-14 11:43:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SebGorka @GrayConnolly What an odd interview. Is it too much to ask to simply have a calm, rational discussion w/o playing to extremes?
831365238834368512 2017-02-13 04:51:33 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper You're really a jerk.

830625182200893440 2017-02-11 03:50:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @seanspicer No Press Secretary should be treated as badly as Sean has by the MSM. And rational, thinking person can see that.

829310429868482566 2017-02-08 12:46:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SebGorka @WashTimes At some point you have to wonder who, exactly, these people are fighting for?
829305340273520641 2017-02-08 12:26:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf I'm food. We're a match.
829277599658569730 2017-02-08 10:36:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MorningsMaria @KatTimpf That's my type of early-bird special

828964613764964352 2017-02-07 13:52:19 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper I'm sure if one of your kids was beheaded by a terrorist, you'd sing a different tune. Try honest introspection and report back.

828887940730277888 2017-02-07 08:47:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks That is an opinion, not a ruling. And it is clearly not a well-reasoned one at that.
828799387371384833 2017-02-06 02:55:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Does that make liberals like him more? It should.

828615791830372352 2017-02-06 14:46:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SebGorka @NewDay Viewing every policy/security decision through the blurry lens of race does nothing to help us understand our reality.
828613989345005568 2017-02-06 14:39:04 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising Bill occasionally comes down enough to say some sensible things.
828613256633737220 2017-02-06 14:36:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SebGorka @NewDay Media need to put on their bigboy pants and grow up.

828611308832514050 2017-02-06 14:28:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @SebGorka Fact that today's failed states and state sponsors of terror happen to be predominantly Muslim is sad coincidence
828610945463103488 2017-02-06 14:26:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @SebGorka Injecting religion into this matter is a completely fabricated narrative shamelessly pushed by some in the press

828594643310743552 2017-02-06 13:22:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CBSThisMorning @jaketapper @NorahODonnell It's called common sense. And yes, you do not fully understand it.
828594233195966464 2017-02-06 13:20:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNN @ChrisCuomo @SebGorka Regrettably, my TV is allergic to CNN.
828594110046941184 2017-02-06 13:20:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNN @ChrisCuomo @SebGorka You can tweet and be interviewed at the same time? Amazing!
828593974591893504 2017-02-06 13:19:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks It is very disingenuous, and frankly detrimental to your cause, to persistently claim he is held. He is not being held by anyone
828588079753474048 2017-02-06 12:56:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper He must be sore, if the movies tell us anything.
828584006522335232 2017-02-06 12:39:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump Funny how the losers now have all the answers!
828583377221464064 2017-02-06 12:37:26 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @jaketapper @potus WRONG. Popular vote was portrayed by the media as the prime indicator of electoral victory.
828580593117982721 2017-02-06 12:26:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @mod_russia @RussianEmbassy American society cares only about cheap, lazy emotion - wouldn't lift a finger to offer any real help.

828253555135959040 2017-02-05 14:46:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SebGorka His secret is that he's taken the intellectual energy to try an deeply understand the world and events about which he speaks to.

828252107912290305 2017-02-05 14:41:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JudgeJeanine @SebGorka It should be humanized - meaning use psychology more robustly. For one, world leaders need time to readjust.

828234106571853825 2017-02-05 13:29:33 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @FinzUpMiami Don't be obtuse. Both countries have done things that could be construed as war crimes. He's being honest.
828232996280950785 2017-02-05 13:25:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper What's wrong with being honest about our country?

827892723713667075 2017-02-04 14:53:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Like I said in reply to another Tweet, Jake is way of his game recently. This is just the biggest proof of it to come yet.
827892352840667136 2017-02-04 14:51:33 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @fdwilliams811 The age of access as currency in the media game is over. We trade in facts and objectivity now. Study up!
827890539966001152 2017-02-04 14:44:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Loss of credibility has consequences for journalists.
827886008716840961 2017-02-04 14:26:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SebGorka The type of reaction we see from the left is symptomatic of breakdown of the state as primary international actor.
827885611704999936 2017-02-04 14:24:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @nypost @KellyannePolls Made it by being smart and hard working. Like any normal human.
827885490548273152 2017-02-04 14:24:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SebGorka Globalization - contraction of reality - has caused some to view themselves as non-state actors unbound by the laws of our country
827884152397574145 2017-02-04 14:18:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SebGorka Radical leftists suffer from a collective psychosis: an illusory belief of selfinterest in facts & ideas when they objectively not
827883584895586304 2017-02-04 14:16:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SebGorka The question moving forward is will the radical left ever calm down enough to let logic and rationality wash over them.
827882729287004160 2017-02-04 14:13:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Obama is a curious case - he truly believes the world can be viewed through politics & ideology w/ good outcome
827882243158781954 2017-02-04 14:11:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper The Russians are decades ahead of us in terms of being intellectually equipped to play the mind of an adversary
827881902015025153 2017-02-04 14:10:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper More than knowing facts about the enemy, we need to deeply understand them in order to predict w/ better acuracy
827881504885796865 2017-02-04 14:08:26 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Know more about our enemies and friends is always in our interest. Do we have the ppl who are able to do it? ..?
827871932422852608 2017-02-04 13:30:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kikuandjuju Both sides have a right to express their opinion. You can't champion freedom of the press and strangle that of the government.
827871635420041217 2017-02-04 13:29:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Agreed. My larger point was we just aren't smart enough to understand all outcomes, so recognize our limitations
827870906290577408 2017-02-04 13:26:19 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Hill4America @flanagan_aj @kikuandjuju I didn't say anything about crime and NBC. Must be some misunderstanding.
827870738963013633 2017-02-04 13:25:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Better yet, recognize that no group of humans is smart enough to predict every outcome, so stay home more.
827870221637521408 2017-02-04 13:23:36 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kikuandjuju In places w/o free press, government closes down media they don't like. When did that happen in the US? Your claim, not mine...
827869931039399936 2017-02-04 13:22:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Stop presenting individuals as if it clarifies the whole issue. Some immigrants are nice ppl but we learn nothing from that fact
827869383682715648 2017-02-04 13:20:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @kikuandjuju @Hill4America @flanagan_aj Oh, the No Brain Channel (@nbc)....
827868831032807424 2017-02-04 13:18:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kikuandjuju I have no idea what crime you are talking about? Crime by who?
827868634814898177 2017-02-04 13:17:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @Brocktooon Feelings are not facts. Something sadly lost on a shocking number of Americas.
827868189115584513 2017-02-04 13:15:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @Allentownmike I do. That doesn't mean we need to import them to America.
827867625552179202 2017-02-04 13:13:17 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump It won't stand on appeal! Impossible!
827866618331926528 2017-02-04 13:09:17 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kikuandjuju When we squeeze ISIS-harboring countries, they will try to make it to America. Need to cut off the escape route now.

827865861306281986 2017-02-04 13:06:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Brocktooon Importing people to America is not a long-term solution to anyone's problems. The answer cannot just be "hey, let's emigrate!"
827864412786561024 2017-02-04 13:00:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @kikuandjuju When was the last police raid on a US news outfit?

827863333306916864 2017-02-04 12:56:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @kikuandjuju The press in America is most certainly free - think of all the crap they publish on a daily basis.
827863068642201600 2017-02-04 12:55:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper The solution to every foreign problem is not "immigrate to America".

827514751534051329 2017-02-03 13:51:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls We used to call that just being an adult human. But that was a long time ago..
827513606480617475 2017-02-03 13:46:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TODAYshow @hardball @KellyannePolls Where did the concept of shame go? Why are journalists now devoid of it?
827511465657536512 2017-02-03 13:38:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ABC @KellyannePolls We should also consider that children of refugees may be exposed to harmful influences, particularly as teens.

827503620841054208 2017-02-03 13:06:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper WRONG. People tune-in for a good laugh.
827500168295522306 2017-02-03 12:53:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump Lead us!
827500013043355648 2017-02-03 12:52:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @GovHerbert Ya, they'll fit in just great...
827482810965299200 2017-02-03 11:44:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump You work too hard. Golf more!
827444111951097857 2017-02-03 09:10:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @greggutfeld Have to clear the cockroaches out of the x-ray machines. Takes time, bro.

827355146162167808 2017-02-02 03:16:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Hey! Now you can buy a gun. Congrats, Jake!

827352080830455808 2017-02-02 03:04:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NPR @SebGorka The era of illiberal democracies and democratic fascists is upon us.
827351149988622337 2017-02-02 03:01:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NPR @SebGorka Should read: Trump advisor defends common sense and sound judgement.
827350182303985664 2017-02-02 02:57:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SebGorka You can call it the Hour of Truth.
827145914716286976 2017-02-02 13:25:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @mgyllenhaal @jaketapper @amnesty Individual, sad stories don't really matter. It's just a distraction from broader truths.

826811046144860160 2017-02-01 15:14:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MetroUK @KellyannePolls When did it become cool to kill babies anyway? I found that a bit weird.
826791267229003777 2017-02-01 13:56:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Why have you become such a hack? It's weird.
826788390041378817 2017-02-01 13:44:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @FoxNewsInsider @RedNationRising OMG... this woman... move to Mexico already.

826411867270582272 2017-01-31 12:48:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RussianEmbassy @VisitPetersburg Why haven't I visited Russia yet?

826406313861148672 2017-01-31 12:26:33 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @washingtonpost @jaketapper @GlennKesslerWP There is another number you forgot to cite: 324 million Americans who are now safer.
826308693993984001 2017-01-30 05:58:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Rosie @RNRNCarolina @RNRMaryland Funny how none of these idiots move to Mexico. Racist?
826267440514371584 2017-01-30 03:14:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @brhodes Maybe you should have won the election, then your opinion would matter. Thankfully, you didn't & it doesn't.
826266878305718272 2017-01-30 03:12:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf @EastTNVol Finally a good screenshot.
826059544249839616 2017-01-30 13:28:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @DavidWright_CNN I think the threat is that that terrorists are known to emanate from these places. We all know that.
826056283727884293 2017-01-30 13:15:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Wasting money, risking our security and culture, all when these "refugees" can go to their own neighbors vs. an ocean away 2 us.
826054673924632577 2017-01-30 13:09:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Stop worrying about foreigners. There are millions of actual Americans to think about. Just saying.
826022494758858752 2017-01-30 11:01:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @greggutfeld Nothing like some light humor for a long trip
826022380640227328 2017-01-30 11:00:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @greggutfeld Comedy?
825884517822976000 2017-01-29 01:53:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta America First... I think that came up in the campaign
825879860186927105 2017-01-29 01:34:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ProPublica @jaketapper So, an American can get a good job instead? Sound good - hit two birds with one stone. So efficient!
825692903133507585 2017-01-29 13:11:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper How many refugees have you taken into your home?
825688258235363332 2017-01-29 12:53:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf Just feel lucky you get food for breakfast, unlike many people in this world. (Wow.. this moralizing is really fun! D's right...)
825687613696733184 2017-01-29 12:50:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Jake is a bit of loose cannon recently. I think @realDonaldTrump winning has really thrown him for a loop.
825533289238650880 2017-01-28 02:37:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf Mmmmm.... donner.... delicious
825532879534911488 2017-01-28 02:35:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf Fun and exciting, obviously.
825532696214384641 2017-01-28 02:35:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf I believe you are indeed a person.

825158984680103936 2017-01-27 01:50:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Thanks, but keep your Muslims!
825156696301461505 2017-01-27 01:41:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Finally someone with the balls to do what we all know in our hearts is right.

825018853050552320 2017-01-27 16:33:17 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Hope you got your question ready... oh, wait... no.
825014117241020417 2017-01-27 16:14:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @anyaparampil @jaketapper should put on a pair of boots and do the regime change himself.

825013548183007232 2017-01-27 16:12:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Long week not being called upon?
825008296977313793 2017-01-27 15:51:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNNMoney @jaketapper Who cares?
825007531416170496 2017-01-27 15:48:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Good work Obama!
824965668470616065 2017-01-27 13:01:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper POTUS is not a popularity contest.
824965507434504192 2017-01-27 13:01:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @markknoller So, you're saying he did a lot. Right?
824098948768006145 2017-01-24 03:37:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf what's going on
823781940390141952 2017-01-23 06:38:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina @RNRMississippi These idiots can't even fix a light bulb but we can't defeat them?!
823708513646116865 2017-01-23 01:46:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising LOCK HER UP!
823686112598179842 2017-01-23 00:17:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf @JKollege I'm ashamed to have watched all of that video.
823685846675128321 2017-01-23 00:16:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf @JKollege I like the boots. Was that some sort of standing sit up?
823685041435930624 2017-01-23 00:13:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @PressSec @exjon @jaketapper Hey @CNN get used to being last.
823664716258181121 2017-01-23 22:52:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf As @greggutfeld would say (and did just say) a Donor Boner
823649984780390400 2017-01-23 21:53:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @anyaparampil @BenjaminNorton Clearly they should have hired some black woman actors to make a better picture.
823647432445751298 2017-01-23 21:43:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf @chemicalchica Why so disparaging to crack? I hear good things.

823645985666715648 2017-01-23 21:38:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf I have some health advice for some progressives: take a shower and comb your hair.
823645263919194114 2017-01-23 21:35:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf Because they are idiots?
823615566728589313 2017-01-23 19:37:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JasonMillerinDC @marthamaccallum That was one of the best answers ever to come out of a WH spox.
823615078457024512 2017-01-23 19:35:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @seanspicer @JasonMillerinDC @DavidMDrucker He's extremely impressive.
823612991610486784 2017-01-23 19:26:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @seanspicer @PressSec @DanScavino "It's about what face are we looking at." What a line! This guy is an artist.
823609729234636800 2017-01-23 19:13:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @seanspicer @PressSec @DanScavino Sean is on fire! He can really punch back about integrity.
823605186123988994 2017-01-23 18:55:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Yell your question, Acosta. Yell! C'mon! Shout like a lunatic again. That was fun.
823604770183217157 2017-01-23 18:54:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kimguilfoyle Oh, my. So shinny.
823604620996055041 2017-01-23 18:53:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta HAHA more journalists means less questions for you, CNN
823603560743051267 2017-01-23 18:49:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @seanspicer @PressSec @DanScavino Doing great, Sean!
823603477192601602 2017-01-23 18:49:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta I hope you will be respectful today, Mr. Acosta.
823597379114901504 2017-01-23 18:24:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Obviously no reason to move to a bigger room.
823423439780409344 2017-01-22 06:53:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BenSpielberg Clearly, if Trump's tax docs showed him to be a Russian puppet or criminal some IRS functionary would have leaked 2/2
823423079909064704 2017-01-22 06:52:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BenSpielberg It isn't reasonable to believe no one in the Obama IRS would leak if it was really tarnishing material. 1/2
823399537633087488 2017-01-22 05:18:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BenSpielberg From the nature of tax documents one can safely conclude that all political stripes are represented in their handling.
823396436326907905 2017-01-22 05:06:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BenSpielberg The reality of whistleblowing allows us to infer releasing his tax returns is high risk - low reward or we'd be reading now
823392096451072006 2017-01-22 04:49:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BenSpielberg Actually, it is. Nothing in it is worth taking the risks inherent in releasing it.
823387477830434816 2017-01-22 04:30:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BenSpielberg Clearly people in the world have access to Trump's tax info - if they were so scandalous, they would most certainly be out
823371523893460992 2017-01-22 03:27:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kylegriffin1 @wikileaks @BenSpielberg If there was anything interesting in the tax returns, they would have been leaked long ago.
823371403592351745 2017-01-22 03:26:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kylegriffin1 @wikileaks @BenSpielberg I don't think you should "encourage" illegality over something so trivial.
823352144485093376 2017-01-22 02:10:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf Perhaps both?
823351656943415296 2017-01-22 02:08:26 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf A little blonde bunny hopping around. In search of food or a mate?
823351494498013185 2017-01-22 02:07:48 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf AHAHAHA
823339289299865600 2017-01-22 01:19:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @barstoolsports @KatTimpf Save the makeup for Fox
823338464313769986 2017-01-22 01:16:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf I would never objectify you with my male gaze.
823333440531681280 2017-01-22 00:56:03 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf I'm not an Uber driver, unlike - seemingly - most of your followers, but I'd be happy to carry you around on my back.
823299336176095237 2017-01-22 22:40:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @BarakRavid http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2017/01/politics/trump-inauguration-gigapixel/
823295194829324288 2017-01-22 22:24:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @RedNationRising @bocavista2016 Holy shit... you're right. CNN's own photo disproves their reports. That's just sad.
823275442115399682 2017-01-22 21:05:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta @danmericaCNN And this is news why?
823270326452834305 2017-01-22 20:45:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @JasonMillerinDC @VP I like how they actually show the beautiful rooms rather than a horrible stage backdrop.
823269954254409734 2017-01-22 20:43:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SenJohnMcCain @jaketapper @Shteyngart Awwwww... so sad.
823269304527417344 2017-01-22 20:41:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf Why does everyone need to get so creepy so quickly?
823268090125418496 2017-01-22 20:36:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf I once had a driver who didn't know how to get to the airport... so... it could be worse
823267723660627968 2017-01-22 20:34:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Uber @KatTimpf Hopefully @realDonaldTrump will make urban transport great again.
823267175108636672 2017-01-22 20:32:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Uber @KatTimpf Walk to the corner.
823263999911301120 2017-01-22 20:20:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @anyaparampil @MaxBlumenthal American media do themselves no service by being fools.
823263180667363329 2017-01-22 20:16:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @anyaparampil @Nour_Samaha So it is the US media's fault for not having the ability to understand reality enough to operate sanely.
823262866937671681 2017-01-22 20:15:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @anyaparampil @Nour_Samaha Trump discovered he can create, usually trivial, news and the US media will blindly focus on it for days...
823262428167335937 2017-01-22 20:13:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @anyaparampil @Nour_Samaha The problem is most US media ppl are not well educated. They don't understand they are being played...
823221035881394177 2017-01-22 17:29:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @seanspicer @jaketapper All reporters should release their tax returns so we know who you are connected to.
823219349460779009 2017-01-22 17:22:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @sharethefact PRAVDA has a better record of unbiased reporting than WaPo. Sad.
823217653510733824 2017-01-22 17:15:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @markberman Here's an idea: Protest the horrible treatment of women in Islamic countries.
823217360840622080 2017-01-22 17:14:48 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @sharethefact Do you numbers include mobile streaming etc.?
823214333161304065 2017-01-22 17:02:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @greggutfeld @JustinTrudeau is a clown who has literally no idea what he is doing. I hear Islamic countries treat women wonderfully, right?
823072292221648898 2017-01-21 07:38:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf @Necrovarium I also, rather meekly, wish to note that I am available to hold your uvula open -or closed - as needed.
823071828130365441 2017-01-21 07:36:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf @Necrovarium Dear lady, I bid you adieu, as well as a pleasant, snore-free rest.
823071158543257600 2017-01-21 07:33:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf @Necrovarium I took an Ambien... I might be thinking a little clearer than usual at the moment.

823067667129106432 2017-01-21 07:19:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf @Necrovarium Love is a vision I see on tele-e-vision... ohhh my aching heart
823067172075433984 2017-01-21 07:18:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf @Necrovarium Well, some time in the late 1980's two ppl in Detroit who love each made a baby named Kat aaanndd... here
823066732592041984 2017-01-21 07:16:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina @AaronVulrik Whoever thought of this is a fucking genius. Seriously. A real hard civics lesson.
823065947061755904 2017-01-21 07:13:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf @Necrovarium Easy big boy... those glasses throw off her center of gravity... it's all fun until someone loses an eye

823063118314176512 2017-01-21 07:01:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf I think this photo was taken in Vladimir Putin's Siberian cabin.
823062552678699008 2017-01-21 06:59:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf I'm thinking those sandwiches might come with a little drinkypoo judging by the bottles.
823062358532771840 2017-01-21 06:58:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KatTimpf What's a bae?

822926876775682050 2017-01-21 22:00:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Acosta Thank you for that stupid and useless news.

822887194054578176 2017-01-21 19:22:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @DanScavino I suggest you get a Huawei P9 with dual Lecia cameras since you post so much important stuff
822873777428168706 2017-01-21 18:29:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BarackObama @krauthammer @KarlRove Obama was happy to bring the temple down if things didn't go his way. Like Saddam did w/ scorched earth
822873285520224256 2017-01-21 18:27:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BarackObama @krauthammer @KarlRove For all the shallow talk of "grace" and "healing", the real story is this here...

822866593210388480 2017-01-21 18:00:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @thetimes @RussianEmbassy Such hatred for democracy...

822796568940179456 2017-01-21 13:22:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Good. Keep the losers out.
822570151648391169 2017-01-20 22:23:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WhiteHouse @jaketapper @EricHolthaus We all live here, no one wants to live in a toxic waste dump. We just need to balance.
822569596817461250 2017-01-20 22:20:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WhiteHouse @jaketapper @EricHolthaus See, healing is already starting. Off to a good start!
822569405443883009 2017-01-20 22:20:03 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WhiteHouse @jaketapper @EricHolthaus But shutting down whole industries is just cruel to the ppl it affects.
822568848310370306 2017-01-20 22:17:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WhiteHouse @jaketapper @EricHolthaus There is a reasonable middle ground, and most ppl are for that. Even Trump people.
822568563378634752 2017-01-20 22:16:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TrumpDC @POTUS @GSA @jaketapper That's legally incorrect. Sad.
822568366846132230 2017-01-20 22:15:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WhiteHouse @jaketapper @EricHolthaus There is a middle-ground which is sensible.
822568225133252608 2017-01-20 22:15:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WhiteHouse @jaketapper @EricHolthaus But many ppl essentially want to destroy everything achieved in industrialization.
822568016948953088 2017-01-20 22:14:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WhiteHouse @jaketapper @EricHolthaus My point is more general, not combative. There is a lot of history we just can't know.
822567417599709184 2017-01-20 22:12:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WhiteHouse @jaketapper @EricHolthaus I mean both. Enough uncertainty to justify not bringing the temple down over co2.
822567205019783171 2017-01-20 22:11:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WhiteHouse @jaketapper @EricHolthaus Fact is the science is young. There is no free atmospheric data from 600,000 yrs ago.
822564702047895552 2017-01-20 22:01:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WhiteHouse @jaketapper @EricHolthaus It is not settled that ice core measurements are accurate.
822551648711086082 2017-01-20 21:09:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WhiteHouse @jaketapper @EricHolthaus That's factually incorrect.
822527074774618113 2017-01-20 19:31:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WhiteHouse @jaketapper @EricHolthaus The climate is not static - it is constantly changing. Wasting time and money on it is silly.
822518261002579968 2017-01-20 18:56:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JuanSaaa @aravosis @realDonaldTrump doesn't need a flag pin - he is America.
822517924199964672 2017-01-20 18:55:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JuanSaaa @REMEZCLA In this image, I see two law enforcement officers following the law. Why is that bad or racist or draconian?
822517330940805120 2017-01-20 18:53:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JuanSaaa @REMEZCLA I would do nothing to stop it since I believe we should all follow the law, particularly uninvited guests in our country

821490291865751553 2017-01-17 22:52:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Jeanjeannie20 So the (soon-to-be) President of the United States isn't allowed to speak freely? Interesting take on reality!

821197007989735425 2017-01-16 03:26:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @MrWonderfulPop @realDonaldTrump is a public official using technology to communicate with citizens. Jake mostly tweets rubbish.

820689971879223296 2017-01-15 17:51:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls @LionelMedia @poppyme4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkB9OT2XVvA
820689874466570241 2017-01-15 17:51:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls @LionelMedia @poppyme4 They portray Kelly as a weak, ugly yes-man ashamed of knowing Trump. It's really weird TBH.
820688560806359042 2017-01-15 17:46:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @poppyme4 @LionelMedia @KellyannePolls Just watched SNL Trump/Kelly sketches for 1st time... pretty awful stuff - particularly 4 Kelly. Sad!
820686214839861252 2017-01-15 17:36:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Denis44 @jaketapper At what point, exactly, do you think you will have sufficiently covered the "Russia" angle? Is there anything else?
820492671814864896 2017-01-14 04:47:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @repjohnlewis @jaketapper @lpolgreen Proud partisan he is. But his statements about Trump are inexcusably dumb and unpatriotic.
820438898555977730 2017-01-14 01:14:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising As a society we should come together and collectively admit that some of us are just stupid idiots. Katy is one of them.
820438138162216960 2017-01-14 01:11:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @justinamash Why, because Louis is black he can't defend himself? What a racist bigot!
820426988452249601 2017-01-14 00:26:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump I agree. He should focus on his job and be effective for those depending on him - not disparaging elected leaders.
820421465858338817 2017-01-14 00:04:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @WeMeantWell What do you think of non-president Louis' stupidity? I don't think you know what courage is.
820421202749652994 2017-01-14 00:03:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper She did more than non-president Louis.
820391877778296832 2017-01-14 22:07:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @uesspo @poppyme4 @We_R_Trump waaannnnwannnnn
820391609607028736 2017-01-14 22:06:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @poppyme4 @NumbersMuncher @jonfavs Ah, the losers telling us what's what... Trump election making good business for DC shrinks
820362054838218752 2017-01-14 20:08:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @poppyme4 @brithume Non-president Lewis can rest on his laurels all he wants. He is still accountable to those he tries to deminish.
820361760150552577 2017-01-14 20:07:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @poppyme4 @brithume Correct. Crime stats, unemployment show he isn't doing much for Atlanta. Work for you district, not your mouth.
820360794470813698 2017-01-14 20:03:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JordanUhl @tonyposnanski Maybe if non-president Lewis worked for Atlanta the way he works his mouth, he wouldn't need to reach back 60 yrs
820360558109192192 2017-01-14 20:02:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JordanUhl @tonyposnanski Non-president John Lewis attacked soon-to-be-president Donald Trump. Not the other way around.
820360228508237827 2017-01-14 20:01:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @repjohnlewis @JordanUhl That's so sad. You grovel at the feet an ineffective government official who does nothing about crime and jobs
820359825016160256 2017-01-14 19:59:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JordanUhl Non-president Lewis attacked first. Maybe he should have done more in the last 60 years - see crime, unemployment in Atlanta
820359553577611264 2017-01-14 19:58:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JordanUhl @repjohnlewis Good thing 2017 isn't 55 years ago. Get a grip, non-president Lewis.
820359349604352002 2017-01-14 19:58:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @repjohnlewis @realDonaldTrump @JordanUhl @RepTimRyan Actions 60 years ago don't make Lewis good at his job today - see crime stats.
820358861525807104 2017-01-14 19:56:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @repjohnlewis @realDonaldTrump @RepYvetteClarke Non-president John Lewis should smarten up.
820358491374284801 2017-01-14 19:54:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @repjohnlewis @realDonaldTrump @RepYvetteClarke By all accounts, his civil rights history doesn't make him good at his job - see crime stats
820358096807727105 2017-01-14 19:53:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RussianEmbassy Ya, right.... and be hacked by the Americans. No thanks.

820170752297144320 2017-01-13 07:28:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BreitbartNews @RNRNCarolina is it just me or does he look like a snapping turtle? No offense...
820166414149500929 2017-01-13 07:11:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CallyGingrich @HamiltonMusical @newtgingrich Clearly they had no idea who you are.
820056633204178944 2017-01-13 23:55:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Strong and smart are key assets I would suggest...
820055338787500032 2017-01-13 23:50:03 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> What a biased piece of crap: In remarkable exchange with undocumented mom, Paul Ryan exposes cruelty of Trumpismhttp://wpo.st/EPUR2
820023106362286080 2017-01-13 21:41:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks What about threat conditions?
820018958019469313 2017-01-13 21:25:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @PEOTUS @bobschieffer @jaketapper Back in the day, you shot and thought about the piece while the film was in the soup. Think more folks!
820018692352315395 2017-01-13 21:24:26 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @PEOTUS @bobschieffer @jaketapper Bob is the type of serious, considered journalist we need more of.
820016411879804928 2017-01-13 21:15:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising @realjunsonchan I disagree. He is well-suited to explaining our ideas to Dems. They respond well to goofy ppl like Ryan.
820015972388143108 2017-01-13 21:13:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump @RussianEmbassy Everyone that matters is smart enough to understand.
820015860333027328 2017-01-13 21:13:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump @RussianEmbassy Nothing happening in public discourse if of real relevance to RU-US relationship.
820008332907966469 2017-01-13 20:43:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper At what point do we admit that some politicians are, in fact, just stupid?
820007444634025984 2017-01-13 20:39:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper The clowns on the left are working hard to make sure they have no credibility whatsoever.
820007062503563266 2017-01-13 20:38:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KarlRove @iprior1177 I would agree, only that "Hollywood" is not open to re-configuring their thinking.
819793706546925568 2017-01-12 06:30:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DanScavino There should be a government office that produces a pundit ranking based on accuracy. That would inject some seriousness into it
819792386054197248 2017-01-12 06:25:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DanScavino @BillKristol Ohhh! So you mean I should be wrong more and harder? Well that's what I've been doing wrong! Geez thanks Bill!
819792022877765634 2017-01-12 06:23:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DanScavino @BillKristol : Proud to be "spectacularly wrong". And that's why America is so great at winning, folks!
819791167097180160 2017-01-12 06:20:19 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DanScavino @BillKristol Maybe we should outsource Looney Tunes punditry to Mexico. I think we are overpaying.
819790703488155648 2017-01-12 06:18:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DanScavino And yet @BillKristol is still an "expert". American punditry: the only job where you can be 100% wrong and still have a job.
819790225924702209 2017-01-12 06:16:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @AceofSpadesHQ Just let the media run around a bit longer, they'll tire out eventually... but no more sugar cereal for breakfast!
819700018470854657 2017-01-12 00:18:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising Chick-fil-A is an A-class organization. Seriously. Everything that makes America great - a caring, humane organization
819696935309312001 2017-01-12 00:05:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDennisLynch @RedNationRising I think everyone involved with slavery in this country is dead and gone. Probably time to move on.

819424008844283904 2017-01-11 06:01:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN Has being fair and reasonable ever crossed your mind? What drives you to hunt for problems?
819400013705084930 2017-01-11 04:26:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @zhu_amy3 @realDonaldTrump Thanks for being honest in a dishonest world.
819394200546459648 2017-01-11 04:02:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump We can see through the garbage, don't worry about us.
819393039965757440 2017-01-11 03:58:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @carlbernstein With "journalism" like this, maybe the public would be better off if you didn't try so hard.
819391998679535616 2017-01-11 03:54:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper You had enough information to properly contextualize the story, but decided not to for ideological reasons. We all know that.
819391379969343488 2017-01-11 03:51:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper You knew the material presented came from a steaming pile of bullshit, but reported as it it could be true. Misleading and sad.
819391150591246336 2017-01-11 03:50:48 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper So you completely mischaracterized the story. Misleading and dishonest.
819387559956639744 2017-01-11 03:36:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WSJ @KarlRove Top Tip: Don't get distracted, remain practical and pragmatic.
819366645240041472 2017-01-11 02:13:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @AwardsDaily This Stone person obviously has serious mental issues which need to be addressed. Please visit your doctor.

819361167978201089 2017-01-11 01:51:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @poppyme4 @mposner @carlbernstein had his 15 minutes a loooong time ago! Carl and CNN have a lot in common in that respect.
819360567781715968 2017-01-11 01:49:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @Acosta @seanspicer In what demented universe is it appropriate to yell at the President-Elect of the United States?! Only @ CNN
819360183130456064 2017-01-11 01:47:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @seanspicer @Acosta Obviously Jim has never interacted with other humans before. Rude and disgraceful!
819337948437114880 2017-01-11 00:19:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNN @AC360 @KellyannePolls I'm surprised you participate in the production of fake news by appearing on CNN.
819335382512898048 2017-01-11 00:09:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NASA @jaketapper @rocastan I see huge variations over time. Are you sure this supports your point and not mine? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_core#/media/File:Vostok_Petit_data.svg
819324745346904064 2017-01-11 23:26:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NASA @jaketapper @rocastan So point me to a brief, highly persuasive document or chart demonstrating what you are saying.

819310461548118017 2017-01-11 22:30:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @RandPaul @poppyme4 @FoxNewsInsider The border or government - which leaks more?
819310112225501185 2017-01-11 22:28:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jpodhoretz @poppyme4 Being an idiot has for too long had no consequences in the world of mainstream American journalism. Sad fact.
819309184755843073 2017-01-11 22:25:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @RandPaul @poppyme4 @FoxNewsInsider They should be - send that message early on.
819308752482357248 2017-01-11 22:23:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @poppyme4 @jpodhoretz Memo: All FBI agents are hereby only allowed to pursue lines in inquire that are not total bullshit fabrications.
819307928117252100 2017-01-11 22:20:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @poppyme4 @jpodhoretz Pardon me, I'm confused as to the substantive difference between "bullshit" and "real". But I'm not alone.
819307657173565446 2017-01-11 22:19:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca But are you anything to anyone?
819307473978933248 2017-01-11 22:18:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Ya, ruin the relationship with Russia before it even starts. That's brilliant!
819303748153540608 2017-01-11 22:03:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NASA @jaketapper Notice it says "warmest on record" That record is 135 years! How long has the planet Earth been spinning around the sun?
819303045414666245 2017-01-11 22:00:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NASA @jaketapper @rocastan Then why does this persuasive graph only go back to 1880? I want to see the real trend if it is so accurate.
819302310656491528 2017-01-11 21:57:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca If you are considering suicide, please seek help. There is hope.
819301082627194885 2017-01-11 21:52:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NASA @jaketapper We don't have millions of years worth of data to compare "today" to. We have no idea what is really going on.
819297465132269571 2017-01-11 21:38:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper More weird stories from failed CNN.
819265444943187970 2017-01-11 19:31:17 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca We all know the only thing that would "satisfy" critics like you would be if @realDonaldTrump was not president. So drop the act
819264224090292225 2017-01-11 19:26:26 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca His prior business dealings - which are in those folders - are not a matter of public record. How obtuse are you?
819263905759449093 2017-01-11 19:25:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca "Ethical equivalent of a handshake"... what?
819263574161887232 2017-01-11 19:23:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca His legal obligation is to do nothing. Do you understand that?
819263459342819328 2017-01-11 19:23:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Well, thank you for your expert legal opinion. We most certainly do appreciate it.
819243269448204296 2017-01-11 18:03:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @CNN CNN has just become a sad joke. Remember the first Gulf War? You were the boss. Just tragic...
819242347473076228 2017-01-11 17:59:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN @mj_lee There have been suggestions that this material was included as an instructional aid to contrast w/ real intel. Comment?
819241924536188928 2017-01-11 17:57:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN @mj_lee Carefully sourced through anonymous leaks.

819238695496798208 2017-01-11 17:45:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @RedNationRising No bullshit, just substance. Even called crap crap. Things are looking up for America.
819234928869183488 2017-01-11 17:30:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN No doubt so humiliation could take place up close and personal.
819226494295834625 2017-01-11 16:56:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @JasonMillerinDC @SchneiderCNN That's not what he said. He said Emoluments doesn't apply, but will donate anyway.
819225753862701058 2017-01-11 16:53:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN @ZekeJMiller Suck on that CNN.
819220856337551360 2017-01-11 16:34:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @jaketapper Because it's confidential you schmendrick
819217219787915265 2017-01-11 16:19:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN @KilloughCNN So you reported secondhand bullshit. Even better.
819216676722016257 2017-01-11 16:17:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN @ddale8 You mean doing his job?
819213994347073536 2017-01-11 16:06:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @ReaganWorld If only Democrats would learn myopathy a good government does not make.

819196322414809089 2017-01-11 14:56:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @poppyme4 @dmartosko So many Jewish lawyers! Who can keep track?
819195362871300101 2017-01-11 14:52:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @poppyme4 @edhenry This feels like a bad lawyer joke had sex with a bad Jew joke.
819046802309660672 2017-01-10 05:02:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks So, they see their job as being a poorly moderated message board?

819036890456174596 2017-01-10 04:23:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca I agree. Project strength and power. My God what have we become...
819034139701768193 2017-01-10 04:12:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @PacificStand Hellscape for another ten days...
819031029424025600 2017-01-10 03:59:48 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BuzzFeed @poppyme4 @joelpollak Wonder where the bottom is... Afraid of what it looks like.
819029130830290944 2017-01-10 03:52:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper You guys at CNN really long for the 1990's huh?
819028760817242112 2017-01-10 03:50:48 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @dan_rar @bmaynards5 That we know of.
819025860045000704 2017-01-10 03:39:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @GOP @bmaynards5 I'll take risk of incompetence/corruption over proven incompetence/corruption any day.
819020674421456896 2017-01-10 03:18:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @RadioFreeTom The McDonald's of journalism here...
819019205207064577 2017-01-10 03:12:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Cernovich @poppyme4 @LeviathanAurora Much obliged.
819017425802891271 2017-01-10 03:05:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Cernovich @poppyme4 @LeviathanAurora But it appears an actual British person did have a hand in drafting it. Am I missing something?
819015550076653568 2017-01-10 02:58:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @poppyme4 @michaelbd How far we've fallen...
819005714064609280 2017-01-10 02:19:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ramzpaul And trolled they were...
818996120697401344 2017-01-10 01:41:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DanScavino @MichaelCohen212 To be fair, movement across EU internal borders would not be recorded in his passport.
818995999683280896 2017-01-10 01:40:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @poppyme4 @maggieNYT To be fair, movement across EU internal borders would not be recorded in his passport.
818995375013036032 2017-01-10 01:38:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DanScavino @MichaelCohen212 You should visit - it's a great city.
818994635246891008 2017-01-10 01:35:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper CNN dropping the ball... if only that were news...
818991891379322880 2017-01-10 01:24:17 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TrumpInaugural I'm nervous about winning. It's been so long...
818990845210796033 2017-01-10 01:20:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump The media should quit in shame.
818986884403724290 2017-01-10 01:04:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @brosandprose Ya, you really showed those Aleppo orphans who's resilient!

818981034599522304 2017-01-10 00:41:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @Patrick_134 @dan_rar Weak argument. So much for progress.
818980207063400448 2017-01-10 00:37:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @Patrick_134 @dan_rar Google the list of US government agencies hacked in the last 8 years. It's shocking.
818979321775800321 2017-01-10 00:34:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @Patrick_134 @dan_rar No, I'm blaming Pres. Obama for doing a bad job protecting our democracy for foreign attack.
818978992682336256 2017-01-10 00:33:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @Patrick_134 @dan_rar So we agree. Russia hacked the DNC and Obama let it happen through weak cyber policy.
818978207277924352 2017-01-10 00:29:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @Patrick_134 @dan_rar If it is true, Obama sure did a bad job with cyber security, didn't he?
818976976308465664 2017-01-10 00:25:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @Patrick_134 @dan_rar Individuals briefed on the issue disagree with your allegation.
818976693369131009 2017-01-10 00:23:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @dan_rar Oh, so the government is a little responsible too, huh?
818976409775460353 2017-01-10 00:22:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @Patrick_134 @dan_rar You're the one making the allegation - you prove it.
818975974549241858 2017-01-10 00:21:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @Patrick_134 @dan_rar So cyber security is not something the federal government should worry about? Interesting.
818975737759879169 2017-01-10 00:20:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @dan_rar @Patrick_134 A lot of knowledgeable people would disagree with that assertion.
818974679725645824 2017-01-10 00:15:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @coreykindberg @CarlsonMAGA @JoshuaWebb2 Dnde est el bao?
818973024208687104 2017-01-10 00:09:19 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @Patrick_134 @dan_rar Obama should have prevented the Russians from hacking any US organization. He didn't.
818972891131875328 2017-01-10 00:08:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @Patrick_134 @dan_rar They ATTEMPTED to hack the RNC, but failed to get in. Big difference. DNC was hacked.
818972665067278336 2017-01-10 00:07:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @coreykindberg @CarlsonMAGA @JoshuaWebb2 Once guy you don't like isn't going to destroy the country. Get a grip.
818972363844894720 2017-01-10 00:06:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @Patrick_134 @dan_rar Was that chart made on a computer with the password "password"? If not, DNC didn't make it
818971164806619136 2017-01-10 00:01:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @Patrick_134 @dan_rar Shocking that the incompetent schmendricks at the DNC thought they could run a country.
818965730129543168 2017-01-10 23:40:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @dbergg @bou30221 Weird discussion - but anyway, Obama presided over all this hacking, not Trump.
818961590372409345 2017-01-10 23:23:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @Patrick_134 @PaulScotAugust Are you talking to me?
818960460833820672 2017-01-10 23:19:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @Patrick_134 @PaulScotAugust I got 12 rubles today!

818953186190983170 2017-01-10 22:50:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @Patrick_134 Nothing. He's still a private citizen. Obama is still in charge of cyber security.
818951737331634177 2017-01-10 22:44:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @dbergg Well Mr. Obama seems to have done very little to save us from hacking thus far... so I don't have much hope
818951513095675906 2017-01-10 22:43:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @Patrick_134 I'm saying he is responsible for all this hacking as he was and is the actual POTUS! Fair, no?
818950171178450944 2017-01-10 22:38:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @Patrick_134 Might also consider that President Obama allowed all this to happen. Just a thought...
818949470205472768 2017-01-10 22:35:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @jaketapper @Patrick_134 That Russia is an equal opportunity hacker and has been for decades.
818948755265376256 2017-01-10 22:32:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @WLTaskForce I thought publishing illegally obtained government information was... illegal. I learned that on CNN btw
818948484816572417 2017-01-10 22:31:48 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @coreykindberg Why are you so negative? Where are all these neo-Nazis you're afraid of?
818948201197817856 2017-01-10 22:30:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @TheLeadCNN @WLTaskForce I thought publishing illegally obtained government information was.. illegal. I learned that on CNN btw
818936424837902336 2017-01-10 21:43:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Does your dad approve of you being an angry feminist?
818936210999615490 2017-01-10 21:43:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Please, tell the angry mob more about your family. That most surely will turn out well.
818933657738051590 2017-01-10 21:32:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @mashable Mashable just said you got your "15 minutes"... that must hurt as a professional woman.
818932805220597760 2017-01-10 21:29:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CNN @laurenduca Sucks, don't it?
818932519110328320 2017-01-10 21:28:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Luceobrien What makes her "fierce"? It seems the criteria for these titles is rather vague and bar set pretty low.
818918773814153216 2017-01-10 20:33:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @deelizabeth_ @NoPartyPolitix I thought it was pretty good by my standards.
818914786910015488 2017-01-10 20:17:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @deelizabeth_ @NoPartyPolitix And deal I shall! Deal I shall my good man! Good day to you, I say!
818914564154785792 2017-01-10 20:17:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @deelizabeth_ @NoPartyPolitix What's wrong with being an ass? Asses perform vital functions in society critical to our survival.
818913795053592576 2017-01-10 20:13:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @deelizabeth_ @NoPartyPolitix Ha! Again the matriarchy "telling" a man he is without merit. Despicable!
818913343083782144 2017-01-10 20:12:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @deelizabeth_ @NoPartyPolitix Duca-feminists are super brave until mean words are said, then they are victims of society. Cute.
818911974658572288 2017-01-10 20:06:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @deelizabeth_ @NoPartyPolitix I did indeed intend to diminish her as her points were devoid of merit. Thanks 4 being perceptive
818909480800944128 2017-01-10 19:56:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeenVogue @laurenduca @saraashleyo That's pretty good! Did your husband help you write it?
818908661825368064 2017-01-10 19:53:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @TeenVogue @BewhiskeredGuy Well, you're welcome! Muaaa!
818908182080847873 2017-01-10 19:51:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeenVogue @laurenduca @DCampoamor @johnslimy So much rape talk, yet so little raping...
818908070323613697 2017-01-10 19:51:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @TeenVogue @BewhiskeredGuy I say they are both within their rights so long as the disagreement remains twitter-based.
818906665944813568 2017-01-10 19:45:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @deelizabeth_ The authoress refers to herself as "defiant" vis--vis her professional activities. But how so?
818905879655354368 2017-01-10 19:42:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeenVogue @laurenduca @DCampoamor @johnslimy Well, the commentator did not suggest to the exclusion of all other activities.
818905675967463426 2017-01-10 19:41:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @TeenVogue @BewhiskeredGuy Her positions on many facets of contemporary political discourse are completely absurd.
818902638632779776 2017-01-10 19:29:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @TeenVogue @BewhiskeredGuy First, do you think the "threats" in question are genuine? Have the police been alerted?
818902115686957057 2017-01-10 19:27:33 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeenVogue @laurenduca @johnslimy @DCampoamor So am I.
818901725134422017 2017-01-10 19:26:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @TeenVogue @BewhiskeredGuy Those are likely a visceral reaction to the pomposity displayed in much of her political writing.
818901281800617985 2017-01-10 19:24:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeenVogue @laurenduca @johnslimy @DCampoamor Many women go through an "insufferable feminist" phase - it might pass.
818900042874494976 2017-01-10 19:19:19 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @deelizabeth_ @NoPartyPolitix My "agenda" is where I write down my appointments. So, no.
818899808354242566 2017-01-10 19:18:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @TeenVogue Professional women everywhere deserve the respect of having their work critically evaluated - unless you're Ms. Duca.
818898994495627264 2017-01-10 19:15:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @deelizabeth_ @NoPartyPolitix My point was always that any gender can rape and be raped. That was my point. So...
818898327249031168 2017-01-10 19:12:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @deelizabeth_ Well, everyone is claiming she is "defiant", so it goes to reason she must be defying something.
818898072700862464 2017-01-10 19:11:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @deelizabeth_ Love you too! From a warrior god.
818897943575072769 2017-01-10 19:10:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeenVogue @laurenduca @DCampoamor Oh, very.
818897560584781825 2017-01-10 19:09:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @deelizabeth_ But is it "defiant"?
818897431660261376 2017-01-10 19:08:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeenVogue @laurenduca @DCampoamor I'm neither angry nor a magical little person. But thank you for the attention.
818896992956981248 2017-01-10 19:07:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeenVogue @laurenduca @DCampoamor Nothing you have done or written is actually "defiant". Just be aware of that.
818893846679617537 2017-01-10 18:54:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @AlannaBennett If you are suicidal, please seek appropriate help.
818889501523279873 2017-01-10 18:37:26 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeenVogue @laurenduca @saraashleyo I'm not getting the point... please elucidate.
818887566296514567 2017-01-10 18:29:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @deelizabeth_ @NoPartyPolitix Notice: Sex is possible with all gender combinations. And you call yourself a liberal!
818885668113960960 2017-01-10 18:22:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @deelizabeth_ @NoPartyPolitix I think rape is an equal opportunity sex crime.
818885166101884928 2017-01-10 18:20:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @deelizabeth_ You call yourself a "warrior goddess"... and you wonder where the hate comes from...
818884671920599041 2017-01-10 18:18:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @deelizabeth_ The harassment you have been subjected to has little to do with your gender, everything to do with your writing.
818876298365927424 2017-01-10 17:44:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BreitbartNews @JasonMillerinDC I thought the whole liberal shtick was to be loving and accepting of everything and everyone...
818731268141617152 2017-01-10 08:08:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @NoSteppeOnPepe @digitalbrain242 There is no honor in crushing an enfeebled adversary. We win with honor now. Thank you & bye.
818720943539421185 2017-01-09 07:27:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @NoSteppeOnPepe @digitalbrain242 Because I like winning. That's what we do now.
818719048716480516 2017-01-09 07:20:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @NoSteppeOnPepe @digitalbrain242 So you stand for nothing and fight against... nothing? How impressive.
818716754318950400 2017-01-09 07:10:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @NoSteppeOnPepe @digitalbrain242 I thought the liberal shtick was being open and loving to all shapes, sizes, colors, etc?
818715569360924672 2017-01-09 07:06:17 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @NoSteppeOnPepe @digitalbrain242 Factually shaming a person of size. That's really classy.
818709253477244928 2017-01-09 06:41:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @NoSteppeOnPepe @digitalbrain242 So being hateful is OK for you? Weird.
818691053888868353 2017-01-09 05:28:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca I'm proud to be part of the Rational Right. We are taking America forward. Once you win, you never go back.
818689737145937921 2017-01-09 05:23:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca All those are fantastic triggers for over-sensitive liberals and, frankly, provide decent humor to those watching.
818684530194337793 2017-01-09 05:02:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Makeup really is your friend.
818684440444538880 2017-01-09 05:02:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca You are so not funny.
818678365695725568 2017-01-09 04:38:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @amyschumer @laurenduca @NoSteppeOnPepe You disagree with his politics so you can call him a pork product. That's sooo special...
818676137341681665 2017-01-09 04:29:36 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Fat shaming?
818613948866039808 2017-01-09 00:22:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook I said it was odd she never once mentioned it despite the barrage of attacks, as it was an obvious deterrent.
818610042337394689 2017-01-09 00:06:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RealJamesWoods Ohh... I get it now...
818608479095181317 2017-01-09 00:00:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RealJamesWoods Why does Twitter incessantly suggest I follow you?
818607311652536320 2017-01-09 23:56:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Heritage @newtgingrich So annoying, Facebook always pesters you to sign-up.
818606851042512896 2017-01-09 23:54:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @BrentSnavely @jaketapper No, Obama did it... obviously. Best for last, etc.
818606660310695936 2017-01-09 23:53:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Have we ever considered investing in mental health - clinics, hospitals, day centers? Might be an idea...
818606273046388741 2017-01-09 23:51:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook What happened was more a clash of personalities than a gender-based conflict. The solution is not to homogenize the genders.
818605807755476993 2017-01-09 23:50:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook The "change" is to be practical and realistic - avoid characterizing every issue in gender terms, which are often unsuitable.
818583260594769920 2017-01-09 22:20:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook I haven't suggested any woman to change anything - at least not in relation to the present topic.
818582362661322752 2017-01-09 22:16:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook It would be, I guess, but it's not realistic. So, my suggestion would be to stick to pragmatic solutions rather than 'change men
818580421923307521 2017-01-09 22:09:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook No, being equal means being able to defend yourself - being smart and strong enough to do it and not depend on others to change.
818571124204138496 2017-01-09 21:32:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook Human history in this field tends to point to "yes".
818569655585370115 2017-01-09 21:26:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook My point is just that it plain isn't fun to hit on a married woman, so a lot of guys lose interest. Nothing about the man per se
818566565419515905 2017-01-09 21:14:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook Well since he owns her I doubt there is much affection. My dishwasher has a poor view of me... (I skip filling the rinse aid)
818566141727674369 2017-01-09 21:12:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook I didn't imply it - I said it outright and qualified it by saying I could be wrong.
818565909728071681 2017-01-09 21:11:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook Well I guess we agree to disagree 
818565415215464448 2017-01-09 21:09:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook All after Martin used the picture... anyway, I am only mentioning her not bringing it up counter to solicitations of sex etc
818564902067507203 2017-01-09 21:07:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook The impact on the one mentioning it is slight in terms of burden, but the impact on the idiots can be quite large -it's less fun
818564592754393088 2017-01-09 21:06:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook I think you can blame the idiots and mount a fuller defense against idiots without offending feminist sensibilities Just MHO.
818564279355998209 2017-01-09 21:05:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook I read a lot of the nonsense and I had no idea she was married until Martin showed up and used the picture... so...
818564030604472320 2017-01-09 21:04:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook And to be fair, I agree that it is a burden, but in this instance I consider mentioning a fact to be rather a slight one ATC.
818563860865105922 2017-01-09 21:03:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook You can blame twitter for letting people say nearly anything to anybody.
818563672167645184 2017-01-09 21:02:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook I don't deny that the information is available, only that she didn't mention it to shut down the pervs. Most of them had no idea
818563467728785408 2017-01-09 21:01:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook There are a lot of problems with this situation
818563141093232642 2017-01-09 21:00:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook In my view, most ppl make offers were under the impression that she was single and looking, since she never mentioned otherwise.
818562583544340481 2017-01-09 20:58:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook I never said "only", simply that it was one avenue of defense. It means you're not single or receptive to intimate offers. Fair?
818562297014657025 2017-01-09 20:57:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook No, I think you will find it means that your relationship status precludes the type of activity on offer, so they don't ask.
818562054101618688 2017-01-09 20:56:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Sadiq_Filastin Clearly I don't know - but given how such human interaction normally transpires, it raises modest questions.
818561792561582080 2017-01-09 20:55:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ErynnBrook I think the issue rests in the fact that certain feminists consider marriage a form of ownership - it's most certainly not.
818561024420937728 2017-01-09 20:52:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Sadiq_Filastin @ErynnBrook Martin got that from research, but I don't get why it's controversial to mention you're married?
818559132202582016 2017-01-09 20:44:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Sadiq_Filastin which makes me wonder if she preferred the attention. It's a reasonable conclusion IMHO.
818558889843105792 2017-01-09 20:43:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Sadiq_Filastin Not at all. I think unwanted advances happen all the time, and she didn't use obvious ways to end it...
818555942728069120 2017-01-09 20:31:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Sadiq_Filastin You don't have to, but if you truly wanted to end some of it, you would mention it. That's my point.
818552877455212552 2017-01-09 20:19:48 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Sadiq_Filastin If you think marriage is "collusion" with evil forces, you are beyond reason.
818552271776661504 2017-01-09 20:17:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising @MalindaByerly Who could stand to look at that face day in, day out.. ouff...
818551493108396036 2017-01-09 20:14:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Sadiq_Filastin No, but if it happens, why not use the most effective way to shut it down? That's why it's funny (and weird).
818540243276144640 2017-01-09 19:29:36 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Sadiq_Filastin If people are asking to have sex with you, they probably assume you're single. Most people correct the error
818538294820687876 2017-01-09 19:21:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Sadiq_Filastin Well, she mentions all the sincere and/or obscene propositions she gets, but never mentions shes not available.
818535910291730432 2017-01-09 19:12:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Sadiq_Filastin Why is what funny?
818505992589742080 2017-01-09 17:13:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump Do you ship to Mexico?
818321515708055552 2017-01-08 05:00:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> Excuse me? What "violence" are you referring to?
818319667492192256 2017-01-08 04:53:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca You put yourself in this position through your words and conduct. You are sure you are right, but not everyone agrees.
818266904162947072 2017-01-08 01:23:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RonJohnsonWI @greta @ScottWalker @SpeakerRyan @Reince @KellyannePolls I wish Hillary would accept responsibility for being lazy.
818263190295506949 2017-01-08 01:08:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @LevineChildrens @R4Rfoundation @JasonMillerinDC @gregolsen88 How cheap are you? Only 25K? That's like 6 minutes of your salary.
818261591393234944 2017-01-08 01:02:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MegaeraReina_ Well, you post a lot of selfies, but with drastically different bust size. So, logical question based on your own shared pics
818259833644351488 2017-01-08 00:55:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MegaeraReina_ Is that a padded bra?
818259350536024065 2017-01-08 00:53:26 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina These LGBT nuts have to be stopped.
818258035068076032 2017-01-08 00:48:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls If this keeps up, even terrorists will lose interest in destroying us.
818257795405512704 2017-01-08 00:47:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls Despicable and un-American.
818257640677588993 2017-01-08 00:46:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Hadas_Gold @KellyannePolls shame on you!
818254494995775488 2017-01-08 00:34:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Kt0213 @yoyao25 @yascaoimhin @calicremin Even Baby Gap is still the Gap.
818252799343554560 2017-01-08 00:27:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca It's a hopeful time for many.
818252069924667393 2017-01-08 00:24:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca I don't hate you.
818247074085044228 2017-01-08 00:04:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @WLTaskForce Clearly! Hey guys, at least try to hide your collusion, because this is just undignified.
818246149488381952 2017-01-08 00:00:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @pamfoundation Do you have sex with Julian when you visit him?
818237091209510912 2017-01-08 23:24:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Kt0213 @ChrisSl66335686 I don't think she has any really clear, disciplined views on any relevant topic.
818236804868538368 2017-01-08 23:23:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @megynkelly @laurenduca You're being "harassed" because of your pompous, self-important world view, not @realDonaldTrump
818236467541671939 2017-01-08 23:22:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @megynkelly @laurenduca you'd love the extra attention
818227220653178883 2017-01-08 22:45:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @fgcallari I'll survive.
818226811817566209 2017-01-08 22:44:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca What are your views on circumcision?
818226596997906432 2017-01-08 22:43:17 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @fgcallari To be fair, she did say it. So, my suggestion would be to blame the source.
818225869059670016 2017-01-08 22:40:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Kt0213 @fgcallari Pardon me?
818225199468384256 2017-01-08 22:37:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca I just had a shower, so that can't be it. Any other ideas? What's a check-in? I'm not flying anywhere tonight...
818224990806011904 2017-01-08 22:36:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Kt0213 @yoyao25 @fgcallari Well that certainly is hurtful. Very unbecoming of you if I dare say so.
818224783477342209 2017-01-08 22:36:04 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca I don't understand why you consider yourself "defiant". What are you defying exactly?
818224555261100032 2017-01-08 22:35:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Kt0213 @yoyao25 @fgcallari Correct. Gender is a form of discrimination. I just "am".
818224414982569985 2017-01-08 22:34:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @KrZy4NIN I think I did a pretty good job, so my efforts paid off, no?
818224203971358723 2017-01-08 22:33:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Until the Hillary-induced bombs vaporize you. Think about that. Seriously.
818224013113786373 2017-01-08 22:33:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Do you find all this new attention erotic?
818223859044335616 2017-01-08 22:32:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @KrZy4NIN I can read too. Congratulations all the same! I know basic literacy was a big feat for you.
818220420545576968 2017-01-08 22:18:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca is this worth it for you?
818217393822502912 2017-01-08 22:06:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Kt0213 @yoyao25 @yascaoimhin oh ya?
818217187622187008 2017-01-08 22:05:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca I'd say quite honestly if you have secrets your probably in for a hard time given contemporary cyber realities
818216734008233984 2017-01-08 22:04:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Kt0213 @yoyao25 @yascaoimhin I conceded that several tweets ago. Kind of you to reconfirm
818216180628471808 2017-01-08 22:01:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Kt0213 @yascaoimhin @yoyao25 bar to entry into the profession is startlingly low
818215791841738753 2017-01-08 22:00:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Kt0213 @yoyao25 @yascaoimhin I guess she wins on a technically...
818215253620170752 2017-01-08 21:58:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca you might also be sad that your yoga studio is nuked by Russia in the war Hillary was determined to start
818214855345897473 2017-01-08 21:56:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Kt0213 @yoyao25 @yascaoimhin teen vogue... So I guess she's a baby journalist. Good point!
818213953851498496 2017-01-08 21:53:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @ale_rivera correct that is the year
818213716160315392 2017-01-08 21:52:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @KrZy4NIN oh you can read minds in addition to picking hideous tattoos?
818211898105675776 2017-01-08 21:44:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca hope you don't use the cloud
818211675782475776 2017-01-08 21:43:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @ghandigun married people typically mention that fact when solicited for sex. It's generally an effective deterrent...
818210740435881989 2017-01-08 21:40:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @KrZy4NIN being married might be relevant info for those sad souls looking to fuck her, no?
818209898437767173 2017-01-08 21:36:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca one would think less men would solicit her if she cared to mention she wasn't single... pretty normal response for most people
818208088394268672 2017-01-08 21:29:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Funny that you never mention you have a husband.
818205514165260289 2017-01-08 21:19:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Martin is going to go after @davidmackau next. Pucker up!
818202492064428034 2017-01-08 21:07:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @davidmackau Oh, no! Whatever shall we do?!
818201254027464704 2017-01-08 21:02:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Get a car.
818197891860795397 2017-01-08 20:49:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Spacekatgal This Brianna Wu isn't even Asian... I clicked her pic for nothing.
818196194279231488 2017-01-08 20:42:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jack @laurenduca Can't hold your booze, huh? Don't tell Martin
818191333185699840 2017-01-08 20:23:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @EllVeekay72 He admitted to using legal entitlements in the tax code - ones Obama did nothing about for 8 years btw.
817893448007217152 2017-01-07 00:39:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @newtgingrich Oh that tie...
817885466162790401 2017-01-07 00:07:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @Maizysgrrrl His mother and all his grandparents were immigrants, so I guess you are slamming the American Dream? Move to Cuba!
817876959711608834 2017-01-07 23:33:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca You don't understand the tax code. What a foolish thing to say in public.
817853156562444288 2017-01-07 21:59:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Ohh snap! Bazinga!
817578290571603968 2017-01-06 03:47:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @maddow @laurenduca And for the record, darling, international border security is not racist. I don't see you leaving your doors unlocked.
817576911551533056 2017-01-06 03:41:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @maddow @laurenduca ... with incompetence like that, it's clear HRC & co were never in a position to run a country. We dodged a bullet!
817576484403548160 2017-01-06 03:39:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @maddow @laurenduca As with most HRC problems, they failed to secure their communications and left themselves open to attack....
817574361951567874 2017-01-06 03:31:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @maddow @laurenduca If the Russians had authored all the damaging emails themselves, and they were fake, this would be a different story.
817574085412712448 2017-01-06 03:30:26 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @maddow @laurenduca In what twisted universe is it supposed to be outrageous that voters considered true information in selecting a POTUS?
817573765332746240 2017-01-06 03:29:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @maddow @laurenduca HRC was undone by the truth about her and her team. Remember, everything that came out was true. Focus on that instead.
817498850571255808 2017-01-06 22:31:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @laurenduca Maybe they won't pay directly, but that doesn't mean Mexico won't pay. Border security is not racist!
817487810177404929 2017-01-06 21:47:36 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Try to remember we are talking about dissemination of true information. HRC and co. got hurt with their own words. Don't forget
817486262793859072 2017-01-06 21:41:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca If knowing the truth about you is enough to undermine your electability, then I think you have bigger problems than Putin.
817483559292338176 2017-01-06 21:30:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kurteichenwald Bengahzi was caused by a video.
817482386493603840 2017-01-06 21:26:03 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kurteichenwald Honestly, I think you have brain damage. Time to get an MRI.
817207427686924288 2017-01-05 03:13:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca I found your Pornhub video.
817185809208057857 2017-01-05 01:47:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @WLTaskForce If everything is so clear-cut, why aren't intel agencies trotting things out to even give the illusion of proof?
817178045593382912 2017-01-05 01:16:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kurteichenwald It's a miracle that you are employed.
817139278245466113 2017-01-05 22:42:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @newtgingrich For democrats, politics is talking, not doing. Tangible results are irrelevant so long as the "right" words were said.

817136782068371456 2017-01-05 22:32:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kurteichenwald You're such a nasty guy.
817097109052727297 2017-01-05 19:55:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kurteichenwald Tucker got promoted and you got humiliated. Must sting a little?
817096600304685060 2017-01-05 19:53:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kurteichenwald Relied on to start a war in Iraq and not stop 9/11. If this is victory, I want to lose.
817091354157268992 2017-01-05 19:32:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kurteichenwald You understand so little about the current reality, that your opinions are practically without value.
817091048044457986 2017-01-05 19:31:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kurteichenwald The real minimum wage is zero.
816846180902719488 2017-01-04 03:18:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Why do you tweet about sex so much?
816836475945971712 2017-01-04 02:39:26 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca RETIRE ALREADY!
816819415933140992 2017-01-04 01:31:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NapkinEater @kurteichenwald Why are you so angry all the time?
816771131692773376 2017-01-04 22:19:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Try making an effort to keep an open mind about events that have not yet unfolded. You'll do better.
816767554421227521 2017-01-04 22:05:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks @Evan_McMullin @SpeakerRyan @WLTaskForce @WanderinPoet helps make "Secret Lives of Politicians" a shorter, less interesting book.
816766833068036097 2017-01-04 22:02:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce @LevineJonathan A credible threat of exposure is obviously required to keep our government honest. Look at the facts.

816720213358088192 2017-01-04 18:57:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kurteichenwald Assange is the only one who actually knows. Our intel agencies are often wrong and you know it.
816486978921394176 2017-01-03 03:30:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @BrettRedacted Waste of tweets.
816088530942361601 2017-01-02 01:07:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jeffl76 @kurteichenwald You are really delusional. Seriously, seek medical attention.

815412532420771840 2016-12-31 04:21:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca You'll magically become a French schoolgirl?
815410299566247936 2016-12-31 04:12:19 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Maybe if you get drunk enough, Trump won't seem so bad. Worth a try.
815407274118221824 2016-12-31 04:00:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kurteichenwald Are you still embarrassed about the @TuckerCarlson interview?
815406264024973312 2016-12-31 03:56:17 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kurteichenwald Most agents are idiots, hence the long history of getting it wrong.
815406046550360064 2016-12-31 03:55:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaillilwayne @kurteichenwald I think it is the making fun of you that is amusing.
815405875951177729 2016-12-31 03:54:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kurteichenwald I'm not sure why anyone with any sense would listen to the ramblings of a loser like you.
815393486300135424 2016-12-31 03:05:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca OK I made fun of you, but I feel bad. Sorry and Happy New Year. Seriously.
815392886850088964 2016-12-31 03:03:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TuckerCarlson @laurenduca @NARAL Interested in, fine. Knowledgeable about, I think you have to actually work at that...
815391735333277696 2016-12-31 02:58:33 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca That top is really... interesting
815391509927366656 2016-12-31 02:57:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Who said it was a feminist issue? Are you saying men can't speak like valley girls?
814881573770297345 2016-12-30 17:11:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Some Bernie supporters certainly do need to shower.

814286571885236226 2016-12-28 01:47:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @carolynryan Is she trying to look sad and pathetic?
814286029360336896 2016-12-28 01:44:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca I miss when journalists were smart.

814172992750108677 2016-12-28 18:15:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JohnKerry @jaketapper - that SoS shouldn't be used as a consolation prize for failed presidential candidates.
814006447864418304 2016-12-27 07:13:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca How do you expect to find a husband with that kind of attitude?
814006242167361536 2016-12-27 07:13:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca That's just not correct. You really don't matter and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!
814005888033914880 2016-12-27 07:11:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TuckerCarlson @laurenduca waaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnn
814005829540151296 2016-12-27 07:11:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @GeorgeTakei @laurenduca I love that screen grab. The look on your face is priceless.
814005674451619840 2016-12-27 07:10:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @brianefallon @laurenduca Humbly suggest you pick another winner like HRC. Makes it easier for the rest of us.
814005476220399617 2016-12-27 07:10:03 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Are you coming out of it?
814005335065317377 2016-12-27 07:09:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca It's so cute when you get all serious.
814005181033697280 2016-12-27 07:08:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @PPact @laurenduca You might want to try condoms, or become a lesbian.
814005018600816640 2016-12-27 07:08:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Patriarchy! Adorable!
814004909037223936 2016-12-27 07:07:48 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @TheMarySue Is "feminist" now a synonym for "weak-minded"? Not sure about the use of "winner" either.
814004390529007616 2016-12-27 07:05:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca @HuffPostPol Such violent imagery! You war-mongering liberals disgust me.
814004134630268928 2016-12-27 07:04:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca Silencing you would accomplish nothing as nothing you say is of any importance.
814003888626040833 2016-12-27 07:03:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca You're so cute when you use big words like "patriarchal". Adorable!
814002808240402432 2016-12-27 06:59:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @laurenduca If @TuckerCarlson is a partisan hack, what kind of hack does that make you?
813963245568532484 2016-12-27 04:22:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @steph93065 I'm pretty sure pointing out a fact does not necessarily equate to a feeling of joy. I mean, they said it, right?
812352337629114368 2016-12-23 17:41:04 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SenRandPauI @jaketapper Proven winners who aren't interested in cashing in on their government positions. Seems good to me.
812151728913215488 2016-12-22 04:23:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @newtgingrich A true fashion icon.
811651018803052544 2016-12-21 19:14:17 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @BillClinton Bill Clinton is irrelevant now.
811626531768463361 2016-12-21 17:36:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @FoxNewsSunday What message is being sent to PE Trump?
811626461840949250 2016-12-21 17:36:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @FoxNewsSunday Do you think republicans would have acted in the same way?
811408328849035265 2016-12-20 03:09:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @Jordanfabian HRC loved press conferences, as we all know.
811404844024139776 2016-12-20 02:56:04 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper You need to get your head on straight, Jake. You're going off the rails a bit lately.
811029668484812805 2016-12-19 02:05:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KarlRove I've worked out a fool-proof system of predicting the future: the opposite of what the MSM say will happen.
810915737091080193 2016-12-19 18:32:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper And you support these lunatics by siding against PE Trump.
810258132882558976 2016-12-17 22:59:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina How about rounding them up at their rallies and checking papers. Would make our job easier...
810231398888013824 2016-12-17 21:13:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SheriffClarke She is absolutely, pathologically delusional. I feel the next 4-8 years will have plenty of reminders why the Dems lost
810230986852233225 2016-12-17 21:11:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @danieltobin Hmmm... a black president hearkening back to the "good old times". Fascinating.
809946466030616578 2016-12-16 02:21:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls You must read a lot of nutty comments judging by what people have posted here...
809946189160390657 2016-12-16 02:19:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls President Elect talking with Americans at a rally is fascism? Trump supporters called babies while HRC fans literally cry?
809904621334491137 2016-12-16 23:34:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper You're not as good as you used to be, so don't trow stones.
809899417776033792 2016-12-16 23:14:03 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @newtgingrich Total kolbasa.... just totally kolbasa.
809898091629449216 2016-12-16 23:08:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MKosinskiCNN @jaketapper Like many, I just don't understand why no evidence is shared publicly. Is blind faith really the American way?

809539005830328320 2016-12-15 23:21:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN I don't understand the sense of entitlement.
809507210757816320 2016-12-15 21:15:33 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @newtgingrich I'm really glad you're part of this movement. I always feel calmer listening to you talk.
809030466502266880 2016-12-14 13:41:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @newtgingrich What strikes me is how clear the Trump message is - it's like a "To Do" list for America.
808816499871911936 2016-12-13 23:30:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper If Russia really succeed in affecting a US election, that says more about us than it does about the Russians

808458694459473920 2016-12-12 23:49:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @mchancecnn @jaketapper If by "won" you mean a person who avowedly hates Russia is not POTUS, then you're right.

806158864332689408 2016-12-06 15:30:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @TeamTrump Liberal elite have no idea what American's really want. If this was dating, Dems would be permanently single.
806082606412414976 2016-12-06 10:27:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks @WLTaskForce @joly2u He is fearful of what might happen to him if he leaves. Fear of the future doesn't = detention. Sad but true
806080272076718085 2016-12-06 10:18:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DailySignal @RedNationRising I think we can safely put WWII behind us. Anyone agree?
806079958103691266 2016-12-06 10:16:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks @WLTaskForce He is not detained -- the Embassy is not keeping him locked-up. He is just afraid to leave. There is a difference.
806079607195607040 2016-12-06 10:15:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce With respect, he is free to leave -- he is just fearful of being (improperly) detained. There is a difference.

805821135321346048 2016-12-05 17:08:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SheriffClarke I'm pretty sure we enact laws with the intention that they be enforced. I seem to remember that for Grade 7 civics class....
805819453887815680 2016-12-05 17:01:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina @RNRVermont ... except for those working families who aren't Latino, black, illegal, gay, bisexual, transsexual......
805799838654734336 2016-12-05 15:43:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN Two renowned scientists like Al Gore and Ivanka Trump should get right to the bottom of the problem.

805749720157011968 2016-12-05 12:24:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @newtgingrich The US should not be forever beholden to a myriad of "traditions" when it comes to policy - domestic or foreign.
805678884649725953 2016-12-04 07:43:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SheriffClarke Time to stop using SOS as a consolation prize for losers.

805023126983557120 2016-12-03 12:17:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina @RNRTennessee Amazing that the US has "rule of law" cities not "law doesn't matter" cities.
805022717552398336 2016-12-03 12:15:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Good time to be a shrink in D.C. I guess.

804929089484132352 2016-12-02 06:03:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls @DefendingtheUSA It was really gracious of Team Trump to give Clinton the popular vote. Since they won everything else.
804886189920514048 2016-12-02 03:13:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump America is your home and Americans are your family. If you leave us, you should expect consequences. That's reality folks.
804600500364550144 2016-12-02 08:18:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls It was really gracious of you to give them the popular vote... since you won everything else.

803571925880451072 2016-11-29 12:10:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SheriffClarke Some people consistently forget that America is NOT closed to immigration. You just need to do it according to certain rules.
803571547160121344 2016-11-29 12:09:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SheriffClarke Why is showing ID such a terrible thing? I guess some people are ashamed of who they are.
803540094695116800 2016-11-29 10:04:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina Funny they all want to go to Canada, but not Mexico. Irony, right?
803539830747631616 2016-11-29 10:03:19 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina @FiveRights We give them a chance, and they turn on us. I think we have enough problems without this kind of stuff. Right?
803539445551075328 2016-11-29 10:01:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls That's because your integrity is beyond reproach.

801276750533492737 2016-11-22 04:10:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SheriffClarke @FoxNews Seal the border and only then consider giving legal status to some illegals already here. It's logical and fair.
801276393942196224 2016-11-22 04:09:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SheriffClarke @mikandynothem Ironic that Trumps owns golf courses, but it's Obama who couldn't spare the time away from green.

799991726542725120 2016-11-19 15:04:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @coolbreeeze_ Settling does not mean you admit guilt, it just means you don't want to waste money and time on lawyers over years.
799990820271067136 2016-11-19 15:00:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @coolbreeeze_ Excuse me? Crimes are proven by evidence before a judge, not on TV or a newspaper.
799988039678238722 2016-11-19 14:49:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @coolbreeeze_ And if you do those things you should expect consequences, like a ticket or spending the night in jail. Illegals get deported.

799977635073822721 2016-11-19 14:08:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @newtgingrich It is foolish to expect society to regulate itself in a leadership vacuum. Time to be rational once again.

798748152933138432 2016-11-15 04:42:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN Don't know why the media thinks they ought to have 24/7 access to the president / president-elect. They prefer it, but so what?
798746675229564928 2016-11-15 04:37:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Easy sell: keep illegals out rather than letting men in the women's bathroom. It's not rocket science.

798203108564156416 2016-11-14 16:37:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @KFILE They were confident they could win strictly with minority votes. @realDonaldTrump probably has a plan to win Latinos...
798161796070666240 2016-11-14 13:52:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @gaylelemmon We're really winning in Afghanistan! We really are fantastic at this war stuff.
798134043980144640 2016-11-14 12:02:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper American Public: Don't care.
798129278902636544 2016-11-14 11:43:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JeffreyGoldberg Recent events show they serve no legitimate journalistic purpose.
798129005337526273 2016-11-14 11:42:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @cnni They don't look starved to me.
798128884398964736 2016-11-14 11:42:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NYTBen @Phil_Mattingly Here's a plan: Let's stay out of foreign conflicts as they never seem to end well, or even end for that matter.
798128582262341634 2016-11-14 11:40:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Evan_McMullin Better than a religious crackpot like you.
798128306205794304 2016-11-14 11:39:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @seanhannity @jaketapper @brianstelter This decision is open to re-consideration in four years. Study hard, my friend!
798116783869657089 2016-11-14 10:54:04 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks @avilarenata Why don't you donate time?
798027147864485888 2016-11-13 04:57:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JasonMillerinDC @JudgeJeanine After fixing the border he may even give citizenship to some non-criminal illegals - you heard it here first
798014268457119745 2016-11-13 04:06:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @ZaidJilani Obama for Dear Leader! Obama for Dear Leader! Death to Enemies of the State! IRONY, YOU DIG?
797997895999844352 2016-11-13 03:01:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina ;)
797996669518245888 2016-11-13 02:56:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina After he fixes the border, of course...
797992370566332417 2016-11-13 02:39:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina I think @realDonaldTrump may give citizenship to non-criminal illegals & flip them to republican - you heard it here first.
797867190187802624 2016-11-13 18:22:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @jpodhoretz My fear is that if the media doesn't get the access they want, they will mess with Trump via his family.
797865305632428032 2016-11-13 18:14:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @countermoonbat The ultra-liberal left was foolish to think they could upend every traditional value without any real push-back.
797833722691088386 2016-11-13 16:09:17 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump What is wrong with the Times?! Have they completely lost it?
797816105410564096 2016-11-13 14:59:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Passive-aggressive much?
797814398525968385 2016-11-13 14:52:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump you got some splainin to do!pic.twitter.com/GtyshyXjI2
797809862386143232 2016-11-13 14:34:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump The media are not entitled to carte blanche and need to be accountable for their mistakes and earn respect.
797799455084789760 2016-11-13 13:53:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Take-home is always going to be that the Democrats manufactured a candidate and did so with bad information and poor judgement
797799135227191296 2016-11-13 13:51:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Interesting counter-point to the FBI letter: Trump won with hot mic recording and a dozen accusers - dubious as they may be.
797779966431674369 2016-11-13 12:35:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @nytimes @RedNationRising @Babbsgirl2 Hmmm.... trust a newspaper that forgot how to tell the truth. Of course! Said no one. Ever.
797654147474472960 2016-11-12 04:15:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @davecatanese Stupidity has had a good run, but time to move on. Good for him.
797653663300751362 2016-11-12 04:13:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @DanScavino Someone probably actually did yelled "stop the presses!" to get this out...
797645114461954048 2016-11-12 03:39:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @newtgingrich He ran a common sense campaign, and, as it turns out, American voters like common sense in a candidate. Not complicated.
797516016972505089 2016-11-12 19:06:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @kumailn @jaketapper Do you also speak English? Maybe try using it.
797515615678234625 2016-11-12 19:05:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Well they sure are projecting weakness to ISIS and all those watching their crying hissy fits. At least we dodged a bullet.
797499464940257280 2016-11-12 18:01:03 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @FrankLuntz As I recall, @realDonaldTrump was regularly criticized for not being an experienced politician... Go figure, right?
797481246846652416 2016-11-12 16:48:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @washingtonpost @SheriffClarke So am I.
797479414313328641 2016-11-12 16:41:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @washingtonpost @SheriffClarke I'm not sure how the definition of a free press relates to history. I'm sure you don't either.
797478898355163136 2016-11-12 16:39:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @SheriffClarke Trump wouldn't even blink at a bunch of unwashed, unemployed losers making trouble for no good reason.
797478571790827520 2016-11-12 16:38:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @washingtonpost @SheriffClarke Actually, unless it's on the Op-Ed page, it shouldn't be biased for or against anybody.
797478212854902784 2016-11-12 16:36:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @washingtonpost @SheriffClarke @CNN has been at the bottom for a long while though.
797477138936958976 2016-11-12 16:32:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @washingtonpost @SheriffClarke I have. The conclusions they form are nearly always anti-Trump. Not sure how that's a NEWSpaper
797476365834461184 2016-11-12 16:29:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SheriffClarke The @washingtonpost is the lowest form of journalistic life on this planet.
797475631587999744 2016-11-12 16:26:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @nytpolitics I'm pretty sure stigmatizing illegal immigrants is a good things, as criminal activity should carry stigma.
797474320163344386 2016-11-12 16:21:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @nytpolitics Ya, Hillary supporters beating up Trump voters. Definitely worrying.
797471793468444672 2016-11-12 16:11:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @FoxNewsSunday Hope to see @KellyannePolls for 2020
797471132190281728 2016-11-12 16:08:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising He knows he is in trouble. See? It's not so hard: tell other countries what you really think, and good things happen.
797470776702046209 2016-11-12 16:07:04 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @countermoonbat He's your president too. You'll learn to stop worrying and love the Trump.
797460817125851139 2016-11-12 15:27:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls in 2020?
797457677978738688 2016-11-12 15:15:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Headline should read: Fake expert got it wrong - No one surprised.
797451989172953088 2016-11-12 14:52:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper FART LOUDLY IN GENERAL DIRECTION OF CONGRESS.
797451613510111233 2016-11-12 14:50:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @bdomenech She was an absolutely horrible candidate chosen for all the wrong reasons.
797448884943351809 2016-11-12 14:40:04 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @jonnysun Trump: You're fired.
797448529539112960 2016-11-12 14:38:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @byrdinator Warm as Africa.
797444535013883904 2016-11-12 14:22:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @USPS @jaketapper @yardenkatz Maybe letting million of Latino immigrants into the country without a wide mandate to do so was a bad idea?
797444081064382464 2016-11-12 14:20:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @stevesilberman Is it not possible his outlook changed over time into what we now remember?
797443481429897216 2016-11-12 14:18:36 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CityJournal @SheriffClarke @ManhattanInst Respect for the law, diligence, honesty, fair-play should normally tie across social strata.
797442565884608513 2016-11-12 14:14:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @CityJournal @SheriffClarke @ManhattanInst If government were functioning effectively, there would not be such large urban-rural disconnect.
797439829713690624 2016-11-12 14:04:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SheriffClarke So much for the orderly transfer of power our (soon-to-be former) moral disciplinarians called for.
797436288597049344 2016-11-12 13:50:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NormOrnstein @KellyannePolls Oh, Norm... you look like a fool now.
797396215126069248 2016-11-12 11:10:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @crookedhillary She might have won by making voters feel sorry for her patheticness.
797341347736743936 2016-11-11 07:32:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @AnnCoulter Hopefully global warming will melt said snowflakes and I will quench my thirst from laughter with their vital essence.
797340536696815616 2016-11-11 07:29:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @AnnCoulter @michaelbd Voters seemingly don't appreciate Democratic moral disciplinarians. Who'd a thunk it, right?
797339526393757696 2016-11-11 07:25:31 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @AnnCoulter I see a marketing opportunity for @Gillette and Irish Spring.
797323277794279424 2016-11-11 06:20:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina America dodged a bullet... big time.
797323199864184832 2016-11-11 06:20:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina Their overwrought reaction to setback proves they would have been useless against ISIS and others fighting to harm us daily.
797321918466535424 2016-11-11 06:15:33 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina They thought they could lead the free world; sad they couldn't. :.(

797137003145871360 2016-11-11 18:00:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising And they scolded us to respect the democracy process. This country is a real circus.

797088017231933440 2016-11-11 14:46:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper You think @Microsoft designed @HillaryClinton supporters moral compass? Would explain why it's so out of whack. Time to update.

796937153628356608 2016-11-10 04:46:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @PortlandPolice Our society needs to accept diversity, to accept criminals and miscreants, as we are stronger together.
796936842616541184 2016-11-10 04:45:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @thegarance I think many voters are tired of being scolded about diversity.
796917385517154304 2016-11-10 03:28:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina @IngrahamAngle Ya, seriously. They think Trump is Hitler but would have stayed home during WWII.
796916519649193984 2016-11-10 03:24:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN @Acosta I don't think @realDonaldTrump owes reporters anything.
796901708186009600 2016-11-10 02:25:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @BecketAdams And that's why they lost. Badly.

796729941891153921 2016-11-10 15:03:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> How to explain @realDonaldTrump to children: he's going to keep you safe, let mommy and daddy have a job and keep men out of girls bathroom.

796726794967805952 2016-11-10 14:50:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising We can only hope so.
796724052702461952 2016-11-10 14:39:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina She really want's her illegal family to stay in America. She doesn't mind murdering us to do it. Trump was right.
796723094274605060 2016-11-10 14:36:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls I want to call Trump a genius, but he's really just a normal human, behaving like a human, not a robotic politician.
796717234064396289 2016-11-10 14:12:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @KellyannePolls The amount of violence emanating from Clinton supporters is shockingly incongruous with their espoused views.
796716685050908672 2016-11-10 14:10:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @KellyannePolls What a strangely unprincipled remark from our supposed moral disciplinarians.
796716507548053504 2016-11-10 14:09:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @KellyannePolls I take it present events that the orderly transfer of power only applies if said power is to @HillaryClinton
796715857049190404 2016-11-10 14:07:17 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @KellyannePolls The switch from warm and fuzzy to issuing fatwas is remarkably quick.
796715475510169600 2016-11-10 14:05:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @POTUS @KellyannePolls I though we were the violent ones? Have I been misinformed?
796714107508523009 2016-11-10 14:00:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN @alivitali Not like you guys would actually report anything if allowed.
796707123140972544 2016-11-10 13:32:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina We should do immigration offset with Mexico: every illegal farm worker we take, they take a liberal retard.
796706232635719680 2016-11-10 13:29:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina These losers have no idea what morons they are. They are why our nation is failing. Nothing else to do on a weekday?!

796695694048395264 2016-11-10 12:47:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper If there is a strong enough case indicating that she broke the law, of course she will be prosecuted. That's how the law works.
796695411952074753 2016-11-10 12:46:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper She lost because she represented all the worst parts of American politics, and Americans saw that.
796566744739549188 2016-11-09 04:14:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina They really look like they could use a shower. Is that just me?
796565913621463040 2016-11-09 04:11:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina @RNRArkansas It's objectively, factually nuts that ppl actually condemn us for enforcing laws we already have...
796564687156551680 2016-11-09 04:06:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina @RNRArkansas Some people deny reality and honestly, truly believe you can run a country like Sesame Street
796564490754097154 2016-11-09 04:05:48 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina @RNRArkansas Having to explain why ILLEGAL immigration isn't a good thing has become really disconcerting 2b honest.
796561660861382656 2016-11-09 03:54:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina @RNRArkansas When did a certain, fairly large, portion of our country become so weak and so nasty...
796548393451524096 2016-11-09 03:01:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina Democracy and the transition of power has a lot less meaning to these people when the shoe is on other foot. Sad. Sad. Sad.
796525762123878401 2016-11-09 01:31:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DanScavino I think talking honestly about things people actually cared about kinda helped.
796402766734192640 2016-11-09 17:23:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks Help is on the way! Hold tight!
796402416547602432 2016-11-09 17:21:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @ACLU And thence you shall lose bigly.
796401895933759488 2016-11-09 17:19:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JasonMillerinDC @KellyannePolls Who knew talking and acting like a normal human could win an election :)
796393485305712640 2016-11-09 16:46:17 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls So passive-aggressive.
796393406742175744 2016-11-09 16:45:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls It's marvelous.
796347978776592384 2016-11-09 13:45:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @darrensands Not really that shocking. Black people want jobs too.
796347804188708864 2016-11-09 13:44:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @Olivianuzzi Questions is, does MSM media have a path to redemption after this colossal failure.
796339523407855616 2016-11-09 13:11:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper The answer is they are worthless, biased people who are exceedingly bad at their jobs.
796323122576179200 2016-11-09 12:06:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DanScavino Just a suggestion @HuffingtonPostpic.twitter.com/0M34tgTmM3
796322742920318976 2016-11-09 12:05:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DanScavino If @HuffingtonPost had any dignity, they would shut down.
796313790513967104 2016-11-09 11:29:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DanScavino All those "scientific" pollsters need to be fired.
796313673341882369 2016-11-09 11:29:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls You did it, Kellyanne. Really a richly deserved win.
796304319985303552 2016-11-09 10:51:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RobbyMook Thanks for helping us win. #MAGA
796303809450385409 2016-11-09 10:49:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls @politico finally says something right: She couldnt escape being the wrong candidate for the political moment.
796285158550695936 2016-11-09 09:35:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper What happened to the Clinton fireworks? Do you think they get recycled? They must have lost their deposit anyway.

796269656386342912 2016-11-09 08:34:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising Dream of @HillaryClinton crying in her pillow.

796268873070747648 2016-11-09 08:31:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @HillaryClinton Unfortunately, most people were voting for Trump. Better luck next time, losers!
796268669076574208 2016-11-09 08:30:19 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @HillaryClinton You lost big time. Why? Because you're a loser.
796268437806817280 2016-11-09 08:29:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @HillaryClinton You lost.
796267690318934016 2016-11-09 08:26:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @mcuban Pack your bags and move to Canada.
796265880464171008 2016-11-09 08:19:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper You will be one of a great many journalists to now be unemployed.
796257999178186752 2016-11-08 07:47:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Sorry things didn't work out. You tried hard, but you couldn't swing it.
796257725357268992 2016-11-08 07:46:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @HillaryClinton NO WHITE HOUSE FOR YOU!
796250848225439744 2016-11-08 07:19:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @ali Four years without "access" is going to be hard for some in the media.
796250239053111296 2016-11-08 07:17:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls Just horrifying.
796245196597907456 2016-11-08 06:57:03 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls Can Clinton get a refund on the fireworks?
796242968076165120 2016-11-08 06:48:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper You're just all bad at your job. Accept it already.
796238301254422528 2016-11-08 06:29:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @mike_pence @KellyannePolls Kellyanne is nothing short of a genius.
796227503488544769 2016-11-08 05:46:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls Yet everyone in MSM denies any bias... I guess they are just really bad at their jobs
796205716688093184 2016-11-08 04:20:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls 2016 is the year of the silent majority.
796204687632449536 2016-11-08 04:16:04 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls CERTAIN polls missed it... which hurts CERTAIN people to admit.
796204163013046273 2016-11-08 04:13:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @KellyannePolls Bias hurts everyone, including those who practice it.
796195000077852673 2016-11-08 03:37:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Irony is they will have learned no lesson whatsoever from this experience (and will continue to enjoy free risotto).
796194445729230848 2016-11-08 03:35:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper And they said the mainstream media was bias... silly them! Am I right?
796189657482395648 2016-11-08 03:16:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper A lot of people knew they were wrong. Just no one at CNN.

795976286925488128 2016-11-08 13:08:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @samsteinhp After @wikileaks, Huffpost has no right to "report" on anything.
795955210124337152 2016-11-08 11:44:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @blaubok @RedNationRising @bfraser747 Hillary views involvement in foreign conflicts only as opportunity for her self-aggrandizement.
795793355653279745 2016-11-07 01:01:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @GovChristie @jaketapper Real story: Hillary needs celebrity musicians to get a crowd. Sad. #MAGA
795791996396810240 2016-11-07 00:56:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising She looks confused. Probably never seen that many people before.
795669738353356800 2016-11-07 16:50:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina @PrisonPlanet First time I've ever seen Hillary and Kindness used in in the same sentence. He's really off the rails.
795658986645123073 2016-11-07 16:07:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @FBI @RNRNCarolina @RNRArkansas I agree... But at least one more Trump voter.
795657984093261824 2016-11-07 16:03:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @FBI @RNRNCarolina @RNRArkansas The head of the FBI is afraid of being killed by Hillary. He probably did what he needed to do to stay alive
795642296515428352 2016-11-07 15:01:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Idiots for idiots. Makes sense.
795641959633195008 2016-11-07 15:00:00 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @wikileaks had some interesting things to say about @CNN and @realDonaldTrump interview questions. Care to weigh in?
795619080644374528 2016-11-07 13:29:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising @jaketapper What was it concerning?

795533769121796096 2016-11-06 07:50:05 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DanScavino Someone will write a pretty decent folk song based on today.
795533589093810176 2016-11-06 07:49:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DanScavino Absolutely epic day.

795520259717406720 2016-11-06 06:56:24 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @MayorRGiuliani Must be nice to a be a Clinton. Not sure advocating regime change at the Vatican was a wise position, though.
795502102122348545 2016-11-06 05:44:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @DanScavino If America doesn't put America first, who will?
795484539011239936 2016-11-06 04:34:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRMississippi @Missmudcake @RNRNCarolina More like gullible.
795483962575450112 2016-11-06 04:32:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising He's in fear for his life.
795481543485460480 2016-11-06 04:22:33 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina In other news... the war on Christmas begins
795479941290725376 2016-11-06 04:16:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Look, Hillary... that's called a "crowd". Do you understand now?
795479625899986945 2016-11-06 04:14:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @HillaryClinton @RNRNCarolina @RNRMaryland Bill Clinton sex party... I can think of nothing more repulsive. Except for Hillary Clinton.
795479007990988800 2016-11-06 04:12:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN Only 5? Disappointing.
795478893150904320 2016-11-06 04:12:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DanScavino Look at all those smart people. Picking a better future over a lying, manipulative hypocrite.
795460035778265088 2016-11-06 02:57:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @newtgingrich I wonder if he actually fears for his life.
795459695012028416 2016-11-06 02:55:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @nathanguttman I agree. The Trump campaign didn't make any of those people Jewish or put them in their positions.
795330238351691776 2016-11-06 18:21:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks @WLTaskForce @FIRChristian @HillaryClinton GO BACK TO BED!
795321234892460033 2016-11-06 17:45:33 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper I like you Jake, but you're not match for @KellyannePolls. Even exhausted she runs circles around you. Just saying.
795318448117182464 2016-11-06 17:34:28 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Someone yelled "gun". Obviously that person wanted to give the impression of there being a gun.
795314631627722752 2016-11-06 17:19:19 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Al Franken used to be funny before he became insufferable.

795305710070296576 2016-11-06 16:43:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls The prediction people have been pretty bad this year, what with the Cubs and Brexit, so, my bet is on @realDonaldTrump
795305365072060417 2016-11-06 16:42:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls Some clever lawyer will come up with the Clinton Defense... get you out of taxes, FBI investigations, parking tickets, &ct.

795290319499579392 2016-11-06 15:42:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump It was good. It was actually informative.

795246847140843520 2016-11-06 12:49:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @nypost @JasonMillerinDC Hillary is a real piece of work. Selfish and arrogant.

795174789442699264 2016-11-06 08:03:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN @KilloughCNN Question: If illegals can vote in our elections, can American's vote in Mexico?
795137590449946624 2016-11-05 05:35:49 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @mike_pence @DanScavino Strange behavior from a woman who claims to be so tough. Hope it doesn't rain when she's fighting ISIS. #MAGA

794919869191852032 2016-11-05 15:10:40 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump Hillary's greatest accomplishment in life has been convincing enough ppl she's honest & competent enough to run for president.

794535395245469696 2016-11-04 13:42:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls Trump embodies everything good - and some not so good - about America. He's actually a perfect fit for the US presidency.
794508272749322240 2016-11-04 11:55:08 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper So, Jake, is he a racist? Are you a journalist, or what?

794333374114500608 2016-11-03 00:20:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DanScavino The only thing casual about Hillary Clinton is her handling of classified information.
794226471229214725 2016-11-03 17:15:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> How ironic is it that the views and welfare of illegal immigrants has a major role in American elections? Pretty nuts, right?
794226216207138817 2016-11-03 17:14:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump @alivitali Trump's overall message is actually a very positive one. Bringing some stability to the nation is a good thing.

793845863521017857 2016-11-02 16:02:57 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising Sexism works both ways. You can't use gender as an excuse for bad judgement. That's just as degrading - possibly worse.

793435524895694849 2016-11-01 12:52:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @USATODAY @JasonMillerinDC How stupid do they think the American public is? People know that the FBI investigating you means it's serious.
793434628732223488 2016-11-01 12:48:51 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JasonMillerinDC So, it's possible to win without cheating and corruption? Who'da thunk it!

793294047465046017 2016-10-31 03:30:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump FBI's actions unprecedented because Hillary is unprecedentedly crooked.

793123435215859712 2016-10-31 16:12:17 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls I think any human with a TV could form the same conclusion about the media. It's that obvious.

793082900426006529 2016-10-31 13:31:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls Her instinct is to conceal and then ridicule any suggestion that she is not being "fully transparent". Deal-breaker.
793081822263468033 2016-10-31 13:26:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls That sums it up. Pathological liar probably more accurate.

792937309444378624 2016-10-30 03:52:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @LouiseMensch Because, of course, if he was a plant, he'd just admit it to the media. Because that's how that works...
792928177148555265 2016-10-30 03:16:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @mckaycoppins Go back to Mexico.
792922387507544064 2016-10-30 02:53:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump That pretty much sums it up. If we elect HRC, we will cease to be a country deserving of respect from other nations.

792765733910392836 2016-10-30 16:30:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Now if only Hillary Clinton would admit she jeopardized national security for her own convenience, we'd be somewhere.

792764505746837509 2016-10-30 16:26:01 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @johnpodesta @jaketapper The FBI does not heed threats.
792680391672942592 2016-10-30 10:51:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper A primary role of the press is to edify the masses.

792593255883939841 2016-10-29 05:05:32 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising At what point do you just have to call bullshit on a candidate that questions the professionalism of the FBI?
792593081425993728 2016-10-29 05:04:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising In Hillary's comments she finds a lot of things about the FBI troubling and horrifying, just nothing she did.
792569523152887808 2016-10-29 03:31:14 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina @dwfictus That's pure art.
792558505538400258 2016-10-29 02:47:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina The Clinton's always did have wiener problems.
792445191705636866 2016-10-29 19:17:11 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls What right do the Clinton's have to upset at this? They got themselves into this mess, so suck it up.
792444276713992192 2016-10-29 19:13:33 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Headline should read: Clinton accuses the Federal Bureau of Investigation of conspiracy against her
792443356299218944 2016-10-29 19:09:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper That's the Clinton double-standard we all know doesn't exist *wink*wink*
792442907919736834 2016-10-29 19:08:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Keepin' it classy over in Camp Clinton!
792442231080624128 2016-10-29 19:05:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls Waiting to see voting happen before declaring it valid is "horrifying"; calling FBI liars and corrupt is what exactly?
792441737197162496 2016-10-29 19:03:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls At least it provides clear and easily digestible proof of the Clinton double-standard in action.
792441496263757824 2016-10-29 19:02:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls Assailing the judgement and motives of the FBI is just outrageous, and a real and substantial threat to our democracy.
792440710465073152 2016-10-29 18:59:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks To be fair, he didn't know what his legacy, Hillary Clinton, would be up to since since 2011.
792440346441453568 2016-10-29 18:57:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump We also used to call this approach "following the law", but that somehow got lost in the past 10 years.
792440131789594624 2016-10-29 18:57:04 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump "Criminal aliens" means illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes, not plain undocumented ones or legal immigrants.
792439382774919168 2016-10-29 18:54:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN You've been doing a lot better recently. So, maybe he didn't know it was you.
792421395963666432 2016-10-29 17:42:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN Opps... there are probably a few documents on Chinese computers too.
792420823688544256 2016-10-29 17:40:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN But then again, gravity does seem to affect her waddle... So maybe I'm wrong.
792420371483942912 2016-10-29 17:38:33 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN Ahem.. we all know the laws of physics don't apply to Clinton's. The bullets would miss. It's really a compliment.
792419580173914112 2016-10-29 17:35:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump @KilloughCNN Good to see Trump keeping the fire marshals working overtime.
792419417762123776 2016-10-29 17:34:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN That would teach her not to leave government documents on literally every computer in America...
792409506932154370 2016-10-29 16:55:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @newtgingrich Funny Putin joke. Know what isn't funny? Hillary jeopardizing national security with her "casual" approach to confidentiality.
792406538765733888 2016-10-29 16:43:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump So-called wiz at government work Hillary Clinton can't manage to shake the FBI. Doesn't bode well for claims of good judgement.
792406250159939584 2016-10-29 16:42:26 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @FoxNewsSunday I'm sure Robby will find a way to blame it all on the Russians.
792406134590087168 2016-10-29 16:41:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @FoxNewsSunday No self-respecting American should vote for a candidate with an ongoing FBI investigation. We aren't a banana republic.
792403780369207296 2016-10-29 16:32:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @scrowder @RedNationRising If a job applicant came in and ended the interview with "oh ya, the FBI is investigating me", would you hire her?
792403482691014657 2016-10-29 16:31:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @scrowder @RedNationRising If email servers run by a multi-billion $ company - Google - were hacked, anyone think HRC homemade one was safe?
792400521520828416 2016-10-29 16:19:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper If a person claims to be such a wiz at government work, how does Hillary manage to be under investigation so much and so often?
792400213084217344 2016-10-29 16:18:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising @PJStrikeForce She looks so bored testifying about her lies & ineptitude. I guess she's been under investigation so long...
792398962758000642 2016-10-29 16:13:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper How can any reasonable person say releasing a statement of fact - that new evidence is being looked at - unfair or improper?
792385160146673664 2016-10-29 15:18:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @DanScavino A lot of experts, with excellent - perfect - histories of correct predictions are saying @realDonaldTrump is going to win.
792376052492345344 2016-10-29 14:42:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @washingtonpost @ABC @TeamTrump @KellyannePolls Hillary Clinton is a ready-made scandal. Just add presidency and watch it grow.
792366419321065472 2016-10-29 14:04:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JasonMillerinDC To be frank, voting for someone as blatantly unethical as Hillary is akin to slapping Abraham Lincoln in the face.

792309860654166016 2016-10-29 10:19:25 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Playing dead with regard to illegal immigration is a slap in the face to all the legal immigrants in America.

791724338651156481 2016-10-27 19:32:46 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump There is nothing immoral about enforcing the law and managing the flow of people into our country. It's just smart and efficient.
791723885259476992 2016-10-27 19:30:58 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN I have a proposition for you: from now until the end of the campaign, tweet one positive Trump story a day. Might be fun

791722302740193281 2016-10-27 19:24:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump Thankfully, in the safety of the voting booth, their real feelings can flow from their hand to the ballot. God Bless America
791721974724562944 2016-10-27 19:23:22 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump Sadly the MSM has brainwashed many Americans into believing their Trump support would be met with condemnation or violence.

791693014414467072 2016-10-27 17:28:18 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls Hillary Clinton is a meat puppet animated by a backstage crew of writers, directors and test audiences.
791692661908398080 2016-10-27 17:26:54 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls Hillary Clinton is just an actor - not a very good one - but an actor nonetheless, working on scripts, based on focus groups
791686034643755008 2016-10-27 17:00:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN Maybe some serious reflection is in order. Remember, the work you do is public - everyone can see it and form conclusions.
791678741692817408 2016-10-27 16:31:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks What's really shocking is that they didn't just dump the server in the Hudson River.

791603849295335424 2016-10-27 11:33:59 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JasonMillerinDC My feeling is the CGI was more of a cover and promotional vehicle for Clinton Inc. that an actual charity.
791603082857553920 2016-10-27 11:30:56 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @JasonMillerinDC I think the term "crude" is apt to describe this disgusting and morally indefensible behavior the Clinton family.

791336571500793856 2016-10-26 17:51:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina Hillary simply has too much baggage and personal animism toward those who she perceives to have slighted her.

790202705864040449 2016-10-23 14:46:20 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Are claims of Russian cyber attacks a pretext for war should Hillary become president?
790202268196806656 2016-10-23 14:44:36 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @benensonj @WLTaskForce Perhaps this opens Russian communication satellites to US attack as they are now considered weapons in cyber war?

789889586868604929 2016-10-22 18:02:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @NoahGrayCNN It was pretty good speech - detailed, straightforward, practical. The headline real isn't lawsuits, if we're both being honest.
789888452581920782 2016-10-22 17:57:37 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks No doubt Clinton camp posted a 90 page document on their website promising to bring back democracy, after they steal the election
789887708168491008 2016-10-22 17:54:39 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @wikileaks For God sake, it was Hillary that specifically mentioned going at the Russians in Syria in the second debate. Where's her cover??

789885955419189248 2016-10-22 17:47:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce In many cases, I expect, journalists are fearful to write about the leaks knowing the Clinton's may seek retribution.
789885458964549632 2016-10-22 17:45:43 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce Historians will point to 2016 as the period when journalists abandoned truth and become screenwriters.

789816778608082944 2016-10-22 13:12:48 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Clinton "threatens democracy" by manipulating the media, which stabs at the heart of democracy as a concept.
789814628998000641 2016-10-22 13:04:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump Hillary interfering with the free press for political gain is the most horrifying, undemocratic thing so far in this election.
789814277326594048 2016-10-22 13:02:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce Unless you deny that @wikileaks material exist, and can back it up, you need to concede Hillary is not a fan of democracy
789813574319300608 2016-10-22 13:00:04 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @Oprah @TeamTrump How is lying and cheating her way to the presidency reflective of anything related to freedom and democracy? Read more.

789807174612504576 2016-10-22 12:34:38 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina Knowingly voting for Hillary, a proven corrupt politician and incorrigible liar, should by a mental condition. #DSM
789806322841628672 2016-10-22 12:31:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina G'morning America! Remember, while Hillary sleeps, Trump is working on a better tomorrow.
789804339632099328 2016-10-22 12:23:23 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @KellyannePolls While Hillary sleeps, Trump is working on a better tomorrow.
789803752052051968 2016-10-22 12:21:02 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump We can help #Syria in ways that don't involve flooding our country with strangers. We are smart enough to find better ways.
789802783373299712 2016-10-22 12:17:12 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina Refugees have unrealistic expectations of life in US. Give them a safe place to go near #Syria until the war is over: win-win
789801837469708289 2016-10-22 12:13:26 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump Transplanting refugees to US/EU is not a solution. Give them a safe place to go until #Syria is stable again: Temporary + humane
789801119144747014 2016-10-22 12:10:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> #refugeeswelcome Go to another Muslim country until #Syria is safe again. We'll all feel better that way :) Thanks for your cooperation.
789799997759819777 2016-10-22 12:06:07 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SarahPalinUSA Why on earth are Muslim issues so important to American elections? Many Muslim countries don't even vote for leaders.
789799002652876800 2016-10-22 12:02:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SarahPalinUSA @RedNationRising Undecided voters: A vote for Hillary is a guarantee of corruption. With Trump, at least other outcomes exist
789797646051397633 2016-10-22 11:56:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina This isn't a race issue, it's just an issue of unchecked stupidity. We used to call these people traitors btw... just saying..
789797264923332608 2016-10-22 11:55:16 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina Clinton conceded the election when she stole the nomination @wikileaks. She concedes she doesn't have what it takes to win...
789796904137666565 2016-10-22 11:53:50 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina What amazes me is how the media can find so much negative to say about someone as positive as @realDonaldTrump
789793905956954113 2016-10-22 11:41:55 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SarahPalinUSA @realDonaldTrump Thanks for standing up for America. Our adversaries are not shy about being tough, so must we.

789762359828983810 2016-10-22 09:36:34 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @WLTaskForce Is there any publicly available evidence connecting @wikileaks and Russian intelligence? If so, can you point me to it.
789752026255265793 2016-10-22 08:55:30 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump gains on Clinton, poll shows 'rigged' message resonates https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-clinton-carry-campaign-barbs-york-charity-dinner-144658341.html
789729364313112576 2016-10-22 07:25:27 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper Is an election really democratic if the campaign has been manipulated by one of the contenders? Fair to say not really.
789659663243485185 2016-10-21 02:48:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina Donald Trump's biggest problem is he speaks his mind honestly and often. Hillary has the opposite problem. I vote for truth!
789538535405608960 2016-10-21 18:47:10 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper I was going to ask if Hillary had the secret service taste her food, but they would have probably just spit in it.

789536543325114368 2016-10-21 18:39:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @jaketapper I don't think it is reasonably possible to expect any voter to ignore @wikileaks and the pattern of conduct it shows.
789533430245490688 2016-10-21 18:26:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SarahPalinUSA She's so interested in launch times b/c she plans to press the button. She thinks Syria is worth nuclear war with Russia. Nut

789525605784182784 2016-10-21 17:55:47 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina #CrookedHillary should know that you can't run a country using only canned lines and scripts. It takes honesty and hard work
789524618910453761 2016-10-21 17:51:52 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump @wikileaks just gave every intelligence agent in the world a smile that a President Hillary would surely be for sale wink wink
789523564927909888 2016-10-21 17:47:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @realDonaldTrump @TeamTrump I love seeing little kids at these events. I just hope to God Trump wins so these young kids have a real future!
789495608922910720 2016-10-21 15:56:35 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina Hillary would import the entire Syrian population to America if we let her. Still don't get Syrians are more important than us
789495046668111872 2016-10-21 15:54:21 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina Between here and Syria I'm pretty sure we can find a few safe places for Syrian refugees to stay... like, say, Saudi Arabia!
789494758200610816 2016-10-21 15:53:13 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising Hillary so interested in nuclear response time because unlike everyone before her, she intends to press the button.
789494423247695873 2016-10-21 15:51:53 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RNRNCarolina @wikileaks just gave every intelligence agency in the world proof that a President Hillary would be for sale for the right $$

788568521294905344 2016-10-18 02:32:41 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump The Clinton campaign was already hacked, so who is to say her private server wasn't also compromised? Foolish to think otherwise.
788568162711310336 2016-10-18 02:31:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @soledadobrien The US has legal routes to immigration, so why is enforcing the law such a big deal? Is stealing cars open to debate too?
788567520605310977 2016-10-18 02:28:42 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @soledadobrien With such a scripted stage-managed campaign, is there even a real Hillary to dislike since she didn't think most of her ideas

788431636794748928 2016-10-18 17:28:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump Hillary would take guns away from law-abiding Americans, but hand them out like candy to unpredictable Syrian rebels. Is she nuts
788428365069815809 2016-10-18 17:15:45 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump And her lack of self-convenience comes directly from her lack of actual accomplishments over 30 years in public service
788428111863885824 2016-10-18 17:14:44 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump The fact that Hillary is so crooked reflects directly on her lack of self-confidence. She thinks if she doesn't cheat she'll lose
788427449180708864 2016-10-18 17:12:06 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump Yet she want's us to believe she earned the privilege of a being a presidential candidate in a clean fight. Just #DrainTheSwamp
788427040240173056 2016-10-18 17:10:29 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @TeamTrump It's literally almost as if Hillary never even considered playing fairly and honestly, like a normal, decent, hard working person
788425974555619328 2016-10-18 17:06:15 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @SarahPalinUSA If Hillary ever wins this thing, you'll be our first line of defense against the Russians, once she starts a war over Syria

788390216616718336 2016-10-18 14:44:09 UTC <Legalbeagle2016> @RedNationRising A Clinton presidency would call into question the entire American justice system, not to mention our hold on law and order.
