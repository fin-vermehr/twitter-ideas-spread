969248822420373504 2018-03-01 16:31:41 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @NordFX @garama2 Does any broker offer 500x or 1,000 x margin in traditional US stock market indexes (DJIA, SP500)?

969246901441736704 2018-03-01 16:24:03 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @NordFX @garama2 Go back to my example. 19 entries for $100 position each you are wiped out. You lose $1,900! The 20th entry is BTC $5,900 for $100 position at 1,000x. BTC doubled. You are up 2,000 x. Now You have $200k. IF BTC will resume a bull trend, why sell? Keep long.  What am I missing?
969241828162551808 2018-03-01 16:03:54 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @NordFX @garama2 I should read the agreement and the fine print. I wonder if there is a statistics of the % of successful traders in 1000 x positions. 0.1% sounds about right. LOL 
969240927595249669 2018-03-01 16:00:19 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @historylvrsclub I can spend a whole life there reading and reading. Do they play classical music in the library or just total silence? 
969240036951474176 2018-03-01 15:56:47 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @PaulThailand Well, it was a play on number 8. But clif predicted $600 silver multiple times in the past to occur in 2017  (maybe sooner) Ouch. Silver at $600 is the end of the world Financial System as we know it. Chaos. Unrest. Collapse of nations. Hyperinflation. Wars. @GabrielDVine
969237743690592256 2018-03-01 15:47:40 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @NordFX @garama2 Well, for example. If one went long at $6,100 BTC, he got wiped out. Then he went long at$6,000 and he is toast. But your third entry is long 0.001 BTC at $5,900! BTC never looked back. Whats the risk for the last position? You should have approximately 10 BTC, no?
969190871349436416 2018-03-01 12:41:25 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @RoadtoRoota So no $13,888 BTC in February per clifs prediction. I hope he predicts it again in March. If not, April... @LV_DouDou_Bear

Albeit, its not Armenias doing, Yerevan has not capitalized on it in foreign affairs or militarily. BTW, Armenia should invite Turkish pilots to escape with their planes to Armenia.

961737442347778048 2018-02-08 23:04:09 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @joshuakucera 1/. The context of the speech suggests that Ilham Aliyev meant occupying Yerevan. He says its a strategic goal. An Azeri who is 70 yrs old and returns to Yerevan is a refugee or humanitarian issue, not a military (strategic) issue. His speech is dangerous as it flares public

956712416921833472 2018-01-25 02:16:29 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @EHSANI22 #8 is factually wrong. Damascus is ABLE to repulse genocidal turko-Islamic-fascists by simply shooting turkish jets (S300 anyone?) The coward turks are afraid to fly low b/c of MANPADs. No need to deploy ground troops. But Damascus punishes treacherous Kurds with fascist turks.
956709605077278720 2018-01-25 02:05:19 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @EHSANI22 2/ their customary rape, pillage and genocide (nothing new here).  So the Russians actually ENCOURAGED the douchbag wanna be  sultan Erdo The Uneducated Thief to murder the innocent civilians. Its Realpolitik. Nothing personal.

956707774796152832 2018-01-25 01:58:02 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @EHSANI22 1/ # 17 is factually wrong. 1) RF invited the Islamo-fascist Turks: the generals did not show up unannounced; 2) RF gave the islamo-fascists GREEN light in exchange for the 2nd pipeline thru turkey; 3) the turks approved the 2nd pipeline on January 19 and only after it started

Turkey sold out the Islamofasicist groups in Idlib, letting Assad move in. Overall, RF doesnt want the US presence in Syria via Kurds.  Ideally both sides will bleed.

955148841078079488 2018-01-21 18:43:24 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Pyrmha108 Well said. Also Putin and his buddies got the second gas pipeline thru Turkey b/c if Afrin bargain.

955086161164124161 2018-01-21 14:34:20 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> No need to divide Syria b/c its already divided.  US wants a presence to counter Russia and Iran. The Kurds are its natural allies or proxies. RF and Iran wish to permanently displace the US and allowed genocidal turkey to punish the Kurds. Plus RF got the 2nd gas line.

954969003155324928 2018-01-20 06:48:47 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @juni0rCyaxares @ejmalrai Maybe the Kurds want independence OR  real autonomy; and Russia said nyet Turkey offered a second gas pipeline to Russia and In return Russia betrayed Kurds and let the treacherous turks pillage and destroy.

953202006755237888 2018-01-16 09:47:22 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @rogerkver Good to see you again , Roger. Is everything alright?  Was kinda worried seeing you stopped the crusade against ... well, the bitcoin.  Stay close to fake satoshi and nutty mcafee, bro.
953200561297371136 2018-01-16 09:41:38 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Silver_Watchdog Gotta give it some time. A little FUD. Plus China this and China that. Some theatrics by Roger ver.  And lastly the Fed trading desk is back on Tuesday.
953199558636351488 2018-01-16 09:37:39 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @allstarcharts The bottom picture shows a cup without handle. The top is mostly fractals and descending triangles. In other words, bon appetite! 
953195339476955137 2018-01-16 09:20:53 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @fluffypony It. Does. Not. Matter. You will still be blamed (as the CEO of Monero) for the irresponsibility of others.  Plus fake CNBC always loves the the money of the criminals nonsense. Sad 
953193362193924096 2018-01-16 09:13:01 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @JamesGRickards What you are saying is that gold is MISBEHAVING again. Wait till the boys at the Fed trading desk return from the holiday vacation. A little smack down is all we need, eh?

As far as the US, good old inflation is solution #1. #2 is official, large scale devaluation.  #3 is outright default (the politicians least favorite, least likely, most bloody).  If #2, then is it iagainst a. gold, b.SDR
953088510256279552 2018-01-15 02:16:23 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Smaulgld @Silver_Watchdog @LukeGromen 1/ Whats the total sum of the IOUs/entitlements EU/Japan/China promised/owe to their electorate/populace? The total Entitlements is probably closer to 200T USD (including state/municipal pensions, health care, etc)? So the Q Falls first?
953055600727879680 2018-01-15 00:05:36 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Smaulgld @Silver_Watchdog @LukeGromen Haha... let me check if I have enough.  But, my point is, if you have $500 Bl (Euro, USD, etc.) where do you park? Surely you can't and won't park with ChiComs via yuan. Am I wrong?

953029092713967616 2018-01-15 22:20:16 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @ggreenwald Putin the genius.  Now we can depict sen. Cardin as both anti-man and anti-woman candidate. He will surely lose if neither men nor women vote for him. Sad. What can honest Democrats do now?

952987089502523392 2018-01-15 19:33:22 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @zerohedge How dare Gold misbehave? Its price is rising. Along with its battered twin silver. Oh yes, I forgot... the Fed trading desk is on vacation. LOL   a little snack down will put things in order! 
952981860384043008 2018-01-15 19:12:35 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @ttmygh Grant, forget bitcoin: whats the story with silver? That battered monetary metal has been MISBEHAVING lately. The price is rising without permission. Almost Scandalous. Are we seeing $1,000 silver? In 2018? 2099? Thanks.

952769865554653185 2018-01-14 05:10:12 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @bisq_network @TraceMayer 2/ and no liquidity.  Pathetic since bisq lacks basic economics. They must ELIMINATE the fees for market makers to cancel or modify the market orders. Sad. 
952769337676345344 2018-01-14 05:08:06 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @bisq_network @TraceMayer 1/ Bisq does not understands economics 101.  They PUNISH the market makers for modifying or cancelling the buy or sell offers.  On the contrary, its competitor encourages market makers to place buy or sell offers without PENALTY.  As a result, Bisq has 1-2 market makers
952766824696791040 2018-01-14 04:58:07 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @bisq_network @flix1 Localbitcoins does not PUNISH market makers for modifying or canceling the offers like bisq does. As a result, 100s of market makers on localbitcoins and 1-2 on bisq. Eliminate the punitive fees.
952764059610333185 2018-01-14 04:47:07 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @bisq_network @flix1 @skywalker23452 Nope. The programmers dont understand markets. They punish market makers for modifying or canceling the offers (to buy or sell). No wonder there are only few offers. No offers, no volume. Basic Econ 101.
952763450924482560 2018-01-14 04:44:42 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @bisq_network @flix1 Bad idea. Bisq punishes the market makers. Once you create an offer (to buy or sell), you get charged to cancel or modify.  Instead of encouraging more offers to buy/sell, they discourage. Awful policy.
952678327906574336 2018-01-14 23:06:27 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @zerohedge Why is this beautiful woman with mustache (al walid Shalid falid) refusing to fork off some of the money he stole and forcing his cousin & future king to rape him?  Regardless, a typical mooooslim drama. Inshallah
952676655947902976 2018-01-14 22:59:49 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @zerohedge Why the FUD? All is well. The Fed is always alert and will buy this sh*t... then resell to us - the taxpayers.

952535101069381632 2018-01-14 13:37:19 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @bisq_network The penalty for market makers cancellation is EXCESSIVE. Just reduce it dramatically or eliminate.  You should encourage market makers to make offers (buy or sell), instead of punishing them. Let there be multiple offers.

952385310419075073 2018-01-13 03:42:07 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Super_Crypto Are gold and silver prices manipulated? Yes.  Are the banks afraid of bitcoin? Yes. But claiming most top and bottom without quantative evidence is stretching the truth. Mortgaging a house is anecdotal at best.

952112710992347137 2018-01-13 09:38:54 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @russian_market I have been warning about it and also suggested a legal defense fund for young ChiCom Jihad Wu in case he refuses to obey the party bosses, refuses to hand over the little savings he has from minute BTC operations and gets castrated.
952111747367759872 2018-01-13 09:35:04 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @russian_market Funny. They somehow  alculaged the BTC addresses but could not find if its owned by an individual or an exchange. Lol the level of incompetence is striking but not unexpected

952007640393039872 2018-01-12 02:41:23 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Smaulgld If so, Italy, france, USA should follow the UK example and sell all their gold. But they dont. Why? Bernanke answered to Rep. Ron  Pauls Q saying the US Treasury didnt sell its gold because of tradition (silly argument)
952004701985189888 2018-01-12 02:29:43 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Silver_Watchdog Is there an upcoming SNB ICO?
952004315559870464 2018-01-12 02:28:10 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Smaulgld How long will the dollar be the world reserve currency? 5 yrs? 25 yrs?  50 yrs? If there is a major currency devaluation, doesnt good play a role in the CB balance sheet?
952002328193728519 2018-01-12 02:20:17 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Smaulgld I see. But still, the central bank reduced its holdings. Wouldnt the gold holdings play a big role at the next monetary reset or currency devaluations?
951971592912818177 2018-01-12 00:18:09 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Smaulgld Wise decision. But the pace is kinda slow. Sell then all - its a tradition per Bernanke and buy paper IOUs!  Preferably at negative rates.

951619450574290944 2018-01-11 00:58:51 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @USC @ArmenianStudies @emil_sanamyan @MaximEdwards 2/ the dissident movement (Hayrikyan being a major figure) was small but inclusive & international. They challenged Moscow arguing that unless the Communist regime is destroyed, neither issue would be properly solved.
951618634488492033 2018-01-11 00:55:37 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @USC @ArmenianStudies @emil_sanamyan @MaximEdwards 1/ Armenians did not refer to the Cimean Tatars. The latter was repatriation, the former - reunification.  Karabakh movement, in part coopted by the KGB, in part thru naivite, in part because of fear, did not challenge the Communist regime.
951617203320774656 2018-01-11 00:49:56 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @USC @ArmenianStudies @emil_sanamyan 2/ albeit it was mostly spontaneous. But KGB knew about it ahead of time.  VOA and BBC covered it.  Yet Most people erroneously think Karabakh movement started in 1998.
951616584337862657 2018-01-11 00:47:28 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @USC @ArmenianStudies @emil_sanamyan 1/ I stand corrected.  But the October 1987 protest was the first in Karabakh movement. May have related to the removal of the Armenian State Farm manager in the village Chardakhlu.  Paruyr Hayrikyan was not in Armenia yet, but his (old outlawed) party organized the event.

951610449690275840 2018-01-11 00:23:05 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> In crypto language it means the HODLer forgot his private keys. See bitcoin IS gold. @MarkYusko @Smaulgld @jimmysong @ToneVays @RichardHeartWin @stacyherberthttps://twitter.com/Smaulgld/status/951521419594207232
951607123120594944 2018-01-11 00:09:52 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Silver_Watchdog I propose to rename silver as silverblockchain!  List as SLVBK.  It will trade $100k overnight. Otherwise,  the bullion banks and the Fed will continue manipulating the price.

He defeated the Red Army in February 1921. That deformed bastard, petty thief & human monster dzhugashvili never forgave Nzhdeh for that.

951386106863394816 2018-01-11 09:31:38 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @USC @ArmenianStudies @emil_sanamyan The first protest was in Yerevan in front of then parliament Supreme Soviet, near the subway station, in October 1987!  Before the Crimean Tatars.   Before the ecological protests. KGB in civilian clothes (and some police) dispersed the small crowd.

949777036914057217 2018-01-06 22:57:46 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> Look, gold mining ALSO uses electricity!   I suggest we ban both gold and BTC.  Just to be fair...
949756613530808320 2018-01-06 21:36:36 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Tether_is_Fiat I understand.  Completely.  You can do it.

949687428737941504 2018-01-06 17:01:42 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Smaulgld Now, if they admit to manipulating gold prices just like they do to the Dow Jones... that would be a REAL game changer.

949570310034022400 2018-01-06 09:16:18 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Silver_Watchdog Does it mean the islands will soon be liberated?  This dangerous gold as legal tender, gold as money is not helping the CB narrative, eh? @Smaulgld
949569528861663232 2018-01-06 09:13:12 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Silver_Watchdog I have been saying for a long time that we must support young ChiCom miner extraordinaire and antibitcoin provacateur Jihad Wu! If he does not hard FORK a few hundred million USD to the Chinese beloved leader, he WILL BR castrated... @ToneVays @theonevortex @RichardHeartWin
949563254254141440 2018-01-06 08:48:16 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @gold5K Times have changed. Our former servants are now our masters.

949175940013211648 2018-01-04 07:09:13 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @CoreyLMJones @TroyPittman1 @AnonymousKBW Darn, imagine how good the libtards would feel if honorable Barack Hussein Obama knelt during a game.  Like a good brotha.  But, hey, its not late...
949175057967820802 2018-01-04 07:05:43 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @CoreyLMJones Naah... kneeling is better bc its a cheap shot.  Why would a semiliterate, obnoxious football player do something useful (volunteer, donate 5% of his income to the needy, fight against our-of-wedlock birth epidemic destroying black families). Kneeling gets results - publicity!
949052076000030721 2018-01-04 22:57:02 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @gloom_lady Happy New Year. With your gorgeous looks, with a beautiful scene in the background and with bitcoin, you cant possibly be gloomy.

948706881672892416 2018-01-03 00:05:21 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Silver_Watchdog Any news about the legality of silver or gold trading from our beloved Hindu minister? Asking for a friend. @Smaulgld
948621866880548864 2018-01-03 18:27:32 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @TheBubbleBubble 1.  Does that assume that BTC is correlated to the stock/bondreal estate markets?
948614899696992256 2018-01-03 17:59:51 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Smaulgld Is China just planning or is it expected by the analysts?
948605798199959552 2018-01-03 17:23:41 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Silver_Watchdog Maybe it means lower transaction fees?

948524012212166657 2018-01-03 11:58:41 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Silver_Watchdog Why not sell the futures short and dump the BTC in the spot market? Isnt this your suggestion?
948522628691578880 2018-01-03 11:53:12 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @Silver_Watchdog Whats the reasoning behind the dip before a rally? Any such precedents?

948233131454210049 2018-01-02 16:42:50 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @hitbtc why is it impossible to deposit BTC into the account? It gives an error message and does not generate an address.

947759525607522305 2018-01-01 09:20:54 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @GabrielDVine Gabriel, 1. Does the 2018 report include the crypto predictions or just general economy and the stock market? 2.

I believe even during 2007 real estate crash, farmland kept its prices high or dropped slightly compared to residential/ commercial real estate? 3) most of the crypto stocks were penny stocks. Arent they risky?

940425672387727360 2017-12-11 03:38:47 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @AlenaSatoshi @im_uname (1) Monero and even Dash are anonymous. Do you think they are better assets? (2) BTC developers are working to make it anonymous. Are you saying its impossible due to BTCs structure? (3) are you a developer / programmer?

940423624955006977 2017-12-11 03:30:39 UTC <LV_DouDou_Bear> @AlenaSatoshi @im_uname How is BTC (a) not censorship resistant, (b) not fungible?

Otherwise if you just want to make money (USD) by betting(On horses, sports, stock indexes, commodities) you trade in CASH settled futures?
