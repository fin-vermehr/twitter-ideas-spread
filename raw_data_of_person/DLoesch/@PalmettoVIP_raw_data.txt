962707211167387648 2018-02-11 15:17:40 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean @5858Jack Glucosamine helped speed my recovery after a knee injury.  Its awesome for certain injuries... especially ligaments.  Be aware that some people with shellfish allergies have really bad reactions to it.. think the chondroitin is the thing people react to?
962706270913523712 2018-02-11 15:13:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean Any better today?  If not, get to the doctor!!  If it is better, try an epsom bath soak, rest, compression wrap, and ibuprofen.  Be careful not to overdo it for awhile. When pain is gone, light stretching only for at least a full week.  Us martial artists are prone to injury!

This too, was feedback since the launch of D1.  
958540362662006785 2018-01-30 03:20:05 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyTheGame @DeeJ_BNG @LordShyttish @mattybyrne89 @Tommysturn @necrosslich Random rolls is the other elephant in the room that BUNGIE should really address yes.  Even if the answer is we cant fix this until D3 because it is too imbedded in D2 coding.  I would rather know.  Ignoring the question feels like not listening.

The goodies are usually time- locked anyway.. example couldnt get your pre-order cold stream and sword until AFTER the campaign and lev 20.  Yeah.. at that point I had better stuff anyways.  #poorExecution #knowYourTargetAudience

That starts an ugly twitter war, and as I wrote a few times, plenty of blame to go around.  I myself posted a lot about the need for easier matchmaking... maybe BUNGIE thought quickplay rotation was the solution?  (Its not)
958114872646094849 2018-01-29 23:09:21 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyTheGame @DeeJ_BNG @mattybyrne89 @LordShyttish @ayyMidnight Not everyone.  I liked stickies.  And so did most of the people i know.  And a certain streamer led the charge against throwing knives.  Not gonna point a specific finger.  We ALL are to blame for the current situation.

Decisions such as 4v4, neutered grenades and abilities were in direct response to certain popular streamers who begged for nerfs to stickies, nerfs to throwing knives etc..  Plenty of blame to go around.  But content/planet/activity removal?
958065029991010307 2018-01-29 19:51:17 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG Appreciate the transparency and that you all havent given up on us.  Can we get some dialogue on the status of players ability to choose quickplay game mode in this weeks TWAB pls?  This could get a lot of players to come back and would reduce the dropouts

957596014789255168 2018-01-28 12:47:35 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @A_dmg04 @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG @cgbarrett @DestinyReddit @iam_trapped_ @evil_trotter The lack of weapon variety Is definitely part of the problem. But game mode choice needs to be address by the team too. Even if the answer is no, not gonna happen, maybe in D3. Knowing is better than being ignored, which is currently how BUNGIE is handling the question.
957403081129496576 2018-01-27 00:00:56 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @A_dmg04 @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG @cgbarrett @DestinyReddit @evil_trotter More people would return to crucible if they could CHOOSE their quickplay mode. You would also have less people dropping out of matches (like Supremacy) that they DONT want to play. Bottom line? No PVP game worth playing forces you to play modes you dont like.. except #Destiny2
957323647005446149 2018-01-27 18:45:18 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyReddit @cgbarrett @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 @A_dmg04  we REALLY need some dialogue about players being about when/if players will be able to choose their quickplay pvp mode.

Next TWAB, can you PLEASE address the requests by players to choose their quickplay mode?  Somehow this isnt getting heard despite being one of the most frequently requested features since launch day.
956508781894094859 2018-01-25 12:47:19 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @A_dmg04 @cgbarrett Can we have a conversation about the ability to CHOOSE which quickplay Crucible mode we want to play?  This has been one of the biggest complaints since D2 launch and it keeps getting ignored.

954453144704094208 2018-01-19 20:38:57 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PopeBear @sharkeatsman @Josh_Hamrick this sounds promising, but its hard to trust when the sandbox team makes sticky grenades less powerful than a melee and reduces shoulder charge to a tickle fight.  For years the community has asked you guys to separate PVP and PVE.  PLEASE LISTEN!
954450872737697793 2018-01-19 20:29:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 @A_dmg04 @Bungie @Be11eBunny @ThatVanguard 2/2. And keeping that mix balanced would be a challenge.. i think the casual player on that commitee would eventually lean to hardcore by nature of being more involved.  But.. as I said above.. its worth a try.  The current system for communicating is failing horribly.  
954450286147457025 2018-01-19 20:27:35 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 @A_dmg04 @Bungie @Be11eBunny @ThatVanguard My fear on this would be that it would cater too much to a sub-group.  Example:  too many Trials MLG streamers on that commitee would skew it against the casual player (which is at least 50% of the player base)..Too many casuals will skew it against the more hardcore player.  1/2

954403088638586880 2018-01-19 17:20:02 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny Another problem for @Bungie is that they prioritize all wrong.  Nobody cared if some people wanted to exploit a lost sector..there was a 30engram cap anyways and it was only a PVE problem.  But tons of employee resources were put to work on THAT instead of say..making strikes fun
954402394812698625 2018-01-19 17:17:17 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @Be11eBunny @ThatVanguard But isnt that what @A_dmg04 @Cozmo23 and @DeeJ_BNG  are for?
954401441782870016 2018-01-19 17:13:30 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny The whole PR disaster of the past 60 days has been painful to watch. I feel sad for the game I love, and then MAD that @Bungie ignores some of the most commonly requested things.. like ability to CHOOSE my quickplay game mode!!  How in the heck did that get left out?!?

953405600037326848 2018-01-16 23:16:23 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @A_dmg04 Why are you guys always so extreme with the cool downs?? For crying out lout, a 4m cooldown would have solved the problem.  Better question;  why even care if some of your players want to play the game different that you imagined?
953404968710615040 2018-01-16 23:13:52 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyNews_net It was a boring exploit, but really?  Why care if your player base wants to play your game differently than you intended?  This is a good example of why so many people are leaving.  Smh @Bungie

952621379698024448 2018-01-14 19:20:10 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PopeBear Its a good start.  Players really need to be able to choose their PVP mode too though. Its crazy to expect your players to play 20ms of game modes just to get to the mode they like.  And I dont think we should backout of say..Supremacy.. but lack of choice is what causes it!

Over the short term it may lose price/oz, over 20 years should retain same overall value.
952243260616998912 2018-01-13 18:17:39 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MarketWatch Absolutely agree.  If you are riding this train, stay alert and be ready to make quick moves

951152359505367040 2018-01-10 18:02:48 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @cgbarrett @Cozmo23 @A_dmg04 Will Crimson Doubles have matchmaking this time?  There was overwhelming feedback requesting this after the last Crimson Days.

944952052307910657 2017-12-24 15:25:00 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Kotaku The biggest problems with the VR games are they are full price but not full length.  The technology is awesome and the games are a blast... just way too short.

It really stinks that it is ruined by a game breaking Infinite Nova B glitch.  #Destiny2 #TheDawning #Disappoitment I think #Bungie should make Mayhem permanent after the fix/patch though!

943493326870925312 2017-12-20 14:48:33 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EA_DICE @EAStarWars @EAHelp @Disney Did some more testing.  Its possible this bug gives you DOUBLE crafting parts then subtracts half.  This is very confusing to players and really should get patched.  Appears to steal your crafting parts but might not be so.
943491102488911874 2017-12-20 14:39:42 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Disney @EAHelp @EAStarWars @EA_DICE got video of the disappearing crafting parts bug for you.  #Battlefront2   Please fix?https://twitter.com/palmettovip/status/943490337158369280

943472773736943617 2017-12-20 13:26:52 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Disney @EAStarWars @EA_DICE there seems to be a disappearing crafting parts bug in #Battlefront2 that takes away your crafting parts.  (Sometimes) occurs when opening multiple loot boxes.  How long on the fix and can players get refunded crafting parts pls?  @EAHelp
943455987113058305 2017-12-20 12:20:10 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DattosDestiny I loved it last night.  Played crucible for three hours for the first time in months.

942937353320005632 2017-12-18 01:59:18 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EAStarWars Anyone else experiencing the disappearing craft parts bug while opening crates?  Watch your craft parts total when opening crates!
942773673030750209 2017-12-18 15:08:54 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EAStarWars @EA_DICE @Disney  noticed a bug that needs a little investigating please.  When opening crates, your crafting parts will sometimes disappear before you spend them.  Been able to replicate this bug 5 times now.  PM me if you need more details.

941408524172775432 2017-12-14 20:44:17 UTC <PalmettoVIP> Gamer friends; i gotta give some props to #Battlefront2 by @EA_DICE and @EAStarWars !  This game is fun!!! It has overcome the rough launch and reviews and the devs have committed to listening to fan feedback.  Buy it now and take advantage of the free DLC !
941392342736687107 2017-12-14 19:39:59 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EAStarWars @EA_DICE @Disney really enjoying the free #Battlefront2 DLC.  Ty !  Great story and voice acting @Janina !

939669102074920960 2017-12-09 01:32:26 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot The games need to be longer than 5 hours each for it to survive.  But yes, the technology is a lot of fun.

936033497294270464 2017-11-29 00:45:51 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @GuardiansofD Good start.  But some of the biggest requests have yet to be addressed:  6v6, rumble, mayhem, and player choice for PVP mode.  Would like to see a commitment to adding those back in for 2018.

But we also need a commitment to some of the biggest fan requests: choice of PVP mode, return of Rumble, 6v6 and Mayhem. Not just for private matches pls.  Ty

935709460735152128 2017-11-28 03:18:14 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PlowmanEric @DeeJ_BNG I think this question does deserve an answer.  Lets focus on the last two months though.  The fan base has been trying to tell Bungie that something was wrong and we got silence or interviews where the dev says no its better now.  Its not.
935708829911846912 2017-11-28 03:15:44 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PlowmanEric @DeeJ_BNG Hope so.  A lot of us have stuck around and been VERY vocal because we still play and think that this ship can be righted.  Regular 2 way communication would be a good place to start.

934879256836038658 2017-11-26 20:19:18 UTC <PalmettoVIP> I wonder if that cow is named Fabio?
934598593914253312 2017-11-25 01:44:03 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ChristieGolden @Janina loved #InfernoSquad on audible.  Hope we get a sequel set AFTER the battle of Jakku please!!  (Retweet?)
934579550419341317 2017-11-25 00:28:23 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @thislukesmith We dont know if the community managers were under gag orders.  THAT might be part of the problem
934579187653992448 2017-11-25 00:26:56 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @thislukesmith @DestinyRokks What do you think is needed to mend the bridges?  More frequent two way communication between devs and fan base?
934578855137988608 2017-11-25 00:25:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @thislukesmith @jeffh714 This is a big one.  And Caydes chests need a buff.  Like a HUGE buff.  Or if not, then substantially lower the glimmer cost and eliminate whatever loot cooldown issue causes empty chests
934578268384190464 2017-11-25 00:23:17 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @thislukesmith @stephendavid23 Great ideas!  And bring back Rumble, and 6v6 pls
934573373631410176 2017-11-25 00:03:50 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyReddit Very glad to see some communication happening!  That alone is a good start!  @Bungie @DestinyTheGame
934572179399823363 2017-11-25 23:59:05 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie Not entitled to a reply.  But not to long ago it was more common for AAA devs to have regular 2 way communications with their fanbase.  Maybe it is a dying thing.  
934571704109666305 2017-11-25 23:57:12 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @marknoseworthy_ @thislukesmith @Bungie Yeah.  Im hoping it doesnt come to that my friend.  Destiny means a lot to me too.  :/
934568480132739072 2017-11-25 23:44:23 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie I understand.  I think we would still see some of that, but much less if there was more frequent two way communication.  Maybe next week is the week when we finally turn the corner and get this ship moving back in the right direction.
934568058991140866 2017-11-25 23:42:43 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @thislukesmith @shit_its_tim @SynthetikSoul27 @kurutoBM Not just him.  Many players feel this way.
934567763946983427 2017-11-25 23:41:33 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @thislukesmith @SynthetikSoul27 @kurutoBM No.  Y1 exotics felt very special.  Most (not all) exotics now just feel like good legendaries.
934567365915881472 2017-11-25 23:39:58 UTC <PalmettoVIP> Really glad to read this.  We are hanging in there hoping for some communication on the feedback, criticism and needed fixes.  Thank you @thislukesmith and @marknoseworthy_
934566814490689538 2017-11-25 23:37:46 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie 2/2  but... maybe we are turning a corner?  @thislukesmith and @marknoseworthy_  are going to address fan concerns next week!  That restores some hope for me.  Want to see this franchise succeed.
934566447518552064 2017-11-25 23:36:19 UTC <PalmettoVIP> Hi Betty.  I understand the frustration with us complainers, but also think that if we didnt complain, nothing would get fixed.  Polite feedback seems to get ignored these days.  Lack of communication by @Bungie has caused the fans to get louder and louder.  1/2

930861770918580224 2017-11-15 18:15:15 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MoreConsole I really hope this DLC improves the RNG to reduce dupes.  I dont even get excited when an exotic engram drops.  I am still missing 2-3 but I know the stupid RNG is never going to give them to me.  @Cozmo23 @cgbarrett

926393480498294784 2017-11-03 10:19:51 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gameinformer The biggest problem with @PlayStation @PlayStation4VR is that devs want you to pay full price for games that have 4-6 hours of content.

918235862512611329 2017-10-11 22:04:24 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @lars_bakken @kungfusquirrel @LenzAustin I guess.  Some clarification would be cool.  So what about charlemagne not being a warmind anymore?  Whats the explanation for that?

917760360479973376 2017-10-10 14:34:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 can you ask the writers to clarify why D1 story is being re-written? Ie; charlemagne is no longer a warmind? 1 iron lord?

917746075171213314 2017-10-10 13:38:09 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf Why are you surprised?  The existence of other warminds such as Charlemagne was also written out of the story?

913139236605489152 2017-09-27 20:32:13 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf @Gothalion @WillieMarvel Yeah... this is a legit issue.  The 'smarter' RNG is not so smart @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 @Bungie
913138837676838914 2017-09-27 20:30:38 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf @Gothalion @Doomhammer7t Yes.  Exactly.  You can get 90 engrams in 1 week event.  Not sure how this would ever be considered stingy.  
913138437871595521 2017-09-27 20:29:03 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf @Gothalion @sammyt210 Yeah but the same event/loot table is going to be run three more times between now and next sept.  We were supposed to get it all now. Doh!
913137960056496130 2017-09-27 20:27:09 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf @Gothalion @Wildside2060 LOL not sure the quick farming was what they intended.. this event was supposed to last 4 cycles.  If we get all gear now...
913137291757080576 2017-09-27 20:24:30 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf I don't know... 90 engrams (30 per character) for a 1 week event seems pretty generous...

910634954253578246 2017-09-20 22:41:06 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieHelp @DestinyNews_net I think if it was a bug we would get 'we are aware of issues with empty chests and working on a solution.'  Likely intentional, and not cool
910607776166088704 2017-09-20 20:53:06 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PopeBear Pope, I'm not feeling those strike rewards raining down like manna from heaven! And not feeling it when I open an empty Loot chest

910526529079214080 2017-09-20 15:30:15 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @SWTweets @MesaSean brother can you do a video explaining the loot lockout timer (empty chests) and estimate of how long we have to stand and wait?

910519653201571840 2017-09-20 15:02:56 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 @Bungie Yeah, then at least my little Titan won't feel ripped off when he opens a (POOF) empty Cayde's Stash chest.  This will drive people away. 
910508119704444928 2017-09-20 14:17:06 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DattosDestiny @HeyFitzy anyone tested & know the exact timer for the loot lockout timer in #Destiny2 ? Shoot & loot games w/ empty chests??
910507236157517824 2017-09-20 14:13:36 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG please discontinue the loot lockout timer.  It is making a lot of frustration (see forums for details pls)
910488750903480321 2017-09-20 13:00:08 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG  Strike rewards and memories need a buff.  Maybe guaranteed powerful engram. Currently no replayability on either

907776608114802688 2017-09-12 01:23:03 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieHelp are empty chests supposed to happen?  Like is it the ultimate in bad RNG?

907680208437874689 2017-09-12 19:00:00 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @gamespot @ssj5gotenks2099 Sorry, i'm not sure.  Guessing they will alter not remove (i know i said 'remove' above, not how i meant it)
907678724732194817 2017-09-12 18:54:06 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @gamespot @ssj5gotenks2099 That's probably what they will do TeEm.
907678548617580544 2017-09-12 18:53:24 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BulletValentina I almost never do this, but I think the judges scored that one wrong.  I was scoring it and from my perspective (and many others), you won.
907676217293381634 2017-09-12 18:44:08 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot @ssj5gotenks2099 I'm not @Bungie, but I'm guessing they don't want to even be accidentally associated with it. I support that.
907674947316846592 2017-09-12 18:39:05 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot @ssj5gotenks2099 There are some gauntlets that look vaguely similar to a hate group's flag (kek). Most people never heard of them. Probably best to remove it
907673802720641024 2017-09-12 18:34:32 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @CaptnDeevious @JoshuaTomahawk @MrPrestigeMode @BobbyBigCat Bet they keep color (it *is* a cool shade of green) and just remove the Kek. I wouldnt worry about it.
907671382678536192 2017-09-12 18:24:56 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HuffPostPhoto It's not mine, it's been floating around social media sorry
907671113257320448 2017-09-12 18:23:51 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MTashed Thanks for the tip.  Here I was maining my Titan.  Time to level up my Warlock.

907665548586209280 2017-09-12 18:01:45 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @CaptnDeevious @JoshuaTomahawk @MrPrestigeMode Probably same stats but replaced with generic design from similar gauntlet
907665191890034689 2017-09-12 18:00:20 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @NRG_Motions @Panther826 Considering that most people never heard of this Kek group or would know what their flag looks like.. I am guessing this was a bad accident
907663519935549441 2017-09-12 17:53:41 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @CaptnDeevious @JoshuaTomahawk @MrPrestigeMode Never heard of this Kek group.  The glove doesnt really look like that flag to me, but I can see how some might think that.Good call Bungie

894185612911181826 2017-08-06 13:17:17 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @AlexaGrasso @ufc @dterrones90 @mma_chuck Conversely, the takedowns didnt seem to do any damage.  Even the ground and pound didnt seem to faze Alexa.
894185348082913280 2017-08-06 13:16:14 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @AlexaGrasso @ufc @dterrones90 @mma_chuck No, i judged the winner by who landed more effective strikes.  Those strikes did damage, hence the huffing and puffing.

887611526877720578 2017-07-19 09:54:13 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK The PVE stuff looks great. PVP?  Prefer sixes and rumble.Powers feel too weak, charge slow. All guns feel same in PVP, nothing feels special
887610962630627329 2017-07-19 09:51:59 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyDaily7 @serendipity127_ The radar is complete trash, powers feel weak and slow charging, all guns feel the same.  The PVE was great though.
887610043864109056 2017-07-19 09:48:20 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyDaily7 The PVE is GREAT!!  Not liking the PVP. Heavy feels weak, too many powers feel nerfed, guns all feel the same, the new radar is garbage.
887475560343097345 2017-07-18 00:53:56 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @DestinyTheGame @Cozmo23 Homecoming mission is AWESOME.  Dont care for the 4v4 PVP though.  Pls bring back sixes at some point

885544622939918336 2017-07-13 17:01:05 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DattosDestiny I think the solution to make Shoulder charge kill will be either shoot a volley to weaken then shoulder charge or shoulder charge then shoot

862264025496813573 2017-05-10 11:12:18 UTC <PalmettoVIP> Iron Banner Mayhem was a little hard to get used to.  Weapons seem insignificant to Powers. All the flashing makes targeting hard too.

847500303419289600 2017-03-30 17:26:32 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Polygon trailer was awesome, but I really hope The Speaker dies in that initial Cabal attack

847411774764630017 2017-03-30 11:34:45 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @SoloAssassin45 well, I actually think they base the changes off a few select people who whine about a particular weapon or ability.
847236491700981760 2017-03-29 23:58:15 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot yep.  They would gain a lot more players
847236043375910913 2017-03-29 23:56:28 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @SoloAssassin45 i still play a little, looking forward to D2, but the constant 'rebalancing' by the sandbox team to cater to whiners is bad

845677685925986306 2017-03-25 16:44:06 UTC <PalmettoVIP> This.  Nailed it.  In fact, sometimes multiplayer community ruins what would have been a great game with constant requests for nerfs.pic.twitter.com/gxBcTXeMKR

837359989857583104 2017-03-02 17:52:33 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot bwahahah this game is awesome.  Likely Contender for GOTY
837359753835786240 2017-03-02 17:51:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot @JesseChurch2 the lip synching is one of the few issues that brings this game down..otherwise has been amazing, beautiful, &stable
837359327321149440 2017-03-02 17:49:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot havent heard this in any of the chats/forums/groups.  Probably very rare...  not worth a headline story

831811881744621568 2017-02-15 10:26:21 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 Pls undo the hunger blade nerf/bug.  It was fine for 3 years but suddenly is 'unbalanced?'  Who complained?  #Activision #Bungie

831666170822553601 2017-02-14 00:47:21 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Gothalion @Ruthven_N let's go with none then.  Was fine for 3 years, suddenly a few people complain on stream and it is 'unbalanced'

831655854663401472 2017-02-14 00:06:21 UTC <PalmettoVIP> it's not.  And they should have left all of it alone.  Was fine for 3 yrs, all of a sudden it is a balance problem?

830424556141735937 2017-02-11 14:33:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyReddit sounds like one of his insiders didn't quite understand what the consequences were of late release
830015147527782401 2017-02-10 11:26:46 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @TheEconomist @znakit this is true.  There is subjectivity, even in law.
830014849505701888 2017-02-10 11:25:35 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @TheEconomist sure, it's only us tax paying serfs that have to pay for this.
829834265437282305 2017-02-09 23:28:01 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @GuardiansofD @VanillaRaider activision investor call
829834089066795011 2017-02-09 23:27:19 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @GuardiansofD relieved that it is 2017.  Was sad to hear 2018 rumors. Now to hope it ships finished and bug-free.  Or mostly.
829832746583343104 2017-02-09 23:21:58 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DekuBleep @jasonschreier it would be quite Dubious to show something then not include it.  What do you think this is Old Chicago?
829831848633180160 2017-02-09 23:18:24 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BumpusJ @jasonschreier yep.  If there was no pressure, games would NEVER get released. Most AAA devs are perfectionists.  Pressure=balance
829825404231938048 2017-02-09 22:52:48 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @YouTube @MesaSean tranlation;  it might be a good time to buy activision stock folks
829654917006626816 2017-02-09 11:35:21 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @reddit @MesaSean @sionat19 no new info there anyway.  All of that was previously speculated on by other writers.
829522834309406720 2017-02-08 02:50:30 UTC <PalmettoVIP> So this is happening, and likely to draw a bigger crowd than the Inauguration!https://twitter.com/e3/status/829401453303316480

829482047274090497 2017-02-08 00:08:25 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @YouTube @DattosDestiny i switched to fusion awhile back because of this.  And honestly? Only get killed by shotguns when i screw up
829481792906395648 2017-02-08 00:07:25 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @YouTube @DattosDestiny what happened part 2;  after three years Destiny still is the only shooter that can't balance shotguns.  Smh
829481383617757184 2017-02-08 00:05:47 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @YouTube @DattosDestiny what happened?  Bungie hated bladedancers, that's what happened.  And i main a Titan for the record.
829450842055008258 2017-02-08 22:04:25 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MorninAfterKill so some people gonna be salty about the shotgun nerf.  #Destiny seems to be the only game that cant balance a shotgun

815192221221789696 2016-12-31 13:45:45 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MorninAfterKill you are partially correct.  She *was* the best but Women's MMA has evolved and adapted.

812756417782411265 2016-12-24 20:26:44 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @NFLonCBS please stop changing games mid game because of blowout. #FeelsBadMan
812755921394946049 2016-12-24 20:24:46 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @CBS One of the worst things network television does it when they decide you are no longer interested in a game & switch mid-game. Hate you @cbs
812755339531714560 2016-12-24 20:22:27 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @CBS please do a poll.  Your @NFL  viewers do NOT want you to switch games mid broadcast.  I was enjoying watching the Patriots stomp NYJ.

808635983415672832 2016-12-13 11:33:36 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @NeonLights_PS4 maybe in Destiny 2?
808635695048835072 2016-12-13 11:32:28 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG @Surfingtrooper actually in nearly all forms of organized competition there is.  Ever play sports?
808635400508112896 2016-12-13 11:31:17 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ItsRhemi @PorlyP in sparring yes, i have seen that too.  I meant a full contact match.  Could happen, but unlikely
808501729981513729 2016-12-12 02:40:08 UTC <PalmettoVIP> And speaking of pubstomps...https://twitter.com/patriots/status/808501366645751808
808500244140978181 2016-12-12 02:34:14 UTC <PalmettoVIP> all competition has some things in common.  I see that you feel strongly about this.  Going to guardiancon? (Cont)
808499252557152256 2016-12-12 02:30:17 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @nofunnoodles no, i don't think it will happen now.  I would be happy if we have it in Destiny 2.

808480671350095873 2016-12-12 01:16:27 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG @RobT75UK this is not true in any form of competition.  Match by skill, rise to top of pile, move up to the better pile.
808480397248069632 2016-12-12 01:15:22 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ItsRhemi @acific showing vs stomping.  2 different things.
808480244600553473 2016-12-12 01:14:45 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ItsRhemi @acific i take martial arts mate.  And i used to teach.  A black belt doesn't go 'all out' on a white belt.
808479493333647361 2016-12-12 01:11:46 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23  didn't expect my tweet to explode. Ty to everyone for the conversation, even if we disagree. Logging to watch NFL.  Nite
808478776971718656 2016-12-12 01:08:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ItsRhemi except there is no evidence of this.  Just pubstompers claiming it is so in order to justify pubstomping
808478322393022464 2016-12-12 01:07:07 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ItsRhemi use same metaphor with anything. Ping pong if you want.
808477669805453313 2016-12-12 01:04:31 UTC <PalmettoVIP> we don't get to see the formula of course, but seems like the cbmm was weighed MUCH heavier.  So, sbmm not completely gone
808477279525498880 2016-12-12 01:02:58 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 @The_GreatOne927 LOL
808477170742001672 2016-12-12 01:02:32 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ItsRhemi cont:  no, in all examples of competition, a person improves by playing against similar, or SLIGHTLY better comp.
808476902851833856 2016-12-12 01:01:29 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ItsRhemi really?  So if i am blackbelt and i fight a bunch of whitebelts, will they 'git gud' or will they quit?  (Cont.)
808476338248183808 2016-12-12 00:59:14 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 @The_GreatOne927 hahah thanks.  Just giving my feedback.  I was one of the people who relentlessly begged for cbmm
808475431972245504 2016-12-12 00:55:38 UTC <PalmettoVIP> no, i'm saying you shouldn't toss sbmm out the window, or maybe have 2 separate playlists
808474568243507200 2016-12-12 00:52:12 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @AngryAvatar ahh yes, make a high school football player 'git gud' by playing against NFL.  Doesn't work that way.
808474213019451392 2016-12-12 00:50:47 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG @probablynotandy i can agree with that idea!
808473797967876096 2016-12-12 00:49:08 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @ShotXBL @jellybeansrfun high school players don't 'git gud' by playing against NFL teams.  That would make them quit.
808473258693627904 2016-12-12 00:47:00 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @YouTube @MesaSean glad i am not the only one noticing. @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23
808472889443893248 2016-12-12 00:45:32 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 hahah. I am losing more often now yes, and not by a margin that is fun.  But looking forward to new PVE
808472413281406976 2016-12-12 00:43:38 UTC <PalmettoVIP> ahh yes the 'git gud skrub' argument. Put NFL players in a game with high school players builds character.  LoL
808471986175406081 2016-12-12 00:41:56 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 i'm not gonna delete, but i'll be playing a lot less crucible.  Losing (or winning) by excess scores just isn't fun
808471324893057024 2016-12-12 00:39:19 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 hahah thanks Deej, more likely i will get hate mail!

808470949909696517 2016-12-12 00:37:49 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG @thebestTitan often yes
808464119301021696 2016-12-12 00:10:41 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG i want to apologize for begging for cbmm.  Yes, connections are better, lopsided games are not fun for me though.  :(

807791981342629889 2016-12-10 03:39:51 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @TheEconomist i guess we'll never know. The DNC was so committed to electing a candidate that 50% of the country strongly disliked...

807697591970529280 2016-12-10 21:24:46 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean lag is greatly reduced but as a less than average player, getting destroyed by top players is simply not fun.

799344098717081601 2016-11-17 20:10:58 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @TheBriarRabbit @PopeBear my opinion is that we need a ranked sbmm playlist and a cbmm playlist.  Problem solved.  BOOM!pic.twitter.com/iUzjbRloKO

796418091156729856 2016-11-09 18:24:04 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieInformer @DeeJ_BNG a bit sad about this, but okay.  How about some vault space though?
796417736222052352 2016-11-09 18:22:39 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MarkTurc me too Mark, but it is and always has been our job, the citizen's job to protect each other's rights. That doesn't change now.

795602367098064896 2016-11-07 12:22:40 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MoreConsole now that i think about it, probably fake.  The cabal are driving us out of the inner planets to Jupiter moons in #Destiny2

784025015385751553 2016-10-06 13:38:24 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ElderScrolls @bethesda small spoiler here... but the Imperials sentence you to die at the very start of game... why would you support them?
784023732805332992 2016-10-06 13:33:19 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Gothalion Happy Birthday King G!  Thanks for doing what you do for the Destiny community!
783863804027400192 2016-10-05 02:57:49 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieHelp guess somebody forgot to feed the hamsters huh?

783829788075102208 2016-10-05 00:42:38 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean i hit that wall at 354!!Was so frstrng! Even strks didnt help.Thnkflly IB pushed me over.I really don't like glass walls @Cozmo23
783826818520473600 2016-10-05 00:30:50 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @MorninAfterKill yeah but at least @bungie added matchmaking for court of oryx and CoE!!  Oh wait...NM.  @Cozmo23  help Plz!!
783822133969448960 2016-10-05 00:12:14 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MTashed shotties were so underpowered in Y2. Glad they are 'having a season.'  Good job @sharkeatsman  for changing it up.  Sniping got old
783803718735126528 2016-10-05 22:59:03 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf heheh. You said doody
783758756903546880 2016-10-05 20:00:23 UTC <PalmettoVIP> My guardian has a new love.. @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 @Be11eBunny @LacedUpLauren @MesaSeanpic.twitter.com/TwG2U90X6R
783747772331720704 2016-10-05 19:16:44 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf @LadyFaceshred players endured crappy shotguns for all of y2 and complained about shoulder charge....people cant make up minds
783741882123816960 2016-10-05 18:53:20 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny some kind of daily would have been fun... maybe for ten marks or rep boost or something
783707518400729088 2016-10-05 16:36:47 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Ownedbyagirl84 right back at ya! :)
783706593644974084 2016-10-05 16:33:07 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny lots of class items.. too many really, hoping to get some weapons, ghost, and artifact..
783706376669372416 2016-10-05 16:32:15 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MorninAfterKill you pregnant buddy?
783646674648375297 2016-10-05 12:35:01 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieInformer noticed this too, seems like it got a stability stealth buff.. but maybe just placebo?
783646344334471168 2016-10-05 12:33:42 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Ms5000watts @MesaSean i was thinking this too.  I personally like shotguns, but always nice to have some weapon diversity
783507374619369474 2016-10-04 03:21:29 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 i vote to fire lady efrideet.  She flew me into a match about to end three times in a row.
783107081750646784 2016-10-03 00:50:52 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ErinRRichards Hell hath no fury like Barbara Kean scorned..
782597076886650880 2016-10-02 15:04:17 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EW take this with a grain of salt.  Delays, re-writes... This timeline might happen, but be 'cautiously optimistic'
782595287110000640 2016-10-02 14:57:11 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 things that would improve RoI immdtly:vault space,remv thorn quest procRNG carry more siva offerings,+drop rate skel keys #Bungie
782570619699335168 2016-10-02 13:19:09 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @TODAYshow @DylanDreyerNBC keep us safe Dylan!
782337720630841345 2016-10-01 21:53:42 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean it went the way of 'vendors.'  Got siva'd man
782190226622050304 2016-10-01 12:07:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @cgbarrett @actor_morla  did u see the Eris cake?
782188524963504128 2016-10-01 12:00:51 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MorninAfterKill yup.  People just backing out like crazy.  If we go in solo, very hard to get a streak going
782188230565306368 2016-10-01 11:59:41 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @teft that shizzle is pretty
782187482800611329 2016-10-01 11:56:42 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @WandererDion @MorninAfterKill @Bungie *this*
782010974048030720 2016-09-30 00:15:19 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @chefandi @HellsKitchenFOX @FOXTV yes!  Always!
782009996930326528 2016-09-30 00:11:26 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean those skips grenades knocked my shoes and glasses off.  Then that terrible hunter rubbed my face in piss clams
781799327907872768 2016-09-30 10:14:19 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean why is he being such a putz this year?
781436382250172416 2016-09-29 10:12:06 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf @Be11eBunny @Destinykdub @MarkTurc @Clintus @MesaSean oh no!
781435881542615042 2016-09-29 10:10:07 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EliTe14970 @MorninAfterKill thorn tick?  Pffft. We don't need no stinking thorn tick!
781435428763238400 2016-09-29 10:08:19 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MorninAfterKill what other exotic you using?  Can you give a vidja with your setup Jay?
781434914759671808 2016-09-29 10:06:16 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy RNG on quest proc is a bad, bad idea.  Doesn't matter how long or how hard you play, you may never get it.  :(
781260393700352000 2016-09-28 22:32:47 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK @Akos64 oh our emotes SHOULD DEFINITELY carry over!!! @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 @Bungie
781253396791717888 2016-09-28 22:04:59 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PaulTassi @tripleWRECK all this worry is kind of moot.  Whatever is going to happen was decided last winter.  Trying to keep open mind..
781252038655172608 2016-09-28 21:59:35 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK hope you right
781251311941611520 2016-09-28 21:56:42 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK @HELLFIREV1 this is true, but you got great gear almost immediately in those sequels
781250588059271169 2016-09-28 21:53:49 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK gear? No, never promised.  Sure would have been nice though.. In destiny gear is the story of your guardian's adventures
781237169067270144 2016-09-28 21:00:30 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK it's the investment we have made in our current guardians, their gear, their adventures.. Was supposed to be continuing saga..
781197967130845185 2016-09-28 18:24:43 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy *THIS*. So much this.
781197525156040704 2016-09-28 18:22:58 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean its not bad, can hold it's own.  I find it on par with monte carlo
780944922090364928 2016-09-27 01:39:13 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieHelp @mi5ha360 i got close.. Missed the last jump.  Watching the person in front of me helped.  :/
780944465141850112 2016-09-27 01:37:24 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf 
780943848310771713 2016-09-27 01:34:57 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Owl_Sector @Be11eBunny it's from a source that has been 95% accurate in past.  If @Bungie hasn't denied it yet, most likely true
780943442755158016 2016-09-27 01:33:20 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny @BungieInformer same here.  I'm gonna try and keep an open mind, but the communities in most PC MMO get too big and too toxic :(
780942084308103168 2016-09-27 01:27:56 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @GuardiansofD @Kotaku makes me a little sad, a lot sad if we cant continue our characters and items.  That was alway the plan they sold..
780940429516795904 2016-09-27 01:21:22 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MTashed everything would change Mtash.. I can't say i like this idea..Trying to keep an open mind but mostly feeling sad about it. @Bungie
780882215991386112 2016-09-27 21:30:03 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG i really enjoyed 'combined arms' today.  Nice to see it's triumphant return!  Can we keep it??  Pleeeeeease??  #Destiny
780881804182061056 2016-09-27 21:28:24 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf this seems like a bad idea.. Sigh.
780881553077465088 2016-09-27 21:27:24 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy @Bungie @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23  to make matters worse, Eris doesn't have bounties so you have to do COO... What? Why??
780881130736250881 2016-09-27 21:25:44 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @teft @Ms5000watts @PopeBear @Holtzmann_YT @TheBriarRabbit @destinycompod can't wait y'all.
780880289820278785 2016-09-27 21:22:23 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieHelp 'skeletal keys drop less frequently than strike specific loot.'  There.  I fixed that for you.
780877416961048580 2016-09-27 21:10:58 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gameinformer she's getting a single player campaign?!?!?
780829941076287488 2016-09-27 18:02:19 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PopeBear is your new podcast up on itunes?  Can't seem to find it
780829251914326017 2016-09-27 17:59:35 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyReddit eris needs new bounties.. @Bungie please bring @actor_morla in for more lines too!  Maybe for Fest of Lost??
780828887936856064 2016-09-27 17:58:08 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean @mgs_cobra @teft @MyNameIsByf thankfully they are rare
780828533132234752 2016-09-27 17:56:44 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieInformer @BungieHelp ahh yes strike chest keys.. Even more rare than strike specific loot
780828050959327233 2016-09-27 17:54:49 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot 9 out 10
780711997918904320 2016-09-27 10:13:39 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean i got one too, haven't tried it yet.. Have u noticed a resurgence in zhalo use in crucible?
780710048146268161 2016-09-27 10:05:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK morning Ari!
780590038308511745 2016-09-26 02:09:02 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @wilw @jhaletweets Lester lost control of these shenanigans at minute 17
780587400254849024 2016-09-26 01:58:33 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Professorbroman i heard that the Speaker wanted to implement 'Stop and Frisk' in the Tower.. Good thing Cayde and Banshee beat that vote!
780556290930143232 2016-09-26 23:54:56 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf i want to know more about the original Iron Lords.. Such as 'what was Felwinter's Lie?'
780544335314124801 2016-09-26 23:07:26 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean i think i have an unfinished quest.. @actor_morla won't even offer me a bounty.  Stuck in the #friendzonepic.twitter.com/RKza6T57X0
780540163030122496 2016-09-26 22:50:51 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean Sean how are you leveling up Eris?  She doesn't give me bounties.. U using wormspore and hadrium flakes?
780354305589215232 2016-09-26 10:32:19 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @xJerzZx @tripleWRECK i could agree with that then Ari, gives people lots of options
780111481169907712 2016-09-25 18:27:25 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @chefandi finally catching up on Hell's Kitchen! You would think that anyone who wants to compete would practice scallops,risotto&wellington
780106003287314432 2016-09-25 18:05:39 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny that kid is being raised right!!
780105787490402304 2016-09-25 18:04:48 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EW i wish i could post 'nobody cares' but the reality is that this will sway a lot of votes
780101794231885824 2016-09-25 17:48:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @robbie1878 @MorninAfterKill i don't know about a cooldown, but drop rate seems MUCH lower anecdotally
780099799471230977 2016-09-25 17:41:00 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @AniMiaOfficial is that Enchantress??  Can we see the whole costume?
780098916461207552 2016-09-25 17:37:29 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot this is so stupid. Who cares?  Let the guy support Mickey Mouse for president for all I care.  None of my business.
780053774467563521 2016-09-25 14:38:07 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG link is broken now, but Iron Engrams mentioned in several articles, I can't seem to find them in game?
780053518090637312 2016-09-25 14:37:06 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 were the Iron Engrams cut from #RiseofIron ? are they coming in #IronBanner ?  #Destiny #Bungie https://www.vg247.com/2016/08/11/destiny-rise-of-iron-to-bring-new-iron-engrams---more/
780044839060725760 2016-09-25 14:02:36 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean Sean wasn't there supposed to be some new Iron Legacy engrams? 'To complete an Y1 collection?'  Did i imagine that?Or maybe at IB?
780023000062124032 2016-09-25 12:35:49 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @xJerzZx @tripleWRECK gotta disagree, not everyone wants to play raid or trials.  Unless you consider POE, IB, and strikes endgame.  Sorry.
779817567246508032 2016-09-24 22:59:30 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @KinpatsuCosplay amazing work!
779723435148734464 2016-09-24 16:45:28 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG @Bungie will you consider adding a radiant treasure for 1st weekly featured cruc match please?  #bungie #Destiny #ROI
779722339940458500 2016-09-24 16:41:07 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MTashed Mtash, this is probably just an influx of new players.  Took me awhile to find the best content producers when i started (crota)
779721980954148865 2016-09-24 16:39:41 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EW dang, is Billy Idol a vampire?? How is he looking so young?!?!?
779676972595183616 2016-09-24 13:40:50 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Polygon @Pocketsneak79 exactly!!
779676797629829120 2016-09-24 13:40:08 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Polygon really not getting why this is news worthy.. He can support mickey mouse for president for all i care
779512509690765313 2016-09-23 02:47:19 UTC <PalmettoVIP> Congrats to #ClanRedeem again.  Reigning champs until next raid.  #Destiny #RiseofIron #wrathofthemachine @Bungie @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNGpic.twitter.com/DOaZajy89g
779485261558345730 2016-09-23 00:59:03 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Gothalion well.. At least we have that Goth.  Remember the Bungie chart?  bubble titans have worst KD in crucible (overall)
779484846360002560 2016-09-23 00:57:24 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @chefandi my wife is out of town and we always watch it together, so i have to wait a few more days... :(
779447676224102400 2016-09-23 22:29:42 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23   Please tell the crucible team that Supremacy is AWESOME
779427779028844544 2016-09-23 21:10:38 UTC <PalmettoVIP> Big shout out to #ClanRedeem!  There was a lot of sour grapes, elitism, and negativity leading up #wrathofthemachine.   But Best team won.
779426740724699136 2016-09-23 21:06:30 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MorninAfterKill i agree!  It shouldn't always be professional gamers.  This is a great day for Destiny community
779395908161138689 2016-09-23 19:03:59 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ErinRRichards @Gotham Barbara Keane as new Queen of Gotham!
779275749643649024 2016-09-23 11:06:31 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG  ty for letting us choose how to level light.  casual players will actually be able to compete for world 1st now!
779274749591642112 2016-09-23 11:02:33 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf @HeyFitzy (cont) that was the problem at TTK launch.  I think best solution is to delay Trials and Raid for month after new DLC
779274526559526912 2016-09-23 11:01:40 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf @HeyFitzy otherwise, only the guardians who can play as a full time job would have unfair advantage (cont)
779274188062425088 2016-09-23 11:00:19 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy @MyNameIsByf the desire to power level is seductive because of things like *power matters* (trials) and world's 1st raid.  (Cont)
779270908582199296 2016-09-23 10:47:17 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieHelp couple bugs to report:  cryptarch in reef not giving packages, destiny companion will not show vendors on phone apps
779263592818282496 2016-09-23 10:18:13 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @GuardiansofD @DestinyNews_net Good luck to all the Guardians out there going for #Worlds1st today in #WoTM #Destiny #Bungie #RiseofIron
779262699398193152 2016-09-23 10:14:40 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf congrats.  Titan and Hunter got screwed this week.  Smh
779019227864891392 2016-09-22 18:07:12 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieHelp vendors section doesnt work on phone companion app since RoI launch
779018655275294722 2016-09-22 18:04:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DestinyTheGame since more people were able to get leveled up this time, it is actually much more fair this time.  Ty @Bungie !
779012616626855936 2016-09-22 17:40:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @TheCryptarch @Be11eBunny @BillMeNowGaming sorry Cryptarch.. It wasnt meant to be personal..
779012265903263745 2016-09-22 17:39:32 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieHelp @H0Tcup @Be11eBunny thnx, will try tonight
778989377011716096 2016-09-22 16:08:35 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @H0Tcup @Be11eBunny the reef cryptarch is bugged and isnt giving packages @BungieHelp
778989128306286592 2016-09-22 16:07:35 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Gothalion @WIFEthalion oh no, hope wifethalion is ok?!?

778920366609731584 2016-09-22 11:34:21 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Gothalion you had me at bacon bro... You had me at bacon..pic.twitter.com/AUbr14lRV6
778918969470255108 2016-09-22 11:28:48 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK @HeyFitzy i mostly feel bad for Xbox players.  They never got to experience Hawkmoon before the dark times.. Before the nerfs..
778776189464870912 2016-09-21 02:01:27 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MoreConsole brother that was your most hilarious video to date!
778760302162743296 2016-09-21 00:58:19 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG seriously, this is the most beautiful work your cinemarics and map team has done!  #RiseofIron
778750267760214016 2016-09-21 00:18:26 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf i look forward to it, but if you are tired i will be patient brother
778745437436071936 2016-09-21 23:59:15 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf @nKuchGaming (cont) the 'slow way' for TTK- i got destroyed in 'power matters' and swore 'never again.'  Gotta address that..
778744940394192896 2016-09-21 23:57:16 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf @nKuchGaming I respect you both, but remember this race is driven by 'worlds first' and 'power matters.'  Having done (cont)
778744062622830592 2016-09-21 23:53:47 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf @nKuchGaming @rezo_dj well, it was biased towards 'people who can play for living' first wks of TTK trials & raid
778743132439490564 2016-09-21 23:50:05 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf cont- so this time more people will have a fair chance first week trials, more have shot at worlds 1st raid.  That seems fair.
778742852977242112 2016-09-21 23:48:59 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf i'll watch, but my feeling is that if power matters, power hoarding evens the odds vs people who can 'play for a living'.(Cont)
778741751104180224 2016-09-21 23:44:36 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Gothalion cont.  would u find it better if raid was delayed by few weeks so everyone has chance to lev up (without hoarding/powerleveling)?
778741328687435776 2016-09-21 23:42:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Gothalion that seems harsh Goth?  If anything, i think KF world first was too biased against plyrs who couldn't play 24 hours prior 2 raid
778739787016450050 2016-09-21 23:36:48 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MTashed i would want to keep some of our gear, maybe let each player choose six exotics..as many have said, it tells your guardian's story
778739045438324736 2016-09-21 23:33:51 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @leahloveschief smart choice.  Were you a gunslinger previously?
778658725955506176 2016-09-21 18:14:41 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean wonder why they chose 320 and not 340 like other vendor rolls?
778430861616316416 2016-09-20 03:09:14 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean only got to play a lil.. But best moment was opening cinematics and that gorgeous mountain climb.  This DLC is GORGEOUS
778430163684102144 2016-09-20 03:06:28 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23  had to work all day, FINALLY got to play for a bit.. Guys, please tell the entire crew that this is their best yet!! TY!
778336741380022272 2016-09-20 20:55:14 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Gotham @ErinRRichards best scene of that episode Erin!
778335829852823553 2016-09-20 20:51:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PopeBear Pope did the beta version have more options/perk trees?  Or am I imagining that?
778297188350824451 2016-09-20 18:18:04 UTC <PalmettoVIP> Stuck @ work on lunch break and seeing all my fellow guardians with new gear... But meh wants to play!!! @MesaSean @Be11eBunny @Destinykdub

778188921326936064 2016-09-20 11:07:51 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean gonna be stuck at work all day bruh but will check your posts on break.  Can u post about if exotic engrams gave higher light?
778188508796227586 2016-09-20 11:06:13 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy will check your updates from work breaks.  Get some rest, looking forward to your posts
778188143279439872 2016-09-20 11:04:46 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 'if there are any updates'. Not '*when* there are updates?'    ::eep!::
778187763535450112 2016-09-20 11:03:15 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Professorbroman it's not the 'que' thing that hurts.. It's the reshuffle from #700 to #245,899.pic.twitter.com/GRO1ooPXJz
778187157198495744 2016-09-20 11:00:50 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot this is an inaccurate headline:  'with players being put in random shuffles'.  There, i fixed it for you
778185978661994496 2016-09-20 10:56:09 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyNews_net @BungieHelp @Bungie @BrotherVance @Lzacker there is no que.  just an illusion to make you think you have a chance
778181326507737088 2016-09-20 10:37:40 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @BungieHelp Have you tried turning it off then turning it back on?  Please hold the reset button for 5 seconds.. Anything now?
778176986531393536 2016-09-20 10:20:26 UTC <PalmettoVIP> Looks like SIVA got to #Bungie servers on #RiseofIron day, despite efforts by #OwlSector to protect us.  Sadness.
778176016955084800 2016-09-20 10:16:34 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @DestinyReddit ahhh yes, good call!  Ya know, because humans will become fossils before the que is finished
778175287808974848 2016-09-20 10:13:41 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyTheGame no.  No, you can't become an Iron Lord today.  You can only get in QUE to maybe one day become an Iron Lord
778173870809505793 2016-09-20 10:08:03 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy oh come on, i haven't seen msg like this since AOL games.. Sigh

777676581003198464 2016-09-18 01:12:00 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean same.  Bad idea by #apple
777676163611254784 2016-09-18 01:10:20 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieInformer and shards
777675162535792640 2016-09-18 01:06:21 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ThatRandomHuntr @BungieInformer but i will wait for confirmation before dismantling my OG khostov
777674939843416065 2016-09-18 01:05:28 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieInformer @ThatRandomHuntr in one of the summer interviews Bungie said you could start the Khostov quest B4 even starting the story
777597364206989312 2016-09-18 19:57:13 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ErinRRichards who will Rise?  My money is on Barbara..
777595348164415489 2016-09-18 19:49:12 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK true enough. But @sharkeatsman usually solves this by nerfing shotguns..spec ammo..and now finally snipers.

777296507414384640 2016-09-17 00:01:43 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyReddit this is a great idea!!
777141576782995456 2016-09-17 13:46:05 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @SayNoToRage @DestinyTheGame @DestinyNews_net @Bungie too late for quarantine protocols.  Please remain calm. #OwlSector
777141114004463617 2016-09-17 13:44:14 UTC <PalmettoVIP> We assumed The Dawning referenced the colonization of Mercury.  We, the Guardians, were wrong, dead wrong.  #OwlSector #RiseofIron #Destiny
777137787694944256 2016-09-17 13:31:01 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MarketWatch @cabaum1 yes please.  Actually replace the lot of them with robots please.

776935987385606145 2016-09-16 00:09:08 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MoreConsole Remember when you did this video??  Possible relation to the 'Calamity Dawn' mentioned by Owls?  http://youtu.be/KI9Wc4LCADI
776915161550553088 2016-09-16 22:46:23 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @TheEconomist maybe London will vote to secede?
776881926372196352 2016-09-16 20:34:19 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy you provide great service to this community bro.  Much thanks and respect
776834902473998337 2016-09-16 17:27:28 UTC <PalmettoVIP> #OwlSector  Dawn Calamnity reference to Rising Light event that was data mined last Spring?  Yea or Nay?
776833850781626370 2016-09-16 17:23:17 UTC <PalmettoVIP> #OwlSector Owl Sector = reef awoken?  Or Felwinter's camp?  Bypass Authority= Queen Sov or Ephridete?
776827962155003904 2016-09-16 16:59:53 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @javierabegazo gotcha.  No, i don't think so
776827772559826945 2016-09-16 16:59:08 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @SayNoToRage i hope you're wrong, it would basically be a mean thing to do after so many players spent last 30 days edging
776827012388356096 2016-09-16 16:56:07 UTC <PalmettoVIP> then we all screwed!  #GetDownWithTheSickness #OwlSector
776826684368715776 2016-09-16 16:54:48 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @javierabegazo pretty sure i got three viruses on one crucible kill.. But no way to confirm it, i checked it after the match
776823535629111296 2016-09-16 16:42:18 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG please tell me how i am to remain calm when all of the electric mosquitoes keep buzzing my helmet?

776790828119359488 2016-09-16 14:32:20 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean it's not you, it's bloom (bullet rng)

776590143822110720 2016-09-15 01:14:53 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @MorninAfterKill it's Bungie's damage referee.

775735720958889985 2016-09-13 16:39:43 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean wrong sir. The answer is 'because they are both members of the marsupial family'
775734451133374465 2016-09-13 16:34:40 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean alright there jerky.  What's the difference between a Fallen dreg and a Hive Thrall?
775729007228755970 2016-09-13 16:13:02 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @mpshanahan @tomstandage @TheEconomist personally i think robots will make better leaders than our current set of politicians.  #justsaying

775638357376368642 2016-09-13 10:12:49 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny not too many content producers cover strikes anymore and nobody has covered daily public events in a long time.. Just a thought?
775485780781305856 2016-09-12 00:06:32 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @GuardiansofD @Destinykdub nice to see them getting some love.  I always liked the scout/side arm combo!
775485044458651650 2016-09-12 00:03:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PaigeVanzantUFC wear a Red Sox shirt around the city.  They love that there.  (Kidding!!)
775484243967434752 2016-09-12 00:00:26 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PlayStation it got me wishing they had included a single player campaign
775390063710658560 2016-09-12 17:46:11 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @YouTube @Professorbroman don't be surprised when all of us Titans switch to juggernaught.  Inc cry for juggernaught nerf in 3...2..whaaaah!
775148365889830912 2016-09-11 01:45:46 UTC <PalmettoVIP> Red Vines or Twizzlers for #RiseofIron ?   #Bungie. #Destiny
775120810294013953 2016-09-11 23:56:16 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @TheEconomist well, we had a good run, us humans.

775066332832366592 2016-09-11 20:19:48 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EW this rivalry has always felt staged (and mutually beneficial)
774977472978976768 2016-09-11 14:26:42 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Professorbroman true, but i regret we didn't get to play with it a few days. They literally took away the toy before we could break it.
774977080094289921 2016-09-11 14:25:08 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MoreConsole holy sugar rush batman!!  What is a yorkie btw?  Can u show a pic when you open that?

774839363901489152 2016-09-10 05:17:54 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean yes.. Use it at Last Word ranges.  It melts in the short-mid range.  If they get close enough to shotgun. It's too close.
774838866314420224 2016-09-10 05:15:56 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyReddit we had a good run, was fun while it lasted.  Time to switch back to Sunbreaker. Burn baby burn.  Titan inferno
774837869403856896 2016-09-10 05:11:58 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @TheEconomist the legacy will be overpriced medicine that middle class can't afford because our politicians sold us out.

774808147143917568 2016-09-10 03:13:52 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DattosDestiny @MyNameIsByf well, fun while it lasted.
774778546011181057 2016-09-10 01:16:14 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @camrenbicondova when you are acting 'Selena' do you draw inspirations from any previous incarnations of Catwoman?  If so.. Which ones?  Ty!
774601959697420289 2016-09-10 13:34:33 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 #Destiny #RiseofIron #Bungie Did three of coins get a 'secret nerf' in that patch or am I just having a bad run?
774600261407010816 2016-09-10 13:27:48 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @SuperGeekGirls Ciri!!!  Awesome cosplay!!

774393369388806144 2016-09-09 23:45:41 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean can you put on some golf cleats and maybe kick me around the store while I watch the video?
774383139737178112 2016-09-09 23:05:02 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @TheEconomist 'mere details'. LoL
774377977358540800 2016-09-09 22:44:31 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EW wow, bad taste!  Who thought this was a good idea??
774376587567431680 2016-09-09 22:39:00 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EW yes please!!
774373185408143360 2016-09-09 22:25:29 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy well, in most games pvp weapons function differently, but #Bungie seems to stubbornly insist that they must feel the same
774372168243240960 2016-09-09 22:21:26 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @THEGaryBusey BAM!  Because logic mofos.  Logic.
774322706657447936 2016-09-09 19:04:54 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyNews_net @Be11eBunny i tend to rush through it, but i also don't mind playing some other games between RoI and Fest of Lost
774206607391617024 2016-09-09 11:23:33 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @SoAndSoNZ @MorninAfterKill did u try the alpha test Jay?  I thought the maps and gunplay were really good
773976975392247808 2016-09-08 20:11:05 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @TheBriarRabbit you shall not pass!
773976825269723136 2016-09-08 20:10:29 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Ownedbyagirl84 i'm a bit sad about the changes to Rocket Launchers.. Had a God-Roll RL+now have to spend months praying to RNG for new meta
773976131372457984 2016-09-08 20:07:44 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny @Bungie public events are worthwhile again!! Woot woot!!
773975822197727233 2016-09-08 20:06:30 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie ty for making public events valuable again!  Buyah!
773962220875182080 2016-09-08 19:12:27 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @thebreadlord @MorninAfterKill actually, they went through about 4 rounds of nerfs.  Shottys used to be MUCH stronger.
773950600287494145 2016-09-08 18:26:17 UTC <PalmettoVIP> LoL. Yep, throwing knives were so OP, good thing @sharkeatsman  nerfed them!
773935242348490753 2016-09-08 17:25:15 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie looks pretty good.. Maybe Fabian Strategy will finally compete with Tlaloc.  How about some love for Ace of Spades next time?
773907143187632128 2016-09-08 15:33:36 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @VampyBitme lucid dreaming is a sign of high intelligence =)
773676355103887360 2016-09-07 00:16:31 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MarketWatch that's a terrible idea.  Think i will keep my current Iphone.  I prefer the earbud jack and several pairs of cheap airbuds
773580649424977920 2016-09-07 17:56:13 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @YayaHan you need that!!
773519671886811136 2016-09-07 13:53:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Polygon why do i have a feeling that 2017 E3 will have an ad that states: coming next year 'Super Slim Neo 2.0'.
773469223515484160 2016-09-07 10:33:27 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean me too, but hopefully @DeeJ_BNG and @Cozmo23  are listening and he will get an overhaul for Fest of Lost
773277369348087808 2016-09-06 21:51:06 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Polygon it means that in 2 years we will all be led to believe that we need the 'new and improved superslim Neo 3.0'
773211083154845696 2016-09-06 17:27:42 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @destinytrack @Ownedbyagirl84 Noooooo!pic.twitter.com/7aYlVP5bjQ
773201961424486402 2016-09-06 16:51:27 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean @hunter93557   I'm guessing that will be in a mid-Fall update, probably same time as Fest of Lost and 'vault kiosk expansion'
773200639962808320 2016-09-06 16:46:12 UTC <PalmettoVIP> like stealing candy from a babe Autumnatic
772846910851850240 2016-09-05 17:20:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf @MoreConsole how come you two never call each other 'wankers?'  Is that considered really bad?  Like the f-word here?
772591129665626114 2016-09-04 00:24:14 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @hellogames @NoMansSky can you guys please give us some patch notes? tell us what to look for? Please?
772579884929519616 2016-09-04 23:39:33 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @thislukesmith is that your ebay account Luke??  (Just kidding!!)
772530726675836929 2016-09-04 20:24:12 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MoreConsole would defeat the purpose of our choices if we couldn't bring them forward.  It's the cheesiest way to force rebalance.
772528361130393600 2016-09-04 20:14:48 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BrotherVance perhaps the moral of that story is that they should not be made so exclusive?
772433248874065924 2016-09-04 13:56:52 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MoreConsole yes please!
772430112012767232 2016-09-04 13:44:24 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Loriipops oh no, sorry to read this Lorii.  It will all be ok, but a major pain in butt. :(
772429612982960128 2016-09-04 13:42:25 UTC <PalmettoVIP> i main a Titan, but was playing around with my Hunter and deadeye/celestial combo and was hitting for 38,000 on Ultras. Woah!
771794632657235968 2016-09-02 19:39:14 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Polygon big movie companies always afraid to introduce new IP to mainstream.. Always playing it safe w sequels and re-makes.
771695578103373825 2016-09-02 13:05:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @VideoGamCosplay @MiyukiCosplay awesome D.va

771139016007806976 2016-08-31 00:14:03 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MoreConsole censorship... Sigh
771108270899654680 2016-08-31 22:11:52 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean yeah i struggle too, except for the fighter squadron stuff, but death star looks so good.  I'm gonna need new shoes and glasses
771107008019894272 2016-08-31 22:06:51 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @YouTube @Gothalion ps4 players got shaft on Halo.  Nothing is ever fair.  Exclusives bad for all of us
771106789165326336 2016-08-31 22:05:59 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MoreConsole @HeyFitzy by PVP do u mean any crucible match?  Or just trials?
771106198196289536 2016-08-31 22:03:38 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MoreConsole @HeyFitzy i don't know.. Felt like y1 was too far in other direction.. Casually players should have a chance at exotics..
771081749245878272 2016-08-31 20:26:29 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean  Mesa fails what am I gonna do?  Death Star DLC possibly releasing same week as Rise of Iron??  So much hype...
771080335618703360 2016-08-31 20:20:52 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot 'the Division is going to kill Destiny'. - said nobody today
771078420377862144 2016-08-31 20:13:16 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot the real question should be 'are they even still making Mass Effect Andromeda?'  Not hardly a peep comes out of that team..

769294688062877696 2016-08-26 22:05:21 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MarketWatch good, let's do this.  I bet our Robot Overlords will do a better job of managing the nation than our politicians.
769293253011120128 2016-08-26 21:59:38 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean @MarkTurc @Destinykdub @GuardiansofD @Be11eBunny it is awesome u all in same spot, wish i could be there to meet fave podcasters
769292141470167040 2016-08-26 21:55:13 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK @MTashed i gotta know... When u two banter.. Is it legit dislike or just friendly rivalry?
769125909953642496 2016-08-26 10:54:41 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MorninAfterKill hahah i love it.  I want all 1000 yard hard scopers to taste the salty buckshot of #UniversalRemotesForEveryone!!
768772309855461376 2016-08-25 11:29:36 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @NoMansSky is the PS4 patch going to patch the 'unchargeable photon cannon' bug? Running from combat doesn't make for fun gaming #NoMansSky
768624811249659904 2016-08-24 01:43:30 UTC <PalmettoVIP> Great interview with Deej by @MyNameIsByfhttps://twitter.com/mynameisbyf/status/768554047670550528
768612951263744000 2016-08-24 00:56:22 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @NoMansSky @gamespot @martyscizlak yeah and thats a temp fix but i dont want to play a game where i always have to run from a fight.
768610005339762690 2016-08-24 00:44:40 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Polygon i suppose you could fight back at things if photon cannon could be recharged. @NoMansSky come on Sean and team! Patch this bug!
768448227628703746 2016-08-24 14:01:49 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot @NoMansSky please tell us it is finally fixing the unchargeable photon cannon bug. Games that dont allow u to fight back arent fun
768392081463181312 2016-08-24 10:18:42 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MorninAfterKill i'll never get a zombie apocalypse. :(
768260017539670016 2016-08-23 01:33:56 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @NoMansSky how much longer until the ps4 unchargeable photon cannon is patched?  Game is losing fun since i cant defend in space ?
768222859764301825 2016-08-23 23:06:17 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot dang...looks like a herd of zombies

767775097876783104 2016-08-22 17:27:02 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot is this game still in development?  Didnt a lot of the writers and programmers quit?
767774847011319808 2016-08-22 17:26:02 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @1843mag @TheEconomist misleading article.  Game is doing well, sold tons of copies and is fun to play,

767342960891527168 2016-08-21 12:49:53 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot minimal difference, and why I ultimately switched to console gaming.  No more fighting with drivers/graphics cards.  #NoRegrets

766766938756378624 2016-08-19 22:40:58 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @1843mag @TheEconomist this is misleading.. This game has sold a ton of copies and is very popular right now

766314938096820224 2016-08-18 16:44:53 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @mi5ha360 always room for imprvmnt. How about eliminating exotic quests that require players to be insanely good pvp or to 'rumble boost' ?

766035374372192256 2016-08-17 22:14:00 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot is this game still being released?  Didn't a bunch of the writers and programmers quit last year?

746174285467820032 2016-06-23 02:53:07 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MarketWatch the pound need not worry. Any losses will be brief
746173344043704320 2016-06-23 02:49:23 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BUSINESSricardo meh no worries.  Still killing the Euro and will continue to do so if #Brexit

745062022778339328 2016-06-20 01:13:23 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieHelp perhaps the damage referee broke the internet, you know, instead of 'fixing it?'

743035595736375296 2016-06-15 11:01:05 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean it would be awesome if exotic but still cool if legendary if we can infuse it up
743035029513752576 2016-06-15 10:58:50 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean @Destinykdub same here Kdub.  But i gotta believe more toys are coming...this one was a bit out of budget, though i wanted it bad.
743027270181396480 2016-06-15 10:28:00 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @BrotherVance no, that is our 'damage referee.' It is functioning as intended.  See?  We fixed the internet (kappa)

742840411039903744 2016-06-14 22:05:29 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @BungieHelp i am experiencing something weird:  my throwing knives are more like throwing daiseys now. 
742839979496382464 2016-06-14 22:03:47 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieInformer Yay!!! Is this the Rise of Iron stuff we were waiting for?!?!?
742824127032090624 2016-06-14 21:00:47 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @sharkeatsman Hating throwing knives is akin to hating apple pie, fireworks, Elvis or baby unicorns. #why #Destiny
742823725020643328 2016-06-14 20:59:11 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @sharkeatsman @Bungie Nerfing throwing knives is like saying butterflies need to be eliminated. They weren't hurting anyone #destiny
742798496051388417 2016-06-14 19:18:56 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MTashed yes, that throwing knife nerf was needed... I mean i got killed by FOUR of those things this year!!
742797919368142848 2016-06-14 19:16:39 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG but we needs more Rise of Iron footage.. But Deeeeeeeeeej we been so good!  Please sir, a little more porridge?!?!
742797449580969985 2016-06-14 19:14:47 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Ownedbyagirl84 because the sandbox team hates throwing knives
742796827897004034 2016-06-14 19:12:18 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieInformer would have preferred they just remove it. Doing COE 3-9x per week is making the content irrelevent

742671867757113344 2016-06-14 10:55:46 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy well you R right there.  @sharkeatsman ignored the outcry when we tried to tell him firebolts too strong, sunbreakr nerf too harsh
742670892879249408 2016-06-14 10:51:53 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy the doctrine nerf was needed. The throwing knife nerf is ridiculous... Precision shot with throwing knife was high risk+skill
742670431681978368 2016-06-14 10:50:03 UTC <PalmettoVIP> we Titans punch and smash, no time for these smarty pants tactics you speak of!

742532881550082049 2016-06-13 01:43:29 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @sharkeatsman but this nerf to gunslingers is heavy handed.. I mean throwing knife took skill... But u don't reward it?  Come on..
742531929451450368 2016-06-13 01:39:42 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @sharkeatsman @Bungie the doctrine nerf was overdue, we told you the sunbreaker nerf was too much and that firebolts needed more.. (Cont)
742527262940135424 2016-06-13 01:21:09 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK hitting them with a throwing knife took even more skill.. What happened to 'we like to reward skill'

742523566411907072 2016-06-13 01:06:28 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 the hunter nerfs seem heavy handed but i main a Titan so just gonna shake my head.  Nice job on doctrine nerf though
742522693728227329 2016-06-13 01:03:00 UTC <PalmettoVIP> and the Sunbreakers are rising again!

742518447075037184 2016-06-13 00:46:07 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie i don't usually like nerfs but that Doctrine one was waaaaaaay overdue.  What took ya so long @thislukesmith
742503242848972800 2016-06-13 23:45:42 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK gunslinger class is now dead.  Helloooo intelligence bladedancer

742309421880082432 2016-06-13 10:55:32 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PreyGame @bethesda the gameplay looks great.  I cant remember the Prey storyline... Can someone give me a recap?
742128804345315328 2016-06-12 22:57:49 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @StrawPollme @MassEffect_News @ClahrmerN7 @MysticalDigital probably means the fact that it is likely to get delayed again, and again
742128420923015168 2016-06-12 22:56:18 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MassEffect_News i have to be honest, with the number of high level writers and programs that bailed on this project this year..I am worried
741966867762401281 2016-06-12 12:14:21 UTC <PalmettoVIP> What we have been given was nowhere near what was promised. Managed care is NOT universal health care.https://twitter.com/berniesanders/status/741730502969679873
741966068068057089 2016-06-12 12:11:10 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyNews_net now they really are Space Pirates.  Arrhggh
741965742640365570 2016-06-12 12:09:52 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Holtzmann_PD what causes that, ordinary lag or lag switching?
741733401472970752 2016-06-11 20:46:38 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Holtzmann_PD sorry to hear that. 
741732864153268224 2016-06-11 20:44:30 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @WilliamShatner Mr. Shatner, how do you prefer your eggs?  Boiled, fried, poached, deviled, pickled, or scrambled?
741732463085510656 2016-06-11 20:42:54 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @masseffect yes!! Cant wait for Andromeda
741732139834740736 2016-06-11 20:41:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Holtzmann_PD have you ever tried @comcastcares ?  They actually helped me fix my connection issues ( ended up being a mole chewed cable)
741597586621091840 2016-06-11 11:46:57 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK FINISH THEM!
741596546815434752 2016-06-11 11:42:49 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ControllerChaos @MTashed dang that is ballzy!
741589794883555328 2016-06-11 11:15:59 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyNews_net can u guys do an updated review of red death pls?  Trying to use this in crucible and getting destroyed..
741431133582286848 2016-06-10 00:45:32 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK well honesty is generally the way to go man, even if some people cant handle it
741430904795582464 2016-06-10 00:44:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot google snoop is pissed at xbox
741388575720263680 2016-06-10 21:56:25 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot and I'm not talking about Scorpion vs Neo, i am talking next gen
741388402331922432 2016-06-10 21:55:44 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot agreed when current gamers make the next jump in consoles, there will be a lot of conversions. Even Snoop is pissed
741387583188537344 2016-06-10 21:52:28 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot pretty much just 'show up'
741387105503465472 2016-06-10 21:50:34 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK are u speaking about sbmm vs cbmm?
741385396525883393 2016-06-10 21:43:47 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Polygon by releasing twitch trailers  2 weeks prior to E3 and skip the costs of a big hall or big press release there
741385114811240448 2016-06-10 21:42:40 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Polygon it is time to evolve, its a bit sad in a way.. But big devs have realized that they can have a bigger splash and less costly (cont)
741373298366402560 2016-06-10 20:55:43 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK specifically, what period of year 1 was your favorite?  I know most hated it but the Felwinter's era was most fun imho
741372270329925637 2016-06-10 20:51:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Darc_HK @MyNameIsByf wait, is that Lisa Kudrow?  Why is Phoebe hating on gamers?
741369673862815744 2016-06-10 20:41:18 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Darc_HK @MyNameIsByf who is that lady anyway?  What presentation is that?  Bet she spends 4 hours per night watching reality tv
741369425731948544 2016-06-10 20:40:19 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Darc_HK @MyNameIsByf the answer is yes
741228809375088640 2016-06-10 11:21:34 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyReddit @BrotherVance #Overwhat?
741228337062891520 2016-06-10 11:19:41 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny @MesaSean Lord Saladin's 'super' is the ability to bust through concrete walls?!?! Dang he is like the flipping Kool Aid guy...
741032129342111744 2016-06-09 22:20:02 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG but deeeeeeeeeej
741028010707554305 2016-06-09 22:03:40 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @teft i sure hope not.. Its such a kick in the pants.  Good job earning all those prizes, we're gonna make 'em useless now!!  Huzzah!
741027634398826496 2016-06-09 22:02:10 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @SophieT saw Xmen: Apoc last night. You were great as Jean Grey'
741027087973265409 2016-06-09 22:00:00 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @2Scott2Furious @cgbarrett @TheRealSckank @DeeJ_BNG very excited for the next year in Destiny.  Thank you Bungie!
740995005989408768 2016-06-09 19:52:31 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf do u remember the 2013 vidoc  'see that mountain in the distance? You can go there'. I think this is that map finally releases
740972791642611713 2016-06-09 18:24:14 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Hollowtide @BungieInformer leaked info says that you will need to infuse your original khostov with a box of raisins.. @actor_morla
740972307951288320 2016-06-09 18:22:19 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny that Titan armor looks bombdiggity
740971149866242048 2016-06-09 18:17:43 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieInformer @MrNebulosz @TheSpazmatic so the preorder is basically the black one?
740950714374098944 2016-06-09 16:56:31 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Budweiser wait, what?!?  Was Budweiser recently sold back to US investors??
740659955817189376 2016-06-08 21:41:08 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinLegarie @franmirabella @LittleBigOkey @BungieInformer @pandamusk that is OUTSTANDING!!
740618469440401408 2016-06-08 18:56:17 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @DestinyTheGame new cutscenes?!?!  Can't wait!!
740617913263132675 2016-06-08 18:54:05 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean hello are you the arms day vendor? I need security, i'm very insecure.  Maybe you could throw me a beating or give me a talking to
740595294618943488 2016-06-08 17:24:12 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Professorbroman when i get bagged i just laugh, it's funny.  Do you seriously report people for this Broman?
740354758695866368 2016-06-07 01:28:24 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EW @WilliamShatner   Of course it is a Masterpiece!
740307233003737088 2016-06-07 22:19:33 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @YouTube @MesaSean Guardians You do not address Sylok like that sir.  The answer is marsupials liver lips.  You that damn well
740302641700409344 2016-06-07 22:01:18 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG Dear Deej, why does Variks get so excited about Sylok the Defiled?  What's their history?
740300698680627200 2016-06-07 21:53:35 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @YouTube @MesaSean i think your speakpipe this week should be Frank Rizzo impersonating Variks introducing Psylok the defiled!
740298826083389442 2016-06-07 21:46:08 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf Byf for Prime Minister!!
740133161816981504 2016-06-07 10:47:51 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @cameraneubanks @ShepRose @Kay819 @Bravotv oh man, that buyer had NO sense of humor.  He wasn't playing ShepRose!  Did he put an offer in?
740132336147308544 2016-06-07 10:44:34 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ShepRose @AllUpOnDiaz honesty is always the best policy #shepistotleforpresident
739935853166927876 2016-06-06 21:43:49 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @librarydenizen well.. The movie    is definitely not terrific but Mystique is a great character, very strong and smart.
739772859002834944 2016-06-06 10:56:08 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @librarydenizen have you gone to see the movie yet?
739767006287781888 2016-06-06 10:32:53 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny you need a Charleston trip next!
738858871318413312 2016-06-03 22:24:16 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EW @librarydenizen who also have several other Mystique posters out.  I hope u go and enjoy the movie.  Mystique is a great character.
738856661540954112 2016-06-03 22:15:30 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EW @FernandoFerna20 fair enough, but the point was that the movies have not made her out to be a helpless victim..Quite the opposite really
738855531780005889 2016-06-03 22:11:00 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EW @librarydenizen my final thought?  Do we have gender and race equality issues in media?  Absolutely.  Is this an example of that?  Hmmm
738854893432119296 2016-06-03 22:08:28 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EW @librarydenizen HUGELY important (say any more and i risk spoilers).  This pic is 1 second in a 2 hour film. #Outofcontext
738854563705278465 2016-06-03 22:07:09 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EW @librarydenizen so not sure why others would think this was some hollywood plot to exploit or victimize..if anything they have made her
738854136234397697 2016-06-03 22:05:27 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EW @librarydenizen i did a quick google search.  There are several Mystique posters, only 1 shows her fighting Apocalypse (cont)
738852991889874944 2016-06-03 22:00:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EW @librarydenizen what are you suggesting?  I see this poster and i worry for one of my favorite characters..not seeing her as 'weak'
738797140420481024 2016-06-03 18:18:59 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EW did she see the movie? Marvel portrays Mystique as one of their strongest and smartest characters.....
738783756694196225 2016-06-03 17:25:48 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy well.. Devils advocate, people complained that xur wasnt bringing a weapon every week.. So maybe this was in response to that?
738782493625704448 2016-06-03 17:20:47 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MorninAfterKill Jay it's become the 'new normal' to reveal before E3.  Other devs will follow suit.. Just wait.. Like superbowl commercials
738782178495062016 2016-06-03 17:19:31 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean woot was missing those Titan gloves!  Just need Red Death now...
738495538623041537 2016-06-02 22:20:31 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG 'something to look forward to just over the horizon'. Sounds like a DAWNING at #bungie #destinythegame   We see what you did there
738489533432508416 2016-06-02 21:56:39 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG yeah man...
738487295544852481 2016-06-02 21:47:46 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ImTheBlueRanger @Gothalion i'm sure you've brought people to the table King.  But good on you, you deserve it for your content
738486201213169664 2016-06-02 21:43:25 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Gothalion @ImTheBlueRanger 600k is nothing to sneeze at #math

738314155883646981 2016-06-02 10:19:46 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny its fun, and very colorful but... Just doesnt seem like it has staying power.  Give it another few weeks and people will be back
738182706127835136 2016-06-01 01:37:26 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG and the post-E3 streams?!?!!
738145363836559360 2016-06-01 23:09:03 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Gothalion i think u would see Bungie scramble fast.  Truth is, you all are their best sales people
738145190217539584 2016-06-01 23:08:22 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Gothalion i think it goes beyond that.  If you, Ari, and Mtash said (example) 'sniper rifles stink now, not playing destiny anymore' (cont)
738144749899501568 2016-06-01 23:06:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean listen you puny little girly man.  You can not handle arms day.  Therefore you should have the Governator handle your puny video
738088086266077184 2016-06-01 19:21:27 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Gothalion i think streamers and content producers have much more influence than you realize.
737950234509250560 2016-06-01 10:13:41 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean maybe they will edit out that ridiculous air raid siren from the trailer.  I LOVE Star Wars, but that trailer was bad..
737720299186163712 2016-05-31 19:00:00 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG @Bungie great job on IB drop rates.You guys deserve an 'attaboy.' Ty for listening to feedbackpic.twitter.com/nOscoeh5I6
737717857111408640 2016-05-31 18:50:17 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot good, maybe they will edit out that ridiculous air raid siren on the trailer
736927208682459136 2016-05-29 14:28:32 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean i agree
736748881212542976 2016-05-28 02:39:56 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean its ok, it can almost hold own against doctrine but not quite
736714108599455744 2016-05-28 00:21:45 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean just got me a Grim Citizen w/ icarus.  U get yours there yet Mr Rizzo?
736687091313201152 2016-05-28 22:34:24 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MorninAfterKill i have a feeling this E3 is not going to have a ton of new announcements but rather more footage of games from last E3
736535991264157696 2016-05-28 12:33:59 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @EW YES PLEASE!!!
736535837165420544 2016-05-28 12:33:22 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeerParkWtr what could possibly go wrong?
736371400764760068 2016-05-27 01:39:57 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @CrucibleRadio what was that website you guys mentioned that lets you rate your drop?
736346949130059776 2016-05-27 00:02:47 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf I have a theory that the 'Nine' are rogue Guardians living on Jovian moons, sympathetic to humanity but not the Vanguard?
736326881843261440 2016-05-27 22:43:03 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MTashed fun, but no staying power
736304733028294656 2016-05-27 21:15:02 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @CruciblePB thanks for the info
736261818805555201 2016-05-27 18:24:31 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG @Bungie @Destinykdub yes, this needs to happen.. Like weapon parts.  Quality of life issue
736148835257421824 2016-05-27 10:55:33 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @thislukesmith did you mean 0.04% ?  @sharkeatsman
735816484904144897 2016-05-26 12:54:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean why not? Sue everybody!

735782277100101633 2016-05-26 10:38:59 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG @Mrs5oooWatts @PopeBear Pope BNG will their be a Tower Schizm that allows me to choose Team Eris/Speaker?
735781088308535296 2016-05-26 10:34:16 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PopeBear Pope it's raining loot, like purple manna from Heaven!  Your dream is finally being realized!!

735774926230016000 2016-05-26 10:09:47 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny @IGN dang, i wonder what bug they encountered?  It was nearly done
735648926632644608 2016-05-25 01:49:06 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 @Bungie IB drop rate is good, lots of fun, ty!!
735592424022609921 2016-05-25 22:04:35 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @KilllgoreTrout @Bungie @HeyFitzy great news!  The community owes you a debt that can't be repaid
735579151126691840 2016-05-25 21:11:50 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot Lord Saladin and Shaxx!! They are the best!
735577436683960326 2016-05-25 21:05:01 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @BungieInformer @Cozmo23 Awesome thanks Cozmo!!!
735577167103459329 2016-05-25 21:03:57 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @HeyFitzy @KilllgoreTrout i cant play for few hours, how are drops so far?
735568695305633793 2016-05-25 20:30:17 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PlayOverwatch @Polygon @ohjefframos wasn't trying to be cheeky.  Destiny does same thing.  I prefer having the story in game
735524703520083969 2016-05-25 17:35:29 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie we ever getting Rifts again?  Was i the only person who enjoyed it?
735524485567262721 2016-05-25 17:34:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieHelp @BungieInformer not likely until Destiny 2 bruh..
735524370844651520 2016-05-25 17:34:10 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieInformer this is interesting.. Didn't know about the supers glitch but explains the Rifts beating i took... Was like what da....???
735523884573818881 2016-05-25 17:32:14 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Gothalion i liked IB Rifts but maybe i was in minority... Doesn't seem likely to happen again.. @Bungie @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG #Destiny
735522656796217344 2016-05-25 17:27:21 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Gothalion 
735522059888005125 2016-05-25 17:24:59 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ohjefframos @Polygon @PlayOverwatch  Is this the new trend in gaming?  'No really, there is a story, we just decided to not put it in game'
735416817309585408 2016-05-25 10:26:47 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MorninAfterKill no, it is the version that never should have been made
735216004104630273 2016-05-24 21:08:49 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean think i will do this instead of CoE this week.. Dont like that shield debuff modifier.  Thanks for the tip liver lips.
735152417407393795 2016-05-24 16:56:09 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @TheCryptarch @MyNameIsByf @HeyFitzy A Happy Birthday toast for Deej?
735151667990147072 2016-05-24 16:53:10 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MrFruitYT people are still playing Overwatch?  
734913338535219200 2016-05-23 01:06:08 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean that is hilarious!
734882376556371969 2016-05-23 23:03:06 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Not_Jez give it a couple weeks.  Fun but little replay value.  No single player campaign was a big mistake
734882078412640258 2016-05-23 23:01:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean is max still violating the poor pillow?
734838652350664704 2016-05-23 20:09:22 UTC <PalmettoVIP> Happy Birthday @DeeJ_BNG #Destiny #bungie #wishdeejhappybday. Spread the word guardians!
734800514588803073 2016-05-23 17:37:49 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @sharkeatsman  ty for making fusion rifles fun again.  PVP should always have an alternative to sniping.  That's been missing since shotnerf
734787250286960640 2016-05-23 16:45:06 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG @sharkeatsman Suros Reg. needs bigger buff. Still outgunned in crucible. Need better options to lure us off doctrine/mida
734786489033359360 2016-05-23 16:42:05 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MrFruitYT unfortunately still can't compete w/ either Doctrine or Mida which means it is still outgunned 65% of the time. Needs bigger buff
734773456861077506 2016-05-23 15:50:18 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ShepRose HOLD THE DOOR SHEP!!!!
734559586447982592 2016-05-22 01:40:27 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean is the Doctor in there with a patient?  Is he burning him up with a hot poker?  Make him call me right away.
734409668492185601 2016-05-22 15:44:44 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @GrapesnMyMouth_ @MorninAfterKill Do you think it's a Regional thing?  I'm in Charleston SC.. Very populated.  Where you at?
734373770832535552 2016-05-22 13:22:05 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @GrapesnMyMouth_ @MorninAfterKill I'm not seeing that, i get matched in less than minute and picked up for LFG in less than 5
734373179670573056 2016-05-22 13:19:44 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @GrapesnMyMouth_ @MorninAfterKill the new POE is fun, and drops/packages are better than ever.  Would love to see a summer SRL
734372871418589184 2016-05-22 13:18:31 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HELLFIREV1 @MorninAfterKill agree.  Surprised people are still playing it.  Oh well, to each their own
734372574092759041 2016-05-22 13:17:20 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean doh!  I forgot to grab the Arma D!  Oh well, i have a decent roll on one and have too many weapons anyway...

733766353144958976 2016-05-20 21:08:25 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean those sunbreakers would probably burn me up, like hot pokers... I cant have that

733716363534053377 2016-05-20 17:49:47 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @lars_bakken @BungieHelp remember when hunters had that broken 'unlimited arrow' glitch & u just disabled that perk until it could b fixed?
733716023480832000 2016-05-20 17:48:26 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MTashed what is your definition of 'mature discussion' here?
733715644131254273 2016-05-20 17:46:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Gothalion nah, could work with vex time gating.

733674404111093760 2016-05-20 15:03:03 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf thanks for the link.. Was actually wondering if it meant that the Traveller had a yang to his yin and that a giant (continued)
733624809939214336 2016-05-20 11:45:59 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean was a good week!  I was missing glasshouse and sunbreakers.  Still need red death...
733622788246896640 2016-05-20 11:37:57 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MyNameIsByf what do you think it means when Xur says 'your traveller has a dark mirror?'
733412542274379780 2016-05-19 21:42:30 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy amen Fitzy.  See you all back in 2 weeks
733374553116803072 2016-05-19 19:11:33 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyNews_net @TheBriarRabbit if the tower were like Survivor, which npc should be voted off?
732877562108620800 2016-05-18 10:16:41 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean people are still playing the Division? (Sorry, couldn't resist after all the crap the Div audience gave the Dest crowd)
732342801833332736 2016-05-16 22:51:44 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean put your boss on the phone, i got some stones i wanna unload, i got a little job for you on the side honey.  -Frank Rizzo
732330656450088961 2016-05-16 22:03:29 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean thanks for this tip Sean.  I skipped CoE this weekend in favor of mayhem farming and didn't regret it
732153503804706817 2016-05-16 10:19:32 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean get a drink & check my msgs BEFORE the fly -in
732153332933005312 2016-05-16 10:18:51 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean i agree.  Do you think part of the problem is the lengthy matchmaking?  It takes so long now that i know i can use the restroom &
731496049534177280 2016-05-14 14:47:03 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @MesaSean @rezo_dj i follow their guardian at that point and just keep punching them in the back of the head.  Feels good.
731495810584719361 2016-05-14 14:46:06 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @MesaSean Sean make sure to hit the 'report' button for inactivity.  They *do* monitor it and ban, if repeat offender
731494993140023298 2016-05-14 14:42:51 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy i would love to also be able to jump into 'open matches' that are cbmm and test my mettle too
731494750088527872 2016-05-14 14:41:53 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy it would be the best of both worlds.  I am less than average, i want to be grouped with others in this skill base.  But (more)
731443072530300928 2016-05-14 11:16:32 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy ok have seen similar but it also malfunctions... A lot!!! Ive been green bar (all night) and unable to do damage
731441839966945285 2016-05-14 11:11:38 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy when u say 'you can feel' damage referee, what do you mean?  Can u link a vid?
731441364261539840 2016-05-14 11:09:45 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy it is mind boggling that this wasn't a priority for year 2. #bungie #destinythegame @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG
731441086921609217 2016-05-14 11:08:39 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy the solution is custom games+dedicated bungie side pvp servers+ranked playlists.  Everyone wins with that scenario (more)
731440758016901122 2016-05-14 11:07:20 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy that just drives people away from the game.  However, nor should anyone have to endure lag teleporters.. The solution is (more)
731440374225506304 2016-05-14 11:05:49 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy i'm going to disagree.  Destiny still has new players or people who just aren't good at PVP.  This pool should not be w/ top 5%
731291753404334080 2016-05-13 01:15:15 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean i got one w/ decent roll... Seems no better than haakons or righteous 7.  Hope u get it though
731290742522544128 2016-05-13 01:11:14 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 something seems to be up with sticky grenades since u guys made this adjustment... As in, they pass right through opponents in pvp
731228084154859522 2016-05-13 21:02:15 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot noooo!!! Please no!!!
731227754889400320 2016-05-13 21:00:56 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MorninAfterKill that'll teach that phone not to piss you off!
731226250312884224 2016-05-13 20:54:58 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HeyFitzy @GeorgeSwift_UK hmmm i think a ton of people are playing right now, just POE, not crucible.  Give it time, people will come back

730360045490294788 2016-05-11 11:32:58 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 @DestinyNews_net also noticed a proximity issue with ammo crates that is harder to describe.  Keep an eye on it? #bungie

730359214019850240 2016-05-11 11:29:40 UTC <PalmettoVIP> Noticed some weird bugs with grenade hit detection this am, related to the hit detection patch?  @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 @DestinyNews_net
729420090156961792 2016-05-08 21:17:56 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 #bungie #destinythegame   Seems like ammo drop rates in PVE are bugged, dropping less since April rebalance. @BungieHelp
729417927011766272 2016-05-08 21:09:20 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @kathryn_dennis Happy Mom's day!  Loving Southern Charm.  Hope y'all do a season 3
729038369880190977 2016-05-07 20:01:06 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny nice job Belle!! Did u have fun?
729036937105911809 2016-05-07 19:55:25 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyReddit i'm thinking the 'report for bad connection' button does nothing.  Probably a placebo to make u feel like you have control
728545966144552961 2016-05-06 11:24:28 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG and no cigars

717808965334249472 2016-04-06 20:19:28 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 umm the firebolt issue needs to be looked at again please.  And preferably now... Not another 4 months.
717805850207850497 2016-04-06 20:07:05 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MorninAfterKill bungie has always treated them as their favorite.  Why are you surprised?
717804536354746370 2016-04-06 20:01:52 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @AutumnaticYT #teamrey ?
717673750393724929 2016-04-06 11:22:10 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @Destinyinfos @MesaSean @Destinykdub @MarkTurc @Be11eBunny @InsideDestiny that is a disappointing 'fix.'  Length of radiance was not OP..
717672823196663809 2016-04-06 11:18:29 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Destinyinfos as to your question on hunters.. I think bladedancer could use a little buff...w/ swords in game, they don't feel powerful now
717490793347416069 2016-04-05 23:15:10 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @InsideDestiny London, Chicago, New Orleans..,how about 'The ruins of Cairo?'
717489964703948800 2016-04-05 23:11:52 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Gothalion and bacon.  More bacon.
717489752098865152 2016-04-05 23:11:01 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @Destinyinfos @MesaSean @Destinykdub @MarkTurc @Be11eBunny @InsideDestiny Bungie been hinting since the Sunbreaker nerf 'warlocks are next'
717489412477698048 2016-04-05 23:09:40 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @MesaSean @Destinykdub @MarkTurc @Be11eBunny @InsideDestiny  i agree. Think voidwalker gets buff to compensate? Like how they did Strikers?
717473187378946048 2016-04-05 22:05:12 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @Destinykdub @MarkTurc @Be11eBunny @InsideDestiny @MesaSean your predictions for the rebalancing twitch stream?  Warlock nerf, fusion buff
716058706883047424 2016-04-01 00:24:34 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG i like that you actually showed us the faction loot table, very cool!  Enjoying the twitch streams too
715960352379387904 2016-04-01 17:53:44 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 do you think we could get a Twitch interview with the new CEO?
714976127694028800 2016-03-29 00:42:47 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean Holy Engrams Batman!
714904187054723076 2016-03-29 19:56:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean got 35 saved... How about you?
714578625086038021 2016-03-28 22:23:15 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Gothalion good thing Destiny will be releasing some updated content in a few weeks...

713509814803042308 2016-03-25 23:36:10 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyTheGame really looking forward to April 12, everything looks really good!
713122186177937408 2016-03-24 21:55:53 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @sharkeatsman are you really buffing fusion rifles in April?!?!  #bungie #destinythegame
712824486186328065 2016-03-23 02:12:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG @Bungie awesome twitch show today, the new content looks amazing!  Cant wait to play
712756039817498624 2016-03-23 21:40:56 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @GuardiansofD stoked! Almost exactly what i hoped for
710958644821680130 2016-03-18 22:38:44 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG next iron banner will be after the April content drop correct?  (Seems logical w/ pending light level increase)  @Bungie
710865827768221696 2016-03-18 16:29:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @Destinykdub @MesaSean @InsideDestiny @Be11eBunny @PopeBear @MarkTurc yeah... Probably..Subclass would have been great but ill take a shader
710789442445910016 2016-03-18 11:26:23 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @MesaSean @InsideDestiny @Be11eBunny @PopeBear @MarkTurc @Destinykdub so what do you all think? That a taken shader or a taken subclass?
710789013049888768 2016-03-18 11:24:41 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Anamj23 hope so!  The commercials look good
710631496395128832 2016-03-17 00:58:46 UTC <PalmettoVIP> Is @BenAffleck really going to be playing Darth Vader in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron?
710428318764572672 2016-03-17 11:31:24 UTC <PalmettoVIP> Is Ben Affleck really the new Spiderman?  #benaffleck
710149590356516864 2016-03-16 17:03:50 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @sharkeatsman why did you turn shotguns into a melee weapon?
710075399410208769 2016-03-16 12:09:02 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Anamj23 no, making a joke because Ben replaced Christian Bale as Batman.  Hello from US by the way
710066035781668864 2016-03-16 11:31:49 UTC <PalmettoVIP> Rumor has it that Ben Affleck is playing both Magneto AND Professor Xavier..,
710065716263821312 2016-03-16 11:30:33 UTC <PalmettoVIP> I heard Ben Affleck is going to be the new Indiana Jones...
710065548189683712 2016-03-16 11:29:53 UTC <PalmettoVIP> Sooo Ben Affleck is going to play the young Han Solo?
709337596057526272 2016-03-14 11:17:16 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieInformer needs a way to do 'not available' so friends know you are not ignoring them, just busy.  Most annoying feature of PS
708646682754424832 2016-03-12 13:31:49 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @InsideDestiny @GuardiansofD @Be11eBunny @MesaSean @Destinykdub @MarkTurc Any chance u can get my fave voice @actor_morla on for interview??
708399196831932417 2016-03-11 21:08:24 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Holtzmann_PD @PopeBear @TheBriarRabbit if Pirates of the Caribbean smells like wet musty leather what does red shirt retail smell like?
708272817905729541 2016-03-11 12:46:13 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Bungie @Cozmo23 @actor_morla I really enjoyed 'The Sounds of Destiny' vidoc.  Thanks Deej!
707539184047824898 2016-03-09 12:11:01 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Polygon The Division's trolling and launch bugs= 0 fun. How do you not realize, w/ 2 betas that inability to pass=huge problem?
707538044560269312 2016-03-09 12:06:29 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @SuperBlueBadger @InsideDestiny queing to talk to an NPC?  Fun factor just went down about 50 pts
707179728088768512 2016-03-08 12:22:40 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @GuardiansofD @MesaSean @MarkTurc @Be11eBunny @InsideDestiny @Destinykdub will you guys be starting an 'Agents of Division' podcast?
707178949504270336 2016-03-08 12:19:34 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MorninAfterKill is the final release a LOT better than the beta?  The beta was fun but waiting to see if this has staying power?
707178275353845760 2016-03-08 12:16:54 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @gamespot seriously worried that this game is going to never get finished now...maybe they should change the name to Mass Exodus. 
706989883768905729 2016-03-07 23:48:18 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MassEffect_News should we be worried that another senior team member announced their exit??
706986287404818432 2016-03-07 23:34:00 UTC <PalmettoVIP> I'm starting to get worried that Mass Effect should be renamed 'Mass Exodus'.  What is going down @bioware !?!? #bioware #masseffect
706815518796353541 2016-03-07 12:15:26 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @sharkeatsman is it true that fusion rifles are getting a big buff in late April??  The elves are whispering!!  #destinythegame #bungie
706483229113622528 2016-03-06 14:15:02 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @GuardiansofD @DestinyNews_net Cozmo  please say we are getting more vault space w/ April DLC??? At least current gen?
706143750205083649 2016-03-05 15:46:04 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 i'm sure you already heard this 10,000X but i really hope we get some more SRL this summer!
705876127202545664 2016-03-04 22:02:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 do u guys get to read all of the tweets at you? Or do you have to skim and check random ones?
705726706691219457 2016-03-04 12:08:53 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK my connections have been very good for crucible..are you still getting matched with red bars that often??
705564886655438848 2016-03-03 01:25:52 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie i enjoyed watching it. Looking forward to more
705514172281446401 2016-03-03 22:04:21 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Bungie i really enjoyed the ride along.  Hope you turned off chat like the rest of us.  Looking forward to the next one. Thanks
704791602091462656 2016-03-01 22:13:06 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DamageRef why are you punishing green bars?  Are you wearing special UV sunglasses again?
704444105368145920 2016-02-29 23:12:17 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 that last nerf pretty much ruined it.  #blameNewski
704442205054836737 2016-02-29 23:04:44 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MorninAfterKill @RsziTweets @DeeJ_BNG Sorry Jay, Bungie loved Warlocks more than any other. #favoredSon
704080851672416256 2016-02-28 23:08:50 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny @MesaSean @PopeBear My streak of bad RNG finally broke!  Just landed the 'Thoughtcrime'. You still love me after all @Bungie
703732484001951744 2016-02-27 00:04:33 UTC <PalmettoVIP> Is at Cirque Du Soleil 3rd row. #Toruk #Avatar
703621666673393669 2016-02-27 16:44:12 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PopeBear @MesaSean @Be11eBunny Last 20 games my IB RNG has gone done the toilet! Why does @Bungie hate me???  #destinythegame #frustrating
703195739380391936 2016-02-26 12:31:43 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @LaurenCohan any chance you will be getting called back to Bungie studios for some more lines for 'Exo Stranger?'  (Hint:  please say yes!)
703193796285239296 2016-02-26 12:24:00 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny ghost shell origami
703193045152432128 2016-02-26 12:21:01 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PopeBear @Cozmo23 and for the record Pope, i agree with you 95% of the time, and i love when you tantrum.  Don't you change a thing.
703192740545355776 2016-02-26 12:19:48 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PopeBear @Cozmo23 rather than nerf it, why not bring make some weapons more competitive.  Nerf is not the solution to all destiny problems.
702962922528612352 2016-02-25 21:06:35 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean is it gonna be burn me up? Because i don't wanna be sealed up for good ya know?  I will wear all my shoes & glasses while watching
702889312539557888 2016-02-25 16:14:05 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean Sean is it 'fast handling/fast firing' type?  I prefer that for the few times i snipe
702831087500845057 2016-02-25 12:22:43 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @Bungie @DeeJ_BNG day 2 IB review.  Drops are so much better.  Did you change something?  Lag is way down (for me).  Dmg ref buggy
702470555652464642 2016-02-24 12:30:06 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @BungieHelp @DeeJ_BNG the dmg referee is buggy, causing green bar players in 'all green bar' games to be unable to dmg.  Not good.
702468244700045317 2016-02-24 12:20:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @InsideDestiny Byf, to be fair.. If it weren't for nice people like you, i wouldn't even know that Destiny had rich lore.
702466612604092416 2016-02-24 12:14:26 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean Clash is so boring because it is one dimensional.  'Kill all the bad guys.'   I would like to see zone control IB someday.
702466155236225024 2016-02-24 12:12:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @clmazin you make him sound selfish Craig? 
702106863094132736 2016-02-23 12:24:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean Sean do you think they will add Bwings and Ywings at some point?  I loved flying bwings in the old 'Xwing' game
702105002802806786 2016-02-23 12:17:31 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MorninAfterKill yah Jay!  Logged in this AM thinking it would be there... Guess they tied it to the 'Iron Banner Live' button?
701887086266290176 2016-02-22 21:51:36 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MisterScorps i'm worried how clash will play this time.. But i don't care for clash anyway.  Too one dimensional. 'Just kill the bad guys'
701770541783457792 2016-02-22 14:08:30 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MisterScorps @MesaSean on the plus side, if someone is not in 'super mode' or using heavy, we are getting more chances at 'payback' medals
701744621068529664 2016-02-22 12:25:30 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG @Bungie @BungieHelp something is up w/ bullet hit detection.  I'm green bar, so is enemy.  They are often immune to dmg.
701742692787740672 2016-02-22 12:17:50 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Trent_Tracker @MesaSean trent ideally players could *choose* if they want to prioritize sb or cb.  Maybe in Destiny 2?
701742306358075392 2016-02-22 12:16:18 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MisterScorps @MesaSean Scorps i noticing spawn problems too!  Spawning into a back of enemy players is not fun
701742002120085504 2016-02-22 12:15:05 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean Sean are you noticing that people are green bar and somehow immune to bullets?  I saw this 4-5x this weekend but didn't save vid
701553795797540864 2016-02-21 23:47:13 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean if it makes u feel better my KD is down by 0.25 since the change back to connection based.. Less lag glitching though..
701409578676830208 2016-02-21 14:14:09 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @sharkeatsman yes, playing The Division reminded me that shotguns were supposed to be fun.
701409248488587265 2016-02-21 14:12:51 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @InsideDestiny we love you too Byf!
700913017517637633 2016-02-19 05:21:00 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean @TheDivisionGame  really enjoyed my first taste of the Division tonight. I'd almost forgot that shotguns were *supposed* to be fun
700828857822277635 2016-02-19 23:46:35 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG *JOKE POST*. Will IB drops and guaranteed rewards be better for next week's IB?  Not a joke post...
700828356779048960 2016-02-19 23:44:35 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny @WizardWorld though Amanda Holliday would be my second recommendation.  She rocks.
700827822663843840 2016-02-19 23:42:28 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny @WizardWorld Belle i told you;  Luna Lovegood!
700821184452149248 2016-02-19 23:16:05 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyNews_net @DestinyReddit  Do you think it is safe to assume that @Bungie has fixed the bug that is caused bad drop rates in IB?
700647882165080065 2016-02-19 11:47:27 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @Bungie @DeeJ_BNG Are we getting new guaranteed rank 3 & 5 packages for Iron Banner or just arti & shell+random ?
700647472163467265 2016-02-19 11:45:49 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG @Bungie @BungieHelp Very excited about Iron Banner, but were you guys able to fix the broken drop rate?
700392147225309184 2016-02-18 18:51:15 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @FuzeSkater @tripleWRECK @DarrenSJr but i think in D2 we will have more 'custom' options.  Both sides have a valid argument. Sb or cb..
700391864013295616 2016-02-18 18:50:07 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @FuzeSkater @tripleWRECK @DarrenSJr   Not all playlists, so.. Not really a 'choice.'   We just gotta make do for now and accept compromise
700292182104735744 2016-02-18 12:14:01 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK @DarrenSJr  not yet though, not yet... Hopefully in D2
700292013753765888 2016-02-18 12:13:21 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK @DarrenSJr   Ari, we could also dream of a playlist where players could *choose* whether they want sb or connection prioritized
699972325031157764 2016-02-17 15:03:01 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean dislike!
699928775270731777 2016-02-17 12:09:58 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @LeifJohansen Enjoyed your interview with @DestinyNews_net   Thanks for doing that.
699568291220688896 2016-02-16 12:17:32 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @DestinyTheGame @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG @thislukesmith @knowsworthy congrats on bringing Schlerf on board!  Very excited to read this!!
699311460015595521 2016-02-15 19:16:59 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 i liked having emotes as a possible prize in CD.  Good idea!  Always love a good shader too.  #feedback #bungie
699283629835427840 2016-02-15 17:26:24 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean @TheTrueVanguard your getting good at it Sean!  Just don't forget to be kind to us shotgunners.  We need love too. 
698921516914896896 2016-02-14 17:27:29 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK this is true.  There is much to be fixed, and yet the 1PS 'feel' of Destiny gameplay can not be surpassed.  @DeeJ_BNG @Bungie
698921060184563712 2016-02-14 17:25:40 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny i agree.  Freelance is the best addition to PVP in a loooong time.  Ty @DeeJ_BNG @Bungie
698920222615564288 2016-02-14 17:22:21 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @clmazin @popcornpicks @tedcruz   'Keep your *friends* close?'  
698715217195356161 2016-02-13 03:47:43 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23   After the guaranteed 320 shell was announced, people started playing again and CD became fun.  Thank you!!!
698489954901606400 2016-02-13 12:52:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyTheGame but if Crim Dbls is done next year, pls add matchmaking.  No reason it couldn't have had it
698489721396264960 2016-02-13 12:51:41 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyTheGame actually i would like to chng previous comment.  The guaranteed 320 ghost is a move in the right direction!
698296413478895616 2016-02-12 00:03:33 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyTheGame terrible rewards and next time should include matchmaking.  The tower looks great though.
697032170997686273 2016-02-09 12:19:54 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie and your including Freelance Crimson Doubles?!?!? .  (Had to try)
696714516013445120 2016-02-08 15:17:39 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @lars_bakken @LeifJohansen @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 Freelance PvP is a great idea!  How about adding it to Crimson Doubles?
695762671715614720 2016-02-05 00:15:22 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean howz about you have Frank Rizzo make an appearance on Guardian Radio?  'Get me Brett Ware i say!'
695742554269163521 2016-02-05 22:55:25 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @sharkeatsman are you ever going to allow suros regime to be good again?  In 1 v 1 battle with 1st shot fired simultaneous, it loses a lot
695588185003442177 2016-02-05 12:42:01 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @InsideDestiny @RRRoycee she's a beautiful ship!
695436230121512960 2016-02-04 02:38:12 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG best update in awhile!  Ty for the welcome changes in PVP!!
695321081352187905 2016-02-04 19:00:38 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MTashed are u referring to the 'how dare you take down servers and fix the things we have asked you to fix?!?!' Madness?
695283840919691264 2016-02-04 16:32:40 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Destinykdub ok so now i am curious... Can u show us some pics of the gaming closet?
695268693417267200 2016-02-04 15:32:28 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @TheBriarRabbit are u taking questions for next podcast? If so:  Why does Patrick always sound sad?  Did red shirt retail steal his soul?
695219101916987392 2016-02-04 12:15:25 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyReddit yes.  Got Thunderlord from a hive thrall in year 1.  Only once though in over 700 hours.
695217911741296640 2016-02-04 12:10:41 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 defender next.  Sunbreaker was good until @sharkeatsman nerfed it.
694881238222512128 2016-02-03 13:52:52 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PopeBear   Pope's RNG taunting of Patrick had me laughing all the way to work. Also more 'stories from retail hell' pls  @DestinyNews_net
694649338379780097 2016-02-02 22:31:22 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 i assure you Cozmo, that is no ordinary rodent.  Your mockery is ill advised.
694648982790901761 2016-02-02 22:29:58 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny oh you so need to do a Luna Lovegood cosplay while it is blonde!
694648271420166147 2016-02-02 22:27:08 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @lars_bakken @Bungie well that's good news.  Played control this am and had someone glitch through a sword, grenade, then wall.
694647689133318145 2016-02-02 22:24:49 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny karate and reading 'The Force Awakens'
694212040475410433 2016-02-01 17:33:42 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @SportPsychNYLI @CrucibleRadio @Bones_CR  previously was hawksaw, any shotgun... Prior to that hand cannons and shotgun.  Meta always nerfed
694211511506595841 2016-02-01 17:31:36 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @SportPsychNYLI @CrucibleRadio @Bones_CR My favorite loadout has had to change w/ repeated nerfs.. Currently Hardlight, strongbow, sword
693937533076504578 2016-01-31 23:22:55 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyNews_net broken again?  Really disappointing that @Bungie doesn't ever change the rank 3 & 5 guaranteed rewards.  #listening
693936562791452672 2016-01-31 23:19:03 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyNews_net @CrucibleRadio @GuardiansofD @Bungie @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23  Isn't it time for the rank 3 & 5 rewards to change? #dissapointed
693458842823303170 2016-01-30 15:40:46 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean it's always whaaa 'we need clean water'. And 'waaaah please stop the raiders.'  Bunch of ingrates.
693458459392675841 2016-01-30 15:39:15 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean thanks Sean, didn't know this.  Been rifts and fallout all week?  My fallout villages are so demanding and ungrateful
693248648604467200 2016-01-29 01:45:32 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieInformer @_mantis_ @LeifJohansen @lars_bakken @DeeJ_BNG if standard rules, why no match making?
693248173507223552 2016-01-29 01:43:39 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @burgesscdb ... And the ability to have a friend who plays at the exact same times as you...
693245986467139584 2016-01-29 01:34:57 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean i wish crimson days would have matchmaking.  But hopefully also has something coming for pve @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23
693218612237197312 2016-01-29 23:46:11 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @ballou_david @DestinyTheGame precisely, you have to go do the work that the game could easily do for you. Way to marginalize @LeifJohansen
693217735527026688 2016-01-29 23:42:42 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyTheGame or.. You could make life easier on your fans and add match making into the game mode
693217344731111426 2016-01-29 23:41:08 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @NathanFillion Bungie?  Just kidding, they are trying to fix their mistakes
693211135961477120 2016-01-29 23:16:28 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @LeifJohansen you should really allow matchmaking for the crimson dbls PVP.  Many players have odd schedules.  Spending 30m LFG isn't fun.
693049266001027072 2016-01-29 12:33:15 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @chefandi you had me at 'bacon' Chef Andi...you had me at bacon..,
693048647668334592 2016-01-29 12:30:48 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @CrucibleRadio yes, how do i overcome the inevitable 'tilt' i get when my favorite loadout is reduced to nerf balls and flowers by Newski
693048276875120640 2016-01-29 12:29:20 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @lars_bakken IB connections still feeling good.  Ty!
693047614250586112 2016-01-29 12:26:42 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Professorbroman some of the combat i've seen looks painfully slow and full of bullet sponges.. Does it feel better when playing?
692834681490833408 2016-01-28 22:20:34 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Gothalion can someone please get Deej an intern and another keyboard?  
692822987582607360 2016-01-28 21:34:06 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG roger that.  Look forward to it
692810581355659266 2016-01-28 20:44:49 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG   Is Bungie coming to Pax South?
692810328384638976 2016-01-28 20:43:48 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @InsideDestiny. Dang Byf, did you wreck him in crucible or something?
692691695058718720 2016-01-28 12:52:24 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @AutumnaticYT look up?  We Titan no look up.  Titan smash squishy hunters.  Where beer at?
692690596729884672 2016-01-28 12:48:02 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @GuardiansofD @Be11eBunny @MarkTurc @InsideDestiny  Guardian Radio; i think connections are better now & i am enjoying rift as solo. Agree?
692689954829422594 2016-01-28 12:45:29 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Cozmo23 @DeeJ_BNG   Day 3 of IB Rifts (as a solo).  I had my doubts, but actually loving it.  Connection seems better to.  Thank you.
692689618106458112 2016-01-28 12:44:09 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @MesaSean Bungie, the connections do seem better, not perfect but i don't expect that.  Also, playing Rifts as solo hasn't been bad
692509035459973125 2016-01-27 00:46:34 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG few matches in and so far running better.
692508857030041602 2016-01-27 00:45:52 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Bungie @Cozmo23 i was worried, but i am enjoying IB rifts a LOT.  And i go in as a solo
692491132572409856 2016-01-27 23:35:26 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG haven't got on today yet, but plan to game soon.  Will definitely let u know if it seems better
692490066258698244 2016-01-27 23:31:12 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PopeBear @DestinyTheGame @Bungie and yes, we still love you Bungie, and we love the world you created
692485562981314561 2016-01-27 23:13:18 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @PopeBear @DestinyTheGame @Bungie I agree with Popebear, transparency is kind of important in an industry that relies on customer reviews..
692484556524503040 2016-01-27 23:09:18 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @AutumnaticYT thanks Autumnatic!
692319028375875584 2016-01-27 12:11:33 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean if more of Destiny is gonna be that way, we HAVE to have in game lobby and chat.  Game time is precious, spendng 30m LFG isn't fun
692318551584174081 2016-01-27 12:09:40 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean IB should not be a game mode that requires a pre made team to be competitive.  We already need that 4 Trials, POE hard & all raids
692318124339773441 2016-01-27 12:07:58 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean i played solo last night and won more than lost.. But this am went solo vs 6 sweaties and was so frustrated.  (More)
692307650730680325 2016-01-27 11:26:21 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny i was just saying last night that IB Rifts feels like my Guardian is in the Hunger Games and running for the Cornucopia
692190447054249988 2016-01-26 03:40:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG definitely had some latency issues, but overall i liked IB Rifts, and was pleasantly surprised as a solo
692148239886372865 2016-01-26 00:52:54 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG there is truth in what you say.  So how do we improve communication on both sides?
692147341323796481 2016-01-26 00:49:20 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean glad she is coming home.  Keeping the prayers coming
691597791475470337 2016-01-25 12:25:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @InsideDestiny i would be even more concerned if they ninja nerf the drop rate at the same time as introducing this
691596139632685057 2016-01-25 12:19:03 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @Destiny_Drops @Angel_Eyes66 @InsideDestiny got a link?  Cant find it
691595637863882752 2016-01-25 12:17:03 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean you and your love have my prayers Sean!
691595292131598336 2016-01-25 12:15:41 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyNews_net i like the live events, but they are no replacement for expansion packs.  Do you think Bungie just needs to hire more?
691594691113017344 2016-01-25 12:13:18 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @InsideDestiny i hope you at least give it a glance, that's what i intend to do.  I had a lot of doubts about Destiny in the beginning...
691253668935516160 2016-01-24 13:38:12 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean it's funny, i don't like the 'feel' of mida.. I prefer CQC.  But numbers don't lie, the few times i used it, my KD quadrupled 
691252012193857536 2016-01-24 13:31:37 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny #4
690726146976120832 2016-01-22 02:42:01 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @LadyShaxx that shotgun was our last hope.  No.  There is another.
690725880008708096 2016-01-22 02:40:57 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Professorbroman best game you will ever play
690658057727131649 2016-01-22 22:11:27 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @dps2002 hope you're right...but i have a feeling this will be the first Rift experience for many.  Some people only play crucible for IB
690657620840046592 2016-01-22 22:09:43 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @HellsKitchenFOX @chefandi @FOXTV The smorgity smorg is RAW!
690656180511870976 2016-01-22 22:03:59 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @dps2002 @DeeJ_BNG surely they fixed this ? People have been asking that pre made teams only be matched with likewise since last IB
690635613343780865 2016-01-22 20:42:16 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG sure, if u have a premade sweaty fireteam it's a blast
690566515905695745 2016-01-22 16:07:42 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BrotherVance @RickZumbero bet they use a map that everyone hates like skyshock, first light, or cathedral
690546825070317569 2016-01-22 14:49:27 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @insidedestiny @InsideDestiny yah looking forward to your thoughts on this byf
690525378620841984 2016-01-22 13:24:14 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @actor_morla is Eris bringing a date to Crimson Days?
690512118542680064 2016-01-22 12:31:32 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23 @thislukesmith @Bungie you are changing the rank 3 & 5 guaranteed rewards for IB right?  We have tons of 310 ghost shells
690511260300001280 2016-01-22 12:28:08 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Be11eBunny i want to know if i can have Amanda Holliday for my crimson doubles fighting partner?!?!
690511048139476993 2016-01-22 12:27:17 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean they are great at 'complex hidden mathematical formulas,' so no reason it couldn't check for connection first, then skill?
690510127699464193 2016-01-22 12:23:38 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieInformer crest of alpha screwy
690509724379418624 2016-01-22 12:22:01 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MorninAfterKill i hope so brother Jay
690509050774163456 2016-01-22 12:19:21 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieInformer i needed those Titan legs!  Nice
690508754123673601 2016-01-22 12:18:10 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @MesaSean Sean:  if IB Rifts matches sweaty premade fireteams with 6 solos... And lag connections aren't fixed..?  How bad could it get?
690507835654959104 2016-01-22 12:14:31 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @tripleWRECK If the lag based matchmaking is not fixed, and premade teams continue to get matched w/ 6 solos... Well this could end badly..
690304088588816385 2016-01-21 22:44:54 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @DestinyTheGame @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23  So for IB rift you are only going to match premade fireteams w/ other premade teams riiiiiiight?
690303424714375168 2016-01-21 22:42:16 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @teft @Bungie what u don't think that playing Rift with a disappearing runner will be fun?  Where is your sense of adventure Tefty?!?!
690292656472211456 2016-01-21 21:59:28 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @Bungie @DestinyTheGame @GuardiansofD @CrucibleRadio @DestinyNews_net  will Crimson Doubles have match making?? @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23

690219705429266432 2016-01-21 17:09:36 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @CrucibleRadio what is it going to take from the community to get the sandbox team to actually listen to feedback about fusion rifles?
690199558882775041 2016-01-21 15:49:32 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23  F5. F5. F5. F5. F5. F5
689970766381748225 2016-01-20 00:40:24 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @DestinyNews_net it was a good read, keep em coming!
689970214470094851 2016-01-20 00:38:12 UTC <PalmettoVIP> @BungieInformer i expect to be told that the Festival of the Dawn is coming and they don't have time to explain..@Bungie @DeeJ_BNG @Cozmo23
689950441128513538 2016-01-20 23:19:38 UTC <PalmettoVIP> Apparently the real reason R2D2 went dormant was that shockwave had caused a crash.... Again
