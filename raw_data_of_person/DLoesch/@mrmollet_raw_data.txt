902904494824071168 2017-08-30 14:43:01 UTC <mrmollet> @AaronNagler It's pretty simple:  If he was still good, the Browns wouldn't have cut him or they could've swung a deal for him.  This isn't complicated
900400394970509315 2017-08-23 16:52:37 UTC <mrmollet> @AaronNagler Why not just call him Bob Lee.  Like the Outside the Lines Bob Ley.  Nobody would've ever known!

858212881694953473 2017-04-28 06:54:30 UTC <mrmollet> @AaronNagler @TravelinGabe_ RB is not a need.  Just keep drafting defense.  Throw enough mud at the wall, eventually some of it will stick.
854370448620040192 2017-04-18 16:26:03 UTC <mrmollet> @JuMosq @AaronNagler What about Pat Elflein from Ohio State?  I think he has Ted Thompson pick all over him.
849118788368949249 2017-04-03 04:37:49 UTC <mrmollet> @ByAndrewWagner Agreed.  One perk of working second shift- I get to watch a lot of west coast baseball.  Love it when the Brewers go west.

828440326687846400 2017-02-05 03:09:00 UTC <mrmollet> @ESPNStatsInfo James White has to be close to some kind of record for receptions by a RB in a Super Bowl.  Can you check on that?
828139635637383168 2017-02-04 07:14:09 UTC <mrmollet> @ByAndrewWagner People are so quick to dismiss Bledsoe because of Brady taking over for him, but he was actually a really good quarterback

815794170233241600 2017-01-01 05:37:41 UTC <mrmollet> @AaronNagler the Rodgers presser was awesome.  Full of nuggets of info and subtle jabs.
815774217853669376 2017-01-01 04:18:24 UTC <mrmollet> @AaronNagler If Jim Bob Cooter is such a great OC, why does his offense only have 3 points in the 2nd half against a depleted GB secondary?
815773301926723585 2017-01-01 04:14:46 UTC <mrmollet> @adamrank Bears fan.

812155092308754432 2016-12-22 04:37:17 UTC <mrmollet> @ByRyanWood I forgot to ask you.  What's the Packers' record up to when Callahan is on the roster?
812152454720745472 2016-12-22 04:26:48 UTC <mrmollet> That was a beautiful tackle by Collins.
812138963733463040 2016-12-22 03:33:12 UTC <mrmollet> @AaronNagler Your thoughts on Doug Pederson's offensive style?  Many similarities to Holmgren?
812034829403439104 2016-12-22 20:39:24 UTC <mrmollet> @Gil_Brandt nicely done @itsCrab!  What's your secret?

799891184848109568 2016-11-19 08:24:54 UTC <mrmollet> @ProFootballTalk Does Aaron Rodgers approve?  Will this cause an implosion within the locker room?
787896041148297217 2016-10-16 06:00:29 UTC <mrmollet> @jasonjwilde was outstanding in coach McCarthy's presser tonight.  Well done Jason.  U asked really good questions and pressed a bit
787873270120914944 2016-10-16 04:30:00 UTC <mrmollet> @AaronNagler the facebook live feed wasn't great tonight. I forgive you.  Looking forward to your thoughts and insights throughout the week.
787871595830194176 2016-10-16 04:23:21 UTC <mrmollet> @AaronNagler @PekJorkins All done?  Are we done here?
787867100224172033 2016-10-16 04:05:29 UTC <mrmollet> @AaronNagler @PekJorkins Gunter is an undrafted FA.  Carroll was a 1st round pick.  Expectations are totally different
787865928889278465 2016-10-16 04:00:49 UTC <mrmollet> @AaronNagler I have to believe that he's a better option than trying to convert Herb Waters into a cornerback.
787865178930946048 2016-10-16 03:57:51 UTC <mrmollet> @AaronNagler @PekJorkins And Sam Shields began as an undrafted rookie FA and Randall converted from college safety to CB.
787863511703572480 2016-10-16 03:51:13 UTC <mrmollet> @AaronNagler @PekJorkins You're right.  He's a scrub.  We should contact Mark Murphy to make you GM and head coach.
787860160194629632 2016-10-16 03:37:54 UTC <mrmollet> your thoughts @AaronNagler?
787859359539703808 2016-10-16 03:34:43 UTC <mrmollet> @PGPackersNews @helluvadave What a terrible Super Bowl winning coach. They are so easy to come by.  I wish you were the GM.

777755326678310912 2016-09-18 06:24:54 UTC <mrmollet> @AaronNagler In my mind, M.M. and Rodgers need to have a come to Jesus meeting.  We have a S.B. defense.  Now they need to get it together
777751382723997698 2016-09-18 06:09:14 UTC <mrmollet> @AaronNagler I really think Randall will be a #1 corner someday, but he's not quite there yet. We'll miss Sam if he's out for awhile
777749848330084352 2016-09-18 06:03:08 UTC <mrmollet> @AaronNagler @AJPhenomenal1 I'm really happy that I'm not the only person with this question floating in my mind
