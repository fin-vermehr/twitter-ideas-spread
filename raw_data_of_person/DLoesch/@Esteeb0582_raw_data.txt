969771529260027904 2018-03-02 03:08:44 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TruthFeedNews @therealcornett @brianstelter we are not listening anymore.  Cause you lie to us.  Even you who I use to trust.
969770253767946240 2018-03-02 03:03:40 UTC <Esteeb0582> @sangerkatz @gridiron_guru67 Haha they dont do that then the chart will show that there isnt really a thing any gun law will do to help.
969760279763460096 2018-03-02 02:24:02 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TuckerCarlson @notbuyingthat54 @DevinNunes Please help us out.  I work very hard to live here and I cant use my parks.  Or even walk some streets with my daughters.  It is crazy.  #takeCAback
969759951651356672 2018-03-02 02:22:44 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JoinTravisAllen @notbuyingthat54 #votetravisallen I know it is raining a bit tonight but we have to show up.  State needs to see we are here.pic.twitter.com/LC44zFtGdv
969630167256608768 2018-03-02 17:47:01 UTC <Esteeb0582> Just been trying to figure out to make it to that next level.  Keep on working hard is all I know how to do.  #FridayFeeling
968968516102602752 2018-02-28 21:57:51 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JasonBondPicks @Taylor8xeno8 Well it is not normal to see people being held accountable for doing a bad job either in government.
968726047100424192 2018-02-27 05:54:22 UTC <Esteeb0582> @notbuyingthat54 @marklevinshow Ya I started it and was impressed.  I had to finish it.
968703001392107520 2018-02-27 04:22:47 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @SuzanneOnly Please do this we are trying to fix this state also.
968702220081377280 2018-02-27 04:19:41 UTC <Esteeb0582> @President1Trump Sorry CA is in a rough place but some of us are fighting back.
968322691764760578 2018-02-26 03:11:34 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter Ya I wanted a blue check to see if people might answer me more.  But seems a normal person cant get one.
968186493528244225 2018-02-26 18:10:22 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish I think your wrong.  GP investing was ending.  With out the first FISA it would have ended.  Yes I hear your point on the next ones so the Page wire had to be doing something.  But if that is true why is Page not charged?  It seems more like they got dirt on others.  Dirty game
967879328091394048 2018-02-25 21:49:48 UTC <Esteeb0582> California Governors Race: State Assemblyman Travis Allen https://youtu.be/ACka4PAikzc via @YouTube #votetravisallen
967877165768359936 2018-02-25 21:41:13 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter you looked weak allowing them to say NRA own people they are not even close to a top donor.  So many give millions more.
967876819620806656 2018-02-25 21:39:50 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JuddApatow Lol the younger generations created tinder and you think they care about this?  Only reason young kids would be aware of that is if the parents explained it to them.
967875370673258496 2018-02-25 21:34:05 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter Can you share more info on your poll?  CNN was not close on get Trump numbers right in election.  So why should we believe these ones? #CNNisFakeNews
967874294964396032 2018-02-25 21:29:48 UTC <Esteeb0582> @notbuyingthat54 any chance your fans might want to help our Travis Allen.  I know people laugh sometimes at Dems losing in CA but we are trying. He needs money to get in the racehttps://secure.campaignsolutions.com/allen/takebackcalif/?InitiativeKey=SKRR3OZXROAF #votetravisallen
967872133782151168 2018-02-25 21:21:13 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ThomasWictor Hello thanks for the threads it is always fun to read them.  Do you think there is a chance for new leadership in CA?  I am trying to help Travis Allen.  Do you follow it at all? #votetravisallen
967871039987376128 2018-02-25 21:16:52 UTC <Esteeb0582> @FareedZakaria good show today.  Lived in CA my whole like LA leadership is crazy.  The homeless issues are crazy.  We cant use our parks without fear of Drug Needles and trash. Talk to Travis he can save our state. #votetravisallen
967483469000458241 2018-02-24 19:36:48 UTC <Esteeb0582> @DonaldJTrumpJr I know we are a log shot but if you have time can you take a look at Travis Allen for Governor of CA he will work with @POTUS
967076626814066688 2018-02-23 16:40:09 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TrueTradingGrp Anyone wondering they are doing on the 27th the link says.
967076074512265216 2018-02-23 16:37:58 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TrueTradingGrp Ya really if you have a time machine to get us there your trade group must be good.
967060402021400577 2018-02-23 15:35:41 UTC <Esteeb0582> @billhandelshow They dont want to let you ban any gun thinking it will solve the problem. Next shooter will just use different gun so now a new ban and so on.  That is why they fight the first one so hard.
966851406199050240 2018-02-22 01:45:13 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RobinhoodApp Darn I didnt get the message yet.
966847931566325760 2018-02-22 01:31:24 UTC <Esteeb0582> @themouthmatusow Mike I had many teachers in high school that where former military.  Or owned guns and told us about them.  I wouldnt mind if the right ones could have it in a lock box.
966847301363712000 2018-02-22 01:28:54 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RealDonLopez You know I feel the same way.  But I wonder if it is a little different now.  Cause game are a lot more violent and they start playing them younger.  When I was young I played duck hunt.  They play COD.
966738117645316096 2018-02-22 18:15:03 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SenWhitehouse @JimInhofe @PressSec @Kenwhite4444 @donna_1004 Donna can you look up that law and see if it would have applied to any of these shooters?  Cause I know it wouldnt have stopped the resent one cause he was not seeing a doctor that diagnosed him with a mental issue.  If you cant make them get help that law doesnt matter.
966736469359382528 2018-02-22 18:08:30 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @TamikaDMallory @bobblanddesign @womensmarch @VanJones68 I thought your show was suppose to get people out of the echo camber.  I was giving it a shot but this is a joke.  While the guest are fine they are all on the same side.  So I have no reason to watch.
966704334137257984 2018-02-22 16:00:48 UTC <Esteeb0582> @theblaze No should I?
966702305037860864 2018-02-22 15:52:44 UTC <Esteeb0582> @SXMPOTUS @rweingarten @smerconish I had at least a few teachers in high school that where former military and owned guns.  I wouldnt have had an issue knowing they had one in a lock box just in case something started.
966082904479563777 2018-02-20 22:51:28 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Nicholas_Merten Man good to hear from you.  Biggest regret was just getting to know your channel when you told us how good NEO was.  Missed that crazy run.  Take care man your the best.
966024474893012992 2018-02-20 18:59:17 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Okay prove maybe the wrong word.  All that shows is he did a real estate deal.  I makes sense to me if you buy a empty building and fill it with long term tenants the value goes up.  It just looks like he did a good job. So what if the bank he used was fined.
966009660040888320 2018-02-20 18:00:25 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Okay read that story it implies Jared maybe got some deals cause of who he was.  But didnt really prove to me he did anything wrong.  Having loans from a bank that has been fined doesnt mean you breaking the rules.  But I do see why they would want to check.
966005996589015040 2018-02-20 17:45:51 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Okay so went and checked Gates story seems the same.  He and Manafort are in trouble for stuff they did with Ukraine before working on Trumps Campaign.  These guys should go down for that but I still dont see how that connects to Trump.
966004461129707520 2018-02-20 17:39:45 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly I heard that a lawyer for Mansfort is pleading to lying about talking to Gates.  Let me go see if I can find a bit more on the story.
966004159769018368 2018-02-20 17:38:33 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly You do that to me a lot but I get it.  I am not a GOP fan boy.  I didnt like the stupid stuff they did while Obama was in office or with Benghazi.
966003473962553344 2018-02-20 17:35:50 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Not you but others try to make this out as Trump did something that would be worthy of impeachment.  I guess we will see.  I am not aware of money laundering charges but more might be coming.
966002536950906880 2018-02-20 17:32:06 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Yes but in that tweet you refer to things Trump said.  From his point of view this still looks like a witch hunt.  When it comes to collusion.  At this point most of the pleas are to make false statements about dealing that had nothing to do with the election.
966001611741962240 2018-02-20 17:28:26 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Do any of the pleas have anything to do with collusion about the election.  I have been hearing no.  Maybe you have a different take?
964649891631788032 2018-02-16 23:57:11 UTC <Esteeb0582> @hqtrivia how do the extra lives work?  I got 4 so do I have to use them all in he next game I play?
964627918835007488 2018-02-16 22:29:52 UTC <Esteeb0582> @officialmcafee I have that App been playing it.  Talking to them about issues.  Been told they will reward me for issues I found.  Hope they are gone soon.  Cause I want this work.
964513967908384768 2018-02-16 14:57:04 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TomiLahren Tomi you are right on.  People dont seem to get with all these signed he was not Diagnosed with a mental issue.  So even a ban on selling to a person with a mental issue wouldnt have stopped this.  Only someone getting to him before it happened could have stopped it.
964275482953830400 2018-02-15 23:09:25 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RealKidPoker We are a very mixed nation.  Then we have the 2nd amendment.  Put that together the right to have a gun many people with very different ideas living together and you are going to have this kind of violence.  But dont forget guns save people and property also.  It is a hard topic
964185817143951360 2018-02-15 17:13:07 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly I didnt want to upset you.  I will back the idea of a bill like that.  I dont have much of a platform to help much.  I am just pointing out Congress doesnt act in these things.  Maybe this time they will.
964184954996375552 2018-02-15 17:09:41 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Not that I dont support this kind of thing.  I dont see it as a good idea right now.  No one has proven that they can get congress to pass reforms.  We should still try but wondering what we can do with out them?
964173442164539393 2018-02-15 16:23:56 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Do you know Anyone with serious good ideas on what to do?
963905016380637184 2018-02-14 22:37:19 UTC <Esteeb0582> @wayngo3 CA democratic cause I grew up poor then I started to pay attention.  It was very easy to switch.  Never going to back and might have to leave my crazy state.
963838174425374720 2018-02-14 18:11:42 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish This is silly that so many hate the idea.  Go hang out at liquor stores and see how many people will give you 2 for 1 to buy them beer.  Snap is a joke we need to feed the poor but it is abused a ton.
963828198621327360 2018-02-14 17:32:04 UTC <Esteeb0582> @techinsidr Well the NHL stopped the pros from playing.  So this would be the like 10th string guys.
963827977107619840 2018-02-14 17:31:11 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ziggysternstaub Yes when people cross the border we have some laws to protect them if they need help.  But they are suppose to apply for it not sneak in get caught and then apply.  You will never get me to side with anyone that does that.  It seems fake and made up.
963646209842966529 2018-02-13 05:28:54 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN I can tell you I was born in 1982 and for my generation this is not true.  I was never even taught to see race.  Only to see people and their character.  But was as raise to be proud American.  American pride gets spun to racism sometimes and that is sad.
963563635418177536 2018-02-13 00:00:47 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter Would be nice if we could hear more about this meddling they are doing.  Like is making a video you post on FB to hurt a party you dont like considered meddling?  Or are they trying to hack system to change votes?  If it is just propaganda we do that a lot also.
963551283574595584 2018-02-13 23:11:42 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ColemanMoreing Ya I talk to him a lot cause he answers but he always thinks he is right.  Gets a little old but most other people wont even debate or talk they just yell at you and hide or block you.
963547312466288640 2018-02-13 22:55:55 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Kenwhite4444 @ColemanMoreing @MrMokelly No I am giving my opinion.  That is all.
963542392363130880 2018-02-13 22:36:22 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Kenwhite4444 @ColemanMoreing @MrMokelly One that ignores the laws and trys to work around them to get to a verdict they like.  If you say this isnt happening you are just not paying attention to how different courts in CA and NY rule compared to TX other red states.  I dont like that it happens on both sides.
963541526348382210 2018-02-13 22:32:56 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Kenwhite4444 @ColemanMoreing @MrMokelly Do people today still have DACA protections?  Yes they do.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/qz.com/898683/can-an-executive-order-be-revoked/amp/ there it clearly says Trump has the legal right to end it.  But I will go try to read how the Judge thinks he has the right to stop him.
963539713448554497 2018-02-13 22:25:44 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Kenwhite4444 @ColemanMoreing @MrMokelly You keep doing this.  I said he ended it for new people and left it in place for up to 2 years for those that had it.
963533137480269824 2018-02-13 21:59:36 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Kenwhite4444 @ColemanMoreing @MrMokelly Funny again rogue judge from a left state.  It will go up to next court and be overturned.  This is the mess we are in Judges dont follow law anymore they write opinions instead of following it.
963525455415451648 2018-02-13 21:29:04 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ColemanMoreing I am in the OC now grew up in suburbs of LA
963507260252078080 2018-02-13 20:16:46 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Kenwhite4444 @MrMokelly Thanks for assuming I didnt care.  Told you before I didnt like what the GOP did just blocking stuff.  Now I feel the same dont like the Dems just blocking stuff.  I want plans to move forward.  But you cant plan congress for all of CA problems.
963502682785722368 2018-02-13 19:58:35 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Kenwhite4444 @MrMokelly 2.  Our schools are so much worst than when I grew up.  Our streets failing apart.  Poverty levels are crazy.  Homeless camps all over the place.  And Democrats in form control for years.  This is what I see when drive around my State.
963502075824001025 2018-02-13 19:56:10 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Kenwhite4444 @MrMokelly 1.None of us can speak for everyone.  I can only speak for me.  I want us to follow are laws or change them the correct way.  I want a wall cause I live in CA my whole like and cant say a open border helps us.  My state is in poor shape.  So I worry for my daughters.
963486308969558016 2018-02-13 18:53:31 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Kenwhite4444 @ColemanMoreing @MrMokelly It 08 I was 24 living paycheck to paycheck renting a room and studying for the job I have today.  So I didnt feel that one so much.  Also I will admit I didnt follow politics as closely back then.
963478078927249408 2018-02-13 18:20:49 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Kenwhite4444 @MrMokelly I am just going to wait for the senate plan.  I believe we will get some Wall funding and DACA kids will get to stay.
963471303826055168 2018-02-13 17:53:53 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Kenwhite4444 @MrMokelly "will allow any DACA recipients with a permit set to expire before March 5, 2018, the opportunity to apply for a two-year renewal if they apply by October 5." See yes they stopped anyone else from getting status but gave a long delay for those that had it.
963469792698023936 2018-02-13 17:47:53 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Kenwhite4444 @MrMokelly How did he end it immediately?  There was a delay and anyone in DACA could reup and have the DACA protection for 2 more years.  I don't get it when you make statements like that.  His actions have to reflect his party.
963466673024978944 2018-02-13 17:35:29 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @MrMokelly @Kenwhite4444 Guys I get what you are doing but when conversation goes this way take me off.  I made strong points in my mind during my messages.  I never tried to insult anymore.  I did feel like some message send to me came off as condescending.  Senate is working on a deal this morning.
963281628410789890 2018-02-12 05:20:11 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Kenwhite4444 @MrMokelly He is pushing to do something about this a legal way that courts wont overturn.  Along with getting some things back so the GOP can sell it to their voters.  Citizenship is on the table and people are going to walk away from that it seems odd to me.
963281107251707904 2018-02-12 05:18:07 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Kenwhite4444 @MrMokelly DACA was going to face a strong legal challenge from Texas and other states if Trump didnt end it.  So he did with a long grace period up to 2 years for some.  Gave congress the direction to make a deal he could support.  If overturned in courts would have ended sooner.
963278943678709760 2018-02-12 05:09:31 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Kenwhite4444 @MrMokelly Assuming you are giving up cause that was short juvenile and condescending again.  Well thanks again for at least answering.  I do enjoy the debating even when I lose.
963275715310309376 2018-02-12 04:56:41 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Kenwhite4444 @MrMokelly 2.  Offers back try to keep the path to citizenship but dont fully fund Wall or dont change Family reunification at all.  He is offering more than another GOP president in recent time but cant get a good offer back yet.
963275230021001217 2018-02-12 04:54:46 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Kenwhite4444 @MrMokelly 1. Yes..Trump has said he wanted Wall funded, end visa lotto, and chain migration.  For a path to citizenship for all DACA eligible illegals.  Clear frame work for the bill but Democrats have not offered him anything close to that yet.
963272822381424640 2018-02-12 04:45:12 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Kenwhite4444 @MrMokelly Again misleading there are not 59 GOP senators.  There was 52 so for a true deal they needed 8.  8>4 also math.  So they tried another way that lead them to only need 1 more.  It failed.  But they tried.  I will always prefer they try.
963266798433968128 2018-02-12 04:21:16 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @MrMokelly You ask so many condescending questions is very juvenile.  For someone I know is very smart and well informed.  Yes GOP failed on Obamacare but they tried.  Also you once again try to paint me as GOP fan.  Not so more of a progressive now.  Was a Democrat.
963263715628826624 2018-02-12 04:09:01 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @MrMokelly They had to get 4 senators.... not saying it could have been done for sure but did they even try?  As it seems super important just 6 years later seems odd.  If they stuck the right deal should have been able to flip 4 senators.
963260937296728064 2018-02-12 03:57:58 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @MrMokelly They point is that if Democrats wanted DACA fixed congress could have had a bill on Obamas desk day one.  But this is hard cause both sides like illegals.  GOP low cost labor, low skill workers keeping wages down.  Dems manage to get 2nd gen voters.
963217730873602048 2018-02-12 01:06:17 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Nicholas_Merten do you believe that the Chinese New Year.  Will cause a big dip?  Past charts show that it does?  Maybe take a look?
963210945630633984 2018-02-12 00:39:19 UTC <Esteeb0582> @loomdart I have .15 all my coins is about .25 I want to get more but trying to sell your wife on crypto is really hard it seems.
962744981365579776 2018-02-11 17:47:45 UTC <Esteeb0582> @VanJones68 Well I watched the show.  Cant say I liked it.  Not really feeling your giving the conservative side a good voice.  But will see if the next show is a little different.

962560623300128769 2018-02-10 05:35:10 UTC <Esteeb0582> @IndivisibleNet This man fought wars for you.  Very sad person you both are.  @JuddApatow till you have stood next to a grave of a solider you knew you will never understand how much this stuff hurts us.
962490984163495936 2018-02-10 00:58:27 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MeghanMcCain @VanJones68 Van I use to love your takes.  But a few in this memo debate I dont like.  You dont believe at all what FBI said about democratic one that it had to be redone.  That could be the truth so give it a chance in your mind.
962155286151622656 2018-02-09 02:44:30 UTC <Esteeb0582> @keithboykin Okay you are a tool.  The shutdown was politics only lasted a few hours.  The Dow also has a +500 and +330 day.  Also more companies gave bonus and pay raises.  On and you again ignored the good cause youre mad.  Get over it.
962039410458898434 2018-02-09 19:04:03 UTC <Esteeb0582> @theblaze @realDonaldTrump Fix this please control the spending.
962025026160439296 2018-02-09 18:06:54 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TomiLahren @ChicagoMGD_SD Once again bringing up great grandparents actions are pointless.  In the past America needed more immigrants.  Today we still need some just less.  You really don't understand a lot of us.  I want this all figured out so the people here have legal status to work and earn.
961749284981911552 2018-02-08 23:51:12 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TomiLahren @ChicagoMGD_SD @mercguybrarian @gunslingerbk His point is pretty weak also.  I had to deal with the shitty stuff my parents did.  Almost all of us have to deal with what our parents did and for some it helps other it doesnt.
961740217156648961 2018-02-08 23:15:10 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TomiLahren @ChicagoMGD_SD @mercguybrarian Reporting I have seen is Democrats dont want the current offer cause of the fact that it limits the family Reunification and bans the parents from green cards.  So now they want more people to get to legal status that the DACA kids
961718907806482432 2018-02-08 21:50:30 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TomiLahren @ChicagoMGD_SD @mercguybrarian Bit confused isnt current offer to let the DACA kids stay.  Even become citizens?  But they are holding that up cause now we also have to let the parents that broke the laws also stay. Do any of them have to follow the laws?  I do.
961715812162654208 2018-02-08 21:38:12 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TomiLahren @ChicagoMGD_SD That is very stupid to try and blame her for something done long before she was born.

961460677201178625 2018-02-07 04:44:23 UTC <Esteeb0582> @secupp Ya happens to me also.  Conservative that isnt religious.  People seem to not understand how that happens.  Pretty simple for me parents taught me wrong and right.

959829973765734400 2018-02-03 16:44:33 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish They opened this invest.. into the team and after months of nothing used that dossier to get a FISA to wiretap team. I know he had left the team.  But it shows to me that the FBI was trying to find something and went as far as using very silly intel to do it.

959638830616690688 2018-02-02 04:05:01 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RandiRhodes @RealDLHughley @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly Cause the Democrats are trying to impeach him.
959638609019072513 2018-02-02 04:04:08 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RandiRhodes @RealDLHughley @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly Then why would McCabe say that to Congress?  I really hope he didnt say that and it comes out soon.  I dont want my government spying on us using something like that.
959638059946991616 2018-02-02 04:01:57 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RandiRhodes @RealDLHughley @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly I agree.  I dont want criminals in or around that office.  But I dont want Trump bogged down in this his whole term if he didnt do anything.  I really just want the truth to come out.  Either way it seems something bad was going on.
959637437558353920 2018-02-02 03:59:28 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RandiRhodes @RealDLHughley @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly I did spend part of today trying to figure out what Page did and couldnt find anything.  The George P stuff showed he lied about what he was doing but not if what he was doing was illegal.  It didnt seem like it but cant say I know for sure.
959635960450265089 2018-02-02 03:53:36 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RandiRhodes @RealDLHughley @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly But maybe he didnt say that I know some are denying that.
959635785048670209 2018-02-02 03:52:54 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RandiRhodes @RealDLHughley @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly I read it again this time on NPR with them picking it apart.  The point a lot of holes.  I agree we dont have all the pieces yet.  For sure it is claiming the dossier is a main reason for FISA on Page.  I get that might not be all but if McCabe part is true it was a big part.
959631995864104960 2018-02-02 03:37:51 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RandiRhodes @RealDLHughley @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly I did read it.  That was the claim to look into Page.  But sure I will go read it again.  Make sure I am not confused.
959629577717870592 2018-02-02 03:28:15 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RandiRhodes @RealDLHughley @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly I read it.  If true they used the dossier to get the FISA court to let them spy on page.  While knowing who made it and used that yahoo story to verify it.  Well then this was very wrong.  Hoping to read the dems one soon.  This looks bad.
959569674953306112 2018-02-02 23:30:13 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AnnCoulter @flynn_jason @skyrocketkday See now your like wow he didn't plea.  So they did all this looking into a guy they have nothing on?
959558723856359424 2018-02-02 22:46:42 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AnnCoulter @flynn_jason @skyrocketkday Where are you getting that.  I see that George P. plead to lying.  Not to working with Russian to steal the election.  To date Carter Page hasn't be charged or plead guilty to anything.  At least that is what I am reading online.  Link me something.
959555251819880448 2018-02-02 22:32:54 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AnnCoulter @flynn_jason @skyrocketkday No one has been able to prove that the meetings in the dossier are real.  That Page meet any of those people while in Russia or made any deals like it said.  So that part of the Dossier is made up unless someone can prove it.
959555004049719296 2018-02-02 22:31:55 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AnnCoulter @flynn_jason @skyrocketkday No one has shown the 2013 investigation was still open.  Also that stuff was before he was even working with Trump.  The point here is Trump is getting blame for things that are not really connected to him.  That is why it looks like they pushed this without real reason.
959551879658139649 2018-02-02 22:19:30 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AnnCoulter @flynn_jason @skyrocketkday You can't just make up reasons to spy on people in hopes to get them in trouble.  Using a doc that is not proved to be real it shows they wanted to do this.  Not that they needed to.
959551629568573441 2018-02-02 22:18:30 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AnnCoulter @flynn_jason @skyrocketkday Without seeing both sides yet this is the Abuse.  They used a dossier that was known to be made by a questionable person to stay to spy on a member of campaign of someone running for president.  Now if you show me some other way they got the FISA then maybe I change my mind.
959530755842981888 2018-02-02 20:55:34 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AnnCoulter @flynn_jason @skyrocketkday I just got back from lunch so I will go ahead and see if I can dig up anyone proving it is not telling the truth.  For sure I bet they left some stuff out so I also want to see what the Dems wrote.  But I hope you also attack that one.
959530389411741696 2018-02-02 20:54:06 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AnnCoulter @flynn_jason @skyrocketkday Him being looked at in 2013 proves nothing.  You can't show me that was still on going.  I am just at this point not ready to call members of congress liars.  They are not allowed to show their work.  So they wrote up a summary.  Unless false this does show abuse of the FISA.
959511145089351681 2018-02-02 19:37:38 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter So best guess as to why he was pulled off then?
959507258370502656 2018-02-02 19:22:11 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RealDonLopez HAHA
959506727417729024 2018-02-02 19:20:05 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AnnCoulter @skyrocketkday @flynn_jason It is the only reason for the wiretap of Page.  The time line I see shows that before that they are looking into George P.  He lies to them about what he did but none of what he did is connected to trump or even proven to be illegal.  Without this it would have ended it seems.
959504865390022656 2018-02-02 19:12:41 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RealDonLopez I doubt they will ever let us see all of it.  You know if he didn't break any laws.  We are going to have spent a ton of Money and tainted people for nothing.  This could have ended after looking into Page and G.P.  But it just keeps going with no crime yet.
959504248508637184 2018-02-02 19:10:14 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AnnCoulter @skyrocketkday @flynn_jason Investigation is different than wiretapping.
959500566727573505 2018-02-02 18:55:36 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RealDonLopez Man that is not how it works.  You don't get to just wiretap and do surveillance people hoping you catch something.  You have to prove the court that you think a crime is happening then get the warrant.  If you use fake docs. to get the warrant that won't hold up in court.
959499135832354818 2018-02-02 18:49:55 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AnnCoulter @skyrocketkday Again who in the senate?  I know at least a few wanted it out.
959499002658963456 2018-02-02 18:49:23 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AnnCoulter @skyrocketkday Who are the people?  Just wondering.  That should come out cause those interviews are suppose to be recorded one way or another.
959498635305037824 2018-02-02 18:47:55 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RealDonLopez More than just Americans they did it to the people in the opposition party that are running for President. I mean that  kind of like what happened in Watergate that that was a huge issue.  Yet this time it is okay cause well those guys took trips to Russia
959498293486108672 2018-02-02 18:46:34 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RealDonLopez Think of it man.  If Bush had been wire tapping people working on the Obama campaign based in part on a dossier that was written with connections to Romney how would you feel?  Take the politics out.  They spied on Americans.  Was it justified?
959497704333131781 2018-02-02 18:44:13 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RealDonLopez Ya I listen to more new on the radio.  I read the memo.  They spied on people working on the Trump campaign.  As of now none of them have be proven to be doing anything that they where not allowed to.  G.P. lied about stuff but that stuff wasn't even illegal.
959494820732416001 2018-02-02 18:32:46 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AnnCoulter @skyrocketkday Sorry should have said house members.  Got a timeline link.  They say the FISA was due to dossier.  I am open to someone proving that wrong.  But haven't seen that yet.  It is a big deal for Gov.  To spy on us.  This doesn't look good at all.
959494030999437314 2018-02-02 18:29:38 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RealDonLopez I agree with you man.  But this is a fact.  The DOJ and FBI where in fact tapping Trumps phones while he was running for president at least in part based on a dossier that was made at the request of people that hate Trump.  That is not okay.
959493601506897920 2018-02-02 18:27:55 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RealDonLopez They looked into George P found no connection that was criminal.  They needed another way to look into things and magic they create on with the dossier to now get to tap phones and stuff.  This is pretty crazy but I want to see the other memo.
959489922691297280 2018-02-02 18:13:18 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AnnCoulter @skyrocketkday It was written by Senators that got to see the evidence.   There is doc. by the dems on that committee that will come out but unless it proves that these points are wrong think about what they did.  Then think about if they did that to you.
959486885436440576 2018-02-02 18:01:14 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @GloriaBorger Come on @brianstelter you can be better than this.  They used a story he leaked to prove his dossier was real.  Let me link you to a story I write to prove a story I write is real.  This is sick what was done.
959474861587415041 2018-02-02 17:13:27 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly It always corrects a bit after a run up.  I was guessing a bit at the number and picked one too low.  Maybe if I said it would correct 23500 then go up it would have worked better.  I am done those guys have a good one.  I get it you don't think we are going to grow.
959472079081897984 2018-02-02 17:02:24 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Neither one of us can win this right now.  Maybe my pull back is a little big but after big runs there is always a pull back.  Clearly you think we are doomed and I don't.  We will figure that out in time.
959470895688425472 2018-02-02 16:57:42 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly In general that we will have a pull back down to around 22k to 23k then from there the next big move will be up or down depending on how the economy is doing.  If we keep adding jobs and people are spending more money it will then head up to new highs.  If economy weak it drops.
959468847643242496 2018-02-02 16:49:34 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly You can't really know that.  Also you don't have to if they do cut spending.  I know at this point they have not.  Stock market moves are not the only part.  If jobs and Pay keep going up like it is being reported it will go in the right direction.
959467906785468416 2018-02-02 16:45:49 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly You can't go up everyday.  I argued for growth over years not days.   Stock Market is up about 4800 points this year that is amazing run.  If it can hold that and grow even to 27000 this next year we would be doing great.
959466858083598336 2018-02-02 16:41:39 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Really down a few points after the run it has has had.?   Look at it for the last year or even 3 months.  If we get back down in the 22000s then I will worry a bit.
959463146594344960 2018-02-02 16:26:54 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish Not sure you read these I don't get answers.  I am amazed that your show talks more about obstruction that the fact that our Government was doing surveillance of Americans based on fake info.
959461918464385024 2018-02-02 16:22:01 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Hello again.  Jobs numbers out again we adding 240,,000.  I know that some companies in markets that are not doing well will have to let people go.  That is how it works.  As long as we continue this growth plan can work in the long run.
958907805536198656 2018-01-31 03:40:11 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost @smerconish Both options are great.  So I like this poll.
958887610037891072 2018-01-31 02:19:56 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper @imwren @JakeVandyne @petadvocatesnet I get the 2026 things go back for some.  But that can be changed if these rates work.  I do worry about companies sitting on money.
958882830808788992 2018-01-31 02:00:56 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper @imwren @JakeVandyne @petadvocatesnet You still didnt explain how it would hurt you.  So I dont believe it.  You can be general or link me the back up.
958871412508250113 2018-01-31 01:15:34 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper @imwren @JakeVandyne @petadvocatesnet Can you explain.  S Corp was lowered to 21% how do you file?  Only people this hurts a little I have found doing the math is single file over 100k or joint over 175k that live in states with high taxes.  With no kids and a Mortgage.  Due to SALT cap 10k
958811119442804736 2018-01-31 21:15:59 UTC <Esteeb0582> @FBI @smerconish I want to read it.  I will be open to people trying to prove it isn't true but could be a very big deal.
958810148079681536 2018-01-31 21:12:07 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly Good Point.  I did in fact miss that.  This does put more of a burden to deal with less Tax Revenue.  So there is more of a chance to increase the debit in early years unless growth is very strong.  Still the first payments will help first years of plan.
958807400970006528 2018-01-31 21:01:12 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly I have shown you how this can work both for a company and for people.  It just requires growth.  I get it you don't think that growth is possible.  The cuts and bonus tax payments like Apple 38 Billion are meant to help the first few years.
958804014400876544 2018-01-31 20:47:45 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly You are assuming also no spending cuts in the next 10 years.  If both are done it can work.  In general I doubt it will balance cause the never do that.  We are 20 trillion in debt for a reason.  If he can grow it only say 2 trillion while give us all more money I will take it.
958803534408904709 2018-01-31 20:45:50 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly The main idea of this tax cut was to promote growth.  It is designed to do that.  https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/26/us-companies-that-have-announced-bonuses-investments-after-tax-cut.html  It is working.
958801992301686784 2018-01-31 20:39:43 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly None of the new taxes are hitting bottom lines yet.  As normal some companies will grow some will shrink.  If there is a net gain then my Math can work.  That is the point there is Math to support the plan.  Now is the time to see if it works not judge it before it even starts.
958800697100677120 2018-01-31 20:34:34 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly This is an example of how it can work also each of the first workers has another 1500 to spend.  That helps all companies drive up revenues.
958800368065953792 2018-01-31 20:33:16 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly New tax rates 21 and 22 for 50k.  1.05 million and 550k for 1.6 million. Company A takes tax savings and adds 10 more jobs That is another 110k now at 1.7 Million New workers drive up Revenue to 6.5 million. That is another 315k now we are at 2.15 Million
958800352240812032 2018-01-31 20:33:12 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly Company A 30 workers 5 million in taxable income at 29%.  Gives  1.45 million 50 workers making 50k at 25% a year give 625k Total 2.075000 million to Fed
958795298888806400 2018-01-31 20:13:07 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly Do you really expect me to budget out the federal government right now? I am not an insider than knows full plans.  I am explaining how it could work.  There is math that shows a cut like this can work if economy growth is strong.  The one time tax deals like Apple help.
958791535763443712 2018-01-31 19:58:10 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly No I know it will go down.  My debate is how much.  We have cut taxes in the past and seen it go up.  Also seen it go down.  I pointed out the need to cut spending.
958791264828141568 2018-01-31 19:57:05 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly It just says it is unclear where the funds come from but that plan is to only spend 200 billion.  Needs more details but is a outline of federal cost.
958766435131572224 2018-01-31 18:18:25 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper @imwren @JakeVandyne @petadvocatesnet Yes but if will affect 2018 paychecks.  So federal withholding in your check are going to change starting next month.
958766041517080576 2018-01-31 18:16:51 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-infrastructure-plan-state-of-the-union-could-pan-out-in-2019/ Here maybe this will help.  He is only spending 200 Billion not ONE THOUSAND BILLION.
958765158901334016 2018-01-31 18:13:21 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper @imwren @JakeVandyne I was just adding to conversations but sure your right.  She was wrong. Better?
958763814425542656 2018-01-31 18:08:00 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper @imwren @JakeVandyne Ya it is increase in pay check she should have pointed out.  I get a 3% raise how about you check the brackets.
958763082485919744 2018-01-31 18:05:06 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper Wait till people see pay checks go up and Trump and Republicans say we did that for you.
958754575153954816 2018-01-31 17:31:18 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly I never said they would be used by Federal government.  I said that if the states have more.  They will need less Federal Aid.
958754047019819008 2018-01-31 17:29:12 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly It won't be 1/3 less.  It will end up being more like 1/5.  Yes I don't think we waste a lot of money at the federal level.  So if you really tried you could cut a lot of spending.
958753207475294208 2018-01-31 17:25:52 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly I really thought that just went without saying.  None of us know for sure what will happen.  I just hope it works cause I like a plan that give us more money.  That rewards investing here.  I am really hoping it uplifts us all.
958752705815572480 2018-01-31 17:23:52 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly I am not making up the ideas to make the plans work.  By giving us more money the states will collect more sales tax.  Then they Federal government can give the states less money.  This will be a lot clearer in a few months as changes kick in.
958751145123446784 2018-01-31 17:17:40 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly Yes it is.  If it doesn't work it will hurt them just as bad.  But it is a little different one is on taxes the other is healthcare.  Lower taxes are not as different a idea as forcing me to buy health insurance.
958750676590346240 2018-01-31 17:15:48 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly It isn't but it will take a lot. 1. Company Growth 2. Person Income Growth 3. Smaller Government payrolls 4. More Taxes for states due to more local spending It can work, I can't promise but I am willing to try is all.
958747821250723840 2018-01-31 17:04:27 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly Okay so the only people paying that or close to it was small business that did not have the assets to write off.  That is who needed it.  That is why I celebrate it.  They part of the plan is to shrink government to lower that payroll.
958746985065889792 2018-01-31 17:01:08 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly I will admit that growth model is hard to met fast but they can get there overtime.  To offset the short term loss he cuts a deal to bring back offshore money.  That will net us taxes now that we would have many never got.
958746521582764033 2018-01-31 16:59:18 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly Here is some math to show you. Company A makes 20 Million a year in Taxable income with discounts pays 29% in tax.  We get  5.8 million in taxes.   Trump lowers taxes so they grow Now they make 28 Million a year at 21% we 5.88 million in Taxes.
958745560462254080 2018-01-31 16:55:28 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly So the tax cut will not hurt tax revenue that much cause no one was paying the 39% due exemptions.  New tax plan is helping companies to grow.  That leads to bigger numbers to tax.  That is the theory it can work but isn't for sure.
958744392105320448 2018-01-31 16:50:50 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly Your friend asked me the question, sorry I answered.
958744178116067328 2018-01-31 16:49:59 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly Do you have a answer?  Do you know what he could have done to not lead to the tea party?  Also maybe after they got the house maybe try to find a way to work with them to get something passed.  Don't just fall back on executive orders.
958743900180561921 2018-01-31 16:48:53 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly I know they didn't want him to succeed.  I didn't like that then either.  But pushing Obamacare through was not the answer that is clear.  I can't say I know what he should have done but that isn't really on me.  All I can do is look at what was done and see that it didn't work.
958741491442003969 2018-01-31 16:39:18 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly Not true.  I know he wanted to do a lot.  You know I voted for Obama twice.  No real issues with him other than that he didn't work with the Republicans enough.  He had both house for 2 years and blew it.  And we got the Tea Party in the house now blocking everything.
958737980037808128 2018-01-31 16:25:21 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly It is really hard to get into serious fights about this.  Last 2 presidents pushed us from 4 trillion in debt to 20 trillion in debt.  Yet you want to worry about balancing the books now.  At least the 1 trillion Trump wants to spend will get us something.
958736755506610176 2018-01-31 16:20:29 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly My point was that he got a extra 38 billion in taxes from Apple bring back offshore money.  That we only got due to the new tax plan.  If you want to talk for real know that most major companies never paid 38% tax. Apple's worldwide effective tax rate is 24.6 %. #facts
958723252565741570 2018-01-31 15:26:50 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rolandsmartin @JoyAnnReid @MrMokelly So the money Apple brought back pays for the wall with some left over.  We have had many companies talk about big new investments in America, Apple, Exon, Mazda/Toyota, Amazon(unless Canada steals that one).  Growth pays for infrastructure not right away but over time.
958542797132320768 2018-01-30 03:29:46 UTC <Esteeb0582> @KatTimpf It is a on going crime.  That leads to more crime.  Identify  theft to work or helping someone else break the law to pay them under the table.  Also they use up our infrastructure, over crowd schools.  It just keeps going.
958039252847149057 2018-01-29 18:08:52 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TheThomasGuide Man this could mean the memo  has some serious issues with him and the FBI or maybe not.  Can we just be told what happened?
957454358290907136 2018-01-27 03:24:42 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Good read guys.  Sorry but there have been too many stories proven fake to believe anything anymore that you dont have hard proof.  There is a clear hated of Trump.  I know @mrmokelly tries to be fare.  That is why I do still follow him and listen to his show.
957316811921309696 2018-01-27 18:18:08 UTC <Esteeb0582> @mollie @brithume @Thesanelib The only good thing is they forget to vote but this year there is this idea that left is full of energy and will get out the vote.  Democratics has a super majority.  Till we recalled one guy.  They had so many new taxes plans for crazy stuff.
957314795128078336 2018-01-27 18:10:07 UTC <Esteeb0582> @mollie @brithume @Thesanelib Voters who dont follow issues or listen to the debate and just vote democrat.  I talk to them sometimes and go over what the democrats are trying to do and they think it is crazy.  But they had no idea that was even going on.
957314094700179457 2018-01-27 18:07:20 UTC <Esteeb0582> @mollie @brithume @Thesanelib Trying but it isnt easy.  They get so many free votes from the LA area.
956308853984866304 2018-01-24 23:32:52 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JenWoodruff79 @HashtagGriswold well they live at home with mom and dad so really those numbers are sad
956220498270076928 2018-01-24 17:41:47 UTC <Esteeb0582> @politico @greenfield64 @smerconish Once again your results show hate for Trump.  By people with no technical knowledge or they ignore it.  Text cant just disappear.  They are saved by carriers and need court orders to release.  If they dont show up something is wrong.
956048368391872512 2018-01-23 06:17:48 UTC <Esteeb0582> @WolfOfPoloniex Glad youre okay.
956045789184364544 2018-01-23 06:07:33 UTC <Esteeb0582> @seanmdav You can get these back.  I know it.  I have done it for work.  Just takes some time and court order.
955258411356102657 2018-01-21 01:58:47 UTC <Esteeb0582> @mollie @brithume Been here my whole life.  It is crazy man.  We have tent cities all over the place.  People act like that is just normal.  Like the Democrats that control this state are doing a good job.  My poor state is falling apart.
955256315932061696 2018-01-21 01:50:28 UTC <Esteeb0582> @themouthmatusow Well there was that Raider game with 6tds but that was the Raiders.
955172857000046592 2018-01-21 20:18:50 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ConanOBrien Forgot to say if your rich.
954912305292066816 2018-01-20 03:03:29 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly I am listening to the show. Good points on the criminals.  I also wonder a lot who is going to run and win these races for democratics. Sorry if I miss parts I listen with a two year old who yells when she wants.
954908784769445888 2018-01-20 02:49:30 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly All I heard you say was he blew up the deal.  I have heard the numbers from other places.  I dont really think who is to blame will matter much.  Anti Trump will blame him and Trump fans wont just where we are.
954906680382316544 2018-01-20 02:41:08 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly A real offer would be 25% of the funding or more.  Also he didnt get the chain migration changes in it.  So he was willing to take less just not only 1.6 billion.
954904300026826757 2018-01-20 02:31:41 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly he didnt hold government hostage for the wall.  The CR was meant to keep it running while they worked on amounted of funding.  He was offered a report 1.6 billion.  That is not a real offer for such a big compromise of allowing all DACA to stay and have a legal status
954902574548664320 2018-01-20 02:24:49 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly It is obvious that we have to pay to built it.  Then with policy changes and trades we make the money back.
954900603938861056 2018-01-20 02:16:59 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly not sure how you put this on Trump.  He has been clear DACA for Wall. Not DACA for finding the government.
954567831781167107 2018-01-19 04:14:40 UTC <Esteeb0582> @SenSanders Do they have 60 votes in the senate.  I missed when that happened.  Start doing your job and keep government running.
952913996344000512 2018-01-15 14:42:55 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JBeverly28 @MrMokelly Most of that program is fine.  But there is a lotto.  Yes I am blessed to have been born here.
952795452922986496 2018-01-14 06:51:52 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JBeverly28 @MrMokelly No idea why she asked that.  I have no issues with legal immigration from@any where.  Also to me merit should also include disasters and state of home country.  Just not a lotto.  Or chain longer than core family.
952598442668277761 2018-01-14 17:49:01 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish Again this shows how much people just hate Trump.  They cant be objective.  He is clearly saying it cause they are poor.  That is still mean but they want to label him a racist so bad.
952390078956843008 2018-01-13 04:01:04 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly only caught end of the show.  That was a very nice tribute.  Have a good night
952316398872666112 2018-01-13 23:08:17 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Okay read though those.  Almost all them are explainable.  They few that are not are once again from unnamed sources.  I just no longer trust unnamed sources doesnt work as proof.  If he denies and you cant name the people that accuse I believe him.
952313903664386048 2018-01-13 22:58:22 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish Good show today.  Wolf really looked like a guy that lied to get in.  Did get what he wanted so wrote a book making Trump look bad.  I am pretty tired of unnamed people being quoted.
952313465401520128 2018-01-13 22:56:37 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly But that is his way he thats hard line positions.  Points out the bad things to try and drive home just how crazy we currently pick who comes into the country.
952313086681088000 2018-01-13 22:55:07 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Rapist is from a line that he also said good people.  Never did he call all Mexicans anything.  There where also some normal people at the rally.  He was speaking of them not the Nazis.  All other comments come from him wanting merit based Immigration.  Its not a nice way.
952309922485518337 2018-01-13 22:42:33 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Once again picked the words that make him look bad.  Never taking the full context of what he was saying.  Taking words and making them fit what you want.  Even if the overall message is not close to that.  He doesnt deliver things the best way.  That is true.
951335822317428738 2018-01-10 06:11:49 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Shopkick 1477
950875921866661889 2018-01-09 23:44:20 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Really this started cause I said I didnt like a segment.  At this point I am good with ending at that.  I get it you dont really care that I didnt like it.  Also you dont need to.
950848342367420416 2018-01-09 21:54:45 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly That is why in general I listen to the show and read stuff I can find.  Time a bit short with a 1 month old and a 2 year old.  Life is different for us all.
950848074527604737 2018-01-09 21:53:41 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly  this is why I doubt the book a lot.https://twitter.com/norahodonnell/status/950342833482928130
950612615251701760 2018-01-08 06:18:03 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Pretty funny.  I am not triggered.  I just like talking and Mo Kelly answers which is nice.  Dont really know much about you but seem to back him up which is fine.  But I am just a listener to his show.  To expect me to know all the facts is a bit much.
950612121359851520 2018-01-08 06:16:05 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly No but you added someone else in so was trying to answer both of you.
950507090417614848 2018-01-08 23:18:44 UTC <Esteeb0582> @VanJones68 Man if we get Trump Vs Oprah debates that is going to be something to see.
950499565328744448 2018-01-08 22:48:50 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Taking to two people at once has this going all over the places now.  Your right I dont know all the facts on the book.  Didnt really mean to get into so much but I tried to answer your questions.
950475543169851392 2018-01-08 21:13:23 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly At this point the book is only the point of view of the author but we will see if people go on the record to back him up or he releases some of his tapes.  At least a few have said he is making stuff up.
950475192110792706 2018-01-08 21:11:59 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly You ask them in a condescending why.  Like clearly I am smarter than this guy.
950466099237154816 2018-01-08 20:35:51 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly People attacked him before the book.  Also many have attacked the book as lies.  I know you said he has hours of tape.  Will he release that tape?  Book is on my to read list just havent done it
950465718578921472 2018-01-08 20:34:20 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly No he did.  But overall not a fan of the GOP so him attacking Trump didnt matter a lot to me.  I ha r still not seen any actions of Trump I would call crazy.
950465205867134976 2018-01-08 20:32:18 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly No.  Dont get the point of your over the top questions.
950460837151428609 2018-01-08 20:14:56 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Okay then Yes.  His tweet was a response to media attacks.  No attacks from media no tweet.
950459897170182144 2018-01-08 20:11:12 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly This mental stability issue has been going on for a long time.  I have yet to see anyone put forth any serious proof he has a mental issue that would prevent him from being president.  Feel free to share that proof with me.
950459248005099520 2018-01-08 20:08:38 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Nope I dont think that.  He has done more than one thing I didnt like.  But I have not seen anything that I would say makes him mentally unfit.
950458825856794624 2018-01-08 20:06:57 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly I have not been dishonest.  Putting it in CAPs doesnt make it true.
950458586710163456 2018-01-08 20:06:00 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly No I am saying they are responses.  Responding to critics is normal for him.  Unless I know which person that called him crazy you think is right and why I cant really agree or disagree.
950457818036953088 2018-01-08 20:02:57 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly So people call him crazy all day.  Someone writes a book makes him seem crazy.  He responds by saying look at what I have done in my life.  To prove he is not.  That is unacceptable?
950454870955339776 2018-01-08 19:51:14 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Okay I went and read the tweet I now know you are taking about and yes I see that as a justified response to attacks on him.  Trump always fights back like this.  Dont see the surprise.
950453048484151296 2018-01-08 19:43:59 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly No I also heard the part where you talked about FBI looking into HRC again with no new Evidence.  I just didnt realize you needed to know exact minutes I heard.
950447548774301696 2018-01-08 19:22:08 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly It was cause of the way you did it.  Either way have a good day guys.  I have to head back to work now.
950447366540161024 2018-01-08 19:21:25 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly It is odd how these things end up in strange places.  The only goal I had was to point out that a segment of the show drove me way from listen to your show.  What is true is I got in my car and you came on and I had to change the station.  Not cause you questioned him.
950445785497260032 2018-01-08 19:15:08 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Maybe my time is off.  It seemed like 20 minutes but I admit I wasn't watching a clock.  Maybe I gave up sooner than I thought
950445464045813760 2018-01-08 19:13:51 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly I don't agree.  He is not just tweeting that out at random.  He is responding to critics that have been calling him insane.   You seemed mad cause you said over and over you "didn't even want to hear" from people defending him.  Again just seemed mad or upset to me.
950443561048141824 2018-01-08 19:06:17 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly I tried to hear you out but after about 20 minutes I gave up.   I will still try to listen when I can but can't say I will always get through the show.  20 minutes and I still didn't know which tweet got you going on that rant.  Also I said you seemed mad not that you where.
950442870036729856 2018-01-08 19:03:33 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Your show airs on KFI  I listen to handle on the way to work and then John and Ken on the way home.  So on the weekend I hop in my car to go somewhere and your on.  I think I am going to have a chance to hear some other points and all I heard was you calling Trump a crazy man
950441383218708480 2018-01-08 18:57:38 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly It isn't but when you can't talk about it in a why that doesn't make it seem like hate us it is hard to give your views a shot.  You come off as just mad.  Maybe you are but hard to listen to someone that is just mad.
950436110286520320 2018-01-08 18:36:41 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Not sure what your goals are with the show.  But it is hard to listen to if we disagree.  You speak to us like we are children.  Like there was more of a choice than Hilary or Trump.  For me it came down pretty simple to who did I think would not take money from my family.
948810576850960385 2018-01-03 06:57:24 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JesseBWatters Man this was the best show that night.  Was fun to watch.
948670875519234048 2018-01-03 21:42:16 UTC <Esteeb0582> @KatTimpf Move to California you can get sick for other reason.
946459464156135424 2017-12-28 19:14:55 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly malls becoming entertainment centers and restaurants much less shopping.  Not a big deal those retail stores didnt have many high paying positions.
946180042844811266 2017-12-27 00:44:36 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JesseBWatters Love the show sorry I have to watch it on DVR.
946179890037997568 2017-12-27 00:43:59 UTC <Esteeb0582> @officialmcafee Man to be someone like you with the funds to move a coin up a lot and then dump.  So much power and my guess is you dont need the money.  Said that something meant to free us from banks is being controlled my whales.
944814938253549568 2017-12-23 06:20:09 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish Really this years has been amazing.  You have a chance to do so much more and week after week your show is depressing.
944814032761995264 2017-12-23 06:16:33 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish Man your first set of guest did the Trump bashing but you laid out a good recap.  Really wish you had some better guest.
943164689084641280 2017-12-19 17:02:39 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CenturyLinkHelp So for about 6 months now we are trying to get CenturyLink to fix a ownership issue on our numbers so we can port them.  Beware people they don't react fast when you leave so stay away.
942233962805473280 2017-12-16 03:24:17 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AnnCoulter I agree with you a lot but this is miss guided.  I spend 1600 a month to have two kids in daycare so I can work and pay 25% tax. Will paying CA taxes also.  I need a little break more than you know
940324587446837248 2017-12-11 20:57:06 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish This is a misguided question.  Legal age is 16 in that state.  When I was 28 I dated girls 19 to 22.  Would that mean I also would have dated a 17 year old?  No cause I was following the law.  It is truth that men are attached to woman younger than them. True for many reasons
938978072233050119 2017-12-07 03:46:32 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RealKidPoker Daniel your wrong.  No proof of child molester and some Accusers proved fake.  That was two not so good guys Bragging and one upping each other.  Was not proof of any action.  Others that stepped down had Picture proof or paid off people to hide what they did.  Not the same.
934836436867547136 2017-11-26 17:29:09 UTC <Esteeb0582> @vicenews This isnt news it is a propaganda piece.  Anyone can find five people to interview that will look uninformed or worse.  So sad now Vice is doing this too. #fakenews #wasteoftime
933082666835968000 2017-11-21 21:20:18 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper So you guys invent a new standard I see.  No longer innocent till proven guilty.  Now it is guilty if credibly accused.  How hard would it be to do the same to you?  Think back how many times have you been alone with someone?  They can credibly accuse you.
931995377850507264 2017-11-18 21:19:48 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @TomSteyer @smerconish Yes the ads remind me that Dems pretend to proctecting the poor but are run by the rich that exploit the poor.
930859389606543361 2017-11-15 18:05:47 UTC <Esteeb0582> @geedropsthemic @espo_news I posted a question to him that you liked and replied on.
930857230504640513 2017-11-15 17:57:12 UTC <Esteeb0582> @FBIWFO @espo_news @Tawala @MrMokelly Wow got busy at work at missed a lot.  Not one to attack people sorry all that happened.
930484277942263808 2017-11-14 17:15:14 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly So the amount of Money donated to Clinton Foundation while she was Secretary of State by foreign donors doesnt bother you enough to support an investigation?
930293455913336832 2017-11-13 04:36:58 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper About 20 had younger siblings and their friends
930129057584267264 2017-11-13 17:43:42 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Oh they are just mad and looking for some hits on a post or video.  Youre right to a point smashing it does very little to them.
929788568993533952 2017-11-12 19:10:44 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ReliableSources @brianstelter I watched today for first time in a while.  Didnt like it at all. You dont cover anything that might make our lives better.  Instead focus on GOP or Trump issues.  While leaving out any talk of Dems facing the same issue I.E. Menendez trial.  You come off as one sided and petty
928344498656092160 2017-11-08 19:32:30 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish This poll shows how silly many of your readers are.  If he already has the gun what else could stop him?
927945519002873856 2017-11-07 17:07:06 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly The people commenting assume it is all GOP.  Not sure I agree GOP have the most to lose but time will tell.
927941129261031424 2017-11-07 16:49:40 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly You know till they unsealed we dont know who they are.  Might be wrong to assume all GOP people.
927715468445605888 2017-11-06 01:52:58 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JohnKingCNN @jaketapper @thomaspc @cracka_23 @hawkrew Nah I shot this at him and he shut up.  See he is at 44 and 42 and well cnn at 38 and so on.  Really point is pools like this are dumb.pic.twitter.com/RupPnYDI9U
927683659611586560 2017-11-06 23:46:34 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JohnKingCNN @jaketapper @Beacher50 Here you got as high as 44 and still could be higher again could be lower.  Point is this really doesnt matter much.pic.twitter.com/S5OrXTYGfL
927683006784970752 2017-11-06 23:43:58 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JohnKingCNN @jaketapper @Beacher50 Most polls are a joke then ask 1000 people and claim to represent the nation.  Also they dont matter a lot.  Congress gets what 20%?
927679554289668098 2017-11-06 23:30:15 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JohnKingCNN @jaketapper No one serious trust CNN polls you can add a easy 20 points to him cause I know you only poll your watchers and they hate him.
927669303926652928 2017-11-06 22:49:31 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TheFive @JesseBWatters Okay I will watch
927604892876775424 2017-11-06 18:33:35 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish Do some west coast stuff.
927589565824565248 2017-11-06 17:32:40 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @brianstelter @cnn @jaketapper see why they call you fake news?  Own what you do.https://twitter.com/jamesokeefeiii/status/927586240345583616
927588926046347264 2017-11-06 17:30:08 UTC <Esteeb0582> @monerocurrency @krbcoin @nimbosa @StefanyBaez @NiceHashMining will this be working soon? if not need to move to another pool.
927588686769807360 2017-11-06 17:29:11 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNNReliable @brianstelter @jayrosen_nyu Does he start an interview with a member of congress by saying 8 in 10 people dont approve of you job what are you going to do about it?
927588430804017153 2017-11-06 17:28:10 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNNReliable @brianstelter @jayrosen_nyu Man really you fail to see that Brain ask only questions meant to hurt the image of Trump.  So she had to defend. He sets up that fight.
927579502590377984 2017-11-06 16:52:41 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter You are being misleading also.  The verified things are not the ones that made head lines
927578766687199232 2017-11-06 16:49:46 UTC <Esteeb0582> @monerocurrency @krbcoin @NiceHashMining @nimbosa This is also happening to me.
927287417920352256 2017-11-05 21:32:03 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter You bring up a lot of stuff that doesnt matter.  Still waiting for you to get on topics that matter.
927215514560094208 2017-11-05 16:46:20 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish give this a read and when it happens I want a show about what Trump did for us.https://twitter.com/thomaswictor/status/927079747292577792
926964634061381632 2017-11-04 00:09:25 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish  this is some of that stuff he has done.  He isnt Congress dont judge him on their inaction.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/926789876556500992
926518262984097793 2017-11-03 18:35:42 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper Lol urgent your funny
926465354833870853 2017-11-03 15:05:28 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Gua117 @MrMokelly They dont care about that when they can make money.
926465246729867264 2017-11-03 15:05:02 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly This is why I walked away from the party.
925559735243325440 2017-10-31 03:06:51 UTC <Esteeb0582> Joc with a big knock.  Go Dodgers!!! #HR4HR
925377916359159810 2017-10-31 15:04:22 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly I am a registered Democrat only cause that way I can vote in either primary.  Dems are closed out here in CA so had to do it that way.
925377133827911681 2017-10-31 15:01:16 UTC <Esteeb0582> @SXMPOTUS @CarrollDoherty @pewresearch @smerconish This quiz is very general when it comes to the questions.  Also there isn't a more middle of the road answer.
925371588404396034 2017-10-31 14:39:13 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly No I am desperate for leaders who dont do things to cause investigations but neither party offered me that.
925198777098444801 2017-10-30 03:12:32 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Well it should be the same he hasnt been Indicted yet.  Guilty before even charged?  Also who was the aid found only little on him?
925115469127860224 2017-10-30 21:41:30 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Are stories like this just fake then?  http://amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/oct/18/russia-tables-turn-roping-clinton-obama-holder-not/ sad they all seem dirty.
923033423089823745 2017-10-24 03:48:11 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CFPB @VP @AGBecerra You know you would like a rule that only befits lawyers.  People dont get anything from class action suits.
919333577992560640 2017-10-14 22:46:20 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TomiLahren @Yhsiuqs So you know you can be Registered a democratic and be conservatives I got to vote against Hilary twice.
919331776400474112 2017-10-14 22:39:10 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TomiLahren Yup we are here.
919330733981810688 2017-10-14 22:35:01 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish good show today but bit to much air time on 25th at this point it is a joke.
918940240290525184 2017-10-13 20:43:21 UTC <Esteeb0582> @BernieSanders Cause we gave them money for nothing
918940035444961280 2017-10-13 20:42:32 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AGBecerra It made it so the Democratics lost the house and senate.  About all it has done for me.
918877095077470208 2017-10-13 16:32:26 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter To think you use to be a newsman
917897188000141312 2017-10-10 23:38:37 UTC <Esteeb0582> @dpshow @andrewperloff They might have given away to much.  But can't know till we see it.
917896878829723648 2017-10-10 23:37:24 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper More likely some of them wanted to know which girl agreed to they could also invite them to rooms.
917896294860853248 2017-10-10 23:35:05 UTC <Esteeb0582> @POTUS @RepLowenthal No they are not.  But you won't Bargain with him.  He won he has a right to say what he wants you have a right to say no.
917896050882387969 2017-10-10 23:34:06 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RepLowenthal So I got your survey today.  You don't have options that I want to pick.  You don't seem ready to hear we don't support you
917535607034806272 2017-10-09 23:41:50 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Feels like we are stuck in place last 6 years of Obama and now again.  Just worry the new normal is just blocking the other party.
917533792348160000 2017-10-09 23:34:37 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly True but normally your party would try to work as one.  GOP is three groups though.  Trumpers, Teaparty, Traditional. Cant work together
917532692693925888 2017-10-09 23:30:15 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Given he isnt good at working with others at all that is clear.
917532618123390976 2017-10-09 23:29:57 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly He feels he won the national election they should follow his lead.  But hey wont so not a lot will come of congress if anything.
917524546885894144 2017-10-09 22:57:53 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly He was always a outsider this just proves outsiders cant change things.  Our system is too controlled by congress and they by money
917524211085697024 2017-10-09 22:56:33 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ReliableSources @brianstelter well I watched for 10 minutes before deleting your show.  To think I use to love it.
917434224952487936 2017-10-09 16:58:58 UTC <Esteeb0582> @DianneFeinstein You need to find someone else to take your place your part is the system that has failed us
916113814227001344 2017-10-05 01:32:08 UTC <Esteeb0582> @themouthmatusow Sure some of us live in woods and mountains or areas where help is far away and you have to defend yourself from things a handgun cant stop
915985310651056128 2017-10-05 17:01:30 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Nicholas_Merten Haha found at last
915798615536263172 2017-10-04 04:39:39 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MarkWarner Anyone mad at FB for letting a Russian company buy this add space?

915408450439364608 2017-10-03 02:49:16 UTC <Esteeb0582> @cut_50 @JessyMichele @NancyEMcFadden Wow I use to like you @VanJones68 but @JerryBrownGov has ruined CA to the point that most of us want to leave.
915405690373472256 2017-10-03 02:38:18 UTC <Esteeb0582> @johncusack So they worked harder that Her in those states also.
915311682896879616 2017-10-03 20:24:45 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Was not clear terms when they first did it.  Short after yes and that help but didnt change the initial feeling people had.
915296667565309952 2017-10-03 19:25:05 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Yup I agree they can do that just not sure I agree they picked the best place to do it.  It has started conversations so maybe it will help.
915288825605242880 2017-10-03 18:53:55 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Point is today the Anthem is a clear thank you to the military event.  So I hope you can see why it upsets us to protests during that
915288412759797760 2017-10-03 18:52:17 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly They wont do that due to the money they make each game.  Also not something I want
915278299395350528 2017-10-03 18:12:06 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly No my instructors.  They agreed to stand when that rule was put in place.  It became at that point a official NFL Military event.
915271321247916033 2017-10-03 17:44:22 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly It is not my place to tell others what to do.  But I can be offended by their actions.  I stand my friends stand.  We take off our hats.
915268844779855872 2017-10-03 17:34:32 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly You try to use this a lot.  They are doing bad stuff so I can right?  Not how I was raised but if that really works for you then your right.
915268555641208832 2017-10-03 17:33:23 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly No it has been played before almost all games sense 1942. Related to WWI and WWIIhttp://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/sep/25/short-history-national-anthem-and-sports/
915266282269708289 2017-10-03 17:24:21 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly No sir your wrong I said when and why the Anthem was added to the pregame.  Crowd has been standing sense WW2.
915244484220219394 2017-10-03 15:57:44 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly I agree with right to kneel just dont like it.  Anthem added before games after WW2 to remember those soldiers.  What it means to me.
915243138700124163 2017-10-03 15:52:23 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Given I like most dont have a union I dont always fully understand their power.  Sure it would be a hard one to pass.
915241685872893954 2017-10-03 15:46:36 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly I was not saying they could be fired now.  But that the NFL would have the right to change that rule to include termination.
915241149366812672 2017-10-03 15:44:29 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Well he is wrong to do that.  We all have a lot of freedoms.  There are still rules and laws we are suppose to follow.
915240283658264576 2017-10-03 15:41:02 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly I really do support the movement.Dont like the kneeling. They are free to do it but also agree NFL has right to make rules for employees.
915239865096093696 2017-10-03 15:39:22 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Yes they are at work.  In my job lots of actions are banned.  I am free to do them and they are free to fire me.They are breaking a NFL Rule
915237611928666112 2017-10-03 15:30:25 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly It is already banned by the NFL.  That is what he was referring to.  Again you connect very different issues.
915029503222571009 2017-10-02 01:43:28 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jo_kwon True
915028998631055360 2017-10-02 01:41:28 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RealKidPoker Simple Nation was born by men who used there guns to free themselves from a government that abused them.  They ensured that right to us.
914973335397703680 2017-10-02 22:00:17 UTC <Esteeb0582> @WillieJones Been a tough day
914251552147202048 2017-09-30 22:12:10 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Nicholas_Merten Cool maybe take another look at ARK
913057512680648708 2017-09-27 15:07:29 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly I really hope the conversation goes that directions and not into well he puts flags on shirts.  And thise guys put it on a napkin.
912710170563682305 2017-09-26 16:07:16 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly No I know both are wrong but they at not the same.  I am tried of people saying my bad behavior is okay cause he does it too.
912531015834337281 2017-09-25 04:15:22 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly The kneel while a real flag and anthem is being played.  Not the same at all as this.  But a bit of a point.
911723295585611776 2017-09-23 22:45:47 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish Your making that point is silly.  Where is the connection to Trump making these adds.

905938873657593856 2017-09-07 23:40:33 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MickD @KFIAM640 If this company steals Millions in Bitcoins  I told you about them first.
905832431952945152 2017-09-07 16:37:35 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MickD Why can't I get anyone to even look at my support ticket for 10 days are you going to steal my money? #poloniexlies
905076156134694913 2017-09-05 14:32:25 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @smerconish If that happened then it would end that day.  This way he is giving congress a way to listen to what we want and pass a real law.
905075890765185025 2017-09-05 14:31:22 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @smerconish Trump had to do this.  He is about to get sued over DACA and would have to defend it in court to keep it.  It could end up overturned.
905073867806277636 2017-09-05 14:23:20 UTC <Esteeb0582> @PressSec @brianstelter nice joke of a one side story.  What are the questions?  Over and over she is asked questions she can't answer at that time.
904583976869740546 2017-09-03 05:56:41 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Poloniex @WolfOfPoloniex so will my 2 day loan ever end up to 18 days now.  Support does nothing it seems.
904120251196915712 2017-09-02 23:14:00 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @cnn @FoxNews @KFIAM640  Big story here. @Poloniex Handles almost 200 million in cryptocurrency and they are not letting users withdraw it.
903663992777859075 2017-09-01 17:00:59 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Poloniex A company making so much money has such poor support?  I have a open ticket for days #416980 an no contact.  Others for weeks
903371484474646528 2017-08-31 21:38:40 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MickD Hello what is the issue with Poloniex support tickets don't get worked.  Is site just stealing coins?
903297227514249216 2017-08-31 16:43:36 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Poloniex I have a ticket open for a few days no and no response at all #416980 can someone look into this?
902379149037264897 2017-08-28 03:55:29 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter Ya well you earned it.  I use to love yours show can't even watch it anymore most times.  I still try cause I don't want to be in a bubble
900374858869100544 2017-08-23 15:11:09 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter Thanks for showing a picture but you know I did a google search for out many people attended and I can't find it.  I think that is the point
900122365207523328 2017-08-22 22:27:49 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN More will attend
900120742162976768 2017-08-22 22:21:23 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter You forgot that more watch on YouTube now and twitter feeds.  Ratings still solid but no doubt we care less about this war and that is sad
900092692918452224 2017-08-22 20:29:55 UTC <Esteeb0582> Join @RobinhoodApp and we'll both get a share of stock like $AAPL, $F, or $S for free. Make sure to use my link.http://share.robinhood.com/stepher47
899819579068661760 2017-08-21 02:24:40 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper You know he explain that he wanted to do that but has been convinced it would cause a lot of problems.  Why you hate on him leaning more.
899817109433098240 2017-08-21 02:14:51 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper So care to explain what the key demo was?  I highly doubt you made top 10 show on at that time
899436571924901889 2017-08-20 01:02:44 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Way late.  No not you other people that talk to me.  Sorry no real way you could know that.
899433166976434176 2017-08-20 00:49:12 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JoeySalads @brianstelter when will you cover this?  Let me know maybe I will watch that show.
899432619170869248 2017-08-20 00:47:01 UTC <Esteeb0582> @carlbernstein @ReliableSources Ya cause he wants to take away your power.
899432220749774848 2017-08-20 00:45:26 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter Couldn't get past the start of your show.  Your a fool.  So sad what has happened to CNN
899000922797350912 2017-08-19 20:11:37 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly I have tried to point this out.  They are not a movement.  They are just a few people that are very misguided.
898270158338220032 2017-08-17 19:47:49 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish I voted no and was worried that your crowd would be a yes results make me happy
895700934084313089 2017-08-10 17:38:38 UTC <Esteeb0582> I voted for #Drogon4MVP! Who's the #GoTMVP this week? Follow @AmazonChannels to see!https://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce54fa93f/4mn0d
894233931767099394 2017-08-06 16:29:18 UTC <Esteeb0582> @FareedZakaria Panel was a joke all anti Trump people.  Good job staying in your bubble.
894233764930371587 2017-08-06 16:28:38 UTC <Esteeb0582> @FareedZakaria Al Gore is a Hypocrite and you failed to call him out on it.  Do you also live in a mansion using tons of power?
892619571915505665 2017-08-01 05:34:24 UTC <Esteeb0582> A Lannister always pays her debts. I voted #Cersei4MVP! Who's the #GoTMVP? Follow @AmazonChannels to see the faves.https://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce54fa93f/4lnss
892082797707280384 2017-07-31 18:01:27 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Postmates How does the credit work I signed up but don't get it
892052826486165504 2017-07-31 16:02:22 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter Showing again you just done get it.  So disconnected from so much of the country.
891731474344329216 2017-07-30 18:45:25 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @ReliableSources  Not a good show.  Once again all hate on trump.  Every guest and you.  Oh well not sure why I watch.
890235336378339329 2017-07-26 15:40:18 UTC <Esteeb0582> @SenKamalaHarris @SenFeinstein @AGBecerra Lol at you lol
889849954553942016 2017-07-25 14:08:56 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jeffsessions @realDonaldTrump @MrMokelly If he didn't know that Trump goes after anyone he is not happy with... well he didn't pay very good attention.
889849481516138501 2017-07-25 14:07:03 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper Right cause you know about all the times they have talked.
889204936084533248 2017-07-23 19:25:52 UTC <Esteeb0582> @KellyannePolls @brianstelter Great job. Was a good back and forth but Kellyanne won that one for sure.  Talking about things that matter.
889204610380042242 2017-07-23 19:24:34 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @brianstelter Wow watch the whole interview.  She was great.  Brian you lost almost every point there.  But thanks for not editing it
889009556033904640 2017-07-22 06:29:29 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AshleyRParker No it isn't.  Point is the emails still exist.  She deleted hers and hide them.  His where around to be found and he released them.
886748147921244160 2017-07-16 00:43:28 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @ReliableSources If t brings lights to the illegal actions of someone who has been in power for years why does it matter where the info comes from?
885525548612464640 2017-07-13 15:45:17 UTC <Esteeb0582> @rogerwaters @smerconish So who is he referring to here?  I am not sure who has said let's just start killing people for no reason or by guessing
885331646341275649 2017-07-12 02:54:47 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNNTonight Really he was there for work.
885331250231169026 2017-07-12 02:53:13 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly That proved Hilary had done some illegal things with the Russian government.  Would we not want that to come out?
885331018843955200 2017-07-12 02:52:18 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly This one is rough.  I doubt he was aware of what he was doing but your right that might not matter.  Still if they had info.
884854308511952896 2017-07-11 19:18:01 UTC <Esteeb0582> @DonaldJTrumpJr @SXMPOTUS @smerconish They are right.  Story is a walk of time.
884789520280936450 2017-07-11 15:00:34 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Maybe more will come out but right now this looks like nothing more than a meeting that lead to nothing.
884789387963228160 2017-07-11 15:00:03 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly That story doesn't prove anything.  Again no names.  No copies of the email.  No proof the lawyer is connected to Russian government.
884788245287944193 2017-07-11 14:55:30 UTC <Esteeb0582> @SXMPOTUS @DonaldJTrumpJr @smerconish Ya I am with them for the most part they go a little far but this Russia story is a joke.  It is all much to do about nothing.
884609559565697026 2017-07-10 03:05:28 UTC <Esteeb0582> @nytimes @brianstelter It is a joke of a story already put to bed by his lawyer.  Just show how much hate is out there.  That this is even news
884517342100635648 2017-07-10 20:59:02 UTC <Esteeb0582> @SophiaBush @mattyglesias How you people remember meetings that had no point.  These people had 14 or more hours a day of meetings and events.
884495019586928644 2017-07-10 19:30:20 UTC <Esteeb0582> @DonaldJTrumpJr @smerconish Really someone claims to have info on a opponent you take the meeting.  And walk out if it is fake or they want to much for it.
884494560318992384 2017-07-10 19:28:30 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JohnAvlon @brianstelter They are jokes and funny.  You have had some fake stories and had to fire people for things done.   Brought it on yourself.
883055647368986624 2017-07-06 20:10:47 UTC <Esteeb0582> @redturn2 @Dodgers Vote JT #VoteJT #VoteMoose
881242241334861824 2017-07-01 20:04:57 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @brianstelter They are hiding the truth.  There is a lot of fraud.  Maybe joy enough to change a national seat but a local one for sure
881241431628693504 2017-07-01 20:01:44 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @ProPublica You make me laugh so much on this Brian.  Cause you are wrong.  It is just hidden well.  Now it might come to light.
881240870560735232 2017-07-01 19:59:30 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN Responding isn't bullying.  Don't start things if you can't take it.
881240528632729600 2017-07-01 19:58:09 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @Tom_Winter @jaketapper Good to see your spending your time on important stuff.
880479672676491264 2017-06-29 17:34:47 UTC <Esteeb0582> @chief3946 @MrMokelly Now in theory he might be under investigation for firing him.  But in the end he as president as the right to do that.
880479475082723328 2017-06-29 17:34:00 UTC <Esteeb0582> @chief3946 @MrMokelly Comey would not admit it to the public.  So on and on the story went.  That Trump was under investigation.  So he fried the guy.
880479253237710848 2017-06-29 17:33:07 UTC <Esteeb0582> @chief3946 @MrMokelly It is not that there are not investigations.  It is the idea that they are investigating Trump.  It was clear for months that was not true.
880457426964631552 2017-06-29 16:06:23 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish Not True.  Saudi is a "Ally" Iran openly opposes us at the highest levels. Deals with countries based on Government actions not small groups
880456744245186560 2017-06-29 16:03:40 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter Well fake news people got to stick together right
879915892649349120 2017-06-27 04:14:31 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly I will work on that.  Also still waiting for that story that proves any of this.
879914804319735808 2017-06-27 04:10:12 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Don't disbelieve everything but a few stories have been proved fake so it cast doubt on other.  How many just want ratings
879897017668968448 2017-06-27 02:59:31 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JoinTravisAllen @johnandkenshow I really hope he has a shot
879896078199382018 2017-06-27 02:55:47 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Ya sorry work got busy.  Still waiting but doubting more anything will come out.  All the fake stories are hurting any real ones.
879828596319059968 2017-06-27 22:27:38 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly I missed that.  Have still not seen any proven stories that Trump collusion happened.  Yes Russian did some things and tryed to do more.
879828093334044672 2017-06-27 22:25:38 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @smerconish You are the only CNN host I trust to tell the truth.  This is a issue for CNN.  They use to be my main source of news. Sad I can't trust CNN
879036199947485188 2017-06-25 17:58:56 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @ReliableSources @brianstelter I stopped watch a bunch of shows cause it was just 5 people talking about how bad trump is.
879036041163702273 2017-06-25 17:58:18 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ReliableSources @brianstelter You're not wrong on Fox and Friends.  But come on @CNN is the same just for the other view points.
878068923534409729 2017-06-22 01:55:19 UTC <Esteeb0582> @VeepHBO @brianstelter @RichburgGerald Yes that is a good point also.
878051396246880256 2017-06-22 00:45:40 UTC <Esteeb0582> @VeepHBO @brianstelter He is just trying to reinforce the fact that he feels he is telling the truth.  Few years from now you might start to get this
878051034345521152 2017-06-22 00:44:14 UTC <Esteeb0582> @VeepHBO @brianstelter When he says something like that.  He is just talking like he would with some friends. I am lying huh better hope I don't have tapes.
878050690714685441 2017-06-22 00:42:52 UTC <Esteeb0582> @VeepHBO @brianstelter Really man,  you and a lot of people on CNN way to into tweets.  You don't get that Trump is more of a normal guy than you think.
878016470407561216 2017-06-22 22:26:53 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Haha I never thought he had tapes.
877596685769166849 2017-06-21 18:38:49 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter No cause all you ask about is stories that don't matter with hidden sources.  It is getting old.
877351808938647552 2017-06-20 02:25:46 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TheThomasGuide I really hope not.  I can't handle this anymore living in CA they have just lost their minds.  Justice affected now ugh.
877215920577327105 2017-06-20 17:25:48 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter I didn't care to watch.  She lost me as a viewer on that Trump interview.  It was joke why would anything on this show be any better?
876687374763175937 2017-06-18 06:25:32 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter He was trying to point out how stupid that story was.  How crazy it is to be under investigation for doing something they wanted.
875180625208033280 2017-06-14 02:38:15 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN Really don't you guys call yourself the most trusted?  Such a joke
875153786985078785 2017-06-14 00:51:37 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @KatyTurNBC That is the lawyer it is a spokesman
875152742779506688 2017-06-14 00:47:28 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JasonBondPicks I looked into so many reviews called you someone leading a pumping scam I couldn't bring myself to pay to join your team just not sure
875152487514120192 2017-06-14 00:46:27 UTC <Esteeb0582> @washingtonpost @brianstelter Who do the source.  Hope this isn't more fake news you don't fact check
875029924507033601 2017-06-14 16:39:25 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @MrMokelly I am not super pro gun, I don't own guns.  I just am pointing out that you tried to use that tweet to justify yours and they are different
875022433891229696 2017-06-14 16:09:40 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @MrMokelly That message was the next morning and he was making a point.  And today lives where saved in part cause police with guns where there.
875018748058419200 2017-06-14 15:55:01 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @ShimonPro @jaketapper You know @cnn and you are part of this problem.  You don't openly condemn the people preaching violence.  It is scary what is heappening
875012030133968896 2017-06-14 15:28:19 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @MrMokelly See there people go using someone else bad behavior to justify yours is how we get to someone shooting someone else
875010653664141312 2017-06-14 15:22:51 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @MrMokelly This is the first time I have see you with a low blow.  Lost a little respect
874278274666438656 2017-06-12 14:52:38 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter All the fake stories that than come out will cast some doubt.  Some of the evidence would have to come out and be clear.
874065757637713920 2017-06-11 00:48:10 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter No it is to keep you watching.
872950253732810752 2017-06-08 22:55:33 UTC <Esteeb0582> @espn No
872949215369900032 2017-06-08 22:51:26 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @brianstelter This is not a direct attack.  Either way an American wins the presidency. At worse we get one nicer to Russia.Not not just nicer than other.
872847337118326786 2017-06-08 16:06:36 UTC <Esteeb0582> @BraddJaffy Going to point out he then said it was just cause in general he doesn't want to get into who did what here.
872846357584728064 2017-06-08 16:02:43 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @MrMokelly I am trying but I have a job.  So I had to miss some.  I will try to catch what I missed later. if Trump broke the law I can't support him
872844892942106624 2017-06-08 15:56:53 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @MrMokelly Presidents are not Dictators.  Trump can't just do what ever he wants.  And if he broke the law it was his job to stop that.
872844709240098816 2017-06-08 15:56:10 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @MrMokelly He is the head of the FBI not a just normal employee.  He should not take that job if he can't stand up to a president.
872842840480428032 2017-06-08 15:48:44 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @MrMokelly The word hope isn't a command.  Comey still did what he wanted to do.  I hope you can see that
872842214933536768 2017-06-08 15:46:15 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish Cause America also meddles with elections.  Unless they hacked a vote count doesn't matter.
871537938395312128 2017-06-04 01:23:31 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter While that was bad your slow became unwatchable for me.  And I was sad this show I use to love just uses hate now.
871033677895000066 2017-06-03 15:59:46 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @KennethLFisher @MrMokelly Again thanks for answering points taken no agreement but thanks.
870769473753501696 2017-06-02 22:29:55 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @KennethLFisher @MrMokelly I just am not for the coverage.  Why is this investigation so public?  Why so many leaks?  With no one charged why is it covered like this?
870769055866671104 2017-06-02 22:28:15 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @KennethLFisher @MrMokelly Pretty much all of your examples have a proven crime that lead to investigations.  Or a proven lie by a president.  I am for  investigation.
870754457767657472 2017-06-02 21:30:15 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @KennethLFisher @MrMokelly No if someone that works for you does something without your direction or knowledge before hand how can that land at your feet?
870749639242162176 2017-06-02 21:11:06 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @KennethLFisher @MrMokelly Okay might have missed this but who said they have seen a direct connection with Trump? I will go search for that info also.
870739270494937088 2017-06-02 20:29:54 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @CNN @KennethLFisher @MrMokelly I agree, he could tweet less, try to say on message.  But we are who we are.  He seems to have to fight  when he see what he calls fake news
870738798543478784 2017-06-02 20:28:01 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @KennethLFisher @MrMokelly I don't agree and I consider myself reasonable.  Everyone that has seen the connections have said Trump was no involved.
870705843242541057 2017-06-02 18:17:04 UTC <Esteeb0582> @KennethLFisher @CNN @MrMokelly see world keeps right on moving.
868866352840192000 2017-05-28 16:27:35 UTC <Esteeb0582> @mcuban Just a question.  Can you find one of Bush or Clinton?  Can't remember our presidents giving speeches like that.
868194996851163137 2017-05-26 19:59:52 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TomiLahren It is a big joke.  It will come out that all they did was talk to people from Russia cause well they called.  Taking a phone call is a crime
868135726663122944 2017-05-26 16:04:21 UTC <Esteeb0582> @seanhannity @smerconish Once again your poll results show problem.  People don't vote with logic.  The vote based on party
867835433106800640 2017-05-25 20:11:05 UTC <Esteeb0582> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @smerconish The fact that he gets any blame shows how much unfounded hate for trump
867790165510467584 2017-05-25 17:11:12 UTC <Esteeb0582> @HaleyJoelOsment @repjohnlewis It is not there job to show up not invited and badger people.  But yes they should be safe.
867789428562944000 2017-05-25 17:08:17 UTC <Esteeb0582> @WhitneyCummings Yes shirts with a good message or of a show I like gets you a little more like than you had before
867564290688954368 2017-05-24 02:13:40 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AGBecerra Ya so I am not wealthy and I had health insurance before.  Will after also cause well I work.
866821442385494016 2017-05-22 01:01:51 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TheThomasGuide Sad to say this will happen more and more.  We fight about so many dumb things here and don't truly push to end this.
866820789282013184 2017-05-22 00:59:15 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AC360 Hope you start to see this is world we live.  Flynn was fired let's move on and deal with this issue.  Who again has Flynn killed?
866818756235771904 2017-05-22 00:51:10 UTC <Esteeb0582> @28Pages @smerconish They don't chant Death to America or back Assad or openly work with anyone that attacks us. Some crazy people from there have attacked us.
866818133008367616 2017-05-22 00:48:42 UTC <Esteeb0582> @kylegriffin1 @JuddApatow going to talk about another bomb killing innocents?  Or to busy crying about Flynn
866676310948462594 2017-05-22 15:25:09 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @smerconish These polls always show me how one sided your followers are.
865958925862027264 2017-05-20 15:54:31 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter And you wonder why your network can't reach out to other people. @smerconish
865618256706420736 2017-05-19 17:20:49 UTC <Esteeb0582> @DRUDGE_REPORT Students will regret this.  I was just a liberal then I got a real job married and had a kid.  All the sudden my views grew up.
864866803117301760 2017-05-17 15:34:48 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter Pretty simple question, If the reporter broke a law should jail be off the table?
864866640520818688 2017-05-17 15:34:10 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @FBI @smerconish Thank you for a statement that uses logic.
864647129330925568 2017-05-16 01:01:54 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Lakers @MrMokelly Hey we do agree on something. #Lakers
864587952898269184 2017-05-16 21:06:45 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter No you won't cause we don't trust you anymore.  It is sad use to love your show but can't back you or anyone at CNN
863859668526841856 2017-05-14 20:52:49 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter what if Trump didn't do anything wrong in terms of Russia?  Could you then understand the Anger?  All you talk about a fake story
863858098993102848 2017-05-14 20:46:35 UTC <Esteeb0582> @johncusack Your understand to be an international businessman he has to deal with these people.  They are the players in that country.
863856948797620224 2017-05-14 20:42:00 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN Why is not challenged on the fact that Trump says he never said that?
863836126858981376 2017-05-14 19:19:16 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ReliableSources @BrianRFriedman Also emails that are true.  Proving that the Clinton campaign was getting debate questions ahead of time and other media favors.
863835736285618176 2017-05-14 19:17:43 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ReliableSources @BrianRFriedman Sure so you want to buy that Trump asked for help from Russia and they came up with a phishing email to hack the DNC and release emails?
863833069848940544 2017-05-14 19:07:07 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ReliableSources so for the first part of your show I have a question.  What is it you believe Russia did? I have seen no proof of anything
862795637686902784 2017-05-11 22:24:44 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly I just don't see it.  Trump makes some deal with Russia for help and they use a simple hack trick to get and release Podesta emails?
862795332966531073 2017-05-11 22:23:31 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly I see connections but none that seem that odd.  Trump is an international brand.  Others meet people while doing their jobs.
862794164286574592 2017-05-11 22:18:53 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly That is reaching.  Trump doesn't personally Vet people.  Flynn was a trusted guy so he hired him.Turns out he lied about talking to someone
862791175429775360 2017-05-11 22:07:00 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Do you have a link to this circumstantial stuff?  I have not seen much yet to connect Trump only Flynn.
862476063749820416 2017-05-10 01:14:52 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AC360 He is right I use to love CNN can't watch it anymore.  Cause you just are not even close to what matters to normal people anymore.
862473068328779776 2017-05-10 01:02:58 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter Seeing reports this is false story maybe you should remove
862472561212309504 2017-05-10 01:00:57 UTC <Esteeb0582> @elonmusk When can we get this?
861767713835827200 2017-05-08 02:20:08 UTC <Esteeb0582> @kwilli1046 @CNN @newyorktimes110 I hope you both take back these stories.
861745746038603776 2017-05-08 00:52:50 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish America meddles in other elections around the world.  I fail to see this as a big story.  What did they do again?
861744588637077508 2017-05-08 00:48:15 UTC <Esteeb0582> @johnandkenshow @ProdMichelle Hello is this the right person to support for gas tax repeal? carl@reformcalifornia.org Carl DeMaio?
858704541600038912 2017-04-30 15:28:11 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @ReliableSources tried to watch but gave up.  Once again 3 anti trump view points not letting the on pre trump guy talk.
858187139653156864 2017-04-28 05:12:13 UTC <Esteeb0582> @FoxNews @MrMokelly You know one is accused of rape the other harassment.  Both not right but not the same.  One also used drugs to do it.

852600282793992193 2017-04-13 19:12:02 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TomiLahren So I am late but sorry for what Blaze did. I really hope you find a new outlet soon.
846149323532353536 2017-03-26 23:58:14 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ReliableSources @brianstelter hope you drive around LA see what a state run by the left looks like.  Falling apart and full of homeless
846144249460510720 2017-03-26 23:38:04 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @ReliableSources @brianstelter so I use to love your show.  Today 5 minutes in I shut it off maybe for good.
845803671782801408 2017-03-25 01:04:44 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish You forgot young health people are broke.  Most are in debt and can get way they need at a drugstore.
840388091563016197 2017-03-10 02:25:09 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Redistrict @smerconish it is very hard to live in California now
837848808260132864 2017-03-03 02:14:57 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JetBlue thanks for letting me on a early flight after mine was delayed getting to the airport early paid off.  #thanks

836973083453874177 2017-03-01 16:15:07 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @smerconish the fact that people give it a F shows how hopeless they are.  They just want to fight.
836739386926510080 2017-02-28 00:46:30 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Uber_Support once again your support fails.  Same questions over and over you guys really don't care about drivers
836334873170173953 2017-02-27 21:59:06 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @realDonaldTrump @brianstelter @ReliableSources I have been watching this show for about 3 years but might be done. Sad and Fake
835907818544758785 2017-02-26 17:42:09 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter ya well you guys would just attack that person.  Stop judging and start debating
835906887610556416 2017-02-26 17:38:27 UTC <Esteeb0582> @wikileaks this is what drove me away from the party
835906508286128132 2017-02-26 17:36:56 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @CNN You are so wrong to say the fake stories are just mistakes.  Such a double standard you allow for you side.
835294958055649280 2017-02-24 01:06:51 UTC <Esteeb0582> Hungry? Get $15 off your first order on #UberEATS with my code: eats-stephenr1290ue. http://ubr.to/EatsGiveGet
835149631969353728 2017-02-24 15:29:23 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN yup left loved to protest free speech
835149015326961664 2017-02-24 15:26:56 UTC <Esteeb0582> @mcuban come on you know both sides push fake stories.
834490069033459712 2017-02-22 19:48:31 UTC <Esteeb0582> @BernieSanders Your wrong,  I am aware of lots of fraud votes.  People admit illegals have fake papers and means they can cast fake votes
833400212018196480 2017-02-19 19:37:49 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ReliableSources @SalenaZito @brianstelter such a great point.  Cause cable news just doesn't talk about the things I see everyday.
833384601439514624 2017-02-19 18:35:47 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ReliableSources @brianstelter I am a California Independent that voted for Trump.  I feel like the media is attacking me.  Attacking Trump
833384184403988480 2017-02-19 18:34:07 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ReliableSources @brianstelter Man parts of your show are great but still missing the main problem.  You guys do attack him that is true.
833006012370030593 2017-02-18 17:31:24 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @EliLake @juliettekayyem @smerconish Leaks at that level are not okay unless they show something hurting us.  Him talking isn't big
832785860026175488 2017-02-17 02:56:36 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish good show sorry missed the start
832783290914312198 2017-02-17 02:46:23 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish is it possible to modernize voting.  If we could do it on a App everyone would vote in primaries.

830857141548306432 2017-02-12 19:12:33 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ChrisRuddyNMX @CNN thank you Chris the show was so one sided and crazy before you came on
830853721307246592 2017-02-12 18:58:58 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @ReliableSources this is a joke your show is becoming a joke
830495380462673921 2017-02-11 19:15:03 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AGBecerra so can I break laws too if I am not a "threat" to anyone?  Clearly your okay with identity fraud can I have your SS number?
830276159866744832 2017-02-10 04:43:56 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @Niki3911 @evanrachelwood how about adding she was committing identity fraud that's why she was deported
830258514392080385 2017-02-10 03:33:49 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Uber_Support at this point your going to lose a driver cause I can't talk to anyone that cares.  Clear you abuse drivers
830190745747234817 2017-02-10 23:04:32 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Uber_Support you keep saying that i keep filling these out and you keep doing nothing
830186836592975872 2017-02-10 22:49:00 UTC <Esteeb0582> @UberEats @Uber_Support @GaryandShannon Uber can be pretty shady to drivers.
830186622780010496 2017-02-10 22:48:09 UTC <Esteeb0582> @UberEats @Uber_Support @UberEATS @uber How can I be denied my promotion pay for not being at 80% acceptance when life time I am at 100%. Lies you liepic.twitter.com/HFd4QCRga2
828697574257221632 2017-02-06 20:11:12 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @rezaaslan He doesn't always fact check.  He takes the other side.  Sometime Trump is wrongn other times he just assumes he is
828469603118436352 2017-02-05 05:05:20 UTC <Esteeb0582> @billmaher you wanted the Falcons now I get how that happened.
828298851618414592 2017-02-05 17:46:49 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ReliableSources @brianstelter thumps down
828298526090080256 2017-02-05 17:45:32 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @MichaelWolffNYC @CNN @cclcen typical you insult cause you can't do anything else
828298355352629248 2017-02-05 17:44:51 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Evan_McMullin @CNN @brianstelter has it been so long sense you seen someone challenge a person and what they did it scares you this much?
828298217557069824 2017-02-05 17:44:18 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Evan_McMullin @CNN @brianstelter it is not him going after a branch of government it is going after that one person that disagrees.
828298042398830592 2017-02-05 17:43:36 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Evan_McMullin @ReliableSources @CNN @brianstelter this was a joke.  Don't you get yet Trump is going to fight back against anyone.
828297700311330816 2017-02-05 17:42:15 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JuddApatow boy can I fail like him billionaire who becomes president
828297275629662209 2017-02-05 17:40:34 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @edatpost @brianstelter what should we call people who don't have legal status when taking about the group?
828292131731050496 2017-02-05 17:20:07 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @MichaelWolffNYC @CNN Wolff is destroying you.  Fact that you don't see the fake hysteria is a joke.
828291831402160128 2017-02-05 17:18:56 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter yes cause it is so important to see a comic making fun of someone for doing there job
828290960656183299 2017-02-05 17:15:28 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter Stop using ORC polls without more info.  They where very wrong on the election why should I believe them now.
828142437147107328 2017-02-04 07:25:17 UTC <Esteeb0582> @NYDailyNews @VanJones68 Your very right to share this.  Democratic Party is going away if they don't change.
825940233011159042 2017-01-29 05:34:31 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Thanks again for answering will still listen to you cause I want to keep hearing the other sides of things.
825929340558864384 2017-01-29 04:51:14 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Yupe not a Muslim ban but if they are not on any list then at this point we can't stop them from getting in.
825929074795122692 2017-01-29 04:50:11 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly no they are not but France is ally.They should be able to help us avoid them from getting in.  These countries don't do that.
825928002944905216 2017-01-29 04:45:55 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly i understand you can't stop all.  But that doesn't mean our leaders shouldn't be able to try and stop some if done right.
825926857006551040 2017-01-29 04:41:22 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly but I agree with you that green card holders and citizens should not be stopped that was a mistake.
825926701959884802 2017-01-29 04:40:45 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly no but support the idea of better screening that might avoid this.  And if the bans are temp while that is worked out I am fine
825925966098681856 2017-01-29 04:37:49 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly some of the attackers are sons of refugees or immigrants that if we had stopped would have stopped those attacks.
825916912198524928 2017-01-29 04:01:51 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly To say that no refugees have done terrorist attacks. Without noting 1st generation Americans of refugees have is wrong.
825758992307671040 2017-01-29 17:34:20 UTC <Esteeb0582> @stephenjadler @OTMBrooke @joelpollak @lpolgreen @MattGarrahan @ReliableSources @brianstelter you never quote the current policy
825389768955490305 2017-01-28 17:07:10 UTC <Esteeb0582> @SophiaBush no he openly challenged pinons paper that has been biased against him for two years. Their opinion pieces tore him apart
825219914453495810 2017-01-27 05:52:14 UTC <Esteeb0582> @SenWarren @JuddApatow also a country with broken down streets.  Drug problems,  lack of good jobs.  So many issues today.
825211167610015744 2017-01-27 05:17:28 UTC <Esteeb0582> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @smerconish nope you can be in the middle.  Voted for Obama twice now trump cause I grew up
825195041710694400 2017-01-27 04:13:23 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Uber_Support Tonight was very bad.  Call in support lies and all my fares missing the bonus you emailed me.  Hours of wasted time
825109822286684166 2017-01-27 22:34:46 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ColMorrisDavis @ryan_san @FoxNews Wrong It would be paid by the company making it. Passed to us only if they raise price and we still buy.
825106461512458242 2017-01-27 22:21:24 UTC <Esteeb0582> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @smerconish I hope your polls show how one sided your followers are.  glad to always be on the losing side
825048495719473152 2017-01-27 18:31:04 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Bikers4Liberty @notbuyingthat54 @TheDemocrats @HillaryClinton @WashTimes @brianstelter oh so there is still no proof?
825048091304742912 2017-01-27 18:29:28 UTC <Esteeb0582> @vicenews have pictures like that will make it hard to take you serious you come off as young kids who don't really know the world yet
824743713574264832 2017-01-26 22:19:58 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JK_Columbus he woke up saw the story saying on 250k people showed up.  That was a fake story was his point.  Just that one story was fake.
824743386439507968 2017-01-26 22:18:40 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JK_Columbus given the back photo at the right time did show less people there.  But not that empty.  Again the point is he said what I saw
824743109040840705 2017-01-26 22:17:34 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JK_Columbus where you there?  If not you can't know that for sure that photo your taking about was proved to be early in the day.
824716784401944576 2017-01-26 20:32:58 UTC <Esteeb0582> @seanhannity @seanspicer @brianstelter @JK_Columbus yes he was talking about the crowd he saw.  From the front you see no empty spaces.
824687192790282240 2017-01-26 18:35:23 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter see you guys blew it. https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/opinion/how-to-save-cnn-from-itself.html?referer=
824679115194118144 2017-01-26 18:03:17 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RamCNN @brianstelter @CNNMoney Sorry but CNN openly attacked him. Had members try to help Hilary win. Why should he or any of us trust you?
824667633844752384 2017-01-26 17:17:40 UTC <Esteeb0582> @BernieSanders @washingtonpost no for starters it isn't gifts when they pay for a service.  Also it isn't going directly to him
824655504366448640 2017-01-26 16:29:28 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Trevornoah you assume he would lose?  He is doing what he said he would.  Companies are coming back.  He will win again at this pace
824633749153275905 2017-01-26 15:03:01 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JoyAnnReid @SenFeinstein @wilw @danielschuman I doubt that cause Trump would destroy that person.
824490455823904769 2017-01-25 05:33:37 UTC <Esteeb0582> @SenFeinstein @wilw @JoyAnnReid you do understand they only need 51 votes for him cause if what the Dems did.  So it won't matter.
824489807631953920 2017-01-25 05:31:03 UTC <Esteeb0582> @nytimes @jaketapper did they riot?
824149703407370241 2017-01-24 06:59:35 UTC <Esteeb0582> @BarackObama @VanJones68 Sorry you think this is a fight.  Voted for him twice now voted for Trump.  Dems lost me for life.
824131663630401536 2017-01-24 05:47:54 UTC <Esteeb0582> @elonmusk How how many miles will you be able to put on A Telsa 3 before it is time for a new one?
824094182692175872 2017-01-24 03:18:58 UTC <Esteeb0582> @seanhannity @seanspicer @brianstelter Do you think he was wrong?  With Internet of today and more access I am positive he is right.
824064990202118144 2017-01-24 01:22:58 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @beckerdavidj @AC360 @CNN you still have no idea.  You will learn one day my friend.  I still know a guy who voted 30 times
823621540897902592 2017-01-23 20:00:52 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter agree with him the story line is always negative
823619390692130816 2017-01-23 19:52:19 UTC <Esteeb0582> @PressSec @brianstelter he is doing great.  Also like I told you he was talking about global viewership you need to apologize
823564415219822592 2017-01-23 16:13:52 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TMZ @HarveyLevinTMZ Yes the left don't debate the call names, throw bottles, sucker punch, and when asked say oh I didn't vote.
823562393263321088 2017-01-23 16:05:50 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNNMoney @PressSec @brianstelter CNN keeps lying about what he said listen to the full quote he was taking about TV, internet and mall
823561966425755648 2017-01-23 16:04:08 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @jaketapper @KellyannePolls Or just correcting herself.  @cnn you guys use to be so good.  Such a joke now CNN
823561691589844992 2017-01-23 16:03:02 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brithume Omg thank you I keep trying to tell everyone that he was talking about worldwide crowd not the people at the mall
823561518281199616 2017-01-23 16:02:21 UTC <Esteeb0582> @blakehounshell @brianstelter Point out what you said.  That more people watched on TV, Internet, and attending than ever before combined
823561039832678400 2017-01-23 16:00:27 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish the full statement said more people attended, watched on TV and Internet than ever before.  Do you know for sure that is false
823559995123855360 2017-01-23 15:56:18 UTC <Esteeb0582> @billhandelshow @TheThomasGuide     Please explain to Him this fact below.  Also she meant they have other facts that prove another point.
823559194187952128 2017-01-23 15:53:07 UTC <Esteeb0582> @billhandelshow Your being to hard on Spencier listen to full comment he used laywer speak.  Said more people attended,watched on TV and web
823395743801053185 2017-01-22 05:03:37 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jheil @brianstelter @CNNMoney could she have been trying to say counter points.  Like he had numbers aka facts to prove his statement?
823378307781562369 2017-01-22 03:54:20 UTC <Esteeb0582> @FoxNewsSunday Trump will win a fight with the media cause media twist and lies a lot.  Hold on to small facts instead of seeing big idea.
823370034521116673 2017-01-22 03:21:28 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ryan_san @Swohtz man you guys go at it but try not to use personal attacks we don't know each other enough to do that.
823353765327605762 2017-01-22 02:16:49 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ryan_san @Swohtz sorry I thought we where done.  Time will tell with Trump it is that simple.  So far I like what he has done.  But early.
823278189786972161 2017-01-22 21:16:30 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ryan_san I won't defend him if he doesn't do the things he has said he would do.  Or they just help the rich.
823277963051315201 2017-01-22 21:15:36 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ryan_san all of them also have some experience in those fields.  Also it is day 2 let him govern for a few months.
823277574931423232 2017-01-22 21:14:04 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ryan_san you understand he has to play nice with GOP cause he needs congress to do the things he wants.
823274960055463936 2017-01-22 21:03:40 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ryan_san his Cabinet is full of smart people who do business on a global scale.  But they won't get to guide direction Trump will.
823274658480865280 2017-01-22 21:02:28 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ryan_san that is a dumb point.  Under current trade laws to compete he has to make his stuff overseas.  He wants to change that.
823272456366370816 2017-01-22 20:53:43 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ryan_san he wants to fix trade to protect American jobs.  He wants to put term limits in place on congress and stop lobbying.
823272097099096064 2017-01-22 20:52:18 UTC <Esteeb0582> @leslie_hendryx @ryan_san Cause he wants to fix our system that doesn't protect Americans.  He has made that clear to me.
823269530109550592 2017-01-22 20:42:06 UTC <Esteeb0582> @leslie_hendryx @ryan_san there is no law saying he has to do that. Tried of people trying to make him do things he doesn't have to.
823261133398163456 2017-01-22 20:08:44 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TomiLahren @leslie_hendryx @ryan_san @ his tax rate is his business imo.  If he gave less to charity than others doesn't bother me.
823257803326255104 2017-01-22 19:55:30 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @TomiLahren @leslie_hendryx @ryan_san from what I know most of this money goes to the RNC not to Trump.
823257636917362689 2017-01-22 19:54:50 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TomiLahren @leslie_hendryx @ryan_san I will give you that is a good point but hard to say they should have to pull their kid out of school.
823257412178100224 2017-01-22 19:53:57 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @TomiLahren @leslie_hendryx @ryan_san what will you learn from a tax return that we don't know from financial disclosure?
823257237476896768 2017-01-22 19:53:15 UTC <Esteeb0582> @leslie_hendryx @ryan_san He said that any money made from Foreign governments staying at his hotels will be giving to the government.
823253758922526721 2017-01-22 19:39:26 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @TomiLahren @ryan_san @leslie_hendryx he is also giving money from his hotels to the government but these people don't care.
823253323981602816 2017-01-22 19:37:42 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @TomiLahren @ryan_san see other side loves to just attack.
823246056548765698 2017-01-22 19:08:49 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter I can promise you we don't care about his tax return
823245204064829440 2017-01-22 19:05:26 UTC <Esteeb0582> @TomiLahren @brianstelter You should know this is true.  Trump supporter in California has also had to hide my support at times.
823243507280134145 2017-01-22 18:58:41 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JesseBWatters @jessebwatters by far your breakdown of the speech was the best I saw.  For me it was a great speech so the other coverage confused me.
823241242582450179 2017-01-22 18:49:41 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter Do you have any idea on that.  I am sure the international crowd was big.
823241055344599040 2017-01-22 18:48:57 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter Also if you count TV, Internet, and crowd size it is possible that his statement was right and this was the most watched ever.
823240844257832961 2017-01-22 18:48:07 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter If he reported the numbers he had then calling it a lie is wrong.  It might have been a mistake.
823240595812425728 2017-01-22 18:47:07 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @BrookeBCNN @brianstelter cause you did.  Sure he made some statements about the leaks and was upset.  You covered as a fight.
823239042145759233 2017-01-22 18:40:57 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @ReliableSources again your show feels like a show attacking Trump.  You bring up points for him and they dismiss them.
823229787611140096 2017-01-22 18:04:10 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper he also was correct that the story he only had 250,000 people there was a lie.  I had at least 3 people tell me that story.
823229562095955968 2017-01-22 18:03:17 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper There is a story going out there that people don't support Trump.  So he is trying to prove them wrong.
823228992207454208 2017-01-22 18:01:01 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper if you include TV and Internet is it not possible this was the most watched?  Are you sure?
823228509187256321 2017-01-22 17:59:06 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper don't like how you cut everything to suit your needs.  Your trying to start fights.
822113672361365504 2017-01-19 16:09:08 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper So what.
821811559924043776 2017-01-18 20:08:39 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNNMoney @brianstelter they do without knowing it.  Polls that claim that much with small sample size are a joke.
820683213962027008 2017-01-15 17:25:00 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @ReliableSources Very good job. Loved that you back to doing the things that got me watching you.
820682602788990976 2017-01-15 17:22:34 UTC <Esteeb0582> @PageSix @brianstelter @jonswaine @dmartosko @BuzzFeedNews why not I get drug tested to get a job.
820680924509585409 2017-01-15 17:15:54 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @ReliableSources really why is it news that FBI is briefs the President about a document full of lies?
820679917482323969 2017-01-15 17:11:54 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @ReliableSources Such a joke to defend Buzzfeed at all they where in the wrong.  This stuff isn't news.
820027629419917312 2017-01-13 21:59:56 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Uber_Support so I have to open a ticket for each rider to get my correct Fare fix this please it is taking up a lot of my time
819632895039934464 2017-01-12 19:51:24 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Uber_Support Fare issues figured out at last.  Went to support location got no help took 6 tickets and I figured it out on my own.Do Better
819570551706353664 2017-01-12 15:43:41 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNNMoney @CNN waste of time and tax money.  Republicans won't pass it.  She should be working with them to shape their plans not this.
819569514371162112 2017-01-12 15:39:33 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @jaketapper Guys I use to watch CNN every day.  The past year has shown me CNN has lost credibility.  You need to fix that.
819569175278460928 2017-01-12 15:38:12 UTC <Esteeb0582> @SenSanders @LunaBrandes Trump agrees with you on this senator Sanders help him fix it please.
819315121847549952 2017-01-11 22:48:41 UTC <Esteeb0582> @vicenews oh come on he talked about separation from his business
818973164420009985 2017-01-10 00:09:52 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Uber_Support came into a support center they can't do anything to fix.  waybill shows wrong rate.  I feel lied to.  #uberlies

817099498321121280 2017-01-05 20:04:36 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Uber_Support @UberEats @AronBender Say the real rate was $4.50 plus $1.10 a mile. They took away a mile cause they don't know Disney areapic.twitter.com/rUpsP5IY3g

817093613536448512 2017-01-05 19:41:12 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Uber_Support I have opened two support tickets they close them right away.  Tell me to go into a support center.  Ignore my waybill.
817091539771887616 2017-01-05 19:32:58 UTC <Esteeb0582> @UberEats @Uber_Support @UberEATS fake driver rates. Told  $2 per mile when signed up 2 days later cut to $1.10?  Won't pay me what is on waybill!!
817070441932017665 2017-01-05 18:09:08 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Uber_Support so far they are telling me the rate I was told when I signed up was wrong it seems.  Oh well back to doordash
817044896661925888 2017-01-05 16:27:37 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Uber_Support okay I did that hope someone can fix this or explain it better than in app support.
817030712368906245 2017-01-05 15:31:16 UTC <Esteeb0582> @UberEats @elonmusk @UberEATS Rates is a lie only got paid 1.10 per mile. When I signed up was told I would get rate on the waybill 2 per mile.pic.twitter.com/FOjT3Lp7lt
816679399630114818 2017-01-04 16:15:16 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Sorry the trolls come out thanks for answering.  What I can't find but will look for is the connection to the leak.
816533912537042944 2017-01-03 06:37:09 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly yes that is true.  At the same time Wikileaks's doesn't leak lies.  So he makes some points. It still seems small issue to me.
816527875440398337 2017-01-03 06:13:10 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Have you seen the Assange interview?  Given he can lie but if not why are we going after Russia?
815402699885662208 2016-12-31 03:42:07 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly Just not the level that some are taking it.  I have not seen data that supports the idea the Podesta hack changed votes.
814900992143605764 2016-12-30 18:28:31 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly agree with you fake debate.  At the same time DNC is not a government entity.  So a private group got hacked not our government
811087908601872384 2016-12-19 05:56:41 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish wow first time in a while that I am on the winning side
811037683745112064 2016-12-19 02:37:06 UTC <Esteeb0582> @EricLiptonNYT @nytimes @JuddApatow Do you all feel it is not possible to work with Russia?  We have a common enemy.  Why hate Russia?
809465484387098624 2016-12-15 18:29:45 UTC <Esteeb0582> @KFIAM640 @billhandelshow @MrMokelly missed it was it good
808806053957599232 2016-12-13 22:49:24 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JuddApatow @pattonoswalt I forgot how many people did the hacking kill?  Oh ya none grow up.
806682728527589376 2016-12-07 02:12:04 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter So what in that would you disagree with?  Or just sharing?
805206263717998592 2016-12-03 00:25:07 UTC <Esteeb0582> @BernieSanders didn't he just help save some jobs?  What do you want him to have done at this point?
805206018544123905 2016-12-03 00:24:09 UTC <Esteeb0582> @SarahKSilverman I feel like he is doing a good job so far.  Waiting for a few more things but no disappointments yet.
803626372866260992 2016-11-29 15:47:12 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AMCTalkingDead like the world is getting bigger but the story is going slower #thewalkingdead
802907078276751360 2016-11-27 16:08:59 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ReliableSources Need more news and less opinion people.  Cover was is done more and less what is said.
801285146599038977 2016-11-22 04:44:00 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN You know your national polls where pretty wrong this year.
801282713881714689 2016-11-22 04:34:20 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @smerconish the results of your polls just prove people seem to follow those that agree with them.  Still like you.
800729297820360705 2016-11-21 15:55:16 UTC <Esteeb0582> @HiddenCash vodka redbull?
800438913911263232 2016-11-20 20:41:23 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @jaketapper Another Cop dies for no reason in Texas. Close friend is part of San Antonio PD.  Please start to stand with cops.
800397552981983232 2016-11-20 17:57:01 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Reince @jaketapper He will soften but not till that wall is being built and we stop protection of criminals.
800397231635329024 2016-11-20 17:55:45 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RepTimRyan @jaketapper look at the count in the house.  I am a Democratic that voted for Republicans this time cause my party is lost.
800388340440698881 2016-11-20 17:20:25 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @jaketapper what happened right there is my biggest issue with CNN. Grab a hearsay moment from the past to describe a person.
800384841816518656 2016-11-20 17:06:31 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Mediaite @brianstelter @benshapiro Ya that was the best point made.  Too much made of too little
800383278007992321 2016-11-20 17:00:18 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ReliableSources @brianstelter He made so many points that are in my head.  I can't believe the things that get covered sometimes.
800377118869704705 2016-11-20 16:35:50 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ReliableSources @brianstelter That was good.  I feel like if there was more straight news on 24 hour networks we would be better.
800375863464239104 2016-11-20 16:30:50 UTC <Esteeb0582> @pattonoswalt @Khanoisseur it is cause he is worth billions.  Cause he built a building with a loan to pay it off over time is normal.
800374901647343616 2016-11-20 16:27:01 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter The comment about equal time has more meaning.  It is just pointing out more liberal side of the media and he is right.
800370320720826368 2016-11-20 16:08:49 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter artistic expression does not give them the right to call him out with no chance to respond.
800250206193188865 2016-11-20 08:11:31 UTC <Esteeb0582> @infowars @VanJones68 that was very good.  Van Jones you just why you get to talk on CNN but bring this more.
800234074275069953 2016-11-19 07:07:25 UTC <Esteeb0582> @PoppyHarlowCNN @brianstelter @sree possible he is just picking best man for the job and they happen to be white?
800233021488017408 2016-11-19 07:03:14 UTC <Esteeb0582> @zoeinthecities @JuddApatow @ACLU @EricLiptonNYT He is not president yet.  So he is trying up business deals and closing up shop?  Could be?
800232239623651328 2016-11-19 07:00:08 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JuddApatow Voting early can make you miss something last new weeks.  Same day can lead to fraud.  I see the points.  Other ways to handle?
800231845237395457 2016-11-19 06:58:34 UTC <Esteeb0582> @SarahKSilverman @dantechristian His infrastructure plan to rebuild inner cities would include Flint but keep attacking him if it helps you
800231366591791104 2016-11-19 06:56:40 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @nytimes maybe they are stunned at the descent before they do anything.
800128101619408896 2016-11-19 00:06:19 UTC <Esteeb0582> @smerconish I can't seeing him say he had to sell his company the kids should be able to run it.  Then make sure he doesn't help it.
800107801917865985 2016-11-19 22:45:39 UTC <Esteeb0582> @GovPenceIN @HamiltonMusical @smerconish man I am always in the minority on your polls.
799834214598180865 2016-11-18 04:38:31 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ReliableSources @brianstelter good luck hoping for your show to get back to must watch.
799832252494381056 2016-11-18 04:30:43 UTC <Esteeb0582> @SenWarren @JuddApatow Super delegates, Her lies, and not even trying to win the rust belt.  You Party lost this.
799831826223071233 2016-11-18 04:29:02 UTC <Esteeb0582> @nytimes @VanJones68 @stefcutter sorry I will give him another chance soon but the whitelash comment hurt me.  Drove me away from CNN
799336258648428544 2016-11-17 19:39:49 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @brianstelter @cnn Cover this? https://twitter.com/donaldtrumpnewz/status/799311493883793409
799316852795027457 2016-11-17 18:22:42 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @BernieSanders he is banning lobbyists as a start.  Don't stand in his way till the does something to earn it.  Help fix trade.
799315281994661888 2016-11-17 18:16:28 UTC <Esteeb0582> @HouseDemocrats @RepBecerra would this change who won?  Please move forward.
799280650708664321 2016-11-17 15:58:51 UTC <Esteeb0582> @cnni @HalaGorani @brianstelter Are the lying?  He says they are.  Why should he not attack fake or false stories?
799280468369625088 2016-11-17 15:58:08 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @brianstelter You are making a big deal out of nothing.  Many past presidents have done the same.  Once again the double standard.
799280088650915840 2016-11-17 15:56:37 UTC <Esteeb0582> @StephenBannon @smerconish @JimmyTusheets @dst88dz LA has had smaller fires and looting.  And blocking ambulance lead to death of one man.
799107810311086081 2016-11-16 04:32:03 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @StephenBannon @BreitbartNews @smerconish sad people won't give him a chance so much hate in the world
798966956082610177 2016-11-16 19:12:21 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RWTQuotes @JuddApatow he hasn't named anyone to a position yet other than 1 insider and one outsider.  Can you wait for more to come out?
798931224932691968 2016-11-16 16:50:22 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter What if there "facts" are wrong?  If Trump never did ask for clearance for his children then the wrote a story about a lie.
798719342904913920 2016-11-15 02:48:25 UTC <Esteeb0582> @BuzzFeedBen @jaketapper @BuzzFeedNews Best thing you have put out in a while Jake Tapper
798717369090600960 2016-11-15 02:40:34 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @RiggsReport @realDonaldTrump so is the press suppose to go with him everywhere?
798687996966944768 2016-11-15 00:43:52 UTC <Esteeb0582> @dylanlscott @brianstelter @BuzzFeedNews Brian what part of this man's views are racists or sexist?  Reading this he just seems smart.
798664596399624192 2016-11-15 23:10:52 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RepBecerra Please stop.  He won your attacking 60 million people that voted for his message and policies.  We don't love the messenger.
798557307789418496 2016-11-15 16:04:33 UTC <Esteeb0582> @thefix @SXMPOTUS @smerconish Part of this is people with advanced degree have good Jobs.  They don't feel the pain of the people who don't
798398142811086849 2016-11-14 05:32:05 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN This isn't right but people are going to get mad.  The thought is most of the people protesting didn't even vote.  So Sad
798379889531318273 2016-11-14 04:19:33 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @kayleighmcenany @VanJones68 @AC360 Sorry once again Everyone picking on Kayleigh.  They do that to you a lot.
798376082256691200 2016-11-14 04:04:25 UTC <Esteeb0582> @billmaher http://milo.yiannopoulos.net/2016/11/illegal-immigrants-3-million-votes/. Might be fake hope it is proved wrong or true
798375669935677440 2016-11-14 04:02:47 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @brianstelter @cnn @seanhannity Is this a fake story? http://milo.yiannopoulos.net/2016/11/illegal-immigrants-3-million-votes/ if not will you cover it?
798374635716767747 2016-11-14 03:58:40 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Yes
798279441805766658 2016-11-14 21:40:24 UTC <Esteeb0582> @kurteichenwald @JuddApatow He talked to the leader of Britain but don't expect you to give him credit for that.  Also Israel.
798237275347763200 2016-11-14 18:52:51 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNNPolitics @brianstelter I agree with him.  Just cause he runs a far right site doesn't mean he is racist he doesn't write that stuff
798197498208653312 2016-11-14 16:14:48 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter I never see CNN talk about the proof.  Why is that? I assume they verify but I wonder myself if they really do.
798194308616593409 2016-11-14 16:02:07 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JuddApatow @SarahKSilverman There is no law forcing him to show his taxes.  I am not sure if he will show them.  I don't personally care.
798004833659731968 2016-11-13 03:29:13 UTC <Esteeb0582> @themouthmatusow @MattGlantz your so right what I told my friends they didn't buy it
797931191345115136 2016-11-13 22:36:35 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper @CNN @brianstelter If she is not willing to come on your show and say these things today stop reporting it.
797928704374489088 2016-11-13 22:26:42 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @brianstelter @jaketapper This is the problem with you guys right now.  I really don't care what the ex wife of someone said.
797917880121638913 2016-11-13 21:43:41 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly I get some people are scared but also some people are more hopeful than they have ever been.  Both sides should be able to react
797917449857314820 2016-11-13 21:41:59 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly it was such a close election to say one side can't say they are happy or celebrate is wrong.  He should be able to thank voters
797898806658371584 2016-11-13 20:27:54 UTC <Esteeb0582> @MrMokelly What was wrong with that?  Why can't he and his supporters be happy that he won?
797898334446895104 2016-11-13 20:26:01 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNNMoney @brianstelter The New York Times attacked him and was unfair so not bugged at all he isn't Happy with them
797879517339525120 2016-11-13 19:11:15 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper I didn't like the show today.  So much fighting still.  Hoping for more points of view going forward.
797879106398363648 2016-11-13 19:09:37 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter I love the mission to debunk fake news.  Also understand partisan new also needs to be dialed back on serious news shows.
797849851086049280 2016-11-13 17:13:22 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ReliableSources @brianstelter The start was great but the panel was lopsided again and the girl from the Federalist made the best points.
797843803482693632 2016-11-13 16:49:20 UTC <Esteeb0582> @Rosental @brianstelter @realDonaldTrump @nytimes that newspaper doesn't do new anymore on the front page.
797843331216588803 2016-11-13 16:47:28 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter We don't fear the truth.  But we want you to cover the real issues not the ones you think matter only.
797672014999744512 2016-11-12 05:26:43 UTC <Esteeb0582> @katyperry @TheAnonnMessage you sent out a fake story please take it down and retract that is not LA
797526002192613376 2016-11-12 19:46:30 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JuddApatow @RealRonHoward If she didn't break rules. Have secrets and lie to us so much then she wouldn't have had those issues
797512797017903104 2016-11-12 18:54:02 UTC <Esteeb0582> @pattonoswalt @melgillman @politico so you want to start a civil war?  break down the way our system work
797130262375067648 2016-11-11 17:33:59 UTC <Esteeb0582> @leitmotivated Ya have a good one.  I  really hope you are wrong.  That over time people will see he has some ideas that will help us all.
797126430769352705 2016-11-11 17:18:45 UTC <Esteeb0582> @leitmotivated if you don't want to show him respect I can't make you but he will still be president.  If you want to protest peaceful fine
797126146127081472 2016-11-11 17:17:37 UTC <Esteeb0582> @leitmotivated he did question this once but not during the campaign your just making stuff up now
797125940140654593 2016-11-11 17:16:48 UTC <Esteeb0582> @leitmotivated popular vote doesn't matter for president.  It is not that kind of race.  It is a race in each state.
797125652503666688 2016-11-11 17:15:40 UTC <Esteeb0582> @leitmotivated I don't know why the KKK is so happy Trump has said he didn't want their support more than once.
797117636278554624 2016-11-11 16:43:48 UTC <Esteeb0582> @leitmotivated And as of today no one has shown me anything that proved Donald Trump is Racist or has plans to do anything racist.
797117448277196800 2016-11-11 16:43:04 UTC <Esteeb0582> @leitmotivated I just don't like people who just assume.  I voted to Obama twice Never for Bush.  I just also couldn't vote for Hilary
797117239392497665 2016-11-11 16:42:14 UTC <Esteeb0582> @leitmotivated I will not pretend that there not some Racist people out there.  Still most move forward with him.
797097056703655936 2016-11-11 15:22:02 UTC <Esteeb0582> Also if you are or where in the Military thank you for your service.
797096310964817920 2016-11-11 15:19:04 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNNMoney @brianstelter I am not blaming anyone. I can over look words when he has apologized for them.  I won't if he continues
797095880528510976 2016-11-11 15:17:21 UTC <Esteeb0582> @leitmotivated Did you see Republicans out on the streets burning stuff?  Or any new people saying this is a blacklash against whites?
796933912224092160 2016-11-10 04:33:45 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity pass the infrastructure project funding for wall, roads, etc.
796932740834656256 2016-11-10 04:29:06 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNNMoney @brianstelter no he is using dividing arguments before Trump has done anything as president.  Media shouldn't do that.
796836897318260736 2016-11-10 22:08:15 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNNMoney @brianstelter I tried to watch CNN but Van Jones was too much for me.
796541926329622528 2016-11-09 02:36:08 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RealKidPoker we don't know yet but he new law he wants passed to allow us to buy from any state is also suppose to protect preexisting
796482055404032000 2016-11-09 22:38:14 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter I hope you can win me back.  Loved your show but didn't understand how you couldn't see this.  I went to one rally and I knew
796452253502607360 2016-11-09 20:39:49 UTC <Esteeb0582> @RealKidPoker that is the point of the electoral college.  You can't fill up a few areas with lots of people get their votes and win.
796380108315463680 2016-11-09 15:53:08 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump @themouthmatusow Thank you both.  Mike you spoke Truth and got picked on. President Trump thank you running.
796370578185678852 2016-11-09 15:15:16 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter I tried to tell you a few times the media was wrong.  I know I am not anyone you know but people did see this coming.
796241952580567040 2016-11-08 06:44:09 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JuddApatow do you understand at all how our government is set up?  Check and Balances.  Don't  cry after 8 years country wants a change.
795874857112059904 2016-11-07 06:25:27 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JuddApatow @realDonaldTrump money helps get out the vote.  People to drive voters, etc. My email has Hilary asking for money today also.
795873262051831808 2016-11-07 06:19:06 UTC <Esteeb0582> @SeniABC @ABCLiz haha cause it was a concert they where not there for her.
795337962326138881 2016-11-06 18:52:01 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter The show today was a joke.  Only talked bad about Trump.  Once again you failed to be fair at all.
794252871856373760 2016-11-03 19:00:15 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @mffisher @washingtonpost should one dwell on defeat?  No move on.
793550666681634816 2016-11-01 20:29:57 UTC <Esteeb0582> @HuffPostMedia @mlcalderone @brianstelter this is the main story that made me stop watch CNN but you have a chance to get me back now.
792925995422486530 2016-10-30 03:07:43 UTC <Esteeb0582> @lcapron well I am not a bot if that is what you where saying other than that not sure what you mean
792820768400814080 2016-10-30 20:09:35 UTC <Esteeb0582> @KilloughCNN I don't think you suck but I get her anger.  I almost can't watch CNN anymore.  So much Trump hate from a News outlet.
792798574136299520 2016-10-30 18:41:24 UTC <Esteeb0582> @FoxNewsSunday Please stop letting any Clinton talkers use we just don't know.  They could release this info but won't!  Keep asking why?
792797883502202880 2016-10-30 18:38:39 UTC <Esteeb0582> @FoxNewsSunday Can you tell me if you think laws where broke.  If so why does Hilary get away with that?
792797462834458624 2016-10-30 18:36:59 UTC <Esteeb0582> @FoxNewsSunday Why don't you counter the claim she fully cooperated with investigate when she deleted emails, destroyed two cell phones?
792513644596637696 2016-10-29 23:49:11 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JuddApatow maybe cause Trump didn't hold a public office.  Did not lie to congress did not destroy evidence.
792205202837221376 2016-10-28 03:23:33 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter I didn't.  But I feel she broke the law.  So she should be charged. glad it might happen. No one should be above the law.
792096911507369984 2016-10-28 20:13:14 UTC <Esteeb0582> @mcuban not sure how you can support her.  I get not going for Trump but she broke the law and lied to us and congress.
792036216136806400 2016-10-28 16:12:03 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter did you put out a message that after it ended they went to cover it?
791033150252081152 2016-10-25 21:46:14 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @politico_media @politico This is what drove me away from CNN and your show.  No longer seemed fair and balanced.
791004712807960576 2016-10-25 19:53:14 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter Will you talk about the CNN workers reported by Wikileaks's to have coordinated with Hillary's campaign?  If true you must.
790782186290950144 2016-10-24 05:08:59 UTC <Esteeb0582> @secupp What if Russia and Syria say no to the safe zones.  Do we go to war?
790688756361682944 2016-10-24 22:57:44 UTC <Esteeb0582> Stop this broken system.  They lie, cheat, steal.  Oh and hire thugs. #ducksontheground
790587151729561600 2016-10-24 16:14:00 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @realDonaldTrump Do your early voting numbers only show who is voting?  I am a Dem voting for Trump I am not alone.
790420680378425344 2016-10-23 05:12:30 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AMCTalkingDead man that was rough.  They took two.
788607390677598208 2016-10-18 05:07:08 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @TomColeOK04 @OutFrontCNN Sam day video of Democratic Party person talking about busing in people you say this.
788605889754324992 2016-10-18 05:01:10 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter Today news dropped voter fraud and paid people to start fights at Trump rally.  Democratic Party has gone too far.
788031943031914496 2016-10-17 15:00:30 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter This election has brought my watching of your and CNN to a end. Trump is not a Angel but Hilary has lied to us, to congress.
787475597924577280 2016-10-15 02:09:47 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNNMoney @brianstelter problem is email leaks proved that was true for a few so now we doubt you all.
787444828225216513 2016-10-15 00:07:31 UTC <Esteeb0582> @POTUS @HillaryClinton I will vote just not for you.  Lied to us too many times.  Truth is coming out.
785322721165004800 2016-10-09 03:35:01 UTC <Esteeb0582> @mcuban but Hillary is spending none of her own money yet we pretend she doesn't owe anyone favors
785322204720279552 2016-10-09 03:32:58 UTC <Esteeb0582> @mcuban Not sure how you can support Hilary she has done so many terrible things
785321695816978432 2016-10-09 03:30:57 UTC <Esteeb0582> @indystartony good there's nothing wrong with them disagreeing about something.
785321566959656961 2016-10-09 03:30:26 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN Well from the way I read the law she broke it.  If not jail what should happen?
785320480752357378 2016-10-09 03:26:07 UTC <Esteeb0582> @johnpodesta @AC360 @CNN what if I and others feel she broke the law.  Look up the law on classified materials and tell me if she broke it.
785320250266923008 2016-10-09 03:25:12 UTC <Esteeb0582> @secupp @DailyMirror I don't know do we go to war with Russia for non American lives?  Maybe we should but hard call.
784633032607207425 2016-10-07 05:54:27 UTC <Esteeb0582> @billmaher this all isn't funny.  We need someone to fix our system and there just isn't anyone out there to do it that is worthy.
784632730558590980 2016-10-07 05:53:15 UTC <Esteeb0582> @realDonaldTrump I was hopeful you would be the outsider to fix the system.  But your past had to much in it to let you.  That tape ends it.
783703617303748608 2016-10-05 16:21:17 UTC <Esteeb0582> @BernieSanders you had me but supporting Hilary has lost me.  This tax story is dumb.  His company pays more taxes than you or Hilary do
783430829682724864 2016-10-04 22:17:19 UTC <Esteeb0582> @HillaryClinton please stop this lie you should be better than this.  The company's would still have paid taxes.
782653216420802560 2016-10-02 18:47:22 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JesseBWatters @BoxoBastards agree.  Jesse you are now must watch for me
782643992164904960 2016-10-02 18:10:43 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @Yanked1 You get so mad at things Trump maybe said.  Yet no worries about things Hilary has done and has said.
782643706910302208 2016-10-02 18:09:35 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @Yanked1 Typical you don't back up what you say.  You just call him names.  Man employees thousands of Americans.
782628106301353984 2016-10-02 17:07:35 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @Yanked1 Also how does she get so much credit for bringing up issue that don't matter to our daily life.
782627777237221376 2016-10-02 17:06:17 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter @Yanked1 Really you try to debate dealing with the mic in the room you are in is not working.  It would be a distraction.
782623174059892736 2016-10-02 16:47:59 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter Do you understand Trump could only hear the sounds in the hall.  He wasn't watching TV he was debating.
782619149184831489 2016-10-02 16:32:00 UTC <Esteeb0582> @brianstelter Why does it matter if Trump lost 916 million 20 years ago and carried that lost forward it is legal.  Wasting our time.
782417458300719104 2016-10-01 03:10:33 UTC <Esteeb0582> @JesseBWatters @jessebwatters your points about the debate where perfect.  Get the Trump people to listen to that and win this.
782333774340116481 2016-10-01 21:38:01 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN @realDonaldTrump I use to watch CNN but they way they treat you drove me away.
782000628897751040 2016-09-30 23:34:13 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNNTonight Done with your network.  So anti Trump it makes me sick.
781895617735831554 2016-09-30 16:36:56 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper @brianstelter @chucktodd Also stop pretending one person can vote over and over the sites track your IP address.
781894807174033408 2016-09-30 16:33:43 UTC <Esteeb0582> @jaketapper @brianstelter @chucktodd You guys are wrong.  They show that Trumps supports care enough to go vote in the polls.
781693036573011968 2016-09-29 03:11:57 UTC <Esteeb0582> @HotlineJosh your so wrong. He had her at 70% last week now 63% he is so liberal and she is still falling
780644154082590720 2016-09-26 05:44:04 UTC <Esteeb0582> @CNN this is a joke 512 votes time has has so much more and trump is winning.  One vote per IP address.  Do you think Trump has hackers vote
780633554845696000 2016-09-26 05:01:57 UTC <Esteeb0582> @HillaryClinton you lost my vote.
780631989892231168 2016-09-26 04:55:44 UTC <Esteeb0582> @DanaBashCNN @brianstelter then let us vote.  He won
780631396314288128 2016-09-26 04:53:22 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AC360 ask again who won.  I can't find one other online poll where Clinton is winning.
771796248470839296 2016-09-02 19:45:39 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ReliableSources @brianstelter You are just wrong it happens a lot.  Again I know a few people that have voted 20 times in one election
767223601724481536 2016-08-20 04:55:35 UTC <Esteeb0582> @ReliableSources @brianstelter give you another shot see if your picking on Tump again for things he said and letting Clintion do whatever

765721207257694209 2016-08-16 01:25:36 UTC <Esteeb0582> @AC360 yes I know people that have done voter fraud and it wasn't hard.
