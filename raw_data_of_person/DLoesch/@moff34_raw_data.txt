945502350227128321 2017-12-25 03:51:41 UTC <moff34> @goodbean And at Thanksgiving and Christmas, two turkeys - one for the grandkids and one for the elderly from the church. Amazing woman, amazing cook.
945447374150701057 2017-12-25 00:13:14 UTC <moff34> @goodbean My very Irish Grandmother made roast leg of lamb every Sunday. Grandpa invited over the elderly widows/widowers after church. The best part was the Shepherd's Pie she made with leftovers.
944621527634403328 2017-12-23 17:31:37 UTC <moff34> Thanks #SpaceX for the gorgeous #spacexlaunch light show.  You can see the 2nd stage burn, the 1st stage boost back burn, and if you look closely, the jettisoned nose shroud.  PS - that's a Model S in the driveway.pic.twitter.com/CfO9NbBnBJ
942050329838751745 2017-12-16 15:14:35 UTC <moff34> @chrisburrous Hey Chris, Jocko's in Nipomo is famous for their steaks done on their outdoor grill. Not their seafood.

922196206356389888 2017-10-22 20:21:23 UTC <moff34> @jeff_gluck Think NASCAR can learn anything from F1?  Like ditch the playoffs and speed up races by getting rid of stage racing?
922195465893851136 2017-10-22 20:18:27 UTC <moff34> @jeff_gluck While NASCAR ponders horrid TV ratings and empty seats, Kyle Larson is a perfect example of why playoff system sucks.
897118508311379968 2017-08-14 15:31:34 UTC <moff34> @MJChris32 Two of the finest people I know. Congratulations on 30 years of service to our Lord and families in the San Fernando Valley. PROUD LEGACY!!!
