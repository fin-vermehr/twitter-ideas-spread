969806104606793728 2018-03-02 05:26:08 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @BreitbartNews Didn't realize the 2nd Amendment is a gun lobby.
967503647050469376 2018-02-24 20:56:59 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @piersmorgan Those were NOT "good guys with guns".
967022386297131008 2018-02-23 13:04:37 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @scrowder Sure, make all gun sales with untraceable cash. Brilliant. These people really don't think things through.
966299078068973568 2018-02-21 13:10:27 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> How long before #TwitterLockOut is removed from trending?
965989118525222912 2018-02-20 16:38:47 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> Oh No. I believe in the right to defend myself. I'm such an awful human being.
965815380013977600 2018-02-19 05:08:25 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @scrowder I feel like we need to be going the other way when it comes to who should vote.
965814767020642306 2018-02-19 05:05:59 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @JackPosobiec Geez, The Worthing Saga was exceptional. Enchantment was a lot of fun. Pastwatch was another great one.

914959588503572481 2017-10-02 21:05:39 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @BabsDunne Anyway gotta strap on my Sig P938 9mm and head to work. Been lovely chatting with you.
914958425288773633 2017-10-02 21:01:02 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @BabsDunne Not gun fault, persons fault.
914958308615782401 2017-10-02 21:00:34 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @BabsDunne By my count Europe 53, US none. This is why we have the RIGHT. http://www.conservapedia.com/List_of_dictators#Europe
914955698370424832 2017-10-02 20:50:12 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @BabsDunne We should dictate our domestic policies on what a comedian says.
914955454513582081 2017-10-02 20:49:14 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @BabsDunne How many millions of innocent civilians have died at the hands of an authoritative regime?
914955422230093826 2017-10-02 20:49:06 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @BabsDunne How many dictators has your continent had in the last 235 years?
914952188060999680 2017-10-02 20:36:15 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @BabsDunne With an ILLEGAL firearm.
914952049086943232 2017-10-02 20:35:42 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @BabsDunne Yep typical PROUD AMERICAN, we love our guns, our cars, our women and our freedom.
914950838371700737 2017-10-02 20:30:53 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @BabsDunne I got the sarcasm, your point still eludes me.
914949753292693505 2017-10-02 20:26:34 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @BabsDunne So Nice, London, and New York should ban trucks? Marseilles should ban knives?
914949175967731713 2017-10-02 20:24:17 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @BabsDunne So you confess your ignorance?
914946851828375552 2017-10-02 20:15:03 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @BabsDunne You can't modify a gun into full-auto. Guns don't work like that.
914946656675749888 2017-10-02 20:14:16 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @BabsDunne Your "proof" is full of conjecture.
914946248024711170 2017-10-02 20:12:39 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @BabsDunne "Legally bought those weapons and modified them" source? You can't legally modify a weapon, your response confirms what he did was illegal.
914944462157119490 2017-10-02 20:05:33 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @BabsDunne Well I am an American and we do have gun control laws. This sick, demented, evil individual broke them.

877698662914297860 2017-06-21 01:24:02 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @scrowder I will make a deal with the Femi-Nazis. I will stop manspreading when feminine hygiene product advertising is banned.

875387509710127105 2017-06-15 16:20:20 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> I saw this article weeks ago. Did @JackPosobiec get fired from @TheRebelTV  or not. Because as of today, he is still on their website.
875040469222383617 2017-06-14 17:21:19 UTC <NeilTaylor1031> @GovernorVA 93 million Americans a day? A disgraceful attack on our 2nd Amendment. You should be ashamed of yourself.
