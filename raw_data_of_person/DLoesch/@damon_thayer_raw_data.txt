952165965806166016 2018-01-13 13:10:31 UTC <damon_thayer> The Senate wasted no time getting to work this week, passing four bills including two Constitutional amendments: @MarsysLaw4KY @KyWhitney Move statewide elections to even-numbered years @kychrismcdaniel   They now are in the House for its consideration.https://twitter.com/kytodayeditor/status/951594465642377222
952164689714302976 2018-01-13 13:05:27 UTC <damon_thayer> The rules neednt be changed.  But the way the map(in this case, the House map) is drawn needs to be changed.   Take note of the Senate map:  fair and not challenged in court.   The #NewMajority will get its chance to do the right thing after the 2020 #Censushttps://twitter.com/jmnemes/status/951900348159053824

950820719016980483 2018-01-09 20:04:59 UTC <damon_thayer> Thank you and all the Constitutional Pages for your service to the Senate.https://twitter.com/winterishsummer/status/950815196003618816
950750883352137729 2018-01-09 15:27:29 UTC <damon_thayer> Most people I know who pay taxes feel like they are taxed enough already.    Im happy to set up a Voluntary Tax Me More Fund for those who want to send more than what they owe.  (Idea credit @GovMikeHuckabee)https://twitter.com/dsafavianesq/status/950712475745439744
950749070842302465 2018-01-09 15:20:17 UTC <damon_thayer> No, Dick.  Im merely pointing out that those items are exempt from taxation. So some consider that lost income for state government.   So when you hear about new revenue, by ending exemptions, now you know what people are referring to in order to increase revenue.https://twitter.com/totahiti/status/950733932689059840
950574925940690944 2018-01-08 03:48:17 UTC <damon_thayer> I do not care who wins the #NationalChampionship game but I think the #BlackPanther trailer was outstanding.
950568213078781954 2018-01-08 03:21:37 UTC <damon_thayer> My first interview via FaceTime  Thanks @LASmithReports @RepBratcherKY & @jmnemes also interviewed regarding #pensions #kyga2018https://twitter.com/wdrbnews/status/950491605957476354
950548071062097920 2018-01-08 02:01:35 UTC <damon_thayer> So before you clamor for new revenue to pay for pensions, you may want to consider how it might affect your wallet, the checkbooks of others and Kentuckys overall economy. #rantoverhttps://twitter.com/damon_thayer/status/950546864465698816
950546864465698816 2018-01-08 01:56:47 UTC <damon_thayer> Here are some other popular income tax exemptions & their costs: Prescriptions $560MM Food/Groceries $700MM Residential Utilities $383MM Home Mortgage Interest $167MM Business Services $296MM Standard Deduction $153MM IRA Contributions $146MMhttps://twitter.com/damon_thayer/status/950542784393596933
950542784393596933 2018-01-08 01:40:34 UTC <damon_thayer> Take note when Democrats call for new revenue, watch your wallets!  Im not saying updates to the tax code arent needed. They are. But those calling for new money benefit from tax exemptions, too. Like the $42,000/yr in pension income exempted from taxes. Cost? $350,000,000
950541409345527809 2018-01-08 01:35:06 UTC <damon_thayer> There is more pandering from Democrats on @KyTonightKET than on the average street corner in Lexington.
950374979681517573 2018-01-08 14:33:46 UTC <damon_thayer> I kinda like this bill.  Should be expanded beyond just Louisville, though. #kyga18https://twitter.com/jmnemes/status/950363494808997888
950199815123734529 2018-01-07 02:57:44 UTC <damon_thayer> Lets pass it!  The people want it.  Elections two out of every four years(instead of three of four) and a big savings of tax dollars(especially for counties, @KACo)https://twitter.com/kychrismcdaniel/status/950185208476680192
950195661697441792 2018-01-07 02:41:14 UTC <damon_thayer> No song lyrics, just congratulations on your biggest win in years and good luck in the NIT.    #Sparty will be just fine.https://twitter.com/ushorseman/status/950170565486219269

949484389913767938 2018-01-05 03:34:53 UTC <damon_thayer> No, all it means is teacher healthcare is not part of the inviolable contract.   And it costs taxpayers about $400 million annually.    Also, I carried HB 540 in the Senate several years ago. It pretty much saved teacher healthcare.   #factsarefunnythingshttps://twitter.com/tylermurphyky/status/949457105806876673

942084326476300288 2017-12-16 17:29:41 UTC <damon_thayer> Probably not the best way to make it IMHO.    You are missed here in Kentucky, Tom!!!https://twitter.com/jerseytom/status/942075810810421249
942077411620876288 2017-12-16 17:02:12 UTC <damon_thayer> I can always count on my old pal @ScottJenningsKY for an accurate summary of the news.   And in this case, it is VERY good news.   https://twitter.com/scottjenningsky/status/941761512951156741
942074577227616256 2017-12-16 16:50:56 UTC <damon_thayer> In 2008, pensions consumed just 6.7 percent of the budget  a percentage that grew to 13.4 percent this year. If $700 million more is added next year, pensions will take up about 20 percent of General Fund spending in 2018-19.-@TomLoftus_CJ   Taxpayers on the hook for BILLIONS
942073498570129408 2017-12-16 16:46:39 UTC <damon_thayer> On the list of bad ideas, this is near the top. As far as Kentucky is concerned, @ARCIntegrity proposal is unnecessary & burdensome government overregulation. @marc_guilfoil @BloodHorse @keenelandsales @FasigTiptonCo @JerseyTom @EricTheTiger @TOBAhorses @theTDN @suefinleyhttps://twitter.com/marc_guilfoil/status/941663419584925696
941367935729389568 2017-12-14 18:03:00 UTC <damon_thayer> Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, which wasnt included in this decision, lacks statutory authority to regulate horse sales and farms.    And, frankly, @keenelandsales & @FasigTiptonCo both do well self-policing this area.   Appears a big government power grab by @ARCIntegrityhttps://twitter.com/tharacing/status/941067322449711104

939494100511940608 2017-12-09 13:57:03 UTC <damon_thayer> The pension bill will include a generous phase-in for CERS while the state makes full contribution-plus to KERS, KTRS.   If pension bill does not pass, local governments will be required to make the entire contribution.   @KyLeagueCities @KACohttps://twitter.com/blakebrickman/status/939469372447391749

937525257640005634 2017-12-03 03:33:34 UTC <damon_thayer> Me, too.    Feel like Ive said this a thousand times:    Pension reform requires more than just more funding.   It requires structural changes, outside the contract, in order to have a sustainable pension system.   1.1 employees for every 1 retiree wont work anymore.https://twitter.com/deplorablekraus/status/937507907956039680
937523923532558336 2017-12-03 03:28:16 UTC <damon_thayer> If nothing is done, local governments will, by law, be required to pay new, higher actuarial payments to CERS.  In many cases, that means deep cuts or higher taxes will be considered.    Local governments should be begging for pension reform.

937519824393179136 2017-12-03 03:11:59 UTC <damon_thayer> Casinos require constitutional change. Pot requires legislative passage.  KY is not like CO & other states where people gather signatures followed by referendum. Hope this helps!!!https://twitter.com/olerustyplow/status/937502111629266946

937500374080028672 2017-12-03 01:54:41 UTC <damon_thayer> I appreciate the suggestion, but its not just about funding. Structural changes are required for a sustainable system(s).https://twitter.com/moe_1971/status/937499338745569280

937498946255163392 2017-12-03 01:49:01 UTC <damon_thayer> Yes.  Not a referendum per se. Needed when change required to constitution.  Pot requires statutory approval,  but it lacks the votes.https://twitter.com/olerustyplow/status/937497350876037121
937497802040594432 2017-12-03 01:44:28 UTC <damon_thayer> You may be right or wrong. But face this fact:  we WILL make changes outside the contract or your pension will collapse within 5 years.https://twitter.com/jimcarroll19/status/936543101405016064
