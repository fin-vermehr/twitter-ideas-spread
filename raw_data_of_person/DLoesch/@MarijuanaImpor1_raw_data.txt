Manipulating the stock market using Twitter to make money for himself and his friends. One that is truly a danger to The American people. This is a bad fucking movie for sure.

970136245006491648 2018-03-03 03:17:59 UTC <MarijuanaImpor1> @womanontheleft Julie, trump is sitting in the WH manipulating the stock market so him and a few of his trusted friends can get richer. That wasnt hard to figure out. He only ran because he was broke and was facing another bankruptcy. I read how he fucked the American banks hes a dead beat.

970134891907223552 2018-03-03 03:12:37 UTC <MarijuanaImpor1> I only block someone who calls me names because they have no defense for the conman in the WH.

969936823811178497 2018-03-03 14:05:34 UTC <MarijuanaImpor1> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu When will Congress learn the President holds too much power. Its time to change that for the person that takes over when trump is impeached.

969935745866747905 2018-03-03 14:01:17 UTC <MarijuanaImpor1> @DevinNunes You should resign you are a traitor to the United States. You care about nothing except your party. America doesnt need people like you in Congress and I suspect this will be your last term in DC. The people never forget.
969934480134889473 2018-03-03 13:56:15 UTC <MarijuanaImpor1> @tedlieu Even if North Korea didnt use nukes they could send hundreds of thousands of soldiers across the border into the South. An awful lot of people would die. It seems life means nothing to Sen Graham. I believe someone needs to check into a mental hospital.
969932758809300992 2018-03-03 13:49:24 UTC <MarijuanaImpor1> @DiamondandSilk This is absolutely horse shit. Palin didnt take anyone down she has shown everyone her ignorance. Theres a little bit of difference between Sarah Palin and god talking to her and Oprah Winfrey praying to god and yes if god talks to you then you are mentally ill. Right Mr. VP?
969927227298275328 2018-03-03 13:27:26 UTC <MarijuanaImpor1> @NRA @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu Afraid? Hes not afraid of anyone or anything. BUT how much money did the NRA promise him because as everyone knows Donald Trump is for sale if the price is right.
