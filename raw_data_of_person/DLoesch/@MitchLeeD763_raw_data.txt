965740450014486528 2018-02-19 00:10:40 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @FBI @YouTube @KyleKulinski @connerwilliamsx Im implying that semi-auto weapons arent weapons of collective mass destruction and they be legal, but if they were made illegal, people would still print them. Banning drugs has only widened the availability of drugs because the black market wins.

Its a tradeoff, but again, those costs would be non-existent with hydro and thorium-based nuclear energy if we had it over the past few decades. The companies should pay for provable damages.

Nuclear is the safest and most effective option. Fourth-generation plants/reactors will run on nuclear waste (spent fuel) and wont need humans.
963190585770332160 2018-02-12 23:18:25 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @SolveForBetter @KHayhoe @timreckmeyer It depends on whats provable when it comes to pollution or environmental damages.

940909249948999680 2017-12-13 11:40:21 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @Lge4258 @ALL__RISE If I want to buy a computer, I shop around for the lowest price. Why cant we do that with internet regardless of any service packages? Oh thats right, the State props up big companies so they can be an oligopoly.
940908888609775616 2017-12-13 11:38:54 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @Lge4258 @ALL__RISE Thus, market prices lower with no government intervention.
940908748180217856 2017-12-13 11:38:21 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @Lge4258 @ALL__RISE I want to pay the cheapest amount for the best possible service. Getting rid of regulations and allowing smaller ISPs to compete with bigger ISPs who have an oligopoly will benefit consumers.
940908440502796288 2017-12-13 11:37:08 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @ALL__RISE @Lge4258 So, in essence, I pay to access the internet. Why not allow smaller ISPs to compete with bigger ISPs? Surely, it would force the bigger ISPs to lower their prices.
940908207920369664 2017-12-13 11:36:12 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @Lge4258 @ALL__RISE I pay my phone company to get internet. Twitter is on the internet.

940905037684932608 2017-12-13 11:23:36 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @wolfhardparker Its not a freedom or a right. We pay for it as a service. Companies should be able to charge at whatever prices they want. Allow economic competition for cheaper prices!

940903643649331200 2017-12-13 11:18:04 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @Lge4258 Actually, costs would be cheaper if economic competition is allowed. How is it free? Lol.

940900591320125441 2017-12-13 11:05:56 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @Lge4258 Companies should be allowed to innovate. Smaller ISPs will be free to compete if the main ISPs jack up prices. Thats the beauty of it. Consumers have the power to direct where their dollars go!
940899209699647490 2017-12-13 11:00:27 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @Lge4258 Actually, if one company offers a service at a price, and another company offers that same service at a lower price, consumers will invest and spend their money on the latter company. Isnt economic competition wonderful?

940895516099047424 2017-12-13 10:45:46 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @Lge4258 Government regulation means the internet is not free in terms of liberty. Imagine if we had #NetNeutraility for delivery services. No company can offer different packages or faster speeds!
940894124789633024 2017-12-13 10:40:14 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @Lge4258 Economic competition will allow companies to offer those same sites at better deals!
940893383853211648 2017-12-13 10:37:18 UTC <MitchLeeD763> I do not support #NetNeutrality because it means that the internet will be less free due to government intervention.

940179870168043520 2017-12-11 11:22:03 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @KyleKulinski Exactly. A $1 bill and a $100 bill weigh and look the same but one magically has a hundred times more value only because the State says it does.
940179642908061696 2017-12-11 11:21:09 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @KyleKulinski Who pays for free college? Taxpayers. Cut income taxes so working people can keep more of what they earn.

939824065912692736 2017-12-10 11:48:13 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @BrianBrenberg What if a $100 bill is exactly the same as a $1 bill but is magically worth one hundred times more just because of a different ink design? Paper currencies are fiat.
939821183675109376 2017-12-10 11:36:45 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @KyleKulinski Everything would be taxed at one hundred percent and government would monopolize every industry. Sounds like a terrible time.

935764543355146240 2017-11-28 06:57:07 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @marcorubio @Walmart @Target @amazon @SenatorCantwell @GBralta Like @SenWarren who oversaw TARP, a program that gave $25 billion to @WellsFargo?
935763269758980096 2017-11-28 06:52:03 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @amazon @GOP @GBralta No idea. Tell me. Also, tell the lazy people complaining about minimum wage laws to go out and specialize in something so they can earn for a living. Theres a reason engineers make more than fast-food workers. Specialization.
935762941768622081 2017-11-28 06:50:45 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @GBralta Economics is taught everywhere except public schools. Let people keep what they earn because they know how to spend and invest their money better than the State does.
935762733877878786 2017-11-28 06:49:56 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @Walmart @Target @amazon @SenatorCantwell @GBralta Corporations love mandates and regulations because it makes it harder for small businesses to compete against them. Look at Obamacare. The top five insurance companies nearly doubled their profits over the past eight years.
935762247967825927 2017-11-28 06:48:00 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @GBralta Ive gladly paid the highway tolls. If I use a service, I expect to pay for it. I dont need the State to take money from me without my consent.
935758571261788162 2017-11-28 06:33:23 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @GOP @GBralta Not sure, but @amazon employes 541,900 people with excellent benefits and pay.........and theyre hiring! Stop bitching about the minimum wage and apply!
935758286091153408 2017-11-28 06:32:15 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @GBralta Id gladly pay the tolls. So you believe we cant have roads without government?
935757758569345024 2017-11-28 06:30:09 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @GBralta I guess consumers should think about where they send their money, huh?

935749604838203393 2017-11-28 05:57:45 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @GBralta We cant have education or roads without government.
935749064280375296 2017-11-28 05:55:36 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @GBralta Its not a tax when the roads are privatized. The roads arent privatized and people can still use them even without any skin in the game. Its called freeloading and its unethical.
935748830192074752 2017-11-28 05:54:41 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @amazon @GOP @GBralta Its the largest retailer in the United States with an average of three or four warehouses in each state.
935748698386173952 2017-11-28 05:54:09 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @GBralta So lets donate and help them absent of government!
935748463719043072 2017-11-28 05:53:13 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @Walmart @Target @amazon @SenatorCantwell @GBralta I want the government out of our lives. That starts with abolishing taxation and subsidies so corporations have competition from small businesses.
935748216754180097 2017-11-28 05:52:14 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @GBralta @MichaelSkolnik The country cant run on solar and wind power. They dont have baseload capacity.
935747981722247168 2017-11-28 05:51:18 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @GBralta No, anybody who uses the roads pays subscription services and tolls. Thus, revenue is generated and the roads are able to get paved by companies.
935747575814283264 2017-11-28 05:49:42 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @GOP @GBralta Maybe specialize in a field and be an EMT or a paramedic. Fast food workers are replaceable. @amazon is starting sorters out at $15.50 per hour with benefits. They have plenty of positions available.
935746926661824512 2017-11-28 05:47:07 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @GBralta Dont take. Thats stealing.
935746844671533056 2017-11-28 05:46:47 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @SenatorCantwell @GBralta Raising the corporate tax rate will ensure that corporations take jobs elsewhere and not in the US. How many Americans are employed by @amazon, @Target, and @Walmart?
935746253627035649 2017-11-28 05:44:26 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @GBralta We can pool it together voluntarily or through payment of services. Theres no such thing as a free lunch. I dont want to pay for somebody elses mistake(s).
935744982996135938 2017-11-28 05:39:23 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @GOP @GBralta Maybe poor people should think twice before having four or five of them. Its called condoms. Theyre effective. If we want to lower the cost of healthcare then we can allow economic competition and get rid of monopolies.
935744497316745216 2017-11-28 05:37:28 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @Walmart @Target @amazon @SenatorCantwell @JohnHNeal197437 Its not about jobs. Let them keep what they earn or inherit. Cut taxes for everybody! Dont steal from people through bureaucracy and government!

929129296530231297 2017-11-10 23:31:01 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @HillaryClinton @chrislhayes @Ariesgirl401 While Bill made hundreds of thousands of dollars from speeches in Moscow?
929129196290441216 2017-11-10 23:30:37 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @HillaryClinton @chrislhayes @Ariesgirl401 Any thoughts on the Russians getting 20 percent of our Uranium under HRC and Obamas nose?
929129085414100994 2017-11-10 23:30:11 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @HillaryClinton @chrislhayes @Ariesgirl401 Show me evidence (none has been presented thus far) and I will believe it.
929128781201182720 2017-11-10 23:28:58 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @benshapiro @Patterico She comes out right before the election. Hmm......
929128600057667584 2017-11-10 23:28:15 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @HillaryClinton @chrislhayes @Ariesgirl401 Both the Clintons and Trumps are guilty of many things. Im not disputing it.
929128223623041025 2017-11-10 23:26:45 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @MooreSenate has not been proven guilty of anything.
929127999949197312 2017-11-10 23:25:52 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @HillaryClinton @chrislhayes @Ariesgirl401 The lynch mob is already out. The double standard is when Hayes wants republicans to distance themselves from Moore but says nothing about dems distancing themselves from HRC.
929127702627569664 2017-11-10 23:24:41 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @BillClinton @AP @LaurenWalshTV @TwiTati Oh, thats perfect for justice.
929127595542802433 2017-11-10 23:24:15 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @HillaryClinton @chrislhayes @Ariesgirl401 Voting for unconstitutional wars, pay-for-play with donors, hosting classified emails on her personal computer, approving the Uranium One deal, lying under oath, etc.
929127092402483201 2017-11-10 23:22:15 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @HillaryClinton @chrislhayes @Ariesgirl401 Excellent! Prove it so he can go to jail.

929125683573526528 2017-11-10 23:16:39 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @BillClinton @AP @LaurenWalshTV @TwiTati Of course, less than 30 days before an election? Intriguing.
929125578061606913 2017-11-10 23:16:14 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @HillaryClinton @chrislhayes @Ariesgirl401 Because dems never stood up for the victims!
929125468049149952 2017-11-10 23:15:48 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @HillaryClinton @chrislhayes @Ariesgirl401 @DaciaOaks She called blacks super predators, was anti-gay and fought for traditional marriage, and said shed crucify one of her husbands accusers.
929125293314453504 2017-11-10 23:15:06 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @BillClinton @AP @LaurenWalshTV @TwiTati Its an opportunistic choice. What took McGowan so long to come out against Weinstein? Again, opportunistic. Also, we need evidence.
929123969453748229 2017-11-10 23:09:51 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @HillaryClinton @chrislhayes @Ariesgirl401 I like showing the double standard.
929123901195595776 2017-11-10 23:09:34 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @BillClinton @AP @LaurenWalshTV @TwiTati Yes, but waiting FORTY YEARS? Why not go the route like women did with @billclinton? They didnt wait.
929123029824802816 2017-11-10 23:06:07 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @chrislhayes Im still waiting for dems to distance themselves from @HillaryClinton for how she treated blacks, gays, and her husbands accusers.
929121564578246656 2017-11-10 23:00:17 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @chrislhayes @sahilkapur It only took her forty years to come out right before a senate election.
929118197185380353 2017-11-10 22:46:55 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @chrislhayes @KFILE Why did she wait four decades to come out and tell her story less than 30 days before a huge senate election?
929117774328352768 2017-11-10 22:45:14 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @chrislhayes @jaketapper She waited 40 years to come out less than 30 days before the biggest senate election in Alabamas history. I am skeptical.

921083307382722562 2017-10-19 18:39:08 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @RandPaul @BrianHDarling @rachelbovard Is it really unthinkable? They dont care about the national debt just like the Left.
921080944471224320 2017-10-19 18:29:44 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @PrisonPlanet Also time off, tenure, and experience.
921080791295283200 2017-10-19 18:29:08 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @PrisonPlanet I always ask my liberal friends, How are atheists, gays, and women treated in Muslim-majority countries?

920940252415582208 2017-10-19 09:10:41 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @WilliamJBennett @marthamaccallum @FoxNews Drugs are widely available regardless of bans on them.

920858159413112833 2017-10-18 03:44:28 UTC <MitchLeeD763> It took @BarackObama  and @HillaryClinton awhile to condemn the actions of #HarveyWeinstein.

920322854117404672 2017-10-17 16:17:21 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @RandPaul @FoxBusiness @BrasweDr Doesnt cutting taxes for middle-class people help middle-class people?
920320700539457537 2017-10-17 16:08:48 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @RandPaul @FoxBusiness @BrasweDr So middle-class people who earn and get to keep more of what they earn is helping the rich?

916049769268686848 2017-10-05 21:17:39 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @VeeCee30 Gun control doesnt reduce gun deaths. Look at Baltimore, Chicago, LA, St. Louis, etc.

896746151583653889 2017-08-13 14:51:57 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @NerdAboutTown @crtconsu It's not. I just disagree with the bullshit body positivity movement which teaches women not to improve themselves physically.
896745449587167233 2017-08-13 14:49:10 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @bronia_ @NerdAboutTown .......and engaged in alcoholism as well.

896745228996104192 2017-08-13 14:48:17 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @NerdAboutTown Most fat people lead unhealthy lifestyles. Obesity is one of the top killers in America and elsewhere.
896745119080230913 2017-08-13 14:47:51 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @NerdAboutTown I lost weight because being huge was unhealthy.

896718701487161344 2017-08-13 13:02:53 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @traciethoms Those are the real racists. I see that up here with the cop apologists who suddenly care about who shot an innocent woman (Justine Damond).
896717928053211145 2017-08-13 12:59:48 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @traciethoms Absolutely. Any group of people who burn down their own city after an injustice or a loss at a sporting event is hardly humanistic.
896717602176815104 2017-08-13 12:58:31 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @traciethoms Who would want to invest in the city of Ferguson after those three days of violent acts of arson? What about those business owners?
896717205676666880 2017-08-13 12:56:56 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @traciethoms Yes. That is literally what I just said. Destroying private property is unethical and does nothing to advance progress.
896716494591143936 2017-08-13 12:54:07 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @traciethoms I believe private property damage to be inherently unethical regardless of who does it.
896716393726574592 2017-08-13 12:53:43 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @traciethoms I'm sure business owners were super excited to invest in Ferguson after people torched THEIR OWN businesses and buildings.
896715024030466048 2017-08-13 12:48:16 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @traciethoms Which is why we both advocate for body cameras for accountability and transparency. Regardless, torching one's own city won't help.
896714161899671552 2017-08-13 12:44:50 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @traciethoms To push a false social justice agenda that was magnified by the media. I'd much rather rely on physical evidence.
896713852334878720 2017-08-13 12:43:37 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @traciethoms If the evidence was strong that MB was murdered in cold blood, why didn't @EricHolder's DOJ prosecute with the go ahead from @BarackObama?
896712703380795393 2017-08-13 12:39:03 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @traciethoms Exit wounds tell quite the story.

896710573223751680 2017-08-13 12:30:35 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @traciethoms With all of the physical evidence cited according to autopsy and court documents. Also, this is from WaPo.

896708789948342273 2017-08-13 12:23:30 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @traciethoms He was shot and killed at close range. The DNA on the holster, door, and gun residue on his fingertips show it was more than likely the case
896708587812204544 2017-08-13 12:22:42 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @traciethoms You didn't, but many in the BLM movement make the false equivalency which hurts the fight for justice.
896708091093417984 2017-08-13 12:20:43 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @traciethoms I know, but I'm simply stating those who said MB was killed a ways away in proximity doesn't help out in finding the truth.
896707901754150912 2017-08-13 12:19:58 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @traciethoms It'd be an altercation if it was mutual and both meant harm to each other. Equating the MB case with the Castile case is the dangerous part.
896707079867707393 2017-08-13 12:16:42 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @traciethoms It didn't, but it shattered the story that he was a genuine person. Also, rapping about shooting people didn't help his image either.
896706845737398272 2017-08-13 12:15:46 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @EricHolder @john_werner_jr @swingingstorm @traciethoms 15 feet away?

896706488600866816 2017-08-13 12:14:21 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @traciethoms It wasn't an altercation. A store owner stopped him and he shoved him backwards and physically threatened him. Why not be civil?
896706267854643201 2017-08-13 12:13:28 UTC <MitchLeeD763> @john_werner_jr @swingingstorm @traciethoms Why didn't @EricHolder's DOJ file charges? What should happen to those who gave sworn statements about "hands up, don't shoot"?
