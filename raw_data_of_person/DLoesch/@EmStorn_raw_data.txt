The hilarity is that you will be the first person to scream and run to the police yet you try to liken our law enforcement to NK.  Laughable, but only for the frivolity.
971379501354627072 2018-03-07 13:38:15 UTC <EmStorn> @thef35 @USSWaspLHD1 @USMC @cross0023 @gibson_scotty @damons Predictably vapid response.  You are right that living in California you are on the road to collectivism.  As soon as you are starving and eating tree bark, I will believe in your commitment.  I am sure you still appreciate your internet, power, medical coverage, etc.
971270833221132288 2018-03-06 06:26:26 UTC <EmStorn> @leftoverghost I am the Ceasar Milan for beta males.  I just know how to speak to you.
971257922356498433 2018-03-06 05:35:08 UTC <EmStorn> @leftoverghost Whoever said you guys werent trainable didnt know the right prompting to use.
971253821648318464 2018-03-06 05:18:50 UTC <EmStorn> @leftoverghost No point in me trying to insult you.  Your own actions/words are insult enough.  All I have done is prompted you to put your stupidity on full display.  Well done fine sir.  I am barely ringing the bell, but you are salivating like a champ.
971242362621124615 2018-03-06 04:33:18 UTC <EmStorn> @leftoverghost I take it that you dont like being challenged on things?
971235234879504384 2018-03-06 04:04:59 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @leftoverghost Was this for me and should I call you my little lady to keep it consistent?
971233363972579328 2018-03-06 03:57:33 UTC <EmStorn> @NRATV @DLoesch @STL_Blonde @BogmonBeast Why are you commenting on a 16 year old?
971232352474206208 2018-03-06 03:53:32 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @jranno Snowflake is probably not fitting for you here.  Probably insulting to the butthurt millenials to be lumped in with you.
971230813005209602 2018-03-06 03:47:25 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @leftoverghost How could you be offended...?  You use dead children as an attempt at humor.  Why dont you roll out some real zingers about the Holocaust or the Khmer Rouge?  Seems right up your alley minus the recency effect.
971229716685492224 2018-03-06 03:43:03 UTC <EmStorn> @thef35 @USSWaspLHD1 @USMC @cross0023 @damons @gibson_scotty Im so convinced of the lack of commitment in Damon, I will throw my lot in with yours.

971142663771738112 2018-03-06 21:57:08 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @leftoverghost The joke about liberals and a lack of sarcasm has to do with you and your response and not about the children in Florida.  I am sure you wouldn't miss an opportunity to be offended, but why let facts get in the way.
971142415255064576 2018-03-06 21:56:09 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @leftoverghost Who was using dead kids for cultivating a joke?  The quip about the sheriff was sarcasm and not a joke.  I certainly know that I didn't use dead children as a joke.  Perhaps you should go back and read what I actually said instead of what you wanted to read.

971139886156800000 2018-03-06 21:46:06 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @TheLadyPilar So followers = worth.    Solid advice.  I guess that mean Trump is great because he has nearly 50 million followers?
971014697037254656 2018-03-06 13:28:39 UTC <EmStorn> @Gavin_McInnes Every Canadian voter that pulled the lever for that guy should do a big fat FACEPALM right now.
971013292620701698 2018-03-06 13:23:04 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @leftoverghost Mostly anecdotal data points.  But I would hate to let good data get in the way of a joke.

You cry about Ad Hominem "attacks" because I appropriately labeled you a #SoyBoy yet you are okay impugning the entirely of humanity because they develop a plane that hasn't even been used to kill a single person yet.  As I suspected.... #SoyBoy
971011910211653634 2018-03-06 13:17:34 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @Freedom_Daily_ Keep your sanctimony and judgement to yourself.  Someone like you doesn't have a right to judge or pray for anyone.
971011651263696896 2018-03-06 13:16:32 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @jranno So you get to label folks when racial terms then?  What if someone looked at your picture and said you looked like a "dirty Mexican"....would that be similarly okay?
971011251097784320 2018-03-06 13:14:57 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @TheLadyPilar How dare you lecture me.  Where was God when those children were being slaughtered.  Save you religious sanctimony for someone else as well as your prescription advice.

970734026821718017 2018-03-05 18:53:22 UTC <EmStorn> @thef35 @USSWaspLHD1 @jasoninthehouse @USMC Story was updated to say that the jet has now experience 14 equipment  failures and will cost 2 billion to get another boat and crane to get it  off the carrier.    Good thing we designed and entire jet around some stupid idea like VTOL.  Thanks for the overpriced guppy Congress.
970732975561367552 2018-03-05 18:49:11 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @TheLadyPilar Please keep God out of this discussion.  What is it with God and Guns.  How dare people try to tell me that I can't abort a fetus...but you can give tools of death to someone that fire full semi automatic....ridiculous.
970731664736387072 2018-03-05 18:43:58 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @bschapiro @MontegnaJoe This...is beautiful.  Love it.
970731420133003266 2018-03-05 18:43:00 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @Freedom_Daily_ How dare you bring God into this.  Keep your religion out of this conversation.  What is it with you people and all your God talk?

970730612884680704 2018-03-05 18:39:48 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @TheLadyPilar Nobody should have any regardless.  We need to get rid of them and protect the children.
970730311171690496 2018-03-05 18:38:36 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @user422 You first.
970730181026607104 2018-03-05 18:38:05 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @jranno That seems quite racially insensitive to what is political commentary/humor.  Check your privilege there buddy.
970729822484942851 2018-03-05 18:36:39 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @Freedom_Daily_ Praying to the spaghetti monster?
970729628628389889 2018-03-05 18:35:53 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @leftoverghost Do liberals actually have a sense of sarcasm?  I realize it takes a slightly higher intellect and that automatically thins the herd in terms of liberals...but what about the remaining 10%?
970729189002366976 2018-03-05 18:34:08 UTC <EmStorn> @RealJamesWoods Way to go you flipping idiots.

970639770694180864 2018-03-05 12:38:49 UTC <EmStorn> @anntensity Ann rocks so following anything that is updates on her is a win - win!!!  You do great work either way...but she does make it a bit easier.

Given that there are magazine limitations and rifle bans in Chicago, why are so many folks dying there because of gun violence?
970638408300269568 2018-03-05 12:33:24 UTC <EmStorn> @WBAP @AnnCoulter @brassmusic63 @danielangell2 @MGRANT65 I don't know if you mother loved you or not, but your creator does.  He loves you even when you reject him.  This magical "spaghetti monster" as you call him still loves you even as you deny him and will forever love you.  Free will is a son of a bitch at the end of the day.
969966255460503553 2018-03-03 16:02:31 UTC <EmStorn> @mesikes1 That might be Parkinson so I would keep an eye on that.
969949444195147778 2018-03-03 14:55:42 UTC <EmStorn> @RepAdamSchiff @gatewaypundit @USNJack I would suggest that you actually spend a bit more time defending and validating your positions and let the rest of the world take care of itself.  You seem to ignore questions if they don't align with your narrative.
969948697822924801 2018-03-03 14:52:44 UTC <EmStorn> @mesikes1 How old are you again?  A bit long in the tooth to be so foolish.  You have more than demonstrated your buffoonery in this case.  Feel free to post up a single fact.  I welcome the opportunity to intellectually smack you around, but I know you won't wade into these waters.
969948335787397121 2018-03-03 14:51:18 UTC <EmStorn> @RepAdamSchiff @gatewaypundit @USNJack Clearly Adam Schiff is the benchmark of accuracy as well.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItZQlU2uDNU
969947884539011073 2018-03-03 14:49:31 UTC <EmStorn> @mesikes1 The irony is that you probably would take issue with someone refusing to use someone chose pronoun.  Oh Irony...you are a fickle one aren't you.
969947658050850816 2018-03-03 14:48:37 UTC <EmStorn> @mesikes1 Do you actually want to have an "Adult" discussion on the matter or are you even capable?    For the record, if body autonomy is the law of the land, can I do whatever I want with regards to drugs, nudity, and actions that pertain to my person-hood?
969947172803399682 2018-03-03 14:46:41 UTC <EmStorn> @mesikes1 You, not surprisingly, assume too much.  I was asking about what has been more destructive to the black community and women at large with regards to abortion.  You still haven't addressed a singular point with fact so I grow tired of your vacuous replies.
969944012227563520 2018-03-03 14:34:07 UTC <EmStorn> @mesikes1 Are you actually interested in learning about slavery and what the  impact was or are you just happier in your bubble calling someone a  "Russian Bot" to avoid facing the fact that you know very little of what  you speak?  That is a legitimate question.
969930898287267840 2018-03-03 13:42:01 UTC <EmStorn> @TinaTchen @ValerieJarrett @mesikes1 Technically Sanger was a woman, but she was a bit man'ish for the time.  What do you think is the massive execution of blacks by the white male?  Are you referring to US targeting of blacks?  Just wondering or are you speaking more globally?
969929093201498113 2018-03-03 13:34:50 UTC <EmStorn> @LRBitisnot #SoyBoy
969926932543533056 2018-03-03 13:26:15 UTC <EmStorn> @TinaTchen @ValerieJarrett @mesikes1 So do you actually have a response other than ad hominem?  I'll give you a second to look that up.  Weak minds attack the person rather than the substantive points of their argument.  Nothing (crack, police, etc) has been more deadly to the black race than abortion and Sanger.
969576010860630016 2018-03-02 14:11:49 UTC <EmStorn> Ah...double standards.  If it weren't for those, liberals would have none.https://twitter.com/PoliticalShort/status/969560829652856833
969572906354331648 2018-03-02 13:59:29 UTC <EmStorn> @TinaTchen @ValerieJarrett Will we be discussing the fact that more black children were aborted than born in New York city?  I think that is a bigger threat to women than anything at the workplace.
969572528015446016 2018-03-02 13:57:59 UTC <EmStorn> @TinaTchen @ValerieJarrett @NDNSLUGZ Totally a white male issue...right....pic.twitter.com/GGOxATSx7R
969262105022124032 2018-03-01 17:24:28 UTC <EmStorn> @maggieNYT If it can't be pinned on something to make Republicans or Trump look bad, there is not other reason.
969261777946054656 2018-03-01 17:23:10 UTC <EmStorn> @DavidAFrench So the honest question is...who do you think would defend the  Constitution better at this point?  Jeb...Kasich...Rubio...?  I will try  to keep Trump honest and I hope what he said via Twitter is a bit of a  clarification on his stance, but give me a break...you wanted Romney?
968083021114068993 2018-02-26 11:19:13 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack So if the DOJ and the FISA court admit this was politically based oppo research and still issued the warrant based, in large part, on that information...we have a major issue inside our country.pic.twitter.com/5Bg0jyN8pA
968081922340605952 2018-02-26 11:14:51 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack Where is the documentation that was presented to the FISA court about the Steele Dossier.  Lets see that.  Was the factual information that the Dossier was funded by the DNC included in that package as well.  I am going to go with "No" and there is now a huge hole in your story.

966187581099700225 2018-02-20 05:47:24 UTC <EmStorn> @YoungDems4Trump @Pmsm60Trish I know what it was.  I watched the video.  Just seems a bit odd that the kid is all over the place.  Did you watch the interview after the shooting?  I know that most would be shaken, but he is getting spoon fed his lines.  What about that inspires trust?
966187150919290880 2018-02-20 05:45:42 UTC <EmStorn> @wmsdtv Where is the video of you when you are getting interviewed by CNN.  It is compelling.
966115897378254848 2018-02-20 01:02:34 UTC <EmStorn> I don't know if the picture is photo shopped...but it seems odd if it isn't.pic.twitter.com/MnRPbqNi7w
966113315398316032 2018-02-20 00:52:18 UTC <EmStorn> @ThomasWictor I agree that he wants to be famous...but why is he getting coached through this interview or is that just standard CNN type stuff?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKj6NJj8HDo Go to 2:35.  Is that type of coaching normal?
966112185415094273 2018-02-20 00:47:49 UTC <EmStorn> @YoungDems4Trump It does seem odd that this kid is around this much.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKj6NJj8HDo
966027516694720512 2018-02-20 19:11:22 UTC <EmStorn> @RandPaul Senator Paul...I am a huge fan and think you are one of the few principled people in Washington.  That said, how would you change the budget of the military or military procurement processes?  Also, do you think that China and Russia report accurately on what they spend?
966026965638701057 2018-02-20 19:09:11 UTC <EmStorn> @RandPaul @BeccaSutherlan3 What about going through as NICS check is lenient?  Have you ever had to go through one?  Legitimate question here.  I am just not sure what your level of familiarity is with gun law.  What do you think would have worked here in Florida with the exception of the FBI doing its job
965563072206262272 2018-02-19 12:25:50 UTC <EmStorn> @KsKM3 Well...we value fame over form in this country now and when people gain the system, we don't do anything about it.  Think about it in another scenario...there are people that violated the law to get into the US and some how they are in a position to demand something from us?

What it proves is there is not enforcement and the voter rolls are woefully inaccurate.  Dont conflate lack of prosecution with lack of existence.

How about the 350K that Obama spent in Israel trying to meddle in an election?
965223114962587649 2018-02-18 13:54:58 UTC <EmStorn> @ClaireBerlinski How about...as a start...we just don't miss the opportunities to enforce the laws that we have on the books?  As is stands, the FBI could have prevented 4 mass shooting events in the last couple of years if they did their job.

That is fantastic.  Having family that were part of the underground in the Eastern block nations, I hardly think they would have viewed going to the polls and standing in line as a "burden"

965220386492309504 2018-02-18 13:44:07 UTC <EmStorn> @nytopinion @BretStephensNYT For someone who speaks from an assumed position of expertise, you ignore very basic historical examples that are the very basis for 2A.  Don't actually look at the laws on the books where Federal Law Enforcement, if they did their job, would have prevented 4 mass shootings.

965036882005561344 2018-02-17 01:34:56 UTC <EmStorn> @Jgents85 Natural phenomena to an attack on the 2nd Amendment.  People didnt really care about the incorrectly labeled assault weapon until they were illegally banned via the Clinton fiat.  If similar restrictions are even hinted at with respect to 1A, people, justifiably push back.
965035347787898880 2018-02-17 01:28:51 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack You have no idea what you are talking about now.  I thought you actually knew what was going on, but this allows me to peak behind the curtain a bit now.

If, however, you are going to call something a "Right", it needs to be codified in law and enshrined in the Constitution.  If votes are there, by all means...proceed.  Yay...rule of law.

963598004354797568 2018-02-13 02:17:21 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert I already sent you the link to the raw and unsummarized data.  Youll have to put in your own work to actually understand it.
963597387183935488 2018-02-13 02:14:54 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert How about you let me vet your data point and Ill put you in touch with mine?  I mean as long as we are debating using anecdotes, we should be able to enjoy the personal nature of them...no?
963537348788092929 2018-02-13 22:16:20 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert I would be happy to talk to your wife's aunt as well if she would be willing to share her treatment experience with me.

963535935043489792 2018-02-13 22:10:43 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert and I am sure she would be equally as thrilled to talk to you about her dead sister and blind father.  She is a canine ophthalmologist so if you have a dog that needs eye care in Washington, DC, I will be sure to put you in touch.
963535671779561473 2018-02-13 22:09:40 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert So you don't believe my anecdotal story?  But I am supposed to trust yours?  Seems logical.
963535401049907200 2018-02-13 22:08:35 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert without fault.    There is a great article on healthcare that claims you have 3 fundamental principles of health care:  Quality, Affordability, or Universality.  You get to pick 2 out of the 3.  Canada's choice was in one direction and the US has chose another.
963535045150564352 2018-02-13 22:07:11 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert Says you...right?  I would be happy to put you in touch with my friend who's father lost his sight because he was not treated in time or her sister who is dead.  But 192 days and 90% is great.    Listen...there are merits to the Canadian health care, but lets not claim it is

963534458287779841 2018-02-13 22:04:51 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert And you have yet to show that the US doesn't still have the best cancer survival rates (in aggregate) so the onus is on you to prove otherwise.  As a point of order, your cited WHO data does nothing to disprove that fact that was asserted earlier.  Feel free to crunch it yourself
963533301238632448 2018-02-13 22:00:15 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert I will be sure to tell them that they are incorrect because YOU never had any problems.  You are totally right though.  I am the one that is being anecdotal....
963533006605553665 2018-02-13 21:59:05 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert Wait...more anecdotal evidence?  I am shocked.    Should I reference the personal experience that I have of my family friend's sister dying of what she thought (she is a physician) of a treatable cancer?    How about her father going blind by treatable cataracts.
963531377412136960 2018-02-13 21:52:36 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert All I have provided are multiple articles and data points on the matters in discussion.  Feel free to challenged them if you like, but be prepared to have your anecdotal stories and resources challenged when they are questionable...at best.
963530990919520257 2018-02-13 21:51:04 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert Except you don't.  So far, I haven't cited a single instance of an anecdotal story....you have.  Next...you claimed that a WHO study on cancer is the benchmark for data on the subject when the WHO has be all but shown to be rife with corruption, data manipulation, and inaccuracy.
963529745186152450 2018-02-13 21:46:07 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert Its also quite well known that most of the worlds medical technology and development comes out of the US.  Do you think this cost is not going to be felt in the US system?  I guess we could all wait 20 weeks...?https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/health-care-wait-times-hit-20-weeks-in-2016-report-1.3171718
963529542563500033 2018-02-13 21:45:19 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert Your rudimentary evaluation of the data is patently obvious...yes.  Between the anecdotal evidence and claimed infallibility, it is wonder that anyone would challenge your vast expertise.  Yes...they spend less than we do in the US.
963528912407015426 2018-02-13 21:42:48 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert Data points please.  Communism (typically associated with Leftist policy) has murdered more people in history than any other political ideology by order of magnitude.
963528576053149697 2018-02-13 21:41:28 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert So you aren't allowed to question the validity of an organization in crisis when you cite it as valid resource?    So let me get this straight....your information...infallible and therefore unable to challenge.  Why would anyone bother with questioning your position?

963526419459407872 2018-02-13 21:32:54 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert Well...when you present a statement that attempts to invalidate the idea than any culture is superior unless it is superior on all accounts...we are already deep into a logical fallacy.  I am just trying to help you out of your Nascar style circular reasoning.
963525753978712065 2018-02-13 21:30:15 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert citing the WHO...?  You are going to want to get a better source my friend.http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/david-williams1/who-world-health-organisation_b_11581696.html

For the majority, the US has better rates of survival.  Canada is slipping of late...
963524777519566849 2018-02-13 21:26:23 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert I would love to see your data on that.  While some of the survivability rate is due to early diagnosis and possible "over treatment" due to the litigious nature of the US medical malpractice industry, the reality is that the US still has better rates of survivability.
963523894232670208 2018-02-13 21:22:52 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert Great for Canada.  They are also a nation of 36 million people and get taxed at a rate that is higher than we do when you factor in all the local and provincial taxes.  So you are in favor of the government subsidizing family and social policy then?  Straight marriage then too?
963411659200049155 2018-02-13 13:56:53 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert You said this:  "...rather than leaving them to feel they must abort."  How is that not a lack of societal support?
963411375820337152 2018-02-13 13:55:45 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert Who is the arbiter of what is important here and therefore has the "culture" scorecard?  There are vastly superior ideas in Western culture as it comes to ideas of freedom, self determination, liberty, and equality.  Those tend to be the things that the majority find important.
963409451498778625 2018-02-13 13:48:07 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert Anecdotal evidence is just that...anecdotal.  Humans will normally self-sort to surround themselves with people and creatures of similar mindset.  Statistics paint a vastly different picture.
963409028557795328 2018-02-13 13:46:26 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert Keep in mind that the US still has a higher cancer survivability rate than those countries as well.  I am sure we could establish similar systems if you are comfortable with the government taking 60% of your income in taxes as well.
963408743764561920 2018-02-13 13:45:18 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert There are vast reasons.  Just look at those countries that you mention as their populations become less homogeneous with recent influx of immigrants.  Most of them are reporting that the expenses associated with the standards of coverage are going to be fiscally disastrous.
963183788145733632 2018-02-12 22:51:24 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert I would love to see what think is bigotry in Ann's comments.  I would agree that she certainly does not use the more commonly instructed PC verbiage, but I don't see her as a bigot.
963183755065208832 2018-02-12 22:51:16 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert Does she think that some cultures are superior, sure.  Everyone does, including you.  Some are not afraid to stand in that truth whereas other blow over like Fall leaves.
963183702133104640 2018-02-12 22:51:04 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert You may not think that socially progressive is a yay or nay set of values, but they have clear yay or nay positions on stuff like abortion.
963183662639566850 2018-02-12 22:50:54 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert In that case, progressives believe it is a choice and not a child.  They value the "rights" of the mother as decisive over all and including the unborn child's right to existence.
963183628397305857 2018-02-12 22:50:46 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert They subscribe to the very antithesis of what you reference and the vast, vast, vast majority of abortions have absolutely 0.0% to do with the safety of the mother.
963183570280964096 2018-02-12 22:50:32 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert The statistics indicate that 99% are abortions of convenience whether it  be for financial reasons, responsibility, or just wanting to abort an  unwanted child (i.e. birth defect, downs, etc.)
963183552664952837 2018-02-12 22:50:28 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert In what fictional utopia to you reckon that people will have the same health and education opportunities?
963183373752655872 2018-02-12 22:49:46 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert Clearly the US healthcare system is far from perfect, but it is not a true free market system.  Far from it.  That said, I fail to see a better system in existence in the world that is in place over such a vast a diverse population.
963183269452877825 2018-02-12 22:49:21 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert For the record, I mostly agree with you about abortion, I fail to see how you reconcile it with being a progressive though for the reasons stated above.  I also fail to see the corollary between women's devaluation of life somehow being a function of lack of societal support.
963183215711326209 2018-02-12 22:49:08 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert We are kidding ourselves if you think the explosion in number of abortions is due to lack of societal support.  Just the opposite.  Women have been told, mostly by progressives, that it was a bundle of cells and an abortion is nearly equivalent to a routine D&C.

963135987726585858 2018-02-12 19:41:28 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert Pro-Life?
963135955896070144 2018-02-12 19:41:20 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert That was a legitimate question and I am not sure why you are Ann Coulter obsessed.  Were you rebuffed by a slender blond woman?  Obviously you missed the question or are a bit too dull to recognize it.  How do you sort out the obvious differences between socially progressive and
963077514510954497 2018-02-12 15:49:07 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert socially progressive?  The two platforms, at least by those that own the progressives platform, are mutually exclusive as are several of your other descriptors.
963077234406969344 2018-02-12 15:48:00 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert Posting a GIF that illustrates the butt of the joke about doesn't make you clever.  You should probably stop while you are ahead in an attempt to preserve the small fractional bit of testosterone that you have left.  How do you reconcile being pro-Life (which Coulter is) and
963076061763440640 2018-02-12 15:43:20 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack I don't know of anyone that thought he did.  Just another reason to expand a non-ending war effort.
963075720804265985 2018-02-12 15:41:59 UTC <EmStorn> @StefanMolyneux What a beauty.  Great find sir.   If it weren't for double standards...Liberals would have none.
962698248787030016 2018-02-11 14:42:03 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert I wish that were funny but your sense of humor is so simpleton that it is actually unfunny.  It actually draws upon many of the funny things on Twitter in totality and make them less funny.  You have just made Twitter less fun to be on and for that, you should b ashamed.
962411511183486977 2018-02-10 19:42:39 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @McCarrollJoshua @KangBert Apparently you are intimidated by smart and attractive women.
962372288552296450 2018-02-10 17:06:48 UTC <EmStorn> @DRUDGE_REPORT I am just surprised that law enforcement didn't loose the body or allow it to be stolen in the meantime.

962367027242561536 2018-02-10 16:45:53 UTC <EmStorn> @nytimes @David_Rigby Incorrect.  Bill Kristol and Washington Free Beacon originally sponsored the Opposition research.  They DID NOT pay for the dossier and were long since done with Fusion GPS at the time that the dossier was released.

961919255011823617 2018-02-09 11:06:36 UTC <EmStorn> @PatrickRuffini So GW Bush is now a hero?  I can't take anyone serious that says that.
961918194016555008 2018-02-09 11:02:23 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack You claim you want to be an adult and deal with "facts", but I have posted several pieces of information and factually based questions in response to some of your postings with ZERO response.  Who is not being the adult here Jack?  This post reeks of self-aggrandizement.
961653163571990528 2018-02-08 17:29:15 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack Who is saying that people in his campaign weren't doing some potentially stupid stuff?  What I am saying is that there is no legal definition of "collusion"  Show me the evidence where Russia impacted the outcome of the election.
961651096270852098 2018-02-08 17:21:02 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack @kikimunchkin Stop trying.  He is on the side of self promotion at this point.    I hope that he is just challenging the accepted logic to get people to think critically, but he hasn't demonstrated any critical thinking on his own when confronted with reasonable facts that undermine his ideas.
961650403912843270 2018-02-08 17:18:17 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack ....so you don't know?  I guess it makes sense to trust the FBI and DOJ that clearly haven't yet demonstrated any partisanship corruption or weren't convinced that Hillary was a shoo-in so that their corruption wouldn't be discovered.  Clearly Adam Schiff is honorable....right?
961589840386187264 2018-02-08 13:17:38 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack shows that the likely scenario was that the information was pulled directly via hard-wired connection.
961589733787947008 2018-02-08 13:17:12 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack So you start out by saying that her email was clearly hacked by Russia and then post a snippet of an article that says there was no evidence of a direct hack????  Do you actually read and reply or just post because I posted and article that indicates that the speed of the data

961305549693472768 2018-02-07 18:27:57 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack Actually...all of them are mutually important.  If you think that the private sector won't draft a way around eVerify before the government figures it out, you haven't paid attention to history.  All of them need to be done concurrently and there is no reason they can't be.
961305207912136704 2018-02-07 18:26:36 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack Jack...any updates on the questions raised that you haven't addressed? Serious question here.    You are lobbing some serious accusations and then saying nothing when valid counterpoints are raised except to call folks conspiracy theorists. The ad hominem is a bit below you...no?

961235803304349697 2018-02-07 13:50:49 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack Please explain to me why Andrew McCabe would have resigned at this point and claimed (under testimony) that the dossier was integral to the FISA warrant.  Where is your information to refute that claim?
961235599989657601 2018-02-07 13:50:00 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack What about the fact that the person at the center of the start of the Russian collusion connection is now supposedly under investigation?  https://www.dailywire.com/news/26738/square-one-man-clinton-foundation-scandal-led-fbi-ryan-saavedra?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_content=062316-news&utm_campaign=dwbrand

960848824439922688 2018-02-06 12:13:06 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack If the claim is that the FBI and DOJ was corrupted...he absolutely is vindicated.  If the statements from McCabe that the dossier was integral to the FISA warrant, Trump is vindicated that the FBI and DOJ are completely corrupted at the upper levels.  Clinton Email "matter"....?
960846385586327552 2018-02-06 12:03:24 UTC <EmStorn> @ggreenwald Folks seem to cleverly ignore the fact that he lied continuously about illegal acts to Congress.  Oh...the standards of some folks.
960509951700602881 2018-02-05 13:46:32 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack Even if what you are saying is true, it does not meet the legal definition of collusion.
960509431858520065 2018-02-05 13:44:28 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack So...this means he is a criminal?  Tell me what crime you think or have a shred of proof about?    Is consulting to a foreign entity about energy policy now a high crime and treasonous?

960200233492807681 2018-02-04 17:15:49 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack Who has said it does have a direct impact on the Russia probe as it relates to Pappadopolous?  That said, show me the confines and the criminality of the investigation as it relates to that tree of evidence and not the boundless scope resultant to a fake dossier.
960155335146266626 2018-02-04 14:17:25 UTC <EmStorn> @benshapiro Please tell me there is some sort of crime he can be charged with.  The complete and utter abdication of any sort of Constitutional backing from the most senior law enforcement officer has to be punishable by something....please.

960152511394050049 2018-02-04 14:06:12 UTC <EmStorn> @justinamash @RandPaul The time for openness in this process is now.  There is nothing about be in adherence with the Constitution that jeopardizes national security.  I am tire of that lazy and dishonest argument.
959995713080918016 2018-02-03 03:43:08 UTC <EmStorn> @JJWatt @Nationwide Another white guy...not surprising
959995285681377280 2018-02-03 03:41:26 UTC <EmStorn> @benshapiro As you well know, the DOJ and FBI can find process crimes if you give them wide enough birth and completely unfettered access.  While the Greek kid and th comments to the Australian may have opened the door...WHERE IS THE CRIME?
959994812400390145 2018-02-03 03:39:33 UTC <EmStorn> @benshapiro And if the FBI is this infiltrated by partisan ineptitude, disregard for Civil Rights, and possibly illegality...why would we trust an investigation with no crime or boundaries?
959993636594307072 2018-02-03 03:34:53 UTC <EmStorn> @TomFitton Amen to that!!!
959986232926326784 2018-02-03 03:05:28 UTC <EmStorn> @jax_superdave @USNJack Not lied too?  The McCabe testimony states the dossier was paramount to the approval and people in the FBI knew the information was at least minimally corrupted by Steele.
959965988128280576 2018-02-03 01:45:01 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack @MattAHay So Jack is incorrect on his assessment here.
959959522067537920 2018-02-03 01:19:19 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack @MattAHay Dont you go to the same judge for renewals?
959958933598326784 2018-02-03 01:16:59 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack They arent corrupt, but he system is lazy and the FBI exploited that fact that zero verification and vetting was required.  Next time, why dont we just write the application in crayon from a 6 year old.
959958520643948544 2018-02-03 01:15:21 UTC <EmStorn> @kylegriffin1 What I love is rhe party that conspired with USSR to thwart the election of Reagan is now anti Russia.  Still waiting on the evidence though
959957664615759872 2018-02-03 01:11:57 UTC <EmStorn> @kylegriffin1 What about unofficial did you not understand?  Does anyone that has business dealings with Russia now a foreign agent?  Only if they are a republican...right?
959952219864027136 2018-02-03 00:50:18 UTC <EmStorn> @realDonaldTrump @COGICFamily Except for the fact that nobody (including Democrats) have denied the FACTUAL accuracy of the memo.  Dont let facts get in the way of your uninformed narrative though.   The IG report will be based on the FISA warrant and supporting documents.
959822069667123200 2018-02-03 16:13:08 UTC <EmStorn> @USNJack @RowdyRedpilled +1.    The fact than an unverified accusation, regardless if Steele was previously used as a credible source, was the basis of a FISA warrant just demonstrates the lack of any Constitutional law.  Where are the charges against Page if he's high value?
959820892502183936 2018-02-03 16:08:28 UTC <EmStorn> @RealOmarNavarro Go OMAR!!!!

She wasn't following the rules and she was asked to leave.  End of story.  Sell wounded outrage elsewhere.
958349239637098496 2018-01-30 14:40:38 UTC <EmStorn> @AmericanAir @JenSelter @kfrancy addict that was kicked off the other flight before.  Give me a break.  She was asked to leave and what sort of victim culture are you going to cite here?  Are you going to claim that the cop was now an anti-Semite when clearly he didn't even know she was Jewish?
958348991992745985 2018-01-30 14:39:39 UTC <EmStorn> @AmericanAir @JenSelter @kfrancy "do my research.."  You have an over-inflated sense of self to think that you would occupy a minute of my time.  That said, your commentary is laughable and you don't understand the law with regarding to flying (i.e. rental of a seat).  I am sure you were quick to defend the drug
958348361329004544 2018-01-30 14:37:09 UTC <EmStorn> @KimKardashian @IMKeishaMonique Clearly it is more famous for "Fulani" than it is for Bo Derek.  Obviously.  If this is what people are really upset about, the pioneers of Civil Rights that actually suffered for their cause (some of whom with their lives) are turning over in their graves.

957952551420420096 2018-01-29 12:24:20 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding I think we learned that Senate Democrats would happily deprive American Citizens, some of whom are serving in harms way, are less important than the 800,000 or so DACA recipients.  I guess when your know and stated policy is to secure voters, http://dailycaller.com/2018/01/08/leaked-memo-dreamers-are-critical-to-dems-future-electoral-success/, who cares.
957947059402956800 2018-01-29 12:02:31 UTC <EmStorn> @AmericanAir @JenSelter Looks like @kfrancy is trying to preserve an outside shot to come off as the hero.  News flash buddy...I don't think this is going to translate to a date for you regardless of the pseudo hero stance.
956525752262053888 2018-01-25 13:54:45 UTC <EmStorn> @JoyAnnReid Why would anyone take the comments of someone that is so clearly a homophobe seriously?

You are a clown and if I were you, I would save as much money as you can.  You worked for one of the biggest criminals to occupy the oval office and you better hope this doesn't come back to you.

Seeing at the majority party in the Senate can't pass this on their own and the Democrats are holding a budget up over a non-budget item
955094609948020736 2018-01-21 15:07:54 UTC <EmStorn> @benshapiro @Moj_kobe And this...my friends...is what millennial "accomplishment" looks like today.  Mind you...they are eating their parents' Tide pods, in their parents' basement, and have a better chance of solving the cold fusion reaction formula than getting a load of laundry done.
954896221566578689 2018-01-20 01:59:34 UTC <EmStorn> @SenateMajLdr @tango_whiskee So the needs of 800,000 people that, even if through no fault of their own, are in the country illegally are more important than the citizenry?  So we ar clear on that.
954777072962101249 2018-01-20 18:06:07 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding Yes.  God forbid folks try to grown the economy.
954513596318474240 2018-01-19 00:39:10 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding And if Democrats weren't holding a CR hostage because of 600,000 people with legal status until March...it wouldn't be an issue either.  But hey...no need for facts.

954510231345729536 2018-01-19 00:25:47 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding And how many Democrats will be voting to continue the funding for CHIP for the next 6 years?
954464680839401472 2018-01-19 21:24:47 UTC <EmStorn> Wrong link.    This one:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2FG2RJKgOIhttps://twitter.com/healthfunding/status/954132674138034178
954463611421937665 2018-01-19 21:20:32 UTC <EmStorn> @germanrlopez @DrFrieden @Loyal_GOP And how effective is that flu vaccine this year...?
954462470927724546 2018-01-19 21:16:00 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding So one blowhard from the Gang of 8 is not going to vote for the CR?  What about all the Democrats that won't be counted in the 60 required?  Seems to be that Schumer likened this to holding someone hostage just a few years ago.  Why is it different now?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tjdh4RF52Bs

954353850034655238 2018-01-19 14:04:23 UTC <EmStorn> @ggreenwald differences are the the GOP is a party of law.  They should get it released via legal means.  There are ways.
954353422358204416 2018-01-19 14:02:41 UTC <EmStorn> @ezraklein On "Earth 2" you also don't get to learn how the "Justice" department was weaponized against the opposition candidate, the rights of a citizens trampled on, and how the winning candidate violated more laws that Al Capone....but don't let facts get in the way of your cute reverie.
954352574479650822 2018-01-19 13:59:19 UTC <EmStorn> @JamesDelingpole @BreitbartNews He is so good.  There should have been a disclaimer on that video of the interview because is was a proper whooping.

953977308137840640 2018-01-18 13:08:08 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding @RachelFey Nothing like a bunch of government money to prop up entire industries while actively contributing to the addiction of millions of Americans.  But hey...the FDA says it safe so go for it.
953976309952270337 2018-01-18 13:04:10 UTC <EmStorn> @ASlavitt So the same people that scream bloody murder if we meddle in another country now want us to usurp the elected and entrenched government (albeit completely ineffective) and do what????  How exactly do you suggest that we otherwise repair a failed state that is unincorporated?

953775944493338625 2018-01-17 23:48:00 UTC <EmStorn> @hboulware I watched a couple of her videos after this story came out...she kinda sucks at it to if you ask me.  Take away the big plastic bolt ons and you have an average looking gal with an above average sized tush.  I don't think she was even popular prior to this so...ulterior motive???
953609922574471168 2018-01-17 12:48:17 UTC <EmStorn> @redsteeze @MaerRoshan think that there wouldn't be marching in the streets with funny pink hats if that were a Republican talking to a female member of a Democratic cabinet.  If you can't acknowledge even that hypocrisy, you aren't residing on planet Earth.
953608732419739648 2018-01-17 12:43:33 UTC <EmStorn> @CoryBooker @Alyssa_Milano @kennyPIemshoff @HeinsDan Nothing better "than" seeing a dumbsh*t point shown for the stupidity it is rife with.  I normally abhor grammar Nazism, but when it is directed as someone who claims to be the "Resistance"...I make an exception.
953606658005131264 2018-01-17 12:35:19 UTC <EmStorn> @CoryBooker @Alyssa_Milano God Help us if this is what you think "leadership" looks like.
953407895902748672 2018-01-16 23:25:30 UTC <EmStorn> @nwarikoo Seeing as DACA has not been ceased at this point....how exactly is this President Trumps fault.  Despite the past precedent of Obama, you don't get to choose what laws you do or don't enforce.
953096253646233601 2018-01-15 02:47:09 UTC <EmStorn> @AmyMek Goodbye Germany.  You were nice for a while.
951445387642134534 2018-01-11 13:27:12 UTC <EmStorn> @brhodes @BretStephensNYT @HoldenMirror So the "American" press is the only factual one?  Who is the idiot here?  If you actually read Al Jazeera and some other sources, you will see they actually do some reporting.  You also realize it was a Lebanese paper that broke the Iran-Contra affair...but yeah...you're smart.
951444818827374593 2018-01-11 13:24:56 UTC <EmStorn> @brhodes @marthamaccallum @BretStephensNYT @Taball25Thurman @Maggyw519 anyone with the self-aggrandized impression of themself as a "resistant" when they go to Starbucks for their soy latte grande is already not to be taken seriously.  But why let facts get in the way of your opinion (i.e. birther, Obama assassinating an American citizen, etc.).
951444083981025280 2018-01-11 13:22:01 UTC <EmStorn> @brhodes @BretStephensNYT Nothing to see here.  Just the Obama administration determining "who" is actually allow to act in their best interest in a given region.
951150613118750721 2018-01-10 17:55:52 UTC <EmStorn> @benshapiro Looks like a terd that is stood on end...kind of like Obama's Presidency.
950886913677905920 2018-01-09 00:28:01 UTC <EmStorn> @IvankaTrump @branfan91 There are a whole mess of folks that we are applauding as they stood up at the Golden Globes that knew of the culture of abuse in Hollywood including this idiot @jasonsfolly ....where is the outrage of his participation in an industry that has long since abused women?
950886376458858498 2018-01-09 00:25:53 UTC <EmStorn> @IvankaTrump @jasonsfolly @branfan91 Its Emily with a capital "E".  Thanks.  So her father being accused of this means that she can support a woman's cause or is somehow dumb and you are cleared in hot to attack her?  Oprah was longtime friends with Harvey Weinstein, should that somehow invalidate her opinion too?
950851420449886208 2018-01-09 22:06:59 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding Didn't he say previously they would make a good ticket with her as the VP?  Now, if the media would cover the legality of the FISA warrants and the fact that an opposition candidate may have been illegally spied on by the justice department...then we might have something.
950848366765887488 2018-01-09 21:54:51 UTC <EmStorn> @IvankaTrump @jasonsfolly So you attack a woman that applauds Oprah's speech about women...but because you are a liberal and she has the last name of Trump...its okay.  And nobody sees any double standard here?  How about you just zip your trap until you have suffered one second for being a woman.
950719574856617984 2018-01-09 13:23:04 UTC <EmStorn> @HillaryClinton Sending out a tweet that confirms that information was illegally shared with a private citizen by the sitting administration.....Ooops....
950709064757137408 2018-01-09 12:41:19 UTC <EmStorn> @ggreenwald What about persons training for their own safety and survivability is so jarring to you?
950171532067786752 2018-01-07 01:05:21 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding @Philip_Elliott The government has been shut down 17 times by my count, and we are still here.  7 or 8 times under Reagan alone.  I did not appear to mortally wound his reelection bid or the economy at the time.  If my choices are to have a budgetary fight or kick the can, I am for resolution.
950170667349106688 2018-01-07 01:01:55 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding @Philip_Elliott I don't necessarily disagree with any of those things, but if you aren't going to stand for something, you won't stand for anything.  If there is a legitimate policy/budgetary disagreement and the government is getting shut down as a bargaining position, so be it.
949985594154856448 2018-01-07 12:46:30 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding Most back "injuries" are a result of core instability.  Start by strengthening your abdominal muscles first.

949983583120347136 2018-01-07 12:38:30 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding @Philip_Elliott Why?  We have shut down the government countless times before as a negotiating point?  Seeing as employees are still compensated, what is the fear?  Why shouldn't the government be forced to abide the same fiduciary laws that the rest of the citizens are?
948946647882653701 2018-01-04 15:58:06 UTC <EmStorn> The ownage is so epic!!! Well done @TheLastRefuge2   Sorry about your shitty story @maggieNYT http://www.loyarburok.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Reporting_bribery_for_dummies.jpg
948853025048756224 2018-01-04 09:46:04 UTC <EmStorn> @CDCDirector @chronicpainwar This is the natural byproduct of putting government in charge of your healthcare.
948542019957411840 2018-01-03 13:10:15 UTC <EmStorn> @DRUDGE_REPORT Add it to the charges and add it to his sentencing.  Piece of human garbage.
948541168761139200 2018-01-03 13:06:52 UTC <EmStorn> @realDonaldTrump @jcjjcjjcjjcj And then Hillary claimed it was rigged after she got trounced.  Go figure.
948408498114781185 2018-01-02 04:19:41 UTC <EmStorn> @jrovner Definitely demonstrates a massive growth in public insurance.  Good to see that Administration costs have risen to an all time high as a percentage as well.  Ah...I love the smell of bureaucracy in the morning.

He was revolutionary and probably moved the cause of civil rights further...with comedy...than the combined efforts of Hollywood during his time in the industry.

You also want the government to take over Healthcare and nearly every other private industry.

943833064525959168 2017-12-21 13:18:32 UTC <EmStorn> @hormiga How about those "shovel ready" projects.  Shouldn't the US be sterling after a trillion in a stimulus bill.  Teachers are paid on a state level, Social security is done regardless (its gone), renewable energy shouldn't be steered by the fed, etc. etc.  Capitalism can do all that.
943832552573464576 2017-12-21 13:16:30 UTC <EmStorn> @hormiga Welp...most people want more of their money back from the Federal government and given the historically high rate of waste at the Federal level, making the government do more with less might be a worthwhile idea.  Also begs the question why you would trust an entity like the fed

943610233540218880 2017-12-20 22:33:05 UTC <EmStorn> @JoyAnnReid Soaring deficits....you mean the ones that are smaller than what Obama operated on a yearly basis?
943582987773497346 2017-12-20 20:44:49 UTC <EmStorn> @StefanMolyneux You deserve it.  I enjoy your content.  You are a smart cookie.
943578998587748353 2017-12-20 20:28:58 UTC <EmStorn> @JoyAnnReid This is certainly news worthy.  Let me guess...this is his fault.    You do realize that you are picking on the appearance of something (i.e. appearance shaming) in an effort to somehow tie this to the President.  Could you be any more worthless as a news reporter?
943490775559663616 2017-12-20 14:38:24 UTC <EmStorn> @eschor @heatherscope @seungminkim @politico @FAIRImmigration @McroyTaylor NO!  They should not be given citizenship regardless.  If we want to see them to a more permanent status, so be it...but they should NOT be given any citizenship.

943466044135526400 2017-12-20 13:00:08 UTC <EmStorn> @JoyAnnReid This is possible some of the most vomitious and craptastic mass I have seen on Twitter.  That is saying something.

942833565460520961 2017-12-18 19:06:53 UTC <EmStorn> @JoyAnnReid @TopRopeTravis If this is a typical democratic response to this...you guys are f*cked as a party.
942833095195217921 2017-12-18 19:05:01 UTC <EmStorn> @JoyAnnReid So says a person that knows absolutely jack shit about infrastructure, the cause of the accident, or railways outside of your riding on a train once.  Give me a break you uninformed loon.  Can't you wait to actually let the smart people figure out what caused the wreck.

942782447175000064 2017-12-18 15:43:46 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding Ah...irony.  The title raises a valid question though.  How much is enough when the people that have actually budgeted for health care pay their bills while some folks decide other things are more important?  I would love to have a new car, but my budget dictates otherwise.

942742537520975872 2017-12-18 13:05:10 UTC <EmStorn> @StefanMolyneux a bit more leg...?  No in all seriousness...keep doing what you are doing.  I do love your interviews though.
942742184557727745 2017-12-18 13:03:46 UTC <EmStorn> @CDCgov @healthfunding @davidhldunn Agreed.  For the record, transgender is a new condition and given it relatively unresolved status inside the medical/scientific community (i.e. the DSM just recognized it like 2 years ago), I don't think the CDC should be treading in those waters.  To hell with facts though....
942741329590800384 2017-12-18 13:00:22 UTC <EmStorn> @realDonaldTrump @cenkuygur I am guessing that despite the fact that you comment on politics, that you don't understand the Constitution and what is a protected power of the President.  Call it a hunch.  For someone representing themself as smart, you are pretty flipping stupid.
941282021464313856 2017-12-14 12:21:36 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding You both realize that "nuclear" option was a direct result of Senate rules changes under Reid majority leadership i.e. "vote on cloture".  You knew that though.  Once you open the box, you can't put it back in.
941065113305481216 2017-12-13 21:59:41 UTC <EmStorn> @chronicle @BurrowJoseph @PresidentISEP This is interesting.  Any connections to the FBI with your information?
941046802488483840 2017-12-13 20:46:56 UTC <EmStorn> @infowars Interesting question....
941046062613172224 2017-12-13 20:43:59 UTC <EmStorn> How do you feel about abortion at 35 weeks Senator Elect?
941045699160010754 2017-12-13 20:42:33 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding @ChadPergram So who is holding the government hostage here then?  Democrats or Republicans?
941016545169494016 2017-12-13 18:46:42 UTC <EmStorn> @MorganJerkins Probably should be spending that effort figuring out how to keep a husband.
941016154151247872 2017-12-13 18:45:09 UTC <EmStorn> @JoshuaThotties For real though.  Why wouldn't she want to hang out with such an upstanding person as you.  Might be your general appearance or your attitude.
940583735208108032 2017-12-12 14:06:52 UTC <EmStorn> @AmyMek And they will keep doing it regardless of whether someone just tried to blow up a bunch of people in the name of their religion of "Peace"
940205625430151170 2017-12-11 13:04:23 UTC <EmStorn> @Toure @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow So if nonviolence is critical, will we denounce the "fry em like bacon" comments?  How about the calls for officer shootings?
940204876591706112 2017-12-11 13:01:25 UTC <EmStorn> @JoyAnnReid Please get some better guests.  Toure is not a great guest and he is slightly racist if you recall his comments on Rachel Dolezal.  Attacking someone for being transracial is terrible.  Who is he going to attack next, transgenders?
939875661396758528 2017-12-10 15:13:14 UTC <EmStorn> @JoyAnnReid @kylegriffin1 Well...Intelligence Community and DOJ...you traded your reputation away for a seat at the power table.  Calling something a "matter" to keep from appropriately labeling a criminal act, having senior members of an investigative team at a victory party for the opposition candidate
939875101914345472 2017-12-10 15:11:00 UTC <EmStorn> @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow How about just following the law that was passed in 1995?

939861051855613953 2017-12-10 14:15:11 UTC <EmStorn> @JoyAnnReid @MEPFuller Why would you tolerate a mistake from someone if their job is to report the information accurately?  When the news misreports on things, people can get hurt of killed.  If I make a mistake at my job, it can cost me my job.  Shouldn't the same standard be met here?
939860438384340993 2017-12-10 14:12:44 UTC <EmStorn> @ColinKahl The day that Michael Flynn was guilty of making a false statement after being set up by the DOJ....that day.  What a day to applaud indeed.  How many Clinton and Obama holdovers are working under the radar in the DOJ to use that department as weapon do you thing?
939696951699877889 2017-12-09 03:23:06 UTC <EmStorn> @MuslimIQ Take out the suicide numbers and then you might form a slightly intelligent debate.

938911144294707205 2017-12-07 23:20:35 UTC <EmStorn> @thenation @joanwalsh So you don't see a possible difference between women that come out of the woodwork about a man that was long since famous during an election cycle vs. coming out against a standing senator who is not running?  No ulterior motives in one vs. the other?

934787212197195776 2017-11-26 14:13:33 UTC <EmStorn> @RileyChildrens I hope you do the right thing and fire this employee immediately if it is proven true that she made these statements.  There is no place for that when someone is trusted with the care and oversight of people in need.
934629359658393600 2017-11-25 03:46:18 UTC <EmStorn> @DonCheadle @ddale8 Why wouldn't that be relevant information in the totality of information to be collected?  If you look at a persons criminality, you do ask about family history, etc.  This would be a part of that.
934628790902362113 2017-11-25 03:44:02 UTC <EmStorn> @DonCheadle Power of the purse.  Just like I have stopped consuming anything from Hollywood.

934428142818689024 2017-11-25 14:26:44 UTC <EmStorn> @SomethingTexty I'm gonna guess that you don't have to worry about that.
934427817554608128 2017-11-25 14:25:27 UTC <EmStorn> @Iron2SharpnIron I don't disagree with you that the whole "go to college" thing was BS and has been propped up by universities in cahoots when the government.  Doesn't change the fact that nobody told her to take on that debt.
934427503413858304 2017-11-25 14:24:12 UTC <EmStorn> @Iron2SharpnIron You still don't have to go into massive debt to get a degree.  The community college systems in many states are awesome and you can do two of your 4 years there and still work to pay your bills.  So what if you don't get your schooling done in 4 years and it takes 6 or 7?
933684531030319104 2017-11-23 13:11:53 UTC <EmStorn> @BetteMidler @realmleez @ActressDebbie You aren't too smart are you?  As soon as the guitarist comes out and says that he either objected or did not discuss this with her previously to do it as "part of the show" then you have a point.  Otherwise you are just victim shaming and shame on you for that!!

933668504896770048 2017-11-23 12:08:12 UTC <EmStorn> "the rich"....who forced any of these folks to take on this debt and stop paying their bills?https://twitter.com/Iron2SharpnIron/status/932266974910042112

931896655133241344 2017-11-18 14:47:31 UTC <EmStorn> @JackPosobiec Seriously...how was this woman going to be President.  She is a physical mess.
931896394243330049 2017-11-18 14:46:28 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding Well....if Zach Braff says it then clearly he is an authority on taxation in this country.  How about we get rid of all the deductions for families, mortgages, state taxes, etc. and just lower the rates for everybody.  I am in favor of that.
931524291748880384 2017-11-17 14:07:52 UTC <EmStorn> Seems reasonable.https://twitter.com/FAIRImmigration/status/930480553664679943
931512863532965888 2017-11-17 13:22:27 UTC <EmStorn> @Alysson @dobberdidit So...I was talking to Alysson...not you.
931512657743679488 2017-11-17 13:21:38 UTC <EmStorn> @Alysson @dobberdidit Umm....what?  So you are telling me that a rich dude in power has been sued.  Wow.  If any of these cases had been adjudicated or even settled...don't you think we would know?  We leak top secret stuff on the daily.  You don't think this would be out?
930758136939544576 2017-11-15 11:23:27 UTC <EmStorn> @espn @CNN @jemelehill @bchandler25 @RuaneConor @sisyfus2 Ironically...it was Democrats thinking that Hillary was going to loose the popular vote but win the EC handily.  Then the EC would have been very just and forward thinking of the founders.  Do some research on why they came up with it and you might be enlightened.
930757509035515905 2017-11-15 11:20:57 UTC <EmStorn> @jemelehill @CameronSimoneau @mrudy34 @Hope_Carter So do tell us...what are these glaring examples of racism from this president?  Is it the employ of several black staff members in upper management and critical positions?  Is it conducting business in a very multiracial community like New York?
930285615463223296 2017-11-13 04:05:49 UTC <EmStorn> @dobberdidit @Alysson A troll?  Because I don't put my highly staged and perfectly angled picture on my profile page?  That seems disingenuous.  Do you have anything that would even approach being considered intelligent to say on the matter or do you prefer personal insults as a defacto response?
930267840602693635 2017-11-13 02:55:11 UTC <EmStorn> @Alysson Do tell me, try to use your words like a big girl, why that case was dropped then?  More Russian collusion I suspect?  I mean if it works for Takei to blame that...why not this too?
930266521976393733 2017-11-13 02:49:57 UTC <EmStorn> @SenSchumer @RoyBlunt @SenJohnMcCain @SenFranken @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @OrrinHatch @Alysson @dobberdidit Why didn't she come forward with this case?  Might it have something to do with the fact that bearing false witness is punishable in New York?  How about in CA?
930265825579290626 2017-11-13 02:47:10 UTC <EmStorn> @SusanDanzig219 @OrrinHatch @murielcooperI @catawu @MichelleAdamov Yep.  Just think, we would have to empty out hollywood and the Clinton family if we got rid of those type of folks.

928251668856233984 2017-11-08 13:23:38 UTC <EmStorn> @JeffFlake Maybe if you had rallied support for the Gravely-Cruz legislation after Sandy Hook, this would have been stopped.  But wait....government didn't do its job before so surely more laws will work "better" this time?
927153477213741057 2017-11-05 12:39:49 UTC <EmStorn> @MHarrisPerry @hobsonshelley @GrayceHatch Amen to both of these comments.  The Democratic party (now documented by the manipulation of the primary) has abused voting blocks for years
927153044495638528 2017-11-05 12:38:06 UTC <EmStorn> @sahilkapur I guess we shouldn't require the government to spend less in any way should we?
926802444742307840 2017-11-04 13:24:56 UTC <EmStorn> @davidhorsey You knew exactly what you were doing.  Just look at your feed.  Regardless, calling someone fat is a bold move for an old wrinkled ginger.

926055404089565185 2017-11-02 11:56:28 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding Some would argue that the Opiods aren't the issue.  What will folks start shooting, snorting, or smoking next.
925837677752193030 2017-11-01 21:31:18 UTC <EmStorn> @isaacstonefish Silly goose...just a "bit" of terrorism.  Nothing to see here.  Time to issue some more VISAs.
925711229888364545 2017-11-01 13:08:50 UTC <EmStorn> @NickKristof Wow.  Just wow.  You are special.
925704227133050880 2017-11-01 12:41:01 UTC <EmStorn> @US_FDA @healthfunding Kratom is proven effective for some folks, but Pharma can make billions on it, its banned.  Get the government out of healthcare business!!!
925703486356049920 2017-11-01 12:38:04 UTC <EmStorn> @realDonaldTrump All the more reason to revise and scrutinize our immigration policies.  Please hold that idiot with the Chamber of the Commerce accountable.
925703083052605440 2017-11-01 12:36:28 UTC <EmStorn> @realDonaldTrump @AliCologne Seeing as he entered via the diversity lottery...I am not sure you can call this "domestic" terrorism.
924973075988348929 2017-10-30 12:15:41 UTC <EmStorn> @RT_com Nice figure on her.
924969444056752128 2017-10-30 12:01:15 UTC <EmStorn> @SenKamalaHarris This is good news.  Folks that are here illegally and siphoning resources from folks that are here legally should be removed.  Great news!!
922082173980741632 2017-10-22 12:48:16 UTC <EmStorn> @CBSNews Is he f*cking serious.  He is a great actor to say that with a straight face.
921042673972269056 2017-10-19 15:57:40 UTC <EmStorn> Nothing to see here folks.  Sorry to see Canada go into the toilet.https://twitter.com/AmyMek/status/920355321960419328

917327634916364294 2017-10-09 09:55:25 UTC <EmStorn> @thehill Anyone heard of UVA and a completely made up BS Rolling Stone story?https://qz.com/980766/the-truth-about-false-rape-accusations/

917325913729175552 2017-10-09 09:48:35 UTC <EmStorn> @voxdotcom For f*cks sake.
917325211342639104 2017-10-09 09:45:48 UTC <EmStorn> @ByronYork @viviansampson17 +1.  Thanks for your service as well.  I guess you missed the other part of the 1A that allows him to comment on their protest?
917173976404779008 2017-10-08 23:44:50 UTC <EmStorn> @E_Reid35 @jenniferleechan @plaverty24 Why is this a black vs. white issue?  You know how many white men get shot by the police?
917173807626014721 2017-10-08 23:44:10 UTC <EmStorn> @E_Reid35 @jenniferleechan Says a guy that doesn't know what the f*ck oppression even looks like.
917067447039127552 2017-10-08 16:41:32 UTC <EmStorn> So true. https://twitter.com/bkerogers/status/916906295726309376

916286593098493952 2017-10-06 12:58:42 UTC <EmStorn> @haaretzcom It was not approved via the Senate under normal order rules.  Anyone else here give a shit about the Constitution?
915697491932336130 2017-10-04 21:57:49 UTC <EmStorn> @PattyArquette Brilliant feedback.  Please run for office.  You have just that type of sharp intellect that DC seems to attract.
915696250514755585 2017-10-04 21:52:53 UTC <EmStorn> @ronaldo129 @johnlegend @GrassrootsSpeak Trending on the murder rate was already on the way down.  The ban didn't do that and private gun ownership is higher than ever before.
915338293277024257 2017-10-03 22:10:29 UTC <EmStorn> @JBurtonXP Love it.  Finally some good news reporting.
915181281570324480 2017-10-03 11:46:35 UTC <EmStorn> @sethmoulton Nothing like jumping to a conclusion when you don't even know how he obtained his firearms.  Solid thinking there.
912849549340942338 2017-09-26 01:21:07 UTC <EmStorn> @AnnCoulter @ToddSmekens Spoken like someone who clearly has never done a ride along, studied statistics, or in possession of a fully functional brain.
912683079776555009 2017-09-26 14:19:37 UTC <EmStorn> @neiltyson @StevenDietrich2 @uzairuzairuzair I think your autocorrect kicked in here.  Your tweet should have read "I am a cuck"
912682701748043776 2017-09-26 14:18:07 UTC <EmStorn> @neiltyson Further proof that you shouldn't tweet before 6AM.
912489886762094592 2017-09-25 01:31:56 UTC <EmStorn> @lsarsour Not enough...some might argue
912452242015444993 2017-09-25 23:02:21 UTC <EmStorn> @realDonaldTrump @Alyssa_Milano @MissPerot You are clearly someone that doesn't understand case law or class action law.  I would encourage read or risk more dullard behavior.
912446338209648640 2017-09-25 22:38:54 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding Who said anything about "replace" in the first place.  Seeing as government can't do anything efficiently, how about a market based option?
912445674867879936 2017-09-25 22:36:15 UTC <EmStorn> @BreitbartNews @FAIRImmigration Clearly you are racist and they are just misunderstood....

911952500781195264 2017-09-24 13:56:34 UTC <EmStorn> @arielzilber @MailOnline @FAIRImmigration I guess we need to import more rapist because we aren't keeping up with the demand....?
911613972700418050 2017-09-23 15:31:22 UTC <EmStorn> @JuddLegum He's a dunce for not seeing he is a puppet.  Have some class Spicer.
911601952664014848 2017-09-23 14:43:36 UTC <EmStorn> @JoyAnnReid @JoeB2112 I guess you don't have shit to say when called out on your bullshit.  Typical.
911601705111969792 2017-09-23 14:42:37 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding He is a malcontent and a liar.  His e-election bid on the back of this idea (i.e. repeal) and is a liar.  Just ask his ex-wife.
909891373263974401 2017-09-18 21:26:23 UTC <EmStorn> @Kaepernick7 @ShaunKing He is just like you too, raised by white parents.
909516800496472064 2017-09-17 20:37:57 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding @aaronecarroll How about NIH funding for the record high suicide rates?http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/03/health/teen-suicide-cdc-study-bn/index.html
909516310278819841 2017-09-17 20:36:01 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding It would probably mean that we would go the way of Greece and other equally fiscally irresponsible countries.
909448609841561600 2017-09-17 16:06:59 UTC <EmStorn> @greenhousenyt Do you support a border wall?
909126194599202817 2017-09-16 18:45:50 UTC <EmStorn> @JoyAnnReid @JoeB2112 Classic response, calling someone a racist, from someone without a position.  The other 7 rantings you just made are equally as witless.
908491478523146241 2017-09-14 00:43:42 UTC <EmStorn> @JoyAnnReid @JoeB2112 I'll wait patiently for your examples.

907740481358110720 2017-09-12 22:59:30 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding West Virginia is the picture of governmental efficiency.  Of course he would be the best ambassador to champion this idea.
907739597056212992 2017-09-12 22:55:59 UTC <EmStorn> @GOVERNING Where are the links to the data from which you draw your article?
904430526383181826 2017-09-03 19:46:55 UTC <EmStorn> @senorrinhatch @Linksman102 Sounds great.  They should do great on their own then.  i am sure national defense of a large coastline will be cheap too.
904429643347795968 2017-09-03 19:43:25 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding @sarahdespres Good information.  Now, if we just didn't import folks from 3rd world countries with diseases that we have previous eradicated here.
904336897203372033 2017-09-03 13:34:52 UTC <EmStorn> @senorrinhatch @Linksman102 As soon as California secedes from the union (go ahead) your map outlook gets much worse as well.  How about the map for food production?
904336355873968129 2017-09-03 13:32:43 UTC <EmStorn> @senorrinhatch How long have you been "working" on immigration in the Congress?  Why in the flying f*ck would anyone believe anything you say?
904336194326192129 2017-09-03 13:32:05 UTC <EmStorn> @senorrinhatch @realKellvis @QtheRaven Someone needs to go back to school a bit.  For the record, the anchor baby aspect of illegal citizenship would likely fail a legal test too.
904043869871976448 2017-09-02 18:10:29 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding And where was the action during the last 8 years while opioid deaths were skyrocketing?  I am sure you were calling for it then as well?
902123041181884417 2017-08-28 10:57:48 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding @TheBudgetGuy Good.  Fund the government sustainably and we don't have any problems.  This might only be impactful if people didn't paid for back time.
902120857941749760 2017-08-28 10:49:07 UTC <EmStorn> @tommiesunshine @Mikel_Jollett @BradleyRBloom Seriously.  A flood.  Its like this has never happened before.

900311860754427908 2017-08-23 11:00:49 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding Sounds like a plan.  The government has been shut down countless times for what many consider to be smaller policy differences of opinion.

900187329436016640 2017-08-22 02:45:58 UTC <EmStorn> @healthfunding Possibly true.  I don't see any leading democratic females that aren't either treating their bases as idiots or recycling worthless ideas.
