967587668182872065 2018-02-24 02:30:51 UTC <LewisC919> @rsshootinggirl @helms83 AR-15 style weapons are available in Cali and NY despite "bans." Just like they'd be under the proposed federal ban.
967582727607382016 2018-02-24 02:11:13 UTC <LewisC919> @rsshootinggirl @helms83 For now, it's moot. Feinstein's 2013 "ban" only received 40 votes in a 55 D Senate. Needed 60. That number isn't likely to change any time soon.
967580776480083969 2018-02-24 02:03:28 UTC <LewisC919> @JoMadLong The Senate voted on a "ban" in 2013. 40 votes in a 55 D Senate. Kinda telling.

967523977487896578 2018-02-24 22:17:46 UTC <LewisC919> @helms83 States register vehicles. If the states want to do so w/other items, fine. I'm more libertarian. Most details should be left to the states.
967516890062114817 2018-02-24 21:49:36 UTC <LewisC919> @helms83 History of national gun registries is not good.  I don't think buybacks and ban-confiscation regimes would go over well here. That 96% number sticks out. What are you going to do to them? Arrest millions? Violent confrontations? Lets not go there.
967515534316261382 2018-02-24 21:44:13 UTC <LewisC919> @helms83 Stuff like this is good. Tightening up the existing system.http://hill.cm/xOlX4m2
967511607948529664 2018-02-24 21:28:37 UTC <LewisC919> @helms83 Cali tried to retroactively ban high capacity magazines. It's currently stayed by federal court. Ex post facto bans are legally complicated.
967510806211547140 2018-02-24 21:25:26 UTC <LewisC919> @helms83 Having a federal gun registry is illegal. I don't think we want to go down the road of messing with existing circulation. Not if the goal of any action is to prevent bloodshed. That's gonna get gnarly real quick.
967509601494163457 2018-02-24 21:20:39 UTC <LewisC919> @helms83 Due process is a bitch sometimes. Esp when it comes to preemptive action. Think a lot of times a generic threat isn't enough. Maybe there's someway to classify a school like a person as far as threats go.
967508242963353600 2018-02-24 21:15:15 UTC <LewisC919> @helms83 I mean the 99.9% are doing something or another with them. Lol. But nothing untoward apparently. Regardless, tt's a genie back in bottle situation now. 96% noncompliance in NY. Refuse to even register. They're here to stay.https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2016/07/07/massive-noncompliance-with-safe-act/
967504393410109440 2018-02-24 20:59:57 UTC <LewisC919> @helms83 I think strengthening the background check system and ramping up prosecutions for failures is the best place to start. Add categories for prohibited buyers. Hardening schools would be good too. External and stairwell doors should electronically lock in a lockdown.
967504254167642112 2018-02-24 20:59:24 UTC <LewisC919> @helms83 As to the  "bans" themselves, Cali has one. Yet the San Bernardino shooters bought a Cali legal AR-15 style rifle. Hint: there's no ban in the bans. Only about features. That's just pointless.pic.twitter.com/0Yf7ckRkjz
967504064857694209 2018-02-24 20:58:39 UTC <LewisC919> @helms83 There are 5 to 10 million "assault weapons" in circulation. 0.00001% - 0.00002% were used illicitly that day. Any other day it's zero. That's a lot of responsible owners. I don't think restricting the masses for such a statistically insignificant number is appropriate.
967495779442216960 2018-02-24 20:25:43 UTC <LewisC919> So the "kids" are getting restless and unruly? Kinda like Jurassic Park. Trying to harness the power of the untamed is never wise. The wild (wokeness) always comes out in them. 
967439369178107904 2018-02-24 16:41:34 UTC <LewisC919> @helms83 That's people rightly denied a purchase but who possibly committed a crime applying. Knowing you're prohibited and attempting to purchase is a crime in and of itself.
967437779339808768 2018-02-24 16:35:15 UTC <LewisC919> @helms83 44 federal prosecutions of 80k failed background checks in 2010. Government doesn't need new laws when they're too lazy or incompetent to follow existing.

964954759798157312 2018-02-17 20:08:37 UTC <LewisC919> @AppFlyer I think you're wrong about the numbers. 96% noncompliance in Blue NY. Refuse to even register! Upstate Sheriffs happily ignore it, too.  https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2016/07/07/massive-noncompliance-with-safe-act/

964953103568199680 2018-02-17 20:02:02 UTC <LewisC919> @AppFlyer Cali's retroactive magazine ban is stayed by the federal courts. Ex post facto bans are complicated. Maybe unconstitutional.

955269485522575360 2018-01-21 02:42:48 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking Apologies but these poses seem sooo weird to me. They're babies, not Gumby being repositioned for the next frame!

955219642410258434 2018-01-21 23:24:44 UTC <LewisC919> @PhillipRedacted Same with mental state. OMG, he's nuts because he seems confused or forgot something! He's old. My grandparents couldn't keep our names straight younger than that. I was "hey you."  Two of mine were dead just few years older than him.
955218809287331843 2018-01-21 23:21:25 UTC <LewisC919> @PhillipRedacted I think it's more he's just an old grouchy grandpa. 70s doesn't look like it did when I was a kid but the mood/temperament is still there.
955217016914432003 2018-01-21 23:14:18 UTC <LewisC919> @PhillipRedacted That's what Ivana said. Not r word just says silly things.

951327672277389317 2018-01-10 05:39:26 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus Typo. Just Parson. The Lt Gov. Looks like a 12 year Sheriff.
951326843696766978 2018-01-10 05:36:08 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus you like Parsons? Lol.
951292185185542144 2018-01-10 03:18:25 UTC <LewisC919> @ski2point0 Not just classjc left-right stuff either. Priorities/way of life between Wake and mine are incompatible. Mix it up too much and someone/something isn't going to get the attention it deserves. Just a mess.
951290886897504256 2018-01-10 03:13:16 UTC <LewisC919> @ski2point0 Don't know how you fix NC. 100 counties and most the Ds are in like a dozen of them. It's self imposed.

949029026261237760 2018-01-04 21:25:26 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking Don't even care about the merits. Needs to be a legislative fix. Too much executive action and discretion... Put the b0ng down and go to work electing 218/60 yes votes and a POTUS who will sign.

947192583264055296 2017-12-30 19:48:04 UTC <LewisC919> @AppFlyer Haven't made any in forever. No recipe. Beef and onions and then add cans of tomatoe sauce, chopped tomatoes, and beans until full. That's probably not chili proper, tho.
947191204097163265 2017-12-30 19:42:35 UTC <LewisC919> @AppFlyer well that's a mouthful.

946218206880026624 2017-12-27 03:16:15 UTC <LewisC919> @AppFlyer I think a lot of checks are gonna be returned to sender. Bills issued in Sept and are late in Jan here. You can't just give them the money 9 months early. Have to make some arrangement. I think.

944687699939782657 2017-12-23 21:54:33 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking when I was a kid, went to a neighbor's election party. School board and we wanted her to win. Folks there were wanting Gantt to win in the Senate race. "I thought we wanted Jesse..." Hand over Lewis' mouth. 
944623073659146243 2017-12-23 17:37:45 UTC <LewisC919> @p4lm2 Sorry for your loss.
944606790167252994 2017-12-23 16:33:03 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking I didn't say it was permanent but the Freedom Caucus going along with anything, esp a continuing resolution, is borderline unprecedented. They usually sink something and Ds get concessions for votes.
944605225414950912 2017-12-23 16:26:50 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking The Tax Bill and Continuing Resolution. Unity and kumbaya among the usually warring GOP factions has the left going off the rails nuts. Ya know millions died yesterday, right? Lol.

944247153509183488 2017-12-22 16:43:59 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica That continuing resolution suspended automatic paygo cuts. None for a while unless they enact something separate.
944238461099364352 2017-12-22 16:09:26 UTC <LewisC919> @jrsalzman Same. Those items are my Xmas present to myself nowadays.

943955762665213952 2017-12-21 21:26:06 UTC <LewisC919> One lone Senator (FR Committee Chairman Helms) was able to hold the UN hostage in the 90s. Irking an administration and multiple lawmakers seems like a tactically foolish move. Especially on something nonbinding.

941621607264673792 2017-12-15 10:51:00 UTC <LewisC919> @Snakeeater36 @goatactual01 Don't ask me. I've only seen YouTube bits and pieces of the prequels. 2/3 of the original trilogy predate my existence.  We were a Star Trek family. Grandma even had ornaments.
941581821522915329 2017-12-15 08:12:54 UTC <LewisC919> @Snakeeater36 not the only one reporting that.

940979319752577026 2017-12-13 16:18:47 UTC <LewisC919> @MrGreenGenez Thundercats, Hoooo!
940962484046921728 2017-12-13 15:11:53 UTC <LewisC919> @AppFlyer If he's the gun guy he claims, it's possible. How many folks do you know who are pro-gun and aren't at least moderate on other issues? Schumer may have just picked himself up a Flake/Collins/McCain pain in the ass.
940960539194339328 2017-12-13 15:04:09 UTC <LewisC919> @AppFlyer Yep. Rs let him lose.
940867959886614528 2017-12-13 08:56:16 UTC <LewisC919> @SchmittNYC An R finished Teddy Kennedy's term. Don't think there's such a thing as un-losable. Especially special elections.
940812241926017024 2017-12-12 05:14:52 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox Agree. Issue positions are kinda lumped together. How many 'Second Amendment guys' are hardcore left on other issues? He's a wild card.
940800636874092545 2017-12-12 04:28:45 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry @scrivenlking Eh. Pelosi/Schumer/D agenda continue to be radioactive in rural America. Should be just as much a story as the pedo stuff. McCaskill whipped Akin in '12. This should have been like that. What happened?
940798742940278787 2017-12-12 04:21:14 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry @scrivenlking Win is a win but the dude was only 2% more popular than a creepy pedo. Not something to brag about. 
940790884748136448 2017-12-12 03:50:00 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking No, "they" weren't. RNC is not an independent entity. Trump was fine w/Moore. I'm hair splitting now. Lol. National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee pulled support permanently.
940789654617456640 2017-12-12 03:45:07 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking That's some wriggling through the swamp hair splitting. I get it. They know there's a no path to a majority without guns. Should own the lack of principles, tho.
940788077307580418 2017-12-12 03:38:51 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking "I will not campaign for, vote for or support any candidate, even in my own party, who does not support common-sense gun reform," Obama wrote in aNew York Times op-ed.
940785686189432833 2017-12-12 03:29:21 UTC <LewisC919> I think a lot of "hicks" are owed credit and apology, too. Disgusted and staying home was just as much a D vote. Now team blue gets to deal w/a vehemently pro 2a D. Ya know, the type Obama said he'd never support after Sandy Hook.

932843803769176064 2017-11-20 05:31:08 UTC <LewisC919> Something else broken. Just drop a house on me and be done with it.
932779876909830145 2017-11-20 01:17:07 UTC <LewisC919> @ScottCartledge Baste. Even if it says self basting. Like to smear the whole thing in butter and add chicken broth to the pan. Basting w/the mix makes awesome color and taste.

929878983570853888 2017-11-12 01:10:00 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking Did you see that report today about the D? He ran some kind of AD quasi praising the Confederate Army. Really gonna help with city turnout.
929877776429080576 2017-11-12 01:05:12 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking D says repudiates Pelosi/Schumer agenda and NO to anything Feinstein/firearm related and he prob runs away with it. Doubtful.

929167837163393025 2017-11-10 02:04:10 UTC <LewisC919> @JimLaPorta That would be a social media gold mine by savage standards. Hard to imagine pictures or video not already released.
929159011668131841 2017-11-10 01:29:05 UTC <LewisC919> @SOFFru1 @Novamoose For the voters who will pull some "turn the other cheek/a vote for maj leader Schumer is worse" somersault. I think he should've went to jail as would've happened if reported back in '79.

929138372601372672 2017-11-10 00:07:05 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking Maybe. I see a never-Trump Hillary dynamic forming. There's no other race? Some Rs stay home. Not gonna switch teams. Moore's numbers drop but Ds stays stagnant.
929137685171785728 2017-11-10 00:04:21 UTC <LewisC919> @SOFFru1 @Novamoose Great-grandmother was thrice a mother & dead at 20 about 43 years before the '79 incident. 1936, not 110 years. Atrocious behaviour isn't that far removed.
929133076738961409 2017-11-10 23:46:02 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking When he squeaks by and they have to seat him... yikes. Caucus lunches are gonna be awkward. Lol.
929116186792615936 2017-11-10 22:38:55 UTC <LewisC919> @SOFFru1 I bet a never-Trump/Hillary dynamic forms. Moore's poll numbers fall to the upper 40s and the Ds' numbers are stagnant. Still wins just with less support. Turned off supporters just won't vote. Doubt they switch.
929110440050872320 2017-11-10 22:16:05 UTC <LewisC919> @SOFFru1 Didn't say otherwise. Just not sure how it'll go over. There's not okay and then there's Chuck Schumer. Hyper partisanship seems to overrule much these days.
929106300000260096 2017-11-10 21:59:38 UTC <LewisC919> @SOFFru1 it's the south. My great-grandmother was married, had 3 kids, and dead by 20. Dunno what the masses will think. Prob all have family with similar situations.
928782462263746560 2017-11-09 00:32:49 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus If telling the story was all they wanted, then they're good. If they wanted to take him down, wait till seated or next primary. Easier to force a withdrawal or resignation.
928780685858541569 2017-11-09 00:25:46 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus Tactical error by both the victims and WP. Should have been primary fodder.
928779972726140928 2017-11-09 00:22:56 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus I bet he squeaks it out. "Schumer is worse."
928776497661431809 2017-11-09 00:09:07 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus I bet he squeaks by. Not necessarily a good commentary but a vote for Schumer as leader will sell worse.
928759369243783170 2017-11-09 23:01:03 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus Taking such a proactive role in the primary damaged them. Should have thought Akin and waited for something. Just my 2.
928740423719374853 2017-11-09 21:45:46 UTC <LewisC919> @fitnessnbeerhq ouch. What happened?
928681687608889344 2017-11-09 17:52:23 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J my bad. Lol. But seriously, yikes.
928598125559865344 2017-11-09 12:20:20 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J What difference does it make? If you add in the unfunded liabilities of SS and Medicare, it's more like $100T. Already insurmountable.
928547380114415617 2017-11-09 08:58:41 UTC <LewisC919> @goatactual1 
928430901960368129 2017-11-08 01:15:51 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J done.
928337341751746562 2017-11-08 19:04:04 UTC <LewisC919> Why do I even try? 
928097325033099264 2017-11-07 03:10:20 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill Gotcha. Extremes of both sides growing. W killed mod Rs & Obama killed blue-dogs. Don't think they're coming back.

928074453778599936 2017-11-07 01:39:27 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica Just 5 more seats needed. 12 more in play GOP held to call.
928073618193608704 2017-11-07 01:36:08 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica True. I guess it depends on the type of R and where the district is.
928073245823328256 2017-11-07 01:34:39 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica The upper house of the VA legislature isn't up until 2019. SLIM 2 seat GOP majority in place until then.
928067474821664775 2017-11-07 01:11:43 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica Wish the despondent red county folks would move one state south.

928038115989774340 2017-11-07 23:15:03 UTC <LewisC919> @redcarolina In your area? Not a good sign for G.
927990104500600833 2017-11-07 20:04:16 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht Eh. I didn't mean conditions. Incl letting families make the call with some kind of review.
927989223667445761 2017-11-07 20:00:46 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht I got called a meanie for saying bring back asylums.
927973301934350338 2017-11-07 18:57:30 UTC <LewisC919> @DaveMBP Think all in the hope for a less the 270 Electoral College result. Close vote and him having Utah denies either 270. Not politics.

927556809191280641 2017-11-06 15:22:31 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking Not doubting. Either store didn't run the check or he didn't get put in the system? Seems only options left.
927555556977577984 2017-11-06 15:17:32 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking Or maybe the window to run the full check expired and they proceeded w/the sale.
927555230325248001 2017-11-06 15:16:14 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking Dunno. Sounds like there is some lost in translation mil-civ thing with the B/G check system in this case. Offense itself and jail term.

927553521397968896 2017-11-06 15:09:27 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking I'm confused. So the store he purchased from messed up?
927380972437467136 2017-11-05 03:43:48 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica What? No clue why but that dude has blocked me. No interaction.

927334076587143173 2017-11-05 00:37:27 UTC <LewisC919> @GolfSchott 185,345 background checks ran on black Friday 2015. One day. Not even talking about 2A. General law on any subject. It's not possible.
927332464363823104 2017-11-05 00:31:03 UTC <LewisC919> @GolfSchott No. The current b/g check system passes muster because it's relatively instant and not overly burdensome. It would have to be quick.
927330886256873473 2017-11-05 00:24:46 UTC <LewisC919> @GolfSchott Courts would. You can't mandate something impossible to get. The wait would be years. Govt would prob have to pay for the exams, too.
927329832823939072 2017-11-05 00:20:35 UTC <LewisC919> @GolfSchott So, you meant going forward or current owners, too. I don't think either is feasible. Not enough Drs/infrastructure. Especially if annual.
927325303629844480 2017-11-05 00:02:35 UTC <LewisC919> @GolfSchott 80,000,000+ appointments needed the day it takes effect. Most psychiatrists have multi-month waits for the reg folk they see.
926929966335516672 2017-11-04 21:51:40 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J Was the missile from Yemen or some internal coup attempt?
926682927735468032 2017-11-03 05:30:01 UTC <LewisC919> Few years back, one jumped into door hinge area of my car. Also ran away laughing. I spent a week crawling in & out of the passenger door.

926628164729823233 2017-11-03 01:52:25 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking I missed. What memo?
926627852711354369 2017-11-03 01:51:10 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry @sgoodl @natehanco He's gonna go back to the feral cat rescue. Standing job offer. Fuckers can be mean. His "torture" ain't done. 
926627337323589633 2017-11-03 01:49:07 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking I'm waiting for the return fire. Longer they wait... She's gonna end up some "pizza gate" shit. 
926626550589612032 2017-11-03 01:46:00 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking did they respond?
926603640588169218 2017-11-03 00:14:58 UTC <LewisC919> @JGarrettNHBB haha. Nice.
926599618003075073 2017-11-03 23:58:58 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry even the ones who testified? Defense had access to all reports and whatnot. Argued against them testifying for other reasons.
926528682230984704 2017-11-03 19:17:06 UTC <LewisC919> @Bad_Firefighter True and .
926520645432770561 2017-11-03 18:45:10 UTC <LewisC919> @JimLaPorta The comments. Even from active persons. "What am I supposed to tell my..." Blaming T for him walking done less damage? What do I know, tho.
926519951904657408 2017-11-03 18:42:25 UTC <LewisC919> @JimLaPorta Outsider looking in but I'm seeing a somewhat jarring amount of hurt and anger. Last person I'd expect to comment even did. Sad episode.
926519487330955264 2017-11-03 18:40:34 UTC <LewisC919> @JimLaPorta Maybe been better if thrown out due to comments. Something tangible to blame. Members lost faith in the military now?
926514151068979200 2017-11-03 18:19:22 UTC <LewisC919> What the heck? Haha.
926503076793606144 2017-11-03 17:35:21 UTC <LewisC919> @natehanco Don't think we'd even be here but for the prior administration's grandstanding and deliberately deceptive comments about him.
926279938604445696 2017-11-02 02:48:41 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking some poor programmer is gonna up all night writing code to internally protect high profile accts.
926158949325385733 2017-11-02 18:47:55 UTC <LewisC919> @natehanco They took a page from the NCGOP playbook here.
926075958871904257 2017-11-02 13:18:08 UTC <LewisC919> @stillglomar that doesn't look like Webster's dad to me. Fake! 
925847156493340675 2017-11-01 22:08:58 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking the tweet itself? Deleted.
925845008254750720 2017-11-01 22:00:25 UTC <LewisC919> @jonathankappler I'm confused. How can they be doing this without officially declaring them unlawful? Weird.
925778848914067457 2017-11-01 17:37:32 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J Obamacare ruling... tax it to death.
925777419205832705 2017-11-01 17:31:51 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica Obamacare ruling basically says the power to tax is unlimited. If going there, just tax the shit out of it.
925630995793104896 2017-11-01 07:50:01 UTC <LewisC919> November is gonna suck just like October. 45+ days of disappointment at the mailbox and counting.

922942138006032385 2017-10-24 21:45:27 UTC <LewisC919> @JimLaPorta like I said before, it's too vague. Pelosi's chop licking slippery slope comment was prob the kill shot, though.
922940943556317185 2017-10-24 21:40:43 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry that would be good right about now. In search of food. Lol.

917115478287544320 2017-10-08 19:52:23 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking Exactly. Have to go into 30+ pro firearm states, run on it, and win. They're not, tho. Ds are recruiting pro gun folks there.

916820847314264065 2017-10-07 00:21:38 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking search every room with venue view prior to events? Too daunting?
916806536290283522 2017-10-07 23:24:46 UTC <LewisC919> So some knew to get out before the rapid fire?

916066523466301442 2017-10-05 22:24:13 UTC <LewisC919> Dunno about that one. That was part of DiFi's amendment, right? 60 nays. Many of the 14 nay Ds have been voted out, too.
916060855254568960 2017-10-05 22:01:42 UTC <LewisC919> @natehanco Had the shits the other day. No coincidence the littlest nephew had them just prior. Fuckers are little biological weapons factories.

916024090837872641 2017-10-05 19:35:36 UTC <LewisC919> @ski2point0 @WickedSmaaaht Yes it does. That last section... Adding reciprocity to any bill will sink it. But that'll be on Ds. Posturing...
916023303449468928 2017-10-05 19:32:29 UTC <LewisC919> @NRA @PaulSzoldra Yeah, but that ending section. Suggestion of adding reciprocity to any new regs. That'll sink it in the Senate. Like UBC.
916022512697430016 2017-10-05 19:29:20 UTC <LewisC919> @CrispinBurke but did you read the last line? If reciprocity is added, Ds will balk.
916015875718828033 2017-10-05 19:02:58 UTC <LewisC919> @DaveMBP for a concession, okay. No freebies.

915830266756657152 2017-10-04 06:45:25 UTC <LewisC919> Wait. Murphy will get greedy and blow it to hell.
915827501112360961 2017-10-04 06:34:26 UTC <LewisC919> But I'm not sure that possession ban provision will pass court muster. Cali's ex post facto magazine ban was stayed.
915824549027045376 2017-10-04 06:22:42 UTC <LewisC919> My guess is that reciprocity will get amended in one or both bodies. The prospect of that sunk UBC in the Senate, tho.
915823839736745984 2017-10-04 06:19:53 UTC <LewisC919> No, that's what I mean. Team Blue has to give up something.
915823003996508160 2017-10-04 06:16:33 UTC <LewisC919> Not for free. Extract something from the other side. If it doesn't hurt, they'll want more when more events occur.

915038715319341056 2017-10-02 02:20:04 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry @jstogdill If his firearms were legal (unclear), ~0.0002% of NFA items were misused last night. "Damn the other ~499,999 and their owners!" Wut?!
915036227858042881 2017-10-02 02:10:11 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry @jstogdill That's true. But they lose 1k+ seats in the next 4 elections when they try that stuff. 
915035021643337728 2017-10-02 02:05:24 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry @jstogdill my bad. Meant that for the 9:51 tweet. Not the NRA. 80,000,000 firearm owners are just concentrated in maj of states.

914989269353103362 2017-10-02 23:03:36 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill Team Blue is on track for a repeat of 06 & 08. No path to winning a maj without pro 2a candidates. "Yay 2a!" Pathetic and hypocritical.
914986971092701184 2017-10-02 22:54:28 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill Is team Blue gonna put its electoral fortunes with its mouths? No support for pro 2a candidates. If not, are they any better?
914965325749342208 2017-10-02 21:28:27 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica Should put their electoral fortunes where their mouths are. Recruitment time. Pro gun candidates get NO party support.
914957868662697987 2017-10-02 20:58:49 UTC <LewisC919> @thedesertape In the sense it kept a lot of Never 45 folks from pulling the lever for her. I think that's what tipped it.
914957486700089346 2017-10-02 20:57:18 UTC <LewisC919> @thedesertape Stopped you know who from making it to the White House. Not Russia or Comey. Just threat of a SCOTUS shift. So, it kinda did.
914920237400813569 2017-10-02 18:29:17 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill I mean, they're doing just what the GOP House and Senate Campaign Committee are hoping for. Stringing up their own noose.
914901788930838528 2017-10-02 17:15:59 UTC <LewisC919> @JoMadLong Feinstein's so called assault weapons ban received 40 votes in a 55 D Senate back in '13. That debate is DOA. Pun intended.

913650303903379456 2017-09-28 06:23:01 UTC <LewisC919> @RRISC01 Signed up. Looks doable but I'm worried they'll drive in and then leave the area. Return time would be 2 hours later.
913646800971722752 2017-09-28 06:09:06 UTC <LewisC919> @RRISC01 Thanks! I'll look into that. Hope being rural doesn't work against us.
913633261372317696 2017-09-28 05:15:18 UTC <LewisC919> @sean_spoonts Chicks who like to have teas and bake cookies strike back. Mystery solved. 
913632913882787840 2017-09-28 05:13:55 UTC <LewisC919> @RRISC01 Can you specifically request drivers w/modified vehicles? Van with lift or ramp required.
913631600650473473 2017-09-28 05:08:42 UTC <LewisC919> Can get wheelchair transport to Chapel Hill. 70 miles and 4 counties away. Not 9 miles away. 4 miles into the next county is tricky? FML.
913562821056765952 2017-09-28 00:35:24 UTC <LewisC919> @DanLamothe Yeah. Hils and other's commentary doesn't jive w/the Governor and Congressional Delegate's public sentiments. Really weird, esp the Gov.
913560680208486401 2017-09-28 00:26:53 UTC <LewisC919> @DanLamothe Tracking. Are state/local politicos ranting and it's not getting through to the us? Holding back to keep the peace or self-blame? Odd.
913559209073143808 2017-09-28 00:21:03 UTC <LewisC919> @DanLamothe Territorial govt's financial woes play any role in this? Requesting/ability to receive assistance? Neglected infrastructure?

912926762056781825 2017-09-26 06:27:56 UTC <LewisC919> @ski2point0 gotta think the "state" being in financial shambles is a huge factor, too. Unprepared to even accept aid.
912918582073413634 2017-09-26 05:55:25 UTC <LewisC919> @ski2point0 Feel ya. Something is up with my sinuses. Pressure in addition to on/off fever chills/hotflashes. Not very conducive to sleeping.
912917758811213824 2017-09-26 05:52:09 UTC <LewisC919> @ski2point0 you okay?
912857949323845632 2017-09-26 01:54:29 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry good deal.
912796141623836672 2017-09-26 21:48:53 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht 80?! Geezus. Think that's pretty much impossible in NC. Just 30 requires some hoop jumping.
912482490438361088 2017-09-25 01:02:33 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus Audible boos. He got what he wanted. Culture war...
912197018826805248 2017-09-24 06:08:11 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht couldn't happen to a more deserving person. Haha.

912098781704933378 2017-09-24 23:37:50 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus Now, I think it's self publicizing/grandstanding. Pointless. Players should be at city police recruitment events encouraging AA to sign up.
912097980685127680 2017-09-24 23:34:39 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus I think everyone is in the right here. Kneeling, NFL being wary of it, & fans tanking the NFL. All parties exercising speech/expression.

911661231144087552 2017-09-23 18:39:10 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus better than foreign affairs. Bet State and DOD are having a nice leisurely weekend.

909543071502815238 2017-09-17 22:22:21 UTC <LewisC919> @KMat21 Groundwork laid for shitstorm on Fri. Should've let out before the heat of the day. If not fixed and don't tomorrow, will stir the pot.

909285790416486400 2017-09-16 05:20:00 UTC <LewisC919> @natehanco Other dude plead out. Rightly so due to toxicology reports. All the faux outrage.

908157453581381633 2017-09-13 02:36:24 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox I dunno. 23 no Rs and Ryan will have to break it. I just see this ending with him getting a vacate the chair motion.
908155908575948801 2017-09-13 02:30:15 UTC <LewisC919> @stillglomar Only tool available is a vacate the chair motion in the House. Freedom caucus alone could sustain.
908155078254743553 2017-09-13 02:26:58 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox I'm not really arguing merits. Ryan secured his speakership on a Hastert rule for any immigration bill pledge. Reiterated last week.
908154005871906817 2017-09-13 02:22:42 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox A lot of no votes on his last deal with Ds. Wouldn't think this would be any different.

908152991320076288 2017-09-13 02:18:40 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox Ryan re-pledged his no immigration bills without maj of the maj support last week. Doubtful T can bring that many on board?

907722887846612997 2017-09-12 21:49:35 UTC <LewisC919> @Arrowheadbroken But I'm not doing any of the stuff the aunt went through regardless. So no point in finding out. As Doris sang, Que Sera Sera.

906966154735996928 2017-09-10 19:42:36 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking I don't think they die for lack of warning or being meh. People have free will. A lot of the time, we make bad calls.
906965336909651968 2017-09-10 19:39:21 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking Irma looks to be a no show here. Now that'll be fresh in our minds and we'll be meh at the next one. How hurricane states are.
906965056092561408 2017-09-10 19:38:14 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking I'm in E NC. It's a cycle man.  Matthew was meh and folks were blindsided. That fear made us go apeshit at Irma maybe coming.
906770881061556225 2017-09-09 06:46:39 UTC <LewisC919> something historians will be trying to decipher for ages. Lol.

905913569665048578 2017-09-07 22:00:00 UTC <LewisC919> 40 miles of driving for a "needs prior authorization." Already took a week of haggling to get it. I am tired.
905723196095258624 2017-09-07 09:23:32 UTC <LewisC919> @TomFlowers Only 70 miles inland here in NC. Been there done that. Lol. I always pay attention.

901495511735189504 2017-08-26 17:24:13 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking Just guessing here. I think age and jury issues will be prohibitive for state. No one likes to lose. Or win and they croak the next day. 
901487965796478976 2017-08-26 16:54:14 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking Can't deny him a jury trial on criminal charges like they did for contempt. Only reason they got him? Think political loss is the max here.

893618488228667392 2017-08-04 23:43:44 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill Trying to be funny. It'd take away what they've so masterfully weaponized. Prob slow the sale of firearms.
893617469000228864 2017-08-04 23:39:41 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill "Disarm" them. Lol. Embrace Heller/McDonald, PLCAA, reciprocity, and the rest of 2A. I think it would actually be far more effective.
893616073668517888 2017-08-04 23:34:09 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill My bad. Leftie military Twitter, Watts, and so on are aghast and going to town. As intended.

892243223636303872 2017-07-31 04:38:56 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill Wasn't Russia. I think Scalia's fault. His untimely demise scared all those Rs who were supposed to vote for her. Left blank/held nose.
892241949448654849 2017-07-31 04:33:52 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill Seems the problem is still Hillary. How the hell can you have buyer's remorse when she'd be the remedy? Lol. Her negatives prop him up.
892239439598145536 2017-07-31 04:23:54 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill And that Senate map is horrific. Holding 48 may be the best case scenario for Ds.
892238808514793473 2017-07-31 04:21:23 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill I don't know if it'll even work this time. It's too soon. The Ds conned them with moderates in 06/08. You saw the specials. Trump > Pelosi.
892233441835667458 2017-07-31 04:00:04 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill This was nothing. Wait for the blowback when they say they need pro firearm candidates.  And they do. Lots of them.
892209326487728129 2017-07-31 02:24:14 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica Funny spin there. Original order was for elections like right now. Now, reg elections next year. Not exactly a death blow.

891307150613544960 2017-07-29 14:39:19 UTC <LewisC919> @AppFlyer @RodBoydILM Was my thought, too.
891306822564536320 2017-07-29 14:38:00 UTC <LewisC919> @CrispinBurke I'd go in and ask without the pants. Or call.

888888167398608898 2017-07-22 22:27:08 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill I don't like where they flow anyway. Overflow with a hose like that could fix. Double benefit. Do they handle the overflow well?
888887104671035394 2017-07-22 22:22:55 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill Gotcha. Have 9 downspouts and have thought about. They'd gave to be cut, though.
888886348597407745 2017-07-22 22:19:54 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill How does the hose work?
888829606744215552 2017-07-22 18:34:26 UTC <LewisC919> @WillReinier To be fair, Hils and Barry were kinda rough on each other back in the day, too. Steadfastness and politics don't go together.
888828778268545024 2017-07-22 18:31:09 UTC <LewisC919> @Fr8_Dog Thanks man. Concern means a lot.
888824447616122882 2017-07-22 18:13:56 UTC <LewisC919> @Snakeeater36 because his "old" lady can fund this with what she finds in her couch cushions.

888610497100226560 2017-07-21 04:03:46 UTC <LewisC919> @natehanco I'm not desperate. Just a lot of bad stuff going on. Waiting for the next bad thing. Thanks for asking.
888599873913749506 2017-07-21 03:21:33 UTC <LewisC919> Not sure how things could get much worse. I'm sure I'll be shocked to see how they can.

888479233634443265 2017-07-21 19:22:11 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus he can probably halt any federal prosecution, though. No charging until a new POTUS green lights.
888437531196444675 2017-07-21 16:36:28 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill They fool @th3v0t4ry sometimes, too.

887666056071917569 2017-07-19 13:30:54 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J Well that's interesting. Gonna put the UK in the position of holding US residents against their will if they don't release.
887607353520140288 2017-07-19 09:37:38 UTC <LewisC919> @jab2375 good morning.

887390651763101696 2017-07-18 19:16:32 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica @AppFlyer So, you're saying the IRS will issue guidance/forms not taking it in for year 2017?
887389839435460609 2017-07-18 19:13:19 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica @AppFlyer Said to ease enforcement. Not sure what that means but I know someone who didn't get their fine refunded. No coverage, still have to pay.
887360846145388544 2017-07-18 17:18:06 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica DJT could do that with executive amnesty for the mandate. Cancellations would collapse the system yesterday.

887295741198290944 2017-07-18 12:59:24 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus T should just issue executive amnesty for the mandate. Things will get interesting without technically repealing.

885958823575511041 2017-07-14 20:26:58 UTC <LewisC919> @JimLaPorta I meant Delegate or Representative. What's the official title? I thought the former.
885958302332588032 2017-07-14 20:24:54 UTC <LewisC919> @JimLaPorta Del. or Rep.? See she uses the latter. CSPAN hasn't when I've seen the DC Delegate speak in the past.

884631998865842177 2017-07-10 04:34:38 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus It seems like "so what" is the the end game. Find out the worst and, so long as they said so what, nothing to charge them with.

884512984873275393 2017-07-10 20:41:43 UTC <LewisC919> @smittie61984 Fair enough. I think everyone who's all "cause he's black" are missing the point. They don't want to go near unsympathetic characters.

838639344319610880 2017-03-05 06:36:15 UTC <LewisC919> @natehanco There were other factors. But SCOTUS weakening 1a (allowing hate speech ban, etc) and 2a were on my mind. @th3v0t4ry
838635904835141633 2017-03-05 06:22:35 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry Hils not appointing to SCOTUS was my only criteria. Him having everyone's knickers in a bunch is gravy. Good gravy! @natehanco

838563811917447168 2017-03-05 01:36:07 UTC <LewisC919> @polar_mcbear From an equality standpoint, why is it okay to fabricate your gender but not to hear voices or see things?
838563724935979008 2017-03-05 01:35:46 UTC <LewisC919> @polar_mcbear Aren't there people in the asylum or forcibly medicated with delusions less disjointed from reality?

836810896932548610 2017-02-28 05:30:39 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill I don't think a lady who exhibited that kind of strength 7 days after burying her husband allows herself to be used.

834954820251451395 2017-02-23 02:35:16 UTC <LewisC919> @MrGreenGenez I think you'd get more with a tiered capital gain rate. Currently Gates/Buffet pay the same as grandmas.
834953463826104320 2017-02-23 02:29:53 UTC <LewisC919> @MrGreenGenez billions every year, they'd eventually lose controlling interest.
834953410118107136 2017-02-23 02:29:40 UTC <LewisC919> @MrGreenGenez You'd be taking their companies from them. Stock isn't currently taxable unless you sell it. If Gates/Buffet had to fork over
834952017118433280 2017-02-23 02:24:08 UTC <LewisC919> @MrGreenGenez .125 b. Holdings would be wiped out eventually.
834951913980452864 2017-02-23 02:23:43 UTC <LewisC919> @MrGreenGenez Big bucks the first few years but there'd be nothing left after. Billion gets whacked to .5 billion. Next year, to .25 b. Then
834950671841517569 2017-02-23 02:18:47 UTC <LewisC919> @MrGreenGenez Interesting. Every year or just once per magic number?
834949381971406849 2017-02-23 02:13:39 UTC <LewisC919> @MrGreenGenez I get what you're asking. You're wanting holdings taxed? Like property tax but for cash, stocks, etc?
834948684085358592 2017-02-23 02:10:53 UTC <LewisC919> @MrGreenGenez You mean a yearly tax on held assets, right? Currently only income & capital gains are taxed.
834900907364069376 2017-02-23 23:01:02 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht sorry for your loss.

834332581499908096 2017-02-22 09:22:43 UTC <LewisC919> @OConnell75thRR Talked about running telephone lines here in NC. I have some old glass insulators.
834331955948879872 2017-02-22 09:20:14 UTC <LewisC919> @OConnell75thRR Probably Germany? He talks about setting up communications for the Army there. He worked for Ma Bell after. 50s-90s.
834329861237923840 2017-02-22 09:11:54 UTC <LewisC919> @OConnell75thRR Yeah, that's him and my father. Def some resemblance for me, too. Speaking of the 50s.pic.twitter.com/2McYGerrtN

832071091979956224 2017-02-15 03:36:22 UTC <LewisC919> @GolfSchott Oh, I get that. Meant a news helo going that far out.

825552949862621184 2017-01-28 03:55:35 UTC <LewisC919> @thedesertape That's why they're so docile. They don't know what to do with that horrendous 2018 map.

825551654342766594 2017-01-28 03:50:27 UTC <LewisC919> @thedesertape He wins either way. Blocked is probably a larger win. Angry supporters are even better.

825288876298272768 2017-01-28 10:26:15 UTC <LewisC919> @ItsAJoshParty Really awful? The gap between Goldsboro and Greenville. Have to take a dump? You're screwed. 
825288489684127744 2017-01-28 10:24:43 UTC <LewisC919> @ItsAJoshParty gotcha. It's no man's land in between the cities/towns around here. Def boring.

822854860236345345 2017-01-21 17:14:21 UTC <LewisC919> Numbers are impressive. They're still all concentrated in non competitive districts/states, though. Practically speaking, doesn't mean much.
822839879142961152 2017-01-21 16:14:49 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht I'm cool with this. He's a moderating influence.

822509146767589378 2017-01-20 18:20:36 UTC <LewisC919> @PrivateSnuffy That's on my mind with the D rhetoric I'm seeing. "Geezus, y'all are gonna wake up in January 2019 to a 38 D Senate."
822506755540258819 2017-01-20 18:11:06 UTC <LewisC919> @PrivateSnuffy Not being a dick. It's accurate. pic.twitter.com/IYEV3YdOJQ
822503118139170820 2017-01-20 17:56:39 UTC <LewisC919> Think we call compliment both couples on a personal level. Everything smooth & dignified. Will wait to see if the staff behaved. 
822501278085423106 2017-01-20 17:49:20 UTC <LewisC919> @PrivateSnuffy he's a moron. 
822498881481142272 2017-01-20 17:39:49 UTC <LewisC919> That's funny. Y'all can't do the "look how many followers they lost" comparisons. Everything was transferred to the new 44 accounts.
822441062652346368 2017-01-20 13:50:04 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht not mine. Those few are getting swamped by hey, hey, hey, goodbye & similar meme.

822374758369132544 2017-01-20 09:26:36 UTC <LewisC919> @Blueberrier0341 hey.
822355041264734208 2017-01-20 08:08:15 UTC <LewisC919> As usual, I messed something up. Add some other happenings and this has been a rotten night.
822347736976605185 2017-01-19 07:39:13 UTC <LewisC919> @EricBandazewski Being taken advantage of definitely sucks. Same for taken for granted.
822317831450525696 2017-01-19 05:40:23 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Polling firms have bias. Why the article described them as Democratic-leaning. N&O refers to them as left-leaning.
822314819478917122 2017-01-19 05:28:25 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Fair enough. Poorly worded attempt at saying they suck at reading opinion in the state. Results skew left.
822307473675546630 2017-01-19 04:59:14 UTC <LewisC919> @KarenVaughn_GSM Very cool. Glad you get an upfront seat to all this.
822295536174776323 2017-01-19 04:11:47 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J Obviously put his kid's underwear on by mistake. Looks a little binding. 
822294160048877569 2017-01-19 04:06:19 UTC <LewisC919> @LFreshwater Never seen anything like that before. Just thought it was cool was all. https://youtu.be/BTMNoYK-HH8?t=1m13s
822291632842297345 2017-01-19 03:56:17 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime you just quoted a tweet that *predicts* something based on the same firm's polling. Stupid in both cases?

822277766099992577 2017-01-19 03:01:11 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime several times. Wouldn't think twice about making roadkill in that scenario.
822277665403142144 2017-01-19 03:00:47 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime You've lost me on the traffic blocking. That's a public safety matter. I've driven a loved one in distress to the hospital

819147432122548225 2017-01-11 11:42:21 UTC <LewisC919> @redactedmedic That's creepy.
819017619047063552 2017-01-10 03:06:31 UTC <LewisC919> Damn. I'm betting poor old Barry is thinking, "where the hell were all these gushing fans/tweeters in Nov 2010 & Nov 2014?!" 
818947270913720321 2017-01-10 22:26:59 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J Awesome. On my way.
818933825917042690 2017-01-10 21:33:33 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime No filibuster. You'll need 3 R & all D/I to stop him. Well, 4 R. Believe Manchin supports. Mr party pooper signing off.

818904954643611650 2017-01-10 19:38:50 UTC <LewisC919> Can still belt out a few word for word even 20 years later. Good stuff.
818904287464005633 2017-01-10 19:36:11 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J Sorry for your loss.
818889840129359872 2017-01-10 18:38:46 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Especially considering its family origins predate the Civil War.
818872433855922177 2017-01-10 17:29:36 UTC <LewisC919> @themarriedmess I assume you watch this alone. Based on his tweets, your other half would probably blow a gasket. 
818868881498505216 2017-01-10 17:15:29 UTC <LewisC919> @polar_mcbear Dawned on me in line at Sam's one day. Woops...

818844672365838336 2017-01-10 15:39:17 UTC <LewisC919> @MrJoshPerry Never mind his grandfather, and namesake, was born before the Civil War...
818844246048468993 2017-01-10 15:37:36 UTC <LewisC919> Isn't a worst dressed list bullying? Sounds like something that breeds disrespect. 
818842187748245504 2017-01-10 15:29:25 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox Yep. They're all feverishly working towards his reelection, too. MMA fighter Streep included.

818631195978321922 2017-01-09 01:31:01 UTC <LewisC919> @DanLamothe Bet she liked him then, too. They'd still be buds if he never ran. So would everyone else who currently hates home. Hypocrites.
818621929665994756 2017-01-09 00:54:11 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry looks good.

818460148683382784 2017-01-09 14:11:20 UTC <LewisC919> @kampeas Honestly, I wondered if I was reading too much into it until I just saw this. Then, "yep, what I thought she meant."pic.twitter.com/Q1DujmeUMy
818459611195969537 2017-01-09 14:09:12 UTC <LewisC919> @kampeas The football/MMA comment was the mistake. Opened it up to, "Look! She's attacking us, too."
818453477844258816 2017-01-09 13:44:49 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry going from cold to colder. Wrong direction, man.  Mornin'.

815014431155425280 2016-12-30 01:59:17 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime "We" invited it. I don't think for sec that Hils would've stopped him either. I think she would've lost regardless.
815013439097733120 2016-12-30 01:55:20 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime I dunno man. We were warned in 12 and most of the folks bitchin laughed and voted for 80s wants its foreign policy back guy.

815011670661722112 2016-12-30 01:48:19 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Torn. As much as O has excelled at trolling his opponents, it's hard not laugh at someone doing it back to him.
815010125111066624 2016-12-30 01:42:10 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime No. I just don't see the reason for the alarm. Putin gonna keep on Putin-ing regardless.
815008770841579520 2016-12-30 01:36:47 UTC <LewisC919> Say you're right. Putin has been running circles around O for years. Not sure there'd be much change. Same shit but more friendly rhetoric?

807635164067229700 2016-12-10 17:16:42 UTC <LewisC919> @polar_mcbear Obama is obnoxiously conceited. It's just trading for a different variation of annoying.

806630104319270912 2016-12-07 22:42:57 UTC <LewisC919> @thejackdog the folks saying they'll oppose Mattis' waiver because civilian leadership at DOD is impt. He's a civilian now. Same as  later.

804493380256432128 2016-12-01 01:12:23 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J empty?! That'd def get a 'that SOB' outta one of them.

804201750546747392 2016-11-30 05:53:33 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry Not lying. On either count. We became friends 140 at the time. A good thing. Also, I'll read anything.
804193592210296833 2016-11-30 05:21:08 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry You already do good things with 140 characters. Look forward to reading it man.

804062908783140875 2016-11-30 20:41:50 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Y'all focused your fire on the wrong target. Gov has no say in redistricting, so even more inconsequential.
804062795708952576 2016-11-30 20:41:23 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Even if the court order holds, they redrew the federal districts  and still maintained 10-3 R makeup. Supermajority will stay.
804060774465347584 2016-11-30 20:33:22 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime I'm sure legislature already has the override stamp gassed up. Used it on McCrory a few times. This too is inconsequential.
804057043254579201 2016-11-30 20:18:32 UTC <LewisC919> @redactedmedic I'll never get why opponents focused all their fire on the office whose flip would have the least effect.
804055711621795841 2016-11-30 20:13:14 UTC <LewisC919> @redactedmedic Legislature still rules the roost. NC governors have been powerless figureheads since 2011.
804055197345599497 2016-11-30 20:11:12 UTC <LewisC919> @th3j35t3r He could appoint another Trustee, tho. Terms of the trust could restrict that even.
804054785494253568 2016-11-30 20:09:34 UTC <LewisC919> @th3j35t3r If it's some sort of family trust, he probably can't. Kids own, he votes/operates. That'd be how I would have it set up.
803974461649207296 2016-11-30 14:50:23 UTC <LewisC919> @Blueberrier0341 that is awesome. Haha.
803875376095227905 2016-11-30 08:16:39 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime the same result. Also, possible SCOTUS strikes this down & upholds original maps with a Trump appointee.
803875249389531136 2016-11-30 08:16:09 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime I think folks are jumping the gun on this being huge. They can just request map makers only use partisan makeup and achieve
803817455500005377 2016-11-29 04:26:30 UTC <LewisC919> hi puppy.

803775138751803392 2016-11-29 01:38:21 UTC <LewisC919> Yes!
803768017670782976 2016-11-29 01:10:03 UTC <LewisC919> @jonathankappler Gov doesn't have a say in redistricting, right? Sure map makers will get the same partisan only instructions as before.
803654755180392448 2016-11-29 17:39:59 UTC <LewisC919> @AppFlyer Yeah, he was quasi begging to do it my way. I took the time time figure it out the teachers way. Made him do it.

801407734289747972 2016-11-23 12:51:07 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox Yes! Dole said he was malleable. Glad the never folks realize they're needed.

801343164300857349 2016-11-23 08:34:33 UTC <LewisC919> I thought this since deleted tweet, no regrets indeed, was odd. First interaction there. Do I have some reputation I'm not aware of? pic.twitter.com/k4Wck3ijem

801195511894024194 2016-11-22 22:47:50 UTC <LewisC919> @PaulSzoldra Dole said he was malleable. Just a matter of surrounding him with the right folks. 
801075136849911808 2016-11-22 14:49:30 UTC <LewisC919> @elvisknievil Gotcha. Transfer good thoughts to them.

800820965810675712 2016-11-21 21:59:31 UTC <LewisC919> @donachaidh It's really of no consequence. He was never in charge. Cooper won't be if he prevails. Legislature has ruled since 2013.
800818355599011840 2016-11-21 21:49:09 UTC <LewisC919> @polar_mcbear Awesome. Can also respond w/their vices. Still drinking? Cheating? Haha.

800479440778035200 2016-11-20 23:22:25 UTC <LewisC919> @GolfSchott Congressional waiver possible. Shouldn't be an issue given the next Congress' makeup.
800479170178457600 2016-11-20 23:21:21 UTC <LewisC919> @Joel5326 Little Trump U settlement talk. Like a fox... Haha.

799781625525571584 2016-11-18 01:09:33 UTC <LewisC919> @MattVierkant well said.
799744532367765505 2016-11-18 22:42:09 UTC <LewisC919> @danielmkim Told you in July you were wrong. His past statements are enough to paint him but you're spreading propaganda. I'm done.
799627859664977920 2016-11-18 14:58:32 UTC <LewisC919> @aguyfromtx full thought here. You're definitely right. Even if that were the case,  wouldn't be on him.https://twitter.com/MOlewiscarroll/status/799622998915510272
799625948446523392 2016-11-18 14:50:57 UTC <LewisC919> I'm fine with folks using his past statements. Making shit up abt him being named in honor of Davis or Beauregard? Not cool.
799622998915510272 2016-11-18 14:39:13 UTC <LewisC919> Unless you believe in time travel, it's not likely his name has any connection to any Civil War figures.https://twitter.com/MOlewiscarroll/status/799622406256009217
799622406256009217 2016-11-18 14:36:52 UTC <LewisC919> Here's a newsflash for ya. Senator Sessions was named after his father and grandfather. Latter was born in 1860.
799617759327883264 2016-11-18 14:18:24 UTC <LewisC919> @aguyfromtx Is using his full name an implication he's named after the Civil War figures? His grandfather was born in 1860... @AJentleson
799593411561062400 2016-11-18 12:41:39 UTC <LewisC919> @danielmkim It's III & you know the origins of his name predate the Civil War yet continue to imply otherwise. @matthewferner @ryanjreilly

799516226330525696 2016-11-17 07:34:57 UTC <LewisC919> @MoonWolf95 I'll admit there's some nuance but having to ask permission to hold an election? Not exactly democratic. @th3v0t4ry @1stClown

798081807761764353 2016-11-14 08:35:05 UTC <LewisC919> @mpv1123 go for it.
798054841599856640 2016-11-13 06:47:56 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry Talk like that pushed many fence sitters to vote with their white trash contemporaries.

798042382033829888 2016-11-13 05:58:25 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht Sorry about Angie man. BTW, you're an idiot. 
798042200328327168 2016-11-13 05:57:42 UTC <LewisC919> @G22A8 Know it sucks but glad you got a glimpse of that shit before marriage.
798016523445137408 2016-11-13 04:15:40 UTC <LewisC919> @JPDinnell Nice. What time should I be there? Ha.
798011750922747904 2016-11-13 03:56:42 UTC <LewisC919> @_Dan_Ryan That episode was definitely confusing. Ha.
798009214287413248 2016-11-13 03:46:37 UTC <LewisC919> @MrGreenGenez Currently. Not sure it was this noisy in there, but I'll sleep just fine.  @TroopsinContactpic.twitter.com/sljVcnUugL
798007675439169536 2016-11-13 03:40:30 UTC <LewisC919> @TroopsinContact fan. What mother used for me. I still need the sound to sleep 35 years later. Guess that's a downside. Ha.
798003718818070528 2016-11-13 03:24:47 UTC <LewisC919> Ivana on Donnie. LOL.  Glad they're won't be a gold leaf WH.pic.twitter.com/ImD5rBleXR

797950628253364224 2016-11-13 23:53:49 UTC <LewisC919> @EricBandazewski Yep. Even if he replaces Kennedy, most will adhere to stare decisis.
797942904522035200 2016-11-13 23:23:08 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry ppl don't think there are 25 GOP Reps to vote for impeachment? Or 19 GOP Sens to convict? Please, the votes are there right now.

797243167422775297 2016-11-11 01:02:37 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit temper your excitement. Reciprocity got 57 Senate votes back in 13. Needs 60. Might be tall order. @Jackie0351
797219308061462528 2016-11-11 23:27:49 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys And I don't mean that as HA HA gloating. Apologies if it comes off that way.
797218809186754560 2016-11-11 23:25:50 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys Should've been worried about when the other team would have the pen. Gridlock isn't necessarily a bad thing. Protects us.
797218579640881156 2016-11-11 23:24:55 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys For the worried folks, this is why I think we should all be terrified of Executive Action. Y'all were like President Badass!
797212769795932160 2016-11-11 23:01:50 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime I get your point, tho. Neither team is all in on the BOR.
797212510810210305 2016-11-11 23:00:48 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime HRC was Annie Oakley in 08. Who the hell knows what they're thinking. Lol. No such thing as a pro-gun liberal justice.
797211510531616768 2016-11-11 22:56:50 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime A vote for any D is a vote for anti gun leadership.
797211460908777472 2016-11-11 22:56:38 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Speaking of walls, there's a big one on the political spectrum that will always stop me from crossing over.
797210465495642113 2016-11-11 22:52:41 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime different politics but I like her.
797209914347311104 2016-11-11 22:50:29 UTC <LewisC919> @AppFlyer Prior Obama voters flipped Florida, PA, Michigan, & Wisconsin. Also, think more boring grandma than suppression. @TimTakesTime
797208224789331968 2016-11-11 22:43:46 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Interesting. Cali entrepreneur one recently posted a throwback of himself sunbathing in Iraq. Rag over junk.  @AppFlyer

797204961243303936 2016-11-11 22:30:48 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime @AppFlyer Said some things about the SEALs during his last time with them in Afghanistan. Lol.
797204815667462144 2016-11-11 22:30:14 UTC <LewisC919> @AppFlyer I tbink @TimTakesTime took it as more of an ideological question. I was trying to be funny.

797201229474656256 2016-11-11 22:15:59 UTC <LewisC919> @LauraWalkerKC I gather her offered her something.
797198721498968065 2016-11-11 22:06:01 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox First female POTUS? Since we're into the dynastic thing. I could dig it. Ha.

797037254346731520 2016-11-11 11:24:24 UTC <LewisC919> @jonathankappler and mail in have to be received by today with a Tuesday postmark? Or was it yesterday?

796930638897152000 2016-11-10 04:20:45 UTC <LewisC919> @DunsScottus Looks like the political parties. Either at the convention or a committee. https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/electors.html
796929629768581120 2016-11-10 04:16:44 UTC <LewisC919> @DunsScottus https://www.sosnc.gov/electoral/ here's NC but it doesn't say how the electors are chosen. By the party? Was just curious.
796928788965818368 2016-11-10 04:13:24 UTC <LewisC919> @DunsScottus Gotcha.
796927786304831488 2016-11-10 04:09:25 UTC <LewisC919> @DunsScottus I mean, they're GOP electors, right? Best they could hope would be to withhold 270. Doubt they'd go for HRC.
796926926082494464 2016-11-10 04:06:00 UTC <LewisC919> @DunsScottus With what you were commenting on, I was curious. Thanks.
796926402465562624 2016-11-10 04:03:55 UTC <LewisC919> @DunsScottus Can Congress reject electoral votes without cause? I mean is it discretionary?
796918302400540673 2016-11-10 03:31:43 UTC <LewisC919> @LauraWalkerKC "but I'm too pretty to go to jail!"

796838132058624000 2016-11-10 22:13:09 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Kind of pointless. Mc hasn't been in charge and neither will Cooper if he replaces him. Super-majority is intact.

796361343804866560 2016-11-09 14:38:34 UTC <LewisC919> @PrivateSnuffy what worries me is the burnt bridges. Dole was right that he's malleable. Needs to be a kiss/makeup with the right "molders."

796244562473865218 2016-11-08 06:54:31 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica And have to deal with GOP supermajorities. There is that at least.
796242359159758848 2016-11-08 06:45:46 UTC <LewisC919> lmao.
796216228050272256 2016-11-08 05:01:56 UTC <LewisC919> @jonathankappler Gotcha. So, even if Cooper pulls it off, Legislature is still in the driver's seat. Interesting dynamic.
796215529342205952 2016-11-08 04:59:09 UTC <LewisC919> @jonathankappler With the GOP supermajority intact, right?

796200114448662528 2016-11-08 03:57:54 UTC <LewisC919> @LauraWalkerKC I hope for GOP fence mending. Dole said he's malleable. The people who need to mold him need to offer themselves up to do it.
796192135922012161 2016-11-08 03:26:12 UTC <LewisC919> @PrivateSnuffy I think it's what I said. An unknown force decided to go to the polls. Can't predict the unpredictable.

796182076093505536 2016-11-08 02:46:13 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J Because it's not southern anymore. It's redneck. They're everywhere.
796181867162664960 2016-11-08 02:45:24 UTC <LewisC919> @jonathankappler What happened here? So little GOP early vote cannibalism and huge election day turnout?
796181437204590592 2016-11-08 02:43:41 UTC <LewisC919> @LauraWalkerKC Team Blue just realizing they nominated someone almost equally rotten.
796179142584705024 2016-11-08 02:34:34 UTC <LewisC919> @p4lm2 Team Blue just realizing they nominated someone almost equally rotten.
796171729030828036 2016-11-08 02:05:07 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica Hopefully they can sway Manchin, Heitkamp, and Tester on SCOTUS if the Senate goes down. Heller in danger.
796167515663716352 2016-11-08 01:48:22 UTC <LewisC919> @jonathankappler Really?! Supermajority threatened in the House?!
796165982410670080 2016-11-08 01:42:16 UTC <LewisC919> @JNB_USA_ saw someone say Broward isn't in. If true, she'll net some votes from that.
796163712285556737 2016-11-08 01:33:15 UTC <LewisC919> @JNB_USA_ he's up that much?
796157022790098948 2016-11-08 01:06:40 UTC <LewisC919> @jonathankappler that's pretty cool. Never looked at the state site. Just media reports.
796155655509962753 2016-11-08 01:01:14 UTC <LewisC919> @jonathankappler how do you know which votes are which?
796140277060829184 2016-11-08 00:00:08 UTC <LewisC919> @WillReinier Bet a lot of statewide races get more votes than the top race.

796003561050144768 2016-11-08 14:56:52 UTC <LewisC919> @polar_mcbear In part due to a bad makeup job. Folks were just as superficial back then. Lol.

795940592513675264 2016-11-08 10:46:39 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus Best scenarios: keep the House & hope for Senate tie.

795789811558875137 2016-11-07 00:47:30 UTC <LewisC919> @Arrowheadbroken Should've said you were her. Transitioning... Haha.
795762583634644992 2016-11-07 22:59:19 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill fair enough. I'd agree but only from a tactical standpoint. Concealed is the way to go. 
795756348235399168 2016-11-07 22:34:32 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill I'd be cool with it if you made the same assumption about the open carrying Asian dude at Walmart. Lol.
795754255881748480 2016-11-07 22:26:13 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill my bad. You got my point. Was sending it at the same time you sent this.
795754050977492993 2016-11-07 22:25:24 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill Uh-huh. Do what you're doing with anyone other firearm owning rural Caucasians... well, you wouldn't.
795747899586019328 2016-11-07 22:00:58 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill there are a couple folks who open carry in my Wally World. One of them a minority. No issues.
795747328950931460 2016-11-07 21:58:42 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill buzzed hair, camo britches, t-shirt. That's could be my nephews any given day.
795740238161199105 2016-11-07 21:30:31 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill Just based on appearance? Or hair style plus firearm does it? Sister buzzed the nephews' hair like that last night.
795700052840816640 2016-11-07 18:50:50 UTC <LewisC919> @LordMitchal no sticker for mailing. https://twitter.com/MOlewiscarroll/status/794869012572282881
795688620439072770 2016-11-07 18:05:24 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 in NC, there is usually a heavier R turnout on election day. Why early voting is so impt to Ds. Need huge numbers to counteract.
795626000558211072 2016-11-07 13:56:35 UTC <LewisC919> @MrJoshPerry glad you're okay.

795447323111395329 2016-11-06 02:06:35 UTC <LewisC919> @ItsAJoshParty that's a mean mugging pup. Lol.
795446414704787456 2016-11-06 02:02:58 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht I don't think there's much humility in either one of them. 1 or 10 million vote margin will be treated the same.
795436469577990145 2016-11-06 01:23:27 UTC <LewisC919> @TroopsinContact Enjoy while you can. Kiddo will be yanking that sucker out soon enough.

794290463951888384 2016-11-03 21:29:38 UTC <LewisC919> @PrivateSnuffy Not scientific. Just an observation. Also seeing folks who never voted or haven't in over decade talk abt going for him.
794290046350213122 2016-11-03 21:27:58 UTC <LewisC919> @PrivateSnuffy I still think there's some unknown T vote. Primary vote had a 30 min wait. Never happened before. Usually, I'm alone.

789633768231403520 2016-10-21 01:05:35 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica Bakery oatmeal raisin trapped me at Sam's. Opened on the way home. 
789629276026970112 2016-10-21 00:47:44 UTC <LewisC919> @BDayspring If that's Jones, he'll be on my ballot. Might have to go with his opponent.

789454644716118016 2016-10-21 13:13:49 UTC <LewisC919> @MapGeek_Chad Maybe they did it themselves. I hear they're good w/computers.

789341231281209345 2016-10-20 05:43:09 UTC <LewisC919> @themarriedmess fan is a good noise maker. Mother started that when we were babies. Drowns out a lot more potential wake up sounds.

789301282699902976 2016-10-20 03:04:24 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Not your job to do that while you were there. Did what you had to do and got home.
789296068181823488 2016-10-20 02:43:41 UTC <LewisC919> @ScattyLight for sure. When those cut out coupon mailers come, I turn into a piggy. Buy one get one free? Yes! Just skip the fries. Haha.

786521437473476608 2016-10-13 10:58:18 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J Haha. I rem grandma telling me that. Think she was shocked she ironed. Grandma didn't even do that.
786508001125564416 2016-10-13 10:04:54 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J Nice. Her aunt Ethel asked to borrow an iron from one of my g-gma's friends while grandma was visiting.

786368096948871168 2016-10-12 00:48:58 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Williams talks abt that SEAL changing his mind about CK. Assume he means Boyer. If Green Berets are SEALS now... Funny fail.

786322143822901248 2016-10-12 21:46:22 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime That's the interesting thing. Know many a peacenik voting for HRC. I'm like, boots on the ground everywhere cool?

785292680150523904 2016-10-09 01:35:39 UTC <LewisC919> Not watching. Based on tweets, y'all are just seeing what you want. Has to be that.

785154605449699329 2016-10-09 16:27:00 UTC <LewisC919> @LauraWalkerKC Guy cheats, women should always try to scorched earth destroy him. Like mother did to... 
785153915193090049 2016-10-09 16:24:15 UTC <LewisC919> @LauraWalkerKC both members of that relationship. To be clear, not a Trump supporter.
785153862428753920 2016-10-09 16:24:02 UTC <LewisC919> @LauraWalkerKC maybe for a few incidents over a couple years. 40 years of it? That's some twisted sicko relationship. Something wrong w/
785051952610762752 2016-10-09 09:39:05 UTC <LewisC919> @Joel5326 Nice.
785046674964111360 2016-10-09 09:18:07 UTC <LewisC919> @Blueberrier0341 worried. Went down and all quiet now. Lots of flood damage here in Wayne. See @NewsArgusCops yesterday tweets.
785046209463549952 2016-10-09 09:16:16 UTC <LewisC919> @Blueberrier0341 Good morning buddy. No power for 11 hours now. Ditch backed up and became a lake. Got pretty close to the house. Had me
785009422695301120 2016-10-08 06:50:05 UTC <LewisC919> @G22A8 Just had a light go off. Gun totin' boy was the name. Something like that
785005917167292417 2016-10-08 06:36:10 UTC <LewisC919> @G22A8 surprisingly cool here for a hurricane to have just passed. No power, so I'm glad it's not hot.
784989859454803969 2016-10-08 05:32:21 UTC <LewisC919> @_Dan_Ryan check out the yesterday's tweets. Unbelievable stuff. @NewsArgusCops
784989441177821184 2016-10-08 05:30:41 UTC <LewisC919> @_Dan_Ryan Worst is probably yet to come. Goldsboro is already at Floyd levels. Crest will top that. Hell, my backed up ditch scared me.
784988911948955648 2016-10-08 05:28:35 UTC <LewisC919> @_Dan_Ryan Fair enough.
784988164700209153 2016-10-08 05:25:37 UTC <LewisC919> @_Dan_Ryan this was worse than predicted in my book. Lots blindsided.
784987574968455168 2016-10-08 05:23:16 UTC <LewisC919> @Jwrong All good now. Ditch backed up and got a little too close for my comfort. Went down with the wind direction shift. Power is still out
784987200878481408 2016-10-08 05:21:47 UTC <LewisC919> @hpfaithlov All over now. No worse for the wear but still no power.
784987024512192512 2016-10-08 05:21:05 UTC <LewisC919> it's over. Ditch got a little too close to the house for my comfort. Backed up not rushing. All good but still no power.
784986630553763840 2016-10-08 05:19:31 UTC <LewisC919> @Nate_Taylor it's over. Ditch backed up to within a few feet of the house. Receded when wind direction shifted thankfully.
784986337837457408 2016-10-08 05:18:21 UTC <LewisC919> @Jbird_5 All past now. Thanks for the concern.

784924683099602944 2016-10-08 01:13:22 UTC <LewisC919> Good grief. Stuff like this happened after Floyd. Already this bad? Gonna get worse even after this passes.https://twitter.com/NewsArgusCops/status/784916627833913344
784907913504624640 2016-10-08 00:06:44 UTC <LewisC919> @Neal_Inman yeah. It's "entertaining" but I'm worried about weather right now. This seems much worse than predicted in Wayne.
784893737012912128 2016-10-08 23:10:24 UTC <LewisC919> @G22A8 I can't rem the name. He had dark hair. You found one of "his" pics online in another place.

784879215598530561 2016-10-08 22:12:42 UTC <LewisC919> @Nate_Taylor gotten bad here. Power just went.
784877637273522177 2016-10-08 22:06:25 UTC <LewisC919> No power and the ditch looks like a lake. Worst wind part is now. I'm a little worried.

784619990435635200 2016-10-07 05:02:37 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus I had to look that up.  Interesting.
784600565301047298 2016-10-07 03:45:26 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill I get the left flank is a concern but the potential draw from the center/center r would dwarf it.
784600526524743680 2016-10-07 03:45:17 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill Was never a supporter but I haven't seen any evidence from the other team that going over there would have a moderating effect.
784596805795414016 2016-10-07 03:30:30 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime assertion. There's something incredibly wrong with HRC. That as the first woman P is disappointing to me.
784596532666433536 2016-10-07 03:29:25 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Ivana and Marla tried to hurt Donnie after his shenanigans. Mother did the same w/father. That's the norm. I'll stand by my

781440143169318912 2016-09-29 10:27:03 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit Coming down pretty heavily here. Can hear it over a fan.
781402858910605312 2016-09-29 07:58:53 UTC <LewisC919> Awesome. Haha.

780868174908645377 2016-09-27 20:34:15 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus siblings? They can usually get a certified birth as an immediate family member.
780868140771209216 2016-09-27 20:34:07 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus He born there? Certified birth certificate another good place to start. But I think you have to prove identity. Have parents or
780867481820884992 2016-09-27 20:31:30 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus Start with social security? If you can get that, the others might fall in place.
780865525844942849 2016-09-27 20:23:43 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus does he get mail somewhere? If there's nothing like that I think affidavits from people saying he is who he says he is.
780835691773165572 2016-09-27 18:25:10 UTC <LewisC919> @jonathankappler wasted effort? I'm sure I'm not not the only one who fast forwards through all commercials. Start shows late so I can.

780558755859730432 2016-09-26 00:04:44 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Why pay that much for WiFi?! Geezus. Could buy extra data from their mobile providers for cheaper. If needed...
780558022728966145 2016-09-26 00:01:49 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Yeah, you could be right. You mean the b&e suspect by dealer, right? Dealer kinda sounds like a legitimate seller.
780550895817875456 2016-09-26 23:33:30 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Nah. Doesn't list a name with the info. Should be included if leniency was granted for the information.

780544118179131392 2016-09-26 23:06:34 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Yeah. Did you read the link you quoted? Gun thief suspect confessed to ATF that he sold it to Scott.

780459505641463809 2016-09-26 17:30:21 UTC <LewisC919> @GlomarResponder good lord.

780161341097115649 2016-09-25 21:45:33 UTC <LewisC919> @seamussaid Together, it's not open carrying. If it's out of the holster, that's not open carrying either. He wasn't eligible to possess,
780077555181289474 2016-09-25 16:12:36 UTC <LewisC919> @Nate_Taylor ouch.

779897918505517057 2016-09-24 04:18:48 UTC <LewisC919> @_Dan_Ryan Specifics. He wasn't open carrying to begin with. https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1143232625751292&id=124757580932140

779875066649649152 2016-09-24 02:47:59 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox I resolve to never be in that undefined zone between holster and a threat. Wisest course of action.
779873987081936900 2016-09-24 02:43:42 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox Maybe outside of their knowledge. I think we know too much that they didn't to judge them. Just judgement call/gut thing.
779872870453260288 2016-09-24 02:39:16 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox If that description by DM is accurate, I say imminent danger.pic.twitter.com/1oTq2XWNd6
779870983847079936 2016-09-24 02:31:46 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox I don't know. Aren't you no longer open carrying the moment you unholster it? Would seem you're a millimeter from brandishing.
779870162459750400 2016-09-24 02:28:30 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox I dunno. Not sure how you even venture into the carrying debate when he wasn't eligible to possess it to being with.
779868847478374404 2016-09-24 02:23:17 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox Illegal possession because of drugs then got shady/non compliment and became a threat?
779842728792293376 2016-09-24 00:39:29 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime The possibility is there, tho. Once classified as personnel files, it sealed forever currently. No worse off. @th3v0t4ry
779841658577887232 2016-09-24 00:35:14 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry @TimTakesTime Maybe I'm wrong on that. Starting in 7 days, LE won't be the final arbiter. Convince a judge, and it's released.
779841162094010368 2016-09-24 00:33:16 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry I think it was a procedural thing and not wanting the guy's demise for eternal Internet fodder. @TimTakesTime
779840556029665280 2016-09-24 00:30:51 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry Chief says he released after the SBI gave him the all clear. I think that's why he delayed. Also: @TimTakesTimepic.twitter.com/deInoRZ0rD

779824515291422720 2016-09-24 23:27:07 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Thanks. Was hoping to see that it was on his person.
779823525687418884 2016-09-24 23:23:11 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Y'all have a drop holster and drop blunt, too? (Attempt at humor not smart ass.)https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/779821715236847617
779808724487659520 2016-09-24 22:24:22 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Eh, that's kinda a lie. I'd never open carry a handgun. I think it's stupid. Concealed is the way to go. @GroundChuck74
779808569516515328 2016-09-24 22:23:45 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime For the record, I'm not an NRA member. Was Scott granted "relief" or pardoned? @GroundChuck74pic.twitter.com/cOiRPh5Krg

779799637981073408 2016-09-24 21:48:16 UTC <LewisC919> @GroundChuck74 @TimTakesTime questioned the NRA's silence. What I was addressing with that.
779799192625614848 2016-09-24 21:46:30 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Saying the NRA wouldn't be screaming bloody matter after the fact when more information is available. @GroundChuck74
779798201968824320 2016-09-24 21:42:33 UTC <LewisC919> @GroundChuck74 Regardless, I would hope the NRA wouldn't be defending possession of firearm by a felon.  @TimTakesTime

779794515699859456 2016-09-24 21:27:55 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime They'd have to know theirs and other's cameras wouldn't show his hands and get it down awfully fast for the wife's vid.

779178438703845376 2016-09-22 04:39:50 UTC <LewisC919> @DunsScottus g'night.
779178037480976384 2016-09-22 04:38:15 UTC <LewisC919> Gotcha. Well, thanks. It's not a requirement but after 2.5 years, I wondered if I'd ever earn it. Lol.
779170736032317440 2016-09-22 04:09:14 UTC <LewisC919> Interesting. So never getting the follow back is probably a good thing? 
779152912274587652 2016-09-22 02:58:24 UTC <LewisC919> @pptsapper I'd say, "Feinstein's so called assault weapons ban only received 40 votes in a 55 D Senate. Pass confiscation?" Then I'd .
779143380572004352 2016-09-22 02:20:32 UTC <LewisC919> Under the current law, it could stay under wraps forever. Come 10/1, anyone has the right to challenge that decision in court.
779142992166842368 2016-09-22 02:18:59 UTC <LewisC919> They're under no obligation to release the video before or after 10/1. If they were, why isn't someone making them do so now?
779141949177540608 2016-09-22 02:14:51 UTC <LewisC919> @TroopsinContact hopefully not as stubborn as me. Dragged me out by forceps 12 hours later. Big head/forceps=44 stitches. #ImSorryMommy
779140246483132416 2016-09-22 02:08:05 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry I only went up and down a couple times. Can't imagine your number. Dunno if you do leg days. If so, can skip for a few. 
779137993131094016 2016-09-22 01:59:07 UTC <LewisC919> @AppFlyer No McSteam or McDream. Everybody's dead! What's the point? 
779136317691133952 2016-09-22 01:52:28 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnDylanJessup Nice. Safe travels and have fun.
779129764447739904 2016-09-22 01:26:26 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry We def should go takeout those f'ing stairs. I'm still feeling effects of stretching underutilized parts.  @snakesl1
779106799458934785 2016-09-22 23:55:10 UTC <LewisC919> Probably one of the easier identifications to make. Can't imagine why...  What an idiot.https://twitter.com/CMPD/status/779104390179332097
779087556440907776 2016-09-22 22:38:42 UTC <LewisC919> @TroopsinContact Haha. Good thoughts your way man. Hope all goes smoothly.
779082269696913408 2016-09-22 22:17:42 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 You're nicer, tho. To some people anyway. 
779065727718400002 2016-09-22 21:11:58 UTC <LewisC919> choices suck for sure.
778979552915783680 2016-09-22 15:29:32 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica like an episode of Wild Kingdom.
778960156696702980 2016-09-22 14:12:28 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit haven't gone camping since I was a kid. Sounds like fun.
778957925498884096 2016-09-22 14:03:36 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit nice.
778887298976972800 2016-09-22 09:22:57 UTC <LewisC919> @oifoefdevildawg In Charlotte? Glad you're okay man.
778800303730663424 2016-09-21 03:37:16 UTC <LewisC919> @Kudzu81 @People4Bernie Or the fact that @PatMcCroryNC did so at the request of Chief Putney.

778755190966980608 2016-09-21 00:38:00 UTC <LewisC919> @Arrowheadbroken pipeline bypass completed early. Should be flowing soon.
778754699197415429 2016-09-21 00:36:03 UTC <LewisC919> @TroopsinContact Awesome-est game ever. Carried an n64 controller around for multi-player at friends. Haha.
778694853261533184 2016-09-21 20:38:15 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Very true. We're proof.
778673698643537921 2016-09-21 19:14:11 UTC <LewisC919> @ArmstrongABC11 lemme know when y'all get it translated. Geezus.
778644461316218880 2016-09-21 17:18:00 UTC <LewisC919> @BrianFox46 crazy stuff man. Sometimes y'all should just pull back and leave it to the helos. Not worth the risk.
778555915310071808 2016-09-21 11:26:09 UTC <LewisC919> @redcarolina good deal.
778518804032851968 2016-09-21 08:58:41 UTC <LewisC919> @BrianFox46 stay safe man.
778499982072635392 2016-09-21 07:43:54 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica well said man.
778478271856082944 2016-09-20 06:17:38 UTC <LewisC919> @Radomysisky You okay?
778476296858894336 2016-09-20 06:09:47 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime thought you'd get a kick out of that. Especially the attire.
778458560766234624 2016-09-20 04:59:18 UTC <LewisC919> @WNCN @TimTakesTime 6 ECU students nabbed after trying to steal dog for revenge, police say http://wncn.com/2016/09/20/6-ecu-students-nabbed-after-trying-to-steal-dog-for-revenge-police-say/ via @wncn
778454174715383808 2016-09-20 04:41:52 UTC <LewisC919> @LauraWalkerKC Yeah, mine kill everything that dares to cross, dig, or land here. I could do without them leaving me the headless bodies. 
778453319811420160 2016-09-20 04:38:29 UTC <LewisC919> @LauraWalkerKC No. Not only do I love my fixed semi feral porch cats, I haven't had a rodent inside in almost 10 years. 
778439122104963072 2016-09-20 03:42:04 UTC <LewisC919> @thelegendaryJT3 kinda depends. If reports that a weapon was recovered are accurate, then would be in a different category. Just my 2.
778325127515639808 2016-09-20 20:09:05 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus what happened?
778277330720522240 2016-09-20 16:59:09 UTC <LewisC919> @jonathankappler yeah. Had to pick up a Duplin kid three hours early. Pain in the butt. Haha.
778188761217789952 2016-09-20 11:07:13 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica yikes.
778165459174686720 2016-09-20 09:34:37 UTC <LewisC919> @smittie61984 mornin'.

778090631449157632 2016-09-19 04:37:17 UTC <LewisC919> @EricBandazewski rhetoric?! How many of "her" weapons have they seized?

778079125135327234 2016-09-19 03:51:34 UTC <LewisC919> @JoMadLong On his employer's time. Kinda like goofing off at work. In this case, bringing heavy emotional drama down on said employer.
778018543552040960 2016-09-19 23:50:50 UTC <LewisC919> @Arrowheadbroken poor little guy.
777990977516605440 2016-09-19 22:01:18 UTC <LewisC919> @JNB_USA_ yep. Nephew told me they did it in first grade. Haha.
777903507403931648 2016-09-19 16:13:43 UTC <LewisC919> @Oil_Guns_Merica Also, would've been enacted with an override had he vetoed.

777314477100376064 2016-09-17 01:13:07 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus what is this?
777313909485240320 2016-09-17 01:10:52 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus it's kinda awesome. Doesn't use data. Throwbacks-ish. Ear buds as antenna reminds me of putting foil on rabbit ears. Haha.

777311835364229120 2016-09-17 01:02:37 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus Will have to wait and see if Nougat trashes it, tho.
777310548803325952 2016-09-17 00:57:31 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus Have that too. May actually hang on to this one for the whole term.

776238373975588868 2016-09-14 01:57:04 UTC <LewisC919> lost the feeling in one of my fingers for few days carrying groceries. One trip, so it was worth it.

776171504065253376 2016-09-14 21:31:21 UTC <LewisC919> @WardrobeDoor Actually, with no enforcement mechanism or penalties, it's not applicable anywhere. A travesty with no victims? Lololol.
776171025696448512 2016-09-14 21:29:27 UTC <LewisC919> @WardrobeDoor I didn't realize the venues/hotels/restaurants were owned by the state. They must be. Only way the law would be applicable.

775496741412073473 2016-09-12 00:50:05 UTC <LewisC919> @_Dan_Ryan Gotcha. Good thoughts your way.
775490638238318592 2016-09-12 00:25:50 UTC <LewisC919> @TheBenSwain Bathroom portion is unique. Other aspects are codified in many states. Definite hypocrisy.pic.twitter.com/ywCpKo4uIt
775488548132777986 2016-09-12 00:17:32 UTC <LewisC919> @TheBenSwain Do they pull out of other states with similar laws already on the books? Kinda hypocritical if not.
775487486210478080 2016-09-12 00:13:19 UTC <LewisC919> @PeaceLoveFlake NC doesn't have home rule. They should've waited until there was no supermajority and a D gov. Loss was assured.
775486472690470912 2016-09-12 00:09:17 UTC <LewisC919> @JamesCurle "Best case" scenario is they lose their super majority. Control isn't in play. Meaning the folks who control the agenda stay.
775485763941179393 2016-09-12 00:06:28 UTC <LewisC919> @WXMoose Agree with that actually. As long as you blame Charlotte and the state. Unnecessary fight all around. @PeaceLoveFlake
775477050157240321 2016-09-12 23:31:51 UTC <LewisC919> @WXMoose More targeting of D cities and districts to punish Rs. Folks need to adjust the sights on their firearms.

775444417608048643 2016-09-12 21:22:10 UTC <LewisC919> @ski2point0 Latter will be a good thing in the long run.

775161739222671364 2016-09-11 02:38:55 UTC <LewisC919> If the mood strikes, easy trip to Raleigh, Wilmington, Jacksonville, Fayetteville, or Greenville, though.

775107133662752768 2016-09-11 23:01:56 UTC <LewisC919> People, "free speech" is protection from governmental punishment. Private employers and the public can do/say as they please to "punish."

774823570727919616 2016-09-10 04:15:09 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 Had too many dealings w/the Fed govt to believe there's enough intelligent people there to pull it off. Agree to disagree.
774821114874822656 2016-09-10 04:05:23 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 You give them too much credit. Chronic incompetence is a requirement for govt work. No way they could organize that. Lol.

774710669417541632 2016-09-10 20:46:31 UTC <LewisC919> @TommyAmenta Operation "Make Me Un-cuttable" is resounding success. Sorry, I'm a cynic.

774697639434747905 2016-09-10 19:54:45 UTC <LewisC919> @_Dan_Ryan Nice. Also cringing at Gvegas' already awful traffic being bumped up by fan's departing. Haha.

773726366953009152 2016-09-07 03:35:15 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus Timing. Should've done this all along. Just looks like a cushion for his journey into mediocrity now.
773687415336734720 2016-09-07 01:00:28 UTC <LewisC919> Folks deliberately watching something they know will give them a cerebrovascular accident and then bitching about it. Probably cutters, too.

773364718945853440 2016-09-06 03:38:12 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill Well, one thing would help but having never been done before makes it enigmatic. Convention of States putting up term limits.

772167736394915840 2016-09-03 20:21:49 UTC <LewisC919> @JimLaPorta I dunno. Has the significant other signed off?

772104879468843009 2016-09-03 16:12:02 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 Yeah, I think the engine is pretty much the same as back then (90s). Bodies were much larger.
772104290303414272 2016-09-03 16:09:42 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 I loved driving grandma's Sedan DeVilles. Like a tank.

771550612026556417 2016-09-01 03:29:35 UTC <LewisC919> @thedesertape If he had done it at the top, maybe. Cusp of mediocrity, meh. Self serving. Sorry I'm so glass half empty. 
771542206196781056 2016-09-01 02:56:11 UTC <LewisC919> @goatactual Dude.
771524148443119617 2016-09-01 01:44:25 UTC <LewisC919> Dude. Don't say stuff like that. Even in jest. I bet The Wicked Witch of the East said something like that right before...

766718218497064960 2016-08-19 19:27:22 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking All true. Given optics, maybe use an electric putting partner/putting mat thing in the living room instead.
766716261573206016 2016-08-19 19:19:36 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking just one failsafe from kaboom. They left part of the bomb in the crater. Groundwater flooded it. Not far from me.

766709153813389312 2016-08-19 18:51:21 UTC <LewisC919> @DicksTrash I like the classic stuff but I also like some of the 80s & 90s stuff. I was listening to that in the car with my mom as a kid.
766707818103701505 2016-08-19 18:46:03 UTC <LewisC919> @DicksTrash I like that one. Listening to the classic country station now actually.

766688736944029697 2016-08-19 17:30:13 UTC <LewisC919> @ScribblerSix That's a shitty resolution of that. Esp that there will be little public airing that the govt lied abt the criminal stuff.
766673006768844800 2016-08-19 16:27:43 UTC <LewisC919> @NickKoumalatsos good read man. Hope you have a good weekend.

766121321424117760 2016-08-17 03:55:31 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking Guy seems so douchey. Can't imagine one "friend" lying for him. Let alone 3.

765451993607446528 2016-08-16 07:35:51 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking that mall is a beast of a place. Been a few times. Venture that there were many out towers school shopping. Not regulars.
765450208792698880 2016-08-16 07:28:45 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking guess if you're in the main hall of a mall, that's gonna be hard to do. Maybe try to get out of store emg exits. Not main.
765449652154032128 2016-08-16 07:26:33 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking think I'll start figuring out alternative exits for everywhere I go now.
765448833023238144 2016-08-16 07:23:17 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking Interesting and scary. They could "attack" us just by yelling "fire."
765446979958804480 2016-08-16 07:15:55 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking I get why but sounds like folks almost were killed it the panic. I'm sure it'll happen one day.

755949292267905024 2016-07-20 02:15:30 UTC <LewisC919> @redcarolina I don't disagree that he  should've stayed home but that's not politics. Expect my nephews to lack a filter. Not 70 somethings.

751400726044303361 2016-07-08 13:01:08 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry I think they detonated his bomb but it's not exactly clear.

751399145760489472 2016-07-08 12:54:51 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking see "Wicked's" RTs.
751398790138044416 2016-07-08 12:53:26 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking no TV on but I'm seeing suspect attributed statements RT from a news conference.
751398360142254080 2016-07-08 12:51:44 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking Who's the police chief quoting then?
751395341849812992 2016-07-08 12:39:44 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus Some in custody one self inflicted death.
751387395577286656 2016-07-08 12:08:09 UTC <LewisC919> @scrivenlking who?
751330234696425472 2016-07-08 08:21:01 UTC <LewisC919> @LauraWalkerKC good night. Good work tonight, ma'am.
751307189336309760 2016-07-07 06:49:27 UTC <LewisC919> @OConnell75thRR not gonna like this. Just say yeah.
751296120551276544 2016-07-07 06:05:28 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnFenoglio No doubt. Wish there was a way to get crowd sourced info to them more easily. Exonerating vid was found almost instantly.
751287968778813440 2016-07-07 05:33:04 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Desperately needs a flat iron, too. Lol.

751254066819457025 2016-07-07 03:18:21 UTC <LewisC919> @LLacz good read.
751248749163347968 2016-07-07 02:57:13 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus Perfect opportunity presented itself. Large number tightly concentrated. Cert could've been someone waiting for the right moment.
751220646122848256 2016-07-07 01:05:33 UTC <LewisC919> @DuffySends An hour from there. Same storm struck and burnt a nearby church down. Lightning was intense.
751219975902400512 2016-07-07 01:02:53 UTC <LewisC919> @DaveMBP Congrats brother.
751209423419375616 2016-07-07 00:20:57 UTC <LewisC919> @TroopsinContact Wasn't that heavy but have a 99th percentile noggin. 44 stitches. Mom is still sore at me. Lol.
751204623067803648 2016-07-07 00:01:53 UTC <LewisC919> @TroopsinContact hi puppy.
751204554008657920 2016-07-07 00:01:37 UTC <LewisC919> YES!
751204476141334528 2016-07-07 00:01:18 UTC <LewisC919> @mpv1123 what's up?
751203316806320128 2016-07-07 23:56:42 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit It definitely was.
751203275047854080 2016-07-07 23:56:32 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus they paused to not interfere with the FBI inquiry.
751167899566501888 2016-07-07 21:35:57 UTC <LewisC919> Funny thing. I couldn't get the glass door open to escape. Blowing it closed.

750986599899553792 2016-07-07 09:35:32 UTC <LewisC919> @Blueberrier0341 good morning bud.
750940674950852608 2016-07-06 06:33:03 UTC <LewisC919> @WardrobeDoor I hear what you're saying but he wasn't a gun owner. Felonious possession.
750921713836326912 2016-07-06 05:17:42 UTC <LewisC919> good night man.
750874896239038466 2016-07-06 02:11:40 UTC <LewisC919> @LauraWalkerKC I think there's a weird combination going on. Trump has fooled many but they also know they're burning the house down w/him.
750873678477398016 2016-07-06 02:06:50 UTC <LewisC919> @LauraWalkerKC Always been my thought. She won the moment Rubio torpedoed himself with Gang of eight.
750873049415778304 2016-07-06 02:04:20 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit That sounds perfect. Rest well man.
750859325363589120 2016-07-06 01:09:48 UTC <LewisC919> @aguyfromtx Wasn't he a convicted felon? Thought I read that somewhere. If so, he can't possess, let alone carry a firearm.
750852177636319236 2016-07-06 00:41:23 UTC <LewisC919> @ScattyLight Haha.
750839729105440768 2016-07-06 23:51:56 UTC <LewisC919> Whoa. That's a throwback.

749596361671180288 2016-07-03 13:31:14 UTC <LewisC919> If not literal, that's some really obscure shit. Google got nothing on it. Haha. I'm lost.

748906209277800448 2016-07-01 15:48:48 UTC <LewisC919> @elvisknievil Will never part with my 70s harvest golden toilet. 2 flushes never necessary. Ha.
748902315801927680 2016-07-01 15:33:20 UTC <LewisC919> @Jackie0351 Wait. I don't follow you on Instagram. I don't know how FB knew to suggest you. My bad.
748901489448480769 2016-07-01 15:30:03 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox So, "you" have to redraw? Or not known yet?
748901038082629632 2016-07-01 15:28:16 UTC <LewisC919> @Jackie0351 Wires are all crossed. Was suggesting Instagram follows for me over the weekend. Yourself included.

747428708286341120 2016-06-27 13:57:45 UTC <LewisC919> @jonathankappler Which side are they granting a hearing for? Imagine GOP wants old maps. Ds don't like new maps.
747415085178585088 2016-06-27 13:03:37 UTC <LewisC919> @DuffySends this is probably one.

746169112469114884 2016-06-23 02:32:34 UTC <LewisC919> @LauraWalkerKC Not read up on this. It's a binding thing that forces the govt to figure out how to withdraw or is it instant?

745675296163119104 2016-06-22 17:50:19 UTC <LewisC919> @ski0331USMC Whole premise of the sit in is that they have no redress. They do and can have a vote. Discharge petition.
745673400887148544 2016-06-22 17:42:47 UTC <LewisC919> @ski0331USMC Shhhhh. Ds can't have a House majority without 3-4 dozen blue dogs. Only want gun control when they're not in power.
745669583592390656 2016-06-22 17:27:37 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht Better question. Why didn't she have a vote back then? Only a priority for Ds when out of power.

742930060202651652 2016-06-14 04:01:43 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill and telling people who want solutions that firearms that lack cosmetic features are less deadly is? It's not so much the lack

742766668527570949 2016-06-14 17:12:28 UTC <LewisC919> @flimflam93 I'm near Goldsboro. After Fran, 96, we didn't have power for a week.  In September. Misery.
742762974146924544 2016-06-14 16:57:47 UTC <LewisC919> @flimflam93 definitely a little steamy today.
742736341390266368 2016-06-14 15:11:57 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos go have some fun.

742702183032971264 2016-06-14 12:56:13 UTC <LewisC919> @LauraWalkerKC Mornin'.
742695966780882944 2016-06-14 12:31:31 UTC <LewisC919> @Screaming_Eagle Unless, some were trampled to death in a stampede. Then, it would sound more feasible. Need more info.
742695555797815296 2016-06-14 12:29:53 UTC <LewisC919> @Screaming_Eagle Need a timeline. How many shot and when. Also, number of rounds fired. Would assume hundreds for the casualties. Is weird.
742660477268992004 2016-06-14 10:10:30 UTC <LewisC919> @TommyD6336 gut it. Lol.
742653273975468032 2016-06-14 09:41:53 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit Oh my God. That's probably a week's worth for me. Mornin'.
742644097102548992 2016-06-14 09:05:25 UTC <LewisC919> Haha.
742632100323569664 2016-06-14 08:17:44 UTC <LewisC919> @Blueberrier0341 Good morning.
742631549183627264 2016-06-14 08:15:33 UTC <LewisC919> It's hard to tweet with one hand and aim with the other?

742530073161543680 2016-06-13 01:32:19 UTC <LewisC919> @aguyfromtx Well, I'm shocked. Based on the tweet, I was expecting BF announcement.

742514122009530369 2016-06-13 00:28:56 UTC <LewisC919> @Radomysisky Gotcha. I think I saw you yesterday but I use a third party app.

742438435244412928 2016-06-13 19:28:11 UTC <LewisC919> @ScattyLight what should you name or you're thinking of calling it puppy?
742436077546393600 2016-06-13 19:18:49 UTC <LewisC919> @welcometoboz it's stereotyping but I'd imagine he didn't think he'd experience any opposition or resistance.
742385797488336896 2016-06-13 15:59:01 UTC <LewisC919> @_Lester_Bangs porch cat got ahold of one once. Never heard such a racket.
742297822981152769 2016-06-13 10:09:26 UTC <LewisC919> mornin'.
742247560946028544 2016-06-12 06:49:43 UTC <LewisC919> @donachaidh night.
742221900865212416 2016-06-12 05:07:45 UTC <LewisC919> gotta ease in man. Liver won't survive that kind of immediate trauma. Lololol.
742212000705568768 2016-06-12 04:28:25 UTC <LewisC919> @MarineRebb did a "wait, what" there before I saw the quote marks. 
742211340434067456 2016-06-12 04:25:47 UTC <LewisC919> @kevinbigley I prob fucked up that math/percentages (lol) but I hope the point got across. 
742210776052686848 2016-06-12 04:23:33 UTC <LewisC919> @kevinbigley used in a heinous crime yesterday. Owners of the the other 99.9999666667 aren't bad guys.
742210706674683904 2016-06-12 04:23:16 UTC <LewisC919> @kevinbigley we've had a calm rational discussion, which is nice. The "evil Ar15" yelling isn't helping.  About 0.0000333333 of them were
742208767014666240 2016-06-12 04:15:34 UTC <LewisC919> @kevinbigley That guy wasn't a felon until he fired the first round. Not even then, as he wasn't charged yet.
742208421655633920 2016-06-12 04:14:11 UTC <LewisC919> @kevinbigley I don't necessarily disagree. Preemptively stopping clean record folks is always going to be an issue, though.
742206278525685760 2016-06-12 04:05:40 UTC <LewisC919> @kevinbigley Hell, the govt processor could've even delayed the approval for 3 days. Time to set up surveillance.
742205697778192384 2016-06-12 04:03:22 UTC <LewisC919> @kevinbigley If he was on an internal watch list, someone was notified of the purchase. Should've been active surveillance.
742201076355588096 2016-06-12 03:45:00 UTC <LewisC919> @kevinbigley rethink due process? That would require an amendment in and of itself...reshaping it to guilty until proven innocent.
742197551626092544 2016-06-12 03:31:00 UTC <LewisC919> @kevinbigley Absent a conviction, it's not so easy to deprive people of rights. Due process thing.
742195964405002240 2016-06-12 03:24:41 UTC <LewisC919> @kevinbigley multiple background checks in addition to the ones for the firearms purchase.
742195823790940160 2016-06-12 03:24:08 UTC <LewisC919> @kevinbigley He wasn't a prohibited person. "Security officer at one of the world's largest private security companies." Prob passed
742194058022555652 2016-06-12 03:17:07 UTC <LewisC919> @kevinbigley Not exactly. Prior investigation was inconclusive and it was closed. He wasn't a prohibited person.
742191192666984448 2016-06-12 03:05:44 UTC <LewisC919> Good night.
742187536773222400 2016-06-12 02:51:12 UTC <LewisC919> @JoMadLong And, if it ain't about potties, who's interested in the that. #Yawn 
742186828099424261 2016-06-12 02:48:23 UTC <LewisC919> @JoMadLong I think he could do exactly what that lobby wants and they still wouldn't like it. It's kinda a monolithic voting bloc.
742185391088893952 2016-06-12 02:42:41 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry rest well buddy.
742166925304844288 2016-06-12 01:29:18 UTC <LewisC919> @donachaidh busy gal.
742147212646440960 2016-06-12 00:10:58 UTC <LewisC919> @Screaming_Eagle mean words kill, man. Starving without those cakes, too.

742132582503067648 2016-06-12 23:12:50 UTC <LewisC919> @donachaidh Based on his late night tweeting, probably dancin' creepin'.  @freelancer9186
742130406233939968 2016-06-12 23:04:11 UTC <LewisC919> @GIJOE6732 good show.
742127138527162369 2016-06-12 22:51:12 UTC <LewisC919> @ShadeofFulcher @ShadeOfFulcher It would probably get the list struck down. Restricting an enumerated right without due process, no bueno.
742122132486914048 2016-06-12 22:31:19 UTC <LewisC919> @donachaidh Some components of a mark 39 warhead are buried in swamp near here. If you're interested. 
742120284346568704 2016-06-12 22:23:58 UTC <LewisC919> @donachaidh Not as bad as the tweet makes it sound. But, most probably won't read it.
742117162601549825 2016-06-12 22:11:34 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit Huh? Did you sneak in here when driving through no olives town? 
742116467357974528 2016-06-12 22:08:48 UTC <LewisC919> @donachaidh Who are these people? I'm so out of touch. 1/5 
742114318024646659 2016-06-12 22:00:15 UTC <LewisC919> @BrianFox46 OMG. Need to find where they're getting in after dark. They should be gone. Babies, tho... lol.
742113221599997952 2016-06-12 21:55:54 UTC <LewisC919> @TommyD6336 Nice. Have fun.
742108134282539008 2016-06-12 21:35:41 UTC <LewisC919> @_Lester_Bangs I'd imagine federal/state protocols are being rethought as we "speak."
742107647902679040 2016-06-12 21:33:45 UTC <LewisC919> @_Lester_Bangs I don't like to second guess but wonder if collateral damage would've been worth getting to some of the wounded sooner.
742105827293704193 2016-06-12 21:26:31 UTC <LewisC919> @_Lester_Bangs Thereabouts. Only when they started getting calls there were 30 people in another section of the bounding in danger.

742080211592843264 2016-06-12 19:44:44 UTC <LewisC919> @thedesertape True. They don't need to come here. Just a little imagery and the right mindset and boom.
742077395830775808 2016-06-12 19:33:32 UTC <LewisC919> @BrianFox46 Sad is right. It's just uber complicated to do anything to stop a first time actor. Even if suspected. Due process and all.
742076289654370304 2016-06-12 19:29:09 UTC <LewisC919> @BrianFox46 Hear what you're saying but you have to be convicted of a crime to become ineligible to purchase.

742066927930118144 2016-06-12 18:51:57 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht Think it would get the whole list struck down re due process. A temp hold (days) and then make a legal case to extend?

741957676364632064 2016-06-12 11:37:49 UTC <LewisC919> @ski0331USMC head scratcher. Would think the ones capable of that organization level would target the govt.

741422213451120640 2016-06-10 00:10:05 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J No retort. Just a block. "They" don't like it when their echo chamber is breached.https://twitter.com/MOlewiscarroll/status/617854638470074368

741391728859590656 2016-06-10 22:08:57 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht tempertantrumpscout was on that this morning. I gather anyway. Couldn't see his tweets quoted by someone arguing w/him. 
741335489475665920 2016-06-10 18:25:28 UTC <LewisC919> @TheMask1993 something we have in common. Haha.
741264661216174080 2016-06-10 13:44:01 UTC <LewisC919> @ski0331USMC Safe travels.
741262474784182272 2016-06-10 13:35:20 UTC <LewisC919> @NavyGilbert kinda glad that's not something I've experienced.
741150361671569408 2016-06-09 06:09:50 UTC <LewisC919> @freelancer9186 you almost killed me. Munching on cucumber and nearly choked from laughing. 
741139645287804935 2016-06-09 05:27:15 UTC <LewisC919> @mpv1123 jealous.
741126869026799616 2016-06-09 04:36:29 UTC <LewisC919> @ItsAJoshParty call someone man. Hell, say you're so mad you could scream and  actually do it.
741114437441073152 2016-06-09 03:47:05 UTC <LewisC919> @tonyidigmusic sounds like a fun time.
741110850921041920 2016-06-09 03:32:50 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit Oh, I'm not saying don't date crazy. Just not to let her hold a firearm in your presence. 
741110022038560769 2016-06-09 03:29:33 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit How high is the eyebrow arch? Height is proportional to batshit. Too high, don't take her there.

741105459831132160 2016-06-09 03:11:25 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry NJ had a stop sign at an interstate ramp merge. How do you merge into 70 mph traffic from 0?  Freaked out rural driver. Haha.
741102458479468544 2016-06-09 02:59:29 UTC <LewisC919> @tonyidigmusic throwback.
741095521570410497 2016-06-09 02:31:55 UTC <LewisC919> Watching Mama's Family. Episode reminds of something grandma Lee used to sing. "Down in the meadow in a little bitty pool..."
741084073465118725 2016-06-09 01:46:26 UTC <LewisC919> @mpv1123 I'm too old, unfortunately. Unless...you got daddy issues?

741025964088430592 2016-06-09 21:55:32 UTC <LewisC919> @MrJoshPerry had prodigy Internet way back in 91. Long distance, too.  @AleeJuliet
741003993439162368 2016-06-09 20:28:13 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J with some ceremonial dance, right?
741003697593946112 2016-06-09 20:27:03 UTC <LewisC919> @MrJoshPerry and I probably didn't use mortality properly in that, either. 
741002632790167552 2016-06-09 20:22:49 UTC <LewisC919> @MrJoshPerry my view is more cloudy than yesterday. Kinda like death without surgery and 90% mortality with surgery. #Decisions
741001709078597632 2016-06-09 20:19:09 UTC <LewisC919> @JNB_USA_ what's wrong?
741001308195459073 2016-06-09 20:17:33 UTC <LewisC919> @Neal_Inman except grandma. Even worse. 
741001030352113664 2016-06-09 20:16:27 UTC <LewisC919> Know a guy there. He snapped me a miserable looking selfie with 107 yesterday. I'd need a lot of underwear/day. Lol.
741000367509508096 2016-06-09 20:13:49 UTC <LewisC919> @Michael_Goggans thanks for the heads up man. Will be taking advantage of that.
740981055704977410 2016-06-09 18:57:05 UTC <LewisC919> @mpv1123 Haha.
740980706336231424 2016-06-09 18:55:41 UTC <LewisC919> @RBirdmanParrott good stuff. @BettyCrocker
740970906563006464 2016-06-09 18:16:45 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus It's a ways off, tho. Reciprocity had 57 votes in a 55 D Senate. Still...
740969153780174850 2016-06-09 18:09:47 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus Clinton appointment SCOTUS affirms, a federal law banning nationwide CCW would be constitutional.
740968266559016960 2016-06-09 18:06:15 UTC <LewisC919> @GlomarResponder Gotcha. Thanks.
740967534820786176 2016-06-09 18:03:21 UTC <LewisC919> @GlomarResponder not arguing, just curious. So, this doesn't strike down Montana's carry laws. It just says Cali can do as it pleases. ?
740966582814445568 2016-06-09 17:59:34 UTC <LewisC919> @GlomarResponder Hear ya. Also, opportunity for a split leading to Scotus is limited. Circuits that might have little to challenge, right?
740965752451301377 2016-06-09 17:56:16 UTC <LewisC919> @mpv1123 what?
740964585419735040 2016-06-09 17:51:38 UTC <LewisC919> @GlomarResponder So, as long as there isn't a federal law on the subject, it would be left up to the individual states?
740826604427980801 2016-06-09 08:43:21 UTC <LewisC919> @Blueberrier0341 that's good. Guessing that falling back to sleep on the gym equipment is frowned upon. Ha. Have a good day buddy.
740825528182149120 2016-06-09 08:39:04 UTC <LewisC919> @Blueberrier0341 doing okay here. How about you?
740788708253806592 2016-06-08 06:12:45 UTC <LewisC919> @mpv1123 can still get a little.
740787964159131648 2016-06-08 06:09:48 UTC <LewisC919> @mpv1123 what time you have to be up?

734484904151547904 2016-05-22 20:43:41 UTC <LewisC919> @MrJoshPerry Nah. There's no topping allowing someone from the other party to be your nominee.

729473114355150850 2016-05-08 00:48:38 UTC <LewisC919> @mikandynothem how much slower is it than the wired fast charger?
729469224423403520 2016-05-08 00:33:10 UTC <LewisC919> @_Lester_Bangs fancy schmancy. Gonna go take a dump on my 1975 harvest golden toilet now. Haha.

728012754980741120 2016-05-04 00:05:41 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox Interesting. Imagine it has to pass first. Filibuster...
728011759701778432 2016-05-04 00:01:43 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox So, intent is altered in the court's view even with a veto? Obviously, just the ambiguous parts.
728010916411777024 2016-05-04 23:58:22 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox Doesn't that require POTUS' signature?
728010301900095488 2016-05-04 23:55:56 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox We need an amendment. Congress gets an up or down on EO/Regs. State legislatures get the same for Congressional acts.

727972232488570882 2016-05-04 21:24:39 UTC <LewisC919> @Montel_Williams They can just repeal the bathroom section and leave the prohibition on local action/fines. I'd be fine with that.

724509707109543936 2016-04-25 08:05:49 UTC <LewisC919> @BigCountry1510 very often since the advent of smart phones. 
724367626147868672 2016-04-24 22:41:14 UTC <LewisC919> @10keller You okay?
724357986039291905 2016-04-24 22:02:56 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit Naps are the best.
724338557779881986 2016-04-24 20:45:44 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 You should one day. Anyone who talks about their dad like you do would probably be a good one.
724337305230675968 2016-04-24 20:40:45 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 Kids leave something on the steps and they'll be orphans. Lol.
724333081168076804 2016-04-24 20:23:58 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J Grandma liked it. Her childhood row home was up a hill from there. Funny you mentioning that zoo and jogging my memory.
724332010274197504 2016-04-24 20:19:43 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J some kind of weird statue anyway. Ha.
724331898479235073 2016-04-24 20:19:16 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J Mom used to take me there when I was way too young to remember. Nana lived in DC until 82. Pics of me on a giant gargoyle?
724330495283191812 2016-04-24 20:13:42 UTC <LewisC919> @BrianFox46 Hazel, the movie. 
724325835931561987 2016-04-24 19:55:11 UTC <LewisC919> @thedesertape Mother in law ain't gonna like that. Lmao.
724325451259363329 2016-04-24 19:53:39 UTC <LewisC919> @dap1510 good to have you back.
724148575702257664 2016-04-24 08:10:49 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit drive safely man. More look out for folks who aren't.
724136622451732480 2016-04-24 07:23:19 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit Sorry man. Hope tomorrow is better.
724134990343221248 2016-04-24 07:16:50 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit what's wrong man?
724109180064391168 2016-04-23 05:34:16 UTC <LewisC919> When says typing, stops, and nothing ever comes... 
724082363148451842 2016-04-23 03:47:42 UTC <LewisC919> @DunsScottus Nana lived on Van Ness. Useless reply here. Haha.
724081974567153664 2016-04-23 03:46:10 UTC <LewisC919> @Michael_Goggans translation, please. 
724046162169352192 2016-04-23 01:23:51 UTC <LewisC919> @ski0331USMC So sorry man. Y'all will be in my thoughts.
724017117826297856 2016-04-23 23:28:27 UTC <LewisC919> @SH60B very nice.
723963513446739968 2016-04-23 19:55:26 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 like that stops you. 
723960282452758528 2016-04-23 19:42:36 UTC <LewisC919> @oifoefdevildawg how's it going?
723938495895621633 2016-04-23 18:16:02 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J I slept 7 consecutive hours last night. Nighttime sleeping. That never happens. Feel pretty good.
723908211443679232 2016-04-23 16:15:41 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 enjoy your afternoon man.
723887344839974913 2016-04-23 14:52:46 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 have a good day man.
723862281323458560 2016-04-23 13:13:11 UTC <LewisC919> @DevinRuic Careful. Now it'll start demanding it. Cats are tyrants. 
723861739213860864 2016-04-23 13:11:01 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 he's getting big.
723861373566988288 2016-04-23 13:09:34 UTC <LewisC919> @ralphprovance Lumpy Rutherford. Was a good show.
723810186507501568 2016-04-23 09:46:10 UTC <LewisC919> @freelancer9186 Ninja Turtle.
723794881299230720 2016-04-23 08:45:21 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 fell asleep at 10 pm. Just woke up. The party life. Lol.
723791563814526976 2016-04-23 08:32:10 UTC <LewisC919> @ReconSniperUSMC good job man.
723691232162099200 2016-04-22 01:53:29 UTC <LewisC919> @Michael_Goggans cool. Y'all have fun.
723691062825488384 2016-04-22 01:52:49 UTC <LewisC919> @Michael_Goggans what are y'all seeing?
723630168611368960 2016-04-22 21:50:51 UTC <LewisC919> @IJR85 have a good weekend.
723629162817269760 2016-04-22 21:46:51 UTC <LewisC919> @WillReinier Haha.
723628079281758208 2016-04-22 21:42:33 UTC <LewisC919> @Nate_Taylor That girl likes to nap. Haha.
723578212610117632 2016-04-22 18:24:23 UTC <LewisC919> @DicksTrash again? Will y'all adopt me? Haha.
723562447202856960 2016-04-22 17:21:45 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 Doing it natural or pain meds? Lol.
723537812763607040 2016-04-22 15:43:51 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys Saw other tweets saying it's a family thing. Like related victims.
723534696143941633 2016-04-22 15:31:28 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill It's not really about the bathrooms. More fine/don't fine the "bigots" in NC. Already used/will continue to use them.
723409440037212160 2016-04-22 07:13:45 UTC <LewisC919> If I get sick riding in the back seat, what's this gonna do to me? Still, never been so excited to maybe hurl. pic.twitter.com/YOYhPRbR9X
723404345023168513 2016-04-21 06:53:30 UTC <LewisC919> @OldNorthWaveMan good job man.
723369268432113666 2016-04-21 04:34:07 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 Victoria's Secret Models.
723357606627045376 2016-04-21 03:47:47 UTC <LewisC919> @KyleFromTexas Well, at least you'll rest well. Haha. Night man.
723356941867577344 2016-04-21 03:45:08 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht Ah, my bad. Sounds like the show was based on it. Marcia Gay Harden is great in it.
723356461686870016 2016-04-21 03:43:14 UTC <LewisC919> @mpv1123 Dude that's bad juju. Better double wrap for the foreseeable future. Haha.
723356025382903808 2016-04-21 03:41:30 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht I really liked it. Too bad CBS probably won't renew. If you're talking about the TV show...
723344008823582721 2016-04-21 02:53:45 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnDylanJessup truth.
723327999693692929 2016-04-21 01:50:08 UTC <LewisC919> @ski0331USMC glad to hear man.
723322971121704960 2016-04-21 01:30:09 UTC <LewisC919> @BaileyLeonardIV lmao.
723303590467649536 2016-04-21 00:13:08 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht father is on # 3.
723297837715480576 2016-04-21 23:50:17 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys Luckily, some teachers/staff knew they were slackers but good for it and let us borrow.
723297599671939072 2016-04-21 23:49:20 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys Yeah. Folks had the money but that didn't mean they had it on them or rem to give it to us.
723294277611216896 2016-04-21 23:36:08 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys Ask if your county is aware or qualifies going forward.pic.twitter.com/zJdaxFzqa4
723292512870387712 2016-04-21 23:29:07 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys nephews' school has a high enough % of SNAP students so that everyone eats for free. Some kind of grant...
723251811822481408 2016-04-21 20:47:23 UTC <LewisC919> @fierce_mountain I dunno. Never listened to his stuff. He was a symbol when I was a teenager. 
723235513692487681 2016-04-21 19:42:38 UTC <LewisC919> @AppFlyer little man now.
723235223106904066 2016-04-21 19:41:28 UTC <LewisC919> @thejackdog Haha.
723234865416544256 2016-04-21 19:40:03 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 What in the world?! Lol.
723200200454627333 2016-04-21 17:22:18 UTC <LewisC919> @Neal_Inman Not my cup of tea. Surprised he was my parent's age. If he was more your gparents' age, please don't tell me. Lol.
723196741420498944 2016-04-21 17:08:34 UTC <LewisC919> He was my parent's age. Wouldn't have thought that.
723109900482674689 2016-04-21 11:23:29 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 lololol.
723023052943048704 2016-04-20 05:38:23 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime 
722993865842655232 2016-04-20 03:42:24 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry good job man.
722993582035095552 2016-04-20 03:41:17 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 I dunno. Makes me think of the doilies my grandma had on all her tables. Lol
722951156637569024 2016-04-20 00:52:42 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus Sweet. Laugh at people all excited about refunds. Their money and they let Uncle Sam borrow it interest free...
722948426497953792 2016-04-20 00:41:51 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime We add gas just for the lulz in my family. Wooooosh and it's gone. Haha.
722942115056115713 2016-04-20 00:16:46 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Wait, y'all don't backyard burn them up there? 
722934696083111936 2016-04-20 23:47:17 UTC <LewisC919> @DicksTrash Why not T? He'll be impeached/removed within a year.  VP choice is significant for once.
722933022945845248 2016-04-20 23:40:38 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry I'm more of a make new monuments/tributes mindset. The whole doomed to repeat mistakes thing...
722931801275150340 2016-04-20 23:35:47 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry I could be good at that. You know I'm a fountain of mostly useless retained info. Ha. Especially TV/movie stuff.
722929820292747266 2016-04-20 23:27:55 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry Just random trivia or a specific subject?
722929294763302913 2016-04-20 23:25:49 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry I don't disagree but the why is of significance. Strictly an honor thing or trying to banish Jackson for "unsavory" history?
722918709128376321 2016-04-20 22:43:46 UTC <LewisC919> @Doc_Mackey Oh man. Yikes.
722917785068781568 2016-04-20 22:40:05 UTC <LewisC919> @Doc_Mackey what happened?
722888969600376834 2016-04-20 20:45:35 UTC <LewisC919> @KyleFromTexas nice.
722888650007031808 2016-04-20 20:44:19 UTC <LewisC919> @Sandra_Woy good thoughts your way.
722879380331110400 2016-04-20 20:07:29 UTC <LewisC919> @LastCastAngling halfway between @ItsAJoshParty & @ritchydoesit is my neck of the woods. @Caleb_Lanham13
722876653114888192 2016-04-20 19:56:39 UTC <LewisC919> @ScattyLight good deal.
722756454290190336 2016-04-20 11:59:01 UTC <LewisC919> @Doc_Mackey Sorry that happened man. Hope you feel better isn't the right expression here but hope you get what I mean.
722686417504235520 2016-04-20 07:20:43 UTC <LewisC919> @LastCastAngling That's cool. Safe travels man. Doing okay here, thanks.
722685123343314945 2016-04-20 07:15:34 UTC <LewisC919> @LastCastAngling Usually a safe bet. Haha. How are you?
722684127787544576 2016-04-20 07:11:37 UTC <LewisC919> @LastCastAngling good morning.

722612752292921344 2016-04-19 02:28:00 UTC <LewisC919> @GunConTroll2A Will have to buy dinner first. At a minimum. Lol.
722579075102076929 2016-04-19 00:14:11 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill It's the same thing with the D man whining about delegates. Plan ahead, folks...
722577196074868736 2016-04-19 00:06:43 UTC <LewisC919> @redcarolina nice.

722328459150761985 2016-04-19 07:38:19 UTC <LewisC919> And the hits keep coming.
722311240349974528 2016-04-18 06:29:54 UTC <LewisC919> @JNB_USA_ little packages of molten rock.
722310950326575105 2016-04-18 06:28:45 UTC <LewisC919> @mpv1123 what's wrong?
722274539896455168 2016-04-18 04:04:04 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnDylanJessup Was gonna ask what's going on. Luckily, I remembered to check Google to see if it's lyrics first. Haha.
722273872570134529 2016-04-18 04:01:25 UTC <LewisC919> @ItsAJoshParty good night.
722265051613249536 2016-04-18 03:26:21 UTC <LewisC919> @themarriedmess makes me think of the ladies and their AC units in Father of the Bride 2. 
722262480085458945 2016-04-18 03:16:08 UTC <LewisC919> @Jackie0351 
722248321948061696 2016-04-18 02:19:53 UTC <LewisC919> @DanLamothe Looked it up. Canceling in D city, in a D district, already rep'd by Ds in the legislature. That'll learn those Republicans. 
722246350931390465 2016-04-18 02:12:03 UTC <LewisC919> @DanLamothe what city was the concert supposed to be in?

722192809105600512 2016-04-18 22:39:18 UTC <LewisC919> @redcarolina That's great man. Stuff does work out sometimes.
722165402495680512 2016-04-18 20:50:23 UTC <LewisC919> @themarriedmess my mom still complains about her stifling summer pregnancy w/my sister. 31 + years later.
722135500295770113 2016-04-18 18:51:34 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox I kinda thought they never had anything to do with bathrooms. Mostly fine or not fine dissenters.
722040101182771201 2016-04-18 12:32:29 UTC <LewisC919> @thedesertape Petticoat Junction. All the girl's middles names were Jo. Classic TV junkie.
722038249326321665 2016-04-18 12:25:08 UTC <LewisC919> @thedesertape I felt sure someone here or Facebook would get a kick out of the Bradley reference. 
721999863152537600 2016-04-18 09:52:36 UTC <LewisC919> @scottckinder Oh, I wasn't knocking you for passing it along. More blast from the past whoa. 
721982141882638336 2016-04-18 08:42:11 UTC <LewisC919> @scottckinder I can't even rem the last time I used that.

721897741429915648 2016-04-17 03:06:48 UTC <LewisC919> @Montel_Williams Not common but I've read articles where HOwner's have shot police and it ruled justified. Intent and entry circumstances...
721880569190227972 2016-04-17 01:58:34 UTC <LewisC919> @DevinRuic Love it.
721868697669922816 2016-04-17 01:11:23 UTC <LewisC919> @dcexaminer I'd imagine their human significant others were doing some ---- blocking. Lmao. @TimTakesTime

721505102826250240 2016-04-16 01:06:36 UTC <LewisC919> @SSgt93 better add money to the food budget. Then even more when he starts bringing buddies home a lot. Haha.

721472291683569665 2016-04-16 22:56:13 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 Cool. I usually stick with the cheap Wally World ones. Break or lose 'em too often. Ha.

720236633904312320 2016-04-13 13:06:09 UTC <LewisC919> @NCCapitol Well, that's a little mundane. I was expecting some bombshell announcement. Ha.
720235855001083904 2016-04-13 13:03:03 UTC <LewisC919> @KyleFromTexas Couple weeks ago Wal-Mart self checkout asked if 18 for Nyquil. Cashier asked. Uh, 17 years ago lady. Lol.
720233373248155648 2016-04-13 12:53:12 UTC <LewisC919> @KyleFromTexas Opposite problem. 35 look 20ish? I got carded for lotto tickets up until 2 years ago.

720226031878213632 2016-04-13 12:24:01 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht ditto.
720200784449773568 2016-04-13 10:43:42 UTC <LewisC919> @seamussaid I mean, there's no one for urban residents to take it out on. They're already represented by Ds.
720200324661800960 2016-04-13 10:41:52 UTC <LewisC919> @seamussaid Backlash will be ineffective. Opponents are carpet bombing Ds and D districts in the hopes that secondary effects hurt the GOP.
720199959908364288 2016-04-13 10:40:25 UTC <LewisC919> @seamussaid Whole thing is fine/no fine. The only aim. Charlotte wanted to destroy dissent w/fines. NC Legislature to prevent.
720198819053445121 2016-04-13 10:35:53 UTC <LewisC919> @seamussaid And, restrictions without an enforcement mechanism or penalties aren't worth the paper they're printed on.
720198079182467072 2016-04-13 10:32:57 UTC <LewisC919> @seamussaid He's not relevant. With a supermajority, Governor is a figurehead at best.

719933132384968706 2016-04-12 17:00:09 UTC <LewisC919> @CecilyKeating It would've been veto proof without any D sup. Maybe it's the only "punishment" available. Bad targeting. @OutNmbrdByBoys
719932577616949248 2016-04-12 16:57:56 UTC <LewisC919> @CecilyKeating Opponents are carpet bombing Ds/D dist. in the hopes 2nd/3rd order effects hurt Rs. Questioning tactics... @OutNmbrdByBoys
719925863454752773 2016-04-12 16:31:16 UTC <LewisC919> @CecilyKeating less so if they're occurring in D districts. So far, job losses/boycotting are strictly in D territory. @OutNmbrdByBoys

719645286914727936 2016-04-11 21:56:21 UTC <LewisC919> @Jackie0351 Something going on here, too. Authorities are trying to figure out if it's extra potent or tainted.
719642589922791425 2016-04-11 21:45:38 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys *out on.
719642397160906752 2016-04-11 21:44:52 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys and there's no one for them to take it on. They were never going to vote GOP. It hurts HB2 opponents more than supporters.
719642096047636482 2016-04-11 21:43:40 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys Oh, you're right. It's just hitting the cities more than the state. Canceled Allstar game will cost Charlotte $100 million +
719630704519286788 2016-04-11 20:58:24 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys McCrory couldn't have prevented this being enacted. It was well beyond the votes needed to override a veto.
719630378470883328 2016-04-11 20:57:06 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys Who are Democrats in Democrat dominated districts going to vote out as punishment? Already repd by Ds.
719629275058544641 2016-04-11 20:52:43 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys Democrat dominated cities are being/going to be hit the hardest with lost hotel/restaurant tax revenue. Ineffective...
719628770949361664 2016-04-11 20:50:43 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys The boycotting thing is bizarre. The people being punished the most are the ones who prob agree with those boycotting.

719391845491597312 2016-04-10 05:09:16 UTC <LewisC919> @BigCountry1510 I had to get one of those claw grabbers for pinecones. Saves my back and legs from squatting.

719311287449219072 2016-04-10 23:49:09 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J Think it's fake. Address should just be .com Local media isn't blowing this up, either.

719300344434569218 2016-04-10 23:05:40 UTC <LewisC919> @heylookitskev Did you get the toys cleaned up? Looked like a toy tornado blew through there on that periscope vid. Haha.
719297875864383488 2016-04-10 22:55:52 UTC <LewisC919> @AppFlyer Haha. Thought crossed my mind, too.
719256040047525888 2016-04-10 20:09:37 UTC <LewisC919> @ski0331USMC same. Ice cream makes me feel like I'm gonna explode. Never quitting it, tho.
719251829498974209 2016-04-10 19:52:53 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry You're back at it. All is right with the twittersphere again.

719000456685621248 2016-04-09 03:14:01 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J @bob_owens @PayPal and the others are primarily hurting Democrat dominated cities with this. Guess that'll learn the GOP. 
718999121709895680 2016-04-09 03:08:43 UTC <LewisC919> @redcarolina  I look like a two tone car with one. Haha.

718971434467463172 2016-04-09 01:18:42 UTC <LewisC919> @JimLaPorta Given that NC doesn't have home rule, Charlotte shouldn't have started a fight they were always going to lose. My 2.
718970906429796356 2016-04-09 01:16:36 UTC <LewisC919> @JimLaPorta McCrory is minor player, too. Figurehead only. Bill had well beyond the votes needed to override. Enacted regardless.
718970498542084096 2016-04-09 01:14:59 UTC <LewisC919> @JimLaPorta It's an interesting situation. It's the Democrat dominated cities that are being punished and losing money, tho.

718744441935282178 2016-04-09 10:16:43 UTC <LewisC919> @seamussaid On 2 fronts. Guaranteed overturning and they'll watch their coffers drain due to missed hotel/restaurant tax revenue.
718743962194980864 2016-04-09 10:14:48 UTC <LewisC919> @seamussaid Or, a foolish local body can do the convincing for them like Charlotte did. NC doesn't have home. Stupid move by Charlotte.
718743484329541632 2016-04-09 10:12:54 UTC <LewisC919> @seamussaid Don't need to change everyone's mind. Just the minimum to get their legislators/governor to pass a bill.

716807599459602432 2016-04-03 02:00:24 UTC <LewisC919> @Russ_Crawford you gonna give up meat for her? 
716792164605366274 2016-04-03 00:59:04 UTC <LewisC919> @BigCountry1510 good deal man.
716772147205652480 2016-04-03 23:39:31 UTC <LewisC919> @DryHuskerFrog That coach is creepy. Haha.

716760536503943168 2016-04-03 22:53:23 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos Is this you when you let a lady drive outlaw? Well, if you actually let one drive it. Haha.pic.twitter.com/kyCwMPYExO
716758005275090945 2016-04-03 22:43:19 UTC <LewisC919> @pptsapper had a couple Tryphena ancestors in the 18th century. Massachusetts family.
716755853035089920 2016-04-03 22:34:46 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 On my knees, you can hear creaking sounds reverberate through the floor boards. It's bizarre. Need some wd40. Ha.
716753894794207232 2016-04-03 22:26:59 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht jealous.
716735710343086080 2016-04-03 21:14:44 UTC <LewisC919> @MontanaGent Tell 'em you got the diabeetus and gluten/peanut/egg/dairy allergies.
716707313424416769 2016-04-03 19:21:53 UTC <LewisC919> @joshhobson I can ring myself and 90 items up at self checkout in less than 10. Get stuffed bagged right, too. Haha.
716701822547845122 2016-04-03 19:00:04 UTC <LewisC919> @joshhobson check and coupons? Lol.
716679554123841538 2016-04-03 17:31:35 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos So, you're inside all the Deere mowers?
716678189997801472 2016-04-03 17:26:10 UTC <LewisC919> @KMat21 Granddaddy always said don't deal with underlings. Go straight to the top. Haha.
716515566882844672 2016-04-02 06:39:58 UTC <LewisC919> Terrible night. And just the beginning. Ugh.
716505365395935232 2016-04-02 05:59:25 UTC <LewisC919> @mpv1123 hey.
716503035971837952 2016-04-02 05:50:10 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos Haha. I hear ya bro.
716501885943955456 2016-04-02 05:45:36 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos That's pretty cool.
716499332367839232 2016-04-02 05:35:27 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos Yeah, I remember that engine description in the latter ones. I never complained about "driving Miss Daisy" all over. Haha.
716498108058836994 2016-04-02 05:30:35 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos I loved grandma's Sedan de Villes. She upgraded every 2 years. 1990-98. Fast and like a tank. Haha.
716496828083150848 2016-04-02 05:25:30 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos Very nice.
716489184437993472 2016-04-02 04:55:07 UTC <LewisC919> @Montel_Williams If they want that right, they need to elect new legislators and amend our NC Constitution.
716489102430969856 2016-04-02 04:54:48 UTC <LewisC919> @Montel_Williams My complaint is technical. Local body doesn't have authority to exceed the legislature's wishes in NC.
716487719770308610 2016-04-02 04:49:18 UTC <LewisC919> @Montel_Williams For what it's worth, I wish they had just passed a one line bill repealing the ordinance.
716487106865078272 2016-04-02 04:46:52 UTC <LewisC919> @Montel_Williams They'd have a session to reverse a nonexistent ordinance? No home rule means just that. All local bodies are subordinate.
716485648853704704 2016-04-02 04:41:05 UTC <LewisC919> @Montel_Williams No ordinance, no special session.
716485594810023937 2016-04-02 04:40:52 UTC <LewisC919> @Montel_Williams Seeing as NC doesn't have home rule, we'd all be better off had Charlotte heeded the legislature's warnings.
716484556447215616 2016-04-02 04:36:44 UTC <LewisC919> @StaleLuvMuffin Give me a holler if you ever come to the eastern part of the state. I'll by ya a meal.

716442018298404865 2016-04-02 01:47:42 UTC <LewisC919> @StaleLuvMuffin Well, less snow and cold but more hurricanes. Haha. Where ya moving to?

716219348134862848 2016-04-02 11:02:53 UTC <LewisC919> @ItsAJoshParty forgot the link. Dammit.https://twitter.com/MOlewiscarroll/status/716041039522488321
716219192165404673 2016-04-02 11:02:16 UTC <LewisC919> @ItsAJoshParty You didn't invite her over, did you? Lol.
716201586893144064 2016-04-02 09:52:19 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit 9 year old nephew has been singing wrecking ball all week. Poorly singing. No clue where he heard it.
716177629309698048 2016-04-02 08:17:07 UTC <LewisC919> @SSgtKRich beautiful.
716112507157479425 2016-04-01 03:58:21 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnDylanJessup you have some fun w/that bonus?
716106353496956928 2016-04-01 03:33:53 UTC <LewisC919> @WalkerJoe83 Boring is an understatement. My mom and grandma had me watching Y&R, Falcon Crest, & Dallas by that age. Haha.
716099787163099136 2016-04-01 03:07:48 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 now I'm worried. Have one of those VR headsets on the way. I'm probably gonna toss my cookies. Haha.
716097442001862656 2016-04-01 02:58:29 UTC <LewisC919> @EricBandazewski POTUS could tell everyone to not pay their taxes or a set amount. Then, pardon them for it. Executive discretion... 
716093728398700545 2016-04-01 02:43:43 UTC <LewisC919> @Jackie0351 Thankfully, he grew into it. Haha.
716093660065087488 2016-04-01 02:43:27 UTC <LewisC919> @Jackie0351 the worst is when they think their homely babies look great. Nephew had a giant head and we admitted/joked about it.
716093027371106304 2016-04-01 02:40:56 UTC <LewisC919> @redcarolina That's great. Still sending good thoughts.
716092193010806784 2016-04-01 02:37:37 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime articulate why the bathroom thing bothered me. This is as close to my feelings as I've seen.pic.twitter.com/JuSq2DQ99H
716091876823154688 2016-04-01 02:36:22 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime hope we're good after the disagreement about the bathroom/home rule thing. Not interested in rehashing but I hate I couldn't
716090636173225984 2016-04-01 02:31:26 UTC <LewisC919> @redcarolina It's all about building up to years of subsequent movies.

716041039522488321 2016-04-01 23:14:21 UTC <LewisC919> @ItsAJoshParty Sounds like a few steps from kleptomania. Ha.
716010645452414976 2016-04-01 21:13:35 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 Well, I'm a dumbass. I thought it was some urban dictionary ref. Haha.
716009262095405056 2016-04-01 21:08:05 UTC <LewisC919> @MrGreenGenez proceed.
716009020998479872 2016-04-01 21:07:08 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 tell the old guy what that expression means? Lol.
716008314476359681 2016-04-01 21:04:19 UTC <LewisC919> @DunsScottus really? Can't ever remember that happening.
715986631329755136 2016-04-01 19:38:09 UTC <LewisC919> @JoMadLong I always get asked about that one. "No, there's no connection." Haha.

715663245152034816 2016-03-31 22:13:08 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos it could be. Mom said they had that one and a blue one before she met my father.
715662736047398916 2016-03-31 22:11:07 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 guess I'm safe. No one has called me a kid since before you were born. Haha.

715411603882119168 2016-03-30 05:33:12 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnFenoglio @JOHNFENOGLIO The media should start sharing. If you report on issues/candidates that y'all vote for, it should be like a disclosure.

715106052413472768 2016-03-30 09:19:03 UTC <LewisC919> @Kudzu81 Sounds fun. Random or do you get to pick and choose? 
715061630980268032 2016-03-29 06:22:32 UTC <LewisC919> @Russ_Crawford Ruh-ro.
715045903833415686 2016-03-29 05:20:03 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Kind of my point. Opponents should want them in session as little as possible. Charlotte's move...baffling. @LastCastAngling
715041705406423040 2016-03-29 05:03:22 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Isn't that already federally prohibited? That would supercede any language about it at the state level. @LastCastAngling
715038041010782209 2016-03-29 04:48:48 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Prior status quo may not have been perfect but it was preferable to now. @LastCastAngling

715034564767453186 2016-03-29 04:34:59 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime temper tantrum may be an apt description. Anticipated. Why on earth give them the impetus? No foresight.  @LastCastAngling
715033152125865984 2016-03-29 04:29:22 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime overseers but absent an amendment, they're not in charge. @LastCastAngling

715032709907742720 2016-03-29 04:27:37 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime They held a gun to their own head. No home rule. It's not their right to exceed General Assembly's wishes. @LastCastAngling
715029809546530816 2016-03-29 04:16:05 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Assembly. They stuck an economic gun to their head to make a point that never even took effect. Smart. @LastCastAngling
715029666663411713 2016-03-29 04:15:31 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Something Charlotte should've taken into acct before picking this fight. They're subordinate to the General @LastCastAngling
715014890021371905 2016-03-29 03:16:48 UTC <LewisC919> @Nate_Taylor holy shit.
715007234946834432 2016-03-29 02:46:23 UTC <LewisC919> @ItsAJoshParty I was good after 2 hours. Before that, crying and laughing hysterically. At the same time. Valium IV ain't no joke.
714994310438060032 2016-03-29 01:55:02 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 Haha.
714988769913540608 2016-03-29 01:33:01 UTC <LewisC919> @redcarolina That's great man. Good thoughts your way.
714984594093813760 2016-03-29 01:16:25 UTC <LewisC919> @ItsAJoshParty Gotcha. Hope everything goes smoothly man. I went back to school and ate shrimp for supper after mine. I'm odd, though. Lol.
714983175416594432 2016-03-29 01:10:47 UTC <LewisC919> @ItsAJoshParty You have someone getting you there and back, right?
714973869665288193 2016-03-29 00:33:48 UTC <LewisC919> @HAULINBASS25 Yeah, more accurate. Lol. I tell the nephews the cones are pine poop. Had 20 wheelbarrows after this winter.
714973516328779776 2016-03-29 00:32:24 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus lucky pup. Y'all are good people.
714973324384854016 2016-03-29 00:31:38 UTC <LewisC919> @HAULINBASS25 Pines make great sunset pics. Their pinecone excrement, not so nice. Lol. I'm about 70 miles east of ya.
714972509268013056 2016-03-29 00:28:24 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry The inspection, tax, & tag renewal triple punch hurts. They used to could be separate.
714971769787006977 2016-03-29 00:25:28 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos Have a safe trip bro.
714890995490422784 2016-03-29 19:04:30 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 Pass. I'll be picking it out of my teeth for hours. Lol.
714887631725789185 2016-03-29 18:51:08 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys would've been for Charlotte to not have teed this up to begin with. No home rule in NC. What was the point?
714887385545318401 2016-03-29 18:50:09 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys Not sure giving the governor ownership of it is correct either. A veto override would've be certain. The smartest move
714886429512495108 2016-03-29 18:46:21 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys Nothing new there. Governor and General Assembly have been hiring outside counsel to defend their measures for many years.
714847018179502080 2016-03-29 16:09:45 UTC <LewisC919> @BrianFox46 ornery little fellow? Ha.
714846073873891328 2016-03-29 16:05:59 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit definitely worth the diabeetus. 
714844493007220737 2016-03-29 15:59:42 UTC <LewisC919> @Jackie0351 How cool of last name is Hefty?! Haha.
714842260098138113 2016-03-29 15:50:50 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry Same for beach house property tax/home owners due times. Cranky grandma.
714841464191258625 2016-03-29 15:47:40 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry This is the time of year we'd steer clear of grandma. Word usually came down that estimated payments were insufficient.
714761396563668992 2016-03-29 10:29:31 UTC <LewisC919> @979mscott mornin'.
714742610024407041 2016-03-29 09:14:52 UTC <LewisC919> @scottckinder what's going on?
714707793366937602 2016-03-28 06:56:31 UTC <LewisC919> @TLCplMax Sounds crowded. Folks usually have to remodel if they have more than two. 
714702969363636224 2016-03-28 06:37:21 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 grandpa? Lol.
714658291075391488 2016-03-28 03:39:48 UTC <LewisC919> @Nate_Taylor Lewis concurs.
714658076360572932 2016-03-28 03:38:57 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 Haha.
714647951616962560 2016-03-28 02:58:43 UTC <LewisC919> @StaleLuvMuffin the worst.
714644942870675462 2016-03-28 02:46:46 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit 
714636746479243264 2016-03-28 02:14:12 UTC <LewisC919> @ItsAJoshParty There's always doubling over and mumbling something about female problems...  @missouri_belle
714630135585050624 2016-03-28 01:47:56 UTC <LewisC919> @JMAC1775 yYeah man. I'm trying to think if I know anyone who has it to ask, too.
714629155296583684 2016-03-28 01:44:02 UTC <LewisC919> @Michael_Goggans Yep. Haha.
714622306216181761 2016-03-28 01:16:49 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos Nah it was old then. I'd guess 70s or 80s.
714591247504117761 2016-03-28 23:13:24 UTC <LewisC919> @Neal_Inman I emailed Elizabeth Dole a decade ago. Now everybody & their mama message me. Lol. @tedcruz @marcorubio
714590967517552640 2016-03-28 23:12:17 UTC <LewisC919> @979mscott yes.
714577768722227200 2016-03-28 22:19:50 UTC <LewisC919> @tonyidigmusic ditto.
714573499671511040 2016-03-28 22:02:53 UTC <LewisC919> @MattPwnz say what?!
714488142179524608 2016-03-28 16:23:42 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos been a little more comfortable if I knew him longer. I grew up riding w/my grandparents. I'm used to slow and easy. Haha.
714481224488759297 2016-03-28 15:56:12 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos I knew the son less than an hour. Like I said, unexpected. Lol.
714480735596462081 2016-03-28 15:54:16 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos It's was an old Corvette. This was 2004. My gma's second cousin told his son to take me for a drive.
714477785620881408 2016-03-28 15:42:33 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos I didn't let on I was scared. It wasn't just flooring. He was going way over the speed limit. It was unexpected. Lol.
714470086334148609 2016-03-28 15:11:57 UTC <LewisC919> @dap1510 Tweet ya later. Good luck.
714469310668914690 2016-03-28 15:08:52 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos relative did that to me in his old Corvette. I probably left grip marks. Haha.
714350704777891841 2016-03-28 07:17:34 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Wally World. These are great. As good as the local restaurant/cheaper. 10 mins in the toaster oven.pic.twitter.com/Hb9GPPRJwo
714349764230443008 2016-03-28 07:13:50 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime stop them from redrawing Wake Co districts or de-annexing parts of Fayetteville/Goldsboro.
714349682508623872 2016-03-28 07:13:30 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Think the max would be throwing out the bathroom part. Not having home rule, Legislature can override local law. Courts didn't
714347627589083137 2016-03-28 07:05:21 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime egg rolls here.
714332224523542528 2016-03-27 06:04:08 UTC <LewisC919> @mpv1123 good night.
714314086524260353 2016-03-27 04:52:04 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos That's good.
714311731993001984 2016-03-27 04:42:42 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos Just a funny slip of the tongue bro. Embarrassing but probably endearing to the other party.
714306885617377280 2016-03-27 04:23:27 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos Bro... Haha.
714301503771648000 2016-03-27 04:02:04 UTC <LewisC919> @Russ_Crawford Go to a public restroom for the birth. No sense in messing up the plumbing at home. Haha.
714278722833092608 2016-03-27 02:31:32 UTC <LewisC919> @TomCAmenta I'm sure keeping Congress (when it inevitably changed parties) out of her emails was in the back of someone's head, too.

714223480900816899 2016-03-27 22:52:02 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Winter's pinecones waited until the day of the first mowing for pickup. Why bother? 20 wheelbarrows worth. Haha.
714222931094740992 2016-03-27 22:49:51 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Wiping can be one of the exceptions. Haha. I mostly live by that line of thinking.
714220580099256320 2016-03-27 22:40:30 UTC <LewisC919> And, no, I don't do plating/presentation. All ends up in the potty regardless.

713229873674850304 2016-03-24 05:03:47 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnDylanJessup ain't that the truth.
713219406948659200 2016-03-24 04:22:12 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime My orig. point. Charlotte made things worse for no reason. It was stupid to tee this up to begin with. Never any upside.
713217898995662848 2016-03-24 04:16:12 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J Good lord. I'm burning slam up. Air and fans. Lol.
713217298027384832 2016-03-24 04:13:49 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Just make us some "close-minded bigot men/ladies rooms". We'll gladly be take the "discrimination." Lol.
713217216355897344 2016-03-24 04:13:29 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Grandma used to say I'm not of my time. I guess that's why this bothers me and a lot of others. It just goes against deceny.
713216104299147265 2016-03-24 04:09:04 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Didn't say see. They should be able to know there aren't any men in there. Has dick = man.
713214218401685505 2016-03-24 04:01:35 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime We'll just have to disagree. Men should not be in there. Whether they think they are one or not. It's not appropriate.
713209454838226944 2016-03-24 03:42:39 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Ladies should have the right to no dick bathrooms. Dude switches to indoor plumbing, changes his birth certificate, go for it.
713208644268072960 2016-03-24 03:39:26 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime If I had nieces, I'd go in the ladies room and get them if an obvious male went in there. It's not appropriate.

713188830405398528 2016-03-24 02:20:42 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime The whole episode is eye roll worthy. None of it needed to happen. Adding the bathroom thing took it nuclear.
713187917007601670 2016-03-24 02:17:04 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime If you pick off 30% of the other side of the aisle, it's bipartisan. How the term is used recently anyway.

713174180380979201 2016-03-24 01:22:29 UTC <LewisC919> @Jackie0351 Hopefully he'll be asleep soon. Lol.
713169499051147264 2016-03-24 01:03:53 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime why did Charlotte proceed knowing they'd be reversed? Lit a fire and are now complaining it burned down the forest.
713169193886162944 2016-03-24 01:02:40 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Town/City/County commission's powers are entirely derived from what the legislature gives them. If this is an embarrassment,
713168874699669504 2016-03-24 01:01:24 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime The bill didn't even do anything. Just said current state law is THE statewide law. NC doesn't have home rule.
713167694217023493 2016-03-24 00:56:42 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Senate Ds didn't walk out because of the bill's contents, either. They were pissed that they were cut out of the process.
713167130037002241 2016-03-24 00:54:28 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime if 11 Ds from heavily gerrymandered district broke ranks, would indicate some level of popular support.
713165290641735681 2016-03-24 00:47:09 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime "Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002" only had 11 R Senate ayes out of 48. Making it up as they go, too? No gerrymandering.
713163190021001216 2016-03-24 00:38:49 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime 11 did. Not a token one or two. 30% of House Ds present voted for it. I think bipartisan is an appropriate description.
713160685543415808 2016-03-24 00:28:51 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Didn't it get D votes in the lower house vote?

712858532534730753 2016-03-23 04:28:13 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos I bet. Those are nice.
712854201974521856 2016-03-23 04:11:00 UTC <LewisC919> @Nate_Taylor Wow. Think there's a resemblance. Just a little...
712837965534244866 2016-03-23 03:06:29 UTC <LewisC919> @Russ_Crawford Snapchat will be entertaining tomorrow. Lol.
712836860247019521 2016-03-23 03:02:06 UTC <LewisC919> NC doesn't have home rule. If a locality does anything the legislature's majority doesn't agree with, it's gonna be undone.
712834165121556480 2016-03-23 02:51:23 UTC <LewisC919> @mpv1123 noted. Lol.

712795524353490944 2016-03-23 00:17:50 UTC <LewisC919> @KMat21 Martha was a skank.

712470775547080704 2016-03-22 02:47:24 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox Read a few FB complaints of folks who wanted to vote for/against DT but forgot they were Jessecrats. Infrequent primary vtrs.
712469982546759680 2016-03-22 02:44:15 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox I wasn't complaining. My precinct is whole county one stop but obviously not on election day. Could've been that confusion.
712468663429758981 2016-03-22 02:39:01 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox heard multiple wrong precinct problems in the 20 it took me to vote.

712422993792618496 2016-03-22 23:37:32 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox There's no accomplishing that. We can't do it. It has to be the allegedly peace loving majority. They're not interested.
712421143160836098 2016-03-22 23:30:11 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox I dunno. Maybe it's not the religion but there some serious issues with too many people in that area of the world.
712417241166295041 2016-03-22 23:14:41 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit Go for it man. Enjoy.

711769663013654528 2016-03-20 04:21:26 UTC <LewisC919> @Render64 I dunno. I'm starting to think they abandoned the app. It'll probably stop working with the next big change.
711768347851927552 2016-03-20 04:16:12 UTC <LewisC919> @Render64 Tweetcaster still hasn't updated. Still have my stars.

710633032399454208 2016-03-17 01:04:52 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht This isn't gonna come out right... I'm glad y'all have more info and the docs are on the hunt for the cause.
710583249517551616 2016-03-17 21:47:03 UTC <LewisC919> @WalkerJoe83 oh man. Hope you can get some rest soon.

710520742819987457 2016-03-17 17:38:40 UTC <LewisC919> @PaulSzoldra Very happy the S7 brought back Expandable memory. 
710409537757384704 2016-03-17 10:16:47 UTC <LewisC919> @redcarolina good morning.

710277389197029380 2016-03-16 01:31:40 UTC <LewisC919> @Jackie0351 Was something chasing you? Otherwise, why? Lol.
710275366275776512 2016-03-16 01:23:38 UTC <LewisC919> @BKactual Saw a guy with huge upper chest one. Thought, that'll look great on some b cup man boobs in 30 years. Haha.
710274129425932288 2016-03-16 01:18:43 UTC <LewisC919> @LastCastAngling Need some pickles, swing by here. Okay, you can buy them at Walmart, too. Lol.
710273866124296192 2016-03-16 01:17:40 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht that kind of waiting sucks.
710265311363117056 2016-03-16 00:43:40 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 RIP Smoke's liver. Lol. Enjoy your time off man.

710206925288423425 2016-03-16 20:51:40 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Doing okay here. I guess. Lol.
710206825384321024 2016-03-16 20:51:16 UTC <LewisC919> @MaloneIfctv1 Trying to reconcile that with your bio. Support of her and 2A? How does that work?
710190277625942016 2016-03-16 19:45:31 UTC <LewisC919> @MaloneIfctv1 She was never mad. She a no self-esteem doormat who participates in/enables her own mistreatment. It's sad. @brithume
710138493863731200 2016-03-16 16:19:45 UTC <LewisC919> @eville_parole2 Yep. 
710036152204439552 2016-03-16 09:33:05 UTC <LewisC919> @mikenelson586 forward it to the younger ones? Lol.
710035190710665217 2016-03-16 09:29:15 UTC <LewisC919> The best way to help yourself is to put your arm around someone who needs it more than you do.
710034960569274368 2016-03-16 09:28:21 UTC <LewisC919> @MSgtCeeCee All good here, thanks. How about you & yours?
710033011287269381 2016-03-16 09:20:36 UTC <LewisC919> @MSgtCeeCee good morning.

710031003406893056 2016-03-16 09:12:37 UTC <LewisC919> @mikenelson586 Turnout was equal in NC despite Rs being at a disadvantage. Never had to wait in primary. Strange things are happening.
710030172678791168 2016-03-16 09:09:19 UTC <LewisC919> @mikenelson586 I dunno. Think we should be worried about the other possibility. She's boring and may not motivate supporters.
710020640795795456 2016-03-16 08:31:26 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime How are you doing man?
710008234531266560 2016-03-16 07:42:09 UTC <LewisC919> @seamussaid I hate you. Now I thought about the dying horse. Lol.
710006522391220225 2016-03-16 07:35:20 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnFenoglio @JOHNFENOGLIO Interesting dichotomy. African Americans are saving Hillary from Bernie.

709963973232336896 2016-03-15 04:46:16 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill Maybe we should be scared. If Hill dog and her lack of personality don't excite voters but the D man does?! 
709962944126316545 2016-03-15 04:42:11 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill Turnout in NC was interesting. Rs are at a registration disadvan., too. Never seen lines on primary day.pic.twitter.com/DxHoePpdap
709960964792328192 2016-03-15 04:34:19 UTC <LewisC919> @boomer_bass truth.
709955475735969793 2016-03-15 04:12:30 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus Example. NC is interesting, too. Still a lot of Jessicrats (Helms). Registered Ds but vote R.pic.twitter.com/i3LrbXzg2v
709954007205355521 2016-03-15 04:06:40 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox Think that would require a left and right third party candidate, though.
709953916335685636 2016-03-15 04:06:18 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox Ballot issues. Saw one outlandish proposal. Try and get on few ballots, enough to deny 270 and send it to the House.
709950084092448768 2016-03-15 03:51:04 UTC <LewisC919> @ScoutThrasher That or he's just a dirty old man. Perhaps a combination.  @KevinFarrell @brithume
709949632923586560 2016-03-15 03:49:17 UTC <LewisC919> @ScoutThrasher Think her husband actions would indicate otherwise. Something is lacking on multiple fronts.  @KevinFarrell @brithume
709945890685919233 2016-03-15 03:34:25 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos Priorities, right? Lol. Things good with you?

709937546906591234 2016-03-15 03:01:15 UTC <LewisC919> @donachaidh Not giving credit where credit is due. Left took him out in 13 w/the gang of 8 ploy. 3 years in advance. Brilliant move. My 2.
709936445163581440 2016-03-15 02:56:53 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus That's an interesting point. I've never had to wait in line for a primary vote before. Definitely draws voters.
709935812394127361 2016-03-15 02:54:22 UTC <LewisC919> @TommyDegnan How do you not have more followers? You're like a well hidden limitless info trove but totally in the open. 
709933574233792512 2016-03-15 02:45:28 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 you okay?

709903751063031809 2016-03-15 00:46:58 UTC <LewisC919> Just my 2. For the record, I think it was a terrible waste.
709903682523926530 2016-03-15 00:46:41 UTC <LewisC919> Rubio fell for the left's Gang of 8 trap. Saw him as a threat and they took him out in his own primary 3 years in advance. Brilliant.
709900914383925248 2016-03-15 00:35:41 UTC <LewisC919> @LauraWalkerKC No doubt Trump is a dick. (Little one .) Still... https://twitter.com/MOlewiscarroll/status/709892565437259776 I voted for Cruz today.
709893617289039872 2016-03-15 00:06:42 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J Such a waste. Especially given the poor prospects of House passage. He was done then. Probably the catalyst for Trump voters, too.
709892565437259776 2016-03-15 00:02:31 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J Rubio fell for the left's Gang of 8 trap. Saw him as a threat and they took him out in his own primary 3 years in advance. Brilliant.

708914786629582849 2016-03-12 07:17:10 UTC <LewisC919> @Michael_Goggans one of the greatest movie POTUS speeches.
708881448615354368 2016-03-12 05:04:42 UTC <LewisC919> @DaveMBP It was brilliant. Candidate most feared by Ds and he fell for the con. They took him out in his own primary 3 years in advance.
708880286587551744 2016-03-12 05:00:05 UTC <LewisC919> @DaveMBP it was dead from the beginning. I don't know why he hung it around his neck. Mortally wounded himself.
708878986768556032 2016-03-12 04:54:55 UTC <LewisC919> @DaveMBP Think we lost the general when MR signed on to gang of 8. Need to mitigate down ballot damage and get anyone but T on the ballot.
708877835453079552 2016-03-12 04:50:20 UTC <LewisC919> @DaveMBP I dunno. After K didn't return the "vote for someone else" favor for Florida, I think T rolls.
708876905068384257 2016-03-12 04:46:39 UTC <LewisC919> @DaveMBP So MR is at what, 4?
708876020556779520 2016-03-12 04:43:08 UTC <LewisC919> @DaveMBP Do DC & PR count as won "states" for the convention? Need a minimum of 8 to wage a floor flight.

708706277027749889 2016-03-12 17:28:38 UTC <LewisC919> @Neal_Inman Not inaccurate. He'd be presumptive nominee but for the gang of 8 crap. He, or his advisors, are idiots, too.
708573808274182144 2016-03-12 08:42:15 UTC <LewisC919> @ConnorPenn Well, you're not the only one who does that.

708361185821728768 2016-03-11 18:37:22 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry That's an Urkle worthy fall. Haha.
708348464971657216 2016-03-11 17:46:49 UTC <LewisC919> @redcarolina You'll find something.
708315212953202692 2016-03-11 15:34:41 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit Cool. Enjoy your day man.
708314567420424192 2016-03-11 15:32:07 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit It's not Sunday, so go for it. Would have to wait until 12 if it was, though.
708313747190730753 2016-03-11 15:28:51 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos Have a feeling that moron is gonna get a visit from the Secret Service...
708303297744994304 2016-03-11 14:47:20 UTC <LewisC919> @redcarolina Got lots of family in Rock Creek Cemetery. Not sure if it's really connected to the park.
708302140209373184 2016-03-11 14:42:44 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys Happy Birthday!
708301641905123328 2016-03-11 14:40:45 UTC <LewisC919> @jab2375 done.
708140023862796288 2016-03-10 03:58:32 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 the guy who did sure had a couple wild Vegas nights. 
708106760414896129 2016-03-10 01:46:22 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 Glad to hear that man.
708106431535259648 2016-03-10 01:45:03 UTC <LewisC919> @fierce_mountain sorry for your loss.
708091225736253440 2016-03-10 00:44:38 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 Nice.
708055914134183936 2016-03-10 22:24:19 UTC <LewisC919> @MrEarly30s what's wrong man?
708035665854910464 2016-03-10 21:03:52 UTC <LewisC919> @DevinRuic Scanned an invite President & Mrs. McKinley sent gg-gmother's brother. Several Presidents used him as veterinarian.
707953083247042560 2016-03-10 15:35:42 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht I had to get something and provide proof to start in 99.
707834351778553856 2016-03-09 07:43:55 UTC <LewisC919> @BaileyLeonardIV Hope you're doing well man.
707787039542915072 2016-03-09 04:35:54 UTC <LewisC919> @Russ_Crawford True.
707779433038540800 2016-03-09 04:05:41 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox She's never had any personality.
707779100149030912 2016-03-09 04:04:22 UTC <LewisC919> @ScattyLight I liked Carly. Seems Cruz is the only one even in contention to stop the D man. Dunno about the other side. Both bad, too.
707769416465842176 2016-03-09 03:25:53 UTC <LewisC919> @DuffySends human interaction is fraught with risks. Need the electronic buffer. Lol.
707768434902208512 2016-03-09 03:21:59 UTC <LewisC919> @redcarolina had a bad day here, too.
707768103711612928 2016-03-09 03:20:40 UTC <LewisC919> @redcarolina ditto.
707698333079506944 2016-03-09 22:43:25 UTC <LewisC919> @DaveMBP Oh man. I'm sorry you're having to go through all this stuff.
707654042609197056 2016-03-09 19:47:25 UTC <LewisC919> @WillReinier welcome home.
707600491820089344 2016-03-09 16:14:38 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 Nephew was younger he told a lady at the supermarket his name was Ray Don. What I used to call him. Mad sister.
707569037228658688 2016-03-09 14:09:39 UTC <LewisC919> @oifoefdevildawg Good morning.
707567428062973952 2016-03-09 14:03:15 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J Good thoughts your way.
707493170553065472 2016-03-09 09:08:11 UTC <LewisC919> @DaveMBP For what it's worth, I like R. He torpedoed himself with the gang of eight stuff. Wasn't the time if he wanted to run in '16.
707491067013103616 2016-03-09 08:59:49 UTC <LewisC919> @DaveMBP Died because blue voters breed often and indiscriminately. Reached critical mass despite Roe. Not PC but accurate.
707458544065449984 2016-03-08 06:50:35 UTC <LewisC919> @KMat21 Happy Birthday!
707253255810625537 2016-03-08 17:14:50 UTC <LewisC919> @DaveMBP Wasn't sugges. you support anyone specific. They added that rule to keep Ron Paul from a floor flight. Now, it's come back to bite.
707249415665287169 2016-03-08 16:59:35 UTC <LewisC919> @DaveMBP He may be the only alternative. Think you have to win 8 states to even be eligible for a convention fight.
707248327272697856 2016-03-08 16:55:15 UTC <LewisC919> @desertdan1 Welcome back man.
707067487188176897 2016-03-07 04:56:40 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos Haha.

707060107054436352 2016-03-07 04:27:20 UTC <LewisC919> @CleSoldier2011 Have a safe trip and a good time.
707057023775444992 2016-03-07 04:15:05 UTC <LewisC919> @BackwardNC I was nine. I was never able to vote for Jesse. @BrentWoodcox
707055430992732162 2016-03-07 04:08:45 UTC <LewisC919> @BackwardNC Y'all got vintage voting machines?  Makes me nostalgic for seeing mom pull the lever for Jesse in '90. @BrentWoodcox
707053456708673537 2016-03-07 04:00:55 UTC <LewisC919> @BackwardNC Sure it does. Just have a standalone commission vote raising the taxes on the new values. @NCGOP @BrentWoodcox
707049158826442756 2016-03-07 03:43:50 UTC <LewisC919> @BackwardNC Be honest about the intent or make reevaluation revenue neutral. @BrentWoodcox
707025221929213952 2016-03-07 02:08:43 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnDylanJessup what's going on man?
707016361591984128 2016-03-07 01:33:30 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox state resolution setting it at 10?

706947905349926912 2016-03-07 21:01:29 UTC <LewisC919> @EricBandazewski I hear ya man.
706943337144700928 2016-03-07 20:43:20 UTC <LewisC919> @EricBandazewski Yeah, but I think you have to win a minimum of eight states for a floor fight. Are there other prospects?
706684561657188352 2016-03-06 03:35:03 UTC <LewisC919> @JTCHAIRBORNECOM welcome back.

706650816833191936 2016-03-06 01:20:58 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 There's a ep of two & a half men where a disgruntled ex makes a website warning other chicks. Ruins his game. Lol.

706505036818358272 2016-03-06 15:41:41 UTC <LewisC919> @JamesWWeirick Interesting. The "lol" wasn't  directed at you. More that anybody would take that joker's words to heart. @Kudzu81 @NBCNews

706331870728814592 2016-03-05 04:13:35 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox I don't know what the answer is.
706326411800236032 2016-03-05 03:51:54 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox Just such a waste given its house prospects.
706326194061336576 2016-03-05 03:51:02 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox He was toast in 2013. I honestly wish someone would've stopped him from hanging that around his neck.

706226054315139073 2016-03-05 21:13:07 UTC <LewisC919> @MrJoshPerry Ridiculous. No one owes anyone anything. Someone, or their advisers, should've had this time in mind back in 2013. 
706224064516325377 2016-03-05 21:05:12 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J nephew, who I saw yesterday, currently has the stomach variety. I'm hoping for regular. Lol.

706177753486217216 2016-03-05 18:01:11 UTC <LewisC919> @HolmesJosh That's easy. He got some rotten advice re that gang of 8 crap. Absent that, presumptive nominee. @DaveMBP
706157308657553409 2016-03-05 16:39:56 UTC <LewisC919> @dap1510 He would be presumptive nominee but for hanging that shamnesty crap around his neck. Whomever advised him on that...

705075085313335296 2016-03-02 16:59:34 UTC <LewisC919> @WardrobeDoor Basically, a technical issue that needs further information/discussion/review. But, it means K is open to the possibility.
705074274009112576 2016-03-02 16:56:21 UTC <LewisC919> @WardrobeDoor They sometimes don't strike or uphold. Sent back for review means "Hey, you guys might have gotten something wrong."
705073706196819968 2016-03-02 16:54:05 UTC <LewisC919> @WardrobeDoor Not if a majority order the lower to review it. If Kennedy supports upholding, that tie would sustain it only in that circuit.

702529457651724288 2016-02-24 16:24:09 UTC <LewisC919> @thedesertape I mean, what's the difference who is in charge of indefinite detention w/out trial?
702528099271856128 2016-02-24 16:18:45 UTC <LewisC919> @thedesertape Did you see Earnest's statements yesterday? He indicated that wouldn't change for dozens of them even if CONUS.
702526639662460928 2016-02-24 16:12:57 UTC <LewisC919> @thedesertape Closing GITMO has or had. bipartisan opposition. Some of those funding bans passed during D control and with D votes.
702526258060496896 2016-02-24 16:11:26 UTC <LewisC919> @thedesertape Well, I kinda doubt he'll nominate anyone who can get 14 GOP supporters. He's not working with them, either.
702523838744014848 2016-02-24 16:01:50 UTC <LewisC919> @thedesertape Re GITMO, POTUS signed mult bills making US transfers illegal. He could've vetoed. He accepted the will (purse) of Congress.
702523254099947520 2016-02-24 15:59:30 UTC <LewisC919> @thedesertape Neither have a any chance of gaining the necessary votes to pass. Why bother with theater?

702517948653539328 2016-02-24 15:38:25 UTC <LewisC919> @JoMadLong All theater. Big hullabaloo over something that is sure to be reversed by a local bill from the General Assembly.
702489427554103297 2016-02-24 13:45:05 UTC <LewisC919> @HotfootHorton41 Sounds like a good plan to me. Mornin'.

702470623709102084 2016-02-24 12:30:22 UTC <LewisC919> @DevinRuic I meant outside. Would think the locals would be targets of lone wolf stuff.
702468698922053632 2016-02-24 12:22:43 UTC <LewisC919> @DevinRuic It's not that different from locals not wanting a nuclear/toxic waste dump in their backyards. Toxic people...
702468286928162816 2016-02-24 12:21:05 UTC <LewisC919> @DevinRuic I dunno. Who would it attract? No general access to where they are now. Would be cities/populations near them CONUS.
702467378144088064 2016-02-24 12:17:28 UTC <LewisC919> @jonathankappler poorly worded. That was my position to it. Also nervous. Local schools are dismissing at 11. Forecast must be bad.

702443239895392256 2016-02-24 10:41:33 UTC <LewisC919> Must be a scary forecast. Schools are having class but dismissing at 11am.

701952628628959233 2016-02-22 02:12:02 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox True. Seems the simple solution would be to switch to anatomy based restrooms. Even the kid in Kindergarten Cop got that. 
701949481835634688 2016-02-22 01:59:32 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox Gonna disagree. A lady should have the right to a weiner free bathroom. If it's that big of deal, .

701628343469232128 2016-02-21 04:43:27 UTC <LewisC919> @donachaidh She gonna run 'em over. 
701624777811693573 2016-02-21 04:29:17 UTC <LewisC919> @elvisknievil I guess if you're gonna by asphyxiation, might as well go big.

701422842487795712 2016-02-21 15:06:52 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 Well that's a win.
701289785768304641 2016-02-20 06:18:08 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 details, please. Lol.
701288563510411264 2016-02-20 06:13:17 UTC <LewisC919> @GolfSchott have money sitting in their actts. Looked it up. Debt interest is like $18 billion/month.
701288372766048256 2016-02-20 06:12:32 UTC <LewisC919> @GolfSchott They can pay campaign debt maybe transfer to a PAC or something. Not exactly take home pay. Lol. Many defunct campaigns still
701286719631421440 2016-02-20 06:05:57 UTC <LewisC919> @GolfSchott Don't think that would cover one month's interest payment on it. Probably only a fraction at that.
701280591241580545 2016-02-20 05:41:36 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos Yeah man. I was worried about ya.

701270787672535040 2016-02-20 05:02:39 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos poorly worded. Meant more are you okay?
701269144394575872 2016-02-20 04:56:07 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos What's going on man?

700533074279342080 2016-02-18 04:11:14 UTC <LewisC919> @DryHuskerFrog Rest well.
700506987214143490 2016-02-18 02:27:35 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 Will be pretty easy to accomplish if you make the move. 
700430647475752960 2016-02-18 21:24:14 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus Oh man.
700427521125318656 2016-02-18 21:11:49 UTC <LewisC919> @lamontto For me, it was seeing the UNC folks blaming Roy so harshly here & on Facebook last night/today. Wow.
700338630670229504 2016-02-18 15:18:35 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 I called the nephew Chuckie once. He thought I meant Rugrats. 
700220094182338560 2016-02-17 07:27:34 UTC <LewisC919> @mpv1123 good deal.
700174878549344256 2016-02-17 04:27:54 UTC <LewisC919> @AppFlyer I rem losing UNC match-ups even in the midst of 80/90s successes and not wanting to go school the next day. Lol. Awful ribbing.
700170841821220866 2016-02-17 04:11:51 UTC <LewisC919> @AppFlyer I'm kinda blindsided. The UNC folks on mine are bashing their own pretty heavy. Not something I've ever seen before.
700164703482441728 2016-02-17 03:47:28 UTC <LewisC919> @redcarolina face is gonna be cold. Lol.

700145488000106497 2016-02-17 02:31:07 UTC <LewisC919> @CHARLOTTES_OWN Hope things get better man.
700127279247020034 2016-02-17 01:18:45 UTC <LewisC919> @DuffySends Even his own party members have questioned him on that. Likes the job but won't do the personal relationship w/them. Standoffish
700119385843900416 2016-02-17 00:47:23 UTC <LewisC919> @Joel5326 You want swamps? We got a few in E NC. Ha.
700104246751010816 2016-02-17 23:47:14 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill Anyway, I thought you'd find it interesting given your other tweets about gerrymandering. I'll leave ya alone now. 
700103447870308352 2016-02-17 23:44:03 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill Not necessarily competitive but wanted to point that out.
700102745940856833 2016-02-17 23:41:16 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill Different approach. Not painless, either. New districts are less GOP than before. http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article60645276.html
700102015511191552 2016-02-17 23:38:22 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill Court says can't give race too much consideration. So, they gave it none. Just politics. More compact & less divided counties.
700097400384446464 2016-02-17 23:20:02 UTC <LewisC919> @jstogdill Unknown. Court ordered redraw on appeal to SCOTUS. Deadline for redraw is Fri. Spec Session called tomorrow, just in case.

699248908636200961 2016-02-15 15:08:25 UTC <LewisC919> @DuffySends Even so, that limits the potentials. Can't imagine a sitting judge or cabinet official wading into that environment.

699026326301372417 2016-02-14 00:23:58 UTC <LewisC919> @ChaseRiceMusic Turkey day babies? Hahaha.
699024505793093632 2016-02-14 00:16:44 UTC <LewisC919> @ritchydoesit Too cold to go out. Lol.
699004999024648194 2016-02-14 22:59:13 UTC <LewisC919> @FN_BOOT Lost mine in 98. Found out more about his service going through his stuff than he ever would talk about while he was alive, though.
698943718582308864 2016-02-14 18:55:42 UTC <LewisC919> @joshhobson Really? Valentine's baby sitters must be pricey. Lol.
698918972163489793 2016-02-14 17:17:22 UTC <LewisC919> Ruh-ro. As it's cold as F, Leesburg relative posted a selfie in a fur coat. Shit is about to hit the fan. pic.twitter.com/4TyFXUXzGZ
698917363010433024 2016-02-14 17:10:59 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos Good deal man. Happy Valentine's Day! pic.twitter.com/7RrhZiRdCn
698902148994764800 2016-02-14 16:10:31 UTC <LewisC919> @mikenelson586 I'll never get minorities pushing the gerrymandering thing. Less AA reps is okay for the possibility of more D reps. Weird.
698892308956241921 2016-02-14 15:31:25 UTC <LewisC919> She'd mail us the cards. From 5 miles away even though we'd probably see her. Never really thought about that before. Sad.
698891381448822784 2016-02-14 15:27:44 UTC <LewisC919> Terry Lee Taylor, aunt. 18 Sept 1946-13 Feb 1980pic.twitter.com/rxZuUrQSAt
698890917676244992 2016-02-14 15:25:54 UTC <LewisC919> Grandma always got us Valentine's cards. She didn't like the holiday, though. Daughter died the day before and was buried the day after.
698831051146293248 2016-02-14 11:28:00 UTC <LewisC919> @WickedSmaaaht Geez. Will try not to complain about 19. Mornin'.
698808315837616128 2016-02-14 09:57:40 UTC <LewisC919> @PhilDernerJr I'll try not to complain about 20 here. Geez. Stay warm man.
698807656438501376 2016-02-14 09:55:03 UTC <LewisC919> Glad the nephews had fun and didn't die. Seriously. That waiver is kinda scary... Lol.pic.twitter.com/niCQou1IJd
698804951275986944 2016-02-14 09:44:18 UTC <LewisC919> @donachaidh Funny considering this President was recently smacked down by a unanimous SCOTUS for trying to circumvent the Senate's a/c.
698793091877249024 2016-02-14 08:57:10 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 What?!
698757453392048128 2016-02-13 06:35:33 UTC <LewisC919> @Doc_Mackey Can help ya there brother. Got a N64 question, I'm your guy. Lol.
698753660684263424 2016-02-13 06:20:29 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos I'm sure the neighbors appreciate it, though. Lol.
698742673671331840 2016-02-13 05:36:50 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 If she ever tries to show you the Betty Broderick movies, be afraid. Be very afraid.
698739205225246720 2016-02-13 05:23:03 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 Not I. Clueless single guy suggestions... lololol.
698738791385849861 2016-02-13 05:21:24 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 Wally World might have something. Blender, crockpot... 
698718584768487425 2016-02-13 04:01:06 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime There's some kind of cheese spread grandma used to get that had that mixed in. Good in that instance.
698710315626790912 2016-02-13 03:28:15 UTC <LewisC919> @mrbigdubya O should of been a little more centrist and not lost the Senate. Elections have consequences...  @HillaryClinton
698709841464967169 2016-02-13 03:26:22 UTC <LewisC919> @polar_mcbear A romantic end, though. Not. 
698709573029523456 2016-02-13 03:25:18 UTC <LewisC919> @kevinbigley The chickens, not the chicks shopping for chickens. 
698709348185456645 2016-02-13 03:24:24 UTC <LewisC919> @kevinbigley We already have a standing date. Twice a week, actually. 
698706228965470208 2016-02-13 03:12:00 UTC <LewisC919> @LauraWalkerKC hey, hey. No such place. Don't lump me w/that South one. Lololol.
698702666076127233 2016-02-13 02:57:51 UTC <LewisC919> @Neal_Inman the state's share of expenses?
698702597058912257 2016-02-13 02:57:35 UTC <LewisC919> @Neal_Inman K is gonna have a mess on his hands shortly. Expanded M against legislature's wishes. What happens when they don't appropriate
698701583127879680 2016-02-13 02:53:33 UTC <LewisC919> @dap1510 is it true that if votes were taken/opinion writing assigned, those SCOTUS rulings still go forward?
698700551253573632 2016-02-13 02:49:27 UTC <LewisC919> @mikenelson586 Muck it up w/executive authority. Tell everyone to pay only a flat tax. Pardon all who do for not paying the req amount. 
698691249600118784 2016-02-13 02:12:29 UTC <LewisC919> @DuffySends left. It's not the gentleman's body it used to be. http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/269395-graham-new-supreme-court-nominee-must-be-a-consensus
698691180293464064 2016-02-13 02:12:13 UTC <LewisC919> @DuffySends I think if Reid hadn't done the nuclear option, it would've been more simple now. Are few/no "it's POTUS' prerogative" people
698687756801810440 2016-02-13 01:58:36 UTC <LewisC919> @NCCapitol @POTUS nominate someone? Sure. Needs significant GOP Senate support for an appointment.
698686908742893568 2016-02-13 01:55:14 UTC <LewisC919> @DuffySends O could do the unexpected and nominate someone Roberts-ish. Needs 14 GOP votes. Kinda doubt it, though.
698685948767277056 2016-02-13 01:51:25 UTC <LewisC919> @DuffySends they're gonna lose anyway. Probably Senate, too. Block or hedge for the most moderate possible.
698684264062312448 2016-02-13 01:44:44 UTC <LewisC919> @DuffySends Needs the votes to confirm. Not unprecedented, either. Delay/block for lame duck POTUS has happened 14 times.
698676717725024256 2016-02-13 01:14:44 UTC <LewisC919> @Radomysisky Could go circuit by circuit. Appeals court overturns and then upheld by a tie. Ruling then applies circuit wide.
698672413115097088 2016-02-13 00:57:38 UTC <LewisC919> @polar_mcbear Gotcha. Kind of wierd that I just saw this. Not sure if the link will work. Very apt. Lol! https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=192150347807309&id=187000618322282
698671452061638656 2016-02-13 00:53:49 UTC <LewisC919> @polar_mcbear Sorry man. That sucks. Pun not intended. Lol.
698656427204857856 2016-02-13 23:54:07 UTC <LewisC919> @p4lm2 That was fast. Balls to the wall. Lol.https://twitter.com/dcexaminer/status/698649444431085568
698655605033197568 2016-02-13 23:50:51 UTC <LewisC919> @p4lm2 I predict funny business. Like picking a liberal Republican. Or, picking a sitting Senator. Personal angle to muddy the waters.
698652423641034756 2016-02-13 23:38:12 UTC <LewisC919> @p4lm2 I don't think the nuclear option thing applied to SCOTUS nominations. If filibustered, he'll need 14 R votes for an appointment.
698651988054188032 2016-02-13 23:36:28 UTC <LewisC919> @p4lm2 That's not really apt. Ds controlled the Senate. Any appointment would've req at least a few Ds. O will need a few more R votes.
698651207561302016 2016-02-13 23:33:22 UTC <LewisC919> @dap1510 Gonna be nuts. Each circuit is gonna have its own constitutional standards after all the tie votes. Assuming appointment is delayed
698644120064147458 2016-02-13 23:05:13 UTC <LewisC919> @TimTakesTime Easy answer. Lower court rulings are sustained by default under that scenario.
698592900410638336 2016-02-13 19:41:41 UTC <LewisC919> @aprice1208 Not good. Repairman ETA?
698512689543442432 2016-02-13 14:22:57 UTC <LewisC919> @DoubleStandard4 good deal man.
698450438216089600 2016-02-13 10:15:35 UTC <LewisC919> @BigCountry1510 Nah. I'll take the pancakes & sausage, though. Haha.
698438372457582592 2016-02-13 09:27:39 UTC <LewisC919> @Ryan__Metzger good deal.
698418100291633152 2016-02-13 08:07:05 UTC <LewisC919> @Jwrong LeBron James? Lol. Just kidding. It irks the hell out of me when folks use that abbreviation for him.
698399544116125696 2016-02-12 06:53:21 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos Good lord.
698385389745258498 2016-02-12 05:57:06 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos A seminal moment for car guys. Always remember what you were doing when you heard the news. Lol.
698383082341195776 2016-02-12 05:47:56 UTC <LewisC919> @ItsAJoshParty Bipeds suck, quadrupeds rule! 
698379234776104960 2016-02-12 05:32:39 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 Haha. Figure out something, though. Lots of folks w/turkey day-ish bdays...
698370260622315521 2016-02-12 04:56:59 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos What are the chances? Still thinks it's bizarre that it happened.
698369650040639488 2016-02-12 04:54:34 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 Oh lord. They make plastic slipcovers for trucks? Lol.

698313120117362689 2016-02-12 01:09:56 UTC <LewisC919> @BigCountry1510 very cool.

698051239297335296 2016-02-11 07:49:19 UTC <LewisC919> @MattPwnz I just thought "cleaning lady" and chuckled. 
698050917992656896 2016-02-11 07:48:02 UTC <LewisC919> @MattPwnz how are you man? You're not on here much anymore.
698037751359397888 2016-02-11 06:55:43 UTC <LewisC919> @ambercelt Not necessarily a bad thing. I mean, if that's the most pressing thing you're thinking about, life's pretty good. Haha.
698036446800842752 2016-02-11 06:50:32 UTC <LewisC919> @WarMed_117 Wally World was selling heart shaped butterflied Ribeyes last valentine's. Got it on a disc on the 14th. Cut/froze 1/2. Haha.

697643239608860672 2016-02-10 04:48:04 UTC <LewisC919> @LauraWalkerKC Sandy should, henceforth, be called Bonnie.

697536839394189313 2016-02-10 21:45:16 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos Can't even imagine. If it's only 36 here at this time of day, I bet it's pretty bad up your way.
697512800760041472 2016-02-10 20:09:45 UTC <LewisC919> @Russ_Crawford too funny.
697511762527125504 2016-02-10 20:05:37 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry Interesting situation now. With the positions open, SS will be struck down as an equal protection violation if they're not req.

697358035132485632 2016-02-10 09:54:46 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys Oh, I was older than that. Actually, I still don't do that properly into my mid 30s. Still rem mom. "God dammit Lewis!
697356543784808448 2016-02-10 09:48:50 UTC <LewisC919> @OutNmbrdByBoys Rem being a kid in that situation. I got a scolding for swallowing my food whole. Lol. Hope the kiddo feels better soon.
697330917937934336 2016-02-10 08:07:01 UTC <LewisC919> @WRAL Just great. @TWC_Help is running maintenance while y'all are showing prime time shows overnight. Way to communicate, guys.
697319165149904896 2016-02-09 07:20:19 UTC <LewisC919> @OConnell75thRR Hey man. How are you?
697310325796958208 2016-02-09 06:45:11 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J is there a time difference from your move?
697309463166984192 2016-02-09 06:41:46 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 You just got "you're" right. Too many folk can't do that when well rested. 
697308804447391744 2016-02-09 06:39:09 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 No. Mind does whatever it needs to get though life. It's when it doesn't, folks have the problems.
697276216949268480 2016-02-09 04:29:39 UTC <LewisC919> @DoubleStandard4 well said.
697262311216672768 2016-02-09 03:34:24 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 Brilliant.
697218964498284546 2016-02-09 00:42:09 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos Good deal bro.
697218646851133445 2016-02-09 00:40:53 UTC <LewisC919> @DuffySends Geez. Hope there's a rush fee. Crisis mode compensation? 
697217289838583808 2016-02-09 00:35:30 UTC <LewisC919> @Jackie0351 same @? I need more people to follow on there.
697213724260757505 2016-02-09 00:21:20 UTC <LewisC919> @GnasherxMan There's you are! I figured you out the second I saw Blackberry. Lol.
697210573394681856 2016-02-09 00:08:48 UTC <LewisC919> @Sandra_Woy Looks like there are at least two other ways.pic.twitter.com/fmQvJO8ufy

697202158643630080 2016-02-09 23:35:22 UTC <LewisC919> @dap1510 disregard. Saw the subsequent tweet. My bad.
697201885946712065 2016-02-09 23:34:17 UTC <LewisC919> @dap1510 if not, wouldn't it be struck down? Thought it survived a challenge because the units were closed.
697132006455566337 2016-02-09 18:56:37 UTC <LewisC919> @BukowskiLynn Hmmm. Sarcastic mom to grandma's sigh: what's wrong, mama? Equally sarcastic grandma to mom: just breathing, Jan. 
697030934537891841 2016-02-09 12:14:59 UTC <LewisC919> @TommyD6336 Same to you man.

695645428465926146 2016-02-05 16:29:29 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus ask them to check the inventory. They should be able to tell if it was an accident. Any chance they owe you some (had to order)?

690343383039111169 2016-01-21 01:21:03 UTC <LewisC919> @ataylorslp No rules, no filter, & no holds barred gut spilling on Twitter.  @jackksontayylor @Zach_Taylor321
690333594036899843 2016-01-21 00:42:09 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 That makes me smile. 
690327011810762752 2016-01-21 00:15:59 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 My mother isn't well but somehow she knows whenever the day my brother died comes around. Even 34 years later.
690273719130923009 2016-01-21 20:44:13 UTC <LewisC919> @jonathankappler long ways to go but that's interesting.
690266560317956096 2016-01-21 20:15:47 UTC <LewisC919> @G130J where's the dislike button? Hope it's not too bad.
690265285924761600 2016-01-21 20:10:43 UTC <LewisC919> @SmokeEater1978 Kiddos are germ, pee, & poop factories.
690212161403129858 2016-01-21 16:39:37 UTC <LewisC919> @paxton9 great question.
690210429503684608 2016-01-21 16:32:44 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus "definitely" here. 
690185083265880065 2016-01-21 14:52:01 UTC <LewisC919> And that surname is now muted. 
690090803142725632 2016-01-21 08:37:23 UTC <LewisC919> @BrianFox46 hmmm. Chocolate covered potato chips are good. Then again, I can't eat Wendy's with just a frosty. Ha. Mornin'.
690085330129674240 2016-01-21 08:15:38 UTC <LewisC919> @JaredWOgden looks like you're having a great time. Good deal.

690017218130792448 2016-01-20 03:44:59 UTC <LewisC919> @jab2375 Well deserved. Enjoy.

689980532839563264 2016-01-20 01:19:12 UTC <LewisC919> @Michael_Goggans What's wrong man?
689974822961569793 2016-01-20 00:56:31 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 They air mattress on the lake thing was great. Chuckling just thinking about it.
689963971999326208 2016-01-20 00:13:24 UTC <LewisC919> @eville_parole2 Uh, I'm not sure. It drys to white so I'm guessing not. 
689958405516169216 2016-01-20 23:51:17 UTC <LewisC919> I was wondering why they brined the roads...pic.twitter.com/De4OVNQ10Y
689940996935806976 2016-01-20 22:42:06 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnZaharopulos Had to look it up. Peninsula... lol.
689922598851973120 2016-01-20 21:29:00 UTC <LewisC919> Thank god. Recording myself watching to DVD for Tuesday night's shows was tedious. Must like my sis/b-in-law. https://twitter.com/WRAL/status/689921162445459456
689919537572139009 2016-01-20 21:16:50 UTC <LewisC919> @pptsapper You give good advice. Made me think to check Washington State Digital Archives and BINGO!.
689915746630107136 2016-01-20 21:01:46 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox And pray that it's peaceful, of course.
689915329473089536 2016-01-20 21:00:07 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox Do what we can in midterms and wait for the country to balkanize.
689915235549999104 2016-01-20 20:59:44 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox Like I said before, it's over. Demographic death and the right flank splintering off.
689912192477630464 2016-01-20 20:47:39 UTC <LewisC919> @BrentWoodcox unfortunately, the "trust us...he's most viable" thing isn't gonna work anymore. Sad as it might actually be true this time.
689911549461426177 2016-01-20 20:45:05 UTC <LewisC919> @pptsapper Is there a way to find out about a specific soldier's WWI service? Online or something similar?
689907258877153284 2016-01-20 20:28:03 UTC <LewisC919> @ofp_allday Meh. Keep being nice. I'm sure someone along the way will really appreciate it. Whether they say so or not.
689906934242217986 2016-01-20 20:26:45 UTC <LewisC919> @JohnDylanJessup good job man.

689901722995671046 2016-01-20 20:06:03 UTC <LewisC919> @ethanmennen Jealous, though. 
689887705090625536 2016-01-20 19:10:21 UTC <LewisC919> @DaveMBP Good thing your lady is already knocked up. Lolol.
689844396959883268 2016-01-20 16:18:15 UTC <LewisC919> @MattG523 Is that the quote you're getting a tattoo of? 
689825881909563393 2016-01-20 15:04:41 UTC <LewisC919> @th3v0t4ry Had weird dreams, too.
689702036489814017 2016-01-19 06:52:34 UTC <LewisC919> @devengus Again, sorry for your loss man.
