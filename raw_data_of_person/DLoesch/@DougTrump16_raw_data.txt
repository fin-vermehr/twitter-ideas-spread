971192091207331840 2018-03-06 01:13:33 UTC <DougTrump16> @DRUDGE_REPORT Makes sense when Macron was banging his teacher at that age.
971184234948739072 2018-03-06 00:42:19 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews So RBA puppet, You warned about his policies crashing the US economy. What is the last quarter GDP for USA vs Australia. How about you shut your mouth?

971134330499051520 2018-03-06 21:24:01 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @SkyNewsAust Donald Trump campaigned on this, has taken ads out in papers since 1980's. Sky News acts surprised like a bunch of gold fish numpties.
971129089787494400 2018-03-06 21:03:12 UTC <DougTrump16> @LauraLoomer As much as I'd like to see her isolated. Sending them to GB for Civil disobedience is a tad heavy. I like the way your thinking though

I'm not sure who the bigger terrorists are in all this.

An agreement written by unelected megacorp lawyers, overides Australian laws & treaty you didn't discuss or debate with the Australian public back in Feb 2016.

970465837000810497 2018-03-04 01:07:40 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @SkyNewsAust But I thought Australia had the wonderful TPP that they never saw, written by unelected mega-corporate lawyers, signed in Feb 2016 and overrides the nations laws that will save them.

If they chop Infowars off YouTube, countless sites and torrents would pop up all over the net. It would make him an underground icon, demand would increase and make Infowars bigger.

Perhaps knowing one will be joked about & disregarded may cause one to reconsider options instead of making a selfish scene.

969541066570395648 2018-03-02 11:52:58 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @EdKrassen 2 tweets ago you talk about a "dictatorship" and now you want that "dictator" to take your guns. Your 47th chromosome is playing up there, champ.
969540516604858368 2018-03-02 11:50:47 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump The worst impersonation is Sleepy Sessions impersonating an Attorney General!
969540103977619457 2018-03-02 11:49:08 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews The NRL doesn't care about women!! South Sydney Rabbitoh owner Russell Crowe protect rapist Harvey Weinstein for years spiking a story in the early 2000's.
969477301602668545 2018-03-01 07:39:35 UTC <DougTrump16> @jack When someone goes to such length to say they aren't biased, they are biased. I got week ban for calling John Oliver a "ret*rded talking head" meanwhile put "ret*rded Trump" in the search and watch them tweets go! The Lord Abhors dishonest scales.
969434680620589059 2018-03-01 04:50:13 UTC <DougTrump16> @Rambobiggs @eleesabet Here's some great news. Not all people your age believe what you do. Lots of kids really love the constitution. Later, more of you get jobs, start careers and then learn that you actually like the idea of private property and become wonderful young conservatives and libertarians.

969376493473116160 2018-03-01 00:59:00 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump Great news. On another note, while you tolerate media and investigators trashing staff for the innocuous  (e.g. "White lies") while that Rip Van Winkel Sessions ignores so much then you get everything that's coming and have let the people down. Time to show those balls off! again

965429128089370624 2018-02-18 03:33:35 UTC <DougTrump16> @tracybeanz The next big shoe to drop is the IG or one of Rocketman's firecrackers. I can't see anything until then barring a terrorist attack here or abroad.

965400858455195648 2018-02-18 01:41:15 UTC <DougTrump16> @BillOReilly Telling someone to play basketball is racist? I'm not quite sure how that works. Le Bron may be kicking an own goal based on his own generalisations and stereotyping.

965380792066097152 2018-02-18 00:21:31 UTC <DougTrump16> @Greens @GChristensenMP @sarahinthesen8 @BreakfastNews @mnxmoosi Nice over emotional input there however. When receiving a threat, one should.  1. Refer it immediately to the police. 2. Don't tweet/broadcast it, leave that to the police. They'll usually advise this. 3. Take necessary steps to assure your safety.  It's bullshit!

965297419666702336 2018-02-18 18:50:13 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews The elephant in the room is why the FBI didn't follow up adequately on information from many sources/tips by the public. Mary Ellen has the right last name.

964624915247742977 2018-02-16 22:17:56 UTC <DougTrump16> @Thomas1774Paine I wonder how many psychologists and counselors have said "You may want to try turning off CNN or MSNBC and see how you feel after a week."
964618649125318657 2018-02-16 21:53:02 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich So in America, you can be a regular looking guy, borrow money, work hard, make billions, sleep with women like this and then become president. No wonder why so many people want in!

964589238762201088 2018-02-16 19:56:10 UTC <DougTrump16> @TomFitton @ABC It was poor form by the FBI. This was a perfect example of how a vigilant citizen and a proactive FBI/Police could have avoided a tragedy. The greatest underused police force a nation has are it citizens looking out for each other while minding it's own business. FBI stuffed up!
964588153167282176 2018-02-16 19:51:51 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust Reading your comments guys, you're losing. The people see through the waters you muddy.

964572463815303168 2018-02-16 18:49:30 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust So basically, To screw up USA all Vladimir needed to do was... Nothing!! He just needed a handful of nerds to tweet their own opinions while they waited for Call Of Duty to load up. Absolutely laughable! Rosenstein will be sacked shortly, every day in that job is a bonus for him.
964571445886988288 2018-02-16 18:45:28 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich @curaffairs 4chan nerds would have found him and ordered him a pizza in 15 minutes
964570934957916160 2018-02-16 18:43:26 UTC <DougTrump16> @wikileaks No tweeting about any election in another country folks!! Vladimir must be laughing that all he had to do to screw up America was nothing! He just needed a handfull of Russian nerds tweeting away while they waited for their World of Warcraft raid to start.
964568689465991168 2018-02-16 18:34:31 UTC <DougTrump16> @JackPosobiec @Ugh_Trump or they could have had an interest like every other country and social media has allowed them to share and voice that interest.
964568288607940608 2018-02-16 18:32:55 UTC <DougTrump16> @JackPosobiec So basically, like every other country. They had an interest in US politics, collectively they supported no candidate but individually argued for/against both sides. A school kid writing a school essay on the internet & social media could have come up with the same conclusion.
964566733569708032 2018-02-16 18:26:44 UTC <DougTrump16> @PrisonPlanet @Barnes_Law Knock knock, "Police!!! We are here for the tweets!" I think more than one flew over the cuckoo's nest.

964552012367986688 2018-02-16 17:28:14 UTC <DougTrump16> @ChrisCuomo $500 dollar metal detector, have FBI and Youtube/Google actually be able to find someone who tells you what they are planning nearly 6 months ago, find out why more and more kids are anti-depressant dependant & go back to trust in society where people look out for each other.
964538420453294082 2018-02-16 16:34:14 UTC <DougTrump16> @Shastina_Eloff @NO10000CONFUSED I think the whole world would kind of not say much about it.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5100087/Armed-guards-concrete-barriers-Christmas-markets.html

964536727837687808 2018-02-16 16:27:30 UTC <DougTrump16> @Timcast So a guy reported on the spectrum of autism, which one is usually overfocused on something. Is a white supremacist that goes on a shooting spree that includes kills white people. Seems legit.
964535389837905921 2018-02-16 16:22:11 UTC <DougTrump16> @robreiner So every murder is Trumps doing, every earthquake, every tsunami, every hurricane, every false incoming missile, every terrorist attack and any other calamity.  What isn't Trumps doing.. Winning an election and an improving economy.  You guys are defective units, get help.

964450031712399360 2018-02-16 10:43:00 UTC <DougTrump16> @w_terrence I think it's safe to say, it was not politically motivated. So even if he was a card carrying Democrat with a Hillary badge, it is irrelevant.
964402669744832518 2018-02-15 07:34:48 UTC <DougTrump16> @LauraLoomer And they couldn't work out who this guy was when he posted in September that he wanted to be a school shooter? Seems legit
964381182740672512 2018-02-15 06:09:25 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews Judge got it spot on! Australia helped cultivate modern day radical Islam & then imported it. It's government encourages it citizens to bully those who say what their government helped create exists. Here they are, like useful idiots doing the corrupt regimes bidding.

964328589691830272 2018-02-15 02:40:26 UTC <DougTrump16> @Rambobiggs Wouldn't a white supremacist just target non-whites? If he was a white nationalist, he wasn't a very good one.The guy was a bit job, he wanted easy, indiscriminate kills. As many as possible. If he didn't have a gun, he'd use a car, a knife, fire or whatever else. FBI f**ked up!

963958799781347328 2018-02-14 02:11:02 UTC <DougTrump16> @Rambobiggs Correct, the best police force a country has and ever will is a citizenry trusting each other while looking out for each other.

962050347924533249 2018-02-09 19:47:31 UTC <DougTrump16> @benshapiro Ben the Weasel probably had hero's who gave the same support. He now draws joins dots of yesteryear with today's mud slinging (courtesy of a presidential run) and today's standards to make a new picture. This is how he soothes his internalized Trump Derangement Syndrome.

960247016403038208 2018-02-04 20:21:43 UTC <DougTrump16> @jerome_corsi Can you imagine the spanner in the works if there was a classified FISA on Bernie Sanders? Explains why he rolled over so easy and stayed on the reserve. Usually when you catch corruption in organisations like FBI/DOJ, it's not their first time. I will bet my left nut on it!

I'm willing to put money on it. He folded like an old dollar Easy target with his travel Usually when you catch corrupt organisations FBI/DOJ it's not their first time. Food for thought.
960237326038335488 2018-02-04 19:43:13 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump Just a thought, have a look if there is a FISA order on Bernie Sanders. If so declassify, redact & release. Enjoy the show of mockingbird imploding.

I'm willing to put money on it that there is a classified FISA order with Bernie Sanders/Mrs Sanders name on it. Pretty certain he had the digital colonoscopy too and perhaps why he rolled so easily.
960235638820753408 2018-02-04 19:36:31 UTC <DougTrump16> @HAGOODMANAUTHOR Ever think that Bernie had a FISA order to give him a digital colonoscopy as well? He did visit places of interest, people of interest, honeymoon in Soviet Union. Guess it's why he rolls over so easily. When the corrupt (FBI/DOJ) are caught it's not usually their first time.
960223894547218432 2018-02-04 18:49:51 UTC <DougTrump16> @DonaldJTrumpJr You know this happened to Bernie Sanders too. This will answer why he rolled over so easily. To ensure the 2008 deal between Barry and the queen was honored. When criminals are caught it's not usually their first time.
960221433291927552 2018-02-04 18:40:04 UTC <DougTrump16> @dbongino Bernie Sanders and Wife had a honeymoon in Russia. I wonder if that's why he rolled over so easily. Wouldn't it implode liberal heads if Mr Sanders had the digital colonoscopy too?

959501275359469569 2018-02-02 18:58:25 UTC <DougTrump16> @benshapiro With no proof of Russian Collusion so far. The potential for 2 withdrawn pleas that involved Strzok. Leading to the legal hunted nor becoming the legal hunters. The likelihood of Rosenstein gone in the near future. Mueller' s investigation is looking unprofitable to pursue.
959489312130658304 2018-02-02 18:10:53 UTC <DougTrump16> @CNN Place your bets when the legal hunted becomes the legal hunter. When will Flynn withdraw his plea? When will Rosenstein "Resign"? How big will liberal meltdown be?

Watch for the reaction when the memo is released and the biggest political scandal in US history exposed. Then re-read his tweets over the last 18 months, it will make the 6th Sense movie look like a walk in the park.

Your duality is impressive. You'll cry "Trump" is a narcissist but here you are, on TV insisting that others have to live up to a standard but you don't.

958166645528121345 2018-01-29 02:35:04 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust McCabe was part of the Obama regime using fabricated evidence to obtain FISA order to spy on political opponents. This is the biggest story in US political history. Obama admin deprived entire Trump campaign of their 4th amendment rights. Admiral Rogers is a hero

I got over giving an ear to this type of what can loosely described as music after the ICE-T Cop Killer nearly 30 years ago. You make yourself super privileged by grunting how underprivileged you are. They dehumanized an audience by making it cool

My inner bush lawyer tells me a similar principle is in play here.

956334573243179008 2018-01-24 01:15:04 UTC <DougTrump16> @ASavageNation Trump has seen a crooked cop or 2 in his lifetime. It's all under control.
956311468881801216 2018-01-24 23:43:16 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @abcnews Haha the roller coaster goes up for the Trump Derangement Sufferers and then they come crashing back to disappointment as nothing happens. An endless cycle of hope-hype-losing-whining as ABC lies by omission. 
956273406294425602 2018-01-24 21:12:01 UTC <DougTrump16> @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @abcnews @bongindustryz But the unemployment rate falls to 2 decade lows.   Clearly more jobs created than jobs ended. Basic math.

956256747366227968 2018-01-24 20:05:49 UTC <DougTrump16> @stranahan @epd44 Obama admin/intelbasically gave the Trump family and associates a digital colonoscopy well before and after the election. If that were true, you wouldn't be here complaining about your President. Wake up, get out of that fantasy world!!!
956254778715074560 2018-01-24 19:58:00 UTC <DougTrump16> @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @abcnews @bongindustryz It cites/quotes fiction writer  Unemployment numbers went down, I guess the 2.2 million jobs covered those. Oh yeh, if you're employed check your super. If it has overseas investment (likely) it went up, you had a good year! Thanks President Trump! Keep up the incompetence
956252618380029952 2018-01-24 19:49:25 UTC <DougTrump16> @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @abcnews @bongindustryz Lowest black unemployment in recorded history. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/05/black-unemployment-rate-falls-to-record-low.html
956251762742063104 2018-01-24 19:46:01 UTC <DougTrump16> @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @abcnews @bongindustryz 4.1% unemployment, pushing 4%GDP, lower taxes, highest biz/consumer confidence in decades, $8 trillion added to stock & record $$ being repatriated. Keep up the incompetence 
956251227867660289 2018-01-24 19:43:53 UTC <DougTrump16> @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @abcnews Mockingbird media obsession with her campaign's "Russsian collusion narrative" makes this unavoidable.These Nazi propaganda playbook tricks you are trying do not work anymore.

956237031943716864 2018-01-24 18:47:29 UTC <DougTrump16> @bevvo14 @DukeLaw @realDonaldTrump @abcnews ABC continues to produce phony after phony to socially engineer it's audience. How about a report on the text by Peter Strzok to Lisa Page about his apprehension joining the Mueller investigation because there was no "there there" in Russian Collusion. ABC = cognitive dissonance

956086449836761089 2018-01-24 08:49:07 UTC <DougTrump16> @HuevosDeChivo Remember when the FBI interviewed Flynn and found he "lied" because they had transcripts of what he said and it didn't match?  Same is going to be done like a WWE reversal move. Those texts will turn up after 2 texters are interviewed.
956067252822044677 2018-01-23 07:32:50 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews Haha ABC, why so quiet on Russian Collusion with US Elections?  Could it be your compliance with mockingbird US media is going to show you as complicit liars. Not reporting that Obama WH spied on political opponents?  Your senior editor and news team need to sacked!

954917731488301056 2018-01-20 03:25:03 UTC <DougTrump16> @Blklivesmatter @RealCandaceO I think would be asking "Why did the government think the FBI was doing the right thing by protecting the mafia because the mafia could be used to kill Castro but instead just killed me.".
954914279378923521 2018-01-20 03:11:20 UTC <DougTrump16> @caitoz Whitehouse will actually have to collude with Russia on regime change, they know it. President Eisenhower's warning rings as loud today than when first said. Every US war since he left has only been publicly supported after "false flag" 's. My issue is with 7th floor not Prez'(s)
954911060649127936 2018-01-20 02:58:32 UTC <DougTrump16> @caitoz He is the President. His government is shut down, just got tax cuts through, still has no wall. He is not in control, a dictator would be though. Not in control of who provides the Intel that is presented in a way so that each president comes up with the conclusion they want.
954908589872656385 2018-01-20 02:48:43 UTC <DougTrump16> @caitoz While I agree with you and disagree with Tillerson sticking the US beak in. I'm adamant President Trump wants peace as it is cheaper. If it doesn't work (which it wont) President Trump will not persist. Pentagon feeds the Intel, they omit Intel that lead to peaceful options.

Perhaps if you sacked all the overly-biased editor's who teleprompt the talking heads & hire closer to neutral editors then you may get some ratings back & eventually contribute to the news cycle again.

So far, only political violence seen is a shooting and assault by the left.
953439306126782465 2018-01-16 01:30:19 UTC <DougTrump16> @JeffFlake Expression was used in 1882 by Henrik Ibsen when Stalin was just a kid. Stalin doesn't own it flakey boy!

953061635467325440 2018-01-15 00:29:35 UTC <DougTrump16> @Thesismis Both are actual kids and neither does anything for me. That's just you being an illogical emotional mess. Check your state laws. Assault a female kill the unborn and get done for manslaughter, not cellular vandalism. Funny your government recognises an unborn child as a life.
953058306435633153 2018-01-15 00:16:21 UTC <DougTrump16> @Thesismis Manning released documents at the operational/personnel level not documents on the idiots who sent them to war. The civilians were killed by their own countrymen, keep up. I know it's hard on your meds but please try.
952997514055053312 2018-01-15 20:14:47 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @hrenee80 @bocavista2016 It's amazing what jobs do.
952996782346129408 2018-01-15 20:11:53 UTC <DougTrump16> @seanhannity The only thing dumber than sending your tallywhacker on social media is paying people to look at all the tallywhackers being sent on social media.
952987758951153664 2018-01-15 19:36:02 UTC <DougTrump16> @TheMarkPantano @ABC7Jory So how is Mika to do her job and control what people think?
952986920631480320 2018-01-15 19:32:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @SkyNewsAust Obama funds AQL (moderate Islamic movement) to overthrow Libyan government despite their promise to turn it into an Arabic state by eradicating black African Libyans. They succeeded and then Obama calls the newly failed state a "sh*tshow!".

952972757431537664 2018-01-15 18:36:25 UTC <DougTrump16> @TomFitton @foxandfriends It went like this. Russia "No more money for You Mrs Clinton, you might not win the election. Tell Bill nice speach last time" Hillary "The Russians are hacking the election!!"
952971878175395840 2018-01-15 18:32:55 UTC <DougTrump16> @TruNews If you can't follow the law, write the law.
952971544401096704 2018-01-15 18:31:36 UTC <DougTrump16> @Project_Veritas @iamandymcdonald That's handy for because somewhere out there is a Twitter employee who has found one of your jokes mildly amusing.
952969160031657984 2018-01-15 18:22:07 UTC <DougTrump16> @JackPosobiec At least my little guy doesn't take up much of their memory.

952941861357760512 2018-01-15 16:33:39 UTC <DougTrump16> @Thesismis 900 Afghan civilians who had their names released that were aiding against the Taliban that your hero leaked. Most likely, murdered. Again, you're a factless socially engineered libtard who didn't care or know who Bradley Manning was until you found out about his mental illness.

In it for the money. Obama starts presidency 1-2 million net worth leaves with 40 million net worth. Not in it for the money. Liberal logic.

952865710815916032 2018-01-15 11:31:03 UTC <DougTrump16> @BillClinton You raped that country like.... well you know. Can't grow their own rice... Who do they buy it off again?? Can't mine their own gold.. Did uncle Tony pay for the wedding??

952857848756682752 2018-01-15 10:59:49 UTC <DougTrump16> @DrRimmer @abcnews @Thesismis If you consider those who can't follow the law worthy of writing the law.

952837530344308738 2018-01-15 09:39:04 UTC <DougTrump16> @thehill 1. Not enough dead journalists. 2. Not enough incarcerated journalists  Go to Germany and ask a journalist/citizen to give honest reporting/opinion on immigration & crime demographics. You will meet Hitler/Stalin.
952836341728866305 2018-01-15 09:34:21 UTC <DougTrump16> @ByronYork Jeff Flake should actually go to Germany and ask journalists there if they are comfortable honestly reporting on immigration. There you will see some similarities and past reminders.

952711862889603072 2018-01-14 01:19:43 UTC <DougTrump16> @dbongino You know I'm thinking Hillary lost it when the Russians told her something like this "Sorry, no more money until we see if you win.".
952710561745182720 2018-01-14 01:14:33 UTC <DougTrump16> @dbongino Very true. I wrote a crappy blog in Jan 2016 about the most spied on man on the planet. Not even creepy how it almost all came true. They needed the FISA to cover and muddy the waters for all of their previous spying.
952708434754920448 2018-01-14 01:06:05 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @abcnews @BillSparow1 This after Obama/Clinton funded AQL (moderate Islamic movement) who had promised to overthrow Libyan government but also mate it clear they would make it an Arab state from an African state. To achieve this they would kill black southern Libyans & they did. Infinitely worse!
952707394571661312 2018-01-14 01:01:57 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @abcnews There you go, finally someone who appropriately expresses her disappointment.

952617012542414848 2018-01-14 19:02:49 UTC <DougTrump16> @JakeSherman Probably falling a bit behind reading/watching, ringing and correcting all the other sh*thole news outlets. It's great because the sh*thole news media actually makes President Trump look better by attacking him. People don't need to watch SNL now.
952436224932814848 2018-01-13 07:04:26 UTC <DougTrump16> @johnpodesta Reading these comments I think I agree with Hillary, "delete your account". You are getting scorched like a chicken to Moloch!

952392427200901121 2018-01-13 04:10:23 UTC <DougTrump16> @JackPosobiec He has just called the government's of Canada and Australia racist. They'd rather be called sh*tholes!!

952343929441042432 2018-01-13 00:57:41 UTC <DougTrump16> @MSNBC It wasn't a threat. It's not literally life or death.

952334290179702784 2018-01-13 00:19:22 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @SkyNewsAust Well they are driving the civil war in Syria, Yemen and arming /unding Hezbollah in Lebanon. What will they do next with the billions from Imam Obama?
952332386548641793 2018-01-13 00:11:49 UTC <DougTrump16> @meganewsmedia @AdamParkhomenko Another opportunity is coming up.
952329508023025664 2018-01-13 00:00:22 UTC <DougTrump16> @Rambobiggs Something is fishy. 1st alert is too specific "Ballistic missile inbound", all caps, "Hawaii". 2nd text lower case, "State of Hawaii". You would use preprogrammed texts, same format, same language. They were hacked or played.
952322668820234240 2018-01-13 23:33:12 UTC <DougTrump16> @GovHawaii @SkyNewsAust Total bull! They were hacked or played.

952321571426680832 2018-01-13 23:28:50 UTC <DougTrump16> @LauraLoomer Total crap. We go from "wrong button" to clicked wrong option on screen. Pre programmed text all caps telling you what type of missile incoming but not preprogrammed text advising false alarm? First text says "Hawaii", Second text lower case saying "State of Hawaii". Odd
952318818876928000 2018-01-13 23:17:54 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews Total crap. This stinks

952295652343468033 2018-01-13 21:45:50 UTC <DougTrump16> @JBaker31826004 @FoxNews Would be pre-programmed the same format, all capitals like the first text and refer to "Hawaii" & not "The state of Hawaii". It is also not necessary to advise what kind of missile is used. I don't think the first text was really pre-programmed. The "wrong button" thing is bull!
952293991634026496 2018-01-13 21:39:15 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @mflynnJR @Frank_K_Santoyo Well if your going to pick on my president at least make me laugh

Says "Hawaii"  Follow up text Lower case Refers to "State of Hawaii"  They dont have pre-programmed texts written same way (all caps) in case of "false alarm"? This stinks!
952292279963729920 2018-01-13 21:32:26 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @mflynnJR @Frank_K_Santoyo Hahaha. I can see some kid downloading original porn image, mum walks in. "Little Johnny!!" she says. He replies "Get out mum, I'm making a meme!"

Everything bad in your life is not President Trumps fault, that is just your poorly functioning brain comforting your emotional issues. See a good shrink, get a good new life coach.
952286116987551744 2018-01-13 21:07:57 UTC <DougTrump16> @jamieleecurtis You idiot, Hawaii is Democrat. This was not a missile scare, it was a text scare. Lay of the botox love it's leaking through to your brain. Back on your meds mutton.
952285093740998657 2018-01-13 21:03:53 UTC <DougTrump16> @TulsiGabbard @Bryson_M @realCharter @earthgal75 The morons do not monitor texts to see if missiles are coming. You would have to be a moron to think that.
952284633936248832 2018-01-13 21:02:03 UTC <DougTrump16> @TulsiGabbard So you expect us believe that the "wrong button" was pushed. A pre-typed text then goes out (all capitals), advising what kind of missile is incoming "BALLISTIC" to Hawaii. Then it takes 40 minutes to send advice all lower case saying just "missile" to the "state of Hawaii". 
952279954653306881 2018-01-13 20:43:28 UTC <DougTrump16> Hawaii's emergency alert is odd. First text all caps and the word "BALLISTIC" is not necessary. Second text lower is case. If "wrong button" was pushed, why so long for correction. #hawaii
952278627822878720 2018-01-13 20:38:12 UTC <DougTrump16> @roarmittens It was a hack. Government won't admit it's a hack. "Change of shift, employee pushing wrong button"?, yeh right.
952277684133838848 2018-01-13 20:34:27 UTC <DougTrump16> @DRUDGE_REPORT @angieevanhorn This is serious, Hawaii is a Democrat stronghold. You are a #unstablemoron and you cannot spin everything on President Trump. Up your medication or change it.

952271585116798976 2018-01-13 20:10:12 UTC <DougTrump16> @JackPosobiec @tweetiesheba No one listens to Ted on national security anymore. They will just ask how his IT guys are going. This was just Tulsi Gabbard launching her 2020 campaign. Her TV talks currently are filled with laying the groundwork for her run.
952270079286116352 2018-01-13 20:04:13 UTC <DougTrump16> @redpillblack My greatest memories are coming out of poverty. It's not the gradual accumulation of material things that brings the fulfilment. It's the gradual accumulation of self belief and self worth as your hard work brings fruit. It's a bulletproof feeling.
952268450914648064 2018-01-13 19:57:45 UTC <DougTrump16> @JackPosobiec @tweetiesheba Not really, those who launch retaliatory strikes monitor systems much more sophisticated than texts.
952268068629102592 2018-01-13 19:56:14 UTC <DougTrump16> @JackPosobiec Tulsi has launched her 2020 campaign.
952263945984684032 2018-01-13 19:39:51 UTC <DougTrump16> @Shastina_Eloff @vannsmole Interesting they used "BALLISTIC" when just "MISSILE" would do. This was a hack.

952237282429317120 2018-01-13 17:53:54 UTC <DougTrump16> @ananavarro Dear Ana,  Congratulations on your side winning the popular vote. Your side paying $9million+ on working with foreign/Russian spies on a report that they could have got on 4chan for a six pack and pizza, was a great move but expensive.  Signed Donald J. Trump The election WINNER.
952233805804290048 2018-01-13 17:40:05 UTC <DougTrump16> @ktoxxx You really need to keep abreast of things and buy a dictionary lady. Calling a place a sh*thole is not racist.
952229302652694529 2018-01-13 17:22:11 UTC <DougTrump16> @HNIJohnMiller @CtownAtNYC For the corrupt dirty cop Mueller to only have 4 is embarrassing. Take one off that number shortly, fruit of a poisonous tree. As the Obama regime holdovers and dodgy judges get replaced, your tears will increase.

952225966801149952 2018-01-13 17:08:56 UTC <DougTrump16> @AC360 Did you cry when Tony Rodham went into a sh*thole and got to mine the countries precious metals. Did you cry when the Obama/Clinton regime installed Michel Martelly who served his colonial masters well insuring it stayed a sh*thole. Your charade is over, Vanderbilt.

Haiti has a murder problem a human trafficking problem and extreme poverty.

Not calling a country that is a sh*thole "a sh*thole" because it residents arent white is racist. You are saying because you aren't white you are not emotionally resilient to handle the truth.

951595833538965504 2018-01-11 23:25:01 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews @GrettaPecl Eg. tomatoes require a certain average temperature over a few days to trigger the ripening process. Same 2 to 3 week window has been maintained for the last 7 years when this happens. If the numbers given by the BOM in my area is true they should ripen 3-4 weeks sooner.

950918297049997313 2018-01-09 02:32:43 UTC <DougTrump16> @caitoz Your governments have been cuckified since 07. Incapable of making decisions, incapable of offending and just bobbing around the oceans of international political trends.

Meaning it's now in Israel! Israel declared it their capital since 1980. The irony is you are saying indirectly that Islam is not a religion of peace.

943825009180418048 2017-12-21 12:46:32 UTC <DougTrump16> @mirandadevine There is a global problem of Radicalised Islam. That is not a racist statement! It is US/Western Policy who promoted it, paid for it. They intended to bring down Russia with it. It went rogue! The biggest critics of radical Islam are the muslims who are victims of it!
943822788158091264 2017-12-21 12:37:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @bullshit_hero Australians once had a proud history of sniffing out . 3 hours to blame drugs/mental health issues? Public is bullied to buy into it or pretend to buy into it for fear of being a politically incorrect social outcast. The ones who pretend then support idiots like Hanson.

943810201278222336 2017-12-21 11:47:41 UTC <DougTrump16> @TRobinsonNewEra 3 hours they determined mental health caused the crime. Hour 1 detained, questioned on scene determined id' & taken in custody. Hour 2 in custody waiting for paperwork to be processed & a hand over. Drug testing completed Hour 3 Likely receiving medical treatment/assessment  
943806090264829952 2017-12-21 11:31:21 UTC <DougTrump16> @twinfold It takes more than 3 hours to assess if mental health issues caused a crime. You also have drug testing both urine & blood. He would also be receiving medical treatment/assessment. If you think that all happens in 3 hours with police then come over Sunday, we will wait for Santa!
943803791760965634 2017-12-21 11:22:13 UTC <DougTrump16> @VictoriaPolice @abcnews In 3 hours they determined mental health issues caused it. While Ivan Milat with history of mental health issues tried for years to do the same.  
943803211663548416 2017-12-21 11:19:55 UTC <DougTrump16> @twinfold "Acting" is the perfect word.   So in 3 hours they determined the crime was committed to mental health issues   Ivan Milat has tried to plead insanity for years with mental health history to back it up.

943796447119523840 2017-12-21 10:53:02 UTC <DougTrump16> @bullshit_hero Jumping to conclusions is issueing a statement about the suspects mental health this quick. Issuing a statement that drugs/ice were a factor so fast. It's way too fast to release those "facts". Ice users do not plow cars into people then get reported as calmly talking to police.
943794410025771008 2017-12-21 10:44:56 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust @pm_live If ice was a factor. This man has the best skin and least sunken eyes I have seen on an ice addict.

943791608452890625 2017-12-21 10:33:48 UTC <DougTrump16> @bullshit_hero I will add, if this goes down the "ice" track the driver has the best skin and least sunken eyes I have ever seen on an ice/meth addict.

943780951833772032 2017-12-21 09:51:28 UTC <DougTrump16> @Sadiya_h14 You got people conscientiously disagreeing with you. Hate would be getting in a vehicle and driving it into you.
943774439551860737 2017-12-21 09:25:35 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews @LarssonNate Yeh that's Brett and Stevo 
943770905150308352 2017-12-21 09:11:32 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews It's safe to assume the drivers name was not Gazza and his passengers name was not Jonno.
943770343893737472 2017-12-21 09:09:19 UTC <DougTrump16> @KTHopkins I can confirm the 2 attackers were not called Gazza & Jonno.

943763857855541249 2017-12-21 08:43:32 UTC <DougTrump16> @bullshit_hero Ok, I'm going to jump to conclusions. I'm eliminating radical Buddhism, Jehovah's Witness, Mormonism, Christianity, Animists, Atheists, Judaism and Hinduism. Call me a tin foil hat wearing conspiracy theorist, that's fair but let's just wait and see.
943761782144876544 2017-12-21 08:35:17 UTC <DougTrump16> @AmyMek @AnonDRGN So what do you think of the guys who caused the mischief?

943649073776672769 2017-12-20 01:07:25 UTC <DougTrump16> @redpillblack An insult based on skin color by a person who most likely would object to being insulted with a race based or skin color based remark. Interesting

When they say why they are confident mostly citing deregulation & upcoming tax cuts. Also market rallies on upcoming tax cuts, investors putting their money where their mouth is. Also Obama blamed Bush 6 years into his admin.

940312824034689025 2017-12-11 20:10:22 UTC <DougTrump16> @CillizzaCNN Reporters are committed to their senior Editor. The senior editor is committed to getting a large audience.

938739139976994816 2017-12-07 11:57:06 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust In 1995 USA signed Jerusalem recognition. Every president since has signed a waiver every 6 months delaying moving their embassy. The world is slow.

Trump spends his own cash to win presidency and loses $300 million since presidency. "It's all about money" Obama starts with $300k & leaves with $40mil 8 years later, not about money. Girl died in your office when you made her head explode

937494678156353536 2017-12-03 01:32:03 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews @perthcommie Good on ya. I rest comfortably knowing I am gainfully employed in 3 nations while you probably struggle to hold a job in one that hasn't had a recession in 25 years. If you have super & it's in a balanced fund, thank Trump for it doing so well in the last 12 months.
937492090522447872 2017-12-03 01:21:46 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews @perthcommie Well as a US citizen given permanent residency status in Australia for some time. Paying taxes in both Countries, owning property in both & working in both countries. I guess I'm doubly privileged then.
937488838628327424 2017-12-03 01:08:51 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews @perthcommie Any reason a commie from WA is commenting on US policies? You need help with self awareness I see.

Well done Australian elites, you have created a political environment where no leader makes a decision. Australia has lost its soul and now just bobs around on the ocean of political trends.
937401537202044928 2017-12-03 19:21:57 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust This is not Tyrion Shortens big political faux pas. It's his work with George Soros.
937400839022321664 2017-12-03 19:19:10 UTC <DougTrump16> @benshapiro Didn't Jesus dismiss the tax argument as trivial? He also said "Don't tax more than you are required to" to a tax collector.

937143965295374336 2017-12-02 02:18:27 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @bwolpe @SkyNewsAust Just so this guy knows. Meeting with major nations diplomats for a president elect is...... normal.  Here is an inconvenient article for your "expert" http://archive.boston.com/news/politics/2008/articles/2008/11/09/obama_chats_with_medvedev_on_phone/
937140094284083200 2017-12-02 02:03:04 UTC <DougTrump16> @zdaniel @abcnews Mueller is done on Trump/Russia. ABC USA suspends newsreader for fake news & Never Trumpers made clowns of themselves dancing to the same Trumps done song they've sung for 2 years. If the PPT had to step in on stock markets, expect prosecutions.
937138881308139520 2017-12-02 01:58:15 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust It doesn't even matter, even Obamas state department admitted they had no issues with the meetings at the time. It's over, Mueller is done on Trump/Russia.
937137802491203584 2017-12-02 01:53:57 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @bwolpe @SkyNewsAust Yesterday, lefties dancing in the streets thinking the "Trumps done" song they've sung for 2 years came true. Today, ABC suspends news reader for fake news tanking stocks. Trump wins.... again

Kind of goes without saying that your puppet will look after you. Also, you would just use the same undetected "collusion" channels.

934315901741961218 2017-11-24 07:00:44 UTC <DougTrump16> @SethAbramson Bring down the US by creating 1.6mil jobs, increasing biz/consumer confidence, adding $6T to stocks, 3.1% GDP, having a glut of child trafficking arrests & bringing down illegal immigration numbers. Seems legit, Putin!

932431062000582656 2017-11-19 02:11:03 UTC <DougTrump16> @nytimesworld Australia has always accepted refugees. As a refugee you find the nearest safe country, seek asylum and respect process. When people just turn up on shore it places pressure on infrastructure, programs & makes it harder on those doing it the right legal way.

930505971830419463 2017-11-14 18:41:26 UTC <DougTrump16> @ChrisCuomo You need to go to police first, file a report, with your lawyer and they will tell you how to prove such a charge. Going to a celebrity lawyer who then goes to a news paper is not the correct answer.

922811764781195264 2017-10-24 13:07:24 UTC <DougTrump16> @redpillblack @FortifySagacity Then you would contact your local police department & make a complaint. Or make a video about that on Yougossip.

922805383562854400 2017-10-24 12:42:02 UTC <DougTrump16> @redpillblack @FortifySagacity So she has not given out anyone's address or private information. I think you are unclear what doxxing is.

922790581599748096 2017-10-24 11:43:13 UTC <DougTrump16> @redpillblack @PrisonPlanet @FortifySagacity Maybe go straight to the person and ask. There's a biblical verse or 2 on that as well. Or one could make Yougossip videos.
922789192018432000 2017-10-24 11:37:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @redpillblack You worked on a site that gave people a digital past & never hid this fact. Now people make videos on you by doing what the site did? Wow

922700893908221952 2017-10-23 05:46:50 UTC <DougTrump16> @PrisonPlanet It's just guilt talking and the longing to control others because they can't control themselves.

922306278944206849 2017-10-22 03:38:47 UTC <DougTrump16> @AmandaRishworth @SkyNewsAust So why does the army have a physical examination when it accepts those with a serious health issue anyway.

922172575454715905 2017-10-22 18:47:29 UTC <DougTrump16> @Tiffany83_ I think that old Chevy will be a rusted out mess. You would have to sand blast it and see what's left.
922169462039576576 2017-10-22 18:35:07 UTC <DougTrump16> @jbouie They still going on this?? How's Russia??

922039754337554432 2017-10-22 09:59:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @JWGOP Yes, he asked all presidents before him to hold off in case he became President and needed a smoke screen.

921834885949435904 2017-10-21 20:25:38 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @td21241 @SebGorka It's actually a tough thing to do but honourable for a President to hear first hand the bad outcomes of US policy, establishes perspective.
921833359029837824 2017-10-21 20:19:34 UTC <DougTrump16> @Shastina_Eloff If this is all they have on you then I'm adopting you. 
921830130456018944 2017-10-21 20:06:44 UTC <DougTrump16> @StefanMolyneux That makes the Presidents point to freeze immigration on people from violent Islamic Nations.

921521048025042944 2017-10-20 23:38:33 UTC <DougTrump16> @holden_aus @7NewsAdelaide A national embarrassment. Politicians and current/former CEO's need to hang their heads in shame.

921519322861748224 2017-10-20 23:31:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @Akamai @SkyNewsAust @brennen_simon No, but they will fund your local politicians to speak out against working class people minimizing their taxes by negative gearing.

916068454590963712 2017-10-05 22:31:53 UTC <DougTrump16> @JaredBeck My liberal friend at work calls me Doug Paddock and I call him James Paddock. Humour, even if sick is a great coping mechanism.
916063374324068352 2017-10-05 22:11:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @LauraLoomer Unless your like me. Just looked at my desk, all  pens on left. I have my laptop here sometimes so mouse on right would hit pens.

916038598197075968 2017-10-05 20:33:15 UTC <DougTrump16> @JackPosobiec How does your little quip inspire so much rage? I thinks they protesteth too much. By next week Kimmel and friends will be on suicide watch.
916036044880875520 2017-10-05 20:23:06 UTC <DougTrump16> @jaredlholt @vadimnewquist @RoamingMil The only shock is your shocked. The other shock that you find being called a White Supremacist offensive. Even Ben Carson is one these days
916034585124683776 2017-10-05 20:17:18 UTC <DougTrump16> @HuevosDeChivo I just dont trust people who's fat tends to favour one side like they've had a fat stroke & when their butt gets so fat the cheeks go pointy

916028731164000256 2017-10-05 19:54:03 UTC <DougTrump16> @BarnsGreg @abcnews I've noticed the more "anti-terror" laws are put in place the more terrorist acts we see. These failure lawmakers, so bad its entertaining.
915912935318241280 2017-10-05 12:13:55 UTC <DougTrump16> @chriskkenny @SkyNewsAust Only the left could see someone target/massacre a conservative & pro NRA crowd and then blame conservatives & NRA. Sick twisted socialists.
915841475514048512 2017-10-05 07:29:57 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews Left wing looney, a Hodgkinson copycat. Politically motivated at least.

915386841771130885 2017-10-03 01:23:24 UTC <DougTrump16> @libertytarian How does a 64 year old male set up a garrison, transport a small arsenal, set up a surveillance centre in a busy hotel and no one notices.
915385932156592128 2017-10-03 01:19:47 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump It's a miracle a 64 year old guy set up an arsenal and a garrison in a busy hotel and noone was any the wiser while also gambling all day.

914803785255415808 2017-10-02 10:46:33 UTC <DougTrump16> @piersmorgan @GaryLineker @KTHopkins Piers is being racist. Indicating white people cant be muslim. He needs to put his bigotry aside.

914800002815242241 2017-10-02 10:31:31 UTC <DougTrump16> @piersmorgan A 64 year old white male can be a muslim. Don't be so bigoted Piers!

914795575643533312 2017-10-02 10:13:55 UTC <DougTrump16> @PrisonPlanet @aassmmaa2018 That's racist and bigoted. Any skin color can be a muslim.
914795244968751105 2017-10-02 10:12:37 UTC <DougTrump16> @PrisonPlanet @deb10102010 Geary is not involved. I'm thinking male adopted relative.

914786410414055424 2017-10-02 09:37:30 UTC <DougTrump16> @MandalayBay @LauraLoomer Perhaps, name withheld could indicate that or law enforcement officer.
914784867371511809 2017-10-02 09:31:22 UTC <DougTrump16> @HuevosDeChivo the mugshot they released of her indicates she has a very good filter on these photos!

914783101644972032 2017-10-02 09:24:21 UTC <DougTrump16> @HuevosDeChivo I was combing the photos on Facebook for a regular liker. 2 or 3 males names regularly liked. 1 was slightly interesting. But...
914782296258994176 2017-10-02 09:21:09 UTC <DougTrump16> @HuevosDeChivo Negative, Geary is married to a lady who looks like Miss Chocksondik in Southpark.
914780005023887361 2017-10-02 09:12:03 UTC <DougTrump16> @HuevosDeChivo By all the likes & comments on photos. Philippine heritage. Usual male "likers" on photos. 1 "No H8er" San Fran, 1 Christian cop. No leads

913859367396556800 2017-09-29 20:13:46 UTC <DougTrump16> @JudgeJeanine But I see strong, successful, eloquent and good women like Ms Porto here. I usually have no idea who their husband is.
913858497216790529 2017-09-29 20:10:19 UTC <DougTrump16> @JudgeJeanine I've noticed something about these pied pipers who constantly use this "women's card". They are hangers onners to their husbands success.
913857834583957504 2017-09-29 20:07:41 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @LauraLoomer To have a leader who has problems & attempts to solve them with alcohol. I've never heard of anyone ever doing that. We dodged a bullet

905254583655469057 2017-09-05 02:21:26 UTC <DougTrump16> @PrisonPlanet Twitter is banning all the intelligent people. It will finally live up to its name.

904892322415915008 2017-09-04 02:21:56 UTC <DougTrump16> @elephantkiller7 @HAGOODMANAUTHOR You fed the troll, man. The art of just telling someone to "get fornicated" and ignoring them is a valuable asset.

900685328905678848 2017-08-24 11:44:50 UTC <DougTrump16> @KiranOpal @OmanReagan What a shame "progressives" never progress from the subject of skin color.
900656168527253505 2017-08-24 09:48:58 UTC <DougTrump16> @allidoisowen I don't know if Owen is sampling too much of the product at Infowars but he is improving with every broadcast. More Shroyer less Cerno!
900626918034231296 2017-08-24 07:52:44 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @abcnews I wonder if the women sexually assaulted and raped by her husband felt a similar sensation.
900624895075262464 2017-08-24 07:44:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @ananavarro A qualified loser, lost at anything you've touched & will always lose at anything you try. Self examination not examining others may help.
900544328904224769 2017-08-23 02:24:33 UTC <DougTrump16> @DRUDGE_REPORT You don't need bombs or bullets to make that a disaster
900543264515801088 2017-08-23 02:20:20 UTC <DougTrump16> @benshapiro @NickRaff85 Never gets old watching this. Showed it to a vegan lefty at work and even he laughed his head off
900539253850910720 2017-08-23 02:04:23 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews Of all the problems facing Indigenous Australians, let's start fixing them by focusing on statues. Stan is nothing but a poverty pimp.

900265752443277312 2017-08-23 07:57:36 UTC <DougTrump16> @LizCrokin @joshdcaplan Alt-left Fascists is the correct term

900261277871755264 2017-08-23 07:39:49 UTC <DougTrump16> @WomenG4Hillary Remember when Obama saw 1000000 jobs added to the economy in 6 months, 4 trillion added to stockmarket, unemployment hit 20 year lows?

900183304846024704 2017-08-22 02:29:59 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews The economy is rebounding and the Alt-left Fascists can't handle it. 
900182066188255232 2017-08-22 02:25:03 UTC <DougTrump16> @__0HOUR1_ I've tried but I just can't warm to the guy.

900181106355458048 2017-08-22 02:21:14 UTC <DougTrump16> @NRA @shannonrwatts I have no problem with it. They are practicing safe handling of their firearms. Member of a gun club also. Even if left aligned, great stuff
900180433630973953 2017-08-22 02:18:34 UTC <DougTrump16> @viaSimonRomero Well it looks like they are practicing responsible safe gun handling procedures. Great stuff guys

900176573101252608 2017-08-22 02:03:14 UTC <DougTrump16> @BreitbartNews He is correct but all he has to do is kiss babies and shakes hands to win. This is his to lose and  language like this is not necessary.
900165723938369536 2017-08-22 01:20:07 UTC <DougTrump16> @Amy_Siskind If the Alt-left Fascists cared about unifying America they would not have made threats and ignored what they don't care for.
900163425472401408 2017-08-22 01:10:59 UTC <DougTrump16> @JackPosobiec @reporterestes @Haywire57 @mitziers Are you obsessed with skin color? I suggest you listen to MLK a bit closer and wake up to yourself.
900084146625589248 2017-08-22 19:55:57 UTC <DougTrump16> @SadlyCatless Didn't you just tweet about internet bullying? Then you post a photoshopped photo of someone you don't like. Self awareness gene is missing
899981133361827840 2017-08-22 13:06:37 UTC <DougTrump16> @DRUDGE_REPORT The Alt-left Fascists are angry. 
899978296024223744 2017-08-22 12:55:21 UTC <DougTrump16> @Acosta Go put some nice poems on statues so they don't get torn down.

899970024659533824 2017-08-22 12:22:29 UTC <DougTrump16> @PaulineHansonOz @SenatorMRoberts @SkyNewsAust @ShergoldTony Yes the word 'Islamophobe', invented mid 70's by Iranan fundamentalist to push state religion. Liberating Iran's women from scenes like thispic.twitter.com/0sACOT7ABM
899966287387910144 2017-08-22 12:07:38 UTC <DougTrump16> @PaulineHansonOz @corybernardi @SkyNewsAust Brandis is an over-actor. Total peer pressured wimp!
899964094588928002 2017-08-22 11:58:55 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust @AnthonyShaw250 Who is Aqsa Parvez? Who are the hundreds of thousands of Iranian women who protested against it in 1979. Their real patriarchs flogged them
899962466951507970 2017-08-22 11:52:27 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust @AnthonyShaw250 What's next, it's so liberal and empowering to have your clitoris removed?? These "empowered" burqa wearers will cop a flogging without one.
899961867543744512 2017-08-22 11:50:04 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust @PlaBg Enjoy watching the beating their husbands/family members give them if they don't wear them. You socially engineered fool!
899961468275249152 2017-08-22 11:48:29 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust Like the hundreds of thousands of woman in Iran who protested the hijab in 1979. Call it what it is, a cage for women!
899954476219383808 2017-08-22 11:20:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @ImDrToxic @V_of_Europe Maybe he should trade his popemobile in for a open convertible
899950160653963264 2017-08-22 11:03:33 UTC <DougTrump16> @TRobinsonNewEra @Abdullah_Azfal Every answer is pretty gay man
899945669388980226 2017-08-22 10:45:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @PaulineHansonOz @SkyNewsAust Outrage over this is ludicrous
899936725228601345 2017-08-22 10:10:09 UTC <DougTrump16> @DRUDGE_REPORT GOP = Alt-DNC
899914038477332482 2017-08-22 08:40:01 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @NicRobertsonCNN @SkyNewsAust No it's logical. Alt-left Chinese Communist propagandist
899907421258170369 2017-08-22 08:13:43 UTC <DougTrump16> @DailyCaller Inane chatter from the alt-left
899888799240433664 2017-08-21 06:59:43 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews "Your girl actin' stank then call me over Not on the bed, lay me on your sofa Phone before you come, I need to shave my chocha". Remarkable
899866080973275137 2017-08-21 05:29:27 UTC <DougTrump16> @irmahinojosa_ That sucks. Ephesians 6:12 says this is intentional from the media. This is a tough war best fought on our knees before the Lord. Much love!
899824532831182848 2017-08-21 02:44:21 UTC <DougTrump16> @KamVTV Personally, I'd like Leonid Brezhnev shoulder some blame. Obama just caught the hot potato, passed it on & it hurts me to defend Obama.
899822173870727168 2017-08-21 02:34:58 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich @roarmittens No, just incapable of loving him as much as he loves himself. I GOT THE THCOOPTH. ME ME ME ME!!
899818809380319232 2017-08-21 02:21:36 UTC <DougTrump16> @roarmittens @Cernovich From the man who didn't know what C.O.G was on a phone call a few weeks ago. 
899815205332410369 2017-08-21 02:07:17 UTC <DougTrump16> @Marmel Simple solution, protest peacefully or ignore his rally if you don't want to hear it. 2 out of 3 aint bad. 
899814765735706624 2017-08-21 02:05:32 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @DC_Resister_Bee If the President comes to Phoenix, we will violently protest because he is hateful. Nice mental triple Lindy 
899783969826193408 2017-08-21 00:03:10 UTC <DougTrump16> @danagould Or you could just ignore it like a grown up. Maybe take someone, wife or kids for a meal. I know, it's a radical idea.
899751828870414336 2017-08-21 21:55:27 UTC <DougTrump16> @cporterwa @BreakfastNews Paid agitators. Be interesting to see his or his significant others bank account.

899739275935105024 2017-08-21 21:05:34 UTC <DougTrump16> @RealTimBlack It would be cut "bigly" if the wrong kind of liberals and wrong kind of democrats turned into the right kind by focusing on new policies.
899738376638570496 2017-08-21 21:01:59 UTC <DougTrump16> @RepublicanChick Every day my timeline is full of bile towards you from "liberals"... I'm overdosing on irony!

899604124223717376 2017-08-21 12:08:31 UTC <DougTrump16> @ImDrToxic @GirlsOfEuropa Funny when Trump goes overseas, he is a rockstar. Except to the EUROPEAN Nazis
899597338854825984 2017-08-21 11:41:33 UTC <DougTrump16> @JackPosobiec What shall we do with the drunken sailors?
899596857701040128 2017-08-21 11:39:39 UTC <DougTrump16> @BNONews So basically just sell your navy Kim, buy container ships and ram the US to smithereens. What, we don't see these monstocities coming?
899595641852116992 2017-08-21 11:34:49 UTC <DougTrump16> @MadcowBAM I will leave you and your 47th chromosome to baffle the internet with your perspicacity.

899582889179860992 2017-08-21 10:44:08 UTC <DougTrump16> @MadcowBAM Back to CNN & The View for you, your social engineering is coming along great. Well done

899485242917961730 2017-08-20 04:16:08 UTC <DougTrump16> @RepublicanChick You have an unhealthy obsession with skin color.
899461816492871680 2017-08-20 02:43:02 UTC <DougTrump16> @MadcowBAM Nazis: Ukrainians your beloved Obama, McCain helped to overthrow legitimately elected government & they couldn't help Hitlery win in return
899459987084165120 2017-08-20 02:35:46 UTC <DougTrump16> @SharronTrump Next month it will be his taxes.. or a woman 30 years ago saying he groped her. Then back to Russia
899451825438380032 2017-08-20 02:03:20 UTC <DougTrump16> @__0HOUR1_ @realDonaldTrump It will get worse if you allow Google, Facebook, Twitter silence voices not aligned with the left. If you do nothing you are inviting it
899432866848808960 2017-08-20 00:48:00 UTC <DougTrump16> @caitoz Would have been a lot tamer to watch the presidential election
899391599934713857 2017-08-20 22:04:01 UTC <DougTrump16> @JackPosobiec 1. Russia failed 2. Nazi failed 3. Health <<-- you are here 4. Sex scandal 5. Presidents raxes  6. Repeat
899390457897033728 2017-08-20 21:59:29 UTC <DougTrump16> @SaraJamesAus @BreakfastNews Haha heard that for 2 years now and the whole time, President Trump looks like he's losing and then he wins.
899378687228825600 2017-08-20 21:12:43 UTC <DougTrump16> @RealAlexJones Put a shirt on!
899377755157966848 2017-08-20 21:09:01 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump Need to address the isolation of non left-aligned political speech online. GAB being shutdown by Googleplay, the start of digital gulags!
899373944938954752 2017-08-20 20:53:52 UTC <DougTrump16> @614swat Next is shut down apps like gab from every platform. Pretty soon it will be impossible to connect with other like-minded people on online.
899358083230474240 2017-08-20 19:50:50 UTC <DougTrump16> @kcoffeeCO @Tree_of_Logic @Minorcomplaint Gee, no need to blow up about it.
899353136598405120 2017-08-20 19:31:11 UTC <DougTrump16> @Tree_of_Logic I got a suspension for saying "nice insight for a whore" to a soft porn actress who tweeted "President Trump is a fuckwad".

899235192245633025 2017-08-20 11:42:31 UTC <DougTrump16> @VABVOX Sorry, the right-wing or conservative  party during Nazi Germany was called Deutschnationale Volkspartei or DNVP. I suggest a better book.
899230069616328706 2017-08-20 11:22:10 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust @MyTakePeople The side that threw bottles of urine at please, yes ANTIFA.
899229568157876226 2017-08-20 11:20:10 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust @1WiseGamer The alleged "Nazi" giving his free speach that was counter protested. Nice try.https://youtu.be/_VpzG5xFThc
899225424659533825 2017-08-20 11:03:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @rhowardbrowne Imagine wanting to run a country and you concede & perceive that a crazy person gave you a shellacking. That's madness!
899222777286152192 2017-08-20 10:53:11 UTC <DougTrump16> @td21241 "Quit it" hahaha. I do like his reaction
899207662503579649 2017-08-20 09:53:07 UTC <DougTrump16> @theinternet89 @GoDaddy Never read the Daily Stormer, never visited it and don't care for it. I disagree with your censorship. Bad work.
899190875342774272 2017-08-20 08:46:25 UTC <DougTrump16> @snopes @JackPosobiec An unhealthy obsession with skin color

896848344890224640 2017-08-13 21:38:02 UTC <DougTrump16> @Millennial_Matt @rafsanchez Delete the Photoshop. You dilute the impact of real racism.
896845908783939584 2017-08-13 21:28:21 UTC <DougTrump16> @badboy129 @realDonaldTrump Investigate why there was a police standown! Bring those responsible to account and under the media spotlight
896844958602215424 2017-08-13 21:24:35 UTC <DougTrump16> @FoxNews @TrumpsWolf @JohnCooper0610 The police standown is a disgrace. When people cant rely on reasonable justice they will get it unreasonably. Justice is society's oxygen
896841054988546048 2017-08-13 21:09:04 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @npomalley @SkyNewsAust Trump admin: DOJ - Jeff Sessions is pursuing the death penalty of James Alex Fields for terrorism. The activist you have isn't an expert
896839848018845696 2017-08-13 21:04:16 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust Says Jeff Sessions pursuing the death penalty
896822618602393600 2017-08-13 19:55:49 UTC <DougTrump16> @bakedalaska I'm prepared to pass on my reparations from the monarchs of Europe for my serfdom when the money comes through.
896820085842616320 2017-08-13 19:45:45 UTC <DougTrump16> @Timcast President Trump was driving the car.
896707999074353154 2017-08-13 12:20:21 UTC <DougTrump16> @pwafork @SkyNewsAust Just an infomercial to sell THAAD. Kim loves his life & loves his family shrine. He doesn't want it all destroyed. India/China though 
896705761790775297 2017-08-13 12:11:28 UTC <DougTrump16> @marklevinshow He called it out suitably. If all Rubio has to improve things is a better glossary of terms no wonder why his rallies were like baptisms.
896704748182622208 2017-08-13 12:07:26 UTC <DougTrump16> @Acosta People I don't associate with. Maybe you could hire a bus, pick them up, take them to the Statue of Liberty & read poetry.

896701658805051392 2017-08-13 11:55:10 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump didn't say "terrorist" and neither did @BarackObama  describing Dallas Police shootings. I'm too old to play Simon Says. 
896700912516726784 2017-08-13 11:52:12 UTC <DougTrump16> @td21241 People arguing over a glossary of terms, ridiculous.

896667734666170368 2017-08-13 09:40:21 UTC <DougTrump16> @LauraLoomer Glossary of terms is unimportant. It's important is to keep up the debate, keep it respectful & peaceful. Prayers for those involved.

892176516754268160 2017-07-31 00:13:52 UTC <DougTrump16> @YouTube @HAGOODMANAUTHOR An unwatchable neurotic mess
892176423678492672 2017-07-31 00:13:29 UTC <DougTrump16> @YouTube @HAGOODMANAUTHOR Alex is living in a very narrow space in his head. He loves labels & his neurons are incapable of processing someone not living up to them.
892172874282184705 2017-07-31 23:59:23 UTC <DougTrump16> @Timcast You what journalism use to be. What I choose not to watch on TV these days, is Alt (alternative). I agree, need a new hat though
892171916819128321 2017-07-31 23:55:35 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich @SirGone Yes, he committed political hari kari with the New Yorker. It was deliberate.
892171171239612416 2017-07-31 23:52:37 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich Telling a journalist "off the record" a colleague performs fellatio on themselves was so dumb it had to be deliberate. Position untenable!
892166971382300672 2017-07-31 23:35:56 UTC <DougTrump16> @POTUS @RealAlexJones It would be a positive move.

892162855222386688 2017-07-31 23:19:34 UTC <DougTrump16> @PrisonPlanet He wants police to take a leaf out of his book and beat their wives instead.
892156750240952321 2017-07-31 22:55:19 UTC <DougTrump16> @_Makada_ Now it's time to put Pickle in

892150254094528512 2017-07-31 22:29:30 UTC <DougTrump16> @ANTHONYBLOGAN I  Mooch but making a position untenable by telling a journalist a staff member performs fellatio on himself was so dumb it was deliberate
892141471729504256 2017-07-31 21:54:36 UTC <DougTrump16> @conorduffynews @abcnews Great news, no more Priebus. Trump fans, still a massive win.

892140272527618048 2017-07-31 21:49:50 UTC <DougTrump16> @zdaniel @BreakfastNews You just can't accuse fellow staff of performing fellatio on themselves when just starting a job. Glad he took out Reince!
892137780934975488 2017-07-31 21:39:56 UTC <DougTrump16> @Imamofpeace Your trip down Haldon Street Lakemba reminded me of its divine aroma of bakeries and spices. Best smelling street in the world!

892121369210527744 2017-07-31 20:34:43 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich I'd say the telegraph, radio, television, telephone & internet are just a tad more significant.
892120368130924544 2017-07-31 20:30:45 UTC <DougTrump16> @StefanMolyneux I think firing people who suggest other staff perform filatio on themselves to a journalist is also a selling point.
892112457602260994 2017-07-31 19:59:19 UTC <DougTrump16> @LauraLoomer I'm glad to have shared this short time with him. It was a great fireworks show
892112045893574656 2017-07-31 19:57:41 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich The Mooch was the John McEnroe of the Trump administration
892111294219771905 2017-07-31 19:54:41 UTC <DougTrump16> @benshapiro The Steve Bannon comment was game over. Will he go for a Sean Hannity type next. Someone who fights angry all day without the gutter mouth.
892110228170301441 2017-07-31 19:50:27 UTC <DougTrump16> @NolteNC Scud Scaramucci did his job.
892109647309488128 2017-07-31 19:48:09 UTC <DougTrump16> Who is #president @realDonaldTrump next Communications Director, @seanhannity ?
892104317649297408 2017-07-31 19:26:58 UTC <DougTrump16> @WhiteHouse @TruNews I dare say the Bannon comment was the fumble that lost the game.

891981487280496640 2017-07-31 11:18:53 UTC <DougTrump16> @chelseahandler If only you could drill down into the objection from military, overcome the objection instead of just screaming "hate". You will never win

891974530217816068 2017-07-31 10:51:14 UTC <DougTrump16> @Lauren_Southern @Partisangirl @ramenonfire To be honest, most Christians would see it shake their heads and think no more of it. Most worry about worse evils.

891844427781554176 2017-07-30 02:14:15 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich You stop winning debates with feelings when you are midway through puberty. Cenk is a picture of arrested development.
891842792682528768 2017-07-30 02:07:46 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich She succumbed to Trump Derangement Syndrome. The @newtgingrich interview and Pennsylvania tirade was the tipping point and end.

890448206504407040 2017-07-26 05:46:10 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust @MahendraSason Injustice for medical conditions that require ongoing medication. Your civil (civilian) rights dont matter to the military, sorry.
890447711496847360 2017-07-26 05:44:12 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust Like almost all medical conditions that require ongoing regular medication, you will fail the medical.
890437570567454720 2017-07-26 05:03:55 UTC <DougTrump16> @MsBlaireWhite Transexuals require regulat HRT. Like almost all medical conditions that require regular medication you will fail the physical.
890416199267303424 2017-07-26 03:38:59 UTC <DougTrump16> @td21241 @BasedMonitored Joining the military? Civil Rights do not exist. If you want them, remain a civilian.
890398601561595904 2017-07-26 02:29:04 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich Joining the military is not dislike joining a sovereign state under martial law. Stupid to assume all of your civil rights come with you.
890396847197503489 2017-07-26 02:22:05 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews Sorry Ms Beck, what are the symptoms in the event your HRT is not available? Oh yeh someone heavily armed prone to anxiety/depression. 
890395729075683328 2017-07-26 02:17:39 UTC <DougTrump16> @christopherneff @abcnews If a transwoman stops her HRT which is highly likely on duty. She will be prone to anxiety/depression. Dangerous to her & others, not good
890394831612125185 2017-07-26 02:14:05 UTC <DougTrump16> @christopherneff @abcnews You join the military, you do not join a democracy. You join a sovereign state under martial law. Your civil rights are no longer assumed.
890392365617119233 2017-07-26 02:04:17 UTC <DougTrump16> @POTUS @irmahinojosa_ Trans. need HRT. This may not always be possible to supply on duty. Transwomen for example are prone to anxiety/depression when stopping HRT
890390442864287744 2017-07-26 01:56:38 UTC <DougTrump16> @Rambobiggs President is head of 2 states. The USA and The Military. The Military is not democratic its closer to a dictatorship.
890381333003776000 2017-07-26 01:20:26 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews @PomBast Stop trying to apply civilian law to the military. They have their own legal system. All in military are required to be fight ready.
890353921104855040 2017-07-26 23:31:31 UTC <DougTrump16> @Rambobiggs Anyone who requires daily medication in the military is not a good idea. Someone tell these people civilian laws dont apply to military
890345921401180160 2017-07-26 22:59:44 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @abcnews Transsexuals require daily medication that can't always be supplied in some situations during service. Endangering themselves & others
890344494779875328 2017-07-26 22:54:04 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @abcnews @DrSachaSB You may be shocked but there are clear legal differences between being military/civilian. Not all civilian law crosses over. So it's you
890328559591374848 2017-07-26 21:50:44 UTC <DougTrump16> @Tree_of_Logic Money issue aside. Adds another responsibility/logistics issue which your enemies most likely won't have. Giving the enemy a free point.
890326242192351232 2017-07-26 21:41:32 UTC <DougTrump16> @Tree_of_Logic Transgenders require daily medication. Some service situations, may not be possible to supply. Hormonal changes in these times, big problem!
890325171667587072 2017-07-26 21:37:17 UTC <DougTrump16> @thehill We should let people in that require daily medication, which in some situations won't be supplied for extended periods of time? Smart
890323393140056064 2017-07-26 21:30:12 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich Including Drudge
890320824124678146 2017-07-26 21:20:00 UTC <DougTrump16> @irmahinojosa_ There is upkeep/medication required by transgender people. Can't guarantee to supply in some areas of required service. Health issue

890081360555233280 2017-07-25 05:28:27 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich He has dirt on DWS. She looked under a lot of stress in that meeting with DC police

890037061159272448 2017-07-25 02:32:26 UTC <DougTrump16> @libertytarian @omgMyCat And so does Drudge. He is dodging it

890021334264066048 2017-07-25 01:29:56 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews @CliffBr8163621 After seeing what happened, I wonder if anyone checked
890014421694562305 2017-07-25 01:02:28 UTC <DougTrump16> @peterjukes This is an outrage! Let me look into this. How many Democrats have been shot?  Oh wait...
890009502048583680 2017-07-25 00:42:55 UTC <DougTrump16> @RogerJStoneJr At least we know you aren't related to Psycho Joe Scarborough.
890002106291113986 2017-07-25 00:13:32 UTC <DougTrump16> @RealAlexJones I'm thinking there may be a twist or 2 left.
889998915117789188 2017-07-25 00:00:51 UTC <DougTrump16> @TheRebelTV @ADL_National @LauraLoomer Keep pushing! These orgs. & their "lists" are often referred to with other like leftust groups in media to push untrue narratives. 
889992622462312448 2017-07-25 23:35:51 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust Attack = honest public assessment that a lot of Americans agree with.
889968427724664832 2017-07-25 21:59:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews Going to report on arrests on former DNC head @DWStweets aide who was trying to flee the country? Massive news
889961297642532864 2017-07-25 21:31:22 UTC <DougTrump16> @LauraLoomer It interests you then you dig. Personally, I haven't worried about lists since Santa's "naughty or nice" list that's checked twice.Go hard!
889955137409531904 2017-07-25 21:06:53 UTC <DougTrump16> @Scaramucci @realDonaldTrump @Cernovich And Drudge is avoiding it
889953768149721088 2017-07-25 21:01:27 UTC <DougTrump16> @BreakfastNews No, it is a reasonable expectation. What needs to change is morons not doing their homework before putting themselves forward.
889933241703989248 2017-07-25 19:39:53 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich Can you explain why Drudge is avoiding this?
889932863654600704 2017-07-25 19:38:23 UTC <DougTrump16> @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @abcnews Tirade = honestly sharing his opinion.
889821961987121157 2017-07-25 12:17:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @EWErickson No requesting any investigations, indictments or charging as a president or your children will suffer. (How the swamp got so murky)
889818607286239233 2017-07-25 12:04:22 UTC <DougTrump16> @Thomas1774Paine Drudge is avoiding this, odd.
889816029026598915 2017-07-25 11:54:07 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust Apple Trust Google Trust Facebook Trust Be interesting to see if $$$ moves from these companies to politicians to crack down on others taxes
889815183941451776 2017-07-25 11:50:46 UTC <DougTrump16> @benshapiro Or he has had a gut full. Pretty dumb tweet for you.

889813290116726785 2017-07-25 11:43:14 UTC <DougTrump16> @kylegriffin1 Well to be exact, he is saying that the acting head has a conflict of interest. It also would be "accusing".
889810419820273666 2017-07-25 11:31:50 UTC <DougTrump16> @jpodhoretz Trump Admin: Jobs Up, unemployment down,food stamp usage down, $4.1T added to stocks. DNC: Losing elections, donors down, In debt

889799210760978432 2017-07-25 10:47:18 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump My head says "Delete your account" but my heart says "Good to see McCain back at work".

889794647135891456 2017-07-25 10:29:10 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews @WritingMum And the boy scouts cheered their President!  Its ok, you can give your kids Teen Vogue & they can read about anal sex to make you proud.

889779764709294080 2017-07-25 09:30:01 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews Probably had duel citizen Prime Ministers in the past. Gillard was from Wales

889765686444032000 2017-07-25 08:34:05 UTC <DougTrump16> @POTUS @chucktodd Should Trump have A. Talked anal sex like teen vogue B. Asked who wants to cut off their penis C. Discuss politics, being a political figure
889760733818376192 2017-07-25 08:14:24 UTC <DougTrump16> @mattjcan @SkyNewsAust At this rate we could have @NovaPeris comeback as Prime Minister of Australia. 
889754283687591937 2017-07-25 07:48:46 UTC <DougTrump16> @MarkDice Left: The Pres.(a political figure) should not talk to young men about politics & current news. Like Teen Vogue, he should discuss anal sex!
889752447236792320 2017-07-25 07:41:28 UTC <DougTrump16> @kurteichenwald @JulianAssange @TerryMendozer I was banned for a strobe tweet.  Heavy casualties were taken that day in the great Meme War I remember my fallen comrade Jew Goldstein
889750408603631617 2017-07-25 07:33:22 UTC <DougTrump16> @bradripka Talked a lot of young MEN about politics. Scouts would rather hear about that than Teen Vogue's tips on anal sex or cutting of your wanger!
889748963531685890 2017-07-25 07:27:38 UTC <DougTrump16> @MVincentOZ @abcnews Hey ABC, why dont you report on Democrat Tulsi Gabbard & her support of Trump ending CIA program to fund/arm/train Syrian rebels? ITS NEWS!
889748437389922304 2017-07-25 07:25:32 UTC <DougTrump16> @MVincentOZ @abcnews How dare a president talk about politics & issues of the day! Maybe he should have read from Teen Vogue & the finer points of anal sex?
889739059450363904 2017-07-24 06:48:16 UTC <DougTrump16> So he has let the 2 people go? No, then they are held hostage.
889735396166258688 2017-07-24 06:33:43 UTC <DougTrump16> @kurteichenwald @ElizabethleaVos @WLTaskForce @war_drums Speak of yourself highly, be short and rude to the person inquiring & use a different voice. Good luck in your new role 
889725116262760448 2017-07-24 05:52:52 UTC <DougTrump16> @ColumbiaBugle The left wanted him to just read from Teen Vogue on the finer points of sodomy or ask "who wants to cut their Johnson off?"
889722319727345666 2017-07-24 05:41:45 UTC <DougTrump16> Factcheck please @snopes   If i donate to your @gofundme , will it be spent on prostitutes?

889702266407501828 2017-07-24 04:22:04 UTC <DougTrump16> @PGourevitch So true, President Trump should have taken a leaf out of Teen Vogue and talked to the kids about anal sex instead of politics.
889698187434278912 2017-07-24 04:05:52 UTC <DougTrump16> @CharlesPPierce If Teen Vogue can teach kids about the finer points of sodomy and buggery then Trump can talk to kids about politics.
889693212339707904 2017-07-24 03:46:06 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust There should be jail to go with that
889686719389356032 2017-07-24 03:20:18 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews @jer_hil He won't be impeached. This is like those polls the ABC kept putting up for 12 months saying Trump couldn't win. They lie to you
889686224021016576 2017-07-24 03:18:20 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews They look at his 3rd grade school reports and found that he had a Russian teacher! The ABC are truly stupid!

889635862463557633 2017-07-24 23:58:12 UTC <DougTrump16> @DRUDGE_REPORT Sessions will be fine. Political games to look like the slowest moving animal before one strikes.

889618025586069506 2017-07-24 22:47:20 UTC <DougTrump16> @jeffjarvis @BreakfastNews 1. Fire your senior editors.  2.. Hire journalists not activists.  3. Know your biggest competition are the mobile newsrooms in our hands

889592292784259072 2017-07-24 21:05:05 UTC <DougTrump16> @DRUDGE_REPORT Is there a reason Drudge is avoiding the reporting of Awan raids.
889575662402404352 2017-07-24 19:59:00 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews For the crime he is guilty of, even Charles Manson could issue a pardon for that.

889382224646160384 2017-07-24 07:10:20 UTC <DougTrump16> @jcnerd @SkyNewsAust Read his tweets, a total Trump troll. He "suspects" & "wouldn't be surprised". So besides his feelings he offers no evidence. #BULLSHITNEWS

889353161848180736 2017-07-23 05:14:51 UTC <DougTrump16> @stranahan But Trump/Russia is a deflection on Clinton losing because she was vile, corrupt & voters knew it. Deflecting back is not really deflection

889310648970076160 2017-07-23 02:25:55 UTC <DougTrump16> @TurnbullMalcolm @billshortenmp @SkyNewsAust Meanwhile, Australians watch jobs going overseas while their politicians say"We'll do more stuff if our jobs were more secure". Disgraceful!
889309759500898305 2017-07-23 02:22:23 UTC <DougTrump16> @billshortenmp @SkyNewsAust Maybe he needs to concentrate on job security for those in shrinking manufacturing sector in Australia not his own job security. Bad move!

889226288845660160 2017-07-23 20:50:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @BreakfastNews The problem is Australia has only had politicians not leaders since Howard, Keating and Hawke. Nothing to do with term lengths.

888950142992228352 2017-07-22 02:33:24 UTC <DougTrump16> @SkyNewsAust It's what he is being pushed to. I say Mueller & his Clinton donating appointees will be removed very soon. He won't need to pardon.

885043177215885313 2017-07-12 07:48:31 UTC <DougTrump16> @bwolpe @scotfaulkner53 @abcnews So how about reporting on Syrian cease fire? No? I thought so by the Globalist Propaganda franchise that Australians pay for.
885041618197372928 2017-07-12 07:42:19 UTC <DougTrump16> @JackPosobiec Jnr was just guilty of being trolled & rickrolled. He was reminded of one of lifes lessons."If it seems too good to be true, it probably is"
885040376725327873 2017-07-12 07:37:23 UTC <DougTrump16> @brianstelter Well done on cracking the big case. Trump Jr is guilty of being trolled and Rickrolled. Meanwhile Trump is still your 45!
885035002517491712 2017-07-12 07:16:02 UTC <DougTrump16> @DonaldJTrumpJr @tomcoates "Wrong" unfortunately is legal. Unfairly within the law even. Practiced by all. Who is Roger Stone. Who is Sidney Blumenthal. Who is 45?
885034190089093121 2017-07-12 07:12:48 UTC <DougTrump16> @Harkaway @tomcoates Well do some homework you mental hobbit.
885033491301314560 2017-07-12 07:10:02 UTC <DougTrump16> @Harkaway @tomcoates You seriously have no idea why Russians would want Trump to win do you?
885032098242994176 2017-07-12 07:04:29 UTC <DougTrump16> @KeithOlbermann Well done, you cracked the case of Donald Trump Jr being trolled. Unfortunately, you still have President 45! 
885031389057478657 2017-07-12 07:01:40 UTC <DougTrump16> @DonaldJTrumpJr @tomcoates And the problem with Russia wanting him to win? It's still legal!!
885031126678503424 2017-07-12 07:00:38 UTC <DougTrump16> @DonaldJTrumpJr Well I'm sorry to say but you are so guilty. Guilty of being trolled by a "Russian"!  If its too good to be true, it probably is.
885030084121432064 2017-07-11 06:56:29 UTC <DougTrump16> @JYSexton He had a meeting with a "Russian" for dirt on Hillary and she talked about adoption, he left. Donald Trump Jr guilty of being trolled. 
885014988867469313 2017-07-11 05:56:30 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews @PersevereEver The DNC were supposed to be smart by covering  the money trail paying her and deleting the photos of her with DNC campaign shortly after.

884748908848599041 2017-07-11 12:19:12 UTC <DougTrump16> @alimoore004 @abcnews Oh wow, how did this happen? How did that cease fire happen in Syria?
884742722451423232 2017-07-11 11:54:37 UTC <DougTrump16> @unimelb @abcnews For 2 years Australian Bullshitting Communists spread the "Trumps Done" propaganda. For 2 years been constantly wrong. Change the song

884630428832993281 2017-07-10 04:28:24 UTC <DougTrump16> @SethAbramson 2 years of "Trumps done" after "Trumps done". Addicted to disappointments? 
884600919400169472 2017-07-10 02:31:08 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews So, how about the Syrian ceasefire....
884596194680295425 2017-07-10 02:12:22 UTC <DougTrump16> @DonaldJTrumpJr @Cernovich @JeffreyLLowery I'm about to break a big story that Barron plays Call Of Duty online with Russians. Just checking my sources first.
884595749396271104 2017-07-10 02:10:36 UTC <DougTrump16> @DonaldJTrumpJr @Cernovich At least they changed from "Former and Current WH Officials" to "3 people who saw". I saw that and stopped reading.

881999272962441216 2017-07-03 22:13:08 UTC <DougTrump16> @benshapiro I suggest he labelled the false teachers of the day in a caustic and contemptuous way. A "brood of vipers" comes to mind.
881995965749641216 2017-07-03 21:59:59 UTC <DougTrump16> @benshapiro I particularly like the graceful way Jesus handled the outwardly obsessed Pharisees. He was an abrasive name caller.
881994801905717249 2017-07-03 21:55:22 UTC <DougTrump16> @benshapiro I'm sure you will be ok. The political unicorn does not exist, remember that. Jobs are up, stocks are up, illegal immigration down. Smile

881951653389254660 2017-07-03 19:03:54 UTC <DougTrump16> @StephenKing Stick to writing fanciful stories. Maybe you could write one about an author who has a head thats been to close to Chernobyl.

881625428397404160 2017-07-02 21:27:36 UTC <DougTrump16> Better a President who responds in kind publicly than a President who uses ways unseen. Yes, the President punches back like a New Yorker.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/881503147168071680

881524563158343680 2017-07-02 14:46:48 UTC <DougTrump16> @RedPilledWorld @realDonaldTrump You do know that it's a matter of time before a journalist/Media personality suicides and blames you. I need pop corn.
881523984231145474 2017-07-02 14:44:30 UTC <DougTrump16> I'm wondering how long before a journalist commits suicide and blames Trump.
881523696766038016 2017-07-02 14:43:21 UTC <DougTrump16> @Acosta Jim, you are melting down boy. Develop some emotional resilience. I'm wondering how long before a journalist kills themselves.
881521548993060865 2017-07-02 14:34:49 UTC <DougTrump16> @benshapiro @viking4125 @gioman62 Unfortunately the media bully pulpit is public & the war has to be fought in public. You will be ok.
881520825001693184 2017-07-02 14:31:57 UTC <DougTrump16> @benshapiro I'd rather the President who responds in kind in a way we can all see than the "presidential" President who responds in ways we can't.

881234903051849728 2017-07-01 19:35:48 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @jackschofield Working in Australia this is crap. Australians laugh at democrats even most Labor voters. They interviewed media looking at those numbers
881234375714553856 2017-07-01 19:33:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @jackschofield Poor Jack, he talks too much but says so little. Learn a new skill, brevity.

881073006423924736 2017-07-01 08:52:28 UTC <DougTrump16> @Some_BlackGuy I'm not interested in the stats. I deal with people on their actions not the expectation. If you're lucky I may notice your skin colour.
881021287920877568 2017-06-30 05:26:58 UTC <DougTrump16> @FLOTUS @jaketapper If you think as you can use your platforms to constantly insult the President & cry "bully" when he responds in kind, you're unhinged!
881017397825622016 2017-06-30 05:11:30 UTC <DougTrump16> @POTUS @DiamondandSilk @TheSocialPlan_ Haha I think those 2 reprobates who buckled when the President responded in kind are the cry babies. Add another 2 to the "He broke me" list
881016951987884032 2017-06-30 05:09:44 UTC <DougTrump16> @POTUS @HoytSue @DiamondandSilk It's a universal law that when someone insults you, then you may insult back. The President Is not above & is certainly not below this law.

878324964448796672 2017-06-23 18:52:44 UTC <DougTrump16> @TRobinsonNewEra Your government is compromised. They are pretty much all blackmailed. They are accountable to someone else now, not the voter.

877995822968823808 2017-06-22 21:04:51 UTC <DougTrump16> @Timcast @jaketapper Like having a bank robbed while security guard sleeps. Then ask the security guard to investigate the robbery. DNC had something to hide!

877712221538664449 2017-06-21 02:17:55 UTC <DougTrump16> @AmericanMex067 Is the extra .4% Ossoffs family out of town voting against him? Or are the media puffing his percentage up
877602503809916930 2017-06-21 19:01:56 UTC <DougTrump16> @d_seaman You should have told them what you really think

877385994495860736 2017-06-20 04:41:36 UTC <DougTrump16> @RadioFreeTom @stealthygeek Then you watch the breaking news, "Man screams 'Allahu akbar' and commits a massacre.". Then you tweet #notallmuslims. Wake up to youself.

877350059548884992 2017-06-20 02:18:49 UTC <DougTrump16> @DonaldJTrumpJr It's an immoral loss. Spending all that money on a ring in and it cops a shellacking!
877349628156362752 2017-06-20 02:17:06 UTC <DougTrump16> @SoCal4Trump Democrats throwing other people's money to get results..... and they fail!!!
877307536961003520 2017-06-20 23:29:51 UTC <DougTrump16> @TRobinsonNewEra Is Katy Perry offering you "terrorists" a hug too?
877303272570183680 2017-06-20 23:12:54 UTC <DougTrump16> @tariqnasheed @w_terrence He is a disgraceful failure. He could succeed as a comedian though. The more serious he is the funnier he gets.

876932861256794112 2017-06-19 22:41:01 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich Bit of 'obstruction' there.
876922683702689792 2017-06-19 22:00:34 UTC <DougTrump16> @Rambobiggs BURN HIM AT THE STAKE!!
876891890573950976 2017-06-19 19:58:13 UTC <DougTrump16> Why media has no credibility. 1. Outrage over interview with (at worst a conspiracy theorist) @RealAlexJones  2. No outrage over this.
876763913773228033 2017-06-19 11:29:41 UTC <DougTrump16> @salawm Half truth becomes a full lie.

876743682187067392 2017-06-19 10:09:17 UTC <DougTrump16> @PrisonPlanet It's not hypocracy. His job like all lefties is to play the victim, he's consistent 
876743280209272832 2017-06-19 10:07:41 UTC <DougTrump16> @TRobinsonNewEra @TCrossland55 There isn't one. There might be some football hooliganism with a gut full of Stella, at best!

876722578202574848 2017-06-19 08:45:26 UTC <DougTrump16> @jk_rowling You went too far back in time numpty. The last month was radicalising enough. Stick to writing fanciful tales for kids, grown ups are talkin
876718837852381184 2017-06-19 08:30:34 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews @dannykong88 Like the stock market up, jobs up, unemployment down, pedophile arrests up, illegal immigration Down, business confidence up kind of karma?
876718376076189698 2017-06-19 08:28:44 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews Hahaha look at everyone calling you Communist lackeys out.
876718206781603840 2017-06-19 08:28:03 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews ABC uses trigger words like "Cries" and "Tirade" to enable and promote left wing deep state narrative and psyop. Wonders why audience drops.

876633677228253184 2017-06-18 02:52:10 UTC <DougTrump16> @RealAlexJones @seanhannity @oliverdarcy Like a true lefty he misses context, intended meaning & then interprets the most emotional/offensive meaning of a statement.

876603605884715008 2017-06-18 00:52:40 UTC <DougTrump16> @TRobinsonNewEra @mshafiquk I disagree on a lot of what Mr Robinson says but never have I heard him encourage violent acts on the innocent people. Pull your head in
876599347453976576 2017-06-18 00:35:45 UTC <DougTrump16> @GeorgeTakei I'm sure someone could rewrite literature to unfairly fuel an anti-gay narrative. Would you maintain the same stance?
876577263013175296 2017-06-18 23:08:00 UTC <DougTrump16> @Timcast What's worse is they are watching Megyn Kelly. A honey trap from the deep state.
876562907743387648 2017-06-18 22:10:57 UTC <DougTrump16> @StefanMolyneux I don't speak this sorcery. What in the dickens is she saying?
876559277426524160 2017-06-18 21:56:32 UTC <DougTrump16> @KimDotcom You need to release what you have. They won't listen to a 'crook' when it's not in their favour.

876035868661760001 2017-06-17 11:16:41 UTC <DougTrump16> @tariqnasheed @LauraLoomer He calls every person that isn't washing his feet names like that. It's the quantitative easing of insults and has lost any shock value

875985428452491265 2017-06-17 07:56:15 UTC <DougTrump16> @RepublicanChick @LauraLoomer Hahaha. Great stuff.

875959438498086913 2017-06-16 06:12:59 UTC <DougTrump16> @PublicTheaterNY @kchirbas Unoriginal, unshocking & uninspiring work from the court jesters. Their performance displayed the same level of talent as 'Blue Poles' 1/10
875955723728896000 2017-06-16 05:58:13 UTC <DougTrump16> @placeboing Hey man, I need a song. It's good for what ails me.
875955483873497088 2017-06-16 05:57:16 UTC <DougTrump16> @DavidAFrench @LauraLoomer You interfered with a bunch of hysterical anxiety suffering losers & court jesters having their artistic form of a pity party. Great job!
875925129632530433 2017-06-16 03:56:39 UTC <DougTrump16> @votevets @AynRandPaulRyan @aamandaaa_h @Ricardo_Gozinya @Realchristine4 @BrandonTXNeely You are correct however he is also not below the law. He has the right to remove those he doesn't wish to hear.
875924104666243073 2017-06-16 03:52:35 UTC <DougTrump16> @votevets @BrandonTXNeely Never. You may write letters, read other publications, make phone calls, watch news or even attend his rallies.
875923474283249664 2017-06-16 03:50:04 UTC <DougTrump16> @votevets You're not silenced. You may write a letter or make phone calls. Stop being dramatic.
875922786601926656 2017-06-16 03:47:20 UTC <DougTrump16> @LauraLoomer I love your message girl but the screaming made me nauseas & anxious. Oh well, I guess I can take that for the team. Much love to you!
875914030673559552 2017-06-16 03:12:33 UTC <DougTrump16> @StefanMolyneux @JackPosobiec Think how much money these fools are wasting to be enabled. There are free remedies to anxiety & hysteria. Rant over, I'm going for a walk!
875907846054920192 2017-06-16 02:47:58 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich Gee, can you guys disagree without walking down this track? Carrying on a bit.
875898085444014080 2017-06-16 02:09:11 UTC <DougTrump16> @StefanMolyneux With a flacid Trump in the WH he is asking for it.He should be releasing an army of lawyers turning lives upside down of these recalcitrants
875889487007563778 2017-06-16 01:35:01 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump Operation Black Lagoon is a go.
875885937535860736 2017-06-16 01:20:55 UTC <DougTrump16> @d_seaman My shares in twisties would go up too :)
875884698131587072 2017-06-16 01:15:59 UTC <DougTrump16> @d_seaman Never touched cannabis in my life. Making it legal isnt going to make me light up a reefer. Making it criminal makes no sense to even me.

875862524658188288 2017-06-16 23:47:53 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr We have nearly seen enough now. Tell daddy "It's time for Operation Black Lagoon. Get the keys ready". He will understand.
875840535889444865 2017-06-16 22:20:30 UTC <DougTrump16> @HAGOODMANAUTHOR When Bill says "How are the Grandkids?" That's code for "If you don't ......... then they are dead!". They talked about grand kids and stuff
875839626501513216 2017-06-16 22:16:53 UTC <DougTrump16> @StaceyNAlex @atxcindy @pemersonvb111 @steph93065 @mlehrjava Ive seen this for 2 years now. As the crowds think he is done & move in. He drops a MOAB!!! The 'Trumps done' song goes back to the start.
875838750370156544 2017-06-16 22:13:25 UTC <DougTrump16> @BlackBlocBoi Nothing is free. Universal fact!
875837828042637312 2017-06-16 22:09:45 UTC <DougTrump16> @HAGOODMANAUTHOR @KimDotcom You will be ignored, Leak it. You need to crap or get off the pot. Or is it just for likes and retweets. If so, good job!

875836557743104000 2017-06-16 22:04:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump You invited this, you were convinced to go in with a soft tone "Hillary suffered enough". Your kindness has become weakness. GET HARDCORE!!
875833832821227522 2017-06-16 21:53:52 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @abcnews @TennieBam Yes, stock market is higher, unemployment is down, tax revenue is up, illegal aliens down, jobs up, pedophile arrests up. Bad stuff
875832942475399168 2017-06-16 21:50:20 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @abcnews The song 'Trumps done' plays for 2 years on repeat the left loonies always come in cluster for a look. Trump then detonates the bomb. 
875830924121735168 2017-06-16 21:42:19 UTC <DougTrump16> @Rockprincess818 @polNewsForever I feel that way, YES!!! Just my body saying I need to poo. I was lucky & recognised the symptoms when I was young. Learnt to use potty too!
875829634507563008 2017-06-16 21:37:11 UTC <DougTrump16> @LouiseMensch Still no news on impeachment, no? See you tomorrow then

875705272093687809 2017-06-16 13:23:01 UTC <DougTrump16> @StephenKing @kurteichenwald You can write the President a letter, you can send a telegram or make a phone call. You still have your 1A. Here to help, you're welcome 
875627577779511296 2017-06-16 08:14:17 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews Yes, it's the 5 eyes spying on the citizens with no reasonable suspicion, no process and no accountability.
875593142233219074 2017-06-15 05:57:27 UTC <DougTrump16> @JoeNBC Are you & your boyfriend Mike trying to control what people think again?
875575885927030788 2017-06-15 04:48:53 UTC <DougTrump16> @megynkelly @RealAlexJones @Robbin_Young I made a sex tape once, I got nominated for best short film.
875574725065416705 2017-06-15 04:44:16 UTC <DougTrump16> @megynkelly @RealAlexJones @Robbin_Young @SassaPea You wanna make a tasty tape with me? 
875574391802806272 2017-06-15 04:42:57 UTC <DougTrump16> @megynkelly @RealAlexJones @Robbin_Young Voyeur!! I have no desire to see him in bed with a goblin
875558343221272576 2017-06-15 03:39:10 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @ThePerezHilton It's 'Deplorable' and something only a 'basement' dweller would do, isnt it?
875557490477342720 2017-06-15 03:35:47 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump You going to tweet about it or do something? Get on it!
875539632498163712 2017-06-15 02:24:49 UTC <DougTrump16> @StefanMolyneux @Matthew74773071 That was great until when I thought about it, the Munsters were actually very nice people with values.
875539203441938433 2017-06-15 02:23:07 UTC <DougTrump16> @CNN @Acosta @Rockprincess818 Trump needs to publicly call him out and rip his access to the WH up. On Twitter ideally!
875536924731035648 2017-06-15 02:14:04 UTC <DougTrump16> @DRUDGE_REPORT She doesn't look that happy or gay to me.
875536595100737537 2017-06-15 02:12:45 UTC <DougTrump16> @StefanMolyneux Is anyone writing plays about George Soros, Chuck Schumer, The Clintons or Nancy Pelosi's demise? Like for like, see how it goes down.
875517589513838592 2017-06-15 00:57:14 UTC <DougTrump16> @sallykohn One day I was cutting my toe nails & heard a guy say he wants to lower taxes & enforce sovereignty. I liked the sound of it, now I'm racist
875501617650450433 2017-06-15 23:53:46 UTC <DougTrump16> @EdgannonWtn @margiewarrell @BreakfastNews The media has hit a new low.
875489704585580545 2017-06-15 23:06:26 UTC <DougTrump16> @Imamofpeace @DrZuhdiJasser No need to blow up about it
875486403978608640 2017-06-15 22:53:19 UTC <DougTrump16> @Imamofpeace It's a sad day when those who call for calm & dialogue are accused of being radical & hateful. Liars control the media & governments!
875483667237224448 2017-06-15 22:42:26 UTC <DougTrump16> @RealAlexJones Hitler was just tired of religion, Mau and Stalin were tired of capitilism, Ted Bundy was tired of college students & Dahmer tired of gays.
875480786786332673 2017-06-15 22:30:59 UTC <DougTrump16> @barriecassidy @BreakfastNews Good to see him having fun. Media just stirring the pot. Move along
875465398325460992 2017-06-15 21:29:50 UTC <DougTrump16> @td21241 @newtgingrich Trump asks for it. He/Sessions needs to release an army of lawyers/prosecutors to turn over his 10 biggest political enemies lives, NOW!
875461912489738241 2017-06-15 21:15:59 UTC <DougTrump16> @td21241 @InGodIDoTrust No cat photos or pictures of his dinner?
875461495508750336 2017-06-15 21:14:20 UTC <DougTrump16> @Friedo_Frohsinn Charming, do you guys get 72 virgins too?
875460790555365376 2017-06-15 21:11:32 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump Are you the President or a victim, get on that!!
875329608391905280 2017-06-15 12:30:16 UTC <DougTrump16> @DRUDGE_REPORT Keep throwing accusations at Trump until he slips up with a process crime.

875325420656250880 2017-06-15 12:13:37 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews @Gazhopper07 @Jack1234589 I am slightly exagerating 
875263851075325952 2017-06-15 08:08:58 UTC <DougTrump16> @RedPilledWorld @RachelStoltz Fair play to Mr Hodgkinson. I'd turn homicidal watching that Rachel Maddow guy after only half an episode.
875262937413197824 2017-06-15 08:05:20 UTC <DougTrump16> @Acosta Lyin' Jim couldn't not wait to tweet his mischievous murmurs. You're father must have died of shame.
875262329566384128 2017-06-15 08:02:55 UTC <DougTrump16> @MSNBC @CNN @Rockprincess818 Well that worked well for him. Right now he is getting acquainted with his eternal roommates that will cause him no end of mischief.
875239119873429505 2017-06-14 06:30:41 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews @Jack1234589 @Gazhopper07 I didn't realise that a country who had 3 leaders in 25 years at one stage, now has had approx 25 leaders in 3 years was so well governed.
875212816097071104 2017-06-14 04:46:10 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich @QuarterdeckKing Unfortunately this scum at WaPo monetize their page impressions/unique browser stats to advertisers. By seeing how stupid they, we add value
875209499384074241 2017-06-14 04:32:59 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich You realise you drive more traffic to the lies?
875197091999502336 2017-06-14 03:43:41 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews @Gazhopper07 @Jack1234589 Gaz enjoys soothing lies. He never gets tired of the 'Trumps done' song thats played for over 2 years now. It helps him cope.
875195889744191488 2017-06-14 03:38:55 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews ABC cites report citing "WH Sources". Same people who brought wonderful lies like "Comey asked for more resources into Russia probe"
875187196117917696 2017-06-14 03:04:22 UTC <DougTrump16> @Acosta Your WH official sold you a dummy.
875183169623867393 2017-06-14 02:48:22 UTC <DougTrump16> @LLH713 For a second, I thought it was John Goodman!
875181378031075328 2017-06-14 02:41:15 UTC <DougTrump16> @Trevornoah @maddow @KamVTV People influenced by Alex Jones will at worse, interupt you.
875177605581778944 2017-06-14 02:26:15 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich @ScottMGreer Politics is using current events to support your argument or contradict your opponents. Fair game.
875172536522125312 2017-06-14 02:06:07 UTC <DougTrump16> @TomArnold By the sounds of it you will be introduced into the ring as "Tooooommmmmm 'Hodgkinson' Arnoooooold!!!!". Relax slugger!!
875169700661018624 2017-06-14 01:54:51 UTC <DougTrump16> @JesseBWatters @FoxNews I'm thinking Alprazolam or other like substance is in play, combined with constant MSM vitriol/hysteria Was his gun legally obtained/owned?
875168257182810112 2017-06-14 01:49:07 UTC <DougTrump16> @jdolce9 Reality Comey, the leaker.
875164665696796672 2017-06-14 01:34:50 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich Never bothered reading it. Mueller was council into Russia not obstruction. Also, same guys who falsely said Comey asked for more resources.
875147162975219713 2017-06-14 00:25:17 UTC <DougTrump16> @AmericanMex067 The WaPo just moving the news on from a violent leftist attempting a political jihad.
875142507364884481 2017-06-14 00:06:47 UTC <DougTrump16> @PrisonPlanet Yet they probably still see evidence of Russia/Trump collusion, obstruction and pee pee gate.
875140679369867264 2017-06-14 23:59:31 UTC <DougTrump16> @ChadPergram Does FBI stand for  F$#king Bloody Idiots?
875138038782844928 2017-06-14 23:49:02 UTC <DougTrump16> @mitchellvii WaPo citing "Former & Current US officials"? I'm guessing this is to move the news on from Scalise shooting.
875131313409343488 2017-06-14 23:22:18 UTC <DougTrump16> @benshapiro Let me guess "Former & Current WH Officials".
875130009018449920 2017-06-14 23:17:07 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @RogerJStoneJr Please, call it a "matter".
875128160421109760 2017-06-14 23:09:47 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich Is this Anthony Mundine hacking Mike Cernovic? Just do it, if your worried just jab.

You guys have been playing 'Trumps done' song for over 2 years now. See it more as chanting than patient

875103266756898816 2017-06-14 21:30:52 UTC <DougTrump16> @JesseBenn I think you need a plate of fish oils my dumb friend.
875101773706412033 2017-06-14 21:24:56 UTC <DougTrump16> @thinkprogress @IngrahamAngle When Liberal media activists, MSM community orgisers do nothing but sprout bad news, this is always a matter of time and not the last time.
875081017610059776 2017-06-14 20:02:27 UTC <DougTrump16> @bevvo14 @abcnews Gee, I couldn't see this happening by leftwing nut jobs egged on by the likes of Rachel Madcow, Kathy Griffin, Snoop & theatre productions
875080059555426304 2017-06-14 19:58:39 UTC <DougTrump16> @PoliticalShort I smell MSM propaganda, left wing politics and anti-depressants.
874973276858007553 2017-06-14 12:54:20 UTC <DougTrump16> @DRUDGE_REPORT @truthdetective1 Change the record. Youve been playing 'Trumps done!' For over 2 years!
874877633930067970 2017-06-13 06:34:17 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews Trump scores another victory against the Marxist witch hunters. It will suck to be Loretta Lynch soon.

874850522062368769 2017-06-13 04:46:33 UTC <DougTrump16> @michellemalkin I'm impressed we've finally found someone that can interupt a person more than Alex Jones.

874803387413311488 2017-06-13 01:39:15 UTC <DougTrump16> @TheAtlantic @RealJamesWoods Remember when men in journalism and media were gentleman? Who let the reprobates in??!!
874802813926219776 2017-06-13 01:36:58 UTC <DougTrump16> @megynkelly Corporations trying to pressure you and NBC to not show an interview? Sounds like a good old fashioned,classic & true definition of Fascism.
874801792147628033 2017-06-13 01:32:54 UTC <DougTrump16> @YouTube @ANTHONYBLOGAN I will avoid any corporations trying to influence and bully in what I listen to or watch. True Fascism

874768150759301123 2017-06-13 23:19:14 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews @MRBenchwarmer @redneckreel1 @DaveHornsby3 An investigation into Russia doing what we've known for years. They monitor elections via unfair means like USA. DNC making loss excuses

874764986974846976 2017-06-13 23:06:39 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews @MRBenchwarmer @DaveHornsby3 @redneckreel1 How can one defend what several testimonies have so far confirmed there is no evidence & there is no charge? Impeachment wont happen.
874753813948751872 2017-06-13 22:22:16 UTC <DougTrump16> @kylegriffin1 She carried on like a neurotic gas bag.
874738200467488769 2017-06-13 21:20:13 UTC <DougTrump16> @jodiecongirl Too much time on your hands as with the rest of you commenting on some kids shirt. That's the big issue here, unhinged.
874736585371140096 2017-06-13 21:13:48 UTC <DougTrump16> @StefanMolyneux She has confused being a strong woman with being a nagging mole. The 2 are very different.
874736120793186304 2017-06-13 21:11:57 UTC <DougTrump16> @KamalaHarris @YNB An example of taking meth and going on Twitter right here.
874527645320347648 2017-06-13 07:23:33 UTC <DougTrump16> @SaraJamesAus @BreakfastNews I watch none of the above, they are all propaganda now. ABC just echoes WaPo, NYT, CNN and MSNBC. Total rubbish!!

874504224490389504 2017-06-12 05:50:29 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich If this is a fizzer I'm calling you Mike Mensch!
874503668002824192 2017-06-12 05:48:16 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich Not in the mood for foreplay and teasing. Give us the hardcore!!!
874492118495936512 2017-06-12 05:02:22 UTC <DougTrump16> @StefanMolyneux I think their bark will be worse than their bite.

874457065665605632 2017-06-12 02:43:05 UTC <DougTrump16> @TheAtlantic @Cernovich @NewtTrump Very antisocial
874453982260862976 2017-06-12 02:30:50 UTC <DougTrump16> @scrowder Also suicide rates are almost zero with socialism. The socialist government already does the job for you!

874424267579850752 2017-06-12 00:32:46 UTC <DougTrump16> @SafeSpace @SecretService @AoDespair @MarkDice I think technically it's a response to a triggering
874349760890544128 2017-06-12 19:36:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @MarkDice Ridiculous, she still has her 1A and can write him a letter.
874170167676121089 2017-06-12 07:43:03 UTC <DougTrump16> @piersmorgan She only advanced the 80's by bringing back the bush
874169698887188480 2017-06-12 07:41:12 UTC <DougTrump16> @lsarsour I understand you've been angry since your clitoris was removed but now you're just being silly.
874146243110252544 2017-06-11 06:07:59 UTC <DougTrump16> @MichaelKeaton @Robbin_Young One of all time favourite films. The kid 70s to 80s were a great time for comedies. Michael Keaton was great. Loved Working Class Man too
874066209829920772 2017-06-11 00:49:58 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @jerome_corsi @carolebfrank @aneetacarol @Danielle_Greene I believe in brevity due to 140 char limit. "6'8 pyjama wearing nappy boy" is more accurate.
874038694000197632 2017-06-11 23:00:38 UTC <DougTrump16> @ANTHONYBLOGAN I was a World of Warcaft man but now I'm looking for my new nerd time thing.

874034034187182080 2017-06-11 22:42:07 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @jerome_corsi If Trump doesnt then he asks for more obstruction and nonsense. Get aggressive prez!
873884001856962562 2017-06-11 12:45:56 UTC <DougTrump16> @Rambobiggs I was thinking Fred Phelps
873881366995152897 2017-06-11 12:35:28 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump Well you better get Mr Sessions onto it sir.
873813689022926848 2017-06-11 08:06:32 UTC <DougTrump16> @RepublicanChick @GSauce111 Ask them whats wrong with Russia. Their answers will amaze you.
873813506918719488 2017-06-11 08:05:49 UTC <DougTrump16> @RepublicanChick Bless you Miss Ximena for trying to fix stupid. You clearly like big projects.

873760562408177664 2017-06-10 04:35:26 UTC <DougTrump16> @therealroseanne @BevHillsAntifa They are an attractive lot arent they.
873760380102746113 2017-06-10 04:34:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @FrancesMotley You think she would have raised her family better working for Dept of Family/Prot. Services. I guess a painter's house is never painted.
873756946863579138 2017-06-10 04:21:04 UTC <DougTrump16> @KTHopkins What's sad when talented people with a webcam have better material than the 'professionals'. The kid is amazing!
873753272644902912 2017-06-10 04:06:28 UTC <DougTrump16> @Sydney_Uni @abcnews Comey is a weak victim, a 6'8 pyjama boy who still sleeps with teddy bear. Russia/Trump collusion is done. A bad 4 years ahead for liberals.
873739844215635968 2017-06-10 03:13:06 UTC <DougTrump16> @ABC There is something slightly ghoulish about this woman
873735153327132672 2017-06-10 02:54:28 UTC <DougTrump16> Is it the meth or ADHD superpower that does this to someone. https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/873683847367581696

873732188029702145 2017-06-10 02:42:41 UTC <DougTrump16> @scrowder To be honest, the correct answer is "Yes, I believe that. You got a problem with that?"
873731298136801280 2017-06-10 02:39:09 UTC <DougTrump16> @MarkDice @HeerJeet Sorry Mr Heet, you're farting against a hurricane going down this road. Quit while your slightly behind.
873725739652194304 2017-06-10 02:17:04 UTC <DougTrump16> @TRobinsonNewEra So English authorities would like you to fund terrorism?
873700382177873920 2017-06-10 00:36:18 UTC <DougTrump16> I've worked in factories and played in football teams. These jokes would have got me bitch slapped even in those forums. Liberals are weird!https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/873694432683450368

873667320647897088 2017-06-10 22:24:55 UTC <DougTrump16> @Robbin_Young Looks like they want to target Mr Sessions now.
873665668465385472 2017-06-10 22:18:21 UTC <DougTrump16> @wensyel @TerryMendozer It's good to stretch the box. Gives one room to grow.
873664056384606208 2017-06-10 22:11:57 UTC <DougTrump16> @mitchellvii @morstroud Will he be on the same income after selling off his assets? I think he has his answer and won't like it.
873663763928317952 2017-06-10 22:10:47 UTC <DougTrump16> @td21241 @mitchellvii Josef Goebbels would be proud of Muhammed Zuckerbergs enacting of digital sharia law.
873661879482171392 2017-06-10 22:03:18 UTC <DougTrump16> It is usually within 5 tweets that liberals can't even live up to their own standards DIGITALLY by practicing xenophobia on newcomers https://twitter.com/randlight/status/873594698505605120
873657416205819904 2017-06-10 21:45:34 UTC <DougTrump16> @MeckeringBoy @nobby15 @mercnews @SwannyQLD @randlight @ricklevy67 If insulting is a point you liberals win. I've been on Twitter a few weeks & you fail to live to left values practicing digital xenophobia.

873586968348708865 2017-06-10 17:05:38 UTC <DougTrump16> @Rambobiggs Muhammed would be proud of you guys with those beards.

873580712271593473 2017-06-10 16:40:46 UTC <DougTrump16> @SaraCarterDC @td21241 @FoxNews I like how Comey knew confidently what Trump was like so started taking memos but then later says he couldn't read Trump.
873579635228819457 2017-06-10 16:36:30 UTC <DougTrump16> @Rockprincess818 @We_R_TheMedia You can't put Imam Tawhidis photo on that quote!

873570865685815296 2017-06-10 16:01:39 UTC <DougTrump16> @RawStory I remember when this elite soldier fought back tears when tapped on the shoulder and called "Turd Blossom" by Alex Jones.
873570211760283649 2017-06-10 15:59:03 UTC <DougTrump16> @CassandraRules @Cernovich Didn't he crack when Jones tapped him on the shoulder and call him "turd blossom"?
873568957667524608 2017-06-10 15:54:04 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich It's an endorsement for SHS!

873562685916434432 2017-06-10 15:29:08 UTC <DougTrump16> @WSJ Move to Germany, post fb & tweet criticisms of Merkel' s immigration policy. Feel the Motherland dictators buuuuuurrrrrn.
873561140206358528 2017-06-10 15:23:00 UTC <DougTrump16> @Thomas1774Paine Perhaps that op-ed should move to China & start criticizing its leader or go to Germany & tweet against Merkel's immigration policy.

873501046403878913 2017-06-10 11:24:12 UTC <DougTrump16> Most People missed a very interesting remark by #Comey to #Rubio. He told a gang of 8 member that they keep matters "tightly held".

873362808489992194 2017-06-09 02:14:54 UTC <DougTrump16> @BreakfastNews HAHAHA well this went to the toilet for you lefty loonies. Russia done, Obstruction done, Leaker identified. Serves the lazy ABC right!

873340464862117888 2017-06-09 00:46:07 UTC <DougTrump16> @YouTube @Kingkog5 Something like PJW's map in the back ground that just neatens the video up a bit. Besides that awesome work!pic.twitter.com/Vl4393Px0A
873337508653707264 2017-06-09 00:34:22 UTC <DougTrump16> @YouTube @Kingkog5 Going well Angel. We need to get you a backdrop!
873323892399456256 2017-06-09 23:40:16 UTC <DougTrump16> @vanOnselenP I hope you apply these values to another outspoken faith & its personalities who also promote violence but I doubt your scales are honest
873315221510602752 2017-06-09 23:05:48 UTC <DougTrump16> @chucktodd Spoken like a manic depressive having a bad day.
873094771127967744 2017-06-09 08:29:49 UTC <DougTrump16> @HAGOODMANAUTHOR @JaredBeck @scottmtkd I don't think we watched the same fight today. Head over to @LouiseMensch for some enabling. You'll need it after the shellacking today.
873051746754469888 2017-06-08 05:38:51 UTC <DougTrump16> @KTHopkins I'm still trying to get over your lady chunnel reference earlier! 
873049718225489920 2017-06-08 05:30:47 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich I thought Ritalin would be more appropriate
873045120571940864 2017-06-08 05:12:31 UTC <DougTrump16> @kurteichenwald Repent and ask Jesus to cast your demons out. WARNING : You may get a seizure or 5 manifesting but long term its for the vest.

873015239750504449 2017-06-08 03:13:47 UTC <DougTrump16> @WashPost @GlennKesslerWP @AndrewCMcCarthy @glwoods3377 @otherironmike Pointless fanciful thinking 1 President doesnt like outcome, he pardons 2 President knows investigations dont stop if director is fired

873011431674830848 2017-06-08 02:58:39 UTC <DougTrump16> @_Makada_ To be fair its about 40 degrees colder in Adelaide on a winter's night than what they were use to.
873006789377249281 2017-06-08 02:40:12 UTC <DougTrump16> @realRickWiles She has turned it into the Federal Bureau of Matters
873002060127420416 2017-06-08 02:21:25 UTC <DougTrump16> @conorduffynews As Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen would say "Don't you worry about that..... You just wait & see"
872999997008076804 2017-06-08 02:13:13 UTC <DougTrump16> @conorduffynews @abcnews Federal Buraeu of Matters.  Trump "I hope you can let it go" Lynch "DONT call it an investigation, call it a matter" I know which is worse
872997055588843521 2017-06-08 02:01:32 UTC <DougTrump16> @HAGOODMANAUTHOR @JaredBeck @scottmtkd It was more of a wobbegong shark than a piranha.
872979743259336704 2017-06-08 00:52:44 UTC <DougTrump16> @HAGOODMANAUTHOR @JaredBeck I could use a little more. I enjoy reminding liberals I've heard 'Trump is done' for nearly 3 years.
872977844661501952 2017-06-08 00:45:11 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich Most importantly, we were not surprised.

872935269602705408 2017-06-08 21:56:01 UTC <DougTrump16> @KTHopkins My friend Al Suq Yabouti said you didn't reply. 
872928405016125440 2017-06-08 21:28:44 UTC <DougTrump16> @StefanMolyneux Lee Harvey Lynch. Comey is finking out!
872927442612006912 2017-06-08 21:24:55 UTC <DougTrump16> @benshapiro I think Prime Minister May can take full responsibility of UK affairs. This is doing a 'Hillary' by proxy.
872903541374963712 2017-06-08 19:49:56 UTC <DougTrump16> @TRobinsonNewEra "Is that all you got sonny" she says after she wipes the blood off and pushes on. Old bird is tuff!
872903096866717696 2017-06-08 19:48:10 UTC <DougTrump16> @AnnCoulter And then they get jobs by the jobs President and decide they like it. Trump keeps winning and will their votes.
872899813100015616 2017-06-08 19:35:07 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich @Pumps4Trump @joeross Maybe do an Obama, back classify the memo.
872899485684252673 2017-06-08 19:33:49 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich Comey leaked, Comey Obstructed, Comey perjured. LORDY THATS BAD!!!
872894993840472064 2017-06-08 19:15:58 UTC <DougTrump16> @AP Comey perjured himself. Last month no one ever pressured him. Today Lynch pressured him. First time ever Trump is accused of subtlety
872893586869596161 2017-06-08 19:10:23 UTC <DougTrump16> @AuskarSurbakti UPDATE: Donald Trump Loretta Lynch directed James Comey to drop 'investigation' into Donald Trump Hillary Clinton.
872891078138929154 2017-06-08 19:00:25 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews For the first time in 3 years, someone accuses President Trump of being subtle
872890772403568640 2017-06-08 18:59:12 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews I'm loving the way the Australian Broadcasting Communists is trying to play this.

872793049818030080 2017-06-08 12:30:53 UTC <DougTrump16> @DRUDGE_REPORT I'm speechless (yawn)
872792717926866944 2017-06-08 12:29:34 UTC <DougTrump16> @EricTrump If I know Donald Trump, Putin would be his puppet. Unfortunately though, the Democrats will not end this fanciful propaganda they peddle.
872789815099506688 2017-06-08 12:18:02 UTC <DougTrump16> @abcnews @bevvo14 More Democrat disappointment. After 2 years of "Trumps Done", they will still not change the record.

872617441624379392 2017-06-07 00:53:05 UTC <DougTrump16> @RealTimBlack It's his way of saying "I'm really disappointed at this stage in my life.". It's not really about you Mr Black.
872609747463053312 2017-06-07 00:22:30 UTC <DougTrump16> @LouiseMensch Just checking in, hows the impeachment going today? 
872588411789467648 2017-06-07 22:57:43 UTC <DougTrump16> @LindaSuhler A harsh contract? You agree to the t&c's. They capture your emotions. They monetize your emotions.  Who owns your emotions?  FB or you?
872584539385716736 2017-06-07 22:42:20 UTC <DougTrump16> @therealroseanne @TEN_GOP No, because I don't watch them :) thanks for letting me know.
872581766300684288 2017-06-07 22:31:19 UTC <DougTrump16> @wikileaks The person who hired her should do the time. They would have known what they were getting. She was honestly bad and transparent about it.

872573771638382592 2017-06-07 21:59:33 UTC <DougTrump16> @DRUDGE_REPORT Maybe he should just pay more attention to his wife's emotions.

872047350662930432 2017-06-06 11:07:44 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends The most likely place to get shot by a police officer in Australia, Melbourne! Big mistake.

871913475580112897 2017-06-05 02:15:46 UTC <DougTrump16> @mitchellvii A "crunt" or "clunt"?
871913167659581440 2017-06-05 02:14:33 UTC <DougTrump16> @td21241 @mitchellvii I wouldn't wish that upon refugees.
871895185420046337 2017-06-05 01:03:05 UTC <DougTrump16> @StefanMolyneux I do feel for her dog & cat. I hope she found a home.

871600553255518208 2017-06-04 05:32:20 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich @RealLifeMatt @quietlycurious See the word 'was'. You're really putting yourself out there as a goose today.

871599059445858304 2017-06-04 05:26:23 UTC <DougTrump16> @rezaaslan Wow, I'm seeing no end of your anti-social tweets today. How does any reasonable Media outlet think obtaining your services is appropriate?

871588392164769796 2017-06-04 04:44:00 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich @RealLifeMatt @quietlycurious A 3 letter reply alleging "bot". Upgrade your software, my commodore 64 was capable of better. SYNTAX ERROR
871578836982308864 2017-06-04 04:06:02 UTC <DougTrump16> @ScottPresler It's to protect people outside from the idiot behind the fence.
871568232490057728 2017-06-04 03:23:54 UTC <DougTrump16> @DonaldJTrumpJr Can't expect a high standard from a CNN employed cannibal.
871553845628776448 2017-06-04 02:26:44 UTC <DougTrump16> @benshapiro @SethAMandel To be fair, the CNN crew didnt feel safe approaching a gathering of Muslim protesters to film their story about how friendly muslims are. 
871550323642425344 2017-06-04 02:12:44 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich Do they need a safe staging area because CNN crews just wouldn't turn up to gathering of muslims protesting and feel safe?
871546690016133120 2017-06-04 01:58:18 UTC <DougTrump16> @POTUS @614swat @steph93065 It was God giving us a lesson in what happens when you don't have stronger borders.
871545372816023552 2017-06-04 01:53:04 UTC <DougTrump16> @AnnCoulter It's true!! A Mormon just drove his vehicle into a crowd! Fortunately, noone was hurt but his bicycle is beyond repair.

871531955766018048 2017-06-04 00:59:45 UTC <DougTrump16> @Cernovich @RealLifeMatt @quietlycurious I said it was my best guess. You should be ok with that given you will accept "Former and Current US officials" from the good guys at CNN.

871526253341270016 2017-06-04 00:37:05 UTC <DougTrump16> @LindaSuhler @parscale I hope the President calls them out if this is the case.

871454380704251904 2017-06-04 19:51:29 UTC <DougTrump16> @scrowder To be fair, Mrs Myers from Wolverhampton wrote a very honest letter to her local MP.
871454084439490560 2017-06-04 19:50:19 UTC <DougTrump16> @CNNPolitics Being correct is not presidential! He should sooth us with nice fluffy lies.

871164855440424962 2017-06-03 00:41:01 UTC <DougTrump16> @Sabrina_Arsenal If it got to that stage. Like the Crusades you'd eventually get your backsides handed to you. There would be no muslims left.
871163916239294464 2017-06-03 00:37:17 UTC <DougTrump16> @metpoliceuk Sorry guys, you police & government have failed dismally. Your advice is laughable & its about time the good people of England dictate!

871120540353740800 2017-06-03 21:44:56 UTC <DougTrump16> @RealVinnieJames Gave a poor account of himself,could have used his 1A to choose different phrase & he needs to "pay rent" but don't think he believes this.
871117706665140225 2017-06-03 21:33:40 UTC <DougTrump16> @ANTHONYBLOGAN @briggs_tv You should be aware of your audience and exercise common sense and courtesy.
871117487097626624 2017-06-03 21:32:48 UTC <DougTrump16> @ANTHONYBLOGAN @briggs_tv I have a friend who likes to be called 'Poofter Pete'.If I see him across the street I yell "Hi Pete" because I'm aware of others that hear.

871114312558845952 2017-06-03 21:20:11 UTC <DougTrump16> @BraddJaffy Will you be ok? If not, I suggest purchasing some 'Caveman', DNA Force & Brainforce to help you cope and overcome your wimphood.
870970126966808577 2017-06-03 11:47:14 UTC <DougTrump16> @Lynn_Rose1 I did & it got worse. He could have done the same bad job using 140 chars. Which brings me to 'brevity'.

870810694337220608 2017-06-02 01:13:43 UTC <DougTrump16> @DonaldJTrumpJr She could blame Hillary who advised her supporter to "resist" President Trump.
870801622011592704 2017-06-02 00:37:40 UTC <DougTrump16> @RepublicanChick This is productive.
870774574169735168 2017-06-02 22:50:11 UTC <DougTrump16> @GovMikeHuckabee If she speaks for women, then I'm not surprised IF it is really is a male dominated industry.
870765467484344320 2017-06-02 22:14:00 UTC <DougTrump16> @Robbin_Young It's a spiritual oppression. Like many, possessed by a Trump imitating demon living in their head rent free aka Trump Derangement Syndrome.

870734976643235840 2017-06-02 20:12:50 UTC <DougTrump16> @Greens @RichardDiNatale It was a stupid plan written by corporations who profited from polluting the planet now wanting to profit "cleaning" the planet. Wake up!

870733117601923072 2017-06-02 20:05:27 UTC <DougTrump16> @ANTHONYBLOGAN I sincerely hope you are wrong on both those counts brother 
870731699637805056 2017-06-02 19:59:49 UTC <DougTrump16> @benshapiro Kathy has a Trump impersonating demon living inside her head rent free. She needs to ask Jesus to save her & deliver her. Pray for Kathy!
870730381003182080 2017-06-02 19:54:34 UTC <DougTrump16> @ANTHONYBLOGAN This is true. Jesus reminds me every 5 minutes that he loves her, died for her and wants her saved. It's a wrestle and he's winning....just!

870728398909259776 2017-06-02 19:46:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @ANTHONYBLOGAN I'm worried about her health now. We don't need her committing suicide. She needs help
870727277411155968 2017-06-02 19:42:14 UTC <DougTrump16> @TruNews @kathygriffin is a blessing to me. The Lord says I should love my enemies & pray for them. The bar is being raised! Pray for Kathy Griffin!
870725710523936768 2017-06-02 19:36:01 UTC <DougTrump16> @foster2adoptof4 @BobBodker @Robbin_Young I have to tell myself "Jesus died for her and loves her as much as he does me" at least every 5 minutes. I'm praying for @kathygriffin !
870718552868651008 2017-06-02 19:07:34 UTC <DougTrump16> How to fix 1. Room with no cameras 2. Trump,Griffin, A pastor and a psychologist present 3. Talk this out 4. Work this out
870714019941818372 2017-06-02 18:49:34 UTC <DougTrump16> @DonaldJTrumpJr Can you guys enourage her to work through this privately with the president away from cameras? Im actually worried for her health now.
870713125263233030 2017-06-02 18:46:00 UTC <DougTrump16> @scrowder Thinking of what would have happened if she tried this with Stalin, Hitler, Mao or Ceauescu. Trump has really disappointed me as a tyrant.
870711362141409280 2017-06-02 18:39:00 UTC <DougTrump16> @PrisonPlanet @Liz_Wheeler Pray for @kathygriffin I hope the holy ghost can show her what it is about her. I hope her heart is ready to accept it & divine forgiveness.

870708937779171329 2017-06-02 18:29:22 UTC <DougTrump16> @kathygriffin @Robbin_Young @td21241 @foster2adoptof4 She will be on suicide watch within a week
870708765007396868 2017-06-02 18:28:41 UTC <DougTrump16> @ABC Hey the Kathy, "Stay in touch with the Trump family away from cameras, work through this with them.".  Try being normal. @kathygriffin
870707222665248768 2017-06-02 18:22:33 UTC <DougTrump16> @NBCNews @mshopemac An out of touch 'celebrity' gets a harsh life lesson on repercussions. I was sorry I was speeding in my car but I still had to pay the fine
870706478172168192 2017-06-02 18:19:35 UTC <DougTrump16> @NBCNews If she is a comedian, I'm the next Bob Hope
870705773948448768 2017-06-02 18:16:48 UTC <DougTrump16> @kathygriffin @LauraJaneGrace Unfortunately she cannot handle the whirlwind that blows back. Suicide watch?
870704216020402181 2017-06-02 18:10:36 UTC <DougTrump16> @AnnCoulter It's called having a bad night in the bed you made.
870590141592518656 2017-06-02 10:37:19 UTC <DougTrump16> @LisaBloom In John McEnroe voice "You cannot be serious!!!"
870574387354771456 2017-06-02 09:34:43 UTC <DougTrump16> @Nigel_Farage @Chops8592 @TCBettini @CWhiteless @ToonArmyMIA You need to stop using the devils corn, loosen the tin foil hat too.
870545406681206784 2017-06-02 07:39:33 UTC <DougTrump16> @NYMag @MarkDice When did "comedians" become so intense?
870471510753918976 2017-06-01 02:45:55 UTC <DougTrump16> @johnpodesta You will be fine, you keep kids in the hot tub for entertainment.
870467585824784384 2017-06-01 02:30:19 UTC <DougTrump16> @LisaBloom Quit while you're slightly behind.
870440293203451904 2017-06-01 00:41:52 UTC <DougTrump16> @Rambobiggs It's mangerie!! From the House of Pussy
870429705962311680 2017-06-01 23:59:48 UTC <DougTrump16> @billpeduto Good luck next election
870400206461739008 2017-06-01 22:02:35 UTC <DougTrump16> @kathygriffin @MarkDice @GrrrGraphics @rifleman60 A rebellious nature is a sign of witchcraft. (1 Sam 15:23)  A good call.
870399099954110464 2017-06-01 21:58:11 UTC <DougTrump16> @_Makada_ @VoiceOfVegeta Angry that Trump rejected agreement written by corporations who profited polluting the planet & now want to profit "cleaning" planet. 
870389773289967616 2017-06-01 21:21:07 UTC <DougTrump16> @ACLU Your dot joining skills are amazing. 
870146034017619968 2017-05-31 05:12:35 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @smh SMH journalists clearly succumbed to Trump Derangement Syndrome. An article over an incorrectly spelt tweet. Woeful journalism
870107474275127297 2017-05-31 02:39:22 UTC <DougTrump16> @jurassicporkk Still sore from election PTSD. Guess this is the anger stage. Making progress, thats great!
870065318554509312 2017-05-31 23:51:51 UTC <DougTrump16> @kathygriffin @MarkDice @GrrrGraphics Hillary Clinton encouraging supporters to "Resist" rather than accepting the election result is costing careers. One by one they cross lines
870059087727218688 2017-05-31 23:27:06 UTC <DougTrump16> @KenJennings @simonschuster @RepublicanChick Maybe a new kids book "Ken Disappears" with Capter 1 "We last saw Ken when he teased an 11 year old with access to secret service."
870056761327104004 2017-05-31 23:17:51 UTC <DougTrump16> @KenJennings I ain't silly enough to talk smack to an 11 with access to secret service. This is more brave than funny.
870052561608257536 2017-05-31 23:01:10 UTC <DougTrump16> @LindaSuhler @GovMikeHuckabee The spirit of Jezebel had a big day yesterday.
870049165069373443 2017-05-31 22:47:40 UTC <DougTrump16> @mj_lee Clinton missed her calling. She has more stories than Walt Disney.
870046512776003585 2017-05-31 22:37:07 UTC <DougTrump16> @td21241 @mitchellvii Is that a burnt worm?
870044407008866304 2017-05-31 22:28:45 UTC <DougTrump16> @kathygriffin @Liz_Wheeler @holly_eharmon @FDTProgressive Well at least you're a significantly better comedian than Kathy Griffin. I'll give this a pass Mark, well done.
870043787753472000 2017-05-31 22:26:18 UTC <DougTrump16> @kathygriffin @RepublicanChick @Liz_Wheeler If a swift appropriate public example is not set by @SecretService & @WhiteHouse . This will only get worse.
870040693581824000 2017-05-31 22:14:00 UTC <DougTrump16> @MarkDice Well to be honest, the lack of perceived public response from the @SecretService secret only empowers liberals. A swift example is needed.
870010224043753476 2017-05-31 20:12:56 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @azalben @td21241 I'll leave that to a judge. It's very disappointing behaviour from the "tolerant" side of politics.
870006441922355200 2017-05-31 19:57:54 UTC <DougTrump16> @kathygriffin Trump has a message for your from CNN!pic.twitter.com/WwZhUtiidi
870005638365151234 2017-05-31 19:54:42 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @azalben Kathy Griffen is still walking around as a free "artist & comedian". If Trump was a good dictator & tyrant she'd be executed already.
870004347102416896 2017-05-31 19:49:34 UTC <DougTrump16> @RealJamesWoods Has she not been been bundled into a black van yet? Gee, Trump sure is hopeless at this dictator thing.
869934204372439040 2017-05-31 15:10:51 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @TerryMendozer You know if she bursts into tears and her mascara runs. She will actually look like the head she held up.
869930024710754304 2017-05-31 14:54:15 UTC <DougTrump16> @StefanMolyneux @dbongino She was really mad about Trump' s spelling mistake wasn't she!!! #Covfefe
869928816893804545 2017-05-31 14:49:27 UTC <DougTrump16> @tteegar Gee without make up and filters she looks a lot like Trumps hacked off head.
869927368613216261 2017-05-31 14:43:41 UTC <DougTrump16> @steph93065 To be fair its hard tweeting when Kathy Griffen is cutting your head off. Trump did great!
869925467968610306 2017-05-31 14:36:08 UTC <DougTrump16> @WeNoobs Thanks , where is the brass band and fireworks show!?
869923894718746625 2017-05-31 14:29:53 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @jules_su @TheHaplessFan I just joined Twitter to see what the fuss but like all liberals you fail to live up to your own standards by being a twat to new people 
869920802086334464 2017-05-31 14:17:36 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @jules_su @TheHaplessFan Back on point to the comedy styling of Kathy Griffin. You can do it!!
869917194225766400 2017-05-31 14:03:16 UTC <DougTrump16> @DonaldJTrumpJr @AricEndre @ScottNevins And it's within 2 tweets the liberal attempts to deflect and faaaaiiiiillllls.
869915553481216000 2017-05-31 13:56:44 UTC <DougTrump16> @RepublicanChick @therealroseanne I'm going to give comedy a try after seeing what that average beast has done for herself with all that comedic talent she doesn't have.
869914756878016512 2017-05-31 13:53:34 UTC <DougTrump16> @realDonaldTrump @jules_su This is where you start to get silly and have completely gone off point. Trump is living in your head rent free.
869911696046829569 2017-05-31 13:41:25 UTC <DougTrump16> @kathygriffin If this is what passes off as an artist and comedian these days. I'm somewhere between a Rembrandt and Bob Hope.
