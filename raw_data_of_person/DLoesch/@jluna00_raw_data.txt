971017878622281728 2018-03-06 13:41:17 UTC <jluna00> Why cant the SJW on the left understand that although everyone has equal rights not everybody is the same?
970996093566705664 2018-03-06 12:14:43 UTC <jluna00> @jamesejamesdc I dont have that fear. I think she went full retard years ago.
970778786038886401 2018-03-05 21:51:13 UTC <jluna00> @parscale @4everconstant @NinaMorton @theresas179 @Boyd_2650 Texas Republicans, please dont let us down on Tuesday. Please even if you dont follow me retweet and spread this post. Make a stand and vote. Do it for our country!  United we stand; divided we fall.
970664366352744448 2018-03-05 14:16:33 UTC <jluna00> @Balanced750 @gaye_gallops But......gun control....or something.
970661627874893825 2018-03-05 14:05:40 UTC <jluna00> @MaryPharaoh @ClintonMSix14 Why are we letting the party that ignores immigration laws putting our national security at risk and celebrating the law breaker lecture us on how we need more gun laws that restrict the law abiding?
970312028236558338 2018-03-04 14:56:29 UTC <jluna00> @parscale @slhtazdevil @GaryDeSantis Texas is crucial people! Lets defeat this dem takeover.
970302731121451010 2018-03-04 14:19:33 UTC <jluna00> @foxnewsvideo @FoxNewsInsider @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @seanhannity @Monica4Trump @SebGorka This is why its so important that conservatives get out and vote during midterms. Democrats will fight ruthlessly for what they believe in.  Conservatives need to understand what we lose if the Dems win.
970141855298895872 2018-03-03 03:40:17 UTC <jluna00> So liberal logic says Im supposed to give up more of my constitutional 2A rights while letting illegals disregard the sovereignty of our nation and unconstitutionally reap the rewards they arent entitled to.  The swamp is in on it. Cmon Trump!  Do something! Y did we elect u?
970059579319992321 2018-03-03 22:13:21 UTC <jluna00> This says it all right here!  Can I get a MAGA and a retweet?????https://twitter.com/robjh1/status/969755336814092288
969999322333962240 2018-03-03 18:13:54 UTC <jluna00> @nedryun @charliekirk11 Im looking at the fact weve had 40 out of 44 seats turned blue in the past year. Rs better get out there and vote or we are looking at a catastrophic blue wave in November.
969970124118634496 2018-03-03 16:17:53 UTC <jluna00> @scrowder @dbongino @WilkowMajority I'm a 47 year old power-lifter with 33 years of experience.  If you can lift that at your age then it's not too heavy for your age.  Heavy is what keeps you young.
969935853064675330 2018-03-03 14:01:42 UTC <jluna00> @RealCandaceO They arent just leading us there. We are actually standing atop the gallows as this is written.
969934266107756545 2018-03-03 13:55:24 UTC <jluna00> @conservmillen The reason why youre a conservative is because you dont expect everybody to do those things. The reason Im a conservative is because although I may not do those things, I would never SUE you because you do.
969739264370999296 2018-03-02 01:00:32 UTC <jluna00> @PPIndKentucky I cant believe I live in a world where this is an actual belief and that its displayed as a matter of fact.
969631114410082304 2018-03-02 17:50:47 UTC <jluna00> Because this is headline news should we all expect our newsfeed to be filled with news from Chicago all weekend?http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/02/gunman-opens-fire-at-central-michigan-university-2-shot.html

969313770941030400 2018-03-01 20:49:46 UTC <jluna00> @seanhannity turning you off today. Too many important subjects and issues to listen to other than you arguing with your staff about what you wear.  Love your show but sometimes you sound like an FM morning show.
968941884495224832 2018-02-28 20:12:01 UTC <jluna00> Although it SHOULDNt  be more difficult for me to exercise my 2A rights then it is for an illegal to take advantage of ALL the rights of a citizen; alas, it is.  And Dems are OK with that.  Moreover, people keep voting those Dems in.  Think about that!
968913729969569792 2018-02-28 18:20:09 UTC <jluna00> @k_ovfefe @RandyLucas62 It makes it ironic.
968886370994307072 2018-02-28 16:31:26 UTC <jluna00> If even only a 1 year membership was purchased by the 500,000 new NRA members these last couple of weeks then David Hogg is personally responsible for increasing sales to the NRA of $20,000,000.00.

968841338736160768 2018-02-28 13:32:30 UTC <jluna00> @WilkowMajority BREAKING:  All of the people signing up for the NRA recently proves nobody gives a sh*t about "has been's" like Blink 182 who until I read this post didn't realize still exist.
968308069921734656 2018-02-26 02:13:28 UTC <jluna00> @dbongino Unwilling or not, Florida is contemplating a state wide ban on "assault rifles".  Other states will follow.  The minute I saw CNN parading those teens on natl' television I knew this was going to be the result.  It only takes 1 snowflake to cause an avalanche.  Look out below!!
968307129277825024 2018-02-26 02:09:44 UTC <jluna00> Well, here it goes.  Florida is now contemplating a state wide ban on all assault rifles.  Don't say I didn't warn you.
968300864686313472 2018-02-26 01:44:50 UTC <jluna00> @peterdaou it doesn't get much more cowardly to hide behind a bunch of teenagers to push an agenda that wouldn't have helped the tragedy they just went through.https://twitter.com/WilkowMajority/status/968283806393356288
968272186002751488 2018-02-26 23:50:53 UTC <jluna00> @BreitbartNews @AIIAmericanGirI Why are we letting these teenagers dictate how they behave?  Un-freaking-real!!!
968183367161192448 2018-02-26 17:57:57 UTC <jluna00> @TheDemocrats @FoxNews Are. You. Freaking. Kidding. Me.
968178691980185600 2018-02-26 17:39:22 UTC <jluna00> Dangit!  The coward deputy's lawyer came out and said he actually isn't a coward.  Hmmm...guess we were wrong.  Sorry about that, our bad.  I guess we should all stop calling the coward who let a bunch of kids die because he's a coward a coward.  Fu*king coward!!
968176805323554816 2018-02-26 17:31:52 UTC <jluna00> Florida deputy who didn't enter school during mass shooting is not 'a coward,' lawyer says via the @FoxNews Apphttp://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/02/26/florida-deputy-who-didnt-enter-school-during-mass-shooting-is-not-coward-lawyer-says.html
967828106705756160 2018-02-25 18:26:16 UTC <jluna00> Liberal logic- Minors <18 y.o. Responsible enough to: 1. Choose abortion 2. Change their gender 3. Keep med records from parents 4. Emancipate from parents 5. Consent to sex  Adult @18 NOT responsible enough to buy an AR-15 or any handgun.
967814781271924736 2018-02-25 17:33:19 UTC <jluna00> @CollinRugg Theyre only mad because it destroys their narrative.
967803054799007744 2018-02-25 16:46:43 UTC <jluna00> Regarding gun control and our precious freedoms, the citizens of this country are acting like the citizens of Troy:  My, what a beautiful wooden horse you have there, yes, please come in!  Retweet if you get the reference.
967795791728267265 2018-02-25 16:17:52 UTC <jluna00> Its now been shown that if just one agency had acted accordingly just one time the massacre in Florida likely would have been prevented. Yet, we are still talking gun control. Why?  The blind willingness to give up our freedom is appalling. #NoGunControlEver
967579696052428800 2018-02-24 01:59:10 UTC <jluna00> @dbongino Ask @JessicaTarlov, she seems to think it was a masterpiece.
967468884872724482 2018-02-24 18:38:51 UTC <jluna00> @TruthFeedNews @_Proud_American And thus I shall sever my ties with those companies.
967165142034034688 2018-02-23 22:31:53 UTC <jluna00> @BreitbartNews @AIIAmericanGirI The problem is men today arent masculine enough.
966811825152057344 2018-02-22 23:07:56 UTC <jluna00> @realDailyWire @AIIAmericanGirI And please tell me what does any of this shit have to do with the collusion story?
966431924762828800 2018-02-21 21:58:20 UTC <jluna00> The fact they are televising this emotional plea by children all over the nation will do one of two things. It will ensure democrats sweep in 18 or it will ensure erosion of the 2A, but it will NOT make us safer. Get ready, confiscation is coming.
966427955621609472 2018-02-21 21:42:34 UTC <jluna00> Watching this country so willing to give up a portion of our freedom and security is heartbreaking. The hounds are out and theyre using kids to push this message. Get ready. Confiscation is on its way.
966129220077236225 2018-02-20 01:55:30 UTC <jluna00> @CollinRugg @spencersmith11 @TheAme19 And...EVERYBODY had a gun. 
966081051280814080 2018-02-20 22:44:06 UTC <jluna00> @BayLife This isnt proof. Watch the whole clip, then watch all the others with the same gestures. Wow you posted a picture. Again, grow up, turn off MSNBC, stop listening to Bernie and try and learn something.
966074693294768128 2018-02-20 22:18:50 UTC <jluna00> @BayLife Lol, show you the proof. That wasnt the first time hes used those gestures and wasnt projected at the individual youre referencing. Have you seen the whole clip? Or do you just get your news from memes?
966074002539102208 2018-02-20 22:16:05 UTC <jluna00> @CollinRugg @TheAme19 @spencersmith11 The Constitution. Its Real.
966057901927284737 2018-02-20 21:12:06 UTC <jluna00> @BayLife That was proven false. Grow up.
966057688638545921 2018-02-20 21:11:16 UTC <jluna00> @ercdknsn Where was the lie?  Tell me.
966054078093537280 2018-02-20 20:56:55 UTC <jluna00> Listening to the same media clowns who all had their lips permanently sown to Obamas ass treat Sarah Sanders with such disrespect and contempt is astonishing to me.
966046557186310144 2018-02-20 20:27:02 UTC <jluna00> @CollinRugg @TheAme19 @spencersmith11 What gives you the moral authority to deem what is necessary and what isnt?  Do you even know what an AR-15 is?pic.twitter.com/zy7jqG10Ln
965979577695653888 2018-02-20 16:00:53 UTC <jluna00> Lol, yeah because Russia wants to keep the citizenry of the US armed. Ha ha ha, CNN, ha ha ha.https://twitter.com/di_plora/status/965889604799823872
965979138715656192 2018-02-20 15:59:08 UTC <jluna00> @CollinRugg @TheAme19 @spencersmith11 Ha ha, ok tell me which of the other 10 amendments youre willing to give up.
965964255827673088 2018-02-20 14:59:59 UTC <jluna00> @CollinRugg @TheAme19 @spencersmith11 Cars, alcohol, tobacco, etc. are not protected as Constitutional rights. None of those items protect the citizenry from a tyrannical govt. Further, guns are already regulated by the ATF and the FBI.
965787606188417024 2018-02-19 03:18:03 UTC <jluna00> @4originalintent @Education4Libs @BB_Halce can you even tell me what the purpose is of the 2nd amendment?
965787163672567808 2018-02-19 03:16:17 UTC <jluna00> @4originalintent @Education4Libs @BB_Halce Sorry, its not that simple and its not a weapon of war. Tell me which of the other 10 amendments are you willing to give up in the name of safety?  Show me your posts calling for gun control when Kate Steinle was killed.  How about you posts calling for dissolution of PP?
965785696412647424 2018-02-19 03:10:28 UTC <jluna00> @CollinRugg @TheAme19 Agree completely and we need to make sure they are exposed. Exploiting the deaths of those kids to push this anti-gun fantasy is sick and wrong.
965777595450011650 2018-02-19 02:38:16 UTC <jluna00> @4originalintent @Education4Libs Ok @BB_Halce then please tell me how any measure of gun control short of confiscation would have protected those kids. Cruz was in every measure projecting he would do this.  FBI, Broward Sheriff, school district, and parents all failed. But gun control....
965697548265578496 2018-02-19 21:20:11 UTC <jluna00> @dbongino, @WilkowMajority, Id value your input on this blog post if you have time to read it.
965696051163385856 2018-02-19 21:14:15 UTC <jluna00> Please take a moment to read and retweet if you can.http://starspangledvoice.com/2018/02/19/gun-control-this-bad-policy-will-prevail-unless-we-fight-back-with-truth/
965603085614641153 2018-02-19 15:04:50 UTC <jluna00> @4originalintent @Education4Libs We need to prepare for a full court press on gun control. The group of students organizing it are from Florida and people will listen to them because the lib media will promote it. 2A supporters need to fight back. We need our message to be heard as well.
963919882382278658 2018-02-14 23:36:23 UTC <jluna00> Id like to know why we have to keep reading about it this crap. We ALL KNOW who was behind this. I WANT TO READ ABOUT INDICTMENTS REGARDING OBAMA, CLINTON, COMEY, RICE, LYNCH, HOLDER, et al...when are we going to see justice? See a special counsel appt.?
962368005828046849 2018-02-10 16:49:47 UTC <jluna00> @MaryPharaoh @TruthinGov2016 My sentiments exactly!
962366130764443648 2018-02-10 16:42:20 UTC <jluna00> @DavidOAtkins You can try and argue your way out of this but you won't succeed.  You're taking advantage of the very system you despise which makes you a fraud.
962365844272529408 2018-02-10 16:41:11 UTC <jluna00> @DavidOAtkins "Rent seekers"?  As a business owner what makes you different from them?  If you have enough discretionary income to give it away then your Marxist principles would support that you are charging too much money.  To deny that makes you a hypocrite.
962354476538474498 2018-02-10 15:56:01 UTC <jluna00> @DavidOAtkins Then you're either a fraud or a hypocrite. If your company's success is 100% derived from the private sector than your animosity isn't directed at the capitalist (which that makes you), it's directed at the consumer.  Think about that!
962334746779959296 2018-02-10 14:37:37 UTC <jluna00> @CollinRugg Yep, makes sense.
962325147825750016 2018-02-10 13:59:29 UTC <jluna00> @Alpha_Lady1 @TallManShort @DavidOAtkins And by the way, Venezuela was a decent one before economic illiterates like you got ahold of it. Capitalism creates more wealth for more people. The lie of socialism is initially dependent upon the success of capitalism.
962323429323022336 2018-02-10 13:52:39 UTC <jluna00> @Alpha_Lady1 @TallManShort @DavidOAtkins The economic trajectories for those good ones arent looking good because of the high taxation. All the unicorn farts and fairy dust have dissipated. I
962321559753928704 2018-02-10 13:45:13 UTC <jluna00> @DavidOAtkins Im willing to bet the company you run gets its revenue from donations and research grants; it doesnt survive on S&D principles. Youre in the business of spending other peoples money already like the Marxist you are.
961964947386191872 2018-02-09 14:08:10 UTC <jluna00> @hotfunkytown @blaubok @charliekirk11 @dbongino @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @LouDobbs @ChristieC733 @bfraser747 I agree, overwhelming evidence against Clinton et al, yet she walks around like the cock of the walk. Meanwhile ZERO evidence on Trump and were told to let Mueller do his job. Tired of this crap show.
961234108117524481 2018-02-07 13:44:04 UTC <jluna00> True, and yet we lost yet another special election this week flipping another district blue.https://twitter.com/hotfunkytown/status/961066906261258240
960614036999032832 2018-02-05 20:40:08 UTC <jluna00> @WBBIIISRA You should absolutely associate the two. Wages up+booming economy=higher interest rates which will lead to a market correction. This is what happens when you dont artificially manipulate policy. Market will rebound.
960142408129196032 2018-02-04 13:26:03 UTC <jluna00> Speaking of which, why dont we see anyone in cuffs yet and why is there even still an investigation that WE are PAYING for?https://twitter.com/collinrugg/status/959975550688243712
959859116121325568 2018-02-03 18:40:21 UTC <jluna00> @FoxNews So, @FOXNews has decided not to celebrate the FISA memo release, but instead has chosen to parade a bunch of anti-Trump anti FISA memo people on their show all morning long.
959833332803514368 2018-02-03 16:57:54 UTC <jluna00> Liberal Playbook: 1.  Never answer a direct question unless it supports your agenda. 2. Spew propaganda no matter how ridiculous or detrimental to our Republic.  3. Lie if necessary when challenged with rules 1&2.
959799451270266881 2018-02-03 14:43:16 UTC <jluna00> @TwitchyTeam @AIIAmericanGirI I think she needs to seek a refund from her acting coach.
959433665175371776 2018-02-02 14:29:45 UTC <jluna00> @MittRomney @FoxNews So?
959153677167554560 2018-02-01 19:57:11 UTC <jluna00> Like I tweeted yesterday, #ReleaseTheMemo isnt going to happen like we want it to. Even Wray now is considering redacting all names. We cant allow this.#namethenameshttps://twitter.com/jluna00/status/958867409602936832
959092719309111296 2018-02-01 15:54:58 UTC <jluna00> This is truly an embarrassing display of beta males and angry feminists throwing a toddler temper tantrum.  Pathetic. https://twitter.com/jojoh888/status/958888805020454912
958867409602936832 2018-01-31 00:59:40 UTC <jluna00> I totally agree. That slow hissing sound we here is all the air being let out of the #ReleaseTheMemo balloon.   #ReleaseTheMemo #ReleaseTheMemo #ReleaseTheMemohttps://twitter.com/fuctupmind/status/958799764119851008
958551696099049472 2018-01-30 04:05:08 UTC <jluna00> Totally agree!  WTF??https://twitter.com/robyns323/status/958549079650373633

958453587360665600 2018-01-30 21:35:17 UTC <jluna00> Prediction: after Jeff Bozos and his cronies completely disrupt the stock market and tank healthcare on the day President Trump gives his State of the Union address you will watch them pull back and change their minds and the stock market will correct itself tomorrow.
957814464815841280 2018-01-28 03:15:38 UTC <jluna00> Whats that?https://twitter.com/cattharmony/status/957803800005234689
957675636666937344 2018-01-28 18:03:59 UTC <jluna00> @DonaldEricPalm8 @RealTeriAnne And yet you did @AlanDersh even though several credible sources were trying to warn America of such relationships. You refused to listen or pay attention. America suffered because of it.
957321306722123776 2018-01-27 18:36:00 UTC <jluna00> Anyone else see the hypocrisy of the leftist view that illegal aliens have the right to citizenship but disregard the basic human right to life????
956168228077674496 2018-01-24 14:14:04 UTC <jluna00> @usnews So is the American economy!
955993706401705985 2018-01-23 02:40:35 UTC <jluna00> Im so sick and tired of hearing the my body, my choice argument. Not counting rape and incest cases consider this: 1. You chose to have sex.  1. The baby doesnt have a choice.  2. There is only one case of immaculate conception I know of so where is the man in this choice?
955821382201360385 2018-01-23 15:15:50 UTC <jluna00> Just like clockwork. Damaging evidence coming out then another shooting to suck all the oxygen out of the room.   The deep state is real.
955625134563315712 2018-01-22 02:16:01 UTC <jluna00> @krupsguy @EssenceOfBolg So dressing up like a vagina and marching around criticizing the man who has appointed more women gains what credibility?  Exactly what values do you disagree with?

955290364667035648 2018-01-21 04:05:46 UTC <jluna00> @Bronco_7777 @dbongino Please let this be true.
955288372854931456 2018-01-21 03:57:51 UTC <jluna00> @therealezway All Mitch McConnell has to do is invoke the nuclear option. Which he should do.
955287112911220736 2018-01-21 03:52:50 UTC <jluna00> @therealezway McConnell is a hack. But the shutdown wouldnt have occurred in the first place if DACA hadnt been tied to the budget. You snowflakes can meltdown all you want but this is the #SchumerShutdown

955213203952214017 2018-01-21 22:59:09 UTC <jluna00> It's this simple; The Democrat idea of compromise is "Give us what we want and we'll vote yes".  Then when you don't they claim they tried to negotiate but the Republicans don't want to.  Sick of this crap! #SchmerShutdown #ReleaseTheMemo
954817592480350208 2018-01-20 20:47:08 UTC <jluna00> #SchumerShutdown is only meant to distract #ReleaseTheMemo
954812036361347073 2018-01-20 20:25:03 UTC <jluna00> Dont let #ReleaseTheMemo fizzle. That is exactly what the senate Democrats are trying to accomplish with #SchummerSHUTdown #ReleaseTheMemo #SchummerSHUTdown #ReleaseTheMemo #SchummerSHUTdown
954791585719369728 2018-01-20 19:03:47 UTC <jluna00> @POTUS @SenSchumer @FoxNews @MiguelGrandeMW @domeyer36 @Meljanx @dinnerbeans Heres an example for you Libtard: A year ago November he unified the entire country for the most part sans California and New York. He has also unified other countries to stand in solidarity with us against NOKO. He brought people together for tax reform. Doubt if youll get it.

951603037482704896 2018-01-11 23:53:38 UTC <jluna00> BREAKING NEWS:  Trump said shithole countries.    My thoughts:  Who cares?  My family is made up of LEGAL immigrants who came from a shithole country.  Thats why they came here and we dont want here to become there.
951198937548914688 2018-01-10 21:07:53 UTC <jluna00> I wonder why you dont see more politicians being celebrated at Hollywood awards ceremonies. The talent it takes to ACT like they give a damn about us is astounding. #draintheswamp #MAGA

Give me one instance in modern history or present day where socialism worked. You cant because its a flawed concept. Capitalism is what has made the world better.
942743761175506945 2017-12-18 13:10:02 UTC <jluna00> @Education4Libs @Thesanelib @Eques4 Whats your answer then?  Socialism?  Communism?  The people just arent smart enough right. Except for the enlightened ones like you right @eques4?
942742987456397312 2017-12-18 13:06:58 UTC <jluna00> @Education4Libs @Thesanelib @Eques4 Trump isnt part of that. Thats why all the pols hate him and want him out. Open your eyes.
942742516679393281 2017-12-18 13:05:05 UTC <jluna00> @Education4Libs @Thesanelib @Eques4 Then why the heck vote for a dem?  Because that is exactly what their platform is. The middle class turned out for Trump. Not the wealthy. And look at the economy. 4% growth and growing. Consumer confidence . Unemployment . But you stay in denial.
942741025268760577 2017-12-18 12:59:10 UTC <jluna00> @Education4Libs @Thesanelib @Eques4 Regulations are rights?????  Wow, you really are drinking that lefty lemonade arent you. Again, go educate yourself.
942740589870641152 2017-12-18 12:57:26 UTC <jluna00> @Education4Libs @Thesanelib @Eques4 Since you obviously hate rich people so much, (probably because you dont apply yourself), explain to me how you support a fraud like Sanders who has never held a real job in the private sector and owns three houses as a millionaire.
942739578779078656 2017-12-18 12:53:25 UTC <jluna00> @Education4Libs @Thesanelib @Eques4 The sheep are the ones who cheered on Obama while he was putting the chains on America. Protections? Please, stop with your non-sense.
942738672163504128 2017-12-18 12:49:49 UTC <jluna00> @Education4Libs @Thesanelib @Eques4 Talking points all and all false. Getting rid of the estate tax is a good thing. That money has already been taxed. Private school tuition can be paid through a 529 plan. Awesome, public education sucks. De-regulation is taking away my rights?  Educate yourself Bernie boy.
942733037757857792 2017-12-18 12:27:25 UTC <jluna00> @Education4Libs @Thesanelib @Eques4 That wasnt an answer. It was a talking point from the left with a side of snark. The wealthy are not the beneficiary of these tax cuts so stop listening to Bernie, Chuck, and MSNBC and do your own research.
942731561052422145 2017-12-18 12:21:33 UTC <jluna00> @Education4Libs @Thesanelib @Eques4 Just as I thought, you have no answer. Dont look now but your Trump Derangement Syndrome is showing.
942727944312578049 2017-12-18 12:07:11 UTC <jluna00> @Education4Libs @Thesanelib @Eques4 Please then tell me since youre so smart how he is denying ALL our healthcare.  Then maybe you can enlighten me on how the money is going to the billionaires.  Truth is you cant without regurgitating another lie from the resistance. Go back to your safe space. 7 more years!
942715653357576192 2017-12-18 11:18:21 UTC <jluna00> @Education4Libs @Thesanelib @Eques4 As he should. Single payer doesnt work. Put healthcare back in the hands of the private marketplace. Ocare right wing? I guess thats  the nonsense I should expect from anyone who supports Bernie.
942406523124203522 2017-12-17 14:49:58 UTC <jluna00> We now know there absolutely was a plot to cover for HRC and take down Trump all in an effort to carry out Alinskys plan. Now we patriotic Americans want ACTION to bring JUSTICE.    SESSIONS DO YOUR DAMN JOB!

936424053241405440 2017-11-30 02:37:46 UTC <jluna00> @CollinRugg @Iamsharknado That doesnt matter!! Illegal alien felon discharged a firearm and killed an American citizen.
936423468530200578 2017-11-30 02:35:27 UTC <jluna00> @CollinRugg Simply disgraceful!!  No amount of words can possibly express how pissed off I am tonight.   Illegal Alien: Crime   Felon discharging/ possession of firearm: Crime Murder: CRIME!!!!  WTF America??????
935497835251777536 2017-11-28 13:17:19 UTC <jluna00> @EmilyLindin, this is why people like you are so dangerous. Its not the price YOU pay, its the price the INNOCENT man pays!  Maybe they should arbitrarily charge you with lying to a fed agent to discourage false accusations. Would you support that?https://twitter.com/dineshdsouza/status/935235795216224258
934620165513158656 2017-11-25 03:09:46 UTC <jluna00> @dbongino Stay strong brother. We need Patriots like you sir.
932776698994495488 2017-11-20 01:04:29 UTC <jluna00> And just like that the thin line between sexual harassment and flirting disappears forever.
932263303128145920 2017-11-19 15:04:26 UTC <jluna00> @CNN @dbongino, you just answered your own question. Snakes lie with their own.
931703038560972800 2017-11-17 01:58:09 UTC <jluna00> @TuckerCarlson thank you for having Cathy Areu on your show tonight so that we once again see first hand the delusional mentality we face as a nation.  She clearly never left kindergarten.
930907797100703744 2017-11-15 21:18:08 UTC <jluna00> Does that surprise you @marklevinshow?  Hes just a left wing hack posing as a fair and balanced reporter.https://twitter.com/marklevinshow/status/930883805854011393
930826883977097216 2017-11-15 15:56:37 UTC <jluna00> Please fellow deplorables, do yourself a favor and listen to this @dbongino podcast. Proud supporter here. TY Dan.  https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-dan-bongino-show/id965293227?mt=2#episodeGuid=835e90a0fc031bde77f620d6fe20761c
930443580019052544 2017-11-14 14:33:30 UTC <jluna00> The GOP isnt spineless. Simply, they dont have an agenda that is much different than the Dems. They hold all the power and LET the Dems wield that power. We need to DEMAND change. Thank God for Trump. MAGA!
930058224169918464 2017-11-13 13:02:14 UTC <jluna00> @seanhannity @Owy7640Young @gr8tjude Advertisers that bail on Sean are just added to the list of those that wont be in my household. We need to fight this together.
929718395045535745 2017-11-12 14:31:53 UTC <jluna00> @xychelsea @FoxNews Thanks Bradley, but Ill take my advice on how to support our troops from someone who isnt a traitor. You should still be in prison by the way.
929707962779648006 2017-11-12 13:50:26 UTC <jluna00> @MarkYoungTruth @HiramAbra And what makes you think you have the right and the moral authority to take what they EARNED?!?!  True Americans earn what they own and own what they earn. Capitalism forever!! MAGA.
929519575334449152 2017-11-11 01:21:51 UTC <jluna00> RT this please!!!!!!https://twitter.com/dbongino/status/929499764768542720
929017517242118145 2017-11-10 16:06:51 UTC <jluna00> Congressional and Senate Republicans have the same agenda as the Democrats. We the people must stand together. We need more People like Trump. https://twitter.com/khubb64/status/929015808742842369
928980542963331072 2017-11-10 13:39:55 UTC <jluna00> Democrat political strategy: 1.  Lie 2. Make false claims against your opponent so outrageous to suck all oxygen out of room.  3. Lie 4. Only answer questions with other questions.  5.  Lie
928834445448056832 2017-11-09 03:59:23 UTC <jluna00> The difference between the Republicans and Democrats holding/seeking office is non-existent. They are one in the same. Weve been duped. Thank God for Trump!
928669367876829184 2017-11-09 17:03:25 UTC <jluna00> This is why we lose. This is why we voted for Trump. DO SOMETHING!  Tax cuts, illegal immigration, Clinton Cartel..., DO SOMETHING!
928668994902441984 2017-11-09 17:01:56 UTC <jluna00> Dems: If you have a (D)behind your name we will lie,cheat, and steal for you no matter how bad you or your policies are.  Repubs: Were sorry for our constituents, please like us!
928614157036896256 2017-11-09 13:24:02 UTC <jluna00> @GinBatch Maybe, though could just be the ESPN network.
928407899172347904 2017-11-08 23:44:26 UTC <jluna00> @Fuctupmind This is one of my favorites.
928391750535827457 2017-11-08 22:40:16 UTC <jluna00> @donnabrazile, you seem to be changing your tune on exposing the DNC.  What happened?  Did you find an early version of a suicide note?
928365346280656897 2017-11-08 20:55:21 UTC <jluna00> @Sky_Max This is precisely the reason we shouldnt try to compromise with dems. ALL they have are talking points that lead nowhere but to bigger gov, higher taxes, and less freedom.
928304100948758529 2017-11-08 16:51:59 UTC <jluna00> @dbongino Right now Id vote for that brave plumber in Texas before Id cast a vote for most Republicans.  We need to move  not .
928302829122588674 2017-11-08 16:46:56 UTC <jluna00> @WBBIIISRA I shouldve quit FB when you did. However, whats worse, kids sports or the Flowbee? (I think thats what it was called)
928301133923278848 2017-11-08 16:40:11 UTC <jluna00> @HughJorgen8 @notElizabethNJ I think this is still a warning sign. RINOS and squishy repubs are not going to win. Trump won because we wanted strength and patriotism in office. No amnesty, no taxes. Move, not !
928251456519487489 2017-11-08 13:22:47 UTC <jluna00> Any republican running for office from this point forward better embrace the conservative agenda or they will lose.  Amnesty, higher taxes, establishment support...not a winning strategy.
927960742178963456 2017-11-07 18:07:36 UTC <jluna00> @WilkowMajority if you are going to have @ChristinePelosi on your show can you please try to control her filibusters. VERY annoying!!!!!
927898781286150145 2017-11-07 14:01:23 UTC <jluna00> @GinBatch Analyzing the profile of mass murderers, maybe the key is to restrict hateful people like you @MalcolmNifkin from acquiring guns or vehicles
927897329398509568 2017-11-07 13:55:37 UTC <jluna00> @GinBatch @MalcolmNifkin what does need have to do with anything?  2A doesnt qualify the right to own with need.
927675712059858944 2017-11-06 23:14:59 UTC <jluna00> If TX gunman were conservative his FB page would be on display and on every news network.  Hes a crazy lib so naturally its been deleted.
927511076685541377 2017-11-06 12:20:47 UTC <jluna00> @StockMonsterUSA Why did this story not get the legs to run?
927351645079506944 2017-11-05 01:47:16 UTC <jluna00> @HughJorgen8 @RealJamesWoods The first step @BarackObama wouldve been to not elect your divisive,un-patriotic, Soros funded, media pimping ass.
927317899319975936 2017-11-05 23:33:10 UTC <jluna00> @mikebwonder CIA hasnt come up with narrative yet.
927306611428810752 2017-11-05 22:48:19 UTC <jluna00> @WBBIIISRA talk soon brotha. Hope youre well.
927304134092402688 2017-11-05 22:38:28 UTC <jluna00> @WBBIIISRA I have no beef with that. Personally, I could care less who you support or dont support.  As long as you know why you support,as I do,cool!
927290121929424896 2017-11-05 21:42:47 UTC <jluna00> @WBBIIISRA Look them up. Its public info.
927284267851292672 2017-11-05 21:19:32 UTC <jluna00> @WBBIIISRA Maybe but factual.
927283908290347008 2017-11-05 21:18:06 UTC <jluna00> @WBBIIISRA Lol...touch.
927281777722515456 2017-11-05 21:09:38 UTC <jluna00> @WBBIIISRA So then dont live your life that way.  Since most mass shooters are democrats maybe your fear is misdirected.
927278962493001728 2017-11-05 20:58:27 UTC <jluna00> @WBBIIISRA Fear of what???
927275868128464896 2017-11-05 20:46:09 UTC <jluna00> Its that simple for most gun owners too.https://twitter.com/wbbiiisra/status/927274460524306432

927272247357788161 2017-11-05 20:31:46 UTC <jluna00> I dont know whats more pathetic, the Clintons or those who blindly still support their evil asses.https://twitter.com/stockmonsterusa/status/926581433870696448
927262971352543232 2017-11-05 19:54:54 UTC <jluna00> One good American with a CCW would have prevented this tragedy in Texas today. All the gun laws in the world would not have. Just sayin.
927250171737468928 2017-11-05 19:04:03 UTC <jluna00> Does anyone else notice when the dems are under fire for ANYTHING there is always something that takes over the news cycle?
927170237954375680 2017-11-05 13:46:25 UTC <jluna00> Thank you @FLOTUS for bringing dignity, class, and respect back to the Oval Office. This deplorable is behind you and @POTUS all the way.
927163208728588288 2017-11-05 13:18:29 UTC <jluna00> @WBBIIISRA Not sure how big he is but he cant weigh more than a normal snowflake.
927000514390147072 2017-11-04 02:32:00 UTC <jluna00> It is so inspirational to listen to @POTUS speak to our beloved troops like he did at Yokota Air Base. Great to know he loves USA.

926846017802141698 2017-11-04 16:18:05 UTC <jluna00> Michelle Obama is the epitome of what every young lady should strive NOT, repeat NOT, to become. She is a disgrace. https://twitter.com/martine44741302/status/926604256421076992

925705208465833985 2017-11-01 12:44:55 UTC <jluna00> @SebGorka @MAGAofPA That is incorrect!  The left divides by race, GENDER, status, wealth, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, and political affiliation.
925566662006341632 2017-10-31 03:34:23 UTC <jluna00> @CollinRugg, exactly true!  They purposefully and gleefully defy him. Keep up the fight brother. Eventually, we will take our country back.

915688677556224000 2017-10-04 21:22:48 UTC <jluna00> @CollinRugg Thats because they are too busy erasing this mans life history so they can rewrite it and then put it out for the sheep to sop it all up.

903989397493751808 2017-09-02 14:34:02 UTC <jluna00> Exactly!!  @JeffFlake can you cite exactly where in the constitution it requires us to protect those who violate the sovereignty of USA?https://twitter.com/dbongino/status/903741869322113024
900356444905586688 2017-08-23 13:57:58 UTC <jluna00> FBN, but Jeff Flock covered the protest last night with as much integrity as Richard Thornburg in Die Hard....

896504388453150720 2017-08-12 22:51:17 UTC <jluna00> @POTUS @stephenfhayes @BillKristol Right, because that's what the last administration and everybody on the left does with BLM right?  What a bunch of hypocrites.

895401524867846144 2017-08-09 21:48:53 UTC <jluna00> @jamesejamesdc Maybe it's Matt,  Tommy, or......Ethan. Yeah right!

889932763121438720 2017-07-25 19:37:59 UTC <jluna00> @WilkowMajority For that matter @ParTeeGuy I'll debate you. Why not? I'm just some "uninformed" listener. Should be easy for you right smart guy?

889072240095932416 2017-07-23 10:38:34 UTC <jluna00> @realDonaldTrump Such a great moment to witness. Watched on Fox News. Meanwhile, MSNBC ran with more Russia, Russia, Russia. God Bless #USSGeraldRFord. MAGA!
888816948011651072 2017-07-22 17:44:08 UTC <jluna00> @WilkowMajority How the FU**?????  Why are we letting this happen? That judge should immediately be removed from the bench for aiding and abetting.
888366360656580610 2017-07-21 11:53:40 UTC <jluna00> @WilkowMajority Offer to put this guy on as soon as he calls in and I bet he still doesn't do it.
887649492740300802 2017-07-19 12:25:05 UTC <jluna00> Let's not forget 1 important fact. We wouldn't have to repeal anything if repubs hadn't let Obama STEAL our hc in the first place.
887436723390730241 2017-07-18 22:19:37 UTC <jluna00> ...replacement and are then upset because we don't want another replacement.
887436672132165632 2017-07-18 22:19:25 UTC <jluna00> So in ref to healthcare the dems burn down the house in lieu of remodeling the kitchen, then give us a 1 bd condo as a...
887435256390975489 2017-07-18 22:13:47 UTC <jluna00> @BretBaier @dcexaminer Yeah, really??? Well what about the centrist democrats??? Oh, wait, right, there aren't any.
887432571889561603 2017-07-18 22:03:07 UTC <jluna00> All day long from GOP "We need to get healthcare done..." THEN DO IT DAMNIT AND REPEAL!! Stop with the effing lip service you cowards!!
887326900607221760 2017-07-18 15:03:13 UTC <jluna00> The fact that the GOP owns all the power in gov. right now yet Schumer can still stand there and lecture is absolutely pathetic. WHY GOP?!?!
887326055303872512 2017-07-18 14:59:51 UTC <jluna00> Spot on @SarahHSandiers !  Great job GOP, you just gift wrapped all the ammo you armed Schumer with on the senate floor to showcase ur fail.
887300681203412992 2017-07-18 13:19:02 UTC <jluna00> @dbongino Dems will take over in 18' because the GOP is SPINELESS!  What the hell did the voter get for electing you squishy losers?  DO SOMETHING!
887299888400146433 2017-07-18 13:15:53 UTC <jluna00> @dbongino Republicans own all three branches of government and can't get "O"care repealed. There is no left and right, just big government. MAD VOTER!
887294544588550144 2017-07-18 12:54:39 UTC <jluna00> @dbongino @KathySc65174870 That's an excellent question.
887294295262330880 2017-07-18 12:53:39 UTC <jluna00> @dbongino @newbeachbum That's exactly right.
887124837789032448 2017-07-17 01:40:17 UTC <jluna00> @dbongino How many times do the voters need to say this?  REPEAL. NO REPLACEMENT. WE WANT FREE CHOICE!  GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT!
886921665489379329 2017-07-17 12:12:57 UTC <jluna00> So true, and stripping them of that power will be difficult.
886638741569363968 2017-07-16 17:28:43 UTC <jluna00> Not to mention, WE DONT LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY! Why do we keep letting that argument gain traction?
885684913785237504 2017-07-13 02:18:33 UTC <jluna00> Juan Williams has got to be the most sensationalistic, hyperbolic idiot in the public eye. Seriously, why does he get any airtime???
885312854362136576 2017-07-12 01:40:07 UTC <jluna00> @MaxBoot made a total jackass of him self tonight on @TuckerCarlson. Belligerent and hyperbolic does not look good on anybody. Tucker wins!
885309556502523905 2017-07-12 01:27:01 UTC <jluna00> @jamesejamesdc Jim, I'm not sure I can agree with you calling Schumer a dickhead. Seriously, I think a more appropriate term is Cockmunch.
884844386936274944 2017-07-11 18:38:36 UTC <jluna00> The REAL story isn't Don jr. and Natalia it's Comey and Obama aides. MSM is running blocker once again to protect HRC and Obama. Sad.
884766315432611841 2017-07-11 13:28:22 UTC <jluna00> @SebGorka just crumpled up @SRuhle and drop kicked her on her own show.
884554463347970048 2017-07-10 23:26:32 UTC <jluna00> Anybody know what the line is in Vegas on the next Trump "bombshell"?  I finally discovered when Dems shout "resist" must mean resist logic.
884066274963185664 2017-07-09 15:06:39 UTC <jluna00> @stephenfhayes If that's your conclusion then you either aren't paying attention or you are a relentless Never Trumper.
883843545769033728 2017-07-08 00:21:36 UTC <jluna00> @FoxBusiness This is akin to the mental patients wanting the doctor examined. What a joke!  Stop wasting our money and get to work behind @POTUS
883842975888887808 2017-07-08 00:19:21 UTC <jluna00> Thank you @MELANIATRUMP for bringing class back to the office of the First Lady. You and @POTUS have reintroduced leadership in America.
883418572487372800 2017-07-07 20:12:55 UTC <jluna00> @StockMonsterUSA Punk kid got exactly what he deserved.  I hope no charges are pressed on that old man. Being a "reporter" isn't excuse for being an a-hole.
883416226122399744 2017-07-07 20:03:36 UTC <jluna00> I'll be over here holding my breath until BLM speaks out and condemns Miosotis Familia being executed by person fueled by anti-cop rhetoric.
882029750109196288 2017-07-03 00:14:14 UTC <jluna00> I think @SarahHSandiers is quite possibly becoming one of my favorite people!  That chic is ROCKIN' the briefings.

880587885002588160 2017-06-29 00:44:46 UTC <jluna00> The hypocrisy of the left and the disgusting behavior of the media is too complex for 140 characters or less. MAGA!  I need to write a book.

879320276353384448 2017-06-26 12:47:45 UTC <jluna00> Obamacare needs to be repealed in its entirety. Not replaced, repealed. Let healthcare be where it belongs, in the private sector.
879132698069147649 2017-06-25 00:22:23 UTC <jluna00> @wilkowmajority_ @WilkowMajority You could also ask: "what SHOULD the const. order POTUS to do?" And the answer would be the same, not one damn thing.
879128312274137089 2017-06-25 00:04:57 UTC <jluna00> @WilkowMajority I'll answer that for you @wilkowmajority_ not one damn thing.
879082956786151424 2017-06-25 21:04:44 UTC <jluna00> Dems disgusting and childish behavior resulting from Clinton loss is a real consequence of the stupid "everyone gets a trophy" philosophy.
879076332591878145 2017-06-25 20:38:24 UTC <jluna00> @dbongino Is that all us Hispanics are good for @embeddub?  Low wage jobs?  Don't worry, we know where opportunity lies and it isn't with Dem policies
878717291185152000 2017-06-24 20:51:42 UTC <jluna00> @realDonaldTrump Now we know why there has been such a push to accuse Trump. Can we say yet another coverup of the Obama administration? Shift the focus?
878290866594398209 2017-06-23 16:37:15 UTC <jluna00> You squishy Republicans put that repeal bill on Obama's desk every week like "badasses" but not on Trump's desk. Why not????

877879604534546433 2017-06-22 13:23:02 UTC <jluna00> @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle @seanhannity I agree, but the GOP was too busy looking for "squishy" RINOS to try and appease the left for votes they were never going to get anyway.
877583801928400896 2017-06-21 17:47:37 UTC <jluna00> @jamesejamesdc Kroger doesn't have that kind of horsepower. Amazons deal is all cash.
877583232044118016 2017-06-21 17:45:21 UTC <jluna00> @jamesejamesdc I know it's great!  I'm laughing my Osshoff today.

876886237705109505 2017-06-19 19:35:45 UTC <jluna00> Can @SenSanders stop pretending he cares about the welfare of the American people and just admit he just hates successful people who earn it
876445373937721344 2017-06-18 14:23:55 UTC <jluna00> @MariaBartiromo @POTUS @marcorubio @FoxNews The only way our President is going be successful is to get rid of every last Obama holdover. That should be a priority.
876443078026031106 2017-06-18 14:14:47 UTC <jluna00> @jamesejamesdc Ahhhh....the love, peace, and tolerance from the left yet again doesn't fail to disappoint.

859037253104017408 2017-05-01 13:30:15 UTC <jluna00> @dbongino This is so disappointing although predictable. Thank the GOP now for the Dem sweep in 20'. What a bunch of cowards. Yes GOP, you, cowards!
838101722476216320 2017-03-04 18:59:56 UTC <jluna00> @dbongino great job yesterday on Levin.
836783167180849152 2017-02-28 03:40:28 UTC <jluna00> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews President Trump's speech was inclusive and inspiring. This generation's Reagan!  #Realhopeand change
836779674080530432 2017-02-28 03:26:35 UTC <jluna00> @IngrahamAngle Just turned it off!!!! He's talking about campaign promises because Trumps speech knocked it out of the park!!!!
836774921871187968 2017-02-28 03:07:42 UTC <jluna00> @YouTube @WilkowMajority there hasn't been a speech like this since Reagan!  Dems showing their lack of class....
826176242235891716 2017-01-30 21:12:20 UTC <jluna00> @realDonaldTrump ...not a Mexican-American, but an American.  I applaud your immigration reform and thank you for protecting America!
826175983522869248 2017-01-30 21:11:18 UTC <jluna00> @realDonaldTrump Thank you! My Grandfather was an immigrant who believed in assimilation, patriotism, and was thankful to be an American...
788451354339520512 2016-10-18 18:47:06 UTC <jluna00> @sfpelosi @WilkowMajority can Pelosi be on your show without talking over you???? Please stop letting her do that!
785317951515746304 2016-10-09 03:16:04 UTC <jluna00> @megynkelly Megan can you just go work for MSNBC please?  It's truly where you belong.
785234943022551040 2016-10-09 21:46:14 UTC <jluna00> @stephenfhayes @allahpundit wondering when you're going to come out with your HRC endorsement. Wtvr Trump has said or done is much less HRC!
784750986141114369 2016-10-08 13:43:09 UTC <jluna00> @WilkowMajority I agree!  Actual Clinton scandals; no interest. Trump stupid comments; decision factors. This election is over. USA doomed.
780592139239424000 2016-09-26 02:17:23 UTC <jluna00> @michellemalkin trump could've won on that subject alone. Now it's 3rd and 10 at the 2 min warning.
780583320505622528 2016-09-26 01:42:20 UTC <jluna00> @stephenfhayes no, I think I care more about what HRC is hiding than the LEGAL maneuvering Trump does with his taxes.
759006441084563456 2016-07-29 12:43:31 UTC <jluna00> @WilkowMajority you have a ton of ammo from dnc speeches. Can't wait for your show!  SIC EM'!!!!!!!
751542954121043968 2016-07-08 22:26:17 UTC <jluna00> @StealthRhino321 @WilkowMajority Every Time this admin. is called to the carpet with a scandal something happens to change narrative.
750348448113696769 2016-07-05 15:19:45 UTC <jluna00> @WilkowMajority Nail in the coffin for American  justice. This is extremely depressing.
