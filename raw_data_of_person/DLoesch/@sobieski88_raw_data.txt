971158314552889344 2018-03-06 22:59:20 UTC <sobieski88> @dmartosko Evidently he did want to work at the WH or he wouldn't have spent the last year there?
971155026893791232 2018-03-06 22:46:16 UTC <sobieski88> @kaitlancollins A week ago is about 35 news cycles in this day and age, try to keep up!
971153098826805249 2018-03-06 22:38:36 UTC <sobieski88> @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs JUST TO BE CLEAR: Democrats are in favour of more taxes on US citizens but they are AGAINST taxing foreign companies(even when those countries slap tariffs on US exports as they do now)
971152184195895298 2018-03-06 22:34:58 UTC <sobieski88> @maggieNYT Leftists want tax increases for US citizens and no tax at all on foreign imports(even when they tax US companies) Nice priorities!
971140334829916166 2018-03-06 21:47:53 UTC <sobieski88> @benshapiro It's not conservative unless communist China wins amirite?
971109579496009735 2018-03-06 19:45:40 UTC <sobieski88> @RadioFreeTom What are you conserving though, the liberal world order? Any conservative in any other generation would have found you to be a laughing stock.
971101421516009472 2018-03-06 19:13:15 UTC <sobieski88> @RealAlexJones Spencer destroyed Sargon so badly in their debate he actually joined Antifa? Funny.
971071344082288640 2018-03-06 17:13:44 UTC <sobieski88> @JackPosobiec Dems are: FOR - Taxing American citizens AGAINST - Taxing foreign companies Is it clear now why we consider them unpatriotic filth?
971070742807957505 2018-03-06 17:11:21 UTC <sobieski88> @joerogan Watering the religion down more to appease the degenerate element in society isn't how to religion, bro.
971070183354888192 2018-03-06 17:09:07 UTC <sobieski88> @JackPosobiec Gen Z are going to be gassing what's left of the Boomers at this rate
971069655937896449 2018-03-06 17:07:02 UTC <sobieski88> @JackPosobiec Not one Democrat voted for the tax cuts on US citizens yet they are up in arms over taxing foreign companies? So their platform is literally anti-citizen and pro foreign imports
971043685642244098 2018-03-06 15:23:50 UTC <sobieski88> @JackPosobiec Gary Cohn should be forced into a room with some steel workers and be made to explain his position, he would be exposed pretty fast.
970997267447664640 2018-03-06 12:19:23 UTC <sobieski88> @InnerPartisan @ComradeWaluigi @JoeComrade @PrisonPlanet They will call you a nazi no matter how hard you counter-signal the alt-right bro
970976461262872576 2018-03-06 10:56:42 UTC <sobieski88> @piersmorgan Top 4 is too competitive these days so I'm grateful to the Arsenal board for keeping this guy in charge as I'm sure other LFC supporters are! #WengerIN
970812961865588737 2018-03-05 00:07:01 UTC <sobieski88> @RadioFreeTom Hypothetical vs reality This guy is desperate to be on your show @CNN, it's not like anybody watches so why not?
970728546971934721 2018-03-05 18:31:35 UTC <sobieski88> @bbcworldservice @BorisJohnson What kind of dope trusts the media in 2018? Oh, the foreign secretary....
970696390052630530 2018-03-05 16:23:48 UTC <sobieski88> @RaheemKassam Carswell is so in the closet he's screwing Daniel Hannan in Narnia
970298270907076608 2018-03-04 14:01:49 UTC <sobieski88> @Arron_banks "Conservative" these days just means conserving the Liberal status-quo which is killing us
970297569095143425 2018-03-04 13:59:02 UTC <sobieski88> @piersmorgan As a Liverpool fan I fully endorse Wenger staying put #Wengerin
