938113813467029505 2017-12-05 18:32:17 UTC <ShawnRMurad> @realDonaldTrump @MaxHagley No but you were very disrespectful to the Leader of my country. May I ask what he did to you?
937990142501031936 2017-12-05 10:20:51 UTC <ShawnRMurad> @realDonaldTrump @MaxHagley If you are trying to stay relevant Max, this is a pathetic way to do it.
936257831195627521 2017-11-30 15:37:16 UTC <ShawnRMurad> @DIRECTV I canceled my service and asked to be removed from your call lists. I keep receiving calls asking why I canceled my service, hmm probably because you are morons?

Glad that you can recite the liberal line though. Kaepernick just pissed of Veterans and whines about not being in the NFL any longer. But you go ahead believe what you like.

926129359563485184 2017-11-02 16:50:20 UTC <ShawnRMurad> @Bourdain Doesnt have anything to do with the President. This POS should be in Gitmo. He is any enemy combatant. The Pres can say whatever he likes.

920661076345327616 2017-10-18 14:41:20 UTC <ShawnRMurad> @RepWilson @maddow you should Thank @realDonaldTrump  everyday for giving you something to talk about and be almost relevant.
