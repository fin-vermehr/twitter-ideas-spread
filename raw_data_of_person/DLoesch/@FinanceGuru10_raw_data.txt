970882014147743744 2018-03-05 04:41:24 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNNOpinion @CNN Welcome to Cleveland!
967101333642891265 2018-02-23 18:18:20 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @MSNBC Pellet guns fire at 1400 fps. Do you actually 'report' or just parrot the BS you're fed?
965894065832300545 2018-02-20 10:21:05 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN No one is stopping him. Feel free to send cash.
960999744368726017 2018-02-06 22:12:48 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @JewhadiTM Peace partners!
959392150839595008 2018-02-02 11:44:48 UTC <FinanceGuru10> Was the truck driver who died in the accident a republican too? You're really wishing for death to people because you disagree with their politics? You need help.https://twitter.com/stephenking/status/959109282250838018
959273653392367621 2018-02-01 03:53:56 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN You're trying very hard to discredit a document you have not seen. It's likely irrelevant, but your bias is showing. Might want to tuck that back in!!!
959268822728564736 2018-02-01 03:34:44 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @chelseahandler Wait, what? "You have to pass the bill to see what's in it", was literally the calling card of ACA. I think you need a cock.....tail. Be well!
958556076730920960 2018-01-30 04:22:32 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @w3bsag3 @kenbone18 I'm hammered! :-)
958550717056331781 2018-01-30 04:01:14 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN I particularly loved the Spanish! Cmon, give me a break.
958550139261652992 2018-01-30 03:58:56 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @lsarsour We finally agree! ;-)
958544879252135936 2018-01-30 03:38:02 UTC <FinanceGuru10> Trump absolutely killed the SOTU address. Interesting that @CNN thinks 'Americans are dreamers too' is offensive. Not so much!
957255506384605184 2018-01-27 14:14:32 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @NancyPelosi What policy in the framework can you evidence as racially restrictive legal immigration?
957171620283633665 2018-01-27 08:41:12 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @lsarsour Curiously, at what time would it be okay to arrest illegal immigrants in your view?
956951655173500936 2018-01-26 18:07:08 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @zerohedge I never saw it coming. Invisible/intangible money disappeared. 
956519576447143936 2018-01-25 13:30:12 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @clevelanddotcom I particularly like the concrete barriers and makeshift disabled persons ramps at the center crosswalk. James Corner must be so thrilled he took this project!
956028635995168768 2018-01-23 04:59:23 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @haaretzcom @MarlenaMansour2 It's not an illegal occupation. Read the law. Husseins occupation of Kuwait was illegal, blocking the straights of Hormuz was illegal, killing athletes was illegal, but occupying land won in defensive war is legal. Sorry, it's true.
955855682519126016 2018-01-23 17:32:08 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @haaretzcom I would offer that he would call for attacks on Jews, just cuz.
955795971824345089 2018-01-23 13:34:52 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Those tweets, which she apologizes for now, are still available. Why don't you don't you include them in your reporting? Is it because they were anti-Semitic and anti-Israel?
955715864371834882 2018-01-23 08:16:33 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @mitchellreports Maybe you should get your facts straight before 'reprorting', if that's what you call it.
955092553078071296 2018-01-21 14:59:44 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @MarkRuffalo Confirmation bias.
955066793021923330 2018-01-21 13:17:22 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CillizzaCNN You really believe a politician, rep or dem, will go without pay for longer than two weeks? Against human nature. That said, the comparison of congress to adolescents is apropos.
955063137425874945 2018-01-21 13:02:50 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @charliekirk11 @lguzmangoog I would like any government or business to be run by the most qualified and capable individuals. Gender doesn't matter.
955045249960808448 2018-01-21 11:51:46 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @RealJamesWoods Somewhere a parent weeps.
955041252256440320 2018-01-21 11:35:53 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @UNRWA @UlrikaModeer Palestinian refugees? It's been 70 years! Perhaps it's time to accept that Israel is not temporary. Those 'refugees' (90+% of which have never stepped a foot in Israel) are not going 'home'. You're funding a farce. But glad it makes you feel good.
954173951407738885 2018-01-18 02:09:32 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Making history? It's a cosmetic company. They're trying to increase sales. Is this some kind of magic shampoo that grows a hijab on your head after use? That would be newsworthy.
953972802650025984 2018-01-18 12:50:14 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CillizzaCNN @CNN So because dems wish to tie amnesty for illegals to a spending bill (unrelated), republicans will be blamed?
953799891779801089 2018-01-17 01:23:09 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Except these companies control the vast majority of social media and their agendas 'trump' all others. You see why some of us are skeptical?
953795902682132480 2018-01-17 01:07:18 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Palestinians are inhabitants of the land. Jews are inhabitants of the land. One party has sought peace, one refuses to recognize the others right of presence. Everything else is garbage. I'd love to hear one credible argument based upon Palestinians seeking:peace with Jews.
953790644325056512 2018-01-17 00:46:24 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Maybe they should stop paying 'martyrs' $350mm a year. Seriously, what other people remain refugees after 70 years? It's the Muslim Arab idea that Israel is temporary that feeds this ridiculous narrative. The Jews are home....and they ain't leaving. 'Dar al islam' be damned.
953789207016886272 2018-01-17 00:40:42 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN So the economy seems to be doing well? Maybe wage inflation comes next. Crazy POTUS!
953756178038820870 2018-01-17 22:29:27 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN That's right, don't hold the door for women, don't let them in the elevator first - go ahead and hop right in that elevator, rip a fart with em too! A true gentlemen indeed!
953619022632882178 2018-01-17 13:24:27 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TheAtlantic @JeffreyGoldberg @JGreenblattADL @anneowenphd Huh? Not sure what that has to do with the article nor my comment, but I'm glad you got it off your chest. Be well.
953618321768841217 2018-01-17 13:21:39 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @fathomjournal @elderofziyon @EWilf Could not have said it better! I would clarify that the concept of 'dar al Islam' pits the larger Muslim world against the concept of Jewish sovereignty in Israel. It does not matter to them that the land was Jewish, it is now Islamic (in their belief).
953611323484590080 2018-01-17 12:53:51 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TheAtlantic @JeffreyGoldberg @JGreenblattADL Any loss of innocent life is tragic, but 18 people in 2017? Facts don't lie, but cherry picking minute data points presents a skewed argument at best. Maybe look at homicides by illegal immigrants, homicide macro trends on a per capita basis, all violent crime, etc.
953608326633451521 2018-01-17 12:41:56 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN "Demeaning and degrading", says they guy who had a temper tantrum while shaking his fist at the female DHS secretary.....yesterday. Gotta love it!
953456457218953216 2018-01-16 02:38:28 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @chelseahandler No, it's our law. Unfortunate situation, but the law is blind. Sorry kiddo.
953327625434488833 2018-01-16 18:06:32 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @KenRoth Is exactly what the Arabs, in collusion with UNRWA have been doing for damn near 70 years. What other people remain refugees after 70 years? None. It's a scam and you know it!
953224209790062593 2018-01-16 11:15:36 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @LahavHarkov Not even a mention of it in the USA.
953219344191905793 2018-01-16 10:56:16 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @FullFrontalSamB MLK never protested America, he embraced its ideals. False moral equivalence.
953217381580537857 2018-01-16 10:48:28 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @BretStephensNYT Sensationalism again. This is a personal travesty. 30 years! He could've applied for citizenship, but for some reason chose not to. What is the marginal tax rate for an illegal? The lunacy of the left never ceases to amaze!
952535011584040961 2018-01-14 13:36:58 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Unremarkable. When you present one, just one positive commentary on the president, that will be truly remarkable!
952533541618896896 2018-01-14 13:31:08 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @clevelanddotcom Unremarkable. Everyone's a little bit racist, including Don Lemon. But the day CNN has one positive thing to say about the President will be truly remarkable.
952170880960008194 2018-01-13 13:30:03 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @chelseahandler I get the feeling you're not gonna like Mike Pence any better. Just a hunch.
951626754317258752 2018-01-11 01:27:53 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CillizzaCNN @CNN Really appreciated explaining to my children why you put a word they're not allowed to say on your banner! Classy move! Liked wolf stating "s-hole" too, as if we can't read! Needless to say, we'll watch a different network from here forth.
951440066089504769 2018-01-11 13:06:03 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Appears like the wrong way to handle the situation, but I'd have to see the whole thing. That said, you do not have free speech in your place of employment. You are there if your own volition and abide by a code of conduct.
951161365728817154 2018-01-10 18:38:35 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN I'm reasonably certain Stephen Baldwin is paid less than Sandra Bullock.
950847576928145413 2018-01-09 21:51:42 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @JacobAWohl @CloudVagina I have looked into climate change extensively. What I've discovered is that the earths climate is constantly changing. This is due to wide ranging phenomena that we cannot possibly predict or understand the exact causes of, yet. I'm in favor of sustainability as pragmatism.
950845320279228418 2018-01-09 21:42:44 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CheriJacobus If it's all lies, and I have not read it nor do I plan to, then that's every reason to remove an editor/journalist. No? Isn't that like libel or something?
948740424990117888 2018-01-03 02:18:38 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @chelseahandler Perhaps you should find another focus? Your obsession with this one man, largely insignificant in the grand scheme of things, is concerning. You claim to be a comedienne, but your tweets are anything but funny. They're OCD and troubling. Politics ain't your gig. Be well kiddo!
948738058727362560 2018-01-03 02:09:14 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @MrCavalier34 It's early in a back-to-back. Give em a little time to light it up! They'll find their rhythm. Go cavs!
948369688756674562 2018-01-02 01:45:28 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TarekFatah @washingtonpost He's right to do so. There have been no peace talks. 70 years and Palestinians are still refugees...inside Palestinian territory (along with Syria, Lebanon and Jordan). Somehow the west should accept refugees but for 70 years their BROTHERS have not accepted them, only UN $$$$$!
948368149770104832 2018-01-02 01:39:21 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @realDonaldTrump @jimsciutto I get the cynicism, but it's lost on reality. Israel would never cede Jerusalem and their basic law prohibits such. Parts can be given, but to pretend this is a real issue is a joke. 70 yrs! Gaza could be Singapore! The WB a religious Disneyland. Deal already!!!
948345129202536448 2018-01-02 00:07:52 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @JonahNRO The potholes out there are brutal!
948342088692850688 2018-01-02 23:55:47 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @patriciaannmcd2 Which was seized after they invaded our embassy, took hostages and paraded them on the streets while beating them, but you're right, we should play nice.
948322216944513024 2018-01-02 22:36:50 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @JohnBrennan More Billions in cash should bolster the reformists eh? Gimme a break. So  Trump makes a couple comments, pallets of cash went straight to the mullahs. Come up with a better argument.
946051854026321920 2017-12-27 16:15:13 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @StandWithUs Wait, is he claiming the arabs of the region are actually the ancient canaanites? And Jews fabricate history? The farce is strong with this one!
944269804831236096 2017-12-22 18:13:59 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @AP Breaking: UNGA votes 128-9 that the moon is made of cheese!
943410133668855808 2017-12-20 09:17:58 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @NPR @pchh @LahavHarkov Jews have enough external critics than to be called 'token' by one of their own. Hashem judges, not us.
943396294751596544 2017-12-20 08:22:58 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN What is @cnn's favorability rating?
943395081956085760 2017-12-20 08:18:09 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN No different than "you have to pass it to find out what's in it". But, we're exempting ourselves from it. Same shit, different day.
941362225889054721 2017-12-14 17:40:18 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Breaking911 Does anyone else find it interesting that not one woman, not one, appears to behave inappropriately in the workplace? Hmmm.
940638361542414336 2017-12-12 17:43:56 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CillizzaCNN It's as if I say, "she really likes cake and would do anything for it", I've somehow made an advance. I mean, did you see her eyes light up when she knew my birthday was fast approaching? Jeez!
940568004106051584 2017-12-12 13:04:21 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @HalawaMark @IsraelinEU @IsraelMFA @EnLiEretzAheret @susskindbatzi @a_Brit_Euroland @ynkutner @Zionisthumanist @KhaledAbuToameh @27kislev5719 This is good information to be aware of. Thanks!
940562200846053376 2017-12-12 12:41:18 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TheTorontoSun @CandiceMalcolm @CarolHusband Ignorance of the law does not exempt the criminal. Eight days?!
940413786086887425 2017-12-11 02:51:33 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @anastef62 @Evenings_Star Not one maple leaf? Hmm, me thinks these folks are not proud to be Canadian. Go figure.
940390775552184320 2017-12-11 01:20:07 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Well, let me just come clean right now. I too, look women up and down in a beauty pageant. G-d forgive me!
940387049596686342 2017-12-11 01:05:18 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CillizzaCNN Now that was funny Chris! 
940385024146395136 2017-12-11 00:57:15 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @NolteNC @i_am_jasin I know, but the pace at which only men seem to be accused of wrongdoing is flabbergasting! So no women, zero, act inappropriately? I suspect this will end poorly. But, my lapel pin body cam should fly off the shelves!! :-)
940369450989170688 2017-12-11 23:55:22 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @brianstelter I agree. It might be nice for @POTUS to be somewhat magnanimous from time to time. There's always hope!
940368558059589633 2017-12-11 23:51:50 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @elderofziyon @WarpedMirrorPMB And @matisyahu!
940368138209779713 2017-12-11 23:50:10 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @NewYorker @farhip Request for privacy? You fired a man and just announced to the whole world it was because of sexual misconduct. Thanks for the discretion!
940367626227933190 2017-12-11 23:48:07 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @NolteNC I actually disagree. We have a thing called due process (granted not in the workplace but it sets precedent) which is being ignored. I don't know the facts here, just saying many men lose their careers based on 'accusations', not facts.
940366334843654144 2017-12-11 23:43:00 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @slone @HealthRanger Good to know! Thanks!
940363370372517888 2017-12-11 23:31:13 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @haaretzcom There were only supposed to be three. Don't these folks ever keep their word?
940326231836413952 2017-12-11 21:03:38 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @SarahHuckabee @chelseahandler Well look, Obama started virtually every answer to a question that way so either she's emulating greatness, or you just couldn't find anything else to pick on.
940313763730853888 2017-12-11 20:14:06 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CillizzaCNN Perhaps, but you all have done this to yourselves (not just CNN). You really cannot believe anything without doing your own due diligence anymore. Journalistic standard of non-bias has evaporated.
940280379835023362 2017-12-11 18:01:26 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @w3bsag3 @MargieInTelAviv Beirut was once the Paris of the Middle East. Not so much with hezbollah at the helm.
940277281066496002 2017-12-11 17:49:07 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Imamofpeace @CNN @ItsAwanindra I get you and I am aware of the totalitarianism of the faith.
940274077285212161 2017-12-11 17:36:24 UTC <FinanceGuru10> And chanting "shoot the Jews", "remember the khaybar" and firebombing synagogues, but it's Israel/Zionists they hate. Riiiiggghhttt!https://twitter.com/ajenglish/status/940140383048208384
940272410292563973 2017-12-11 17:29:46 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Imamofpeace @CNN @ItsAwanindra And therein lies the problem. But, if more non-Muslims (and Muslims) legitimize such types, then influence can only grow. Nice tweeting with you today! Be well!
940270305372753921 2017-12-11 17:21:24 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN @ItsAwanindra Follow @Imamofpeace. World needs more like him and of course, he is threatened daily!
940268811017773056 2017-12-11 17:15:28 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN @ItsAwanindra I cannot advocate for such a plan. The other abrahamic religions experienced reformation from within, this can happen, and will happen, with Islam as well. Do not unto others that which is hateful to you.
940265880579182592 2017-12-11 17:03:49 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN @ItsAwanindra Islam is a religion of submission and yes, the vast majority of muslims are peace-loving and kind people. That Quran can be interpreted as "Allah is pleased when you kill the kafirs" is the problem. Reform the faith to remove such. Only Muslims can fix it.
940261800796401664 2017-12-11 16:47:37 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Nothing to do with Islam!
940261084694540288 2017-12-11 16:44:46 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @cnni Says the man who jailed 10's of thousands of opposition factors. I think he's still upset about the demise of the Ottoman Empire.
940260760139288576 2017-12-11 16:43:29 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @haaretzcom Trying to bring back the Ottoman Empire!
940258943594631169 2017-12-11 16:36:15 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN We need Venetian blind reform immediately!
940245918795911170 2017-12-11 15:44:30 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @realDonaldTrump @Philassie @yankifarber Terribly disrespectful to Hawaii and Alaska! Racists!
940224757081001984 2017-12-11 14:20:25 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @slone @nypost Let's not jump to concl.........oh never mind!
940202248881278976 2017-12-11 12:50:58 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TheEconomist You didn't think about fact checking before publishing this? A complete fabrication. Now, if you want to talk about the shocking rise of Spanish at Walmart, now there's a story!
939944886329069570 2017-12-10 19:48:18 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @assafgibor Has anyone informed him there is no state of Palestine?
939944357863583745 2017-12-10 19:46:12 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN It's just the zionists we hate. Lol!
939942395554287622 2017-12-10 19:38:25 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Forbes Do you know what's happened to lung cancer and heart disease rates since we abolished smoking in public places? Nothing.

939921057779257345 2017-12-10 18:13:37 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @POTUS @AmyMek Ya know, in all my years visiting synagogues all over the US and abroad, I have never once heard a rabbi wish for death or destruction for anyone. Not, ask G-d to harm anyone. Only a wish for peace. Strange.
939920262019108864 2017-12-10 18:10:27 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Jerusalem_Post @udi_shaham Well, in fairness, it was three days of rage.
939897565788737536 2017-12-10 16:40:16 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @RealJamesWoods I'm with you. I'm long tulip bulbs!
939848187153612800 2017-12-10 13:24:04 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @StandWithUs Cowardly act. Prayers for the wounded man.
939535021873954816 2017-12-09 16:39:39 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @nytopinion @BretStephensNYT @arapp @matalaz @Sa_______d Arabs absolutely invaded. As did the ottomans, byzantines, and romans. Herein lies the problem. Many invaders to the land of Israel all claiming ownership. No reason all cannot live side by side in peace. Just takes reason and.....peace!
939506905340436480 2017-12-09 14:47:56 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @nytopinion @BretStephensNYT @Sa_______d @S_G_Alexander Agreed
939506760733351939 2017-12-09 14:47:21 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @nytopinion @BretStephensNYT @Sa_______d Do you know why Israel doesn't stamp foreign passports? Because many Islamic countries won't even let you in (let alone be a citizen) if the Israeli stamp is present. I have not spared Israel and pointed out that it is flawed. Apartheid? Not even close. Good chat!
939504026948956162 2017-12-09 14:36:29 UTC <FinanceGuru10> Well said!https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/12/08/opinion/jerusalem-denial-complex.html
939503622106353665 2017-12-09 14:34:53 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @nytopinion @BretStephensNYT @Sa_______d That's not true, but I get your point. The law of return however does not preclude others from requesting citizenship. Israel is about 74% Jewish with the remainder a wide mix. What kind of mix has Abu Mazen and Hamas proposed?
939497557608321024 2017-12-09 14:10:47 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @nytopinion @BretStephensNYT @Sa_______d Israel is not perfect. No pluralistic democracy is. But those are the key words "pluralistic democracy". Many of the Arab/Islamic states would do well to emulate the model. This of course, would require the reformation of Islam, separation of mosque and state.
939445229270290432 2017-12-09 10:42:51 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @IsraeliPM @netanyahu @Israel @AJEnglish @M_Sighil There are currently 10 Arab members of kinesset (under representative of the population to be sure). Palestinians are not Israeli citizens. They are free to participate in their own government.
939443869095284736 2017-12-09 10:37:27 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @haaretzcom @saladitte Right, because if your parents were dug up for a parking lot you'd be a ok with that.
939443190469361664 2017-12-09 10:34:45 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @AJEnglish @M_Sighil Israel is an open and inclusive society accommodating all. You should visit!
939429724123693059 2017-12-09 09:41:14 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @AJEnglish Except Jerusalem was founded by king David in 1010 bce, roughly 1600 years before Islam even existed. Keep trying to revise history, it's working well so far!
939428253915406337 2017-12-09 09:35:24 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @mkraju @brianstelter Well, at least we know @CNN has reliable sources!
939426845719760896 2017-12-09 09:29:48 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Let me help - don't!
939290120880082944 2017-12-08 00:26:30 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @clevelanddotcom Sensationalism at its finest. The US demonstrates about 5% of the signs that led to the third Reich. You got me on the click bait though! 
939286252729270272 2017-12-08 00:11:08 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @MrCavalier34 You da man AC!
939285256598970369 2017-12-08 00:07:10 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @dinakraft @haaretzcom I believe the president specifically mentioned the importance of Jerusalem to all Abrahamic religions. No one is asking you to leave. 
939284228356890625 2017-12-08 00:03:05 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN 
939265072030986240 2017-12-08 22:46:58 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @IDFSpokesperson @reid_gargramel Wrong. They control who comes and goes into Israel, as is their right. Hamas controls Gaza. We won't change each other's minds. Be well! :-)
939262419506954240 2017-12-08 22:36:26 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @IDFSpokesperson @reid_gargramel No Joe, they don't. I don't agree with every policy of Israel (i.e. Home destruction of pal criminals), but it's been a long haul. 
939261229264265216 2017-12-08 22:31:42 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @IDFSpokesperson @reid_gargramel Joe, if you'd focus more on specific policies you disagree with you'd be far more effective. There are no concentration camps in WB or Gaza.
939260113931718657 2017-12-08 22:27:16 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @IDFSpokesperson @reid_gargramel And Jews ain't loading Palestinians in trains to be gassed to death. False moral equivalence, but nice try.
939259875040821248 2017-12-08 22:26:19 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @IDFSpokesperson @reid_gargramel Concentration camp? You must be referring to the UNRWA refugee centers which have held Palestinians for 70 years, in their own land!
939259036339527681 2017-12-08 22:22:59 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TVTye @3DonovanLive @BetsyKling @wkyc3 @SaraShookman Havin a tito's! Did you see the Titos accident in Philly! I'm devastated!
939258705824149504 2017-12-08 22:21:40 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @BleacherReport Not sure which is a tougher draft caller ID to pick up, the browns or the armed service. Think I'd rather serve my country!
939256410881314817 2017-12-08 22:12:33 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @KhaledAbuToameh And by Palestine he means Israel. Ironically, ask an Israeli Arab if they prefer Netanyahu or haniyeh. May take a sec, but 80%+ go w/bibi!
939254820225069057 2017-12-08 22:06:14 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN All of those offices are in west J'lem, behind the green line. Not even the PA would expect Israel to give that up. Hysteria over nothing!
939253605810495488 2017-12-08 22:01:24 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @AP Has anyone else noticed many of these folks seem to get wealthier in service of their country? Hmmm.
939172977131827201 2017-12-08 16:41:01 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @realclearisrael @jihadwatchRS Let me know when they declare a "Day of Peace". I'd like to mark my calendar and hold onto the days newspaper!
939170158622466057 2017-12-08 16:29:49 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @nmladenov To be clear, Palestinians pray toward Mecca (with their asses facing the dome of the rock). Every Jew faces J'slem. False equivalence.
939164220859518976 2017-12-08 16:06:13 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Mediaite @secupp While I disagree with her politics she is right to question the immediate assumption of truth. Lives are being ruined on claims. Need truth!
938971748934053889 2017-12-07 03:21:24 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CillizzaCNN @CNN @bfoster204 No question, but that was not mentioned in the articles' meticulous detail. If that's the case, yes, that's harassment...and really creepy!
938960256381661184 2017-12-07 02:35:44 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @GovMikeHuckabee @chelseahandler Actually, a feminist is someone who strives for equal rights for women. Everything else you state is called a "sympathizer" or "empathizer"
938954947915329536 2017-12-07 02:14:39 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CillizzaCNN @CNN Well I agree with brevity. Not sure (without context or detail, which you admit you do not have) how talking about surrogacy is harassment.
938948907454943232 2017-12-07 01:50:39 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @lsarsour The appointee will be a woman. Guaranteed.
938933780277899265 2017-12-07 00:50:32 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Cernovich And....our university system folks. Ironic these academics find the rest of us inferior.

938919602268106756 2017-12-07 23:54:12 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Ostrov_A Arabic can be tricky. You missed the dialect. It's "No Palestinian state without Israel". I'm fluent!
938917008934080514 2017-12-07 23:43:53 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @zerohedge What could go wrong?
938913742204690432 2017-12-07 23:30:54 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @AmyMek "Now" muslims will show their rage? What have the last 1400 years been, the Age of Peace and Harmony?
938882159334576130 2017-12-07 21:25:25 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @secupp But we need a UNSC meeting immediately in response to US recognizing Jerusalem as Israels capital! This is the UN.
938876065115713536 2017-12-07 21:01:12 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @KofiAnnan What exactly has not recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of a sovereign Israel achieved since 1949. Do you have a plan other than statusquo

938822947300675585 2017-12-07 17:30:07 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Jerusalem_Post Wait, he didn't express his love of the Jewish people? It's only the zionists he wishes to destroy?
938821992500858881 2017-12-07 17:26:20 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera How many times since the 2nd intifada has hamas called for a 3rd? Hint - every day! Remove head from sand any time.

938789172646699008 2017-12-07 15:15:55 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TimListerCNN @CNN That's comical. 5X they have been offered statehood, and rejected it. Could it be they do not want a state, but the destruction of Israel?
938788782333202432 2017-12-07 15:14:22 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN And tulip bulbs!
938725013921959937 2017-12-07 11:00:58 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @secupp As she types from her smartphone containing Israeli technology.

938589353877688320 2017-12-06 02:01:54 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN There is no peace process. This move acknowledges reality. Israel would never offer Jerusalem in a settlement. Deal with reality.

938494444424359936 2017-12-06 19:44:46 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Rejection is the Arab way!
938409838975049729 2017-12-06 14:08:35 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @StCollinson @CNN The region has been unstable since sykes-piccoult. There is no peace process and the arabs have not changed their stance since '48. Truth
938408439889518592 2017-12-06 14:03:01 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @GeraldoRivera So we should wait until it peaks again? This is buy high, sell low logic.
938407701079580672 2017-12-06 14:00:05 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @deanofcomedy Ridiculous. The Arab position has not changed since 1948. They will not settle for anything less than all of Israel. They admit such.
936350022244950017 2017-11-30 21:43:36 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @haaretzcom But killing gay Iranians is absolutely fine. How anyone takes these people seriously is beyond me.
936346942367584262 2017-11-30 21:31:22 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @NolteNC Your points are valid and correct. The knee jerk reaction and rush to judgement is astounding. As if there's never been a false claim.
936284340828372992 2017-11-30 17:22:36 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN To borrow from the great @Will___Ferrell, Matt Lauer can suck it! Pervert!
936282518663331840 2017-11-30 17:15:22 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @GeraldoRivera And consequences for false claims. Currently it's a 'protected claim' so nothing happens to the accuser even if claim is false.
935695688108789760 2017-11-28 02:23:31 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @drose we want ya on the cavs man!CLE!
935638218904690688 2017-11-28 22:35:09 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Well this is true to some degree. Less dress, more behavior. To pretend that women don't at least sometimes. Ring it on, is foolish.
935636981333331973 2017-11-28 22:30:14 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN And.....she's right.
935565984022384640 2017-11-28 17:48:07 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @BenjaminSWatson Don't disagree, but accused does not mean guilty. Yes, there are women with faulty moral compasses too...looking for $$$
932758933390987264 2017-11-20 23:53:54 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CampyRussell Really like that tie/shirt/jacket combo Campy! Nice!
931314747202572289 2017-11-16 00:15:13 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Accused? Is that his wife? So because it was before he became senator, no need to resign? 1984!
930860369266008064 2017-11-15 18:09:41 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Rrrrnessa @CNN @RotherhamUK Xenophobic? And the Muslim majority Arab countries are bastions of diversity? Imagine entrances saying "no muslims". Now go to Saudi Arabia.
930859613641232390 2017-11-15 18:06:41 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN @CountryLiving02 @brandon_r_horan @mariley2 Tell me of the tolerance in Muslim countries. How many Jews and Christians live in Saudi Arabia? Iraq? UAE? You embrace a farce.
930858301436416000 2017-11-15 18:01:28 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @PamelaGeller The Romans did much for civilization. Without the Jews there would be no civilization.
929058988246880257 2017-11-10 18:51:38 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @RealJamesWoods The clintons have DOZENS in their direct relation with suicide, died under mysterious means or disappeared. How many do the rest of us know?
929056323127447552 2017-11-10 18:41:03 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @PoliticalIslam @ClareMLopez Exactly what g-d needs man to kill on his/her behalf? Doesn't seem so omniscient at that point. Just sayin!

929053251093368833 2017-11-10 18:28:50 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @SohrabAhmari Important to keep in mind that there are also many false claims of harassment. It's a protected claim (wrongfully so) so no fault if untrue.

929050790894895104 2017-11-10 18:19:04 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @ACLU BS. Integrity in the voting system demands verification of legal US citizen status. Stop it with your garbage already.

925764963041464320 2017-11-01 16:42:21 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @GeraldoRivera = police state. Perhaps Islam is in need of a reformation? Just a thought.
925764419304546306 2017-11-01 16:40:12 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @rabiasquared As with everything, context and experience matter. No one believes all muslims are terrorists. Everyone knows Islam is rife w/extremism.

906602805582065664 2017-09-09 19:38:47 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @secupp The climate is always changing. It's a complex system which we have limited data and understanding of.
898260370585812993 2017-08-17 19:08:55 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @prageru Shouldn't there be an 'N' for just plain normal?
898257895044689920 2017-08-17 18:59:05 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @AmerZahr But celebrating martyrs in Palestine who killed women and children is a ok! Quite the comedian! :-)

897131067848753152 2017-08-14 16:21:29 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @POTUS @JohnKerry I don't condone violence, EVER, but to pretend there aren't two extremist groups here is naive at best, deliberately misleading at worst.
894653612974067712 2017-08-07 20:16:57 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN I always thought you simply separate. No need to bring ink and paper into this process, save that for divorce!

886182458735112192 2017-07-15 11:15:37 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN @mrs_itch @navi_tavi @2020willbeblue Pre-feminism perhaps. That has not been the case for 50 years. Don't get me wrong, I'm thankful for yoga pants!
886181684114321408 2017-07-15 11:12:32 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Well at least they're tackling the major issues facing our nation. Their constituents must be beaming with pride.
885589987546337280 2017-07-13 20:01:21 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @NolteNC Cluster B personality disorder with this one.
885172319282487297 2017-07-12 16:21:41 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @JonahNRO Brockmire.
885172042051584002 2017-07-12 16:20:35 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN And why does his opinion matter? What makes him qualified to speak on behalf of all Americans?
878959913468395520 2017-06-25 12:55:48 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Or we could plant them in different areas. Just a thought.
872409594693398528 2017-06-07 11:07:10 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN I wonder, do all of you realize no one believes any of you any more. The bias in the media, all media, hurts truth. This isn't journlsm
872408875898724358 2017-06-07 11:04:19 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @IllimitableMan Just remember, there is a man somewhere who finds this woman attractive. Let that sink in.
872083161202778113 2017-06-06 13:30:02 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN The ramadan bomb-a-thon continues. Eat a snickers man, you get grumpy when you're hungry!
871322058420092928 2017-06-04 11:05:41 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @rogerkimball @AndrewCMcCarthy @newcriterion I suggest allowing light snacks during Ramadan. These people get extra violent when hungry!
870961207628500992 2017-06-03 11:11:48 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @HillaryClinton @prageru Losing it! Inside the world of a narcissistic sociopath.
870960498111647744 2017-06-03 11:08:59 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN That's wonderful. Now go visit Obamas. Oh wait.
870960184184762369 2017-06-03 11:07:44 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN He's right, but let's keep in mind that about 300 million Indians have no plumbing!
870597252670160896 2017-06-02 11:05:34 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @LisaBloom This should go really well. Might want to google histrionic personality disorder first.
870233488624164864 2017-06-01 11:00:06 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Classic narcissistic sociopath. It's never their fault. Always someone to blame. Don't get me wrong, sitting POTUS is too! #NutsInDC
869865836412096512 2017-05-31 10:39:11 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Doesn't she work for you? What does CNN think?
867489615678255104 2017-05-24 21:16:56 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @slone That's Rabbi Letterman to you slone!
867486490414260225 2017-05-24 21:04:31 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Listen, I'm no yuge trump fan, but the level of biased BS attacks on he and his family by your organization has reached absurdity.
867486112364756993 2017-05-24 21:03:00 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN he seems totally rational.
866273007093903360 2017-05-21 12:42:34 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN I have trouble locating many 30 year old critical thinkers, 3rd graders are simply mimicking what they here from adults. Try journalism
864434106167427072 2017-05-16 10:55:25 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @AmerZahr Course, then there's archaeology. "They" have never said you don't belong and 1.5M of "you" live peacefully in Israel. Wake up.
864430509631438848 2017-05-16 10:41:08 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN A truly sad story. That said, being dependent on government for care is a slippery slope. There are better ways.
863729626681626624 2017-05-14 12:16:04 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @marclamonthill You are aware that the PA pays the families of terrorists who kill women and children are you not. Not a policy of peace.
863347323191140352 2017-05-13 10:56:56 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN How much have they lost over the last 1000 years? Just curious.
862260960106606592 2017-05-10 11:00:07 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN @rev_lordson @turk_lander @PiaScuro Public isn't personal.
861702225214795776 2017-05-08 21:59:54 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN @DoubleA0317 He's your POTUS too. Sorry, but it's true.
860814647414464513 2017-05-06 11:12:59 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CillizzaCNN @CNN You lose all credibility as a "news" organization when you publish biased material like this. Hire a journalist already!
859930655513333763 2017-05-03 00:40:19 UTC <FinanceGuru10> Congrats @KingJames on another milestone! So happy to watch you #begreatness in CLE! Mazel Tov!
858695390551572480 2017-04-30 14:51:49 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @JeffreyGoldberg Do you believe there is no difference in manner of entry? Breaking our laws on entry isn't a great start to productivity.
857583271332519936 2017-04-27 13:12:39 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN should men carry a breathalyzer? What's dead drunk mean? 1 drink, 3?
857200343117115392 2017-04-26 11:51:02 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN If this we're true, wouldn't hospitals only hire women? Why would they pay more for equal work? Something doesn't add up.
857194357228810240 2017-04-26 11:27:15 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @khamenei_ir I suspect you didn't get what you needed as a child and Islam didn't provide it either. You need therapy my man!
855451934194634752 2017-04-21 16:03:29 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @secupp is he tweeting from the summer home?
855020637810827264 2017-04-20 11:29:40 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @reason @JohnStossel I don't know the facts here, but I do know thousands of men lose their livelihoods over false harassment charges.
855017138003861504 2017-04-20 11:15:45 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @pretareporter @THR @NolteNC Well the beholder in this case has different taste than many men I know. Cute, yes. Worlds most beautiful, not.
855014321457438727 2017-04-20 11:04:34 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @haaretzcom And...you just lost more readers! Levy is a classic douchebag!
854817929363378176 2017-04-19 22:04:10 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @KhaledAbuToameh while applauding the killing of Jews and rewarding the killers families. Just wanted to finish the headline for ya. :-)
854657093831405569 2017-04-19 11:25:04 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @toddmillionaire Telling fact of the Facebook murderer: He was 37, his mother was 53. Do the math.
854649448974176257 2017-04-19 10:54:41 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @shlomikliab The farce is strong with this one!
853944253772427264 2017-04-17 12:12:30 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN I suspect this has more to do with the abandoning of traditional gender roles, secularism, and zero wage growth than the POTUS. 2cents
853668239695589379 2017-04-16 17:55:43 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @AmerZahr It's these obfuscations of history that illegitimate your message. Jesus was a Judean. There was no Palestine during his life.
852257893663559680 2017-04-12 20:31:30 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @shlomikliab It really started as a 'nationality' with Arafat. Before that many Arabs would be offended if you called them Palestinian. Emet
852257467161554944 2017-04-12 20:29:49 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Oy Vey! It was a stupid comment by a less-than-stellar press sec. probably not a good idea to defend it.
852257166627139584 2017-04-12 20:28:37 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TreyYingst @Liz_Wheeler My wife does the same shit all the time. Drives me nuts!!
852064684245233664 2017-04-12 07:43:45 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @NYDailyNews @shlomikliab The sensitivity of some is ridiculous. Poor statement, not holocaust denial. Next topic.
851524423601487874 2017-04-10 19:56:57 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @slone Not sure I could disagree more. These are signs you need to work at your relationship. We love what we work hard at. Poor advice.
850300744888725505 2017-04-07 10:54:30 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN in 2013 I thought CNN was a Cable news channel. Today, not so much. Situations change.
850053007551193090 2017-04-06 18:30:04 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN You mean they used the Harry Reid option following the Biden rule. FIFY
849951954017058816 2017-04-06 11:48:31 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN I drove home last night after having too much to drink, but it was only undocumented so I'm good.
848860255928950784 2017-04-03 11:30:30 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @WomenintheWorld @CNN Truthfully, feminism doesn't seem to have done much good for women (or men). Femininity beats feminism.
848731850340274178 2017-04-02 03:00:16 UTC <FinanceGuru10> #ACMs What a well done show. Congrats to all the artists and the #ACMs for a job well done !
848515092371177472 2017-04-02 12:38:57 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN If granny wants what's best, she should recognize kindness and tell her grandson to take a girl his own age.Nice gesture, taken too far
847489128807780352 2017-03-30 16:42:08 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Nope, media does it to themselves with "narrative journalism".
847048256022556673 2017-03-29 11:30:16 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN so Americans are incapable of leading the world in a particular field unless the government is involved? I never knew!
846687016385433600 2017-03-28 11:34:50 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN @AndresD3000 @ibrawill08 @anniela The stoning of women is not in the Torah. The only stoning Jews do is in Colorado.
845629929404469248 2017-03-25 13:34:20 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Any facts to report here or just the decision? Is it possible she ruled that the woman consented to sex? Poor journalism.
845628857818501120 2017-03-25 13:30:05 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN So she ruled it was consensual. These are tough cases and to place a headline highlighting the decision w/o facts is poor journalism.
842694495552618496 2017-03-17 11:09:58 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @IllimitableMan Or Jews. Oh wait.
842434947134697472 2017-03-16 17:58:37 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TheAtlantic @elainejgodfrey @JeffreyGoldberg Oddly, they don't sound so independent anymore.
842388485759725568 2017-03-16 14:54:00 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TarekFatah Those women appear to have gender identity issues. :-)
840999825504104448 2017-03-12 18:55:58 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @PamelaGeller Try Galil Mountain wines. They're very good! Cool place to visit too!
840968938653659137 2017-03-12 16:53:14 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TheModerateMan Politics was never meant to be a career. Do your service then go back to your job. Lifetime pensions!! Term limits now!!
839709624894914562 2017-03-08 05:29:10 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @slone Resist? Is she speaking to her husbands accusers?
838443625461723136 2017-03-05 17:38:32 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @JonahNRO Crazy Climber, those damn flower pots!
838441883751886849 2017-03-05 17:31:37 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @JonahNRO @JasonForbes6 Butter knife here! Classic!
838440134919979008 2017-03-05 17:24:40 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @JonahNRO Gorf and track & field were up there. Good list!
838032764674924546 2017-03-04 14:25:55 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN no one could have seen this coming.
837358188685033474 2017-03-02 17:45:24 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @realDonaldTrump @slone Exactly who is the divisive leader here! Please just go play golf and give a speech or two Mr. Obama!!
837357059813347333 2017-03-02 17:40:55 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @KhaledAbuToameh And the 22 Islamic states have provided exactly what for values and civilization? Utter nonsense.
837063507040432129 2017-03-01 22:14:26 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @IllimitableMan @Donovan_Sharpe I just threw up in my mouth, but to each his onus.
837062581097488385 2017-03-01 22:10:45 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TheAtlantic @yayitsrob @JeffreyGoldberg My crocuses won't make it! :-(
833067516452859904 2017-02-18 21:35:48 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @cnnbrk Except he isn't suppressing anything.
833018466324058112 2017-02-18 18:20:53 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @19Weather @SaraGoldenberg we should encourage people to use as much aerosol as possible and always leave the car idling! :-)
830779799832502272 2017-02-12 14:05:14 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @IDFSpokesperson @ZurinBondi This is the problem in a nutshell. Israel has offered peace many times. The Arab response - it's all ours.
830779349540405250 2017-02-12 14:03:26 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @IDFSpokesperson @ZurinBondi before 1964, when the world referred to Palestinians, they meant Jews. There's no "P" in Arabic. Farce.
830777341194428416 2017-02-12 13:55:27 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @realDonaldTrump Oh Vey! I'm beginning to second guess my vote. News flash - you're not the greatest human being to walk the earth #gotowirk
830460917963976706 2017-02-11 16:58:06 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @khamenei_ir Readiness for what exactly?
830401963686842368 2017-02-11 13:03:50 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TarekFatah I've been in many synagogues. I have never heard a rabbi ask g-d for the death of any living thing.
827557112750424064 2017-02-03 16:39:25 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @realDonaldTrump Here I'm thinking of ways to soften this. There's simply no defense for this tweet. You're the President man!
827555587315662848 2017-02-03 16:33:21 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @michaeldickson @uVbeenDUPLIC8ED @FoxNews Do we know the motive yet?
826794848074203136 2017-02-01 14:10:27 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @haaretzcom Just my opinion of course, but haaretz is dangerous for Jews. There, I said it! :-)
826182849447489545 2017-01-30 21:38:35 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN I am 100% confident if they can make a car drive itself, they can work around a 90 travel restriction on 7 countries.
826150934090809348 2017-01-30 19:31:46 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @zerohedge But no burkinis on our beaches dammit!!
825848151907192837 2017-01-29 23:28:37 UTC <FinanceGuru10> Now these same 7 countries have mass protests! Of wait.....carry on chief!pic.twitter.com/ZcXLmBBZob
825847041737756673 2017-01-29 23:24:12 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @POTUS Are you aware that Iran has now placed the US on "double secret great Satan"? Our ally Israel is now "super little Satan"!
825845112215367680 2017-01-29 23:16:32 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @realclearisrael I'm confident the 7 countries subject to a 90 day travel ban are having rallies too! #foolspic.twitter.com/rlFymvCDxT
825804528192782336 2017-01-29 20:35:16 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Neither CNN, so perhaps he's on to something here! Really, CNN, this is ridiculous. No one is proposing an end to immigration.#Getagrip
825757311809552384 2017-01-29 17:27:39 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @JeffreyGoldberg As a Jew, Zionist and American, I have zero problem with that statement.
825756908799799296 2017-01-29 17:26:03 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @AmerZahr Except had the Muslim community taken a stronger stand against radical Islam, many would see moderate Islam as an ally, as do I.
825741670725644296 2017-01-29 16:25:30 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @RealJamesWoods "Our children are watching". Progressives always project their own poor behavior on others. Guaranteed!
825706813928648708 2017-01-29 14:06:59 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN did you do a similar piece for Obamas 6 month Iraq refugee ban? Hypocrisy is ridiculous with this network.
825403611169558528 2017-01-28 18:02:10 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @haaretzcom War on illegal immigration. Try the truth, it feels good.
825357855578537990 2017-01-28 15:00:21 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN @MedvedSHOW Not to worry, no one watches CNN!
825356077747277824 2017-01-28 14:53:17 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @ChrisMurphyCT Did you just get this job? Where ya been while hundreds of thousands of Syrians have lost their lives? The farce is strong!
825001785593053184 2017-01-27 15:25:28 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @AndySchapiro Jews don't behead non-believers. By the way, FDR turned hundreds of Jews back to Europe because they were a threat.
825001236101550081 2017-01-27 15:23:17 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TheModerateMan @AndySchapiro Reminds one of FDR claiming Jews threatened national security and turned the boats back to Europe.
824645912375001089 2017-01-26 15:51:21 UTC <FinanceGuru10> She doesn't want government involved in her healthcare, but has no problem with govt funding of her healthcare. 
824636535958081538 2017-01-26 15:14:05 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN How many refugees have the Saudis, Qataris and Emirati allowed in during this 6 year civil war? Even the Israelis will allow children.
824386341677006848 2017-01-25 22:39:54 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Mudar_Zahran I've always enjoyed your tweets, but this is my favorite! :-)
824385462865428480 2017-01-25 22:36:25 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @IllimitableMan @NeroSthlm Oy Vey! I suppose the only saving grace here is they're both kids, and kids are stupid. 21 to drink, 18 to vote.
824381752139534336 2017-01-25 22:21:40 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @jaketapper @JeffreyGoldberg I don't think @POTUS is suggesting this is a fraud by one side, rather that an electric bill is insufficient ID
824312154572652556 2017-01-25 17:45:07 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN So moving the embassy to the capital of Israel, a city not mentioned once in Quran, is war? K. :-)
824244993275691008 2017-01-25 13:18:14 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN @Hill4America Breitbart claims to be a far right news and opinion outlet. Just need to know where you're getting info. ;)
824243261925629953 2017-01-25 13:11:21 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @PamelaGeller Except Jerusalem isn't even mentioned in the Quran. The farce is strong with this one!
823992022000340992 2017-01-24 20:33:01 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @cnnbrk In fairness, there is very little data on this subject and studies have found conflicting info. That's non-biased news baby!
823970164974743553 2017-01-24 19:06:10 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @secupp Well thanks S.E.! For a moment there I thought we were going to be rounded up!
823903456129937408 2017-01-24 14:41:05 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN She meant 'give a blow job at the white house'? How silly of us to misinterpret!

823896147118985218 2017-01-24 14:12:03 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @epavard Not just Jerusalem. From the river to the sea babe!
823579087679655938 2017-01-23 17:12:10 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @GlennKesslerWP @JeffreyGoldberg Accomplishment = zero
823577815467565056 2017-01-23 17:07:07 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @RealJamesWoods These folks are straight up bat shit crazy.
823235465918693378 2017-01-22 18:26:44 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @IllimitableMan @AStullkowski people hate Jews because Judaism is in opposition to tyranny. Jews make bad subjects.
823190766952579072 2017-01-22 15:29:07 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @haaretzcom She's a real catch. Her parents must be so proud.
823176499268349953 2017-01-22 14:32:25 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN You just have to pass it to find out what's in it.
819533099134500866 2017-01-12 13:14:51 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @secupp And just think, someone's married to that!
818900726135066624 2017-01-10 19:22:02 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Yet you still employ Fareed Zakaria. 
818823315724894208 2017-01-10 14:14:26 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @prageru Has she watched a movie recently?
818822966968459266 2017-01-10 14:13:02 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @KhaledAbuToameh What is this peace process he's referring to?
818152521541832706 2017-01-08 17:48:56 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN How much does keeping it in place cost?
818152162358333443 2017-01-08 17:47:30 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @khamenei_ir enemies of whom? Radical Islamic regimes? Agreed!
817413425735331840 2017-01-06 16:52:02 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @KhaledAbuToameh Hysterical. Remind me how often Jerusalem is mentioned in the Quran? Zero you say. Yes, war indeed.
817117680507514880 2017-01-05 21:16:51 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @WashTimes @slone The hypocrisy of the left is astounding. Imagine mobs of white people rioting and chanting no justice no peace. Oh yeah
817117064200650754 2017-01-05 21:14:24 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN but it won't cause job gains either.
817093116868120581 2017-01-05 19:39:14 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @AmerZahr A wounded Palestinian Assailant. I think quite highly of my non-violent Palestinian friends. Israel punishes, fatah names schools.
816427591586500608 2017-01-03 23:34:40 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @cnnbrk @WestGaylor Now if she names him Thriller.....:-)
816426524631068672 2017-01-03 23:30:26 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @cnnbrk @WestGaylor You have your opinion, I have mine. We need not agree. Cheers and happy new year!
816424806677626880 2017-01-03 23:23:37 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @cnnbrk @WestGaylor That's selfish too! Just don't think it's fair to a toddler to have an AARP member as a parent. To each her own though.
816412072485486592 2017-01-03 22:33:00 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @cnnbrk Incredibly selfish. Best of luck on the 4th grade bike hike, at age 60!
816312122078535683 2017-01-03 15:55:50 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TheModerateMan @rosalokey @politicalteach Never said it was universally dangerous. The mere fact that it can be, requires reform.
816259595618361344 2017-01-03 12:27:07 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @creepingsharia @uVbeenDUPLIC8ED I love the logic of these photos. "Our attack did little damage but their response did a lot". Don't attack
816257702099910656 2017-01-03 12:19:36 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TheModerateMan @rosalokey @politicalteach Or at the very least reformed. A Muslim reformation is needed and it must come from within.
816257297328599040 2017-01-03 12:17:59 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TheModerateMan @rosalokey @politicalteach Not radicals, "purists". A book that can be interpreted literally to mean "kill", ought be banned
816256563941953541 2017-01-03 12:15:04 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @UN_HRC @HillelNeuer LOL
815915644495532032 2017-01-02 13:40:23 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @khamenei_ir *no ability
815915549758779394 2017-01-02 13:40:00 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @khamenei_ir So we can live in a totalitarian regime with ability to defend ourselves from corruption. Guns don't kill, people kill.
815674276359639040 2017-01-01 21:41:16 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Use the bat signal! The penguin has returned!
815673892262019075 2017-01-01 21:39:45 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @PamelaGeller You mean "apartheid wall".
811214558899617792 2016-12-20 14:19:57 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN @HonestReporting @uVbeenDUPLIC8ED Of course we are.

808243799679963136 2016-12-12 09:35:12 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TheDonaldSports I have a sneaking suspicion you don't know any Jewish people. Just a hunch. Merry Christmas!
808239567195308032 2016-12-12 09:18:23 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TheDonaldSports They have lots of kids too! But you're right, since a Jew wrote the article, they must all be the same. Silly of me! :-)
807950385881223169 2016-12-11 14:09:17 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @YahooFinance I've never read an obituary that said "he/she is survived by their checking account".
807942295131713536 2016-12-11 13:37:08 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN I'm old enough to remember when CNN was a news outlet.
806485324151062528 2016-12-07 13:07:39 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN @KingJames has done a great job of staying above the political fray in his career. This is a mistake.

803983828532527104 2016-11-30 15:27:36 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @AnneBayefsky mI would expect we'll see arson in the US soon as well.
803764224296189952 2016-11-29 00:54:58 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @GeraldoRivera Oy Vey Geraldo! You're defending Fidel Castro. Really?! R u high?
803668685634334720 2016-11-29 18:35:20 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @RealAlexJones @mlw975 Correction, it resembles Palestinian attacks on civilians. Soon you'll see wildfires.
802193775254765568 2016-11-25 16:54:34 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN You know, Israel is literally on fire throughout the country from arson and this is your Middle East story?
801554609408004097 2016-11-23 22:34:45 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @khamenei_ir Ballistic missiles, heavy water....were coming for ya! ;-)
801037562110353409 2016-11-22 12:20:12 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @JaredWyand Ironically, the media (public companies) and the left are about as anti Israel as can be. You're getting bad info.
798250346095267840 2016-11-14 19:44:47 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN and the NFL wonders why their ratings are sinking. If you have no respect for the USA, you're welcome to emigrate.

797210797235650560 2016-11-11 22:54:00 UTC <FinanceGuru10> Ironic that the protestors are marching in the cities that voted for HRC. Time to stop with the protests and rally around our new President!
789228919081676800 2016-10-20 22:16:52 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Munster_1488 Follow the money. Look at r largest arms deals over 10 yrs. then look at largest contributors to pols. Bread crumbs!
789228105432834048 2016-10-20 22:13:38 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Munster_1488 our weapons manufacturers are legal for profit businesses, no sales occur without gov approval. Agree again, gov is corrupt!
789224185075671040 2016-10-20 21:58:03 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Munster_1488 See, we do agree on something. I never once said we should be arming the barbarians. Focus less on the avatar, more on issues.
789215967523975168 2016-10-20 21:25:24 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Munster_1488 Oh, you mean freedom, justice, democracy, capitalism is what I stand for? You nailed it! Give yourself 100 points! :-)
789172725537312769 2016-10-20 18:33:34 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @DrJillStein Telling for profit corporations what they can produce? Sounds like communism just a bit.

786672173226332163 2016-10-13 20:57:16 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Orwell was right. You don't even pretend to present news any longer. 100% spin for team Dem. Pathetic.

777523045783121921 2016-09-18 15:01:54 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @khamenei_ir To others, prosperity and freedoms are greatly enhanced. Separate religion and state and allow freedom to all Iranians. Scared?
777456573899612160 2016-09-18 10:37:46 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @shlomikliab Except the vast majority have never stepped a foot inside Israel. Why are there refugees inside the West Bank? $$$
777455810037153792 2016-09-18 10:34:44 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @shim_rational @uVbeenDUPLIC8ED @samthejewishguy Not at all. But I also don't apologize either. Isis isn't extreme Islam, it's pure Islam.
777455375012421633 2016-09-18 10:33:00 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @shim_rational @uVbeenDUPLIC8ED @samthejewishguy But do they? Do Jews impose a tax on non-Jews? Do Christians behead non-Christians?
777145946312351744 2016-09-17 14:03:26 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @shim_rational @samthejewishguy @uVbeenDUPLIC8ED What she said ^
777104821832724480 2016-09-17 11:20:02 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @shim_rational @samthejewishguy What are they trying to be independent of?
777102532724215808 2016-09-17 11:10:56 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @shim_rational @samthejewishguy And let's not even talk about tolerance! I'll meet you in Riyadh for tea!
777102349781176320 2016-09-17 11:10:12 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @shim_rational @samthejewishguy To ignore the fact that one group has a large # of adherents that kill in the name of their g-d is folly.
777100688530604033 2016-09-17 11:03:36 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @DrJillStein 58% of Americans also know absolutely nothing about economics and the medical industry. Free stuff always sounds good.
774953634631065600 2016-09-11 12:51:59 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Ostrov_A @christo89228784 This guys clueless. Everyone knows it was Mossad! :-)
773924013533908992 2016-09-08 16:40:38 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @thehill @slone Maybe they should investigate why Americans pay 100's% more for prescriptions than every other nation on earth!
773922578264043520 2016-09-08 16:34:56 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @AdamMilstein Is that a sharkskin suit?
773604150710038528 2016-09-07 19:29:37 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @SohrabAhmari @DavidFeith Erosion happens over eons. Explosions happen quickly! He knew exactly what he was doing - reducing US role.
773481117508771840 2016-09-07 11:20:43 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @rogerwaters @DrJillStein Except he doesn't. He merely stands against Israel/Jews. Is Hamas the solution? Fatah? No, but waters doesn't care
773157167893475329 2016-09-06 13:53:28 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN perhaps "In Australia, women do not receive pay raises as frequently as men", would be more representative of the info presented?
773088853565382657 2016-09-06 09:22:00 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @DrJillStein What about people who already paid back their student loans? Do they get a refund? That would seem fair.
773088165049487360 2016-09-06 09:19:16 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @khamenei_ir Interesting you call this treason and not just crime. Let's non-Muslims know your thoughts of the world we all share.

772522408330743808 2016-09-04 19:51:09 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @MoveOn Absolute BS. Read hate crime statistics. Read number of people killed by police. Read inner city crime stats. Victim BS!
772490624066957312 2016-09-04 17:44:51 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @AbbyMartin @telesurenglish @EmpireFiles Why are there Palestinian refugees inside Palestine? $$$$ to the PA.
771663978422415361 2016-09-02 11:00:03 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @MedvedSHOW I'd be more concerned about Dennis Rodman in No. Korea.
771044678452047872 2016-08-31 17:59:11 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN It would be great if you guys could interview Seth Rich regarding working with HRC and DNC but....
771024009215381505 2016-08-31 16:37:03 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @ymenken @TheRealTzvi All valid points, but it should be noted that this occurring not only in Judaism, but across all faiths in the US.
771023208682180609 2016-08-31 16:33:52 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @KhaledAbuToameh @GatestoneInst Good article!

770950700536700928 2016-08-31 11:45:45 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @NolteNC That's anti-Zionism John! Get with the program. /sarc
768496692794712068 2016-08-24 17:14:24 UTC <FinanceGuru10> Perhaps we should let Hashem do the judging.  https://twitter.com/torahlectures/status/768492815051583488
768474135848710145 2016-08-24 15:44:46 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @elderofziyon Soros is as anti-Zionist as they come.

766983752132071424 2016-08-20 13:02:31 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Smells sorta like freedom, just tastes different.
766978574725226496 2016-08-20 12:41:56 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @shim_rational @rashidgill5 IDF = Irgun. R u not trying to equate a moral army with what was once deemed a terror outfit?
766976822344978432 2016-08-20 12:34:58 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @KDVSprole @rashidgill5 @shim_rational Cool Avatar. Irgun was formed as a response to Arab massacres of Jews. No secret there.
766963099060482048 2016-08-20 11:40:26 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @PersianRose1 Are they not allowed to smile now? They look miserable.
765610949055242241 2016-08-16 18:07:29 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @benjycannon @haaretzcom Perhaps a viable Democrat candidate? I don't like all the things trump says, but I sure don't like what she DOES
765532671258791938 2016-08-16 12:56:26 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @DrJillStein Do you have any solutions to articulate or are you just repeating talking points?
765281189988929536 2016-08-15 20:17:08 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @AP_Sports @Nehemia_G That pretty much sums up the Arab Israeli conflict!
765270785451823104 2016-08-15 19:35:47 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @DebbieSchlussel I recall his coverage in July of 2014 and thought "This guy is Jewish?" Blatant misrepresentation of the conflict.
765269874386079744 2016-08-15 19:32:10 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Is CNN even a news network anymore?
765197135885307904 2016-08-15 14:43:08 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @jeremybob1 @Jerusalem_Post Perhaps the discipline should include buying her a nice new bike!
765180406752829440 2016-08-15 13:36:39 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN @PrincessDracul4 Actually, there's little evidence they actually gave half of those speeches. Just $ for influence.
765179910990229504 2016-08-15 13:34:41 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Marissa Mayer made way more than that running yahoo into the ground! #wageinequality
764933684155650048 2016-08-14 21:16:16 UTC <FinanceGuru10> Is @POTUS going to interrupt vacation to address #Milwaukee, or is he working on another playlist?
764856720719908864 2016-08-14 16:10:27 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @MSNBC Why doesn't @CNN or @msnbc cover any of this?https://twitter.com/prisonplanet/status/764763330980511745
764836349560008704 2016-08-14 14:49:30 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @ClintSmithIII 26) All of what you have mentioned has happened to other minorities throughout their histories. What is your solution?

764460346127949825 2016-08-13 13:55:24 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @DrJillStein And who promotes Wahhabism around the globe! But of course we gave $400m in unmarked cash to the ayatollah too, so......yeah!
764459782392520707 2016-08-13 13:53:09 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @shim_rational @SedeVacanteCath You do realize those are the tribes of Israel in the map right? The Jewish tribes?
764456019242000386 2016-08-13 13:38:12 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @joe_nuzz @patf304 Islam caused ISIS and Al Qaeda, Al Shabab, Boko Haram, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, AQIP, Taliban. But you blame US?
764436307552501760 2016-08-13 12:19:52 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @shim_rational @DavidicLineage Golda Meir was referring to the land, not its inhabitants. They were Arabs and Jews, which they are today.

764428422240174080 2016-08-13 11:48:32 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @DrJillStein I assure you, they're not going to just lay down their arms. But we do agree, demilitarization of Islam is the only way we win!
764424904439582721 2016-08-13 11:34:34 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @JonahNRO @DrJillStein She's right. ISIS would be like the peace corps if not for us weapons. #nothingtodowithislam
764187165253312512 2016-08-12 19:49:52 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @JackHeretik @FreeBeacon Basically sums up the Arab-Israel conflict. Arabs lost, Israel extends hand of peace, Arabs refuse.
764159973492482048 2016-08-12 18:01:49 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Mudar_Zahran Yet the Israelis continue to extend their hands in peace.

763088838449389568 2016-08-09 19:05:31 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @slone I thinks it's up to 4 or 5 now. Seriously!

762899329942220800 2016-08-08 06:32:28 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN So the examples you give are women who took over their fathers companies? Earned it the hard way eh?
762662048438157317 2016-08-08 14:49:36 UTC <FinanceGuru10> How does @POTUS Obama view Jewish rights in Israel? Much differently than Muslim rights?              http://goo.gl/VZvje2 Obamas legacy
762652350376972289 2016-08-08 14:11:04 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN So first he says the shouldn't be allowed to get pregnant but if they discover they have Zika after conception, they shouldn't abort?

762344493043490816 2016-08-07 17:47:45 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @marcorubio @TheModerateMan @MartinPengelly Better still, what if they find out after conception? Should they be allow to abort?
762343757278613504 2016-08-07 17:44:50 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TheModerateMan Beirut was once the Paris of the Middle East.

761932171133145088 2016-08-06 14:29:20 UTC <FinanceGuru10> Dramatically reduce your chance of death at the hands of police by avoiding criminal activity. Pro tip.
761931474857623552 2016-08-06 14:26:34 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @WesleyLowery @slarimer Clearly a breakdown in policing, but these are fast paced life and death situations. Mistakes do occur, tragically.
761531954818789377 2016-08-05 11:59:01 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @JonahNRO All legitimate business deals are done in cash-by-plane. Wire transfers take too long!
761525582458867712 2016-08-05 11:33:41 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @brithume @slone Further, if everything was announced, as Obama claims, why send a plane of cash? Ever hear of a wire transfer?
761247211543994369 2016-08-04 17:07:33 UTC <FinanceGuru10> And virtually everyone with a brain saw this coming from miles away! We'll just send another #cashplanehttps://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/761243191496601600

760875353564774400 2016-08-03 16:29:55 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @NolteNC Well said!

759724422257410048 2016-07-31 12:16:31 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @haaretzcom That's ok. Many Americans finish 12 years of school without knowing how to read or write.
759452597476466688 2016-07-30 18:16:23 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @nycjim @JeffreyGoldberg So, my "feelings were hurt", so I'll vote for a criminal.

759391989666242561 2016-07-30 14:15:33 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @JohnKerry There already was a 2 state solution. Jordan doesn't want to hold their end of the bargain.
759202248052400129 2016-07-29 01:41:35 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TarekFatah On this one Tarek, I just don't see it. She's sitting being peaceful. If anything whoever is shooting the video is a schmuck.
759053213135843329 2016-07-29 15:49:23 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @FreeBeacon To stupid to see that if he made those criticisms in an Islamic country, he would be killed.
758789442702155777 2016-07-28 22:21:15 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN She's a Jstreet shill who is left of even Obama on her Israel stance. Not fit for armed services cmte.
758789126518820865 2016-07-28 22:20:00 UTC <FinanceGuru10> Chris Haynes calls Tammy Duckworth a senator while his guests declare "America is not a white majority". Jeez - does @MSNBC fact check?
758788498681888769 2016-07-28 22:17:30 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @RepDuckworth is a Jstreet shill.

758774168917643264 2016-07-28 21:20:33 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Quite ironic this quite intelligent and successful young man then goes on to cite institutional racism in the US.
758773301938262016 2016-07-28 21:17:07 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN My neighbors are legal immigrants to the US. One a double masters from Nigeria. His wife from Japan. Trump won't deport them.
758762798721609728 2016-07-28 20:35:23 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Nothing to fear if she only had yoga emails on there anyway.
758762535906488320 2016-07-28 20:34:20 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN An he stated @realDonaldTrump should receive fake Intel reports. Seems to be a trend with the DNC here....just lie to them!
758757270708629504 2016-07-28 20:13:25 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Lara_APN @AviMayer So prior to 1967 Arabs were peaceful to Jews? Something is BS indeed, just aimed in the wrong direction.
758742454396817410 2016-07-28 19:14:32 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Hysterical listening to @cnn guests discussing fake Intel briefings to @realDonaldTrump. He's dangerous! Not Hillary, we can trust her!
758708090179051521 2016-07-28 16:57:59 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TheModerateMan @CaliforniaXile @Mr_Ralph_ The fences around the White House certainly seem to prove your point correct!
758632513313005568 2016-07-28 11:57:40 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @IdoDaniel @Nehemia_G @AnnCoulter Quite true.
758620032465154048 2016-07-28 11:08:04 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @TheModerateMan @rudayday Are Americans the enemy of the president? Why are their fences around the WH?

758614514099036160 2016-07-28 10:46:09 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @haaretzcom I'm surprised you would give any coverage to "Hymie town" Jackson.

758290985570803713 2016-07-27 13:20:33 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @shlomikliab @shim_rational The same reason many have hated Jews. Judaism = Justice. Not a friend of totalitarianism/tyranny.
758055419340136448 2016-07-26 21:44:30 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Liz_Wheeler You obviously don't understand the danger of air conditioning Liz. Why, just yesterday my refrigerator tried to behead my son!
758054980255223808 2016-07-26 21:42:45 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @shim_rational That, shim, is the right question!

758025680206659588 2016-07-26 19:46:20 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @NolteNC You can give her my number! Am Yisrael Chai!
757996475401900032 2016-07-26 17:50:17 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @prageru Shocking because the French have great pride in their culture. I would've thought they'd be the 1st to take a stand.
757966778630754304 2016-07-26 15:52:17 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNN Perfect. Weak democrat beaten by rigged system nominates cheater who screwed him. Sounds like Obama foreign policy!
757954543976054784 2016-07-26 15:03:40 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @GatestoneInst Yes, that will alter their ideology!

757940029180239872 2016-07-26 14:05:59 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @KristinPolitico Not too soon at all. Cleveland was a terrific host and the city really showed well. You're welcome back anytime!
757934486789107713 2016-07-26 13:43:58 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @realDonaldTrump @slone Donald it's time to be a bit more magnanimous in your commentary. You already won the nomination.
757641938946428929 2016-07-25 18:21:29 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @shashj @SohrabAhmari Finally, someone realized you can claim they altered the documents! Just, no one believe you now!
757629477903937537 2016-07-25 17:31:58 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @RepHankJohnson Jews are like termites? How incredibly divisive, antisemitic and unprofessional of you. Shame on you!
757608825901940736 2016-07-25 16:09:54 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @mnolangray @SohrabAhmari @Commentary I agree with the assessment, but it's not planet trump, it's planet Radical Islam. Extremism breeds.
757602949522681856 2016-07-25 15:46:33 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @RidT @JeffreyGoldberg @motherboard @VICE But her private email server with Classified documents is entirely safe!
757575766703902720 2016-07-25 13:58:32 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @zerohedge As a Clevelander, I found most to be very friendly. Virtually no problems at all and I think they all enjoyed #CLE

757538575835463681 2016-07-25 11:30:45 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @ThePlumLineGS @JeffreyGoldberg @nytimes LOL - at least they admit the emails are genuine. DNC is corrupt, but Russia is influencing voters!
757330374879883264 2016-07-24 21:43:26 UTC <FinanceGuru10> Hysterical listening to @GovTomWolf praising the dems as the "party of fairness" on msnbc. Does he have Twitter?
757313661367095297 2016-07-24 20:37:01 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @realDonaldTrump Fear not. DWS will get a cushy position on the Clinton campaign!
757307168550899713 2016-07-24 20:11:13 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @MSNBC @slone Wait, so DNC isn't going to insinuate that Russia edited the emails and the. Leaked them? Missed a layup.
757306485479047168 2016-07-24 20:08:30 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @JeffreyGoldberg By the way, he was right about Obama too! Your eyes are slowly opening.
757306078350544896 2016-07-24 20:06:53 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @JeffreyGoldberg @nakashimae Cmon Jeffrey! Where's your cry of antisemitism after DNC went after @BernieSanders faith? #doublestandard

757249700860825600 2016-07-24 16:22:52 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Jerusalem_Post Funny, Putin didn't disrespect @SenSanders, DWS and the DNC did! #blameshifting
757246605774819328 2016-07-24 16:10:34 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @joshrogin @JeffreyGoldberg @CNNSotu Right, deflect from the dnc corruption and blame it on the opposition. Pathetic.

756562697752195072 2016-07-22 18:52:58 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CNNgo @CNN But Obama said the trump doom and gloom doesn't match reality? May as well leave the flags at half mast. Daily occurrence.

756257963287932928 2016-07-21 22:42:03 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Dena They are not armed to the teeth and no, not too much. Have you been paying attention?
756249256370069504 2016-07-21 22:07:27 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @keenanshaw52 @SeahawkBurrrton How do you prove it? Is there a genetic marker?
756230743370698754 2016-07-21 20:53:53 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @ajplus If there were less and something went wrong the u would say "Cleveland wasn't prepared". Better to have and not need than vice-versa
756229812461547520 2016-07-21 20:50:12 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @ajplus This is simply not true. I work here and have been here every day. No military style weapons, police are very friendly to all.
756199086873772032 2016-07-21 18:48:06 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @fortworthpd Thanks for being here!
756198885249388545 2016-07-21 18:47:18 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @oreillyfactor Ironic the communists exercise free speech to burn the flag. They should move to No. Korea and try the same. Fools.
756198495112028161 2016-07-21 18:45:45 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @oreillyfactor @csfraw You judge all cops by the actions of a few? Should they judge all [pick your group], by the actions of a few?

755424074675826688 2016-07-19 15:28:29 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @camanpour Take a visit to the near east side (body armor recommended). It's not the police killing an African American DAILY over there.
755423457085501440 2016-07-19 15:26:01 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @activist360 Reminds one of the Clintons! They're all con artists. Accept that, and you'll truly be free!
755422492961890305 2016-07-19 15:22:12 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @CornelWest @TheBradMielke He should be protesting on the near east side. 12 people shot this weekend! None by a white cop!
755123289773764609 2016-07-18 19:33:16 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @MashableNews Actually they approved Red, White and Blue elevators. Typical half truths, but I agree, bad optics on the single sign.

719179233428287492 2016-04-10 15:04:25 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @Ostrov_A @UKLabour I thought it was the "occupation" and not the Jews. This woman is clearly an outlier.
712385755579092992 2016-03-22 21:09:34 UTC <FinanceGuru10> @AnneBayefsky @FordFoundation The best way would be to fight radical Islam. Muslims must end radicalization.
