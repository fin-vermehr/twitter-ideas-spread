969645704430829568 2018-03-02 18:48:45 UTC <TypeKing> @EdwardHBOh I deleted my previous comment it sounded too direct and negative.  If War too happens the loss will be great for both Nations.  Korea and U.S.  Probably it will create WW.III from Geopolitical differences between Korean Peninsula and the Middle East. That was my point.
969644542344404992 2018-03-02 18:44:08 UTC <TypeKing> @BuckTurgidson79 Past 70 years North Korea ( Kim Jung Un) regime probably made missile capabilities no doubt.  The reality for past 70 years nation has become poor and isolated. Do you see the full picture?  If Nation is poor and has Nuclear capabilities what is the use???
969618802001375233 2018-03-02 17:01:51 UTC <TypeKing> @BuckTurgidson79 @NoonInKorea President Trump needs to figure out.  Is Korean War plan for his re-election or Pro-Isreal Lobby??? for Koreans.   President Trump is really doing for the sake of Korean Unification he should just economic sanction China and Russia. Why War????
969617617999679488 2018-03-02 16:57:09 UTC <TypeKing> @BuckTurgidson79 China, Russia, will not sit and watch ( Buffer Zone) taking out by Americans.  War isn't the solution even though ( Isreal Pro Lobby) is pushing it. President Trump must understand this isn't Hollywood War Movie.   Korean Peninsula and the Middle East two different Geopolitics.
969616505187983360 2018-03-02 16:52:44 UTC <TypeKing> @EdwardHBOh The U.S. War experts were wrong in the Middle East.   On Korean Peninsula War scenario there will be greater chance magnitude will backfire on President Trump. Not going to be next Korean War or even Vietnam War.  It will become WW.III.  Not sure China and Russia sit and watch!!!
969609223033139200 2018-03-02 16:23:47 UTC <TypeKing> @JChengWSJ Jonathan Cheng,  watch Youtube documentary Israel at war with North Korea.  The source of all this current North Korea situation is directly or indirectly tied to Israel, Jewish American Lobby ( Israel),  Israel vs Iran. Israel cannot attack Russia directly they need a scapegoat!
969608184686981120 2018-03-02 16:19:40 UTC <TypeKing> @EdwardHBOh Economic Sanction will work on Kim Jung Un regime.  War should be very last option.  Only Koreans will suffer meanwhile President Trump sips coke at an office desk.   Plus War on North Korea means WW.III.
969601090671935488 2018-03-02 15:51:28 UTC <TypeKing> @Forbes I agree. All men should be careful.  What kind of gift you give to a woman these days.  Do not give gifts to a woman my best advice.  Instead, give them cash.  Let them figure out what kind of gift they want to have.  Save and Smart.

969595579260026880 2018-03-02 15:29:34 UTC <TypeKing> @sil_chin_nini Korean Woman needs to figure out.

You cannot just generalize all crime because of most cases among Korean woman.  It becomes " Murderous rape"

951356293251440640 2018-01-10 07:33:10 UTC <TypeKing> @willripleyCNN Final Conclusion:  Truth is 70 years self isolation is finally catching up to Kim Jung Un regime.  25 Million people in North Korea cannot escape the reality.  Nuclear Missile or not.  Kim Jung Un is doomed.  It all started 2 years ago.  He will pay very big price being stupid!!!

951113058704764928 2018-01-10 15:26:38 UTC <TypeKing> @BuckTurgidson79 Cause and Effect:  Past 2 years Kim Jung Un shoot missiles, threatens U.S. allies.  Japan buys U.S. weapons $130 Million missile defense.  UN sanctions Kim Jung Un regimes.  South Korea has THADD.  Kim Jung Un is really really isolating and killing himself.  Problem is the path!!
951112381781835781 2018-01-10 15:23:57 UTC <TypeKing> @KoreaEconInst Problem always has been South Korea lacking strong leadership to make North Korea to have better path.  North Korea not trusting South Korea regime and leadership and just taking what ever they want from South Korean Government has been major problems for past 70 years.  Problem!
