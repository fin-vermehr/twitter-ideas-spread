953294037443899393 2018-01-16 15:53:04 UTC <zhirt3> @Colin_AB @dylanlarocca Edge rusher should be a top priority. The pass rush was non existent all season. Kevin Dodd has been a huge bust.

952953579421294593 2018-01-15 17:20:13 UTC <zhirt3> @SteveLayman @Colin_AB Is it better to build an entirely new system around Mariota who is 1 year away from needing a new contract; or ride it out, draft a potential replacement that fits this system better (Matt Cassel is a horrible back up) and see how next year goes?
952944228082049024 2018-01-15 16:43:03 UTC <zhirt3> @FieldYates @WUZ1045 @dylanlarocca They have to get somebody who can build an offense around Mariota. JBC could be that guy.

952396862014795776 2018-01-13 04:28:01 UTC <zhirt3> @Colin_AB The same can be said for Mariota. He was not Mularkey's decision.
952396705223364608 2018-01-13 04:27:23 UTC <zhirt3> @Colin_AB Last year #1 rated offensive line with a former heisman winner waiting in the ranks at rb. Add any quarterback who can successfully run play action pass to this offense and it is completely different. If they want to keep Mariota then changes need to be made.
952395210683830272 2018-01-13 04:21:27 UTC <zhirt3> @Colin_AB Mariota 100% can be great. He needs someone suited to his capabilities. If the team believes in nasty old school football a pro style quarterback is the answer. Both have and can be successful in this league.
952392998012243968 2018-01-13 04:12:39 UTC <zhirt3> @Colin_AB I agree on the robiskie side of things. If Mariota is the guy he has to go. I still think a big part of it is Mariota's ability or lack thereof right now to make intermediate throws.
952390616431947778 2018-01-13 04:03:12 UTC <zhirt3> @Colin_AB Sounds like you are talking about Ken Whisenhunt. The team has improved every year with Mularkey at the helm. Let's keep it in perspective, the patriots are 5x super bowl champs. The Titans were a 3 win team 3 years ago and before his arrival.
952388444919091200 2018-01-13 03:54:34 UTC <zhirt3> @Colin_AB Lebeau is 1-2 pass rushers short of a great defense.
952388282565955584 2018-01-13 03:53:55 UTC <zhirt3> @Colin_AB McDaniel's is overrated in my opinion. His stint as head coach wasn't great. I honestly think a change at coordinator has to happen. If not the Mariota has to go to bring in a pro style quarterback. There is no reason we shouldn't be able to run play action with our running game.
952386541019688960 2018-01-13 03:47:00 UTC <zhirt3> The make up calls after the game is out of reach are ridiculous.
952386071035334656 2018-01-13 03:45:08 UTC <zhirt3> Also, Mariota is getting exposed. All it takes is a spy to stop him. He has to learn to throw receivers open during the off-season.

952368205544247296 2018-01-13 02:34:09 UTC <zhirt3> Imo, officiating is the biggest reason for the drop in viewership this season. Pace of play is horrible and calls are horrendous.
