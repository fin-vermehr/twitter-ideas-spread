964109314247004161 2018-02-15 12:09:07 UTC <dbroussa> @TheCloudSherpa If you like humor, try The Adventures of Tom Stranger Interdimensional Insurance Salesman by Larry Correia. I also lie his Monster Hunter International series.
964109028422021121 2018-02-15 12:07:59 UTC <dbroussa> @TheCloudSherpa Id also recommend the first book in my Wifes series (free if you have Amazon Prime) The Strings of Fate.

Stirlings Emberverse series starts with Dies the Fire, well technically it starts with Island in the Sea of Time so you should read both.
964108448467124224 2018-02-15 12:05:41 UTC <dbroussa> @TheCloudSherpa Have you read David Webers Honorverse series. First book is On Basilisk Station. I would also suggest the Empire of Man series by Weber and Ringo March Upcountry is the first one

959891358348558336 2018-02-03 20:48:28 UTC <dbroussa> @parasvdodhia Flow has over 165 connectors and you can roll your own. These allow triggers to start Flows or to have Flow take actions against your systems. #SPSUtah
959890345650630656 2018-02-03 20:44:26 UTC <dbroussa> @parasvdodhia Flow has integrations with Flow so managing the responses is easier and taking action based on a response like a form for time off kicking off approval Flow #SPSUtah
959890073075396608 2018-02-03 20:43:21 UTC <dbroussa> @parasvdodhia Forms can collect data anonymously, which is useful, as well as tied to responder. #SPSUtah
959889863225913345 2018-02-03 20:42:31 UTC <dbroussa> @parasvdodhia Forms is limited to 5,000 responses, so there is that to consider. So, not for massive queries or quizzes, but useful for even relatively large orgs #SPSUtah
959889552033832960 2018-02-03 20:41:17 UTC <dbroussa> @parasvdodhia first reason you should consider using Forms and Flow...you already own them. Free stuff!!!  Nuff said. But wait...theres more. #SPSUtah

959860966107172864 2018-02-03 18:47:42 UTC <dbroussa> @sharoneweaver says that we do need a Documented process (which doesnt have to be a document) but should be broken down by area like Roles, another for Patching, another for Vendors. Document it somewhere, but doesnt have to all be in one place #SPSUtah
959859930676183040 2018-02-03 18:43:35 UTC <dbroussa> Need to define the type of governance we need. Program, Business, and Technical are all part of the solution. Missing one will undermine governance. #SPSUtah @sharoneweaver

959454799900102661 2018-02-02 15:53:44 UTC <dbroussa> @WSJ @ByronYork @freeriderprob Thats a definite possibility. TV viewership is down across every show. People are consuming entertainment differently. Id be more concerned with that trend because its long term.

954852476599132160 2018-01-20 23:05:45 UTC <dbroussa> Can a Center of Excellence be created if it isnt your primary day job? Really hard to do this, will take longer and expectations need to be managed. @sarahhaase #SPSSTL
954851758408392704 2018-01-20 23:02:54 UTC <dbroussa> SPUG attendance varies by culture. In one case it was all in person at another all virtual but still good interest @sarahhaase #SPSSTL
954850998236925952 2018-01-20 22:59:52 UTC <dbroussa> For another company used Innovation Games Workshops, technique to use game techniques to get ideas like Speedboat Game find anchors and accelerators weighted by group @sarahhaase #SPSSTL
954850175733858305 2018-01-20 22:56:36 UTC <dbroussa> Hack-a-thon setup 4 teams over 2 days with 1 goal (e.g.) project site template. Day 1 team, headed by SPNinja, developed template. Day 2 present at SPUG @sarahhaase #SPSSTL
954849580050538496 2018-01-20 22:54:14 UTC <dbroussa> By requiring community involvement, it also drove content for the internal SPUG. @sarahhaase #SPSSTL
954849378270838784 2018-01-20 22:53:26 UTC <dbroussa> To move up the SPNinja ladder you start at the bottom (Emerald) then move to Saphire, Ruby, and finally Shadow Eye. Mastery numbers set levels but wasnt only criteria. Community involvement was key @sarahhaase #SPSSTL
954848880826421249 2018-01-20 22:51:28 UTC <dbroussa> One doesnt apply to be an SPNinja, its a selection process by the Center of Excellence. Candidates needed to master a specialization (web parts, permissions, lists, etc). Nothing deep just standard features. Can they teach it to others? Provide URLs @sarahhaase #SPSSTL
954847841977098240 2018-01-20 22:47:20 UTC <dbroussa> What is a SPNinja?  Build effective SP Sites, Evangelize Collaboration, willing to teach others, support Enterprise vision, remain embedded in business @sarahhaase #SPSSTL
954847148079755266 2018-01-20 22:44:34 UTC <dbroussa> Another adoption technique, Lightning Rounds give people 15 mins to share a solution they developed. @sarahhaase #SPSSTL
954846705941434368 2018-01-20 22:42:49 UTC <dbroussa> ROI case studies are invaluable to driving success. Save them and reuse the techniques. Example, ID a process that requires manual work that is automated and measure the value of the automation @sarahhaase #SPSSTL
954843984228175876 2018-01-20 22:32:00 UTC <dbroussa> Example of process. First roll out SP, create Governance, 1:1 coaching (Formation); then Internal SPUG, Lightning Rounds (Adoption); SP Ninjas, Hack-a-thons (Maturation) @sarahhaase #SPSSTL
954843158495547394 2018-01-20 22:28:43 UTC <dbroussa> The user adoption continuum. Formation -> Adoption -> Maturation @sarahhaase #SPSSTL Formation sets the stage, Adoption drives usage, Maturation build functionality on what was built before.

954842054651203585 2018-01-20 22:24:20 UTC <dbroussa> Strategy is important to set vision and expectations for adoption of your solution. Usually a multi-year process and often have to rehabilitate image of SharePoint @sarahhaase #SPSSTL
954841268366036992 2018-01-20 22:21:13 UTC <dbroussa> What about the users. Are they suffering from solution fatigue? Do they feel ignored? You have to know your users to succeed. @sarahhaase #SPSSTL

954754991042056192 2018-01-20 16:38:23 UTC <dbroussa> Why do Intranets fail?  One big reason is that they dont support work on the go. #SPSSTL @matthewbowers58
954752907748020224 2018-01-20 16:30:06 UTC <dbroussa> Lack of engagement costs $400-500B per year in lost productivity. 32% lower revenue #SPSSTL @matthewbowers58
954752630156419072 2018-01-20 16:29:00 UTC <dbroussa> Unengaged employees are the hardest to spot because they are not actively doing bad things and arent actively doing positive things #SPSSTL @matthewbowers58
954752221278810112 2018-01-20 16:27:22 UTC <dbroussa> Disengaged employees are easy to spot because they often are resistant. #SPSSTL @matthewbowers58
954752065888276480 2018-01-20 16:26:45 UTC <dbroussa> Engages employees are the ones that are actually creating new business value through collaboration and their work #SPSSTL @matthewbowers58
954751657195294720 2018-01-20 16:25:08 UTC <dbroussa> An engaged employee is involved in, enthusiastic about, and committed to the workplace. #SPSSTL @matthewbowers58
954751403351728130 2018-01-20 16:24:07 UTC <dbroussa> Employee Engagement is really about where the Employee is at. @matthewbowers58 #SPSSTL

954746056851513345 2018-01-20 16:02:52 UTC <dbroussa> Adoption depends on culture, do one thing at a time, tool fatigue is a real thing, must have change champions, eat your own dog food (use Teams to support champs), dont slay Slack first #SPSSTL @EricaToelle
954745615250059265 2018-01-20 16:01:07 UTC <dbroussa> Teams seems to be an application that Microsoft is trying to get IW people to live their entire day at work. Really cool. #SPSSTL @EricaToelle

954725852578746368 2018-01-20 14:42:35 UTC <dbroussa> @krassenstein You may say you support the 2nd Amendment, but you dont understand firearms it seems. You want to ban the 9mm pistol?  Military weapon. What about the 12 gauge shotgun?  Military weapon. The AR-15 isnt a military weapon, that would be the M-4 which civilians cannot purchase.
