970899658871590912 2018-03-05 05:51:31 UTC <htxbourbon> @DineshDSouza That none of the nominated movies were very popular this year? Seems straightforward to me. If Black Panther is nominated for anything next year, ratings will skyrocket.
970799191634206721 2018-03-05 23:12:18 UTC <htxbourbon> @Acosta @Cernovich @RealSaavedra Even conservative media should want equal and fair access for all press organizations. It could be them next time who is not called on.
970312870234918912 2018-03-04 14:59:50 UTC <htxbourbon> @RealAlexJones @Cernovich @BrowningMachine If Alex Jones wants to be some prominent conservative voice, then he should do that. If he wants to knowlingly spread false and potentially dangerous information, then he should expect some consequences.
970311927212793863 2018-03-04 14:56:05 UTC <htxbourbon> @AnnCoulter I would gladly let Chuck Todd run the nation over Trump. In a heartbeat.
970311375896698880 2018-03-04 14:53:54 UTC <htxbourbon> @RealAlexJones @Cernovich @BrowningMachine They are not adults, yet. And mocking and harassing are two different things.   Im sure his sheep will follow if YouTube kicks him off, but I bet they let him stay since he brings in advertising money.
970307804706869253 2018-03-04 14:39:42 UTC <htxbourbon> @RealAlexJones @Cernovich @BrowningMachine They couldve shut him down years ago if they truly favored one side. They know theyd have a lawsuit on their hands if they didnt have merit. I think its a fairly easy decision to censor targeted harassment towards teenagers who recently survived a school shooting.
970305217941114886 2018-03-04 14:29:26 UTC <htxbourbon> @RealAlexJones @Cernovich @BrowningMachine So then he should start his own video platform. Then he can say whatever crazy little thing pops into his tiny brain without worrying about following YouTubes rules.
970189184051924992 2018-03-03 06:48:21 UTC <htxbourbon> @Cernovich @BrowningMachine Is this a rhetorical question? @RealAlexJones is fucking crazy.pic.twitter.com/JBMiWGZTHK

969961295041716225 2018-03-03 15:42:48 UTC <htxbourbon> @DineshDSouza @TrumpsBlonde Pretty sure a cake is not going to kill a classroom full of children.
969959540404948993 2018-03-03 15:35:50 UTC <htxbourbon> @RyanAFournier @MMOLiberty Sex is biological, gender is psychological.
969954460570185728 2018-03-03 15:15:38 UTC <htxbourbon> @RyanAFournier Really not that difficult to comprehend. Gender is psychological.
969940392719380480 2018-03-03 14:19:44 UTC <htxbourbon> @DineshDSouza Really not that difficult to comprehend.
969824783645978624 2018-03-02 06:40:21 UTC <htxbourbon> @RyanAFournier Yes.
969824651722592256 2018-03-02 06:39:50 UTC <htxbourbon> @DineshDSouza @RyanAFournier Owning an object that can kill dozens of people in rapid succession is NOT equivalent to wanting to be treated equally as those of a different skin color.
969822382725660672 2018-03-02 06:30:49 UTC <htxbourbon> @NRA @BillOReilly I doubt the NRA is really hurt by missing a few corporate discounts. But, the tide seems to be turning. Slowly.
969821846819475456 2018-03-02 06:28:41 UTC <htxbourbon> @TuckerCarlson Is this country worth living in if our nations children keep getting shot at school?
