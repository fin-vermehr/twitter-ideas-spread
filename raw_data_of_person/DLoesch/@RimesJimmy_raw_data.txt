971047318945452033 2018-03-06 15:38:16 UTC <RimesJimmy> @DennisDMZ @Jaydawg1973 I think we might even be surprised more when the Democrats pull out their guns they hate so much and start shooting holes in the bottom of the boat , and I believe that they would do that just because they are a nuisance
971046546396602368 2018-03-06 15:35:12 UTC <RimesJimmy> @DLoesch Each day I hope comments have gotten a little less dumb and more educated but each day I'm Amazed by the level of stupidity but I guess I should start to expect more of the same stupidity from the same group because it has become repetitive bless their hearts

969003609789730816 2018-02-28 00:17:18 UTC <RimesJimmy> With the world's population growing so rapidly and new construction almost everywhere you look will we eventually throw off the planets balance kinda like a tires balance will it ever mess up the rotation of the planet

968992777223770118 2018-02-28 23:34:15 UTC <RimesJimmy> @ShinobiNinja I believe Albert Einstein said it best once our humanity is overcome by our technology it will be a downfall in humanity itself , you guys just gained another fan and that new fan is me
968992042100539392 2018-02-28 23:31:20 UTC <RimesJimmy> @ShinobiNinja also the homelessness it seems as a society people are so caught up with their own problems and misfortunes that it seems more acceptable to turn a blind eye to them when really and truly as a human being we should do more because in today's time any of us could become homeless
968991117344739329 2018-02-28 23:27:40 UTC <RimesJimmy> @ShinobiNinja I really like this video , I remember growing up and my mom working day in and day out to raise two boys on a single income when my dad left and it made me sit here and think how did she do it all of those years definitely brought back memories what a wonderful feeling
968961376499765248 2018-02-28 21:29:29 UTC <RimesJimmy> @ThatKevinSmith Any movie ideas from it , could be really funny you guys in the hospital somehow raising money for some kind of crazy procedure

968870876706992129 2018-02-28 15:29:52 UTC <RimesJimmy> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump This is a great deterrent since we are dealing with cowards less likely to prey upon knowing it's not a totally defenseless situation like cameras at red lights fewer people running them now knowing they can get a ticket by mail a good deterrent can change the situation
968865833580728320 2018-02-28 15:09:50 UTC <RimesJimmy> I know my analogy is Extreme indifference but hopefully people can see the point cowards is what we are dealing with so the least bit of resistance that they can see they will be less likely to act upon
968865057491902464 2018-02-28 15:06:45 UTC <RimesJimmy> President Trump is Right arming teachers will be a deterrent it's kind of like cameras at red lights fewer people are running them knowing that they may get a ticket in the mail it hasn't stopped completely but it's been a good deterrent these analogies or extreme in differences
