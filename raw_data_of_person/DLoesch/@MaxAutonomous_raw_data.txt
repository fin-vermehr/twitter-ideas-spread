971324552730107905 2018-03-07 09:59:54 UTC <MaxAutonomous> @HPluckrose @notCursedE @citation_needed I think this is an easy question to answer, but sadly I think many people are now so insane, that they would try to explain why they should be able to commit human sacrifices as part of their religion (just as they try to justify shouting others down as "free speech") .
971322706837766144 2018-03-07 09:52:34 UTC <MaxAutonomous> @HPluckrose @notCursedE @citation_needed It is obviously contradictory to claim the sanction of a right, in order to violate another's rights.  So can we commit murders as part of religious rituals, because we claim human sacrifices are part of our religion, and so protected under "freedom of religion"? If not, why not?

957881658581041152 2018-01-28 07:42:38 UTC <MaxAutonomous> @politelydirect OK, but is it your view that destructive behavior (like serial killing) is self-interested?  Your statement 'the self-interest is the root of our troubles' gave me that impression (though I wasn't thinking of anything as extreme as a serial killer (more like B. Madoff, C. Ponzi))
957879309275836416 2018-01-28 07:33:18 UTC <MaxAutonomous> @politelydirect So you deleted your original replywhat didn't you like about it?
957876892832444416 2018-01-28 07:23:42 UTC <MaxAutonomous> @politelydirect So your definition of self-interest entails the idea that we benefit by exploiting others (hence, 'broken')?  Isn't collaboration actually more self-interested, since we can benefit so much more by working together, as advanced, freer nations demonstrate?

952332916469592066 2018-01-13 00:13:55 UTC <MaxAutonomous> @RubinReport @ralnick Yes, but they are being hypocritical.  Do you check with others before contributing to a charity you are convinced does great work?  I'm more likely to contribute to an effort that I think worthwhile precisely because I think others do not.

952313235872428032 2018-01-13 22:55:43 UTC <MaxAutonomous> @RubinReport @ralnick 4) So I don't believe the criticism is akin to "you are taking advantage of a forced welfare program you denounce" (like SS, deservedly, for it's coercion), it's that "you could do exactly what you are advocatingso why must you be forced (and why must you force others) ?"
