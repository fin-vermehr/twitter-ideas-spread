Its not used by any military anywhere in the world. However if a war breaks out and it is used. ..then its a weapon of war in the same respect a butter knife is if its used to kill someone in that same war.

But that is the very definition of racism. @SenSchumer needs to step down now. @seanhannity @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews America has had enough of liberals claiming racism where is doesnt exist.

967936690756243461 2018-02-25 01:37:45 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @united @guypbenson @katewillette A gun that is actually used in less than 1% of all gun crimes and 99.9999% of the time used in a lawful manner.

964234673034539009 2018-02-15 20:27:15 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @HughJasol2 Ahh an atheist. That explains the stupidity. Try to reason out your arguments. They dont make sense.
964234234796879872 2018-02-15 20:25:30 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @HughJasol2 It makes no sense. If your car gets stolen and used in a crime are you responsible? No. However with guns you can be held liable. So your idea is already partially established. And I have no problem with my guns. They are all in a safe. Locked and only I know the combination.
964233599670157313 2018-02-15 20:22:59 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @HughJasol2 Why do we ignore mental illness?  We dont ignore alcoholism.  We help those folks. Why not these folks?  Instead we disarm the innocent. Thats like preventing a non drinker like me from buying alcohol. What goood does that do to prevent drunk drivers?
964232826039275520 2018-02-15 20:19:54 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @HughJasol2 And that would solve exactly nothing. This kid had a registered weapon. The FBI failed. The teachers failed. They all said he would do it some day. They were right. And nobody did a thing  about it. This kid was mentally disturbed. Thats what we need to focus on.
964230806708408320 2018-02-15 20:11:53 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @HughJasol2 Factually incorrect. And would you do that with a car. Stolen or not you go to jail!!  Doesnt make much sense does it?
964225214748987392 2018-02-15 19:49:40 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @HughJasol2 Typical liberal. Hate to break it to you.  Its the truth. Gun laws dont work. Criminals will ALWAYS be able to get guns. All the math shootings or by liberals. So why dont we outlaw liberals? #GunReformNow
964180711333924866 2018-02-15 16:52:49 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @YourAnonNews @JesseGiesbrecht So should we rent them?  Is this really your argument?
964180276875350019 2018-02-15 16:51:06 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @HughJasol2 No it didnt. Gun crimes rose 69% the first year. It lowered back to a normal rate since. But no significant amount. Honduras outlawed guns and has the highest gun crimes in the world.
964172706525728768 2018-02-15 16:21:01 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @anthonystoppel @funder Thats the same argument used for Chicago to enact their laws. Didnt work.pic.twitter.com/orgGHbBfNa

964166751834595328 2018-02-15 15:57:21 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> We could enact the same gun laws that Chicago has. Because you know.....its working there. Oh wait..... #GunReformNow

964128789453332484 2018-02-15 13:26:30 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @chelseahandler Lets confiscate all alcohol. Make it illegal. After all if we banned alcohol there would be no DUIs or alcohol related deaths. Right? Its not the drivers fault. Its the alcohol. Let that sink in for a minute.

963967108538355713 2018-02-14 02:44:02 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @chelseahandler Why is it the guns fault?  As we see in other parts of the world, no guns theyll use a truck and knives. Its not guns. Its hate. Like the left hates. Its the resistance type of hate. Mental illness. Not guns. Grow up and learn something. Stop hating.
963965735604248577 2018-02-14 02:38:35 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @chelseahandler Arent schools gun free zones already?  Obviously that little piece of gun control doesnt work. Notice a police department NEVER gets shot up. Wonder why? They have guns to shoot back. Taking guns from the innocent doesnt stop the criminals.
962877996825800704 2018-02-11 02:36:18 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @ChrisCuomo I think @CNN should focus on real news and not fake news.

822233745067536384 2017-01-19 00:06:15 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 The first is a philosophy argument. I suggest studying it if you haven't yet. But these two arguments alone prove a beginning.
822233197564067840 2017-01-19 00:04:05 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 The second law of thermodynamics also proves an infinite universe impossible. All the energy would have been used up long ago. But it's not
822232754813280258 2017-01-19 00:02:19 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Or distance. It's infinite. Never ends. Never closer than you were a billion years ago.
822232505227026433 2017-01-19 00:01:20 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 It's easy. Start at today and go back to the beginning of an eternal universe. You can't. You can't transverse an infinite. Not in days or

821932078052835328 2017-01-18 04:07:32 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Think about that for tonight. I'll check back tomorrow. Bed time. Good night.
821931843649994757 2017-01-18 04:06:36 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 If it were eternal we would never arrive at today.We would have to transverse an infinite number of days 2get to today which is impossible
821931473804685314 2017-01-18 04:05:08 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Read the Bible. Genesis 6. All the people. All their thoughts were evil. The only good was Noah
821931138851753984 2017-01-18 04:03:48 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 No im not. You may be wanting to break them up but they flow together
821930871129337861 2017-01-18 04:02:45 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Your Acceptance is not required for it to be true.

821930558724968450 2017-01-18 04:01:30 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Eternal universe is a philosophical impossibility. Try again.
821930338570108929 2017-01-18 04:00:38 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 No. I'm pointing out the truth of life and the Bible.
821930194621624320 2017-01-18 04:00:03 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 You say this but have yet shown how. And still not shown why to save them here when they could be in heaven.
821929800013086723 2017-01-18 03:58:29 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 For God.
821929729594945536 2017-01-18 03:58:12 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 To be able to create the BB and intelligent to be able to fine tune it for life and the laws of physics. All this is very powerful evidence
821929409863155712 2017-01-18 03:56:56 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Space time and matter can not be space time or matter. Which means it must be spaceless timeless and immaterial. It must also be powerful
821929143923343360 2017-01-18 03:55:53 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Space time and matter were created in the BB. Which means it didn't exist before. So if space time&matter didn't exist then whatever created
821928408162701314 2017-01-18 03:52:57 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 No because God never said your life would be easy and fair. Just the opposite
821928156454068224 2017-01-18 03:51:57 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 But He does. Ujust deny that. He rides the world of people who were sacrificing their own children by burning them alive in a heated statue
821927712684212224 2017-01-18 03:50:12 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 No, I'm saying why the baby?  Why kill the baby and why avoid my questions on the abortion for convenience
821927305681502208 2017-01-18 03:48:35 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 So He should just leave them to suffer and die a long drawn out painful death. That's very nice of you. Very moral.
821927042073722880 2017-01-18 03:47:32 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Would allow the termination/ murder of a two year old?
821926858530979841 2017-01-18 03:46:48 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 No because it's man murdering. Which is a sin.
821926558852120576 2017-01-18 03:45:36 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Like how?
821926463360368641 2017-01-18 03:45:14 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Ok fine. Big Bang. Go!

821925817324290050 2017-01-18 03:42:40 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @ForIamPJ @EBatterson @jandrew62956555 @jackiebarbosa But not the date?  Impossible huh?
821925631260819456 2017-01-18 03:41:55 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Why is not ok for God to take a baby to heaven but it's ok for you to murder a baby?  How is God immoral and you moral?
821925285398478849 2017-01-18 03:40:33 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Who says the mothers life is the greater good?  Y not let nature takes its course? What about abortion for convenience? Which is 90% of them
821924675043332096 2017-01-18 03:38:07 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @ForIamPJ @EBatterson @jandrew62956555 @jackiebarbosa You really should learn more about the dating methods and how the first tests were done.

821923523543310336 2017-01-18 03:33:33 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 No your statements shows you don't understand the circumstances of the "genocide" but condone murdering babies. And claim its moral
821923127789780996 2017-01-18 03:31:58 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @ForIamPJ @EBatterson @jandrew62956555 @jackiebarbosa It wouldn't. But a 4000 year old one is for sure.
821922914568175616 2017-01-18 03:31:08 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 I said God took them to heaven. Would you want God to leave them there to be eaten alive by animals or die of starvation?  Are you sick?
821922471804858368 2017-01-18 03:29:22 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Big Bang. DNA. Design. Irreducible Complexity. Fine tuning of the universe. Laws of physics. Philosophy. Mathematics. Logic and reason ect.
821921898217013248 2017-01-18 03:27:05 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 They were slaughtering infants. God drown them for it.
821921672450154497 2017-01-18 03:26:11 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Like?
821921492543868929 2017-01-18 03:25:29 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Good. Glad to hear it. Most atheists deny it. So now how is murdering s baby ok?

821920993136537602 2017-01-18 03:23:29 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Atheists usually don't know what they claim they to know. Especially about the Bible.

821919620386947072 2017-01-18 03:18:02 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @ForIamPJ @jackiebarbosa @jandrew62956555 @EBatterson Religion was never in charge. People were.
821919447380295680 2017-01-18 03:17:21 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Morals?  We protect life of the helpless from those who would murder them. It's you who has no morals.
821919040021102592 2017-01-18 03:15:44 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 It's true that God exists.
821918845304770560 2017-01-18 03:14:57 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Not irrelevant. It shows what the fetus is. A baby.

821917920188071936 2017-01-18 03:11:17 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @ForIamPJ @EBatterson @jandrew62956555 @jackiebarbosa It's definitely evidence for it. Can't blame him for following the evidence.

821915498250174464 2017-01-18 03:01:39 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 If the entire people were evil then genocide is right. Babies were taken to Heaven. You murder the babies.
821915006426087424 2017-01-18 02:59:42 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 Who said it was indiscriminately?  It was planned out very carefully and God gave them 100 Yrs to repent.
821913446862229505 2017-01-18 02:53:30 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Gottisttot44 That is true.

816795327114133504 2017-01-04 23:55:55 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @jandrew62956555 @EBatterson @cfrost1178 @ForIamPJ I don't believe he said that anywhere. Can you prove that's what he thinks?  Or are you

810812034157789185 2016-12-19 11:40:27 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt Moot point.
810811938775203840 2016-12-19 11:40:05 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt Sorry but you got busted lying. Period. And you don't know what whining is either. Look at your own tweets to learn what it is.
807428028183826434 2016-12-09 03:33:37 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt Translation: I'm sorry I got busted lying. I didn't mean to get caught.I'm sorry I didn't lie better. Next time I promise I won't get caught

807362326831788032 2016-12-09 23:12:33 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @1ReadyDefense He got into a discussion with a twitter guy @cfrost1178 Where he just dismissed everything and claimed that's not evidence.
807362072027787264 2016-12-09 23:11:32 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @1ReadyDefense We are discussing your "debate" as he called it on your radio show. I listened to it and I found him to be rude and interrupting a lot

807360635206074369 2016-12-09 23:05:50 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt You're a liar. That's not honest. Pm to keep you honest.
807360438073696256 2016-12-09 23:05:03 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt You would allow him to explain. You just bombarded him with tweets all claiming "Nope". When he explains it's your turn to prove him wrong
807360049345609729 2016-12-09 23:03:30 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt Says you. But you didn't refute it. You just denied it. You must prove why it's not met the burden of proof. Ur denial isn't going to cut it
807357875173683200 2016-12-09 22:54:52 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt Too funny.  Artificial life"INTELLIGENCE" required. . No more until you pm me.

807357060954411008 2016-12-09 22:51:37 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt When you FORCEFULLY pushed your statement you could tell you heard him. Now you're making excuses atheist
807356686784753664 2016-12-09 22:50:08 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @1ReadyDefense @GonnaGoForIt How exactly is that hiding behind your pathetic response?
807355927296929792 2016-12-09 22:47:07 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt So you're not willing to be held to being honest. Noted!
807355692097146880 2016-12-09 22:46:11 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt Liar. That's what you did.  "Nope it's a claim" when you present any evidence you're making a claim genius.
807355311698874369 2016-12-09 22:44:40 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt in your "debate". And yes even in your tweets. If don't then you believe in God. Great.
807355010946371586 2016-12-09 22:43:29 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt Then it should be easy for you
807354866138021888 2016-12-09 22:42:54 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt Not coward. It's to keep you honest and fair. Not bombarded with numerous tweets

807354410057797641 2016-12-09 22:41:05 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt @1ReadyDefense Yes you do. When he interrupted you you wouldn't let him. You kept forcing yourself. If it was ok then why?
807354123729440769 2016-12-09 22:39:57 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @1ReadyDefense @GonnaGoForIt You didn't know what he was going to say 1/2the time.It turned out to be something different than you thought

807353378221228034 2016-12-09 22:36:59 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt You dismissed evidence. Not an assumption. Get it yet mr logic?
807353176290717696 2016-12-09 22:36:11 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt BUP?
807352855627755520 2016-12-09 22:34:55 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt If you claim there is no God. You've made a claim. You're not getting out of this without presenting your evidence.
807352621627559938 2016-12-09 22:33:59 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt and no we don't. But more on that later.
807352540094459905 2016-12-09 22:33:40 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt and then the next question. Then the roles reverse.
807352396250759168 2016-12-09 22:33:05 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt Debate over private message one response at a time. I ask the questions first you respond. I'll be given achance at a rebuttal
807352004339204097 2016-12-09 22:31:32 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt no he didn't. You wouldn't let him and you didn't ask for clarification. Just "nuh uh". YOU must be new at debate.
807351645000626177 2016-12-09 22:30:06 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt @1ReadyDefense He is going to say if you don't listen?  You can't listen if your mouth is running.
807351492231434241 2016-12-09 22:29:30 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt @1ReadyDefense It's always dishonest to prevent someone from make their statement. That's interrupting. How do you know what
807351130820898816 2016-12-09 22:28:04 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt @1ReadyDefense No you're not. Your debate proves that and your convo with @cfrost1178 proves that. You just deny it.
807350606868480001 2016-12-09 22:25:59 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt I'll be in and out but pm me and we will do it over pm. I'll set the rules. And we can begin anytime

807350046777896960 2016-12-09 22:23:45 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt YES. I do think so. It's obvious. And the fact you're clueless on philosophy is hilarious. I'm no expert in philosophy but
807349713003483136 2016-12-09 22:22:26 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt Well at least you admitted you didn't answer his questions

807349130418855939 2016-12-09 22:20:07 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt when the universe is presented as evidence it up to you to prove it wrong and show it's not evidence. You failed.
807348813375700992 2016-12-09 22:18:51 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt Nobody could do better if all you say is nope.

807348542717235202 2016-12-09 22:17:47 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @GonnaGoForIt That's all you did was claim "Nope". He offered DNA, Universe ect. You offered 0. Just Denial not even a small rebuttal which

699790338089562112 2016-02-16 02:59:52 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Ferjetrisa now stop your poor little atheist crybaby tactics. https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/what-are-kinds-in-genesis/
699789141412675588 2016-02-16 02:55:07 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @JaTapps @TamiHoshiyama @cfrost1178 @DrJ_WasTaken @Ferjetrisa @dcj_daniel missed that willfully ignorant part didn't you?
699788783160459265 2016-02-16 02:53:42 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Ferjetrisa ask Dr J. He has it. Has been given it dozens of times.
699788464074596352 2016-02-16 02:52:25 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Ferjetrisa is a cat and a horse the same kind of an animal?  Answer that and we can decide if you're smart enough for this topic
699787600853209088 2016-02-16 02:49:00 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @JaTapps @cfrost1178 @Ferjetrisa @TamiHoshiyama @dcj_daniel If he has done it before how does that make him unable to do it? #Loser
699787016062382080 2016-02-16 02:46:40 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @TamiHoshiyama @dcj_daniel @Dr_GlenV yes I've noticed that
699786816430313472 2016-02-16 02:45:53 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @AtheistSquatch and so are yours. So keep them to yourself.
699786602545958912 2016-02-16 02:45:02 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @AtheistSquatch that's 2 things we can agree on
699786400196009986 2016-02-16 02:44:13 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @AtheistSquatch @apostolicfdn ah yes another stupid remark from complete ignorance of the scriptures.
699447150543970305 2016-02-15 04:16:10 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @grenangle @BooooooYahhh @ArmyOMarkness @JohnERhino @Tasselguy Yea well apples are apples and oranges are oranges. Try to remember that
699446711186378753 2016-02-15 04:14:25 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @AtheistSquatch @cfrost1178 @UnderthePink81 you're just wasting time and avoiding a real debate from him. So obvious
699446579342635009 2016-02-15 04:13:54 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @AtheistSquatch @cfrost1178 @UnderthePink81 No asking for someone to sift through thousands of tweets to prove 2you he has debated atheists
699446259342401537 2016-02-15 04:12:37 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @AtheistSquatch @cfrost1178 @UnderthePink81 oh they do. Don't worry about that. They do.
699445911068348416 2016-02-15 04:11:14 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @AtheistSquatch it's almost like atheists are personally offended at the idea that we were created by God. It's like an insult to them
699445382355357697 2016-02-15 04:09:08 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @grenangle @BooooooYahhh @ArmyOMarkness @JohnERhino @Tasselguy Gravity and Evo are two completely different things. Can't compare the two
699444959456268288 2016-02-15 04:07:28 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @grenangle @BooooooYahhh @ArmyOMarkness @JohnERhino @Tasselguy that's just running from the topic. It's absolutely important to Evo.
699444547697283072 2016-02-15 04:05:49 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @grenangle @cfrost1178 @AtheistSquatch @UnderthePink81 be careful of Darwin. He will make a monkey out of you. Whoops too late
699444094255308800 2016-02-15 04:04:01 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @cfrost1178 @AtheistSquatch @UnderthePink81 You really don't expect him to do that do you?
699443943432302592 2016-02-15 04:03:25 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @cfrost1178 @AtheistSquatch @UnderthePink81 told you he wouldn't answer that.
699443811554955264 2016-02-15 04:02:54 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @AtheistSquatch @cfrost1178 @UnderthePink81 Typical atheist way to skate around and avoid the real issue
699443609246892033 2016-02-15 04:02:06 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @cfrost1178 @AtheistSquatch @UnderthePink81 I'll bet he doesn't answer that
699442740711415809 2016-02-15 03:58:39 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Ferjetrisa really?  No one ever? A word that has been around longer than science has been around. #moron
697943695333560321 2016-02-11 00:41:58 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn Would you put a murderer in prison or even punish them at all?  If yes then shut up. You agree with God
697943205875068928 2016-02-11 00:40:02 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn that statement proves you have not studied the bible like you claimed. Liar
697942851636727808 2016-02-11 00:38:37 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn I was court-martialed in the military over a sunburn. I was government property. I was owned.
697942126575792128 2016-02-11 00:35:44 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn Eph5:19. How are they to sing and remain silent at the same time?  It's b/c you're wrong on what U want it to be.
697941701508231168 2016-02-11 00:34:03 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn let me guess. They are all brainwashed and you are the only right one who can see the truth?  #atheistLogic
697941415452475392 2016-02-11 00:32:55 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn Y is it not 1women in the church believes themselves inferior b/c of biblical writings yet U know better? #moron
697938415875002368 2016-02-11 00:21:00 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @TamiHoshiyama @DrJ_WasTaken @cfrost1178 @dcj_daniel many many many times
697938328931291137 2016-02-11 00:20:39 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn nope. The husband has a different role than the wife. No matter how much you want it you will never be the wife
697938070130323457 2016-02-11 00:19:37 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn No that's not true genius. Men are not allowed to disrupt the service either
697937880094670848 2016-02-11 00:18:52 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn oh now it's sexist. What happened to inferior?  You are so confused on the bible aren't you?
697937534131662848 2016-02-11 00:17:29 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @DrJ_WasTaken @TamiHoshiyama @cfrost1178 @dcj_daniel because she didn't. Simple
697937421992726529 2016-02-11 00:17:03 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn  simple for most but not --> @kennywyland
697937052654931968 2016-02-11 00:15:35 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn it's more than slavery moron. Keep reading
697936929954762753 2016-02-11 00:15:05 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland only if you want to see a doctor.
697936688916467712 2016-02-11 00:14:08 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn Really?  So you would rather they die then. Now you're a hypocrite.
697936483336851456 2016-02-11 00:13:19 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn once again moron who are the salves?  Y Rthey slaves?  Would U rather they die?  You admit no capital punishment
697936079064662016 2016-02-11 00:11:42 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn of a criminal?  If so what kind of punishment do you believe in for murderers?
697935862676369408 2016-02-11 00:10:51 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn who are the slaves?  You already admitted you don't believe in capital punishment. Do you believe in punishment
697935611882135553 2016-02-11 00:09:51 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn different roles.
697935542302838784 2016-02-11 00:09:34 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn not at all what it says. It's a different role. Not superior or inferior. Like a manager and workers. Only
697935126072659968 2016-02-11 00:07:55 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn Why do you lie?  He never said any such thing. Atheists lying again
697934817204113410 2016-02-11 00:06:42 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn No only that verse says it. There are others not allowing men to be disruptive also
697934498030231552 2016-02-11 00:05:25 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn starting to see how all this works yet?  There are other versus that pertain to everyone
697934316374863872 2016-02-11 00:04:42 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn Eph: 5:19. Is a general command allowing everyone to sing. Actually it's commanding them to sing. Are you
697933968264441856 2016-02-11 00:03:19 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland How long do you think it will take him to figure that out?
697895224446615552 2016-02-11 21:29:22 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @TamiHoshiyama @DrJ_WasTaken @cfrost1178 @dcj_daniel of course
697895034436235264 2016-02-11 21:28:37 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @DrJ_WasTaken @TamiHoshiyama @cfrost1178 @dcj_daniel no she didn't. That's you.
697894300714045441 2016-02-11 21:25:42 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland and hospitals
697894116181454849 2016-02-11 21:24:58 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland Nope. He wants it to be what he wants it to be.
697639637536239618 2016-02-10 04:33:45 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn if you understood slavery in Exodus 21 you would realize how stupid your statement is. Keep reading
697639167543480320 2016-02-10 04:31:53 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn atheists certainly didn't hahaha. You are truly a top notch idiot.
697638815989526528 2016-02-10 04:30:29 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn I don't think--> @kennywyland likes being asked for proof of his claims. What a shame idiots like that are out there.
697638272118292481 2016-02-10 04:28:20 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn that's the roles we have. Like a manager and laborer. As a person the same. In the role different. Get it?
697637852373344257 2016-02-10 04:26:40 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn I've asked for proof of this and you still haven't provided it. Just some proof. A little. Something. Anything
697637535770480640 2016-02-10 04:25:24 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn no you haven't. Not one says what you claim. I've begged for 1 st Cor 11 to show me but nothing so far.
697637253992984576 2016-02-10 04:24:17 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn Yes. Now where is it that says she is inferior?
697637062510399488 2016-02-10 04:23:31 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn don't tease me please. Provide this proof of the enlightenment outside of Christianity
697636835468546049 2016-02-10 04:22:37 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn them in the same catagories won't you?
697636739985223680 2016-02-10 04:22:14 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn Christians were speaking out about that slavery for centuries. But I guess the few didn't and you will put all
697636281958817792 2016-02-10 04:20:25 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn think about your answer before you answer.  This is already showing your ignorance
697636102526492672 2016-02-10 04:19:42 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn Why is capital punishment not ok with you?
697635932674007040 2016-02-10 04:19:02 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn Who are they? Those that are owned?  Who?
697635763240902662 2016-02-10 04:18:22 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn not at all. It perfectly relevant if you understood Exodus21
697635491840036865 2016-02-10 04:17:17 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn because you just showed your complete lack of biblical knowledge
697635358733791232 2016-02-10 04:16:45 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn which is why I know you haven't actually studied the bible like you claim. Now you just need to shut up and read>
697635136938987522 2016-02-10 04:15:52 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn wrong. That's your problem. That's not it at all. You can't Even come up with what a slave was outside of Exodus
697634808445345793 2016-02-10 04:14:34 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn those not participating in services aren't allowed to either. Keep reading
697634633991651329 2016-02-10 04:13:52 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn you just read only the parts you want. The problem isn't the bible. It's what you want the bible to mean.
697634414713384960 2016-02-10 04:13:00 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn it's not only women. All things are to be done decently and in order also. So men can't be talking back and forth
697634163315183617 2016-02-10 04:12:00 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn again I refer you back the musical.
697634040963141632 2016-02-10 04:11:31 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn already been explained to you. Not my fault you want to ignore it.
697633823308165121 2016-02-10 04:10:39 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn none of them say it. Not one you provided says it. Not one
697633705041403904 2016-02-10 04:10:11 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn I've asked for one that says they are inferior. You have none that meats that criteria. None. 1 Cor 11 doesn't
697633405651947521 2016-02-10 04:08:59 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn No one in the bible has them inferior. Only you because that's what you want it to mean. Not b/c of what's there
697633046283956225 2016-02-10 04:07:34 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn I want the time. The years. Please
697632937144004608 2016-02-10 04:07:08 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn Oh yes. The enlightenment you have no record of. Just your warped mind
697632770978242560 2016-02-10 04:06:28 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn no. There is no inferiority as to women. Only different roles or positions we have
697632494024175617 2016-02-10 04:05:22 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn were back to you taking things out of context and adding your wants and desires to get it to mean inferior
697632265740812288 2016-02-10 04:04:28 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn Timothy also is of no help. We already showed you that one. Doesn't say inferior anywhere. Or means it.
697631699648139264 2016-02-10 04:02:13 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn please explain 1 st Cor 11 to me and how it shows a women to be inferior
697631510866755584 2016-02-10 04:01:28 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn Hahaha. Oh how sad are you. Once again you have pull things out of context don't you
697631283929714690 2016-02-10 04:00:34 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn No you haven't. If you had you wouldn't be spewing what your spewing. You can't even provide a verse that says it
697630987946106880 2016-02-10 03:59:23 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn please show those versus. You keep claiming are there.
697630713596633088 2016-02-10 03:58:18 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn Show the verse that says they are inferior!!!  Not your worthless opinions
697630546722095105 2016-02-10 03:57:38 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn That's not what it says. Why do you lie?
697630345991053313 2016-02-10 03:56:50 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn They were against the slavery you're crying about. Not the slavery you seem to want to ignore
697630081498238982 2016-02-10 03:55:47 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn are you seriously on drugs?  Seriously?
697629911477985280 2016-02-10 03:55:06 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn No it's true. I actually have some his letters (copies) that show his racist comments.
697629659274432512 2016-02-10 03:54:06 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn this Enlightenment you keep talking about anywhere in history.
697629517544710144 2016-02-10 03:53:32 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn yes I got that. But you're wrong. History says you're wrong. The bible shows you're wrong. And you haven't shown
697629090388398080 2016-02-10 03:51:51 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn who are the people in Exodus 21?  Do you believe in Capital punishment mr enlightenment?
697628871298920448 2016-02-10 03:50:58 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn actually read and study you would know this already.
697628759373905920 2016-02-10 03:50:32 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn because Exodus 21 and the rest of the "slavery" your crying about are completely different. But if you would
697628492314206208 2016-02-10 03:49:28 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn I want the original words and I said we would get to exodus 21.
697628289217605632 2016-02-10 03:48:40 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn so you understand what Original means?
697628150226776064 2016-02-10 03:48:06 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn what inequality?  Because a women can't talk during the services?  Like an audience can talk during a musical
697627767693639680 2016-02-10 03:46:35 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn you literally have to want to mean what your claiming for it to be oppression
697627546922291201 2016-02-10 03:45:43 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn if the musical was too hard for you then you are just willfully ignorant
697625503390248961 2016-02-10 03:37:35 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @TamiHoshiyama @themoaruknow @tgnoble @MYirrell Well they do keep hoping that bacteria evolves into a worm.
697620388243599360 2016-02-10 03:17:16 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland @MuffyHicks Good night and God bless you. I'm outta here too.
697620206462447617 2016-02-10 03:16:33 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland @MuffyHicks I have yet to meet one on Twitter yet
697620036781940737 2016-02-10 03:15:52 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland @MuffyHicks or 30 years. Or I read the bible that's why I'm an atheist. LOL.
697619679469109249 2016-02-10 03:14:27 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland @MuffyHicks Since about 4 central time. He must be using Google
697619242896617472 2016-02-10 03:12:43 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland yep. Follow God and this never would of happened
697619083886395392 2016-02-10 03:12:05 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland LOL. Right
697618877073633280 2016-02-10 03:11:16 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland @MuffyHicks I love it when they say atheists know the bible better than Christians.
697618609057562625 2016-02-10 03:10:12 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland @MuffyHicks he is just a typical atheist that has read atheist websites that have atheist lies on it.
697618315175268353 2016-02-10 03:09:02 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland @MuffyHicks I'm still waiting for it.
697618083909742593 2016-02-10 03:08:06 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @apostolicfdn @MuffyHicks so you admit there is no verse?
697617888572633088 2016-02-10 03:07:20 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland He won't give me the ages though. Wonder why?
697617575715319808 2016-02-10 03:06:05 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland I forgot about that. That's true.
697617320072519680 2016-02-10 03:05:04 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland @MuffyHicks typical atheist. It would be a lot quieter if the women stopped talking at the door. Lol.That's funny
697616815715844096 2016-02-10 03:03:04 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland @MuffyHicks now don't go making sense. He won't like that.
697616609507016704 2016-02-10 03:02:15 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland @MuffyHicks I told him not to stop. He doesn't seem to listen very well
697616399942840321 2016-02-10 03:01:25 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland @MuffyHicks Our churches have less than 1% divorce rate
697615973386317824 2016-02-10 02:59:43 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland @MuffyHicks oh no. Almost like equals
697615848651919360 2016-02-10 02:59:14 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @apostolicfdn @kennywyland @MuffyHicks oh he won't read that one. It's supporting moral values
697615617294098433 2016-02-10 02:58:18 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @TamiHoshiyama @cfrost1178 @mathvsoldage @dcj_daniel @DrJ_WasTaken that's funny
697615322489073664 2016-02-10 02:57:08 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @MuffyHicks people in the musical can speak but everyone else can't. Same thing
697615127596544000 2016-02-10 02:56:22 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland You really are on drugs aren't you.
697614879859945472 2016-02-10 02:55:23 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland you have clearly never read the bible then
697614716382806016 2016-02-10 02:54:44 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland are on drugs?  What "Enlightenment"?
697614553090121729 2016-02-10 02:54:05 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland but that's not true at all. It was Christians who drove the support of equal rights around the world. And still is today
697614257047732224 2016-02-10 02:52:54 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland so you have two individuals. Show Christianity supports it
697614036502913025 2016-02-10 02:52:02 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland wrong. Not original words. I said we would get to Exodus. Your jumping ahead shows your willful ignorance
697613760265990144 2016-02-10 02:50:56 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @MuffyHicks that's partially correct. Man was made first and God saw man needed help. So He made women.
697613412117811203 2016-02-10 02:49:33 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @MuffyHicks very good. But where is the oppressed
697577197679177728 2016-02-10 00:25:38 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @MuffyHicks no wonder you're so screwed up. It's what you want. Not what is actually there.
697577006813155328 2016-02-10 00:24:53 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @MuffyHicks it has nothing to do with inferiority. Only roles.
697576761517690880 2016-02-10 00:23:54 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @MuffyHicks not true. That's an ignorant statement. You have to take things out of context to get that.
697576540779839488 2016-02-10 00:23:02 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @MuffyHicks not so. If a person is not allowed to speak during a musical is it wrong?
697576368196857856 2016-02-10 00:22:21 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland what enlightenment?
697576226949451776 2016-02-10 00:21:47 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland and why do blame everyone for what a few did?
697576137212317696 2016-02-10 00:21:26 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland when did Christians support slavery throughout what ages?
697575936376442880 2016-02-10 00:20:38 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland not what I asked for. Try again. Well get to that verse soon enough
697570887533404160 2016-02-10 00:00:34 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @MuffyHicks over the man in the church. Again don't stop reading where you want it to end.
697570699255283712 2016-02-10 23:59:49 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @MuffyHicks In the church. Don't stop reading. That's why you're ignorant on scripture
697570414109700096 2016-02-10 23:58:41 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @guardatorre @kennywyland @thebiblestrue this guy sounds like he's on drugs. Seriously
697569767498985473 2016-02-10 23:56:07 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @theidealtwit it was Christians who headed the movement to abolish the slavery you're thinking of. Not "enlightenment"
697568956769529856 2016-02-10 23:52:54 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @theidealtwit please show me bcv of Christianity's "support" of slavery.
697567827520151552 2016-02-10 23:48:24 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @theidealtwit when were Christians the bad guys?
697567655796957184 2016-02-10 23:47:43 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @theidealtwit I can't find values of enlightenment anywhere in history
697567326095278080 2016-02-10 23:46:25 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @theidealtwit define slavery as used in scripture. Please use original words. Thanks
697565813591535616 2016-02-10 23:40:24 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @DrPrunesqualor @tgnoble @5317006 @DrJ_WasTaken Science can't confirm anything it's not looking for.
697563178524250115 2016-02-10 23:29:56 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @MuffyHicks societies and now women want to be men and men want to be women.
697563064242024450 2016-02-10 23:29:29 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @MuffyHicks just different roles. People like you want women to be able to join a men's club and vice versa. It's ruined our
697562808393682944 2016-02-10 23:28:28 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @MuffyHicks roles in life. Just like a husband, wife, son , daughter have different roles.Like a CEO and Laborer.None oppressed
697562420990988288 2016-02-10 23:26:55 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @kennywyland @MuffyHicks No your not. You've shown your ignorance already. Women are praised throughout scripture. But we all have different
697560176086265856 2016-02-10 23:18:00 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @EthanSerechen @ban_postgate They seem to think medicine would never happen if they didn't believe in evolution.Oh how they limit themselves
697487149218689025 2016-02-10 18:27:49 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Dr_GlenV @Rati0nalAtheist @cfrost1178 @TamiHoshiyama @dcj_daniel that's not true. When I listen to them it's obvious they haven't.
697486155571269632 2016-02-10 18:23:52 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Dr_GlenV @TamiHoshiyama @dcj_daniel I don't think so. Atheist make up crap all the time. You've done it over and over.
697485919532617728 2016-02-10 18:22:56 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @Taoist_Skeptic @Rati0nalAtheist @cfrost1178 @Dr_GlenV @TamiHoshiyama not yet I haven't. You've only repeated common atheist garbage so far

689996880693035008 2016-01-20 02:24:10 UTC <fromgoo2ulies> @TamiHoshiyama @EBatterson @apostolicfdn the original word refers to what we call the universe today.
