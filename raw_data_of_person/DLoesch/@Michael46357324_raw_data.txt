967073857575165952 2018-02-23 16:29:09 UTC <Michael46357324> @IngrahamAngle A RINO is worse than a Liberal.  At least you know where a liberal stands.
963115532978348032 2018-02-12 18:20:11 UTC <Michael46357324> @WilliamShatner Mr. Shatner, I am conservative (except for some social issues).  And I love your work.  It has helped shape my 48 years of life in one form or another.  Most definitely when I was a kid. But later in life with your recent work.  I hope you live to be 120 or older!

But instead Trumo chose to go the proper route and follow our Constitution.  That will always win in thr long run.

953113293727547394 2018-01-15 03:54:51 UTC <Michael46357324> @marklevinshow @LevinTV @TheRightDefense He ended it by "swipe of his pen".  It will be uphelp by SCOTUS.

953110913887887361 2018-01-15 03:45:24 UTC <Michael46357324> @marklevinshow @LevinTV @TheRightDefense Now I don't know what you are talking about.  He did terminate the illegal executive order that is DACA.

Whatever it is, it's a lot more brilliant than either of us could dream up.    I just know for sure he's got a plan.  No ones becomes a multi-billionare without havd plans to win.
953107670969475073 2018-01-15 03:32:31 UTC <Michael46357324> @marklevinshow @LevinTV @TheRightDefense Ok well then, nice chatting with you.
953105679987822592 2018-01-15 03:24:36 UTC <Michael46357324> @marklevinshow @LevinTV @TheRightDefense It matters not if he vetos. If Rinos want amnesty, then I'm sure they can get enough dem votes to override; therefore exposing the hipocrisy. It's better if Trump could at least get something out of it. He seems to at least be taking it to public opinion. See how that works?

The other side you have socialism, communism, and enslavement.  Just what do you expect POTUS to represent on the other side?
