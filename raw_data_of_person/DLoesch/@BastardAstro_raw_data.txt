970953973992755200 2018-03-06 09:27:21 UTC <BastardAstro> @NIPpodcast I'm just gonna exploit artifacts in a radioactive exclusion zone while doing odd jobs between rival fractions.. my life :/
970322741340622848 2018-03-04 15:39:03 UTC <BastardAstro> @RadicalMariposa @DavidGX @xzhyrax I heard women didn't exist until feminists invented them in 1900, it's been down hill from there 
969573439932698624 2018-03-02 14:01:36 UTC <BastardAstro> This sounds interesting.https://twitter.com/JennieBharaj/status/957764396381487104

969515509757640705 2018-03-02 10:11:24 UTC <BastardAstro> #Pisces: Emotions running higher than the high watermark; Did the tide just come in? Setting sail or avoiding the storm? Avoid Tide Pods.
969514454609252353 2018-03-02 10:07:13 UTC <BastardAstro> #Aquarius: Spending money doesn't make assumptions of romance but often sets a mood and puts others at ease, even if not your normal style.
969513695482179584 2018-03-02 10:04:12 UTC <BastardAstro> #Capricorn: If you find you're under investigation and have a criminal past, it comes to bite you, especially if your name is John Podesta.
969512918143336449 2018-03-02 10:01:07 UTC <BastardAstro> #Sagittarius: Alert: ever consider that the contentious in the air is really sexual tension? Stop fighting and get a room. Avoid "me too" 
969512090796019712 2018-03-02 09:57:49 UTC <BastardAstro> #Scorpio: Always being at risk for getting carried away means "please be more cautious spending money" or you won't have any. Avoid calls.
969511528771784704 2018-03-02 09:55:35 UTC <BastardAstro> #Libra: Actions behind the scenes lead to actions in front of your face. Not much risk of getting carried away, and this is in your favour.
969510987748519936 2018-03-02 09:53:26 UTC <BastardAstro> #Virgo: The weekend isn't even started and you already need a vacation from it..and then a vacation from that vacation. Pisces blames you.
969510411849564161 2018-03-02 09:51:09 UTC <BastardAstro> #Leo: Being a person of great romantic experience makes it  difficult to notice a "once in a lifetime" chance. Be open to Aquarius advice.
969509943085879296 2018-03-02 09:49:17 UTC <BastardAstro> #Cancer: Many of you will feel overtly restricted, but remember to play by the rules including legal rules and seek advice before rash acts.
969509469888671744 2018-03-02 09:47:24 UTC <BastardAstro> #Gemini: Before you feel attacked enough to go on the offensive, be damned certain you're not the one whose making deal breaking comments.
969509041646047232 2018-03-02 09:45:42 UTC <BastardAstro> #Taurus: Being rational and reasonable are your default settings. So why are so many people in your life unreasonable?   It's you, not them.
969508060803883008 2018-03-02 09:41:48 UTC <BastardAstro> #Aries: For living in the most unpredictable times, isn't it odd, once you get bored the universe seems to be on cue to throw you adventure?

969115913437016064 2018-02-28 07:43:33 UTC <BastardAstro> @TwitterSupport @twitter you need have a "report bot account" as a selection. I advise you to do so even though Twitter is mostly bots.https://twitter.com/opassande/status/969113801328119808

968453728188674050 2018-02-27 11:52:16 UTC <BastardAstro> Dear followers, I'm sorry. I'm blaming Ana. She's been working nights as an Onmyoji.
968452214665678848 2018-02-27 11:46:15 UTC <BastardAstro> Also I must have lost my sense of humour..
968450987752116230 2018-02-27 11:41:23 UTC <BastardAstro> #PISCES : Fantastic, terrifying and confusing, mental and emotional energy all at once. Beware of blaming others for missed opportunities.
968448407340814336 2018-02-27 11:31:07 UTC <BastardAstro> #AQUARIUS : I know it seems remote but you discover a passionate, meaningful moment. Only you know how far a shy eyelash flutter takes you.
968447593981325313 2018-02-27 11:27:53 UTC <BastardAstro> #CAPRICORN : Get back to basics or a bad habit could hold you back. Let self control be a gold brick and not a lead weight around your neck.
968446322641686528 2018-02-27 11:22:50 UTC <BastardAstro> #SAGITTARIUS : Don't hold on to anger and anxiety; there is always a physical outlet besides a punch to the face, so avoid that if you can.
968445656338706438 2018-02-27 11:20:11 UTC <BastardAstro> #SCORPIO : The discovery of positivity of feeling often requires that cold harsh dose of disciplined reality for you to appreciate it fully.
968445014920585216 2018-02-27 11:17:39 UTC <BastardAstro> #LEO : Looking longingly at lovers walking past, you realise as "the cool kid" even nerds have more of a life than you, no, especially you.
968444136364953600 2018-02-27 11:14:09 UTC <BastardAstro> #LIBRA : You are reminded of how life is both with wonderous and brutal at the same time. Seek a zen center-point between heaven and hell.
968443061041795072 2018-02-27 11:09:53 UTC <BastardAstro> #VIRGO : Put down that metaphoric desk! The approaching Full Moon will only upturn your life using your newly acquired telepathic skills.
968441517013684224 2018-02-27 11:03:45 UTC <BastardAstro> #CANCER : Keywords you have been hearing recently are: "limited state" restricted and throddling. Those are still better than "locked down".
968439522320056320 2018-02-27 10:55:49 UTC <BastardAstro> #GEMINI : It feels difficult to control your anger lately. Yet the more in control you are, the more out of control your opponents seem.
968438495936237569 2018-02-27 10:51:44 UTC <BastardAstro> #TAURUS : There's no shortages of tragedies and malevolence in life; if a sweet provides you optimisim, take the canoli and leave the gun.
968436817879093249 2018-02-27 10:45:04 UTC <BastardAstro> #ARIES : Since it's long past St. Valentine's Day, you are long past curious about horoscopes. Were you bored? Get back to work slacker!
