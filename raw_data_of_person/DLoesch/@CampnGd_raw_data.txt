969883868814864384 2018-03-03 10:35:08 UTC <CampnGd> @ChrisLoesch He's either a kid, mentally challenged or that other moron posting fake pics of your wife using a fake account. Either way, not a man.

969746595251195906 2018-03-02 01:29:39 UTC <CampnGd> @ChrisLoesch He won't apologize. He doesn't see how stupid and ignorant his tweet is.
969623321489887233 2018-03-02 17:19:49 UTC <CampnGd> @JimMcCue Be safe. Don't worry about the weather. The scary part is, you're driving to NYC instead of away from

967767056165883905 2018-02-25 14:23:41 UTC <CampnGd> I joined the NRA yesterday. I've been considering it for a while now but with all of the ignorance and misinformation I've seen and heard in the past couple of weeks, I knew it was time.

953798072236199937 2018-01-17 01:15:55 UTC <CampnGd> @jodiwhitecomic We saw you in Syracuse and I had an angle somewhere in between those 2. Awesome show. Awesome view.
953749297325133827 2018-01-17 22:02:06 UTC <CampnGd> @PatriciaHeaton You're much to kind to all these "tolerant" liberals giving you crap. You need  to release your inner Frank.

949350326007627777 2018-01-05 18:42:10 UTC <CampnGd> @CharlieDaniels He lectures us while looking over the top of his glasses. Other than that, nothing.

933192132860395520 2017-11-21 04:35:17 UTC <CampnGd> @BubbaRadio It's the all out hate and disdain for anything and anyone that doesn't fit into their way of "thinking".  The intolerance of the tolerant.

925302248992800768 2017-10-31 10:03:42 UTC <CampnGd> @Merissa_kate He has a point on education & a job. Health care is different from health insurance. Locking someone up and not feeding them is illegal.

902607208457883648 2017-08-29 19:01:42 UTC <CampnGd> @Merissa_kate A rebel flag doesn't make you a racist but judging someone because they have one makes you a dipshit.

816681677154111488 2017-01-04 16:24:19 UTC <CampnGd> of all things I've been called in my life,  dad is my favorite. Even by my kids that aren't technically mine. 
810827384324816896 2016-12-19 12:41:27 UTC <CampnGd> @ChrisBrownOnAir Happy Anniversary
809825499342053376 2016-12-16 18:20:19 UTC <CampnGd> @GitRDoneLarry it's good to you getting into the Christmas spirit.pic.twitter.com/5uJTVKPCag
807136290894446592 2016-12-09 08:14:22 UTC <CampnGd> ever hear of "clap on, clap off"?
807135330210107393 2016-12-09 08:10:33 UTC <CampnGd> @ChrisBrownOnAir I'm one of your 5m downloaders. Congrats to you all. Looking forward to episode 400 
807134836444041216 2016-12-09 08:08:35 UTC <CampnGd> @bretteldredge I have only heard 2 songs from "Glow" but I am buying it. I don't know where but it will be soon. AWESOME.
806061219119591424 2016-12-06 09:02:25 UTC <CampnGd> @BubbaRadio if we were all the same, thought the same, looked the same, life would be boring, redundant and we'd all be unnecessary.
805736471676198912 2016-12-05 11:31:59 UTC <CampnGd> you should watch "Small Town Santa". The acting will make you cry 
805613193469034496 2016-12-04 03:22:07 UTC <CampnGd> @ChrisBrownOnAir thank you Chris. Merry Christmas.
805586565393252352 2016-12-04 01:36:18 UTC <CampnGd> @ChrisBrownOnAir and thank you for responding.
805586472929787905 2016-12-04 01:35:56 UTC <CampnGd> @ChrisBrownOnAir ok. Do I find one through your website? Under ELP? My parents need help.
805556179678232576 2016-12-04 23:35:34 UTC <CampnGd> @ChrisBrownOnAir hi Chris. I know years ago Dave had debt coaches across the country. Is that no longer the case? Is it only in office now?
805015649986740224 2016-12-03 11:47:42 UTC <CampnGd> @DaveRamsey where do I find a debt councilor in my area or is that only done at your offices now?
803989078601506816 2016-11-30 15:48:28 UTC <CampnGd> @Merissa_kate mouse?
799877102560485376 2016-11-18 07:28:56 UTC <CampnGd> @BubbaRadio I once looked for my phone until my buddy pointed out I was talking to him on it  smh
799223813888163840 2016-11-17 12:13:00 UTC <CampnGd> @Merissa_kate 
797274189078130688 2016-11-11 03:05:53 UTC <CampnGd> Can you call yourself an adult if you still can't go to work because Trump was elected? I don't think so. Nope.
797170004001255424 2016-11-11 20:11:54 UTC <CampnGd> After reading some of the ignorance on here, I can understand how some people feel this country is done for. Adults behaving like children.
796096224365514752 2016-11-08 21:05:05 UTC <CampnGd> @mainstmcminn @KILLERBEAZ @RadioPatrick you guys should come to Syracuse, NY. Soon!
790950738306490369 2016-10-25 16:18:45 UTC <CampnGd> @mikeroweworks hi Mike, what happened to "The Way I heard it"?  Is it done or is my phone not working again?
779540362931101696 2016-09-23 04:38:00 UTC <CampnGd> @Merissa_kate that's called "winning!"
771723037993345024 2016-09-02 14:54:44 UTC <CampnGd> @RadioPatrick that's very intolerant of you to not see the political aspect of what you said. lol
771639078932459520 2016-09-02 09:21:07 UTC <CampnGd> @RadioPatrick all you radio people are the same, quoting song lyrics and getting upset when stupid people don't get it. Hahaha
769133490487062528 2016-08-26 11:24:48 UTC <CampnGd> that is in the top 5 worst foreign policy theories ever.
764517937038458881 2016-08-13 17:44:14 UTC <CampnGd> @Merissa_kate I can't believe they let you carry it. They have no idea what you're capable of.
764439677097172997 2016-08-13 12:33:16 UTC <CampnGd> @DaveRamsey 640 miles & a weeks worth of your podcast makes a great night at work. Thanks for the inspiration!
748488654016905216 2016-06-30 12:09:36 UTC <CampnGd> @Merissa_kate I'm glad you came back
743407261582712832 2016-06-16 11:37:57 UTC <CampnGd> @DaveRamsey yes, yes he (I?) am.
742123320162783233 2016-06-12 22:36:02 UTC <CampnGd> @bigdandbubba since you don't sell "BigD&Bubba" thermos', I made my own. Is that improper use of a bumper sticker? Lol
740841343723966464 2016-06-09 09:41:55 UTC <CampnGd> @bigdandbubba as my Finacial advisor says, "you should hire a lawyer so mean, you don't like him/her"
740840182887419905 2016-06-09 09:37:18 UTC <CampnGd> @MarkChesnutt from the 1st time I heard Mark sing, I have believed he is one of the best in country music. 1 of the reasons I still listen.
740043550360887297 2016-06-06 04:51:46 UTC <CampnGd> Happy Birthday 
739863997034450944 2016-06-06 16:58:17 UTC <CampnGd> you can't. It's so close to your birthday.
737781037011488768 2016-05-31 23:01:21 UTC <CampnGd> @jamespconnolly time to move
736556231209418752 2016-05-28 13:54:24 UTC <CampnGd> @Merissa_kate which one?
736290176155193344 2016-05-27 20:17:12 UTC <CampnGd> @HistoftheBatman has it been 2 weeks since the last HOTB podcast? Or is my smart phone being stupid again?
732972270684110849 2016-05-18 16:33:01 UTC <CampnGd> that's scary. Any one of those women could be used to counteract a viagra overdose
730990986235674625 2016-05-12 05:20:06 UTC <CampnGd> @Merissa_kate sorry kiddo

728062423857565696 2016-05-04 03:23:03 UTC <CampnGd> @bigdandbubba you should drive a big truck. All sorts of stupid going on. Saw a guy on his laptop the other day, in his lap at 65mph SMH

727199039205330945 2016-05-02 18:12:16 UTC <CampnGd> @Merissa_kate are you serious?
727197709652860928 2016-05-02 18:06:59 UTC <CampnGd> @DaveRamsey it's hard to believe something so simple can be so far over some people's head.
725654675303833603 2016-04-28 11:55:31 UTC <CampnGd> @bigdandbubba I have a huge list. If I told you, you guys would ban me from listening.
723455171188154368 2016-04-22 10:15:28 UTC <CampnGd> @DaveRamsey could you recommend a book(s) to help improve leadership skills? Tks
722299375079305217 2016-04-18 05:42:45 UTC <CampnGd> @Merissa_kate yeah, it sucks when your kid talks back 
716211576089534464 2016-04-02 10:32:00 UTC <CampnGd> @bigdandbubba and, never apologize for having an opinion. Besides, my witch doctor helped me when no one else could.

705445404167573504 2016-03-03 17:31:05 UTC <CampnGd> @mikeroweworks @DaveRamsey I know you're busy but these are short and interesting/informative and just plain cool.
705444043887669248 2016-03-03 17:25:41 UTC <CampnGd> @mikeroweworks I've been looking podcast to help keep me awake/entertained while working nights. Found one! Great job!
700464999190417409 2016-02-18 23:40:44 UTC <CampnGd> @DaveRamsey I don't know how you do it. The people you deal with on Twitter would drive me out of my mind. You are a dedicated man.
700463771660263425 2016-02-18 23:35:51 UTC <CampnGd> @ekwetzel @striker_wb @DaveRamsey it's a waste of time Erin. Pray for him and move on. Eric is a twit

697563980114612224 2016-02-10 23:33:07 UTC <CampnGd> @DaveRamsey listening to your show on podcast and heard the truck driver that makes $28k a yr. he needs to look harder, there r better jobs!
695338457569239040 2016-02-04 20:09:41 UTC <CampnGd> @HistoftheBatman ok. I thought I somehow blocked them or you guys were kidnapped by the Joker
695337203816267777 2016-02-04 20:04:42 UTC <CampnGd> @HistoftheBatman what happened to the podcast?
695222243413094400 2016-02-04 12:27:54 UTC <CampnGd> @twits @DaveRamsey @_elenaa08  it's funny when people who know nothing about you make ridiculously stupid assumptions about you. @Twits that tweet

694667421894967296 2016-02-02 23:43:14 UTC <CampnGd> @BubbaRadio welcome to Syracuse. But why? I live here and wonder why. haha
693452976237756416 2016-01-30 15:17:27 UTC <CampnGd> @DaveRamsey I wish I had been lucky enough to have you be "rude" to me years ago. I'm on my way now though. Keep it up, Dave!!
692566909796003840 2016-01-27 04:36:33 UTC <CampnGd> Oh well, if I have to be stuck in the hotel waiting for my next run at least Carol Burnett is on Conan tonight. The funniest lady ever.
