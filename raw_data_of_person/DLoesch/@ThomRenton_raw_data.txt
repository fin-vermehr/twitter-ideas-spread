962402217725587456 2018-02-10 19:05:43 UTC <ThomRenton> I like Andrew Garfield as an actor but hes trying too hard to be intelligent here and its making him come off as a complete idiot.http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2018/02/09/spider-man-star-andrew-garfield/

954371162582130690 2018-01-19 15:13:11 UTC <ThomRenton> @SarahPalinUSA I would see two or three movies per week in theaters in the 1990s. In 2017 I saw zero.

953809312702373888 2018-01-17 02:00:35 UTC <ThomRenton> @PatriciaHeaton I respect your decision. People seem to forget that not voting is also an option. Perhaps there should be a none of the above option on ballots.

950059245403193349 2018-01-07 17:39:10 UTC <ThomRenton> @kirstiealley Yes, but hes covered. Its not like hes paying $400 out of pocket for an inhaler.

948764038745346049 2018-01-03 03:52:28 UTC <ThomRenton> @benshapiro I wasnt aware there were still states where people dont pump their own gas. I havent come across a gas station that isnt self-serve since the 1980s.
948255375505072128 2018-01-02 18:11:13 UTC <ThomRenton> @chuckwoolery I rented Moonlight and it was so boring I only watched 30 minutes. I dont know a single person who liked it - including gays!

927721458410823680 2017-11-06 02:16:46 UTC <ThomRenton> @DallasFanzine @Bobtoronto65 The facade of the building is different now than it was during the 80s.
927579378178957312 2017-11-06 16:52:12 UTC <ThomRenton> @benshapiro DST serves no purpose whatsoever.
927579095793262592 2017-11-06 16:51:04 UTC <ThomRenton> @BreitbartNews Keith Obermann is about as relevant as a fleas fart.

926862898030186496 2017-11-04 17:25:09 UTC <ThomRenton> @kirstiealley But not in supermarkets or restaurants.
926277282951335936 2017-11-02 02:38:08 UTC <ThomRenton> @DallasFanzine Is that what the building looks like now?
926274566594240513 2017-11-02 02:27:20 UTC <ThomRenton> @theblaze @chrisenloe @MorganBrittany4 Isnt Hillary disrespecting herself by staying married to Bill?

924860337886601219 2017-10-29 04:47:42 UTC <ThomRenton> @benshapiro Reminds me of when George Michael was outed for being arrested having gay sex in a park restroom.
924845800638705664 2017-10-29 03:49:56 UTC <ThomRenton> @ZeroPointNow This broad is full of beans. No one is buying  that act. PTSD panic attacks have no relevance when one commits a crime.
924840714478919681 2017-10-29 03:29:43 UTC <ThomRenton> @RoseMarie4Real I cant wait to see it Miss Rose Marie. Thank you for sharing.
924459245021544450 2017-10-28 02:13:54 UTC <ThomRenton> @RoseMarie4Real They should induct you and Morey into the Television Academy Hall of Fame.
924264374528745472 2017-10-28 13:19:33 UTC <ThomRenton> @kirstiealley Smart advice. But seriously, what woman meets a man in a hotel room for a business meeting unless shes a hooker?
924127584849244160 2017-10-27 04:16:00 UTC <ThomRenton> @DineshDSouza Must be a quack.
923543918473494529 2017-10-26 13:36:43 UTC <ThomRenton> Then just die already, Rosie. No one - and I do mean NO ONE - will miss you!http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/26/rosie-odonnell-seriously-worried-if-will-be-able-to-live-through-trumps-presidency.html

920926311455100928 2017-10-19 08:15:17 UTC <ThomRenton> @JedediahBila Times Square was better when it was filled with hookers and XXX theaters. You know, before the tourists.
919444248805629952 2017-10-14 06:06:06 UTC <ThomRenton> @chuckwoolery Yet she has stayed married to one for decades.
919443782197592064 2017-10-14 06:04:14 UTC <ThomRenton> @JedediahBila That reminds of those people at work who take a half a donut and leave the other half for someone else. Who can't eat an entire donut?
919058658289319936 2017-10-13 04:33:54 UTC <ThomRenton> @BreitbartNews @chuckwoolery Then don't play. No one will miss you.
916815005365841920 2017-10-07 23:58:25 UTC <ThomRenton> @FoxNews This is sad. I'm becoming less and less interested in what Hollywood has to offer.
916813364759732224 2017-10-07 23:51:54 UTC <ThomRenton> So basically Miley Cyrus is thanking Hillary Clinton for staying married to a serial sexual predator.https://apple.news/AHeTovEu_OfW3j36nrOF2Bw
916774684133171200 2017-10-07 21:18:12 UTC <ThomRenton> What did this idiot expect? Imagine putting up a billboard in San Francisco of Obama with a noose around his neck.http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/10/06/california-billboard-portrays-trump-nazi-complete-45-swastika/amp/

916756428659900416 2017-10-07 20:05:39 UTC <ThomRenton> @cher @TanyaLaNice Yup, the white guys!
916755580890472448 2017-10-07 20:02:17 UTC <ThomRenton> @kirstiealley Well many celebs also supported sexual predator Bill Clinton and his wife so clearly this is not an issue with them.
916754947479289857 2017-10-07 19:59:46 UTC <ThomRenton> @michellemalkin Seriously a WTF moment.

915451544413249537 2017-10-03 05:40:31 UTC <ThomRenton> @BillOReilly I'm surprised Hillary hasn't blamed the Vegas shooter for her presidential loss.
914738055205941248 2017-10-01 06:25:22 UTC <ThomRenton> Since when did Michelle become such a big fan of Hillary's? Michelle did nothing but trash Hillary in 2008.https://apple.news/A4P1e5UfmT7-SccIWt3jsFA

909639938026565632 2017-09-17 04:47:16 UTC <ThomRenton> How is Hillary graceful? It's been almost a year since the election and Hillary is still blaming everyone but herself for her defeat.pic.twitter.com/QTmy8SoyOs

907906173873004544 2017-09-13 09:57:54 UTC <ThomRenton> @benshapiro I don't read Glamour but is that really the advice they give young women today? Geez!!!
907608828463554567 2017-09-12 14:16:21 UTC <ThomRenton> @RealJamesWoods I'm so glad we don't have to listen to Clinton's shrill voice for the next 4 years.
