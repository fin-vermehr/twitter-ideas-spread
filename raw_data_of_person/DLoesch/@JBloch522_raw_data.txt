942802294176931840 2017-12-18 17:02:38 UTC <JBloch522> @ProFootballTalk Nfl needs to start ejecting players when they make illegal hits like this. Carolina loses this game if Adams doesnt get injured.

913585682861428736 2017-09-28 02:06:15 UTC <JBloch522> @RapSheet @DraftKings How many weeks is ty out for ?
909971905507135488 2017-09-18 02:46:23 UTC <JBloch522> @RealSkipBayless Media should only be talking about flowers and how gmen can't block or tackle
908165331339882497 2017-09-13 03:07:42 UTC <JBloch522> @RachelEReilly He should of been out week one.
906282473075740673 2017-09-08 22:25:54 UTC <JBloch522> @AdamSchefter The judge is a cowboys fan like everyone in Texas
906189951762616320 2017-09-08 16:18:15 UTC <JBloch522> @RapSheet Giants are covering up because odb is out at least a month. That was a bad hit and not one when you play football two weeks after.
906010861667364864 2017-09-07 04:26:36 UTC <JBloch522> @adamteicher Kareem hunt is the new David Johnson

881941353617178624 2017-07-03 18:22:59 UTC <JBloch522> @SunriseWarrior Gonna call when i get back but the least delta should do is refund entire round trip since flight was delayed 16 hours.
881304349581946881 2017-07-01 00:11:45 UTC <JBloch522> Delta is officially the worst airline. Stuck on jfk tarmac for three hours and staff has gave us every excuse in the book.
878048120491433984 2017-06-22 00:32:39 UTC <JBloch522> Don't get the Knicks. They always do thishttps://twitter.com/fanduel/status/878046949424877569
878046730541039617 2017-06-22 00:27:08 UTC <JBloch522> So the Knicks finally drafted a pg but he averages 5 ppg. HATE PHIL #nbadraft
869727469439524865 2017-05-30 01:29:22 UTC <JBloch522> Jetblue is good at telling everyone to be patient but not why there cancelling flights.
869726709377060865 2017-05-30 01:26:20 UTC <JBloch522> @JetBlue you're now In a race with united with who's the worse airline. Keep giving us fake updates and not let anyone know what's going on

852866099788095488 2017-04-14 12:48:18 UTC <JBloch522> @FanDuel is on the same level as #united airlines now. Capping baseball entries to 3max shows you care for pros and not loyal rec players.
