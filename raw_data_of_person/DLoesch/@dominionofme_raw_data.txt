971252335073775616 2018-03-06 05:12:56 UTC <dominionofme> @GeorgeTakei @crehage @ijontichy69 This tweet is funny. You have no idea who youre talking too, or what youre talking about cupcake. I pay careful attention to the information I read. Zasshi Kiji Sakuin for example, or wikileaks. Independent journalist like Eva Bartlett are where I get my information.  Grow up.
971104316135231489 2018-03-06 19:24:45 UTC <dominionofme> @GeorgeTakei @crehage @ijontichy69 Also. The greatest country in the world took in George Takei and now hes got millions and millions of dollars. If we didnt seclude him and other into that camp, they would of kept training them to fight us and they would of all died for the sake of alliance with Nazis?
971103660880130048 2018-03-06 19:22:09 UTC <dominionofme> @GeorgeTakei @crehage @ijontichy69 Children like George were being trained to carry on their war with their allies, remember, Nazi's? The camps George endured arent even on the same map as the horror of Nazi or Soviets camps ON THEIR OWN PEOPLE... thats the factor that separates the U.S. from Pedophiles like Takei
971060270251626497 2018-03-06 16:29:44 UTC <dominionofme> @historylvrsclub ummm.. I followed this twitter for history. Please keep the history important. Less and less people give a shit about actors and actresses.
971058864115331072 2018-03-06 16:24:09 UTC <dominionofme> @wokeluisa Someone must have been in a safespace for 8 straight years. To be so naive and ignorant of all the scandals under Obama is straight up scary.
971052881863499777 2018-03-06 16:00:22 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @KyleKashuv @The_Tyler_Grant Stop with the "real" conservatives nonsense. Wikileaks has a 100% track record & if the guy doesnt deny that Seth Rich gave him the info on the DNC and the curious comments in Podesta's emails that sprung the "pizzagate" distraction... Its not a "botched robbery" worth dismissal
971033524819124226 2018-03-06 14:43:27 UTC <dominionofme> @jordanbpeterson Scratch that. Its working all of a sudden.
971033225916272641 2018-03-06 14:42:16 UTC <dominionofme> @jordanbpeterson Link doesnt appear to work.
971026787684798465 2018-03-06 14:16:41 UTC <dominionofme> @washingtonpost Ironically the ones who started the violence are always the radical leftist. Spreading fear about 13 twitter trolls from Russia and unimportant group of modern day deluded Nazi's.
971026249547173888 2018-03-06 14:14:33 UTC <dominionofme> @PostOpinions @washingtonpost @zmondaine592 Look how articulate you are lmfao...
971025966561681408 2018-03-06 14:13:25 UTC <dominionofme> @washingtonpost Lol as if anything WaPo lets out of that echo chamber isnt "opinion"  These Journalist are trolls.
971023642577592321 2018-03-06 14:04:11 UTC <dominionofme> @MarkGaleotti only in 2018 can donald trump be president and some mouth piece journalist is virtue signalling about etiquette and spy "games"... as if any of this is a game.. Find new terminology.
970815073798279173 2018-03-05 00:15:25 UTC <dominionofme> @landanimalwtf @crehage @Someguygrego Thats a loaded question. Live video footage for example? I like a track record of accuracy for example. In this age. If you have yet to put out information thats not been denied at the least, like wikileaks, it is simply moronic to not take the information seriously.
970813172411191297 2018-03-05 00:07:51 UTC <dominionofme> @landanimalwtf @crehage @Someguygrego Youre taking what Ive said and exaggerating it. Cable for the most part in comparison to the internet, a dense place to get information. I didnt say all is corrupt just like I didnt say all youtube channels are 100% undisputed. It was ONE example... one youre clearly angry about?
970762698697961473 2018-03-05 20:47:17 UTC <dominionofme> @SenSchumer @KyleKashuv Schumer is too spineless to even acknowledge you. I applaud the effort though.
970762141149130753 2018-03-05 20:45:04 UTC <dominionofme> @landanimalwtf @Someguygrego @crehage Well they arent corporate scum bags from CNN, WaPo, NYT, Time Mag, NewYorker, Fox News, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, NBC, & yes cable networks like History, or Discovery. I know growing up in the age of information sucks cause of all the scary facts out there but most people understand this
970761309615566848 2018-03-05 20:41:46 UTC <dominionofme> @GeorgeTakei @crehage @ijontichy69 Georgetakei is an actor that is known for being a pedophile. We have never put Americans in concentration camps like the Germans or Soviets. Sorry. You will have to elaborate and I can try to answer your question.
970720894262923274 2018-03-05 18:01:10 UTC <dominionofme> @crehage @ijontichy69 We were neutral until the Japanese, backed by Hitler, attacked Pearl Harbor. At least get your facts straight or maybe learn english a little better. I dont have German forefathers. My ancestors are native american and irish/scottish
970716499127275523 2018-03-05 17:43:43 UTC <dominionofme> @KamalaHarris Maybe in California and other places that are controlled by radical leftist like yourself but everyone else has moved on from the race baiting nonsense. We are more equal as humans than ever before and billions of black people disagree with you.

Protecting and supporting a sexual predator? You need serious mental health. I worry about the safety of people around you. People like you should never own a gun.
970707265794822145 2018-03-05 17:07:01 UTC <dominionofme> @kumailn @paolamendoza Oh please.... One virtue signalling actress worth $215 million fuckin dollars with another sextuple millionaire to pretend to give a shit about anyone.  No one cares what these people have to say in regard to complex immigration issues. They should stick to acting.
970703772694536192 2018-03-05 16:53:08 UTC <dominionofme> @washingtonpost @from_Milky_Way And I can use mine to overthrow any government or shoot any school shooter I see.
970702815013343232 2018-03-05 16:49:20 UTC <dominionofme> @washingtonpost My toilet paper is worth more than your publishing.
970702016275087360 2018-03-05 16:46:10 UTC <dominionofme> @DLoesch Because an echo chamber of dense, spineless, insecure people worship these parasites of influence.
970661156556820480 2018-03-05 14:03:48 UTC <dominionofme> @indianaoldsoul Let me guess.... You wanted Hillary Clinton to be president over Donald Trump?
970536308874661888 2018-03-04 05:47:42 UTC <dominionofme> @EdgarOfTheMoors @DLoesch @CBradleyXXX Hahahaha you angry little trolls are hilarious.

970534751399444480 2018-03-04 05:41:31 UTC <dominionofme> @crehage @ijontichy69 The Japanese decided to send hundreds of planes to attack citizens in Hawaii. They were training their children to fight on through the war.... not too long ago the very last Japanese hiding away on some island surrendered.. Youre from Germany and you are critiquing the U.S. Cute
970398347851976705 2018-03-04 20:39:29 UTC <dominionofme> @DLoesch @Tooda How ironic.
970327905719988224 2018-03-04 15:59:35 UTC <dominionofme> @crehage @ijontichy69 Why overthrow our government? Its not locking people up in gas chambers and sending out trucks of military to deal with citizens. Of the states that have strict gun laws, the worst crime is committed. People do care, how else would some uneducated German like you know about it?
970072560925888512 2018-03-03 23:04:56 UTC <dominionofme> @SamHarrisOrg @LKrauss1 @PWalshMusic @Drew22509207 I wonder if you said anything about buzzfeed and standards when they brought up the pee tape story, or Russian conspiracy theories. Have they said anything about Bernie Sanders and Russians and/or Australians apparently?
970069865175412738 2018-03-03 22:54:13 UTC <dominionofme> @crehage @ijontichy69 Great movie! The U.S. is built on a significant fundamental that the people will always have the power to protect themselves and/or overthrow this government should the means be necessary. You wont silence me, and I couldn't care less if you think that's nonsense.
970023379381178368 2018-03-03 19:49:30 UTC <dominionofme> @crehage The point is people should have a right to defend themselves with a firearm, and yes even something like an Arma Lite rifle... Some jews fled into the woods and died in the woods free with a gun instead of a gas chamber. Some formed militias.
969993087924822016 2018-03-03 17:49:08 UTC <dominionofme> @crehage @Someguygrego This is the age of information. Probably all of those documentaries + MANY MORE are on youtube for example, thats just one place I'd take more seriously. My point with my sarcasm is that cable t.v. is a dense place to become educated and in fact doesnt teach you every perspective
969989915785203712 2018-03-03 17:36:32 UTC <dominionofme> @PhilipRucker @GeoffRBennett @JtillerJr @ArmyGurl1999 Ya! No ones trying to kill anyone... Its Saturday and they are at the golf course anywho! What sound logic you have!

969988236897644544 2018-03-03 17:29:51 UTC <dominionofme> @crehage @Someguygrego Ya, cable T.V. is always the best source for information............pic.twitter.com/hK8xAe6Jhr
969987694255370242 2018-03-03 17:27:42 UTC <dominionofme> @crehage No one is arguing that but it is a matter of fact that "On Nov. 11, 1938, the German minister of the interior issued "Regulations Against Jews Possession of Weapons." Not only were Jews forbidden to own guns and ammunition, they couldnt own "truncheons or stabbing weapons."
969986660594274304 2018-03-03 17:23:36 UTC <dominionofme> @POTUS @PhilipRucker @GeoffRBennett @JtillerJr @RebeccaGingy Feel free to assume whatever you want about what I think of gun shots going off on the white house grounds... I know its not funny, whether the president is there or not... And I thought you crazy ass leftist thought so too.

969983056491802625 2018-03-03 17:09:16 UTC <dominionofme> @PPIndKentucky I think a man, to the best of everyones knowledge. Is a being that can produce a seed within a WOMANS uterus. Because a women is a being that is able to take a planted seed and create another being. Stop polarizing everyone because of less than .01% of people are different.

969961517390147585 2018-03-03 15:43:41 UTC <dominionofme> @Art_Mofo So you made this account because in your adolescence you are obsessed with Trump and his following? Do me a favor and give me a sarcastic line so you avoid the exposure of your lack of a 3 digit IQ.

969630703766917120 2018-03-02 17:49:09 UTC <dominionofme> @AndyKindler Im sure not as many jews would of died if they were passionate enough about defending themselves with a firearm. Some did. They flee'd into the woods, made use of their militia when they could, and died in terrible ways outside the spectrum of a gas chamber.

I dont think anyone is saying NRA before country... the NRA is just founded on protecting everyone's rights. Much of the growth of the NRA comes from fighting the KKK, as an example.
969342376350273541 2018-03-01 22:43:26 UTC <dominionofme> @dbongino @NRATV @kathrynkellyPR @JFDreview The focus, that you completely dodge, is that the mentally insane will kill.

They will do so by any means. You can pretend all you want that no guns = no deaths, but just look at the east. Mass murders by bombings, knives, vehicles... ALONG with relative scenarios happening here.

He could have just as easily ran a car into that crowd and killed even more that 50 people. Are mass stabbings not important to you or something? Whats your solution to knife killings?
969246633471995904 2018-03-01 16:22:59 UTC <dominionofme> @dbongino @NRATV @kathrynkellyPR @JFDreview Excuse me. Will you start banning knives when nothing is done about the mental and social issues that are the underlining linchpin to this whole problem of violence at schools?
969243292272680966 2018-03-01 16:09:43 UTC <dominionofme> @dbongino @NRATV @kathrynkellyPR @JFDreview The logic you fail to address is the fact that socializing in highschool can be hard, and if given enough reason.... a person will kill Gun or no gun. Again. Will you ban knives, cars or any other means of violence because you think the perpetrator "shouldnt of had access to it"?
969242464484777984 2018-03-01 16:06:25 UTC <dominionofme> @dbongino @NRATV @kathrynkellyPR @JFDreview "The only injury was to a student who hurt her ankle running away"  If the teacher was educated on firearms, the point of having it there and why it should ever be used.

If the pattern suggest that a shooter approaches and get shot back at, THAT WILL deter them. Otherwise they'll find a knife, a car, or some other means of attacking innocent lives and when that happens will you start banning knives?
969237082345476097 2018-03-01 15:45:02 UTC <dominionofme> @Education4Libs Its a good thought but, much like the underlining problem of insane people wanting to commit mass murders. The underlining problem of planned parenthood is that people think casual sex is ok, that meaningless sex is harmless. We have to tackle this version of mental illness.
969235733377699842 2018-03-01 15:39:41 UTC <dominionofme> @dbongino @NRATV @kathrynkellyPR @JFDreview And yes if a teacher so chooses to educate themselves of the safety and point of having a firearim in the classroom, locked, or safely put away out of sight and mind. Good for them. Teachers already do this, and youll never hear about a mass shooting at their school.

968961952851603456 2018-02-28 21:31:46 UTC <dominionofme> @jordanbpeterson Because the result would show that some educations are more harmful to an individual than helpful and those same educations line the pockets of the people who dont even care about the students thriving.
968961298229878785 2018-02-28 21:29:10 UTC <dominionofme> @dbongino @NRATV @kathrynkellyPR Your definition of safety and quality of life is disarming people who want to protect their kids from the nuts that would use a gun, a car, a knife... hell an ice pick to kill. If you are for safety and quality of life. You would let people defend themselves.
968958968373698565 2018-02-28 21:19:55 UTC <dominionofme> @ShaunKing Why dont you put up evidence so such a claim? You lie way too much to just be taken seriously at first glance.
968956607332790273 2018-02-28 21:10:32 UTC <dominionofme> @GiannoCaldwell @Fapapotomus Might have something to do with 70% of the country surrounding Israel are incest nut jobs that find apologist like you to stick up for them. While they still arent even close to being as accepting as the Jews in their state.

People who happen to be black are not required to test as high as white people to get into certain schools. Thats a clear cut standard. Would you be for removing the different standard of test scores to schools or college?

We are human beings with different skin colors, eye placement, bone density, ect. ALL OF WHICH HAVE NO SIGNIFICANCE to the social fabric we create. Yes racism exist, at this point only because its overemphasized.
968940673054527488 2018-02-28 20:07:13 UTC <dominionofme> @sapinker @BretWeinstein @cognitivicta @x0x0x00x0x0 People often force themselves in critical thinking that they need to associate themselves with groups, instead of just being apart of a group as an individual. Sounds like an oxymoron bt people find comfort in grouping, being an individual means a certain responsibility.

Go to Black reddit, talk to the Black Panthers, talk to modern Nazis and white supremacist alike. They have this dangerous sense of importance because of their skin tone.. This is wrong. Feed them lies that faceless people are out to get them... and it gets worse.
968935570574659585 2018-02-28 19:46:56 UTC <dominionofme> @sapinker @BretWeinstein @x0x0x00x0x0 @cognitivicta I see it differently. We are the human race, yes one race. Our bones are all the same color, our blood is all the same color. People are people, who happen to be black, or happen to be white. Taking pride in the hue of your skin is the underlining problem of many cultural issues.

968933302714425345 2018-02-28 19:37:55 UTC <dominionofme> @YouTube @JohnHMcWhorter So Colbert is so desperate for attention he invites somebody no ones heard of? Id like to see either of these cult leaders to debate someone with real critical thought like J. Peterson. Woke is made fun of because we've conquered most of racism and it thrives because of leftist.

968928107800522752 2018-02-28 19:17:17 UTC <dominionofme> @ananavarro @crickwooder You mean your dense sense of reality is so heavily bias that you are willing to buddy up to anyone the President slams?
968927895073820674 2018-02-28 19:16:26 UTC <dominionofme> @ananavarro A CNN panelist complaining. What else is new. Grow the F up. Your network is a joke and so are you.

968922161594454016 2018-02-28 18:53:39 UTC <dominionofme> @thaetan Anne Kindergarten stabbing claimed 6 lives. The family friendly Gage Park had 5 stabbings. Dont dismiss that attack in 2014. The guy had steak knifes. An ice pick would of literally been more effective and just because someone didnt die doesnt mean we shouldnt take it seriously
968921847214608385 2018-02-28 18:52:24 UTC <dominionofme> @thaetan What of a heavily gun restricted placed like China with mass stabbings in one case where 33 are dead. I want to control people wanting to kill others but the best control is fire with fire. A bigger knife. Because the people with spines will act, and America is filled with them.
968920029348683776 2018-02-28 18:45:11 UTC <dominionofme> @thaetan No. Im not arguing effectiveness in weapon of choice. Obviously a gun is going to be a more effective choice to commit such a horror. Im arguing that restricting them wont stop the violence, it might even escalate it. Read on----
968917950752272384 2018-02-28 18:36:55 UTC <dominionofme> @thaetan Why not? There are mass stabbings much worse than the 17 dead in Parkland. This is a complex issue of acceptance, decency, and friendliness. Highschool isnt to great at doing those three and the faster we tackle that, the less often we'll see these horrors at all.
968916575158927360 2018-02-28 18:31:27 UTC <dominionofme> @Frank_Schaeffer @pattis6 If they gave as much psychological and financial help as he did then I think we are all for it... but Hitchens was good at debating the ills religion. Dawkins is an educated biologist who is popular for doing the same thing. Show me where they donated millions and ill agree.
968914910062239744 2018-02-28 18:24:50 UTC <dominionofme> @Frank_Schaeffer Is the U.S. Capitol of Rotunda not a place for distinguished citizens? What world do you live on? Even after his death you have these passive aggressive hate filled people over a guy, his religion, and his influence of millions of lives that helped them conquer their problems.
968912922935283714 2018-02-28 18:16:57 UTC <dominionofme> @RubinReport HHAHA.... I wish I could of seen the look on their face.
968911455704834049 2018-02-28 18:11:07 UTC <dominionofme> @AriMelber @Topdekfireblast Ive been robbed at gunpoint. I was educated enough to remain calm, I was educated enough to make sense of the situation and deflate it by being agreeable to the delusion. If I had a gun I would of been able to pay rent, and that guy wouldnt of robbed or struck fear in anyone else

968910261590614016 2018-02-28 18:06:22 UTC <dominionofme> @thaetan The kid lost his mom, lost his dog, kicked out of school, people making fun of him as being a "school shooter".. so much that he embraced their ridicule and decided to lash out. He could of lashed out with a car, a knife, hell an ice pick. The underlining problem isnt guns.
968909568096030721 2018-02-28 18:03:37 UTC <dominionofme> @thaetan Whats counter productive in my view is removing peoples ability to defend themselves inch by inch when a government we live under is already corrupt and oppressive enough. The underlining problem here is teaching people not to bully. The parkland shooter was bullied. 1/2
968907193662795776 2018-02-28 17:54:11 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @DrMosesAB @theminorchords I hate what government has become and I hate that uneducated folks like yourself think government is right and dandy despite the mountain of issues they propagated over the years. You can report a nut like the Parkland shooter 39 times and nothing will happen
968905742702039040 2018-02-28 17:48:25 UTC <dominionofme> @thaetan Im assuming, based on psycho-analytics that most people are willing to empower themselves to protect each other. Which is why the state of Vermont allows their people to conceal and carry without a permit. People are stronger and more willing than you assume.
968900968950779904 2018-02-28 17:29:26 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @DrMosesAB @theminorchords IE: Hate speech
968900638976479232 2018-02-28 17:28:08 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @DrMosesAB @theminorchords At this point most of government is an abomination to what the frameworkers imagined for us. Of course 2018 is more complex than 1771 but regardless, even the basic amendments have been manipulated, neglected or abused. The U.S. just needs to give power back to the states.
968899283184508928 2018-02-28 17:22:45 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @DrMosesAB @theminorchords Im being sarcastic... We should be teaching responsible driving... not trying to control everything with regulations from corporate aristocrats behind the regulating..   Responsibility is the only way we have the freedom to own a car, gun, bottle of whiskey. Stop looking to gov
968898513164800000 2018-02-28 17:19:41 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @theminorchords @DrMosesAB If this cupcake took education seriously he would be learning a lot right now.
968896163222081537 2018-02-28 17:10:21 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @DrMosesAB @theminorchords Educate yourself cupcake. Look up the facts that you like to ignore and see for yourself that Mustangs are one of the most dangerous vehicles in the world. Probably has something to do with adolescent people like yourself looking or a cheap fast car.
968895828038430720 2018-02-28 17:09:01 UTC <dominionofme> @thaetan Stop living in a dense world. People like being heroic. Turns out we as humans feel good about helping others (unless youre Broward County police) There are already school teachers who pack heat... BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY GIVE A SHIT ABOUT PROTECTING THEIR STUDENTS
968894346669019136 2018-02-28 17:03:08 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @DrMosesAB @theminorchords If you consider the death count... Ford Mustangs have a higher death toll than the Pinto. I thought you cared about peoples lives! Why do you not want to regulate the Ford Mustang so children dont die? Why do you want to let Ford Mustangs kill so many people... herpa derpa.
968892989585199104 2018-02-28 16:57:44 UTC <dominionofme> @RubinReport It wont happen. These manipulated kids only "debate" the CNN panelist that agree with them.

968889157773942785 2018-02-28 16:42:30 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @theminorchords You are the one that is dense. There is a reason Vermont can allow citizens to own and carry a firearm without even having a permit. It is in fact easier to get your hand on a knife or a car and kill someone. Educate yourself
968887864510631937 2018-02-28 16:37:22 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @theminorchords While you ignore that banning guns wont stop these maniacs from getting a hold on an object to kill someone, Whether its a gun, a knife, a car, hell an ice pick. Stop pretending that ignoring these types of mental illnesses will suffice to the change we all want.

This is all "WMDs" talk from the early 2000s and until the people start seeing some mother effing factual truths without the bullshit "its classified" response... no one cares about this.

But hopefully people read this, educate themselves of this unpopular fact about Pakistan & Trump and do something no matter how small it is of an act. I disagree about twitter. Its revolutionary people can communicate like this despite the constant discourse.

People can change others cultures IF WE ARE WILLING TO TALK about it. And thats a start

Fathers shouldnt talk that way and especially shouldnt actually act that way. This discussion of incest isnt exclusive to this nation. Incest is a problem that we should all aim to fix, regardless of where we live. Do you not agree?
968544840127598592 2018-02-27 17:54:19 UTC <dominionofme> @thehill @thejassingh @DanWiberg @EPx44 Show me where I said I think thats ok. Tell me how i support anything because of an observation. Are you really this pathetic when trying to make an argument?

I really hope you fix yourself for your own good. Remember! Just because someone brings up a more significant problem doesnt mean your skin tone has anything to do with it.

I dont know why your inner victim-hood assumed that I thought you were anything. I found a topic we both agree is disgusting. I mention a bigger problem of incest and you embarrassed yourself after that.

Put a red dot, extended mag, custom grips or trigger and someone might call it a military grade weapon. Its a perception of the terms I laid out. If you cant keep up, just stop. No wonder you arent serving anymore.

I dont know how you missed this if you were marine. All military grade means is that something is strong, tough, or high quality. You can attach this term to any particular gun. INCLUDING PISTOLS
968532427646914560 2018-02-27 17:04:59 UTC <dominionofme> @thehill @thejassingh @DanWiberg @EPx44 You bringing up race is a passive aggressive example of you projecting your racism on me. We were talking about incest issues and its a fact that over 70% of pakistanis are incest, again, i dont care about their hue. I care about facts. Better luck next time. Hope you get better!

Something you should consider next time you try to be the anecdotal example of a subject you arent alone on being versed on. Why arent you a marine anymore?

968528864862490624 2018-02-27 16:50:50 UTC <dominionofme> @EPx44 Who said anything about race? We were talking about incest relationships. Fucking dingus lmfao... Take your race baiting bullshit and shove it where it doesnt shine asshole.

Im glad to help you think something is funny regardless of how ironically ignorant you actually are. Keep talking about this bullshit, hopefully youll grow a spine and talk about matters of death or nearly entire nations being incest

Yes fathers imply they would date their daughters when a subject of their daughters beauty and sexual ambitions are on the table. Im not saying i like it. Im saying i dont care because there are bigger issues worth talking about. Sorry?

I never mentioned trading anything and you have no earthly idea how my thought process works. You are 1 marine of the many that I love and know.

You are perfectly trained to kill someone with anything just like you are trained on how, when, and why you should ever use a firearm. Ill adjust when it makes sense.

Trusting a President seemed to be the topic and the echo chamber of pretending Obama did no wrong is a partial reason why so many were willing to let a cheeto in office, over Her.

The NRA has membership fees that people gladly pay for, in fact since the shooting, more and more people have signed up because they are interested in protecting their children. They are interested in protecting rights. As we all should be

967432108573642753 2018-02-24 16:12:43 UTC <dominionofme> @BernieSanders Based on the politics today... that doesnt matter. You are guilty. Your supporters "helped the Russian government."  Or.... we could all reasonably ask for the data that suggest anyones vote at all was actually influenced given the fact Hillary just has to be herself to lose.

967420146888343553 2018-02-24 15:25:11 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal @doubtthat11 You should read history more bud. You take on a naive and deluded approach over anecdotal nonsense from racist in the 1700s. I bet you think Thomas Jefferson was a slave hating racist too. Godspeed. Read up on your history.

967419086052511745 2018-02-24 15:20:58 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal @doubtthat11 Ironic. You are the one who has a dense understanding of history. Nearly half of the people who came to the U.S. to lead and build a country did so with the understanding that it would NOT BE A DEMOCRACY... but a republic-Hence the party "republic-ans"... a state of communities.
967418223317614593 2018-02-24 15:17:32 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal @doubtthat11 Wait... Whats the fantasy?
967418057739128832 2018-02-24 15:16:53 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal @doubtthat11 It was about private citizens working with other humans, foreign and domestic to overthrow an abusive gov regime that was based on lies from the start. Much like our invasion of Iraq... only not so many people helped Iraq as they did the Viets.
967417506460786688 2018-02-24 15:14:41 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal @doubtthat11 You think our militias wouldnt seek support from outside entities? Like I said. I agree the odds outweigh and likely lean on the side of whoever controls nukes and the air... But none the less. We would die fighting our gov before we allow it to become harmful to the masses
967416395993698305 2018-02-24 15:10:17 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal @doubtthat11 Wrong. King George III issued a letter to have all leaders of the colonies to bend the knee or hang to death for treason... So they ratified a constitution and over time came up with a set of rights. These rights are an attempted prioritization of how we protect ourselves withgov
967414471781240832 2018-02-24 15:02:38 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal @doubtthat11 Tell that to the Vietnamese. Masses of people would defect from the U.S. military and the millions upon millions who understand the point of the 2A, would over throw them in guerrilla warfare.... or we would happily die trying.
967238992654725121 2018-02-23 03:25:20 UTC <dominionofme> @CarrieStevenson You are a vile, disgusting individual for manipulating and propagandizing millions of minds with that CNN town hall, scripted event. Shame on you. You are complicit to the corruption of these United States and in my view, youre a traitor. You need help.
967236171444162562 2018-02-23 03:14:08 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @samdigspoems The 2A and the right to own a firearm has been here since the formation of the U.S.... How did the NRA (only came about in 1871) specifically "help" Cruz get a weapon? Why do you ignore such general facts. Thats like blaming all Muslims for the violent nature of its believers no?
967235242930171905 2018-02-23 03:10:26 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro Twitter is quite generally a leftist platform run by leftist ideologues. As long as people can see it trending along with "#ResignSheriffIsrael"... this is good momentum

967174080905564165 2018-02-23 23:07:24 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal @doubtthat11 History shows a pattern that all governments have this issue of becoming so corrupt that it begins to destroy its people, America is growing with this problem (Trump as an example) banning guns is something we should be very careful about, no matter how terrible life may seem 2/2
967173573658992641 2018-02-23 23:05:23 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal @doubtthat11 Look. Im not a republican, but I study history and I understand that american political science, nevermind its many flaws in the period regarding slavery and other horrors.. was built on the idea of the people being able to protect themselves from anything, including Gov. 1/2
967172504883167232 2018-02-23 23:01:09 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal @doubtthat11 It depends on the controntation. Im not missing your point, I just refute it and try to communicate my point. He is a free man. He was found "not guilty" Youre right that has specific meaning but the underlining meaning is the court ruled in his favor.
967172143770488832 2018-02-23 22:59:42 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal @doubtthat11 Unarmed Zimmerman gets out of the car without a gun. Continues to get his head bashed in on the pavement and now Zimmerman is dead and Martin gets away with murder. The presence of the gun supplied Z with the ability to walk home. But in reality he pled selfdefense and is alive.
967170097474392064 2018-02-23 22:51:35 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal @doubtthat11 I dont think you understand self defense. Z was found not guilty and is a free man. But so was the kid creating violence when he attacked Zimmerman. The NRA member that shot the church shooter in TX months back created violence by shooting a maniac that was mass killing innocents
967168316983914498 2018-02-23 22:44:30 UTC <dominionofme> @GeorgeTakei John Hinckley failed because of ARMED support for the victim.... As teachers and students would be alive today if they were ARMED and able to protect those who are now dead. A maniac will kill. Which is why banning guns WONT CHANGE THAT.
967167545588449280 2018-02-23 22:41:26 UTC <dominionofme> @irishrygirl You cant even spell the presidents name right... Reagan is alive because ARMED security surround him. Teachers & students have more of a chance to BE ALIVE because they would be considered ARMED and can provide SECURITY to innocent people next time a nut tries to murder people.
967136178435710977 2018-02-23 20:36:48 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal @doubtthat11 Despite what you think happened, he was attacked and when he lost the fight, he pulled a firearm and defended himself after getting his head smashed on the pavement. The CDC has proven to not have all the facts on gun crime and even turns down every request to debate their data.
967121645176590337 2018-02-23 19:39:03 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal @doubtthat11 The CDC has been trying to study guns for quite some time but they dont get the whole picture, just some of it.  Read the slate article "The surprising findings by the CDC." Guns are mainly used to protect us. CDC has also rejected many debate platforms to explain their findings.
967112513828646919 2018-02-23 19:02:46 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal @doubtthat11 Oh I agree. I think automatic weapons should be held by mostly government employees or soldiers and aspects. You are talking about mass shootings from a dense perspective. How many shootings in heavily gun regulated areas of the U.S.? How many shootings in relaxed zones?
967111875598143489 2018-02-23 19:00:13 UTC <dominionofme> @nedprice This is false.  This is a fact done by a leftist minded news outlet. "Trump an averages 2 news conferences per month, compared to Obama's 1.71 monthly average throughout his term."
967110915559772160 2018-02-23 18:56:24 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal @doubtthat11 I want to fix the issue of schools being attacked. Us gun folks arent all republican supporters either, nor am I an obsessed person about guns, but I am passionate about U.S. citizens being able to protect themselves and heavily democrat regulated gun zones are often MORE violent
967107985913806848 2018-02-23 18:44:46 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal The problem with this is AR-15s are of that of a pistol. And given the right circumstance the pistol thats semi-auto can be more dangerous than an AR-15. Maybe we can talk about banning large magazines, but again... a killers going to kill. We have to talk about the mental issue.
967107188660621312 2018-02-23 18:41:36 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal @doubtthat11 @RichHomieBeard Clips are bullets clipped together or yes a device that loads rounds into a magazine.
967106670190002177 2018-02-23 18:39:32 UTC <dominionofme> @jessesingal @doubtthat11 Anything on mental health or once youve done theorizing this do you want to start banning cars and knifes too? Of course we can talk about regulating modifications and even ban many types of firearms but you leftist minded people ignore the mental issue way too much.
967106043821031429 2018-02-23 18:37:03 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @jessesingal It seems like he is trying to find common ground without banning virtually all effective arms that would protect us from a tyrannical government. The people need be dangerous to our government or they will onset a communistic, socialistic, fascistic, catastrophe of a system.
967041313001607168 2018-02-23 14:19:50 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro Great. The guy that makes hugging animations when giving me his view.

966741094120779778 2018-02-22 18:26:52 UTC <dominionofme> @Elky305 @marildeo Thats not what they typically do. They avoid at all cost and sometimes running down a hallway could mean running face to face with the attacker. They lock up in classrooms. If students are aware their teacher can protect them, they'll lock down into a corner as they already do.
966740706323845126 2018-02-22 18:25:20 UTC <dominionofme> @marildeo I'd like to know if you even have the spine to attack a mass shooter before he kills innocents. Youre a coward and wouldnt do anything at all.

All you did was post dismissive content that doesnt have anything to do with mass shootings and the best thing you can come up with is something that happened before world war 1 lol..... Hope you get better at this. Dont let people predict what youll do.
966724380385595394 2018-02-22 17:20:27 UTC <dominionofme> @jdice03 @DiscoGnu So nothing on a teachers mass shooting eh? Thought it was easy?

People who demand answers through prayer is what you are implying and they are probably Muslims when they prey that way.

964901754239414272 2018-02-17 16:37:59 UTC <dominionofme> @ByronYork @aopaderf @Rimer_Chris @USANancy You are spitting out the same nonsense that you read. You cant just say they hacked our election. You have to show us how they effected peoples votes. The burden of proof is on you the accuser. Educate yourself.
964877913458921472 2018-02-17 15:03:15 UTC <dominionofme> @GretelSugar Waaaaaaaa.. Crying little whiner.
964877740162912256 2018-02-17 15:02:34 UTC <dominionofme> @Robin46_2 So California and New York City is going to make all our decisions....?  Please educate yourself as to what the electoral votes do..
964797369081528320 2018-02-17 09:43:12 UTC <dominionofme> @subscribetowapo Heard you won some Fake News awards lol.... Twitter and WaPo are so ignorant to this promoted advertising, straight up bullshit....
964654167309586434 2018-02-16 00:14:10 UTC <dominionofme> @unscriptedmike @DoctorCheryl @David_L_London WHATABOUT ISM YAY!
964653909800378368 2018-02-16 00:13:09 UTC <dominionofme> @ValeriaSirigu Mueller convicted people who pushed Clinton AND Trumps campaigns to cause discourse. Your context fits for the democrats as well.

964590481832366081 2018-02-16 20:01:06 UTC <dominionofme> @Chapstick_Bad Too bad the competition and the game has been shit since Y1S2
964552651957526533 2018-02-16 17:30:47 UTC <dominionofme> @Glock__Lesnar @MMcupps Yes its good what hes doing, I'm not bashing him for doing it.  If we are going to praise this and call it a significant deal. The same attitude should be displayed towards those who devote their lives to this action, but because they are Christians its widely ignored.
964549894445912064 2018-02-16 17:19:49 UTC <dominionofme> @Glock__Lesnar its called charity. Most Christian religious types do this and they dont get twitter publicity or make videos about them doing it because its not about them... its about doing the right thing.  Something Drake is disconnected from and all those ogling at him throw money. Grow up.
964520346522177537 2018-02-16 15:22:25 UTC <dominionofme> @chicagotribune Whats with the obsession about race. Get out was a shit movie and black panther was a decent movie..  The color of the cast has nothing to do with it. Stop with this racial nonsense. You are complicit to the dividing of the U.S.
964519021721870336 2018-02-16 15:17:09 UTC <dominionofme> @Newsweek @MarkKoogler @Applan69 Being a snowflake is exclusive to leftist ideologues. Sorry honey.
964518211562729473 2018-02-16 15:13:56 UTC <dominionofme> @Newsweek The polls the polls! They are always right!   oh wait....pic.twitter.com/cokSvukdGI
964513311151751169 2018-02-16 14:54:27 UTC <dominionofme> @blackrepublican I dont know any white people who feel this way. I liked the movie but the constant nonsense like this and the obsession with race and who we think is angry does a disservice to our co-existence and progress.  Who cares what color the cast is. Its a good movie.
964509420649664512 2018-02-16 14:39:00 UTC <dominionofme> @KollegeKidd @Sunnythakid @cozydrugs Idk. Some racist piece of crap like her might now.

964508040320946176 2018-02-16 14:33:31 UTC <dominionofme> @NRA @EricBoehlert @clairmc Good picture. It shows that if you dont protect the NRA... everyone in the picture would be dead.

964504336624742406 2018-02-16 14:18:48 UTC <dominionofme> @RedTRaccoon @lagloriacubano Show me how many NRA members have committed terrorist acts?  I'll wait... but I already know the answer. You should educate yourself as to what the answer is cupcake.
964503932822269954 2018-02-16 14:17:11 UTC <dominionofme> @aldynred @TheEducatedCon1 @cdman69 American citizens DO NEED... a backbone. A will to educate themselves of how to use and respect a firearm. We NEED people who are willing to DO something when the horrific event is taking place. Like the guy in Texas that shot the shooter that went into a church. EDUCATE YOURSELF
964503451865632768 2018-02-16 14:15:17 UTC <dominionofme> @aldynred Umm.. Automatic weapons are heavily restricted. The Cruz kid that shot up the school used a semi auto rifle.

964289261146136577 2018-02-15 00:04:10 UTC <dominionofme> @PrisonPlanet Shapiro made a brilliant retort to this earlier. Shes of course saying "she was just pointing it out"  Yes the tone of tweet makes it pretty clear what shes doing.
964274124007800832 2018-02-15 23:04:01 UTC <dominionofme> @dorothyofisrael @jodiecongirl More people should embrace action. Not by-standing focus. Learn how to grow a spine. If you live in the U.S., buy a gun. Arm yourself with the knowledge of the gun and how to use it. We should all have the backbone to stop these maniacs in their tracks.
964272957911699456 2018-02-15 22:59:23 UTC <dominionofme> @dorothyofisrael @maxgoof3 Lets not be rude. Lets try and change the narrative when people make these idiotic comments... no matter how tempting.
964006613970509824 2018-02-14 05:21:01 UTC <dominionofme> @joshgremillion @DECA_haleigh Yes. We need a discussion on this if there are multiple warning signs in cases like this.

963972120047955968 2018-02-14 03:03:57 UTC <dominionofme> @michaelianblack Since you think youre a comedian, let me help you.  Its called sarcasm. Hopefully now you can use something like that to help you become funny.
963970949304463361 2018-02-14 02:59:18 UTC <dominionofme> @michaelianblack 12 rules of life by Jordan Peterson  Not saying the book is an answer, but it makes a whole lot of sense.
963969039147175936 2018-02-14 02:51:43 UTC <dominionofme> @IdealMomBody @BravingRuin @cockygifs Sounds like she should do what most people do... and ignore corporate news all together.  Oh wait. Anyone stupid enough to support any Democrat or Republican at this point is stupid enough to get their information from people like Alex here.
963968243558993921 2018-02-14 02:48:33 UTC <dominionofme> @The_Trump_Train @HiffGreg Its a rhetorical question that wasnt even directed at you @Johanne07463600
963963380141887490 2018-02-14 02:29:14 UTC <dominionofme> @bariweiss @tinylisalu1 @husseymichael The point is that these race baiting, polarizing, uneducated "journalist" are writing adolescent, polarizing statements that dont make any sense.  Its like youre a BLM activist throwing anecdote punchlines, and dismissing facts on the cultural issues that revolve around us.pic.twitter.com/znYa7u2tai
963956537688551424 2018-02-14 02:02:02 UTC <dominionofme> @jpodhoretz It has some bland moments but I think its a good start for a HBO series.
963951821537599489 2018-02-14 01:43:18 UTC <dominionofme> @weprogressives You should focus on whats good and whats bad. Its not difficult.  Educate yourself on how firearms work. Respect the use of them like most Americans do, and finally be brave enough like many Americans to use your gun against evil, like Cruz.
963950483009359878 2018-02-14 01:37:59 UTC <dominionofme> @PrisonPlanet @tcmilbert Im the one who doesnt make sense? I make the statement that everyone is mad about the situation and you said "No, idiot"  Read a book cupcake. I suggest 12 rules of life by JP

963921082871934976 2018-02-14 23:41:09 UTC <dominionofme> @PrisonPlanet @tcmilbert I think people are pissed about all of this in general... Troll.

963904855164190720 2018-02-14 22:36:40 UTC <dominionofme> @SymoneDSanders You THINK this only happens in America. We have the most cameras.  Young gay men dont even make it to the school in some countries before being thrown off a roof.  You are dense and no one says this is normal.
963818434722254848 2018-02-14 16:53:16 UTC <dominionofme> @RealJamesWoods @DianeRomeo3 Hes leaving because he agrees with you asshole. He wanted action but couldnt do anything because the high ends of our government protect people who are seeking political promotion.
963816219135627264 2018-02-14 16:44:28 UTC <dominionofme> @danpfeiffer Probably because there are around 15 unanswered questions that people want to know as to why an Ambassador and soldiers were killed despite the aggression and instability, along with request for reinforcement.  Educate yourself of the events of Sept 11 2012.
963815280676950022 2018-02-14 16:40:44 UTC <dominionofme> @maydaymindy9 She is a porn star. People pay porn stars for their sexual company.
963536101599260673 2018-02-13 22:11:22 UTC <dominionofme> @CNN Whoever operates this account, or all those involved. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Educate yourselves on how this face overseers concentration camps. Shes one of the top personnel in NK deliberate propaganda.  Fix yourselves. You need real psychological help.
963535391524622336 2018-02-13 22:08:33 UTC <dominionofme> @CNN @lscarter1969 Or just move the entire corporation over there to spread more propaganda. I would love to call CNN employees my communist enemy.
963533099471654912 2018-02-13 21:59:27 UTC <dominionofme> @JackBaileyUSA @ShomahKhoobi It was crafted in 1787... the last time it was amended was 26 years ago I believe? I like and disagree with parts of the constitution as should anyone thats aware its 2018...  But I think youre just too dense for any genuine conversation.
963464863182966784 2018-02-13 17:28:18 UTC <dominionofme> @JackBaileyUSA @ShomahKhoobi Some people are truth seekers more than they are party apologist like yourself.  Hopefully youll grow up one day and understand that people are more important than your deflecting.
963149287994548224 2018-02-12 20:34:19 UTC <dominionofme> @MrDanZak Look at Obama man spreading. Sheeeeesh am I right leftist ideologues?

963098283613843459 2018-02-12 17:11:38 UTC <dominionofme> @SherrynBell Wait... So you are defending someone that oversees NK concentration camps and is in fact the lead propagandist that starves and kills millions under that family? Just so you can vent about how you think Pence is rude?  Grow the f up. Educate yourself on these North Koreans.
963087290468851718 2018-02-12 16:27:58 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @speculawyer I disagree cupcake. Not every women is spineless enough to not find humor in it.

963083400583270401 2018-02-12 16:12:30 UTC <dominionofme> @BV @business Its 2018. Its no secret that men are more interested existentially & women are more interested in life. You can imagine men will change the oil in the car himself. A woman will likely not care for her car as much as the people or friends that are waiting to interact with her
963073648436367360 2018-02-12 15:33:45 UTC <dominionofme> @davidmackau @LeDonne_Prime1 Definitely not like any first lady we've seen. I wonder if people will ever talk about the unpopular problem of beautiful women seeking money through powerful men.
962777375627993089 2018-02-11 19:56:28 UTC <dominionofme> @TPostMillennial Because in the age of information. Educating oneself is not only progressive given the circumstances of technology but critical to a movement of responsibly through family social economic practice and avoidance of any echo chamber that wishes to silence an argument of words.
962767984229044224 2018-02-11 19:19:09 UTC <dominionofme> @lasesana im confused by this.... Conway says Hicks is strong and capable and you are saying she is saying the opposite?
962480771763245061 2018-02-10 00:17:52 UTC <dominionofme> @TorontoStar @cicc_o @A2Huginkiss @donisin1 Hes just picking at leftist cupcakes.
962467507482320896 2018-02-10 23:25:10 UTC <dominionofme> @TorontoStar "Could that be enough to disqualify Peterson from bragging rights?"  This is adolescence rhetoric.  The NY Times arent as special and prestigious as you think. Maybe for New Yorkers and far left ideologues that hold humanity back from progression.. but not for most of the world
962346318021758978 2018-02-10 15:23:36 UTC <dominionofme> @jimmykimmel @benshapiro @RubinReport @fleccas He would likely bring his baby to the debate and basically use his child and some harp strings and call it substance.  Although I would like to watch Ben explain that Kimmels privileges as a rich, sappy comedian have some influence.
962345698967552000 2018-02-10 15:21:08 UTC <dominionofme> @jimmykimmel @benshapiro @RubinReport @fleccas Why would you put a person who actually cares about policy compared to a comedian propaganda artist?
962120335733723136 2018-02-09 00:25:38 UTC <dominionofme> @chrislhayes Fun fact. Good people who understand the importance of free speech spent the day in Charlottesville on the side of the neo nazi's  ARGUING AGAINST THEM.... so much that some just went home because as it turns out, when you engage in debate with the idea of Nazism, Its easy to win
962004338221699072 2018-02-09 16:44:42 UTC <dominionofme> @1791L @MaiconJecsom @KingBrick01 HAHAHA... What??? Do you pay 10 dollars for some "personality test"?  Holy shit thats a funny projection you just owned... You should read JP's books.  They'll help you grow the f**k up lmao...
962000967179759616 2018-02-09 16:31:18 UTC <dominionofme> @USATODAY @valkrye131 Did you know you are projecting envy of Pence because its likely youve never had the spine or maturity to devote yourself so passionately to someone else?
961999795639504896 2018-02-09 16:26:39 UTC <dominionofme> @brhodes you really are creepy. Whoever thought you to be a smart person must be even more creepy than you.

961998473909415936 2018-02-09 16:21:23 UTC <dominionofme> @BronzeHammer @Aliquickk @_mandydee I agree Kirk makes a good point. And then someone who has lots of insecurities and daddy issues, like yourself responded.
961990669773541377 2018-02-09 15:50:23 UTC <dominionofme> @krutch47 @sashby1988 I dont listen to Alex Jones but based on the facts, he did call out many operations early on that turned out to be true. For example. The U.S. government embeds smart T.V.s and other things to have back doors for hackers to not only listen, but use the camera to view from the T.V
961972006005694464 2018-02-09 14:36:13 UTC <dominionofme> @krutch47 source?
961971714065346561 2018-02-09 14:35:03 UTC <dominionofme> @benwikler So its wrenching to you that our elected officials put country over party politics and kept government open for the U.S. citizens and their children who are starving and dying?   Fun fact: Obama once said that DACA is "NOT A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP." But hes a pathological liar so..
961971143564460032 2018-02-09 14:32:47 UTC <dominionofme> @maydaymindy9 @galizerigfanda Im just glad Al put his country over politics. We should be proud of these 73 democrats who are keeping U.S. citizens secure and not putting other countries citizens first.
961970716253048834 2018-02-09 14:31:05 UTC <dominionofme> @saint_croissant Without a government in motion, the people who are citizens of this country die off. The people WHO SUPPORT YOU...   You are projecting and putting other countries defectors and citizens first by holding the rest of us hostage. Grow up. Read a book worth reading.

It has something to do with "being pro creation is morally reprehensible because life is suffering and until we figure out how to end suffering of all forms, children should not be brought into the world"
961685603472601090 2018-02-08 19:38:09 UTC <dominionofme> @petefrasermusic @Dorianlynskey Not sure why youre ironically telling people about "proper editing" when you cant even get facts on Jordan Peterson right, for example; He is actually a centrist and you and your crazy echo chamber of leftist minded adolescent children are scared of him speaking truth to power.
961683997452652544 2018-02-08 19:31:46 UTC <dominionofme> @guardian Peterson isnt hitting the hornets nest. He is blowing THC into the nest of angry passive aggressive marxist/leftist morons like the person who wrote this article.
961683110135033856 2018-02-08 19:28:15 UTC <dominionofme> @guardian @Dorianlynskey is just another ISIS apologist and angry social justice closet Nazi. Let them write their vastly inaccurate hit pieces. Their delusion feeds common sense to those who understand where Peterson is coming from.
961657168452833280 2018-02-08 17:45:10 UTC <dominionofme> @ConfessionsExMu People dressing modestly needs enthusiasm from general common sense... not religion reasons. Christians that wear long skirts are not the same as Muslims dressed in all black gowns with the only thing being seen is a devious pair of eyes.

North Koreans are in a much worse state than the thousands of homeless people in LA.
961046361402675205 2018-02-06 01:18:02 UTC <dominionofme> @business @shablon31 You should read about the 1930s in the U.S.
960966666275491845 2018-02-06 20:01:21 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @old_osc Ive read many, as an avid reader I would like to know which books you think I should read.  Belligerent troll.
960958035211452416 2018-02-06 19:27:03 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @old_osc Based on reports and concepts students competing for the best southern border wall designs...   A ladder wont get you far.

You dont care if Americans are being killed by these crazy ass gang members who all vote for your standards of policy. Go blog about some straw man argument troll.
960956554626453504 2018-02-06 19:21:10 UTC <dominionofme> @KelemenCari I dont think this is the narrative the left wants so... they'll ignore it and jump in anyones face that says the MS-13 members are illegal aliens.
960956065365086208 2018-02-06 19:19:14 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @old_osc IF THERE IS NO WALL AND WE DEPORT THE MS-13 GANG MEMBERS GUESS WHAT THEY WILL DO WHEN THEY GET BOOTED OUT?  Hint: It has to do with walking and not giving a shit about our laws.
960955077581312000 2018-02-06 19:15:18 UTC <dominionofme> @KamalaHarris All cities change over 100 years. Too bad there are racist propagandist like yourself that are pushing the pendulum the other way  Its as if you all wont stop the race baiting and ignoring facts until you enslave white people. Please tell the people who voted for you to grow up.
960952430933487616 2018-02-06 19:04:47 UTC <dominionofme> @business @shablon31 First you assume that I think the U.S. is a paradise, thats just moronic.. then you name call while you virtue signal about strawmans within the homeless community.  Go to a republics state and see how many homeless people there are compared to a democratic one.
960929781129805829 2018-02-06 17:34:47 UTC <dominionofme> @lol_tyler1 @DrDisRespect @ImAfricanJesus Right... age as an insult lol...  This is how mediocre Doc haters are. At least come up with something funny.
960701914416476160 2018-02-05 02:29:20 UTC <dominionofme> @BillClinton @HillaryClinton No one wants you to be speaking of policy anymore. We just want you to go away & live out the rest of your life as peaceful as possible given the warmongering and death that you have built over the years.  Stay out of American lives, write another one of your crazy books.
960662480778354688 2018-02-05 23:52:38 UTC <dominionofme> @business @shablon31 I didnt lol. America has its shit holes.. But those homeless people do benefit from our correct socialism with shelters and what not...  Also, notice all the worst places of homelessness in the U.S. are overrun by leftist ideologues?

959913381301030914 2018-02-03 22:15:59 UTC <dominionofme> Whats your perspective as someone capable of making it to the secret service? I for one, wouldnt be surprised if a cowardly troll like yourself wouldnt have the spine to put your human condition to the test of such a choice.
959846393748783104 2018-02-03 17:49:48 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu Your passive aggression is showing and Gowdy is leaving that pile of corrupt status quo artist within congress... like YOUpic.twitter.com/OgbKJZWe9i
959845691295182856 2018-02-03 17:47:00 UTC <dominionofme> @Penuel_Mashele Maybe your message should be something along the lines of... "Stop giving a shit what people think of you." "Do whatever you want" doesnt sound reasonable when if we wanted to.. we could start killing eachother cause "Society is going to judge anyway".  Just live and let live.
959844827750944768 2018-02-03 17:43:34 UTC <dominionofme> @brycetache How you doin leftist ideologue? Just curious. If Carter is a russian agent... why is he a walking free man at the moment despite 3 FISA warrants that have violated his 4th amendment?
959842803642757120 2018-02-03 17:35:32 UTC <dominionofme> @funder You are a creep looking person. I wouldnt be surprised if some women come out admitting you harassed them.

959819967096131584 2018-02-03 16:04:47 UTC <dominionofme> @10grandgiveaway Take your tin foil hat off. He worked for Merrill Lynch. I thought you said you read the memo? So is every employee working for Merrill Lynch, and involved with oil contracts a Russian spy?   Educate yourself
959818839302311936 2018-02-03 16:00:18 UTC <dominionofme> @10grandgiveaway The source is a british spy known for working with Russian gov entities. So the FBI, DOJ, paid for by the DNC pushed this warrant ON AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.  Ask yourself. When have we used a FISA warrant to spy on an American citizen? A citizen that rejected Podobnyy, a Putin bot.
959804431775748096 2018-02-03 15:03:03 UTC <dominionofme> @jimishbathia Does it? Ever stop to think maybe these social media outlets do us a disservice in how we connect and socialize?
959804040333938689 2018-02-03 15:01:30 UTC <dominionofme> @princesssofpwr @everydaywithk Actually it explains that the DNC paid people who have worked with the Russian government to build up a warrant to spy on an American citizen. But im sure youll dismiss it and focus on your echo chamber of conspiracy theorist. Dont forget your tinfoil hat cupcake!
959803623587893248 2018-02-03 14:59:50 UTC <dominionofme> @JochenWeiler If I was beign spied on by Obama the Clintons and their Russian pals Id be far from that White House golfing every day too...

Bob Mueller helped push the claim about WMDs

959475998491324416 2018-02-02 17:17:58 UTC <dominionofme> @SenJohnMcCain @LeoShane McCain is a hack who only cares about the status quo of enabling corruption "for the greater good"  Men like him are the reason millions are dead in the middle east. Men like him and Mueller are the reason the U.S. went to war based on a lie about "weapons of mass destruction"

How many elections have you noticed the U.S. "subverting"?  (Takes off tin foil hat) Did you know Mueller helped push the claim Saddam had WMDs or nah?
959463221907410945 2018-02-02 16:27:12 UTC <dominionofme> @jordanbpeterson @RubinReport @benshapiro @BenShapQuotes @KTjorson I would imagine the Kremlin is involved with their media, as the U.S. government is involved with most of theirs. And when Trump arrives at the times that U.S. media isnt aware of yet, Russians report it, to which then the U.S. government media reports it.  Am I a bot now?

As we all should.

959457304876855296 2018-02-02 16:03:41 UTC <dominionofme> @jordanbpeterson @mathomann Dude, So youre saying Dr Peterson is planning a coup to take over the world using his leniency towards capitalism and attempting to improve quality of life by pretending to be an activist for the necessity of free, liberated speech?

959293985654059008 2018-02-01 05:14:43 UTC <dominionofme> @chris_k_brewer @Scruffopone Whats it like being apart of a cult and hating that millions listen to someone whos taught at Harvard and U of T.

959069320750841856 2018-02-01 14:21:59 UTC <dominionofme> @Jewell40289493 You need to work on how you articulate yourself and you deffinately need to stop listening to people like like Wolff and MSNBC, CNN ect.   Its just sad watching you folks eat each other alive.
959067556429615110 2018-02-01 14:14:58 UTC <dominionofme> @MichaelWolffNYC Oh please... spare us all...  Your book is nothing different that Teen Vogue and the hottest new lip gloss.  You are a joke and somehow even more of a joke than MSNBC.

958706176849461250 2018-01-31 14:18:59 UTC <dominionofme> @GarrettVentry @leahwhct Yikes.. Might want to look into genuine people who report facts. If you get your facts from places like WashingtonPost, CNN, FoxNews... you are doing yourself a disservice in the age of information. Lots of people on Youtube have more reliable sources and interest in co-existence
958541669602856960 2018-01-30 03:25:17 UTC <dominionofme> @GarrettVentry @leahwhct I agree with all of those points but you didnt answer my question honestly.

958418517761675268 2018-01-30 19:15:55 UTC <dominionofme> @pnehlen What are you doing.... a population of people elected you? Do they know you are making lists of jews and non-jews? As a person on the right, do you suffer from the disconnect as the left does when it comes to these identity politics?
958416964229193728 2018-01-30 19:09:45 UTC <dominionofme> @Lnonblonde @adamcbest @DIRTYYYSOUTH State and local police officers are a lot more vulnerable to violent, delusional leftist than an FBI agent.  Im willing to bet you dont have much respect for either because people who are centrist and republicans want to remove the corrupt deep state totally...  Not dismiss them
958416249020657664 2018-01-30 19:06:54 UTC <dominionofme> @adamcbest You are misinformed. Most people, not just republicans... are looking at the leaders of these branches and seeing corrupt, bias, dismissive tactics  Its an attack on the deep corrupt state that Obama built over the last 8 years and that Bush likely helped build. Dont be naive

Pretty sure hundreds of millions of us couldnt stand her at all, never mind the fact she rigged the election against Bernie Sanders.
958382008316694528 2018-01-30 16:50:51 UTC <dominionofme> @GarrettVentry @leahwhct I doubt it. Most far left modern liberal minded U.S. voters are very ironic and greedy. They hate that good things are happening without a Democrat President.. its just sad and pathetic.

One of you are going to dismiss the effect you had on the other of the emotional devastation it does to them when you separate after intimacy, as most do. GL

But I fear she will dismiss it non the less based on what I would think would be the fact she wont admit that she cares more about having sex with no strings attached than a will for responsibility through family social economic prosperity.

956613896974098433 2018-01-25 19:45:00 UTC <dominionofme> @business @BeckiiAalto The entire intelligence community also believed Saddam had Weapons of Mass Destruction honey.

By the way... the person who stopped an athiest killing religious folk months back was an NRA member. Was he morally bankrupt when he put down the animal that was mass killing?
956594669974061056 2018-01-25 18:28:36 UTC <dominionofme> @jordynmccrazy12 Because much of the world is tired of cowardly behavior, tired of people not being brave enough to say what they think, people being told they are not as morally righteous as others, sick of echo chambers. Safe spaces were meant for people like war veterans & PTSD, not SJWs..
956588551482855424 2018-01-25 18:04:17 UTC <dominionofme> @PrisonPlanet @kingofkings247 And telling people they are hateful because they want to protect Americans through actual immagration reform isnt being a dick?  Educate yourself of your opposition before you sound like another hack on CNN.
956585339568771073 2018-01-25 17:51:32 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @natehoIe I wonder if they all harbor WMDs like Mueller claimed Saddam did.

956559270513987584 2018-01-25 16:07:56 UTC <dominionofme> @CNNOpinion @DrPeggyDrexler @CNN People at CNN are truly disconnected not only from the masses, but from this judge herself.  SHE has requested that her name be kept out of the story because these incidents are about the women that came out, not her.   Respect the judges wish to remain out of the news assholes
956552001072128000 2018-01-25 15:39:03 UTC <dominionofme> @Slate Ive got a title for you too cupcake!  "@joegibbskins; Moronic millennial"

956541916086235136 2018-01-25 14:58:59 UTC <dominionofme> @timkaine @g8r84 By the way I was one of the people in Charlottesville on the side of the "Nazi murderers"  Others and myself were arguing with the neo nazi's and their ill logic and mentally delusional stances on issues. Some went home because of the robust debate. So we are bad people for that?

956535392974594053 2018-01-25 14:33:03 UTC <dominionofme> @sjredmond Could you define Trump"ism"?  I think society has stupefied itself with the attachments to the extension "ism"  But by all means, explain what Trumpism is?
956528268127109120 2018-01-25 14:04:45 UTC <dominionofme> @kwilli1046 He also helped push the claim that Saddam had WMDs. A claim that got millions killed. A lot of people like to dismiss that fact.

956289923073617922 2018-01-24 22:17:39 UTC <dominionofme> @MattWalshBlog The judge herself is smart enough to understand that it has nothign to do with her and everything to do with the girls/women coming out.  But leftist ideologist need to propagandize and politicize everything and that including ignoring the Judges wish to remain out of discussion
956284285744500736 2018-01-24 21:55:15 UTC <dominionofme> @timkaine Ask Hillary if her Mentor the KKK leader Robert Byrd had any input before his racist ass was buried.

956277648422047744 2018-01-24 21:28:52 UTC <dominionofme> @HadleyFreeman Judge Aquilina asked for you to leave her out of it because its not about her and shes absolutely right.  If only you leftist in your echo chambers actually cared about these girls.

956180120896770048 2018-01-24 15:01:20 UTC <dominionofme> @RoastAndTroll Pretty sure a leftist will call anyone that disagrees with them a racist regardless if they try to defend themselves preemptively like this.  #TheMoreYouKnow

955826413759803394 2018-01-23 15:35:50 UTC <dominionofme> @lynnedyhop @nancylee2016 @eldavey Thats like saying the reason jobs have been on the upswing is because of Donald Trump is now President. Are you that naive?
955820082378264578 2018-01-23 15:10:40 UTC <dominionofme> @lynnedyhop @nancylee2016 @eldavey Educate yourself. Detroit has been under Democrat influence for quite some time. There may be some extra right wingers in as of recent years because of all the failure but its always been a dominated Democrat city. For example Obama in 2012 won 97.5 of the votes.
955809538925563907 2018-01-23 14:28:46 UTC <dominionofme> @ShaunKing Maybe if 70% or more of them werent incest and religious fanatics the world would pander to them more.
955808082512277506 2018-01-23 14:22:59 UTC <dominionofme> @MatthewACherry Odd. It wasnt a good movie. Just a movie that reinforced delusional individuals that believe a faceless white person is "out to get them"

955512338995646464 2018-01-22 18:47:48 UTC <dominionofme> @Rich705 Its pretty simple. You are either voting to keep the government open for American lives.  Or you are complicit to the government being shut down for the sake of what was suppose to be a temporary program based on Obamas agenda and upbringing.

955469523410477057 2018-01-22 15:57:40 UTC <dominionofme> @RubinReport @FPiednoel Modern socialism and how its defined is not exclusively defined by you. Neither is capitalism.   The results of what these two bring on is how its defined. Read some history on how many suffered under socialism and how it helped give rise to the National Socialist German Workers.
955463468936843265 2018-01-22 15:33:37 UTC <dominionofme> @jacksara2 Based on history the city is in fact the capital of Judaeo Christian foundations which is why every Pres including Obama in recent decades have said they will embrace that fact. Palestinians as of now are 70% incest give or take and are emboldened by the sick ideology of Islam.

954440301917233153 2018-01-19 19:47:55 UTC <dominionofme> @ksecus Do you know how a vote works? If you refuse to help LEGAL citizens that need government to stay open. You are complicit with the shutdown that the Republicans are voting to stop. Its not rocket science cupcake.

954438797965524992 2018-01-19 19:41:56 UTC <dominionofme> @JesseCharlesLee Must take one heck of a coward to ignore dismiss and deflect from the details of a memo.  The only conspiracy theory ive noticed lately is this idea that Russians effected the way people vote. Have you educated yourself of Hillarys repulsiveness?

954363416050839554 2018-01-19 14:42:24 UTC <dominionofme> @socarolinesays @dinnerbeans So you just want to kill a shark so your narrow minded political humor could get some points?
954361105576595456 2018-01-19 14:33:13 UTC <dominionofme> @Marmel (puts on tin foil hat) "YA! Russia is responsible for the memo! Saddam really did have WMDs... oh and UNICORNS! They reside at the end of every rainbow, planted by Russians."  Leftist propaganda is hilarious.

954356718233845760 2018-01-19 14:15:47 UTC <dominionofme> @ChrisJZullo Probably because american military died because of just another pile of negligence and propagandizing on Hillarys old desk.   No one has yet discovered the effect of this so called "russian collusion" that seems to be a conflicting story compared to this memo.

954061949460992000 2018-01-18 18:44:29 UTC <dominionofme> @Slate @cvptexas It calls him a hero of the alt-right in an attempt to clump him into that group so the narrative in echo chambers for the left stay consistent.  Problem is, with this logic that slate propagandizes, I'm allowed to say your hero is Joseph Stalin.

953681049585930241 2018-01-17 17:30:55 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @kellydanceclub From my experience most Europeans see Americans as right leaning anyway and they arent wrong in the grand scheme of things.
953679268151746560 2018-01-17 17:23:50 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @kellydanceclub It feels good to give. Acting on that is what I think matters. I'm both a capitalist and a socialist for those that need to categorize me, Ive used capitalism to eliminate the need for gov to provide socialism, through as I see it.. the use of charity. Take care.
953677909566337024 2018-01-17 17:18:26 UTC <dominionofme> @funder Awww.. You must be desperate for attention. I thought this was John McCain?
953676792656736257 2018-01-17 17:14:00 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @kellydanceclub I admire commitment, I just dont believe as you say.. that socialism nor capitalism, nor communism are helping us in general towards a peaceful and thriving future. We need to communicate with one another now more than ever to achieve new ideas for quality of life with everyone.
953673339922534400 2018-01-17 17:00:17 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @kellydanceclub Humans by nature will be greedy no matter what, some more than others, some will be greedy about different circumstances, some will be greedy with how much ice cream they eat, others will use socialism or capitalism to help themselves.
953670472750727173 2018-01-17 16:48:53 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @kellydanceclub There is a difference in crony capitalism like that, and good intent with capitalism. Just like there is a difference evidently between North Koreas socialism and whatever version you choose to believe. Take care.
953669234483171329 2018-01-17 16:43:58 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @kellydanceclub Its a shame, but you see my point? Not all charity has to be an organization. I and others did that because we felt it to be simply the right thing to do BECAUSE as you said gov, whether its mexicos The U.S., The U.K. or Norway, use gov practices like socialism to hurt us.
953667585039589376 2018-01-17 16:37:25 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @kellydanceclub I'm not telling you this to pat myself on the back, but are you suggesting that I should have never went to north mexico and used $36,600.00+ of my own money, earned through capitalism, to build houses for families that didnt have one? Im not sorry for "scourging" on them.
953663087776854017 2018-01-17 16:19:32 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @kellydanceclub I think its more complex than that. A new idea would be an enthusiasm for charity instead of socialism. But this is something I love to brainstorm on and talk all day about.. maybe another time fellow human being.
953662328662347777 2018-01-17 16:16:31 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @SCOUSEeric @leftisbestwing @strolltoitaly So whats so bad about a new idea? Whats so bad about renouncing both capitalism and socialism that have many different examples of use and most are used in ways that regress us as human race.
953662071522066432 2018-01-17 16:15:30 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @kellydanceclub I think we just need new ideas my friend. These bad ideas that have warped meaning and all kinds of different examples of use is just toxic and it will contribute to the collapse of our political discourse as humans beings among other things.
953661709075566593 2018-01-17 16:14:04 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @SCOUSEeric @strolltoitaly @leftisbestwing Good read! Thank you! But I'm not convinced. There is a reason this reporter for Daily UK mentions that its all "beginning to change". Because it hasnt. Maybe North korea is still using the art of socialism against its citizens.
953659398932647937 2018-01-17 16:04:53 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @SCOUSEeric @leftisbestwing @strolltoitaly Evil, greedy people will abuse any system to keep their agenda. Whether its capitalism or socialism. Both are ideas that have good intent but have severe consequences and socialism is more corrupt than capitalism and North Korea calling itself a socialist one is an example.
953658200376664066 2018-01-17 16:00:07 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @SCOUSEeric @strolltoitaly I describe dictatorships that use that bad idea of socialism to keep power and keep the citizens under the foot of the dictator.
953658014279569413 2018-01-17 15:59:23 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @SCOUSEeric @leftisbestwing @strolltoitaly Actually socialism is a tool thus far as history shows us, that hereditary rulers use to suppress the citizens into have less freedoms and quality of life.
953657622837825539 2018-01-17 15:57:50 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @SCOUSEeric @strolltoitaly Actually it is socialism in its most pure form in my view. A person in power tells the people under him he will take care of them with the money they are forced to pay while they all sit around brainwashed into thinking Socialism works. As many on twitter do.
953657317567975426 2018-01-17 15:56:37 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @SCOUSEeric Escape from Camp 14 by Blaine Harden. Good luck cupcake! Oh, I bet thats abusive too huh? lmfao..
953655777494994946 2018-01-17 15:50:30 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @kellydanceclub Do you deny that Trump has influence as he sits in the seat of President of the U.S.? Do you only care about your own nation as some kind of nationalist? The U.S. holds sway over the global market and I never said Socialism is an economic theory? Have you not read Karl Marx?

953654627861483520 2018-01-17 15:45:55 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @kellydanceclub I dont disagree with that, but to not have hope in the idea of someone NOT being corrupt or saying that everyone is just greedy without a solution is why so many were willing to not vote in 2016 at all and that gave Trump the presidency unfortunately.

953653882818826240 2018-01-17 15:42:58 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @kellydanceclub You have it backwards. History & its people in power have actually become less corrupt over time. Societies are built on well grounded political science and no political science has been perfect. The U.S. was founded on the idea of ending corruption but still greedy people exist
953652795172904960 2018-01-17 15:38:39 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @ilikdis I have many concerns with crony capitalism as well. But the brainwashed view of socialism as a benefit to a nations citizens, as the North Koreans see it... will always be the devolving repressiveness that it is cupcake.
953651441356419072 2018-01-17 15:33:16 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @SCOUSEeric @strolltoitaly @leftisbestwing Actually false unless you can show me a source. "The North Korean constitution is unique in combining strong socialist and nationalist tendencies as well as its reference to the country's Juche ideology" This has been a fact for a very long time. Since the end of the 1930s.
953650138068733952 2018-01-17 15:28:05 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @kellydanceclub And look at all the destabilization that followed. Less people than ever before are interested in being doctors, building societies lol... What are you smokin pot or somethin?
953649233478979584 2018-01-17 15:24:29 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @damian2649 A low leftist dolt that needs to classify those he disagrees with into certain groups to reinforce his weak and narrow minded view.

953648301026537472 2018-01-17 15:20:47 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter @frankiecrisp1 The communist manifesto 1848 karl marx & friedrich engels is what I've read among many more of his books. You see. I care about political discourse & avoiding a civil war. So I educated myself on Karl by reading his material so I could argue well. Dont be ignorant all your life!
953646899365543936 2018-01-17 15:15:13 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter Why would I read your article when youre ignorant to the fact that North Koreans and their dictator fully support socialism and North Korea is the purest form of it. Good luck! Hope you educate yourself!
953645392603820032 2018-01-17 15:09:14 UTC <dominionofme> @WillBlackWriter Thank you for proving a point of mine. You can tell yourself whatever you want, but the brainwashed regime of North Korea and its supporters understand that socialism is a strength of theirs, as the women says in the interview. I've read Marx. No form of socialism will ever work.

He at the very least pulled many out of the war but expanded NATO aggression on others

953311461140520960 2018-01-16 17:02:18 UTC <dominionofme> @spectatorindex The places at the top, especially Pakistan have a incest issue no one wants to talk about. Those numbers dont surprise me given that fact.

Please enlighten everyone here... and by the way... It is a statement of fact that you qualify for naturalization if you are at least 18 years old and have been a permanent resident for at least 5 years. Buncha crazy echo chambers.
952939832887693313 2018-01-15 16:25:35 UTC <dominionofme> @nwarikoo @NYCitizen07 @3rdDegreeBurns It is indeed a fact that you can qualify for naturalization if you are at least 18 years old and have been a permanent resident for at least 5 years.
952939511180414978 2018-01-15 16:24:18 UTC <dominionofme> @nwarikoo @Terry84184005 Please educate yourself. You can qualify for naturalization if you are at least 18 years old and have been a permanent resident for at least 5 years.

952935177830961153 2018-01-15 16:07:05 UTC <dominionofme> @nwarikoo Are we going to talk about the fact that he was here for decades and never got on a path to citizenship? Stop propagating isolated incidents of laziness.

We can have great movies without nudity and sex scenes.

950807593559248897 2018-01-09 19:12:50 UTC <dominionofme> @GeoffWacker @landanimalwtf @statismiscancer I have concern for this argument as well. What if the person doesnt have the money to afford a court case? Now days people do have the opportunity to at least have someone appointed a lawyer for SOME defense of theirs. How do we determine the judge is a trustworthy person?
950807163932422144 2018-01-09 19:11:07 UTC <dominionofme> @GeoffWacker @landanimalwtf @statismiscancer One hypothetical or straw man argument at a time... im not good at handling either.  Answer the question I asked though. If the people are making the choices for roads and other needed things, how do we determine the person with our money and their power make honest choices?
950804266075246593 2018-01-09 18:59:36 UTC <dominionofme> @GeoffWacker @landanimalwtf @statismiscancer What I dont think you understand is that the "who" is what matters here. Who is taking our collective money and making these choices? How do you or I know the person or group isnt corrupt?
950784365662961664 2018-01-09 17:40:32 UTC <dominionofme> @GeoffWacker @statismiscancer But I read mostly what we shouldnt do with a strong precision on imprisonment. I agree. Prison needs reformation but how will anarchy and the ignorance of a governing body help anyone? You see I just dont see the methodology of it. You are not stupid and I apologize for that sir
950781418975694848 2018-01-09 17:28:49 UTC <dominionofme> @GeoffWacker @statismiscancer But we do have the most comfortable prisons on the planet (not that I disagree with you that imprisonment may not help but hurt the person and the family worse) and if we dont have an outside force that changes these peoples situation its likely that love and respect wont do shit
950778675980570624 2018-01-09 17:17:55 UTC <dominionofme> @GeoffWacker @statismiscancer But crack is harmful, not just to the person doing it, but the people who are around it, as I said. I want to help the crack head but if we are ignorant to the fact that crack is killing the person and hurting the family that witness it, it just sounds like enabling chaos.
950775424388337664 2018-01-09 17:05:00 UTC <dominionofme> @GeoffWacker @statismiscancer I can agree on that but human influence goes a long way. I want "people in costumes" to be ready to intervene in the case where you cannot.   Sometimes people thinking they arent harming anyone is just not noticed. A crack head in his home is hurting his family that witness it.
950764028749639680 2018-01-09 16:19:43 UTC <dominionofme> @GeoffWacker @statismiscancer Because without law & order it would be chaos and to think that people would just act civilized given human history with no laws is naive and reckless. Im genuinely interested in your ideas because of our two party tyranny at the moment but an idea without structure is pointless
950762099302699008 2018-01-09 16:12:03 UTC <dominionofme> @GeoffWacker @statismiscancer Comply to what?

What are people in costumes going to force me to do?
950754695152316417 2018-01-09 15:42:38 UTC <dominionofme> @GeoffWacker @statismiscancer Let me guess. Im too stupid for you to answer the question? Get your 5 year old on here. She sounds smarter than you. Lets here it. Who is forcing me to comply to what?
950753543501250561 2018-01-09 15:38:03 UTC <dominionofme> @GeoffWacker @statismiscancer I ask you a question & unsurprisingly you just repeat the question. Typical of an anarchist to not have a prepare thought much less a blueprint on how we coexist. Anarchism is the result of a feeble mind that doesnt have any solutions, just a need to re-label their cynicism.
950751559461335040 2018-01-09 15:30:10 UTC <dominionofme> @GeoffWacker @statismiscancer You can defend yourself with the 2nd amendment against any force. Who is forcing people to comply? To comply to what? The U.S. political science is the most significant on earth and people like me moved here because of it. Get yourself educated bud.
950748243499126785 2018-01-09 15:16:59 UTC <dominionofme> @GeoffWacker @statismiscancer "By voting you allowing" Ya im done.. You cant even articulate yourself well.

950743234451591169 2018-01-09 14:57:05 UTC <dominionofme> @GeoffWacker @statismiscancer So I shouldnt have voted for Obama and I shouldnt vote for independent candidates? Again, whatever helps you and that low IQ of yours sleep at night cupcake.
950742444399788033 2018-01-09 14:53:57 UTC <dominionofme> @PrisonPlanet @MattBracken48 @adamndsmith Dont think he needs it. Image is quite accurate of google without the fancy editing cupcake.
950740598016921600 2018-01-09 14:46:37 UTC <dominionofme> @GeoffWacker @statismiscancer I wonder if idiots like you are aware you contribute to Trumps presidency and his odds of winning in 2020 with this adolescent belligerence. Go find another isolated incident to help you and your low IQ sleep at night.
950738585581473792 2018-01-09 14:38:37 UTC <dominionofme> @GQMagazine @PatriotNewsCorp @john_l_smith___ You belligerently say 128, another idiot belligerently says 67... None of you know what youre talking about. indeed 99% or more of police officers do not abuse power, and if they shoot an unarmed person its probably because the person isnt good at listening to a cops instruction.

I never assumed you supported him. Where did your low IQ get that I like people groping my family? I just stated a fact. Whores approach people like Trump and his money and WANT to be groped. Sorry youre too stupid to acknowledge the toxicity of it
950576456672964608 2018-01-08 03:54:22 UTC <dominionofme> @RealJamesWoods @lauracgilleslil @a3auntie @bking12_bryan @Ohio_Buckeye_US @Obamatomic Are you naive enough to not believe him in the recording when he said "they let you do it"   Are you socially inept you dont know people grope each other in clubs, ESPECIALLY if the persons a millionaire or more? The culture of it is why people were quiet about Harvey & Trump.
950488425421033472 2018-01-08 22:04:34 UTC <dominionofme> @RealJamesWoods @lauracgilleslil @a3auntie @bking12_bryan @Ohio_Buckeye_US @Obamatomic Just keep telling yourself everyone on the internet that disagrees with you is a russian bot. It will help you and that low IQ of yours sleep at night. Good luck cupcake!
950465787009093632 2018-01-08 20:34:37 UTC <dominionofme> @CharlesMBlow @jcapulet301 Hillary supposedly had all this knowledge & luckily the masses understand that it depends on who the person is. She is in fact a pathological lying sociopath that didnt even have enough skill or common sense to reinforce the request for security in Benghazi. This is just one case

Your noneducational adolescence decided to delude yourself into thinking the long time psychologist is a platform for the alt right.

950217707856846850 2018-01-07 04:08:50 UTC <dominionofme> @ksenapathy If youre stupid enough to think Jordan Peterson is an "alt right hero" I suppose it wouldnt be surprising that you have kids with violent urges to shoot up houses with something with a trigger.
950216385837322243 2018-01-07 04:03:35 UTC <dominionofme> @Slate @ksenapathy Quite uneducated and negligent journalism by associating JP with the alt right groups. Hope you work out your adolescent professionalism and grow up one day sweetie.
950067382155923457 2018-01-07 18:11:29 UTC <dominionofme> Even before the exposure of that Hollywood is nothing but pedophiles, sexual assault artist and their enablers...   No one cares about the #GoldenGlobes and all the disconnected opinions on what should be our policy and where our morality should stand. Screw the #GoldenGlobes
949289879963348992 2018-01-05 14:41:58 UTC <dominionofme> @babygirlme101 I cant stand Trump but your ignorance? I hate it more. Please grow up and educate yourself on what the Clintons are responsible for.

949285216509747201 2018-01-05 14:23:27 UTC <dominionofme> @AdamParkhomenko Careful reading through this twitter comment section.   Lots of delusional leftist trying to pretend Hillary is innocent of all the crimes and lies shes put her stake in.

Then get reinforced gratitude by your peers for such moral high ground status quo (likes and retweets).  Please block me too. I dont care for spinless adolescence towards communication.
949066804063817732 2018-01-04 23:55:33 UTC <dominionofme> @TheRickyDavila @forfsakes You dont speak for me or the hundreds of millions that agree with me when i say.. Hillary would of been so much worse and at the same time, so much less entertaining.
949034413874208768 2018-01-04 21:46:51 UTC <dominionofme> @ILLUMINATIAM Shit is pure evil. You can pretend and teach people your power cannot be underminded...  But millions upon millions of us are not phased by your assumed "mind control" and corruption.  Millions upon millions of us are going to end your reign. Run and hide well Illuminati.
948956170466873344 2018-01-04 16:35:56 UTC <dominionofme> @keithboykin Considering the fact Robert Mueller was partially responsible for lying to everyone about WMDs. Id say there is probably nothing to worry about.
948955725920919552 2018-01-04 16:34:10 UTC <dominionofme> @sjredmond Can you imagine how awful it would be if Hillary Rodham Clinton was the puppet in power?

948569082881855489 2018-01-03 14:57:47 UTC <dominionofme> @IsTrumpCareDead Trumps tweets could kill us! The earth is flat! The moon landing was fake! Kim Jong Un is more sane than a U.S. President! Saddam really did have WMDs like Mueller said, oh... and Unicorns are at the end of every rainbow.
948562919515742208 2018-01-03 14:33:18 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump LOL! I love coming to Trumps twitter feed to witness all the angry little libs ranting and reinforcing their asinine ideas and weak insults.

946808363995877377 2017-12-29 18:21:19 UTC <dominionofme> @AnneMarieIAm @ChrisPittard9 just a bunch of false senses of moral high ground.

946764301267800067 2017-12-29 15:26:14 UTC <dominionofme> @lsarsour They worship your Allah. Whats it like having that in common with them?

Or where is Nazi Paikidze-Barnes who pulled out of middle eastern chess championships in response to womens oppression? Who the heck is Beyonce Knowles... the pop artist? This world is becoming more and more ignorant.
946064690286858240 2017-12-27 17:06:13 UTC <dominionofme> @nationalpost @wheresrosinow And yet most people who dont support trump agree that Obama and wedding invitations isnt any news worth reading.
946064395439927296 2017-12-27 17:05:03 UTC <dominionofme> @nationalpost Lol no one cares about Obama anymore and average people dont give a shit who attends the PRINCE and PRINCESSES wedding... Royal families need to come to and end anyway. No ones blood is special.

946033996777033733 2017-12-27 15:04:15 UTC <dominionofme> @ryandouglassw @MissDahlELama So the black guy is talking about this "80% group of people he isnt comparable to" based on your standards of genuine publishing.

945902894787809280 2017-12-26 06:23:18 UTC <dominionofme> @nytimes @TheShaunHayes1 If this is the resistance I feel kinda bad for the lefties in the US. Really pitiful that they think any of us give a f*** about what "artist" have to say about policy. We just need to keep exposing the pedophilia and sexual assault culture within all these nuts.
945902134188478464 2017-12-26 06:20:17 UTC <dominionofme> @nytimes Cause no one cares what these artist have to say. We have bigger problems than their drama and belligerence. They all have twitter. We want to criticize their shitty work. When was the last time we had a truly good movie anyway? "Get out"? I say that with sarcasm. Movie sucked.

For example someone could misread a situation as disrespect when in reality it was just misunderstanding. Thats why free speech must supersede wishful thinking that pronouns give identity.

941078554699337728 2017-12-13 22:53:06 UTC <dominionofme> @KevinAllred You should take off "educator". I really do feel sorry for anyone that thinks they learn anything from closet fascist socialist like yourself.
941008603963691008 2017-12-13 18:15:08 UTC <dominionofme> @GenJohnKelly @ccade937 You know thats not actually him right cupcake? You people are so stupid it hurts.

941004572465745920 2017-12-13 17:59:07 UTC <dominionofme> @nytimes @washingtonpost @NickKristof Sorry but a few good people in a cesspit of bias, uneducated trolls... doesnt make up for all the shit posting they have done.  This is why people trust Wikileaks. Because its a non profit company that has a 100% accuracy track record with the information they distribute.
941003727691018240 2017-12-13 17:55:46 UTC <dominionofme> @EdKrassen @cox_priya Because she has influence still, and Trump is awful, but she would of been sooooo much worse. I am an independent.
941003461302390784 2017-12-13 17:54:42 UTC <dominionofme> @EdKrassen You poor uneducated people. Mueller, along with Comey and people like James Clapper were the ones who brought the "proof" to Bush that Saddam had WMDs. If you think Mueller is credible after getting millions killed over a lie... you should get out of your echo chamber.

940963320294793217 2017-12-13 15:15:12 UTC <dominionofme> @EdKrassen #ThankYouAlabama No one knows how to barely beat a pedophile like you. Ironic you call this a step back to sanity yet all one has to do is explore your twitter feed to understand how and why youll continue to lose most elections. GJ again, you barely beat a pedophile.
940962066357280768 2017-12-13 15:10:13 UTC <dominionofme> @Acosta Warning when scrolling down: Lots of poorly uneducated folks that think Jim Acosta is a reliable source of sources. They won in Alabama.. let them have their day, they barely beat a pedophile and now they are super proud lmfao.
940960002000420864 2017-12-13 15:02:01 UTC <dominionofme> @Acosta Jim Acosta. 2017s biggest troll trying to pose as a journalist. We all know youre a joke cupcake. Go find some propaganda to peddle, creep.

940461567082221568 2017-12-11 06:01:25 UTC <dominionofme> @matthewasears @jordanbpeterson @PetersonDiscipl @StaticLucidity I think he was just exaggerating a point that no, which you agree(?), followers on twitter or the amount of likes they get does not give an argument validity in this cesspit of a pseudo social culture of far left and right echo chambers.
940459487965663233 2017-12-11 05:53:09 UTC <dominionofme> @matthewasears @jordanbpeterson @PetersonDiscipl Or an indicator you have a short perception and a severe disconnection from the masses. People did this to Petersons image because he speaks truth to power.

940407585605287938 2017-12-11 02:26:54 UTC <dominionofme> @FacesOpioids @ericmst Saw someone. Got a journal and a daily planner. I kept putting my thoughts onto paper at night or in the morning after a dream. (had endless nightmares at first). I assigned an activity each day before or after work, sometimes both. Its a fight you take a day at a time.
940366720912515074 2017-12-11 23:44:32 UTC <dominionofme> @subscribetowapo Lol you all still think WaPo is credible? Who pays to read propaganda?

940335034241830913 2017-12-11 21:38:37 UTC <dominionofme> @EricBoehlert Hunch: You live in an echo chamber of depressed, obsessed, and ignorant people.
940334830297821184 2017-12-11 21:37:48 UTC <dominionofme> @axios @keithandreen Are you really this dense? Get out of your echo chamber.. The propaganda piled into the TV screen is why most people didnt even vote in 2016.
940333665485230081 2017-12-11 21:33:11 UTC <dominionofme> @PressSec @WhiteHouse @dcexaminer @mmbarricelli Its not just the WH honey. Its millions upon millions upon millions of us who discredit CNN, WaPo, FN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, NBC, NYT, Time, and this list goes on and on and on... If you havent figured out most people who vote dont listen to these journalist, you should get educated.

"What I am seeing is a hopeful persuasion to the population so they will be discouraged from voting for said candidate based on leftist echo chamber polling stations" But Im sure youll ignore the fact most people didnt even vote in 2016 because of guys like this.
940330563877179392 2017-12-11 21:20:51 UTC <dominionofme> @DemFromCT @CillizzaCNN @CatalogueDonald Lol pretty sure you just shut this guy up. Never even heard of him.
940330132673388544 2017-12-11 21:19:08 UTC <dominionofme> @CillizzaCNN Are you really this naive? So scary how disconnected you are from the masses.
940300141742972928 2017-12-11 19:19:58 UTC <dominionofme> @WajahatAli So are you saying that anyone who holds those occupations are possibly allah worshiping fanatics that might or might not blow themselves and everyone around them up in the name of their god? Or are you just another fanatics apologist? Cause the bad ones are happy you tweeted this
940296561648599040 2017-12-11 19:05:44 UTC <dominionofme> @nathanlean If this was a christian white man with a gun, you would be blaming all white people and those who defend gun ownership without hesitating so you and your echo chamber can go propagandize somewhere else. Muslims radical douchebags are praising your tweet right now. Uneducated dolt
940292763941302272 2017-12-11 18:50:39 UTC <dominionofme> @nathanlean @crouch01 @RealDavidTafoya Yes it was. Educate yourself. Things happened that shouldnt of by people who said they were a part of the crusades.. but the crusades stared because a Pope called for it after Muslims were laying conquest while murdering and raping innocent lives.
940254261333647362 2017-12-11 16:17:39 UTC <dominionofme> @EdKrassen @AndrewUTP @LDrakston Nope just places that have a majority of islamic nut cases.
940235409120022528 2017-12-11 15:02:44 UTC <dominionofme> @cbouzy So you want him to get along with North Korea but you want him to be hostile to Russia despite Obamas 8 years and getting caught on audio talking about helping Putin?
940231484698497025 2017-12-11 14:47:09 UTC <dominionofme> @writetovoice If this was a christian and he used a gun, everyone knows you and your echo chamber would react differently.
940228403587944449 2017-12-11 14:34:54 UTC <dominionofme> @writetovoice Nah we just hate all religious fanatics and usually Islamic nuts are the only ones with bombs strapped to their bodies if not their childrens.
940227836803198978 2017-12-11 14:32:39 UTC <dominionofme> @AdamParkhomenko (Put on tin foil hat) Ya! I speak Russian too, that means I work for Putin right? Oh ya! And Roy Moore is a reptilian. Russia is controlled by lizard people and the only way to stop them is to find the unicorns at the end of every rainbow!
940227461891219456 2017-12-11 14:31:10 UTC <dominionofme> @franklyaya Probably because it sucked. Dont believe every "rotten tomatoes" score.
940227120630063104 2017-12-11 14:29:48 UTC <dominionofme> @finneyk @KimLeekwan "you can keep your doctor" lmfao... ya all the good things.
940226809651658753 2017-12-11 14:28:34 UTC <dominionofme> @finneyk Dared to push the envelope by telling people she was shot at by snipers in Bosnia when in reality she was greeted by 12 yr olds? How about the womans word of Cathy O'Brian. She says Hillary raped her when she was child... guess her and Roy Moore are more alike that most think.
940225644532772864 2017-12-11 14:23:56 UTC <dominionofme> @kylebuchanan Get Out was a shitty movie kiddo.
940225499669913600 2017-12-11 14:23:22 UTC <dominionofme> @ira That movie sucked.

We shoulnt be accepting the norm of, if you see someone getting bullied "you dont care cause who does right?" vs. "a human being trying to make another feel like a big deal" If you dont care you wouldnt of tweeted this projecting question.
939931315830427648 2017-12-10 18:54:23 UTC <dominionofme> @chelseahandler Did you ever figure out the difference between Genes and Jeans? No wonder people stopped watching your show.
939900636119945216 2017-12-10 16:52:28 UTC <dominionofme> @jordanbpeterson @surveilz @CameronFavell Yes. I watched a video where a chick also high and drunk filled with adrenaline crawled towards the cops... she didnt ignore the cops and put her hand near her belt line like a fool. Cops get guns pulled on them all the time and the officer thought he was going to get shot.
939897755312513025 2017-12-10 16:41:01 UTC <dominionofme> @jordanbpeterson @KENJEEZY85 @CameronFavell In most places in the world, they go easy on fanatics and crazies of all sorts which is why we hear about people being run over and concerts being shot up. Here, if a gunner is reported.. they dont put up with any bs. People, high or drunk or not.. pull guns on cops all the time.
939749235905482752 2017-12-09 06:50:52 UTC <dominionofme> @PoliticalKathy @chykendubuisi Low IQ troll.

Fox News is cancer, as well as CNN. Now do you feel better cupcake? Done projecting your own insecurities on others?
939550617097375745 2017-12-09 17:41:37 UTC <dominionofme> @jordanbpeterson @surveilz @siacr4t What you are talking about is much different than "many officers are just bloodthirsty" And yes, it is in a humans nature at times to be submissive, so is the act of being the dominant alpha. But a police officer takes on sacrifices that most people just cant comprehend.
939540004933722114 2017-12-09 16:59:27 UTC <dominionofme> @jordanbpeterson Just not true Dr Peterson. The cops are called about a gunman with a high powered rifle. All he had to do was crawl and not move his hands near his belt or anywhere out of site from the officers, he failed to do those actions and in fact made a move that would scare any person.
939537689292034050 2017-12-09 16:50:15 UTC <dominionofme> @MattWalshBlog @Bryan_Mills_ @FmnJohn As you expected? Or as you antagonized....? No one said anything about color until your stupid comment. Listen to the facts @bryan_mills_ is presenting to you and consider a police officer must assume people are dangerous when a call about a gunner is relevant.

Have you trained as a cop? Have you seen how many times someone fakes some tears just to have deceitful intent? The guy did not follow the instruction of the officer and if he had, he'd still be alive.
939516219220164608 2017-12-09 15:24:56 UTC <dominionofme> @CNN @iowa_trump @TheirSharona1 LOL "cnn doesnt mislead people intentionally..." HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Thats rich.

And you wonder why no one trust you or cares what you have to say.

939168927216697344 2017-12-08 16:24:55 UTC <dominionofme> @RealMattCouch @dodgegrrl @Raider_Glace So wikileaks put out damaging informaton on Russias government to cover up their bias? Lol you conspiracy theorist are hilarious, but whatever helps you and your low IQ sleep at night cupcake!

939157927902007296 2017-12-08 15:41:13 UTC <dominionofme> @krassenstein @frozensun11 Russia is not working with wikileaks. Why would they distribute damaging information against themselves? When they get information wrong Ill be skeptical of them. But until then, they are the most honest information outlet there is at the moment. I know the truth hurts.

939152972210233344 2017-12-08 15:21:31 UTC <dominionofme> @julianrouth I dont think you get that millions of us dont care. Information is for sale. WL constantly exposes corruption from Russia to the U.S. They are the only outlet of information thats never gotten a story wrong. Now put on your tin foil hat & tell me Russia works with them or w/e
939149977426817024 2017-12-08 15:09:37 UTC <dominionofme> @NolteNC @newbasscity Are you ready for the answer you dont want to accept? The CIA is more powerful than the President.
939148445499252736 2017-12-08 15:03:32 UTC <dominionofme> @RealMattCouch @dodgegrrl What is it that he and the millions of us dont get? To engage in this discussion you have to acknowledge two facts.  1. Wikileaks has never gotten information wrong  2. Russia is not working with wikileaks  But I'm willing to bet you'd believe a Clinton over that.
939144026564984832 2017-12-08 14:45:59 UTC <dominionofme> @krassenstein @frozensun11 Im not a Trump supporter and what good is talking to you? You and your tin foil hat are convinced that Russia and Wikileaks are working together lmfao... If you dont care about candidates colluding with places like CNN.. Why should anyone care if a nonprofit helped Trump?
939143265101676545 2017-12-08 14:42:57 UTC <dominionofme> @karensue61 @krassenstein Did you know wikileaks is the only information outlet thus far that has never gotten anything wrong?

939142299291979777 2017-12-08 14:39:07 UTC <dominionofme> @krassenstein When Wikileaks is the only outlet of information that has a 100% accuracy track record.. I just dont care about your tin foil hat conspiracy theories.
939136888241352704 2017-12-08 14:17:37 UTC <dominionofme> @POTUS @tedlieu ll put on my tin foil hat and believe you when you provide a source that has 11+ years of 100% irrefutable information. Now run back to your echo chamber and polarize something else douchebag. Stop pretending the DNC is this innocent angel. Youll contribute to Trumps re-election.
938896642664816641 2017-12-07 22:22:58 UTC <dominionofme> @kylegriffin1 No one cares lmfao... This is news because this echo chamber and their precious "news" outlets said so. When are you people going to start talking about actual problems. Actual news?

938513987905441792 2017-12-06 21:02:26 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @Omar_Gaza Hows Palestine and their incest problem going?
938459711590092801 2017-12-06 17:26:45 UTC <dominionofme> @SenKamalaHarris @NonaHorn @RangerDharma @Str84NOH8 He wants us to pay with our tax dollars to verify if hes the shitty person reaching for women while they sleep that he doesnt want to acknowledge? No point in spending resources on what we all know. Franken is a sexual predator & a sick adolescent man. Lets not waste money on it
938458968116154368 2017-12-06 17:23:48 UTC <dominionofme> @SenKamalaHarris Hillary Clinton still stands accused of raping Cathy O'Brien. I believe its the best thing for everyone if we drop affiliation with both of these parties and form a new one where this stuff is clearly not tolerated by any means.
938451541974974474 2017-12-06 16:54:17 UTC <dominionofme> @NewWorldHominin I believe someone was trying to make an example of you. Maybe someone did express discomfort to them, without the intent for a formal complaint. Meaning its not far fetched that this was never about you, only the critical thought, theories and perspective of Dr. Peterson in class
938303464643481600 2017-12-05 07:05:53 UTC <dominionofme> @FBI @jaketapper @SallyQYates @randalladams @Regina_Kyle1 @Mo_midwestgirl @GrayDawn3 Now watch him contradict himself and you not care because she wasnt "under oath"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/07/rep-trey-gowdy-rips-into-fbi-director-james-comey-on-hillary-clintons-intent.html
938301074229923841 2017-12-05 06:56:23 UTC <dominionofme> @FBI @jaketapper @SallyQYates @randalladams @Regina_Kyle1 @Mo_midwestgirl @weightloss_ASAP No. She broke many laws that others have paid for. 18 USC 793, 18 USC 1924, 18 USC 798 & 18 USC 2071. She made claims, HER WORDS and those claims were checked & Comey himself admitted she lied. Please educate yourself. Dont believe everything you read https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/07/rep-trey-gowdy-rips-into-fbi-director-james-comey-on-hillary-clintons-intent.html
938295764903710721 2017-12-05 06:35:17 UTC <dominionofme> @SallyQYates @TheOfficialPORP @americasloss Lol I love how angry people are in these comments. Quality internet content.
938294704881446913 2017-12-05 06:31:04 UTC <dominionofme> @SallyQYates Warning! You need a tin foil hat and bereft sense of law to understand the angry leftist echo chamber below. Good luck if you choose to scroll down.
938190910940237824 2017-12-05 23:38:38 UTC <dominionofme> @lsarsour @gmosesl @The_Initiation She never even went to court you poor uneducated thing. Here you go 18 USC 793, 18 USC 1924, 18 USC 798 and 18 USC 2071 these are the laws she broke in just one instance of an ungoverned server.
938135255357313024 2017-12-05 19:57:29 UTC <dominionofme> @seymourdon @NewWorldHominin @k_delamont Cant imagine if we didnt have brave enough individuals like her willing to expose fascistic and counterproductive critical thinking thats going on rampantly in Universities at the moment.
938119813041393665 2017-12-05 18:56:07 UTC <dominionofme> @YeyoZa @GeorgeJNasr Thats really my point only on a more significant scale for the sake of coexisting without planting the thought in anyones mind that "this person is a white person" hopefully to change it to.. "this person, who happens to be white..." as it would be more effective in socializing.
938113271235862528 2017-12-05 18:30:07 UTC <dominionofme> @YeyoZa @GeorgeJNasr A proxy sir. A figure representative to a value of something by calculating. Undefined. You have the burden of telling me why being classified as a certain race matters. Why can we not just say to the doctor, "This persons biology is different because.." leaving race out of it.
938108201832198145 2017-12-05 18:09:59 UTC <dominionofme> @YeyoZa @GeorgeJNasr Taxonomy is still methods & arrangements in defining & naming groups of biological organisms. That doesnt counter that we are made up of one race. We are a singularity unlike anything else known to life & as we move past prejudices a plural sense of race is divisive and harmful.
938095655331000320 2017-12-05 17:20:07 UTC <dominionofme> #HandsOffMyBC How about women start changing the culture of believing that sex is this pointless thing that doesnt have consequences and stop pretending that you care about your health when all you care about is sex with no strings attached.
938090608396259330 2017-12-05 17:00:04 UTC <dominionofme> @MSNBC @maddow @SRuhle @JoyAnnReid @TeriannMann Lol you said honest women and then put Joy Reid in there.. lol... the irony.
938076727280066569 2017-12-05 16:04:55 UTC <dominionofme> @YeyoZa @GeorgeJNasr In simpler terms. Most people are coming to the realization that we are not races of peoples, but in fact the human race and character is more representation of a person than their skin tone.
938076051426762754 2017-12-05 16:02:13 UTC <dominionofme> @YeyoZa @GeorgeJNasr As humankind progresses the general consensus is that everyone is in fact equals and "race" at this point is a pointless theme that divides and hinders our progression based on arguments about pride or vindictiveness from the actions of a class of people that no longer exist.
938063471580770304 2017-12-05 15:12:14 UTC <dominionofme> @YeyoZa @GeorgeJNasr Race and dividing people up by the hue of their skin IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT. We humankind have progressed to the point that race isnt even a true depiction of peoples differences. In fact even acknowledging such a social fabric points to an inner need for race so you may be racist
938056472344383500 2017-12-05 14:44:25 UTC <dominionofme> @UpTarget He pulled his son because hes passive aggressive. Hates that this President free'd his son from a communist nutshell, and because UCLA has standards on adolescent theft... Hes acting out and spinning a cute story to deflect and dismiss the reality that he and his son are idiots.
938052131109658625 2017-12-05 14:27:10 UTC <dominionofme> @TxsleuthUSA Are you smoking crack @txleuthUSA?
938051875231944704 2017-12-05 14:26:09 UTC <dominionofme> @BillKristol So you decide what others believe? This is why I cant relate to modern Christianity & why I felt a need to disconnect myself from most Christians. You.. or me.. do not do the judging. You are part of the problem when you declare all knowingly who has faith or not. Its sad Bill.
938049428434444288 2017-12-05 14:16:26 UTC <dominionofme> @EdKrassen BREAKING: Youre obsessed with twitter and Donald Trump. And you are actually part of the problem when it comes to Trumps and Hillarys scheming through our elections without an inch of respect for the process.
938048759581339648 2017-12-05 14:13:47 UTC <dominionofme> @nytimes @ReasonOnFaith I think those on the far left would call this racist or somethin? Pretty sure thats how this works.
937926094870675456 2017-12-04 06:06:21 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @ForeignPolicy Far leftist angry about a presidents retweets... And you wonder how could the U.S. allow a spray tan lying douche and a pathological lying sociopath as the only two choices. Fuck the ongoing division spread by media outlets and echo chambers like this.
937888498698289157 2017-12-04 03:36:57 UTC <dominionofme> @TIME @BadCarbNoDonut @julianasuprstar Go lie down and relax angry little child. Your rage is visible through twitter comments.
937887228948353024 2017-12-04 03:31:55 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro Ive always felt like it would be ants. Damn hive minded organisms building bridges of themselves to cross water and stuff.
937886525165010944 2017-12-04 03:29:07 UTC <dominionofme> @Tom_Winter (Puts on tin foil hat) Ok.. so... Lizard People. Reptilian Humans. Russians. Trump. Unicorns. but waaaaah "my putin!" Ok. Done. We democrats are all on the same page. Over and out. Oh and... Chem trails. Putin hired Trump to go back in time and assassinate JFK. Over and out again
937885639693012992 2017-12-04 03:25:36 UTC <dominionofme> @NancyPelosi @FoxBusiness Why does she have this creepy smiling shes either displaying or straining to withhold? Who put this crazy women in power?
937764305721810945 2017-12-04 19:23:27 UTC <dominionofme> @thistallawkgirl Look how much you're helping! You arent apart of the problem at all! Do you even care that this sort of belligerent adolescence is complicit to Trump winning again in 2020?
937752891582025728 2017-12-04 18:38:06 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @LiveFromTheDen Keep fighting the good fight. We live in a growing order of "Guilty until proven innocent" & if you say one bad thing about someone, somehow that means you support its opposition. No reason to stop speaking truth to power though.
937741864857489408 2017-12-04 17:54:17 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @LiveFromTheDen I wish everyone would acknowledge that. Apparently if youre Donald Trump exposing that reality it doesnt count. Sick world we are livin in.
937741210319499265 2017-12-04 17:51:41 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @UniteAlbertans This is a testament to how ignorant and belligerent the far left is
937741078991659008 2017-12-04 17:51:10 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @UniteAlbertans Ya except that was debunked and comey was fired for good reason.https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/07/rep-trey-gowdy-rips-into-fbi-director-james-comey-on-hillary-clintons-intent.html
937738250080391168 2017-12-04 17:39:55 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @LiveFromTheDen She lied a lot more than that. https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/07/rep-trey-gowdy-rips-into-fbi-director-james-comey-on-hillary-clintons-intent.html
937738114650525696 2017-12-04 17:39:23 UTC <dominionofme> @JuddLegum @Woodyman502 Let me help you.  https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/07/rep-trey-gowdy-rips-into-fbi-director-james-comey-on-hillary-clintons-intent.html
937737998375976960 2017-12-04 17:38:55 UTC <dominionofme> @JuddLegum What the fuck is wrong with you people? She did lie... multiple times. Dont dismiss that because you dont like the person telling you about the reality of it. You will help him get relected with such ignorance. https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/07/rep-trey-gowdy-rips-into-fbi-director-james-comey-on-hillary-clintons-intent.html
937737710843854849 2017-12-04 17:37:47 UTC <dominionofme> @WJYZ Yes she did. She even lied about getting shot at when first lady fro some reason. Nothin really explains a pathological lying sociopath like this. https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/07/rep-trey-gowdy-rips-into-fbi-director-james-comey-on-hillary-clintons-intent.html
937737504056332289 2017-12-04 17:36:57 UTC <dominionofme> @mimi424 This pathological liar claim shes been shot at by bosnian snipers again? lmfao... Ya a real winner.
937736525156057093 2017-12-04 17:33:04 UTC <dominionofme> @ryanstruyk Here. You are severely uneducated on the topic at hand. Please dont dismiss and ignore the many lies in just one case that she made. https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/07/rep-trey-gowdy-rips-into-fbi-director-james-comey-on-hillary-clintons-intent.html
937734843462488065 2017-12-04 17:26:23 UTC <dominionofme> @Acosta Comey protected her despite her passive aggressively attacking Comey after the election. Shes still an influence and she still lied to the FBI countless times in only one case. If you want to dismiss that because Trump said something.. youre apart of the problem.
937731334218317824 2017-12-04 17:12:26 UTC <dominionofme> @altNOAA One of the reasons I liked FL is there is a good solid mix of people with all kinds of political affiliation. Hoping a state goes "blue" by using victims to vote against their interest isnt all surprising coming from far left extremist outlets.
937715406772559874 2017-12-04 16:09:09 UTC <dominionofme> @SenatorDurbin @ArLHeureux When atheist are showing up to las vegas events and gunning down countless people, and other atheist are showing up to christian churches and shooting little kids down.... ya Some actual christian modern values arent the worst thing compared to an huge illegal immigrant problem.
937691499462103040 2017-12-04 14:34:09 UTC <dominionofme> @BBC @RCorbettMEP Im content with listening to what Farage has to say, not you. Trump isnt a conservative. Hes a populist and if he supports the "far right" then I guess you support the far left and all the violence and indecency there.
937686679325937665 2017-12-04 14:15:00 UTC <dominionofme> @NatashaBertrand (Puts on tin foil hat) Ya! And Lizard people are working with Putin so Russia can take over the U.S. with rainbows and unicorns!
937484861597679616 2017-12-03 00:53:03 UTC <dominionofme> @Dreamweasel @Hiimalexok I dont think you know what irony means but sure thing chief. Good luck!
937457665978060800 2017-12-03 23:04:59 UTC <dominionofme> @Dreamweasel @Hiimalexok Funny thing is, I never defended Trump yet you jumped to the conclusion to that because I brought up other influential puppets. Some advice? Dont project, deflect, dismiss and ignorantly assume when someone points out a general issue such as standards for a President.
937449054434447360 2017-12-03 22:30:46 UTC <dominionofme> @Dreamweasel @Hiimalexok There is no strategy sparky. Stick to meme posting when people say things that hurt your uneducated sense of reality.
937432984881418240 2017-12-03 21:26:54 UTC <dominionofme> @Dreamweasel @Hiimalexok Whatever helps you and your low IQ sleep at night cupcake. I dont support Trump. But if I was a lawyer he would indeed be easier to defend than those two cock roaches.
937352289374953472 2017-12-03 16:06:15 UTC <dominionofme> @RickBasini New leftist ideology: Guilty until proven innocent. What is wrong with the world?
937350532355776517 2017-12-03 15:59:16 UTC <dominionofme> @Dreamweasel Theres always one uneducated dolt trying to make something about politics. Did Obama ever admit to being wrong when he lied to millions about being able to keep their doctor? Just one of the things he was wrong about too... its a long list.
937344589161222144 2017-12-03 15:35:39 UTC <dominionofme> @chelseahandler Stick to talking to your echo chamber about kittens or moving out of the country. Did you ever figure out the difference between Genes and Jeans? Most politics goes over your head sweetheart. Its why people stopped watching your show, too much nonsense you arent educated on.
937193247549673472 2017-12-02 05:34:17 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @ShafPatel @AlexKnows__Best @Dandelionabbey Like Mayor Ed Murray? Anthony Weiner? Jacob Schwartz? Robert Menendez? Lots of people have molested children. In fact, Hillary Clinton stands accused of raping a young girl but she works close with news outlets and people like Harvey Weistein that help protect her. Now run along!
937185713002565632 2017-12-02 05:04:20 UTC <dominionofme> @MattWalshBlog @iammrsundastood So lets all educate ourselves on how raise proper children, be decent people... unlike the guys father. Own a gun to defend ourselves and the innocent around us. Respect the nature of the gun, and hopefully have the courage to be able to stop "mental illness" like this sooner.
937101709494640645 2017-12-02 23:30:32 UTC <dominionofme> @skolanach @JoyAnnReid This is her ugly ass lookin expression when someone correctly predicted the Trumps presidency lmfao...pic.twitter.com/8M21SG49sq
936759654272634885 2017-12-01 00:51:20 UTC <dominionofme> @JRubinBlogger @AmyDoghouse Shouldnt our lack of confidence be in media and candidate relations as of now? Confidence in whether California and New York are making good policy decisions for everyone else is just sick to think of. Thankfully we have the American Political Science today.
936669646002024449 2017-12-01 18:53:40 UTC <dominionofme> @Boogie2988 @loofemmaps Ill take that over some asshole telling me I MUST choose a side.
936668549451575297 2017-12-01 18:49:19 UTC <dominionofme> @Benaskren @benshapiro @joerogan @DiploSport @BURDA13 @kcargen His podcast is his own platform. He can be a comedian, a pessimist, an orthodox jew, a devils advocate or whatever else he wants to be. As a guest, I would expect him to apply formality to his context and leave the "oppressive jokes" at the door because of the room for debate.
936667677011206145 2017-12-01 18:45:51 UTC <dominionofme> @kylegriffin1 Let me get this straight. You are all happy he got caught lying to the FBI, but dead silent on how many times she lied to the FBI about her privately governed server? You hypocritical trolls dont care about democracy anymore than a Trump supporter.
936664612539211776 2017-12-01 18:33:40 UTC <dominionofme> @JaneGoodallInst @RichardDawkins @nytopinion Like China and their voice on pollution? Like Stalin and his communistic testing and the voices left over from that experiment? How angry does it make you that American Politic Science is the most decent and good attempt at democracy and unity of peoples yet?
936660868686909440 2017-12-01 18:18:48 UTC <dominionofme> @PrisonPlanet @QuarryAli What are you mad? Stick to your own politics cupcake. I don't hear you asking about how the other candidate lied on 11 different issues on an illegally setup government server ALONE that may have leaked national intelligence to Russians.
936642252159545344 2017-12-01 17:04:49 UTC <dominionofme> @MackLamoureux I'm more worried about the far left. "The resistance" or whatever have bigger numbers and even bigger numbers are apologizing and enabling the empty revolution they think they are spearheading.
936640443235885056 2017-12-01 16:57:38 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @bradcadwallader @ninrew You mean in places like Chicago where gun laws are among the most strict and the gang culture is rampant and complicit to those "killed americans" you pretend to care about.
936636410005684226 2017-12-01 16:41:36 UTC <dominionofme> @JackPosobiec @Martyz6 Honest and worthy question. Kinda like... why did Hillary lie by omission when required to disclose millions of dollars from foreign bodies?
936635940491223040 2017-12-01 16:39:44 UTC <dominionofme> @JackPosobiec I think "lying" to the FBI about the conversations with ambassadors is criminal, unless youre Hillary Clinton lying to the FBI and youre talking about the possibility of other countries getting information from her unlawful servers. Bizarre world we are living in.
936628462634328064 2017-12-01 16:10:01 UTC <dominionofme> @YMBBastepaway @sheltielove @_Atilius_ Ya funny how the more strict your gun laws are the worse gun violence tends to be. Its almost as if the culture doesnt respect owning a firearm, any more than they do for laws.
936619251326181381 2017-12-01 15:33:25 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @Zainiac1 Speaking of Presidents. Happy shes not.
936611198879100928 2017-12-01 15:01:25 UTC <dominionofme> @olympicchannel @paulrbrian @NicSpurling I dont think he would care if you called him a he or she... its a biological fact that he is a he, and the Olympian is a he. There are studies that suggest these pronouns provide NO QUALITY of life.. in fact.. it further confuses them into the suicidal tendencies. Do research!
936607396247539714 2017-12-01 14:46:19 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @ShesGotMoxieLMH Ya, look away and ignore the fact that if we actually used our immigration laws Kate would still be alive today.
936598249292648450 2017-12-01 14:09:58 UTC <dominionofme> @YMBBastepaway @_Atilius_ @sheltielove Yes they are cupcake. But whatever helps you sleep at night.
936464995998724096 2017-11-30 05:20:28 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl @AndyMilder Whatever helps you sleep at night cupcake. Im sure youre the life of parties yourself.
936299327563157505 2017-11-30 18:22:09 UTC <dominionofme> @PrisonPlanet @1791L I think much of the political divide we see today is because of this inner need to group and label people, as well as for some... to seek a certain label for the sake of opportunity, or looking out for the surrounding population.
936270090781282304 2017-11-30 16:25:59 UTC <dominionofme> @peterbakernyt @maggieNYT @yashar Great.... another Goldman Sachs goon as a CIA director.
936269278197813250 2017-11-30 16:22:45 UTC <dominionofme> @KindHealth Thats because the ACA can f itself for all we care. Less than 12% of the population is using this unsupported nonsense. Thankfully 16 years of closet fascist socialist nuts running things is over.
936267823596429312 2017-11-30 16:16:58 UTC <dominionofme> @NolteNC @andrewklavan @RicChciuk Sure thing troll!
936267119032971264 2017-11-30 16:14:10 UTC <dominionofme> @Newsweek Ya sure sure sure... oh by the way. Youre foaming at the mouth. Whoever runs this account should probably lie down for a little while.

936262637565960194 2017-11-30 15:56:22 UTC <dominionofme> @MattWalshBlog The accounts of those who actually engaged with the shooter changed, but the main story was always about "gun control" after he committed the massacre. And people wonder why conspiracy theories come about.
936254865398956033 2017-11-30 15:25:29 UTC <dominionofme> @RubinReport As long as you dont make a white t-shirt. No one will be "offended"
936248850477649920 2017-11-30 15:01:35 UTC <dominionofme> @ikhras so... complete unorganized, corrupt tyrants are still killing eachother while you blame the Jews for everything?
936248170945875968 2017-11-30 14:58:53 UTC <dominionofme> @ThylacineReport You poor sweet little ironically uneducated thing... Peterson is just too smart for a person like yourself cupcake.
936232015925477382 2017-11-30 13:54:41 UTC <dominionofme> @Imamofpeace @big_G7 Not just americans.. many many many people dont like this Sharia Law advocate.
936136824229191681 2017-11-29 07:36:26 UTC <dominionofme> @Ira_Wells @nfranklin1992 Careful. You might be abusing him with that sort of talk, according to this guy.
936136089617747969 2017-11-29 07:33:30 UTC <dominionofme> @jonkay @RubinReport @Ira_Wells @jordanbpeterson Is anyone really surprised this asshole backed out of the opportunity? I guarantee he actually did a shred of research and found so many walls he would of ran into with Peterson, he was smart enough not to humiliate himself.. "abuse..." lol give me a break.

935928521301549056 2017-11-29 17:48:42 UTC <dominionofme> @NewWorldHominin @Reddishpilz Its not just leftist though. I think the labels and grouping is where a lot of this politic divide starts.
935927655853166593 2017-11-29 17:45:16 UTC <dominionofme> @NewWorldHominin As a businessman and someone who doesnt mind supporting you for the backwardness you endured. I would happily testify to the incompetence and belligerence of such received defamation.
935912365597618176 2017-11-29 16:44:31 UTC <dominionofme> @Atrios @SamSeder @JoeSPalmer I dont think he seems that way cupcake.
935911879129608193 2017-11-29 16:42:35 UTC <dominionofme> @Atrios @SamSeder @JoeSPalmer @TubbinsRuxpin You sure about that? After all, he is a leftist leaning adolescent.
935884126472765440 2017-11-29 14:52:18 UTC <dominionofme> @washingtonpost @JamesOKeefeIII @dagannon @RWNJsCanFO You think WaPo has never lied about sensitive realities? What youre saying is truthphobia or something. You want to say everything is a lie after one lie because you dont want to hear the truth. So if WaPo lies about anything are you going to condemn them in the same fashion?
935882098925293568 2017-11-29 14:44:14 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @EdKrassen Youre obsessed cupcake.
935880630424031233 2017-11-29 14:38:24 UTC <dominionofme> @washingtonpost @JamesOKeefeIII @dagannon When youre interviewing "prestigious" WaPo reporters and they are panicking so bad that they forget which car is theirs.... I'd say its worth taking seriously.
935880318514597888 2017-11-29 14:37:10 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @JaydaBF @GregShugar So anytime anyone points to a criminal doing something incriminating... its some sort of sign of hatred? Get a paper towel. Youre foaming at the mouth. Now continue ignoring whats in the video.
935878570286739456 2017-11-29 14:30:13 UTC <dominionofme> @washingtonpost @JamesOKeefeIII @dagannon I think the point is that he exposed multiple times that WaPo does hit pieces knowing they arent true about Russia and a U.S. president. Stop pretending that James is the first journalist that uses lies to uncover significant truths.
935877416890830850 2017-11-29 14:25:38 UTC <dominionofme> @washingtonpost @JamesOKeefeIII @A_Smart_Liberal Do you really think WaPo has never lied or posed as a victim of something somehow to get a hit piece rolling through the echo chambers?
935776592995016705 2017-11-28 07:45:00 UTC <dominionofme> @GerryCallahan @Timcast @fezug Your sensitivity brought you here cupcake.
935748209716187137 2017-11-28 05:52:13 UTC <dominionofme> @JoynerLucas @OfficialQadri Too f'n real for you?
935737835860189184 2017-11-28 05:10:59 UTC <dominionofme> @jordanbpeterson Ya this sort of nonsense doesnt deserve a response. Keep up your good work Dr Peterson.
935736710553657344 2017-11-28 05:06:31 UTC <dominionofme> @washingtonpost @JamesOKeefeIII @georgeingmire @ripcitybeez Youre as in "you are" is the word you are looking for. "Your" is used for the premise of possession. For example I would of said to the WaPo nobody. "Thats not your car". Hope this helps.
935717260064325632 2017-11-28 03:49:14 UTC <dominionofme> @washingtonpost @JamesOKeefeIII @RogueSNRadvisor You sound mad.
935717172105633792 2017-11-28 03:48:53 UTC <dominionofme> @washingtonpost @JamesOKeefeIII @georgeingmire Idk... if he causes someone to panic so bad during exposure that they forget which car is theirs.. it has plenty of meaning to me.
935686102245048320 2017-11-28 01:45:25 UTC <dominionofme> @MrDane1982 @TheCentryst HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.... sorry.. thats just too rich of a joke.
935589436716445698 2017-11-28 19:21:18 UTC <dominionofme> @JamesOKeefeIII @JoeMuto @TheLoveBel0w The idiot was so scared of O'Keefe he went to the wrong car lol... funny af.
935588077069848576 2017-11-28 19:15:54 UTC <dominionofme> @jordanbpeterson @Greg_Tolan I think his intellectual dishonesty would spew out something like "I can be santa claus if I want to be, and dont refer to my version of santa claus as a he"
935582811104403456 2017-11-28 18:54:59 UTC <dominionofme> @RubinReport @Bigg_Jus Right? Christ... I think we all watch Dave for the very reason of how we cant stand that sort of demeanor in every day life. Like you said. Id just walk away so I wouldnt have to hear it.
935580967011528704 2017-11-28 18:47:39 UTC <dominionofme> @RubinReport @Bigg_Jus Ya I watched about 5 minutes of the last one, skimmed on hoping it would lighten up and come to find out it got so so so much worse. Poor Rubin. Feel bad for him having to try and moderate that.
935578197449760770 2017-11-28 18:36:39 UTC <dominionofme> @jordanbpeterson @arewhyaeenn Labels and groups. Its the irony of how they argue today.
935577561761042432 2017-11-28 18:34:07 UTC <dominionofme> @RubinReport @Bigg_Jus Given the circumstances, the people, and the differences. I think youre smart enough to know it wont be. Peterson has too much respect for the art of debate to even let it get anything close to toxic, despite the toxicity that the other guy would spew out lmfao.
935577097376092166 2017-11-28 18:32:16 UTC <dominionofme> @RubinReport I doubt the uneducated fella who tried to blast Peterson as some sort of alt right motivator will have the courage to attempt to debate him.
935574266694823936 2017-11-28 18:21:01 UTC <dominionofme> @NFL @VP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @krassenstein @ManlikeGrimm @MoPalmer4 @ChangeTheLAUSD The flag doesnt just fit into the tightly nit symbols that you put forth. I was brought up in a military family and burning the flag is in fact a direct insult to those who died for it. Grow up. I feel bad for your kids having to witness a folded flag burn for no real reason.
935530060924248069 2017-11-28 15:25:22 UTC <dominionofme> @kira__williams So how do you teach Trans people to debate these beliefs if you just sensor everything just for them to walk into the real world with such a predictably unprepared perspective?
935529588670783488 2017-11-28 15:23:29 UTC <dominionofme> @spaikin @TheAgenda @NewWorldHominin I wouldnt even respond to this adolescence. You dont have to defend yourself against such nonsensical bullshit.
935511845586243586 2017-11-28 14:12:59 UTC <dominionofme> @walrusmagazine @Ira_Wells "intellectual guru of the alt-right".... lol I love your over dramatic belligerence. The guy is a centrist at the most or least. "strategy of enforced disengagement".... Let me simplify your stupidity. Thats called ignorance. Its ok though, stick to writing for thewalrus.ca lmao
935506153672527878 2017-11-28 13:50:22 UTC <dominionofme> @FederalistPitch @edgeoforever @domusvita Ya well... without that right people I love that are close to me would be dead. Without that right, the guy shooting up a church could of killed even more people, but someone with a more powerful rifle was luckily there to put that piece of shit down. Ya real obsessed people.

935283821582389248 2017-11-27 23:06:54 UTC <dominionofme> @JamesOKeefeIII @AGsmith70 Did they practice good journalism when they colluded with nationally "elected" candidates and fed them questions to our Presidential debate?
935283285202210817 2017-11-27 23:04:46 UTC <dominionofme> @JamesOKeefeIII @RossMcCaff After the guy bails on the interview and sticks to his soul agenda of deflecting by calling out that they got caught trying to expose WaPo for the corrupt pile of tyrannical capitalistic pile of garbage it is? Its a blow, but not a loss cupcake.
935282166006730758 2017-11-27 23:00:19 UTC <dominionofme> @washingtonpost @Project_Veritas @JBomb11 @jply31 A lie is a lie is it not? I thought thats what we were talking about. Ya... im talkin about your deflection.
935277881156145152 2017-11-27 22:43:18 UTC <dominionofme> @washingtonpost @bethreinhard The people you work for handed over debate questions to a pathological lying sociopath posing as "the first women President".   James getting caught is funny, But the aforementioned is more damaging and humiliating than anything James-y boi could produce.
935276430581215233 2017-11-27 22:37:32 UTC <dominionofme> @MackLamoureux Realistically, its actually just funny. Im interested in what their side of the story is. If you care about the humiliation of some insignificant Project Veratis group.. we should all take a step back and remember these corporations fed debate questions to Hillary.
935275302422491136 2017-11-27 22:33:03 UTC <dominionofme> @byaaroncdavis Fake news vs real news using fake news antics? Quick! Deflect, Dismiss and ignore the reality of which your "news" outlet is colluding and undermining how we elect people at all. Stick to filibustering sweetheart.
935273672364969984 2017-11-27 22:26:34 UTC <dominionofme> @washingtonpost @Project_Veritas @JBomb11 @jply31 I read the article sparky. Since you find lies so humiliating and we share that common ground. Watch a short clip of the pathological lying sociopath get debunked on more than just some insignificant hit piece on WaPo.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNjXgP0lH3s
935271013272743936 2017-11-27 22:16:00 UTC <dominionofme> @washingtonpost @Project_Veritas @JBomb11 Whatever helps you and your low IQ sleep at night cupcake. I'm not even defending them. I just think your ignorance to ironic issues that actually require your special tin foil hat for Russians and WMDs is telling to why we have that idiot with an orange spray tan in office.
935269455231377410 2017-11-27 22:09:49 UTC <dominionofme> @washingtonpost @Project_Veritas @JBomb11 @jply31 People lie since WHEN!? At least they arent a Presidential candidate for the United States colluding with tyrannically capitalistic "news" outlets like WaPo instead of just studying and impressing citizens with a truthful approach. Hurry! Deflect, Project, Dismiss!
935267240089440257 2017-11-27 22:01:01 UTC <dominionofme> @washingtonpost @Project_Veritas @JBomb11 When WaPo & other outlets are feeding candidates questions before the PRESIDENTIAL debates (Insert your bland, pathetic, ignorantly dismissive excuse for her here ____,) I think the corrupt tactics @project_veritas exposes & uses against the current establishments is pure gold.pic.twitter.com/BcNHnB4kWe
935228608393699329 2017-11-27 19:27:30 UTC <dominionofme> @FederalistPitch @edgeoforever @domusvita If the U.S. gov ever became the tyrannical force that many exaggerate it to be today, millions of military personnel would unite and F-35s would be dealt with accordingly. They only have so many flares and do very little damage to land masses. Its a plane meant for dog fights.
935216308773367808 2017-11-27 18:38:38 UTC <dominionofme> @AskelBen @funder No shit the bar is lowered, over 60 million nuts actually voted for the pathological lying puppet, Hillary. Can you stop contradicting yourself about whats being "publicized"? Can we not all work together to stop capitalistic "news" corps from promoting Trumps & Clintons? Please?
935214745963126784 2017-11-27 18:32:25 UTC <dominionofme> @funder Youre equating completely different cases ironically. Show me a picture of Trump doing what he said hes done. Show me how it wasnt consensual as he says it was. Now show me a picture of Franken doing something. Oh wait... that picture is all over the place and hes admitted to it.
935212368677699585 2017-11-27 18:22:58 UTC <dominionofme> @lsarsour @Kala712125351 @FCKTRUMF War there is for oil, influence, land & money. All these corrupt govs, including Bush & Obama WH... are complicit. We should unite as Americans despite this. It shows that the Repub and Democrat party arent what they were intended to be anymore. So why vote for Trump or Hillary?
935200549674373120 2017-11-27 17:36:00 UTC <dominionofme> @aamer_rahman Hes a comedian for a reason. Hes good at making people laugh. Policy though? How would going around punching people with bad ideas be a good thing today? If you dont have the education & intellectual honesty to debate fascism... then you should educate yourself on how. Its easy.
935179813794525185 2017-11-27 16:13:37 UTC <dominionofme> @lsarsour @Kala712125351 @FCKTRUMF You judge ideas by their effects, whos been effected. "some of Its outdated" is not an excuse and comparing Sharia law and all its bloodshed in todays generations to a Jewish violence comparison is intellectually bankrupt and dishonest. Now rant about something America has done.
935156207375052800 2017-11-27 14:39:48 UTC <dominionofme> @Dnee_L Im sorry this happened to you. Disconnect yourself from him as best you can, but you should also consider disconnecting yourself from Linda Sarsour. Shes using you for twitter fame.. she actually defends the sickness of men like that in other countries.
935155638749093890 2017-11-27 14:37:33 UTC <dominionofme> @lsarsour @Kala712125351 @FCKTRUMF "shariah law is reasonable and once u read into the details it makes a lot of sense. People just know the basics" These are her words...  Just being stupid & uneducated enough to say "its reasonable" is plenty of advocacy. Sad thing is... this isnt the only time shes defended it
935054836600631296 2017-11-26 07:57:00 UTC <dominionofme> @nytopinion @lilredandy Broad strokes of judgement and stereotypes usually make any human being uncomfortable. How are we to progress by forcing the pendulum to swing the other way?
935053645112119296 2017-11-26 07:52:16 UTC <dominionofme> @nytopinion I hope someone didnt pay you to come up with this perplexing sack of regressive nonsense. Trust me, there wont be any rise of men with picket signs asking for hand outs that leftism would actually be stupid enough to indulge. You have some re-thinking you need to tend to though.

934830383262298114 2017-11-26 17:05:06 UTC <dominionofme> @krassenstein Anyone else notice whenever Trump or any republican is trending without a violent incident, its always the same people (echo chambers) making it trend? This guy Brian, some guy named "Ed" and another named "Kyle" or somethin. Lmfao... Twitter is so much smaller than you'd think.
934826018468188160 2017-11-26 16:47:45 UTC <dominionofme> @Laurier @mrakbarKW They can have as many PhD's as they want but this is just ignorant. This article is a blatant representation of a person thats used his "smarts" to stupefy himself. Peterson doesnt have "disdain" for a fucking pronoun, he just points out that it doesnt improve quality of life.
934491006564818946 2017-11-25 18:36:32 UTC <dominionofme> @NewWorldHominin Seems hilarious and fitting with a twitter name like "mouthygurl"
934227530965508097 2017-11-24 01:09:35 UTC <dominionofme> @Bill_Shea19 Heads up scrolling down. Another echo chamber of adolescent complainers that would still rather not talk about corp outlets like Time and Fox News ruining our unity as Americans so they dont even get a chance to install Trumps or Clintons that we as a whole, DO NOT WANT.
934186836737560576 2017-11-24 22:27:52 UTC <dominionofme> @BNelsob More than 200 too. Corp news outlets are on the hush hush about how this was a radical islam attack on what is probably peaceful muslims.
934186172666056706 2017-11-24 22:25:14 UTC <dominionofme> @BNelsob No one I know cares about this. This is trending because liberals and democrats are patting eachother on the back about 3 or 4 people who want this drama in their life. You liberals arent helping. Just let this stupid story go away like the Obamas. No one reasonable cares about'm
934135621324627968 2017-11-24 19:04:22 UTC <dominionofme> Wait... @ddale8 Are you angry that this was another Muslim attack or just mad that people are calling it what it is? Youre a troll, and I think youre human bigoted garbage. See how easy and counterproductive that is?
934132463881850881 2017-11-24 18:51:49 UTC <dominionofme> @PrisonPlanet Dont threatin. Just do the right thing and speak truth to power... Then grab your gun, these people are dangerous, evil, sociopaths that will kill to cover up their reality.
934129413670756358 2017-11-24 18:39:42 UTC <dominionofme> @bengoldacre You win troll of the day award! Congrats?
934129117452292096 2017-11-24 18:38:31 UTC <dominionofme> @HillaryClinton @FoxNews @JonDavidson_ @dbongino @wimakerns @Tarkeny A guy takes a job that requires him to literally sacrifice his life for these people and you think their dishonest about this."Its not a big deal to yell" So do you think its ok to throw things at people too? Or... You just pick and choose what you want to believe? Sound trollish
934127119080263680 2017-11-24 18:30:35 UTC <dominionofme> @JulianAssange Terrorism by definiton has political motive. Yes it was terrifying to witness and think about, but because of laws... you cant just say any attack is a terrorist attack. The egypt attack was organized by religious fanatics that want a certain set of policies that they dont have.
934126295209926656 2017-11-24 18:27:18 UTC <dominionofme> @HillaryClinton @FoxNews @JonDavidson_ @dbongino @wimakerns @Tarkeny You think SS dont talk to eachother? You naive enough to think that Dan Bongino is one of the only ones thats talked about Hillarys character? Other SS have talked about her yelling and throwing shit too. Do they need to be verified for your insecure perception?
934115242728181760 2017-11-24 17:43:23 UTC <dominionofme> @letsgetsomehits @ainsleyyy_b @gabra_cadabra So when women were attacked by Hillary Clinton for speaking out about Bills sexual harassment.. you say what... But Russia? But Donald and the audio on the bus? Grow the fuck up. Hillary was complicit because shes a puppet thats a pushover... not an independent person.
934113605565460481 2017-11-24 17:36:53 UTC <dominionofme> @ainsleyyy_b So Obamas kid is trending & all of these tweets about "right wingers" being offended.... but i dont see anything but liberals complaining about people being offended. Are you leftist just foaming at the mouth? Looking for a reason to stir some drama? No one cares about this chick
934099833811587072 2017-11-24 16:42:09 UTC <dominionofme> @thistallawkgirl Scroll down for endless tweets about "the right" and "right wingers"... I dont know anyone on the right that gives a shit about any of this. You leftist and Obama apologist are foaming at the mouth.
933519559524536320 2017-11-22 02:16:21 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro Good for these two women. Lets mop the floor with these pieces of crap.
933458617579302917 2017-11-22 22:14:11 UTC <dominionofme> @sethmeyers @THR Seth Meyers lol... who the fuck is this asshole anyway? Someone punch the guy that gave this moron a show. What happened to actual comedy?
933436474078396418 2017-11-22 20:46:12 UTC <dominionofme> @SomethingTexty There is a reason you write stories, and diplomats are diplomats. Not that I disagree the U.S. should still answer for injustice as anyone with common sense would, but the problem is... isnt it common sense to do something so those living under Kim can be as free as us?
933399808005558273 2017-11-22 18:20:30 UTC <dominionofme> @mccanner You work for a corporation that will conscientiously or sub conscientiously strive for ratings at the end of the day... not thorough truth.
933384863004184580 2017-11-22 17:21:07 UTC <dominionofme> @RubinReport @loreneshaw @ConceptHut Can you show me where she said she was "against" something? I know she said she disagrees with him on issues but I believe she was targeted because of her objectivity, which is indeed the purpose of critical thinking especially in a universities environment.
933379320768278528 2017-11-22 16:59:06 UTC <dominionofme> @BetteMidler @realmleez @ActressDebbie @cmlouwho1 @kiki405 So do we believe women that come forward after 40 years to accuse a person running for office in Alabama? What is wrong with you people? Why the hypocrisy with such layered ignorance and double standard? Sad.
933347961110716416 2017-11-22 14:54:29 UTC <dominionofme> @jenn_ruth Jeeeez. This tweet is passive aggressive as fuck.
933339597026873345 2017-11-22 14:21:15 UTC <dominionofme> PATREON: We SUPPORT Dr. Jordan B. Peterson - Sign the Petition! via @Change
933164549275926528 2017-11-21 02:45:40 UTC <dominionofme> @baddogs4343 Gary Busey has fake teeth because he lost part of his brain in an accident. Some would say your bereft sense of compassion and humor along with ironic sense of adolescence would explain why over 60 million people would vote for the other guys father.
933113617628717057 2017-11-21 23:23:17 UTC <dominionofme> @AndrewLawton @globalnews Ya at this point their apology is about as sincere as Harvey Weinstein's and his issue.  Universities have got to get a grip so they can stop producing such rejects.
933112655895715840 2017-11-21 23:19:28 UTC <dominionofme> Scroll down to watch @EmilyLindin project, deflect, dismiss, and through adolescence, ignore.
933055505177698304 2017-11-21 19:32:22 UTC <dominionofme> @tedcruz @fawfulfan Obamacare is first and foremost a lie from the start (ie: "You can keep your doctor") An additional safety net that over 90% of U.S. citizens dont use and yet pay for.  Since when do 90% of us have to suffer for the ignorance of leftist ideology?
933053981730983936 2017-11-21 19:26:19 UTC <dominionofme> @EdKrassen Dear Ed & the small number of people that constantly promote your uneducated ignorance on twitter through echo chambered talking points that sound like a broken record.   Find a common goal, other than yelling at a faceless white person that you say exist as systematic oppression
933045995683893248 2017-11-21 18:54:35 UTC <dominionofme> @QuinnipiacPoll @ryanstruyk Lol Yes and Hillary was deemed by polls like this that she would win by a landslide....   You would think they would learn something about these polls and how misleading they can be.
933034753296601093 2017-11-21 18:09:54 UTC <dominionofme> @WesSmith123 (Puts on tin foil hat) Ya! Trump is apart of the Russian mafia crime family lmfao...
933029214747529216 2017-11-21 17:47:54 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @ItsMeJakeJ @StephenGoodier It was worth the effort.
933023394177736705 2017-11-21 17:24:46 UTC <dominionofme> @RubinReport @loreneshaw I think all kinds of doors will open for this women after the insensible crap that was abused to target her.
933007829098745857 2017-11-21 16:22:55 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @ItsMeJakeJ I tried.pic.twitter.com/irtSMWn1UJ
933007206483742720 2017-11-21 16:20:27 UTC <dominionofme> @laurenduca Stick to writing for Teen Vogue. Suits your adolescence and bereft sense of policy and politics.
933006859681894400 2017-11-21 16:19:04 UTC <dominionofme> @laurenduca @yaandoe You must have missed Joe Biden groping and kissing on little girls. Hes got that Roy Moore MoJo only he fooled you naive leftist into thinking hes a decent human being.
932993208556060673 2017-11-21 15:24:49 UTC <dominionofme> @mccanner Of course its all lies. Its the NYT's in 2017. These corp "news" outlets are a toxicity that needs to be reformatted, stripped, wiped clean and dispersed in the name of sensible journalism. No one fully.. FULLY understands the compromise and deceit of the 1600s, 1700s, 1800s...
932991708106805249 2017-11-21 15:18:52 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @ItsMeJakeJ What is most significant about the 2016 election is that most people didnt even vote. The back and forth between the parties and outlandish ignorance displayed throughout 2015-2016 forces people to vote against what they hate.
932991449318207488 2017-11-21 15:17:50 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @ItsMeJakeJ Its like saying "Trump is literally Hitler" as a joke. People with common sense understand fully well that Hitler was Hitler. Manson was Manson. A punchline that goes too far is seen as pathetic & insenible. You are seen as ignorantly uneducated which is what we all hate in 2017.
932986895428194305 2017-11-21 14:59:44 UTC <dominionofme> @Alohababe2011 Its true, but its important for the sake of progressing past this to say men are harassed as well. Given the social fabric norms, much less likely to see it as harassment sure, but its happening more often in clubs and dark lighting events & all groping without consent should end
932980738957422592 2017-11-21 14:35:16 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @ItsMeJakeJ Nah cupcake. You made a joke about a President being like, and promoting Manson after saying "RIP" yourself. But sure sure, do the modern leftism thing, and walk away ignorant to your train of thought and how it effects 1 or 2 votes.. or put on a tin foil hat and blame Russia lol
932866945384402944 2017-11-20 07:03:06 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @ItsMeJakeJ "Rest In Peace Charles Manson" Grow the fuck up and find a sense of humor worth having.  I cant stand that orange faced man as President yet you dont even realize you fueled his rise with adolescent shit like this.
932803328383299584 2017-11-20 02:50:18 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @ItsMeJakeJ Whatever helps you and your low iq sleep at night. Who jokes about Charles Manson and a U.S. president in the same punchline. Tell it to 7 families who lost their loved ones because of this sociopath.
932786054507192321 2017-11-20 01:41:40 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @ItsMeJakeJ Hillary Clinton being president is a better joke. Good luck with that though.
932698707128147968 2017-11-20 19:54:35 UTC <dominionofme> @dirak_ Isnt amen a religious term? I figured this crowd wouldnt be into that sorta thing.
932691174820859904 2017-11-20 19:24:39 UTC <dominionofme> @kevthecheff @StandUpMag_ @ArglesJonathan Passive aggressive much? Have to come up with a story? I live with a trans, they admit this is the best time to come out. Stop promoting this idea there is a faceless person out there to hurt trans people. Grow up please... stop with the identity politics, you are helping Trump.
932687064193294336 2017-11-20 19:08:19 UTC <dominionofme> @StandUpMag_ I have a trans friend who lives with me and he/she doesnt care about pronouns. They just live and let live. They realize the U.S. has made the strongest strides for equality so they can coexist and its misplaced paranoia to think people are "out to get them"
932681188623486977 2017-11-20 18:44:58 UTC <dominionofme> @laurenduca Dont pretend to care about any of this Lauren. Stick to writing in teen vogue and stay out of these complicated issues and politics. It all goes over your head sweetheart. I felt kinda bad when Tucker Carlson destroyed you on live T.V. too.
932679094076149760 2017-11-20 18:36:39 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @thehill @justneanie Was he more stressed out because of the children he constantly groped in photo ops and beyond?
932673927444422657 2017-11-20 18:16:07 UTC <dominionofme> @NolteNC You got some irony mixed with a hint of hypocrisy on your shirt.
932654654973988865 2017-11-20 16:59:32 UTC <dominionofme> @WomenintheWorld I thought we were becoming more racist and sexist yet reality keeps showing otherwise. Ya racism and sexist exist, but its pretty awesome we continue to collectively get beyond the care of someones skin color or biology when it comes to leaders.
932653632188796928 2017-11-20 16:55:28 UTC <dominionofme> @GlennThrush Try not to molest anyone while you are "dormant". Lets be honest... this creep of a troll calling himself a journalist still gets on his account to find comfort from the pathetic cowards that follow him.
932646806189637633 2017-11-20 16:28:20 UTC <dominionofme> @DaftLimmy People thought Hitler was "down to earth" and "funny" too. Sociopaths usually are.
932635547121709057 2017-11-20 15:43:36 UTC <dominionofme> @KT_So_It_Goes @abmoser88 I'll refer you to my previous comment.
932622942344753153 2017-11-20 14:53:31 UTC <dominionofme> @KT_So_It_Goes @abmoser88 Whatever helps ya sleep at night buddy.

932618739287314432 2017-11-20 14:36:49 UTC <dominionofme> @KT_So_It_Goes Your passive aggressiveness is showing. Show me a picture of someone doing something like Franken and I'll agree. Every case is different. The photo of Franken is more damning. Proof isnt always what someone says. Proof is in a picture of real time.
932618116974174209 2017-11-20 14:34:20 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @ItsMeJakeJ You arent the brightest crayon in the box are ya?
932366435438989312 2017-11-19 21:54:15 UTC <dominionofme> @WattersWorld @redpillblack @FoxNews @BrianBeerBrowns @DeQuanSmith_ @ZanderBrant @RobzieDrums Most people on welfare is because Obama fucked up the safety nets that caused an enabling and abuse of the system.   Blame the policy makers, not the identity politics.
932366047247851521 2017-11-19 21:52:42 UTC <dominionofme> @WattersWorld @redpillblack @FoxNews @DeQuanSmith_ Her website wasnt a doxxing website fool. Educate yourself. You can pinpoint certain people on the web without "doxxing" them. And thats the case of the Blaire Witch crazy chick that tried to lie and hide certain trolling tactics that she does.
932268871280623616 2017-11-19 15:26:34 UTC <dominionofme> @JamiraBurley Islam and those who support its violent ends are the biggest threat to mankind. Please educate yourself. Calling all of us white men a threat is pathetic and you are the real threat. Your racist accusations and false information will be the bane of the U.S.
932259633741385728 2017-11-19 14:49:51 UTC <dominionofme> @HeroAssange @Al_AndaluZ The same people who are saying Russians influenced our election are some of the same people that claimed Saddam had WMDs. How could you be so naive?
931965742458785792 2017-11-18 19:22:02 UTC <dominionofme> @alfranken @PaladinCornelia I like how you use a GIF one of Harvey Weisteins closest friends. lol... the irony.pic.twitter.com/B71jBZ1kNK
931942100710633473 2017-11-18 17:48:06 UTC <dominionofme> @funder "Allowed to enter every mall in Alabama"? So.... Democrats still dont have any direction, goals, or plans... Only the importance that they can go to the mall.  No wonder that orange thing is president.
931589977649053697 2017-11-17 18:28:53 UTC <dominionofme> @tedlieu Youre desperation for attention is showing. Try to relax cupcake.
931581759233372160 2017-11-17 17:56:14 UTC <dominionofme> @thehill @H20ratt There are bigger issues. Thats why this will be forgotten.
931581177126903809 2017-11-17 17:53:55 UTC <dominionofme> @DaShanneStokes CNN lol... results... right. Thats a good joke.
931575186746478592 2017-11-17 17:30:07 UTC <dominionofme> @maydaymindy9 A wife defending her husband? Noooo. way! Wow. Who would of thought. I always thought Hillary Clinton was being sincere when she defended Bill for raping all those women.
931564265974194177 2017-11-17 16:46:43 UTC <dominionofme> @NPR @PeanutBrickl Look how triggered you are over a non-profit, privately owned museum that will use money for charity. Educate yourself you poor thing.
931563324285833216 2017-11-17 16:42:58 UTC <dominionofme> @James_Mackler @ATPinDC Youre right, twitter isnt a good place for sincere discussions like this. Do you think women dont go into clubs and grab at mens parts? Men wont come out and say "I was harassed in a club", but its all wrong, and we should focus on not enabling Trumps and the women that harass.
931562357024845824 2017-11-17 16:39:08 UTC <dominionofme> @James_Mackler @ATPinDC Ive sat in lockerrooms growing up and myself and many other guys had a bad habit of exaggerating what we did or could to our girlfriends or our crushes.. It was all bullshit. I grew up. We also have to talk about culture for celebrities. Women let men do this at clubs. Its wrong.
931558934753800194 2017-11-17 16:25:32 UTC <dominionofme> @James_Mackler @ATPinDC Stories arent as significant as proof though. Lots of women are saying Franken did what he did. But the burden of proof is on the accuser. For Franken, only one case matters. The case of proof in the photo. You have to do the same to Trump. You have to show us Trump doing it.
931555455549300736 2017-11-17 16:11:42 UTC <dominionofme> @James_Mackler @ATPinDC Franken is guilty by is own admission. He admitted to it. There is irrefutable proof, not he/she said stories. Thats the difference here. Lets start thinking about how we can safe money for our debt crisis. Not check for patterns to see if his apology was sincere. Makes no sense.
931551627244376065 2017-11-17 15:56:29 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @VOANews @BBC @CNN @RT_com @SenJohnMcCain @exinkygal Lets find common ground and work on restoring faith in our intel agencies and elected officials. I'm very skeptical of our foreign policy and the accusations abroad. We should all demand proof of events after the WMD claim, we are still living with its consequences.
931550110881894401 2017-11-17 15:50:28 UTC <dominionofme> @James_Mackler @ATPinDC Franken was caught red handed though. I dont care if its a "pattern".These elected officials dont fear us enough cause people are willing to dismiss it as "oh it was one time" or something stupid like that. If proof of Trump was there, youd be wise to demand that he leave office.
931545571759882242 2017-11-17 15:32:26 UTC <dominionofme> @lucasbrookwood Pretty sure 288 characters is a limit, not a goal.
931543795459674114 2017-11-17 15:25:22 UTC <dominionofme> @alfranken @PDiddyEsq @Belairviv Look at you defending a sexual predator! Its ok, no one is surprised.
931541575846563848 2017-11-17 15:16:33 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump Dont have to fight hard when picture proof evidence is being compared to "he said, she said" stories.  I dont like Trump, but I do like facts and undeniable evidence, like Franken's case.
931540308868960256 2017-11-17 15:11:31 UTC <dominionofme> @krassenstein @rubyvol Amazing how actual proof of assault can leave you leftist leaning hypocrites saying "dont resign al franken"  While you foam at the mouth towards others you disagree with, despite the lack of irrefutable evidence like the Franken case.
931539523640659969 2017-11-17 15:08:24 UTC <dominionofme> @kylegriffin1 Of course you would mourn a sexual predator that isnt someone your political ideals align with. What else would your echo chamber incentivize you to do?
931538759648251907 2017-11-17 15:05:22 UTC <dominionofme> @krassenstein @EMainze @oceanbluealex She says he did touch her, and he did force his tongue down her throat. Get the facts right honey.
931535249997262849 2017-11-17 14:51:25 UTC <dominionofme> @stopthenutjob @TakebackRWH What did I just say? I said I dont doubt it, but unfortunately... you need proof, like the Al Franken case, or the Harvey Weistein case or if they admit to it! like Franken, and Spacey did. I dont like Trump either but in this country, you are indeed innocent until PROVEN guilty.
931532228110282752 2017-11-17 14:39:24 UTC <dominionofme> @redsteeze Kevin Spacey, big democrat, Louis C.K... again far left leaning democrat, hmmm Harvey Weistein.. strong supporter of hillary and the left..  Im seeing an ironic pattern.
931531858680086530 2017-11-17 14:37:56 UTC <dominionofme> @EdKrassen @StevenEhrlich3 (Puts on tin foil hat) Ew weee.. Ya.. its all a distraction! Trump doesnt want the lizard people that are working for the Russians to put his weapons of mass destruction in my dads basement where youll find Trumps tax returns that prove he is working with aliens that are Russians
931527438349361152 2017-11-17 14:20:22 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @VOANews @BBC @CNN @RT_com @SenJohnMcCain @exinkygal W picked info that was being given to him, by Robert Mueller, James Clapper, James Comey, and many others among the same intel agencies presenting the false evidence. Getting Saddam was something his father wanted, but influence and gaining control of oil was the agenda
931524684897751040 2017-11-17 14:09:26 UTC <dominionofme> @EdKrassen If you cry about someone that represents your party and views being caught with undeniable evidence and all you want is twitter to deflect and be angry at the person you are foaming at the mouth towards... youre apart of the problem.
931292123650973697 2017-11-16 22:45:19 UTC <dominionofme> @stopthenutjob @TakebackRWH I dont even doubt if Trump or Moore are guilty. But you need proof. Not locker room talk on a bus, sweety, lots of guys just talk bullshit to eachother behind closed doors... or a chick thats changing stories about her and a official and his forged signature in her yearbook.
931291514155782144 2017-11-16 22:42:54 UTC <dominionofme> @stopthenutjob @TakebackRWH Other journalist knew about Al Franken, but only knew because the one being harassed asked them not to say anything. If your friend asked you to keep a secret wouldnt you be a good friend & keep it? There isnt a photo of Trump or Moore grabbing at womens breast. Show that to me.
931290595099856900 2017-11-16 22:39:15 UTC <dominionofme> @OfficialJonZal Just to clarify. Hes apologized. I would too if proof was on the table, unlike so many leftist accusations.   So what is the point in spending tax payer dollars on figuring out if his own apology is sincere?
931290225732702209 2017-11-16 22:37:47 UTC <dominionofme> @realBigBalls @Scotladywriter Nice! Deflect! Dismiss! Project! Man you leftist enabling hypocrites are impressive with your naivety.
931289915500797952 2017-11-16 22:36:33 UTC <dominionofme> @realBigBalls Do you think Washington is peaches and rainbows or something? Im jumping to the conclusion that you're a troll on twitter because you're too embarrassed and uneducated to use a twitter that reflect the actual you.
931289389346578432 2017-11-16 22:34:27 UTC <dominionofme> @stopthenutjob @TakebackRWH She came out and admitted that she was sleeping.. so... idk what you get out of telling us all this without mentioning a name or source. Oh thats right... you are a leftist trying to deflect and dismiss Al Franken. K cool.
931287186606923777 2017-11-16 22:25:42 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @VOANews @BBC @CNN @RT_com @SenJohnMcCain @exinkygal Hacking/influencing/interfering.. Any of it. I dont blame you for spinning the context and ignoring my questions.
931264994515214336 2017-11-16 20:57:31 UTC <dominionofme> @tedlieu Maybe he'll pull a Hillary Clinton and just be super sorry "he didnt know he was doing anything wrong"   Then you liberals will ignore and dismiss him. Thats how it worked for Her, so im sure youll show the same respect for any other individual.  (Wakes up)
931263773683281920 2017-11-16 20:52:40 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @VOANews @BBC @CNN @RT_com @SenJohnMcCain @exinkygal Educate yourself on the facts. Ask yourself who is actually making the claim of hacking our votes? Dont just be another broken record, spinning the propaganda out there. These are the same people that said Saddam had WMDs. Why trust them again, so more soliders die for nothing?
931243594450599942 2017-11-16 19:32:29 UTC <dominionofme> @James_Mackler He apologized! There is picture proof of him being a shitstain unlike other people in recent news. Why waste tax dollars on a new investigation that just further points that out? Whats the point exactly? Someone please explain?
931242510785146880 2017-11-16 19:28:10 UTC <dominionofme> @Patrici16389571 Bad habits like gross negligence and pathologically lying usually die hard. Retweet this for me too sweetheart.

And the Russians hacked our election and there are still WMDs under Saddam. Hes still alive. The Russians kept him alive so he could keep those WMDs that Robert Mueller and others helped propagate!
931240629430087681 2017-11-16 19:20:42 UTC <dominionofme> @Patrici16389571 Just make sure she does it before she leaves a public service position. She might delete the email that reminded her to sue him or get sidetracked by claiming that Bosnian snipers were shooting at her lmfao...
931240011403579399 2017-11-16 19:18:14 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @VOANews @BBC @CNN @RT_com @SenJohnMcCain @exinkygal TLDR: We are the leaders. We should get control back of our elections. No more Russian tin foil hat theories and enabling of corporate media colluding with candidates.
931239698747535361 2017-11-16 19:17:00 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @VOANews @BBC @CNN @RT_com @SenJohnMcCain @exinkygal I wish people would acknowledge that Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, and all those before and after them.. are our elected officials. They arent leaders, they are representatives of us. The more we stick to that fact, the less chance we'll get Trumps or Clintons as a choice in 2020.
931238847807131650 2017-11-16 19:13:37 UTC <dominionofme> @RobertRExists Whatever helps you sleep at night cupcake.
931237570150895616 2017-11-16 19:08:32 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @Mayne1Carrie There ya go. Let that Al Franken anger out. Take it out on me sweetie. It'll all be ok.
931236338116038656 2017-11-16 19:03:39 UTC <dominionofme> @funder Im not a republican but I always thought a person can defend him/herself when getting accused of something. We are innocent until proven guilty? Evidence like a picture of real time assaults are one thing. Stories and locker room talk arent the same thing.
931232382878969856 2017-11-16 18:47:56 UTC <dominionofme> @WatchChad You are innocent until proven guilty. If you cant see the difference in picture proof of real time vs. accusations and forged signatures in a high school year book... you need to live in socialistic society or somethin.

931231043029479425 2017-11-16 18:42:36 UTC <dominionofme> @ResistanceZone Idk, can you show me a picture of Trump and/or Moore laughing and making molesting gestures at a female while her eyes are closed? Sleeping?
931230730532868096 2017-11-16 18:41:22 UTC <dominionofme> @JerryBeller1 @Candyaddict4now Thats like saying "thankfully the republicans passed the civil rights acts in the 60s"  Please educate yourself on history and how times and parties change before you make yourself look so stupid.
931230297215111168 2017-11-16 18:39:38 UTC <dominionofme> @JerryBeller1 Hows the silence on Al Franken and all his friends (Kevin Spacey, Harvey Weistein, Louis C.K.)   Ya id stfu and project negativity elsewhere if I was a leftist with a low IQ too.
931229978032857090 2017-11-16 18:38:22 UTC <dominionofme> @rking_19 @Mama3Cubs You mean you're anxiously passive aggressive because that shitstain Al Franken got caught in a picture proof situation defining his lack of decency?
931229013523271680 2017-11-16 18:34:32 UTC <dominionofme> Let me fix this for you @krassenstein   Al Franken is asking tax payers to waste money on further pointing out hes a shitstain.  Roy Moore is standing by his right to defend himself and we are all innocent until proven guilty.

931219341428830209 2017-11-16 17:56:06 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @Mayne1Carrie Show me picture proof, and if you cant.. Maybe you should rethink your values.
931218772219789314 2017-11-16 17:53:51 UTC <dominionofme> @LeeannTweeden @realBigBalls @swiftliz216 Awwwww lol... your precious image of this shitstain going downhill? Time to grow up and avoid voting democrat, and republican.

You are indeed innocent until PROVEN guilty. Like the proof that Al Frank is a shitstain just like Bill Clinton and Anthony Wiener.
931216386667548672 2017-11-16 17:44:22 UTC <dominionofme> @speakout_april Lol look how mad you are about proof of Al Franken being the shitstain that he is, but no proof on Roy Moore? Go take a nap honey, your adolescence is showing.

931206524231409664 2017-11-16 17:05:11 UTC <dominionofme> @Patrici16389571 @PalmerReport Look at this troll @BobinHB. This is what you call a false equivalency. Hillary blamed the death of the 4 americans on a random ass youtube video. Thank fuckin gawd people like Gowdy were at that hearing to point that out.
931203765855817728 2017-11-16 16:54:13 UTC <dominionofme> @PalmerReport Huh? This twitter account isnt very bright.

931201714459430912 2017-11-16 16:46:04 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @StephenAtHome Stick to what you think is "comedy" Colbert lol.. You dont relate to anyone bud. Go plan a Samantha Bee interview and make a low ball joke that is insulting to gays. Hypocrite.
931196176354959360 2017-11-16 16:24:03 UTC <dominionofme> @RobertRExists Umm... Obama the dictator force signed and propagandized a 110 billion healthcare overhaul that only 11-12 million people actually use while over 300 million of us have to pay for it... while were in the middle of war and a debt crisis. This museum project will not effect you.

930636683716030464 2017-11-14 03:20:50 UTC <dominionofme> (Puts on tin foil hat) Ya! And Russians are behind it all! Ooooh Weee. Look at us go!

930485840899342336 2017-11-14 17:21:26 UTC <dominionofme> One of the biggest problems right now is poor uneducated fools like @charliespiering still think Trump is a Republican. Grow up and educate yourself please.
930319309859106816 2017-11-13 06:19:42 UTC <dominionofme> @jzelin6 Like people dont choose to look at culture being the issue. Lack of not one, but two parents, that adopt what we all should consider to be common sense values. Live, and let live. Not point at a faceless person of any color, & make the adolescent claim of "systimatic racism" ect.

930174559831064576 2017-11-13 20:44:31 UTC <dominionofme> @jzelin6 I support his right to kneel. I blame the media for propagating Kaeperniks uneducated display of activism. And ya, im offended when someone takes something that represents my families sacrifice so we can peacefully protest, only to butcher it by making it about identity politics.
930163088954941440 2017-11-13 19:58:56 UTC <dominionofme> @jzelin6 Sweetheart, I have fun tweeting about interesting science or mythology. This is me using my voice to point out fallacy as I view it, with sarcasm or painful humor.. as I see fit. You think people are not offended by GQs labeling?
930158863961219072 2017-11-13 19:42:09 UTC <dominionofme> @BillCorbett You can tell most people in the U.S. who vote are uneducated & adolescent by looking at who had the most votes in the 2016 election. Thank fuckin gawd the frameworkers of our constitution had the brilliance & foresight to avoid letting California and NY make our policy.

930140111089565696 2017-11-13 18:27:38 UTC <dominionofme> @jzelin6 Ya I was so proud when my mommy named me "citizen of the year" too. Our respect for the flag has nothing to do with the thousands that died so Colin could show how uneducated he is about reality.pic.twitter.com/Z8vnyQvzI2

930091639892299777 2017-11-13 15:15:01 UTC <dominionofme> @ekownyankah When Hillary Clinton ran around calling people super predators, and how they need to be "brought to heel". What about when she openly admitted to Robert Byrd being her mentor? Would you of still written this piece if she won? Because millions doubt you would.
930090371564089345 2017-11-13 15:09:59 UTC <dominionofme> @1236 @jordanbpeterson @stphnmaher Careful. We have a "creditable" fanboy over here.

Gona go lie about getting shot at with snipers while I visit Bosnia right after I stereotype black people as super predators.
929829446034640903 2017-11-12 21:53:09 UTC <dominionofme> @kylegriffin1 @Stevedlfc War needs to be settled. Innocent North Korean lives need something to look forward to. No one should have to worry about whether a religious person wants to kill someone or not. 20 trillion in debt needs to be solved so we can all afford safety nets.
929806054720000000 2017-11-12 20:20:13 UTC <dominionofme> @CNNSotu What about when James Clapper, Robert Mueller and James Comey were making the WMD claim? What about the peril that came to thousands of soldiers lives all because they didnt know what they were talking about?

929401453524996096 2017-11-11 17:32:28 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @funder I come from a family of U.S. soldiers. Relax with the drama queen bullshit. We are STILL recovering from a "war on terror" that cost thousands of lives under the same intelligence agencies and people like Robert Mueller who made the WMD claim. Time to grow the fuck up maybe?
929369272429830144 2017-11-11 15:24:36 UTC <dominionofme> @Evan_McMullin So you are saying because you are paranoid, we all should be paranoid?

929041380340531200 2017-11-10 17:41:40 UTC <dominionofme> @kylegriffin1 @KittenMcKays What are you desperate for a response? Sorry but your question is a clear cut example that you have no idea what youre talking about. How do you think those who work for the ACA safety net get paid? How did they get paid before the implementation of obamacare? Educate yourself.
929041066858344448 2017-11-10 17:40:25 UTC <dominionofme> @kylegriffin1 @KittenMcKays @roguecats7 Hey, when you enable the destructiveness of a failing system like Obamacare. You and your low IQ can assume whatever you want about me and what I care about.

I want people to be taken care of, but priorities need to be straight, not reckless like Obamas been with bills and executive orders. War has to stop, our debt needs a clear collective goal & plan.. so we can afford safety nets
928812476845776897 2017-11-09 02:32:05 UTC <dominionofme> @stavvers Uh... no... they use rye or wheat berries. Must be a shitty life if you are making headlines with your disgusting concept of yeast. Get help sweetheart. Also, just because I think you should hear this. Hillary was a much worse choice than even the orange thing called Donald.

928676801185972225 2017-11-09 17:32:58 UTC <dominionofme> @jaketapper Probably because US reporters arent the brightest.

Remember that time Jake Tapper you questioned a soldiers "hopelessness" in which he exposed your disconnection? That disconnection is real.

928670268184293377 2017-11-09 17:07:00 UTC <dominionofme> @kylegriffin1 So 138,000-140k new sign ups added to around 11-12 million people. Are you ignorant to the reality that those 11-12 million enablers are hurting the other 300+ million people having to pay for their healthcare? Obamacare is destroying us, not helping.

928635081933062144 2017-11-09 14:47:11 UTC <dominionofme> @NanciAma The poor editing of this picture is proof democrat trolls really are unintelligible old men and women finger pointing each key as they come up with this stuff. No wonder that orange idiot won. At least be creative?
928634554533011456 2017-11-09 14:45:05 UTC <dominionofme> @GrantJKidney @MAIDOHC Did you just say Trump Magic? No wonder that idiot won and that evil vile sick Hillary Clinton lost. Ill take the idiot.
928633174594265088 2017-11-09 14:39:36 UTC <dominionofme> @factoryofcool What wave? I thought that "the resistance" was the thing? Lol who knows.. Democrats are so confused now days. I dont blame them for taking on shiny new labels for themselves. Poor kids think those projected victories yesterday are significant.
928632632950312962 2017-11-09 14:37:27 UTC <dominionofme> @hrhacl @Ptrishapeach Lol I love this.. "Anti-trump wave"... what wave? I thought that was "the resistance" lmfao... dopey democrats.
928295686256373761 2017-11-08 16:18:33 UTC <dominionofme> @RubinReport @cenbai My thoughts exactly.
928275985052598279 2017-11-08 15:00:16 UTC <dominionofme> @LouisatheLast If Richard Spencer decided he wasnt racist today. It would be a lie. If Trump was a KKK member & then claimed to be super sorry, you and I would still feel as we should about him, that hes a vile human being no? Project that I'm a troll all you want. Clinton was the worst choice.
928266930045067264 2017-11-08 14:24:17 UTC <dominionofme> @LouisatheLast The irony of relating trolls to large groups of people and it not having anything to do with the left is hilarious. Why did Harvey Weinstein support Bill & Hillary for so long? Why did Hillary publicly admit to Robert Byrd as being her "mentor"? Who is the troll again? Pathetic.
928264734603751425 2017-11-08 14:15:33 UTC <dominionofme> @nytimes @DriverWrites Isnt it in essence sexist to say "we need a female president because weve only had male ones?" I want Tulsi Gabbard as President because shes simply qualified & untainted, but the left wants to enable & ignore the DNC working tyrannically for one person a year before an election.
928103065131126784 2017-11-07 03:33:08 UTC <dominionofme> @RubinReport @NP_Podcast Its ok Rubin. White doesnt understand that you can pin point certain adolescence on the internet without "dox'ing" someone. And Owens should of kept her demeanor and tone down. I dont blame her though, this Blaire chick is deflecting and projecting like a true 2017 liberal.
928068433752838145 2017-11-07 01:15:31 UTC <dominionofme> @JohnFugelsang 100% of you probably still dont mind that Hillarys favorite mentor was a full on KKK LEADER.. and also 100% of you dont know Will Quiggs supported her with 20k in 2016. Time to grow up?
927958513237790722 2017-11-07 17:58:44 UTC <dominionofme> @igorvolsky And this is the rifle that stopped him from killing anyone else. You going to put up photos of the Home Depot rental truck from NYC attack?pic.twitter.com/AV5rZOxZI4
927956635435323393 2017-11-07 17:51:17 UTC <dominionofme> @martinMmorrow Youre impressive! A little less than 4k followers and without any sense of humor. Good luck with that cupcake!
927951357717467136 2017-11-07 17:30:18 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @AeroApe51 @MovieBuffChick1 So youd be silent when this nut used a truck to run people over coming out of a church? So you rely on your corrupt system with bullets?
927950782904918016 2017-11-07 17:28:01 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @AeroApe51 And if not for our 2nd right as citizens, that number would be higher, and the shooter could have gotten away.
927913871024812032 2017-11-07 15:01:21 UTC <dominionofme> @JenAshleyWright If youre a republican, vote and spend your own time hoping a strangers life is better.   If youre a democrat, keep trivializing & projecting
927694194793222145 2017-11-06 00:28:26 UTC <dominionofme> @BillClinton @Catholicgauze @ReilySeanConn You say years of peace but reality is much different. The 90s was prosperous because of policies Reagan put in. Educate yourself!
927688381039071237 2017-11-06 00:05:20 UTC <dominionofme> @clutzbuffrap Stop dancing on the graves of dead children. Ironic you call me, a stranger, sick. Lets ban guns like we did weed. It worked so well!!!pic.twitter.com/Nc1s0PRylE

927604552567787520 2017-11-06 18:32:14 UTC <dominionofme> @megwagner Because of their religion, he was motivated as a religious atheist to kill them. Dont trivialize this. Time to talk about mental illnesses.

927595976155697152 2017-11-06 17:58:09 UTC <dominionofme> @JoeBiden @HostileApostleJ @JohnWalako You want that pedophile Biden for president with the white chick telling people shes indian? Im a white guy but i have 14th cherokee! lmfao.
927595103140700160 2017-11-06 17:54:41 UTC <dominionofme> @JoeBiden You prepping to run for President with this simplistic nonsense? Its time to teach respect and bravery FOR and WITH guns.. So residents win.
927592366453788672 2017-11-06 17:43:48 UTC <dominionofme> @wilw Over 41,000 idiots liking this dont even know the shooter was brought down by NRA members.
927590574235975680 2017-11-06 17:36:41 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @shawnmpatterson @ProudResister Im not a Trump supporter.. but UPenn and facebook are severely liberal and run by capitalist facebook giants. Get some unbias source for us.
927589736012709888 2017-11-06 17:33:21 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @ProudResister @shawnmpatterson Awww.. good for you! You can put up a website funded by leftist U of Pennsylvania and fucking big bad capitalist Facebook.
927586837580926976 2017-11-06 17:21:50 UTC <dominionofme> @Alt_FedEmployee The shooter was brought down by a NRA citizen member. Maybe those kids will grow up with responsible parents that teach respect and bravery.
927570149930127360 2017-11-06 16:15:31 UTC <dominionofme> @TheLaunchMag Jay-Z being portrayed as a "gangster".... lol if thats true we have some weak and spineless organized crime in 2017.
927569343793238016 2017-11-06 16:12:19 UTC <dominionofme> @JasonKander @IslesFanInBkNY @GAtkinsonNY The resident who shot the gunman is an NRA member. Poor uneducated fool. Go read a book on self defense and mental illness.
927561390960906240 2017-11-06 15:40:43 UTC <dominionofme> @clutzbuffrap Wrong. More brave bystanders like the resident = Less nuts getting away with killing whether they use a truck, an ice pick and yes... a gun.
927559004271857664 2017-11-06 15:31:14 UTC <dominionofme> @clutzbuffrap No we need more people willing to respect a gun, own one.. and be ready to stand strong and act in case police cannot. Dems need to grow up
927556995225407491 2017-11-06 15:23:15 UTC <dominionofme> @FallahLyel False. Everyone knows this is both a mental issue and an act of terror. Grow the fuck up. A citizen with a gun shot him down asshole.
927556586133950464 2017-11-06 15:21:37 UTC <dominionofme> @PoopJudge Its fitting that an account named "Poop Dog" is in complete delusion over the fact that everyone knows this is terrorism AND mentally F'd

926096841258819584 2017-11-02 14:41:07 UTC <dominionofme> @KamalaHarris I kinda want to ask you why you couldnt pass the bar. But I wont get an answer either. How are you an elected person at all?

925793020787732481 2017-11-01 18:33:51 UTC <dominionofme> @NoahCRothman People killing others in the name of their God should get a shortcut to ruling, none of this years and years waiting while we feed them.

925371060932968448 2017-10-31 14:37:08 UTC <dominionofme> Activism is good. Any activist that considers BuzzFeed credible is about as credible at Robert Mueller and his claim that Saddam had WMDs.
925370199766917120 2017-10-31 14:33:42 UTC <dominionofme> @brianstelter @JoanBiskupic @hilly18 Like they did when they claimed Saddam had WMDs which led to the needless death thousands of our soldiers? Trump is gross but you're deluded
925368616954056704 2017-10-31 14:27:25 UTC <dominionofme> @CNNPolitics So when Mueller helped claim there were "WMDs" under Saddam, which killed thousands US soldiers.. Id say ya, no shit hes powerful.
925351245199618048 2017-10-31 13:18:23 UTC <dominionofme> @thehill @marrcamp Just like Hillarys supporters dont care about anything she ever did? Hmmmm...

924281021436219393 2017-10-28 14:25:42 UTC <dominionofme> @CrabDiving @historyjudges Mueller is good at propaganda! When he told us there were WMDs in the middle east under Saddam you believe him. Now Trump tower has WMDs lol
924280647404916736 2017-10-28 14:24:13 UTC <dominionofme> @CrabDiving Mueller once said there were WMDs. He could tell you there were WMDs in Trump tower and you idiots would still believe him.
924279300727234560 2017-10-28 14:18:52 UTC <dominionofme> @RogerJStoneJr @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu I wonder, do irresponsible adolescent turds like you and this tweet believe Mueller as much as you did when he said there were WMDs?
924275841009319939 2017-10-28 14:05:07 UTC <dominionofme> @EdKrassen Mueller once said there were WMDs and you idiots believed him, now Russia colluded with Trump despite Hillary's Iranian deal with them lmao.

922493851092291584 2017-10-23 16:04:07 UTC <dominionofme> @nkem_x in 2017, every complaint about life gets more sophisticated and hides itself under the protection of "philosophy"
922488514171822081 2017-10-23 15:42:55 UTC <dominionofme> @KennethFolk Just so we can remind ourselves that some idiots are teaching people this garbage, non-sensible cowardly dogshit then pass it as philosophy

922486798479167488 2017-10-23 15:36:06 UTC <dominionofme> @PhilosophyMttrs This article cherry picks a vague and unsure case then proceeds to complain. Since when is bitching also philosophy?

918140947644473344 2017-10-11 15:47:14 UTC <dominionofme> @NWPinPDX Nice straw man arguments. You are a true representation of why Trump or someone worse will get re-elected. Thanks dumbass.

918126360631050240 2017-10-11 14:49:16 UTC <dominionofme> @TheMarkPantano Its 2017. The number of people who criticize you over that is too small. You should ignore them & rest assure most want to live & let live.
918124306512695298 2017-10-11 14:41:07 UTC <dominionofme> @LeBatardShow Vice isnt doing anything "interesting". Just recently they did a false & misleading piece on the Charlottesville controversy.

917403440552251392 2017-10-09 14:56:39 UTC <dominionofme> @BuffyResists So youre celebrating the native tribes that raped, murdered, and stole from other tribes long before Columbus showed up? #leftistAreIdiots
917402545026469888 2017-10-09 14:53:05 UTC <dominionofme> @samwhiteout We should study the atrocities native tribes committed on each other long before Columbus showed up. We've never been perfect, nor were they
917399220532973568 2017-10-09 14:39:53 UTC <dominionofme> @RedTRaccoon Yes. Everyone here should read up on some of the tribes that raped, murdered, and stole from each other long before Columbus was here.
917396670555545605 2017-10-09 14:29:45 UTC <dominionofme> @AngryBlackLady Natives went around killing & stealing from each other before Columbus showed up. Does that mean I get to ramble like an idiot about it?
917393984997257216 2017-10-09 14:19:05 UTC <dominionofme> @TomFitton @AlicetheHellion Yes, native tribes did rape, murder and steal long before the "white man" showed up to display mens imperfections of that period.

917063487490351104 2017-10-08 16:25:48 UTC <dominionofme> @MarkDuplass To be clear Mark, the RNC doesnt act like the DNC. Like dictators of who is worthy. Bernie should of had a legit chance, but Hillary? No.
917062512650186752 2017-10-08 16:21:55 UTC <dominionofme> @CalGeekGrl Thats because they are that insignificant. You raising your fist because some white guys got together will get Trump re-elected. Grow up.

912842849405763585 2017-09-26 00:54:29 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @JesseBenn As a "writer" does it disturb you that these "antifa" are more fascist than those they accuse of being fascist?
912708926877073408 2017-09-26 16:02:20 UTC <dominionofme> @JohnWashBlog @Barton_Funk Get out of your echo chamber. You rambling belligerently with newsweek articles & blind adolescent hatred help him more than I ever could.
912705962078810112 2017-09-26 15:50:33 UTC <dominionofme> @JohnWashBlog @Barton_Funk And if I told you the Clintons are in the business of black market organ transplants... well.. like I said, No point. Now accuse and deflect

912694777048702976 2017-09-26 15:06:06 UTC <dominionofme> @JohnWashBlog @Barton_Funk I have a bigger list of things from Hillary that have nothing to do with travel expenses to a golf course but youre ignorant so.. No point.
912688377887100928 2017-09-26 14:40:40 UTC <dominionofme> @RealStreicher I dont relate to your list but through your adolescence you can try to label people like me all you want. Too low of an IQ?
912681043769085954 2017-09-26 14:11:32 UTC <dominionofme> @sistertoldjah If its not about the flag then he could protest in a way that makes sense, no? Hes a crap football player & he could do more with his wallet
912678271178936321 2017-09-26 14:00:31 UTC <dominionofme> @nytopinion I love that so many are replying with sarcasm towards this non-sense. Gives me hope for those that were crazy enough to prefer H. Clinton

912334021362962432 2017-09-25 15:12:35 UTC <dominionofme> @DavidCornDC @realjenleona @uscolson Mueller was one of the idiots claiming there were WMD's after 9/11. You people in your echo chambers are going to help Trump win 2020.
912333284876718081 2017-09-25 15:09:40 UTC <dominionofme> @DavidCornDC I think thats all it was ever about. "Hands up dont shoot" was a good enough lie to persuade millions.
912332567885631489 2017-09-25 15:06:49 UTC <dominionofme> @CNN My room mates father spent 6 years in prison for spending 15 minutes talking to a young girl groping him in public. This man needs more time
912325644830363648 2017-09-25 14:39:18 UTC <dominionofme> @NFLPA Yet you will still fail to realize kneeling during during our anthem shows you are a coward, not a protester. Shows you're uneducated.

912324216992780288 2017-09-25 14:33:38 UTC <dominionofme> @TheBradMielke Wow so a minority is actually standing up against ignorant and illogical ways of protesting like kneeling during an anthem?
912305779302174720 2017-09-25 13:20:22 UTC <dominionofme> @AchievedTv Could be a number of things. You might need a new MOBO, CPU, GPU, or RAMM.
911620464996491265 2017-09-23 15:57:10 UTC <dominionofme> @JohnWashBlog @Barton_Funk Like the Clinton foundation being investigated? You have to be a pretty fucked up charity organization to be investigated by FBI.
911375391574634496 2017-09-22 23:43:20 UTC <dominionofme> @SeanMcElwee Get out of your bubble and echo chambers. Panicking over polls... Grow up. Relying on those polls is one of the reasons Dems lost 2016.
911374459512254465 2017-09-22 23:39:38 UTC <dominionofme> @KevinMKruse When are you people going to realize your faith in these numbers are one of the reasons Trump is President. Educate yourself.
911257641913143296 2017-09-22 15:55:26 UTC <dominionofme> @RickKennedyTX17 The padded regulations make it hard for middle class workers to find work.

911245224516706305 2017-09-22 15:06:06 UTC <dominionofme> @mombizzz There is one type of Hillary supporter and I dont need a poorly edited captioned image to tell you. The uneducated adolescent dolts.
910894626474782722 2017-09-21 15:52:57 UTC <dominionofme> @AchievedTv you mad man
910887243287547905 2017-09-21 15:23:36 UTC <dominionofme> @VileEpiphany LOL! No wonder Trump is President. You crazy leftist dont know how to pick them. Check out Tulsi Gabbard, get a clue while you're at it.
910881891045249025 2017-09-21 15:02:20 UTC <dominionofme> @MaddowBlog @DanOfromNYC Fact: If the Clintons admitted they liked to be pee'd on. You crazy leftist would shout down anyone who criticized it as being insensitive.
910880765021388801 2017-09-21 14:57:52 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @billdykstra @KimKierkegaard Says who.. YOU? Not everything is about having something "sold". I know youre a lonely troll in this world but grow up a bit cupcake.
910880476310720512 2017-09-21 14:56:43 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @billdykstra @KimKierkegaard And Clinton getting a golf ball to the brain hypothetically is worth criticizing to you because you have too low of an IQ to get the humor
910582401436327936 2017-09-20 19:12:16 UTC <dominionofme> @ChelseaClinton @kdqd3 @TinaFL And millions more are fully aware of what chaos your family has caused the world for too long. Go sell some t-shirts at a mall. Suits you.
910502317081767938 2017-09-20 13:54:03 UTC <dominionofme> @jisf0rjosh Because most people in America are dumb as fuck. Hillary getting the popular vote is proof of that.
910495729256460288 2017-09-20 13:27:52 UTC <dominionofme> @ImpulseII If you can count. You can probably assume less than 4 years.
910492209614606337 2017-09-20 13:13:53 UTC <dominionofme> @NativistBill @tcapotesashes Even if it were true that this orange person likes to have sex a certain way or get pee'd on. Why the fuck do you really care? Grow up.
910491488231997445 2017-09-20 13:11:01 UTC <dominionofme> @tcapotesashes The FBI has admitted to having an active investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Not Trumps lmao.... The irony of this picture is great.
910281380864626689 2017-09-19 23:16:08 UTC <dominionofme> @JenniferMcquaid @BitOfJules @cbouzy Have you forgotten Hillary took people like Robert Muellers advice that there were WMD's? She helped destabilize Libya & was aiming 4 Syria.
910281060470181888 2017-09-19 23:14:51 UTC <dominionofme> @JenniferMcquaid @BitOfJules @cbouzy Has WW3 been declared? Are you naive enough to think Hillary wouldnt of been a warmonger? No wonder Trump is president. Dont be ignorant 1/2
910214148809687040 2017-09-19 18:48:58 UTC <dominionofme> @cbouzy @JenniferMcquaid @BitOfJules Thanks for deflecting and avoiding my point about the cowardly and adolescent view of enabling cheating within U.S. presidential debates.
910213752422899712 2017-09-19 18:47:24 UTC <dominionofme> @cbouzy @JenniferMcquaid @BitOfJules She would lie and cover up those returns anyway. http://www.news5cleveland.com/longform/exclusive-clinton-charities-ignore-law-requiring-them-to-disclose-millions-from-foreign-donors The clintons have deep ties into gov and the gov helping hide them
910213464802693120 2017-09-19 18:46:15 UTC <dominionofme> @cbouzy @JenniferMcquaid @BitOfJules I wouldnt be asking for Hillary tax returns because there is no law that requires a president to do so. I want to see his tax returns. 1/2
910211691576745986 2017-09-19 18:39:12 UTC <dominionofme> @cbouzy @JenniferMcquaid @BitOfJules If you ever wonder why people would vote for Trump over a pathological liar like Hillary. Remember your dismissal of cheating in a NA debate
910211239749541889 2017-09-19 18:37:25 UTC <dominionofme> @cbouzy @JenniferMcquaid @BitOfJules 1 question. 100 questions. It doesnt matter. We are talking about the PRESIDENT of the united states. You wanna normalize cheating?
910210952099975168 2017-09-19 18:36:16 UTC <dominionofme> @cbouzy @JenniferMcquaid @BitOfJules Show me one case where a news corp. employee colluded exact debate questions to a nominee? You cant. You need two standards for a comparison
910169438644731905 2017-09-19 15:51:18 UTC <dominionofme> @HillaryClinton @imnottayediggs @thecircledancer Ya you cleared that up already chief. Have a good day! Read a new book that fights your ideas!
910169066807136256 2017-09-19 15:49:50 UTC <dominionofme> @ParkerMolloy @RoksteadyKarma Or yours.
910168945314889729 2017-09-19 15:49:21 UTC <dominionofme> @ParkerMolloy Lil kim? Outdated and doesnt have as much of an insulting ring as "rocket man"
910167060906430465 2017-09-19 15:41:52 UTC <dominionofme> @DoraDoubleDD Look at you! "MAGA Klan". Ya whoever wants to truly make america great is apart of a racist cult right? Like the one Hillarys idol was in?
910166471896190976 2017-09-19 15:39:31 UTC <dominionofme> @BitOfJules @cbouzy @JenniferMcquaid Just like millions upon millions of people when Hillary was caught cheating on a presidential debate? Nah. Not that surprisingly petty.
910165350716788736 2017-09-19 15:35:04 UTC <dominionofme> @caguirre94 High five? Millions upon millions of people are happy hes making a joke out of the fat little socialistic maniac. Just move to NK yourself.
910163880625754123 2017-09-19 15:29:13 UTC <dominionofme> @HillaryClinton @imnottayediggs @thecircledancer I know you will. Which is why I pointed out that indeed ignorance is a bigger problem than you or I think. At least you admit to your own.
910159564640784385 2017-09-19 15:12:04 UTC <dominionofme> @funder This tin foil hat must be working!!! All people who I disagree with shall be condemned by association. Nothing adolescent about this at all!
910158157967712257 2017-09-19 15:06:29 UTC <dominionofme> @HillaryClinton @imnottayediggs @thecircledancer No, all human beings are flawed. Hillary is one of the pathological lying ones. You have no idea what my argument is, if I had one with you.
910139933070897152 2017-09-19 13:54:04 UTC <dominionofme> @imnottayediggs @thecircledancer Which is why Hillary lost. Too many were wise to her blatant dishonest personality and sociopath-like tendencies. Just too ignorant.
910136687522668544 2017-09-19 13:41:10 UTC <dominionofme> @DonaldJTrumpJr @joncoopertweets Where is the option "doesnt want to be spied on by corrupt nutjobs" More people left the secret service under Obama than ever for a reason
910129802748850176 2017-09-19 13:13:49 UTC <dominionofme> @jeff_gringo @J_AlPrufrock The "outdated" system keeps California and New York City from making every choice in our reps. Educate yourself fool.
909833731082539009 2017-09-18 17:37:20 UTC <dominionofme> @SenKamalaHarris Focus on fixing the issues within your state. Focus on brighter women than you, like Asra Nomani and Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Educate yourself.
909832563350532101 2017-09-18 17:32:41 UTC <dominionofme> @TopherSpiro No ones medicaid is ending. Those millions are harming hundreds of millions. Obamacare SHOULD be gutted. 2027 is plenty of time. #Growup
909832149901209600 2017-09-18 17:31:03 UTC <dominionofme> @h3h3productions @KEEMSTAR There should be a dislike option for twitter. This guy is a self-proclaimed adolescent troll. He shouldnt be judging people as hypocrites.
908780899440975873 2017-09-15 19:53:45 UTC <dominionofme> @NoleLifeFam No wonder you cant spell.
908687333079371781 2017-09-15 13:41:57 UTC <dominionofme> @SophiaLeeHyun @crebright @NoleLifeFam Maybe he is. And maybe hes even a liar. But at least he isnt a sociopath & doesnt pathologically lie like the only other choice the U.S. had
908685360116457477 2017-09-15 13:34:07 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @jenniferbrown @sd_saurav @tariqnasheed @SianteJ No. Ben would wipe the floor with this racist coward running around accusing anyone who disagrees with him as racist
908684988123623425 2017-09-15 13:32:38 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @jenniferbrown @sd_saurav @tariqnasheed No one wants to be bored by Ben destroying some non-sensible nobody thats just another lying turd blossom getting Black people killed.
908684164249120769 2017-09-15 13:29:21 UTC <dominionofme> @deenieshats @tariqnasheed Ben drills the nail on the head in this video. Thank you for sharing his non-racist common sense.
908683091018952709 2017-09-15 13:25:06 UTC <dominionofme> @deenieshats @tariqnasheed Nasheed is just upset that too many are fully aware of his racist hate towards anyone who doesnt agree with them.
908474409819758593 2017-09-14 23:35:52 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @graywolf @GregGoodfried And insulting people like yourself is why people are willing to vote for anything but Hillary. Who lies 3x's more.
907613041134628864 2017-09-12 14:33:06 UTC <dominionofme> @JRadMKE If you think this is creepy.. you should check out the videos of Joe Biden creeping everyone out. So much worse than any of this Cruz stuff.
907612536551493632 2017-09-12 14:31:05 UTC <dominionofme> @FullFrontalSamB Dont forget to not label people as nazi's over their haircut today? Oh wait. You're ignorant and have no perspective of reality in the U.S..
907612187744722944 2017-09-12 14:29:42 UTC <dominionofme> @reaIdonaIdtripe @summergirl198 Like you living in an echo chamber?
907610696136974336 2017-09-12 14:23:47 UTC <dominionofme> @desusnice @missfruitfly Look at the mans face in this gif lmao.. Swear to gawd this thing has a dick.
907607656935903232 2017-09-12 14:11:42 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @kurtimus You can be more creative than that! Trump isnt cunning enough to be white-walker-ish
907605722204131328 2017-09-12 14:04:01 UTC <dominionofme> @mrandrewworrell Then why make a tweet about it? Oh ya. Probably has something to do with an echo chamber you're living in.
907605544420114432 2017-09-12 14:03:18 UTC <dominionofme> @mrandrewworrell Way to keep up sparky! You should see how many people dont care about what Hillary has to say. Dont think you can count that high!
907012726211432449 2017-09-10 22:47:40 UTC <dominionofme> @benshapiro @piersmorgan Oh please Piers. You find him annoying because you havent done so well debating him. You are apart of the reason millions listen to him.
906678984703963138 2017-09-09 00:41:29 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @EdKrassen @taniaT504 I voted for Obama twice. So ignorant.
906629584527003649 2017-09-09 21:25:11 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @EdKrassen @taniaT504 I never know what the point is with you crazy leftist. You probably think Russia and Trump are responsible for the hurricanes this season.
906559579886145542 2017-09-09 16:47:01 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @EdKrassen @taniaT504 I make 33,000+/- a year. I donate about a 3rd of that to those who need it and i write it off on my taxes. So I'm a bad person for trying?
906013171718152193 2017-09-07 04:35:47 UTC <dominionofme> @cbouzy So you want to not make america great again? Are you going to say a red hat is a symbol or something?
905784359235575813 2017-09-07 13:26:34 UTC <dominionofme> @LoveDJTrump @arthurchandra7 Another article that helps people like Trump get elected? Hello? Read something worth reading.
905783162172833792 2017-09-07 13:21:49 UTC <dominionofme> @woopigsushi @ReadingVixen Do you dispute Hillarys racism was more evident as well as her pathological lying.. more than Trump? Oh right. We dont talk about that.
905781186416533504 2017-09-07 13:13:58 UTC <dominionofme> @ddale8 Its not popular disbelief. Its your popular delusion.
905780512274481152 2017-09-07 13:11:17 UTC <dominionofme> @battletested5 Hillary was caught on audio discriminating minorities. You dont like people talking about facts because they expose your bias and hate.
905780203150069760 2017-09-07 13:10:03 UTC <dominionofme> @battletested5 You know he won because of belligerent hate like this towards millions of your fellow Americans right?
905779714287169538 2017-09-07 13:08:07 UTC <dominionofme> @battletested5 @bobokoko21 George Washington told the world he was a bigot? Sorry. I didnt vote for Trump and I dont speak "echo chamber" and generalizations.
905426661621026816 2017-09-06 13:45:12 UTC <dominionofme> @georgesoros @DineshDSouza @newtguinea Because you dont want to admit that he is giving tons of money to organizations like the modern ironic Antifa? They are what they hate.
904922356069564416 2017-09-04 04:21:16 UTC <dominionofme> @nowthisnews @crowez45 You can call them whatever you want. At least Trump will say the words to condemn these Nazi's. You are apart of the irony of these "antifa"

904502170699141121 2017-09-03 00:31:36 UTC <dominionofme> @PaulChaloner You misunderstand.
904186027673313280 2017-09-02 03:35:22 UTC <dominionofme> @PaulChaloner Those who regulate the integrity of the game do in fact have an influence on its success.
903623343198392321 2017-09-01 14:19:28 UTC <dominionofme> @PaulChaloner Rainbow6 Siege has a chance to be on there. But not with current ESL admins.
903482728040955935 2017-08-31 05:00:42 UTC <dominionofme> @rideatdawn You're filled with hate? Be honest more often! A better look. Maybe youll actually help us avoid Trumps and Clintons in the future.
903482066074865664 2017-08-31 04:58:05 UTC <dominionofme> @realDonaldTrump @impeach_d_trump anyone noticing its always one persons twitter account on the top trending? Like an echo chamber lmao... Sad world we livin in.

902257641921150976 2017-08-28 19:52:39 UTC <dominionofme> @NoahCRothman If I made money putting up hotels. I would think that I would try and put up a hotel anywhere and possibly in the most busy areas of earth?
902257160238882816 2017-08-28 19:50:44 UTC <dominionofme> @ericgarland Wow you people are so informed. Let me get my tin foil hat so I can keep up with you conspiracy theorist! You would make Alex Jones proud.
902256545009938436 2017-08-28 19:48:18 UTC <dominionofme> Ya I'd stfu too. Later
902256025637670912 2017-08-28 19:46:14 UTC <dominionofme> And you have a good day on youtube. Funny how you can see endless videos of Antifa attacking people, but rarely anyone attacking them first.
902255522816163840 2017-08-28 19:44:14 UTC <dominionofme> People with low IQ's convince themselves of whatever they want. I could care less what you think I'm entitled to cupcake, I just enjoy facts

902197540355006467 2017-08-28 15:53:50 UTC <dominionofme> Actions speak louder than titles or words. Can you not wrap your head around this? I know its hard #ironyofAntifa
902187396321738752 2017-08-28 15:13:31 UTC <dominionofme> @kinsellawarren Thats like saying there is no such thing as irony. These people are being abundantly ironic with their actions & views towards us.
902187014782640128 2017-08-28 15:12:00 UTC <dominionofme> @__seetee If Donald Trump is lying about making america great again, millions of us really do believe the "antifa" is ironically a bunch of fascist.
