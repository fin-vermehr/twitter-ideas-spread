959986454008131584 2018-02-03 03:06:20 UTC <Sugarrun22> @Elise_Jordan You used it in a way to imply he was not capable of understanding the complexities that his congressional seat requires.  Disappointing that you cant own it.
959800697662459905 2018-02-03 14:48:13 UTC <Sugarrun22> what did @Elise_Jordan mean by Devin Nunes is just a dairy farmer.  Is that somehow intellectually inferior to a coastal elite, Yale graduate,and now just an opinionated political commentator?  So arrogant.  Still cant understand how Trump won the election???? @Sugarrun22
959245040739635201 2018-02-01 02:00:14 UTC <Sugarrun22> @Elise_Jordan what exactly did you mean when U said that Devin Nunes was JUST a dairy farmer on Morning Joe?  Is it impossible that a dairy farmer could have an equal intellect as a coastal elite that attended Yale.  Still wondering why Trump is President?  Arrogance at its best
957947473204535296 2018-01-29 12:04:10 UTC <Sugarrun22> @SenEdwardsVA @GregHabeeb @ChrisHurstVA @nickrushva jump on this momentum to improve 81.

956303528607219714 2018-01-24 23:11:43 UTC <Sugarrun22> @japrovo I'm all for immigration but we need to enforce the rule of law.  And again, I'm for immigration!   If we don't like the laws in place then work to make them better.  Really a simple concept.
955843302447775744 2018-01-23 16:42:56 UTC <Sugarrun22> @GregHabeeb @SenEdwardsVA @ChrisHurstVA Thanks @MarkObenshain for recognizing the need to improve I-81.  I hope the NRV leadership @chrishurstVA , @nickrushva , @senedwardsva , @greghabeeb, and all representatives from Bristol to Winchester will get behind you.  This problem has been ignored for way too long!
