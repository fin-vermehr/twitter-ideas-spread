968370050980818944 2018-02-26 06:19:46 UTC <brightrobert7> @jockowillink @JT_Yearsley it goes back to who is supposed to own which failures and why
968369919254462464 2018-02-26 06:19:14 UTC <brightrobert7> @jockowillink @JT_Yearsley in non military words. Was he an empowered employee or just a crossing guard
968369673376067584 2018-02-26 06:18:16 UTC <brightrobert7> @jockowillink @JT_Yearsley not tactical, leadership. Deputy may have trained to breach. Did he train to make that decision though
968369179261890560 2018-02-26 06:16:18 UTC <brightrobert7> @jockowillink @JT_Yearsley 0430 hits in three hours, I'm hanging it up. Lots of ? Unanswered in all of this that need to be addressed tho
968368243583922177 2018-02-26 06:12:35 UTC <brightrobert7> @jockowillink @JT_Yearsley my point is who was leading. If can't depend on 1st responder to make the call it's lack of ownership handed down
968367330144251905 2018-02-26 06:08:57 UTC <brightrobert7> @jockowillink @JT_Yearsley w/o that leader those ppl "trained" failed. That's the problem
968367013352628224 2018-02-26 06:07:42 UTC <brightrobert7> @jockowillink @JT_Yearsley I think jocko said it best. A true leader on scene would have entered, and others would have followed
968366796951707648 2018-02-26 06:06:50 UTC <brightrobert7> @jockowillink @JT_Yearsley grab your balls all you want. I trained 2. I know what I think I would do. But easy said from behind a keyboard.
968365830810537985 2018-02-26 06:03:00 UTC <brightrobert7> @jockowillink this I agree with sir.
968364611551531009 2018-02-26 05:58:09 UTC <brightrobert7> @jockowillink his failures and that of his office on the reports on this kid far outweigh any failures on the parts of ppl in the field
968358882899787777 2018-02-26 05:35:23 UTC <brightrobert7> @jockowillink we would all like to think we would be the ones running into the building, but from your experience in battle how many of us would fail that test when faced with it?
968358602758123521 2018-02-26 05:34:16 UTC <brightrobert7> @jockowillink but a glorified crossing guard outside of the danger, no I wouldn't trust that person to do the heroic thing, because its only a portion of our population that would
968358289292611590 2018-02-26 05:33:02 UTC <brightrobert7> @jockowillink id trust a seasoned soldier to do the right thing, id trust a teacher within those walls armed to do the right thing, and id expect a parent of those kids to charge police barricades to enter in front of them
968357795744636934 2018-02-26 05:31:04 UTC <brightrobert7> @jockowillink has been tested to that envelope.  uncommon valor comes from uncommon people in extreme circumstances.  its also the situations that put people that are supposedly prepared for those circumstances at the greatest odds.
968357264749932544 2018-02-26 05:28:57 UTC <brightrobert7> @jockowillink I think the biggest question to ask.  Can you possibly train for the experience of an active shooter knowing children are being killed with a known response procedure.  Our elite military forces, yes I am sure they can.  a sheriff deputy assigned to school detail I doubt has been
968356219206492161 2018-02-26 05:24:48 UTC <brightrobert7> @jockowillink I appreciate all of this.  but is there a "fix it" to a situation that is not combat revelant in terms of shooting a soldier for retreat in the face of attack?  do you fire him?  retrain him?  socially and publicly humiliate a public servant who failed?
968287125014802432 2018-02-26 00:50:15 UTC <brightrobert7> @britneyspears I cant imagine what the hair and makeup people could have done other than sending you right back out the door.....JOB COMPLETE

957080721641877506 2018-01-26 02:40:00 UTC <brightrobert7> easy winner on wright st, but doesn't look like wisky is gonna get their share of the total by a longshot

955619479874138112 2018-01-22 01:53:33 UTC <brightrobert7> Got the under on the Carolina game, but another horrible performance by the heels dooms the side.
955570427769901057 2018-01-22 22:38:38 UTC <brightrobert7> @NoLimitSports17 lol, damn its early too
955531038171811841 2018-01-22 20:02:07 UTC <brightrobert7> @NoLimitSports17 I just looked at it after I finished my cbb and its at 5.5 and +190 now.  I wouldn't expect much change between now and then unless sig injury or arrest happens
955530414013190144 2018-01-22 19:59:38 UTC <brightrobert7> @NoLimitSports17 but I honestly think the better bet for this game might be the +3 1h.   cause no one can turn a fourth quarter around quite like Bardy does
955530221184266240 2018-01-22 19:58:52 UTC <brightrobert7> @NoLimitSports17 best line I could get was about two minutes after the game ended on 5dimes at +6 -110 and +200ml   on em both

946181694717128705 2017-12-27 00:51:09 UTC <brightrobert7> @Dave_Essler only factor I would give any lean to on Harrison is that he might have a better personal performance having a more intimate knowledge of how Ben will move when being pursued.  so individual sack prop or team sack bet on pats???
946181356534620161 2017-12-27 00:49:49 UTC <brightrobert7> @Dave_Essler steelers don't exactly do spectacular things on offense.  any normal d can keep their team in a game with them on a given day.  double on AB, pray JuJu doesn't get wide open, and then have seven guys ready to get punished by Bell
946180437763817472 2017-12-27 00:46:10 UTC <brightrobert7> @Dave_Essler not enough to offset the sale of points on the revenge loss angle the books will exploit.  so 1-1.5 pt for Harrison vs the 2-3 on the "revenge thing"

941110754761158658 2017-12-13 01:01:03 UTC <brightrobert7> @NoLimitSports17 just a shame. I expected a better game but that first ten minutes took owls breath away
941110593544687616 2017-12-13 01:00:25 UTC <brightrobert7> @NoLimitSports17 I have to go to work in a few anyway. Bought back most of the side with 2h bet on nova -1. Total should be safe
941107445102972928 2017-12-13 00:47:54 UTC <brightrobert7> Nova crushing it so far

940932686444748805 2017-12-13 13:13:28 UTC <brightrobert7> @shylove very generous and kind of you though
940932597319905280 2017-12-13 13:13:07 UTC <brightrobert7> @shylove if you offered to buy me groceries I'd cook you a helluva meal, but sadly the person in ur encounter wasn't after food

940571266590937088 2017-12-12 13:17:19 UTC <brightrobert7> @KirkHerbstreit That's how spirit airlines charges for baggage, and believe it or not people pay extra to ensure they carry on.  Too many horror stories of arriving somewhere w/o your belongings and being screwed

939969153217200134 2017-12-10 21:24:44 UTC <brightrobert7> @Dave_Essler after today I think flipping coins would have been more productive
939967396105908225 2017-12-10 21:17:45 UTC <brightrobert7> Yep, that seals that second half under......fucking kickers
939961794126336000 2017-12-10 20:55:30 UTC <brightrobert7> Vikes not scoring a full seven there is really going to screw them

939941555103764480 2017-12-10 19:35:04 UTC <brightrobert7> @NoLimitSports17 thanks..visibility aside I think the colts get shut out
939941203474132993 2017-12-10 19:33:40 UTC <brightrobert7> love these refs dictating games with their blind ass guess work on what qualifies as a catch
939940855514849280 2017-12-10 19:32:17 UTC <brightrobert7> @NoLimitSports17 I figured that late touchdown would throw you off.  I already had my mind up whether they scored or not I was going under on anything priced decent higher than 10

936322906497454081 2017-11-30 19:55:51 UTC <brightrobert7> @SaraJayXXX this is where the base for that confidence must be built, by shedding light on the fact that it has always been wrong

936037066437165057 2017-11-29 01:00:02 UTC <brightrobert7> @NoLimitSports17 got me laid but didn't get the threesome
936036681085607936 2017-11-29 00:58:30 UTC <brightrobert7> @NoLimitSports17 your sister's hot
936036350100373504 2017-11-29 00:57:11 UTC <brightrobert7> @cbfowler @Lane_Kiffin who cares how it tastes, their missiles might hit that rock but will never reach #FAU
936008235093553153 2017-11-29 23:05:28 UTC <brightrobert7> @Bet_Labs hardly, geno is at least a five point handicap
936008025650991109 2017-11-29 23:04:38 UTC <brightrobert7> @EveLaurence Stupid lucky bicycle with your stationary wheels and cute little bell
936002923489824772 2017-11-29 22:44:21 UTC <brightrobert7> @BreakdownSheets looks like its all state level governed so everywhere is probably a bit different.  The harassment in workplace appears to be more of a civil matter than criminal unless it escalates to criminal level, whatev that means
936001529668128768 2017-11-29 22:38:49 UTC <brightrobert7> @BreakdownSheets I actually had to google this.  state of NY sexual harassment (criminal charge) has to be filed within 3 years if you can believe that.
935999973992386560 2017-11-29 22:32:38 UTC <brightrobert7> @BreakdownSheets or ten years, or fifteen years.  I do have to ? what kind of statute of limitations exist or need to be changed for these claims with regards to criminal/civil court judgements
935994009306259457 2017-11-29 22:08:56 UTC <brightrobert7> @Vol_Football you know, instead of chasing after every coach on the list like a ten dollar hooker flagging down every passing car
935993820445073409 2017-11-29 22:08:11 UTC <brightrobert7> Maybe @Vol_Football  should take a rest on this coaching search, repaint their rock and let a head coach come to them
935990674461286401 2017-11-29 21:55:41 UTC <brightrobert7> @DesmondHoward Auburn, because Malzahn's a freak and probably spent his kid's birthday already game planning for OU

935645190869733377 2017-11-28 23:02:51 UTC <brightrobert7> @NoLimitSports17 if the numbers don't match what I have, its a play.  I don't care if its philly school of the death versus the pretzel vendors

935619690432466945 2017-11-28 21:21:31 UTC <brightrobert7> @T1DadCapO @NoLimitSports17 give him the headset and the clipboard right where hes at, he wont do a worse job than whats been happening
935617934206078976 2017-11-28 21:14:33 UTC <brightrobert7> and here we go again @5Dimes site down again with an internal error
935616317520076801 2017-11-28 21:08:07 UTC <brightrobert7> @NoLimitSports17 @T1DadCapO the only way I could justify this is if McDooDoo and Eli secretly made an agreement that it was in Eli's best interest not to play to avoid injury on a lost season
935616071079464961 2017-11-28 21:07:08 UTC <brightrobert7> @NoLimitSports17 @T1DadCapO this idiot actually thinks qb play is the problem the giants are facing?  moron

934891791312130048 2017-11-26 21:09:07 UTC <brightrobert7> the game was unwatchable enough @NFL for fux sake can we stop these celebrations already?
934890532379258881 2017-11-26 21:04:07 UTC <brightrobert7> maybe save the stupid dance for AFTER the booth review lol.  jackass @Eagles
934885202752626689 2017-11-26 20:42:56 UTC <brightrobert7> bears ineptitude is going to cost me the over on this game.  do I really have to count on the eagles for all 44 points? #toomuchtoask
934881194709340161 2017-11-26 20:27:00 UTC <brightrobert7> ill give the eagles credit.  they sure can score.  by pass, by rush, by fumble
934880668710068225 2017-11-26 20:24:55 UTC <brightrobert7> @HouseOfSparky @Tonis_The_Tiger Right, so the new coach will embrace the current culture and keep the assistants, but the admin wants change?  this sounds like a plan
934879782638059520 2017-11-26 20:21:24 UTC <brightrobert7> my only complaint for the day is KC underachieving so badly against the bills.  can we start calling for the Reid firing now?

934831988686585856 2017-11-26 17:11:29 UTC <brightrobert7> seriously @5Dimes , update your servers so it doesn't take 15 tries on a sunday morning to place wagers.  this is pathetic
934826627997093888 2017-11-26 16:50:11 UTC <brightrobert7> in weeks 1-3 90% of the games were lined between pk and 3pts.  now we've got three games that fall near that
934826231597600768 2017-11-26 16:48:36 UTC <brightrobert7> is there a record for number of NFL games lined 7 points or higher?

933924061419327488 2017-11-23 05:03:42 UTC <brightrobert7> no shit, I got no love for him or the team hes coaching but if they couldn't make something out so many opportunities then that shit team should carry the weight of the failure just as much.
933923741184221184 2017-11-23 05:02:26 UTC <brightrobert7> @SportsRadioWIP @Bease11 @NoLimitSports17 @howardeskin @dak is undercoached and fucked by a team without discipline.  he may not be the next peyton manning but his value is so diminished playing in dallas
933922967863595008 2017-11-23 04:59:21 UTC <brightrobert7> if the fucking @Giants could fuck up anything its blowing a 7 point spread like that.  don't #firemcadoo  they deserve the punishment for another season

933521943457878017 2017-11-22 02:25:49 UTC <brightrobert7> @RobertThePurks Interesting...I wonder if they file for unemployment like other non-permanent work forces?  state prosecutors should look at filing lawsuits to recoup the money they would have to pay out of UE funds

929054830416531456 2017-11-10 18:35:07 UTC <brightrobert7> @FezzikSports and considering your play is dependent on TWO teams, is it really fair to base this off of a reaction of what ONE team might do?  maybe Stanford team total under for the 1h would fit your line of bullshit better?
929054398940110848 2017-11-10 18:33:24 UTC <brightrobert7> @FezzikSports maybe add "the best chances of cashing an under is at the beginning because both teams start with zero points" to make it based in some factual data
929053912270884864 2017-11-10 18:31:28 UTC <brightrobert7> @FezzikSports any statistical evidence for this or are we just going with bland generic statements as supporting arguments?

923275197725233152 2017-10-25 19:48:55 UTC <brightrobert7> welp, one run ruined a night for me last night.  here we go again 903 Houston Astros* -1 +170  903 Houston Astros* -103
923273106487173121 2017-10-25 19:40:36 UTC <brightrobert7> @the_jada_fire three holes to be precise
923272891319422976 2017-10-25 19:39:45 UTC <brightrobert7> @ABC another racist costume.  doesn't this cracker know when they lynched black people they used TREES to hang them from?  I'm calling Al now
922882428116570112 2017-10-24 17:48:11 UTC <brightrobert7> @NoLimitSports17 Thanks, that's the way I was seeing it.  Hope it holds!
922877660677726208 2017-10-24 17:29:15 UTC <brightrobert7> @NoLimitSports17 and kershaws post season stats are really unimpressive.  itll be on the dodgers bats to win this game.   starting to rethink my under lol
922877156325240833 2017-10-24 17:27:14 UTC <brightrobert7> @NickMcIlwain1 youre a powerfully keen observer and master of the oblivious
922876433323749378 2017-10-24 17:24:22 UTC <brightrobert7> @NoLimitSports17 but if they are going to win this series they have to get an away win and Keuchel may be the best chance they have even facing Kersh
922876277941555202 2017-10-24 17:23:45 UTC <brightrobert7> @NoLimitSports17 probably a good strategy.  I think I'm nuts backing a team that's winless on the road in the playoffs

918451060783673344 2017-10-12 12:19:31 UTC <brightrobert7> @RobertThePurks I shouldve been more specific about that 5.5, every total is priced +105 or worse.  even compared to 2 days ago when 5.5 was +110 or better
918435649480548352 2017-10-12 11:18:17 UTC <brightrobert7> blind betting the past three days has been profitable (not great, but +money)

827269421739618310 2017-02-02 21:36:14 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets is it really inclusion or is it more along the lines of specialized recognition   ie. observance of sharia laws
827268317471649792 2017-02-02 21:31:51 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets It has defined an entire class of voters here in the united states somehow.  among other falsely assigned definitions albeit

826457186264109056 2017-01-31 15:48:42 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets ignorance is bliss for too many.  i dont have to know "what" may be up, i go about my life assuming something is regardless
826456877655531521 2017-01-31 15:47:29 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets any solid leader (ie Gen Mattis) will tell you that the threat is always real, even when there is no threat to begin with
826456273906442240 2017-01-31 15:45:05 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets never gave a crap for threat levels, i think those are just a gimmick to toy with the population
826454928814112768 2017-01-31 15:39:44 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets pissing on the shoes of people who are helping to police their own communities
826454826338902017 2017-01-31 15:39:20 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets so i get where some of this does cross loyalty with allies we have, and #DJT shoulda made clearer how this was going to work b4
826454592011505664 2017-01-31 15:38:24 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets his family is housed in US for safety and now he is worried the travel ban will mean he cant come to see them.
826454387883143168 2017-01-31 15:37:35 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets saw a story last night on the top Iraqi general fighting ISIS
826454130130563072 2017-01-31 15:36:34 UTC <brightrobert7> @shylove but lying on camera to the audience about it is ok?  guess thats why its called acting
826448386542931972 2017-01-31 15:13:44 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets no doubt.  "snitches get stitches" can be translated in any language
826447318878650368 2017-01-31 15:09:30 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets and that extends beyond Muslim pops, inner city hoods like chicago could take a good lesson from that as well
826447085440479232 2017-01-31 15:08:34 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets couldnt agree more, police your own or you force us to do it

826301103658647552 2017-01-30 05:28:29 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets its so easy said axl rose.  when its in everyone elses backyard you can have any attitude you want about it

801165073381064704 2016-11-22 20:46:53 UTC <brightrobert7> if the vols couldnt get it in two quarters, ot surely wont be their friend.  lets hope im wrong
801141609806954496 2016-11-22 19:13:38 UTC <brightrobert7> @NLSports17 thank you for the kind words my friend, hope to take it to them early and often
801141393053847552 2016-11-22 19:12:47 UTC <brightrobert7> This may sound nuts, but i really dont want the vols ahead at halftime.  that could bring the wrath of the duck and blow our line up 2H
801128088625029120 2016-11-22 18:19:55 UTC <brightrobert7> the only real downside to betting volume is catching the best number and being on the right side of line moves suffers greatly

801105792464134144 2016-11-22 16:51:19 UTC <brightrobert7> @SethMacFarlane no need to get down on Lassard, he may not be the sharpest apple, but when it came down to it he handled biz
801093753016610816 2016-11-22 16:03:28 UTC <brightrobert7> @brightrobert7 thats good enough to rival with the top spot in the Westgate contest with only 2 extra games logged
801092541852434432 2016-11-22 15:58:40 UTC <brightrobert7> Current NFL season record isnt too shabby.  I probably jinxed myself by looking at it lol NFL  34-17-0  66.67%  1505.00 units by PG tracking
801085650095091718 2016-11-22 15:31:17 UTC <brightrobert7> common denominator in most of these isnt the offenses, its that Red Raider defense (or lack of)https://twitter.com/SportsInsights/status/801081647751950336

800925286313377792 2016-11-21 04:54:03 UTC <brightrobert7> @brightrobert7 took it at 7 and it cost me a win. Lucky to push and catch my team total
800925103542468608 2016-11-21 04:53:19 UTC <brightrobert7> I should've just taken the -5.5 earlier today but was too wrapped in basketball

800777365429358592 2016-11-21 19:06:16 UTC <brightrobert7> when its cold and windy and theres a shitty MNF game, only thing that makes it better is gonna be an #icehouse steak boli

800739462292455424 2016-11-21 16:35:39 UTC <brightrobert7> @brightrobert7 is so bad you cant even hit your ratings marks in your home market?
800739349046366209 2016-11-21 16:35:12 UTC <brightrobert7> obviously the NFL planned which teams they wanted to market south of the border, but is it really that important when your league wide prod
800738509346762752 2016-11-21 16:31:52 UTC <brightrobert7> @NLSports17 they can practice field goals kicking over Trumps wall

785877939720040448 2016-10-11 16:21:16 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets @MarcInThe909 i think it depends how far he goes, certainly wont get drilled early and often.  dodger rl mini and nats ml game?

785877185844215808 2016-10-11 16:18:16 UTC <brightrobert7> @NLSports17 i may throw a very small amount at nats on the hinge that dodgers are making a mistake going this route, EPO type betting

784780412987990016 2016-10-08 15:40:05 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets that these are the best two options we could come up with, and the media and party rules that prevent 3rd options are the most

783011535274795009 2016-10-03 18:31:12 UTC <brightrobert7> @NLSports17 its odd.  even the touts are quiet today.  wouldve expected some sales pitches on GOY and shit to be going around
783009823357071364 2016-10-03 18:24:24 UTC <brightrobert7> the utter silence on twitter in regards to #MNF is surprising, has the league's product diminished that much in the past 5 yrs?  i think so

781859583841169408 2016-09-30 14:13:45 UTC <brightrobert7> @MyRayVeness never really saw the big deal of it. but people like to focus on little things instead of seeing the bigger picture i guess

781505810627174400 2016-09-29 14:47:59 UTC <brightrobert7> @TomiLahren hard to believe she would have the nerve to make this kind of attack unless shes so delusional that she thinks she womens savior
781479642398072836 2016-09-29 13:04:00 UTC <brightrobert7> @thickSLICING nah, can buff that out.  probably
781234303199961088 2016-09-28 20:49:07 UTC <brightrobert7> @amiezin business as usual sadly
781160663301390336 2016-09-28 15:56:30 UTC <brightrobert7> @VividRadioSXM @ChristyCanyon11 where does the old sears catalog with the lingerie photos fall in that category?
781159626129670144 2016-09-28 15:52:22 UTC <brightrobert7> @HillaryClinton didnt your husband blow his load on his secretary in the oval office, but you supported his presidency?
781159072036950016 2016-09-28 15:50:10 UTC <brightrobert7> @diannaESPN @SportsCenter guess its better than a day job
781157994922934272 2016-09-28 15:45:53 UTC <brightrobert7> @EveLaurence congrats.  did she make it down to evaluating the jay-jay?
781154262143406080 2016-09-28 15:31:03 UTC <brightrobert7> @NLSports17 Better move west buddy, i think your under attack out there lol

780833572605325312 2016-09-27 18:16:45 UTC <brightrobert7> @SBNationCFB so true about it not being a good nooner, a game this ugly should be at 3am like drunk sex with the practice girl
780806743664238592 2016-09-27 16:30:09 UTC <brightrobert7> @JulieDiCaro @giuff11 clinton is deceptive for purpose, premeditated and planned lies with the intent of concealing what shes really up to
780806434955067392 2016-09-27 16:28:55 UTC <brightrobert7> @JulieDiCaro @giuff11 sort of.  Trump lies like a used car salesman.  its blatant, obvious, and if you expect it it does no harm
780793118371241984 2016-09-27 15:36:00 UTC <brightrobert7> @thickSLICING i thought i heard her gasping "im dying" at one point, does this count?
780788676808826881 2016-09-27 15:18:21 UTC <brightrobert7> @JulieDiCaro stupid outrageous lies of a loud mouth clown easily fact checked and dismissed. more worried of over-prepared manipulative lies
780786889234210816 2016-09-27 15:11:15 UTC <brightrobert7> @thickSLICING in the teens somewhere.  11 or something
780786491790327809 2016-09-27 15:09:40 UTC <brightrobert7> @thickSLICING three, the NBA lady made it to
780784838093725697 2016-09-27 15:03:06 UTC <brightrobert7> @JulieDiCaro yes, id much prefer seamless lies and pre-planned action with ulterior motives running the country
780763988229488644 2016-09-27 13:40:15 UTC <brightrobert7> @LoriGreiner 1,5,7
780762221597102080 2016-09-27 13:33:14 UTC <brightrobert7> @EveLaurence i know, it just got me thinking what ill do when my eyes start aging and i have to face going back to wearing glasses.
780761318936743937 2016-09-27 13:29:38 UTC <brightrobert7> @EveLaurence besides, girls can pull off glasses with just about any look so if anything its another accessory for your wardrobe
780761121884102656 2016-09-27 13:28:51 UTC <brightrobert7> @EveLaurence well i would cert hope not.  u probably couldnt get the surgery unless your eyes went that bad suddenly.  small corrections nbd
780752736736468992 2016-09-27 12:55:32 UTC <brightrobert7> @EveLaurence and it wasnt the eyesight that really made the diff.  it was the boost in confidence.  i truly became a diff person
780752548462530560 2016-09-27 12:54:47 UTC <brightrobert7> @EveLaurence laser surgery was the greatest thing in my life.  went from being dorky blind kid in HS to 20/10 vision overnight.
780562392275091456 2016-09-26 00:19:11 UTC <brightrobert7> @MyRayVeness how much for a picnic in the park?  Don't #urbandictionary it, wasn't dirty

780540098320314369 2016-09-26 22:50:35 UTC <brightrobert7> @realDonaldTrump so your tweets may make some sense for once?
780526467448909825 2016-09-26 21:56:25 UTC <brightrobert7> @EveLaurence see, thats all you should say.  wish i could work for ten years and "retire"
780526273449889792 2016-09-26 21:55:39 UTC <brightrobert7> @EveLaurence y do u have to answer?  you turned a job into career, and then moved 2 new project in life.  ppl stuck on what you used 2 do
780447138702618624 2016-09-26 16:41:12 UTC <brightrobert7> @TheBriefing2016 @HillaryClinton this debate is like two monkeys flinging shit at each other, i took my kids to the zoo yesterday so no thx

778996894370557952 2016-09-22 16:38:27 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets short work week and prep time.  falls on the coaches IMO.  good focused staff will get results
778968409660948480 2016-09-22 14:45:16 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets keep that wife happy buddy
778692833708421124 2016-09-21 20:30:13 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets easter bunny throwing eggs at santa claus is a decent mental pic as well
778691907849375744 2016-09-21 20:26:32 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets its like watching santa claus say theres no such thing as the tooth fairy lol
778687135930908672 2016-09-21 20:07:35 UTC <brightrobert7> @FezzikSports @thickSLICING he fires like a fourteen year old boy that just learned how to masturbate
778686519355650048 2016-09-21 20:05:08 UTC <brightrobert7> Just gonna give this a lil bump in the tweet deck and see where it goeshttps://twitter.com/tgeorgesports/status/778679446219788288
778609877136605184 2016-09-21 15:00:35 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets root causes?  sure, lol.  the former?  not so much
778609276399026176 2016-09-21 14:58:12 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets im not giving up hope for all society, but im damn close
778608179219427328 2016-09-21 14:53:50 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets the ratio of balls to brain is definitely edging out these kids using their smarts
778607967985864706 2016-09-21 14:53:00 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets still a dangerous area to this day, but it quelled the worst of the violence that summer
778607831847211008 2016-09-21 14:52:27 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets state police moved in partnered with every city cop.  curfew citywide was enacted and enforced.
778607619376283648 2016-09-21 14:51:36 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets i remember a few years back the city of Chester went into a state of emergency for about 8 weeks
778607336034144256 2016-09-21 14:50:29 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets agreed, and i think thats the problem.  the deterrent isnt working anymore. how much higher do we raise the stakes?
778606983654105088 2016-09-21 14:49:05 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets holding a weapon will be considered an enemy combatant?
778606898891358209 2016-09-21 14:48:45 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets eventually it will come to what level the deterrent needs to be.  do we treat it as active war zone and declare anyone
778606460427264000 2016-09-21 14:47:00 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets same thing that pushes us on our betting, if pot commit is 10 years, then why not risk life or death to get away
778606235272765440 2016-09-21 14:46:06 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets i would disagree. at some point you heighten the sentence to a point where the kid will say "i might as well pull the trigger"
778605069034029060 2016-09-21 14:41:28 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets this is like when you get black mold in a building.  little spots.  you give it time to take root and grow and watch out
778604818889838593 2016-09-21 14:40:29 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets i cant speak with 1sthand on toronto, but i can say chicago also has an ingrained history of violence. this isnt new there
778602051928518656 2016-09-21 14:29:29 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets poverty, street gangs, plethora of "illegally obtained" firearms, lack of legally obtained firearms, and corrupt police

771403684886540288 2016-09-01 17:45:45 UTC <brightrobert7> @ChrisLoesch @rockingcoyote i think that would be targeting a specific group of people which is def lawsuit worthy and wrong.
771402123233951744 2016-09-01 17:39:32 UTC <brightrobert7> @Mizzou @NRA @R_Rated_Musik @brakinggnus still chuckling at extension, if the school itself had that rule in place then i would agree 100%
771400732369162240 2016-09-01 17:34:01 UTC <brightrobert7> @Mizzou @R_Rated_Musik @_jbarker being on the team is not a right
771400562432671744 2016-09-01 17:33:20 UTC <brightrobert7> @Mizzou @R_Rated_Musik @_jbarker if you join something voluntarily then its assumed you are going to follow whatever rules are in place
771399860922748928 2016-09-01 17:30:33 UTC <brightrobert7> @Mizzou @NRA @R_Rated_Musik @brakinggnus and coaches give rule books that you are expected to adhere to when you agree to join their program
771399714369658880 2016-09-01 17:29:58 UTC <brightrobert7> @Mizzou @NRA @R_Rated_Musik @brakinggnus and you probably are given a book of rules they expect you to adhere to while a student there
771398297827348480 2016-09-01 17:24:20 UTC <brightrobert7> @Mizzou @NRA @ArlingtonSteve if your of legal age to consume im pretty sure it falls under some sort of right. 21A i believe
771397477392064512 2016-09-01 17:21:05 UTC <brightrobert7> @Mizzou @NRA @ArlingtonSteve ok, ill retract that one
771397184826802176 2016-09-01 17:19:55 UTC <brightrobert7> @Mizzou @NRA @ArlingtonSteve pretty sure that has happened before too, what about a coach banning drinking alcohol during season?
771395731945119745 2016-09-01 17:14:08 UTC <brightrobert7> @Mizzou @NRA @ArlingtonSteve the co i work for doesnt allow weapons in their office.  I like my job, hence i do not bring my weapon to work
771395562742640640 2016-09-01 17:13:28 UTC <brightrobert7> @Mizzou @NRA @ArlingtonSteve no one is actually being deprived of their rights is what you are missing here
771394963045310464 2016-09-01 17:11:05 UTC <brightrobert7> @Mizzou @NRA @R_Rated_Musik @brakinggnus that first ones funny.  ask @BYU if their non mormon students have to abide by mormon rules
771394634689945600 2016-09-01 17:09:47 UTC <brightrobert7> @Mizzou @NRA @ArlingtonSteve im sure they would, but the coach isnt doing that
771391559828926468 2016-09-01 16:57:34 UTC <brightrobert7> @thickSLICING @LearnedDoc he really should shave one of those things
771390179894493184 2016-09-01 16:52:05 UTC <brightrobert7> @Mizzou @NRA @R_Rated_Musik correct.  Not owning/possessing a handgun is the team rule

769580039214096384 2016-08-27 16:59:14 UTC <brightrobert7> @Spreadapedia whats more concerning these touts think they have an "edge" on these games?  only if you live local and know the programs
769579715992649728 2016-08-27 16:57:57 UTC <brightrobert7> @Spreadapedia I think it was just for the first weekend.  they did it last year too but only a couple games at certain points in the season

769235532442378240 2016-08-26 18:10:17 UTC <brightrobert7> @NLSports17 this is true. but more important than that.  you arent masquerading anything like a mutual fund or minimalizing the true risk

769233654342123520 2016-08-26 18:02:49 UTC <brightrobert7> @NLSports17 $5k minimum "investment", its no more legitimate than paying $700 for a season package and placing the bets yourself

767052280923172864 2016-08-20 17:34:49 UTC <brightrobert7> @Matt_Rod21 gotta get back to the yard work.  I see the late games are finally up on 5dimes.  ill be back later and post anything I put in
767051916144619520 2016-08-20 17:33:22 UTC <brightrobert7> @Matt_Rod21 I didn't bet the west matchup game, again because chula was too expensive, but I was shocked they lost outright
767051721734393856 2016-08-20 17:32:36 UTC <brightrobert7> @Matt_Rod21 still plenty of time...look at what Canada did to my under 12.5 yesterday
767051583506886656 2016-08-20 17:32:03 UTC <brightrobert7> @Matt_Rod21 that was probably the best bet available, because with the rl around 6 or so you almost have to get the tt over to cover that
767051218350768128 2016-08-20 17:30:36 UTC <brightrobert7> @Matt_Rod21 at -140  you have to be willing to risk the juice to make money.  and it is what is, cause no way backing Italy is an option
767050808483459072 2016-08-20 17:28:58 UTC <brightrobert7> @Matt_Rod21 some people may bet numbers like that. but paying -750 or whatever mexico was is out of the question.  and I think the RL was 6?
767050023456546816 2016-08-20 17:25:51 UTC <brightrobert7> @Matt_Rod21 not skewed in a way that either side is being taken advantage of.  just so high priced its most of the bets I wont even consider

757568998879920129 2016-07-25 13:31:38 UTC <brightrobert7> @My_NameAintEarl if anything they will have more supporters in the street which may be more what they are prepping for is a bigger turnout
757568802813018112 2016-07-25 13:30:52 UTC <brightrobert7> @My_NameAintEarl road closures pretty identical. i remember the protests and cops were pretty heated.  doubt it will be that bad this time
757567291924111360 2016-07-25 13:24:51 UTC <brightrobert7> @My_NameAintEarl no doubt
757566302445854720 2016-07-25 13:20:56 UTC <brightrobert7> @My_NameAintEarl and if you were talking Philly, its run by democrats so makes sense to hold it where a good turnout on the street

755588667968778241 2016-07-19 02:22:31 UTC <brightrobert7> @Dave_Essler gross generalizations. Keystone of epic in depth capping my friend!
755462989294084097 2016-07-19 18:03:07 UTC <brightrobert7> @Dave_Essler the famous mathmagician Bernie Madoff may have had a hand in formulating the conversion
755462752853000193 2016-07-19 18:02:10 UTC <brightrobert7> @Dave_Essler i think it goes -EV when the wind is involved, as it pushes the rain against the ball.  the proper formula is -EV=WR squared
755453944822919168 2016-07-19 17:27:10 UTC <brightrobert7> @Dave_Essler scientifically we cap it by drops per hour and not inches of rainfall, makes us more effective capping touts

755225236128358400 2016-07-18 02:18:22 UTC <brightrobert7> @Spreadapedia I don't think he can blanket pardon past events without stating or absolving specific crimes
755225017324015616 2016-07-18 02:17:30 UTC <brightrobert7> @Spreadapedia I think the crimes have to be spelled out specifically of what was committed.

722784988677033984 2016-04-20 13:52:24 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets pretty sure those go as night games, just an earlier start time for broadcast purposes
722782661412921345 2016-04-20 13:43:09 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets i thinks its the 6pm-7pm starts.  arent the 3:30-4:05 starts considered matinee or day games?

707230076140720129 2016-03-08 15:42:44 UTC <brightrobert7> @Dave_Essler there is great divide between finding angles to play and creating edges that dont really exist
707229884347785217 2016-03-08 15:41:58 UTC <brightrobert7> @Dave_Essler no sir, i will stick to teams i am familiar enough with, though it will likely be a crapshoot
707229652323049472 2016-03-08 15:41:03 UTC <brightrobert7> @Dave_Essler clearly dont WANT to, and forcing a play precludes finding some minute angle and propping it up as a play.

705632946686787584 2016-03-03 05:56:19 UTC <brightrobert7> WOW!  squeezed Drake by the hook but got another winner.  Congrats @NLWagerTalk hitting the big one tonight
705597181416308737 2016-03-03 03:34:12 UTC <brightrobert7> Boston and Seattle get it done, save the mariners letting the rl slip through their grasp with that 3 run hiccup in the ninth

705551242567745536 2016-03-03 00:31:39 UTC <brightrobert7> @KendallRogersD1 i think if clemson can survive the top of cocks order they can squeeze at least one win in the series
705548020323098626 2016-03-03 00:18:51 UTC <brightrobert7> perhaps that mariners rl was pushing it, but still picked up the winner on the ml

704306465931190273 2016-02-29 14:05:21 UTC <brightrobert7> @igglez73 well the only other way to level the competition is have the pro teams do spinny bat drills while playing
704305159615221760 2016-02-29 14:00:10 UTC <brightrobert7> @igglez73 definitely different in that aspect.  i wonder if they let the college kids use metal bats lol
704295922663071744 2016-02-29 13:23:27 UTC <brightrobert7> @igglez73 they always theorize about cfb and pro team matchups, but bases is the only time ive seen it actually done
704295765682819072 2016-02-29 13:22:50 UTC <brightrobert7> @igglez73 agents, bookies, pro scouts and coaches, plus a game where one team is being paid and another is not
704291198819823620 2016-02-29 13:04:41 UTC <brightrobert7> @igglez73 you would think ncaa wouldnt allow its athletes to play against paid players just because of the exposure risks
704291011430916096 2016-02-29 13:03:56 UTC <brightrobert7> @igglez73 i never understood who benefits more from a college team playing pro baseball players, even if they are AAA scrubs
704289888682811392 2016-02-29 12:59:29 UTC <brightrobert7> @igglez73 this week the mlb/college scrimmages take over so likely not too many plays this week

702906668045234176 2016-02-25 17:23:03 UTC <brightrobert7> @igglez73 the price is as important as the line when you playing high volume

702740329880035328 2016-02-24 06:22:05 UTC <brightrobert7> @LetItRide81 funny story. Made a good chunk of change betting it in Olympics last go round
702708352447553536 2016-02-24 04:15:01 UTC <brightrobert7> @GregShaker unlabeled mock GOM. Tried to emulate fezziks BS ohio release from other day
702707909776515072 2016-02-24 04:13:16 UTC <brightrobert7> @NLWagerTalk #degens need a #generac lol

702706921451687940 2016-02-24 04:09:20 UTC <brightrobert7> @NLWagerTalk duck n cover brother
702706861573840896 2016-02-24 04:09:06 UTC <brightrobert7> @NLWagerTalk finally went over us here a bit ago. It's over philly proper now and it is legit
702706601778610176 2016-02-24 04:08:04 UTC <brightrobert7> @CizzlingSports @Dave_Essler @TheKostos @ChrisO47 @WheresKernan @nypost the importance of any kind of community is correcting itself

702697276469149697 2016-02-24 03:31:00 UTC <brightrobert7> what i saidhttps://twitter.com/d1baseball/status/702697155241361408
702697183892492288 2016-02-24 03:30:38 UTC <brightrobert7> @KendallRogersD1 jackets looked ripe for it but didnt put southern on the card tonight, lost opportunities
702696284122001408 2016-02-24 03:27:04 UTC <brightrobert7> and we get Aggies by the c-hair 11-0 win.  sweep on the bases tonight!
702693929695576064 2016-02-24 03:17:42 UTC <brightrobert7> i knew that rutgers series was not evidence, miami baseball definitely with some weak linkshttps://twitter.com/d1baseball/status/702693563352653826
702683368962404352 2016-02-24 02:35:45 UTC <brightrobert7> @LSUsoftball gets the win tonight as a +275 dog in the fight
702682318259916800 2016-02-24 02:31:34 UTC <brightrobert7> @Dave_Essler @XavierMBB if anyone shouldve known better about backing @NovaMBB i should have

702650491499511808 2016-02-24 00:25:06 UTC <brightrobert7> arkansas -10.5 winner...1 down 2 to go
702648815703044096 2016-02-24 00:18:26 UTC <brightrobert7> @FezzikSports wouldnt it be a little less cruel to just refund to whatever anal subscribers you have left?

702536417491062784 2016-02-24 16:51:49 UTC <brightrobert7> almost pulled the trigger on Winthrop at +260, but even if SC only scores 4 runs theres a good chance they get a shut out

702343293774995456 2016-02-23 04:04:24 UTC <brightrobert7> anyways, a somber anniversary of the flag raising at Iwo.  Semper Fi to the @USMC out there, thank you
702342825736802307 2016-02-23 04:02:33 UTC <brightrobert7> watching these last living WWII vets on AHC being interviewed.  80 years old and these tough bastards would probably still kick some ass
702342540704550912 2016-02-23 04:01:25 UTC <brightrobert7> @NLWagerTalk thats the kinda numbers i like to hear!  thanks
702340016249430016 2016-02-23 03:51:23 UTC <brightrobert7> @NLWagerTalk happens, id still never bet vandy to shop on the road and win outright, 10 times out of 10
702336106956791808 2016-02-23 03:35:51 UTC <brightrobert7> @NLWagerTalk id have expected a line of -2 to -3, i think by tomorrow nova will be favored.  if it doesnt move, then we know im screwed lol
702335255148175361 2016-02-23 03:32:28 UTC <brightrobert7> my parody of a GOM tragedy backfired.  one for tomorrow Nova +1 -110
702334599389646848 2016-02-23 03:29:51 UTC <brightrobert7> @NLWagerTalk son of a bitch, line came out nova +1.  guess that mock GOM is gonna be a play after all
702311265243369474 2016-02-23 01:57:08 UTC <brightrobert7> @FezzikSports called it right Steve! nicely done.  spread was never a factor!!!  FOCUS
702287163241721857 2016-02-23 00:21:22 UTC <brightrobert7> auburn-kennesaw postponed, only got two and half innings in.  probably just as well.  auburn got off to 4-1 start in the first
702286594963808257 2016-02-23 00:19:06 UTC <brightrobert7> @shylove like a cuddly wiggly worm
702286189835976704 2016-02-23 00:17:30 UTC <brightrobert7> @My_NameAintEarl @DavidPurdum and now way the dealers will want to handle credit cards, walmart cashiers wont even do that anymore
702286051403026432 2016-02-23 00:16:57 UTC <brightrobert7> @My_NameAintEarl @DavidPurdum i think the cost of individual readers and pin pads would be too prohibitive.
702272820592693248 2016-02-23 23:24:22 UTC <brightrobert7> @Parlaypro @LoretelliPhil @RJinVegas been meaning to adjust my cap for those, but i never finish my three piece meal in time

702270393789321218 2016-02-23 23:14:44 UTC <brightrobert7> @groovinmahoovin i think for these political type questions the only person i would trust is a foreign insight, does fezzik have relatives?
702269902711889921 2016-02-23 23:12:47 UTC <brightrobert7> @Parlaypro @LoretelliPhil @RJinVegas ask a direct math question, get a vaguely termed subjective answer.  but thats how his touts FIRE
702268124045950977 2016-02-23 23:05:42 UTC <brightrobert7> @LoretelliPhil @Parlaypro @RJinVegas this is sad

702120105493327873 2016-02-23 13:17:32 UTC <brightrobert7> @FezzikSports well love conquers common sense when you are losing your customers money.  firing away like a 12yo boy with a playboy mag
701934860718514184 2016-02-22 01:01:26 UTC <brightrobert7> @jontaffer @TMZ no surprise it was the O-face.  Did they put the tires back on the trailer and take the freak show on the road?

701755742618054656 2016-02-22 13:09:41 UTC <brightrobert7> @shylove you could always persuade a pool boy or two to carry the couch to city hall

693999221494652930 2016-01-31 03:28:02 UTC <brightrobert7> @NLWagerTalk probably not worth the trip. We hit kop this evening, wife looked at bartender and said I look better than that

693623922827358208 2016-01-30 02:36:44 UTC <brightrobert7> if i hate anything its being on a 5.5 point dog who takes it to OT and then blows the cover
693622852696870912 2016-01-30 02:32:29 UTC <brightrobert7> @groovinmahoovin surely you can win regularly ignoring the math noing erythang bout sprots, logik hurtz

693590639745863684 2016-01-30 00:24:29 UTC <brightrobert7> @groovinmahoovin by cooking you mean photoshop and by as we speak you mean the sixers are winning?

692850536807165954 2016-01-28 23:23:35 UTC <brightrobert7> @thereallisaann most guys are simple tools anyway so its almost expected half of them send something to self validate

692764027718647808 2016-01-28 17:39:49 UTC <brightrobert7> @BrunoBets i have to ponder that a bit, i just saw it and kneejerk reaction was WTF. i actually need to hit the MLB brush up soon

692753631238557696 2016-01-28 16:58:31 UTC <brightrobert7> @igglez73 not suggesting, but i think if cuse can frustrate him into bad decisions the ball might not get passed around enough
692746951704580096 2016-01-28 16:31:58 UTC <brightrobert7> @igglez73 oregon has been blasted on the road to cat country for last couple, not sure anything is different this year
692746721638682624 2016-01-28 16:31:03 UTC <brightrobert7> @igglez73 there will be dropoff in irish productivity that wasnt evident in their last game
692746592114339842 2016-01-28 16:30:32 UTC <brightrobert7> @igglez73 agreed, four or five.  thing with jackson out, his replacement stepped up, but against BC so i think facing a better defense
692745755661094912 2016-01-28 16:27:13 UTC <brightrobert7> two bigest questions at this point for me is cincy +2 and zona -8.  may pull the trigger later

692745183608307713 2016-01-28 16:24:57 UTC <brightrobert7> @igglez73 ive seen associates (not sure what to call them these days) on both sides of the game as well.  will be tight

692583699515379712 2016-01-27 05:43:16 UTC <brightrobert7> @SarahKSilverman it would take till the 2020 election to fact check and sort out that kind of free for all. Let's do it
