971029927243014146 2018-03-06 14:29:10 UTC <Char74able> @SebGorka The only time we watch CNN is to check & see what their latest lie is. Even then, it's painful. I hope our Sarah continues to ignore their WH reporters.
971028983507808257 2018-03-06 14:25:25 UTC <Char74able> @RealJack The last thing I need is to watch a bunch of rich, spoiled, morally bankrupt celebrities lecture me on politics and political correctness. I'm a God fearing, born on the 4th of July American. If I need a lecture, I'll find it in a church or between the pages of my bible.
971026619350568960 2018-03-06 14:16:01 UTC <Char74able> @seanhannity @SebGorka @GeraldoRivera I'm no lawyer but, I suppose that depends on a judge's interpretation of harboring a fugitive. If "Sanctuary Cities" are considered a shelter then... Seems to me like there is some wiggle room to make a decent case for aiding and abetting a fugitive, as well as obstruction.
971023904998346758 2018-03-06 14:05:14 UTC <Char74able> Dear Twitter, I only just opened this account, but if you continue your conservative censorship, I'll be closing it! I will also encourage others to do the same. Stop interfering with free speech.
971023288498642944 2018-03-06 14:02:47 UTC <Char74able> @realDonaldTrump It was a brilliant move to force the Dems to show their true colors to their professed beloved dreamers. They love them so much they refused to negotiate a deal for them. As for Obama, the only thing he ever fixed was his income.
971021043681947655 2018-03-06 13:53:52 UTC <Char74able> @dbongino It is our hope that behind this smoke screen our president has ordered a real investigation of Obama and Clinton. Mueller's witch hunt looks like purposeful misdirection. We have massive deep state corruption. Why are we still crying Russia, Russia, Russia?
971018727851511812 2018-03-06 13:44:40 UTC <Char74able> @realDonaldTrump Problem is we watch to be entertained. We don't need Hollywood's morally bankrupt celebrities instruction in politics & political correctness. Let them purchase their own air time for that. How 'bout they all wear the same gown/suit next year & donate that $ to homeless veterans?
970122909825077248 2018-03-03 02:25:00 UTC <Char74able> @DLoesch Sometimes I think we should just go ahead and let them pass their bills.  They have no idea what they are talking about. Let them pass a bill  banning high capacity rapid fire magazines and automatic clips. Yep. That's the  ticket! Lol! Problem solved.
970119683750981633 2018-03-03 02:12:11 UTC <Char74able> @SebGorka @EllaaaCruzzz What kind of real feminist can't hit a target at 30 feet? Conservative women are women of substance. We're tough as nails. Maybe it's time we melted a few snowflakes?
970117599492235264 2018-03-03 02:03:54 UTC <Char74able> @dbongino Hilarious! Even more hilarious is the notion that we would allow those who are completely ignorant to dictate our constitutional rights. I am a born on the 4th of July American. Try it liberals, and see what happens!
969769155695140869 2018-03-02 02:59:18 UTC <Char74able> @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @TuckerCarlson @kinthenorthwest @SeattleCoug88 Snopes, a guy, his x-wife, his x-hooker girlfriend and a cat.
969768416562343936 2018-03-02 02:56:22 UTC <Char74able> @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @TuckerCarlson From my cold dead hands!
969548473262632960 2018-03-02 12:22:24 UTC <Char74able> @RealJack If the fake polls say 50% you know it's more like 80%! We are the majority. It's long past time the grown ups were in charge of this country. Let's keep it that way.
969546629798940672 2018-03-02 12:15:04 UTC <Char74able> @SebGorka @realDonaldTrump @BrianWollet I sincerely hope you are correct. I know liberals who are gun owners too, and they are in favor of 2A rights as well. This is actually something most Americans agree on, regardless of their fake polls. Keep our guns, protect our schools, crucify the Deep State.
969544485607788544 2018-03-02 12:06:33 UTC <Char74able> @RealJack Twitter needs a little angry button like Facebook has. This censorship should be illegal. Some of my favorite YouTube channels are now gone. Hopefully, some smart person creates an alternative. Regardless, we conservatives are the majority in this country. We need to stand strong
969543216012939264 2018-03-02 12:01:30 UTC <Char74able> @JoeNBC If the president infringes on our 2A rights in any way, he'll be offending the very people who voted for him. We will not stand for it!
969542684544241666 2018-03-02 11:59:23 UTC <Char74able> @realDonaldTrump Protect our 2A rights Mr. President!
969542018643918850 2018-03-02 11:56:45 UTC <Char74able> @Alyssa_Milano Do you know the difference between a real weapon of war and an ordinary semi-automatic gun? AR does not stand for automatic rifle. It stands for Armalite. An AR 15 is an ordinary semi-automatic rifle. It's common. It's just designed to look tough.
969540623400398848 2018-03-02 11:51:12 UTC <Char74able> @realDonaldTrump Oh, Sa-mack! Actually, I'm a big fan of yours Mr. President, but I thought Alec was pretty hilarious.
969334993511223296 2018-03-01 22:14:06 UTC <Char74able> @NBCNews @JoeNBC @NBCPolitics Why is he wasting time and money on this? He will never be able to extradite these people.
969329632674828289 2018-03-01 21:52:48 UTC <Char74able> @TomiLahren Considering they still think AR stands for Automatic Rifle. Really?
969329348053491712 2018-03-01 21:51:40 UTC <Char74able> @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle Let's hope he doesn't forget who his voters are. I'll not cast a vote for someone who infringes on my 2A rights.
969150945618690048 2018-03-01 10:02:46 UTC <Char74able> Nail on head.https://twitter.com/SebGorka/status/969066165875159040
969142239892041729 2018-03-01 09:28:10 UTC <Char74able> @HillaryClinton You're not an American. You're a traitor. Rub some more salve under that ankle bracelet and be quiet.
969024878367080449 2018-02-28 01:41:49 UTC <Char74able> I hope our president understands that he will lose his biggest supporters if he allows infringement on our 2A rights. We are his voters, but we will not be without our 2A rights intact.
969022808058728448 2018-02-28 01:33:35 UTC <Char74able> @WalshFreedom @robrousseau AR stands for Armalite. The AR 15 does not have selective fire and is therefore not an assault rifle. Selective fire would allow it to fire as a machine gun. AR 15's are a common semi automatic rifle, not an assault rifle.
966822672666636289 2018-02-22 23:51:02 UTC <Char74able> @RealJamesWoods @MsBees @SPricey32 Machine guns have been outlawed for many years. An AR 15 is not an assault rifle. It is an ordinary semi-automatic rifle. To be an assault rifle, it must have something called selective fire. Ar 15's do not. AR stands for Armalite. Selective fire would make it an automatic weapon
966821370851217409 2018-02-22 23:45:52 UTC <Char74able> @RealJamesWoods @SPricey32 You would use a gun to guard your money, but not your child? We also use locks and alarm systems and cameras to guard our money, yet we fail to protect our children. Even if gun control was enacted, it would be years in the making. We need protection for our children now.
966746264502259712 2018-02-22 18:47:25 UTC <Char74able> Because we have our second amendment we CAN protect our children! There is no need to alter our Constitutional rights to stop mass shootings. What we need to alter are gun free zones and schools that lack security. Harden the target. You do this for your money, why not your kids?
966716034307805185 2018-02-22 16:47:17 UTC <Char74able> @dbongino @RealSaavedra Wow! That's some seriously unethical censorship! He's not the only one either.
966708509952937984 2018-02-22 16:17:24 UTC <Char74able> @realDonaldTrump Thank you Mr. President! Please protect our children and teachers. Guns save lives when in the hands of the righteous. We love you and pray for you every day. Keep up the good fight. God bless.
