970498925953155074 2018-03-04 03:19:09 UTC <GreatScottLad> I followed you because your name has "hat" in It. I have no idea what your beliefs of politics are. BJH brought me here. @benedetti_13

964101907273977856 2018-02-15 11:39:41 UTC <GreatScottLad> If hockey games played out by your logic - the amount of goals scored would be an irrelevant metric. We'd judge winners based on the number of shots taken.  You don't become the president by winning the popular vote. You become the president by winning a majority of delegates.https://twitter.com/KimmiAnne77/status/963270108822097920
963930472161177600 2018-02-14 00:18:28 UTC <GreatScottLad> Phew. Reminds me of the gay cafe that kicked out the Christian group. Tolerance is a tool that is used to shut down western values - like women's rights and the Christian religion.   Either that or these men are incredibly gay and put off by women.https://twitter.com/V_of_Europe/status/963904786390188034
963823735890464769 2018-02-14 17:14:20 UTC <GreatScottLad> @Forbes There is no balance possible when working 40 hours plus a week and raising a child. You can't have it both ways, unless you have a time machine. Which you don't. So you can't.
963823105486544897 2018-02-14 17:11:49 UTC <GreatScottLad> @AKimCampbell I bet if women covered their shoulders the wage gap would significantly decrease! /s
962030627749965825 2018-02-09 18:29:09 UTC <GreatScottLad> Feck.   Unformed* mind.
962020977314996224 2018-02-09 17:50:49 UTC <GreatScottLad> @Jill_Colton Canada is the world's dumping ground, haven't you heard? If that surfer drama teacher or weird looking lesbian catch on that this will bring votes - jihadi Jack will be a fellow canuck.   SAD!
962019993050218496 2018-02-09 17:46:54 UTC <GreatScottLad> To add to that - projecting your gender dysphoria/ lack of understanding of biology onto an informed mind that sees you as a quintessential god is terriblehttps://twitter.com/d_antinora/status/962010967591677952
962016378847932416 2018-02-09 17:32:32 UTC <GreatScottLad> Protip: keep a gym bag on you at all times. You never know when you'll need to deadlift a fallen tree off of a damsel in distress.   If the damsel is a feminist - you can leave the fallen tree on her, since she is a strong, independent womyn & it's sexist to interfere with that
962012147034148872 2018-02-09 17:15:43 UTC <GreatScottLad> DADDY ISSUES A D D Y I S S U E S  Terrible.

961443878464208896 2018-02-07 03:37:38 UTC <GreatScottLad> Imagine it being 2018, and thinking that one person's achievement is indicative of the  achievements of the populatipn as a whole.

960577272758628358 2018-02-05 18:14:03 UTC <GreatScottLad> If this happens, Donald Trump can add 9,000 new teaching jobs created to his resume.   But....muh feelz.  Think of the children.   The children will learn a real lesson in that life isn't bubble wrapped & breaking the law has consequences.https://twitter.com/StefanMolyneux/status/960571450771034112
