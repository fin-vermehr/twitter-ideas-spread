968886642621779969 2018-02-28 16:32:31 UTC <NickAValliere> @NDKalu The catch rule has warped the minds of every single NFL fan. I'm glad they are making the change we need to put that to rest.
968885991166668800 2018-02-28 16:29:55 UTC <NickAValliere> @NDKalu the ertz catch I thought at the time was 100% a touchdown. He was a runner. 3 steps makes you a runner so the catch part isn't even a factor. He crossed the plain with the ball. I hate that people are debating whether it was a catch or not.pic.twitter.com/L1OunBw3UI

966716728565751809 2018-02-22 16:50:03 UTC <NickAValliere> @NDKalu I honestly feel like the Astros were just that bad at the time. How can you not lose 100+ games with that roster.

745280678674079744 2016-06-21 15:42:15 UTC <NickAValliere> @MichaelBerrySho still on New England roster.  Very reliable target for Brady but nowhere near the extent that Edelman is.
745275145183330304 2016-06-21 15:20:15 UTC <NickAValliere> Hey @BrendaLau15 ! You going to the meeting tonight at the RCC?

743849677284466688 2016-06-17 16:55:57 UTC <NickAValliere> @TravisRodgers I think it still is a know your place thing. Your the wife..  not the public figure.
743478630190190592 2016-06-16 16:21:33 UTC <NickAValliere> @TravisRodgers Micheal Young played for the Rangers at one point correct?

740954485875298304 2016-06-09 17:11:30 UTC <NickAValliere> @TravisRodgers I feel like he would kill someone for just misspelling his name. It's Aaron not aron!
740923868278198273 2016-06-09 15:09:50 UTC <NickAValliere> @RamonRoblesJr @MichaelBerrySho Turn Down For What right before a Texans game! heading to it or 5 minutes before the game at the house

736215697722740737 2016-05-27 15:21:15 UTC <NickAValliere> @TravisRodgers you should touch base on this Astros strikeout record. It was pretty impressive to watch to say the least!
735945853416787969 2016-05-26 21:28:59 UTC <NickAValliere> @SeanTPendergast did that guy hit the crack pipe?

729714354162044928 2016-05-09 16:47:14 UTC <NickAValliere> @TravisRodgers "I really like LeBron James" said by every cavs fan in existence
729713954675531776 2016-05-09 16:45:38 UTC <NickAValliere> @TravisRodgers he must have a pretty big "deal" if that question is above his pay grade. Gosh guy lighten up a bit!

725731291782471680 2016-04-28 16:59:58 UTC <NickAValliere> @TravisRodgers also who do you wanna see the Texans take in the first? Address a WR? Or go DE opposite Watt?
725729743639707648 2016-04-28 16:53:48 UTC <NickAValliere> Hey @TravisRodgers idk about you but to me it looks like Bryce Harper is quickly surpassing Mike Trout as MLBs best player. Your thoughts?
725344065777098753 2016-04-27 15:21:16 UTC <NickAValliere> @PatDStat I'd rather go WR in the first. I'm pretty high on Corey Colman or Will Fuller. Both present huge upsides for deep threats I think
