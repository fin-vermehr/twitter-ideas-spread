I believe there is a lack of parenting in this country, hold parents accountable and quit paying people to have kids
967210201882357761 2018-02-23 01:30:56 UTC <Clint67002772> @WhiteHouse Anyone that thinks gun control is the answer can take their socialist selves to any other country in the world and live out their lives there.
