It will guarantee a win for President Trump if crap like this is his opposition
961632321878282241 2018-02-08 16:06:26 UTC <bigboar916> The 8 hrs Nutsy Pelosi spent filibustering insulting Americans & protecting her illegal alien voting base is most work shes put in 4 decades. Now, if only she would put as much effort n2 protecting rights of people that r legally in this country, that would really be newsworthy!

950171064365133824 2018-01-07 01:03:29 UTC <bigboar916> @palsweb @D1fuzzymuffin17 I told them 4 last 20 yrs that we need a Pals on the strip. There was a Burger King tht closed tht wouldve been good, the Krystals is OK, but spot where gas station was across from pilot on west of the strip next to cookout would b ideal spot with traffic light help

He is his own horror story and any press he gets will turn into $ because libs will run out to buy his garbage and support him for trashing mean ol Trump
950044599338315776 2018-01-07 16:40:58 UTC <bigboar916> @piersmorgan @EmmaKennedy They were PAID to accuse him because the dems thought it would stop him from winning the election. It didnt and they disappeared. Where are they now?  There was no proof, so POOF! they vanished with their payday.

939280169919025152 2017-12-08 23:46:58 UTC <bigboar916> @Goldust thank you 4 the years & years of entertainment 4 us, the fans, who have spent hours enjoying ur performances. I still get a belly laugh from the street fight u had with Roddy Piper. You sacrificed so much 4 our entertainment & I want 2 make sure u know it is appreciated
939208593194274822 2017-12-08 19:02:32 UTC <bigboar916> @rushlimbaugh I think snowflake liberals should get a dictionary & look up difference between collusion & confusion because they dont have a clue what either means. Every time they open their mouth, its a laughable situation for anyone with more than two functioning brain cells

938959668063473664 2017-12-07 02:33:24 UTC <bigboar916> @chuckwoolery He was fired from every job he had while in office and he keeps doing what got him fired in every aspect of his life. Hes a piece of shit. Runs in his family.
938959085046845440 2017-12-07 02:31:05 UTC <bigboar916> Because dems didnt have a DAMN thing to do with it. The dems are afraid that someone will actually pull themselves up from poverty with the help of Pres Trump and no longer vote democrathttps://twitter.com/mitchellvii/status/938861365116227584
938921762225614848 2017-12-07 00:02:47 UTC <bigboar916> @Browns @JohnDBrice1 He is so pissed that he didnt get to choose the next coach for the Tennessee Volunteers that he decided to give his shitty choice for coach an extension for another year. Thank God above that the Volunteers wont turn into Cleveland south
938920887037956096 2017-12-07 23:59:18 UTC <bigboar916> @DineshDSouza Not saying that I want her to get hurt, but I hope her house and everything she owns is a pile of ash when she gets to go back
938920586608300032 2017-12-07 23:58:06 UTC <bigboar916> @chuckwoolery If she is attacking Trump, that means hes doing everything Ive voted for him to do. She is Satans concubine and theres very few things on this planet that I care less about than I do about her opinion
938920148752392193 2017-12-07 23:56:22 UTC <bigboar916> @BobYarbrough I think you missed a dozen or two
938806839441002498 2017-12-07 16:26:07 UTC <bigboar916> @BrittMcHenry If Jimmy Haslam cant pick a shitty coach for the University of Tennessee, hell just keep the shitty coach hes got with Cleveland
938767662888480769 2017-12-07 13:50:26 UTC <bigboar916> @chuckwoolery Yet another reason to NOT watch pro football.
938506229701373952 2017-12-06 20:31:36 UTC <bigboar916> @kurteichenwald Big difference youre overlooking for convenience for your party, proof. Theres proof Franken sexually assaulted women. No proof Moore did, only accusations from 40+ years ago. Proof also that women accusing Moore of sexual harassment got $ to say it. Your argument is invalid.
938456096787910659 2017-12-06 17:12:23 UTC <bigboar916> @cowgirlyoga5 @WhiskeyRiff I wonder who was holding her beer

937501601438322688 2017-12-03 01:59:34 UTC <bigboar916> @amazon @michaeljknowles Thats either in the fiction section (because there are ZERO legitimate reasons to vote democrat), as stupid as killarys book (shes what happened), or it only has 2 words in the entire book, Just dont .  It wouldnt make good toilet paper
937500315615662080 2017-12-03 01:54:27 UTC <bigboar916> @KurtSchlichter Then jump off a bridge and avoid the rush, snowflake. America wont miss you
937499841479020545 2017-12-03 01:52:34 UTC <bigboar916> @chuckwoolery @MarkYoungTruth Theyve thought and done that for decades and have been damned successful at draining the bank accounts of us taxpayers for whatever whim or pork product the dems wanted. Now they want to claim to fiscally conservative since theyre the minority. Give me a damn break.

Yeah, theres a lesson for all Americans in this republic. BTW-its a REPUBLIC, not a democracy. Google it. Youre welcome, little snowflake.
937441767330340864 2017-12-03 22:01:48 UTC <bigboar916> @pattonoswalt Dont you have some cookies to make, Keebler?  Leave the complicated stuff like governing the country to the adults. Youre not tall enough to ride the ride. Not smart enough either. Your tweet made me laugh, so I guess you are technically working, Mr Funnypants.

937368884356763649 2017-12-03 17:12:12 UTC <bigboar916> @realDonaldTrump @cbpolis This is the same conversation that Ive heard in locker rooms my whole life. Im not saying its right, Im saying its very, very common. Do you think someone like Michael Irvin didnt say it when he was playing for the Miami Hurricanes or Dallas Cowboys? Its locker room talk
937324554850054144 2017-12-03 14:16:03 UTC <bigboar916> @BobYarbrough Thats the only thing in Detroit that hasnt imploded on itself while the city has been under democratic control.
937324155095212032 2017-12-03 14:14:27 UTC <bigboar916> @WillWestWNML That combination would make Tennessee a player in the game hell of a lot quicker than any of the other coaches that have been mentioned so far

934289725996847104 2017-11-24 05:16:43 UTC <bigboar916> Or I can exercise my 1st amendment rights by commenting about her being a pot head , just like her father was at her age. That apple didnt fall far from that tree
933856631347142657 2017-11-23 00:35:45 UTC <bigboar916> @JohnJHarwood @chrislhayes @swimdeep I can accuse you of sleeping with your mother. Does that make it true? No. Can I find more to say it to cameras if youre running for office? Sure, if I pay them enough. Innocent until proven guilty and the police dont see enough evidence to look further into Moore.
933420911520370693 2017-11-22 19:44:22 UTC <bigboar916> @JohnJHarwood @chrislhayes @swimdeep How do you know her story is credible? Why in the hell wait 40 years to report something, just when it so happens that the person youre accusing is running for political office and you happen to be a democratic supporter that worked on Hillarys campaign?
933419870124994561 2017-11-22 19:40:13 UTC <bigboar916> @RealJamesWoods Why in the hell would anybody ask for her campaign advice? That bitch couldnt win a rigged election with the deck stacked in her favor 10 to 1.

930789964312440837 2017-11-15 13:29:55 UTC <bigboar916> @swimdeep Hes only been accused of improprieties with underage girls, theres no proof of it yet. If proof comes out, throw his ass in jail forever. Its convenient that the accusations come out just before an election and hes a republican. What about all 15+ who accused Bill Clinton?
