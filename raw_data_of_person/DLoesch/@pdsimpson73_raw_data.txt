970623902744481792 2018-03-05 11:35:46 UTC <pdsimpson73> @countryboy7477 Will do! Were coming down this Friday night. Will reach out to you Saturday!
970417005798084608 2018-03-04 21:53:38 UTC <pdsimpson73> @wildcatnews @CardsVillen Yes I am. Do me a favor, ask your mother if Burger King is ok tonight?
970399068856963072 2018-03-04 20:42:21 UTC <pdsimpson73> @wildcatnews @CardsVillen Just saying.pic.twitter.com/0Q70nbUhu3
970392819260108800 2018-03-04 20:17:31 UTC <pdsimpson73> @wildcatnews @CardsVillen Is it true when paying for groceries in the Louisville area theyre asking everyone to donate 1 dollar to help pay for the Yuck  Center?
970390347745579008 2018-03-04 20:07:42 UTC <pdsimpson73> @SethDavisHoops @JDrumUK I knew Davis was a Duke crony, but I really thought he was above this.
970302214140039168 2018-03-04 14:17:29 UTC <pdsimpson73> @RowlandRIVALS If he played for anyone else, he wouldve been pushed out of college basketball.
970301710060150784 2018-03-04 14:15:29 UTC <pdsimpson73> @wildcatnews @CardsVillen Actually I dont. I do respect and appreciate UKs place in college bball history. Im just glad 2 c UL and get what they deserve. Theyve been filthy dirty for years in all sports. I do hope u win the NIT. Maybe it can replace the banner u just took down.
970138550841888768 2018-03-03 03:27:09 UTC <pdsimpson73> @wildcatnews @CardsVillen Only loserville can lose a game up by 4 with 1 sec left and then try and talk smack. Bless your heart!
970024420428349440 2018-03-03 19:53:38 UTC <pdsimpson73> @wildcatnews @CardsVillen Great win against Virginia. Pulling for yall.
969350885817110530 2018-03-01 23:17:15 UTC <pdsimpson73> @LamarCoachT @AriA1exander Why?
965227889556934656 2018-02-18 14:13:56 UTC <pdsimpson73> @JDrumUK When John Higgins found out Cal and Huggy are friends, this game became an immediate Hold my beer moment.

962159452098088961 2018-02-09 03:01:04 UTC <pdsimpson73> @32_brown Was extremely excited to watch you this upcoming year. Really thought you would be the breakout player for UK. Good luck!
962137114749136897 2018-02-09 01:32:18 UTC <pdsimpson73> @FredMaggard Would rather have EB than Jones.
957363410144038912 2018-01-27 21:23:18 UTC <pdsimpson73> @TroyMachir @KySportsRadio I wished someone would knock his teeth down his throat.
951649773643235328 2018-01-11 02:59:21 UTC <pdsimpson73> @UKMitchBarnhart @UKCoachStoops @LamarCoachT Thanks for all your efforts into our program!
950580759143829507 2018-01-08 04:11:28 UTC <pdsimpson73> @MrsTylerKSR Will be a Louisville by the end of the week.
949384016683257856 2018-01-05 20:56:02 UTC <pdsimpson73> @xavierpeters22 @Jarren2Williams This coming from a kid who cant keep a commitment to save his life. If hes not named the starter at Storm 18, will he transfer? Who knows? Smart money says yes!
948368919223513088 2018-01-02 01:42:24 UTC <pdsimpson73> @KySportsRadio Purdue an option?
948148669534130176 2018-01-02 11:07:13 UTC <pdsimpson73> @dannykanell All that and the SEC still has two teams in the National Championship game. Bottom line Danny Kanell, you can kiss the SECs ass!
947702677575798786 2017-12-31 05:35:00 UTC <pdsimpson73> @RowlandRIVALS Auburn
947624469715193857 2017-12-31 00:24:14 UTC <pdsimpson73> @RowlandRIVALS The state of officiating in college sports is horrible!
947206347111698432 2017-12-30 20:42:46 UTC <pdsimpson73> @TWalkerRivals Be careful, he may sue you for calling him a joke!!! Guess, I shouldnt agree with you and wonder out loud how in the hell is this idiot still officiating college basketball? Hell, he shouldnt be allowed to officiate rec ball.
946941465749573632 2017-12-29 03:10:13 UTC <pdsimpson73> @FredMaggard Freddy, could this game become a benefit for UK football? UK played extremely hard and despite all the injuries, suspensions and defections had a chance to beat a 9-3 NWestern team. All UK fans should be proud and nothing brings UK fans together like horrible officiating! :-)
946910126627225600 2017-12-29 01:05:41 UTC <pdsimpson73> @JacobTamme And thats how UK plays defense.
946909068517609480 2017-12-29 01:01:29 UTC <pdsimpson73> @RowlandRIVALS Yep
946898258709897216 2017-12-29 00:18:32 UTC <pdsimpson73> @RowlandRIVALS Shouldve been thrown out of the game. TBH, Im tired of watching him represent UK.
946874106066153477 2017-12-29 22:42:33 UTC <pdsimpson73> @KySportsRadio Thats a very weak official. He needs to stay out of the damn tanning bed and grow a pair. Weak, weak, weak.
944646541867913216 2017-12-23 19:11:00 UTC <pdsimpson73> @jrsalzman Amen!
942224421372289025 2017-12-16 02:46:22 UTC <pdsimpson73> @FredMaggard Happy Birthday Freddie!!
942073346631651329 2017-12-16 16:46:03 UTC <pdsimpson73> @finebaum @LauraMRutledge @JimTuscaloosaAl Without classification, Laura Rutledge is one of the best broadcasters in college sports.  Any statement other wise is insane.  She would own College Game Day!!
939951813662511106 2017-12-10 20:15:50 UTC <pdsimpson73> @TerryTouchdown3 Awesome!
936746533869047808 2017-12-01 23:59:12 UTC <pdsimpson73> @Espngreeny Today.....
934988335310884865 2017-11-26 03:32:45 UTC <pdsimpson73> @MrsTylerKSR Hes having a really bad day.
934600938475675648 2017-11-25 01:53:22 UTC <pdsimpson73> @RowlandRIVALS Honestly, I like our defense more without him
934498151305744384 2017-11-25 19:04:56 UTC <pdsimpson73> @KySportsRadio Stoops has lost control of this team.
934489504353869824 2017-11-25 18:30:34 UTC <pdsimpson73> @JDrumUK This will be the worst loss since the Spurrier days.
934125521134391297 2017-11-24 18:24:14 UTC <pdsimpson73> @cp_walker16 Go kick their ass and show them BBN runs the state of Ky.
932025515455676416 2017-11-18 23:19:33 UTC <pdsimpson73> @ddrum08 @RowlandRIVALS @JDrumUK If your Alabama, you can deny the penalty. If your Kentuck, u take the penalty!!!!!
931953150617161728 2017-11-18 18:32:00 UTC <pdsimpson73> The officials in the MSU/Ark game should be ashamed of themselves for calling a hold against Ark. MSU holds every play.
931940776967327744 2017-11-18 17:42:50 UTC <pdsimpson73> @CameronMillz @ThrowboyTees Hes such a sissy!
928468740618022913 2017-11-08 03:46:12 UTC <pdsimpson73> @AdotWhite I completely agree.
927253039299383297 2017-11-05 19:15:26 UTC <pdsimpson73> @FredMaggard For me, the team still doesnt know how to win. B4 game JJ has sunglasses on during warm ups, LB is doing back flips. Prepare 2 dominate
927241388017815552 2017-11-05 18:29:08 UTC <pdsimpson73> @wildcatnews No, UK faced the easiest schedule they will see in years. All 3 will see an upgrade in coaching next year.
926953758545842176 2017-11-04 23:26:12 UTC <pdsimpson73> @KySportsRadio 40 yrs being a UK football fan despite attending UA and living in Tuscaloosa most my life. This team, this staff has broke me. Im done!
926942531769782272 2017-11-04 22:41:35 UTC <pdsimpson73> @RowlandRIVALS Incredible how bad our situational play calling is. Its really embarrassing.
926942289129328641 2017-11-04 22:40:38 UTC <pdsimpson73> @jenheraldleader I swear we dont play or coach to win.
926919365345402880 2017-11-04 21:09:32 UTC <pdsimpson73> Our defensive backs are embarrassing.
926257538294845440 2017-11-02 01:19:40 UTC <pdsimpson73> @countryboy7477 Ha! Im very proud of you and love ya to brother!! I love seeing your testimonies!Keep it going!!
924743804762148864 2017-10-29 21:04:38 UTC <pdsimpson73> @lindsniewski @darrenrovell Im going to have to kneel as well. My parents told me that atleast 100x. Didnt know I shouldve been offended.
924708051021631492 2017-10-29 18:42:34 UTC <pdsimpson73> @Landon_Young_67 Incredible block by Juice.
924703964200951808 2017-10-29 18:26:19 UTC <pdsimpson73> @FredMaggard Ive seen UK lose so, so many of games when they dominated the stat sheet. Was it pretty! Heck NO! Was it a WIN? YEP! Thats all that matter
924485211995475970 2017-10-28 03:57:05 UTC <pdsimpson73> @FredMaggard It was me and if it will get 180 yds next week, I will ask you the same question again. Huge game by Benny!
924472017537196032 2017-10-28 03:04:39 UTC <pdsimpson73> @KySportsRadio Just said the same thing.
924463674269593600 2017-10-28 02:31:30 UTC <pdsimpson73> @SECCountryUK @KyleTucker_SEC Because were a program that knows how to lose. Sorry, but its true. Never been more embarrassed about being a UK fan in my life.
924463066393268224 2017-10-28 02:29:05 UTC <pdsimpson73> @DerekSTerry We absolutely suck.
924459654033395712 2017-10-28 02:15:31 UTC <pdsimpson73> @countryboy7477 Never seen a program who wants to lose games more than this one.
924340128125980677 2017-10-28 18:20:34 UTC <pdsimpson73> @FredMaggard Not saying hes not a good back, but is he really a featured back? Very good, not great. Boom & BS= great duo, Benny & roster=not so much.
924294613564907520 2017-10-28 15:19:43 UTC <pdsimpson73> @FredMaggard Is UKs struggle on offense the lack of push by the OL or the lack of a real RB threat? I love BS, but hes not a feature back.
921870954162216960 2017-10-21 22:48:57 UTC <pdsimpson73> @johnclayiv Not overreacting here but this has been an embarrassing performance.
921867308582268929 2017-10-21 22:34:28 UTC <pdsimpson73> @KySportsRadio Really disappointed. Honestly, they backed off as soon as they were punched in the mouth
921858968103907328 2017-10-21 22:01:19 UTC <pdsimpson73> @jenheraldleader What in Gods earth did we do during this week off?
921857368106860544 2017-10-21 21:54:58 UTC <pdsimpson73> @DerekSTerry Worst coaching job in 2 years. Very disappointed in UK today.
921849571248140290 2017-10-21 21:23:59 UTC <pdsimpson73> @KySportsRadio Absolutely embarrassing.
921848208611008519 2017-10-21 21:18:34 UTC <pdsimpson73> @DerekSTerry Will be 24 to 7 after 1st series of 2nd half.
921845642296688641 2017-10-21 21:08:22 UTC <pdsimpson73> @JDrumUK I swear we do some of the most dumbest things!
921832204321394688 2017-10-21 20:14:58 UTC <pdsimpson73> @KySportsRadio The 3rd and 17 was freaking embarrassing.
921781517084450816 2017-10-21 16:53:34 UTC <pdsimpson73> @UKFootball Wear all white!!!!!!!!!!
921781354412552197 2017-10-21 16:52:55 UTC <pdsimpson73> @KySportsRadio Let the boys know
921737638364811264 2017-10-21 13:59:12 UTC <pdsimpson73> @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @EdKrassen As soon as the FBI is finished investigating the Obama admin and their conspiracy with Russia.
921513861324386306 2017-10-20 23:10:00 UTC <pdsimpson73> Welcome to America in 2017!https://twitter.com/kwilli1046/status/920965530433085443
921313116784398338 2017-10-20 09:52:18 UTC <pdsimpson73> @politicalelle Youre not kidding. If @ZackKopplin is offended by John Kelly then should be the torch carrier of whats wrong with america. #puddinzation
921310158751457280 2017-10-20 09:40:33 UTC <pdsimpson73> @countryboy7477 @pastoremase Best post ever.
921223207335501826 2017-10-19 03:55:02 UTC <pdsimpson73> @politicalelle And to think, someone voted for her and will vote for her again. SMH.....
921100076184989696 2017-10-19 19:45:46 UTC <pdsimpson73> @KySportsRadio Dont forget this guy was a good recruiter so hes used to telling people what they want to hear. Hes a POS and Im glad hes out of CBB.
917048355821445125 2017-10-08 15:25:40 UTC <pdsimpson73> @RowlandRIVALS Do we really know? IMO, too many key and nagging injuries to really know.
916871304715874304 2017-10-07 03:42:08 UTC <pdsimpson73> @KySportsRadio Not sure there is another team that needs a bye week more than UK.
916856560592277504 2017-10-07 02:43:33 UTC <pdsimpson73> @DerekSTerry Absolutely embarrassing
916697386289856517 2017-10-07 16:11:02 UTC <pdsimpson73> @tomleachKY 388
915381570634174465 2017-10-03 01:02:28 UTC <pdsimpson73> @JenNimePalumbo Jennifer, it was obvious to me during the UNC game, Mr Higgins had a pre existing conflict with Cal or UK or both. #puddinization!
915335933611954176 2017-10-03 22:01:07 UTC <pdsimpson73> @KySportsRadio I say we file a counter suit. I assure you, he caused me way more pain and suffering then any UK fan did him or his family. #puddinazation!
915318660922773504 2017-10-03 20:52:29 UTC <pdsimpson73> @KySportsRadio @SethDavisHoops Hilarious! He is truly a weak individual. He knows dang well he cost UK that game and his feelings are hurt that he was called out for it.
915187392209997825 2017-10-03 12:10:52 UTC <pdsimpson73> @DailyCaller Like any of us should care about a celeb who publicly stated she hates my country.
913054897511239681 2017-09-27 14:57:05 UTC <pdsimpson73> @TomJurich @MattBevin @GoCards @JohnRamseyUofL @prbob Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha!!!! Loserville is now and forever known as cheatersville!
911938083305738240 2017-09-24 12:59:16 UTC <pdsimpson73> @HLpreps If you can't support this team after last night, then you're not a fan. 1 loss should not define anyone or any team. GBB.
911779423678078976 2017-09-23 02:28:49 UTC <pdsimpson73> @FunnyMaine Go big blue?????
911771156444827648 2017-09-23 01:55:58 UTC <pdsimpson73> @KySportsRadio We're about to go up 17.
909868208517152769 2017-09-18 19:54:20 UTC <pdsimpson73> @CocaCola @UKAthletics Should be standard game day addition.

909470692156035073 2017-09-17 17:34:44 UTC <pdsimpson73> @wildcatnews He may have been on the field but this guy has no idea how to express facts. His writing should be embarrassing to USC jr.
909264341723213824 2017-09-16 03:54:47 UTC <pdsimpson73> @cp_walker16 Very proud of you guys! Keep playing your ass off!
909263930572361734 2017-09-16 03:53:09 UTC <pdsimpson73> @JDrumUK Good lawd! When was the last time we saw that stat?
909260585539432448 2017-09-16 03:39:51 UTC <pdsimpson73> @FredMaggard Best game I've seen these 2 corners play. They looked like bama's CB's. They played to punish SC. Loved it.
909257147111890944 2017-09-16 03:26:11 UTC <pdsimpson73> @MrsTylerKSR Horrible news!
909253157494063105 2017-09-16 03:10:20 UTC <pdsimpson73> @JDrumUK Great game by the cats!
909108176582266881 2017-09-16 17:34:14 UTC <pdsimpson73> @jenheraldleader @markcstory @johnclayiv @KYHuangs @JDrumUK Had no idea USC jr is now a football powerhouse. I haven't liked what we've been so far. Some strange reason, I think we win????? Go Cats!
907961245105393667 2017-09-13 13:36:44 UTC <pdsimpson73> @JaredLorenzen22 I had a house full of Bama fans pulling for us during that game. When you threw the pic, everyone of them apologized like they did it. :-)
906346864253030402 2017-09-08 02:41:46 UTC <pdsimpson73> @AriFleischer Puddinazation of America!!!
906342164749275139 2017-09-08 02:23:05 UTC <pdsimpson73> @FredMaggard My cousin played with him at CHS. I would drive up from T-Town to watch them play. Very good back. Would've played at any school here.

893881109393661952 2017-08-05 17:07:18 UTC <pdsimpson73> @FredMaggard For the defense, It will be pick your poison. Do you shift double teams toward Ross or Baker?? Do one or both and Mr Conrad scores a lot.
891406653962280961 2017-07-29 21:14:42 UTC <pdsimpson73> @dannykanell One thing you can count on..... Bama is going to beat that ass in Atlanta. Don't be offended by it either.....
886433338864566272 2017-07-15 03:52:31 UTC <pdsimpson73> @wildcatnews Would love to see UK play ND.

883540113568956416 2017-07-07 04:15:53 UTC <pdsimpson73> @NBA @DickieV He's an idiot DickeyV. He hopes his crazy comments, actions and behavior will keep him and his brand in the limelight.

883011068402053120 2017-07-06 17:13:38 UTC <pdsimpson73> @FredMaggard In regards to winnable games or games we should win, I completely agree!
880773791068164096 2017-06-30 13:03:30 UTC <pdsimpson73> @FredMaggard Agreed!! Highest winning % of all time!
876586305907564545 2017-06-18 23:43:56 UTC <pdsimpson73> @TylerBNBSJ That shouldn't mean much either.
876585322041225217 2017-06-18 23:40:01 UTC <pdsimpson73> @TylerBNBSJ No offense, but being named an Academic All-American at UNC doesn't mean what it used to. I'm sure he's a great kid.
876583228949368834 2017-06-18 23:31:42 UTC <pdsimpson73> @BenRobertsHL @GoHeels252 Great shot. I hope he performs as well in class as he did in that game or atleast have the same type of help. UNCheaters.
876575820910919680 2017-06-18 23:02:16 UTC <pdsimpson73> @BenRobertsHL Ol' Roy is promising him a free education in a field of his choice and a national championship gift wrapped by the NCAA.
871000608400080898 2017-06-03 13:48:22 UTC <pdsimpson73> @wildcatnews I just hope he never officiates again.
865295060572807168 2017-05-18 19:56:33 UTC <pdsimpson73> @DarrellBird @FredMaggard I'll still have  the original pic used to publish in the Tuscaloosa News.
865275513652350976 2017-05-18 18:38:53 UTC <pdsimpson73> @KySportsRadio Now ask yourselves..... Who's paying players?
850759451632128001 2017-04-08 17:17:14 UTC <pdsimpson73> @TimSullivan714 I'm a firm believer he called the F4 because he executed direction perfectly. Call it what u want,  ever seen a 1 sided officiated game ever
850758780770013186 2017-04-08 17:14:34 UTC <pdsimpson73> @mlelder @TimSullivan714 False!! I've watched it 3 times and only 1 of his call was a 50/50. Regardless, the problem is the calls he didn't make.
850758172113600513 2017-04-08 17:12:09 UTC <pdsimpson73> @TimSullivan714 Higgins is the kid who takes his ball and goes home when he isn't picked first. Needs to move his business to Chapel Hill!
850757846115512321 2017-04-08 17:10:51 UTC <pdsimpson73> @TimSullivan714 What a punk!!! Take your medicine for being a horrible official.
849630835204657152 2017-04-05 14:32:31 UTC <pdsimpson73> @WKYT @GarrettWKYT Worst official I've ever seen. S
849043304457154560 2017-04-03 23:37:52 UTC <pdsimpson73> @robbromleywkyt Best of luck!
846881395494600704 2017-03-28 00:27:13 UTC <pdsimpson73> @DrewFranklinKSR Not that I agree with this ignorance. However, he has 1 point. He is everything that's wrong with College Basketball.
841023940940161024 2017-03-12 20:31:47 UTC <pdsimpson73> @BretBielema Arkansas is a bunch of punks who's coached by a punk.

815262842266025984 2016-12-31 18:26:23 UTC <pdsimpson73> @KSTV_Sports agreed. Was not a face mask.
815236449918418944 2016-12-31 16:41:30 UTC <pdsimpson73> @RowlandRIVALS @Scott_Charlton and to go blank himself. I agree with Stoops!

784931283185139713 2016-10-08 01:39:35 UTC <pdsimpson73> @MrsTylerKSR He's 100% correct.

756983215827591173 2016-07-23 22:43:57 UTC <pdsimpson73> @LamarCoachT @UKsportstalk1 @justin_lucas20 It is!!! UL is a corrupt dump. The coaches of ur 2 top programs are trash (like the city/univ)
756583213125013507 2016-07-22 20:14:29 UTC <pdsimpson73> @Rupp_Arena go ahead and put blue chair backs in the upper deck.
756144309129314305 2016-07-21 15:10:26 UTC <pdsimpson73> One thing is for sure, the investment and commitment is there. Now time for the boys to wins some games. #GBB,#BBN, C A T S!!!
756142773821120512 2016-07-21 15:04:20 UTC <pdsimpson73> Bama has the same thing. It helps ventilate the helmets, cleats etc. especially during 2 a days.
756141367181582336 2016-07-21 14:58:45 UTC <pdsimpson73> not sure the ventilation is for the drinks. I believe it's to reduce odors/gems in the locker room.
740373637170114560 2016-06-07 02:43:25 UTC <pdsimpson73> @FredMaggard @JDrumUK IMO, he's a camp performer with good work effort. He will be over recruited this yr, next yr and his last n T Town.
740372308834025473 2016-06-07 02:38:08 UTC <pdsimpson73> @JDrumUK @FredMaggard Kid will never play for Bama. In 2 yrs he will be at Texas State. Hilarious that LK is celebrating... SMH!
