938572638254968832 2017-12-06 00:55:29 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @pitbulllobby Did you get any evidence after your temper tantrum?
938571407864291328 2017-12-06 00:50:36 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @pitbulllobby Funny how you have people coming out against Roy Moore all of a sudden provide evidence little one or run along

938455513771233282 2017-12-06 17:10:04 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @KatTimpf Maybe yall should do some research about the entire situation.  Its been largely disproven on a lot of the accounts.  Then some are his word vs her word.  And being from Alabama I find it hard to believe that it took 30 years for that to come out
938454581813612544 2017-12-06 17:06:22 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @_Kel_Varnsen_ Your incompetence is absolutely boring me to death.  Maybe you should pay attention to more news then CNN little one and you may find out.  Do a google search for the information coming out about the investigation.  There is a ton time for you to do some work

Also actually the case was argued by a lawyer in my hometown and it wasnt even about that.  It was the equal representation of every religion in the state capital but

935541807215185922 2017-11-28 16:12:03 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LCDCAlabama How am I off the rails? Why because Im calling out facts that you cant dispute?  They have been silencing conservatives for a long time and its time for it to end.  Freedom of speech is for all! #MAGA
935541308613160960 2017-11-28 16:10:04 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LCDCAlabama I have established the lie in the first statement.  You twisting words to make them believe something else
935541125930258432 2017-11-28 16:09:20 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LCDCAlabama You call out against Moore yet your party states they stand for women then have them resign!
935540938939781120 2017-11-28 16:08:36 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LCDCAlabama And Im glad you stated it right accusations with no evidence what so ever.  None of the stories hold water and with him being in the public eye for 30 years does it really take that long and now its just there words against his.  Shady and the timing is shady
935540449854607360 2017-11-28 16:06:39 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LCDCAlabama You say this as we have an anti 2nd Amendment, late term abortion, wants open borders, and sanctuary cities democrat running for the US senate
935540128860332032 2017-11-28 16:05:22 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LCDCAlabama You are aware that the mall manager actually stood up and stated that Toy Moore never had any complaints under his time of management at the mall right
935539738051833856 2017-11-28 16:03:49 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LCDCAlabama Wont even let it be examined.  Its not his handwriting and you know it.  So establishment hitjob?  So why are you democrats and establishment republicans so scared of?  If we send him to Washington?  Is it that he is not part of the good ol boy club what is it?
935539396140589056 2017-11-28 16:02:28 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LCDCAlabama Where is your evidence against Roy Moore?  There isnt any its he said she said.  There is holes in the story and we both know Roy Moore has been around for a long time its shady that this story just came out dont ya think.  So I want evidence and dont say the book which they
935538930912546816 2017-11-28 16:00:37 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LCDCAlabama  another triggered snowflake cant take being called out for there lies!
935538741485203459 2017-11-28 15:59:52 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LCDCAlabama Every time I see a debate with a republican and a democrat its normally a bloodbath for the democrat.   Sry few democrats can sell what you offer.  Were as republicans want less regulation, less government, and more freedom.  So with that being said I belong to neither
935538246326587393 2017-11-28 15:57:54 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LCDCAlabama Because we constantly see how these schools and universities are silencing people from the right.  Which is first off illegal.  Freedom of speech is for everybody so remember that
935538016436871168 2017-11-28 15:56:59 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LCDCAlabama Funny how you say that but its always liberal snowflakes that get there feelings hurt and need a safe space.

935536965289734144 2017-11-28 15:52:48 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LCDCAlabama I mean lets look Democrats look to be some sleeze balls in Congress what are we up now that should resign for sexual misconduct of some kind or another that has PROOF  lets see that whole list so they can all go and I do mean both parties
935536368628969472 2017-11-28 15:50:26 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LCDCAlabama When the claims look like an establishment hit job and the womens stories are falling apart and the straw that broke that was Gloria Allred and her lies you will see people are not buying this junk that the establishment and democrats are spreading.
935535887680720897 2017-11-28 15:48:31 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LCDCAlabama You can plan to vote how ever you choose its your right.

930490347800711168 2017-11-14 17:39:21 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @dunnclan Funny how everybody is looking at a story from a liberal paper and when a liberal TV crew came in they found nothing but baseless claims just depends who you listen to and since those stories dont hold water  #IstandwithRoyMoore

930308297906966528 2017-11-13 05:35:57 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @BreitbartNews @3373Jones @dawsonp481 @graceschroeder No you care and which ever parent it was that served this great nation I absolutely have the upmost respect for them.

930301056256561152 2017-11-13 05:07:10 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @ReaganBattalion @EcoDevGuru No his credibility isnt zero because the people in Alabama see through this if you remember Trump had how many people come forward right before the election and it was a political stunt just like this is people in Alabama are not falling for this
930300585315840000 2017-11-13 05:05:18 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @ReaganBattalion @EcoDevGuru How are you going to say trolling when thats not the case you need to look at the facts and stop looking at what you want

930298021660823553 2017-11-13 04:55:07 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @ReaganBattalion @EcoDevGuru Okay so he denied the claim
930297833839882240 2017-11-13 04:54:22 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @activistmommy1 @ReaganBattalion @StephenDrake2 Nobody can corroborate there stories if they were alone as they claim.  Also the Washington Post endorses Doug Jones the. Publishes this insane story that has no facts to it that can be backed up its a he said she said situation
930297410806583297 2017-11-13 04:52:41 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @ReaganBattalion @EcoDevGuru So you want me to believe a republican rat that needs to resign he is a disgrace and he is not even credible especially here in Alabama
930297078277967872 2017-11-13 04:51:22 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @activistmommy1 @Peachiequeen_ Look at the facts thats important for the issue you have no idea whats going on your not even in Alabama
930295749983707136 2017-11-13 04:46:05 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @ReaganBattalion @EcoDevGuru Yes lets look at the Nypost for an issue in Alabam that was a great choice do your own research
930295523092901889 2017-11-13 04:45:11 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @ReaganBattalion @activistmommy1 @softwaredoug I will vote for Roy Moore especially since its a vote against the establishment.
930295384945152000 2017-11-13 04:44:38 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @activistmommy1 @ReaganBattalion @StephenDrake2 Oh its not normal here but The facts dont add up and Im the first one to back a victim but in this case the evidence does not add up
930295147908263936 2017-11-13 04:43:41 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @ReaganBattalion @activistmommy1 @softwaredoug Not at a restaurant or any public place which was the claim
930294469269839872 2017-11-13 04:41:00 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @PersampiereDO @activistmommy1 @softwaredoug Instead of being a keyboard warrior on Twitter why dont you look at the facts of the case because even rape crisis counselors have an issue with the claims
930294187756605440 2017-11-13 04:39:53 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @PersampiereDO @activistmommy1 @softwaredoug No he never admited that
930294139270385665 2017-11-13 04:39:41 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @ReaganBattalion @activistmommy1 @softwaredoug No I dont see Im in Alabama one of the women works for the DNC second off he never admited to anything.  Also the county thats in question was a dry county so the alcohol claim is BS.  So there are a lot of holes where is the evidence we are in USA innocent til proven guilty
930293621378732032 2017-11-13 04:37:38 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @PersampiereDO @activistmommy1 @softwaredoug You seriously need to look at the facts problem is you just want to crucify Moore no matter what the evidence points to
930293108465700865 2017-11-13 04:35:35 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @activistmommy1 @PersampiereDO No he was not he was Deputy!
930292521296678912 2017-11-13 04:33:15 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @ReaganBattalion @Danfishman4 Agreed and it would be a crime to misrepresent t yourself even as far as forgery so I dont believe this BS that they are fabricating
930291714245439489 2017-11-13 04:30:03 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @ReaganBattalion @EcoDevGuru He did deny the charge multiple times
930291491989327872 2017-11-13 04:29:10 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @ReaganBattalion @activistmommy1 @IndependentGms He never said that on Hannity did we watch the same interview or did you hear something that dont exist
930291274522996736 2017-11-13 04:28:18 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @ReaganBattalion @activistmommy1 @softwaredoug They cant sign as a DA that would be forgery
930290962168991751 2017-11-13 04:27:04 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @activistmommy1 @ReaganBattalion Im not bashing them but I want proof and waiting 40 years isnt a good start.  Also one of them working for Doug jones campaign another problem.  Also if he is a deputy district attorney why would he sign as the DA facts are he wouldnt so not buying it
930289106655105025 2017-11-13 04:19:41 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @williamlegate @aldotcom @TrumpsareNazis How dare you even talk like that this has nothing to do with religion and you have no say so stay out of it because there is no proof of anything
930286470635704320 2017-11-13 04:09:13 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @seanhannity @crushthebigots So I guess I hurt your feelings since your adding me to a list  and went to calling names which means you have lost all credibility
930279819102875648 2017-11-13 03:42:47 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @FoxNews @thekleptocracy Prove they are victims first this is America Innocent til proven Guilty
930279565540429824 2017-11-13 03:41:46 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @FoxNews First off it needs to be factual and backed up with grounds.  Not just somebodies words to tear apart somebodys life it needs to be something held up in the court of law
930266797194039296 2017-11-13 02:51:02 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @ololabear I stand with Roy Moore as well!!

930213537619894272 2017-11-13 23:19:24 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @medwoman1 @lsfarmer311 @rhonda_harbison @coach_sjkl @EllenMignone How?  He supports abortion.  Which is murder in my book.  No religion needed for that description even without religion he is for the killing of an unborn child!
930202565572251648 2017-11-13 22:35:48 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @medwoman1 @lsfarmer311 @rhonda_harbison @coach_sjkl @EllenMignone Correct so lets go to ethics so you think people should vote for a baby killer?
930193439085481984 2017-11-13 21:59:32 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @medwoman1 @lsfarmer311 @rhonda_harbison @coach_sjkl @EllenMignone He is innocent until proven guilty! Thats factual so where is the court with a Jury of his peers.  Which will never see the light of day and we both know it.  Its a political scam
930192954957975552 2017-11-13 21:57:37 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @aldotcom @_TheChrisCoxRTR @scoobasteve7132 And since your not in Alabama you have no say and Trump has been a great President!! #IsupportRoyMoore #IsupportDonaldTrump and your not the resistance your a rhino and part of the problem
930192242219913216 2017-11-13 21:54:47 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @aldotcom @_TheChrisCoxRTR @scoobasteve7132 He is a real Leader and if Gloria Allred is involved that means its a bunch of BS keep making the case worse because there is no proof just an accusation #Moore4Senate
930154926667456512 2017-11-13 19:26:30 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @medwoman1 @lsfarmer311 @rhonda_harbison @coach_sjkl @EllenMignone I will vote for him because its an accusation with no evidence of proof.  Now if it turns to fact then its a different story
930154128529076224 2017-11-13 19:23:20 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @lsfarmer311 @medwoman1 @rhonda_harbison @EllenMignone See your wrong but I wont crucify a man over an accusation which is all that is
930151809200553984 2017-11-13 19:14:07 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @medwoman1 @EllenMignone @lsfarmer311 @rhonda_harbison @coach_sjkl Your from Indiana and have no say in this election.  So why are you so worried about Roy Moore?
930151508473245696 2017-11-13 19:12:55 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @medwoman1 @EllenMignone @lsfarmer311 @rhonda_harbison @coach_sjkl No definitely not Im a human that lives in Alabama I actually have a vote in this election

930151007132188674 2017-11-13 19:10:56 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @lsfarmer311 @medwoman1 @rhonda_harbison @EllenMignone Funny you have to block people because you cant debate the issues.
930150857064308737 2017-11-13 19:10:20 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @lsfarmer311 @medwoman1 @EllenMignone @rhonda_harbison Because you cant debate facts Trump has done more for the economy in 10 months then Obama did in 8 years
930150600435748865 2017-11-13 19:09:19 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @lsfarmer311 @medwoman1 @EllenMignone @rhonda_harbison Well show me where I have?  You wont find one for me either.  Its ACCUSATIONS ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THAT TERM?

930135681061572608 2017-11-13 18:10:02 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @lsfarmer311 @medwoman1 @EllenMignone @rhonda_harbison Story that the Washington Post stared about him its insane and they just didnt come to Alabama and get the story of century so please dont make yourself look worse
930135382863286272 2017-11-13 18:08:51 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @lsfarmer311 @medwoman1 @EllenMignone @rhonda_harbison Maam you have nothing.  Thats my point your liberal hypocrite.  What about the democrat who is in office right now who actually has evidence that something did happen against him where is your outrage for that?  You have nothing on Judge Moore.  The man is t perfect but this/1
930095668424790016 2017-11-13 15:31:02 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @nytimes @seanhannity All he did was get both sides to the story!  #IstandwithRoyMoore #IStandWithHannity
930095102168625152 2017-11-13 15:28:47 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @seanhannity @President1Trump @covfefeartist All because he let Judge Roy Moore tell his side of the story.  #IstandwithRoyMoore #IStandWithHannity
930094622688366592 2017-11-13 15:26:53 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @President1Trump @surfermom77 People in Alabama that support Judge Moore still support him #IstandwithRoyMoore
930093368230797314 2017-11-13 15:21:53 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @washingtonpost The Washington Post is a radical left wing nut case of #FakeNewsWaPo and you endorsed Doug Jones then ran a story that involves a democratic operative expecting us to buy this garbage after 40 years seriously #RoyMoore4Senate #IstandwithRoyMoore
930092815048208384 2017-11-13 15:19:42 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @washingtonpost This story is garbage just like your reporting and you should have done a little more investigating and you would have found that the stories even rape crisis counselors dont believe or the democratic operative that works with Doug Jones.  See the truth always comes out/1
930091611404537857 2017-11-13 15:14:55 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @OliviaResists This is one of the most disgusting tweets I have seen get some class he is innocent until proven guilty and the facts dont look promising on that
930090923828174848 2017-11-13 15:12:11 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @Demos_Org @CitizenActionWI @RedTRaccoon @FlyingBaldie Voter is laws should be required in all states so dead people dont vote like they did for Obama
930090551160049664 2017-11-13 15:10:42 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @RedTRaccoon This is a disgusting tweet these people have lost everything and your worried about them voting seriously.  I think your priorities are a little backwards
930090108501610497 2017-11-13 15:08:56 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LindaWildes @alcacountry He does not exemplify no such Christian behavior in any way.  Abortion is not a Christian value.  Open borders kills our jobs and wages.  Roy Moore is the only candidate that believes in Christian values
930089614815170560 2017-11-13 15:06:59 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LindaWildes @alcacountry I will not vote for open borders or a murderer.  I also think ACA should be repealed.  And Jones favors Sactuary Cities So all of his stands are garbage for me and the state of Alabama
930089148597329920 2017-11-13 15:05:07 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LindaWildes @alcacountry Whats hilarious is without these accusations Doug Jones didnt even have a chance.  I still believe Roy Moore will win this election.  So after all the dirty politics that has been played by Doug Jones we will see because Im still voting for Moore!
930088343861452803 2017-11-13 15:01:56 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @lsfarmer311 @EllenMignone @rhonda_harbison @medwoman1 See thats where it shows you have no idea what your talking about.  Racist is a lie you need to learn your history.  The Democratic Party is the racist party and have always been. Do some research on your history maam and Judge Moore isnt racist or any of these names you named
930085864608358400 2017-11-13 14:52:04 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @lsfarmer311 @medwoman1 @EllenMignone @rhonda_harbison After people who support Roy Moore because I have done research and the stories dont add up or make sense.  And hell one of them conveniently supports Doug Jones seriously give me a break! Do your own research instead of believeing the garbage from mainstream media!
930085373300084736 2017-11-13 14:50:07 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @lsfarmer311 @medwoman1 @EllenMignone @rhonda_harbison Well maybe you should do some fact checking on there story.  Even rape crisis counselors dont believe there story due to certain aspects of the story so while your saying your disgusted do a little research on the women who said something and the whole situation before going /1
930084597408370689 2017-11-13 14:47:02 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @DebraMessing No support Roy Moore for somebody who will stand up to the Washington Establishment dont give anything to an open border, sanctuary city believing radical left liberal who does not hold Alabama values!
930083982376620041 2017-11-13 14:44:36 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LindaWildes @magwa101 They wont discuss the issues!
930083894636040196 2017-11-13 14:44:15 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @Kris_Sacrebleu @LindaWildes @Okieblue67 There is no good in Doug Jones or his supporters that attack people all the time
930083722661191680 2017-11-13 14:43:34 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LindaWildes @kal30 You can be sick of hearing them because the @washingtonpost story needs to be fact checked especially since one of the people is a democrat operative and 40 years give me a break
930083370268286976 2017-11-13 14:42:10 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LindaWildes @gglightbulb Nothing good about Doug Jones has came out.  He is a snake and his supporters are people who attack at every word but cant defend his positions on anything
930083115162365954 2017-11-13 14:41:09 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LindaWildes @alcacountry I see Doug Jones as a snake just like those DemocRats!! Doug Jones supporters have attacked me many occasions because they cant defend his open border, sanctuary city, and abortion stands for Alabama to swallow it
930082580183109633 2017-11-13 14:39:01 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LindaWildes @alcacountry Thats a lie I have been attacked by Jones supporters about this try again
930082356987351040 2017-11-13 14:38:08 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @LindaWildes No dont bother pack him up and ship him to California his views fit right in with those of liberal globalist.  That do not hold Alabama values!
930081593326231553 2017-11-13 14:35:06 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @ALcomMobile @DaHyundaiLawyer Because Moore should sue them for Defamation your in California stay over there and keep your liberal politics there as well
930081018484285441 2017-11-13 14:32:49 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @tampagirl19655 @mindyfinn Here is whats dangerous!  The establishment from both sides ruining our country.  Thats dangerous. When you have a left leaning Washington Post publishing a story they could not prove that is almost 40 years old right after endorsing Jones thats Dangerous #IsupportJudgeMoore
930079683361812480 2017-11-13 14:27:31 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @tampagirl19655 @SteveSchmidtSES If the people of Alabama believe a really sorry piece of work like the story that was published then they deserve what they get.  But I will stand with Roy Moore until they produce proof just a lot of people.  I will not vote for a murderer!
930078571795795968 2017-11-13 14:23:06 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @aldotcom I do not believe this garbage.  I believe Moore has the lead because everybody sees through these allegations especially where they came from

929811282299117569 2017-11-12 20:40:59 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> The @washingtonpost is a left wing radical fake news organization.  That endorsed Doug Jones then ran a distasteful article about Judge Moore #RoyMoore4Senate
929810922092318720 2017-11-12 20:39:33 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> Yall are some disturbing people.  You want to see Child molesters look at the Democratic Party and supporters yall are disgusting and disgraceful.  I will still cast my vote for Roy Moore because it does not take 30 years to say something about a politician and
929807584697225216 2017-11-12 20:26:17 UTC <AlabamaRacer05> @RVAwonk Some of the people posting on this show the ignorance of people.
