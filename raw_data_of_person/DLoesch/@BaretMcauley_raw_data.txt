Hes a Tragedy on his own, doing nothing for Canadians but attempting to relieve us of our rights and any wealth we have. He will however give both of the previously mentioned away to any Muslim foreigners. My condolences

957591597096386560 2018-01-28 12:30:02 UTC <BaretMcauley> @nowthisnews Your information is erroneous. It was actually the dems who were responsible for the shutdown. Trump has been trying to get a solution for dreamers through - but dems have rejected it. Ps. Trump didnt create the problem - hes just the ONE trying to deal with it. Wise up.
