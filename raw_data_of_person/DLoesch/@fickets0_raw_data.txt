I couldve stopped it, I couldve worked harder, but I chose not to. Also, the second half of your argument is invalid because there is a multitude of examples of people becoming successful through hard work.

I can maintain, increase, or decrease my well being. If I wanted to be a lazy shit I can, if I want to be the best worker in the room I can also do that. If I want to fly under the radar and stay where I am, I can.

The only time I can see communism working is with an outside influence increasing the need for a societal survival. If there is no threat to a society then there is no need to push it if it stands on its own.
968213215598407680 2018-02-26 19:56:33 UTC <fickets0> @BV @business @MTalisker18 @JoelHeyman @soniabertran @cradgr Theres no death for working at your own pace, the only way to regulate workers from being lazy (& getting stuff done) is by a tyrannical rule. Eventually without a positive incentive the workforce will quit and to keep that from happening you will have to force them to work.

Rulers that are generally found in semi-communist or full communist nations.

Basically work or die, and we know with human nature that negative incentives dont work.

968184413887463432 2018-02-26 18:02:06 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @soWWMD And either way, Trump is for states rights, and this is an individual state issue.
968183899825176578 2018-02-26 18:00:04 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @soWWMD But that doesnt mean he controls the opinions of the DOJ, they are still in control of their own doings. He can give his suggestions but doesnt ultimately control what they do. They can either listen to the suggestion or not and risk firing but Trump hasnt touched Sessions.

967208234535669761 2018-02-23 01:23:07 UTC <fickets0> @P0psonX That huge menu fuckin sucked honestly, and we were understaffed, I had a night where it was just me on the line with my co-cook stuck making 10+ pizzas at once with 3 tables of 8+ each on my side. We were a smokehouse/bar that shared a kitchen with a bowling alley.
967203469781118981 2018-02-23 01:04:11 UTC <fickets0> @P0psonX Salmon, steak, burgers, smoked ribs, smoked brisket,grilled chicken, pizzas, various salads, smoked wings, and various fried foods. It was a smokehouse back when I was still there. Now they cut it all down to just burgers.
967202519423229952 2018-02-23 01:00:25 UTC <fickets0> @P0psonX I feel that, I didnt feel good at it until I promoted from dishwasher to cook at my last job

966723948942512128 2018-02-22 17:18:44 UTC <fickets0> @FBI @Reuters @MrTonyMan Im not gonna repeat myself regarding your ignorance.
966723779471728640 2018-02-22 17:18:04 UTC <fickets0> @Reuters @MrTonyMan @kickazzdad Security helps, security cameras more, fencing in the entire school probably did the most when they did that my junior year. Then theyd only need a guard at each gate instead of patrolling large areas and possibly missing something.
966722267206975488 2018-02-22 17:12:03 UTC <fickets0> @Reuters @MrTonyMan Youre not gonna stop a terrorist with gun control, youre not gonna help people with mental issues with gun control, youre not going to fix religion, politics, or anything of the sort with gun control. So its a safe bet that you cant protect kids with it either.
966721538316582912 2018-02-22 17:09:10 UTC <fickets0> The rich people who are saying #GunControlNow also have armed guards at their homes
966720837834297344 2018-02-22 17:06:23 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @Back2Sanity @Pkunkorz Okay Mr. ignorance
966720653083619328 2018-02-22 17:05:39 UTC <fickets0> @Reuters @MrTonyMan Yes, the actual definition of terrorism, doesnt care. School shootings are not defined as terrorism as a terroristic act has to be politically or religiously motivated.
966720301215051776 2018-02-22 17:04:15 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @Back2Sanity *loses argument* youre just a troll! -@Pkunkorz
966720042623578113 2018-02-22 17:03:13 UTC <fickets0> @Reuters @MrTonyMan @kickazzdad Exactly, best way to go about it. The high school I went to here in Cali had 7-8 security guards, most of them already big and scary, just add a gun and no one would do anything.
966719709310738432 2018-02-22 17:01:54 UTC <fickets0> @Reuters @MrTonyMan When did I say armed guards at school was a stupid idea? I think arming the teachers specifically is a dumb idea, but I mean its a fact, terrorism doesnt care for your security.
966719437414920192 2018-02-22 17:00:49 UTC <fickets0> @Reuters @kickazzdad @MrTonyMan Hes not saying that it should be done, hes using it as a way to show that if you take away guns it isnt going to stop the violence. Example includes acid attacks in the UK and van attacks in France and Spain. Critical thinking is a must in the real world, try it sometime.
966718882122625024 2018-02-22 16:58:36 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @Back2Sanity @Pkunkorz An unintelligent and loosely based response from someone who cant get their head away from a screen to look into the real world? Okay 
966718658285248512 2018-02-22 16:57:43 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @Back2Sanity You literally specified on multiple occasions white people and the things white people do wrong. You are a racist.
966718482648739840 2018-02-22 16:57:01 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @Pkunkorz Im asserting that they dont have any clue what they are talking about and are only saying something because of the background of the organization that used it. They wouldnt care if the baby killers over at planned parenthood used it.
966718150417956864 2018-02-22 16:55:42 UTC <fickets0> @Reuters @MrTonyMan @kickazzdad I just dont feel like arming teachers is a good thing, only because thats extra time until a teacher can be hired (because of training and background checks) when we already dont have a lot of teachers
966717776495747072 2018-02-22 16:54:13 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @Back2Sanity @Pkunkorz Movies arent real life, grow up.
966717666521055232 2018-02-22 16:53:47 UTC <fickets0> @Reuters @MrTonyMan Also, terrorism doesnt care about your security, thats kinda the point of terrorism.
966717220200972289 2018-02-22 16:52:00 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @Pkunkorz Yes, because a tv show equates to real life all the time, cant wait to fly those dragons from game of thrones!
966717055222165504 2018-02-22 16:51:21 UTC <fickets0> @Reuters @MrTonyMan So explain illegally obtained guns and how gun control effects them? I means a majority of mass shootings happen with illegally obtained weapons.
966716443852091392 2018-02-22 16:48:55 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @Back2Sanity Obviously isnt ignored if they have strict gun control, the only reason its a big deal is because it is whites killing people (as you said) because in the mainstream medias eyes, the only people that can do anything wrong is whites. But please, continue to spout their racism
966716027345149952 2018-02-22 16:47:16 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @JFitz806 Ronald Reagan also let his wife push the War on Drugs, causing unnecessary deaths and life sentences to a multitude of non-diverse groups of individuals, large amounts of wasted police force and tax dollars, just to stop the drug trade the CIA caused with the crack epidemic.
966715394378510337 2018-02-22 16:44:45 UTC <fickets0> @Reuters @MrTonyMan @kickazzdad So how often is this armed guard at the school? Long enough to have a presence? Or just shows up randomly? If its the latter then no shit there is no deterrence from it.
966714785793417216 2018-02-22 16:42:20 UTC <fickets0> @Reuters @MrTonyMan What is this 1972? When guns were easier to get and 10X less regulated? And an UZI as the weapon in question? When fully-auto weapons are illegals? So that means this gun was probably obtained illegally, meaning gun control doesnt work.
966714231721680896 2018-02-22 16:40:08 UTC <fickets0> @CNNPR It wouldnt be the first time CNN gave questions to someone, cant quite put my finger on it 
966713357477724161 2018-02-22 16:36:39 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @Back2Sanity Has*** not why
966713130146447360 2018-02-22 16:35:45 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @Back2Sanity Youre a racist if youre gonna say white men are the cause of shootings. How about we look at Chicagos gun related crime statistics. You know Chicago? With the the strictest gun control in the nation? Also why the highest gun violence rates in the nation? Mostly non-white too?
966712689958404097 2018-02-22 16:34:00 UTC <fickets0> @nypost Racist soy boy Trudoy
966712521913655296 2018-02-22 16:33:20 UTC <fickets0> @Reuters I think a single armed guard on campus would be enough of a deterrence in itself.

966711046403637248 2018-02-22 16:27:28 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @Back2Sanity Yes, people who barely know the definition of hard work know everything...yah...either way, a majority of the shootings youre describing were perpetrated by people with illegally obtained weapons, or they had serious psychological problems that came about after purchasing guns
966710388774486016 2018-02-22 16:24:51 UTC <fickets0> @realCharter Prostitution should be legal but it should be restricted to regulated brothels with mandatory condom use and heavy security.  Basically anything to make the whole exchange safer for both parties

966708458660675584 2018-02-22 16:17:11 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews Look! More actors thinking they know anything! Thanks Hollywood!
966708272337162240 2018-02-22 16:16:27 UTC <fickets0> @PeterSweden7 Liberals, Democrats, the left, whatever you call them, they all hate white people more than the KKK hates black people.
966707947475648512 2018-02-22 16:15:09 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews Hmmm, what was the cause of that shooting again?  Cant quite put my finger on it, its on the tip of my tongue.. oh yah, RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. What is banning guns going to do about that when they use trucks and vans to kill 80+ people in Europe?
966705933026914305 2018-02-22 16:07:09 UTC <fickets0> Good luck getting jack-shit to happen. No one gives a fuck about yall cucks.https://twitter.com/_projectwakeup/status/966485408027525121
966705596983427078 2018-02-22 16:05:49 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @rebornrasta Looks more to me that theyre talking about extremist groups
966573790455975936 2018-02-21 07:22:04 UTC <fickets0> @splcenter @thedailybeast Since 2014...before the creation of the alt-right...okay...
966573787817811969 2018-02-21 07:22:03 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @shrimpfajita You mean the same group that was selling drugs, obtaining illegal firearms, killing police officers and civilians, and causing politically based violence? Sounds like a terrorist organization
966573784252661761 2018-02-21 07:22:02 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @rebornrasta How is it different? Both are causing violence (as implied) why talk about one side and not the other?
966566285545844736 2018-02-21 06:52:15 UTC <fickets0> @nypost Who does?

966556928473100288 2018-02-21 06:15:04 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews All those tax dollars to public schooling just going down the drain.
966556671555153920 2018-02-21 06:14:02 UTC <fickets0> @FoxNews 100 emotionally immature and damaged kids try to weigh in on stuff they know little to nothing about
966555791913201665 2018-02-21 06:10:33 UTC <fickets0> @FoxNews If the bartender pours the fatal drink it is the businesss liability (and then the bartender)

966555213229256704 2018-02-21 06:08:15 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @shrimpfajita Pretty sure those businesses that were destroyed in Berkeley werent fascist owned

966553985254436864 2018-02-21 06:03:22 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews Now talk about the domestic terrorist organization known as #Antifa
966553355341320192 2018-02-21 06:00:52 UTC <fickets0> @Breaking911 What does it matter if he does? Democrat law makers take money from Planned Parenthood and they kill babies and sell the parts on the black market.

966050909959569409 2018-02-20 20:44:19 UTC <fickets0> @ShakunetsuHadou You do realize legal AR-15 are semi automatic correct? A fully automatic rifle is completely illegal for the average citizen. Only people who can purchase them are special weapons dealers that have special, and near impossible to obtain, dealers license
966050536662315008 2018-02-20 20:42:50 UTC <fickets0> @ShakunetsuHadou That*** not had
966050429363613696 2018-02-20 20:42:25 UTC <fickets0> @ShakunetsuHadou Not too many pistols or shot guns that will work accurately if you have large properties, and congrats kid, youre one of the people had can put up with it, not everyone is like you.
966049427176607744 2018-02-20 20:38:26 UTC <fickets0> @dcexaminer Not wrong, unless you want to include how he got that way as the cause but I guess its easiest to stop here...
966049117209214976 2018-02-20 20:37:12 UTC <fickets0> @la15plunkett @SonOfRandolph He flat out said he helped in the interview, no doubt about it. Like I said, get to goose stepping.
966048824568430598 2018-02-20 20:36:02 UTC <fickets0> @ShakunetsuHadou Sport and home defense, the dude got the gun and did everything right, the main reason he did it was the bullying he more than likely had to face daily. Like every other school shooter in history it all leads back to how they were treated by fellow classmates.
966048469692571648 2018-02-20 20:34:38 UTC <fickets0> @la15plunkett @SonOfRandolph I never lied, I said what I heard and it didnt fall into your views of the world and you got upset, now why dont you just goose step out of here.
966047746254716928 2018-02-20 20:31:45 UTC <fickets0> @la15plunkett @SonOfRandolph He said it clear as day in the initial interviews, if youre choosing to interpret it differently its probably because you also are an anti-Semite
966047477391441920 2018-02-20 20:30:41 UTC <fickets0> @BuzzFeedNews @Raptornx01 What?
966047372059881473 2018-02-20 20:30:16 UTC <fickets0> - mandatory, rigorous background check - restrictions based on medical history - inability to purchase specific types of guns until later ages - parents permission under 18 - serial numbered weapons tied to your name and social - strict storage laws - bans on specific guns Surehttps://twitter.com/shakunetsuhadou/status/966045970675961856
966045782477438976 2018-02-20 20:23:57 UTC <fickets0> @la15plunkett @SonOfRandolph Why clarify with an anti-Semite?
966042665518157824 2018-02-20 20:11:34 UTC <fickets0> @Breaking911 Maybe the problem isnt the guns, maybe its the bullying, just a thought.
966040684741378048 2018-02-20 20:03:42 UTC <fickets0> @FoxNews  what a joke

966040080845455362 2018-02-20 20:01:18 UTC <fickets0> @Breaking911 But women and men are equal in every way! MUH EQUALITY!
966039862687100928 2018-02-20 20:00:26 UTC <fickets0> @la15plunkett @SonOfRandolph Why are you still defending the nazis? Are you a neo-nazi? Where are your skin head friends? Oh thats right, youre a bot lmao.
966039554380541952 2018-02-20 19:59:12 UTC <fickets0> @SonOfRandolph @la15plunkett Just the fact hes getting so upset over me pointing out how he hates Jews is what is keeping me here
966021794971901953 2018-02-20 18:48:38 UTC <fickets0> @la15plunkett @SonOfRandolph Watch the interview for your evidence

965839415741267969 2018-02-19 06:43:55 UTC <fickets0> @nypost @la15plunkett @SonOfRandolph When you defended a known nazi collaborator

965709770043801600 2018-02-19 22:08:45 UTC <fickets0> @nypost @la15plunkett @SonOfRandolph 1. He was talking about your followers to followed by ratio. 2. Welcome to the internet.
965696896881762304 2018-02-19 21:17:36 UTC <fickets0> @nypost @la15plunkett @SonOfRandolph I had more till I got suspended, either way, the 10 to 132 ratio brings credibility into question. And like i said, a bot would take what he said word for word, a human would know he meant man
965696293606588418 2018-02-19 21:15:12 UTC <fickets0> @nypost @la15plunkett @SonOfRandolph A bot wouldnt automatically know what he meant, just go off of what was typed
965696105542336512 2018-02-19 21:14:27 UTC <fickets0> @nypost @SonOfRandolph Im not guessing because I heard what he said, you just cant come to terms with the fact your employer helped the nazis
965695865716224000 2018-02-19 21:13:30 UTC <fickets0> @nypost @SonOfRandolph @la15plunkett I noticed it too, that was why I was questioning his credibility
965687192373751808 2018-02-19 20:39:02 UTC <fickets0> @nypost @la15plunkett @SonOfRandolph Says the anti-Semite defending known nazi collaborators.

965682004850221056 2018-02-19 20:18:26 UTC <fickets0> @madisongesiotto Thank you!
965681598313111552 2018-02-19 20:16:49 UTC <fickets0> @nypost @SonOfRandolph He definitely does, and even if I am getting that part wrong he did in fact admit to helping the nazis as a teenager, I might just be trying to downplay what he probably did subconsciously. Either way, your undying defense of this guy brings your credibility into question.
965680597174644736 2018-02-19 20:12:50 UTC <fickets0> Who generally takes down active shooters? Other people with legally owned guns. Whos gonna stop active shooters who have illegally owned guns? *crickets*
965680181368143872 2018-02-19 20:11:11 UTC <fickets0> @nypost @SonOfRandolph Yes I have watched it, and he states that he did in fact help, why are you so adamant about this?
965679223124865026 2018-02-19 20:07:22 UTC <fickets0> @nypost @SonOfRandolph It was in the interview
965678630037733376 2018-02-19 20:05:01 UTC <fickets0> *beats body dysmorphia by becoming body positive*  *actually becomes over weight with multitude of health problems because of it*
965676464308764673 2018-02-19 19:56:25 UTC <fickets0> @tribelaw Teens between 14 & 18 also think that clothes and how many followers you have on instagram matters. They are not psychologically fit to vote, I know for a fact I wasnt & barely am now at 21, I barely feel like anyone under the age of 25 is (brain finishes development around 25)
965675378017681409 2018-02-19 19:52:06 UTC <fickets0> @nypost @SonOfRandolph He admitted to helping the nazis with loading train cars, you dont have to be an adult to handle baggage, why are you so hell bent on trying to falsify the truth?
965674943634595840 2018-02-19 19:50:22 UTC <fickets0> Charles Manson got the death penalty for convincing others to commit a handful of murders, yet the liberals are praising people like Stalin and Mao who committed genocide.
965674325314433025 2018-02-19 19:47:55 UTC <fickets0> @nypost @SonOfRandolph I know he didnt say it, but other Nazi collaborators did, which he in fact was a Nazi collaborator.

965668049176035329 2018-02-19 19:22:58 UTC <fickets0> @dcexaminer @jenniferbeing Its not free the parents still have to pay it, its just determined through your taxes rather than with upfront payments. Either way I couldnt tell you how many kids at the HS I went to had $100+ clothing and still got free lunch.
965667595427840000 2018-02-19 19:21:10 UTC <fickets0> @nypost @SonOfRandolph He said he helped the nazis, I didnt specify state what he did (loaded luggage onto the train carts headed for warehouses instead of the death camps), but he did in fact admit to it.
965667155613138944 2018-02-19 19:19:25 UTC <fickets0> @mattyglesias You mean the group of people who worry about themselves above anyone else should have the right to vote on things involving how other people will be effected? This, by the way, coming from someone who graduated High School 3 years ago.

965659731288145922 2018-02-19 18:49:55 UTC <fickets0> @dcexaminer @jenniferbeing To put it basically, cut some off the top of each program. Any spending used for giving away free money should be cut and placed in new and better ways to make us safe. Same thing we did with Air Marshals and airport security after 9/11, we didnt just get rid of airplanes.
965655276668862464 2018-02-19 18:32:13 UTC <fickets0> @dcexaminer @jenniferbeing Cut the spending on social welfare and use it for that.

965653416369270784 2018-02-19 18:24:50 UTC <fickets0> @dcexaminer @jenniferbeing To which part of the argument, the gun control side or keeping schools safer side? Because the only genuine way to make the schools safer is with armed guards.

965652778272964609 2018-02-19 18:22:17 UTC <fickets0> @TheyLovethePuff It isnt harder, you can go and buy a car and drive it off the lot the same day. You have to go through background checks that take time in order to get a gun and in most states it has to be delivered to you. And yes they monitor your guns if they are LEGAL, key word is legal.
965648065355894785 2018-02-19 18:03:34 UTC <fickets0> @dcexaminer @jenniferbeing I care, but there is better alternatives to taking away guns

965644863327711232 2018-02-19 17:50:50 UTC <fickets0> @TheyLovethePuff And Id like to assume that if you illegally obtained a gun then you probably plan on using it illegally
965644648302575616 2018-02-19 17:49:59 UTC <fickets0> @TheyLovethePuff Are you serious? You do know that every single gun in the United States is serial numbered and the serial number is registered to your social security number right? If you have an gun with out a serial number you are already committing a felony.
965644322375790592 2018-02-19 17:48:41 UTC <fickets0> @dcexaminer Youre literally surrounded by armed guards trained to kill anything that poses a threat to anyone on the premises, why need a gun at this moment in time?

I mean, killing your pets is an option when you cant have them anymore (ie moving to new place), weird how a majority of people generally put them up for adoption instead.
965641828635574272 2018-02-19 17:38:47 UTC <fickets0> They have the strictest gun regulatory laws also, I dont just mean purchasing. Someone is a little obsessed with me, Im flattered.https://twitter.com/theylovethepuff/status/965641235758223361

But assuming they arent complete idiots, theyd use contraceptives. Either way, you dont want a kid: either be smart when you have sex, give the kid up for adoption (for families who cant have kids), or dont have sex.
965633733859581953 2018-02-19 17:06:37 UTC <fickets0> @nypost Because there were Jews that helped the nazis, most major nazi scientists were Jewish, George Soros has even admitted to helping the nazis.

965621708030803968 2018-02-19 16:18:50 UTC <fickets0> @realCharter @p4ddyc4kes @TheyLovethePuff You cant be allergic to birth control and still take plan B, Plan B is the same chemicals as birth control pills just 4X stronger.
965621442824962048 2018-02-19 16:17:47 UTC <fickets0> @realCharter @p4ddyc4kes @TheyLovethePuff I have legitimately taken multiple classes on sexual health in college, tell me more about my subject.
965621098443194369 2018-02-19 16:16:24 UTC <fickets0> @realCharter @TheyLovethePuff @p4ddyc4kes And probably cant even afford the abortion in the first place.
965620985008308224 2018-02-19 16:15:57 UTC <fickets0> @realCharter @p4ddyc4kes @TheyLovethePuff If you cant afford a $15 pack of condoms then I doubt you can afford an abortions. Plus, if youre allergic to birth control then you cant have children anyway because it is the same chemical your body produces when pregnant. No argument on the rape part, Im for it there.
965620364888780800 2018-02-19 16:13:30 UTC <fickets0> @realCharter @p4ddyc4kes @TheyLovethePuff So you admit contraceptives work, FYI plan B is a contraceptive. Its made of the same chemical as birth control just 4X the dosage in one pill.
965620139373740032 2018-02-19 16:12:36 UTC <fickets0> @realCharter @p4ddyc4kes @TheyLovethePuff Not if you take the necessary precautions, because if you do get pregnant while on multiple contraceptives birth control, spermicide, condoms then that baby is a miracle
965619749093761025 2018-02-19 16:11:03 UTC <fickets0> @realCharter @p4ddyc4kes @TheyLovethePuff Since youre not smart enough to understand statistics Ill be youve had an abortion
965619592411299842 2018-02-19 16:10:25 UTC <fickets0> @realCharter @TheyLovethePuff So can abortions
965619533594505216 2018-02-19 16:10:11 UTC <fickets0> @realCharter @TheyLovethePuff So youd rather be selfish from the sounds of it, and at that point it is your fault for being stupid.
965619370863947777 2018-02-19 16:09:33 UTC <fickets0> @realCharter @p4ddyc4kes @TheyLovethePuff Condoms are 99.8% effective
965619265863692289 2018-02-19 16:09:07 UTC <fickets0> @realCharter @TheyLovethePuff You have that control, its called birth control
965619148347748352 2018-02-19 16:08:39 UTC <fickets0> @realCharter @p4ddyc4kes @TheyLovethePuff But the likelihood goes way down, be smart and prevent it before it happens for be stupid and pay more after the fact.

965618530879029249 2018-02-19 16:06:12 UTC <fickets0> @realCharter @TheyLovethePuff Just because they arent 100% doesnt mean you shouldnt at least attempt them, & if you believe youre smart enough to make the decision of killing a baby then Id assume youre smart enough to know when to take Plan B, and if you can afford an abortion you can afford to be safe
965617658174488577 2018-02-19 16:02:44 UTC <fickets0> @realCharter @TheyLovethePuff So just because those ways dont work perfectly it means you can kill babies as you please?
965616573045096448 2018-02-19 15:58:25 UTC <fickets0> @realCharter @TheyLovethePuff There are things such as preventative measures and if youre not smart enough to do these things then why do you think youre smart enough to make that decisions?

964613158387134464 2018-02-16 21:31:13 UTC <fickets0> @robreiner How much did planned parenthood spending to be able to kill babies on the govts dime?

964578993679691776 2018-02-16 19:15:27 UTC <fickets0> @Breaking911 @DynamiteWilly19 And I know that nothing was ever passed protecting DACA recipients, so the Dems gave in and the govt started again. The Dems dont care.
964574925074841601 2018-02-16 18:59:17 UTC <fickets0> @Breaking911 @DynamiteWilly19 You mean the govt shutdown caused by the Dems that got nothing they wanted done and actually got Americans more tax cuts (thanks to reps) instead? Maybe the nation that has this danger should take care of itself instead. Also, Im a registered independent, not republican

964546570753474560 2018-02-16 17:06:37 UTC <fickets0> @AP @Breaking911 This didnt age well.
964546460489416704 2018-02-16 17:06:11 UTC <fickets0> @dcexaminer Hes implemented a ban on people traveling from a multitude of middle eastern countries, so Id say hes done a lot to lessen violence in general.

964326172430540800 2018-02-15 02:30:50 UTC <fickets0> @TomiLahren @Queenzogie Explain why Chicago has both the strictest gun control laws but also the most gun related deaths in the nation, weekly.
964322909169729536 2018-02-15 02:17:52 UTC <fickets0> @emigre80 Dont worry, Ill make sure to argue that your death couldve been prevented by having more legal gun owners

964282302896398336 2018-02-15 23:36:31 UTC <fickets0> @piersmorgan I dont recall laws being changed after the Pulse nightclub shooting, or the one in San Bernadino? 
964282032967659520 2018-02-15 23:35:26 UTC <fickets0> @Timcast Weird how theyre classified as white nationalist when they are barely nationalist and closer to communist

964230719672209408 2018-02-15 20:11:32 UTC <fickets0> @cjchivers Thats why the NRA teaches firearm safety procedures and legally you have to lock up your guns anyway

963872722601238528 2018-02-14 20:28:59 UTC <fickets0> @P0psonX The fact tattoos are permanent is probably a good explanation.
963872287484141568 2018-02-14 20:27:15 UTC <fickets0> @nypost Probably because the North wont pay for them
963872048735952896 2018-02-14 20:26:18 UTC <fickets0> @P0psonX Your perspective of things wouldve probably come out differently if your grandma had tattoos
963783815599611904 2018-02-14 14:35:42 UTC <fickets0> Someone needs to take down those #Resistance billboards in south and West Sacramento. Ive also noticed theyre in poor neighborhoods
963519035978563584 2018-02-13 21:03:34 UTC <fickets0> @PeterSweden7 @ResistRF Way to make yourself look even more out of touch with reality.
963517995258490880 2018-02-13 20:59:26 UTC <fickets0> @DRUDGE_REPORT But was it a Russian military tank or an independent contractors tank?

963503288187420672 2018-02-13 20:00:59 UTC <fickets0> @P0psonX Its a sin in the Bible in the three major religions to get permanent body modifications I believe

Heavy tensions between the parties in California 3. Lazy Californians  4. Pacifist Californians  5. Texas loyalists in California

The differences between Cali and Texas are way smaller than Germany and the Netherlands circa 1939

Think of the bigger picture, quit relating then to now because its not logical to. Think critically, not ignorantly.

954747890605342720 2018-01-20 16:10:10 UTC <fickets0> @theactioncorps Fair wage and better education already exists in the US, if these things arent happening its mostly isolated communities or down to the individuals, not systematically. If women were paid less for the same job in the US men would almost never be hired.

948582013677662210 2018-01-03 15:49:10 UTC <fickets0> @P0psonX Giving millions to minorities for doing practically nothing? Embarrassing the American nation on live television? Sounds like liberals to me
948580988510072832 2018-01-03 15:45:06 UTC <fickets0> @P0psonX Why would liberals want you to boycott a mostly minority institution?
948580001393160192 2018-01-03 15:41:10 UTC <fickets0> @dcexaminer Meryl Streep supported Bill Clinton, what a hypocrite
948579455991083008 2018-01-03 15:39:00 UTC <fickets0> @P0psonX White liberals want you to watch the NFL so you show support to the millionaires that tell us to hate cops

948390660326940672 2018-01-02 03:08:48 UTC <fickets0> @Newsweek How does Trump have anything to do with how a private company like Twitter does its business? Especially a known left leaning company? You are #FakeNews

Plus, we know Hillary isnt above doing worse. Bernie shouldve beat Hillary, I still wouldve voted Trump either way but I definitely believe Bernie wouldve won.

946024632775143425 2017-12-27 14:27:03 UTC <fickets0> @nypost Multiple people predicted an attack like the one orchestrated on 9/11 would happen, they just didnt know when or where the attack would take place. Its also not hard to imagine that with the fall of one major terrorist org (Al Qaeda) another would rise (ISIS)

945926015783657473 2017-12-26 07:55:11 UTC <fickets0> @nytimes Looking back to what Ive learned about Churchill it does seem similar now that you mention it.
945925239891902464 2017-12-26 07:52:06 UTC <fickets0> Not sure what it is, Ive always been able to almost immediately stop worrying or caring. Whenever me and someone argue Im usually able to drop it quick. That actually makes things difficult because I want to fix things near immediately when others are still caught up in emotion

945896824522489857 2017-12-26 05:59:11 UTC <fickets0> @comradestumpII Hes honestly so smart he fooled most of the nation of France and almost every single alt-righter
945896577440268288 2017-12-26 05:58:12 UTC <fickets0> @Reuters EPA is why nothing gets done for our infrastructure, so who cares what happens to them?

945895740554993664 2017-12-26 05:54:53 UTC <fickets0> @JamesMartinSJ @NybergWallsten Its more likely a women would be convicted of sexual assault rather than rape
945895379400138753 2017-12-26 05:53:26 UTC <fickets0> One of my favorite songs of all time honestly, its also about doing heroine
945894808421244928 2017-12-26 05:51:10 UTC <fickets0> @JamesMartinSJ @NybergWallsten Lmao, so they went to people and asked have you ever been suspected of convicted of rape? and a majority said nope? 99.78% seems plausible if you lack critical thinking skills.
945893995615436800 2017-12-26 05:47:57 UTC <fickets0> @JamesMartinSJ @NybergWallsten Thats because in a legal sense it is only rape if there is unwanted penetration, females dont usually do the penetrating
945893699094843394 2017-12-26 05:46:46 UTC <fickets0> Thats because economics is a useless thing for us to learn past the semester we take in highschool if you dont plan on doing anything in it. Now if they taught personal economics along with it I could see it being useful
945892353742536710 2017-12-26 05:41:25 UTC <fickets0> @JamesMartinSJ @NybergWallsten Also, if rape is a man problem how do you explain female rapists? Or female child predators?
945892182262669312 2017-12-26 05:40:44 UTC <fickets0> @comradestumpII Good manipulator too
945891937315299328 2017-12-26 05:39:46 UTC <fickets0> @JamesMartinSJ @NybergWallsten But when you practice a cult that preaches it is okay to rape infidel women it becomes a cultural problem, the culture a majority of these refugees come from.
945891508980289536 2017-12-26 05:38:04 UTC <fickets0> Not sure Id say millionaires understand economics, in fact I think its fair in saying a majority of millionaires dont understand economics, business more than likely, but economics highly unlikely. Also Id bet the people on wallstreet went to school for economics
945890368297381888 2017-12-26 05:33:32 UTC <fickets0> @dcexaminer Hes not wrong tho
945890157865009152 2017-12-26 05:32:42 UTC <fickets0> "All these poor people can keep waiting for this trickle down. They've been waiting for like 400 years and it ain't trickled down yet." What a moron.https://twitter.com/dcexaminer/status/945887231629197313
945889853194960896 2017-12-26 05:31:29 UTC <fickets0> Id like to bet an economics major may know something
945889327145295872 2017-12-26 05:29:24 UTC <fickets0> @JamesMartinSJ @NybergWallsten And yes it did happen, within the last month or two
945889243930304513 2017-12-26 05:29:04 UTC <fickets0> @JamesMartinSJ @NybergWallsten I think its worse when the rapists came to the nation and are taking advantage of the population there just because they know the likelihood of them getting thrown in jail/deported is lower than that of the women getting arrested for indecent exposure.

945859860662435840 2017-12-26 03:32:18 UTC <fickets0> Idk if you could do it because then you have to pretend to like blacks to be accepted in society

930893186762915840 2017-11-15 20:20:05 UTC <fickets0> @PrisonPlanet @MrFairhurst How have you seen them if you just said we never see his arms?
930889113783353344 2017-11-15 20:03:54 UTC <fickets0> @PrisonPlanet @MrFairhurst Im sayin your reasoning of never seeing his arms doesnt conclude anything, and I believe your friend about as much as I believe the average politician, not very much.
930871271776174080 2017-11-15 18:53:00 UTC <fickets0> @PrisonPlanet @MrFairhurst I dont like to show my arms and Im not a heroin addict, Im just underweight

930858703418298368 2017-11-15 18:03:04 UTC <fickets0> @MileyCyrus How does this have anything to do with equality? Isnt this cultural appropriation?
930857812892069888 2017-11-15 17:59:31 UTC <fickets0> @voxdotcom @JoAnnieEl @JayAlver @mcdonough_sean Stuff did come out of it, Hillary had it buried and paid off Juanita and the other women Bill raped
930857534310662144 2017-11-15 17:58:25 UTC <fickets0> @voxdotcom @JoAnnieEl Bill also raped Juanita Broderick

930817579362304000 2017-11-15 15:19:39 UTC <fickets0> @PrisonPlanet @MrFairhurst Proof?
930805960074915840 2017-11-15 14:33:29 UTC <fickets0> @PrisonPlanet @MrFairhurst Doesnt make sense, controlled substance uses doesnt automatically mean unhealthy
930757913362145280 2017-11-15 11:22:33 UTC <fickets0> @LeftisEvilX They try to be as lazy as possible while hiding under the protection of the unions, and the little work they do actually complete, sucks.
930756531921960960 2017-11-15 11:17:04 UTC <fickets0> @Cernovich Him and Robby also killed Marilyn Monroe
930756139406331907 2017-11-15 11:15:30 UTC <fickets0> @PrisonPlanet Id rather it be privileged toward the healthy rather than the unhealthy

930522339405578240 2017-11-14 19:46:28 UTC <fickets0> @TRobinsonNewEra @Wanderer_RH Do you care about the children being molested by gangs of Islamic refugees? Obviously not if youre hear attacking Tommy, one of the only people brave enough to stand up for the truth and not shy away from it when it turns negative
930522043002396672 2017-11-14 19:45:17 UTC <fickets0> @TRobinsonNewEra @Wanderer_RH Obama didnt do anything as president but start the affordable care act, NRA members dont commit mass shootings, in fact the man who stopped the Texas church shooter was a former NRA instructor with a legally owned rifle.
930521020976394240 2017-11-14 19:41:14 UTC <fickets0> @Cernovich @brinjak Maybe I should rephrase, a person may be more comfortable admitting stuff like this to a piece of paper rather than a friend or possible lover.
930520245730557952 2017-11-14 19:38:09 UTC <fickets0> @TRobinsonNewEra @Wanderer_RH Gun control doesnt work, example would be Chicago, the city with the harshest gun control laws in the nation, also has the most gun related crimes.
930517114409984000 2017-11-14 19:25:42 UTC <fickets0> @TRobinsonNewEra @Wanderer_RH Actually, its doing better than it has been in the past couple of decades, quit choking on the mainstream media
930509498204094464 2017-11-14 18:55:27 UTC <fickets0> @TRobinsonNewEra @Wanderer_RH Says the person who would rather see his country fall apart, sit down.

930486813625499648 2017-11-14 17:25:18 UTC <fickets0> @willsommer I can only assume that the concoction was some kind of fruit and veggie mix with probably kale and other things to help kill fat cells. Sounds like an all liquid diet

930257279600824325 2017-11-13 02:13:13 UTC <fickets0> @Douche_McGraw All speculation, no definitive evidence yet either way
930255728492736512 2017-11-13 02:07:03 UTC <fickets0> @Douche_McGraw Not sure how it could be illegal though? Legality depends on what was discussed
