970816977420935168 2018-03-05 00:22:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @dlongenecker1 BRAVO!!!!! A comment worthy of St. Augustine's succinct wisdom! Thank you, Father.
970706239868014592 2018-03-05 17:02:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @charliekirk11 Hypocrisy on parade!
969278345102979072 2018-03-01 18:29:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Come to Texas, Mr. Woods. We would love to have you down here!
968855085336981507 2018-02-28 14:27:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @dlongenecker1 I think we have to wait until we get to Heaven for all of those criteria to be met.
968154725978910721 2018-02-26 16:04:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @charliekirk11 Anyone who is taking any drug that enhances your ability to perform better in a sport should not be allowed to compete. If the person wants to wrestle, then they need to do it without taking any drugs. If they want to transition to male, then don't compete during the transition.
968128218237632512 2018-02-26 14:18:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Well, that seems just about right.
967845150578720768 2018-02-25 19:34:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @Fr_Flynn @BpOlsonFW Thank you, Bishop Olson for speaking out courageously! Many people are being led astray by statements like the ones in those ads and by Catholic politicians who support abortion.
967436504766275584 2018-02-24 16:30:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellHawks @eyebeat I'm calling him Bob, for Bob the Builder.
967435453296185345 2018-02-24 16:26:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @ArchPhilly @PetriOP AB Chaput is a courageous bishop doing what a bishop should do, which is teach the truth and defend the faith, lead his people down the right path and help them understand things that are difficult but necessary for salvation. Bravo, AB Chaput.  Wish we had more like you.
966353192882720768 2018-02-21 16:45:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @Ritlabs I am a registered user on your Forums, but there is no way to reply or start a new topic today.  It was working yesterday. I need to reply to someone who answered one of my questions.
966346605220827137 2018-02-21 16:19:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellHawks Bob the Builder is a hard worker.
966346444759293952 2018-02-21 16:18:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellHawks I'm telling you, his name should be Bob, as in Bob the Builder!
965990908993957891 2018-02-20 16:45:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellHawks That boy is a keeper!
965990209270755329 2018-02-20 16:43:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellHawks Very nice! That boy certainly is making an attractive home for his lady!
965612159735681024 2018-02-19 15:40:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP Washington's birthday used to be on Feb. 22.  My mother always told me that was the day to prune back your rose bushes.  I'm really tired of terms that water down any tradition or belief system. We end up with mediocrity.
965325452989599749 2018-02-18 20:41:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellHawks @moondancernite2 OH, OK. Thank you.
965305830479421442 2018-02-18 19:23:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellHawks @moondancernite2 I thought there was a contest to name him. Has the name Winken been chosen?
965305336918888450 2018-02-18 19:21:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP @dlongenecker1 Excellent article!
965287499823222784 2018-02-18 18:10:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellHawks I'm voting for "Bob" as his new name.
965278016459935744 2018-02-18 17:33:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellHawks Thanks, Berry.  Great captures of this gorgeous young male.
965277723789754368 2018-02-18 17:31:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellHawks Great pictures!  Thanks!
965277405828075520 2018-02-18 17:30:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @Falconsteel @wetlandcenter Great news!  I can't wait to see a pip and for the hatch!!
964642258866884610 2018-02-16 23:26:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP People are being led astray, errors are being taught, confusion is rampant. What can be done, Father?
963929303682551808 2018-02-14 00:13:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellHawks @Gmomof10 How can you tell how old he is!
963509154903216128 2018-02-13 20:24:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @Gmomof10 Thank you.  I have not watched this nest before.
962805508368490496 2018-02-11 21:48:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellHawks When should egg laying take place?
962750152724369409 2018-02-11 18:08:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Exactly!
962700304516026368 2018-02-11 14:50:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @larryelder Justin Trudeau and people like him need to get over themselves and deal with reality.  There are men and women on this planet and we each have our strengths and weaknesses.  We don't need to be exactly alike to be acknowledged as worthwhile.
962347721968537601 2018-02-10 15:29:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @dclubb25 Great point! Timed events and distance events are just that - the fastest time and the longest distance.  No style points.
961778726907318272 2018-02-08 01:48:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @SheriffClarke @RichardsonTX_PD Our sympathies are with the officer's family and the department. We lived in Richardson for 23 years and my husband was a reserve officer with the Richardson PD.
961685531603144704 2018-02-08 19:37:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP @JamesMartinSJ How about this: God's ways are not our ways. Perhaps Jesus was trying to give his listeners and the women an opportunity to open themselves up to trusting in God and not thinking they know better than God.
959124029646016513 2018-02-01 17:59:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly I agree with you, Holly, but  my two Siamese cats probably have a difference of opinion on that.  And, since I have to live in the same house with them, I'm going to go with "Siamese First". But you certainly are a cutie pie.  Don't tell them I said that!
958766787893526529 2018-01-31 18:19:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @TGowdySC Oh my. I truly admire you, Mr. Gowdy, and was hoping that you could continue to be the stalwart of honesty and decency in Congress.  I understand you position and wish you all the best. I will miss your honest take on everything.
958385908981616642 2018-01-30 17:06:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @gregorysalcido Your profile says you are a proud husband and father. Many, including myself, are proud of our veteran husbands, fathers, and sons. Perhaps you should rethink your profession because teaching hate and disdain for others is not something we need in our schools.
958373588939272193 2018-01-30 16:17:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @frstevemattson @dlongenecker1 This is just the latest example of so called Catholic politicians who repeatedly cause scandal and lead others to sin by their public actions in supporting abortion and other behaviors against the Catholic faith. Isn't it time there were some public excommunications?
958372682088828928 2018-01-30 16:13:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @timkaine @PetriOP Bravo, Father. We need more priests like you who are willing to tell people the truth and help the rest of us know there are priests who still stand up for the truth.
957039770550591488 2018-01-26 23:57:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @Pontifex @PetriOP I think that is fabulous. Perhaps the Holy Father could take his own advice.
956988753939222528 2018-01-26 20:34:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I am right there with you, Mr. Woods. This was my last chance for them.
956595562022830080 2018-01-25 18:32:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @NoSpinNews I LOVE it, but I am having problems playing the videos on my tablet. It keeps stopping and starting over, but I can get the audio.
956308299313569793 2018-01-24 23:30:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @RepArrington @POTUS @PressSec Praying for you, Sophie. Stay strong and trust God.
956200006737899522 2018-01-24 16:20:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I think that's a great idea.
955947640633679872 2018-01-23 23:37:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @BrownDarroch Happy Birthday, Alex. You must be a wonderful person because you raised a loving thoughtful son. Prayers coming your way.
955109560976662528 2018-01-21 16:07:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Some of us women stayed home and took care of our cats. We supported the people who marched the day before for a REALLY important cause #MarchForLife2018
953699802486902784 2018-01-17 18:45:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @SeasoldierFL @marie_michigan @ecbanks305 Before I block you, I will just say that what you said is not based in fact but is a typical unverified insult to get people to jump at the bait. Your comments are vile.
953409497615265792 2018-01-16 23:31:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @chinagoth Cats are smart enough to know where the warmest spots are.
953409124766756866 2018-01-16 23:30:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @VRValicento Thank you for that wonderful update. After last year's loss, this is so much sweeter.
952991856681537538 2018-01-15 19:52:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @Liz_Wheeler @ScottP331 That is just mind boggling!
952982967416164353 2018-01-15 19:16:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @Liz_Wheeler @ScottP331 Thanks! But someone convicted of espionage can't vote, can they?
952978392248397824 2018-01-15 18:58:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @Liz_Wheeler How can she even be a candidate with that conviction? The sentence was commuted but I didn't think there was a pardon.
952968850819223552 2018-01-15 18:20:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @SeasoldierFL @_Project1000 Not quite true:  Congress decided that immigrants should be required to pass a medical exam and have no criminal record. The 1891 Act barred people having any contagious diseases or history of crime. In 1903, the government added anarchists and subversives to the 1891 Act.
952943883721338880 2018-01-15 16:41:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @SeasoldierFL @_Project1000 I think this discussion has gotten off track and I don't want to spend all day debating you on every hypothetical case. Apparently you and I do not agree on illegal immigration. I respect your right to disagree. Please do the same for me.
952943517680140289 2018-01-15 16:40:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @SeasoldierFL @_Project1000 I'm not part of  Fox News or the Alt-right. All I know is what happened with my family and that they came here legally, they did not receive one penny of assistance from the government, they hired tutors to teach their children English, they worked.  The end.
952939041590337537 2018-01-15 16:22:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @SeasoldierFL @_Project1000 The difference is that no one is trying to keep legal immigrants out. We are only talking about illegal immigrants.  What happens after they get here is a completely different discussion. But, they must come legally first.
952936691647614976 2018-01-15 16:13:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @SeasoldierFL @pet_elle @_Project1000 Actually, I didn't say anything about anyone but my own family. The difference is that my family came legally and DACA recipients' families did not.  That is that starting point of this discussion.
952936353351729153 2018-01-15 16:11:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @SeasoldierFL @_Project1000 If you are talking to me, the answer is YES I can certainly tell you all of my ancestors were not part of any mob or crime family.
952714199934922752 2018-01-14 01:29:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @SeasoldierFL My Italian grandparents came legally, assimilated into America, insisted we speak English and we're thankful to be here. They took no government assistance and worked hard to be successful.
952627379540774918 2018-01-14 19:44:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Sorry, Mr. Woods, she should not be turned into a victim. The only victim in that whole story was Nancy Kerrigan. Old Tanya now admits she knew about the attack.
952316051647356928 2018-01-13 23:06:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @Liz_Wheeler Or how about just give the money to Michele Williams.
952260429069324289 2018-01-13 19:25:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @alclubb @MCITLFrAphorism @mhzamoyska I am happy for you.
952260252615036929 2018-01-13 19:25:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism I tried asking for an additional time for Confession during the week but they said "no" because they would get too many people coming from other parishes.
952258556304257024 2018-01-13 19:18:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Not all parishes gave Sunday evening Mass, Father.
952257461620273158 2018-01-13 19:14:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism I can't speak to those people, only for myself. The Sat. vigil Mass is the only way I can attend Mass.
952256512113762304 2018-01-13 19:10:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Well, unlike many Catholics nowadays, they are going to Mass. Ever wonder why the vigil Masses are filled with elderly people? Get back to me when you are in your 70's and have chronic health issues. Be glad we still attend Mass weekly.
952241263880884224 2018-01-13 18:09:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @POTUS @MCITLFrAphorism I usually agree with you, Father, but the horrible conditions in the countries he was talking about are not the same as the people. It has not been proven he said it, but if he did, he was referring to the infrastructure.
951909234148564998 2018-01-12 20:10:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @Church_Militant @Michael_Voris Eternal rest grant to him and may perpetual light upon him.
951903091057709057 2018-01-12 19:45:57 UTC <alclubb1967> I saved so much time ordering groceries online and picking up at Kroger. Thanks #ClickList! http://www.kroger.com/ClickList
951839631544389632 2018-01-12 15:33:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods What do those stone letters on the face of that building spell out? Maybe the call to prayer for the Muslims?
951835880955707393 2018-01-12 15:18:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods It looks like a giant air freshener container.
951602382852501504 2018-01-11 23:51:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Oh my goodness! That is fabulous. Look at the detail and the look of the leather jacket.
951187435656024067 2018-01-10 20:22:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Ahhh, I knew there had to be a catch. What a bunch of slime balls.
950370688547938304 2018-01-08 14:16:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @JamesMartinSJ Is this a joke? If so, it's in poor taste. If not, it should be. @PetriOP
950369875876352002 2018-01-08 14:13:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP I like a person who plans ahead! You have earned the Most Forward Thinking Award!
950009249760980992 2018-01-07 14:20:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @patsajak Everyone should have your attitude regarding weather. The one thing we can be sure of is that the weather will change. It's been going through cycles for millions of years. No need to panic.
949355529150791680 2018-01-05 19:02:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @0canom Thank you for a thoughtful and right on target thread. Being "holier than thou" is what Jesus condemned the Pharisees for.
949312918360854528 2018-01-05 16:13:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @gloria_purvis @EWTN @alyssamurphy @PetriOP Hope you get well soon, Father. My husband and I both have been sick since Christmas.
949014097126936576 2018-01-04 20:26:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @JamesMartinSJ @PetriOP @oldbookworm60 I was told to stop questioning the nun and be grateful that she was teaching the class. My response: " Not when she's teaching heresy!"
949005440049930241 2018-01-04 19:51:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @JamesMartinSJ @PetriOP Unfortunately, the idea that Jesus didn't know who He was until after the Resurrection is alive and still being taught. I first heard that in 1979 by a Domincan nun and recently from a visiting priest at Mass.
948648775614128128 2018-01-03 20:14:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @bretjturner Actually, the child who said "death" gave a supremely accurate and sublime answer. I would love to have a conversation with that child. It would be much more enlghtening than most adult conversations.
948594090492465153 2018-01-03 16:37:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP She will be able included in my prayers for the faithful departed.
948377991402414080 2018-01-02 02:18:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @LifeSite @dianemontagna I hope the USCCB will show such courage.
947988022540238849 2018-01-01 00:28:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP Great article. Thank you for the link.
947951423484039169 2018-01-01 22:03:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly Why does Holly always have her leash attached to her collar? Does she like wearing around the house?
947580760525103107 2017-12-31 21:30:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP Are there different branches of the Dominican order? My experience with the Sinsinawa Domincan sisters seemed like they were not on the same orthodoxy page as you, Father. I was confused by their Biblical class.
947507464794189824 2017-12-31 16:39:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism That is such a great idea to send it as the background! Perfect.
946934537443004421 2017-12-29 02:42:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism They look so happy. Congratulations and best wishes for all the years ahead filled with love and joy.
946893734549098496 2017-12-29 00:00:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Fr. Rutler is wonderful and always right on target.
946891525816012800 2017-12-29 23:51:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @redheadsrule68 @ki_me_a_minute That's the one I really don't understand since the origins of Macaroni and Cheese are Italian and/or Old English. Those are not black cultures so who appropriated whose culture.
946473985310707712 2017-12-28 20:12:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @ClayTravis @verypiratey As an Italian, I can assure you I am white. No need to culturally appropriate anything. And I also enjoy eating Mexican food, Chinese food and Japanese food. I call it culture appreciation.
946458181588353024 2017-12-28 19:09:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @ClayTravis I am still trying to figure out how white people ruined macaroni and cheese since it's origins are Italian and/or Old English.
945805336572825600 2017-12-26 23:55:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @SWFLEagleCAM @TeegSoAs Oh that will be great that there will be so little difference in the chicks hatch dates.
945801050677760000 2017-12-26 23:38:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @SWFLEagleCAM Looks like there might be a pip in egg 2 also, or is that a piece of grass.
945715955224719360 2017-12-26 18:00:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Shouldn't your statement end with a question mark, Mr. Woods?
945390718738161670 2017-12-25 20:28:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Pippo is an extraordinarily laid back cat. My two would have fought the red bow around the neck, eaten all the bows off of the packages before climbing the tree. Good kitty, Pippo.
944958824808624130 2017-12-24 15:51:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @kenjilopezalt THANK YOU!! There are actually other brands if electric pressure cookers. Some of us use those other brands every day to make fabulous meals.
944955654342676482 2017-12-24 15:39:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @ChurchInPoland Blessed Christmas to you too. The Church in Poland is a beacon of light shining out to all the Faithful in the world. Your courage is beautiful. Stay strong. Your are an example to all of us to do the same.

944606184677498881 2017-12-23 16:30:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @cnalive @MCITLFrAphorism I think those were some excellent points made. I will go face to face but I prefer the screen/grill. It also helps to envision Christ Himself sitting behind the screen.
944235600550514689 2017-12-22 15:58:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @POTUS @SecretaryPerry LOVE the hat!!
943906731926720512 2017-12-21 18:11:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @canonlawyered @canonlaw @jdflynn @PiusOP @KofC @PortlandDiocese @PetriOP That's exactly what I getting ready to say. Poor catechisis has done major harm to the Catholic Church. Bishops need to stop worrying about global warming and do their jobs as teachers/defenders of the Faith.
943857890435182593 2017-12-21 14:57:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism That Pippo is a cat who knows what he likes.  I admire that!
943249216394203136 2017-12-19 22:38:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Thank you for the update. I feel confident that #871 was old enough to fledge and get out of harm's way.
942819360703483904 2017-12-18 18:10:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Now that is genius!
942099406991609857 2017-12-16 18:29:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Eggplant
942099060160376832 2017-12-16 18:28:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly LOL, Bill, Holly is going to get back at you one day.  Look at her face.  She's thinking, "Take this stupid hat off of me!"
941783350871822336 2017-12-15 21:33:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @DiamondandSilk You go, Girl! Show them how a Southern woman makes a pie! Wish I was there to eat a piece. They look absolutely delicious.@PressSec
941754697802764293 2017-12-15 19:39:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @maga1dayatatime She didn't. Her company did. She was not a party to the lawsuit and says she would have not settled.
941731239781912576 2017-12-15 18:06:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle It's amazing to me how we went from "guilty" as the measuring bar to "alleged". That takes our entire justice system and puts it in the same category as the Salem Witch Trials.
941698154898120704 2017-12-15 15:55:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP That is so cool.  That would be a great gift for some young boy.
941464892514689024 2017-12-14 00:28:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP Thank you, Father, for remembering that. Does this come under the category of the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing??
941097978487558146 2017-12-13 00:10:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Great tweet, Father. I have a chronic condition and I believe it is an opportunity God has sent me to practice virtue and grow in holiness. He chose the perfect cross for me.
941027920084127745 2017-12-13 19:31:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @Enterprise @AllenWest Bravo, Col. West. I wish we could clone you and send you all across this country to straighten people out.
940765458743087104 2017-12-12 02:08:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @Education4Libs I agree and I am a 72 year old woman. Militant feminists ruined normal men/women interaction by classifying everything as harassment.
940662968093761536 2017-12-12 19:21:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @NRO @PetriOP I look forward to seeing a more extensive article from you on this subject. I know whatever you write will be orthodox.
940577850008199168 2017-12-12 13:43:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealMAGASteve Having someone ask for your phone number is not sexual assault. If she couldn't say "no" to that, she has much larger problems. It used to be a compliment for a guy to notice you, but now it's considered harassment. Very sad.
940261891779321856 2017-12-11 16:47:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @sassygayrepub Congratulations! Hang in there. Everyone walks their journey one step at a time.
939607909826269184 2017-12-09 21:29:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @nefleaglecam It looks like it has gold glitter on it's head!
939604550515855360 2017-12-09 21:15:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP I think I'd rather be in the line with you, Father, holding my catechism and Code of Canon law than in the line with Fr. Martin and his like.
939215432229314561 2017-12-08 19:29:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @Catholicgrlprob Just got back from 12:15pm Mass at my parish.
939140988446167040 2017-12-08 14:33:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @James106b Thank you, but I have never thought God did anything. I just always thought the wording was unnecessarily confusing and could be worded better.
938935365964005379 2017-12-07 00:56:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Actually, I think it makes sense. I have always been confused by "lead us not into temptation".
938816178306387968 2017-12-07 17:03:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @blondegirlnj Oh, yes, we need another St. Ambrose! Another St. Augustine or St. Athanasius would be fine too!
938513568689000448 2017-12-06 21:00:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @KostiukLeah @PolitiBunny I know plenty of teen agers and under 30 year olds who can't survive on their own.
938073495707226112 2017-12-05 15:52:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @ddhitchens @PetriOP Confusion is not something that should be encouraged by any pope. Chaos and confusion are tools of the devil. We need clear, unambiguous teaching on all matters that support all past teachings.
937060727529115653 2017-12-02 20:47:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @JamesMartinSJ Please show me where this tax bill takes money from the poor to give to the rich. I would say you should stick to theology but your track record is not good on that either.
936683403944046592 2017-12-01 19:48:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @USCCB @PetriOP Exactly right! It always irritates me when they move Ascension THURSDAY to Sunday.
936274771649748992 2017-11-30 16:44:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @JamesMartinSJ @MCITLFrAphorism I'd like to see some of the easily found videos of Christians beheading people. Or perhaps videos of Christians destroying century old religious statues, icons and churches. Or perhaps Christians blowing up airplanes.
935669849438728192 2017-11-28 00:40:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @BellagioPoker @RealJamesWoods Glad no one was hurt but I thought those places had tougher security than Fort Knox!
935152602165272578 2017-11-27 14:25:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP Thank you, Father.  At least maybe someone who shops at our parish thrift store will get a good bargain.
934961485117296640 2017-11-26 01:46:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP I feel guilty that Amazon gave me a refund on an item I wanted to return and told me  that I could keep the item instead of returning it. I think I will give it to our parish thrift store.
934958209923678208 2017-11-26 01:33:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @charliekirk11 YES, YES YES!
934864481821306880 2017-11-26 19:20:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @AskTarget Thank you you quick response to this issue.

934472037682372608 2017-11-25 17:21:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @Target How offensive to Christians for you to have a Nativity set as part of your Fable collection. Try that with Muslims and Mohammed.
934471030801862658 2017-11-25 17:17:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @RealJamesWoods @PetriOP @ahebrewcatholic @BillOReilly @CatholicLeague Please tell me how Target is not offending Christians by having a Nativity set in their "Fable" collection:https://www.target.com/p/fable-holiday-decor-collection/-/A-52891678?lnk=Fable
934460387394838528 2017-11-25 16:34:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @PressSec The pie looks great.  The only thing wrong is that so many people don't know how to pronounce the word "pecan". As you know, Sarah, it is pronounced "puh-cahn".  High five to you from another Southern gal.
933470617843720192 2017-11-22 23:01:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @w_terrence Sounds delicious! I love cornbread dressing!!!!
933343860851388416 2017-11-22 14:38:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @Yahoo Can someone please fix the problem in Yahoo Groups? No messages have been coming through in any of my six groups for over three days.
933343628658954240 2017-11-22 14:37:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @YahooGroups Can someone please fix the problem on Yahoo Groups?  No messages have been coming through in any of my groups for over three days.
933044523596435456 2017-11-21 18:48:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Well there's no evidence at all that Trump as involved in collusion with the Russians but that didn't stop them from appointing a special prosecutor to conduct a witch hunt.
932650873817387008 2017-11-20 16:44:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism If people like Martin would try as hard to accept and teach the actual message of the parables instead of searching for loop holes  around them, we might have a holier and more knowledgeable Catholic laity.
932390816802320385 2017-11-19 23:31:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @EmmettOFarrell We worship only God, see the first of the 10 Commandments. We do not worship humans, be they rich or poor. Proverbs says to be kind to them, not to worship them.
932358585635438593 2017-11-19 21:23:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump You could have let it go and showed you were the bigger person but you made yourself look as small as him, and I am one of your supporters. Sometimes it's better to just be quiet.
932293611013726208 2017-11-19 17:04:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellHawks The picture on my end is looking kind of rose color tinted and splashed with strange pink colors.  Is anyone else having this issue?
932282133024051200 2017-11-19 16:19:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @WordsWFriends My husband and I are having a problem with rematching & creating a game. We are getting an error message:oops something went wrong, please try again.
931970466876665864 2017-11-18 19:40:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP What a wonderfully special trip! Many blessings.
931636674030919680 2017-11-17 21:34:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism That's my buddy, St. Alphonsus. He has an entire little book on this subject.
931606581514571777 2017-11-17 19:34:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @w_terrence I finally realize I have outlived the capacity for the majority of human beings to make sense. It must mean that, for some, after a certain time period, their brain cells just die and are replaced with liberal trash. PB & J is the staff of life.
931565521149014018 2017-11-17 16:51:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @RorateCaeli Why do you think it's a fraud?
931208006783684609 2017-11-16 17:11:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism He's a good boy. More people should appreciate cats like you do, Father. They really are very special and intuitive creatures.
930948815640780800 2017-11-15 00:01:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @puppiesworlds I'd say the cat showed amazing restraint!

930839776755945472 2017-11-15 16:47:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP @CatholicNewsSvc Wow, nice to hear. I hope it filters down to our local parish!
930111563415121921 2017-11-13 16:34:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @StFrancisTX I thought the last one was good, but this one is even better! Thank you, Father Flynn. I always check for Pastor's Points first before anything else in the bulletin.
930110826798895104 2017-11-13 16:31:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @Twitter @RealJamesWoods Thank you being on Twitter and sharing your opinions.
929800608491720704 2017-11-12 19:58:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillKristol You didn't make sense at 140 characters. We really didn't need it doubled.
929753778248671232 2017-11-12 16:52:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @obianuju "Reason to Hope" seems like a strange title for a convention of atheists.  What exactly can they hope in since they do not believe in God or an eternal reward. Seems like their hope dies with each and every one of them. Not very inspiring.
929734658773970945 2017-11-12 15:36:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Yes, I pray to St. Michael also. St. Joseph is my special patron, but I pray to the BVM, angels and my A-Team saints: Sts. Ann, Alphonsus, Anthony, Augustine, Ambrose, Athanasius.
929515222385201154 2017-11-11 01:04:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Thank you, Father. I got more from your tweet than I did from our pastor's twenty minute homily tonight.
929411702973714432 2017-11-11 18:13:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors That is amazng to see side by side.
929368590008111104 2017-11-11 15:21:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic I pray to St. Athanasius every day!  He knew how to stand firm against heresy.
929368062930890752 2017-11-11 15:19:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @w_terrence Butter!
929028567878524929 2017-11-10 16:50:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @patsajak I feel the same way, Pat.
928670697043517440 2017-11-09 17:08:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @roccopalmo Perfect analysis! Thank you, AB Chaput!
928424490408857600 2017-11-08 00:50:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP I like the old one better, Father. I like you in your Dominican habit. I hope I didn't hurt your feelings.
928313561172062208 2017-11-08 17:29:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain You hit the nail on the head, Mr. Cain. I just told some friends that when we remove God from every part of our lives and society, evil moves in and takes His place.
928283607289999361 2017-11-08 15:30:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump @BillOReilly @Robert32305 The voters will have to do it for them. When there is an incumbent that has been in office for too long and is no longer doing his job, vote him out, i.e. McCain.
928272083238363136 2017-11-08 14:44:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @PetriOP @frstevemattson  With Twitter going from 140 characters to 280 characters, we have now gone from the St. Augustine school of communication to the St. Thomas Aquinas school of communication.
928271545935437824 2017-11-08 14:42:37 UTC <alclubb1967> OK, I now have 280 characters and, frankly, I don't know what to do with them. The beauty of Twitter was the ability to make your point in a succinct fashion. Now, it's just rambling, as this tweet proves.
928270077706756096 2017-11-08 14:36:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @JamesMartinSJ @MCITLFrAphorism There's a difference in dissenting from Church teaching and correcting someone who is dissenting from Church teaching.  One is in danger of heresy and the other is doing a fraternal correction. Gee, even I can see that and I am not a theologian.
928269405326229509 2017-11-08 14:34:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump @BillOReilly Can we just get rid of them all and start over, with term limits???
928257440117874688 2017-11-08 13:46:34 UTC <alclubb1967> Ps. 57: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy, for in thee my soul takes refuge and in the shadow of thy wings I seek refuge til the disaster be past. I cry to God most high, to God  my benefactor; may He send help from heaven to save me.
928256010002796544 2017-11-08 13:40:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @raylblake Sort of like what the Apostles told the Sanhedrin - We must obey God rather than men.
928070006700691456 2017-11-07 01:21:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @Nigel_Farage Couldn't have said it better myself! Can't they just fade away like old soldiers?
928068220682162181 2017-11-07 01:14:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Funny, now that I have 280 characters, I can't think of a thing to say!
928028345379454976 2017-11-07 22:36:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @MartinHeinrich @JeffFlake Wow, as a senator you should check the existing laws before tweeting. Save yourself some embarrassment.
927617469493207040 2017-11-06 19:23:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @w_terrence Me too!
927616043899609088 2017-11-06 19:17:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @blondegirlnj Beautiful prayer!
927608480822898688 2017-11-06 18:47:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @raylblake Many saints in the past have experienced the same thing, but it is hard to stay positive.
927525214807887873 2017-11-06 13:16:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism He didn't say Ratzinger was the only candidate. He said he was the only "real" candidate with the wisdom, etc. to be pope at that time.
927213020304027648 2017-11-05 16:36:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Read my lips, I don't care about anything he has to say. And that also includes his sons, W and Jeb.
927202261914341376 2017-11-05 15:53:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Thank you.  I thought the chick was standing awfully still, LOL!
926891318923669510 2017-11-04 19:18:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP I hope you don't have any problems tomorrow.
926858431964893184 2017-11-04 17:07:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly @CraigSh8 Yes. My husband served honorably for eight years, including a tour in Vietnam. This made him feel like his service didn't matter.
926833323195985920 2017-11-04 15:27:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I agree 100%. This time change nonsense is crazy and should have eliminated years ago!
926830052385292290 2017-11-04 15:14:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @raylblake I think I'll go with the latter.
926580794008768512 2017-11-03 22:44:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Pippo looks like a very wise cat! He has that Zen look going!
926504331888783361 2017-11-03 17:40:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly This is a mockery of every person who has serve honorably!
926501054753189888 2017-11-03 17:27:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump I agree. My husband served honorably for 8 years including Vietnam. This is a disgrace and a slap in the face to all veterans.
926500725374570496 2017-11-03 17:26:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly This is a travesty and a slap in the face of all current/past veterans. My husband erved honorably for 8 yrs, including Vietnam. This stinks
926176814984253442 2017-11-02 19:58:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @V_of_Europe And, apparently, one of the smartest!
926176010055405568 2017-11-02 19:55:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic A house divided.....
926172527168192512 2017-11-02 19:41:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP I personally prefer the terms "sheep" and "goats".
925812718531235840 2017-11-01 19:52:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Speaking for me and my friends and family, yes, we are losing confidence in Pope Francis.
925748252288438274 2017-11-01 15:35:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @Pontifex @PetriOP It is a courageous and truthful letter. I can feel the pain that it caused him to have to write it, but it needed to be said.
925728898222084096 2017-11-01 14:19:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism All I can say is that this is not only insane but it's got the stamp of Satan all over it. No pun intended!

924808682176643072 2017-10-29 01:22:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP Thank you so much for the clarification!
924753620758867968 2017-10-29 21:43:38 UTC <alclubb1967> Great article on what feminism has devolved into these days:http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/29/message-to-liberal-feminists-dont-dictate-political-views-to-me-just-because-share-same-body-parts.html
924697795893825537 2017-10-29 18:01:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle This church is on the National Historical Registry, but it's erasing the very history that got it on the registry. Very, very sad.
924687053803188224 2017-10-29 17:19:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @syghe Maybe not all but I'm thinking of the social culture, ie abortion, SSM, racism, fascism, white supremacists, etc.
924654165732798464 2017-10-29 15:08:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP We had the RCIA candidates welcoming liturgy during Mass, but the Confiteor, Kyrie, Gloria, Creed were omitted. Valid Mass?
924603964053688321 2017-10-29 11:48:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @PatriciaKAdams By the way, that church is on the National Historical Registry because it is a place of history. So, they are erasing history.
924600456227250177 2017-10-29 11:35:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @PatriciaKAdams The fact that Washington worshiped at that particular church for 20 years is part of history. You didn't learn that in your history class.
924351714576216065 2017-10-28 19:06:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism The Church is sacrificing her beliefs for the almighty dollar. They were so determined to win a lawsuit they denied their own teachings.
924324269915504642 2017-10-28 17:17:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism My husband became Catholic after watching me go to Mass every Sunday. He was Baptized a few months after our first child's Baptism.
924318006406270981 2017-10-28 16:52:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Exactly the one I use, and it's available on Kindle. Also, the Haydock commentary is available on Kindle.

924302082051657728 2017-10-28 15:49:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods The left has won every argument and now they are winning this one. They want to completely erase our history and our Constitution.
923925874436726784 2017-10-27 14:54:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP It's priests like you, Father, that give  me a boost knowing there are other faithful humans besides me fighting this battle. God is with us
923924703840034816 2017-10-27 14:49:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @benshapiro Exactly! If they told the truth, they would be out of business.
923924050300284928 2017-10-27 14:47:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @CecileRichards Natural Family Planning s not the rhythm method. It is as effective as birth control pills. You are in the abortion business so you distort.

923232217660379137 2017-10-25 16:58:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @JenniferKabbany Say what? My granddaughter's third grade teacher said they don't teach multiplication any more because the kids just kind of pick it up.
923190869628514306 2017-10-25 14:13:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods In her case, she is a few cards shy of a full deck.

921761986014261248 2017-10-21 15:35:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @CBS11JeffJam I meant the daily forecast
921761273393631234 2017-10-21 15:33:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @CBS11JeffJam Why is the CBS weather app daily reading showing 20% chance of rain on Sat and 0% on Sunday?
921757958647832576 2017-10-21 15:19:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Married priests' focus is divided between their parish/their family. The priesthood, marriage, single are separate vocations for a reason.
921735464775815169 2017-10-21 13:50:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Beautiful comment that explains free will so perfectly. Thank you.
921708825782161408 2017-10-21 12:04:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @VescovoDDK Thank you, Bishop. St. Joseph is my special saint. I pray to have the grace to be like him-humble, obedient, trusting.
921100868304494592 2017-10-19 19:48:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump @pdoocy Great question! Glad you asked it because we all know that's what he's doing.
921018733103067136 2017-10-19 14:22:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @w_terrence Probably the same reason I always had to stay after school and write "I will not talk in class" five hundred times.
920726199839739905 2017-10-18 19:00:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @SebGorka @DonaldJTrumpJr They should remember how well appeasement worked out for Chamberlain and Britain.
920679369412145158 2017-10-18 15:54:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @TheWandererNews This is what bishops are supposed to do, stand courageously in defense of the Faith against all worldly attacks. Thank you!!
920659926778830848 2017-10-18 14:36:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @DailyCaller @KerryPicket That's because he is a turncoat RINO and has never been anything but a self-serving jerk.
920659534632357888 2017-10-18 14:35:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Why does anyone care what Jane Fonda thinks? She has been anti-American since the Vietnam War.
920059319189585920 2017-10-16 22:50:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @AnnezekeAnne That her Mona Lisa face!
920032975420407808 2017-10-16 21:05:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @blondegirlnj @KathActNed Can we please have him come to my diocese and say that???
920032141072777216 2017-10-16 21:02:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @ccpecknold @PetriOP Good, at least I am on the right side of this issue. By the way, I'm a cat lover but it's the same. I am trying very hard to get to heaven.
920030740305215488 2017-10-16 20:56:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @ccpecknold @PetriOP I've never understood the obsession with whether dogs are in heaven. Anyone who is in heaven is perfectly happy, with or without their dog.
920025288985124864 2017-10-16 20:34:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Studying Ezechiel right now. Maybe many of the bishops should read it.
920024758007185409 2017-10-16 20:32:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism It's because most people fell away a long time ago, so they don't notice. The rest of us pray for the soul of the world daily.
919971941905076225 2017-10-16 17:02:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @WTOP @MCITLFrAphorism Did he choose to have a trial by just a judge rather than a jury hoping to get a lighter sentence? Isn't a court martial tried by a panel?
919944049628291072 2017-10-16 15:12:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Unfortunately, he's not the only priest who does this. He just has a very big pulpit to lead so many souls to perdition down the wide road.
919639188345036800 2017-10-15 19:00:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @davidwebbshow @FoxNews What, if it becomes a witch Hunt you might be called out for the pervert you are?
919316894091329536 2017-10-14 21:40:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Exactly. We had a priest say Jesus did the opposite of the parables & He wouldn't have turned away a homeless person because of his clothes.
919282090067222529 2017-10-14 19:21:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @BrentBozell Who cares which party he's with? If that information affects how anyone else votes, they are weak minded and shouldn't be allowed to vote.
919254867264249856 2017-10-14 17:33:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @akcdoglovers @RealJamesWoods Ethical breeders do not sell through pet stores. They sell directly to the buyer so they can screen them before they place an animal.
919252695852052480 2017-10-14 17:24:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Find an ethical breeder who breeds for health and get another one.
918925060714348544 2017-10-13 19:43:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @JamesMartinSJ @MCITLFrAphorism What a beautiful witness to the Catholic Faith. God bless her. We must carry the cross God gives us & not trade it in for a lighter one.
918911275890966528 2017-10-13 18:48:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @BarbarasBakery  I am  very upset that you have ruined my favorite cereal, Multigrain Spoonfuls. They are hard, not puffed, and shaped wrong

918886030106693633 2017-10-13 17:07:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump @BillOReilly She's insane and is being given air time by equally insane liberal media. People like her undermine our democracy and the 1st Amendment.
918885799403307008 2017-10-13 17:07:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump @BillOReilly It should go to any conservative speaker that braves Antifa and is successful in speaking in any public forum.
918563019944325121 2017-10-12 19:44:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @Renorabbit Thank you.

918526925513125888 2017-10-12 17:20:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellHawks @Renorabbit Nice to see a new possible mate in the nest. What will he be called?
918124397290016768 2017-10-11 14:41:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Well, Goodell only said he thought they SHOULD stand, not that they MUST stand. That's really not much different than it is now.
917850906116415489 2017-10-10 20:34:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @obianuju How about she is married to a serial sexual predator and destroyed all the women he abused, raped and preyed upon.
917850488531496961 2017-10-10 20:33:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @NFL @realDonaldTrump @ericbolling It doesn't do anything. He just said he believe everyone SHOULD stand, not that they must stand. Worthless.
917820361064009730 2017-10-10 18:33:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle But, her husband could do the same thing and she blamed the women for it.
917521993200816128 2017-10-09 22:47:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @w_terrence You have a great nephew and I wish hm all the best. We need more young men like him.

916720522209251328 2017-10-07 17:42:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors It's almost sad to see a gorgeous perfectly created flying artist yearning to be where she belongs. Soon she will soar like she is meant to.
916691635349671941 2017-10-07 15:48:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @JimSichko I am working on living with what IS instead of living with what IF and remembering God is in charge.
916669209597435904 2017-10-07 14:19:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @JimSichko Right in the nick of time!   I  wish He would come down and spread a little wrath around to get our attention. (Reading Ezechiel right now.)
916429981907062784 2017-10-06 22:28:28 UTC <alclubb1967> But it's OK to disrespect millions of NFL fans, police officers, veterans, the flag, the anthem, and the country? http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2017/10/06/panthers-coach-cam-newtons-apology-needed-to-be-said.html
916354145036140544 2017-10-06 17:27:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @JimSichko That's great, Father. All I ever got were ants so I switched to feeding peanuts to the Blue Jays!
916299581041856513 2017-10-06 13:50:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @TPCarney We live in a society that allows delusions in the name of political correctness. Wouldn't it be kinder to help them become mentally healthy?
916297451203637248 2017-10-06 13:41:51 UTC <alclubb1967> Angels of heaven, drive from all that would harm me. Stand by me always and keep me safe. St. Michael, defend us. Guardian Angel, protect me
915731766098440192 2017-10-04 00:14:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic @JimSichko That's why I send greeting cards to every resident at a nursing home. I send them each a card every month. Maybe it will brighten their day.
915721712892858368 2017-10-04 23:34:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @w_terrence But they had lard, which fries up much better!
915713541256175617 2017-10-04 23:01:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @punkproletarian @MCITLFrAphorism I agree completely.
915697633162878977 2017-10-04 21:58:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @SebGorka @RepStevenSmith Where is she getting all the tee shirts???????????
915658799607926784 2017-10-04 19:24:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @chinagoth Of course he does.  My cats assume I am here to serve them.  You know, dogs have masters; cats have staff.
915638796888264704 2017-10-04 18:04:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @yycBirdFinder She's going to get airborne one way or another.
915584216745824257 2017-10-04 14:27:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @yycBirdFinder She keeps looking up like she wants to be up there with all her relatives soaring on the thermals. Pretty soon, Little One.
915282109530542082 2017-10-03 18:27:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle St. Paul asked people to pray for him several times in the Bible.
915279038175961091 2017-10-03 18:15:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @SrBethanyFSP I'm afraid mine is like that too.  I actually apologized to him the other day and thanked him for being so patient with me.
915236394041270272 2017-10-03 15:25:35 UTC <alclubb1967> LET us leave a little room for reflection, room too for silence. Enter into yourself & leave behind all noise and confusion.  St. Augustine
915235450750689281 2017-10-03 15:21:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @larryelder Must be a rhetorical question.
914984820832296960 2017-10-02 22:45:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @w_terrence Agree 100%. A shame such a simple matter has to be explained to people who want us to think they are the smartest people n the world!
914627413526622208 2017-10-01 23:05:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Does all this sound rather familiar? Just think Ray Nagin in New Orleans.
914575979720462337 2017-10-01 19:41:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @JackPosobiec A time will come when he no longer supports the GOP?  I thought that time had already come with Kasich.

914575248506408960 2017-10-01 19:38:25 UTC <alclubb1967> This sounds more like what is really going on in Puerto Rico: http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/01/puerto-rican-ceo-sends-engineers-to-help-fema-efforts-calls-local-pols-inept.html
914207567936720897 2017-09-30 19:17:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods My skin crawls everytime I think of how close we came to having her as president.
914192133833334786 2017-09-30 18:16:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @Carol38553 Yes, I see that now. Being 72 years old sometimes takes its toll on the rapidity of brain cell processing, LOL.
914186899719380992 2017-09-30 17:55:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods What a smug looking duo! Term limits!
914185513191510026 2017-09-30 17:49:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Well, if it would help elect a Conservative, then, by all means, where can I donate to her campaign.
914182718291955713 2017-09-30 17:38:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Sorry, Mr. Woods. I have to respectfully disagree with you. I wouldn't vote for Oprah if she was the only choice.
914153957697769474 2017-09-30 15:44:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @toddstarnes Maybe he needs to tell that to the mayor of San Juan!
913749585524379649 2017-09-29 12:57:32 UTC <alclubb1967> This is liberalism at its most arrogant, condescending and noxious best:http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/29/librarian-rejects-melania-trump-s-dr-seuss-books-calls-them-racist-propaganda.html
913738236442398721 2017-09-29 12:12:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @w_terrence I was born & raised in the south, grandparents came from Italy, never flew a Confederate flag, never hyphenated our name. We are Americans!
913577856180948992 2017-09-28 01:35:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism He has you trained, Father. You know what they say: dogs have masters and cats have staff.
913504747327385601 2017-09-28 20:44:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @larryelder As the granddaughter of legal Italian immigrants, I can tell you that we also were discriminated against, even when I married in 1967.
913452236944048130 2017-09-28 17:15:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @PressSec @CBSNews I guess all those who are criticizing the timing of this don't understand that the governor MUST request it before the Feds can do anything.
913443353898962944 2017-09-28 16:40:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP I agree, but I don't think I have the ability to Tweet more than 140 characters yet. Maybe 200 would be a good compromise?
913412077158588416 2017-09-28 14:36:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @benshapiro @AnnCoulter I used to like your comments. Now you are coming off like an obsessed harpy. You have become a parody of yourself.
913112311916847105 2017-09-27 18:45:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic @realDonaldTrump Congress should have the same healthcare plans as everyone else. Stop the special treatment of member of Congress.
913109764061765645 2017-09-27 18:35:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly Happy Birthday, Holly. Wish y many more.

913070177562046466 2017-09-27 15:57:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @benshapiro @DavidAFrench Employers absolutely have that right and already do it in every office.
913058793247961088 2017-09-27 15:12:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @benshapiro Love your succinct and completely right response.  Who needs 280 characters?
913058287649685504 2017-09-27 15:10:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism I guess he didn't really mean the oath he took to defend the Constitution. He should be stripped of his commission immediately.
912811038181089280 2017-09-26 22:48:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @mrctv @BrentBozell That doesn't say much for her husband's awareness or intelligence.
912775392552980486 2017-09-26 20:26:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @obianuju This has to be one of the dumbest headlines I have ever seen. Yes, Virginia, there is a baby inside a pregnant woman.
912734996548472833 2017-09-26 17:45:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @StFrancisTX Fabulous idea! Thank you!!

912672378139893760 2017-09-26 13:37:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism With all due respect, Father, my refrigerator actually scared visiting relatives with its creepy loud otherworld sounds.
912669285339860993 2017-09-26 13:24:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism I call it pride, thinking they know better than God or His bride, the Church.
912466044102508545 2017-09-25 23:57:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism I agree 100%. I have lived under 7 Pope's from Pius XII to Francis. After Vatican II, errors were taught, but not by the Pope.
912452074931195909 2017-09-25 23:01:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @JesseBWatters @FoxNews We have come a long way from when the 1980 US. Olympics hockey team goalie skated aound the ice draped in an American flag.
912448283217399808 2017-09-25 22:46:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrDavidPalmer Wish I was a Cardinal! I'd vote for him in a heartbeat!
912411071885037568 2017-09-25 20:18:45 UTC <alclubb1967> Gregg Jarrett: Trump is correct, NFL teams can legally fire players for their conduct http://fxn.ws/2whe2Cs #FoxNews
912347849551224832 2017-09-25 16:07:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @greggutfeld Yeah, they were leaders in the slave trade.
911977596098891776 2017-09-24 15:36:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @toddstarnes Better to remain in the locker room than on the field being disrespectful.  However, I don't care because I won't be watching any NFL games.
911977381858021376 2017-09-24 15:35:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Boy, she really is a "don't touch me" kind of gal.
911976849944842240 2017-09-24 15:33:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I suppose they don't know that most slave ships/trading companies were British?
911961077797224448 2017-09-24 14:30:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @benshapiro Any employer can insist that their employees not use company time for their personal protests.
911960674632421376 2017-09-24 14:29:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle Me too.  Everything has become political.  I'm sick of it.
911739448722903041 2017-09-23 23:49:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @w_terrence Well, they are haters, hypocrites, jealous and just stupid. You are fabulous. Keep up the good work.
911665925484630017 2017-09-23 18:57:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @StephenCurry30 @KingJames @IngrahamAngle The existence of an invitation is not dependent upon someone accepting it. It still exists unless recinded, hence Trump's action.
911315834294931456 2017-09-22 19:46:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest I am sick to death of RINOs like McCain, Collins, etc. stabbing us in the back. If anyone is unfit to serve it's McCain, not Trump.
911279896697110528 2017-09-22 17:23:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @yycBirdFinder We need to call her Pogo Girl!
911007187916468224 2017-09-21 23:20:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors That is so good to see. Maybe she had an upset tummy the other day.
911001784591712256 2017-09-21 22:58:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @OreoAbbott @GregAbbott_TX So sorry for your loss.  Beautiful dog.
910946108129579009 2017-09-21 19:17:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @RitaPanahi That is beautiful.
910898211677704192 2017-09-21 16:07:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @MSill3 May the Holy Spirit let His grace flow over you and your family like a comforting mantle.
910491665332183040 2017-09-20 13:11:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @patsajak Think of Rickie Nelson's "Garden Party" song.

910239404282859522 2017-09-19 20:29:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Where is this happening?
910238700243701760 2017-09-19 20:26:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors So happy to see the chick up and investigating her area. That was really scary yesterday.
910173543815680000 2017-09-19 16:07:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @benshapiro LOL! Great tweet!

910127549283540992 2017-09-19 13:04:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors  Is the camera not working this morning?  Does anyone know how the chick is?
909943550036500480 2017-09-18 00:53:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @WGESdragons @dclubb25 @merrittsthirds Such a great idea!
909881222192443393 2017-09-18 20:46:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest You are right on target! McCain needs to go now.
909874096392986625 2017-09-18 20:17:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Thank goodness for the cameras that allow you to monitor the nest.  Otherwise, no one would know there was a problem.
909873238355804161 2017-09-18 20:14:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Oh, I hope the sweet thing is OK.  At least if there is a problem, they can take her for medical help.
909833794848407552 2017-09-18 17:37:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly I never doubted you, Bill.
909832130271707137 2017-09-18 17:30:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Oh no!  Not again this year.  Hoping for the best.
909114136151199744 2017-09-16 17:57:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Why don't just tell the truth and call them Pre-K and 3rd Grade?
909086168863580160 2017-09-16 16:06:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods It takes courage to speak the truth and Mr. Woods has that in spades (more Bridge rather than Poker reference)
909085327838474240 2017-09-16 16:03:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Heresy from the pulpit is worse than some group who calls themselves Catholic. More damage is done when it's from a bishop, priest or nun.
909079962870620161 2017-09-16 15:42:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP @rbbadger2 Is there any other kind of exegesis from James Martin?
909030988809826304 2017-09-16 12:27:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @CatholicHerald @PetriOP @PiusOP @MrPa_Johnson I don't know. These are difficult times, but we must trust the Holy Spirit. God is in charge, not James Martin.
908708770661806080 2017-09-15 15:07:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Even the color scheme of the room is monochromatic! They look like Stepford wives.
908689656216043522 2017-09-15 13:51:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @CatholicHerald @PetriOP @PiusOP How many times does this "Jesus didn't know who He was" garbage have to be corrected. Either you believe it or you're a heretic. Simple.
908458051476353024 2017-09-14 22:30:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Frankly, I find this Pope's attitude a bit rigid regarding anything he disagrees with.
908416644506050561 2017-09-14 19:46:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I can't believe they are still allowed to use the title of "visiting fellow" considering Chelsea/Bradley's gender history.
908340640043470848 2017-09-14 14:44:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @PressSec Great, but the Dems are doing better about getting their version out, as usual! I'm tired of Republicans always playing catch up!
908066410810822656 2017-09-13 20:34:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Yes, and now this:http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/century-old-francis-scott-key-monument-defaced-with-racist-anthem-in-baltimore/article/2634255
908032940843642880 2017-09-13 18:21:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @SheriffClarke And I won the student council election in high school. Both mean nothing in the grand scheme of things.
908032545186557960 2017-09-13 18:20:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @CollegeFix @PoliticalShort This is just sickening. I hope they prosecute the people who did this.
907734203541966849 2017-09-12 22:34:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism That sounds good! Do you slice the raddichio or cut it in chunks?
907680923487019008 2017-09-12 19:02:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @LaraLeaTrump @EricTrump Congratulations!
907651067357351942 2017-09-12 17:04:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @yycBirdFinder Oh that is wonderful! Is that the condor equivalent of branching?
907421963525779456 2017-09-11 01:53:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @andrewulee @HellgateOsprey Oh, nevermind. I just saw here to tweet then to.

906957596330004486 2017-09-10 19:08:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX Not sure what anyone from Arizona has to say to our great Gov. Abbott, but I see he has no trouble setting her straight.@kukalong
906955094482092034 2017-09-10 18:58:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods What a great mom.  They must have a lot of fun at their house. I know the feeling of taking one for the first day of school. Good for her.
906917510833954822 2017-09-10 16:29:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @justanavywife I try to do that and, hopefully, I succeed some of the time. Most of the time I just end up blocking someone who becomes abusive.
906894632646332416 2017-09-10 14:58:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @yycBirdFinder What a cutie pie she is! I love it when they hop like that.

906623007740841984 2017-09-09 20:59:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @ericbolling My sincere sympathies to you and your wife. May God bless you and give you comfort and strength.
906566650044059648 2017-09-09 17:15:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @RorateCaeli This Pope's papacy parallels Obama's presidency by chipping away at all traditions and sowing chaos and division.
906320478528266241 2017-09-08 00:56:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods The second sentence wasn't applied to any conservative speaker at Berkeley in the last year. Or for anyone who supports Trump!
906287089003659264 2017-09-08 22:44:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @SheriffClarke Exactly right!
906215756475588609 2017-09-08 18:00:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @kroger As a senior citizen,  I am very upset that Kroger has discontinued the their senior citizen discount. It was a big help to us.
906167137433116672 2017-09-08 14:47:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors That was a beautiful almost ballarina-like position.
905868107104874498 2017-09-07 18:59:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @IMNOTMAKINGITUP @ahebrewcatholic Me too.
905803671350411265 2017-09-07 14:43:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @SiriusXMPatriot @davidwebbshow My husband is one of those Vietnam vets that was treated horribly when he came home from the war. It still hurts him today, 50 years later.
905605371372478464 2017-09-06 01:35:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Teen agers of all species need lots of food!
905591444831952896 2017-09-06 00:40:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @PPact @MCITLFrAphorism This is so far beyond hypocritical that I cannot even imagine what delusional world she lives in to be able to say those words.
905508038748114944 2017-09-06 19:08:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @JRArchSPM Better to be pious than holier than thou.  #Instablock
905502461703708672 2017-09-06 18:46:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP @emdeardo @JRArchSPM Don't know what you're responding to. I'm not going to get into an argument about which form is better, holier, correct, etc. God bless you
905498626402783232 2017-09-06 18:31:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP @emdeardo @JRArchSPM It is not unjust to say the truth. I attended the EF for 18 yrs + another 3 yrs at FSSP Masses. I know what an EF Mass looks like.
905494803516936193 2017-09-06 18:15:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP @emdeardo @JRArchSPM How is it unjust to say people don't know if an EF priest is changing anything. They are quietly speaking in Latin with their backs to us.
905493261564956673 2017-09-06 18:09:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP @JRArchSPM @emdeardo Exactly what I am saying
905493144912920576 2017-09-06 18:09:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP @emdeardo @JRArchSPM Could you please give an example?
905491194314190848 2017-09-06 18:01:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP @emdeardo @JRArchSPM OK, granted. The original poster said nothing about OF vs EF either. No one knows if an EF priest is changing things but they do in the OF.
905483202017546240 2017-09-06 17:29:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Thank you, Father. I am proud to be a Texan and proud of our governor's response and of all of our people.
905482583932366850 2017-09-06 17:27:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP @emdeardo @JRArchSPM But changing the words is what most of us are talking about when we say "improvise".
905480046063878151 2017-09-06 17:17:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP @emdeardo @JRArchSPM No priest has the right to change the words of the Mass. My altar Missal and the GIRM give adequate instructions and I didn't go to seminary
905475228473614338 2017-09-06 16:58:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP @emdeardo @JRArchSPM No, you do not have to improvise. The people deserve the Liturgy to be celebrated exacted as written w/correct rubrics, OF or not.
905459936955699200 2017-09-06 15:57:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @emdeardo Thank you! The Mass does not belong to the priest to improvise where he likes. The Mass belongs to the Church to be celebrated correctly.
905159130729652224 2017-09-05 20:02:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey  Has Dr. Greene put up any signs warning people to stay away from the nest? Or, is he waiting until the ospreys migrate.
905105494863474695 2017-09-05 16:29:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Things sure look different with all the cars in the parking lot!
904762949834862593 2017-09-04 17:47:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Are any of the wild fires near any of the condors?
904750731672121348 2017-09-04 16:59:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey You da man, Louis!
904728916631355392 2017-09-04 15:32:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @CBS11JeffJam Let's hope that doesn't happen and Irma stays out at in the ocean.
904728405928751108 2017-09-04 15:30:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Satan's triumph is convincing people he doesn't exist.
904510064823820288 2017-09-03 01:02:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @Justamegamom That is the greatest cake I have ever seen!
904446315228266496 2017-09-03 20:49:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism I see it and agree completely.
904418110865858561 2017-09-03 18:57:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @MichaelSkolnik @mrfphd @JimmyMcSavage @KostiukLeah Maybe, but her original question was, at the very least, stupid and, at the very worst, insulting and condescending.
904417778098212865 2017-09-03 18:56:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Don't mess with James's mother. She was a lovely lady and raised a wonderful son.
904417362681716737 2017-09-03 18:54:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Hmmm, but he ignored his own advice.
904361776489398273 2017-09-03 15:13:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @CatholicHerald That's a good start. Now he needs to clear up all the confusion he has allowed via AE.
904361449627283457 2017-09-03 15:12:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Oh, yeah, there is no comparison to Melanie fashion choices. Melanie is classy and, well, let's just leave it at that.
904360838076751872 2017-09-03 15:10:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @CNNPolitics But you are supposed to answer to the people who elected you but you seem to have forgotten that, RINO John
904360494206779393 2017-09-03 15:08:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @RaymondArroyo That a horrible portrait that dishonestly portrays Pope Benedict.
904150256706781185 2017-09-02 01:13:14 UTC <alclubb1967> Does Henry VII + Henry I = Henry VIII? If so, you would have to also add 6 wives.
904073522707910659 2017-09-02 20:08:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @KurtSchlichter @MichaelSkolnik @mrfphd @NoonMark I guess she thought she would be lassoed, hog tied, and branded! Yeehaw! Really, don't mess with Texas or Texans.
904063175083077633 2017-09-02 19:27:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @MichaelSkolnik @mrfphd I have lived in 4 states and visited many. Never once did I assume the residents would do me harm. How about you!
904055589143277568 2017-09-02 18:57:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @MichaelSkolnik @mrfphd You really need to get out more. What do you think we do to women in Texas? Women have doors held open for them and are treated with respect
904038009825320961 2017-09-02 17:47:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Exactly!!! And the local politicians that didn't keep the levees and pumps maintained like they were paid to do.
904036985970491392 2017-09-02 17:43:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Great article. Vultures like everything in nature have a purpose and humans should learn not to mess with nature.
904035935905611777 2017-09-02 17:38:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @reginamrc6 At my all girls Catholic school, we made the responses to the priest since there were no altar boys.
904035629692018690 2017-09-02 17:37:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @mritapatterson Yes, my school too.
904011750227501058 2017-09-02 16:02:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism I knew exactly what was going on and what was said. I had my Latin/English missal like everyone else.
904011227424280576 2017-09-02 16:00:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC How much farther can "hymms" possibly go toward absurdity.
904000390622052356 2017-09-02 15:17:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC How is that different for promiscuity or polygamy? They all pervert God's definition of marriage between one man and one woman.
903999433037283328 2017-09-02 15:13:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly Just followed her!
903976654992703488 2017-09-02 13:43:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @JamesMartinSJ @PetriOP We need more courageoys priests like you, Fr. Petri, to stand up for the truth and correct errors that lead people astray.
903662071765753858 2017-09-01 16:53:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors She is a pretty girl! I guessed correctly. There is just something about her that says she's a lady.
903661685273178113 2017-09-01 16:51:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Woohoo! I guessed correctly!
903346313076592641 2017-08-31 19:58:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @txrrc @ChristiCraddick @txpropane1 All of the stations near me in Flower Mound, north of DFW airport are out of gasoline. Hoping for refueling soon.
903258857279025152 2017-08-31 14:11:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @CatholicHerald My mother said if I couldn't say anything nice, I should say nothing at all. I have to remain silent where this Pope is concerned.
902648648252534784 2017-08-29 21:46:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Come on down to Texas, Mr. Woods. Normally the weather is great and so are the people and the politics!
902646927464026112 2017-08-29 21:39:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @POTUS @RealJamesWoods I am proud to be a Texan!
902556067405717504 2017-08-29 15:38:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @toddstarnes Using their logic, the answer would have to be "yes"
901973187059122176 2017-08-27 01:02:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic I don"t know but if I lived in Houston, which floods for 2" of rain, no one would have had to tell me to evacuate.
901938736795189251 2017-08-27 22:45:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic They could have done a staged evacuation with contaflow lanes on highways, starting with lowest areas. Would be fewer left to rescue.
901865362605658112 2017-08-27 17:53:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic I don't know but our http://Gov.Abbott advised Houston residents to evacuate and the mayor said not to.  Abbott is Rep., mayor is not.
901797765151416321 2017-08-27 13:25:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors I have always thought this chick was a female. She (?) seems more thoughtful and methodical than last year's chick from Kofords Ridge.
901187906626351107 2017-08-25 21:01:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I agree, but it's also wrong for the people on the left to categorize everyone not a progressive as being like Spencer and his kind.
901162261502472194 2017-08-25 19:20:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @RegnumChristiEn @FrMatthewLC Wouldn't it be great if even a small number of parishes would use this music during Mass instead of the secular sounding stuff we get.
901089525493100549 2017-08-25 14:30:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @StFrancisTX Thank you. This is invaluable to those of us who are home bound.
900802095867203584 2017-08-24 19:28:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey She is really bulking up getting ready for her migration.
900741340669124608 2017-08-24 15:27:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @TheWandererNews @MCITLFrAphorism Great picture, Father. And, right under an article about Card. Burke!
900430413436420096 2017-08-23 18:51:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @gcgrytdal @CollinRugg Jesse Jackson too!
900410855636049920 2017-08-23 17:34:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @michaeleaves @RevJJackson @larryelder Shouldn't Jesse change his name since it's the same as Stonewall Jackson? Doesn't that make him racist?
900367999286333440 2017-08-23 14:43:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest It's about time police actually did what they are hired to do, enforce laws and protect the public. Bravo to the Phoenix PD!
899710750872260610 2017-08-21 19:12:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @Fox4Weather @BillNye @ScottPadgettCBS @CBS11JeffJam @texhonkey I saw those shapes at my house too!
899650182110785536 2017-08-21 15:11:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @brpetertotleben Misinterpretation of the hypostatic union. Some are still peddling the wrong notion that Jesus didn't know who He was until the Resurrection
898612647330955265 2017-08-18 18:28:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @bfraser747 They are doing that now!
898531290168795137 2017-08-18 13:05:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly I'm with her!
898226176329748480 2017-08-17 16:53:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods When is the left going to demand streets, cities, and states change their names from anything offensive to them?
897893367333441539 2017-08-16 18:50:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @cvpayne Amen to that!
897892712925372417 2017-08-16 18:47:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods We are one tiny step away from book burning and "witch" trials.
897587672105058304 2017-08-15 22:35:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @toddstarnes Exactly right.
897537092145881088 2017-08-15 19:14:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @PatriciaHeaton Thank you speaking out. God bless you!
897179897420029952 2017-08-14 19:35:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Ok, I know that move. It's Tai Chi.
897179526303817728 2017-08-14 19:34:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @thehill Ya' think??
896545884338618368 2017-08-12 01:36:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @toddstarnes You mean it wasn't the complete disregard for obeying laws by BLM, Antifa, and people like Jackson and Obama stoking race wars?
896545260012265476 2017-08-12 01:33:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Going at 12:15pm. Our pastor says you choose door #1(Heaven) or door #2(not Heaven!) regarding attending Mass on holidays.
896520043927883777 2017-08-12 23:53:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors He is stunning!
896086646252122112 2017-08-11 19:11:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Looks like a new Yoga position, LOL!
895713734198411264 2017-08-10 18:29:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Do all of the condors have an antenna like that? I've never seen it on the adults' tags. Does it blend in with their feathers?
895706446976909314 2017-08-10 18:00:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly Great look, but lose the crawl at the bottom and wood planks transitions. Loved the Skype guests. Perfect touch.
895078579125460992 2017-08-08 00:25:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Thank you.
895073484023508992 2017-08-08 00:05:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Why does it only have the last two numbers instead of all three numbers?
895017219389874180 2017-08-08 20:21:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Amen!
894966503564603393 2017-08-08 17:00:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Love it. Smart cat!
894586635165237249 2017-08-07 15:50:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Mr. Woods, sir, you are the master of hashtags!
894567823279828993 2017-08-07 14:36:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @roseOyuma That certain puts a new perspective on things!  But, it's the only way to go.
894265992536260609 2017-08-06 18:36:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @johncatoir @dvd1277 Amen!
894191601974726657 2017-08-06 13:41:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Me either.  This idiot appointed Muller when he shouldn't have and he will give him additional the additional authority that he should have.
894190903363080192 2017-08-06 13:38:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @FoxNewsSunday @brithume Thank goodness for that, but I'm not confident he won't get it.  He should not have been appointed in the first place.
893616806488715264 2017-08-04 23:37:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento Reese Lukei was with the very first eagle nest I watched 9 yrs.ago at Norfolk Botanical Gardens. He's a good person and great w/the birds.
893459559943155717 2017-08-04 13:12:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly She will be the smatest one on it!
893170710016929792 2017-08-03 18:04:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods You know they get really big, don't you?
893124102504030209 2017-08-03 14:59:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors When will the Devil's Gate chick get his/her first exam and wing tag?
892800394019188736 2017-08-02 17:32:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @ProtecttheFaith @sitsio Embracing the world/flesh is dangerous. Pride goeth before a fall. Maybe Martin should take a lesson from Corapi.
892771788110868486 2017-08-02 15:39:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatt2013 It gets published 1) it's in a Jesuit magazine, 2) it fits with the spirit of the world, 3) the Devil is alive and well in many minds/hearts
892488894536712192 2017-08-01 20:55:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @JamesMartinSJ @ProtecttheFaith @kattolikamente Oh, St. Ignatius. You would not recognize your own order today.
892462799112351744 2017-08-01 19:11:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @newtgingrich @SpeakerRyan Promises, promses. I don't believe anything you swamp rats say. Actions speak louder than words. Show us!
892452040982614016 2017-08-01 18:28:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @JamesMartinSJ @ProtecttheFaith I didn't know that the teachings of the Catholic Faith were a majority rule option. What is that about the road to Hell is wide and smooth??
892451546272804865 2017-08-01 18:26:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @betkhy @HellgateOsprey Who knew those little birds who are so common in my backyard would be Internet stars!
892442417726726144 2017-08-01 17:50:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @frrocketdan Oh, that made my day! Bravo, Father, we could use more priests with a sense of humor.
892432313174413312 2017-08-01 17:10:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @FatherTF St. Alphonsus has been my go to saint for spiritual direction for over 20 years. Everyone should read his "Uniformity with God's Will"
892428781088124928 2017-08-01 16:56:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @toddstarnes Laura Ingraham
892022030681481217 2017-07-31 13:59:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods He can't possibly do as much damage as Obama did. In fact, he might do a lot of good if people like Bill would stop posturing. @BillKristol
891750193686818817 2017-07-30 19:59:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @PatriciaHeaton @PetriOP You never know what seemly little thing will impact someone for life. The Holy Spirit uses all of us in ways we will only know in heaven.
891739105477963776 2017-07-30 19:15:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods That was fabulous! They were both so undervalued.
891707959956426752 2017-07-30 17:11:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @PatriciaHeaton Been there, done that too! Great tweet!
891683716275351553 2017-07-30 15:35:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @VRValicento Maybe the parents think Bailey is flying from one nest to another, LOL!
891683494434406400 2017-07-30 15:34:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @VRValicento This has been such a bad year for all osprey nests. Think I'm going to stick to eagles/condors although last year for the condor was bad.
891682383128395776 2017-07-30 15:30:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @VRValicento Yes, I know. Haven't heard if parents found her, again, and are feeding her.
891681955372314627 2017-07-30 15:28:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @VRValicento I agree I thought it was strange to put Bailey in another osprey's nest. I just hope the poor thing fledges before anything else can happen.
891444487695867904 2017-07-29 23:45:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Very impressive!
891296874027773952 2017-07-29 13:58:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly Such a happy little dog! Love her expressions.
891030785960153088 2017-07-28 20:21:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillKristol Isn't that an oxymoron?
891030164439793665 2017-07-28 20:18:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Really? Could have fooled me. I thought you were just a pompous elitist. Oh wait! That is a McCain RINO!
891025862451220482 2017-07-28 20:01:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I am trying to convince myself to keep watching osprey nests. Every one I watched had tragedies thus year. I might need to go back to eagles
891019292556349440 2017-07-28 19:35:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @GOP @RealJamesWoods We need an alternative to both of these loser parties. They are the same snakes in different skins.
891011889823703040 2017-07-28 19:06:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods A picture is worth 1,000 words.

890944283070607361 2017-07-28 14:37:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @nytimes @brithume McCain has always been a RINO but he has become an obstructionist to his own party. If NYT loves him, you know we are in trouble.
890943454016143364 2017-07-28 14:34:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly He should have retired years ago, but continues to work against his own party. He, Collins, and Murkowski are Dems, they should switch now.
890568338442768386 2017-07-27 13:43:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @ladygaga @RealJamesWoods Exactly. Combat aside, basic training and daily military life is stressful. Certainly the trans community doesn't need any more stress.
890552017982193665 2017-07-27 12:38:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods These ideas only work for people who want to serve their country, not people trying to push an agenda, destroy the culture and make a point.
890338910848659456 2017-07-26 22:31:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @patsajak Thank you!
889892127114752002 2017-07-25 16:56:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatt2013 The "block" function is very useful too.
889491009981341696 2017-07-24 14:22:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatt2013 Father, being a priest on Twitter is like being a missionary in a pagan land. But we need courageous priests desperately.
889219369980579844 2017-07-23 20:23:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @Cuisinart I just found out about the blade recall on food processors.  I registered my processor and was not notified. Not very happy.
889173867360653318 2017-07-23 17:22:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Don't mess with cats! They rule.
888812622447095809 2017-07-22 17:26:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @diospringfield Thank you, Bishop. I wish every diocese in the U.S. had a bishop like you that clearly teaches and defends the teachings of our Church.
888793596731809793 2017-07-22 16:11:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @diospringfield @JamesMartinSJ @ProtecttheFaith I wish there was a way to clone Bp. Paprocki and put him in every diocese in the world! God bless him.
888765665984864256 2017-07-22 14:20:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism I thought Pentecost was the birthday of the Church. The BVM, Apostles, and disciples assembled together, not just Mary Magdalene.
888019108331180033 2017-07-20 12:53:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Maybe more should pay attention to 1 Timothy 4:1 and be watchful.
887332060515495936 2017-07-18 15:23:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism That's the only oil we use!
885268431934803968 2017-07-12 22:43:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @toddstarnes So sorry to hear of your grandmother's passing. She sounds like she was a truly remarkable lady.
885208138315681792 2017-07-12 18:44:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods That's true. And, the child doesn't have to be much different to be a target. It doesn't take much for the bullies to come out.
884853698945527809 2017-07-11 19:15:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Surely he is in Heaven enjoying the reward of faithful service to Our Lord.
884834476542623745 2017-07-11 17:59:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Way to go, Mr. Woods. You wield the  #INSTABLOCK  with skill and precision.

884406352000552960 2017-07-10 13:38:00 UTC <alclubb1967> God wants to give us the opportunity to grow in virtue. Like a good parent, He corrects our faults/gives us the chance to do the right thing
884405662595284992 2017-07-10 13:35:16 UTC <alclubb1967> When God sends us difficulties, it's like the boss giving you a project no one wants, but he does it because he knows you will do a good job

884210812902133761 2017-07-09 00:41:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Well, they have never let facts get in the way of their agenda.

883804044552269824 2017-07-08 21:44:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @blondegirlnj @roseOyuma I have had that prayer printed out for me to say for 25 years. It really is one that helps me stay focused on trusting God.
883796925799182337 2017-07-08 21:16:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @leizerlyn Papal infallibility is limited to dogma not personnel issues.

883707384589414408 2017-07-08 15:20:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @johncatoir I pray everyday for the grace to use difficulties as  opportunities to grow in holiness rather than squander them by complaining.
883700710864543745 2017-07-08 14:54:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Bless you, Father, for your service to our country and for being a devout faithful priest.
883699381962248194 2017-07-08 14:48:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Active participation never meant we have a job during Mass. It meant paying attention and joining our prayers w/priest in adoration of God.
883698130268585985 2017-07-08 14:43:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @JamesMartinSJ @MCITLFrAphorism Thank God for bishops like AB. Chaput. Wish they all would speak out as clearly and courageously as this. We need them desperately.
883476300337467393 2017-07-07 00:02:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism There is nothing as sweet as watching a mother cat with her babies.

883140142898315266 2017-07-06 01:46:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors I love how calm condors are. They don't seem to be in a hurry about anything and this chick is so confident and cute.
882988916487462912 2017-07-06 15:45:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @BishopPaprocki Thank you for standing courageously on the side of Church doctrine. It's easy to cave to social pressure but hard to stand firm. Bravo!
882975892548583425 2017-07-06 14:53:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Wow, I just saw that on the news. That's a pretty big quake.  Was it felt locally at the college and nest?
882772124649345024 2017-07-05 01:24:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @MELambright Funny! The chick attacks and then finally decides Mom may be OK and begs for food. Typical teen ager.
882667793325359106 2017-07-05 18:29:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Has Charlo lost more than this one chick this year? Is that nest near Hellgate?
882262022590795776 2017-07-04 15:37:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @larryelder Split personality, hypocrisy, or pathological liar? No wonder so many people don't believe anything she says.
882255446056333312 2017-07-04 15:11:04 UTC <alclubb1967> Maybe we should take some good advice from St. Augustine:pic.twitter.com/fOT1DCb2VN

879400903081676802 2017-06-26 18:08:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @BonBee81 You were lucky. My own sister lived in the French Quarter and her husband was mugged and robbed walking to the grocery store during the day.
879385112013664257 2017-06-26 17:05:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods The French Quarter was always an edgy place, even when I was in high school in the early 1960's. But, it has become violent and criminal now
879383175490830336 2017-06-26 16:57:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods New Orleans is a dirty, violent place and I still can't see why anyone wants to go there. And I am from Louisiana.

879083612452388864 2017-06-25 21:07:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey LOL! Love it!

879059533406011392 2017-06-25 19:31:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey The nest is looking GREAT!  After rain & the battles with the intruder, it was starting to breakdown around the edges, but Louis fixed it.
878677415668703232 2017-06-24 18:13:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey What a beautiful bird. I don't think we have those where I live. I have never seen one, but then again I haven't seen an osprey either, LOL
878677110419795968 2017-06-24 18:12:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @fr_pwest @FrankDagostino1 I agree. He is a direct threat to their agenda and to the demonic promptings behind it.
878633490836795392 2017-06-24 15:18:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Pondering the day - what should I do first? Play with sticks or practice flapping my wings. Decisions, decisions, what's a condor to do?

878337949154267136 2017-06-23 19:44:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods One of the greatest books and movies of all time.
878337643905503232 2017-06-23 19:43:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey As hard as it is to see these, it gives us a better idea of what to expect regarding future behavior/events in the nest.
878335076630769664 2017-06-23 19:32:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @gabriella_akat @ahebrewcatholic He was never off the campaign trail even when he was in office.
878260901647745031 2017-06-23 14:38:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @bandit65081 @HellgateOsprey Maybe true, but human interference at that level seems out of place in nature.

878243815341006848 2017-06-23 13:30:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @DailyCaller @ahebrewcatholic Actions speak louder than words. Let's see if his actions match his reputation for being honest and straightforward.
878220702117228544 2017-06-23 11:58:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly Small price to pay for a great animal friend!
878220556813729793 2017-06-23 11:57:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @cukilcline Iris and Louis on the nest, and all's right in the world!
878023320448491520 2017-06-22 22:54:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @RHolton1 That's our boy!
878020366093832193 2017-06-22 22:42:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey This nest is prime real estate. It is in high demand.
878018259395768320 2017-06-22 22:34:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Does the male do most of the defense of the nest or do they both share it equally?
878016673000902657 2017-06-22 22:27:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @BrendaC02333333 I just love that Louis. He certainly has one heck of a personality.
877992881746657280 2017-06-22 20:53:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @cukilcline Oh, beautiful loyal, Louis.  Now if we could just get Iris back on the nest for a visit, all would be complete.
877992569430433792 2017-06-22 20:51:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @TheDemocrats @RealJamesWoods @bunybunnicula Well, I was going to say that, but I didn't want to sound like I was fawning, LOL!
877974860659437568 2017-06-22 19:41:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest That's a great billboard. It's annoying that they think we are so stupid they have to tell us what to think! Don't mess with Texas.
877937509757571074 2017-06-22 17:13:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @TheDemocrats @RealJamesWoods Mr. Woods, you can pack a lot into one Tweet!  I admire that.
877934882730770432 2017-06-22 17:02:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you. Sometimes it gets to be confusing with so many emojis that I can't read the Tweet.
877934452801912832 2017-06-22 17:00:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly I actually like it a lot better.  It's more personal and I feel like you are talking directly to me, especially when I listen on my tablet.
877869340250583040 2017-06-22 12:42:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @hayleymorsen @PrisonPlanet CNN is "something" like news. They have become a parody of themselves, which is kind of hard when you are a joke to begin with.
877868205825343488 2017-06-22 12:37:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @brithume All this for no evidence of any crime to even investigate. Aren't you suppose to start with evidence of a crime first?
877622310525689856 2017-06-21 20:20:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Mabe he was asking where the nearest Starbucks is...NOT!  What else is he going to say in Arabic when he's stabbing someone.
877617842807504896 2017-06-21 20:02:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I use extra virgin  olive oil as my only oil for cooking. And it makes a great hand lotion!
877544588835246081 2017-06-21 15:11:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors When will the chick be tagged and blood tests done?
877543451323248640 2017-06-21 15:07:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Look at that wonderful baby starting to get adult feathers. He is just too cute.
877516986208706560 2017-06-21 13:22:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Louis has his favorite tree.  Do we know where Iris stays when she is not on the nest?
877301654034558979 2017-06-20 23:06:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Louis or Iris need to defend their nest or soon it will belong to some new tenants.
877268299272343552 2017-06-20 20:53:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Why does she still have clearance? She has no government job to require it.
877258222763216897 2017-06-20 20:13:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey It seems like Dudley kept both Louis and Iris in or close to the nest last year longer than they probably would have stayed in the nest.
877257858248790016 2017-06-20 20:12:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you. Just wondering.
877255573158453250 2017-06-20 20:03:21 UTC <alclubb1967> Why does Clinton still have clearance? She has no gov't job and is not a candidate anymore.http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/06/20/state-department-probes-clinton-handling-government-emails-could-pull-her-security-clearance.html
877255257809600512 2017-06-20 20:02:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Do we know how often a pair will abandon a nest after failure?
877247495306346496 2017-06-20 19:31:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey It is so sad that the timing of our chicks was off by so few days. The river conditions are improving everyday.  If they could have held on.
877207705844363264 2017-06-20 16:53:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Seems to me the Dunrovin nest doesn't have food shortages. Do they have a stocked pond on their ranch?
877206881554530304 2017-06-20 16:49:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I don't think you are cranky, Mr. Woods.  But, if you have to be cranky to get good service, something is wrong with their customer service.
877199628042735617 2017-06-20 16:21:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Why do even care about Megyn Kelly?
877199269052239872 2017-06-20 16:19:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods That pretty much guaranteed a bad review. Didn't he think beyond step 2?
877198727282348033 2017-06-20 16:17:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors I can almost fly, Mom!
876945184080240640 2017-06-19 23:29:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle What a beautiful cake! Happy Birthday.
876891304910876672 2017-06-19 19:55:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey He has a different look from Louis and Iris.
876851893661773825 2017-06-19 17:19:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Agree. This camera is for the biologists to monitor osprey activity and behavior. It's for education primarily. Our enjoyment is secondary.
876821727598309377 2017-06-19 15:19:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @BrentBozell @newsbusters Are you kidding me? What about all the violent rhetoric on the left's side, the attacks on Trump supporters and conservative speakers?
876821332264136704 2017-06-19 15:17:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @BrendaC02333333 Maybe we need some garlic in the nest to banish this relentless bird. Maybe a lone male? I don't think a female would attack like that.
876820903698497536 2017-06-19 15:16:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @BrendaC02333333 This is just weird. It's not early in the breeding season. All mated pairs should have either eggs or chicks in their nests. Who is this?
876604521392345092 2017-06-18 00:56:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I appreciate your explanation, but not one of us has a right to complain about anything regarding what we are receiving as a courtesy.
876577863310471169 2017-06-18 23:10:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @mtantiques1 Outstanding shots of our brave Louis!
876576282565386240 2017-06-18 23:04:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @betkhy I know birds don't get rabies, but this intruder is just crazy!
876574995442544640 2017-06-18 22:58:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @TigressDB Yes, Louis has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is a tireless and brave defender of his nest. He is outstanding.
876574358042537984 2017-06-18 22:56:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @mtantiques1 Louis the Braveheart will never let anyone take his nest! But, I sure wish the intruders would let him rest, fish, and hang out with Iris.
876573571967049732 2017-06-18 22:53:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento Beautiful comments, Valerie.
876496373893431296 2017-06-18 17:46:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Was there an intruder this morning again?  I & L have given the ultimate. They have no more to give. Go away!
876494930390257664 2017-06-18 17:40:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @johncatoir Exactky! Joy is not the same as happiness. It's knowing you are right where God wants you to be and accepting His will for you.
876490076871467008 2017-06-18 17:21:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Do all realize not one intruder landed on the nest because of L & I defense.  This experience helps for next year.
876483829749477376 2017-06-18 16:56:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you, Dr. Greene. It helps to put things into perspective. Knowing this type of aggression is so odd helps to hope for next year.
876475315287191553 2017-06-18 16:22:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I & L did a magnificent job with the unsurmountable odds they faced - river conditions bad, unrelenting attacks. Bravo I & L
876465742677512193 2017-06-18 15:44:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Did he bring the fish to the nest for Iris or eat it all himself off the nest? Do you know if Iris has eaten?
876463382735540225 2017-06-18 15:35:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I know how hard this must be on you who work so closely with Dr. Greene, etc. I appreciate your professionalism but know you are hurting too
876455813384163328 2017-06-18 15:05:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you for showing Louis.
876455326383525888 2017-06-18 15:03:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Has Louis been seen? Any updates are better than nothing. All of us know what's happened. Please don't leave us hanging.
876201491845062657 2017-06-17 22:14:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I know this probably harder on y'all than on us since you work so closely with the MOP/Dr. Greene. Thank you for keeping a level head for us
876183614341480448 2017-06-17 21:03:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 6/17/17 15:00 The oldest check is doing a great imitation of Iris's yakking! Must be a female!
876174669853986817 2017-06-17 20:28:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Louis is amazing in the way he flipped over to defend.  I just can't say enough about what a great mate he is.
876173422681784320 2017-06-17 20:23:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @mtantiques1 Oh, bless your heart, Louis the Braveheart!  At least we know Louis is not injured and has been back to the nest today.
876115027123728391 2017-06-17 16:31:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you, Dr. Greene. At least we are not the only ones who think this relentless attack is unusual. Please let us know if you see Louis.
876107575418392577 2017-06-17 16:01:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey This has certainly been a rough few days for our ospreys. I'm so sorry to hear about little one.
876087007080067073 2017-06-17 14:39:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 06/17/17 8:39 The river looks better today. Louis could fish is that darned intruder would leave them alone.
876054096742109184 2017-06-17 12:29:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @NYCBwestbury @BillOReilly Well, isn't she just too cute. I think I know what that look on her face means. I've seen it in my cats many times.
875889013491675137 2017-06-16 01:33:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Well he needs to have his osprey eyesight checked!
875887586639794177 2017-06-16 01:27:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Relentless intruders were at the Savannah osprey nest. The chick was killed when parents fought intruder in the nest.
875886692573556736 2017-06-16 01:23:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Then what is it?
875885602893385728 2017-06-16 01:19:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey If there is no fish, I don't understand what the intruder is after. It's awfully late in the season to be trying to take the best, isn't it?
875882557027561476 2017-06-16 01:07:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Do ospreys ever attack each other in the air? When Louis flies off is he going after the intruder?
875880620550914049 2017-06-16 00:59:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 6/16/17 18:58 This has been a very long intruder attack. Don't think I have seen one this prolonged at this nest.
875879036496621568 2017-06-16 00:53:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I'm wrong. That is my time. Montana time is currently 18:53
875874707320561664 2017-06-16 00:36:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey What time is that? Montana time right now would be 19:36
875535108740132866 2017-06-15 02:06:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 6/15/17 20:03 Where is the smallest chick? I only see the two older ones eating.
875435436696625152 2017-06-15 19:30:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @dish_answers Thank you so much!
875415100370419714 2017-06-15 18:09:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @dish_answers When is DISH going to get One America News on its lineup?? Would love to have it.
875385473476251650 2017-06-15 16:12:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey The river is certainly running fast today. Is any more rain expected? When should the level go down for better fishing.
875377585819144192 2017-06-15 15:40:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @NancyPelosi @OANN @TYLER5MITH How about all those representatives calling for resistance of any kind start walking back their hateful rhetoric and support unity.
875126890792726528 2017-06-14 23:04:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Aww, cndirchicjs are just the sweetest things. And condor parents are the gentlest of all.
875086468791840768 2017-06-14 20:24:07 UTC <alclubb1967> Great article I hope all political leaders will read and take to heart:http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/06/14/scalise-shooting-democrats-drop-violent-rhetoric-stop-trying-to-delegitimize-trump-and-be-real-leaders.html
875075863938818049 2017-06-14 19:41:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @jhodnot What hatred people like this have for others that don't agree with them. Is she teaching that to her new grandbaby? @DPCconsultants
875074617991467009 2017-06-14 19:37:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @gcgrytdal @JackPosobiec What kind of person would say such a thing?
875064519810330624 2017-06-14 18:56:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I meant the ospreys who don't migrate but stay in one place like the ones you mentioned in Florida.
875061718875090945 2017-06-14 18:45:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey For those resident O's do the mated pairs stay together all year like eagles?
875059298287669250 2017-06-14 18:36:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey It happened on this year's nest and was recorded but I don't know if they keep more than a week's worth of recordings.
875055223802384384 2017-06-14 18:19:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods They have created the climate of violence towards those they disagree with, call it free speech, Kathy Griffin, Snoop Dog, plays in the park
875039174432354304 2017-06-14 17:16:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I saw a chick do the same thing on a golden eagle nest. It wandered to the edge of the nest and died during the night.
875034863358947328 2017-06-14 16:59:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @blondegirlnj @DouayRheims Exactly!  Preach the truth in season and out of season like St. Paul said.
875034432243208194 2017-06-14 16:57:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey #OspreyAnswers Is there a time when we can feel that #4 chick will survive, i.e. being fed regularly?  Days or weeks?
875016379312852993 2017-06-14 15:45:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @TimJGraham @ScottJW Should never have been allowed in the first place. The should be responsible for what they print.
875015827480825857 2017-06-14 15:43:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @TerryMcAuliffe @charliekirk11 @Defend_Reality No, all the other times should have been condemned vigorously by leaders.  They were tacitly approved so they keep happening.
875011485440847872 2017-06-14 15:26:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @TerryMcAuliffe @charliekirk11 @Defend_Reality That is one time. All other times have incited violence against police, rioted and caused damage, set things on fire, etc. Antifa same thing
875010350336409606 2017-06-14 15:21:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @TerryMcAuliffe @charliekirk11 @Defend_Reality They have all called those things free speech and have not done anything to stop the violence perpetrated on their side.
875004117596348416 2017-06-14 14:56:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @TerryMcAuliffe @charliekirk11 The libs have set up a climate in this country where they approve violence by BLM, Antifa, Kathy Griffin and plays depicting assasinations.
874990554471436288 2017-06-14 14:02:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey #OspreyAnswers  When a large live fish is delivered to the nest, are the chicks in danger from the flapping fish tail, etc.
874977612153724928 2017-06-14 13:11:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @Birdgirl128 Way to go, Louis.  You da man!
874738055357321217 2017-06-13 21:19:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @gcgrytdal @FoxNews What a jackass.  He just wanted to get Sessions to say something he could attack him on later.
874718388916019200 2017-06-13 20:01:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @Birdgirl128 I like this type of assembly line feeding.  Everyone has a good chance at getting fed.
874692307135725568 2017-06-13 18:17:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @kathygriffin @gcgrytdal I'm with you. And, those same people get insulted when you treat them the same way.
874649106857197568 2017-06-13 15:26:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @brithume When have the facts or the Constitution ever mattered to Dems.
874648738354081794 2017-06-13 15:24:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors He/she is just too cute!
874340255872274433 2017-06-12 18:58:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 6/12/17 12:55 When Louis took the leftover fish, he took a lot of the dead grass with him. Good for unobstructed view.
874339961235001344 2017-06-12 18:57:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Those two bigger chicks, Godzilla and Mothra, just muscle their way over the top of Baby, but he manages to get fed.
874329334705774596 2017-06-12 18:15:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey But there is a development from the tarsal crawl to standing on their legs and walking around the nest.
874328616313782272 2017-06-12 18:12:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @brithume Gosh, Brit, there you go again being logical.
874321365473669121 2017-06-12 17:43:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Again, McCain is a RINOsaur. The kindest thing is to assume he has dementia. He is dangerous and I wouldn't want to depend on him in a war.
874308166024089601 2017-06-12 16:51:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @mtantiques1 That little one has to use other means to get in there rather than muscle.  Good for him! He's a smart little one.
874294690362920960 2017-06-12 15:57:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey You have to expect reality when watching these nests. Surviving the nest increases survival in the wild. We can't interfere. It's nature.
874288530608017410 2017-06-12 15:33:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Yep!  Whole lot of bonking going on!
874262237288050688 2017-06-12 13:48:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 6/12/17 7:48 Littlest one is getting fed some.
874261034571374598 2017-06-12 13:44:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 6/12/17 7:42 With Iris in the way we will just have to guess as who is getting fed
874013325482438657 2017-06-11 21:19:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @groom_denise I was really hoping 4 got something but Louis was blocking and when he moved I saw it was 3 that she was feeding. I hope I am wrong
874010875962818562 2017-06-11 21:10:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @hopiwmn @groom_denise I thought so too but then realized one of the older ones had gotten back into the nest bowl. I could never be sure she fed the youngest.
874001946520236034 2017-06-11 20:34:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @Head4BizBod4Sin I feel the same way.
873998413637046272 2017-06-11 20:20:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I don't even see #4. #2 and #3 are back in the bowl but I don't see #4.
873995754163064832 2017-06-11 20:10:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Well, he needs to go find something to do besides bother our ospreys while the chicks are getting fed.
873995268697575425 2017-06-11 20:08:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Looks like #3 got back into the nest bowl and #4 is behind the fish's tail.
873994555787554816 2017-06-11 20:05:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @feathersong Yes, but it's a lot harder for the youngest to get fed if the other two are out of the nest bowl and he's left behind.
873993836313358336 2017-06-11 20:02:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Oh, I think Iris is finally feeding the littlest one.
873993518376726528 2017-06-11 20:01:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Who's the guy in the green shirt waving at us?
873991557170552833 2017-06-11 19:53:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey That fish is big enough for all three, but youngest one is out of Iris's feeding station.
873989118455406592 2017-06-11 19:43:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey The two older chicks moved out of the nest bowl and are being fed. The younger chick is kind of out of the feeding area.
873977052529078272 2017-06-11 18:55:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey It can be very hard to watch nature unfiltered. I think your advisory is very wise and timely. These cams are not for the faint of heart.
873923343480762369 2017-06-11 15:22:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I agree that Louis has more than proven he can provide when able. It's easy for us to sit at home and think he's slacking off, but he's not.
873713507128225793 2017-06-10 01:28:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors He is magnificent!
873613416325316609 2017-06-10 18:50:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Now that the last egg has hatched, we can concentrate on stuffing those babies full of fish and watching them grow!
873609488930140160 2017-06-10 18:35:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey #ospreyanswers Why does a chick sometimes vigorously shake its head just after Iris puts food in its mouth. Help w/swallow?
873590617141641217 2017-06-10 17:20:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @enriquesgirl I agree. That's the silver lining in a sad situation.
873521093230944257 2017-06-10 12:43:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Al Gore thinks he can fight "global warming" by flying around in his private plane and using all that electricity at his mansion.
873515360200216576 2017-06-10 12:21:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey The hardest part about Twitter is saying what you would like and keeping it short enough to fit within the 140 characters.
873359806454800385 2017-06-09 02:02:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 6/9/17 19:00 Love the way Louis moved in right away to take the fish as soon as Iris let go of it. He had been eyeing it.
873358276859236352 2017-06-09 01:56:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 6/9/17 19:55 Isn't that the third whole fish Louis has delivered today?  He is doing a super job of providing for the family
873274526787936257 2017-06-09 20:24:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @DawnaB3 By then, they will look and act more like adults and he will have no problem feeding them like he feeds Iris.
873229067826364417 2017-06-09 17:23:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I always gave my sound off anyway so I haven't noticed.
873222295682154499 2017-06-09 16:56:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 6/9/17 10:56 Looks like chicks are getting much better at snagging the food from Iris's beak. They progress so fast.
873207094845071360 2017-06-09 15:56:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Sorry, I forgot the time I was asking about: 6/9/17 9:55
873206240989650946 2017-06-09 15:52:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Did Louis just bring in a second fish for this morning? I wasn't able to watch to see it live.
873199799780204544 2017-06-09 15:27:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly Great column, Bill.
873193150562566144 2017-06-09 15:00:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Good job, Louis.  You are showing your prowess as a Fisherbird extraordinaire!
873192685410144256 2017-06-09 14:58:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @ChuckNellis Not really. He just needs to retire and be done with it. He's a RINOsaur
872997554484637697 2017-06-08 02:03:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @Dbacks @SenJohnMcCain With all due respect, you just wanted Comey to say something to incriminate Trump. You try everything to undermine POTUS. Please retire.
872950169188302848 2017-06-08 22:55:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @SecondLady @VP Congratulations! My husband and I just celebrated our 50th!
872919407806337024 2017-06-08 20:52:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @gcgrytdal @6bird4 Wouldn't it have been nice to have someone like Kasowitz questioning Comey.  Only Rubio managed to do a good job. RINOs are not helping.
872844772746121216 2017-06-08 15:56:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly He should be charged and prosecuted.
872841371597635585 2017-06-08 15:42:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly What a sleazeball Comey is!
872840996912066560 2017-06-08 15:41:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @brithume Beautiful!  Very nice.  Congratulations to her. My granddaughter will graduate HS next year.
872837511298547713 2017-06-08 15:27:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @brithume Right choice, Brit.  You are a very classy person.
872803090143096832 2017-06-08 13:10:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle On what grounds? Stupidity? In that case an awful lot of people could be deported.
872605449929060355 2017-06-07 00:05:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Thank you. I realize I misstated it as a Peruvian instead of Andean Condor.
872605060253057024 2017-06-07 00:03:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Thank you.
872590457943064577 2017-06-07 23:05:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @BrendaC02333333 I don't see how he cpwas able to ven carry that one! That is humongous!
872577027148316672 2017-06-07 22:12:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @kittez Great picture of the two chicks.  Such concentration!
872564646229815297 2017-06-07 21:23:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @OANN It's time for the UN headquarters to move to some place where their dislike for Israel is more at home. They are a disgrace.
872562392697384961 2017-06-07 21:14:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @GraeagleGrl To me it shows that he has matured/is gaining experience daily. Just since the first chick hatched he is more comfortable w/chicks, etc.
872561649466605569 2017-06-07 21:11:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @BrentBozell Well, then I guess Lauer can show us where the "emotional" court is that he intends for Trump to be tried in for his alleged crime.
872560422272061440 2017-06-07 21:06:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Louis has certainly stepped up to the plate in being a #1 level mate. He's a worthy mate to Queen Iris.
872544135667998725 2017-06-07 20:01:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Since we don't for sure which chick survived, what do we call them? 1& 2, 1 & 3, 2 & 3, older one, younger one, ?
872530138965135360 2017-06-07 19:06:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @gcgrytdal @douglasernst I hope she wins big time. This is the only way to fight back with these universities and cites who won't protect people.
872527402198593538 2017-06-07 18:55:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 6/7/17 12:54 Looks like Louis wants to feed someone, but he keeps doing to Iris's tail end.
872526527157727232 2017-06-07 18:51:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I wish Iris would hold on to any fish Louis brings in so she could have something in reserver for the chicks later on.
872526206591217664 2017-06-07 18:50:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors  Thank you for having the live Q & A. It was very informative and I appreciate knowing more about Condors.
872525897424920577 2017-06-07 18:49:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @foolkillerskat He'll get it.  I have faith in my boy, Louis.
872525244191449090 2017-06-07 18:46:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Oh great, another new baby!  I just tuned in to the good news. Overjoyed at the new baby.
872507887612043266 2017-06-07 17:37:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors #condorquestions What are the defense actions they can take when threatened?
872499887685894144 2017-06-07 17:05:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors #condorquestions How does the Calif Condor differ from the Peruvian Condor.
872499648849641474 2017-06-07 17:05:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors #condorquestions  Where does the micro trash come from that condors ingest?
872498250154217472 2017-06-07 16:59:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @gcgrytdal @JessieJaneDuff Since when does a mayor get to determine state visits from foreign governments. If he canceled every person he disagreed who would be left.
872497977113313280 2017-06-07 16:58:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey That boy needs to leave the fish! But, he's my buddy so I can't really complain.
872497143847714816 2017-06-07 16:55:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors I would like to ask a question if there's still time. Where does all the microtrash come from that is found in chicks/adults
872483246969417728 2017-06-07 15:59:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly Well, the truth has never worked for the left.
872467295431516160 2017-06-07 14:56:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @YouTube @HellgateOsprey @BirdCams Well alrighty then!  Get ready for another bobblehead!
872451501670756354 2017-06-07 13:53:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 6/7/17 7:51 I thought I saw a pip on the egg to the left of the chick.
872199817207926787 2017-06-06 21:13:35 UTC <alclubb1967> So, this is why we don't need the Paris Agreement to tell us how to be environmentally responsible: http://www.oann.com/report-u-s-ranks-high-on-list-of-countrys-with-cleanest-air/
872198349889392644 2017-06-06 21:07:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Louis is still learning that he can't take the fish away with him like he did before chicks. He has to leave it for Iris.
872162447519617024 2017-06-06 18:45:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Dr. Greene said they have never seen this happen at this nest before. The exact same thing happened at the golden eagle nest I am watching.
872154446133907456 2017-06-06 18:13:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you, Dr. Greene, for very insightful comments.
872153405904613376 2017-06-06 18:09:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey My sentiments exactly.
872152812951621632 2017-06-06 18:06:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey That's what I thought.
872150655166754820 2017-06-06 17:58:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Even though that was not the biggest fish, looks like the little chick is getting full and Iris is getting a nice lunch.
872149117107134468 2017-06-06 17:52:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Yes, exactly.
872148625270476800 2017-06-06 17:50:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey It would be better chances for the remaining potential chicks/eggs (regarding days between hatchings) if #2 is the survivor.
872147045452308481 2017-06-06 17:43:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you for the update. Amazing that a day old chick could crawl out that far,but nature is baffling at times.
872131962193969153 2017-06-06 16:43:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Exactly. We just happen to see it as it happens, but we never know how many similar things happens regularly. The statistics tell the story.
872130806512316417 2017-06-06 16:39:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Mutual admiration society!
872129324358545408 2017-06-06 16:33:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey No one should feel offended. This is a service that is provided to us out of courtesy. We are the ones who should not offend you guys.
872113671190839296 2017-06-06 15:31:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento I couldn't catch a fish even standing in a shallow pond with a net!
872112176869367808 2017-06-06 15:25:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @Conservative_VW The one with the cramp in his eyebrows.
872081601194328064 2017-06-06 13:23:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you for letting us know.
872066122220285956 2017-06-06 12:22:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Survival in nature is a balancing act. Everything has to work out perfectly: weather, food, timing, no human interference.
872063562822426624 2017-06-06 12:12:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @GovAbbott And today, people of that same age are crying for their safe spaces.
872063335004606465 2017-06-06 12:11:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I think that is a parody account, but it sure is in the possibility of something she would say.
872063108080160768 2017-06-06 12:10:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you for the Twitter feed. No one owes viewers anything. There nests that have no chat option. We should be grateful.
871870613635440642 2017-06-05 23:25:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @blondegirlnj Gorgeous photo and beautiful quote.
871868520732270594 2017-06-05 23:17:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Sure am glad I don't have to fish for my every meal. Pretty sure I wouldn't do nearly as well as Louis.
871867568264540160 2017-06-05 23:13:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey With the river as high and fast, he is going to get what he can.
871866865575972864 2017-06-05 23:10:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Great shot of our hard working Louis!
871866588781215746 2017-06-05 23:09:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @nilereflection After watching lots of nests over the last 8 years, it happens at every nest but mods are good at keeping it under control.
871847927278444549 2017-06-05 21:55:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @rae926 @HellgateOsprey With everything y'all have to keep track of, I can imagine that some things get lost in the shuffle.  You are forgiven, LOL!
871829791388962816 2017-06-05 20:43:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 6/5/17 15.43  Is that Dr. Greene showing someone the nest?
871828577817427970 2017-06-05 20:38:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Isn't that why she puts her wings to the side a bit and seems to put a lot of her weight on the wings?
871827088386527232 2017-06-05 20:32:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you for the reminder.  It's easy to assign human emotions to animals, but it does a disservice to their instinct and how nature works.
871757761138130945 2017-06-05 15:57:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @gcgrytdal @RealJamesWoods Aren't they!
871757361374838784 2017-06-05 15:55:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods You can't have diversity of thought until you get rid of the thought police on your campus. Good luck with that!
871723052794597377 2017-06-05 13:39:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Just tuned in to see that we have a second chick!  Congratulations to Iris and Louis and all CHOWs. Lots of excitement.
871700816251437056 2017-06-05 12:10:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Oh my goodness, that is such a great picture! Like father, like chick!
871539489557983232 2017-06-04 01:29:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 6/4/17 20:29 Iris seems to be facing the wrong way again. I would think she would automatically face into the wind.
871538567931076608 2017-06-04 01:26:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I was wondering what was going on. Thanks for letting us know.
871498735913586688 2017-06-04 22:47:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @USA_Gunslinger @gcgrytdal @THETRUMPBUREAU God bless Texas and Gov. Abbott for leading the way! Proud to be a Texan.
871450066640265216 2017-06-04 19:34:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey If I could reach through my computer screen, I'd yank it out of the nest and hide it from Louis. That boy and his sticks!!
871448869145427968 2017-06-04 19:29:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I haven't been able to watch much today. I saw the feeding and that horrible stick that was stuck to the fish. Did Iris move it?
871415532423004160 2017-06-04 17:17:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @dclubb25 Well, you just can't fix stupid. I'll lead an effort to buy a plane ticket so Maxine can go tell them in person.
871346718851215360 2017-06-04 12:43:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you, Dr. Greene, for giving us that information and perspective. It is easy to think we are watching a TV show instead of real life.
871159960889040896 2017-06-03 00:21:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Oh I know he bypassed Congress. It still seems blatant even for him/Kerry. It's so obviously wealth re-distribution.
871156278256586752 2017-06-03 00:06:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Yes, it seems rather stupid on our part to have ever agreed to it and pointless anyway.
871118107816869888 2017-06-03 21:35:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @feathersong Definitely!
871117033894690816 2017-06-03 21:31:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @hayleymorsen @CollinRugg Maybe they could do a tour across the country. But, if the same number of people showed up to that as to Hillary rallies.....
871116824309415936 2017-06-03 21:30:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Also, official weather temps are taken in the shade. The nest is in full sun.
871116509271044097 2017-06-03 21:28:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @hayleymorsen @mitchellvii They can't even tell us for sure what the weather will be tomorrow much less in 100 years.
871109885680689152 2017-06-03 21:02:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento Very carefully!
871109657070141440 2017-06-03 21:01:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Crocodiles are actually very handsome and fascinating animals to look at.  This, not so much.
871103241043361792 2017-06-03 20:36:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Has Louis been back to the nest since the first time this morning? Any more fish?
871098545813585920 2017-06-03 20:17:32 UTC <alclubb1967> So, this is why Trump pulled us out of the out of balance Paris Agreement. No brainer.pic.twitter.com/7Xkju34tU4
871047999731843072 2017-06-03 16:56:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @needtobeunited The "executive order" means nothing anyway. NYC can't enter into an agreement with foreign countries. It's pure showboating.
871047480011497472 2017-06-03 16:54:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @brithume Since when do actual facts matter to the leftists?
871046669525106688 2017-06-03 16:51:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @stang_71 And then there's that!
871045768383127552 2017-06-03 16:47:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Poor Louis. He finally got to be an expert at egg sitting and now there is something moving in his nest.
871043613395795969 2017-06-03 16:39:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods So does that mean he is going to send money to India so they can ignore the agreement? Didn't realize NYC had that much extra cash.
871036011530248192 2017-06-03 16:09:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods You nailed it, Mr. Woods. Pelosi hasn't been a true Catholic in a very long time.
871025696964976640 2017-06-03 15:28:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Wow, that didn't take long from pip to hatch.  That is one strong and active chick!  Woohoo!  We have a baby.  Pass out the fish cigars.
870978973085216768 2017-06-03 12:22:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey WOOHOO!! PIP, PIP HOORAY, WE HAVE A PIP TODAY!!!
870782766165573632 2017-06-02 23:22:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Look at that cutie patootie! He looks so inquisitive and ready to take on the world.
870729514342424576 2017-06-02 19:51:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @brithume @AsheSchow She took the exit ramp off of Life's Highway long before she reached Reality!
870728908005441536 2017-06-02 19:48:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @charliekirk11 @FrankDagostino1 And now she's saying she was bullied by POTUS. These people took the exit ramp way before reality!
870726895406469120 2017-06-02 19:40:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @CurtisHouck But no one should be allowed to go after her??? She is not an 11 yr. old child even though she behaves worse than one. Sauce for the goose..
870726045086789632 2017-06-02 19:37:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @dclubb25 But she doesn't like it when she experiences the consequences of her actions. Libs don't mind putting conservatives out of business.
870725654349725696 2017-06-02 19:35:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @BrentScher She ruined herself by her own actions. Trump is not doing anything. How about the Christians bakers, florists, photogs ruined by the left?
870711274820083712 2017-06-02 18:38:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @OANN Who DIDN'T she send classified info to???????
870703211723620353 2017-06-02 18:06:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @Wanda_D_R Last year the egg at Kofords Ridge was destroyed by a predator. It was replaced with a fake until they could put in a ready to hatch egg.
870699675501838341 2017-06-02 17:52:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin Boycotting and getting sponsors to bail is what the left does to conservatives all the time. She is getting a taste of her own medicine.
870698535280230400 2017-06-02 17:48:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @kathygriffin cries about losing jobs because of her actions. The left boycotts conservatives all the time & puts them out of business.
870695004817178624 2017-06-02 17:34:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Well, Harriet did lay her first egg 2 days before Iris, so we have plenty of time.
870694549571616768 2017-06-02 17:32:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @feathersong I agree. #815 was the first Condor chick I had watched and he was so fiesty and cute!
870693453910261761 2017-06-02 17:27:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I thought there was a hatch when I saw the way Harriet was behaving earlier. Great news!
870693161600917504 2017-06-02 17:26:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP Beautiful, Father.
870692291333169153 2017-06-02 17:23:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @feathersong I do too. It was so sad about the chick I watched last year, but we have a new one to watch now.
870659447554580483 2017-06-02 15:12:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @helenetweety I decided to stop worrying about a pip and just wait for a head, LOL! Helps my blood pressure.
870619471521632260 2017-06-02 12:33:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP I battled all of that garbage in the 1970's,still battling it today w/holdovers from that time. At 71, I've lost some fire but not the will.
870478745714302978 2017-06-01 03:14:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @LifeZette Answering questions on Jeopardy does not mean you are a smart person. It only means you think anyone cares about what you have to say.
870477804969746432 2017-06-01 03:10:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @BrentBozell @newsbusters What exactly do they think will happen? The U.S. is doing its part in reducing emissions. Now we just won't pay India to not do anything
870475959144660992 2017-06-01 03:03:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you for giving a refresher course on animal instinctual behavior vs human emotional responses.
870474728821055488 2017-06-01 02:58:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Looks like her hair style is less hard hitting journalist and more soccer mom.
870473627099058176 2017-06-01 02:54:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey The Blue Jays in my neighborhood know which days of the week I fill up my peanut feeder!
870461635629989888 2017-06-01 02:06:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @MickeyLapp I agree. He is just so adorable 
870455798203244545 2017-06-01 01:43:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors I just love the way the chick is already able to climb the rocks. He/she is a cutie pie!
870441354702209024 2017-06-01 00:46:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @LisaBloom She is completely out of touch with reality. She represents decapitating the Pres. and they call her on it. How is that being bullied?
870391991330193408 2017-06-01 21:29:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @toddstarnes LOL, me too.  I remember when we were supposed to have the next Ice Age.
870391759536177152 2017-06-01 21:29:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP @FrankDagostino1 Exactly. I battled with a nun teaching a Scripture class in 1979. I was the only one who found anything wrong in what she said.
870389422436474881 2017-06-01 21:19:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Yes, He promised He would be with us and the gates of hell would not prevail against His Church.
870377909042651136 2017-06-01 20:33:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin No, our standing in the world was undermined by the Apologist in Chief who sold us out for 8 years.
870371118862880768 2017-06-01 20:07:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Oh good grief, I hear that all the time. Satan has a strong hold on our society.
870370461498064896 2017-06-01 20:04:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP @FrankDagostino1 Example: Jesus didn't know who He was, He didn't has His full powers til after the Resurrection, the words in the Bible may not be accurate.
870369723585708032 2017-06-01 20:01:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP @FrankDagostino1 Yes, he was an older priest from the '70s theology; he is still saying the same things today. I pray for the Pope, bishops, priests daily.
870358614225035264 2017-06-01 19:17:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Maybe Iris will move it. She seems to eventually get things all straightened out.
870358081426800641 2017-06-01 19:15:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @PetriOP We have a visiting priest from that time frame who preaches heresy with every  sermon. My letter to the bishop didn't help but I tried.
870343201483128832 2017-06-01 18:16:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Is anyone besides me waving at Dr. Greene through my computer screen?
870297707587411968 2017-06-01 15:15:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Oh dear! Hope the storm passes the nest by and moves out quickly.
870297528800956416 2017-06-01 15:14:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @KenJennings You won on Jeopardy but that doesn't make you a smart person. Smart people know not to pick on kids who didn't choose to be in the spotlight
870295064206950402 2017-06-01 15:04:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @StFrancisTX Wow, that must have been very special and kind of scary, LOL!  Bees are wonderful!
870068481080803328 2017-05-31 00:04:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey The wind is really blowing at the nest. Are there supposed to be storms?
870045991423979520 2017-05-31 22:35:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Thank you for the information. Seems so strange especially since he will feed the chick himself.
870034671337328641 2017-05-31 21:50:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I believe in the proper pronunciation, the "v" is silent. That's what the ancient scrolls say, if you can read hieroglyphics.
870016699868651520 2017-05-31 20:38:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey A perfect match!  What a pair of ospreys they are.
870013966881128448 2017-05-31 20:27:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I wonder if Louis is telling Iris, "Just breathe, pant, pant, pant, then breathe..."
870013768477982720 2017-05-31 20:27:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Louis sure acts like he is hearing something from the nest bowl or that something is different down there.
870004928982294528 2017-05-31 19:51:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @kathygriffin You should apologize to Pres. Trump and his wife and son. You terrorized his young son by your callous disregard for anyone but yourself.
870003908646551553 2017-05-31 19:47:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors And the male jumped down and is taking all the food.
870002914751676416 2017-05-31 19:43:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors What in the world is wrong with that male coming in to eat every time the female comes to feed the chick.
870002478598602753 2017-05-31 19:42:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors I love the way the chicks move their feet when they are sitting down.  It's like they are keeping time with their own music.
870001995901538304 2017-05-31 19:40:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @CatholicHerald @FrankDagostino1 I wasn't being serious. I am frustrated with the way things have gone under Pope Francis's papacy, but I submit to God's will in all things.
870001194336374784 2017-05-31 19:37:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @CatholicHerald @FrankDagostino1 Oh, I know that. I know the Holy Spirit cannot err. I also know that people can go against the Holy Spirit and do their own will.
869987638027075585 2017-05-31 18:43:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @Dickeys @wesandrews13 @Simple_K24 Yes, but that means I can't use my gift card. That's not right. Ever thought of that?
869986418658992130 2017-05-31 18:38:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @Dickeys @wesandrews13 @Simple_K24 Maybe you don't go to the same store where they claim the machine isn't working and it belongs to a 3rd party and they can't do anything.
869979754643898368 2017-05-31 18:11:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @Simple_K24 @Dickeys @wesandrews13 Not if they refuse to process your Dickey's gift card and you have to pay for lunch instead. Rip off!
869946652655628290 2017-05-31 16:00:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors What a sweet baby!
869937495584022528 2017-05-31 15:23:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @blondegirlnj @BrianBransfield Nine days, first novena!
869936960617328642 2017-05-31 15:21:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Nevermind. Louis us back n the best. Whew!
869936145097924608 2017-05-31 15:18:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Why is Iris eating on the nest? Where is Louis? Is it OK for the eggs to be uncovered!
869933363947159553 2017-05-31 15:07:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @CatholicHerald Well, is he talking about himself or Card. Burke? Is it bad to hope he's talking about himself?
869932462683455488 2017-05-31 15:03:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors He is magnificent but he needs to let the chick eat without competition from him, LOL!
869932019349733378 2017-05-31 15:02:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @johncatoir He is really very good and level headed.
869930666313433089 2017-05-31 14:56:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @TWITLESSTWEETER Actually, Harriet at Dunrovin laid her first egg before Iris, so she is waiting on a pip too.
869930092784304128 2017-05-31 14:54:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @RorateCaeli We din't need to lecture God on cultural advancements. He certainly knows the future and He never said obeying His laws were conditional.
869928991653740545 2017-05-31 14:50:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Hmm, is that like Trump firing Coney while he was out of town? The MSM certainly had a lot to say about that.
869913221477441536 2017-05-31 13:47:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors The third time's the charm!
869911866390097920 2017-05-31 13:42:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Woohoo!  I've been waiting for this all year.  Yippee!!!
869911554346504192 2017-05-31 13:40:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @hayleymorsen @DineshDSouza It wasn't a real apology. There is nothing improved about @kathygriffin
869910874621747202 2017-05-31 13:38:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @hayleymorsen @Pamela_Moore13 His time would be better spent indicting Hillary Clinton. Griffin is insignificant. Clinton cost lives and risked national security.
869910600486273024 2017-05-31 13:37:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @keyes_rev @AwakeDeborah Welcome, Ft. Keyes.
869909791367249920 2017-05-31 13:33:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I hope I can sing my "Pip, Pip Hooray" song soon!
869909210024169472 2017-05-31 13:31:32 UTC <alclubb1967> I wish everyone would stop posting the horrible picture of unfunny Kathy Griffin. She wants attention. We don't need to reinforce her.
869901255845396488 2017-05-31 12:59:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @MayorDeblasio @BasedMonitored @isabelmmatos Interesting, since there is no more Easter break, Christmas break, etc. It had to be changed to Spring and Winter break. Hypocrites!
869898752617623552 2017-05-31 12:49:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey It is a privilege to be able to watch this cam. It's not a right. Y'all don't owe us anything. We owe you total thanks and gratitude
869898494504386560 2017-05-31 12:48:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey You guys are the best. I've watched many other nests; some don't even have cam ops. It's just one static view. AND, y'all are all volunteers
869898263486279680 2017-05-31 12:48:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I know that you do not retweet all tweets, so if someone said something about the cam ops or mods, please know we don't all feel that way.
869887853035048960 2017-05-31 12:06:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @charliekirk11 During Obama's first term, a rodeo clown was fired just for wearing an Obama mask.  This is 1,000 times worse.
869885936536080384 2017-05-31 11:59:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @NovusOreoWatch @FrMatthewLC @CatholicMomVA @mmhebert97 Always valid, sometimes celebrated better than others. Too many on Twitter don't accept it. I'm not going to help them joke about it.
869732438045409280 2017-05-30 01:49:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @AwakeDeborah @RealJamesWoods He should withhold money for them not defending Conservatives 1st Amendment rights!
869731883709374467 2017-05-30 01:46:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @NovusOreoWatch @FrMatthewLC @CatholicMomVA About the Mass? No, too many already think the Novus Ordo is not valid and not sacred. That is nothing to joke about.
869726905972310016 2017-05-30 01:27:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @NovusOreoWatch @FrMatthewLC I've been insulted. One neighbor told me she didn't want her kids to play with mine because she didn't know if Catholics believed in Christ.
869722402384527360 2017-05-30 01:09:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey My goodness, it's almost as big as him! How did he carry it.
869715292808556545 2017-05-30 00:40:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @johncatoir I pray daily that God will give me the grace to not waste the opportunities He sends me. Each trail is an opportunity to grow in virtue.
869713914153521152 2017-05-30 00:35:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @NovusOreoWatch @FrMatthewLC Sorry, I'm not into anyone making fun of Catholics.
869713506605584384 2017-05-30 00:33:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @kathygriffin Apologize to President Trump! He's the one you threatened.
869710507548196864 2017-05-30 00:21:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @OANN @TreyYingst Nope, she's just sorry she got called on it. That was not a spontaneous slip up. It was a planned photo shoot.
869690828599570434 2017-05-30 23:03:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you for such a thorough and informative lesson in hatching. That's quite a lot of work for the chick. No wonder they are tired after.
869663126802792448 2017-05-30 21:13:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @kathygriffin You can try to call it a joke, but you are the one inciting violence as your side is always saying Pres. Trump does.
869644464834445312 2017-05-30 19:59:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @OANN I have been having trouble all morning getting onto your web site.  Is it down?
869642419880513536 2017-05-30 19:51:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC That way, I keep the meditation in front of my mind with every Hail Mary. My mind does wander some though.
869642185305718784 2017-05-30 19:50:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I try to say whatever mystery it is right after the name of Jesus, ie. "fruit of thy womb, Jesus, who suffered an agony in the garden."
869641748431155200 2017-05-30 19:48:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly I will give him an A- overall.  The Middle East was an A+ and the European part was possible an A- or B+, but he said what needed to be said
869623526235549697 2017-05-30 18:36:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @Dickeys That really doesn't seem right. How can we use the card if they won't take it. My son wasted his money on the gift card.
869623366713581569 2017-05-30 18:35:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @Dickeys My son gave me a Dickey's gift card for Mother's Day, but the local store said their machine can't process it.
869582168439259136 2017-05-30 15:51:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey When was Dr. Greene planning to put the signs up to keep people away from the upcoming nursery nest?
869581404270669824 2017-05-30 15:48:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin @PoliticalShort McCain is a #RINOsaur. He is a bitter self-absorbed obstructionist and needs to retire as soon as possible.
869335874579902464 2017-05-29 23:33:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly Thank you. My husband was in Vietnam and he was treated shamfully when he came he. He fought so that spoiled brats could insult him.
869334591110344708 2017-05-29 23:28:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods So would it be better to use an electric stove, a campfire, or just eat some kale?
869327820148932608 2017-05-29 23:01:18 UTC <alclubb1967> Looks like the Jared Kushner story is not what the media keeps pushing. Their bias is showing, again.http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/05/29/jared-kushner-didnt-suggest-russian-communications-channel-in-meeting-source-says.html
869294901632086023 2017-05-29 20:50:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I am hoping we will all be in heaven by then because these sure seem like the end times!
869289328475820032 2017-05-29 20:28:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Louis is doing exactly what he is supposed to do: fish, survive, provide and protect. He's not being ungentlemanly. He is guided by instinct
869283378335494145 2017-05-29 20:04:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Conservatives have lost the language battle in this country on every subject.
869281180151054337 2017-05-29 19:55:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Bald eagle males do it also. I have seen the male feed the female and she will then feed the chicks.
868985442871521281 2017-05-28 00:20:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @sergiomanzari I hope you are right.
868935956119920640 2017-05-28 21:04:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Oh, I didn't know that. Thanks for the tip
868932739990515712 2017-05-28 20:51:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @foolkillerskat @HellgateOsprey Well, being 71 yrs old with chronic vertigo certainly limits my abilities. But, I love watching the nest.
868931922868797441 2017-05-28 20:48:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @foolkillerskat I only do it if I have a screen capture, but mostly I just make comments that don't require the time stamp.
868931563911876608 2017-05-28 20:46:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Of course, by then, the moment has passed, LOL!
868931424870690816 2017-05-28 20:46:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Well, at least I know it's not just me.  I just look at the time on my computer, subtract one hour, convert it to military time and post.
868931194318139392 2017-05-28 20:45:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @blondegirlnj Oh wow, I made homemade chili just two nights ago.
868929866263121920 2017-05-28 20:39:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I don't know about anyone else, but the time at the top left of the screen on my computer is so tiny I can't read it at all.
868923878915153920 2017-05-28 20:16:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @MdotClure Yes, and when they have something concreted and provable, we will know about it.
868923718206185473 2017-05-28 20:15:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @MdotClure Actually, several people have stated while being questioned at Congressional hearings.
868923521380098050 2017-05-28 20:14:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @MdotClure So, all of these are from witnesses under oath at an investigation, or unnamed sources.
868923309639045121 2017-05-28 20:13:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @MdotClure You can site those all day long. According to the investigations going on, there is no evidence of collusion. None.
868922431855087618 2017-05-28 20:10:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @MdotClure I don't know what you hallucinated. I know that there was plenty of evidence, Comey sited it, Bill met with Loretta, and no charges.
868922149033168897 2017-05-28 20:09:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @MdotClure Not yet.
868921823685160960 2017-05-28 20:08:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @MdotClure You know nothing about the Trump campaign and Russia because there is NO evidence, only rumors. In Hillary's case there was evidence.
868921324512698369 2017-05-28 20:06:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @MdotClure They all quit being unbiased news outlets a long time ago. Not one of the sources you sited talked about criminal charges for Hillary.
868920064195612673 2017-05-28 20:01:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @MdotClure So, you are saying the NYT, etc wanted Hillary brought up on charges for those emails?
868919847618572293 2017-05-28 20:00:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Best answer I have heard in a VERY long time.
868919706601869312 2017-05-28 19:59:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @MdotClure Those outlets certainly did not want anyone prosecuted for the loss/destruction of them. They kept saying there was nothing to the story.
868911330882879490 2017-05-28 19:26:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @RaymondArroyo @FrMatt2013 @PetriOP @FrankDagostino1 Yes, and the language us ambiguous. Should not have footnotes that provide big loop holes.
868907365596352515 2017-05-28 19:10:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @stoolpresidente Oh I love it!
868907115162865665 2017-05-28 19:09:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @annie3592 Also right here at the beginning of Ramadan. How rude!
868905815369023493 2017-05-28 19:04:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Now the media is worried about emails. They wanted everyone to be quiet about Hillary's emails. Those weren't important. Good grief!
868905565426249728 2017-05-28 19:03:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillOReilly So, how does he combat that, Bill? They are wearing the rest of us down too.
868904819213447168 2017-05-28 19:00:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I remember when the sat pack eagle was hatched, banded and fledged. Very sad.
868904616003596289 2017-05-28 18:59:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey People either don't understand or don't care about wildlife. Two eagles were shot last week in Virginia. One had a sat pack.
868904166512570368 2017-05-28 18:57:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you. It's too close to hatch for anything to cause a problem at the nest.
868902136058458112 2017-05-28 18:49:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Hopefully something will be done soon, before something happens to cause a major disturbance to Iris/Louis. Don't wait until it's too late.
868901421030273025 2017-05-28 18:46:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest They need to be prosecuted as the traitors they are. Firing isn't enough to send a strong signal to anyone else thinking of leaking secrets.
868883740981940226 2017-05-28 17:36:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @CatholicLeague She can speak at a university but no conservative can. Should tell everyone something about our institutes of higher education in the U.S.
868877974707326976 2017-05-28 17:13:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Yes, thank goodness to Pres. Trump. If Germany had any sense, they would vote out Merkel, but they will do what France did and wimp out.
868853695034818560 2017-05-28 15:37:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @johncatoir Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam
868843182599098369 2017-05-28 14:55:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @disciple96 Probably more for me than him.  I can be a handful and he has been so patient and understanding. He will go straight to Heaven!
868842153287581697 2017-05-28 14:51:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @disciple96 My husband and I just celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary. No cakes, just a quiet day thanking God for giving me such a patient husband.
868841804585734144 2017-05-28 14:50:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @disciple96 I barely use mine.  It sits on the coffee table waiting for one of my children to text me so I can try to respond with one finger typing.
868841416738439168 2017-05-28 14:48:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @disciple96 Maybe it was for a second wedding anniversary?  That sounds more like it.
868840432385630208 2017-05-28 14:44:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @disciple96 ROTFLOL!  It would sound very much like some of the explanations I've had to make.
868840249727889409 2017-05-28 14:43:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @LeaveEUOfficial This is fabulous.  Good for her.  Time someone over there said it clearly and out loud.
868839250397196289 2017-05-28 14:39:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @disciple96 I just noticed the two holes near the front?  Candles from a birthday??
868838905713504256 2017-05-28 14:38:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @disciple96 LOL! I'll bet it would void your warranty, LOL!
868837590107127809 2017-05-28 14:33:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @disciple96 Well, just looking at it is giving me a nice feeling for today.
868837273714003968 2017-05-28 14:32:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @johncatoir @ambassador277 For gold and silver are tried in the fire, but acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation. Ecclesiasticus 2:5
868835883704868869 2017-05-28 14:26:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @disciple96 I'm giggling because it just makes me happy to look at it.  Imagine tasting it!!!
868834730820718592 2017-05-28 14:21:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @disciple96 Oh my, that looks delicious!
868834574092169216 2017-05-28 14:21:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @johncatoir I want to wish you a blessed Memorial Day and thank you for your service to our country and to the Church. You are a blessing to us all.
868809603546533888 2017-05-28 12:42:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @RaymondArroyo @FrMatt2013 @PetriOP @FrankDagostino1 I am not looking to blogs, etc. I am looking to Pope Francis to clear up confusion caused by his document, as are Cardinals, etc.
868621170458984448 2017-05-27 00:13:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @RaymondArroyo @FrMatt2013 @PetriOP @FrankDagostino1 Yes, and he should clear up all the confusion since various Bishop's conf. are giving opposing interpretations of it.
868554066196144130 2017-05-27 19:46:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC That's a strange thing to say. Who thought that one up?
868530541024468992 2017-05-27 18:13:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Good job, Louis! Now be on the alert for that pesky intruder.
868520278342742017 2017-05-27 17:32:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest It's called paying for votes.
868520140270448642 2017-05-27 17:31:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you.
868513954229825537 2017-05-27 17:07:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @TWITLESSTWEETER @HellgateOsprey @RevDCampbell I don't think that will help if you have three adult ospreys tromping around in the nest. Chesapeake nest lost their chick the same way.
868513224592850944 2017-05-27 17:04:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey What was that soaring above? It didn't look like an opsrey. Looked more like a bald eagle.
868512632013246465 2017-05-27 17:02:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @charliekirk11 Whoa! He actually said college campuses are not free speech areas. Does it say that in the Constitution?
868511596955525120 2017-05-27 16:57:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Louis is alerting about something. We need to have a perch next to the nest so Louis can stand guard!
868509182890266624 2017-05-27 16:48:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @Birdgirl128 You go, Girl!  Show him some girl power.  Louis is going to hear about it when he gets home.
868508714835341312 2017-05-27 16:46:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods It's about time some of these violent rioters were arrested. Things should not have to get out of hand before the police do their job.
868505526501617664 2017-05-27 16:33:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @TWITLESSTWEETER Louis needs to get his tail feathers home to defend his nest, his lady, and his eggs. This guy needs an attitude adjustment from our Louis.
868504863998660608 2017-05-27 16:31:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @johncatoir Exactly, Father. They were so wise to give us the electoral college so that all states had a say in the elections.
868504629243502592 2017-05-27 16:30:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @RaymondArroyo @FrMatt2013 @PetriOP Yes, yes, and yes!  Too bad the Pope himself has said those bishops have interpreted it correctly.
868503660673867780 2017-05-27 16:26:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @NRA @GregAbbott_TX @Ramona_in_1984 So he's a nut. That's not Trump's fault. Kate Steinle was killed by an illegal who should have never been here. Whose fault is that? Obama?
868492883384553472 2017-05-27 15:43:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @DailyCaller @ahebrewcatholic Who knew??? But, leftists don't know a fact when it slaps them upside the face. They deal in emotional blackmail.
868492477476605952 2017-05-27 15:41:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @NRA @GregAbbott_TX @Ramona_in_1984 Trumpster? Can't find that anywhere. Says he was yelling things about various religions/ethnicities. As usual, libs don't deal in facts.
868470064948883456 2017-05-27 14:12:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey It will be a race to see whose egg pips first, Iris's or Harriet's at Dunrovin. I'm hoping Iris's is first, LOL!
868468762604908544 2017-05-27 14:07:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @Stacey__Adams @HellgateOsprey It's private property, isn't it? There are other raptor nests that have roped off areas to keep people away from the area under the nest.
868454003847426048 2017-05-27 13:09:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @NRA @GregAbbott_TX @lheras67 @BluestateGranny Wow, such love and tolerance from the side that is always preaching that to others. Just another angry, screaming hypocrite from the left.
868450782391259136 2017-05-27 12:56:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @brithume Hillary has never let the facts get in her way. And Bill was a victim of bimbos too! Yeah, right.
868450289132728320 2017-05-27 12:54:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @BluestateGranny I am not the one who mentioned God. I only complimented Gov. Abbott on his target shooting. BTW, that"s a paper target. No one got killed.
868275302421626881 2017-05-26 01:18:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @NRA @GregAbbott_TX @lheras67 What? That the president is Satan?
868259790312681473 2017-05-26 00:17:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @blondegirlnj @pilate110 Every trial or difficulty is an opportunity to grow in virtue and holiness. Oh Lord, help me not to squander them.
868240494706524160 2017-05-26 23:00:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @NRA @GregAbbott_TX @KrispyNixon Only on all the leftover "I'm with her" signs sitting around gathering dust, lint, and mold.
868237109567643650 2017-05-26 22:47:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @NRA @GregAbbott_TX @KcParnell Law enforcement needs to know how to execute both lethal and non-lethal shots. Looks like he did both perfectly.
868232941440290816 2017-05-26 22:30:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @cukilcline You da man, Louis!
868232672832872449 2017-05-26 22:29:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @AwakeDeborah @Booshnoo Yes, as soon as unicorns stop eating the methane gas producing grass and fairies stop cooking over open fires.
868232122196254721 2017-05-26 22:27:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @SebGorka @KellyannePolls Hillary has a one track mind and that train runs only to one place - her bank account.
868231699443920896 2017-05-26 22:25:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @SebGorka @DailyCaller Love it.  Proud that my husband is an Air Force vet.
868231569022087168 2017-05-26 22:25:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @brithume Maybe if the stupid Republicans would support Pres. Trump, things would be moving along better. Boehner is a #RINOsaur like Graham & McCain.
868231009673916417 2017-05-26 22:22:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @brithume Love your spot on analysis, and you do it in 140 words or less!  Thanks.

868211088550133760 2017-05-26 21:03:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @birdfeeder65 I like the "something" part of the description, since all of them fall into that category for me, LOL

868209101486116864 2017-05-26 20:55:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Any feeling that can change from day to day should not affect laws.
868208814969032705 2017-05-26 20:54:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey It makes me nervous when Iris is trying to get the fish out of Louis's foot and they are stomping all over the nest. Those eggs are precious
868206712544800768 2017-05-26 20:46:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @alleluiaaudio @AnnieJMJ @ToupsFamily @DouayRheims @blondegirlnj @AwakeDeborah @MikeJade757 @disciple96 LOL!  Oh, he's wonderful reading C.S. Lewis's "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe", but not the Psalms.

868203179078549514 2017-05-26 20:32:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Only a few more days until pip watch.  I'm getting excited.

868202012680368128 2017-05-26 20:27:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I love how she talked about Catholics as though she is not one, well she calls herself one. But, the last sentence is typical liberal spin.
868199122737795072 2017-05-26 20:16:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @alleluiaaudio @AnnieJMJ @ToupsFamily @DouayRheims @blondegirlnj @AwakeDeborah @disciple96 @MikeJade757 I made it through 117 chapters of The Count of Monte Cristo.  They actually have St. Augustine's "Confessions", but that's better read.
868198885470195713 2017-05-26 20:15:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @AnnieJMJ @ToupsFamily @DouayRheims @blondegirlnj @AwakeDeborah @disciple96 @MikeJade757 There is a site that has free audio books: http://Librivox.com. I listen to a lot of those. They are old books, copyright free.

868194044601659393 2017-05-26 19:56:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @AnnieJMJ @ToupsFamily @DouayRheims @blondegirlnj @AwakeDeborah @MikeJade757 @disciple96 I can't read much anymore. I have chronic vertigo and reading bothers my eyes. I try to find audio books, but most are not available.
868191835671416832 2017-05-26 19:47:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @AnnieJMJ @ToupsFamily @DouayRheims @blondegirlnj @AwakeDeborah @MikeJade757 @disciple96 I just found it. Title is "Fatima in Lucia's own words" distributed by Ravengate Press
868190703045799936 2017-05-26 19:42:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @AnnieJMJ @ToupsFamily @DouayRheims @blondegirlnj @AwakeDeborah @MikeJade757 @disciple96 Yes, I think so. I am looking for it on my shelves. May take me a while, LOL!
868173831378268160 2017-05-26 18:35:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @AnnieJMJ @ToupsFamily @DouayRheims @blondegirlnj @AwakeDeborah @MikeJade757 @disciple96 Me too.
868173777196261376 2017-05-26 18:35:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @AnnieJMJ @ToupsFamily @DouayRheims @blondegirlnj @AwakeDeborah @MikeJade757 @disciple96 Yes, he's really good.
868151790457556992 2017-05-26 17:08:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain Wow, they are at least out in the open about paying for votes!
868141239111225344 2017-05-26 16:26:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @AnnieJMJ @ToupsFamily @DouayRheims @blondegirlnj @AwakeDeborah @MikeJade757 @disciple96 If haven't done so yet, read Sr. Lucia's own accounts of Fatima.  It is amazing.
868140921380118529 2017-05-26 16:24:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @AnnieJMJ @ToupsFamily @DouayRheims @blondegirlnj @AwakeDeborah @MikeJade757 @disciple96 Yes, I was sorry to see that they were sold a few years back, but seems like the new publisher kept all of their good books.
868134317410725888 2017-05-26 15:58:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @AnnieJMJ @ToupsFamily @DouayRheims @blondegirlnj @AwakeDeborah @MikeJade757 @disciple96 Anything from TAN publications is going to be good.
868134037176692737 2017-05-26 15:57:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @NRA @GregAbbott_TX Both are doing more to keep our country safe than anyone in the past 8 years. Interesting you would put God and satan in the same sentence.
868125151182942209 2017-05-26 15:22:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @NRA @GregAbbott_TX Nice shooting, Gov. Abbott! You can be my wing man any day, LOL!
868121524993228802 2017-05-26 15:07:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC No, Father, we're in Animal Farm. "All pigs are equal, but some are more equal than others."
868120758639370242 2017-05-26 15:04:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @TWITLESSTWEETER I agree.  He just has that joie de vivre!
867826312681054208 2017-05-25 19:34:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @KVolt95 @USAA_help What is your reason for pulling your advertising?
867825761582850048 2017-05-25 19:32:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC That is sick. She thinks the stores she steals from won't notice, but they pass those losses on to other customers who pay for her theft.
867808021228998656 2017-05-25 18:22:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC My diocese moves it to Sunday, but it makes no sense to me. Changes the whole Biblical time frame for 40 days, novena meaning, Pentecost.
867777209066545152 2017-05-25 16:19:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Of course, prayer helps with everything, but sometimes a person also needs medical help with severe depression.
867776911472066560 2017-05-25 16:18:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin @LilaGraceRose OMG, what has this world come to when people can say things like that.
867773687780474881 2017-05-25 16:05:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Clinical depression is quite different from feeling down, the blues, or just temporary depression. Prayer/counseling does help with latter.
867734563237367808 2017-05-25 13:30:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin @thehill @JamesDean675 I just read further and, you're right, the guy overreacted in his response to the reporter. Two wrongs don't make a right.
867722318449180672 2017-05-25 12:41:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin @thehill Can we say "set up"? Libs can't win without cheating.
867720928695914497 2017-05-25 12:36:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @brithume Oh, it's the clean waters thing. I thought maybe a mouse lived on that field and the farmer was disturbing it. Good grief! Beyond absurd!
867715399235903488 2017-05-25 12:14:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @johncatoir Well then, congratulations again and even more so! I need a calculator and note pad for everything these days.
867520934919516160 2017-05-24 23:21:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @ridepeloton What is your reason?
867489790790434817 2017-05-24 21:17:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @johncatoir Congratulations on your anniversary, Father. Thank you for being a faithful priest; may God bless you and keep you in the palm of His hand.
867481143968452610 2017-05-24 20:43:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @SenateMajLdr Apparently you are too if you can't get enough votes in the Senate to even look at the House alternative. You should be backing the Pres.
867480341354872834 2017-05-24 20:40:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest When doesn't Mitch have bad news for Trump. We have a Rep. party that won't back their own president. Can we have a 3rd party please?
867466165865656321 2017-05-24 19:43:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Louis us a one if a kind osprey! There are none like him. Don't you just love him!
867463735417462784 2017-05-24 19:34:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @brithume What exactly DOES he know other than how to capitulate on every issue.
867433268332949508 2017-05-24 17:33:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @StFrancisTX Thank you, Father Martinez, for your service and dedication. May God bless you and keep you in the palm of His hand.
867428857363783680 2017-05-24 17:15:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin @gcgrytdal Also, universities should allow all invited speakers to actually speak and not bow to hysterics from people who shut down free speech.
867417117636866048 2017-05-24 16:28:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @BrendaC02333333 I saw that and was wondering if he fell over or the wind blew him over. Poor thing.
867416957267652609 2017-05-24 16:28:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin @gcgrytdal When universities/schools allow separate graduations/proms based on race/ethnicity, we are no longer Americans, but hyphenated cultures.
867406401886400512 2017-05-24 15:46:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin Exactly. American used to be described as the melting pot where everyone came her, assimilated and we were all Americans. Not any more.
867405267998322688 2017-05-24 15:41:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @FrankDagostino1 I agree. According to recent studies, the media coverage of Trump has been about 90% negative.
867398500509724672 2017-05-24 15:14:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Me thinks they doth protest too much!
867397801516425217 2017-05-24 15:12:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC No, they shouldn't be. I don't agree with everything Trump has said, but he did great in Saudi Arabia and Israel.
867396166916476928 2017-05-24 15:05:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC What Americans think has nothing to do with Mrs. Trump's rosary, her visit to the hospital or anyone reading the Pope's documents.
867372742907219968 2017-05-24 13:32:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Father, I have followed you for 3 years, but your Tweets this morning are bordering on snarky. I don't believe I can follow you any more.
867364837826985984 2017-05-24 13:01:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Reports say she brought the rosary and asked the Pope to bless it. It must mean something to her.
867051026368671750 2017-05-23 16:14:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Right. People who quote the parable of the adulterous woman always leave out the last part, "Go, and sin no more."
867050560213716993 2017-05-23 16:12:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatt2013 @FrJoshMiller Worse than indifference. It encourages an attitude of thinking Faith means nothing, has nothing to do with society, and is pointless.
867031606321696769 2017-05-23 14:56:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatt2013 @FrJoshMiller Agree. It takes away the opportunity to practice charity toward our neighbors and turns it over to the state.
867012365954560000 2017-05-23 13:40:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Maybe it's because a lot of loyal conservative viewers see Fox moving more and more to the left. The Murdoch boys are ruining Fox News.
866834664505442304 2017-05-22 01:54:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you telling us what they are. We don't have those where I live.
866777906428735490 2017-05-22 22:08:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Who cares?
866758765063876608 2017-05-22 20:52:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC That would certainly clear out the freeway in a hurry!
866733182258905088 2017-05-22 19:11:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Oh my, that was hilarious. It had me laughing so hard my cats thought I was having some kind of attack and came over to see about me!
866730023612534785 2017-05-22 18:58:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Beautiful!
866670104410542081 2017-05-22 15:00:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Exactly, which is why all the separation of everything from phone menus to graduations and proms is wrong.
866668860539371522 2017-05-22 14:55:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin @JammieWF Oh that is rich.  Hypocrisy all in one sentence.
866668460365029376 2017-05-22 14:53:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @hopiwmn @RHolton1 Oh, that's perfect!  Love it.
866657463277367296 2017-05-22 14:10:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @RHolton1 @HellgateOsprey @hopiwmn Yes, I know. The circle of life.
866657357031501828 2017-05-22 14:09:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @RichmondOutside Thank you!  It's a shame so few can ruin it for everyone else.
866431241305944064 2017-05-21 23:11:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @NotreDame As a Catholic, I was ashamed of the discourtesy shown VP Pence today. Charity and good manners would have been better.
866407617568133120 2017-05-21 21:37:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I think we should just call it "lunch", LOL!
866406687686750208 2017-05-21 21:33:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Oh, I don't fish either except at the freezer section of the grocery store. I love seeing the information. I'm going with whitefish.
866404994777579520 2017-05-21 21:27:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods For liberals, free speech is only for people they agree with. Hence, all the college demonstrations, protests, and walking out of speeches.
866404697879531520 2017-05-21 21:25:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey So, the whole fish Louis brought in was a whitefish?  Or, was it a sucker?  I thought it looked like the whitefish.
866396793726218240 2017-05-21 20:54:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump @hayleymorsen @DineshDSouza They don't respect weakness, but respect strength.
866396508677165061 2017-05-21 20:53:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @hayleymorsen @DineshDSouza Yeah, go figure!  They don't seem to be brainwashed by the MSM.
866395648458985472 2017-05-21 20:49:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @RHolton1 That's an "OOPS" look on the face of the fish if I ever saw one.
866393106345840641 2017-05-21 20:39:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @BrendaC02333333 Looks like a curtain rod with decorative ends.
866392609530540032 2017-05-21 20:37:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 5/21/17 2:37pm Louis just brought in a whole fish to Iris.  Nice job, buddy.
866373936732352512 2017-05-21 19:23:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @hrkbenowen But Christian kids can't say Merry Christmas or even say a prayer outside of class.
866370504554414080 2017-05-21 19:09:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @fatherkirby @FrMatthewLC @Kc8wzm The article was talking about altar servers who were playing with the spinner instead of paying attention. Kids need to learn to focus.
866361718901014528 2017-05-21 18:35:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @RVAOspreycam Could someone please do something with the obscene troll in the RVA Cam chat? This is getting out of control.
866361175461810179 2017-05-21 18:32:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @fatherkirby @FrMatthewLC It's just another tool for people who can't concentrate. Meditation requires concentration and being able to focus. This encourages opposite
866360685084762112 2017-05-21 18:30:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @RichmondOutside You have a very obscene troll in your RVA osprey chat right now. This is happening too often. Please take control of it.
866359803488194560 2017-05-21 18:27:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin These selfish people ruined a once in a lifetime experience for graduates & parents. You don't have to agree but you should be courteous.
866302653923545088 2017-05-21 14:40:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @BrendaC02333333 Louis, good job buddy with a nice breakfish for Iris. He seems to be having an easier time fishing. Hope that continues when chicks arrive.
866272878282629120 2017-05-21 12:42:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @StFrancisTX @BpOlsonFW May God bless them and keep them in the palm of His hand always.
866087028370395137 2017-05-20 00:23:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @frhumphries Thank you, Father. Perseverance is what I am working on right now. Remembering the parable of the widow and the judge.
866030839502700544 2017-05-20 20:40:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Sorry, that should have been RVA Osprey nest.
866030724029263872 2017-05-20 20:39:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I wonder where Louis gets all the strange stuff he brings into the nest. At least it's not plastic garbage bags like at the RVS Osprey nest.
866019244915527681 2017-05-20 19:54:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Is there nothing that can be left outside the social justice arena? Math really is just math: 2+2=4. Nothing nefarious, just pure numbers.
866012534217879552 2017-05-20 19:27:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I don't really have any thoughts on the matter.  Ambassador to the Vatican just seems more like a ceremonial position than a real one.
865987503450468352 2017-05-20 17:48:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @Birdgirl128 Holy cow that's a big fish.  Louis is doing himself proud bringing in those big boys.
865910248774807552 2017-05-20 12:41:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento Thank you! My husband is very patient with me just as Louis is with Iris.
865908640506675200 2017-05-20 12:34:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Before he reluctantly fought for the Confederacy, he was an honored West Pointer. Wish they would stop rewriting history.
865902656736423936 2017-05-20 12:10:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Today is my 50th wedding anniversary and I just wanted to wish Iris and Louis the equivalent in bird years.
865652829289037826 2017-05-19 19:38:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @frhumphries Since we are in the presence of God, we should approach the Mass with deepest reverence instead of casual nonchalance.
865638645331443714 2017-05-19 18:41:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @Flamingomojo Isn't it between May 31 - June 7 for the first egg?  I can't remember exactly but those dates seem to sound familiar.
865637921428197376 2017-05-19 18:38:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest This is the correct judgment in this case. Thank goodness there is still a judge that goes by just the facts and the law.
865585856031182849 2017-05-19 15:12:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic @ShaftonP @jmomahony I got the title wrong. It's "Uniformity with God"s Will". Amazon has the Kindle version coupled w/another great one for $.99.
865562516776247296 2017-05-19 13:39:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic @ShaftonP @jmomahony A very short but excellent brochure by St. Alphonsus is called "Uniformity with the Will of God".  It was my first introduction to him.
865562102987141120 2017-05-19 13:37:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @MrJoshuaRogers Thank you.  It's because my husband is so patient and nice to me.
865548414087380993 2017-05-19 12:43:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @MrJoshuaRogers Congratulations to your friend. My husband and I will celebrate our 50th anniversary tomorrow.
865545657926406145 2017-05-19 12:32:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @jmomahony @ahebrewcatholic @ShaftonP St. Alphonsus is great! I read his works all the time for spiritual direction.
865545002176233473 2017-05-19 12:29:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @CBS11JeffJam It's OK, Jeff.
865384117738844161 2017-05-18 01:50:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @ConnieHarbuck1 Just block them all. I don't give them more than one hateful comment before I block them. I'm on here to have conversations, not fight.
865382984001740800 2017-05-18 01:45:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @ConnieHarbuck1 I am so sorry. I don't understand the level of anger and intolerance that is shown by liberals toward anyone who has a different opinion.
865323343771250689 2017-05-18 21:48:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain Here's a novel idea. How about Republicans stand up FOR Trump and this administration for a change.
865323175328059397 2017-05-18 21:48:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump So why did your DOJ cave in and appoint one???
865323071590330370 2017-05-18 21:47:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @PrisonPlanet Nice, now that the DOJ caved and appointed a special prosecutor.  What's he going to investigate if there is no evidence??
865322796569833477 2017-05-18 21:46:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @POTUS @KellyannePolls If Trump picks Liberman for FBI director, you can kiss your support goodbye. He's a Hillary supporter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
865322489219608576 2017-05-18 21:45:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic We had a similar problem with Frontier Communications.
865322062524624896 2017-05-18 21:43:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest This will be last straw for me. I didn't vote for Trump so he could have his admin filled with Obama/Hillary friends.
865321614673670144 2017-05-18 21:42:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @RVAOspreycam The chat next to your camera feed has been taken over by trolls. Mods need to do something or no one else will chat.
865308543297171456 2017-05-18 20:50:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @DiamondandSilk Best news all day!
865268240460783617 2017-05-18 18:09:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @flamingoart Smart women know that the word "man" is sometimes used to denote mankind and are not raving feminists who insist on inclusive language.
865253577681514497 2017-05-18 17:11:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @west820 We don't know conditions/if other raptors are fishing at pond. Louis is not ignoring Iris. He's doing great under difficult circumstances.
865252145305706496 2017-05-18 17:06:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain I demand a special prosecutor!  What are the chances we get one???
865226327816888320 2017-05-18 15:23:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @chessplayer4 He had an injury under his left wing, but it looks like it is mostly healed. He was missing for 28+ hours and there was concern.
865202162137223168 2017-05-18 13:47:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 5/18/17 7:47am Snow is gone and now we have this stupid stick blocking lovely Iris's face. #hellgateospreypic.twitter.com/sAE1flw64W
865190766452330497 2017-05-18 13:02:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Louis is doing a spectacular job! Injured and with terrible fishing conditions, he is bringing in fish. And he will only get better.
865061070284738560 2017-05-17 04:26:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @RorateCaeli @MCITLFrAphorism @willcall1985 @mamreilly Sorry, I must retire for the night. It's been an interesting discussion.  God bless you.
865060608886149122 2017-05-17 04:24:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @RorateCaeli @MCITLFrAphorism @willcall1985 @mamreilly The problem is that people are not taught why they are at Mass. There is no catechesis. That is not the fault of the rite.
865060146862600192 2017-05-17 04:23:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @RorateCaeli @MCITLFrAphorism @willcall1985 @mamreilly The Cistercian Monastery here is wonderful but I have a chronic health issue that prevents me from going that far anymore.
865057777550602241 2017-05-17 04:13:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @RorateCaeli @MCITLFrAphorism @willcall1985 @mamreilly I get it. I have been to many EF Masses past and present (FSSP). Some proponents of the EF do question the validity of the OF.
865055365997748224 2017-05-17 04:04:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @RorateCaeli @MCITLFrAphorism @willcall1985 @mamreilly So? The Church has given us two forms for saying the Mass. In both, the host is validly consecrated. One is does not do it more validly.
865050585686560769 2017-05-17 03:45:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @RorateCaeli @MCITLFrAphorism @willcall1985 @CMBCOOL01 @mamreilly 2)When it was the only form used, there were many priests who ran through it on automatic. Now it's uncommon/special to priest & laity.
865049769718231041 2017-05-17 03:41:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @RorateCaeli @MCITLFrAphorism @willcall1985 @CMBCOOL01 @mamreilly 1)If anything is done without thinking, it will be done badly. The EF is reverent because it hasn't become routine. Priests are engaged.
864995811272294401 2017-05-17 00:07:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @RorateCaeli @MCITLFrAphorism @willcall1985 @CMBCOOL01 @mamreilly I know that. Secondary but acknowledged as present. I fully agree with your last sentence. You are preaching to the choir.
864992294247813120 2017-05-17 23:53:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Oh, OK. I thought there was something wrong with the sound on my tablet.
864991678180061186 2017-05-17 23:51:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Can we hear what Dr. Greene is saying to the tour group?
864987816031391744 2017-05-17 23:35:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @RorateCaeli @MCITLFrAphorism @willcall1985 @CMBCOOL01 @mamreilly 3) And I am 71 yrs. old and only knew the EF for many years. I saw it hurried up and done in a mechanical way w/people as an afterthought.
864986949773295620 2017-05-17 23:32:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @RorateCaeli @MCITLFrAphorism @willcall1985 @CMBCOOL01 @mamreilly 2) The NO can be celebrated reverently and beautifully. The EF does not hold exclusive license on that. There are good points to both.
864985992981348354 2017-05-17 23:28:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @RorateCaeli @MCITLFrAphorism @willcall1985 @CMBCOOL01 @mamreilly 1) I don"t disagree. But there are some who will not accept the OF and only think the EF is valid. I believe both are valid.
864966965231833088 2017-05-17 22:12:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism They don't HAVE to do them, but they can be done. I've been at Novus Ordo with Latin & Communion rail. It's not either/or for both forms
864958370826117120 2017-05-17 21:38:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @RorateCaeli @MCITLFrAphorism @willcall1985 @CMBCOOL01 I appreciate both forms, but I don't second guess the Magisterium. I believe in the authority of the Church outweighs my own preferences.
864953433018839040 2017-05-17 21:19:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @RorateCaeli @MCITLFrAphorism @willcall1985 The Novus Ordo can be beautiful when said properly. Watch EWTN Sunday Mass.
864951320914124800 2017-05-17 21:10:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Iris and Louis are two persevering ospreys. Their chicks should be ready for the world since they come from tough stock.
864950843350581248 2017-05-17 21:08:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @LifeZette @IngrahamAngle Two #RINOsaurs that need to be gone. They are nothing but egocentric obstructionists.
864950217120108544 2017-05-17 21:06:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle RINOs have been undermining conservatives and American people for decades. Term limits is the only way.
864926498758815744 2017-05-17 19:32:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Hope Iris is not using up more calories trying to tear that dried fish up than she is getting by eating it, LOL!
864925712016453632 2017-05-17 19:28:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Too bad Iris didn't find the rehydrated old fish sooner while she was waiting for Louis to return with a fresh fish.
864924520532017152 2017-05-17 19:24:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey That looks like fish jerky that Iris is trying to eat on the pole.
864910900993642496 2017-05-17 18:30:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods He is a #RINOsaur, should have retired a long time ago. He has a personal vendetta against Trump;doesn't care if he hurts US along the way.
864861890102669312 2017-05-17 15:15:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @brmartin91 Ahh, St. Augustine! He would have been a master at Twitter. He could say more in one sentence than most can say in a whole book.

864552203889016832 2017-05-16 18:44:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Wasn't the argument for integration that we would never be able to get along unless we lived, worked, and went to school with each other?
864536145430024192 2017-05-16 17:40:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @valtack16 Exactly. I think that's how he got injured.
864535872040992768 2017-05-16 17:39:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey With fishing being hard, competition is high. I'm sure he is facing tough river conditions and others trying to steal the fish he does get.
864534990280851456 2017-05-16 17:36:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @stancil_brook Louis is doing what he's supposed to do. He is providing for himself and Iris. When there are chicks, his job will double/triple. All is OK.
864525672240353285 2017-05-16 16:59:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @BrendaC02333333 Usually the most simple answer is right. I think it is because he's having to go farther afield to find fish.
864525145758740480 2017-05-16 16:57:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @BrendaC02333333 @HellgateOsprey @aeb4kats I don't think Louis has another nest. I think he is doing what all good males do and that is find fish for his mate, no matter how hard.
864524892250812416 2017-05-16 16:56:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @BrendaC02333333 @HellgateOsprey @aeb4kats Of course his behavior will change if the river conditions change. He will need to find fish in other places, which may be further away.
864522882675769345 2017-05-16 16:48:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @StevenErtelt If women were given correct information/ultrasounds beforehand, most would not abort. That is a beautiful picture of a beautiful child.
864522078254493698 2017-05-16 16:45:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @frhumphries @Schuess6 Your facts are not correct. I am more interested in adoring God than how long it takes. Mass is a sacrificial MIRACLE, no one said magic
864298719583367168 2017-05-15 01:57:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @dclubb25 And she's Ann Richard's daughter. That nut didn't fall far from the tree!
864223199835435009 2017-05-15 20:57:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I saw a Mobile Baptismal Pool. It was a truck with glass sides and a pool with steps inside of it. I guess it was "have truck, will baptize"
864202009670561792 2017-05-15 19:33:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @frhumphries I think that's where we are headed.
864185440882089984 2017-05-15 18:27:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I've watched eagle nests for years. They do not have the problem letting go of fish like this. Is it the barbed pads on osprey feet?
864146420290473985 2017-05-15 15:52:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @mtantiques1 Maybe the fish will still be there when the chicks hatch and she will already have food ready for their first bite.
864146023270297600 2017-05-15 15:50:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Hmmm, let me think, uh, YEAH! So what else is new.
864142411706118148 2017-05-15 15:36:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @mtantiques1 That is the fish that wouldn't quit! Talk about persistence, really, fish, just give it up.
864125190355247104 2017-05-15 14:27:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @mtantiques1 She gave it the good college try.
864122331152752640 2017-05-15 14:16:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey LOL! Iris will just have to eat the fish off of her left talon because it's not going to budge any other way.
864121849910841344 2017-05-15 14:14:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Looks like Iris is just going to eat that fish off of her left talon.  That's one way to get it off.
864121378437558272 2017-05-15 14:12:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento It's a moth, it's a plane, no it's SUPERbird Louis!  You are the best, Louis old boy. Iris is lucky to have such a wonderful mate.
863932492604166144 2017-05-14 01:42:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I just found out she is Ann Richards daughter. That says it all.
863926670637629441 2017-05-14 01:19:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Cats are very zen-like creatures. But, in this case, I would have to say very meditative!
863915168455172096 2017-05-14 00:33:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @CecileRichards Except for the millions of babies who never get the chance to live much less say "I love you" to anyone!
863914790103781380 2017-05-14 00:31:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @NARAL This is psychotic. You people kill unborn babies which prevents motherhood!
863906242372227073 2017-05-14 23:57:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Exactly!
863905895381704704 2017-05-14 23:56:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @BrendaC02333333 After 26 hours, I had to leave the house, figured he wasn't coming back. Checked the cam soon as I walked in at 12:15 and he was egg sitting
863902167052234752 2017-05-14 23:41:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin Well, the world has gone full tilt bat sh*t crazy. What is the point?  Beam me up, Scotty, there is no intelligent life form here!
863879836183535617 2017-05-14 22:12:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey We have always known that Louis was one of a kind, but he can just stop with those kinds of records!
863868539194810372 2017-05-14 21:28:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @andrewklavan Thank you. As a mother and grandmother, it is truly a vocation and a gift to be able to raise children to be responsible caring adults.
863847970256695296 2017-05-14 20:06:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @SavannahNest @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento I just saw that.  I had hoped it would have survived, but it was not to be.
863847503258583040 2017-05-14 20:04:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Happy Mother's Day to your Mom, Father.  She raised a great son.
863837725258125312 2017-05-14 19:25:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you. We are watching ospreys not people who want to be noticed.
863837077951172613 2017-05-14 19:23:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @SavannahNest Has it been determined if the chick survived?  I don't see it anywhere.
863825695306375170 2017-05-14 18:37:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @CatholicNewsSvc I'm glad he said that. They need to put an end to this.  It has gone on too long.
863824887810584580 2017-05-14 18:34:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @hopiwmn There was an intruder at the nest and they think the chick got injured. The info said the chick is not responding to feeding attempts.
863824043962753026 2017-05-14 18:31:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Iris, give him a break!  He's been working all night to get you that fish.
863823545092190210 2017-05-14 18:29:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey WOOHOO! I had just come home and saw him on the nest and couldn't believe my eyes.  What a spectacular bird he is!
863820435066155009 2017-05-14 18:16:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 5/14/17 12:16pm Isn't this Louis??pic.twitter.com/LIuCUZfyMd
863819120088895488 2017-05-14 18:11:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Is that Louis on the nest at 12:11pm? It sure looks like him but I didn't see any announcements.  Just got back home.
863781514965921793 2017-05-14 15:42:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @08balet80 @cukilcline I think it was around 8:00am Saturday, yesterday.
863774566660886529 2017-05-14 15:14:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @Caygrl3 That is good info. Thanks for sharing that.
863774241120034816 2017-05-14 15:13:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @feathersong They think the chick was injured when an intruder attacked the nest. The info said the chick was not responding to feeding attempts.
863764311373733888 2017-05-14 14:33:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Not a good year for ospreys, with bad news at both Chesapeake and Savannah nests. Hoping Louis returns & things turn out OK.
863584778263592960 2017-05-13 02:40:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you.
863583547348668416 2017-05-13 02:35:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey At some point, will Dr. Greene send out a search party, so to speak, for Louis?
863583290653126656 2017-05-13 02:34:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @col_carling May the Lord bless you and your husband.
863557442050940929 2017-05-13 00:51:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @frhumphries Fabulous article. I was beginning to wonder if anyone felt the way I do and this article confirms that others do!
863522895200481281 2017-05-13 22:34:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @BrendaC02333333 Maybe with the river running so fast Louis has to go farther to find fish. Hopefully we will see him before nightfall.
863451423945748480 2017-05-13 17:50:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @StFrancisTX He is in my daily prayers. Thank you for your service to our parish and the Church, Fr. Flynn.
863450559109627904 2017-05-13 17:47:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods You are sharp as a tack, Mr. Woods. Too bad your observations go over the heads of most libs.
863438288908148737 2017-05-13 16:58:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you so much, Dr. Greene.  I know you will keep a close eye on our special guy, Louis.
863391334073323520 2017-05-13 13:51:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey It looked like there was a bare spot on the base of Louis's neck also.  Same side as his injury under his wing.
863207154802724864 2017-05-12 01:39:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey As long as he is flying well, I believe it's not as serious as it looks. Maybe it's just a surface wound.
863197484394401792 2017-05-12 01:01:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Oh dear, that is not just a scratch.
863106150560038912 2017-05-12 18:58:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @DiamondandSilk @iammindy1 I know legal citizens commit crimes, but there are punishments for them. Illegals just get deported and come back and do it all over again.
863074794983608321 2017-05-12 16:54:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @DiamondandSilk Crimes like this one and Kate Steinle should never have happened. Both were done by illegals who had been deported multiple times. Sinful!
863050307785424896 2017-05-12 15:16:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @LHSummers Why put him in a permanent position. Just make special prosecutor for Hillary's many crimes.
863038932405170177 2017-05-12 14:31:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC A result of the feminist movement that devalued men and said women could do it all, men were the enemy. Same time SAHM were devalued.
862699982331273216 2017-05-11 16:04:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Economic gains for who? The mom or the country? Life is stressful for everyone. Support SAHMs and tell them what they are doing is valuable.
862691830042943490 2017-05-11 15:32:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Same argument that was used in the '70's to shame SAHM, but different premise. Then it was betrayal of the sisterhood, now it's the economy.
862691593714888704 2017-05-11 15:31:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC The primary role of the parent is taking care of the child. SAHM should be praised for their sacrifices & devotion to their children/home.
862688549052788736 2017-05-11 15:19:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Gowdy is great as a prosecutor but I think Clarke has the law enforcement background required. I love both.
862688076749041664 2017-05-11 15:17:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @toddstarnes There is no basis in reality for this to keep happening. Deportation should be a one time event!
862686844974231552 2017-05-11 15:12:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @frhumphries That's right. The road to follow Christ ends at Calvary not a cushy spa.
862498000849043456 2017-05-10 02:42:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @AdamsNeilan You're welcome.
862497698909499394 2017-05-10 02:40:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @AdamsNeilan St. Thomas of Aquinas explains this in the Summa, Question 66, Article 11
862497540427698176 2017-05-10 02:40:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @AdamsNeilan Baptism of desire & Baptism of blood are accepted by the Catholic Church as giving the fruits of Baptism but not being a sacrament.
862469134700773379 2017-05-10 00:47:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Baptism of desire & Baptism of blood are accepted by the Catholic Church as giving the fruits of Baptism but not being a sacrament.
862466175187525632 2017-05-10 00:35:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @RHolton1 @mtantiques1 That was supposed to be "nest" and eggs.
862465442677493760 2017-05-10 00:32:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you for that very informative lesson!
862465110362775552 2017-05-10 00:31:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @RHolton1 @mtantiques1 I agree. If there was an intruder he would protect the best and eggs.
862381612931190784 2017-05-10 18:59:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @BrendaC02333333 @HellgateOsprey @mtantiques1 I think so, too.  I have noticed that she much calmer and more relaxed this year. And, is not chirping constantly.
862361267545276431 2017-05-10 17:38:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @BrendaC02333333 Actually, I thought Louis looked bigger this year, LOL!
862360966037733377 2017-05-10 17:37:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @FrankDagostino1 Yes. Pastors, as well as Bishops, must lead and that means correcting behavior and faulty understanding. People can't learn unless taught.
862360585299787781 2017-05-10 17:36:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @FrankDagostino1 Our pastor won't either. And they wonder why there is no reverence or understanding of the Eucharist.
862359236998836226 2017-05-10 17:30:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @SavannahNest Is it likely that either of the other eggs will hatch?
862352950152364033 2017-05-10 17:05:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @brhodes Since when?????
862348678446579713 2017-05-10 16:48:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @FrankDagostino1 I know. The K of C leads the rosary 30 min before Mass and people are still talking so loud we cannot hear the person leading the rosary.
862334903526019076 2017-05-10 15:53:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Yes, and that is one too many.
862333922130178048 2017-05-10 15:50:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I will never understand anyone approving of this situation. Someone should never need to be deported more than one time!
862313791731761154 2017-05-10 14:30:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Oh, please, just one moment of sweet silence would be so welcome.
862092518049148928 2017-05-09 23:50:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Absolutely beautiful photo! Louis is stunning and so regal on his perch! Thank you, Dorothy, for sharing it.
862058814547382272 2017-05-09 21:36:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you!!
862047490639634437 2017-05-09 20:51:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey What is is called when ospreys wipe/scrape their beaks on a limb?  The work starts with an "f" but I can't remember it.
862038690129993728 2017-05-09 20:16:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW That does not address the lack of belief in the Real Presence. Those are the real "lost sheep' that no one is paying attention to.
862011099906019328 2017-05-09 18:27:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Exactly, and active participation in the Mass doesn't mean we all have to have a job on the altar!
862010640357085184 2017-05-09 18:25:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Sr. Loretta was mine. And, she was one of the few teachers at the school that didn't call me by my older sister's name!
862009835562381313 2017-05-09 18:22:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @brmartin91 Was this picture taken in Rome?
861968020096385025 2017-05-09 15:36:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @DiamondandSilk I don't watch The View, I don't like any of the people on there, and I don't care if she leaves or not. She's a screaming liberal.
861966686819418117 2017-05-09 15:30:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Parents know that, sometimes, tough love is the only way to get their children back on the right track.
861965359687008256 2017-05-09 15:25:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW I wish the bishops were as concerned with 70% of U.S. Catholics that don't believe in the Real Presence as they are with immigration.
861962452505944064 2017-05-09 15:13:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest I am just speechless!
861722966270377984 2017-05-08 23:22:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic @LadyLSpeaks @hangrycentipede SSPX follower?
861718274135994368 2017-05-08 23:03:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @LadyLSpeaks @ahebrewcatholic Agreed!
861718179072151555 2017-05-08 23:03:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic LOL, yes, but Macron said there was no such thing as French culture, so who are we to argue?
861669871284891648 2017-05-08 19:51:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @LadyLSpeaks @ahebrewcatholic Yes, I noticed that.
861646038184194049 2017-05-08 18:16:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @west820 I agree to a point. Sometimes we tend to imprint our own feelings on the birds. That's all I'm saying.
861640828523081728 2017-05-08 17:55:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @west820 I understand what you are saying, but animals don't dwell on the past and applying human emotions to them is unproductive, IMHO.
861640187532763139 2017-05-08 17:53:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @west820 I understand.
861640064664776704 2017-05-08 17:52:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic @LadyLSpeaks Have you read all the VII documents yourself? Or are you regurgitating someone else's slanted viewpoint?
861638515410579457 2017-05-08 17:46:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic @LadyLSpeaks Your language is offensive and No, I wouldn't agree with your statement.
861638169292308481 2017-05-08 17:45:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic @LadyLSpeaks Fighting modernism is not new with "traditionals". I was born in 1946, long before VII. Declaring VII heretical is a narrow schismatic view.
861635579120934913 2017-05-08 17:35:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @bartmckinley @ahebrewcatholic Good one!
861634409971298306 2017-05-08 17:30:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic @LadyLSpeaks I am astonished by this reply to a valid question. I wonder if you actually lived prior to Vatican II or read the documents?
861629205251010561 2017-05-08 17:09:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @west820 I don't think that was last year, since Stanley didn't return last year. But, none of the 5 eggs laid last year hatched.
861617782928101376 2017-05-08 16:24:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Iris really seems so much calmer this year than last year. I think she is confident in Louis and can settle down.
861617635762601984 2017-05-08 16:23:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I am so thankful for mods/camops at this nest and Dr. Greene and expert info. Also for keeping nest free of twine, etc.
861616974484447233 2017-05-08 16:21:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I don't expect a retweet, but I just can't watch the RVA osprey babies laying on that plastic bag/putting their faces on it.
861615110690938880 2017-05-08 16:13:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily I say the St. Michael prayer daily, plus "Angels of heaven, drive from me all that would harm me. Stand by me always and keep me safe."
861597167617748993 2017-05-08 15:02:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Well, at least she is consistent - consistently delusional.
861596312374050819 2017-05-08 14:59:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @NancyPelosi @CatholicLeague Her definition of Pro-Life is defective anyway. Her definition means saying pro-life and supporting abortion. No thank you!
861596029925371905 2017-05-08 14:57:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @DeptofDefense Thank you to all who sacrificed to save Europe only to have it taken over by Islam without a fight.
861554311905636352 2017-05-08 12:12:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I guess I can now buy champagne where the grapes are grown anywhere in the world???
861355082499190784 2017-05-07 23:00:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @larkberly @mtantiques1 I have seen both male & female ospreys, and also eagles, do it.
861352296449540097 2017-05-07 22:49:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Fr. James Martin's utterances are a challenge to refrain from being judgmental with him. With utmost charity I can only ask God to help him.
861351167078658048 2017-05-07 22:44:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Nothing good has come out of France since Joan of Arc.
861301459153031169 2017-05-07 19:27:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Isn't pro-life Democrat an oxymoron?
861284271088074752 2017-05-07 18:19:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @STcom Well, that's a shame.
861284154188713985 2017-05-07 18:18:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @brmartin91 ?
861283827632812034 2017-05-07 18:17:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Only if those receiving Him are receiving Him worthily and not in a sinful state. Some only stroll up to receive through habit, not love.
861282776775094272 2017-05-07 18:13:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @brmartin91 Perhaps our Pope could spend some energy on these serious issues within the Church instead of always social justice, climate, etc.
861281609085046785 2017-05-07 18:08:32 UTC <alclubb1967> Louis just really likes to sit on his eggs.  I believe he thinks brooding the eggs is less work than doing all the fishing, LOL!
861234203081543680 2017-05-07 15:00:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump Why would they start doing the right thing now when they have let us down every time we count on them. Just drain the swamp!
861233465382936576 2017-05-07 14:57:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC As parents know, it's called tough love to do what is right for your kids, not what is easy. It is not merciful to enable harmful behaviors.
860945695557259266 2017-05-06 19:53:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @legacyartsstudi @SilasHodgson That's it. A sense of earnestness!
860945251221086209 2017-05-06 19:51:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Haven't seen many Democrats quoting Scripture to support abortion.
860937763209838592 2017-05-06 19:22:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @CNN @RealJamesWoods Interesting that almost all of the verified purchased reviews on Amazon are 5 star. All the 1 star have not purchased the book.
860907104139456513 2017-05-06 17:20:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Lovely!  If all of these gorgeous flowers/plants on at your house, you have some wonderful scenery.
860906914452033537 2017-05-06 17:19:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods #CatherineHerridge is great. I think she is very honest and is actually doing her job, unlike all the other so called journalist.
860906475413221376 2017-05-06 17:17:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I'm going with gardener, LOL!
860905759202324482 2017-05-06 17:15:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Excellent!
860904975714721794 2017-05-06 17:11:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I think Louis wants to be a Mr. Mom!
860904370648604673 2017-05-06 17:09:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Why isn't the lawsuit about his meddling in US politics. He funds every liberal cause and protest.
860904052925837312 2017-05-06 17:08:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods But the MSM will fight to the death over their freedom of press.  They just don't use it for the truth.
860903612272324610 2017-05-06 17:06:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Those people will say anything if they think they can get one more vote!
860890254169042946 2017-05-06 16:13:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Here's a pair of doves on my patio who are trying to nest on a narrow ledge instead of the nesting box. I & L are smarter.pic.twitter.com/Rd3cd6fIsj
860660368624033794 2017-05-05 00:59:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Looks like it's going to be rainy for the near future with wind and possible hail. Hopefully the forecast is overstating things a bit.
860657397475495936 2017-05-05 00:48:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Holy cow! What was the speed of those wind gusts!
860654364540764160 2017-05-05 00:36:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Is there a storm at Hellgate? Please tell me there is no hail in the forecast 
860630173523341312 2017-05-05 22:59:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey It is hard to watch but nature is fascinating in the way things work. Survival is the number one priority.
860629634437853184 2017-05-05 22:57:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @Gmomof10 I thought it was an osprey also because of the bent wings. But, I am the world's worst at stuff like this.
860594010242633728 2017-05-05 20:36:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @FrankDagostino1 I don't know, but he keeps using it when he is referring to people he thinks are not being merciful enough or not being open to new ideas.
860530742606082048 2017-05-05 16:24:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey How much time difference is there between the first egg and the fourth?
860530438758178816 2017-05-05 16:23:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism This Pope has used the word "rigid" more than any other person. Anyone who refuses to meet with Card. Burke, etc. could be called rigid too.
860530129885425664 2017-05-05 16:22:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Agree. But, there are also some who reject anything after 1962.
860525172432007168 2017-05-05 16:02:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @DiamondandSilk Please don't insult cats by including them in her dishonesty. Cats are very honest creatures unlike this woman and all her lib friends.
860524756654837760 2017-05-05 16:01:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Rigid is someone who won't consider another view. This pope uses the word so much, maybe he doesn't want to listen to any other view point.
860523081143595009 2017-05-05 15:54:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey How exciting! This is going to be a fabulous year, I think. From the fact that Louis arrived first and everything seems to be going so well.
860504557876637696 2017-05-05 14:40:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism If rigid means holding firm to your beliefs and the teachings of the Church, then call me rigid. I would rather be rigid than lukewarm.
860267348946804736 2017-05-04 22:58:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @SavannahNest That look is saying, "I'm NOT ready for my close up, Mr. De Mille."  LOL!
860181462099922946 2017-05-04 17:16:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey On an owl nest I was watching, they said what looked like panting was called gular fluttering. Is that for ospreys too?
860180343374176258 2017-05-04 17:12:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @08balet80 Speaking for all of us here in the South, there are occasions when we ALL pant from the heat, LOL!
860169597898633217 2017-05-04 16:29:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @SavannahNest When do you expect a pip in the eggs?
860169283866906625 2017-05-04 16:28:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX Texas is leading in so many areas from cyberbullying to outlawing sanctuary cities. Texas is showing the rest of the U.S. how it's done.
860157187213193219 2017-05-04 15:40:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Look at this picture. It says everything about why we are at Mass - to worship God, not each other. Priest facing the people says opposite.
860156127551664128 2017-05-04 15:36:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @EmmausBooks Thank you!  I've bookmarked your site.
860156027517403136 2017-05-04 15:35:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @EmmausBooks @alclubb1967 @FrMatthewLC
860152301041983488 2017-05-04 15:21:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @EmmausBooks Never mind, I just found the link to purchase it on http://Amazon.com.
860151745598672896 2017-05-04 15:18:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @EmmausBooks Where can I order a copy?  I'd like to send one to our bishop and our pastor.
860133833580191745 2017-05-04 14:07:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics Hmmm, I consider that foreign interference in an election!  But good news for Le Pen.
860108901508894720 2017-05-04 12:28:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism St. Augustine had such tender words for his mother in his Confessions. Such humility from a great saint about his mother, a great saint.
859920288737349632 2017-05-03 23:59:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @RHolton1 Is that a new yoga position or wrestling move, LOL!
859909643803480066 2017-05-03 23:16:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @MrJoshuaRogers Great article, but if I had seen that I would certainly not laughed, but would have told that woman to treat her child with some respect.
859909047214125056 2017-05-03 23:14:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Wow, at least they said it out loud. Really, somebody actually had to say it? Why don't these people just start their own heretical church.
859908747770167297 2017-05-03 23:13:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Mr. Woods, you are just a genius at getting the most out of 140 characters.
859908560637001728 2017-05-03 23:12:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin @thehill So subpoena her and let her take the 5th a billion times.
859908095878803457 2017-05-03 23:10:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I can't stop laughing at this one. This takes the prize as the stupidest tweet by a liberal this week - there are so many to choose from.
859831914898829313 2017-05-03 18:07:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey No problem, I should have clarified what I was asking about. Twitter has too many limitations.
859826718839902209 2017-05-03 17:47:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey By the way, I was asking about current parking lot, not the one in the pics from last year.
859820982227357697 2017-05-03 17:24:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Sorry. I didn't realize this was not the time to ask other questions.
859817825954934784 2017-05-03 17:11:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Are they still doing work on the parking lot? What is that stuff that looks like hay wrapped with mesh?
859797139106521092 2017-05-03 15:49:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @frjohnhollowell Isn't that a sad fact, but I personally had encounters in the '70's with same type of nun. A blessing in disguise. Woke me up!
859781636342329345 2017-05-03 14:48:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Following Jesus leads to Calvary and the cross. No Resurrection without Crucifixion. He said "Take up your cross DAILY and follow Me."
859781025467174915 2017-05-03 14:45:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @RadgrannyKs @justanavywife @ahebrewcatholic OK, thanks for the update. I guess there is no way to anticipate stupid from the liberals.
859778012606234625 2017-05-03 14:33:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @tpdeod32 @Conservatexian @ahebrewcatholic He is my governor and I am so proud of him and proud to be a Texan.
859750742671978497 2017-05-03 12:45:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @RadgrannyKs @justanavywife @ahebrewcatholic Exactly! It's been scientifically proven that life begins at conception with baby having separate DNA from the mother. New life, new human.
859577957760864256 2017-05-02 01:18:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @08balet80 It interesting to see eagles or hawks pluck the feathers off of birds they catch.
859569941426601984 2017-05-02 00:46:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism He is a gorgeous cat. He looks like a Maine Coon breed of cat.
859565307723227137 2017-05-02 00:28:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism That looks like some really good and rich soil.
859547346698473472 2017-05-02 23:17:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Woohoo! Great news.
859547095761641472 2017-05-02 23:16:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @brmartin91 @EyeOfTheTiber @Jeff99217 Thanks, but it just as well be true!
859516290507165696 2017-05-02 21:13:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Yes, nature sometimes is harsh but chicks have to be strong enough to survive on their own.
859514825382268928 2017-05-02 21:07:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey That would be great so that there is not so much difference in age from egg 1 and egg 3.
859512207784255489 2017-05-02 20:57:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you for that information. I know eagles and ospreys are different, just didn't know if some ospreys delay incubation to stagger hatch.
859507035838308354 2017-05-02 20:37:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain So far, Gorsuch has been the only victory for Conservatives.
859506509314752512 2017-05-02 20:34:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I was glad to hear Dr. Greene say that Louis has equaled Stan's fishing prowess and that Louis has turned into a wonderful mate for Iris.
859506242892517376 2017-05-02 20:33:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Is there a way to delay hatching so they hatch closer together?  Seems like some eagle nests I've watched has been that way.
859505662233104384 2017-05-02 20:31:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest That's what class looks like!
859505233164152833 2017-05-02 20:29:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily That is a contradiction in terms. You can support women WITHOUT supporting abortion. You can't be Catholic and support abortion.
859504670099767298 2017-05-02 20:27:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism God bless you, Father. Thank you for being a faithful priest.
859478512935239680 2017-05-02 18:43:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @brmartin91 @EyeOfTheTiber Is this for real?  Certainly it's a joke.
859475257299787777 2017-05-02 18:30:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I was pronouncing it "Lew-iss" instead of "Lew-ee". Good to know.
859474971575373825 2017-05-02 18:29:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you to Dr. Greene and everyone involved in the Q & A. I'm glad to know how to pronounce Louis's name!
859403622353948674 2017-05-02 13:46:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump I'm tired of hearing "next time".
859390810546110469 2017-05-02 12:55:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @dclubb25 @marklevinshow He is on target and he laid it out exactly right. This was the last straw for me.
859390306877407233 2017-05-02 12:53:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Louis needs a perch like Hal has at Dunrovin.  He knows he needs to be close to watch over the nest. Seems like an obvious place.
859389925942321153 2017-05-02 12:51:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @georgesoros @RealJamesWoods Yes, actually he is and so are all his minions.
859389583297064962 2017-05-02 12:50:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism I pray to him every day. He is part of my A-Team saints (St. Anne, St. Alphonsus, St. Anthony, St. Augustine, St. Ambrose, St. Athanasius)
859227909063667712 2017-05-01 02:07:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Same story we always get: just wait until next time. It's embarrassing we are in power & still won't do anything. They don't want change.
859148113491238913 2017-05-01 20:50:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey This may have already been answered but is there a fence around the nest area to keep people from getting too close?
859100177591881729 2017-05-01 17:40:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey It seems like Iris is not so chirpy this year.  She seems more content and at ease.
859095485847662592 2017-05-01 17:21:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @POTUS @KellyannePolls @Reince45 What happened with this budget? Why did we vote for you if this is what we are going to get? Fix it!
859072458489552896 2017-05-01 15:50:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @JohnLAllenJr @Pontifex @FrMatthewLC This Pope can be clear when he chooses.  Wish he was that clear on issues within the Church regarding divorce/remarried/HolyEucharist.
859062071199232002 2017-05-01 15:08:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin I am very disappointed in this stupid RINO bill. Don't they know they are in power? Trump needs to remember Bush41's "no new taxes" fail.
859059704072425473 2017-05-01 14:59:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @EmmausBooks @FrMatthewLC With all due respect, Fr. Matthew, until the Pope comes out and definitively clarifies the confusing parts, none of these matter.
859059340191432704 2017-05-01 14:58:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Wow, thank you.  I could really see both eggs quite plainly.
858856666846167041 2017-04-30 01:32:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento OK, then I guess I did see both of them, LOL!  I was just so excited to see ANY eggs that I misread what I was seeing.
858856015009329153 2017-04-30 01:30:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento I thought the one in front was the same one that rolled, but then I really couldn't see very much.
858855246675795968 2017-04-30 01:27:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento I saw the same thing but couldn't see both eggs.
858802086674407424 2017-04-30 21:55:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @dgfazzer Yes, the liturgy definitely, but in my parish I might as well be listening to the local rock station or Christian pop.
858788521015992321 2017-04-30 21:01:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @roseon3rdday @Cdn_Catechist @testisfidelis @disciple96 @sistervpaul_ @chooseliferacr @carljoe812 @jamesrgoodman @roseOyuma @AwakeDeborah @USCCB @Pontifex @ToupsFamily @biz_eMom So inspiring. Gregorian chant should be the most used music in the Latin rite. All the stuff we have now is profane.
858783353549586433 2017-04-30 20:41:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @betkhy Isn't Louis just the best! So much improved from his first year.
858778922644905986 2017-04-30 20:23:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Agree completely.
858769618634235904 2017-04-30 19:46:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @PPact @MCITLFrAphorism The evils of our society personified.
858767486388510721 2017-04-30 19:38:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @_Makada_ @ahebrewcatholic Gives new meaning to the term "snowflake".
858757977083400193 2017-04-30 19:00:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I mean, in comparison to the size of the birds. Eagle nests seem to have much more space surrounding the nest bowl than osprey nests.
858757809315491840 2017-04-30 18:59:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I have noticed that a lot of osprey nests seem to be much smaller than BE nests. Is that typical?
858757212092682240 2017-04-30 18:57:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @FrankDagostino1 Here is an excellent Catholic book on struggles with Satan:  The Deceiver: Our Daily Struggle with Satan by Livio Fanzaga
858756211075842050 2017-04-30 18:53:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX I'm in full support, Governor. Proud to be a Texas, proud that you are our Governor. You are common sense in a world full of foolishness.
858755274957520896 2017-04-30 18:49:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @FrankDagostino1 I have chronic vertigo& don't get out much . The local Cistercian monks are very good for spiritual advice. Parish priest was useless.
858736252522246144 2017-04-30 17:34:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @FrankDagostino1 I guess she didn't believe in the Hypostatic Union.
858734978603130885 2017-04-30 17:29:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @FrankDagostino1 That's exactly what she said. That He didn't know He was the Son of God until after the Resurrection. I nailed her on it.
858734764613881857 2017-04-30 17:28:17 UTC <alclubb1967> Is it my imagination or does Iris seem less chatty this year. She seems more content and peaceful.
858734427014352896 2017-04-30 17:26:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I wish one of them would break off the part of that branch that is sticking up right in Iris's face.
858732937499611136 2017-04-30 17:21:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @RorateCaeli Oh, what I wouldn't give for a St. Catherine of Siena today. We need her badly. I fear bad advice is the only one being taken at the Vatican
858732710776496129 2017-04-30 17:20:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @NotKennyRogers LOL, oh, I love it when the mindlessness of the left is pointed out so brilliantly!
858732192800919552 2017-04-30 17:18:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @FrankDagostino1 You are wise. Out of a class of 45 people, I was the only one who told a nun she was a heretic when she said Jesus didn't know who He was.
858725853978644480 2017-04-30 16:52:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Facebook and I don't get along. The way everything pops up randomly from people I don't even follow bothers my logical Vulcan mind.
858720202938355712 2017-04-30 16:30:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods And we are not relevant either.
858720024655273990 2017-04-30 16:29:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Google would have to wait until pigs fly before I would give them anything like that.  How insane that they would even ask!
858697787470487553 2017-04-30 15:01:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Our Bishop basically said that we agree with border control and no sanctuary cities that we are bad Catholics.
858697458838368257 2017-04-30 15:00:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Yes,US needs to set English as the official language. We have ESL free classes at my parish and most schools.
858688133453500416 2017-04-30 14:22:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Those are already available. I'm saying they are taking advantage of the PC culture that insists everything be given in their language.
858687965735907328 2017-04-30 14:22:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic I agree, but the Holy Eucharist is available. They have set up a separate parish within a parish and most are not parishioners.
858686033659088896 2017-04-30 14:14:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic We went to Mass in Latin til Vatican II. There are missals with translations to each language. It encourages non-assimilation.
858681593438904321 2017-04-30 13:57:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic 3) Instead of everyone going to the same Mass, confession, religious ed, everything is provided in Spanish, so no one ever assimilates.
858681398865121281 2017-04-30 13:56:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic 2) Everything being provided in Spanish sets up division instead of bringing people together. My parish offers everything in Spanish.
858680815764602881 2017-04-30 13:53:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic 1) I live in Texas. They are taking over every aspect of our lives  by overwhelming us with numbers and they are accommodated in every way.
858678951073513472 2017-04-30 13:46:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism 2) They got upset because the bishop wanted them to wear their habits and honor their vocation instead of being social warriors.
858678730880843776 2017-04-30 13:45:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism 1) In 1969 my mother called me to tell me that half of the nuns at the elementary/high school that I attended had left the order.
858677921602580480 2017-04-30 13:42:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @SouthLoneStar @ahebrewcatholic LOL, yes, pulled pork sandwiches sounds great!
858499270797926400 2017-04-29 01:52:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic @SouthLoneStar Oh, that is priceless. Never let a hunger strike go to waste!
858472121164550144 2017-04-29 00:04:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey #OspreyAnswers For next year, could the camera be raised and pointed so that it looks down into the nest more?
858414754737598465 2017-04-29 20:16:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @joe_nuzz @ahebrewcatholic @LjHaupt Yes, we need to defend the Truth at all times. We cannot be afraid to speak out when necessary.
858414025125900288 2017-04-29 20:13:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @LjHaupt @joe_nuzz @ahebrewcatholic Because Satan seems to be having his way in the world right now.
858408178308063233 2017-04-29 19:50:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Maybe while they are Louis proofing it, they can raise it so it will point down into the nest more. Just a thought.
858392747664965632 2017-04-29 18:49:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey How are they going to prevent him from getting up there?
858388595765374976 2017-04-29 18:32:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey So, the time is Eastern time and not Mountain time?
858385999763832832 2017-04-29 18:22:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @hayleymorsen @DineshDSouza Antifa should be labeled a terrorist group and treated accordingly. This is anarchy. @FrankDagostino1
858379421488689153 2017-04-29 17:56:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @SouthLoneStar @FrankDagostino1 It's the group that is mainly driving all the protests against conservative speakers such as at Berkeley recently. Say they are anti facism.
858371707693932544 2017-04-29 17:25:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Maybe Louis wants a perch that's closer to the nest to watch over his family. The perch at Dunrovin is very nice for the male to watch from.
858305637423484928 2017-04-29 13:03:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @brmartin91 @MCITLFrAphorism @NursGibson49 I had hoped that Cardinal Sarah was going to be the Pope after Benedict.
858295340495228928 2017-04-29 12:22:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey That nest bowl is certainly not good for us to see, but it looks great for protecting the eggs.
858098455146881025 2017-04-28 23:19:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @brmartin91 Oh, I love fountain pens.

858086909989486592 2017-04-28 22:33:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism I am tired of being told that if I support upholding the law that I am being a bad Catholic. Immigrants have a choice. Unborn babies do not.

858077990223216640 2017-04-28 21:58:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @kelly_gaye I understand. Many of us didn't know Stan and are excited about Louis. Having him always compared to Stan seems a bit unfair to  him.
858063799919812608 2017-04-28 21:02:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @BernardFischer @JeffTheLess 2) Enforcing our laws is not adversarial. Stop and frisk has helped lower crime in many places. We're not going to agree; I'm done.
858063355034173440 2017-04-28 21:00:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @BernardFischer @JeffTheLess 1) I think it's a good step to help with overall enforcement. Gives cops the tools they need, stops abuse of system by non-compliant cities.
858059735043633153 2017-04-28 20:45:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Even after hatching, if one of the parents is lost, the other one must leave the nest to hunt and survive. Chicks probably won't survive.
858059174927794176 2017-04-28 20:43:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @BernardFischer @JeffTheLess What is unclear is the idea that millions of people can come here illegally and be protected by people who are supposed to uphold the law.
858058133637406720 2017-04-28 20:39:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @kelly_gaye Every osprey is an individual in their own right. Animals do not dwell on the past. Iris has accepted Louis and  he is doing a fabulous job.
858057181031260160 2017-04-28 20:35:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @BernardFischer @JeffTheLess Yes, except sanctuary cites/entities will not cooperate with federal officers.
858057036449427456 2017-04-28 20:35:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @BernardFischer @JeffTheLess The words say we have to be welcoming to immigrants. Since this a bill for sanctuary cities, the only immigrants involved are illegals.
858028508513218561 2017-04-28 18:41:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW But sanctuary cities oppose any enforcement. Right now there is NO standard.
858025980664979456 2017-04-28 18:31:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @BernardFischer I agree 100%.
858023585990008833 2017-04-28 18:22:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics Republicans don't know how to do anything but cower to the Democrats. Even in power, they are scared and spineless.
858023209995816961 2017-04-28 18:20:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @BernardFischer If the Church wants to help, they need to help them become legal BEFORE entering the country not protecting them afterwards.
858023066995232768 2017-04-28 18:20:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @BernardFischer Muddied up definitions by using "undocumented" instead of "illegal". Big difference in fleeing for life and coming for better job.
858022776703156224 2017-04-28 18:19:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @BernardFischer Everyone deserves respect, but everyone should also respect our laws.
858018000334671873 2017-04-28 18:00:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @SandraTXAS @ahebrewcatholic Then, they need to take their culture back to their country but not impose it on us.
858017661762011136 2017-04-28 17:58:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @BernardFischer Exactly. The overwhelming tone is that we need to welcome anyone, no matter their status. Why have a need for borders if not enforcing them.
858017089004634112 2017-04-28 17:56:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW 99.9% of it has nothing to do with border security. The Card. only admits we have the right to maintain our borders but 0% on illegal entry.
858014599689515009 2017-04-28 17:46:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Mexico has not right to launch any kind of challenge to the wall that belongs to our country.
858014317303693312 2017-04-28 17:45:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW Could you please post the link to the entire statement. The one in your previous tweet must have been a partial statement.
858007919685664769 2017-04-28 17:20:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW It doesn't say anything about the borders or the immigrants' responsibility to obey our immigration laws. It told us to be welcoming.
857971481741053952 2017-04-28 14:55:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @TuckerCarlson Hasn't he heard the saying, "Fences make good neighbors"?   He is nuts.
857970487196090368 2017-04-28 14:51:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @politico_45 Be consistent in your terminology. Either pro-choice and pro-life or anti-life and anti-abortion or pro-life and pro-abortion.
857967460644990976 2017-04-28 14:39:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @BrendaC02333333 @HellgateOsprey @helenetweety I think of him more as Cary Grant, handsome but with a comical side.
857935148607733760 2017-04-28 12:30:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX @slay_the_demons I agree and nothing in my statement indicated otherwise.
857935053434892289 2017-04-28 12:30:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @TXCatholic @LegitJohn I guess you're not counting the fact that they have already broken the law by entering illegally? I am 100% in favor of legal immigration.
857764881164095490 2017-04-27 01:14:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Distortion of Vatican II for more active participation. That meant engaging our minds/hearts in the Mass, not tromping up/down the altar.
857682197658165249 2017-04-27 19:45:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @frhumphries I see difficulties and trials as God's way of giving me opportunity to practice virtue. I pray that I don't squander them.
857662103951474689 2017-04-27 18:25:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic How about reassign them to Syria!
857661687096365057 2017-04-27 18:24:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Agree completely. They are encouraging anarchy.
857659096744554496 2017-04-27 18:13:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW With all due respect, Bishop, legal immigrants are welcome. Coming here is a privilege, shouldn't be abused by people breaking the law.
857658192914001920 2017-04-27 18:10:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW That article is obviously based on Thomas Aquinas, hence my inability to understand one word of it, LOL!. Give me St. Augustine any time.
857630625788043264 2017-04-27 16:20:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @TXCatholic You would prefer a crime of violence be committed first? Tell Kate Steinle's parents and other similar parents who have lost their children.
857628447186800641 2017-04-27 16:12:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @realMichael_H Great idea!
857622366800707584 2017-04-27 15:48:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @AnnCoulter @RealJamesWoods I agree. What's the answer, Mr. Woods. When law enforcement does nothing, we are in full blown anarchy.
857567355932639233 2017-04-27 12:09:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX @john_merion Right. Either you accept our laws, assimilate into our culture, or go to a country that fits more with your ideology and lifestyle.
857423280344641540 2017-04-26 02:36:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX @RiverKing_A16 Yes, but I live near a city where the Muslim community tried to get Sharia implemented by the city council as the acceptable law.
857422576125128704 2017-04-26 02:34:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @brmartin91 Oh, please come tell our pastor. The "youth" Mass has electric guitars the the music is so loud the windows actually shake.
857415156598538240 2017-04-26 02:04:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX @carl5480 I never said anything about forcing religion on anyone. You need to pay attention. Your irrationality and foul language just got you blocked
857413325839314944 2017-04-26 01:57:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX @carl5480 Freedom of religion does not mean Sharia law is acceptable. No other religion sets up a different legal system. Two separate issues.
857407994782507008 2017-04-26 01:36:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX @carl5480 That is a strawman argument. If you live in the U.S. you must accept our Constitution/laws. You don't get to set up your own legal system.
857374235018358786 2017-04-26 23:22:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX We need to outlaw Sharia law completely. There is only one law in this country!
857371008575168513 2017-04-26 23:09:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @FrankDagostino1 Yes, it's not about me.
857370644618637313 2017-04-26 23:07:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @FrankDagostino1 Thank you. That's a great way to put it. I will remember that!
857349856343584773 2017-04-26 21:45:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Louis loves to sit on his eggs!
857349666576445441 2017-04-26 21:44:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Y'all are unusually kind to us viewers  and communicate much more than on a lot of other nests.  And, I'm pretty sure you are all volunteers
857335223524233222 2017-04-26 20:47:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Have the conditions of the river changed recently? Louis was bringing in lot of fish before. Today seems pretty slim.
857315318196310016 2017-04-26 19:27:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey So we are looking at anywhere between May 31 and June 7?
857310689702137858 2017-04-26 19:09:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @Renorabbit That is the best picture of the egg so far!  Way to go, Cam Ops!
857297642329690124 2017-04-26 18:17:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Sorry I put the wrong date.  It's 4/26/17.  I was excited.
857297085628133377 2017-04-26 18:15:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey  Louis won't get off of the egg.  He won't let Iris lay down.
857292562276786179 2017-04-26 17:57:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I think I saw an egg! 11:57am
857262340185698305 2017-04-26 15:57:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Some days I feel like my prayers are mechanical. Should I keep doing them or something different?
857260403042156544 2017-04-26 15:49:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Hog Island female laid her first egg on 4/25/17. Maybe someone needs to tell Iris the other ladies are beating her, LOL!
856984821821841408 2017-04-25 21:34:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle If they don't, then they might as well forget ever getting elected again. I'm sick of all of them.
856981736248487940 2017-04-25 21:22:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @RMConservative @michellemalkin I don't understand how this can happen?  I thought the president and Congress decided where federal money was spent.
856607648241909760 2017-04-24 20:35:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 4/24/17 2:35pm Iris looks like she is in egg laying position.  Hope so.
856604679052165120 2017-04-24 20:24:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @larkberly I agree!  Louis is da Man!  I absolutely love him and his antics.
856594755458695168 2017-04-24 19:44:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @Fr_Flynn Very thought provoking and worthy of consideration.https://twitter.com/frhumphries/status/856591577426395137
856592321714024448 2017-04-24 19:34:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @frhumphries That's the way it should be.
856590624837033985 2017-04-24 19:28:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC God bless them and give them the grace and strength to persevere in their journey home.
856559055904673794 2017-04-24 17:22:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @Victoria4Texas @crosswaysobsess The fact that you want to harbor people who are here illegally destroys your credibility. No one has a right to be here illegally.
856552210204942336 2017-04-24 16:55:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @Victoria4Texas @crosswaysobsess But they are not prosecuting them. They are letting them go back out into society.
856551794973044737 2017-04-24 16:53:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @Victoria4Texas @crosswaysobsess When an illegal has committed a felony and the local PD does not comply with a request from ICE to hold them, that is obstruction.
856550516276563970 2017-04-24 16:48:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @Head4BizBod4Sin @RHolton1 @HellgateOsprey I believe Hal came back after both Louis and Iris were at Hellgate.
856550399729422337 2017-04-24 16:48:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @Victoria4Texas @crosswaysobsess But no one should interfere with ICE doing its job. That's called obstruction of justice.
856538450056679425 2017-04-24 16:00:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @Victoria4Texas Would you work as hard to uphold the law? Sanctuary cities are NOT safer and you are lying about it. Nice photo op!
856530328336420867 2017-04-24 15:28:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 4/24/17 9:27am That was not a good mating just now. Louis needs to get on his A game.
856524923040411648 2017-04-24 15:07:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @Head4BizBod4Sin @HellgateOsprey @RHolton1 Well, that's not fair!  Louis and Iris have been back on site longer than Harriet and Hal. Maybe Iris won't let Harriet get ahead of her
856257578665467904 2017-04-23 21:24:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @SebGorka @realDonaldTrump Then kill it before it dies a slow painful death. Forget the Dems and just do what you promised.
856257261076979714 2017-04-23 21:23:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @FrankDagostino1 I agree, but some bishops, like Maltes, Argentinian, German, are giving a very liberal interpretation that opposes JPII teachings.
856243043862814720 2017-04-23 20:27:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Wow, that is smaller than I thought it was.
856228772512661506 2017-04-23 19:30:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC But if a section seems to be causing confusion, it seems incumbent on the Pope to clarify instead of allowing misinterpretations.
856200443503968256 2017-04-23 17:37:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic It won't matter with the socialist/libs because they are the same ones "fighting" fascists and they are the ones behaving like fascists.
856199427157102592 2017-04-23 17:33:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @geoffmprice I believe you are serious, but I believe it is all conjecture and I don't believe any of it. Thanks for playing though.
856198708597321729 2017-04-23 17:30:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @geoffmprice No, they are not. It  means that a person/persons interpreted those things. There were no thermometers to give a recorded temp.
856191919155707904 2017-04-23 17:03:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @TIME @RealJamesWoods @geoffmprice I don't want opinions/guesses/reconstructions of what someone thought was happening. I want actually records, which there are none.
856159868465664000 2017-04-23 14:56:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Not sure I would kiss it, but it looks delicious!
856140190368374784 2017-04-23 13:38:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC People were shorter back then?
856130918758699009 2017-04-23 13:01:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @alclubb1967 @e61616 A lot of people do listen to them. That's why we have so many uninformed people in the U.S.
856130174194200576 2017-04-23 12:58:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @TIME @RealJamesWoods I remember them predicting the next ice age. I want to see all their records from year 325 AD forward to convince me of their accuracy.
856129059474075652 2017-04-23 12:54:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @StFrancisTX @fr.@Fr_Flynn As an older member of St. Francis, I don't feel welcome at St. Francis anymore. Music, etc. is for the young.
855960547178754048 2017-04-22 01:44:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @TWITLESSTWEETER That was great! Louis was incubating Dudley then, wasn't he?
855935623169011712 2017-04-22 00:05:29 UTC <alclubb1967> Signs of the times: Google can celebrate Earth Day but not Easter.
855818642935730178 2017-04-22 16:20:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @toddstarnes Exactly!  Worship is only due God.
855818406829883393 2017-04-22 16:19:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Let's make him an orange tabby since most of them are males. Calico cats are almost all female.  No gender fluid here!
855808693300056064 2017-04-22 15:41:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @subscribetowapo How about "A strong democracy depends on an HONEST press."
855806690981236736 2017-04-22 15:33:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Would that be 'in season and out of season", Father?
855806468557328384 2017-04-22 15:32:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Louis is the Cary Grant of osprey!
855805990238916608 2017-04-22 15:30:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Wouldn't that be known as preaching to the choir?  The press will cover his speeches more than they cover the real President.
855577216184352768 2017-04-21 00:21:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @andykemp16 Every parish I have been in is too big. The priest only knows those few who work with him on committees.
855576738612510720 2017-04-21 00:19:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @andykemp16 When a parish has minimum of 3500 families, many can get lost in the crowd. Pastors can't know most of them to even recognize them by sight.
855575840322617348 2017-04-21 00:15:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you for that detailed explanation!
855558896236343298 2017-04-21 23:08:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Awww, Louis is feeding Iris. Good boy!
855508918814072833 2017-04-21 19:49:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Iris seems to be spending a lot more time working on the nest bowl and laying in it longer. Maybe we will have eggs soon.
855470995787874308 2017-04-21 17:19:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @MissConnieTran I wonder where he wants them to go?
855240236552654848 2017-04-20 02:02:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @lightfalls Woohoo! Another one.
855228689151385601 2017-04-20 01:16:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @conurekeeper Thanks for letting us know.
855225404671619072 2017-04-20 01:03:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you for the clear explanation!
855215011404410880 2017-04-20 00:22:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @LeeBeth7 Oh, good! Yes, Iris whipped Louis into shape last year and he improved dramatically even more this year. They make a great pair.
855185446787272704 2017-04-20 22:24:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento Well, at least I'm not the only one, LOL!  Good company to be in.
855182370613473281 2017-04-20 22:12:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey OOPS, Louis's stick just went over the side.
855182001493729280 2017-04-20 22:10:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey 4/20/17 4:10pm MDT, Louis brings in a giant forked stick that is giving him a bit of trouble with placement.
855181442007142402 2017-04-20 22:08:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I wonder how many viewers are like me that only started watching last year and have only known Louis as the resident male.
855109591427829760 2017-04-20 17:23:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @CNN @FoxNews @RealJamesWoods Start your own network/show, Mr Woods.  You would instantly have viewers.
855109350016339968 2017-04-20 17:22:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Hmmmm, liberal logic on full display.
855108919831691264 2017-04-20 17:20:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor @RealJamesWoods My husband's job was "eliminated" four months before his 65th birthday. He was a stellar employee with nothing but good reviews and results.
855106099212668928 2017-04-20 17:09:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump @Pontifex @FrMatthewLC Maybe it will be mutual.

855039364111446016 2017-04-20 12:44:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Why would they need birth control if they don't need a man? Biology 101
854834348943650816 2017-04-19 23:09:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Be safe, Father, and enjoy your trip.
854833634196541440 2017-04-19 23:06:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @DiamondandSilk No, I don't think so, but everyone is so afraid of certain untouchable groups that they cave at the slightest chance.
854786476193796096 2017-04-19 19:59:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I don't understand what you are saying.
854782578649427969 2017-04-19 19:43:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC That is 100% correct. Wish I could get the people at my parish to understand that.
854745385297903619 2017-04-19 17:15:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Could you post a picture of the neck injury?  I haven't seen anything on Iris's neck, but I am not very good at spotting anything.
854744027568234497 2017-04-19 17:10:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @_Pll_Fan Invasion? It's not an alien lifeform. Can a one year old live on its own? Can a six year old? They are all "bothersome" to the mother.

If you x-ray a fertile egg before it hatches, there will be a live chick inside.
854743028329742336 2017-04-19 17:06:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @GOP @FrMatthewLC @HolyFount I agree. Pastors and clergy should have the same freedom of speech as anyone else.
854725544386101248 2017-04-19 15:57:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @GOP @FrMatthewLC I don't think they should endorse candidates, but they should condemn policies that are evil and go against Catholic teaching -abortion, SSM
854724979899944960 2017-04-19 15:54:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism And that's what churches should look like instead of movie theaters or lecture halls. Kneelers, tabernacles centrally located, etc.
854503544648597504 2017-04-18 01:14:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Employers need to start making a list of similar universities to avoid. Of course, all of those type grads will just go into politics.
854502483783274496 2017-04-18 01:10:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @betwilli @HellgateOsprey I appreciate all that you mods do and I'm sure you are very busy. I thought the info section was for highlights and not regular updates.
854495240434188288 2017-04-18 00:41:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism How beautiful!
854474913113149440 2017-04-18 23:21:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism I think we are beyond flirting and at least on our second date. Just ask Cardinal Burke.
854086728705085445 2017-04-17 21:38:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism @iPadre I wish all priests/nuns would wear their clerical/habits.  So much easier to be inspired by them than when they dress like everyone else.
854086223845085184 2017-04-17 21:36:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Mayor of Berkley, hmmm. Is the one who told the police to not respond to the riot/violence on campus perpetrated against Milo Y.?
854084482470752260 2017-04-17 21:29:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Well, you wouldn't know it by all the fake news media who only want to talk about how horrible we treat the peaceful Muslims.
854025828920897542 2017-04-17 17:36:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Time for immigrants to assimilate. Used to be called the melting pot for a reason. Now it's a bunch of different pots that refuse to mix.
854024963325644801 2017-04-17 17:33:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism There are people who are Christians but are not Catholic. And, people who call themselves Catholic and are not Catholic. Words mean things.
853995379540578304 2017-04-17 15:35:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @Google @TEN_GOP And, I quit using Chrome.  Use Opera browser instead.
853995220593242115 2017-04-17 15:35:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @Google @TEN_GOP I also use DuckDuckGo.  Much better and they don't track you.
853995043404886020 2017-04-17 15:34:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @Google Why didn't you have an Easter themed doodle on your logo? You do it for other events including Ramadan.
853979691396599808 2017-04-17 14:33:19 UTC <alclubb1967> Remember Saint Teresa of Avila's admonition, One who does not stop praying, sooner or later arrives.

853974732424839168 2017-04-17 14:13:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @frhumphries This is so on target. Jesus was counter cultural and did not change His message depending on His audience or current social norms.
853788502919712772 2017-04-16 01:53:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I think she is much better at this than being governor of a state.

852982099158192129 2017-04-14 20:29:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @smrutimishra7 Thank you.  Now I understand your position on animals, eating meat and abortion. I appreciate your taking the time to explain.
852980290951753730 2017-04-14 20:22:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @smrutimishra7 I understand that you do not eat meat.  I don't really care whether you and 99% of Indians eat meat. What is the 99% opinion on abortion?
852975819647483904 2017-04-14 20:04:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @smrutimishra7 Ok, thanks. Killing of all animals is not allowed. Is killing an unborn baby allowed?
852972637408165888 2017-04-14 19:51:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @smrutimishra7 I don't follow the media on most topics. I am asking you what Hindu believe.
852971593840168960 2017-04-14 19:47:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @smrutimishra7 Does your religion teach no harm to any animals or just certain ones?
852957920891424768 2017-04-14 18:53:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @smrutimishra7 But, it's morally OK to kill a baby but not a cow?
852935310174539776 2017-04-14 17:23:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Remember the phrase about being up to your a$$ in alligators......There are plenty of alligators in every swamp. Drain it!
852934297250037760 2017-04-14 17:19:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @larkberly You're welcome.  I'm Catholic so it's a rather important day to us.
852933368534769664 2017-04-14 17:15:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @larkberly It's Good Friday. Many people do have off.
852926807435341826 2017-04-14 16:49:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @LedoPizza Do you really not understand that Good Friday is the most solemn holy day for Christians? Pigging out on pizza is not what it's about.
852926366358097921 2017-04-14 16:47:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @jbnv Good grief! I knew most of Americans were not really religious, but this really takes the cake.
852920630995550209 2017-04-14 16:24:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @jbnv Clearly they have no clue about Lent, Good Friday or Easter. But I'll they get plenty of takers on their offer
852916520485347328 2017-04-14 16:08:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC We aren't joyful until the Resurrection, Easter morning.

852893939891929088 2017-04-14 14:38:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey The nest is really looking good.  Now all we need is an egg or two or three.

852892341534961664 2017-04-14 14:32:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @EricStoller So, I guess you don't include the unborn in your list of most vulnerable?
852891867196870656 2017-04-14 14:30:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @MarkDice Libs applaud women for killing their babies but don't like MOAB. Millions more lives have been lost to abortion than to this bomb.
852890781987864576 2017-04-14 14:26:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @TheBabylonBee @ceneblock Thank you for letting me know.  But, inclusive Bibles are still horribly stitled and distract from the true meaning of the passage.

852562497588559874 2017-04-13 16:41:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Overbooking is standard procedure. Just as some doctors double book patients. Both know that a certain percentage will cancel.

852535869487677441 2017-04-13 14:56:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @ChelseaClinton As opposed to repeatedly lying about a private email server, cause of Benghazi attacks or having oral sex in the Oval office with an intern.

852198337822552066 2017-04-12 16:34:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Precisely! There is only one truth and it is not changeable according to the times. "In season and out of season...."
852197871038459904 2017-04-12 16:33:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @YouTube @TIMENOUT @ahebrewcatholic LOL!  My husband worked for AMR, but not directly for AA. We flew non-rev occasionally. I don't envy the ticket agent's job. Happy Easter!

852193612326633474 2017-04-12 16:16:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @TGowdySC What a great picture.  You are a great representative for your state.
852193181294841856 2017-04-12 16:14:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @YouTube @TIMENOUT @ahebrewcatholic And the prices of tickets would skyrocket. They overbook knowing there will be cancellations. It's more cost effective to fly full planes.
852192833498951680 2017-04-12 16:12:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @YouTube @TIMENOUT @ahebrewcatholic It's more complicated than that. They have departure/gate times to meet. They can't sit there an haggle with people.
852174831793688577 2017-04-12 15:01:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Oh, thank you.  I was wondering if he had been told.
852174551911944192 2017-04-12 15:00:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Thank you for calling it what it is. How many more liberal Jesuits can be promoted by this Pope. We need St. Catherine of Sienna!!
852137568317648898 2017-04-12 12:33:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @Gavin_McInnes @FrMatthewLC 3) You would not allow a screaming child to ruin a party or dinner with other guests. You would remove him until he can behave.
852137388382072833 2017-04-12 12:32:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @Gavin_McInnes @FrMatthewLC 2)To stay with a screaming child is not good for any. No different that at your own home.
852137308820299776 2017-04-12 12:32:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @Gavin_McInnes @FrMatthewLC 1) As a mother and grandmother I can see both sides. I was always respectful of other people, the priest and the Mass.
852128479906861056 2017-04-12 11:57:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @YouTube @TIMENOUT @ahebrewcatholic I agree in theory. I think it could become unmanageable. There will always be someone who tries to take advantage and abuse the system.
851931491584155657 2017-04-11 22:54:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @K96878 Who is that??
851907530217463808 2017-04-11 21:19:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily Animals feel pain... they don't believe in killing cows, but is abortion legal in India?
851900666079563779 2017-04-11 20:52:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily There are only two genders, M & F. How is thinking you are a different gender different from anorexia, thinking yourself too fat?
851833261026418688 2017-04-11 16:24:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods If he is, he is not a pediatrician. They still say that transgender is a psychological disorder that should not be encouraged in children.
851832716718952448 2017-04-11 16:22:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism I pray every day for the Holy Spirit to get the Pope's attention and urge him to clarify and correct errors that are being spread.
851831683821309953 2017-04-11 16:17:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @countermoonbat That is fabulous!  I wish they still had those large monuments in most cemeteries.
851823530593443842 2017-04-11 15:45:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @YouTube @TIMENOUT @ahebrewcatholic Most people voluntarily leave. In fact, I know people who like to get paid to get off a flight and take a later one.
851822867725602816 2017-04-11 15:42:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @YouTube @TIMENOUT @ahebrewcatholic There is a formula U.S. airlines use depending on how long your delay will be. Also, it's part of the fine print when you buy your ticket.
851815493409398784 2017-04-11 15:13:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain The percentages of trans people is so tiny that this should never have been an issue, but the LBGT people make everything into a huge fight.
851815008401051648 2017-04-11 15:11:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey The camera side of the nest is starting to look a lot better.
851814755958489088 2017-04-11 15:10:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain Allowing men into the women's bathroom and dressing rooms is not what I call respecting your customers. I have not & will not shop at Target
851812577004974082 2017-04-11 15:01:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Our police station will take prescription meds.  They will take anything except liquids.
851596788599533568 2017-04-10 00:44:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @MrJoshuaRogers My illness is the perfect cross  for God to use to teach me humility, patience, perseverance and trust in Him. He chose well!
851525814239866882 2017-04-10 20:02:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey OK, thank you.  I'll try it.
851524463904555009 2017-04-10 19:57:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @RHolton1 I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you are saying. Could you explain for this dummy?
851523798956462080 2017-04-10 19:54:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest So, is every country who obtained territory from conflict supposed to just give it back to the people they took it from? Spoils of war.
851505570465144832 2017-04-10 18:42:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @MrJoshuaRogers @BoundlessTeam I ask God to give me the grace to not squander the opportunities he has given me for using my difficulties as a way to grow in virtue.
851484850502684680 2017-04-10 17:19:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @nihilobstat23 I agree.  I don't think I have ever heard a homily given on this topic. It's rarely even noticed. It has always caught my attention.
851475573763452928 2017-04-10 16:42:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @nihilobstat23 Yes, but interesting that it's recorded in the Bible. Gives us all a moment to think how many times we reject the truth.

851441200238387202 2017-04-10 14:26:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC There has been generations of watered down religious ed in our parishes. Need to go back to the Baltimore Catechism. Truth doesn't change.
851440966531788800 2017-04-10 14:25:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC If you wait long enough, pretty much every guideline is reversed. I believe moderation in everything is the first place to start.
851439991859400704 2017-04-10 14:21:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily Interesting that the only person who questioned truth was Pontius Pilate when he said: What is truth?"
851247745788727296 2017-04-09 01:37:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you.

851149436952739840 2017-04-09 19:06:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC St. Augustine cannot be used to support his narrative. Once St. Augustine converted, he didn't go back and expected the same of others.
851147337888145408 2017-04-09 18:58:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @CarpentierKA Wonderful!  Welcome home.  May God bless you and your brother in your journey all the way back.
851095254417772544 2017-04-09 15:31:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Just said a prayer for them. May God comfort the family and receive the soul of the girl into His arms.
850783793313087488 2017-04-08 18:53:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Where are their nests? Are they close to Hellgate?

850684770447233028 2017-04-08 12:20:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @Sacerdotus Thank you so much.  He's a good boy - active but good.  He has a good heart.
850505785570455552 2017-04-07 00:29:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic That's what happens when you have a leader instead of a community organizer.

850439650426716160 2017-04-07 20:06:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @brmartin91 @EdwardPentin The Church has not changed her position but many of the Bishops have. This attitude is directly related to the lack of leadership at the top

850419850073735170 2017-04-07 18:47:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism Add in the horrible secular music they insist on playing during the distribution of Communion and you can't even hear yourself say "Amen".
850418431031734275 2017-04-07 18:42:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Yes, he is seven yrs. old but he thought it was great.
850382608412409859 2017-04-07 16:19:47 UTC <alclubb1967> Oh wow, Louis is so much better at mating this year.  What a difference a year makes!  Good job!  Loved the easy helicopter dismount.

850378557062860803 2017-04-07 16:03:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily Amen!
850377850993725441 2017-04-07 16:00:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics Woohoo!  That is a relief.  Now, let's get down to business.
850376925965111298 2017-04-07 15:57:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Wow, the nest is already looking better.  You go, Louis.  You are doing a great job.
850373032128458755 2017-04-07 15:41:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Our boy, Louis, is already trying to fix that mess of a nest.  He and Iris didn't take any time getting back together!
850362202808864768 2017-04-07 14:58:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey  Gloria Swanson: "I'm ready for my close up, Mr. DeMille". Iris needs to get here for her close up!

850089723003637760 2017-04-06 20:55:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey King Louis the First.  That has a nice ring to it!
850089148891451392 2017-04-06 20:53:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Up until fairly recently, all Supreme Court nominees were confirmed with a straight vote/majority. It was Harry Reid who changed it.
850087217594847236 2017-04-06 20:46:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Oh, I missed the big news!  Louis, my guy, is back!  Woohoo!  Now, Iris can get here any minute.
850060748864839680 2017-04-06 19:00:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC On my calendar it says today is National Tartan Day, LOL!
850043677506457600 2017-04-06 17:53:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Trey Gowdy is fabulous. I would rather have him in charge of any investigation than any other representative.
850030397245321216 2017-04-06 17:00:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @RMSBeagle Thank you!  Someone posted a picture of the raven taking it.  I'm glad that nest is cleaned out and ready for osprey eggs.
849764262532849664 2017-04-05 23:22:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @ChipotleTweets @FrMatthewLC I quit eating at Chipotle after the ecoli issue.
849763776559763459 2017-04-05 23:20:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @TheBabylonBee What a bunch of angry, insecure, deluded women. Inclusive Bibles are horribly awkward and distract from the meaning of the Scripture.
849674719335002116 2017-04-05 17:26:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC In many parishes, the pastor has turned over liturgical things to lay people and he concentrates on budgets, etc. That seems backwards.
849666943095373824 2017-04-05 16:55:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento I get it. Last year was my first year watching Iris and Louis too.
849664313887518721 2017-04-05 16:45:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento Those ravens are just a pest! But, it seems as though they only take eggs that are not going to survive anyway.
849663103537213440 2017-04-05 16:40:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Wow, I didn't realize ravens had such large mouths!  That was a rather large egg, but I'm glad the raven took it away.
849635357545168900 2017-04-05 14:50:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods That's it, except I think the expression on Obama's face should be more smug. And, they forgot Valerie Jarret as the puppetmaster.
849633234287816704 2017-04-05 14:42:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey The goose egg has disappeared from the Dunrovin nest. Does anyone know what happened?
849631618637729794 2017-04-05 14:35:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @hayleymorsen @PrisonPlanet Yeah, that will help you put your lipstick on straight! How dumb!!!!!
849613601904242689 2017-04-05 13:24:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Does anyone doubt she was following orders from Obama or Valerie Jarret?
849318412564254720 2017-04-04 17:51:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Holy cow that is a clear picture! Good job everyone. Thank you!!!
849315171474472961 2017-04-04 17:38:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I would say, grammatically, that is a double negative but Rice and Obama are the REAL double negatives!

848974366780125185 2017-04-03 19:03:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @foolkillerskat I just checked into that nest and it is snowing heavily.  Maybe the snow will bury the goose egg.

848907301494939648 2017-04-03 14:37:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @globella123 @BpOlsonFW I apologize if I was rude in any of my tweets. That was not my intention. It's an emotional issue.
848894967682564096 2017-04-03 13:48:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @cnalive @globella123 It was Bp. Gomez, not Flores.
848889027059232769 2017-04-03 13:24:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @cnalive @globella123 He is using it to justify not deporting illegal immigrants and saying we are all immigrants and Spain got here first.
848888845693276160 2017-04-03 13:24:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @globella123 Both S. Amer and N. Amer tribes and their way of life were wiped out by various armies. But, none of that justifies illegal immigration.
848886240854380544 2017-04-03 13:13:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @cnalive @globella123 But still foreign. The Spanish conquered the native peoples. Cannot be used as an argument for illegal immigration today.
848886008640942081 2017-04-03 13:12:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @globella123 I am saying that cannot be used as an argument against controlling our borders and for illegal immigration. Bp. Gomez wants to do that.
848885778600132608 2017-04-03 13:11:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @globella123 2) They were converted, yes, but sometimes not willingly. They lost their culture; many died from disease.
848885145906163712 2017-04-03 13:09:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @globella123 1) I am not trying to be difficult. I am a faithful Catholic. But, the Incas, Aztecs, Mayans, tribes in N. Amer. were conquered by Spanish.
848882382174380032 2017-04-03 12:58:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @cnalive @globella123 3) Bp. Gomez sounds like he wants us to give Texas back to Mexico when he refers to the place his family lived as "currently called Texas".
848882236745289728 2017-04-03 12:57:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @cnalive @globella123 2) Why are we now told that Spanish was more the original language of N. America than English. Neither was.
848881820636721153 2017-04-03 12:56:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @cnalive @globella123 1) The Spanish conquest of S.Amer,Central Amer. is no different from the European settlers in N. Amer. Both replace the native population.
848659076536049665 2017-04-02 22:11:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCITLFrAphorism They rejected the truth and so do many today. Truth never changes.
848655164152197120 2017-04-02 21:55:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I think those are what are called cafeteria Catholics.
848653744577359873 2017-04-02 21:49:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @_wintergirl93 The tribe of the Pink Bonnets make ugly face and screeching sounds. Me no like 'em. Too angry. Ate too much loco weed.
848621734467174400 2017-04-02 19:42:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @nytimes @RealJamesWoods Agree completely. It's nice to have such reliable media barometers as NYT, MSNBC, WAPO and so many others.
848619430468833280 2017-04-02 19:33:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I wish we could have a few moments of silence. Seems like most parishes think every second has to be filled with some kind of noise.
848609950930796547 2017-04-02 18:55:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC What other evils are you thinking of, Father?
848593261161832450 2017-04-02 17:49:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @OKCOwlCam I was wondering how he was going to compete with the two older ones.  Thanks for letting us know about the supplemental feedings. Bless you!
848592995813400576 2017-04-02 17:48:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Well, Democrats will think that is unfair and he needs to give half of his income to another person of their choice.
848592571538575362 2017-04-02 17:46:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @Aries19Xx Stupid is not knowing your party set up the nuclear option. Sad that you are the one that actually is stupid. #Instablock
848579391164747776 2017-04-02 16:54:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @TheDemocrats @RealJamesWoods McConnell just needs to go nuclear and not even skip a beat. Just mow them down like they do us all the time.
848579072854818817 2017-04-02 16:53:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin But we should welcome them in with open arms! When will they learn.
848578817555910658 2017-04-02 16:52:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @cnalive Most peoples were displaced by settlements from others. Just read the OT. See the list of peoples: Assyrians, Moabites, Jebusites, etc.
848578158316195840 2017-04-02 16:49:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC We need to do that with everyone: elderly, disabled, etc.
848569006256787456 2017-04-02 16:13:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods We need to target the perps, not the tools they use. There are limitless things they can turn into bombs. Stop the "gun control" mentality.
848565728861196289 2017-04-02 16:00:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @cnalive So, it was OK for the Spanish to decimate the Native Americans but not for Europeans to settle America. Both were not indigenous peoples.
848537388053934080 2017-04-02 14:07:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @newsbusters @mrctv @ahebrewcatholic I've lived long enough to go through their hysterics on another ice age to today's global warming. The climate always is in flux.
848522181520883712 2017-04-02 13:07:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @Daggy1 @ahebrewcatholic Exactly! I was shamed and berated as a stay at home mother in the 1970's by the feminists and it is still going on today.
848520638541287425 2017-04-02 13:00:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Yes, our real home!  God Bless you.
848281467146948612 2017-04-01 21:10:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Unfortunately, he didn't respond to me and nothing has been done. But, I know he is busy.  I'll ask again in the future.
848280280947453952 2017-04-01 21:05:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Having disabled seating in the front row would make it easy for them to receive Communion in place w/o having to navigate the lines.
848279709452566528 2017-04-01 21:03:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I asked our pastor if we could set aside a front pew for people with disabilities. We don't have special seating areas for wheelchairs,etc.
848277184364019712 2017-04-01 20:53:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC That seems fair, Father.
848271330172690440 2017-04-01 20:30:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @OKCOwlCam Do you have any idea how old this chick is? He's smaller than the other two, so I'm guessing maybe a week younger?
848183482903932932 2017-04-01 14:41:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCC4Christ @ahebrewcatholic By the way, I am not questioning the Church; she knows best. I am an orthodox faithful Catholic. I just found it curious.
848180508488019971 2017-04-01 14:29:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCC4Christ @ahebrewcatholic I've been a Catholic for 71 years. I understand the name of the feast day. I was merely saying I thought it should be emphasized more.
848143717294895104 2017-04-01 12:03:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @MCC4Christ @ahebrewcatholic I know it's the same thing, but it is not a Holy Day of Obligation. I just think it's curious that a bigger deal is not made of it.
847993496086695936 2017-03-31 02:06:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic @MCC4Christ I think March 25 should be celebrated as a greater feast day. It's the Annunciation but also the moment of conception/Incarnation.
847992139657203713 2017-03-31 02:00:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @AshleyCsanady @ToupsFamily Same logic that mocks Melania Trump for staying in NY so her son can finish school but applauds Hillary for savaging her husband's victims.
847988833576792064 2017-03-31 01:47:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @AshleyCsanady @ToupsFamily So, I guess she would rather have men like Bill Clinton & Anthony Weiner who abuse women and demean their wives. Typical lib logic!

847883424698429440 2017-03-31 18:48:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Hospice care makes the patient comfortable but does not hasten death. No lethal doses are given, only comfort level.
847562574145232896 2017-03-30 21:33:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @POTUS @KellyannePolls Stop attacking the Freedom Caucus. They are not your enemy. Stop listening to the swamp you were supposed to drain.
847562182145576960 2017-03-30 21:32:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @vpotus @IngrahamAngle With all the law suits for sexual harrassment, he's just being smart to not put himself in a situation that someone will want to sue over.
847524269672353792 2017-03-30 19:01:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Why is it that libs hate everything about traditional values? Do they prefer types like Bill Clinton,Anthony Weiner that demean their wives
847141647867629570 2017-03-29 17:41:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC They have won the battle for language when it comes to abortion, SSM, and transgenders. We've been too slow in framing our case
846891172110962688 2017-03-28 01:06:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Tell 'em, Mr.Woods! This PC garbage has just gone too far.
846845943710453760 2017-03-28 22:06:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Will these two ever stop?? They need to be relieved of duty.
846845633113833480 2017-03-28 22:05:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle They were flying "non rev" on an employee pass. There are strict guidelines on how to dress when flying non rev.
846845350270918656 2017-03-28 22:03:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @washingtonpost These kids were flying "non rev" on an employee pass. There are strict guidelines for how you must dress to fly non rev.

846769536783306753 2017-03-28 17:02:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey No disrespect, but I don't think it is fair for Louis to always be in Stan's shadow. RIP Stan, but Louis is our guy now.
846745038331809792 2017-03-28 15:25:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Seems like most libs are becoming completely unhinged. That's scary when the leader of a political party loses it in public.
846738310441656321 2017-03-28 14:58:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @toddstarnes What a stupid excuse. I'm sorry, but he's had plenty of on the job training to do his job.
846736866032439298 2017-03-28 14:52:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin @MarkSKrikorian Oh good grief!  Of course he disappeared somewhere south of the border.
846727445323681792 2017-03-28 14:15:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @FoxNews @RealJamesWoods Looks like all libs, from the top down, are using hatred and violence against anyone they don't agree with.

846093909356875776 2017-03-26 20:18:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @TGowdySC Mr. Gowdy, I don't think there has been an issue on which you have spoken that I have disagreed with. You are fabulous, Sir.
846085548703920128 2017-03-26 19:44:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor @DplrableOne Great!  At least some police are doing their job.  Where did this happen, do you know?
846083217228775431 2017-03-26 19:35:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @BarbaraDadam They are right. Trump has everything against him: the Dems, the media and the Republicans.
846079195415564289 2017-03-26 19:19:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @BarbaraDadam It's a nightmare. Unless we enact term limits, there is no hope of anything improving.
846078698927411202 2017-03-26 19:17:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor Were they arrested for assault?  If not, why not?
846078288011366401 2017-03-26 19:15:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @AnnCoulter HOW MANY MORE TIMES... This has got to stop.
846078103319400453 2017-03-26 19:15:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @BarbaraDadam I really can't name one person in Congress that does not think of their own career first before anything else.
846072829581934593 2017-03-26 18:54:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest She and her boss apparently think their husbands (serial abusers) are innocent and blame all the women they took advantage of.
846072254236635136 2017-03-26 18:51:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Term limits is the only way to go.  Everyone up there has become as rotten as last year's Easter eggs!
845796121700155392 2017-03-25 00:34:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Yes, I have been visiting your site. It is very interesting. My husband and I are currently reading the Old Testament.
845792558429155328 2017-03-25 00:20:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @newadvent @ahebrewcatholic I'm with you. I grew up singing Gregorian Chant. There is no music better to elevate us to a higher level.
845790664034045952 2017-03-25 00:13:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Yes, it is. I am a 71 yr. old cradle Catholic. I am working on humble acceptance  of God's will & being a joyful sufferer.
845756798158213121 2017-03-25 21:58:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC All the bishops in the world can say that but until Pope Francis clears it up, there are going to be those who say the opposite
845741060022321152 2017-03-25 20:55:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @alclubb1967 So much for "choice" that they are always screaming about.

845716951083204613 2017-03-25 19:20:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Don't libs say you should always believe the girl/woman and never blame the victim in rape cases. Unless the perp is illegal!
845685681582227456 2017-03-25 17:15:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW As pro-lifers, we should celebrate today. Since life begins at conception, this is the day 2nd Person of the Trinity became man.

845366577407184896 2017-03-24 20:07:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @toddstarnes Ryan is not on board with Trump's agenda and this proves it. Trump needs to understand that.
845360928677875712 2017-03-24 19:45:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC With all due respect, Father, national defense is the #1 job of the federal government. Not safety nets.
845360606635003905 2017-03-24 19:44:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @toddstarnes Good! Now maybe they can craft one that is good and not just Obamacare under a different name.
845360211196104704 2017-03-24 19:42:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Much of the money would not go to expanding but rebuilding unsafe equipment.. Air Force is flying planes they can't repair.

845359404539170817 2017-03-24 19:39:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @FranPatterson1 I would rather have term limits. I was just saying that if that is not possible, maybe retirement is an option.
845359197051072513 2017-03-24 19:38:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @lineworksdone That's great if experience does something good. But, McCain has become an obstructionist instead.
845354088942440449 2017-03-24 19:18:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @FormTheCulture Why isn't the Vatican pushing for action on all the Catholics who refuse to accept Church teachings on marriage.
845353880665907204 2017-03-24 19:17:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @lineworksdone It's not age discrimination. It's making way for someone who can get the job done.

845348763837353986 2017-03-24 18:57:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle If we can't have term limits, can we at least have a mandatory retirement age? McCain needs to leave, the sooner the better.

845266880810156033 2017-03-24 13:31:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW Why is Mar. 25 not a holy day of obligation. The Annunciation is also the day that Jesus was conceived in Mary's womb.
845257596202311680 2017-03-24 12:54:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @ahebrewcatholic Thank you for being such a blessing! You are a perfect example of "letting your light shine before men."

844940265509048320 2017-03-23 15:53:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Problem is they can change their minds depending on how they feel and how is anyone supposed to know? Just call me logical.

844683286890860545 2017-03-22 22:52:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @Billybobtn @bestpatriotnews Obama signed an order before he left to let NSA share raw intel without warrant w/all intel community.
844680577294979073 2017-03-22 22:41:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @Billybobtn @bestpatriotnews that should not have revealed Americans names and should not have been shared widely
844678679368257537 2017-03-22 22:34:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @Billybobtn @bestpatriotnews I saw the press conference. Nunes said he was bothered about what he saw and it had nothing to do with Russia.
844678259891687424 2017-03-22 22:32:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @alclubb1967 @Billybobtn Exactly!
844661645792231424 2017-03-22 21:26:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @JBrooks191 I don't believe we know for sure who initiated it. But, names of American citizens should not have been revealed
844659011505008640 2017-03-22 21:16:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods So, Trump was right - again.
844656431639023616 2017-03-22 21:06:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @theblaze @MattWalshBlog Right! I just read the quote in Isaiah about calling evil good and good evil. We live in an upside down world.
844653083724595200 2017-03-22 20:52:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @jkklbak @MDWatkins25 It's not discrimination if everyone has to abide by the same rules.
844643753495318529 2017-03-22 20:15:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor He's a little late to the party, isn't he.
844638366796795904 2017-03-22 19:54:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @FoxNews @RealJamesWoods They kill Christians and gov't persecutes Christians and Obama didn't let Christian refugees in.
844634171821707265 2017-03-22 19:37:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC A lot of bishops and cardinals say that, but there are also a lot who say the opposite. Clarification from the Pope is needed.
844630945474994176 2017-03-22 19:24:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @jkklbak @MDWatkins25 Whatever you want to believe. Have a nice day.
844619741713104897 2017-03-22 18:40:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @jkklbak @MDWatkins25 They are not discriminating. They are enforcing the rules for that place. Same with restaurants, movie theaters, etc.
844616577291108368 2017-03-22 18:27:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Nothing is perfect, but encouraging people to work for benefits is not a bad thing.
844616167109148675 2017-03-22 18:26:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @MattWalshBlog @jkklbak @MDWatkins25 Public places, not private property. Free speech is limited in private homes, offices, etc. Look it up.
844609519154085889 2017-03-22 17:59:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @MattWalshBlog @jkklbak You're right.  I should not have used "of course".I should have just replied in the affirmative. I apologize.
844605814522359808 2017-03-22 17:44:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellHawks Do you think it is too late in the season for Big Red to find another mate?
844605306709725184 2017-03-22 17:42:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @MattWalshBlog @jkklbak It's not the content, but the fact that they might have rules against certain behaviors. Same in workplace
844605049699532801 2017-03-22 17:41:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @MattWalshBlog @jkklbak Depends on what the rules are for each mall. You could be asked to leave any private establishment for behavior
844590116614164481 2017-03-22 16:42:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @AmerMilNews @MattWalshBlog @jkklbak Of course all malls are private property. They are owned by individuals, not the government.
844588213800964100 2017-03-22 16:34:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @MattWalshBlog Since she has achieved everything in her life, she can disappear and we don't have to hear from her again (her parents too).
844571296826642432 2017-03-22 15:27:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @MattWalshBlog Can we say "participation trophy"?
844536101691969536 2017-03-22 13:07:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Well, he certainly fulfilled their expectations.
844337015130902528 2017-03-21 23:56:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @cnalive @BpOlsonFW How totally cool is that! I wish they were here so I could buy pizza from them! That is a fabulous idea.
844296431280250880 2017-03-21 21:15:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @MattWalshBlog She's only 40??
844279062612889604 2017-03-21 20:06:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC It's a sideshow that won't change anything.
844278511842054144 2017-03-21 20:04:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC If only that attitude was held by all judges.  Then, we wouldn't have had some of the idealogical rulings in the past 40+ years
844273836820496384 2017-03-21 19:45:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @Support How can I increase the font size in the Android Twitter app on my tablet?
844263544363372544 2017-03-21 19:04:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @MattWalshBlog We might have a chance at 2-3 more justices.  Why be confrontational when it's not necessary.
844257782417252354 2017-03-21 18:41:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @MattWalshBlog Maybe he wants to say he is not going to answer any hypothetical questions on any issue. He can only rule on actual cases
844252813404393473 2017-03-21 18:22:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @MattWalshBlog Just the few clips I have seen of Gorsuch answering questions seems to show that he gets irritated easily.
844250087987515392 2017-03-21 18:11:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @MattWalshBlog @CalFreiburger Maybe he was, but just not to overturn them.I think we are on the same side, just phrasing things differently.
844249216788643841 2017-03-21 18:07:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @MattWalshBlog @CalFreiburger Then he would have had to ask about many rulings, not just Roe. I'm saying no judge would answer beforehand.
844245602548551682 2017-03-21 17:53:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @MattWalshBlog I want Roe overturned but it would be wrong for anyone to ask a judge to rule before they even have a case in front of them.
844242838799945728 2017-03-21 17:42:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @MattWalshBlog I agree, but we can die holding our breaths waiting for the Republicans to do the smart correct thing. They are wimps.
844242402953125890 2017-03-21 17:40:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @MattWalshBlog Unless McConnell pulls the nuclear option, I don't think they have 60 votes for sure.
844240678481776641 2017-03-21 17:33:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @RKBs_Twitstery By the way, thank you for a respectful discussion. Most of the time it turns ugly.
844240546264731648 2017-03-21 17:33:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @RKBs_Twitstery I agree, but maybe if it wasn't so accepted/available, more women wouldn't use it as just another form of birth control.
844239776077221889 2017-03-21 17:30:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @RKBs_Twitstery 100% of babies die during an abortion.
844239586935083009 2017-03-21 17:29:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @RKBs_Twitstery Abortion is not a health issue. If you don't want to be pregnant, there are plenty of ways to avoid it.
844239462041305088 2017-03-21 17:29:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @RKBs_Twitstery A baby in the womb is not the woman's body.
844233121562312706 2017-03-21 17:03:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @RKBs_Twitstery 4) The right to life is paramount above all others, A women's rights have to take second place to that.
844232947876216833 2017-03-21 17:03:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @RKBs_Twitstery 3) Abortion is murder. Murder is illegal. It's not a choice; it's a baby. NO ONE has the right to kill another person.
844232715637608448 2017-03-21 17:02:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @RKBs_Twitstery 2) Pro-choicers are the ones who want gov't to pay for abortion, pay for birth control.
844232424397639680 2017-03-21 17:01:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @RKBs_Twitstery 1) Small fed gov't would mean leaving most things to the states. Roe v Wade forced fed gov't intervention.
844217060263628802 2017-03-21 16:00:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @theblaze @MattWalshBlog Tomi Lahren is a fraud and her outing her pro-choice self on The View did great harm to all real pro-lifers.
844179716714250241 2017-03-21 13:31:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren You could always watch re-runs of The View.
844179297271271424 2017-03-21 13:30:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @MattWalshBlog I agree. Having the WH and Congress is nothing compared to losing the battle on abortion and SSM.
844170635714740224 2017-03-21 12:55:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @LeahRBoss This person has a national platform and millions of followers. She did a lot of damage and makes it harder for real pro-lifers.
843989618034786304 2017-03-20 00:56:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Oh, Carmel is so beautiful!  Enjoy your month.
843976981729427458 2017-03-20 00:06:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @MattWalshBlog Exactly! Abortion stops a beating human heart. It's not the woman's heart. It belongs to another person, THE BABY!
843869062698598400 2017-03-20 16:57:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @LaraLeaTrump @EricTrump Congratulations!!!
843851322361364481 2017-03-20 15:46:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @RandyEBarnett @michellemalkin No, your job is to see if he's a judge that applies the law and doesn't make it up out of thin air!
843602145614200832 2017-03-19 23:16:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Beam me up, Scotty. There is no intelligent life down here! I am so sick of this kind of garbage. Get a life!!!!!
843599701526110208 2017-03-19 23:06:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @endstpats It's OK for any kind of peaceful rally to take place. Go find a copy of the 1st Amendment and have someone explain it to you.
843592455601774593 2017-03-19 22:38:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I'm trying to remember America before.....
843583406390857729 2017-03-19 22:02:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Oh, great! The Hildebeest is back. Why isn't she an endangered species.
843582925895557120 2017-03-19 22:00:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods How does she not choke on all that baloney!
843582763899015169 2017-03-19 21:59:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @CNN @RealJamesWoods Maybe it's because of global warming??
843566993060126725 2017-03-19 20:56:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren Hmmm, this makes you sick but killing unborn humans is just a choice that is OK? That shark was a fetus once too.
843562842456571904 2017-03-19 20:40:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @St_Josemaria My goal is to be as trusting of God and as obedient to His Holy Will that St. Joseph was.  I have a long way to go!
843562329237327872 2017-03-19 20:38:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin This is so deranged that I don't even have words for it.  Wait, yes, it's diabolical.
843542677157306369 2017-03-19 19:20:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren @RealKiraDavis And, yes, not only will I turn it off but I will unfollow her too. Fool me once, shame on her....
843542203066695686 2017-03-19 19:18:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren @RealKiraDavis She doesn't have the right to call herself a conservative, then tell us we are hypocrites if we are pro-life
843540168728559616 2017-03-19 19:10:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren @cheertierni Mine too. I unfollowed her yesterday.
843532584860733445 2017-03-19 18:40:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren @cheertierni That's what happens when you misrepresent yourself. Conservatives take their positions seriously.
843510208467034112 2017-03-19 17:11:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Gorgeous!  Reminds me of growing up in Louisiana.
843506331789287426 2017-03-19 16:55:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren @hayleymorsen @TheMarkRomano @JeremyAEllis For me, all abortions are murder, so if murder is illegal, so should abortion.
843489351925465092 2017-03-19 15:48:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @SenSanders @touchofmyhand @zombiejohnnyc They want govt to pay for having kids and also to pay for killing kids. What a "choice".
843465206214938629 2017-03-19 14:12:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC My 4 yr. struggle w/chronic vertigo has given me the opportunity to practice humility, patience, and trust in God. God is good!
843462552495538181 2017-03-19 14:01:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Happy St. Joseph's Day, the patron of fathers and the family. (I know the Church celebrates tomorrow, but it's really today.)
843285375011311616 2017-03-18 02:17:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren You lost all credibility. You'd better hope "The View" hires you because no conservative outlet should. You'll betray them.
843282008352702464 2017-03-18 02:04:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @JesseBWatters @FoxNews @TomiLahren Sorry, won't be watching you any more. Who knows what you'll change your mind on next!
843270970970439680 2017-03-18 01:20:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @glennbeck So, Glenn, what are you going to do with your little "constitutional" pro-choice fake conservative, moderate, libertarian?
843263614060564482 2017-03-18 00:51:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren Tell that to the people who sued for it in Row v Wade. Pro-choicers are the ones who want govt to pay for it.
843261395156320257 2017-03-18 00:42:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren @jnsanchez Pro-choice are the ones who want the govt to pay for and legalize abortions and pay for birth control.
843253832176062464 2017-03-18 00:12:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @TheMarkRomano @hayleymorsen @TomiLahren If she is for smaller govt she should be pro-life then NO govt money would be involved w/abortions.
843203788911665153 2017-03-18 20:53:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren Abortion stops a beating heart; it's not the woman's otherwise she would die. It must belong to someone else! #It'sNotYourBody
843189490084732934 2017-03-18 19:56:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren @hayleymorsen Right! It's not a kidney. IT'S A BABY!
843185425619603456 2017-03-18 19:40:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren #unfollowTomiLahren

843185033401786368 2017-03-18 19:39:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren @LibertyBritt Agreed! She really has potential until she drank the Kool Aid. Not believable on any issue. #unfollowTomi
843184297464991745 2017-03-18 19:36:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @FoxNews @RealJamesWoods Doesn't she mean climb out from under her rock? I'd rather she would stay buried.
843179458077114368 2017-03-18 19:17:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren @YhwhKhai7 Definitely lost some conservative street cred!
843177113872154625 2017-03-18 19:07:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren @YhwhKhai7 Not at all. Don't sell yourself as someone who takes on the lib positions and then assume the same position.
843173171503292417 2017-03-18 18:52:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren I was a great fan but am very disappointed in your current position on abortion. It doesn't fit with what you have said before.
842915969903345664 2017-03-17 01:50:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @ConnieHarbuck1 They avoid facts. I think they are allergic to them!
842915750662823936 2017-03-17 01:49:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @ConnieHarbuck1 That was supposed to be liberal, not library, LOL!
842915539764891649 2017-03-17 01:48:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @ConnieHarbuck1 Oh! Yeah that happens when you try to talk to a library about the facts.
842914561326022656 2017-03-17 01:44:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @ConnieHarbuck1 Wonder why he didn't block me? I'm the one who told him to go away. Do you know him?
842911112077238272 2017-03-17 01:30:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @ConnieHarbuck1 @Scondrasht I am not the one who is  brainwashed. Please go talk to someone who cares about what you have to say.
842872372633964546 2017-03-17 22:56:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @flamingoart Nice looking kale!
842835915403907072 2017-03-17 20:31:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Why is everything picked apart. They had a meeting, they shook hands, move along.
842830724923310081 2017-03-17 20:11:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @bmet7 OK, thanks.  Then, no one will pay attention to it except the handful of people who attend daily Mass.
842830143936778241 2017-03-17 20:08:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @bmet7 Will it replace the 3rd Sunday of Lent?
842829045498892289 2017-03-17 20:04:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I'm trying to get our parish to have a 2 weekly confessions but I was told "no", because too many people would come.
842827548031680514 2017-03-17 19:58:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Maybe.  But, I feel bad that no one pays attention to St. Joseph's feast day which is just two days later.
842826244551053312 2017-03-17 19:53:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Is nothing sacred? No pun intended, Father. But, really, can't they just leave Monopoly and Oreos alone?
842122472954683399 2017-03-15 21:16:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @MALCTx @BpOlsonFW @TXCatholic Did the tens of thousands unaccompanied minors feel deep trauma when their parents sent them here illegally?
842098282700627968 2017-03-15 19:40:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey LOL! I can see that.
842088781356400643 2017-03-15 19:03:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @KatyAllen7 @HellgateOsprey I thought it had an "A" on the end making it CHOWA, with the "A" standing for anonymous.
842071543807123461 2017-03-15 17:54:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Maybe those were really Russians disguised as Bill and Loretta!
842046176270663681 2017-03-15 16:13:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Can we be done with both Megyn Kelly and the Clintons?  Both are getting tiresome.
841799005571043328 2017-03-14 23:51:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Do we know yet if there will be a live cam at any nest this year?
841692372035604480 2017-03-14 16:47:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC The Pop Out Mass toy arrived and it is so nice. The pieces are much larger than I thought and very sturdy!  Thanks for the tip.
841337560802701314 2017-03-13 17:18:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @subscribetowapo How about an HONEST press informs the people. It's your job to report. Report: retelling the facts of what happened.
841279210991820800 2017-03-13 13:26:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @VescovoDDK That's, Bishop. "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive..."
841073858299985920 2017-03-12 23:50:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC St. Augustine said we have to keep moving forward toward our goal. If we stop, we are lost.
841048627959255040 2017-03-12 22:09:53 UTC <alclubb1967> This video of this little girl is fabulous: http://www.allenbwest.com/michele/watch-11-year-old-trump-supporter-makes-sense-gop-lawmakers
841003761778741248 2017-03-12 19:11:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Isn't is sad that the winner should be a widely held opinion of  Papal statements. They should not need constant clarification.
840982695060656128 2017-03-12 17:47:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest He makes more sense than Democrats. It's interesting that the Russians accept the results of the election but the libs don't.
840962042127360000 2017-03-12 16:25:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest I hope the ACLU tells them that blocking freeways, setting fires, and smashing property is not protected free speech.
840934118946942976 2017-03-12 14:34:52 UTC <alclubb1967> We should eliminate DST.  National Geographic agrees:http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/11/131101-when-does-daylight-savings-time-end-november-3-science/
840932374473015296 2017-03-12 14:27:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC We went to Saturday 5:00pm anticipatory Mass as usual.
840929106980155392 2017-03-12 14:14:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC It's very irritating and like a note that is played off key.
840928941275770880 2017-03-12 14:14:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC One priest at our parish won't say "one God" at the end of the opening prayer (Father, Son & Holy Spirit.) He says' "our God"
840927558417973248 2017-03-12 14:08:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatt2013 Now, Father, don't you know DST is some kind of conspiracy of the Catholic Church to force people to get to Mass early??
840920000227614721 2017-03-12 13:38:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Gosh, in my day my husband just put his hand on my stomach so he could feel our baby kick. I guess that's not hi tech enough.
840918823465304064 2017-03-12 13:34:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @pheebstersPT I agree. Iris trained him well and he became my sweetheart too.
840918549405274112 2017-03-12 13:33:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @pheebstersPT @HellgateOsprey @foolkillerskat I just hope Louis and Iris make it back safe and sound.
840738198544355329 2017-03-11 01:36:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @DesireeSeattle God gave us free will. We can choose to do good or do evil. He is not going to force one or the other.
840737615099904000 2017-03-11 01:34:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @DesireeSeattle I don't know. God's ways are not man's ways. If we never have to struggle we never know the joy of victory.
840736148922200064 2017-03-11 01:28:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @DesireeSeattle St. Paul said he was given a thorn in the flesh and God told him that God's grace was sufficient for him.
840734898252066818 2017-03-11 01:23:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @DesireeSeattle God made the world good. Man brought sin and suffering into it. Things won't be perfect until we get to heaven.
840733543827423233 2017-03-11 01:17:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @DesireeSeattle Jesus said, "Love others as I have loved you." He loved us enough to die for us. How can we not suffer for him?
840733282492923904 2017-03-11 01:16:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @DesireeSeattle If we show acceptance and live toward a disabled person, we have improved the world and given an example to others.
840733017949761536 2017-03-11 01:15:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @DesireeSeattle People are mean. God is not. We live in a world of imperfect humans. God is love. We can change hearts by our behavior.
840732199938859009 2017-03-11 01:12:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @DesireeSeattle that should have been "I don't think God is punishing me"
840731970741141504 2017-03-11 01:11:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @DesireeSeattle for 4 years. I don't like God is punishing me. I feel like it's an opportunity for me to carry my cross like he asked me to.
840731629664501761 2017-03-11 01:10:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @DesireeSeattle 1)I don't know of a response to that. Many things happen in life that we don't understand. I have had chronic vertigo
840729110984970241 2017-03-11 01:00:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @DesireeSeattle 6) purpose than we know about. She may never know whose life has been changed by seeing her devotion to her child.
840728757396766721 2017-03-11 00:58:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @DesireeSeattle 5)  Many people suffer without knowing why. All the mother has to do is live the baby and trust there is a greater
840728285885693952 2017-03-11 00:56:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @DesireeSeattle 4) and suffered horribly. All things work for the good in God's plans.
840727969836519424 2017-03-11 00:55:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @DesireeSeattle 3) we will survive even the most difficult situations. God asks us to try knowing that we will fall. Jesus was innocent
840727633293905921 2017-03-11 00:54:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @DesireeSeattle 2) persevere through their own difficulty. Maybe to show that we can't understand everything we are faced with but that
840727299343450112 2017-03-11 00:53:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @DesireeSeattle 1) That baby has a purpose. Maybe it's to let others be inspired by the mom's unconditional. Maybe to help another person
840684977599705088 2017-03-11 22:04:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @DesireeSeattle I'm sorry I have to now but I will respond more when I get back.
840684676486434816 2017-03-11 22:03:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @DesireeSeattle We cannot understand God's methods. We must accept His will and trust that He knows what is best.
840682446081413122 2017-03-11 21:54:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @DesireeSeattle @FrMatthewLC Twitter has a lot of limitations, Father. Hard to have a quality discussion.
840681997206999044 2017-03-11 21:53:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @DesireeSeattle I understand. I think he was answering in reference to genetics issue. Probably could have been clearer.
840678788052713475 2017-03-11 21:40:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @DesireeSeattle Provided we turn away from our sinful behavior and ask for forgiveness. Prodigal son is a good example.
840678613133463552 2017-03-11 21:39:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @DesireeSeattle Not because of physical/genetic issues. When we sin, we turn away from God. He is always ready to take us back.
840678320983420928 2017-03-11 21:38:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @DesireeSeattle I think what Father meant was that heaven is open to all who are willing to live according to Jesus's teachings
840672192560005120 2017-03-11 21:14:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @DesireeSeattle Jesus doesn't reject anyone based on physical characteristics. We reject Jesus by our actions.
840631793812418561 2017-03-11 18:33:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @Maginary1_ I don't even know what you are arguing about any more. I think this discussion is pointless and over.
840631669497421824 2017-03-11 18:33:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @Maginary1_ Killing of another human life is murder. You just said life begins at conception. Murder after birth is not legal.
840629708270256130 2017-03-11 18:25:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @Maginary1_ Why should I pay for your choices. Do you pay for my vitamins, herbal supplements that I consider essential to my health?
840629237904232448 2017-03-11 18:23:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @Maginary1_ Abortion is not essential. It's already legal. If you want birth control, go buy it. Abortion is NOT healthcare. It's murder.
840628734256390144 2017-03-11 18:21:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @Maginary1_ No, I am not pro-abortion.  I am pro-life.
840609701377253377 2017-03-11 17:05:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @Maginary1_ I don't look for all ways in which life is not fair. Victimhood is an unhealthy place to live when it is a tool for manipulation
840608852705976326 2017-03-11 17:02:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @Maginary1_ If a man is out of the workforce for years, I think it would be the same. Nothing is 100% fair because people are individuals.
840607911080534021 2017-03-11 16:58:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @Maginary1_ I don't believe women who take off 5+ years & come back should be paid the same as anyone who stayed in their job continuously.
840607194403999746 2017-03-11 16:55:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @Maginary1_ It's not 12 wks of maternity leave that's the problem. It's choosing to take off years and come back later. Own you choices.
840602948140957697 2017-03-11 16:38:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @Maginary1_ Yes, the same field. You were comparing nurses with construction workers. Less than 5% is much different from the 2/3 you said.
840602160056393728 2017-03-11 16:35:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @Maginary1_ Actually he has a master's in PT, two PhD's and an MBA. He is a director at a hospital.
840599480315568128 2017-03-11 16:25:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I just found it on Amazon and ordered it for Easter for my grandsons.  Thanks for posting it. Great idea.
840597028149350401 2017-03-11 16:15:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC During the '70's I was shamed for being a stay at home mom. Radical feminism is not about free choice but about coercion.
840596328170283008 2017-03-11 16:12:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatt2013 I feel your pain, Father. It takes me weeks to adjust to DST. It is the tool of a warped mind. We will fight it together.
840395576395075585 2017-03-10 02:54:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods That setup is just creepy.
840383642136379394 2017-03-10 02:07:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @FoxNews @Jehmu @TuckerCarlson And abortions are up!
840358854554710016 2017-03-10 00:28:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Great! I've been married for 50 years and that's a lot of Friday meals to come up with.
840351579173711872 2017-03-10 00:00:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Tuna fish sandwiches will work too.
840342298785374208 2017-03-10 23:23:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @LifeZette @bettyfree13 I don't have to speak personally to anyone who goes on TV to rant and scream and complain.
840296894219841541 2017-03-10 20:22:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @Maginary1_ Because someone goes to college does not translate to higher pay. My plumber makes more per hour than my college degreed son.
840296496281063425 2017-03-10 20:21:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @Maginary1_ Actually, teachers have a powerful union. And, they did not work on March 8 and some schools had to close.
840296296082739200 2017-03-10 20:20:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @Maginary1_ You can't compare those two. Do male nurses make more than female nurses? Do female construction workers make less than males?
840295881274454017 2017-03-10 20:18:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @Maginary1_ If all things are equal, the disparity in pay is negligible. You pay the same to women doctors as to men doctors.
840295310970748933 2017-03-10 20:16:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @Maginary1_ Yes, exactly. So, when you look at the career choices and family choices women make, their earnings are going to be different.
840269685086158852 2017-03-10 18:34:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey And, it would have been interesting to see the baby geese get down from that high nest tower.
840269521059512320 2017-03-10 18:33:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Well, that would have been interesting, but not as interesting as Iris and Louis!
840267661611261954 2017-03-10 18:26:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren I like independent thinking people.  I've never been into the sheep mentality.  You go, Girl!
840266623764299777 2017-03-10 18:22:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren @samadizayee I thought all liberals were pro-choice. I choose to wear red on any day I fell like it, not when I'm told to.
840255996203261952 2017-03-10 17:40:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC AAAAHHHHH!  OK, I get it. THank you.
840255476751314944 2017-03-10 17:38:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I'm not even sure what a meme is, LOL!
840255085179523072 2017-03-10 17:36:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC That's OK.  I'll pass on that one. But, I have eaten alligator and it tastes like...wait for it......chicken!
840254884800843776 2017-03-10 17:35:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @MarianneOno The article I read about it said she was a nanny. That's why I said that.
840245418520907776 2017-03-10 16:58:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC The funniest part is the nanny thinking she can't be seen on camera.
840235988010053633 2017-03-10 16:20:45 UTC <alclubb1967> When did we become a nation of victims? Everyone can find something to complain about.Try being grateful for the good things in your life.
840229376205692930 2017-03-10 15:54:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC "Look my child and see if anyone has loved you more than I have". I don't believe anyone can answer this question with a "yes".
840228511415689216 2017-03-10 15:51:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC His arms stretched out to embrace you,His head bent down to give the kiss of peace,His side open to receive you into His heart.
840227237467213828 2017-03-10 15:45:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Lovely!  Here is a graphic I made up from one of the meditations of St. Alphonsus de Liguori on Good Friday.pic.twitter.com/j7d28gyVpV
840226114178076672 2017-03-10 15:41:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @mollyann_hesser If you do a comparison on same jobs/experience, the pay difference is negligible. Must do apples/apples.
840223872427388928 2017-03-10 15:32:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @mollyann_hesser I agree. They are embarrassing. Seems they want to find every possible issue to be a victim of.
840191778758234114 2017-03-10 13:25:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @dattwell1 If you want to find everything in the world to be a victim about, go for it.  You have drunk the Kool Aid.  #InstaBlock
840189064213069824 2017-03-10 13:14:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @LifeZette @alclubb1967 @dattwell1 But we have all our rights.  What's to protest?
839944986812628995 2017-03-09 21:04:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Is she using Snapchat so her posts disappear just like her emails?  Just asking!
839943573533511680 2017-03-09 20:58:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I'm a cat lover. Please don't insult crazy cat ladies by comparing them to this lunatic. My cats have better sense than her.
839907003359178752 2017-03-09 18:33:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @Maginary1_ Most of those claims are not backed up by hard evidence. The study I posted does apples/apples comparison; a true comparison.
839904406728499200 2017-03-09 18:23:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @Maginary1_ http://www.payscale.com/gender-lifetime-earnings-gap
839903132410871810 2017-03-09 18:18:06 UTC <alclubb1967> I am so sorry. May God's grace cover you like a comforting mantle and may you rest in His mercy and love.
839902650183397376 2017-03-09 18:16:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @Maginary1_ They may argue that, but it not true in most cases. We don't need anyone else thinking they are a victim.
839891557759209473 2017-03-09 17:32:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @Maginary1_ Who are 2nd class workers?
839867963775778816 2017-03-09 15:58:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Beats me, Father. As a woman that came through the '70's feminist movement unscathed, I still don't know why they are so angry.
839619807129534468 2017-03-08 23:32:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @Stacy4Trump Agreed!
839619243046023172 2017-03-08 23:30:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @Stacy4Trump Apparently they can afford to protest, walk around in costumes and whine about everything. They are angry all the time!
839592997247401985 2017-03-08 21:45:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatt2013 @NaturePH0T0S Either that's an awfully small teddy bear or an awfully big mouse?   The picture of it sleeping is cute.
839589717918236672 2017-03-08 21:32:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @LifeZette Right on target!!!  I, too, don't have anything in common with a bunch of whining anger filled women.
839514786119430148 2017-03-08 16:34:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle It's beginning to look a lot like McMaster is working against Pres. Trump on several fronts.
839491909240377345 2017-03-08 15:04:02 UTC <alclubb1967> I find it very interesting that the software, Quicken, is produced by Intuit, but it is not a very intuitive program to use.
839240576688078849 2017-03-07 22:25:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC There is a lot more to it than people think. "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven", we need to do God's will as saints
839165090691694594 2017-03-07 17:25:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC They didn't eradicate the medical condition, only the children who have it.
839149775358406656 2017-03-07 16:24:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @tskauffmani If they say it's a woman's body, I say the baby is a separate person with its own DNA. A kidney is part of the body, not a baby
839149212130553857 2017-03-07 16:22:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @tskauffmani When they say abortion is legal, I tell them so was slavery. Legal does not mean it's right or moral. Laws can change. 1/2
838833206145208327 2017-03-06 19:26:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @Diamondjn1 I think Satan was trying to verify if Jesus was the Son of God because he kept saying "IF you are the Son of God".
838794341359439872 2017-03-06 16:52:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC That's exactly the argument I used when discussing abortion w/my pro-choice relatives.
838535865165053952 2017-03-05 23:45:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle And there was no state law to prevent it!
838516523224399872 2017-03-05 22:28:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC So, Father, you don't like cats or kale?
838515723282579459 2017-03-05 22:25:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC OK, I'll accept your expertise in Church matters, but I take exception this "hate speech" regarding cats, LOL! Cats are great!!
838481061751504901 2017-03-05 20:07:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrancisXRocca @EdmundPAdamus That is very interesting.
838473767269580801 2017-03-05 19:38:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @BetteMidler Homicides means the person died; all the rest survived their gun shot wounds. It's easy to Google the meaning of homicide.
838473068980895744 2017-03-05 19:35:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @ConnieHarbuck1 Agree!
838455641257701377 2017-03-05 18:26:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @ConnieHarbuck1 Don't lose heart. That's what they want us to do. It's an effort to make people lose faith in Trump, lessening his support.
838455022232944641 2017-03-05 18:23:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @ConnieHarbuck1 OH, I agree.  IMHO, it's a coordinated effort to undermine Trump's presidency. The leakers need to be found and fired.
838453983354191872 2017-03-05 18:19:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @ConnieHarbuck1 What are you concerned about?
838428151369904128 2017-03-05 16:37:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I admire him for standing firm in his faith and displaying it via the ashes (plural) on  his forehead.
838212569953349634 2017-03-04 02:20:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Some of us have chronic health issues which gives us the opportunity for redemptive suffering. My suffering may help someone.
838188342927888384 2017-03-04 00:44:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I was going to order this for my grandsons, but it's $75.89 + $6.99 shipping. Being on Social Security, I can't spend that much
838145182457528320 2017-03-04 21:52:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @wordpressdotcom @FrMatthewLC That s so cool!
838134291792003072 2017-03-04 21:09:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Just finished "The Count of Monte Cristo". All 117 chapters!!!
838133540944498688 2017-03-04 21:06:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I love to read but can't do much because of eyes, but I listen to audio books. Free classics onhttp://Librivox.org
838108140755378178 2017-03-04 19:25:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @brmartin91 @FrancisXRocca @thumpmomma I know.  It truly is sad when 90% of what comes out of the Vatican today is confusing.
838105820520976385 2017-03-04 19:16:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @DiamondandSilk I hope something happens soon. These leaks are causing damage to our President. Find d those traitors!
838101090944040961 2017-03-04 18:57:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Either you stand up for Biblical truth or you must stop calling yourself a Christian. Jesus did not bend to social pressure.
838047164123262976 2017-03-04 15:23:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren @townhallcom Did they also supply the tools to do it with?  Maybe a new government program call "Saw Fast and Furious".
838046912980860928 2017-03-04 15:22:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Well, as a person who is 90% vegetarian, I have a really hard time coming up with an alternative to no meat on Friday.
838046639482892289 2017-03-04 15:21:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC That makes as much sense as most of the stuff coming from the left.  Thanks for the morning laugh, Father.
838031069786095616 2017-03-04 14:19:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrancisXRocca @brmartin91 Well if that is a correct quote then there is something that I can agree with Pope Francis on!
837799661742276613 2017-03-03 22:59:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Glad all went well. Now, don't overdo it and get well!
837700271002300416 2017-03-03 16:24:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrancisXRocca @brmartin91 @JohnLAllenJr Great interview!
837670210261897216 2017-03-03 14:25:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Just did it, Father. God bless!
837133556619030533 2017-03-01 02:52:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @YouTube @MrJoshuaRogers If you want to have a 10th anniversary, you might want to delete that video, LOL!
837100315610656768 2017-03-01 00:40:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @brmartin91 @protectthepope @Johnthemadmonk It was up when I clicked on the link in the article just now.
836612680001732609 2017-02-28 16:23:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC How about, "Working on being a saint."
836605014219112448 2017-02-28 15:52:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @TuckerCarlson Same argument slave holders used B4 Civil War. Non-slaves could not compete w/slave labor. Citizens can't compete w/illegals
836571107662655489 2017-02-28 13:37:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @MrJoshuaRogers What a beautiful article! Thank you giving me that gift today.
836263089372868608 2017-02-27 17:13:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatt2013 Stand strong, Father. We need priests who are willing to tell the truth. Remember what Jesus said about the world in John 15:18
835914489853853697 2017-02-26 18:08:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @patsajak @twisted147 No we didn't. We got on with our lives like grown ups.
835891514362462210 2017-02-26 16:37:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin Maybe someone should donate a dictionary to the NYT because they don't seem to know the definition of "truth".
835879289786621952 2017-02-26 15:48:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin They are a bunch of angry ugly women who make life harder for those of us who actually like men and like being feminine.
835878745458290690 2017-02-26 15:46:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @womensmarch Why are you people so angry all the time? What are you trying to prove? I am truly tired of hearing you rage about everything!
835593594539032576 2017-02-25 20:53:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @AgnesClaire Of course it's hosted by CNN. Are the paid protesters going to disrupt this town hall? I'm betting they don't!
835569170993537025 2017-02-25 19:16:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @JamesMartinSJ It would be more merciful to help these children work through their confusion re:gender than enable it.
835558415451766786 2017-02-25 18:33:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrJoshMiller @FrMatt2013 That's right. Jesus said if the world hates you remember it hated Him first. That's good company!
835545967223062528 2017-02-25 17:44:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @FoxNews @ConnieHarbuck1 Because of left wing liberal politics that allows and encourages law breaking with no consequences.
835544271402979331 2017-02-25 17:37:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @FoxNews @RealJamesWoods None of this has to do with changing their positions or listening to the people but only with a new way to cheat.
835543267538321408 2017-02-25 17:33:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @FoxNews @ConnieHarbuck1 Anyone who does not understand the dangers of open borders is purposely refusing to do so.
835524693880934400 2017-02-25 16:19:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Maybe he doesn't like that church! Just kidding, LOL!
835522059769896960 2017-02-25 16:09:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @AwakeDeborah @Toupsfamily Maybe @JamesMartinSJ should listen to his Jesuit Pope.
835521188424265731 2017-02-25 16:05:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor As if Obama didn't favor news outlets that agreed with him. He is the one who said Fox News wasn't real.
835278254017810432 2017-02-24 00:00:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Also, anyone who protested on site should have cleaned up all the garbage they left behind that will pollute the water!
835277743067652096 2017-02-24 23:58:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle No good can come from this! Disappointing move.
835256031328497668 2017-02-24 22:32:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @TuckerCarlson @FrMatthewLC Liberals have never let facts get in the way if their arguments. Saying it doesn't change your chromosomes.
835246406180941825 2017-02-24 21:53:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Some are just fake but there are people who are into Satanic worship and that is very dangerous.
835196437034123266 2017-02-24 18:35:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @KimKimmary @ToupsFamily @bishop_callahan Exactly!
835173330567192577 2017-02-24 17:03:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @bishop_callahan @Toupsfamily 99.9% of the U.S. is not transgender. All of them have the right to privacy in locker/changing/bath rooms.
835162863450849280 2017-02-24 16:21:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain So much for caring about the environment! Again they are showing their hypocrisy!
834950969972699136 2017-02-23 02:19:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @MussoFrankGrill @RealJamesWoods What a fabulous place!
834862941430243329 2017-02-23 20:30:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I knew the couldn't argue with facts. Now they can't even live with them. Truly unhinged!
834862418463428609 2017-02-23 20:28:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatt2013 Bravo, Father! We need more courageous priests like you to do fraternal correction. I've been fighting this battle since 1978.
834845921330475008 2017-02-23 19:22:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @DouthatNYT @JamesMartinSJ @FrMatthewLC The Church said the Bible=inspired Word of God. God does not lie. Why do some want to discredit it?
834833289710026752 2017-02-23 18:32:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods That is almost as funny as the lemur/Eric Holder photos.
834832772384567296 2017-02-23 18:30:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @obianuju @USCCB @ToupsFamily @AwakeDeborah I agree. He is encouraging the enabling of a disorder.
834788859175120897 2017-02-23 15:35:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @DouthatNYT @JamesMartinSJ Matthew and John were certainly eye witnesses. And they had better than tape recorders. They had the Holy Spirit.
834778300862038016 2017-02-23 14:53:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @DouthatNYT @JamesMartinSJ Some of there were & they were certainly closer to the action than anyone today. I heard this stuff in the '70s.
834759468147675137 2017-02-23 13:39:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @Streamdotorg @MCITLFrAphorism Let's call them what they really are, non-Catholics!
834595170817564672 2017-02-22 02:46:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Reading  P & P can turn you into a zombie
834545099707129856 2017-02-22 23:27:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @FormTheCulture Then why did he feel the need to write a book explaining it?
834485422650699777 2017-02-22 19:30:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @brmartin91 Well, actually, we do know what he said since we believe that the Bible is inspired by the Holy Spirit and it is true.
834218578589130752 2017-02-21 01:49:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @nytimes @2SmallToFail @ChelseaClinton How can that be since you pro-choice people keep saying it's a bunch of unviable cells and not human!
834177861464514560 2017-02-21 23:07:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Liberal logic!  Oh wait, that's an oxymoron.
834121195159224321 2017-02-21 19:22:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @AwakeDeborah Exactly!  The only person in the Bible who questioned the definition of truth was Pontius Pilate.
834120318381862912 2017-02-21 19:19:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @PhyllisSchlafly Liberal logic is an oxymoron.
834119816080416769 2017-02-21 19:17:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @AwakeDeborah You don't walk into a Chinese restaurant and force them to make enchiladas. Don't force the Church to change.
834045427855011841 2017-02-21 14:21:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Maybe @ChelseaClinton should be a little more careful before making fun of our President. Sweden is having major problems.
833773881055932416 2017-02-20 20:22:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @bitterclingerpa You're right, but I still expect the Church to be above politics and not mired in the mud with it.
833773175968321536 2017-02-20 20:19:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @JZmirak Pretty well until the 1960's. The Church got sucked into the revolutionary mind set.
833772382326231041 2017-02-20 20:16:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @TruthinGov2016 @Toupsfamily But, we came so close that it's scary.
833771898676846592 2017-02-20 20:14:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @JZmirak Yes, and usually taken out of context.
833770741548068864 2017-02-20 20:10:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @JZmirak I think it is the same liberal arm of the Church that mucked things up after Vatican II.
833765935395852290 2017-02-20 19:51:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @JZmirak @Toupsfamily This is unbelievable that the Church is encouraging civil disorder and protection of illegals & unvetted immigrants.
833759131722977280 2017-02-20 19:24:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @disciple96 @Toupsfamily Great question!
833751758581166080 2017-02-20 18:54:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @patsajak If you werein the  Bill Murray movie, you would have to do that march over and over and over!
833714012688879616 2017-02-20 16:24:44 UTC <alclubb1967> For those trashing the First Lady for reading the Lord's Prayer, maybe she normally prays in one of the other 5 languages she knows.
833693979535405056 2017-02-20 15:05:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @ConnieHarbuck1 I sent you a direct message.
833435255533080587 2017-02-19 21:57:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @ConnieHarbuck1 Love your bluebonnet photo on your profile. I live in Texas also.
833434284539133955 2017-02-19 21:53:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @ConnieHarbuck1 Me too, because, obviously I can't tell the difference, LOL!
833433433636499458 2017-02-19 21:49:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @ConnieHarbuck1 I didn't know that.  Thanks for the heads up. I undid my retweet.
833415742313885696 2017-02-19 20:39:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @Ritlabs Help! After a recent update to The Bat, now my emails are printing in a tiny font that can't be read. Update to 7.4.12 didn't help.
833414695042301952 2017-02-19 20:35:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @DiamondandSilk Why are y'all wearing your Trump pins backwards? I must have missed it.  Thanks.
833414234914570242 2017-02-19 20:33:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @ChelseaClinton It all depends on what your definition of "last night" is. Ask your Dad about the definition of the word "is".
833328763609948160 2017-02-19 14:53:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @ShannonBream @ShepNewsTeam @FoxNews @MagaUSA1 @FrankDagostino1 I guess you are right! :(
833328182979878912 2017-02-19 14:51:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Any doughnut is worth trying. Funny that spelling doughnut correctly triggers spell check. We are doomed!
833314593225265153 2017-02-19 13:57:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @washingtonpost @IngrahamAngle Trump is not trying to silence the press. He's trying to get them to report accurately and truthfully.
833040539033427968 2017-02-18 19:48:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @chiara_sc Yes, we have lots of Romano cheese sprinkled on our minestrone soup, and, really pretty much everything, LOL!
833029352866607109 2017-02-18 19:04:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I truly believed I would get a horse for Christmas. On Christmas morning I would run to look out the back door.
833028772060418059 2017-02-18 19:01:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @chiara_sc I am 100% Italian and I use kale in my minestrone soup!
832995779518332929 2017-02-18 16:50:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @fritatalover @JanosMedyx Wow, that looks great.  I just happen to have some kale in the refrigerator. Multo bene!
832994330596036611 2017-02-18 16:44:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @frmikeschmitz @FrMatthewLC @Viti_95 Perfect!  Every day I ask the Holy Spirit to help me be the saint He wants me to be.
832993515550437380 2017-02-18 16:41:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @BreitbartNews @PrisonPlanet @AwakeDeborah Pope Benedict was right on target on many things. We need his clarity right now.
832992445734481920 2017-02-18 16:37:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @Maginary1_ I make my Italian Frittata with whatever veggie I have leftover, i.e. cauliflower, green beans, bell pepper, potatoes.
832787897912848384 2017-02-17 03:04:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods That is just embarrassing and gross.
832750675029225474 2017-02-17 00:36:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @Maginary1_ I agree 100%. I made minestrone soup with kale tonight.
832691638807916544 2017-02-17 20:42:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC LOL!
832675839468724224 2017-02-17 19:39:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC You just have never had it cooked properly. Now, brussels sprouts - ugh, that's another story. #saynotobrusselssprouts
832675534786015235 2017-02-17 19:38:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Awwwww, come on!  Some of us really like greens of all kinds: kale, turnip greens, collard greens, cabbage. Lots of vitamins.
832674164582412288 2017-02-17 19:32:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @LaraLeaTrump I stand with Ivanka! These are the same hypocrites who said you couldn't hold Bill C's actions against Hillary.
832673740961951745 2017-02-17 19:31:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @weaselzippers Why don't they wear glitter rainbow colored burquas and offend Muslims?
832663355936501760 2017-02-17 18:49:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain Considering how wrong the polls were this time, I'm guessing he would beat her by 20 points.
832642709290512386 2017-02-17 17:27:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I hope so. I lived through the misinformation/faulty interpretations of Vatican II. We are still paying for that.
832637018517630977 2017-02-17 17:05:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC OK, I get it that some don't like kale. I do, but man does not live on kale alone, but a variety of things. One man's kale ...
832634285437751298 2017-02-17 16:54:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods LOL!  That did it.  We had Hilldebeast and now we have Pussyshumer.  Sounds like a James Bond movie.
832632750746148865 2017-02-17 16:48:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC It's time for a teaching moment. Catechesis is overdue on many issues. It's the Church's duty to teach as well as show mercy.
832620825534566401 2017-02-17 16:00:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @FormTheCulture Is that like a parent allowing his child to do drugs in his bedroom because the child can't control his impulses?
832620247295209473 2017-02-17 15:58:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @KPHodgkiss Read Corinthians 11:27. St. Paul makes it plain that we must not receive Communion when not in the proper state.
832603052679032833 2017-02-17 14:50:11 UTC <alclubb1967> Trust God = accept His will = peace = joy. Put aside all human resistance and just believe that God will help you through any difficulty.
832602477656735745 2017-02-17 14:47:54 UTC <alclubb1967> Joy is knowing you are where God wants you to be and He will help you with every difficulty along the way. Trust Him!
832601831385792513 2017-02-17 14:45:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @KPHodgkiss It says to the children that choices have consequences;respect for the Holy Eucharist outweighs human feelings.
832601412727078912 2017-02-17 14:43:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I like kale, Fr., but I know what you mean. Every cross is a chance to grow in virtue, to trust God, and to accept His Will.
832600774630920192 2017-02-17 14:41:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle I don't think the Constitution requires that the President ask them questions. It only guarantees them the right to answer.
832408914469740545 2017-02-16 01:58:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Is there no limit to the stupid things that come out of her mouth?
832338835514200064 2017-02-16 21:20:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC 3/3 Keep on walking, moving forward, trying for the goal. Dont try to stop on the way, or to go back, or to deviate from it.
832338796960215040 2017-02-16 21:20:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC 2/3 Be always unhappy about what you are if you want to reach what you are not.  If you say; It is enough, you are lost.
832338528193359873 2017-02-16 21:19:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC 1/3 St. Augustine said: ON earth we are wayfarers, always on the go. This means that we have to keep on moving forward.
832051345813286912 2017-02-15 02:17:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I remember when life really was like Leave It To Beaver!
832033187018711044 2017-02-15 01:05:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @brmartin91 Maybe the last choice should have been "all of the above". Hope I am wrong.
831963881744523265 2017-02-15 20:30:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC This world is a celebration of everything deviant. Christians are being bombarded from all sides. St. Michael, pray for us
831963330172637185 2017-02-15 20:28:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Yes, abomination is the right word.  I was struggling and settled on sacrilegious, but abomination is much better.
831962463771963392 2017-02-15 20:24:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC This is sacrilegious on so many levels. They obviously don't know that burning palms will ONLY produce "plain grey ashes".
831925723745177605 2017-02-15 17:58:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC It's all about votes:  black vs white women vs unborn legal vs illegal atheist vs believer sex vs abstinence SSM vs marriage
831909918647152641 2017-02-15 16:55:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @cnalive @FrMatthewLC The obsession of the leftists to get rid of people hinges on their desire to use resources for others of their choice.
831883572864761858 2017-02-15 15:11:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @jlcrosby031 I like Twitter and I am 71 years old, but it also has its limitations and can be easily misconstrued.
831883065777647616 2017-02-15 15:09:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomHoopes @FrMatthewLC Could you please tell that to the many bishops that are discounting everything that went before Amoris Laetitia?
831881121419886592 2017-02-15 15:01:29 UTC <alclubb1967> Joy is knowing that we are where God wants us to be. Embrace God's will and make the most of it. Don't miss the chance to grow in holiness.
831695314558009344 2017-02-14 02:43:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Yeah, I'm not seeing the high cheek bones from her "Native American" heritage.
831656592282103808 2017-02-14 00:09:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @brmartin91 Cupich is the last person I would want a clarification from. I agree, why is it so hard to get an answer.
831203490852642817 2017-02-13 18:08:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @FormTheCulture This means nothing since they are a group of the Pope's hand picked buddies.
831200097270644736 2017-02-13 17:55:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @brmartin91 I'm not a fan of Pope Francis, but I don't have any reason to think he doesn't.
831167212333432834 2017-02-13 15:44:40 UTC <alclubb1967> Interesting that the women who said we couldn't blame Hillary for Bill's actions are now punishing Ivanka for her father. Hypocrites!
831166987258716161 2017-02-13 15:43:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @IvankaTrump @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews Great statement. Ivanka is a inspiration to women everywhere.
830863267484598272 2017-02-12 19:36:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @TJMastersson @annepaezNOLA I don't know. I pray for him to clarify and correct any confusion surrounding Church teachings.
830863079617474561 2017-02-12 19:36:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @annepaezNOLA @TJMastersson They are included in my prayers and I ask God to guide them in leading this country.
830861817429770240 2017-02-12 19:31:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @TJMastersson @annepaezNOLA Prayer is always the best answer. I pray for our Pope, bishops, and all priests daily.
830861661389090816 2017-02-12 19:30:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @TJMastersson @annepaezNOLA Agree. I'm saying it's easy to make judgments on things we read about instead of knowing for sure.
830861170064101377 2017-02-12 19:28:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @annepaezNOLA @TJMastersson I understand the difference. IMHO, the call on the "fruit" is still open. Not fully decided yet
830860536262844418 2017-02-12 19:26:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @annepaezNOLA @TJMastersson It is God's place to judge the person's heart, not ours.
830860437046624259 2017-02-12 19:25:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @annepaezNOLA @TJMastersson True, but since we can't be in another person's heart, we can't say what his intentions are. 1/2
830859242848579585 2017-02-12 19:20:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @annepaezNOLA @TJMastersson Yes, between good and evil, but not the intentions of another. Easy to be a back seat driver.
830858389957836801 2017-02-12 19:17:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @TJMastersson @annepaezNOLA I believe we must be careful in our critique while not being judgmental.
830841180317433856 2017-02-12 18:09:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @MikePenceVP Yes, Mr. VP, they are against any laws that they personally don't agree with. They operate on emotions and not rational thought
830839906863874048 2017-02-12 18:04:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @annepaezNOLA @TJMastersson I don't understand your POV. Pope Benedict was faithful to and upheld Catholic teachings.
830822068660948993 2017-02-12 16:53:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @patsajak I think they are now understanding the phrase "walk a mile in my shoes" that the rest of us felt for the past 8 years.
830805401251827712 2017-02-12 15:46:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @theresamacc But, the Liturgy of the Word does not consist of just the homily. There is the Scripture, hence the capital "W".
830772709000900608 2017-02-12 13:37:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @protectthepope @brmartin91 I've lived under 7 Pope's (Pius XII-Francis) and I've never seen confusion/chaos like now. Holy Spirit, help us
830771072702242816 2017-02-12 13:30:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @VescovoDDK Thank you for reinforcing that, Bishop! Some seem to need reminding right now.
830498760786575365 2017-02-11 19:28:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain This country will never be safe and peaceful until protesters breaking the law are held accountable and laws are enforced.
830459088295325700 2017-02-11 16:50:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @PaulStrandCBN @Toupsfamily @CBNNews @700club Look how peaceful they are. No breaking windows, burning things or blocking traffic.
830458707481919492 2017-02-11 16:49:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Very sad. I thought Benedict XVI was a humble, thoughtful, brilliant theologian who was a humble, thoughtful, brilliant Pope.
830157541220970496 2017-02-10 20:52:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Fetuses are not gender confused, but they can feel pain and she still wants to abort them. Liberals never worry about facts.
830118723008741378 2017-02-10 18:18:21 UTC <alclubb1967> Joy  happiness. Happiness is momentary gratification. Joy is the firm belief that we are one with God no matter what is happening.
830088027317891072 2017-02-10 16:16:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @LaStampa @walford_stephen @FrMatthewLC That only works if the Pope responds to the Holy Spirit. He still has a free will, doesn't he?
830048712563027968 2017-02-10 13:40:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump I voted for you, I support your agenda, but please stop tweeting about everything. We know the MSM lies.
829830418069340160 2017-02-09 23:12:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @MikePenceVP How about not caring that Hillary was selling access to the State Dept and having classified info on her unsecured hacked PC
829765868510908417 2017-02-09 18:56:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @Femail @ToupsFamily Actually, I'll change that wording from "required" to "allowed". Most women are denied the opportunity to see this.
829765672062296065 2017-02-09 18:55:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @Femail @ToupsFamily If only ultrasounds and MRIs were required before any abortion. Pro-aborts don't want women to see their babies.
829755656072736770 2017-02-09 18:15:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @elisemikenna @ToupsFamily @saneaustinite Exactly! That's what I've saying for years.
829720862127452162 2017-02-09 15:57:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @GeorgeTakei As opposed to a billionaire friend of Iran, a puppet of the teachers union, and a race baiting activist.
829716896090116096 2017-02-09 15:41:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Many Catholics/Catholic politicians do just that. I am Catholic before anything else. It's my identity not just my religion.
829686595519447040 2017-02-09 13:41:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Being in D.C. for years doesn't make a person good at their job. He's been "acting" for 62 yrs. and still isn't good at it.
829483956915544065 2017-02-08 00:16:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC All of us adapt. It's part of growing and maturing. And life requires it.
829482235019612161 2017-02-08 00:09:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Adaption may need to happen on both sides. It is not healthy for young people to expect all to adapt for them.
829481497983844352 2017-02-08 00:06:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I'm sorry for your experience. None of that should have happened. I was coming from a corporate environment perspective
829478613959528448 2017-02-08 23:54:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC The article is making broad generalizations. No HR department in today's world would allow abusive behavior in the work place.
829477545032683525 2017-02-08 23:50:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I think it's wrong to let young people expect the world to adapt to their sensitive natures. Most bosses are not abusive.
829401973715763202 2017-02-08 18:50:14 UTC <alclubb1967> Oh, Lord, help me to remember that every trial or difficulty I face is an opportunity to perfect the virtues I need in order to do Your will
829120642855346176 2017-02-07 00:12:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @TwitterSafety Great. Now could we please have an increase in the 140 character limit. That is way out of date and needs fixing
829023761097695232 2017-02-07 17:47:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @patrickmadrid @FrMatthewLC @megagerdes I'm sure we would. And, yes, Twitter should at least allow a few more characters.
829010665218199554 2017-02-07 16:55:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @patrickmadrid @FrMatthewLC @megagerdes Yes, thank God for Patrick Madrid, Scott Hahn, Fr. Groeschel, etc. Those are not parish homilists.
829008531827339265 2017-02-07 16:46:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @megagerdes @mitkw They should also be in line with Church teaching. I've heard homilies in opposition to doctrine.
829007587119136768 2017-02-07 16:43:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @megagerdes Converts should come through RCIA where Mass is explained. Theologically sound homilies are great. Not all are.
828970861315108864 2017-02-07 14:17:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I agree, but if the words chosen create confusion, isn't it the Pope's duty to clear up the confusion?
828964888869486592 2017-02-07 13:53:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @FoxNews @dcexaminer @foxnewspolitics So what's the problem. Isn't that what the left wants us all to do so the illegals can stay here?
828964312765100032 2017-02-07 13:51:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @megagerdes Through catechesis. The homily may or may not be a teaching tool. We have to value the Mass even with poor homilies
828690664657395713 2017-02-06 19:43:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor They want to do the same thing with illegal aliens as they have done with everything else. Rename it so it sounds nicer.
828628907196870656 2017-02-06 15:38:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Then they are putting their faith in a man and not in  God. The Mass does not depend on a good homily.
828626389498748928 2017-02-06 15:28:21 UTC <alclubb1967> 2/2  Oh Lord, let your grace flow over me like a comforting mantle and let me rest in Your mercy and love. Amen.
828626313405747201 2017-02-06 15:28:02 UTC <alclubb1967> 1/2  Help me, Oh Lord, for I am weak and without Your help I can do nothing.
828442931522580481 2017-02-05 03:19:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC My car is 7 years old and only has 29,000 miles on it. We will be keeping it for a long time!
828390463422025729 2017-02-05 23:50:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily Me either.
828376052506435584 2017-02-05 22:53:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @LeeBeth7 Nice photo. I've watched turkey vulture nest. They are very interesting but not as aggressive as black vultures.
828361861179592705 2017-02-05 21:57:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @TomiLahren I was wondering that myself.  I'm sure more people are watching the Super Bowl than did the Golden Globes or Oscars combined.
828265668168601606 2017-02-05 15:34:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle These RINOs will fight Trump just as much as the Dems. We don't just need 8 Dem votes. We need 52 Rep. votes on our side.
828250290428248065 2017-02-05 14:33:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC It's because puppies are guilt free and non-political.
828017179538948097 2017-02-04 23:07:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @vapourwaver Love the way you change subjects.
828016349335138304 2017-02-04 23:04:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @vapourwaver I am not recommending it. Abstinence is fool proof, even for fools.
828015601478156289 2017-02-04 23:01:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @vapourwaver Oh, and by saying they're "gone", is that the same as they are dead? Out of sight, out of mind thought process?
828015405574807553 2017-02-04 23:00:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @vapourwaver Abortion does not eliminate poverty. Don't have sex if you can't afford a child. Plenty of birth control methods.
828014166669668352 2017-02-04 22:55:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @vapourwaver You are arguing apples and oranges. Why not add in everyone who dies from cancer or heart disease?
828010148908113922 2017-02-04 22:39:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @vapourwaver Monetary situations can change but death is final. Nothing outweighs the intentional murder of a child.
828008637910097920 2017-02-04 22:33:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @vapourwaver Percentage of abortions due to rape ranges from .6 - 1%. You talked about supporting a baby. I responded to that.
828001607178653697 2017-02-04 22:05:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Father, we haven't had real objective journalism in a very long. Most confuse "reporter" with "opinion commentator".

827196307404095489 2017-02-02 16:45:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @CatholicLeague He's right.  The First Amendment does not say we can only practice our religion inside a church building.

825051037522329600 2017-01-27 18:41:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Exactly. Slavery was legal and so was rounding up and exterminating the Jews in Germany under Hitler.

824302303867977729 2017-01-25 17:05:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @chelseahandler Another example of the "tolerant" left. Being a bully must be part of the initiation in your gang of libs. Grow up!

823630882334445570 2017-01-23 20:37:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Funny that the PP supporters cry about women's health issues but get upset when we give money to health clinics minus abortion.

823185544356265984 2017-01-22 15:08:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump Well, I agree, but the operative word there is "peaceful". The protests in D.C. were violent and destructive.
823185312616775681 2017-01-22 15:07:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Why were they marching? What rights don't they have? They are the only group of people where murder is sanctioned.

823166986343550977 2017-01-22 13:54:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily This is not only sad and shameful, but it is scandalous. This march was pro-abortion. That alone overrides everything else.
822887983506489344 2017-01-21 19:25:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Some things never change - Bill's proclivity for young women and Hillary's lying. What a pair!

821826335752552448 2017-01-18 21:07:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Liberals never let the facts stand in the way. They just say it, keep repeating and hope the "stupid" people will believe it.
821823135280459776 2017-01-18 20:54:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson I saw it. It was excellent. At the end, he almost couldn't keep a straight face.

821763349511831554 2017-01-18 16:57:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods They're worried about hacking the DNC but it's OK to pardon Manning who endangered lives by giving out state secrets.
821762469626605569 2017-01-18 16:53:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @americamag @ntnsndr I agree. Just this past Sunday I told my husband the same thing. Sometimes it seems like they keep repeating too much.

821501604193046529 2017-01-17 23:36:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle WOW!  That's a very arrogant statement about people who don't even live in the real world or associate with the rest of us.
821500604086419456 2017-01-17 23:33:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @SpeakerRyan @Justamegamom Speaker Ryan, Hillary Clinton did the same thing and Obama said she did nothing wrong. See a pattern?
821459647114727426 2017-01-17 20:50:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Of course. When the entire mainstream media is so liberal/left/anti-religion, they will only cover subjects they agree with.
821419002501140480 2017-01-17 18:08:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Clinton mugs won't sell and Clinton World Initiative is going broke.  See a pattern here??
821418416754085888 2017-01-17 18:06:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods At least with the insulated drinking glass you can remove the inner liner and put in something more attractive.
821417636349284355 2017-01-17 18:03:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @TheLeeGreenwood Bravo to you for writing such a wonderful song and for singing it as inspiringly as you do. Make us all proud this week.
821403350906322945 2017-01-17 17:06:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods That's what happens when you embrace U.S. instead of vilify it; want jobs here instead of want illegals here.
821401600132608001 2017-01-17 16:59:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @patsajak I don't think they want things to be better. In order to have victims, they have to create an offense. Facts don't matter.
821397633440894977 2017-01-17 16:43:51 UTC <alclubb1967> Lord, those are Your best servants who wish to shape their life on Your answers rather than shape Your answers on their wishes.St. Augustine
821390643352236033 2017-01-17 16:16:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin Maybe someone should tell China who is teaching their boys to be boys! Maybe we could get the Chinese to teach our kids.
821389896904491009 2017-01-17 16:13:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @annie3592 You described it perfectly. We were taught that in my girls Catholic school. Their motto was to produce "typically lovely ladies"
821354750507679747 2017-01-17 13:53:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @annie3592 Hope this one goes well for you. Prayers coming your way.
821151082718105601 2017-01-16 00:24:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @SpeakerRyan @joss Can't figure out how this tweet complies with Twitter's strict policies. Oh yeah, you're a liberal a**. Rules don't apply
821147812528320513 2017-01-16 00:11:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @Jonathan_Cahn @Toupsfamily Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!

821091558258778113 2017-01-16 20:27:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @annie3592 So many have forgotten that we live in the world but we are not of the world. It is inspiring to see priests/nuns wearing habits.
821090087324807168 2017-01-16 20:21:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @dezeen @annie3592 Yep, that's what we need. Religious habits that fit in with the world instead of pointing away from the world.
821054387523096580 2017-01-16 17:59:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin How did that happen? San Francisco is a sanctuary city. I thought anyone was safe from arrest out there.
821053511903379456 2017-01-16 17:56:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @CDerespina @foxnewspolitics @brian_pinks Clintons blame anyone except themselves for everything, going all the way back to Ark. days.
821052233433436162 2017-01-16 17:51:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Right! Pay no attention to the server behind the curtain that has little or no security. Just blame anyone who catches us.
821051514433273857 2017-01-16 17:48:30 UTC <alclubb1967> Interesting that China wants her boys to be boys and the U.S. thinks it's OK for them to use the ladies bathrooms. http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/16/china-fights-masculinity-crisis-with-new-textbook-for-boys.html
821051110890807296 2017-01-16 17:46:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Exactly!
821050980682924032 2017-01-16 17:46:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @RealJamesWoods When you find out, James, tell me so I can donate also. Laura would be stellar!
821050815196565506 2017-01-16 17:45:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @CDerespina @foxnewspolitics I guess the Clinton's charities are not worth as much as access to government information from Sec. of State.
821024700956626946 2017-01-16 16:01:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @DrBrianKiczek St. Joseph is my special patron. Devotion to him should be encouraged and fostered. He was the closest person to Jesus&Mary.

820805156950446080 2017-01-15 01:29:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin He said they got the bill. He didn't say whose money he used to pay those bills! Really, toilet paper, toothpaste and OJ?
820780245041250304 2017-01-15 23:50:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @TalladegaColleg Congratulations on going. I admire you for standing firm in the face of so many negative assaults. I donated to your fund.
820696427714269184 2017-01-15 18:17:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Can we get more of them to stay home, along with the protesters?
820695571040235520 2017-01-15 18:14:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @akrw_designs @annie3592 I liked it because he showed kids it was OK to be kind, plus it was very quiet and put my kids to sleep, LOL!
820694408853155840 2017-01-15 18:09:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @akrw_designs @annie3592 My favorite was Mr. Rogers!

820690648647008256 2017-01-15 17:54:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @annie3592 Thank you!
820690502752342018 2017-01-15 17:53:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Put Michelle Obama in charge of it and let her do to SNAP what she did to school lunch programs.
820674750565515268 2017-01-15 16:51:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @ccpecknold @Justamegamom Thank you!  And I am also a Trekkie, so Vulcan salute right back at you.
820674596634554373 2017-01-15 16:50:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @ccpecknold Augustine is one of my all time favorite saints. He can say more in one sentence than most can in an entire book.
820673897548877825 2017-01-15 16:47:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @ccpecknold @Justamegamom LOL! Yes, I had my 71st birthday yesterday. But, I can still see a problem when presented with one.
820673729466421248 2017-01-15 16:47:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @ZionNPS @RealJamesWoods Holy moly!  Glad no one was hurt.  That's pretty massive and scary.
820672977574432771 2017-01-15 16:44:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @ccpecknold @Justamegamom I have lived through 7 popes (Pius XII-Francis). No others have caused chaos/dissent like this.
820672142052311040 2017-01-15 16:41:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump I voted for you, I want you to succeed. But, please just ignore some of this stuff and get on to bigger issues.
820671795548352512 2017-01-15 16:39:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily @pallyden0110 Again, I don't understand the overreach by this Pope. If he thinks this is mercy, he is very naive and mistaken.
820468893374435328 2017-01-14 03:13:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @ccpecknold @Justamegamom Yes because the purpose was to clarify, not confuse. AL was purposely written ambiguously to create loopholes.
820467400328052737 2017-01-14 03:07:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @ccpecknold @Justamegamom Humanae Vitae is clear but Amoris Laetitia is purposely ambiguous and that footnote should never have been added.
820466813347778561 2017-01-14 03:05:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @ccpecknold @Justamegamom I didn't have anyone to tell me differently, but I found out myself several years later when I got a copy of HV.
820464458703269888 2017-01-14 02:55:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @ccpecknold @Justamegamom It's exactly what happened after Humanae Vitae. I was there and was told the exact thing by my pastor.
820462020202008576 2017-01-14 02:46:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @JoyceCarolOates Good! Please keep all the other liberal crybabies home with you. And all the stupid protesters too.
820442464960049152 2017-01-14 01:28:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @Crux @JohnLAllenJr He's right!  The Pope is supposed to be the rudder that keeps us straight, not the tsunami that capsizes us.
820367235541766145 2017-01-14 20:29:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @BoschFawstin Anyone who would criticize an artist for making a profit from their work sound very misguided. Bravo to you! Keep it up!

820314227420393473 2017-01-14 16:58:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @LifeZette @IngrahamAngle That was very powerful and much more gracious than Meryl Streep's arrogant and condescending preaching.
820009030705938432 2017-01-13 20:46:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Hard to tell from that angle, but if it's a bald eagle, it's a juvie.  No white head or tail.
819986796352303105 2017-01-13 19:17:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain He said he was doing it to match what the US does with all immigrants(except the illegal immigrants that he won't deport!)
819724116727132160 2017-01-12 01:53:53 UTC <alclubb1967> Obama will deport any Cuban refugee but no others that come here illegally! What a bunch of political garbage!http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/12/obama-announces-end-to-wet-foot-dry-foot-policy-for-cuban-refugees.html
819668436267700224 2017-01-12 22:12:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @ByronYork Climate change has nothing to do with the CIA. Kamala Harris is nuts.
819668185171496960 2017-01-12 22:11:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods What an idiot!  These people have one agenda, and it's all lunacy!
819607937605898240 2017-01-12 18:12:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @LLBean @crome79 So, don't associate with Linda Bean. Why punish the whole company that employs lots of people?
819607563071352833 2017-01-12 18:10:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @LLBean Individuals in a company are not the same as a corporate policy that all must follow. L.L.Bean did nothing to deserve this.
819375449793056768 2017-01-11 02:48:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @orderofmalta @EdwardPentin Seems pretty clear to me.
819352535907631105 2017-01-11 01:17:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @EdwardPentin Confusion is a seed down by the devil. It is indeed a danger to the Faith for there to be any confusion regarding doctrine.
819273169186017286 2017-01-11 20:01:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain I just donated to their GoFunMe page.
819216257744601092 2017-01-11 16:15:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Refreshing to have an AG who actually upholds the law and not try to use their office for political payback.
819004590322577408 2017-01-10 02:14:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @brmartin91 If you listen to audio books, you can do other work at the same time. Great way to "read" a lot more.
818856661720907776 2017-01-10 16:26:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I cannot even go there. We have reached a new level of depravity in this country. #TheFallofRome

818540112820715520 2017-01-09 19:29:05 UTC <alclubb1967> Here is a math question:  what does 1/2 plus 1/2 equal? According my math, the answer should be "1". Not according to the prescription ins.
818208896166793216 2017-01-08 21:32:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @TheRevdDr Restrained and charitable are not the same. If you had left "foolishly" out of your tweet, we wouldn't be having this discussion
818185080388591617 2017-01-08 19:58:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I will keep you in my prayers. I pray for all priests every day but will mention you specifically!
818157965563793409 2017-01-08 18:10:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump @MeetThePress So, NBC, you got shamed into doing the right thing. When will you learn to just be objective?
818157358350290944 2017-01-08 18:08:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC @TheRevdDr OK, Adrian, we get your point. But are you being charitable in your comments? Charity and indignation rarely coexist

816685513616789504 2017-01-04 16:39:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Obama is the one who encourages hatred and division. This country is more divided since his 8 yrs than ever before!

816476695435898880 2017-01-03 02:49:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I don't understand why some viciously attack people they don't know on Twitter. What is the point?
816404339011026944 2017-01-03 22:02:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods No, I wish it had happened sooner. And, she can take Shepherd Smith with her.
816371959432880128 2017-01-03 19:53:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Very true, Father. Accepting God's will and putting complete trust in Him is a daily struggle. I have to remember 2 Cor.12:9
816371349769908226 2017-01-03 19:51:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Obama has done more damage in his 8 years than in the whole history of the U.S. And, he's not done yet.
816097432069140481 2017-01-02 01:42:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I, for one, am thrilled to have you back on Twitter.
816083752057245697 2017-01-02 00:48:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Holy cow that is a gorgeous car. It makes the word sexy seem obsolete!

815960193456545792 2017-01-02 16:37:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle If only it was 18 days until Obama truly faded off into the sunset. Unfortunately, he will be plotting right down the street.
815959699627642880 2017-01-02 16:35:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX Cool!  But, that baby looks like he needs to get his own apartment, LOL!
815921969640177665 2017-01-02 14:05:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @KellyannePolls I hope y'all have someone monitoring Obama's future plans. He won't go quietly. He can't be trusted. He's still an agitator.
815644025973837824 2017-01-01 19:41:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @Thomas_375 Yes, they certainly tell everyone about what's going on.  I know a lot of people don't like them, but I love them.
815599528200048640 2017-01-01 16:44:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey They are not ospreys, but fun to watch the blue jay feeding frenzy in my backyard:pic.twitter.com/R5OuKdVaeX
815286044224589824 2016-12-31 19:58:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @BadCatholicBlog @FrMatthewLC To me, "gender identity theory" basically says that humans think they know better than God.
815017405730721793 2016-12-30 02:11:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @observer @RealJamesWoods I think that article actually makes some good points.

814613090750922752 2016-12-29 23:24:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @DiamondandSilk Someone needs to ask Obama about his interference with the Israeli election by trying to stop Netenyahu's election!
814565401724067843 2016-12-29 20:15:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @DiamondandSilk You are 100% right. Obama and Kerry didn't protect Israel's back. They did the stabbing!

814169003241406464 2016-12-28 17:59:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily Unfortunately, the childish Obama has done immense harm both domestically and internationally which will be hard to repair.
814168434791608320 2016-12-28 17:57:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics If I never see his botox filled face anymore, it will be too soon. No one in the Obama administration cares about Israel.
814168218965344256 2016-12-28 17:56:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @JohnKerry @RealJamesWoods That verifies that liberals live in a fantasy land. The opposite is true, but don't confuse them with the facts.
814135874501873671 2016-12-28 15:48:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @MaliaMZimmerman Liberal tolerance=oxymoron. Libs are only tolerant of people who agree with them. Someone should give them a dictionary.
814103420449783808 2016-12-28 13:39:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @wordpressdotcom @Twitter @RealJamesWoods Excellent article. Thanks for posting it on Twitter so your followers could see it.

813171836196372480 2016-12-25 23:57:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Beautiful, Father. All of God's blessings on you and your community.
812782746619805696 2016-12-24 22:11:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @JohnKerry What a hypocritical thing to say the day after your Obama admin. betrayed Israel with the abstention. You have no decency.
812764326260047872 2016-12-24 20:58:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @BreitbartNews @GregAbbott_TX Thank you for that, but it's a shame that in the USA this is necessary.
812725820007583745 2016-12-24 18:25:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX Same to you Governor! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
812393780942958592 2016-12-23 20:25:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @LeeBeth7 OH, lucky you.  I was a middle child with a very overbearing older sister. My two cats (sisters) are just like human children.
812393564743274497 2016-12-23 20:24:54 UTC <alclubb1967> This message from Putin is right on target where the whining Dems are concerned:http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/23/putin-on-us-elections-dont-blame-me-dems.html
812392396461928448 2016-12-23 20:20:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @LeeBeth7 I think all species have sibling rivalry, it's just hard to watch up close and personal on the cams.  I have seen it with kittens
812391687540576257 2016-12-23 20:17:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump Thank goodness.  They could hardly get worse for our only ally in the Middle East. Obama's administration is a disgrace.
812387138436288512 2016-12-23 19:59:21 UTC <alclubb1967> It is gutless moves like this that have eroded our influence in the world and allowed the rise of ISIS and others.http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/23/us-abstains-in-key-israel-vote-clearing-way-for-condemnation-settlements.html
812061061671223296 2016-12-22 22:23:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @garthbrooks So, are you going to honor your statement that you would sing at Pres. Trump's inauguration?
812040196002906112 2016-12-22 21:00:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @FormTheCulture This is very say and sounds like this Pope does not have any use for anyone who dares to ask a question.
812006062689845257 2016-12-22 18:45:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @brmartin91 To me, the confusion that exists in so much of the Faithful is what is from the devil.
812001261956567040 2016-12-22 18:26:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle No one has the right to do that to anyone, much less a mother with her children sitting quietly minding her own business.
812000961916968960 2016-12-22 18:24:50 UTC <alclubb1967> "Pride does its own will.  Humility does the will of God." St. Augustine

811704827457605633 2016-12-21 22:48:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @CardinalNapier A very simple answer would be for the Holy Father to clear up any confusion resulting from Amoris Laetitia.
811648456410431489 2016-12-21 19:04:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor So what is their point? These are successful people who earned their money, not taking it from taxpayers.
811630724562485248 2016-12-21 17:53:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin She is just so insufferable. Speaking for myself, it's the first time in 8 years that I have hope and feel optimistic.
811621076333686784 2016-12-21 17:15:18 UTC <alclubb1967> So, MSM runs with these stories but complains about "fake news". They appear to be the source of fake news.http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/21/growing-list-post-election-hate-crimes-turn-out-to-be-hoaxes.html
811601414883512320 2016-12-21 15:57:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics Hillary's so called popular vote came from ONE state. We are the United STATES - that's PLURAL, not singular.
811600978269052928 2016-12-21 15:55:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @johnpodesta To paraphrase your losing candidate, what difference does it make now? You weren't worried about it before Nov. 8
811600651813789697 2016-12-21 15:54:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillClinton You and your wife don't seem to recognize the truth unless someone else points it out. Thank you, @realDonaldTrump
811568737878999040 2016-12-21 13:47:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @thehill So what's your point? Those votes all came from one state. In case you haven't noticed, we are the United STATES, that's PLURAL!!
811392478704238593 2016-12-20 02:06:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Oh, that's too bad. I was hoping it would come through correctly.
811391489825763333 2016-12-20 02:03:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I found this baby wrapped in swaddling clothes!
811340058024443904 2016-12-20 22:38:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump @BillClinton And, that's all we need to hear from you and your wife, Mr. Former President. Please just fade into the sunset
811327127270330368 2016-12-20 21:47:15 UTC <alclubb1967> Jeb is desperately trying to stay relevant, but really, we don't care what he has to say about anything.
811323681683148800 2016-12-20 21:33:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics He is truly the worst president we have ever had, and I'm even counting Carter.

811269779751370753 2016-12-20 17:59:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics Well, that's interesting coming from someone who never let the pen leave his hand!
811246924426788864 2016-12-20 16:28:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @FormTheCulture Perfect analysis, as usual.
811242576930099201 2016-12-20 16:11:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @TheAVClub @RBReich You didn't check your facts, as usual. And I think you are a bunch of sore losers who can't even be gracious in defeat.
810941949058412544 2016-12-19 20:16:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @larkberly That's OK.  I'll get excited for both of us. I watch eagles, ospreys', condors, turkey vultures, and cheetahs.
810940060522651648 2016-12-19 20:09:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @larkberly I don't believe they think about it, only take what is available at the time.
810939414780276736 2016-12-19 20:06:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @Ospreytrax @HellgateOsprey Exactly. Cruelty requires intent of malice. Animals only want to survive.
810936725535162368 2016-12-19 19:55:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @larkberly To me not wrong but very sad. All animals are special/deserve to survive, even those that may not be our favorite
810514031735934977 2016-12-18 15:56:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC So much of today's music used at Mass tries to be part of the world's pop culture instead of raising us to a higher level.
810513445426708480 2016-12-18 15:53:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC AMEN!! The point of sacred music is to lift us up out of the common, not bring us down to the secular level.
810301158631866368 2016-12-17 01:50:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle We can only hope they will be gone, but I fear he will always be giving press conferences & bad mouthing Trump.
810231221292859393 2016-12-17 21:12:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Not being a math nerd,thank you for doing the calculations! That is pretty impressive.
810214913377501184 2016-12-17 20:07:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC Be careful, Father. You don't need a broken leg or arm for Christmas!
810140546178121730 2016-12-17 15:12:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @CBS11JeffJam That must be an incorrect graphic. Your app is still calling for low in the teens.
809823203321376772 2016-12-16 18:11:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @DiamondandSilk Merry Christmas, y'all!
809821941821476866 2016-12-16 18:06:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain Hillary still has no relationship with the truth. Her own emails and dishonesty helped her lose, not the other way around.
809821552434966528 2016-12-16 18:04:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @KellyannePolls I support you 100% in whatever choice is yours for your family, but don't paint all of us cat lovers like that. We love you.
809794011867316225 2016-12-16 16:15:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC I just ordered two things off if your list, Father. God bless and Merry Christmas to all the priests in your community.
809492591116976128 2016-12-15 20:17:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @FormTheCulture Very sad that a Catholic priest would not celebrate one of  his own religion's most sacred holy days for fear of offending.
809446964513374208 2016-12-15 17:16:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @FormTheCulture How many more doctrines does he want to throw out? Please, Holy Spirit, stop the madness!
808870661515071489 2016-12-13 03:06:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @CBS11JeffJam I thought the low on Saturday was supposed to be 21-22.

808693985233530880 2016-12-13 15:24:05 UTC <alclubb1967> St. Augustine's comment is: "There is nothing more pleasing we can offer God than to say to him: Possess thyself of us."
808693885719482368 2016-12-13 15:23:41 UTC <alclubb1967> The man who follows his own will independently of God's, is guilty of a kind of idolatry. Instead of adoring God's will...he adores his own.
808669476384284672 2016-12-13 13:46:42 UTC <alclubb1967> When you give God alms, you give what you have. When you give Him your will, you give Him yourself. St. Alphonsus de Liguori
808449741671563265 2016-12-12 23:13:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @FrMatthewLC "Our hearts are restless until they rest in Thee, Oh Lord."
808058815727992833 2016-12-11 21:20:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @ToupsFamily Exactly! No Catholic can support a candidate who advocates abortion.
807382508413321216 2016-12-09 00:32:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle That was my father's favorite and he used to sing it. I also cry every time I hear it.
806649046601449476 2016-12-07 23:58:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle WOW! That is amazing that it is still for sale, and at full price too. Maybe all proceeds go to the Clinton Foundation.

805504078142963714 2016-12-04 20:08:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Well, if they didn't have some conspiracy theory, they would have to admit their candidate is a dishonest, scheming crook
805469236625805312 2016-12-04 17:50:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle That comment was just the icing on Hillary's rotten cake. There were SOOOO many more reasons no one wanted her as president.

805131571355385857 2016-12-03 19:28:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @LifeSite We have gone from tolerance, to acceptance and now they want us to participate in their lifestyle, which most religions denounce.
805110727816204289 2016-12-03 18:05:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @LifeSite This Bishop needs to go back and read St. JPII's writings on this subject. Amoris Laetitia must be read w/other Church documents.

805085308245180417 2016-12-03 16:24:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle That would be liberal logic. Oh wait, "liberal logic" is an oxymoron!

805046269655793665 2016-12-03 13:49:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @AdamShawNY I think they are afraid the MSM might start to be objective. Have to keep the liberal bias in place.
804797366935158784 2016-12-02 21:20:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @StFrancisTX I thought Fr. Mullady gave the Advent Mission???
804790882088128512 2016-12-02 20:54:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @AdamShawNY I agree.  Francis has approved the Argentinian bishops interpretation which is opposite from what the Synod bishops said.
804728383070470144 2016-12-02 16:46:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @AdamShawNY Wait!! How can the HuffPost do a story without using the words alt-right, Trump followers are racist, etc.

804441290540580864 2016-12-01 21:45:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @AdamShawNY Seems pretty straight forward. No chance of misunderstanding the meaning.
804437803798970368 2016-12-01 21:31:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin Oh please! Is there an encyclopedia of dumbness for these people to look stuff up in? Or, are they just naturally idiots.

804028528106868736 2016-11-30 18:25:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain His remarks seemed disingenuous.  He sounded like he still wants to control things instead of promote PE Trump's agenda.
803997364876935168 2016-11-30 16:21:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @BuzzFeedEnt So what is your point? Many people feel the same way. Cannot anyone have a different belief than you and your liberal friends?

803977854937694210 2016-11-30 15:03:52 UTC <alclubb1967> Romney sounds too much like he wants to still call the shots instead of spread Trump's message. Too pompous! http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/30/romney-says-has-increasing-hope-for-trump-administration-after-dinner-meeting.html
803976493076541441 2016-11-30 14:58:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @timkaine Yeah, you might want to wait for all the facts before you jump on the gun control bandwagon. You people are so transparent!
803696024560635904 2016-11-29 20:23:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @KellyannePolls I always thought Dan Quayle got a bum rap and was a very nice man. I'm glad to see Mr. Trump talking to him.
803636287706054656 2016-11-29 16:26:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin How about "Americans fear attacks from radical Islamic Muslims"! The rest of the Muslims should join us in identifying them.
802994393057591296 2016-11-27 21:55:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest This only proves what kooks all the progressives are.  They do more flip flopping than a pancake house.
802992994844610560 2016-11-27 21:50:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Oh, that is rich!  LOL!  I'd love a photo of the looks on the Clinton camp faces right about now.
802900245956952064 2016-11-27 15:41:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @KellyannePolls Thank you for saying what needs to be said both privately and publicly. @ananavarro fake outrage is typical.
802579970807644161 2016-11-26 18:29:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @DiamondandSilk Someone needs to replay her reaction at the last debate when Trump was asked about accepting the election!
802564209351557120 2016-11-26 17:26:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle All I can say is, "You can't cure stupid."
802557558074523649 2016-11-26 17:00:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin The kindest thing I can say is that Carter must be suffering from dementia. It's too bad Castro's brother is still in power
802553237320695808 2016-11-26 16:42:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump Yes, he is and that is all that needs to be said.  He was a dictator that crushed the Cuban people's freedoms.
802329014312587264 2016-11-25 01:51:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @KellyannePolls Actually, I think we should encourage them to keep doing what they were doing and we will continue to win!
802258268898861056 2016-11-25 21:10:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @MiamiHerald @ArmandoSalguero Bravo for you! And, thank you for showing what a pompous ass he is.
802222510435684354 2016-11-25 18:48:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics Why? She got fewer votes than Gary Johnson?
802222337827409921 2016-11-25 18:48:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Is there no end to the dishonesty and disingenuousness of Hillary Clinton? Pathetic that she has to set up 'spontaneous' pics
802220177547001857 2016-11-25 18:39:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @IvankaTrump You have a lovely family and I wish you all the best.

802182960120217600 2016-11-25 16:11:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump @DiamondandSilk Agreed!  Instead of continuing to TELL us what we should do, why don't they LISTEN to us! Go away, Jeb.
801936417731543040 2016-11-24 23:51:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle Great choice!! Dr. Carson is wonderful.

801807734287007744 2016-11-24 15:20:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @KellyannePolls Romney is a back stabbing, establishment RINO. We voted against all of those things. Please don't let us down. NO ROMNEY!
801499428502781952 2016-11-23 18:55:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Twitter is no better. Come overto Gab.ai, Laura.  Free speech is alive and well over there.
801497453727977473 2016-11-23 18:47:38 UTC <alclubb1967> At least it's a position where she can't do too much harm. Who really cares what the Amb. to the useless UN is?

800755719456755712 2016-11-21 17:40:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @CatholicLeague (2) I suggested he might want to rename Arbor Day to All Plants Day. We wouldn't want to insult crabgrass.
800755477722386432 2016-11-21 17:39:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @CatholicLeague (1) I just emailed the mayor asking when he was going to rename Ramadan, Hannakuh, MLK day, Christmas, and Independence Day.

799971053707653120 2016-11-19 13:42:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump It's done. You have more important things to take care of.

799363218938413057 2016-11-17 21:26:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest He better not have Romney anywhere near him unless he wants to alienate everyone who voted for him. Trump is not that stupid.

797819946046726144 2016-11-13 15:14:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @HillaryClinton Instead of making excuses to your donors, you should be denouncing the protests and telling them to stop breaking the law.
797819737413652480 2016-11-13 15:13:42 UTC <alclubb1967> Pres.Obama and H. Clinton should denounce the protesters and insist on giving Trump a chance. #GiveTrumpAChance
797819201440382976 2016-11-13 15:11:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Actually, they said they thought they covered both candidates fairly.  They are still delusional.
797803301052055552 2016-11-13 14:08:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @nytopinion @FLOTUS @POTUS @michellemalkin Your silence promotes and condones violence. Where is your outrage now like it was in Ferguson,MO
797793708624277509 2016-11-13 13:30:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @DiamondandSilk Exactly!!
797780310268276740 2016-11-13 12:37:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle That is the same thinking that always surrounds bi-partisanship. Compromise with your enemies is not a strong position.
797606090464706560 2016-11-12 01:04:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods 'nough said!
797557396369502208 2016-11-12 21:51:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @DiamondandSilk He won everything, IMHO. And, the electoral college is set up so that elections are not controlled solely by Calif and NY
797557053871058944 2016-11-12 21:49:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest The reason Comey was involved was because of her own careless/reckless behavior?? But that would require her taking some blame.
797544979048632320 2016-11-12 21:01:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @Pontifex Does that go for young people who like the Latin Mass? The ones you said were rigid and hiding something.
797535964092579844 2016-11-12 20:26:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @POTUS Why aren't you condemning the riots, looting and destruction that is taking place.  You should be setting an example. Be a leader.
797241541802729473 2016-11-11 00:56:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin 1st, no one needs a safe place from Trump. 2nd, they are the ones insulting and judging us with their PC agenda.
797240192797130752 2016-11-11 00:50:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin Does everything have to have a symbol? People used to be considerate of each other without needing labels, pins or ribbons.
797195239484170241 2016-11-11 21:52:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor How about all the people calling for Trump's assasination on Twitter.  Shouldn't something be done about them?
797123882545201152 2016-11-11 17:08:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin The difference between Obama and Trump is that one talks about it and the other actually gets things done.
797117548466683904 2016-11-11 16:43:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @NeganTime @RealJamesWoods Seems to me freedom of speech ends at threats of violence and murder.  Just saying.
797109082452856833 2016-11-11 16:09:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @Grubhub Tolerance, by its definition. means to tolerate opposing points of view, not to intimidate and threaten them.
797108046082310144 2016-11-11 16:05:42 UTC <alclubb1967> #boycottgrubhub No employer has the right to threaten their employees because they have a different opinion.
797107797582352384 2016-11-11 16:04:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @HillaryClinton @POTUS If you are truly in favor of a peaceful transition of power, why don't you denounce the rioters & support law/order.
797095036722757632 2016-11-11 15:14:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @POTUS @KellyannePolls Exactly!  It's time Obama acted like a leader and not a community organizer. He should be on the side of law & order.
797090081471336449 2016-11-11 14:54:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin That's what a real leader does, instead of stoking the fires of unrest and siding with the lawbreakers like Obama did.
797076189827448832 2016-11-11 13:59:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @MrAndyNgo @michellemalkin Police shouldn't be "pleading". Arrest them and clear the streets, stop the looting. Uphold the law.
797075660653129728 2016-11-11 13:57:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump DON'T let the foxes into the hen house. Beware the RINOs.
797062777831653376 2016-11-11 13:05:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @GeorgeTakei Sorry, George.  I loved you as Sulu, but these are violent looters disguised as "peaceful" protests. They are paid rioters.
796900738148564992 2016-11-10 02:21:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump Can't wait for you to restore law and order to our country.
796900492685275137 2016-11-10 02:20:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump Glad you had a good meeting, but don't trust them.
796894990165274624 2016-11-10 01:59:05 UTC <alclubb1967> You wrote the email showing you only tolerate people who agree with you. Strange definition of diversity.
796866583935275008 2016-11-10 00:06:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @FoxNews @RealJamesWoods Yes, she needs to be held accountable. Just don't use Ken Starr.
796866119072186368 2016-11-10 00:04:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @Grubhub Nice try, but you wrote the email. You should have used BkeachBit like your heroine, Hillary.
796859069789249536 2016-11-10 23:36:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Wow! Those pictures are stunning!
796830048338710528 2016-11-10 21:41:02 UTC <alclubb1967> Really?  Well, your email doesn't say that. You apparently only tolerate people who think like you. Typical liberal!
796822615008673793 2016-11-10 21:11:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin There is no cure for stupidity!  And, we are drowning in a sea of stupidity.
796783684430991361 2016-11-10 18:36:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Thank you! Baby pigs are the cutest things!
796521691660881920 2016-11-09 01:15:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin So, exactly what are they protesting? The fact that other Americans exercised their right to vote? We don't get a choice?
796468524055023616 2016-11-09 21:44:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @JohnKasich Too bad you couldn't have come on board BEFORE the election and supported the Rep. nominee liked you pledged to do.
796367399935180800 2016-11-09 15:02:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @JebBush No thanks to you who actively worked against him. Your words are full of hypocrisy. Please be quiet and go back into retirement.
796367066127355905 2016-11-09 15:01:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @MittRomney He won in spite of people like you who actively worked against him and your own party's victory. Please go back into retirement
796343878550953984 2016-11-09 13:29:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @KellyannePolls @IngrahamAngle You both did a fabulous job fighting against all the odds.
796265246386221056 2016-11-09 08:16:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @chuckwoolery Yeah, Juan was terrible.
796056213972799498 2016-11-08 18:26:06 UTC <alclubb1967> Everyone who can legally do so, please go vote.
796056054522056704 2016-11-08 18:25:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods And, yes, I voted.  I am disabled but I voted by mail and am proudly one of the Deplorables!
796055840662896640 2016-11-08 18:24:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Best photo ever!
796010161508876293 2016-11-08 15:23:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin Well, that's enough to make me throw up.
796007382551760899 2016-11-08 15:12:03 UTC <alclubb1967> Interesting that Hillary Clinton's exclusive house in Washington, DC is called "Whitehaven".  That's pretty close to "White House".
795984392350994432 2016-11-08 13:40:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @bpdflores @BpOlsonFW If Clinton gets elected, you may not be allowed to do your work any more!
795983467137953792 2016-11-08 13:37:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle I've been praying too. As Abraham said, "If there are 10 faithful people.." God have mercy on us!
795652486728155136 2016-11-07 15:41:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW Would someone like to tell Jesus that when He cleared the temple of the money changers? We should feel  intense about the truth!
795651550899216385 2016-11-07 15:38:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @VescovoDDK Stay strong, Bishop. You are a great leader and model of faithfulness to the truth.
795277954502848516 2016-11-06 14:53:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin @kerpen I wonder if she was even legal??  Puts a whole new light on open borders.
795277791122063360 2016-11-06 14:52:55 UTC <alclubb1967> Clinton directed her maid to print out classified materials | http://fxn.ws/2eLQaOj
794994973036965888 2016-11-05 20:09:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @RealJamesWoods This should be required reading before receiving your ballot.
794527963496660992 2016-11-04 13:13:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle It's a lot harder to do that when you work against Trump, the only one who will appoint constitutionalists
794320396157751296 2016-11-03 23:28:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest I didn't think I would ever agree with Louis Farrakhan on anything! Amazing!
794294024760737792 2016-11-03 21:43:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @chuckwoolery I'll take some too.  I have to live in Dallas where he is the owner of the Dallas Mavericks!
794259855699623937 2016-11-03 19:28:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @chuckwoolery @TuckerCarlson Congratulations to an honest and real conservative! Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
794241403207315456 2016-11-03 18:14:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @chuckwoolery Yes, that's great.  He's honest and straight forward.
794194460473102337 2016-11-03 15:08:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Stand firm, Col. West. It is people like you that keep us inspired. And I am not a young college student I am 70 years old!
793246876501876737 2016-10-31 00:22:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin @jeneps I wonder if the wicked witch brought along her flying monkeys!
792796687475412992 2016-10-30 18:33:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @chuckwoolery @MarkYoungTruth He's slick and she's evil.
792796499444760576 2016-10-30 18:33:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Let's see, Huma doesn't know, Hillary can't remember. Great ppl to be in charge of top secrets. Oh wait, they already were!
792749708812754945 2016-10-30 15:27:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @chuckwoolery @MarkYoungTruth Tell Hillary to ask Huma what's in the emails.  They are her emails. The FBI doesn't need to give her anything
792743610009747456 2016-10-30 15:02:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics Really?  How about NBC's timing to release an illegally obtained recording of Trump? Sauce for goose.....
792543458565029889 2016-10-29 01:47:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods She's singing a different tune now.
792429913332592640 2016-10-29 18:16:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @JebBush @JohnKasich @IngrahamAngle I hope you're not holding your breath. Once a RINO gets knee deep in stupid, it's hard to get out.
792417071460036608 2016-10-29 17:25:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Because they don't think. They react on emotions and leave out logic.
792388465035927552 2016-10-29 15:31:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @nathanTbernard I know a lot of women who are voting for Trump, at least the smart ones who can think for themselves.
792388129164365825 2016-10-29 15:30:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @chuckwoolery You are assuming she had any good judgment to begin with.  Pathological liars rarely do.
792165943996592128 2016-10-28 00:47:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @chuckwoolery That picture looks like one of those heads people used to carve out of shriveled up apples.
792157037484384256 2016-10-28 00:12:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @Mediaite According to them she is the smartest and most qualified person to ever run for president! Doesn't quite add up.
792145426463862784 2016-10-28 23:26:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle They should change their name to "alwaysHillary". They are traitors to all of us.
792082526579810304 2016-10-28 19:16:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento There are things that we don't understand in nature that seem harsh.Not necessary to like or dislike it.
792079134017007616 2016-10-28 19:02:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento I guess I am the exception
792075583320567808 2016-10-28 18:48:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento I realize everyone has their favorites, but eagles are also trying to survive. It's the way nature works.
792069359959093248 2016-10-28 18:23:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX Finally something makes sense. Maybe all the FBI employees that worked on it got through to Comey and forced this.
792069192488845313 2016-10-28 18:23:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @ChrisStirewalt @foxnewspolitics I hope this time they can come to the same conclusion that most of thinking Americans did. She's guilty!!
792051197624537088 2016-10-28 17:11:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @marklevinshow @dclubb25 @TheRightScoop I certainly hope so!
792050258842759168 2016-10-28 17:07:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @chuckwoolery I guess if "curious" means "cheating".
791714852603428864 2016-10-27 18:55:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @chuckwoolery I know what you mean!!
791624197327814657 2016-10-27 12:54:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @RealClearNews Exactly! Romney and the other "elites" will be to blame if Hillary wins too!
791451375775342592 2016-10-26 01:28:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @FoxBusiness Yes, and things will get much worse.
791294197617745920 2016-10-26 15:03:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @megynkelly @newtgingrich You are correct, Mr. Gingrich. Bravo for telling the truth!
791074566424494080 2016-10-25 00:30:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @chuckwoolery Isn't that redundant? Hillary's conduct disgusting?
791047433941680130 2016-10-25 22:42:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @chuckwoolery I voted for Trump too!
790964668994981888 2016-10-25 17:14:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain None of it matters. They are getting it all out now before she is inaugurated. By then it will all be old news.
790891275843100672 2016-10-25 12:22:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @VescovoDDK Thank you for your courageous and clear teaching of the Faith, in season and out of season! Thank you!
790529382477541376 2016-10-24 12:24:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @chuckwoolery You hit the nail on the head!
790323835073462273 2016-10-23 22:47:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @YouTube @RealJamesWoods That is the greatest ad!!!
789806863948709888 2016-10-22 12:33:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @benandjerrys So, you are serving propaganda with your ice cream! Good time to be lactose intolerant.
789627167109881856 2016-10-21 00:39:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor How dare Card. Dolan cozy up to someone who the night before justified partial birth abortion!
789587565141647360 2016-10-21 22:02:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @FormTheCulture How dare Clinton even mention Pope Francis in her remarks. If she wants to agree with him, she needs to start with abortion.
789508346374070272 2016-10-21 16:47:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW With all due respect, many Catholics do not know what a well formed conscience is. Abortion cannot be supported by Catholics.
789494325272977408 2016-10-21 15:51:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Female because of the necklace
789276510406397953 2016-10-20 01:25:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Every Catholic bishop in the U.S. should tell their flock that no Catholic can vote for any politician who supports abortion.
788825507668168704 2016-10-19 19:33:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @spl650 @larkberly Yes, and I didn't mention all the snakes.  We have water moccasins and copperheads. Also, scissor tail flycatchers!
788825044390596608 2016-10-19 19:32:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I think it's a juvenile, but have no idea on whether male or female.
788758755848560640 2016-10-19 15:08:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @larkberly @spl650 I live in a suburban neighborhood and we have possums, raccoons, coyotes, a bobcat, roadrunners, hawks, squirrels.
788758067659714560 2016-10-19 15:05:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @larkberly I know what you mean!
788747459145064448 2016-10-19 14:23:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @larkberly I love that you have so many wild turkeys. You are lucky to live in an area that has them.

787320629615702016 2016-10-15 15:54:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @FoxNews @RealJamesWoods Yes she was. Funny how liberals tell the truth before they run it through the PC filter, then it's backtrack time!
787069535832514561 2016-10-14 23:16:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @VescovoDDK Bravo, Bishop! As a faithful Catholic, it is wonderful to see one of our shepherds strongly and courageously speaking out.
786921712788975616 2016-10-14 13:28:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Oh, yes, I did miss that. Thank you. I am still so very sad about our precious little chick.
786717302305591296 2016-10-13 23:56:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest That photo is of pure evil! Look at the smug looks on their faces. I just can't stand the idea of them being in the White House.
786698405208657920 2016-10-13 22:41:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @CBSSF @CornellCondors @larkberly Oh, how wonderful! I hope she lives long and prospers!
786560931295703041 2016-10-13 13:35:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW @CatholicNewsSvc When operatives in a major political party target a religion for a "revolution", this is more than hostility.
786332660629057536 2016-10-12 22:28:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @StFrancisTX The Faithful need to know about this. http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=29628
786332501765521409 2016-10-12 22:27:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW The Faithful need to know about this. http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=29628
786277803868119040 2016-10-12 18:50:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor Yeah, right! She's not sorry for what she said, only that she got called on it.
786197001000013828 2016-10-12 13:29:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Do the words Sodom and Gomorrah mean anything to anyone? Our society is doomed!
785556152356442113 2016-10-10 19:02:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @Politweecs I didn't know Michelle was supporting Trump! Excellent!
785534165726863361 2016-10-10 17:35:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics If Trump's car was the last evacuating a hurricane, people like this wouldn't help him change a tire so they could flee.
785182334798602240 2016-10-09 18:17:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle New definition of short sighted: 2016 Republican elite
785178797180018688 2016-10-09 18:03:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods What an over the hill sleaze ball. He and his wife deserve each other. They are both disgusting.
785160743599562752 2016-10-09 16:51:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump Please, please stick to issues no matter what Hillary says. Show her for the lying hypocrite that she is.
784849023886696449 2016-10-08 20:12:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Gorgeous! Those look like antique roses.
784805564417056768 2016-10-08 17:20:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @HillaryClinton @IngrahamAngle Dream on, Hillary.  You don't care what happens to the rest of us as long as you have a Secret Service Detail
784768395166175232 2016-10-08 14:52:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Trump used vulgar words; Bill actually raped and assaulted women; Hillary destroyed them, sacrificed a 12 yr. old rape victim
784545665569488897 2016-10-07 00:07:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @wikileaks Snakes are higher on the moral ladder than the Clintons. They don't pretend to be anything than what they are.
783770040038404096 2016-10-05 20:45:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @DailyCaller Why would he be able to appeal to anyone, especially young people? And, no, he did NOT invent the Internet.
783756013035884544 2016-10-05 19:49:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Well, there's a reason Crooked Hillary picked Kaine. He can lie as well as she canl
783415025285210112 2016-10-04 21:14:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle He really loves up to his name!

783325414500409344 2016-10-04 15:18:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest As a woman I think that is not only the stupidest thing I have heard but demeaning to the rest of us who have working brains!
783120054640451584 2016-10-03 01:42:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Looks like the basis for a Hitchcock movie!
783111169489776640 2016-10-03 01:07:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @larkberly @amymlcollins I feel the same way. I've watched eagles, ospreys, but there was something so calm and peaceful about the condors.
783037889793789952 2016-10-03 20:15:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @b9db9a38ec27482 I would think the lights will keep any owls away.
782991624842293248 2016-10-03 17:12:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics Yes, we do. So, what's his point! He IS the Antichrist!
782670245903216640 2016-10-02 19:55:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @nytimes @RealJamesWoods Is that like transgender? Do they decide which nation they feel like being from??
782296779257622528 2016-10-01 19:11:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @chicagotribune I guess Chicago lives don't matter to Obama and BLM. Certainly doesn't fit their narrative.
782289984300552192 2016-10-01 18:44:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @michellemalkin @IngrahamAngle If Hillary wins in November, God forbid, this will only get worse.  When do we get to be the favored class???
782288936131362817 2016-10-01 18:39:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest They don't worry about offending Christians or offending those of us who have been called "deplorable" and "unredeemable".
782262971435134976 2016-10-01 16:56:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain She is always changing the definition and who she will target. She has to keep lowering the threshold.
782262459214143489 2016-10-01 16:54:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @CBSNews @IngrahamAngle @newtswally You nailed it. But the same people who permit this say they are for women's rights. Gross hypocrisy.
782262160948801536 2016-10-01 16:53:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @debclay5153 Exactly!  Who always fights against Christianity, since the beginning of time.
782250362212278272 2016-10-01 16:06:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @debclay5153 The one who is behind the persecution of Christians has a five letter name that starts with "S" and ends with "n".
782249163593437184 2016-10-01 16:01:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @CBSNews @IngrahamAngle @debclay5153 Liberals are secularists. So stupid to support Muslim religion that goes against all their PC agenda.
782247861245227008 2016-10-01 15:56:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump Please concentrate on that in the next debate.
782247779741544451 2016-10-01 15:56:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump Forget the small stuff. Get on with the message. We cannot afford to lose this election. Think Supreme Court.
782243579968106496 2016-10-01 15:39:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @CBSNews But Christians are put out of business for holding on to their beliefs!
782198751104380928 2016-10-01 12:41:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Thank you. I was having trouble understanding the cycle.
782196059778846720 2016-10-01 12:30:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors The chick last year died from lead poisoning. If the parents don't have high lead levels, where do the chicks get it from?
782193853751136256 2016-10-01 12:22:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Since the parents won't have a chick to care for, will they breed and produce another egg next year?
781920753398624257 2016-09-30 18:16:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods OK, that takes the award for the cutest class picture!
781881277225906176 2016-09-30 15:39:57 UTC <alclubb1967> Clinton family liberal hypocrisy, "Do as I say, not as I do":  http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/09/30/chelsea-clinton-takes-private-jet-to-clean-energy-roundtable.html
781549996139171840 2016-09-29 17:43:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest @yaf I wonder what kind of cupcakes they are serving? White (privilege) Cupcakes or Black (lives matter) Cupcakes?
781512515159109632 2016-09-29 15:14:38 UTC <alclubb1967> This story bring to mind the old Mounds/Almond Joy commercial: "Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't." http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/09/29/university-michigan-professors-instructed-to-stick-to-preferred-pronouns.html
781512015193841664 2016-09-29 15:12:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Interesting that they are so concerned about security on the voting machines but not on Hillary's home server.
781192733226520576 2016-09-28 18:03:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Don't insult cats by comparing them to the Hildebeast! The rest of the graphic is accurate.
780800636958875648 2016-09-27 16:05:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Just checked the @LawrenceKS_PD account and they are hilarious! They definitely have a great sense of humor! Good for them.
780798019868295168 2016-09-27 15:55:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @LawrenceKS_PD We are DOOMED! The participation trophy generation will soon be in charge!!
780795959588466688 2016-09-27 15:47:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey It will be nice to be rid of all the construction vehicles and mess.

779848608824766464 2016-09-24 01:02:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @dcexaminer Tim Kaine obviously is confusing Texas with California and, boy, is he confused! Sorry, Tim, think again!
779847801014333440 2016-09-24 00:59:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Liberals don't want to be confused with the facts when they are so busy wallowing in their emotions.
779414741051543552 2016-09-23 20:18:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics @FoxNews Well it's about damn time!
779369762853752833 2016-09-23 17:20:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @FoxNews I wish I could help. I hope some of the other parents talked to their kids and reach out to him.
779367564526825472 2016-09-23 17:11:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @LifeZette @IngrahamAngle Better late than never, but barely. He still won't get my vote again.

778674365072224257 2016-09-21 19:16:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @stephanproctor I really don't know your point is, but in the words of my friend James Woods, #Instablock
778673416475779072 2016-09-21 19:13:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @stephanproctor Nope, that one seemed to fit.
778672262203400192 2016-09-21 19:08:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Good! I hope more people boycott the NFL (Nefarious Football Liberals!)
778662409187627008 2016-09-21 18:29:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest When have the facts ever mattered to the liberals? They operate on emotion, not facts.
778323681818750976 2016-09-20 20:03:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @LifeZette I'll vote for him. I was a Cruz supporter both for Senate and Pres, but not anymore.
778242390536491008 2016-09-20 14:40:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Why don't they form their own party: Elitist Snobby Turncoat Party.
778241805615632385 2016-09-20 14:38:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest You nailed! Bravo!

777914901050175492 2016-09-19 16:59:00 UTC <alclubb1967> "Pride does its own will; humility does the will of God." St. Augustine says so much in such few words.
777883351722004481 2016-09-19 14:53:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX That's what happens when you have an admin that looks at immigrants as future voters instead of possible threats. Morons!
777667108498845696 2016-09-18 00:34:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods If she feels as bad as she looks, I actually feel sorry for her, sort of!
777241526950780928 2016-09-17 20:23:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest I don't even have a word that describes how utterly ridiculous this is. Beam me up, Scottie.  There is no intelligent life here.

776915947374325761 2016-09-16 22:49:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @AOL That conclusion seems like a bit of a stretch.

776134296541106176 2016-09-14 19:03:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Interesting they used the same "fainting because of dehydration" in 2012 when Hillary fell and got the concussion. Epilepsy?

775414940177879041 2016-09-12 19:25:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @danmericaCNN She can cough as much as she wants on the conference call.
775408833891962880 2016-09-12 19:00:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods IOW, they say she has no health issues different from anyone else. If her young staff had to go to ER, she's no different.
775406174476783616 2016-09-12 18:50:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods This is another cover story for Hillary by saying she's not sick. Others had to be treated at ER for dehydration.
775380211462385664 2016-09-12 17:07:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Usually they are kept behind a rope barricade.  I'll bet they wish they had been further away this time.
775147610243870720 2016-09-11 01:42:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Why would she wear a long sleeved jacket knowing she has to stand outside in the sun?
775101990216933376 2016-09-11 22:41:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Well now that's convenient.  It explains her coughing and the fainting. Kill two news stories with one diagnosis.
775089381350645760 2016-09-11 21:51:23 UTC <alclubb1967> And, if you understood limits on 1st Amend. you would not have said what you did originally. I voiced my opinion on his actions.
775089165142626304 2016-09-11 21:50:32 UTC <alclubb1967> Really? They get paid to play football.  That is their job. It is not a public street.

775083778356056064 2016-09-11 21:29:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest There are actually limits on when you can do certain things. Check your facts. Football is a job, not a public forum.
775079028591964160 2016-09-11 21:10:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Thank goodness some NFL players have more class and good sense than some others who insult all of us by their spoiled actions.
775078166326947840 2016-09-11 21:06:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @NFL @RobLowe Exactly!  This is not the time or place for such actions. Take it off the field.
774702862949425152 2016-09-10 20:15:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Yes, and I don't see anyone sitting down either. We Deplorables know how to respect the flag!

774665933797281793 2016-09-10 17:48:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods The one in picture #2 sure seems more likeable!
774590986542391296 2016-09-10 12:50:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @wfaa @GregAbbott_TX @WFAA Wonderful! The NFL won't let the Cowboys do it, but Big Tex will! Go Big Tex!!
774309343558639616 2016-09-09 18:11:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @YouTube Wonderful but sad. It was my first year watching but Louis captured my heart. He was so enthusiastic.
774273365213229056 2016-09-09 15:48:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest The NFL are cowards to let this go on. If they want to protest, do it on their own time, not on the field.
773969134434471936 2016-09-08 19:39:55 UTC <alclubb1967> If you want a feel good moment listen to the Beach Boys album, "That's Why God the Invented Radio". Spectacular!!
773965622732476416 2016-09-08 19:25:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @DrSlappyShorts @MichaelBerrySho Count me in!
773618986734858240 2016-09-07 20:28:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @oncor We are having short power outages during the day. They last from 5 - 20 minutes and happen 2 - 3 times a day for the past 3 weeks.
773569729046810624 2016-09-07 17:12:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors We still don't know the sex of the check? What about lead levels?
773177798710079488 2016-09-06 15:15:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @marklevinshow Obama has company in that area "above the law". Hillary and Bill are right there.
772965163523710976 2016-09-05 01:10:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey That fish is almost bigger than Louis! I would have lived to see him catch that one.
772897041588494336 2016-09-05 20:39:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @Kasparov63 Hillary seems like a tiddlywinks kind of gal!
772889800621686784 2016-09-05 20:11:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @PJMedia_com Good grief, it's like anyone is asking when her last period was!
772605564203393024 2016-09-04 01:21:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX You're really good at that!
772543811792670720 2016-09-04 21:16:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors He/she certainly has grown up quickly. I sure wish we knew whether it was a male or female before it fledges.
772105312232804352 2016-09-03 16:13:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods That defense of "I don't or recall" doesn't work any other time. Try it when you are stopped for a traffic violation.
771689533876211712 2016-09-02 12:41:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods You are an honest breath of fresh air in this world of PC hypocrisy. Thank you for you thoughtful insights.
769889797968015361 2016-08-28 13:30:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods His black father deserted him, he was raised by whites, he has a great career, all in a country that oppresses black people?
769887449350742017 2016-08-28 13:20:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods If black people are so oppressed, how did he get to be QB of the 49ers?
769621143053406208 2016-08-27 19:42:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @BrendaC02333333 Looking great! They will have a nice foundation to start with next year.
768520107173613568 2016-08-24 18:47:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors OK, thank you.
768509977510019072 2016-08-24 18:07:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Have the blood work results come back on the chick? Male or female? Lead levels?
767439458400473088 2016-08-21 19:13:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @YouTube Has there been a ransom demand?
767407152247902208 2016-08-21 17:04:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @BrendaC02333333 I prefer to think of it this way. Dudley has fledged via surrogate!
767366649489952769 2016-08-21 14:24:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @dclubb25 @theblaze Yes, he is a hero. Unfortunately, he is a rarity.
767060725550297089 2016-08-20 18:08:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Beautiful car and fabulous old tree!!
766327253273718784 2016-08-18 17:33:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @BrendaC02333333 ,That doesn't look like Iris or Louis.
764952650626457600 2016-08-14 22:31:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @DailyCaller I am a Texan and I am ashamed that they are from Texas.  I wish they would go back overseas and stay there!
764868703527632896 2016-08-14 16:58:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods In one word: Obama
764832526141501440 2016-08-14 14:34:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods But we hear about the Muslim fencer! Aren't swords used to kill people? Isn't fencing an art of war?
764184140811874304 2016-08-12 19:37:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle If Trump loses we can thank all the "take my toys and go home" spoiled babies. Conservatives do not give the keys to Hillary.
763713935568609281 2016-08-11 12:29:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Good job, Mason! When will you be old enough to run for president?
763515038002839552 2016-08-10 23:19:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Is that to teach it how to eat from carrion on the ground in the future?
763442213250400257 2016-08-10 18:29:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @foxandfriends Was that his payoff for caving to Hillary?
763429562873094144 2016-08-10 17:39:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @FoxNews Ask Vince Foster what happens to people that push back on the Clintons.
763405911587037184 2016-08-10 16:05:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest They are desperate for their 15 SECONDS of fame! Losers!
762774110648668160 2016-08-08 22:14:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @JohnVanderbilt2 N, I do not support Paul RINO!
762358817518526464 2016-08-07 18:44:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @Jacksgirl5 @RobertDDamron @RealJamesWoods Boy, you certainly captured them in few but powerful words. Well done!!
762331408928903169 2016-08-07 16:55:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @larkberly I'm beginning to think Dudley is a petrified egg.
762100163766726657 2016-08-06 01:36:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Wait till his parents see what a mess Dudley's room is!
762098967794429952 2016-08-06 01:32:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @amymlcollins What a handsome and BIG baby!
761980366890479616 2016-08-06 17:40:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @ElizabethD_123 @BrendaC02333333 @HellgateOsprey LOL! Hanging out with bad company. The sure sign of a rebellious teenager.
761966691207176195 2016-08-06 16:46:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @BrendaC02333333 Uh oh! Has Dudley seen the movie "Risky Business"? He shouldn't have parties when his parents aren't home.
761733292039168000 2016-08-05 01:19:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors I'm glad to see the chick is venturing out to the front of the cave again.
761643387078389762 2016-08-05 19:21:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics I guess it depends on what the meaning of "is" is. She and her husband both are pathological liars.
761571630862639104 2016-08-05 14:36:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain I can't stand Hillary and would never vote for her, but I think she said "aren't" going to raise taxes.
761364441296363521 2016-08-04 00:53:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @larkberly Hold down the fort, Dudley old boy.
761364184877588480 2016-08-04 00:52:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Since the capture and tagging, our chick has been staying inside close to the wall. I guess the experience spooked it a bit.
761359242267734016 2016-08-04 00:32:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Great!  Can't wait to find out if we have a handsome boy or a lovely girl.
761281934894911492 2016-08-04 19:25:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Did they determine whether the chick is male or female?
761244616817451008 2016-08-04 16:57:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Wow, that is really a clear picture!! Did they determine if the chick is male or female?
761216734321790977 2016-08-04 15:06:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Can't wait to see what the chick's tag number is!  This is almost as exciting as waiting for the egg to hatch.
761213656310747137 2016-08-04 14:54:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Oh wow, that makes him/her so grown up! Kind of like a bar mitzvah!
761182564660891648 2016-08-04 12:50:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Perfect comment. It shows survival instinct for all, eagle and osprey chicks. Comments below video are excellent/informative
761180837769383936 2016-08-04 12:43:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @dclubb25 Perfect! You can add: Ku Klux Klan, 100% Democrat, 0% Republican
760855363092516864 2016-08-03 15:10:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @LucyShoupp I agree.
760852736573267969 2016-08-03 15:00:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle I wish someone would tell Trump to stop the knee jerk reaction to EVERTHING. Get back on message and prosecute Hillary!
760813201508306944 2016-08-03 12:22:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Good morning, Dudley, and all your peeps. What a fan club you have
760590967552352257 2016-08-02 21:39:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @YouTube How cute is that!!
760529032429481984 2016-08-02 17:33:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @ElizabethD_123 @HellgateOsprey Excellent!
760178111849701376 2016-08-01 18:19:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @ABC Hmmm, that qualifies him to be Secretary of State!
759879092359409664 2016-07-31 22:31:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @BrendaC02333333 He looks just like his Daddy!
759795640415117317 2016-07-31 16:59:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @FoxNews Interesting how she always hears things differently from what they were. Alternate reality anyone?
759770686365720577 2016-07-31 15:20:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Sounds a little like: "We are the Borg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile." She has that Borg look about her.
759762810322554880 2016-07-31 14:49:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Sorry, but I'm opting out of her village. Her village raises too many idiots.
759741218662195200 2016-07-31 13:23:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @burzenski @DailyNewsBin It's a RINO hunt! People are culling the herd, Paul RINO, uuhh, Ryan.
759565309653037057 2016-07-30 01:44:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @MELambright Awww, he's venturing out. Our baby is growing up. Isn't almost time for him to be tagged?
759417909936402432 2016-07-30 15:58:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @YouTube OOPS! What tree? I didn't see a tree. Nothing here to see, move on!
759399897929879552 2016-07-30 14:46:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Mr. Woods, you sir are the master of finessing a statement!
759160949236301825 2016-07-29 22:57:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain There is no such thing as a "devout Catholic" who votes for abortion. It's Catholic or pro-choice. There is no in between.
759119106469613568 2016-07-29 20:11:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @JeffFlake @IngrahamAngle Why not just change parties? Sort of like saying you won't eat sushi until they quit using rice to make it!
758766119272394753 2016-07-28 20:48:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest So much for Romney can't support Trump because he's not conservative.  Oh wait, neither is Romney!  What a jerk.
758717483263987713 2016-07-28 17:35:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @BrendaC02333333 I think Dudley wishes he was old enough to ride a bike
758688402430492672 2016-07-28 15:39:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain @JoSheram Exactly. Tired of empty promises.
758681892161855489 2016-07-28 15:13:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain It's not going anywhere any more than the email one did. I'm tired waiting for justice to be done re: any of the Clintons
758658988950945792 2016-07-28 13:42:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @EWErickson "my party"? Since when do you own the Rep. party?  Last conservative president? Name one. Your ego will elect Hillary.
758482580232556545 2016-07-27 02:01:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @HillaryClinton @MikeBloomberg @FoxBusiness Coming from a total insane and incompetent person who thinks Big Gulps are dangerous.
758481409581338624 2016-07-27 01:57:14 UTC <alclubb1967> The only thing historic about Hillary Clinton is the historic amount of dishonesty, hypocrisy and criminal acts she has managed to evade.
758480503867527168 2016-07-27 01:53:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @HillaryClinton @finnygo Isn't that a gross understatement? Historically, she's the only presidential candidate investigated by the FBI!
758477346563174405 2016-07-27 01:41:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Or how about sending him to the Benghazi victims families. Hillary's America failed them.
758372800360873984 2016-07-27 18:45:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Looks like they are enjoying the wide open spaces.
758324360612487169 2016-07-27 15:33:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @catmeyo1 Spectacular!! Thank you.
758323262476603392 2016-07-27 15:28:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @catmeyo1 How many ospreys are in that nest???
758317027694026752 2016-07-27 15:04:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @HillaryClinton @RealJamesWoods She's a change maker alright. She changes positions to match her audience. America has been changed enough.
758288436096675844 2016-07-27 13:10:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Obama gave us change. Who wants more of the kind of changes that the Dems have in mind? Hillary would kill America.
758098274888712192 2016-07-26 00:34:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @HillaryClinton @IngrahamAngle No, it would be like being kept after school to write "I will not lie" on the board 100,000 times.
758021816824713217 2016-07-26 19:30:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @EWErickson @IngrahamAngle They are already there. Obama told us he was going to change America;no one listened. You'd better listen now.
758019919761903617 2016-07-26 19:23:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I'm sorry for your loss. He sounds like a very special person.
757951964655169536 2016-07-26 14:53:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics It doesn't matter who did the hacking. The content of the emails is still the same. Nothing but deflection from real issue.
757951586404446208 2016-07-26 14:51:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods For years we have heard about the hatred coming from pro-life people quietly praying the rosary. Here are the real demons.
757917129790201856 2016-07-26 12:34:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle May his soul rest in peace!
757715158697250818 2016-07-25 23:12:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @JonahNRO @RealJamesWoods Clinton M.O: deny, deflect, defend, and disregard.
757663630716305408 2016-07-25 19:47:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @AP If it only mattered. Little Debbie's feet didn't even hit the ground before Hillary hired her on to her campaign.
757663391271886848 2016-07-25 19:46:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain Doesn't matter.  Hillary hires her to be her "honorary" campaign chair and surrogate for her 50 state campaign.
757289728072749056 2016-07-24 19:01:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor Was the killer a policeman, a Christian, any white person, a Republican, a prolifer, Tea Party? There's your answer.
757285934828183552 2016-07-24 18:46:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @YahooNews She doesn't care what crimes any of them or illegals in this country commit as long as they vote for her.
757225862315937792 2016-07-24 14:48:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle The conundrum is that in order for anything to change, the media has to tell people. And they are not going to report it.
757019320555667456 2016-07-23 01:07:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @timkaine @HillaryClinton We made history with Obama, and look how bad that's turned out.
757019108076466176 2016-07-23 01:06:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Well, isn't that the mark of a good actor? Getting people to believe the part you are playing??
757014613451952131 2016-07-23 00:48:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods When I lived on Oahu, we would get ash in the air when the volcano would erupt on the Big Island. I can imagine 30 mi away.
757012776992645121 2016-07-23 00:41:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods That is eerily beautiful but scary at the same time.
757010851253530624 2016-07-23 00:33:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods WOW! That is amazing. How far away is the fire? Hope everyone is safe.
757004054090309633 2016-07-23 00:06:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Right! The media are complicit in covering up all the Clinton crimes going all the way back to the Rose Law Firm.
756951542540840960 2016-07-23 20:38:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Awww, look at that sweet face. And bless your friend for adopting.
756946068139495425 2016-07-23 20:16:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest How do you say "pandering" in Spanish.
756945646779629568 2016-07-23 20:14:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @politico @timkaine How DO politicians sleep at night! They will say anything for a vote.
756936348859195392 2016-07-23 19:37:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @FoxNews Really! Well color me surprised. You mean the system really IS rigged! Who knew!
756929132433244160 2016-07-23 19:09:02 UTC <alclubb1967> http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/07/23/kerry-air-conditioners-as-big-threat-as-isis.html. Wonder when he will open the windows in his penthouse!
756827645522743296 2016-07-23 12:25:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX @dclubb25 I agree!
756669616911331328 2016-07-22 01:57:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @JerryBrownGov @RealJamesWoods @FoxNews Bravo! She still looks crazy as a loon.
756637016272494594 2016-07-22 23:48:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @RonPJaffe @RealJamesWoods We really enjoyed that show. Great photo! Love the black and white look.
756564129398263809 2016-07-22 18:58:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump Please leave the Cruz thing alone. He made an ass of himself. Don't give him any more press by talking about it.
756533056475832320 2016-07-22 16:55:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @CLEpolice Thank you to the Cleveland police and any other police departments that helped at the RNC.  You were fabulous!!
756186521301032960 2016-07-21 17:58:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Sorry, I will not be contributing to Ted Cruz. I did once but never again. His only vision is of himself in the oval office.
756108762843262976 2016-07-21 12:49:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @RealJamesWoods @AllenWest  Thank you to Newt Gingrich who put lipstick on the pig of Cruz's non-endorsement!
756105064956039168 2016-07-21 12:34:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Cruz showed exactly why he lost and why he is disliked in the Senate. He's a selfish arrogant ass who is not a team player
755943173763903488 2016-07-20 01:51:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Whoa, is that "Mr. Rogers in dreadlocks". Must be his cousin.
755942844867543040 2016-07-20 01:49:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @FoxNews Exactly! They have to show an ID to get their food stamps, library books, and buy cigarettes. But not to vote.
755784299337494530 2016-07-20 15:19:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor So why hasn't this same network accused BLM of inviting mob violence. Hypocrites!!
755782160397639682 2016-07-20 15:11:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain Maybe Bush, etc. could work to make sure that's not the case and help Trump get elected! Nah, that would require humility!
755566927662034944 2016-07-19 00:56:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Wow, that is amazing.
755427891815395328 2016-07-19 15:43:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @HowardKurtz @foxnewspolitics All they have to do is what this site did. Michelle Obama plagerized her speech too: http://www.truthrevolt.org/news/if-melania-trump-plagiarized-michelle-obama-2008-speech-then-michelle-obama-plagiarized-hers
755148427667738624 2016-07-18 21:13:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @TexasPancake @GregAbbott_TX @mandyquinn @GovAbbott Wonderful news!
755125297918283776 2016-07-18 19:41:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @LifeZette Great article, Laura.
755106992763523073 2016-07-18 18:28:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @flower_mound It seems as though the traffic flow for this intersection only benefits people who live west of 2499.
755081803799461888 2016-07-18 16:48:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @alclubb1967 @flower_mound Thank you.
755073060219199488 2016-07-18 16:13:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @flower_mound The left turn southbound lane on 2499 backs up all the way to the signal light at Forest Vista.
755058299611979778 2016-07-18 15:15:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @flower_mound We need two left hand turn lanes for people going south on 2499 to turn left onto 3040. That intersection is a nightmare!
754803319160180736 2016-07-17 22:21:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Wow, amazing. He didn't mention gun control once.
754802849326899200 2016-07-17 22:19:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @TexasGOP @GregAbbott_TX @dcexaminer Excellent! It's about time the "justice" department upheld the law!
754039899406217216 2016-07-15 19:48:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX Thought and prayers go out to you and your family, Gov. Abbott. We need you healthy and strong to lead us in the days ahead.
753278962978009088 2016-07-13 17:24:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Yep, that's Her Royal Liarness.
753015465216086016 2016-07-12 23:57:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Maybe it's a life size Monopoly token.
752493493826707456 2016-07-11 13:23:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX I just heard about the accident in which you were severely burned. My prayers go out to you for a speedy recovery.
752247162050793472 2016-07-10 21:04:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @TEN_GOP The Obama's can only light up the WH for their political agendas. Heaven forbid they try to unite the country.
752162949108609024 2016-07-10 15:29:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @LifeZette @IngrahamAngle Would you look at the smirks on their faces.  Abominable people!
752132361052037120 2016-07-10 13:28:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @PressureCook2da Did someone win the cookbook?
752120136186888192 2016-07-10 12:39:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle They would sue the ambulance company and the police for not getting them through.
752115846319788033 2016-07-10 12:22:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @nytimes Why is anarchy being allowed?
752115378935914496 2016-07-10 12:20:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Why are they allowed to shut down freeways? They all need to be arrested when they break the law.
751822824185008128 2016-07-09 16:58:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor Is that going to be on her new show, "Pandering for A Living"
751769132299722752 2016-07-09 13:25:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @cnalive @BpOlsonFW Remember Acts 5:29. It's time to stand firm and push back against these actions.
751758928690589697 2016-07-09 12:44:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX You are a great leader, Gov. Abbott. Too bad we don't have one in Washington, D.C.
751572749139648512 2016-07-08 00:24:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors No wonder he is getting so big, LOL!
751504509663211520 2016-07-08 19:53:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Not holding my breath.
751426865055698944 2016-07-08 14:45:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle What is irresponsible about standing there to protect people and being gunned down!
751386162548224002 2016-07-08 12:03:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I live in the Dallas area and my prayers go out to all police officers and their families.
751385865843200002 2016-07-08 12:02:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @FlowerMoundFD God bless and protect our police officers. I stand with you.
751227620512010240 2016-07-07 01:33:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Thank you for such interesting information. At what age dies the eye color change?
751218884925988864 2016-07-07 00:58:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @RickSantorum @IngrahamAngle No, no, no!
751165232760754176 2016-07-07 21:25:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest And we are supposed to believe their investigation was thorough??  This is beyond irresponsible.
751095221065093121 2016-07-07 16:47:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain I agree with you 100%.  Newt would make an excellent VP.
751050069609033728 2016-07-07 13:47:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @jasoninthehouse Unless it results in punishment of Hillary, this is just a show for the American people. Please spare us any more charades.
750822702055694336 2016-07-06 22:44:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @DanaPerino Your tweets are right on target and validate my feelings of total betrayal of the law. I am 70 yrs. old and this make me sick.
750781388740190208 2016-07-06 20:00:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle What haven't they botched!
750781263053615105 2016-07-06 19:59:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle I'd rather have Newt any day of the week!
750753659781210112 2016-07-06 18:09:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Wow, you can really see how big the chick has gotten with one of the adults there for comparison. They always seem so calm.
750737087830167552 2016-07-06 17:04:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor But, he still didn't recommend she be prosecuted, so why bother with disputing her claims.
750714090666864640 2016-07-06 15:32:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Why go through this charade. In the words of HRC, what difference does it make now? She still gets away with it!
750666351820156928 2016-07-06 12:22:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods That is the PERFECT quote!
750491799026708480 2016-07-05 00:49:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey OK, thanks.  It certainly is different from her usual sounds.
750486533698752512 2016-07-05 00:28:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey What does the clicking sound mean?
750435830271913985 2016-07-05 21:06:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @alclubb1967 @FlowerMoundFD Thank you!
750411284353421312 2016-07-05 19:29:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Unfortunately, the rest of us have to live with what they deserve too!
750410177845702656 2016-07-05 19:25:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @FoxNews Well she let 4 people die in Benghazi. I guess that was just careless too.
750381320644071424 2016-07-05 17:30:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle If Trump doesn't use this to great advantage, he is wasting a gift on a silver platter.
750349559889469440 2016-07-05 15:24:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics Of course!  We knew from the beginning nothing would happen to her. She and all the administration is corrupt.
749976007906439168 2016-07-04 14:39:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @FlowerMoundFD I have my Everbridge account set to do not disturb between 9pm-7am. I am still getting the phone calls in during those times.
749975770152390656 2016-07-04 14:38:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @flower_mound I have my Everbridge account set to do not disturb between 9pm-7am. I am still getting the phone calls in during those times.
749964868057309184 2016-07-04 13:55:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I think Iris is showing pre-egg laying behavior and maybe means she is coming to the end of brooding time.
749708078057025536 2016-07-03 20:55:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX @PatrickSvitek A slight variation on St. Augustine, but acceptable - LOL!
749258860054007808 2016-07-02 15:10:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors He kind of looks like I do when I first wake up!
749216430814425088 2016-07-02 12:21:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Yes, because my grandparents came here legally and insisted their children speak English and assimilate.
748989890751180801 2016-07-01 21:21:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @MELambright @YouTube This chick is adorable! I think it is my favorite of all the cams I have watched.
748987726301569024 2016-07-01 21:12:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @FoxNews Hillary could be guilty of murder and nothing would happen. Oh wait, she is. Ask the families of Benghazi victims
748643893483184129 2016-06-30 22:26:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @alclubb1967 @CornellCondors I think it was the technical problem because it was much darker than usual. Thank you for the reply.
748597617995579392 2016-06-30 19:22:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Why is the camera so dark?
748211854149705728 2016-06-29 17:49:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors I'm ready for my close up, Mr. De Mille.pic.twitter.com/1aKgZAg1Bc
747931727318786049 2016-06-28 23:16:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX He's right, but I think that happened quite some time ago.
747818575193247746 2016-06-28 15:46:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Maybe he's practicing to be an ostrich.
747501301034999809 2016-06-27 18:46:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Louis has certainly learned the feeding female trick. He's doing it very well and consistently now.  He'll be a good dad.
747049025413619712 2016-06-26 12:49:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @USCCB Legal/illegal;assimilate/won't adapt; English/native tongue;America first/homeland always. See the difference?

746707329937072128 2016-06-25 14:11:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @Ostrov_A @IngrahamAngle @spikedonline Hmmm, sounds a lot like the American liberal leftist.
746691096462299136 2016-06-25 13:06:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Well the Obama administration has been calling American voters that for years!
746443117604175873 2016-06-24 20:41:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @SuzySycamore Great photo. Thanks!
746432603385790464 2016-06-24 19:59:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors This little one puts a smile on my face. I've watched eagles and ospreys, and nothing beats this condor chick! Condors rule!
746063000100995072 2016-06-23 19:30:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain Elizabeth Warren is a Senator not a Representative. Why is she there?
746054428097052672 2016-06-23 18:56:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Do other condor chicks lay in silly positions like this one?
746021623589801985 2016-06-23 16:46:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX Sure wish YOU were president, Gov. Abbott!
746021073448120320 2016-06-23 16:44:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle When are the Republicans NOT outmaneuvered by the Democrats!
746020940660649984 2016-06-23 16:43:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors What a spectacular photo!  Thanks for giving us a look back at this wonderful male.
746004141684588544 2016-06-23 15:37:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods This is interesting, but nothing will come of it just nothing has come of all other other security issues with her server.
745647717242703872 2016-06-22 16:00:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics What a bunch of immature babies!  Of course, maybe the Republicans could take a lesson from them.
745647188911370240 2016-06-22 15:58:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors This chick certainly has opened my eyes to different avian sleeping positions!  He/she is a real hoot! (no pun intended)
745646885755465728 2016-06-22 15:57:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor I think I heard John Lennon music in the  background. Wasn't it Rodney King who said, Can't we all just get along. Really???
745621926643589120 2016-06-22 14:18:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics Maybe now he will release all of his delegates.
745598770239275008 2016-06-22 12:46:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @chessplayer4 @foolkillerskat Exactly. We may not understand it, but it serves an ultimate purpose.
745598215861342208 2016-06-22 12:44:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @chessplayer4 @foolkillerskat Applying human reasoning to animal behavior is usually not rewarding or productive.
745328569891459072 2016-06-21 18:52:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Or they could just listen to the terrorist himself in his own words.
744617018062577664 2016-06-19 19:45:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Wish I could relax completely like that! How adorable.
744597700797038592 2016-06-19 18:28:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods A fence around the White House but not along the border. Protected by armed guards but take away our 2nd Amend. rights.
744201063230767105 2016-06-18 16:12:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you. It's sad.  Because the nest is on camera, we see it, but this probably happens more than we think it does.
744194584691900416 2016-06-18 15:46:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @FormTheCulture Maybe he needs to take a lesson from Obama and only speak from prepared teleprompter speeches.
744194127504412672 2016-06-18 15:44:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Does this come under the category of strange bedfellows??  They deserve each other but we don't deserve either.
744185220425932800 2016-06-18 15:09:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @news_va_en @Pontifex I am very disappointed in the Pope's recent remarks regarding marriage. Maybe prepared speeches are best for him.
744156700664422401 2016-06-18 13:15:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle I would say they deserve what they get, but they are dragging me along with them and I don't deserve Hillary Clinton!
743889951884877824 2016-06-17 19:35:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you. As you say, we must watch and wait. I keep being told patience is a virtue; guess I haven't developed it yet!
743884288223940609 2016-06-17 19:13:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey In past years, what happens if the egg/eggs do not hatch?
743883945389883393 2016-06-17 19:12:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics Leftist liberals are only upset about other Americans. To them,foreign countries are perfect and U.S. is always at fault
743837974492651522 2016-06-17 16:09:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods And, still the National Review people won't vote for someone who does take terrorists seriously!

743237533979447297 2016-06-15 00:23:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors He certainly is the most relaxed thing I have seen! He is adorable.
743227966994341891 2016-06-15 23:45:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @TWITLESSTWEETER He does have that head bob down pat!
743212418776498176 2016-06-15 22:43:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @FoxNews Well, find a black female English poet from the 15-17th centuries, and they can be part of that course.
743178839203819520 2016-06-15 20:30:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Well, she sure lives up to her reputation, LOL!

742692545386291200 2016-06-14 12:17:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @chessplayer4 I guess we will find out sooner or later.
742427290588479488 2016-06-13 18:43:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey With only one chick to feed, that will lessen the burden on Louis, who is new to all of this. Greater survival chance for ck
742407364297396224 2016-06-13 17:24:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor Christians are ruined by not baking a cake, but this hate speak goes unchallenged, just like Farrakhan and J. Wright
742386689587302401 2016-06-13 16:02:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @mikes_booh No, it is not learned.  Even newborn babies will do that. It's instinct.
742382191691210752 2016-06-13 15:44:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Well, we can hope for the remaining egg to hatch into an only child. At least there would be no competition for food.
742339083423227905 2016-06-13 12:53:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @mikes_booh Exactly.
742099361320968192 2016-06-12 21:00:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @mikes_booh I think it would be automatic and instinctive.
742095634593767424 2016-06-12 20:46:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest I agree completely!
742094065806630912 2016-06-12 20:39:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey So if Louis doesn't bring a fish, Iris doesn't fish for herself?
742056740464656384 2016-06-12 18:11:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors He is a fiesty one!  Gotta love him.
741726658932183040 2016-06-11 20:19:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @mikes_booh I agree about anthropomorphism. IMHO, animals have no concept of future so they don't worry about it.

741702850032472064 2016-06-11 18:45:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle If Hillary wins now, there won't be a Republican party in 2020 or 2024 because democracy will be dead.
741644967806787584 2016-06-11 14:55:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @pencilscom Very disappointed in the $20 Mystery Box; advertised as $40 value; it was certainly NOT a $40 value, maybe added up to $20
741636119675047936 2016-06-11 14:20:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor When has the truth ever made a difference to Hillary or any liberal. If they separate from life, they've got it made.
741401479030808576 2016-06-10 22:47:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @MELambright That is amazing! Dad was so cool, patiently waiting until Jr.calmed down. That attack would have scared me!
741348748517728256 2016-06-10 19:18:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors You can really see how big the chick is when he next to one of the adults!
741064253013000192 2016-06-09 00:27:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors She has a very sweet face.
740593095373258752 2016-06-08 17:15:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Love how baby condor is laying, especially with his head resting on the rock.pic.twitter.com/fWSGjUUJZf
740592510989279237 2016-06-08 17:13:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Let's put all the votes together for all three of them for their careers and see how close it comes to what Trump has gotten.
740560404401639424 2016-06-08 15:05:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @weeklystandard @IngrahamAngle This is embarrassing.  Don't they know that Mitt was NEVER a conservative?
740294791263490052 2016-06-07 21:30:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Oh, I thought they banded the chicks when they took blood to check the levels of lead, etc.  Thanks for the clarification.
740241636332969984 2016-06-07 17:58:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey If banded, why not just call them by their ID on the band?
740233086751805441 2016-06-07 17:24:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Why are any of the ospreys named?  Are they tracked or banded?
740221665280286723 2016-06-07 16:39:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Wow, isn't that similar to USSR's Pravda or Al-Jazeera? Only broadcast your own propaganda and not any other opinions?
740216784880439297 2016-06-07 16:20:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics I suppose it was too much to ask that he wait until the convention to offer has ideas??
739871299351154688 2016-06-06 17:27:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @b9db9a38ec27482 (2) I believe in only intervention that results in releasing the animal back into the wild.
739870990981697537 2016-06-06 17:26:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @b9db9a38ec27482 (1)Tough call. I think intervention only when problem is result of human not natural causes.
739860741944049664 2016-06-06 16:45:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Either that is not a real tweet from Fauxchahontas, or she changed the picture.
739855290611310592 2016-06-06 16:23:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Yes, she got it right. They are a bunch of law breaking, punks who refuse others their 1st Amend.rights.
739812717188419586 2016-06-06 13:34:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Life is not a movie or TV show. It's real and sometimes very unpleasant. We learn from all experiences, both good and bad.
739625870722113536 2016-06-05 01:12:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey What was being eaten in the nest? It looked like one of the eggs.
739588770387755008 2016-06-05 22:44:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @amymlcollins Yes, he does. I was amazed at how quickly he dug that hole.
739560585495339008 2016-06-05 20:52:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Baby condor sure has dug himself a nice little hole!pic.twitter.com/x3Z6R9n54d
739184736120102912 2016-06-04 19:59:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @MrJoshuaRogers Oh my goodness!  I read all the books to my granddaughter and we discussed the symbolism; that brought a new level to it.
739178674910437376 2016-06-04 19:35:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @fxnopinion @FoxNews @MrJoshuaRogers Fabulous article. I LOVE the Chronicles of Narnia!

739154023463321600 2016-06-04 17:57:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors May the Force be with you!
739117565432107009 2016-06-04 15:32:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @MichelleObama @IngrahamAngle And most people wake up in a house built by illegals because of open borders protected by your husband.
739116152698200066 2016-06-04 15:26:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Stand tall and proud, little one. You come from a race of majestic creatures.pic.twitter.com/PqBlPqYqE3

738872035367997441 2016-06-03 23:16:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain Isn't that the same logic rapists use? The woman was asking for it?
738824916305252352 2016-06-03 20:09:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors That is amazing that it has grown so big so quickly.  I guess it's not really that quick for birds, but it seems like it.
738804734237151232 2016-06-03 18:49:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest If you can't endorse fully, then just keep quiet about it. You don't have to go on TV and tell us who you are voting for.
738774535667748865 2016-06-03 16:49:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @ChrisStirewalt @foxnewspolitics Dems are who tacitly encourage it. Dem mayors in San Jose and Baltimore.
738764603790741506 2016-06-03 16:09:41 UTC <alclubb1967> Here is an example of why Trump's wall is so popular:pic.twitter.com/Z9j2BkafPp
738752187140968449 2016-06-03 15:20:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest This is what happens when liberals run the cities and courts. How is this different from Nazi Germany?
738729191022039040 2016-06-03 13:48:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW You are in my prayers every day, Bp. Olson.  May God's blesses pour down upon you today and every day.
738715787272163328 2016-06-03 12:55:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I hate to tell her but hot flashes are not  related to climate change!
738500898469482498 2016-06-02 22:41:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Love that picture.  Typical mother telling her child he can't have any more to eat!
738474086280531968 2016-06-02 20:55:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you for fixing the camera. I really appreciate everything y'all are doing for the ospreys.
738426211186016256 2016-06-02 17:45:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Great news!  How did the chick react to someone being in his nest cavity?
738186521837109250 2016-06-01 01:52:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX What does that accomplish.  At some point, kids are going to have to learn that not everything is the same for everyone.
738159505347743744 2016-06-01 00:05:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I think Louis likes to play Mr. Mom.
738134993612865536 2016-06-01 22:27:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors He's been eyeing that camera for a while. I guess he figured he didn't want that thing in there with his baby!
738044721721835520 2016-06-01 16:29:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @BpOlsonFW Very appropriate in today's world with so many false gods!
738044294032822273 2016-06-01 16:27:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @TWITLESSTWEETER Holy cow!  Pretty soon there won't be room in the nest for Iris, Louis or any chicks!  Gotta love our Louis
737777242923618304 2016-05-31 22:46:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento I figure the ospreys know what is best. They have been doing this for hundreds or thousands of years.
737734192209895424 2016-05-31 19:55:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Looks like Iris just got a fish!  Yay, Louis!

737655524418674688 2016-05-31 14:42:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor Seems like Kate's Law should be passed first: https://www.change.org/p/denise-driehaus-support-harambe-s-law-for-the-gorilla-killed-in-cincinnati
737654992404807684 2016-05-31 14:40:29 UTC <alclubb1967> Interesting that this law will probably pass and Kate's Law still can't get passed:  https://www.change.org/p/denise-driehaus-support-harambe-s-law-for-the-gorilla-killed-in-cincinnati
737435636299243521 2016-05-30 00:08:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Thank you. I was hoping to see it fledge.
737433440711102464 2016-05-30 00:00:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Wow, it s getting so big! Is there a camera outside the nest cavity for when it ventures out?
737432041369702400 2016-05-30 23:54:34 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Look at those feathers coming in on his wing!
737405396487266304 2016-05-30 22:08:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @ShortSkinnyLady LOL!  Didn't mean to one up you. The shelves were easy and cheap to make and my girls run up and down chasing each other.
737382391828742144 2016-05-30 20:37:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey How big around is the platform?
737381548522012672 2016-05-30 20:33:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey OH, Ok.  I thought you were talking about Louis's board.  I couldn't see that until you posted this picture.  Thank you.
737380487568621568 2016-05-30 20:29:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @TWITLESSTWEETER @HellgateOsprey @aeb4kats I thought Louis brought in that board, surfed it in.
737380295905665024 2016-05-30 20:28:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @TWITLESSTWEETER That one branch that sticking up makes me nervous. Don't want it to put an eye out, or is that only BB guns
737374839615279104 2016-05-30 20:07:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @Baylady135 Bless Dr. Green and people like him. What kind of person leaves stuff like that & not clean up after themselves!
737372918447906816 2016-05-30 19:59:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Is this nest the same one where Dr. Green picked up the twine? In that post he said a new male is with the female.
737357793628278784 2016-05-30 18:59:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @ShortSkinnyLady I don't suppose you want to see photos of all the carpeted wall shelves we have built for the cats to climb on,LOL!
737357598802903040 2016-05-30 18:58:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @ShortSkinnyLady Wish I could, but I have chronic vertigo and riding in a car is torture for me.
737355658236821504 2016-05-30 18:51:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @ShortSkinnyLady LOL!  In the background of my picture, you will see b/w faux fur pads with heating pads inside so the girls don't get cold.
737350833788985346 2016-05-30 18:31:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @ShortSkinnyLady I have two, http://sisters.Here they are on a new scratching post-one of several!pic.twitter.com/W46tXpQHpQ
737340547124236288 2016-05-30 17:51:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @ShortSkinnyLady Love it!! I have Siamese cats too.
737331308209131520 2016-05-30 17:14:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @beth_bruning That's what I was thinking. It looked like he gave her one piece and then left the fish for her to take.
737314991846498304 2016-05-30 16:09:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle I agree. Concentrate on crooked Hillary and forget Bill Kristol and the rest who don't care about us.
737314350227062784 2016-05-30 16:06:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics Nice, since he spent the last several days in Japan apologizing for us. Hope he knows how many died at Pearl Harbor/Pacific
737313739242799104 2016-05-30 16:04:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @west820 I agree. Vultures and eagles are diurnal like ospreys. I think it was an owl.
737276146841047040 2016-05-30 13:35:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Pretty soon, the construction crew is going to start charging Louis!  That is so funny that he is picking up lumber.
737270285791961089 2016-05-30 13:11:48 UTC <alclubb1967> @BillKristol Remember 1992 when Perot candidacy elected the other Clinton! Put your ego aside and save the Supreme Court from Hillary.
737100743996366848 2016-05-29 01:58:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @foolkillerskat Wow, that is so interesting.
737063138588131328 2016-05-29 23:28:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey That was amazing!
737047651061878784 2016-05-29 22:27:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest "They" need to be treated for the mental disorder they have instead of being enabled.Or, they could go to UK and dress up as dogs
737029349497442304 2016-05-29 21:14:24 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @amymlcollins I think it's a he too!  I have nothing to base that on, but I tend to call him a he.
737029049092968448 2016-05-29 21:13:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Oh, I just love Louis!  No plain everyday sticks for him. Next it will be a few bricks for a chimney.
737002513786769408 2016-05-29 19:27:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Since I live in Texas, we see more turkey vultures and red tailed hawks.  Only seen photos of eagles and ospreys
737001620295192576 2016-05-29 19:24:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Yeah, eagles don't have that bend in the wings. Sure is a strange angle though.
736995603540893697 2016-05-29 19:00:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I'm going for my 10th guess - LOL - and saying eagle.
736993411069140992 2016-05-29 18:51:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey The wing span is super long and the body is tiny.  I don't suppose there are albatrosses in Montana? LOL!
736984304241119232 2016-05-29 18:15:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Hang 4, Louis!  What a surfer dude!
736366976763723781 2016-05-27 01:22:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey You da man, Louis!
736335670017302530 2016-05-27 23:17:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Awwww, that's a shame. Louis is trying so hard.  Gotta love him!
736258045689221121 2016-05-27 18:09:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey The camera side of the nest is staring to look much better. Good job, Louis, on building up the sides.
736257619979964417 2016-05-27 18:07:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @Renorabbit @CornellCondors @QuailPat He/she is getting so big! I love watching how they grow up before our eyes.
736242310027968512 2016-05-27 17:07:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @bornbirding I had faith in you, Louis.  It's hard being the fish winner of the family!
735962933306351616 2016-05-26 22:36:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @GregAbbott_TX Don't mess with those Texans!
735625450156756992 2016-05-25 00:15:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Wow, you go, Louis
735498503380602880 2016-05-25 15:51:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @foolkillerskat Good job, Louis.  You are doing a great job.
735498408895483905 2016-05-25 15:51:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @BrendaC02333333 @HellgateOsprey @TWITLESSTWEETER I agree.  He is doing a wonderful job of bringing fish, egg sitting, building crib rails.
735495135287377921 2016-05-25 15:37:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @guardian When will Obama issue his next bathroom edict to allow fire hydrants in schools for those who identify as dogs.
735489086715232256 2016-05-25 15:13:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @FoxNews @RealJamesWoods Hmmm, that doesn't look like people who are willing to assimilate and become Americans.
735460451933257732 2016-05-25 13:20:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor They can do that because no stops them. Kind of like Obama!
735286624041324544 2016-05-24 01:49:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey That's a big difference in the age of the future chicks if both the May 2 and May 12 eggs hatch.
735263242868510720 2016-05-24 00:16:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Thank you.  I thought it was about that big when I saw the picture of the swallow in the cave.
735203022788132865 2016-05-24 20:17:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors How big is the chick now? About the size of a large chicken? Hard to tell without point of reference
735201073544060928 2016-05-24 20:09:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @o_marianne Hey, he brought her one big enough to feed a bear and she lost it. Poor Louis!
734896810435575808 2016-05-23 00:00:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey What does Iris's vocalization mean other than food begging? She seems to chatter a lot.
734882863926018048 2016-05-23 23:05:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @amymlcollins That is just so cute! I never thought birds would sleep like that.
734741534684258304 2016-05-23 13:43:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor But no one can draw a picture of Allah or they will be killed or put out of business.
734111115530010625 2016-05-21 19:58:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Wow!  That must have been quite a load.  Louis is lifting weights in his spare time.
734051536326656000 2016-05-21 16:01:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey That one stick looks like a 1 x 2.  Maybe Louis is going to Home Depot!  Good job, Handyman Louis.
733797503435317248 2016-05-20 23:12:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @betkhy Poor Louis! It looks like Iris is really giving him an earful - LOL!
733706835153149952 2016-05-20 17:11:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @kitson You go, little guy.  Love to see him hopping and flapping.
733697803763912704 2016-05-20 16:36:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Great job, Louis.  You are really doing all the right things!
733404391038812160 2016-05-19 21:10:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey It looks like the camera side of the nest needs some shoring up.
733382076406325248 2016-05-19 19:41:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Most wildlife cams don't name the birds so people won't think of them as pets.
733381653741981696 2016-05-19 19:39:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you for posting this. We must remember nature knows best even when sad.  We cannot put human emotions on the birds.
733375063357939712 2016-05-19 19:13:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle This has no basis in fact just like most of the PC agenda the liberals force on us.
733374755848474627 2016-05-19 19:12:21 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain Well, it's about time.  Way past time, in fact.  He complained that Trump is not conservative, but neither is Romney.
733346345856172032 2016-05-19 17:19:28 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I see Iris has a fish in the nest.  Louis must be providing enough for her. Good sign for the future hatchlings.
733345534812008449 2016-05-19 17:16:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Chick is really doing well standing on his feet. Way to go, sweet baby!pic.twitter.com/GG2lhVoh4i
733093014822739968 2016-05-18 00:32:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey What a nice tribute! Louis it is!
733060525177765888 2016-05-18 22:23:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I think he is just marvelous.  It just took him a very little while to get it all straight, but he's a real trooper now.

732614145002983424 2016-05-17 16:49:58 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Do ospreys often have trouble releasing the fish?
732555326487068676 2016-05-17 12:56:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @sissyhana Most wild animals do not eat on a regular schedule. It all depends on availability of prey & hunting conditions.
731960383263543296 2016-05-15 21:32:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @TWITLESSTWEETER Awwww, perfect picture.  I know I am being impatient, but I sure we had an official name for NG.
731955824621277184 2016-05-15 21:14:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I think he finally got the correct order: deliver fish, Iris leaves, he broods eggs!  Good job, NG.
731948364758011904 2016-05-15 20:44:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Why don't they just sit down and shut up so the rest of us can look to a future that doesn't involve Hillary Clinton!

731634994561482752 2016-05-14 23:59:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @mikes_booh I agree. He has earned his place and a name.
731569410373083136 2016-05-14 19:38:33 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Do the osprey ever "escort" an intruder out of the area like eagles do?

731545824426000384 2016-05-14 18:04:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey This is my first year watching so I didn't know Stan, but I really like this NG. He has really stepped up to the plate.
731542518291005440 2016-05-14 17:51:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest I just signed the petition.
731539580130729984 2016-05-14 17:40:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @foolkillerskat He's definitely made huge progress. I think he's a keeper!
731467955347709952 2016-05-14 12:55:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey What a spectacular defense of the nest by NG! Full battle mode!
731467356145229824 2016-05-14 12:53:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @SaaraHups Fabulous job! Look at that NG go! He certainly is in battle mode!
731226036961058817 2016-05-13 20:54:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @hippressurecook Great, but for those of us who are registered, will our comments still have to be moderated?

731193317522702337 2016-05-13 18:44:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle The Clintons are beyond disgusting.
731188885271629824 2016-05-13 18:26:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Isn't that what the east Europeans did for years? Weight lifters, etc.
731172275441930240 2016-05-13 17:20:29 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @SaaraHups I'm king of the world!
731152267261317122 2016-05-13 16:00:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Good for him.  I think that's a record!
731150570875019266 2016-05-13 15:54:14 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento Woohoo!  It took him a little while to go all the way down, but he did it!
731146253916983298 2016-05-13 15:37:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Fabulous pick!!
731133527106805760 2016-05-13 14:46:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey If all three eggs are viable, what would the hatch dates be?
731117294810628102 2016-05-13 13:42:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Oh, you go, little guy.  What a great photo.
731105124077068288 2016-05-13 12:53:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @instagram @OriginalYoni Hate the new logo! Go back to the old one.
731104750205210626 2016-05-13 12:52:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @instagram It's terrible. Can we please have the old one back? This one makes me want to uninstall the app!
730935001299066880 2016-05-12 01:37:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors He seems so relaxed and unconcerned.
730915596221579264 2016-05-12 00:20:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Since it seems as though Stan will not be returning, when will the NG get a name? I think he deserves one now.
730828613163974656 2016-05-12 18:34:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors @MsAfby You don't realize how big the chick is until you see a picture like that!
730785252717662211 2016-05-12 15:42:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @Honeybadger1206 Fabulous!  Thank you for posting that.  It was stunning.
730529643699175424 2016-05-11 22:46:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Is it still in the nest or did she drop it out?
730460994388951041 2016-05-11 18:14:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle YAY!
730460922020401153 2016-05-11 18:13:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @betkhy @HellgateOsprey While he's on the eggs, she can take a break and go catch herself a fish. Maybe this guy wants to be a Mr. Mom
730460053472346112 2016-05-11 18:10:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle I think he is a liberal; probably won't rescue a Republican!
730453588778967040 2016-05-11 17:44:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Out of those choices, I think I would press Alarm!
730430804073943042 2016-05-11 16:14:09 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Is it the darker one?  Is that the second egg was laid, the one after the raven stole the first one?
730419893141528576 2016-05-11 15:30:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey NG did a great job of defending. He went into defense mode even before Iris.
730419756797288448 2016-05-11 15:30:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @TWITLESSTWEETER @HellgateOsprey HOORAY!!!  I knew he could do it.
730414339568459776 2016-05-11 15:08:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I don't think God has a Twitter account, but hopefully he reads yours
730411821920747522 2016-05-11 14:58:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Did anyone ever see what happened to the egg that NG had in his beak yesterday?
730411336539066369 2016-05-11 14:56:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Hmmm, must have touched a nerve. You don't stop answering questions unless you are guilty of something.
730411181618266113 2016-05-11 14:56:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Yes, bravo to both Katie and Prince Harry.
730169594942349312 2016-05-10 22:56:11 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey  What is the latest an egg can be laid and still give the chick time to fledge before migration/winter?
730167415485566977 2016-05-10 22:47:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Has anyone seen NewGuy fully laying down to incubate the eggs? He seems to be everything else very well.
730085576502697984 2016-05-10 17:22:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Watching wildlife cams is a mixed blessing - sometimes joyful, sometimes educational, and sometimes sad.
730065824635977728 2016-05-10 16:03:51 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods I hope Trump uses that in one of his ads.
730064983376023553 2016-05-10 16:00:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods They are no different than the mainstream media. We have to work to find the real news. Most accept  what they are told.
730063598551113729 2016-05-10 15:55:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Hmmm, two of a kind isn't worth very much in a poker hand. Not worth very much for our future either!
729847845235261440 2016-05-09 01:37:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle Well, of course the do.  They know the military has been decimated, humiliated, and abandoned by the Obama/Hillary admin.
729788707025215489 2016-05-09 21:42:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods So much for free speech, freedom of expression, and freedom of religion.
729763138036371456 2016-05-09 20:01:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @LifeZette Great column, Laura.  You really laid it out perfectly.
729744200527269889 2016-05-09 18:45:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods But no one in the Obama administration will say a word.  They are too busy destroying the U.S. to bother with this stuff.
729439815049957376 2016-05-08 22:36:18 UTC <alclubb1967> @happynama @HellgateOsprey I saw where he went down in almost a complete reclining position but almost immediately came back up.
729419634063990784 2016-05-08 21:16:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento I think it was 2 fish.
729414035565727745 2016-05-08 20:53:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle It amazes me that they can be so immature as to risk the Supreme Court. We have supported their RINO choices for years.
729407871847256064 2016-05-08 20:29:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I don't know why I lean closer to my computer monitor when the cam operator zooms in close to the nest!
729406996881899521 2016-05-08 20:25:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey New Guy is getting better about bringing fish.  He just needs to figure out that he has to incubate the eggs and we're good
729330615036710914 2016-05-08 15:22:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @Tiger_Mz @HellgateOsprey @VRValicento  I know what can happen. Have watched eagle nests for many years. I try to be realistic/positive.
729326717215514624 2016-05-08 15:06:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey OOP! NG brought in huge stick, bonked Iris on the head and dropped it over the side. Well, good try, old boy!
729324038405783552 2016-05-08 14:56:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I think he is doing great. Better than many first time fathers!
729323680266747904 2016-05-08 14:54:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest Thank you for that list . Good to know who is willing to hand the White House to Hillary!
729308048573882368 2016-05-08 13:52:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods What a beautiful portrait of a lovely lady.  Sweet tribute.
729306382072053760 2016-05-08 13:46:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @VRValicento @HellgateOsprey He looks like he is learning quickly. I'll bet next time Iris leaves the nest he'll incubate the eggs.
729305782416596992 2016-05-08 13:43:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Wow, that is a nice stick. It amazes me that they can carry something that big and awkward while flying.
729121893685428224 2016-05-07 01:33:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @TroutBumDeb @HellgateOsprey Beautifully stated.
729048616623427585 2016-05-07 20:41:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Maybe if Iris stays gone long enough, he'll figure it out.
729048262016040960 2016-05-07 20:40:25 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey    New guy looks like he is thinking he should do something with those eggs but not quite sure. Come on, guy, lay down.
729044616511528964 2016-05-07 20:25:56 UTC <alclubb1967> Woohoo~ new guy brought in a fish. Did you see how fast Iris jerked it away from him.
729035026793299968 2016-05-07 19:47:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Do you know if Midas and his mate are having trouble getting fish too?
729016442956304385 2016-05-07 18:33:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey If new guy doesn't bring in some fish, how long will Iris wait before she leaves the nest to find food?
728941207028563972 2016-05-07 13:35:01 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey  I'm beginning to think the new guy is just too young to know what to do. He needs to go back to "mate/provider" school.
728940825254617088 2016-05-07 13:33:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @LindseyGrahamSC Really?  Will you help Pres. Hillary Clinton put more liberal justices on the Supreme Court!
728931396169793537 2016-05-07 12:56:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @Saidhbhin74 @HellgateOsprey Iris is probably thinking: Think again, old boy. Go get a fish and we'll talk!
728930865238020097 2016-05-07 12:53:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest But the rest of us had to hold our noses and vote for McCain and Romney and all the other RINOs they pushed on us.
728927358921494528 2016-05-07 12:39:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @BreitbartNews Where is he going to find someone? Are they working on a robot in his garage?
728707914794295297 2016-05-06 22:08:00 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics @JebBush @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews So much for the infamous pledge.
728679950199316480 2016-05-06 20:16:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey  Iris seems to have settled down to some serious incubating. Hope the new male keeps her supplied with fish.
728676229344153600 2016-05-06 20:02:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors He is the most adorable thing! I just want to cuddle him.
728664326043672580 2016-05-06 19:14:47 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey He better go get his tackle box and get busy!
728660872118198272 2016-05-06 19:01:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle That's par for the course.  He didn't vote for anything the people wanted him to vote for either.
728660072528650240 2016-05-06 18:57:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey  Has the new male brought any fish to the nest today?
728634527195664384 2016-05-06 17:16:23 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics It's not King for a Day like you thought it has been for 8 years either!
728585437044867072 2016-05-06 14:01:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey  Has the new male brought any fish to the nest for Iris?
728584536049655808 2016-05-06 13:57:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey I think New Guy is getting better at it!
728378412826398720 2016-05-05 00:18:40 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Why isn't Iris laying on the eggs?
728365361230315520 2016-05-05 23:26:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @mississuz @HellgateOsprey @natmoss Me too. I hate to see the eggs uncovered.
728361319355719681 2016-05-05 23:10:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @DLK30341 @HellgateOsprey @cukilcline Wish my husband had been by my side but husband's weren't allowed in the delivery room back then.
728360391722422272 2016-05-05 23:07:04 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Do Ospreys have a brood patch like eagles?
728327630185897985 2016-05-05 20:56:53 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey New Guy must think that fish is his lucky charm.
728327136944103424 2016-05-05 20:54:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics @SpeakerRyan So, he hopes to and he wants to but he's not ready.  What does that mean? What a crock of bullsh*t.
728298031104167936 2016-05-05 18:59:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Is the fish stuck on the male's talons?  Looks like he can't let go of it.
728271821594755072 2016-05-05 17:15:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @foxnewslatino So, I guess there should not be any DUI check points for New Year's or 4th of July??
728251865951961088 2016-05-05 15:55:49 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Isn't part of the reason the male seems so off balance is that he has to ball up his talons so as not to hurt the female?
728244659210756096 2016-05-05 15:27:11 UTC <alclubb1967> I'm with you, James.  #NeverHillary #CrookedHillaryClintonhttps://twitter.com/RealJamesWoods/status/728244336920399872
728244091394252800 2016-05-05 15:24:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Does Dr. Greene think the egg is viable?  If Iris lays more eggs, wouldn't there be a big difference in chick ages?
728025325502763008 2016-05-04 00:55:38 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Woohoo! Love how he's holding onto the wall.
728007160848769024 2016-05-04 23:43:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @RedState Good, since she used her response to the State of the Union to trash other Republicans instead of Obama/Hillary.
727939171956887552 2016-05-04 19:13:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain If anyone has doubts about voting for Trump, just ask yourself if you want 2-3 more liberal justices on the Supreme Court.
727937882866864128 2016-05-04 19:08:10 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest They would rather vote for a lying, unethical, hypocrite who'll ruin this country for decades with her Supreme Court appointees.
727929600542580736 2016-05-04 18:35:15 UTC <alclubb1967> @RLVall1 @HellgateOsprey Practice makes perfect.
727929252096565248 2016-05-04 18:33:52 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors He is a little stinker, isn't he - LOL!
727928288773967872 2016-05-04 18:30:02 UTC <alclubb1967> @betkhy @HellgateOsprey He is stunning!
727918658698104832 2016-05-04 17:51:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey This is my first osprey nest; I've watched eagle nests for years.
727917141530288128 2016-05-04 17:45:45 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey That sounds perfect.
727916157236187137 2016-05-04 17:41:50 UTC <alclubb1967> @franosch @HellgateOsprey @molinda123 Maybe the new guy needs a new name.
727903378269863936 2016-05-04 16:51:03 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Since the new guy hasn't noticed the egg or kicked it out, do you think he will how to incubate his eggs?
727900324577431553 2016-05-04 16:38:55 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Iris has a sort of bewildered look on her face. This guy just blew in and took over. LOL!
727899923614572545 2016-05-04 16:37:20 UTC <alclubb1967> @cukilcline @HellgateOsprey He's an achiever, that's for sure.
727899577534189568 2016-05-04 16:35:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Yes, he is.  He is bringing in sticks and redecorating.  He's good at those two things and is still perfecting mating.
727674753339641857 2016-05-03 01:42:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @GhentArt @HellgateOsprey He is a handsome devil!
727665520686718976 2016-05-03 01:05:54 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors That is adorable. He looks like he is playing airplane!
727644654510837760 2016-05-03 23:42:59 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey He certainly is making himself at home! Good for him. I like a decisive man!
727638019964997633 2016-05-03 23:16:37 UTC <alclubb1967> @Restful_Heart @HellgateOsprey He is very handsome. Maybe he's a younger man!!
727627173373206528 2016-05-03 22:33:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @TWITLESSTWEETER Four is too many but I'll take just one male to stick around for Iris, unless Stan shows up soon.
727595366758014976 2016-05-03 20:27:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Was that a new male on the nest with Iris just now? She seemed receptive.
727563299001241600 2016-05-03 18:19:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump The name of that particular third party would be RINO
727562925540433920 2016-05-03 18:18:13 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey   I'm sure you have answered this, and I apologize for repeating the question, but what is the latest that Stan has arrived?
727217113681694720 2016-05-02 19:24:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Nevermind. She was sitting on a fish and manteling. I saw a fly by from another bird.
727215568567197696 2016-05-02 19:17:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Is Iris laying another egg? She looks like she is in labor.
727171561845706752 2016-05-02 16:23:05 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors Thank you.  It's just like a human baby learning to walk and holding his arms out for balance.
727161066493333505 2016-05-02 15:41:22 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors At what age do the chicks stop crawling on the tarsus and stand on their feet?
727159347147497473 2016-05-02 15:34:32 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors He is handsome!
727159239756541952 2016-05-02 15:34:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors And what a cute bundle of fluff it is. Happy Four Week Anniversary. Wishing you many, many more!
726943819720101888 2016-05-01 01:18:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors That is the cutest thing. He looks like a little roly poly toy!
726561506226147329 2016-04-30 23:58:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @YouTube Wow, that was amazing. I had no idea ravens were that big.
726394218155905024 2016-04-30 12:54:12 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey @RosaItal Maybe Stanley will arrive soon.
726225586230697984 2016-04-29 01:44:07 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Poor Iris. I know I am like everyone else and wishing Stan would get himself back!
726148220548608000 2016-04-29 20:36:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle It shouldn't matter who it is or what they are protesting, if they are breaking the law they should be arrested.

724249651273048065 2016-04-24 14:52:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey What are the chances that Iris will choose another mate if Stanley doesn't show up soon?

722408234145816576 2016-04-19 12:55:19 UTC <alclubb1967> @foxnewspolitics Disgraceful! Why does this administration always choose the opposite side from what's right, whether foreign or American.
722147472152203265 2016-04-18 19:39:08 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Has the unknown male been back?
722091999231221760 2016-04-18 15:58:43 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Thank you for that information. That kind of what I thought when I asked that question yesterday.
721880115257298944 2016-04-17 01:56:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors They are such good parents.

721787134995116032 2016-04-17 19:47:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Oh, at least that way both nests stand a good chance of hatching and raising chicks.
721746708477050880 2016-04-17 17:06:39 UTC <alclubb1967> @Hi_Yo__Silver @HellgateOsprey That's fine, but if Midas has two nests/mates to take care of, I think one of the nests might suffer.
721731116806242305 2016-04-17 16:04:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey If Midas already has a mate, what will happen if Iris lays an egg from these matings before Stan shows up!
721488266218700804 2016-04-16 23:59:41 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Do you think Iris will choose the new male instead of Stan?
721424552060805120 2016-04-16 19:46:31 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Well, his mate needs to bonk him upside the head!
721423274148663297 2016-04-16 19:41:26 UTC <alclubb1967> @HellgateOsprey Is his mate on another nest? Or is he flying solo?

719601482828357632 2016-04-11 19:02:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @CornellCondors For being so large, it's amazing to see how tender the adults are with that little baby!

710843936986632192 2016-03-18 15:02:56 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor That's priceless!
710544131123118080 2016-03-17 19:11:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest What a stupid comment!  It shows that the establishment hates Cruz and Trump both but the voters don't want their candidates.

710453005007491072 2016-03-17 13:09:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @HistoryInPics He looks like a miniature James Brown.
710207284819853313 2016-03-16 20:53:06 UTC <alclubb1967> @hippressurecook That is almost identical to my Sicilian family's recipe!
709771710711468032 2016-03-15 16:02:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest I guess she can't count to four. Or, maybe it all depends on what your definition of "four" is!
709770745472155648 2016-03-15 15:58:27 UTC <alclubb1967> Wonder if the Republican elites need to take heed of the warning "Beware the Ides of March".
709101598983589888 2016-03-13 19:39:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @oreillyfactor They were moronic and shows that the left wants anyone not in their clique to be limited in their 1st amendment rights.
709037287804284929 2016-03-13 15:23:57 UTC <alclubb1967> @IngrahamAngle @WSJ Whether you agree or disagree with Trump, it is not OK to try to shut down his rallies.
708693688361201664 2016-03-12 16:38:36 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest That pretty much says it all!
708679385709019136 2016-03-12 15:41:46 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Because of Obama admin. tolerance of this kind of behavior, we now have mob rule! Very, very bad for America.
708331009708675075 2016-03-11 16:37:27 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest I originally supported Dr. Carson. What I noticed was his emphasis on letting the Amer. people decide and not the elites.
708080428368863232 2016-03-10 00:01:44 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain She is the most reprehensible human being ever!

705486023879307264 2016-03-03 20:12:30 UTC <alclubb1967> @MittRomney Yes you would have. All of you elites think we are stupid. Your failures and betrayals have led to Trump's rise. Deal with it!
705467202254733312 2016-03-03 18:57:42 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods Republicans eat their own and refuse to stand together against the Democrats.
705411481597153280 2016-03-03 15:16:17 UTC <alclubb1967> @THEHermanCain I agree with you. The "establishment" is the problem, not the solution. They are giving the election to Hillary

700063991393980416 2016-02-17 21:07:16 UTC <alclubb1967> @AllenWest If they cave on this, we can stop pretending we have a two party system and just admit they are just Dems in RINO clothes.
698250620831080449 2016-02-12 21:01:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @RealJamesWoods @FoxNews A Republican candidate in the same situation would have already been forced to resign.
697970020068950016 2016-02-11 02:26:35 UTC <alclubb1967> @dclubb25 She is like her parents in thinking they know better than God. Wouldn't want to be in their shoes when He points that out to them.
