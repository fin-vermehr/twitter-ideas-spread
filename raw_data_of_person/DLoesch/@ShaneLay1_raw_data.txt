971027792778362880 2018-03-06 14:20:41 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MarkTupper kids quit too easily these days.  blaming the system and quitting is the mentality and removes all self accountability.  He knew exactly the type of play Underwood has.  he cannot hit 3's unless open and can't finish layups right now. not system issue. stick w/it and develop.
969189665797496832 2018-03-01 12:36:37 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MarkTupper i'm just sick of losing in bball and football.... SO sick of it. my goal for next year would be to win games they're not supposed to win.  that would be a start.  it's been a decade since i've believed the illini can lace them up and win any game they play.
969049309688692737 2018-02-28 03:18:54 UTC <ShaneLay1> @AyoDos_11 @deonthomas25 Wondering why matic is on the roster. Might get  a good year out of ebo his sr yr.  Need athletes with a motor, can create (and make) shots and a Ken Norman around the rim.
969038254724075520 2018-02-28 02:34:58 UTC <ShaneLay1> @JWerner247 have said this repeatedly all year.... Tilmon and JCL would have completed this team to be 10x's more competitive.  BU would have been mid position bigten in first year with at least NIT tourney presence.
967838745260118018 2018-02-25 19:08:33 UTC <ShaneLay1> @FaceTheNation @WHRADER @RyanBakerMedia What's your fix?  More gun laws like Chicago?  More ppl killed in that city in week than 17.  Where's your outage for that? Good guys follow laws, not bad guys.  The reason more ppl weren't killed in the tx church shooting was because good guy had a gun. How many saved that day?
965428837021634561 2018-02-18 03:32:26 UTC <ShaneLay1> @JWerner247 i think that's his game in B10 games until his shot returns. lucas johnson stuff
963998907477970946 2018-02-14 04:50:24 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MarkTupper Nnanna was a great asset during a time of mediocrity. we've sunken lower so now he's an icon. is he even playing pro now in like bosnia or somewhere? #howthemightyhavefallen
963397700581515264 2018-02-13 13:01:25 UTC <ShaneLay1> @DPiper247 the return of Ken Norman???? the "Snake" 2?
962847330927042560 2018-02-11 00:34:27 UTC <ShaneLay1> @JWerner247 me thinks kip is not a competent dunker.  kenny battle could have dunked that blind folded back in the day.
962325663847010304 2018-02-10 14:01:32 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MarkTupper @hrpreps too bad JCL left but who knew that Mark Alstork would be so bad offensively..... Tilmon would be starting right now as well and Finke would be on the bench.  Two big losses to the program that would really be helping in the areas of shooting and rim protection.
955278633312145408 2018-01-21 03:19:09 UTC <ShaneLay1> @SteveMartinToGo @Clark_Carlson  can recite every scene of Planes, Trans and Automibiles... any talk of doing something like that again?  big fans since #wildandcrazyguys #thenerd #thosearentpillows
954807997057916936 2018-01-20 20:09:00 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MarkTupper Hate to play the "what if" game, BUT, what if we had Tilmon and JCL on this team?  With that said, don't want a kid who doesn't want to be orange and blue.
954789898313138177 2018-01-20 18:57:05 UTC <ShaneLay1> @IlliniRSmith Welcome coach. It's time to start winning......
952161661598695425 2018-01-13 12:53:25 UTC <ShaneLay1> @IlliniWTrack is the meet still on today?  the purdue one was cancelled
951817608764018693 2018-01-12 14:06:16 UTC <ShaneLay1> @jrrob231972 been fan since boy, 1970. lots of winning, especlly at home. Weber-Groce took to epic low ovr 10yrs. got give more patience but fans runnin out to give. program doesnt know how to win in P5 level. need to win games not supposd to give hope. need more players like @_Trentfrazier1
948703060582420480 2018-01-03 23:50:10 UTC <ShaneLay1> @IlliniMBB so remember.  no game was out of reach back then when we were actually good.  seems like an eternity ago.  hoping BU can get this going....
946026542932557824 2017-12-27 14:34:38 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MarkTupper with yet another lower B10 recruiting class coming in, i'm hoping that they can hire an OC that can get something out of lower talent players to compete.  he's not getting the talent i was hoping to make up his lack of coaching
944293638967840768 2017-12-22 19:48:42 UTC <ShaneLay1> @JWerner247 reading between the lines, he' still looking for something else.  why else would he not just sign?
944278954617294848 2017-12-22 18:50:21 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MarkTupper Tupps, any idea why Coran hasn't signed with the Illini yet?
943624852929417216 2017-12-20 23:31:11 UTC <ShaneLay1> @lukeredx97 From one 'down stater' to another.... ILL!
941119549595947008 2017-12-13 01:36:00 UTC <ShaneLay1> @JWerner247 my comic wife saw him for the first time and flippantly said "I need a bra for meh teets! she's got issues
938597211016921089 2017-12-06 02:33:08 UTC <ShaneLay1> @JWerner247 with AP overplaying passing lanes, how bout getting guards (mark smith in particular) with strong back cuts for maybe layups or freethrows?
937543930157191168 2017-12-03 04:47:46 UTC <ShaneLay1> @CoachUnderwood @smharrington24 i just want it to stay once it returns.  miss the days of your era with Lon Kruger and Bill Self.  Been Illini BBall and FBall since ~1975 when i was old enough to watch.  seen a lot of winning up until the last 10yrs. make Illini great again! #MIGA
937533509056557057 2017-12-03 04:06:21 UTC <ShaneLay1> @smharrington24 The Illini program doesn't know how to win anymore.  the culture is not there.  Hoping @CoachUnderwood can bring it back!
937526643576508417 2017-12-03 03:39:04 UTC <ShaneLay1> @JWerner247 they don't know how to win.  hopefully Brad Underwood can change this culture!
937509249768357893 2017-12-03 02:29:57 UTC <ShaneLay1> @JWerner247 if he can't sink any three's what does he bring?
937507059532255232 2017-12-03 02:21:15 UTC <ShaneLay1> @Malcolmillini21 @JWerner247 what does that mean exactly?
936827808399028225 2017-12-01 05:22:09 UTC <ShaneLay1> @stephenbardo down state Illini here since '69. i see where you comin from but the purpose of college is to get an education.  If you guys want to come for the $, you should create your own business avenue get to pro's.  college is for scholarships to play a sport to fund an education.
936819013450993666 2017-12-01 04:47:12 UTC <ShaneLay1> @JWerner247 #wewillwin???
936818841186852864 2017-12-01 04:46:31 UTC <ShaneLay1> @chiefilliniwek #wewillwin???
936804428224413696 2017-12-01 03:49:15 UTC <ShaneLay1> @JWerner247 how many rebounds does finke have?
936792835105349632 2017-12-01 03:03:11 UTC <ShaneLay1> @JWerner247  finkie is AWOL when we need him
936456554131357696 2017-11-30 04:46:55 UTC <ShaneLay1> @JWerner247 i see that auburn and georgia both stopped in to visit bigtime TE Luke Ford in downstate, IL Carterville.  no sign of IL stopping by. IL out of contention on in-state big recruit?
935721848058335234 2017-11-28 04:07:28 UTC <ShaneLay1> @JWerner247 it doesn't look too difficult to get by our guards and drive into the lane to the basket
935133805836369923 2017-11-27 13:10:47 UTC <ShaneLay1> @IlliniFootball @JWerner247 @ty6702 not sure where 'power running team' is coming from? certainly shouldn't be used in describing IL offense this year. Lovie stated numerous times over season to play the best players to get a win.  Crouch isn't even a QB now.  JG3 shouldve start with CT getting reps early in season
934981702354644994 2017-11-26 03:06:23 UTC <ShaneLay1> @IlliniFootball @JWerner247 @ty6702 That my argument. IL nvr has & nvr will have top class in bigten let alone nation. If lovie & co need betr playrs, he will be lucky to land a few 4 stars here and there and needs to get more out of what he's got. The fact they had crouch as #1 qb shows they can't evaluate talent.
934836284530577408 2017-11-26 17:28:33 UTC <ShaneLay1> @JWerner247 IU and PU have had comparable recruiting classes for years and yet they win more than UI. These programs have never nor will ever get top classes. coaching matters for us to get most out of talent we get. Same theme of always needing better players for every coach we have.
934817123993563136 2017-11-26 16:12:25 UTC <ShaneLay1> @JWerner247 in IL FB recruiting, was ~73rd 2016 (no 4-5star,19 3star), ~46th in 2017 (Lovie's first) yes? class eerily similar with no 4-5star, 26 3star. current 2018 class is ~64th with 1 4star, 12 3star.  If Whitman/lovie hanging rebuild on better players, where it coming from?
934798550281740288 2017-11-26 14:58:36 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MarkTupper just curious but do you know what created the Wisconsin football monster we know today?  i remember in my youth that Wisconsin was a horrible football team year after year.  Barry Alvarez initiated the turn. do you know how long it took him? did he go through this?
934796038501818368 2017-11-26 14:48:37 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MarkTupper This is what i point to in my issue with Lovie and the coaching staff.  sure you have to have good players but you have to be able to coach and get more out of them.  HOW in the world did the coaches not see Crouch is not a QB.  worse part is he was the starter!
932452910465732608 2017-11-19 03:37:52 UTC <ShaneLay1> so proud of my Maisie!https://twitter.com/GSTrackXC/status/932009126531608577
932322570959024128 2017-11-19 18:59:57 UTC <ShaneLay1> @JWerner247 We ALL know that and is why my beef.  they talked nothing but Crouch and his leadership before season, not one mention Cam was being a consideration. Ffwd to now and crouch not even a QB. Play him to get year before Coran arrives.
932260920369217536 2017-11-19 14:54:58 UTC <ShaneLay1> @JWerner247 my beef is that there's more to sustaining winning that just having good players and it seems like that's all this staff is hanging on to. would like to see more from what they have. how can you not know Cam Thomas not better than Crouch?
931364727896371200 2017-11-16 03:33:49 UTC <ShaneLay1> @GSTrackXC Seems like yesterday! Great kids great school great coaches!
929910533213638663 2017-11-12 03:15:22 UTC <ShaneLay1> @IlliniMBB @smharrington24 bring back winning! PLEASE!
924789130160168960 2017-10-29 00:04:45 UTC <ShaneLay1> @LovieSmith @IlliniFootball 6 consec losses is horrible for coaching staff of this caliber. Talent low or not! Complete labotomy better b legacy winning for decades!
923877670710140928 2017-10-27 11:42:56 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MarkTupper Chicago screwed up place. one of the armpits of the US. I remember Judson talkin bout needing to take a shower after some recruiting visits
922250788516384768 2017-10-22 23:58:17 UTC <ShaneLay1> on paper, is the Illini expected to win a game the rest of the year?  maybe purdue?
921933712316649478 2017-10-21 02:58:20 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MarkTupper question i have is is NFL coaches making big$ satisfactory for losing 5 consecutive non-competitive games? cubit could've done this! really!
921873816791474178 2017-10-21 23:00:20 UTC <ShaneLay1> @illinination14 these are NFL coaches.  can they not get more out of players than this??  Cubit could do this well! so sick of losing! #whenwillwewin?
921217228212768768 2017-10-19 03:31:17 UTC <ShaneLay1> @KedPrince4 illinination will support and represent! ILL-AYO!

921193503094435840 2017-10-19 01:57:00 UTC <ShaneLay1> @IlliniMBB @IlliniAD so excited but when does the LOI get signed?
921191750621908992 2017-10-19 01:50:02 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MarkTupper i'm am SOOO excited, tups, but when does he sign an LOI?!!!???? #ericgordon, #quintinsnider

917035165968412672 2017-10-08 14:33:15 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MartinOD64 you prob know more but methinks dwayne lawson should be playin now w/coran taylor behind him next yr taking over in 2020.  #makegrades!
913934211173769216 2017-09-29 01:11:10 UTC <ShaneLay1> @laytatochip I'd love to see that!
906565644589473792 2017-09-09 17:11:07 UTC <ShaneLay1> @GSTrackXC congrats!  all the way from San Diego!  wish we could have been there for it!
902497899124326400 2017-08-29 11:47:21 UTC <ShaneLay1> @chiefilliniwek lost huge respect for Josh.  this isn't leadership. its politics. leadership would be doing what's best for majority. say no to snowflakes
902497260285636610 2017-08-29 11:44:49 UTC <ShaneLay1> @chiefilliniwek lost big respect for Josh. this is not leadership, it's caving to politic and 'correctness'.
883168910459187200 2017-07-06 03:40:51 UTC <ShaneLay1> @djrich32 Hoping for the return with Trent Frazier, Mark Smith and???
870821095858896900 2017-06-02 01:55:02 UTC <ShaneLay1> Cam-Bam has officially gone Illini!  #wewillwinpic.twitter.com/fZHPFSi3Hv
848528961479081984 2017-04-02 13:34:03 UTC <ShaneLay1> @KendallG13 it seems to be a culture anymore, especially on the perimeter around the arc. i'd also point to 'following your shot' as a lost fundamental
845048382850830337 2017-03-23 23:03:29 UTC <ShaneLay1> there's a history with this in groce staff. darius paul (2 or 3x's?), aaron cosby, ray rice, nunn, tate, leron. BU hope not
844027228904177664 2017-03-20 03:25:47 UTC <ShaneLay1> @KennyBattle33 let's develop a winning culture starting now! go Illini!  (ps. i'm ISU sycamore alum, too). Go trees!

841837267312353280 2017-03-14 02:23:39 UTC <ShaneLay1> do they not have the mic's on during these interviews? invest in remote mic perhaps?
841458321009836032 2017-03-13 01:17:51 UTC <ShaneLay1> i fell asleep 90 seconds into the interview.  no energy at all

840718925923008515 2017-03-11 00:19:46 UTC <ShaneLay1> @djrich32 there's certainly a line not to cross but realize he's a millionaire & coaches basketball.  FAR more important jobs making less $
840683921532694529 2017-03-11 22:00:40 UTC <ShaneLay1> @IlliniMBB @RyanBakerMedia I also admire him as a person but I hve difficulty feeling sorry for anyone making $1.7M for coaching basketball
840550629953142784 2017-03-11 13:11:01 UTC <ShaneLay1> @KendallG13 while you're at it, the Illini need some help, too!
834258241404227585 2017-02-21 04:27:19 UTC <ShaneLay1> @kipset7 so why do you wear it upside down?
834232636734369792 2017-02-21 02:45:34 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MarkTupper i like malcom a lot but hasn't gotten majority of the calls for a lot of games now.  te'jon got a flob call and hill gets nothin

832359706861633538 2017-02-16 22:43:13 UTC <ShaneLay1> @corybradford13 also, I have an autographed ESPN Magazine with you on cover the day you broke the 3-point ncaa record for 3's made.
832359391982678016 2017-02-16 22:41:58 UTC <ShaneLay1> @corybradford13 yes, I remember you hitting  last-scnd 3 to beat IU. Was sweet.i live in Indiana and was in the thick of it at BW3's.
832207608631160833 2017-02-16 12:38:50 UTC <ShaneLay1> @corybradford13 sure miss those winning days! i remember your freshman year being tough but you guys turned it around pretty quick!
828009946042220546 2017-02-04 22:38:49 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MarkTupper seems like the best way for #illini to get back in the game is steals, layups. I'll bet they've had 5 all year. Dee had 5/game
826643825313640449 2017-01-31 04:10:20 UTC <ShaneLay1> @RyanBakerMedia illini games are like our nat'l debt. more going out than goin in!
826643145995726848 2017-01-31 04:07:38 UTC <ShaneLay1> so sick of losing. seems like that last year with Rayvonte where we lost by dble digits last few b10 game and NIT. 'barrasing
821867452745338880 2017-01-18 23:50:44 UTC <ShaneLay1> was a lifetime ago! sure miss the feeling of being good!https://twitter.com/BarstoolILL/status/821799252615688197
819348060811722753 2017-01-11 00:59:35 UTC <ShaneLay1> JC likly nvr give details, looks like more drama on this team.  nvr seen so much chemistry/off-court occrnces in a tenure
815248258830397440 2016-12-31 17:28:26 UTC <ShaneLay1> @WCIA3Bret great question. Who does he think needs to be asked that?  too many lopsided losses against div1 , especially this season
780751506001784832 2016-09-27 12:50:39 UTC <ShaneLay1> @RyanBakerMedia yes & has some of most strict gun laws in US.  gun policy not work on criminals, will get guns illegally regardless.
742476742904811521 2016-06-13 22:00:24 UTC <ShaneLay1> epic fail. 2nd amndmt isn't for hunting or even personal protection. stick to bicycles and leave my freedom alone. lost respect
711563560070062080 2016-03-20 14:42:27 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MarkTupper well put! same spirit of entitlement seen throughout the nation. kids these days feel they're owed something. #godhelpus
708869946105663488 2016-03-12 04:18:59 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MarkTupper  have we had a coaching staff with this much off court drama in the last 30 yrs? darius(twice), cosby, rice, tate!?! #poorjugmnt

697395540514861056 2016-02-10 12:23:48 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MarkTupper i read it similarly as well. part was 'oh no' and part of me was 'well, that's just Dee being "Dee".'  fearful of first thought
696403705399111680 2016-02-07 18:42:36 UTC <ShaneLay1> @rcrowe200 @ThomasZielke @MarkTupper  thnkn bout this rcntly, i rmber all the talk TA not really being a PG back then? what's changed??
696395586480635904 2016-02-07 18:10:20 UTC <ShaneLay1> @MarkTupper  Groce was at the game to watch and gets hurt and is out.  Need to quarantine Groce. he's jinxed or just has bad luck. #badluck
