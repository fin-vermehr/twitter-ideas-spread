968863672331194368 2018-02-28 15:01:14 UTC <tweetshanner> @KOAA Yes!!! It would save the district so much money. It would be a difficult transition at first though
968687128379932672 2018-02-27 03:19:43 UTC <tweetshanner> @ACLU @iGabRieL1995 @reenteringlife1 @Washyourowndish I can agree with most of that.
968686719817064449 2018-02-27 03:18:05 UTC <tweetshanner> @Washyourowndish They may be very smart ambitious young people. However I do not trust someone whose brain is not even fully developed to write policy or to push policy for this country.  If they start now & continue to educate themselves ill listen when they mature.
968475228262227968 2018-02-27 13:17:42 UTC <tweetshanner> @Students4LifeHQ Finally!!! Congrats to Valerie and Thanks to this administration for getting rid of failed methods and putting the decision back in the hands of our students by providing ALL the info on healthy choices.  Optimal health outcomes are the goal!!

968308437582049280 2018-02-26 02:14:56 UTC <tweetshanner> @ChieftainNews 9 hours of testimony and thats the only quote you got?
968229354474844160 2018-02-26 21:00:41 UTC <tweetshanner> @Shinto_Nephilim Seems pretty clear and concise  to me.  What part is a mess?   Amendment 2 - The Right to Bear Arms  A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
968135104345157632 2018-02-26 14:46:10 UTC <tweetshanner> @Shinto_Nephilim That is your opinion. Our forefathers thought differently. Our Constitution protects that specific liberty.

967837710097395712 2018-02-25 19:04:26 UTC <tweetshanner> @drmlb @ACLU @ian_rodd @reenteringlife1 Malpractice is their protection.  They arent legislated and told they cant practice what they were trained to do.  You are suggesting that since a few people cant follow the rules and arent capable of using their firearm safely then we should legislate restrictions for all.

967718528412364803 2018-02-25 11:10:51 UTC <tweetshanner> @Shinto_Nephilim What in your opinion is the right level of control?  At what point are you willing to foregoing your liberty?
967717860498751488 2018-02-25 11:08:11 UTC <tweetshanner> @ACLU @iGabRieL1995 @reenteringlife1 @nugslilsis Where did you read that?  I meant the authority to be the change agents of today as children were supposed to be protecting and guiding to become responsible citizens
967717181239672832 2018-02-25 11:05:29 UTC <tweetshanner> @drmlb @ACLU @ian_rodd @emilyfreas What does that have to do with anything?

967571120944640004 2018-02-24 01:25:06 UTC <tweetshanner> @ACLU @iGabRieL1995 @reenteringlife1 Naturally.  We just dont hear about the peaceful ones.
967570965910601728 2018-02-24 01:24:29 UTC <tweetshanner> @drmlb @ACLU @ian_rodd @reenteringlife1 I understand that.  Its not ideal@but still much more training then we currently have in schools to protect our children
967570740617789440 2018-02-24 01:23:35 UTC <tweetshanner> @united @CB09 There is that
967559704049106944 2018-02-24 00:39:44 UTC <tweetshanner> @ACLU @iGabRieL1995 @kenrentz @bthospo Good.  Im very glad to hear that.  I can only imagine the heaviness you and your children feel as you discuss what youre learning along the way.
967558936105705472 2018-02-24 00:36:41 UTC <tweetshanner> @ACLU @iGabRieL1995 @kenrentz @bthospo I can understand that.  However what current successful policy was enacted from a purely emotional justification?  I cant think of any.  All good policy comes from studying the issue from a logical and fully informed position.
967558475973779457 2018-02-24 00:34:51 UTC <tweetshanner> @ACLU @iGabRieL1995 @kenrentz @bthospo Youd be wrong.  I do.  I wouldnt discourage him from speaking but I will certainly discourage him from breaking known school rules in the process
967557861881528321 2018-02-24 00:32:25 UTC <tweetshanner> @ACLU @iGabRieL1995 @kenrentz @bthospo I want implying we shelter them but we should PROTECT them from the media who is just using them as mouth pieces to further  their own agenda and narrative. Instead Encourage them to study the issues fully and wholly before you no longer have any influence on them at all.
967557175471042560 2018-02-24 00:29:41 UTC <tweetshanner> @ACLU @iGabRieL1995 @kenrentz @bthospo Lets hope.  We need young people who will educate themselves on the issues and speak from a logical perspective.  Most often those with the passion to do so start young and from an emotional one. More likely however,  well never hear from them again.
967556499101777921 2018-02-24 00:27:00 UTC <tweetshanner> @NRA @united @20SidedGeis @latinflyboy @david_drhealey @NJWarrer Thats for you to deal with in your district with those you vote for.  If you dont want Oil $, Gun $, or Abortion $ then dont vote for people who take it.  Simple.
967555721909886976 2018-02-24 00:23:55 UTC <tweetshanner> @NRA @united @wide_tires @F16B @arizonageri Agreed!
967555594688188416 2018-02-24 00:23:24 UTC <tweetshanner> @NRA @united @wide_tires @F16B @AttiePDX I assume them you are also vehemently against Planned Parenthood for the same reason?
967554166674440193 2018-02-24 00:17:44 UTC <tweetshanner> @NRA @united @wide_tires @F16B @mrPchicago1968 Excellent Point
967554086680735744 2018-02-24 00:17:25 UTC <tweetshanner> @NRA @united @wide_tires @F16B What exactly would you have them do?
967553848075198464 2018-02-24 00:16:28 UTC <tweetshanner> @united @CB09 Id say full price people then deserve to be displaced.  There are so so many Discount programs why oh why would anyone pay full price?
967553305315438592 2018-02-24 00:14:18 UTC <tweetshanner> @ACLU @iGabRieL1995 Weve seen it over and over these last many years.  I cant remember the last time I saw a peaceful protest.  At least not since Dr. King.
967552435626455041 2018-02-24 00:10:51 UTC <tweetshanner> @drmlb @ACLU @ian_rodd @reenteringlife1 In order to get a concealed carry you must be trained.  In order to maintain that license you must keep certifying those abilities over time. Teachers or others who choose to go that route must be willing to use that training when needed.  Otherwise, they leave the weapon at home
967551919446147072 2018-02-24 00:08:48 UTC <tweetshanner> @ACLU @iGabRieL1995 @reenteringlife1 Sadly many times protests arent non-violent civil disobedience.  I hope these remain so but IF they arent THEN the children we have given this authority too must be held accountable.
967551482433216512 2018-02-24 00:07:04 UTC <tweetshanner> @ACLU @iGabRieL1995 @kenrentz @bthospo Its not their job. Its ours.  That is way too heavy a responsibility for a child and any parent who places that level of ownership on their child is doing them a grave injustice.
967550153635725312 2018-02-24 00:01:47 UTC <tweetshanner> @drmlb @ACLU @ian_rodd Fantasy doesnt and shouldnt equal reality.  You go on believing no one who educates your children have weapons and Ill be happy they do for the sake of your kids.
967549847036309505 2018-02-24 00:00:34 UTC <tweetshanner> @drmlb @ACLU @ian_rodd @Aaroninthe208 Thank you for being willing.  Im@glad you were there

967461366243106816 2018-02-24 18:08:58 UTC <tweetshanner> @drmlb @ACLU @ian_rodd Yes.  You have no idea how many people you see each day are carrying.  Im comforted knowing there are trained and certified people there to step in when needed

967450165262016512 2018-02-24 17:24:28 UTC <tweetshanner> @united @CB09 I agree.  They never should have been offered to begin which except that NRA members pay into the club to receive those perks.  Its not like United did it for free.  They did it to drive business to them.  Having a discount program has made them a LOT of money.

967438338230697985 2018-02-24 16:37:28 UTC <tweetshanner> @ACLU @Schneider4House If they protested away from the school sure
967437906024398848 2018-02-24 16:35:45 UTC <tweetshanner> @ACLU @iGabRieL1995 I wish they would.  A students job is to be in class.  If they are on school grounds and not in class they should be held accountable. Its not a difficult concept. Any disruption to property or on others ability to learn should also be dealt with.
967436370116362241 2018-02-24 16:29:39 UTC <tweetshanner> @LifeNewsHQ And yet I heard several Dr testify repeatedly calling this and APR junk science this week in Colorado. Its so sad what they are willing to risk just to keep their wallets full.
967433279145091072 2018-02-24 16:17:22 UTC <tweetshanner> @united Bad idea.  Youve already lost tons of business over how you treat passengers and now youre gonna lose a whole lot more.  Not smart. Just provide your service and leave politics out of it.
967078990342111232 2018-02-23 16:49:33 UTC <tweetshanner> It was encouraging though that we managed to spend over 9 hours discussing very emotional topics in a respectful manner. Hooray for democracy!
967078838030118912 2018-02-23 16:48:57 UTC <tweetshanner> It was sad in that all members of the committee already knew how theyd vote before any testimony was given.  They dug in their heels and voted the same way they thought they would before walking in the door.
967078627803217920 2018-02-23 16:48:06 UTC <tweetshanner> I spent the day at our states capital to witness and participate in committee hearings.

966470208733945856 2018-02-21 00:30:28 UTC <tweetshanner> @Soapbox_Atheist Yes, why wouldnt you?  Are they not human? Do they not have intrinsic value as such?
966437424942391296 2018-02-21 22:20:12 UTC <tweetshanner> @Soapbox_Atheist The 200 million people who found joy and peace through his ministry would not call it BS.
