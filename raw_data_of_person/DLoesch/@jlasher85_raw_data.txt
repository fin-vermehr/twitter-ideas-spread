970119313318449152 2018-03-03 02:10:42 UTC <jlasher85> @CBSNews This is a grave injustice, and a good example of when a lawsuit should be filed.  The state and justice system failed this man and he should absolutely be compensated for the lifetime he will never get back.

970117325281202176 2018-03-03 02:02:48 UTC <jlasher85> @michaeljknowles @andrewklavan That is cruel, but not too unusual.  I would make my minions do the same.
970117005931110400 2018-03-03 02:01:32 UTC <jlasher85> @TheDivisionGame @gamespot hmm...wonder if it's worth getting now with the updates.  I heard a lot of negative user reviews when it came out.
970116579546619904 2018-03-03 01:59:51 UTC <jlasher85> @bmkibler That is one majestic looking dog.  Shiro for prez 2020.
969812760631660544 2018-03-02 05:52:35 UTC <jlasher85> Oh to have an actual discussion with people of differing opinions instead of just having them deteriorate into name calling and ignorance.
969811984215625728 2018-03-02 05:49:29 UTC <jlasher85> @ABC Best way to watch it?  Easy, change the channel or better yet, go and do something productive.
969810755947257857 2018-03-02 05:44:37 UTC <jlasher85> Call me crazy but I would like to see that.  Especially if he does sets like "Lunch lady land"https://twitter.com/10TV/status/969776882634735616
969809948086603776 2018-03-02 05:41:24 UTC <jlasher85> @bdomenech My big fat Greek wedding was very good, I was pleasantly surprised with that one.  Does the Wedding Singer count as a chick flick?
969691184808513539 2018-03-02 21:49:29 UTC <jlasher85> @prageru @LilaGraceRose Very informative video, thanks for sharing!
969689975536185344 2018-03-02 21:44:40 UTC <jlasher85> @ABC I would love to see that in person some day.
969676681979056129 2018-03-02 20:51:51 UTC <jlasher85> @AmandaPresto That's like getting your talking points from The onion or Duffle blog lol
969676428831752192 2018-03-02 20:50:51 UTC <jlasher85> @MattsIdeaShop Well if this isn't an attack on freedom I don't know what is!  How will I stir my chai, soy, non-fat, organic, pan sexual latte?!
