969330440157978624 2018-03-01 21:56:00 UTC <EarthwormGods> @ThunderstormBks @BrianKeene @Adam_Cesare Sorry man, I tried.  Lol.  Such a great series.  Still waiting on my copy.
969296081141030912 2018-03-01 19:39:29 UTC <EarthwormGods> @ThunderstormBks @BrianKeene @Adam_Cesare Watch out for his stinger!
968101672114446336 2018-02-26 12:33:19 UTC <EarthwormGods> @ThatKevinSmith Holy Fuck man!  I wish you a speedy recovery.
967967815117541377 2018-02-25 03:41:25 UTC <EarthwormGods> @WalkrStalkrCon Only thing I liked about this episode, was the opening song by Harley Poe!
967406615061254147 2018-02-24 14:31:25 UTC <EarthwormGods> @GlintasticKevin For real.  Your art is amazing.  I bet a collaboration with some TennoGen artists would be welcome.
967404973503012864 2018-02-24 14:24:53 UTC <EarthwormGods> @GlintasticKevin Very cool.  That would be a bad ass warframe skin!  Ever think of doing skins in the TennoGen workshop?
967081222072623110 2018-02-23 16:58:25 UTC <EarthwormGods> @ConNooga @BrianKeene You need a bigger bottle of hand sanitizer!  Other than that, looks great.
964320612314468353 2018-02-15 02:08:44 UTC <EarthwormGods> @SonequaMG  Finally got a chance to finish season one of Discovery.  Wow, that was a great ride!  Looking forward to what comes next.
960565716717133825 2018-02-05 17:28:07 UTC <EarthwormGods> @Ruby_True This book helped me take control of my headaches/migraines.  How to heal your headaches, The 123 program.  Purchased it through Amazon.  Maybe it will help you as well.pic.twitter.com/NozGxTZQfh
960388650503753730 2018-02-04 05:44:32 UTC <EarthwormGods> @BrianKeene Did you watch it yet?  If so how was it?
959428502528413696 2018-02-02 14:09:14 UTC <EarthwormGods> @SonequaMG Met you at Walker Stalker NJ in Dec.  You said the second half of Discovery was going to be amazing. Man, you were wrong. It was mind blowing! Have not had goosebumps from a TV show in so long.  Thanks so much.  Keep it up!
958807007611555840 2018-01-31 20:59:39 UTC <EarthwormGods> @NeillBlomkamp How the fuck did you lose it?  Still one of my favorite movies to date!
958000643981152256 2018-01-29 15:35:26 UTC <EarthwormGods> @SonequaMG So I met you at Walker Stalker NJ this past December and you told me that the second half of Discovery was going to be amazing.  Man did you sell that statement short.  It has been so long since I actually got goosebumps from a tv show.  Thank you so much!!!!
957014524833431553 2018-01-26 22:16:57 UTC <EarthwormGods> @BrianKeene I luckly live far enough from the river and up on a hill, that it would take a Noah like flood to get me.

942050475163168770 2017-12-16 15:15:10 UTC <EarthwormGods> @BrianKeene @JonathanJanz Such an amazing read.  My favorite book!
941399170040115200 2017-12-14 20:07:07 UTC <EarthwormGods> @ThatKevinSmith  So I just wanted to say thanks.  I've recently been so fed up with politics, that I sought out other audible stimuli and found your Fatman on Batman podcast.  Even though they are old, I've started from the first one and I cannot stop listening to them.
932814416881639424 2017-11-20 03:34:22 UTC <EarthwormGods> @educationweek @usedgov @DCComics @thealexrossart This is just amazing.  The fact that you, at age six were already drawing comic characters.  You never gave up on your passion.  Thank God that you didnt!
931945989430226945 2017-11-18 18:03:33 UTC <EarthwormGods> @WalkrStalkrCon I was just told, that your company allows first responders a general admission pass for free.  And that they are available, even if the day is sold out.  Is this true?  Thanks.
931345293039296512 2017-11-16 02:16:36 UTC <EarthwormGods> @glennbeck Zombie apocalypse!
931334388591230976 2017-11-16 01:33:16 UTC <EarthwormGods> @therapyofficial Used to listen to you guys back in the 90s, absolutely loved you.  Found you on Spotify, listened to the live album with the the older songs.  I remembered all the lyrics!  Man, your music still gets me pumped!  Wish all of your older albums were on Spotify.
929026235975553025 2017-11-10 16:41:29 UTC <EarthwormGods> @BrianKeene Ordered mine 10 minutes after 1st post.  So happy!

924065860372848640 2017-10-27 00:10:44 UTC <EarthwormGods> @marysangiovanni @BrianKeene Just looking to make everyone happy, myself included!
924061244902068224 2017-10-27 23:52:23 UTC <EarthwormGods> @marysangiovanni @BrianKeene My little one loves animals.  So we figured Halloween at the zoo would be double excitement.
924060265418805248 2017-10-27 23:48:30 UTC <EarthwormGods> @marysangiovanni @BrianKeene We are going to Lake Tobias in Halifax PA, right outside of Harrisburg.

919521343510544389 2017-10-15 11:12:26 UTC <EarthwormGods> @gamespot I'm in my 40s.  Watchd DBZ in my teens, yet to this day, seeing Goku go ssj for the 1st time, still gives me goose bumps!
918859104285806592 2017-10-13 15:20:56 UTC <EarthwormGods> @gamespot Had this game pre-ordered, cancelled it after all the negative videos I saw in regards to loot boxes.  No thanks. 80 plus dollars saved!
