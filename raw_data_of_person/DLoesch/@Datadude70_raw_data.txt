969906623912214528 2018-03-03 12:05:33 UTC <Datadude70> @WIRED @jordanbpeterson It confuses me on why, when numbers, stats, nature and laws (natural) point to a proven truth, a company like Google blatantly ignores that. Diversity is a goal, not a product. I think they have it backwards and it will only hurt the product. (and people)

968818149901656064 2018-02-28 12:00:21 UTC <Datadude70> Point to ponder.  All women should carry pistol/revolver.  With the rape culture that Hollywood has established that has infected the country, it is almost necessary for all women to carry.  Self defense in any form is a human/God given right.

(York:2/12, McCarthy 2/13)  Notice something?  I have a hunch that Flynn plead guilty on purpose. Not to save money, but to open the file.  He never lied.
963501811893194752 2018-02-13 19:55:07 UTC <Datadude70> There are 2 q's that I know will never be answered but they have to be asked  1.

963501810290954246 2018-02-13 19:55:07 UTC <Datadude70> So, you have chosen sides? I am not that naive to know you were always a bit left. But to actively take part of a dis-information campaign against a sitting POTUS and dare I say an active player in a coup? I would say that's bad form and bad business.
963501808470712320 2018-02-13 19:55:06 UTC <Datadude70> You have one job and occupational protection provided by the Constitution and yet you ignore your responsibility. More and more though, it looks like you sold it to the state.  That makes you propagandists.

960214323393122304 2018-02-04 18:11:49 UTC <Datadude70> @Amy_Siskind Look at the original date of the first FISA. I believe it was in October '17.  Carter Paige left in September. Then reauthorized 3 more times based on same dossier. Even Politico had a big article on that inn September' 17. You're a hack or your horrible at math.
960149388554358786 2018-02-04 13:53:47 UTC <Datadude70> All of that while fighting off a coup. #MAGA
959928196962582528 2018-02-03 23:14:51 UTC <Datadude70> Let's think about this:  President Trump won the R nomination, (16 "seasoned" pols)  Beat HRC in the gen. election  Beat her again in MI, WI and OH recounts. (thnx Jill Stein)  Has done more for this country in 1 yr than the last 4 prez  While fighting a coup. @RealJamesWoods
959904830029484035 2018-02-03 21:42:00 UTC <Datadude70> @HeidiPrzybyla And, why wasn't that in the memo? Hint: because they made it a point not to.  The real shame is that 95% of the DOJ/FBI is honorable. Too bad the traitors f'd it up for them.
959903384005423104 2018-02-03 21:36:15 UTC <Datadude70> @HeidiPrzybyla So let me take this in, you are saying that a FISA knew about the origins of said documents (Steele D.) because the FBI Disclosed that info to the judge and still signed the warrent? Do you have any idea how idiotic and vapid that sounds? You are selling your soul.

But, I'm 99.98% sure that if you thought all this belly-aching about a memo was bad (Mind you, based on evidence already) releasing the evidence is going to set off new tantrum the likes we have never seen. It has all been fact checked by DOJ as correct

959492275666636800 2018-02-02 18:22:39 UTC <Datadude70> Then you have the Ohrs. Mrs Ohrs is coordinating with Fusion GPS and meshing that with the FBI all the while working for both. (active participation to manufacture evidence to use to secure a FISA)  I can see why the FBI didn't want this out.
959492273259106304 2018-02-02 18:22:39 UTC <Datadude70> I couldn't tell you if Carter Page is some one to look at, but as they say on the street, "Get that weak sauce outta here!" He was an excuse, a patsie to go after the big fish.  And remember, couldn't get a FISA on that alone. (most likely, 1rst FISA attempt)
959492271703019520 2018-02-02 18:22:38 UTC <Datadude70> The FBI paid for made up evidence to get a FISA warent that without that "dosier" it would not be granted. (LL, JC, RR, AM all knew it was horse-sh*t)  Fusion GPS along with Steel laid the media narrative thru yahoo to get the ball rolling for the propaganda machine. (MSM)
959420212096487426 2018-02-02 13:36:18 UTC <Datadude70> The left folks, full meltdown in progress.  Imagine Chernobyl + Fukushima + Hillary Clinton campaign.

959382718411956224 2018-02-02 11:07:19 UTC <Datadude70> It's black history month. Let's celebrate Hiram Revels. The first black senator. Republican black senator. If he was a Democrat back in the late 1800's, he would not have been a senator, that's for sure.
959375345723039744 2018-02-02 10:38:01 UTC <Datadude70> @Imperator_Rex3 F'n hilarious! Keep up the good work comradski!
959184228217966593 2018-02-01 21:58:35 UTC <Datadude70> Just wanted to thank you for guiding me to @ThomasWictor. And from him, many other great writers/thinkers.  Once you wake up, there's no going back. Miss your tweets. Peace. @therealroseanne
959174550356480000 2018-02-01 21:20:08 UTC <Datadude70> @allahpundit It's also a distraction from the fact Muller postponed Flynn sentencing. Between the judge recusing himself on the sentence phase (weird, right? I mean who does that and ? ) and the memo. I bet Flynn walks free and Muller found something. Hint. FISA abuse. Now it's criminal

959146363987542016 2018-02-01 19:28:07 UTC <Datadude70> @toddtalk @seanhannity If I am a Democrat and I think the memo is "non-factual" I would want it out. I could bury Nunes career and any republican associated with it.  I think the way they are crying, it's factual and it's very damaging. I can't wait to read it.
959142203091292162 2018-02-01 19:11:35 UTC <Datadude70> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Mr. President, please do not be fooled by the wailing and screaming from those who want the truth unseen, unheard, and limited. They do not care about the law or the truth, that is why they scream. #ReleaseTheMemo

958814907553722368 2018-01-31 21:31:02 UTC <Datadude70> 4. Then for the donkey punch, let's raise the gas tax 7 over 4yrs.  That's on top of one of the highest fuel tax in the nation.  At this point, the Governor, the legislators, and the socialists that run(ruin) HATE THEIR CITIZENRY.

958814902184968192 2018-01-31 21:31:01 UTC <Datadude70> 2. Any Rep/state official that sez this is also for new/rebuild projects is lying more than usual. Case in point, Waterbury 84 project has been going on for 15+ years. 95 corridor is/has been a death trap...oh let's put a toll there again
958814900385656832 2018-01-31 21:31:00 UTC <Datadude70> @toddtalk CT is in a death spin.  You were on point w/Rep Guerrero (?). So if I were to read between the lines it would be this:  1. The state has no more money (that includes diverted fed funds) that tolls are the only way to MAINTAIN the roads.

957731477831241733 2018-01-28 21:45:52 UTC <Datadude70> @toddtalk Malloy needs a lesson in civics.  Congress has sole responsibility to control taxation.  He's just upset that this exposes liberal grafting of the federal government.

957413214798704641 2018-01-27 00:41:12 UTC <Datadude70> @chuckwoolery Mr. Dershowitz is a man of honor.  He is a Democrat with liberal tendencies , grant you. But he is a disciple of the constitution, law and a devout Jew who has always been outspoken defender against ant-semitism.

957273504751276032 2018-01-27 15:26:03 UTC <Datadude70> So @realDonaldTrump "tried" to fire Muller. I don't think that's right.  He's the president, if he wanted him gone, he'd be gone. It's like "trying" to sh*t, you do or you don't.
957251558319763456 2018-01-27 13:58:51 UTC <Datadude70> @seanhannity I still see your account. Like back if it's still up

956854152910594048 2018-01-26 11:39:42 UTC <Datadude70> @DRUDGE_REPORT So the same DOJ that has been stone-walling congress for years now has a problem with not getting a memo. A memo based on information given to Nunes by said department. They already know what it sez.

946832528261943296 2017-12-29 19:57:20 UTC <Datadude70> @NowCremeCaramel That's what I've been saying. It HAS TO CHANGE.  IF IT DIDN'T WE WOULDN'T BE HERE. Sorry for yelling, stupidity make me cranky.
946770062945304576 2017-12-29 15:49:07 UTC <Datadude70> @POTUS @therealroseanne @realDonaldTrump I knew from the trip down the escalator that he was going to be POTUS. Not about HOW he said what he said, but that he was UNAPOLOGETIC and stood by what he said. I don't always agree, but he won't waggle his finger at you and shame you for not towing the line
946460836519870470 2017-12-28 19:20:22 UTC <Datadude70> @NetworksManager Are you fucking kidding me?

946454029768544256 2017-12-28 18:53:19 UTC <Datadude70> @therealroseanne (1)At this point, it is an active psy-op on the American people.  Let me rephrase for clarification: this is the same propaganda that Hitler/Goebbels used. Mass false/negative broadcasts to  Turn its people against a duly elected president  Let that sink in.
946334548383666176 2017-12-28 10:58:33 UTC <Datadude70> @GOPPollAnalyst One of my favorite line from Dave Chappell. "Chivalry is dead and women killed it."
946116316855001088 2017-12-27 20:31:22 UTC <Datadude70> @toddtalk Let's see 10 trillion in 8 years versus 1 trillion in 10 years(maybe). Well, I want a toilet seat made of gold but I'll take what I can get.

People who have mental and cognitive disabilities are MUCH smarter. These individuals are seditious and care not for freedom or liberty.  Zombies are more reasonable.

943568670109954049 2017-12-20 19:47:56 UTC <Datadude70> @DRUDGE_REPORT Why are you still running CNN feeds? It's not even shit news, it's straight up seditious lies and personally they should be shut down.

943270294478819328 2017-12-19 00:02:17 UTC <Datadude70> @GartrellLinda There is no other law than Sharia. All, let me say that again ALL faithful Muslims adhere to Sharia. How compatible do you think that is with Judeao-Christian beliefs and laws. They will not similate for it would be against their law.
943068780271464448 2017-12-19 10:41:33 UTC <Datadude70> @DonaldJTrumpJr I've learned what ever the Democrats/Liberals/Media blames anyone else for, they are doing in spades. Classic projection.

942382953052565505 2017-12-17 13:16:19 UTC <Datadude70> @mitchellvii These people actually LOVE the smell of their own farts.  That's how arrogance and ignorance gets to you. I bet he still thinks he's Batman.
941625518956384257 2017-12-15 11:06:32 UTC <Datadude70> @TomFitton I can not believe what I just read. These people should be ashamed of themselves. I've read harder hitting pieces from my third grader.

941085839001604098 2017-12-13 23:22:03 UTC <Datadude70> @ThomasWictor How does McCabe still have a job, let alone not in cuffs? How is Muller not been shown the door? What is going on? It appears there is now law for these people.
940670518386098176 2017-12-12 19:51:43 UTC <Datadude70> @toddtalk Some talking points if you don't have enough 1. MSM and State Media(China, Iran, North K..) compare and contrast  2. Democrats producing this bad high school play ie sexual harassment.  3. How the Libs found Jesus only a month ago/virtue-signaling
940665566632841216 2017-12-12 19:32:02 UTC <Datadude70> @chuckwoolery Chuck, I have a question, Did this senator take money from Weinstien? I bet she did.
940663137283526657 2017-12-12 19:22:23 UTC <Datadude70> @chuckwoolery Where was she on this subject when she was campaigning for Clintons?

940546563549560832 2017-12-12 11:39:09 UTC <Datadude70> @toddtalk The MSM is in full tilt TDS today.  It's getting a bit concerning.
940543877668368384 2017-12-12 11:28:29 UTC <Datadude70> @POTUS @EdMorrissey Shame on you @CBSNews. You seem to be jealous of @CNN. Well, keep trying and you too can become garbage!
940542910935785472 2017-12-12 11:24:39 UTC <Datadude70> @POTUS @EdMorrissey @CBSNews Also, any one see the irony? She feels objectified yet is at a beauty pagent? Where do we begin that discussion?
940542141947838465 2017-12-12 11:21:35 UTC <Datadude70> @POTUS @EdMorrissey @CBSNews Just to let you guys know, I am very aware that I am watching a Bad high school play. You would think that Soros would have better writers. Where's the Russian thing now?
940534788938715137 2017-12-12 10:52:22 UTC <Datadude70> @tedlieu My 11 year old just asked me why there are so many retarded people are allowed on Twitter. I scolded him and told him they prefer to be called Liberals.
940355084260605952 2017-12-11 22:58:17 UTC <Datadude70> @allahpundit I just have to say, I am very aware I am watching a bad high school play. Soros needs a better script writer. This is pathetic.
940347868652691458 2017-12-11 22:29:37 UTC <Datadude70> @benshapiro And you would think that Soros could afford a little better!? 
940344794798272513 2017-12-11 22:17:24 UTC <Datadude70> @benshapiro Absolutely not. This is a bad production of a high school play, where I'm very aware that it's a bad play. 
939977018455752704 2017-12-10 21:55:59 UTC <Datadude70> @BreeNewsome And you have to have a message. Hint; It can't be what you lost on, and it can't be "cause Trump".
939976314634801152 2017-12-10 21:53:11 UTC <Datadude70> @BreeNewsome The democratic party left the black voters, white working class voters, union voters...you saw that on display in 2016. They are still controlled by the Clintons so nothing is going to change

938910295396900864 2017-12-07 23:17:13 UTC <Datadude70> @jennajameson The "LBGTQ...." community are not interested in freedom of speech or opinion or debate. They are the definition of facists. No different from ANTIFA.  Then there are gay and lesbian people. There's a difference.

938176882645839872 2017-12-05 22:42:53 UTC <Datadude70> @mitchellvii Would it be bad taste if I said that I hope @morningmika gets herpes from her lover @JoeNBC. You know, herpes is like Jail, the rest of your life.
937351982624509952 2017-12-03 16:05:02 UTC <Datadude70> @GeorgeTakei The beauty of all your rants is nobody cares about you, HWood, MSM, Et al. You and your kind have made your selves irrelevant. You preach on high, but your words have no meaning. You scream in an echo chamber. You killed democracy, this is the by-product.
937337515765321728 2017-12-03 15:07:33 UTC <Datadude70> @GeorgeTakei You are all delusional.
937059134284947457 2017-12-02 20:41:21 UTC <Datadude70> @mitchellvii Polls aren't representative, they are now psych weapons /propaganda. Want proof, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016...especially 2016!
935628019414290432 2017-11-28 21:54:37 UTC <Datadude70> President Trump = Eric Cartman. Good, Bad and Indifferent. I love them both.

933480963924996102 2017-11-22 23:42:59 UTC <Datadude70> @jennajameson I know where you are coming from. Sometimes it's very difficult, but keep your faith, it will pay off. It is lonely in the valley of shadows, you shall be rewarded.

932566783005020160 2017-11-20 11:10:21 UTC <Datadude70> It has come to my attention that the Democrats have a new voter. Welcome Charles Manson to the dead  democrats club!
932240557505695745 2017-11-19 13:34:03 UTC <Datadude70> And just like that, President Trump got Lib-tards and the media to defend sexual predators. That man is amazing!
932216713273364480 2017-11-19 11:59:18 UTC <Datadude70> @DRUDGE_REPORT I'm going to talk about it.  Chase the snow flakes with some coffeve!

931852832772362240 2017-11-18 11:53:22 UTC <Datadude70> Charles Manson is about to die.  That means the Republicans are going to loose a voter and the Democrats are going to gain one.

929836177879859200 2017-11-12 22:19:54 UTC <Datadude70> @jennajameson I can't belive it myself. NYT actively and openly discussing racial segregation under the guise of racism. Why are we going backwards?
929772284998569987 2017-11-12 18:06:01 UTC <Datadude70> @Keurig you need to take a look at Kelloggs, Target, Macy's and the NFL before you make us stop abusing all our land fills with your stupid k-cups
929361581359628300 2017-11-11 14:54:02 UTC <Datadude70> @toddtalk @WalshFreedom This seems to smell to high heaven.  Could have had some credibility if it didn't come from WAPO, and 40 years ago. Smells like McCain and McConnell peed all over this dossier.
929101798346018816 2017-11-10 21:41:45 UTC <Datadude70> @toddtalk cut the cord years ago! Best thing I ever did. Bill was wayyyyy to high and was tired of paying for force fed leftist propaganda. Data to the house, smart-phones and books.
928926295689449472 2017-11-10 10:04:22 UTC <Datadude70> @steph93065 Seems to me that an Alabama paper would have run that story first.  To bad WAPO is a propaganda rag doing its bidding for the swamp. It's all gonna burn down.... Sooner than later...

927977463388491776 2017-11-07 19:14:02 UTC <Datadude70> @BreitbartNews Pedophilia is in the DSM, not homosexuality.  Still can't believe that diddler try to use that as cover.
