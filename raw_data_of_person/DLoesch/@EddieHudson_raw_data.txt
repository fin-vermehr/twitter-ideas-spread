971042449337536512 2018-03-06 15:18:55 UTC <EddieHudson> @pastormarkburns You could have been doing this all along, right? Why haven't you? It only sounds good when you're running office. You've already lost, sir.

970309875837427712 2018-03-04 14:47:56 UTC <EddieHudson> @EdLatimore Ortiz is a solid pro with power. Too bad hes damn near 45! Wilder may need more technical improvement but I think hell beat the brakes off Joshua.

968232037323821056 2018-02-26 21:11:21 UTC <EddieHudson> @NRA @Delta @CaseyCagle I believe this may be illegal. You should check with counsel whether this statement is appropriate. It should disqualify you from public office if voters understand.

965211227893981184 2018-02-18 13:07:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump Sir, I think you may go to prison and it scares you.

964929405666627586 2018-02-17 18:27:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @secupp I dont like calling anyone a hack, but using Chicago to buttress that tired lazy argument really puts you in the zip code the hacks inhabit. Thought you were better than that...

964651371189473280 2018-02-16 00:03:03 UTC <EddieHudson> @AMW_FC Itd be good business to let Pedro go. Bring back Musonda, Hudson-Odoi, etc.

964302999735685121 2018-02-15 00:58:45 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones @SamSawyer14 The point is its never as simple as the other side of the coin. Its why you have to imagine it. That guy from NYT had a moment where he told his truth and got dragged for it. The implication was pretty clear and said the secret part out loud. Thats what happened.

964292049544646656 2018-02-15 00:15:14 UTC <EddieHudson> @NicolleDWallace I appreciate you more as a host than I did as a panelist. I think you are doing a tremendous job.
964183528484364288 2018-02-15 17:04:01 UTC <EddieHudson> @AnnCoulter Did you think that was clever or funny while you wrote it? Did you believe that about the FBI allocating resources to be true as well?

958464886094352386 2018-01-30 22:20:10 UTC <EddieHudson> @maxkellerman @willcain @Real_Talk24_7 No. He really cant. The right to it is his whole platform. Nothing about responsibility and decency. Its why he insists on telling POC whats inbounds and what isnt.
958461142237700096 2018-01-30 22:05:18 UTC <EddieHudson> @jaketapper @TheLeadCNN Its why Democrats cant have nice things....
958400922232786944 2018-01-30 18:06:00 UTC <EddieHudson> @AMW_FC I wondered why he didn't play more at Arsenal. Lacazette could have used him to run off of, but what do I know. He's a good #2 for Chelsea. They've done good business.
958363480721063940 2018-01-30 15:37:13 UTC <EddieHudson> @CNN @RealCandaceO Very dishonest. That's a friend of his and he released the video. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Of course, you aren't though...

958120921734184962 2018-01-29 23:33:23 UTC <EddieHudson> @BradMossEsq Probably why letting him go wasnt very smart ultimately.
958120648458620930 2018-01-29 23:32:18 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle Youre convinced bc you know hell lie without reservation. So what does that say about you?
958073638728675328 2018-01-29 20:25:30 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke You are profoundly dimwitted...
958059019473752064 2018-01-29 19:27:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke Engaging in corruption? Like letting humans die in your jail because of your indifference?

956901384040910850 2018-01-26 14:47:22 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke Your twitter handle is the one I wanted exactly. Adam's handle, not yours David.
956716458561679360 2018-01-25 02:32:33 UTC <EddieHudson> @johnastoehr Democrats always find a way to screw it up on a national level. Its because of so many overlapping donors. Its unfortunate but I expect it again. Democrats are never afraid of their base.

956198262326943744 2018-01-24 16:13:25 UTC <EddieHudson> @reesewaters Convinced my wife that BOA is awful. Withdrew all money from there and never looked back.
956194621339693056 2018-01-24 15:58:57 UTC <EddieHudson> @senatorshoshana Disgusting. Also, imagine the cost involved in housing and the judicial system not moving their docket at a reasonable rate.

956191572026109952 2018-01-24 15:46:50 UTC <EddieHudson> @BSO I'm guessing by the picture that she favors her father. It's petty, I know....

955265221802815488 2018-01-21 02:25:51 UTC <EddieHudson> @AnnCoulter Amnesty is for people whove done something wrong. We dont attribute that to children, dum-dum. I think you know what youre doing unfortunately.
955227814327930880 2018-01-21 23:57:12 UTC <EddieHudson> @pastormarkburns I know you believe that to be a provocative statement, but it's silly. It's the type of statement used when you cannot win on the merits.
955208202374742016 2018-01-21 22:39:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @Lawrence Indeed. Worst ever.
955202407029444608 2018-01-21 22:16:15 UTC <EddieHudson> @LLamorandier I just don't understand the pleasure folks get from taking that position with any player. Why root for your team's failure?
955201228245479424 2018-01-21 22:11:34 UTC <EddieHudson> @thehill You need to state that this isn't editorial or you're misleading folks. Great way to prevent me from clicking anymore. I will not forget this.

952214690226204672 2018-01-13 16:24:08 UTC <EddieHudson> @FoxNews @SheriffClarke You have a white guy handling your Twitter account. Its so obvious now. That question about whether your statement was racist gave it away. Gotcha.
952026257130127366 2018-01-12 03:55:22 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord Jeff Lord the contortionist! He will twist himself in knots to defend Trump. The KKK is defending Trump but yet, if youre against Trump, you also are with THE KKK? Hilarious. Do you giggle while you type this bullshit?

951159800146079745 2018-01-10 18:32:22 UTC <EddieHudson> Yup. It's glaring. We know he wouldn't be called a cancer or fraud with that profile unless he's black. I don't really care for him but I know what I'm seeing. He disrupts the business and they can't handle it.https://twitter.com/BSO/status/951157011403571200

946823096023035904 2017-12-29 19:19:51 UTC <EddieHudson> @JLPtalk Dumbest tweet of the year. Congrats. Just under the wire. You have two more days to top this though.

943195992899375104 2017-12-19 19:07:03 UTC <EddieHudson> @ggreenwald @TheDesignFlaw If an investigation is commenced by a prosecutorial body it doesn't announce prima facie "evidence". That comes later. To deny the existence of evidence prior to that is questionable as YOU haven't any basis. It's not asking to prove a negative at all.
943186638632574977 2017-12-19 18:29:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @TheDesignFlaw @ggreenwald Wait. How would you actually know if there's a connection or not? How do you know there's no evidence? I don't care one way or another but you making statements like that show a bias that you can't afford to have if you're to be credible.

942942377119027201 2017-12-18 02:19:16 UTC <EddieHudson> @Brasilmagic His particular kind of delusion comes from not having his ideas consistently challenged or questioned. Maybe if he was black or a woman he wouldnt insist on everyone focusing on what he thinks.

935678297501036545 2017-11-28 01:14:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @johnastoehr It is okay to be white. It truly is. Just not to the detriment of everyone else. Why is that concept so hard to grasp?

930993743427178496 2017-11-15 02:59:40 UTC <EddieHudson> @Mediaite @realJeffreyLord @secupp Why now? To take some of the heat off of the guys implicated now? Why not five years ago? Why not a decade ago? Sounds like a partisan ploy to me. A little distasteful too considering you didnt give a damn about those women before now.
930989287960608768 2017-11-15 02:41:57 UTC <EddieHudson> @jemelehill Its how adolescent minds work. He associates like colors and things similar.

930830172248526849 2017-11-15 16:09:41 UTC <EddieHudson> @Shermichael_ He didn't have to tweet about it. Nothing presidential about it. I'd also like to know what he did specifically to get them back here. My guess is he wasn't involved in their release because he would have made a huge production of it if so.
930823381590728705 2017-11-15 15:42:42 UTC <EddieHudson> @MatthewACherry You'll never know with certainty that he had anything to do with their release either. I'm guessing he did not.
930822163615109120 2017-11-15 15:37:52 UTC <EddieHudson> Why would it be racist in any way? @SheriffClarke enjoys this sort of raw meat to feed his "fans".

930808721059356672 2017-11-15 14:44:27 UTC <EddieHudson> @SenatorStrange @hughhewitt Yup. Keep convincing yourself that's the democratic process we all intended. You don't care about your credibility at all? Not even a little bit?

929773631399518208 2017-11-12 18:11:22 UTC <EddieHudson> @JoyAnnReid Its amazing that they have attempted to conflate a legal standard with fitness for political office. An accused pedophile is not fit for office. Period.

929539655271440384 2017-11-11 02:41:38 UTC <EddieHudson> @thejimjams If Moore isnt prepared to file suit on Monday against the accusers and the paper, how is he credible?

927725498968526848 2017-11-06 02:32:49 UTC <EddieHudson> @thefader Bc he's a butt hurt "lil" boy?
927724930841669632 2017-11-06 02:30:34 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord @seanhannity Nope. Private citizen. Your Dear Leader saw fit to fire him. Sorry, he knows you nothing.
927721038825295878 2017-11-06 02:15:06 UTC <EddieHudson> @EWErickson Maybe follow a more diverse group and you'd get more news, perhaps?

927550498173083648 2017-11-06 14:57:26 UTC <EddieHudson> @js_edit Ive been saying it for years...
927548635323256832 2017-11-06 14:50:02 UTC <EddieHudson> @RapSheet Yes, Deon never tackled anyone but Tony should accept the clap back and move on. He shouldnt utter Deons name anymore.
927322739068866560 2017-11-05 23:52:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @politico Should we worry whether he signed up for Obamacare?

927285148793569280 2017-11-05 21:23:02 UTC <EddieHudson> @NBCLA @conanNBCLA I love Vin Scully and it's okay for him to be wrong about this.

923520058277625857 2017-10-26 12:01:54 UTC <EddieHudson> @CurtisScoon Id like to see him do well if for no other reason than to know black people are still relevant in Detroit.
923515580094787584 2017-10-26 11:44:07 UTC <EddieHudson> @CurtisScoon I live here in the suburbs now (regrettably) if you need any additional or different insight, hit me up. I Always have an opinion. Lol.
923514293542367232 2017-10-26 11:39:00 UTC <EddieHudson> @fivefifths He just thinks Trump told him to rebuild by himself.
923513930466713602 2017-10-26 11:37:33 UTC <EddieHudson> @CurtisScoon Hell need help bridging some gaps. Navigating the terrain will be tough. Lot of skeptics and self haters if you know what I mean.
923512403656048640 2017-10-26 11:31:29 UTC <EddieHudson> @CurtisScoon All true. Agree completely
923512247158263809 2017-10-26 11:30:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @CurtisScoon Dont get me wrong. Hes not a bad guy but his connects dont put him in place to make Detroit an international destination.
923511791208067072 2017-10-26 11:29:03 UTC <EddieHudson> @CurtisScoon Not a lot is expected from that state position. I think hell have a tougher time with younger folks who dont connect him w his dad.
923509220535951363 2017-10-26 11:18:50 UTC <EddieHudson> @CurtisScoon Thats probably more correct. I dont believe its his time. I think he needs a little more time to build his brand and some coalitions.
923508306181804032 2017-10-26 11:15:12 UTC <EddieHudson> @CurtisScoon Plenty meant folks in town. Not necessarily running for office. Sorry about that.
923371013718597632 2017-10-25 02:09:39 UTC <EddieHudson> @CurtisScoon You dont know what Detroit needs. I know that with certainty.
923370416080609281 2017-10-25 02:07:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @CurtisScoon Plenty of great potential black candidates for mayor. Just not this guy.
923369440066113536 2017-10-25 02:03:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @nwarikoo I would love to see another black mayor in Detroit but this guy aint the one. Definitely not the one.
923361115500838915 2017-10-25 01:30:19 UTC <EddieHudson> @ShannonSharpe Bam 
923360245228933121 2017-10-25 01:26:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @dailykos Hes thinking he has to rebuild it all by himself.
923311138317787136 2017-10-25 22:11:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @AriFleischer The real question would be: What the hell is wrong with your reading? You cant conclude that at all unless thats REALLY where you to be.
923307516448174080 2017-10-25 21:57:20 UTC <EddieHudson> @CarmenYulinCruz @WhitefishEnergy I dont believe youll get away with this for long. Somebody in Montana is going to prison for this eventually.
923248862067920896 2017-10-25 18:04:16 UTC <EddieHudson> @JulianAssange Oh yes, of course you rejected it...
923247203753299969 2017-10-25 17:57:41 UTC <EddieHudson> @willcain I like Will too. Only criticism: deliberately quick to call out black athletes w/out addressing the underlying issues adequately.
923193074133733381 2017-10-25 14:22:35 UTC <EddieHudson> @Slate Nope. Now let's move on....
923187644489785344 2017-10-25 14:01:01 UTC <EddieHudson> @thehill That's if he does it all by himself.

923181135923838976 2017-10-25 13:35:09 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord Yes, of course.... Up is down Down is up It's all so confusing. lol
923028739226832896 2017-10-24 03:29:35 UTC <EddieHudson> @ChuckGrassley You ought to retire sir. Youre and your cohorts are still scared of a woman who lost the election. Speaks volumes for your irrelevance.
923023808470142977 2017-10-24 03:09:59 UTC <EddieHudson> This is why Dems will continue to lose. Too busy being Republican Lite. Just want POC to co-sign then get out of the way.
923012734828011520 2017-10-24 02:25:59 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord @GaucheNews I personally dont care for the Clintons but I we all know this is probably nonsense. Jeff citing a felon is par for the course though.
922931505122353152 2017-10-24 21:03:12 UTC <EddieHudson> @nwarikoo @jackmjenkins @PressSec is as much a liar as the man she represents. Shes Baghdad Bob. They need to stop televising her briefings. Pure propaganda.

922893522692464640 2017-10-24 18:32:16 UTC <EddieHudson> @Eminem @spiceadams Made my day. Thanks. 
922827232350998528 2017-10-24 14:08:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @DetNewsOpinion @Ingrid_Jacques @dennislennox Jacques paints w/ a broad brush when needed. It was obvious the comment in context was about black athletes. It's insulting to deny this.
922816679024955392 2017-10-24 13:26:56 UTC <EddieHudson> @BillOReilly @JoyAnnReid Bill should go home. Close the shades. It's over. Media outlets should be openly shunned for booking him. God doesn't care if he's mad...
922811095567478784 2017-10-24 13:04:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @AditiJuneja3 Congrats.
922587116315410433 2017-10-23 22:14:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @yashar I wish hed do nothing to me then pay me 32mil. Thatd be awesome.
922586710038364161 2017-10-23 22:13:07 UTC <EddieHudson> @BillOReilly Good for you for maintaining your lie to the bitter end. Nobody gets 32mil for nothing. You cant nuance yourself out of that! 
922584808135495681 2017-10-23 22:05:33 UTC <EddieHudson> @PressSec If youre going to tell half-truths, you should have gone bigger than this. This is comical in its execution.

921941629530988544 2017-10-21 03:29:47 UTC <EddieHudson> @TalibKweli @DaBlaqTargaryen So is this some kind of performance? Seems weird to do for any extended period of time.
921937832201146369 2017-10-21 03:14:42 UTC <EddieHudson> @DaBlaqTargaryen @TalibKweli This guy is so obviously white.

921887846943903744 2017-10-21 23:56:05 UTC <EddieHudson> @democrapssuck So... now a lot of folks are pretty sure youre a racist. Congrats. I mean that was your intention, right?
921884729200271361 2017-10-21 23:43:41 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump Hasnt been discredited. Sorry Me. President. I think the walls are closing in, huh?

921432652124737537 2017-10-20 17:47:18 UTC <EddieHudson> @SunSentinel @nickconfessore It was a lie, Nick. It was a flat out lie.

921141963247816704 2017-10-19 22:32:12 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord Fact is, you dont know what evidence there is. Thats not even the point. You tweeted that bs earlier knowing this report was out there.

916468412712472576 2017-10-06 01:01:11 UTC <EddieHudson> @JuIIianAssange Ok Comrade. Come out of your cupboard and get some fresh air.
916463407733379077 2017-10-06 00:41:18 UTC <EddieHudson> @Arightside @SecretaryCarson Your buddy Mnuchin thinks differently. Foreclosed on many and took their homes. Remember that?
916461016225116161 2017-10-06 00:31:47 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord Right, because Im sure she knew about all of this. Youre pathetic dude.

916425564470349826 2017-10-06 22:10:55 UTC <EddieHudson> @ActualFlatticus @Ventuckyspaz Its hard to trust a felon like DSouza with the truth. He always seems to let you down.

916421376885522432 2017-10-06 21:54:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @NYDailyNews @LeonardGreene @CharlesPointer2 @rolandsmartin If young black men bought and registered guns, legislators would jump into action for sure. Youd know every stat about guns in USA.

916288034756333568 2017-10-06 13:04:25 UTC <EddieHudson> @ActualFlatticus Just a hunch, but if young black men started buying and registering guns, those numbers would firm up pretty damn quick.

915995422132396032 2017-10-05 17:41:41 UTC <EddieHudson> @60Minutes you just fawned over this man last week. Why no questions about this?https://twitter.com/codexrau/status/915640954488524801

915603424259055617 2017-10-04 15:44:02 UTC <EddieHudson> @Freeyourmindkid @ArtistNamed_DS @Brian_Chovanec Implicit in your question is that it's a ghetto before you get there. That's a problem itself. Beyond disrespectful. Not you but the notion.
915565553200312320 2017-10-04 13:13:32 UTC <EddieHudson> @Foxworth24 Maybe call it the "Deception". It's usually what got you there in the first place.

915179275925549056 2017-10-03 11:38:37 UTC <EddieHudson> @DonCheadle @Hotcarlito In real life  his parents should be telling him to stay out of grown folks conversations because he doesnt know what hes talking about.

914110057557700608 2017-09-30 12:49:55 UTC <EddieHudson> @willcain Video is heavily edited. Save the faux outrage. We still don't know the whole story. Not saying anyone is right or wrong but why edit video?
913955730486697984 2017-09-29 02:36:41 UTC <EddieHudson> @TomiLahren You're free to enlist too Tomi. You'd have to leave your parents house though because that's a real job.
913913377981952001 2017-09-29 23:48:23 UTC <EddieHudson> @deanofcomedy @realJeffreyLord Actually only 60% classified as white. 100% treated as "other".

912821805676662784 2017-09-26 23:30:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @funder As it should be.
912821548104503297 2017-09-26 23:29:51 UTC <EddieHudson> @LogicalHater He finally got his nose fixed and dropped 30 lbs. We'll see...
912821108398854144 2017-09-26 23:28:06 UTC <EddieHudson> @Arightside Most do not.
912821018124746752 2017-09-26 23:27:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @LogicalHater Just kidding. That spot is reserved for my Pistons most years. Never higher.
912820616524369920 2017-09-26 23:26:09 UTC <EddieHudson> @LogicalHater 8th seed. Shock the world 
912776650366029824 2017-09-26 20:31:26 UTC <EddieHudson> @DrDooleyMD You know this isn't true. Why would you post this?
912774614169899008 2017-09-26 20:23:21 UTC <EddieHudson> @Freeyourmindkid @sashajenn That is awesome. I'm going with that one all week.
912773259359342593 2017-09-26 20:17:58 UTC <EddieHudson> @ShaunKing They couldn't even be bothered with donating tickets to charity. It had to be some grandiose nonsense.
912772534013169664 2017-09-26 20:15:05 UTC <EddieHudson> @TaylorRooks @bomani_jones Dude is frighteningly illogical. Wow.
912730971056885762 2017-09-26 17:29:55 UTC <EddieHudson> @TeleFootball The guys whines about everything. Wow.
912723285904945153 2017-09-26 16:59:23 UTC <EddieHudson> @owillis That statement accompanied an old and little buttocks puckering that couldn't be seen under his pants.
912699834758520832 2017-09-26 15:26:12 UTC <EddieHudson> @ActualFlatticus In one, state and federal gov conspire to give you nothing. In the other only feds give you nothing.

912684789127417856 2017-09-26 14:26:25 UTC <EddieHudson> @sreekyshooter No-brainer...
912682535020384256 2017-09-26 14:17:27 UTC <EddieHudson> @LisaWashing @steelers @CBSPittsburgh Is he "embarrassed" enough to resign? Is the city "embarrassed" enough to fire him?
912670846505897984 2017-09-26 13:31:01 UTC <EddieHudson> @ActualFlatticus is correct. There are glaring differences between the two. Facts and process matter.
912655814116151297 2017-09-26 12:31:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones The fire chief keeps a list of "good" ones and "bad" ones? I went to law school in Pitt. I wonder which list I made.
912510472586481664 2017-09-25 02:53:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @ActualFlatticus I wouldn't even allow my kids to watch it. Never thought I'd want to punch a fictional Canadian kid...
912507468319686656 2017-09-25 02:41:48 UTC <EddieHudson> @LogicalHater Whoa. NYPD doing it like that now? I was just in Manhattan and must have missed it.
912506285907685376 2017-09-25 02:37:06 UTC <EddieHudson> @nwarikoo I'll pass.
912496530728390656 2017-09-25 01:58:20 UTC <EddieHudson> @Shannon_Penn Oh dear.
912484288356130816 2017-09-25 01:09:42 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke You don't even know what's in the bill. Get back to your thesis sir.
912461703333466112 2017-09-25 23:39:57 UTC <EddieHudson> @Arightside Some people just want to watch the world burn too. Remember that about some Trump voters in the future.
912459595112701954 2017-09-25 23:31:34 UTC <EddieHudson> @LogicalHater He flipped it on us! Did it for the jersey sales...
912442028478394368 2017-09-25 22:21:46 UTC <EddieHudson> @ActualFlatticus So concise and to the point. This is exactly the essence of it. Kudos.
912441138476445697 2017-09-25 22:18:14 UTC <EddieHudson> @Shermichael_ @Arightside Why do you both continue to support him when you see the obvious?

912435908540030981 2017-09-25 21:57:27 UTC <EddieHudson> @WalshFreedom Nope. Smh. Check your timeline again unless you're being willfully ignorant. Do better and make timely child support payments.
912434177831788550 2017-09-25 21:50:34 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord It's hilarious that you think you're on the side fighting for equality and a colorblind America. Who told you that? Who lied to you?
912363592116207619 2017-09-25 17:10:05 UTC <EddieHudson> @JohnCornyn now that you've been enlightened on why folks are protesting, does this change your perspective at all?https://twitter.com/JoyAnnReid/status/912002816025284608

912126660098560001 2017-09-24 01:28:36 UTC <EddieHudson> @glennbeck Glenn the protest is about police brutality and racism. Please don't lose sight of that. It's not about the flag or the anthem.
912125955883270145 2017-09-24 01:25:49 UTC <EddieHudson> @mitchellvii Tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest in our nation.

912085630632554497 2017-09-24 22:45:34 UTC <EddieHudson> @Rosenbergradio You're not the only one. Definitely eyebrow raising...
912075857061130240 2017-09-24 22:06:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @ActualFlatticus Boom.
912074862671343621 2017-09-24 22:02:47 UTC <EddieHudson> @mitchellvii @srr2 Maybe you should go somewhere where everyone agrees with you?
912074658425565184 2017-09-24 22:01:58 UTC <EddieHudson> @mitchellvii Amazing how many people will forgo your rights as an American when they disagree w/ you. The most un-American thing done in the whole world.
912072011769434113 2017-09-24 21:51:27 UTC <EddieHudson> @WalshFreedom You're a bigot for many reasons. Not the point. These athletes have EARNED their living. That whole "race card" thing is an old bit too.
912042101285818368 2017-09-24 19:52:36 UTC <EddieHudson> @Mikel_Jollett C'mon, you know only her emails are important to scrutinize. I'm sure these are on the up and up.
912037638026285064 2017-09-24 19:34:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @RodneyMarsh10 Explain.
912036632345370626 2017-09-24 19:30:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @POTUS @GeraldoRivera So seem to have forgotten your heritage and the struggles of your ancestors. It's why your credibility amongst them is zero.
912034995564371968 2017-09-24 19:24:22 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump Puerto Rico needs your help.

912013267412963335 2017-09-24 17:58:01 UTC <EddieHudson> @Broncos @MichaelSkolnik I hope they all explained to Broncos Derek Wolfe why they did it too.
912012115124326401 2017-09-24 17:53:27 UTC <EddieHudson> @TomiLahren For all the wrong things apparently...
912008290690887680 2017-09-24 17:38:15 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones @brianski71 So the argument is soldiers fought for your freedom of expression but don't dare exercise that freedom when I object to the timing?
912002792713269249 2017-09-24 17:16:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @YesYoureRacist You know people at home aren't standing for the anthem. That's why the complaints about players is so hypocritical.
911977848210157568 2017-09-24 15:37:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @JudgeJeanine Seriously? Powerful? You don't attribute adjectives to your own speech. It's why you don't have any credibility.

911767119527804930 2017-09-23 01:39:55 UTC <EddieHudson> @CillizzaCNN @ThrustonMorton Fans meaning "white fans"? That's the only safe assumption and owners won't dilute the product too much. They'll all learn to live with it.

911760686144983040 2017-09-23 01:14:21 UTC <EddieHudson> @LogicalHater I hate not liking a kid. I would have my youngest lump him up tbh though.
911758705271754752 2017-09-23 01:06:29 UTC <EddieHudson> @CillizzaCNN @ThrustonMorton "Marketplace consequences" in this context would be deliberate attempts to suppress free speech, right? What else could that mean?
911720553655996418 2017-09-23 22:34:53 UTC <EddieHudson> @ShannonSharpe @SmithBailbonds_ I don't understand why you follow Shannon then. He can only talk about what you like on his feed? If you agreed he could talk all day,huh?
911717178591805440 2017-09-23 22:21:28 UTC <EddieHudson> @ActualFlatticus Do the emojis at the end mean she's laughing really hard at that statement? Does she really think it's THAT funny? I don't quite get it...
911714770931343360 2017-09-23 22:11:54 UTC <EddieHudson> @971theticketxyt @patcaputo98 It's just easier to disagree without any foundation. Caputo has a black belt in that.

911647117139169281 2017-09-23 17:43:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord You think pinning slavery on the old Dems (now R's) will somehow change how everyone views you. Not a Dem and it's obviously absurd.

911545581402812416 2017-09-23 10:59:36 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke Funny. I was thinking the same about you. Maybe Trump and Hannity pull you aside and ask why you have no black friends too.

910962820564611073 2017-09-21 20:23:55 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke I can't believe so many people take you seriously.
910960293169254402 2017-09-21 20:13:53 UTC <EddieHudson> @piersmorgan So, you decide that in your column? I'm confused. You alone decide that? Ask a white girl if she's prepped to get beat up cuz of you...
910839880242036736 2017-09-21 12:15:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke You're a thug.

910465866713698304 2017-09-20 11:29:12 UTC <EddieHudson> @JZarif Fake empathy for your own people may be worse and I hate Trump. Iranians need free speech too.
910349947723292672 2017-09-19 03:48:35 UTC <EddieHudson> @lauferlaw @AuthorKimberley He's dishonest, like most felons.
910349761114525696 2017-09-19 03:47:51 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza So dishonest... like most felons.
910347391504666625 2017-09-19 03:38:26 UTC <EddieHudson> @soledadobrien Seriously? How can she not know this?

910306336176574464 2017-09-19 00:55:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @LLamorandier Make sure TJ Lang knows that. You know how he feels about PFF.
910293197003378688 2017-09-19 00:03:05 UTC <EddieHudson> @nwarikoo As @deray says, "Watch whiteness work."
910281815428157440 2017-09-19 23:17:51 UTC <EddieHudson> @Shermichael_ A great America does both.
910229150383984641 2017-09-19 19:48:35 UTC <EddieHudson> @rolandsmartin They should be working to get Flint the cleanest water in the USA to make up for state government incompetence and indifference.
910215136908136448 2017-09-19 18:52:54 UTC <EddieHudson> @CillizzaCNN With all due respect, you look foolish defending the foolish when you lower the bar continuously. Alas, you aren't the only one though.
910186854363942912 2017-09-19 17:00:31 UTC <EddieHudson> @ShaunKing But he's so clean cut! How could this be? He won't be called domestic terrorist one time on television either.
910185830249091072 2017-09-19 16:56:27 UTC <EddieHudson> @rolandsmartin TV won't call him that once though. Unless you do it.... repeatedly.
910184049850900481 2017-09-19 16:49:22 UTC <EddieHudson> @EricBoehlert So obvious to anyone paying the least bit of attention. Campaign finance reform is probably the most serious issue we don't talk regularly.
910151958216036354 2017-09-19 14:41:51 UTC <EddieHudson> @RogerJStoneJr Yeah. I think you may be in some trouble, huh?

907385906516123648 2017-09-11 23:30:33 UTC <EddieHudson> @CharlesMBlow He's taking a break from chasing girls that may be underage. He hasn't the stamina so he has to stop to tweet something absurd.
907381597493755904 2017-09-11 23:13:25 UTC <EddieHudson> @espn @bomani_jones @tlackey52 This dude wants to be free from the consequences of his actions. A white guy using that word is trying a power move and needs a beat down.
907366309247295488 2017-09-11 22:12:40 UTC <EddieHudson> @absurdistwords Another example of someone who loves their free speech but really just wants to be free from the consequences.

907348803266768896 2017-09-11 21:03:07 UTC <EddieHudson> @CillizzaCNN Many of us see more about how you handled it. I don't even care for HRC either. It's amazing to me what a blind spot you have for it too.

907286835566665730 2017-09-11 16:56:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @mattyglesias I don't care for her but this so true. You could see the glee in their eyes when discussing it.
907283178427179013 2017-09-11 16:42:20 UTC <EddieHudson> @joeprince___ Our memories are very short. Especially when we don't want to remember.
907261900257468417 2017-09-11 15:17:47 UTC <EddieHudson> @Dream_Chaser_Li @TalibKweli Excellent question! <Folds arms. Waits for the answer.>
907233308282585089 2017-09-11 13:24:10 UTC <EddieHudson> @kylemartino I'm glad he said it. Must be those Michigan roots. Gotta call it like you see it.
907081539367919616 2017-09-10 03:21:06 UTC <EddieHudson> @dandakich You should genuinely asking the question because you don't know if the tats are free. Not talking shit about without really knowing. Huh?
907067369083822082 2017-09-10 02:24:47 UTC <EddieHudson> @thehill You talking about the guy who lied 3 times about meeting Russians? That's odd...
907066780375449605 2017-09-10 02:22:27 UTC <EddieHudson> @CharlesPointer2 @washingtonpost Do you expect positive things to come from said meeting? I certainly don't. Neither does Tim Scott or Trump for that matter.

905193972368334848 2017-09-05 22:20:35 UTC <EddieHudson> @theodorelasso Tired of watching mediocre vets. I'd rather see young developing players. We aren't winning in Russia anyway.

905191760623697920 2017-09-05 22:11:48 UTC <EddieHudson> @ShannonSharpe Ask these guys if they are standing at home during the National Anthem. The answer is "no". Aren't they disrespecting the flag too? Idiots.

904907351517528065 2017-09-04 03:21:39 UTC <EddieHudson> @MSNBC @vikikdall1 Under the current statute you're incorrect. Good night now...
904906792198688770 2017-09-04 03:19:26 UTC <EddieHudson> @MSNBC @vikikdall1 That's your opinion. See how it differs from facts?
904906604600053761 2017-09-04 03:18:41 UTC <EddieHudson> @MSNBC @vikikdall1 I'm not here to explain American Jurisprudence to you. You don't know or don't agree with is how much latitude there is in an investigation.
904904993119105025 2017-09-04 03:12:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @MSNBC @vikikdall1 You don't know my view because I haven't shared it. You've said there's no evidence. You don't know that and you won't until it's over.
904904421494095872 2017-09-04 03:10:01 UTC <EddieHudson> @MSNBC @vikikdall1 I know this only because I've practiced law for 20 years. How about you?
904904196436189186 2017-09-04 03:09:07 UTC <EddieHudson> @MSNBC @vikikdall1 Nope. You want to shut it down bc you like Trump. You said there's no evidence. Remember that? I do. Not all cases are built in the media.
904903154147487744 2017-09-04 03:04:58 UTC <EddieHudson> @MSNBC @vikikdall1 You don't know what evidence there is. That's the fatal flaw in your argument. YOU DON'T KNOW YET!
904902674348474368 2017-09-04 03:03:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @MSNBC @vikikdall1 You haven't a clue what that investigation has turned up but willful ignorance helps to assume that there's nothing because you don't know.
904900546431242245 2017-09-04 02:54:37 UTC <EddieHudson> @MSNBC @vikikdall1 Of course, because one outlet may have said something about those emails.  That somehow discredits the entire investigation. Alright then.
904893573027516416 2017-09-04 02:26:54 UTC <EddieHudson> @MSNBC Seriously, what are you guys talking about? Why try to placate people with such a question when your whole programming suggests otherwise?
904891096580448260 2017-09-04 02:17:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @nwarikoo @briantashman Some would say it was foolish to support him initially considering who he was before the election. Call me crazy, but....
904884101773217796 2017-09-04 01:49:16 UTC <EddieHudson> @ByNateDavis @LLamorandier I agree with that assessment. I would have kept Kayaa because of his higher ceiling. I'd be definitely still looking for a solution there.
904867486549540869 2017-09-04 00:43:15 UTC <EddieHudson> @WickedBeaute I think my wife would have done a murder death kill at our nuptials if somebody even tried to get on one knee for some nonsense like that.

900033615949692928 2017-08-22 16:35:10 UTC <EddieHudson> @joeprince___ Could open up all kinds of civil claims though. He better be careful...
900032706695835648 2017-08-22 16:31:33 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones He's special. He's a white guy....
899996473957523456 2017-08-22 14:07:35 UTC <EddieHudson> @ShaunKing @bomani_jones Exactly!
899975953245511681 2017-08-22 12:46:02 UTC <EddieHudson> @KatrinaPierson @MadisonSiriusXM I don't think she's that young...
899971861798416384 2017-08-22 12:29:47 UTC <EddieHudson> @Freeyourmindkid @mercedes8118 You should go back to analyze your question and ask yourself if the phrasing is potentially offensive. Don't blame the U.S. either.
899818185238753284 2017-08-21 02:19:07 UTC <EddieHudson> @Freeyourmindkid @mercedes8118 Well actually you lead with diminishing people's experiences, so...
899815553837277185 2017-08-21 02:08:40 UTC <EddieHudson> @Freeyourmindkid @mercedes8118 So many people on Twitter want you to educate them for free and then devalue what you've told them. This is one of those times...
899813529825546240 2017-08-21 02:00:37 UTC <EddieHudson> @Arightside The man put a few sentences together from a script. Is he your king now? He basically called for never ending war. No changes at all. Wow.
899810070686511104 2017-08-21 01:46:53 UTC <EddieHudson> @DavidDTSS I bet it's a fake account. Probably set up this week. So many saying the exact same thing. No coincidence.
899799847007473664 2017-08-21 01:06:15 UTC <EddieHudson> @DavidDTSS You caught that too?
899775178124795905 2017-08-21 23:28:14 UTC <EddieHudson> @PrasMichel @Arightside Well that's not even true here. Provocative but false.
899773675292942336 2017-08-21 23:22:15 UTC <EddieHudson> @rolandsmartin @JoeTalkShow acting like the Republican isn't profoundly racist. Talking about 150 yrs ago. We're talking now son. Who r u fooling?

899630996777312256 2017-08-21 13:55:18 UTC <EddieHudson> @elyseiriss @mixielot Duh.
899622228572155905 2017-08-21 13:20:28 UTC <EddieHudson> @keithellison With all due respect Sir, we need an agenda from you more than praying for his downfall. That may come, but what happens after that?
899618811531460609 2017-08-21 13:06:53 UTC <EddieHudson> @carlcraignet everything good with you?
899612345500041217 2017-08-21 12:41:11 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord A Sunday with nothing to do, huh Jeff?
899370843515617281 2017-08-20 20:41:33 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord Cheap innuendo as usual Jeff. You should delete your account. You're barely tolerated at this point.

899298206135275528 2017-08-20 15:52:55 UTC <EddieHudson> @DineshDSouza You're a felonious clown. As if that Democratic Party is the same as the present day Party. If your audience buys this bullshit... 
899098097346899968 2017-08-19 02:37:45 UTC <EddieHudson> @browolfman @Freeyourmindkid I'm always impressed with how rehearsed these diatribes are. Like they've made incredible contributions to any of it. Hilarious.

898665480432619520 2017-08-18 21:58:41 UTC <EddieHudson> @JoyAnnReid I hope those crazy kids find a way to make it work after this. They're made for each other...
898652569475596289 2017-08-18 21:07:23 UTC <EddieHudson> @seanhannity @GovMikeHuckabee Bogged yourself down in the whataboutism, huh? So ridiculous... God's not really crazy about you by the way...
898619915862716416 2017-08-18 18:57:38 UTC <EddieHudson> @Arightside @NewsHour You'll find Mr. Williams on any safe right wing bandwagon these days. Thanks, Captain Obvious. Really went out on limb with this one...
898550645539700736 2017-08-18 14:22:22 UTC <EddieHudson> @CsnPhilly @NBCSAuthentic Maybe spend more time on why Jenkins is protesting. At least the same amount as Long's support of him. This is what infuriates many.
898548720756826113 2017-08-18 14:14:43 UTC <EddieHudson> @Brasilmagic That's what I was thinking when I saw this. The irony is thick with this one....
898540650169323521 2017-08-18 13:42:39 UTC <EddieHudson> @RedState That's hilarious. The answer is a resounding "Yes". Next question?
898535928129622016 2017-08-18 13:23:53 UTC <EddieHudson> @SRuhle @AliVelshi What an awesome takedown yesterday. Kudos to you both. Why do people think they can just say whatever they want?
898334692549603330 2017-08-17 00:04:15 UTC <EddieHudson> @lawflylikepaper Because he will say whatever he thinks white people want to hear. He also hates himself. It's obvious.
898326856331517953 2017-08-17 23:33:07 UTC <EddieHudson> @beINSPORTSUSA @PhilSchoen Doesn't seem like clubs are quick to sell though. Could it be because of all the money made in EPL?
898325854886940672 2017-08-17 23:29:08 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones @LADominate Sorry "Darryl". Pretending to be black on Twitter makes YOU a bad person.
898299330448281600 2017-08-17 21:43:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @Chelsea_HQ @amesinde_a I'm aware of the meaning champ. I stand by what I said. Doesn't bring the same level each week. I like him though.
898285805667442688 2017-08-17 20:50:00 UTC <EddieHudson> @Chelsea_HQ Definitely an upgrade. Moses isn't consistent.
898277662002601984 2017-08-17 20:17:38 UTC <EddieHudson> @elonjames Forever telling black folks what should be important and what isn't. Amazing they can't see it ever.
898275857168424960 2017-08-17 20:10:28 UTC <EddieHudson> @newtgingrich So to be clear, the statues come down and you won't argue? I may be naive too but I don't think u care about either of those cities though.

898247550079193088 2017-08-17 18:17:59 UTC <EddieHudson> @williamcson @guardian It's a ruse. Not a brilliant one either....

898221350346686465 2017-08-17 16:33:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord You're funny. They ought to put you on one of those panels on cable tv. Oh wait....
898201746480254976 2017-08-17 15:15:58 UTC <EddieHudson> @ShaunKing Wow @TexasTech ! What are you going to do? We'll wait....
898193383461724161 2017-08-17 14:42:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump @rolandsmartin Let's not forget that Russia is still the story.  We all knew who he was though.

898002620597579776 2017-08-16 02:04:43 UTC <EddieHudson> @thenewstribune Maybe @TNTMcGrath should step away from football bc he doesn't respect the Constitution. See how easy that is? Do better Mcgrath.
897955214933753856 2017-08-16 22:56:21 UTC <EddieHudson> @DineshDSouza You're a felonious kook! Hilarious analysis though.
897939893191491584 2017-08-16 21:55:28 UTC <EddieHudson> @GeraldoRivera Exactly! Yes, do that too! This outrage may finally get people moving in the right direction...
897939164997529602 2017-08-16 21:52:34 UTC <EddieHudson> @deray I hope he never comes back to Detroit. Disgraceful.

897934487954354178 2017-08-16 21:33:59 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump @SheriffClarke Future generations will spit when your name is uttered. We know this for sure...
897933933958111236 2017-08-16 21:31:47 UTC <EddieHudson> @pastormarkburns You do know MLK was killed after a peaceful protest, right? You're not very good at this, Sir.
897931654240509952 2017-08-16 21:22:43 UTC <EddieHudson> @POTUS @newtgingrich You're correct. Trump had already made those divisions in his mind and actions well before he was elected.
897893029121536000 2017-08-16 18:49:14 UTC <EddieHudson> @DrJasonJohnson Perspective is something else. That encapsulates the issue right there. A rally? With guns and riot gear?

897863613901352961 2017-08-16 16:52:21 UTC <EddieHudson> @glennbeck Probably not. Next question.
897855781667831808 2017-08-16 16:21:14 UTC <EddieHudson> @ActualFlatticus Kudos to you for well reasoned analysis. The challenge is always presenting this against ego and emotion on the other side.

897658361042415617 2017-08-15 03:16:45 UTC <EddieHudson> @charlesmurray @AnnCoulter Hello? Because you're on the side racism and bigotry. Very few people really like you or want to hear your blather.
897654802343186432 2017-08-15 03:02:37 UTC <EddieHudson> @DiamondandSilk You poor, sad ladies.... In that sunken place...
897654576593219584 2017-08-15 03:01:43 UTC <EddieHudson> @rolandsmartin Bro, that's too hard a question for those two ladies. You know that! They just say what they're told.

897574532713779201 2017-08-15 21:43:39 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump @AnnCoulter Ann, you're a racist. Plain and simple. You're just butt hurt when a college passes on your "talks". Nobody wants to hear that bullshit.
897564402022580224 2017-08-15 21:03:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump @detroitnews Oh boy. So sorry to hear that...
897563233443237888 2017-08-15 20:58:45 UTC <EddieHudson> @ApplePodcasts @MaxineWaters @angela_rye So obviously a white guy. Nobody else would call them self @Obamapeeps. What a joke.
897556923716845568 2017-08-15 20:33:41 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke Well friend it's because those were the guys who ultimately became modern day republicans. You should read a fucking book Sir.
897556276040785920 2017-08-15 20:31:06 UTC <EddieHudson> @LLamorandier I'd bring in Kruger to see if he has anything left. He had a great motor before the back injury.
897531790008754176 2017-08-15 18:53:48 UTC <EddieHudson> @Brasilmagic These young men make broad generalizations about everybody but demand proof when accused of the obvious.
897522335397408768 2017-08-15 18:16:14 UTC <EddieHudson> Exactly... https://twitter.com/goldietaylor/status/897505553374752769

897515656178003968 2017-08-15 17:49:42 UTC <EddieHudson> @glennbeck You know that's not true, but I guess it sells....
897510361510924290 2017-08-15 17:28:39 UTC <EddieHudson> @Brasilmagic My hope is that they are met with force if necessary before they get too close.

897290725427204098 2017-08-14 02:55:54 UTC <EddieHudson> @Olivianuzzi So why are you giving him a platform? Why even cover this trash?

897161286332665856 2017-08-14 18:21:33 UTC <EddieHudson> @JermichaelF88 @pkdnmaxey Why should people live in the boxes you try to put them in? That would mean you couldn't have an opinion on anything either, right?
897160654502678529 2017-08-14 18:19:03 UTC <EddieHudson> @JermichaelF88 Much respect brother but you've got this all wrong. Be brave because the children are watching. Athletes don't have to live on their knees.
897149502632726529 2017-08-14 17:34:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @AnnCoulter Oh I get it. Say the opposite of what's really happening and people become confused. How very cynical of you Ann. You get paid for this??
897143339514040321 2017-08-14 17:10:14 UTC <EddieHudson> @AnnCoulter Seriously, shut up. Nobody cares who you blame for no one liking you. Crack kills btw...

897127490354860032 2017-08-14 16:07:16 UTC <EddieHudson> @DLoesch BLM started because black boys were being shot in the streets by law enforcement. You said nothing.
897127099865157632 2017-08-14 16:05:43 UTC <EddieHudson> @DLoesch Who cares really after your bullshit videos? You don't defend black people's right to arm themselves so what you say rings hollow.
897082686019424257 2017-08-14 13:09:13 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord Oh, you deserved to be fired for many other occurrences anyway. Stop crying. Play within the standards you always hold others to.
897079503700328448 2017-08-14 12:56:35 UTC <EddieHudson> @Freeyourmindkid We have something for him...
896900519368810496 2017-08-13 01:05:22 UTC <EddieHudson> @CBSNews You meant to say "terrorist attack", right?
896859927683055616 2017-08-13 22:24:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @Freeyourmindkid You nailed it right there! All of this is really about their mediocrity. It doesn't get them far anymore and they're devastated.
896776505505845248 2017-08-13 16:52:34 UTC <EddieHudson> @JessicaTarlov @cbellantoni @MZHemingway @HowardKurtz Nope. Next question.
896714236495265793 2017-08-13 12:45:08 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump @SheriffClarke So you're backing Nazis as long as Trump does too? You can't pick a side either? You're a complete disgrace to this country.

896462371090305028 2017-08-12 20:04:19 UTC <EddieHudson> @Freeyourmindkid Well... I'm going to stay armed and ready. Never thought I'd get to this point but I'm there.
896459337056518148 2017-08-12 19:52:16 UTC <EddieHudson> @jaketapper Please call this terrorism. That's what it is. Have the courage to say it when appropriate. If that driver was Muslim that wouldn't be hard.
896457653911670784 2017-08-12 19:45:34 UTC <EddieHudson> @yashar @HallieJackson have the courage to call this terrorism on the air. That is exactly what is happening here. If the driver was Muslim...

896364582939348993 2017-08-12 13:35:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @AminESPN Conor won't the punches until Floyd is pulling his hands back. Then he'll realize he got popped.

896127254811467776 2017-08-11 21:52:41 UTC <EddieHudson> @elonjames She's just a mean and nasty person it appears. When you give off that stank vibe, it usually comes back twofold.
896111147497136128 2017-08-11 20:48:41 UTC <EddieHudson> @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews @seanhannity @SheriffClarke No thanks.
896043404873924609 2017-08-11 16:19:30 UTC <EddieHudson> @Bitchpuddingpie @rezaaslan He has the most punchable face, right? That's all I think about when he's on tv....
896012245922181120 2017-08-11 14:15:41 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord Solidarity in your bigotry. Aw, that's nice...

895784702023524352 2017-08-10 23:11:30 UTC <EddieHudson> @jfreewright Just glad he's gone. Never listened to anyone on camera. Just waited to speak again. Classic racist too. Good riddance.

895463780238348288 2017-08-09 01:56:16 UTC <EddieHudson> @DailyCaller @realJeffreyLord Reclaiming my time!
895404747510992896 2017-08-09 22:01:42 UTC <EddieHudson> @newtgingrich Pretty obvious you're on the payroll. How much for your credibility and integrity?
895335099402551297 2017-08-09 17:24:56 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord @leeclipperfan It appears MSNBC is the closest to telling the truth these days. No room for Jeff over there. Trump water boys need not apply.
894970866982948864 2017-08-08 17:17:37 UTC <EddieHudson> @ComfortablySmug Then she immediately walks out to bear false witness...
894955093904248833 2017-08-08 16:14:56 UTC <EddieHudson> @Bitchpuddingpie @nwarikoo I'm from the "D". The plan now is to push as many poor people out as possible. You can't print that in the pamphlet though....
894948121297420290 2017-08-08 15:47:14 UTC <EddieHudson> @ActualFlatticus Plain and simple. Dems lack courage bc they know corporate money is in center. Won't change until campaign finance reform.
894945511064702978 2017-08-08 15:36:51 UTC <EddieHudson> @DineshDSouza @glennbeck No thank you.
894927046606032896 2017-08-08 14:23:29 UTC <EddieHudson> @Brasilmagic Americans conveniently forget there are consequences for their free speech. We always want to be free from those consequences.

894727282366881792 2017-08-07 01:09:42 UTC <EddieHudson> @Bitchpuddingpie Dems need radical shift from the center. I don't think it happens until you get campaign finance reform though.
894705287508238336 2017-08-07 23:42:18 UTC <EddieHudson> @POTUS @GOP Stop lying to the people!
894704079276056581 2017-08-07 23:37:29 UTC <EddieHudson> @AriMelber Dershowitz has a disdain for the rule of law. He's the ultimate contrarian. That's why he'll defend anyone. Tasteless in this case though.
894672805584920576 2017-08-07 21:33:13 UTC <EddieHudson> @Mediaite @realJeffreyLord Oh right Jeff, of course... complete nonsense. You're too old to be a water boy. Not a good look for an old man.
894571907554701312 2017-08-07 14:52:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump @Arightside Bro, you're not alarmed by 45's propaganda tv but insulted by MSM saying he's on vacation. Losing credibility by the minute.
894297328546443265 2017-08-06 20:41:13 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump @RogerJStoneJr You guys believe regular folks will fight for you?  You've given nothing. It will be clear at some point soon. What a joke. Laughable.

894288737454227457 2017-08-06 20:07:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @marclamonthill They don't really care. As long as few players have anything to say, they'll continue to exploit. More black players need to speak up.

894192075041906689 2017-08-06 13:42:58 UTC <EddieHudson> @ReaganGomez When they become less innovative and creative they'll be looking to POC. Especially when the stock dip.

893684613650022401 2017-08-04 04:06:30 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump @SheriffClarke Like the promise of no vacations?  Give up this charade and find a job.
893683020984721408 2017-08-04 04:00:10 UTC <EddieHudson> @MCmuckraker @justinamash Why do you think the Koch's cast such an ominous shadow? Don't the optics concern you in any way?
893648342827188224 2017-08-04 01:42:22 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump @RogerJStoneJr So... you already know what's happening? That's cool.
893552351390445568 2017-08-04 19:20:56 UTC <EddieHudson> @scottienhughes None of what you just said is true. The public doesn't get "proof " of anything prior to this. All nonsense.
893530177149554688 2017-08-04 17:52:49 UTC <EddieHudson> @chucktodd @katiepack The last part simply isn't true. I was with until then. Significant numbers were against anything O said or did, i.e. Congress.
893514969383391232 2017-08-04 16:52:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @detroitnews @Ingrid_Jacques @NolanFinleyDN Always eyebrow raising when white people tell me what's racist and what isn't. But I'm sure you don't find that peculiar at all, right?
893510723762106368 2017-08-04 16:35:31 UTC <EddieHudson> @SenSanders You definitely need to engage with POC more.
893496194802089984 2017-08-04 15:37:47 UTC <EddieHudson> @yashar Good 4 U for having self control. If someone ever consistently called my work "fake", I'd slap the shit out of them repeatedly.
893472472133234688 2017-08-04 14:03:31 UTC <EddieHudson> @RealSkipBayless @undisputed Of course, you'll say anything to ingratiate yourself to NFL. You know Kap is even better right now.

893152580184006656 2017-08-03 16:52:23 UTC <EddieHudson> @CillizzaCNN She wouldn't say it was a lie.... because she would be Scarramucci'd out of there with the quickness.
893130219158155266 2017-08-03 15:23:32 UTC <EddieHudson> @AlexiLalas You're still Michigan "nice". A very good trait to keep.

892950681061031936 2017-08-02 03:30:07 UTC <EddieHudson> @VibeMagazine It's why Polanski doesn't come to the US. He's admitting R. Kelly is a perv too. Was that Nick's intention? 
892940508531761154 2017-08-02 02:49:41 UTC <EddieHudson> @MatthewACherry Means he'll probably be dead in 3 years... So that may be a good thing...
892928165080961026 2017-08-02 02:00:39 UTC <EddieHudson> @Acosta Brother, people only talk to you that way when they know you can't punch them in the mouth in the moment. He's a punk.
892868120385376256 2017-08-02 22:02:03 UTC <EddieHudson> @michigansoccer The answer is "no" and that's just fine too. #MLSDetroit .

892503154042032130 2017-08-01 21:51:48 UTC <EddieHudson> @ToneWritesTV An authority with regard your own experiences but not the community at large. You're incorrect in that assertion.
892452685160513539 2017-08-01 18:31:15 UTC <EddieHudson> @ShaunKing But could it be that he revealed more of himself for to change her mind? That was my experience with @SenSanders. honest question.
892219695612473345 2017-07-31 03:05:26 UTC <EddieHudson> @ColinCowherd @TheHerd So offensive only because it's mind-numbingly stupid. Typical from this guy...

891778836169461764 2017-07-30 21:53:37 UTC <EddieHudson> @Deadspin @AlbertBreer has very little access these days. That's my guess. Needs sensational articles to be relevant. Not a serious guy to me.
891772660807544832 2017-07-30 21:29:05 UTC <EddieHudson> @Freeyourmindkid She hovers around the boundaries of decency bc she knows no one will slap the shit out of her on a stage.
891701575680483329 2017-07-30 16:46:37 UTC <EddieHudson> @WSJ You really mean white people, yes? You should just say that instead of insulting hard working people of color in this country.
891502376363929600 2017-07-29 03:35:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord Many more find your level of discourse distasteful. She never said she "hated" you. It's your projection that's so obvious.

891301091144609793 2017-07-29 14:15:14 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones People don't want to recognize they're part of the problem on this. You'll never get a plausible explanation.

889856982202687490 2017-07-25 14:36:51 UTC <EddieHudson> @LindseyGrahamSC Maybe because you accept racism in all it's forms. If he's decent, I wonder who's indecent in your eyes. That person must be a monster!

889571821426757632 2017-07-24 19:43:44 UTC <EddieHudson> This here...https://twitter.com/evan_mcmullin/status/889540564512677888
889567235475361793 2017-07-24 19:25:30 UTC <EddieHudson> @TonyNam3 @futbol4life It's helpful only as a constant reminder of how insane he may be.
889506429513715712 2017-07-24 15:23:53 UTC <EddieHudson> @DetNewsOpinion @detroitnews @Ingrid_Jacques Very short sighted. That's not why he's being pushed out. If you didn't consider that, well.....
889501447888437248 2017-07-24 15:04:05 UTC <EddieHudson> @freep Yes. They screwed up badly. To say the least....
889485441187164160 2017-07-24 14:00:29 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones I'm embarrassed that 45 really only knows like 35 words well.
889479037357350918 2017-07-24 13:35:02 UTC <EddieHudson> I'm not optimistic either...https://twitter.com/DavidCayJ/status/889478422019403776
889305169875406848 2017-07-23 02:04:09 UTC <EddieHudson> @ReaganGomez It's why I'm not watching. I was hoping they let one loose by "accident" on Lochte. 
889292595658190848 2017-07-23 01:14:11 UTC <EddieHudson> @DrJillStein Organizing with Russian money, perhaps?
889238867341135873 2017-07-23 21:40:41 UTC <EddieHudson> @DavidDTSS Bootleg?
889199673663266816 2017-07-23 19:04:57 UTC <EddieHudson> @BradMossEsq I went to Duquesne and I would have called the FBI as well.
889130109705256960 2017-07-23 14:28:32 UTC <EddieHudson> @DatPiff Pun
888980047771709440 2017-07-22 04:32:14 UTC <EddieHudson> @stephenwertheim @nytopinion Obviously Fake News. Trump could not articulate any of this.
888917915860381696 2017-07-22 00:25:21 UTC <EddieHudson> @DrJillStein Not a Dem, but I'm convinced your grasp of reality is tenuous at best.
888847779862368257 2017-07-22 19:46:39 UTC <EddieHudson> @POTUS @Scaramucci Weak and sad...
888745331567071232 2017-07-22 12:59:33 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord So full of it...
888581687390679040 2017-07-21 02:09:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @CharlesMBlow Fired for collusion that didn't happen? How does Trump get around that?
888531528208097280 2017-07-21 22:49:59 UTC <EddieHudson> @Freeyourmindkid @EbonyBreeCaple Yup, but he's still awesome...
888531177950388224 2017-07-21 22:48:35 UTC <EddieHudson> @Freeyourmindkid Anybody seen Pat Boone doing Little Richard tunes? Hello?
888498696979132418 2017-07-21 20:39:31 UTC <EddieHudson> @AminESPN What? Kyrie for Reggie Jackson and two basketballs isn't possible?
888147262609797122 2017-07-20 21:23:03 UTC <EddieHudson> @larryelder The thing that changes that "fact" is an acquittal... I understand you have an opinion but damn, man.
888077121264001028 2017-07-20 16:44:20 UTC <EddieHudson> @carlcraignet What up doe?
887717711278739459 2017-07-19 16:56:10 UTC <EddieHudson> @JoeNBC Can you tell me anything Dems stand for right now? I haven't a clue. That's the problem right?
887491463881396224 2017-07-18 01:57:08 UTC <EddieHudson> @CNNPolitics @ALT_uscis @realJeffreyLord Country built on dissent. Not mindless drivel. Your speciality...
887490490811256832 2017-07-18 01:53:16 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord Do you really believe anyone thinks you're a serious person anymore?
887458000763596801 2017-07-18 23:44:10 UTC <EddieHudson> @deray Hey! Brittany Spears! I thought they did that one already?
887396068887080961 2017-07-18 19:38:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @epicurious So true. Please believe it...
887366071661023232 2017-07-18 17:38:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones Americans need to understand they elected a buffoon. A bullshitter. Period. It's embarrassing really.
887359479376994304 2017-07-18 17:12:40 UTC <EddieHudson> @thefader Always @JimsSouthStreet. Never Pat's for cheesesteaks. Ok? Thanks.
887310287174606848 2017-07-18 13:57:12 UTC <EddieHudson> @foxandfriends @GlennThrush I don't understand why reporters continue to go. Why not sit it out?

887057242939416576 2017-07-17 21:11:42 UTC <EddieHudson> @SteveDeaceShow @ZakiaVazquez @Tricornes No need to worry about me friend. I'm fine. You should hope to God for peace and prosperity for yourself.
887050604824207360 2017-07-17 20:45:19 UTC <EddieHudson> @SteveDeaceShow @Tricornes I merely posed an honest question which Steve kindly answered. You can move on now. Nothing to see here...
887045915768500224 2017-07-17 20:26:41 UTC <EddieHudson> @SteveDeaceShow I hope you can appreciate that viewpoint. Not trying to provoke you...
887045442797801472 2017-07-17 20:24:48 UTC <EddieHudson> @SteveDeaceShow Fine if you're demanding everyone have an intelligent/mature opinion on race. As long as it burns your ass when you hear from yt folks too.
887044084661182464 2017-07-17 20:19:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @SarahSpain I've never seen a man successfully rationalize male testosterone in sports...
887042992208572418 2017-07-17 20:15:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @SteveDeaceShow So minority millionaires shouldn't voice an opinion on race in America? Honest question...
887040856997462016 2017-07-17 20:06:35 UTC <EddieHudson> @ShannonSharpe @SteveDeaceShow You own a team? Not saying anyone's racist but entirely possible to pay market value and be racist. I think you're better than this.
887013651089063936 2017-07-17 18:18:28 UTC <EddieHudson> @AnnCoulter @futbol4life I'd personally upgrade if she sat next to me. Price would be no object...
887012794528387073 2017-07-17 18:15:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @MarcJSpearsESPN @nyknicks @TheUndefeated This is a very good man and comes from great stock. He will excel there.
886668612882313221 2017-07-16 19:27:25 UTC <EddieHudson> @JaySekulow @BradMossEsq Maybe Sekukow mentioned it bc Sr. was to be there as well? Just made a mistake and said it aloud.
886439262689931264 2017-07-15 04:16:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @GaryLineker That guy's lying. I want MLS to be better so badly but it's not even the same game as EPL.
886320018790789122 2017-07-15 20:22:14 UTC <EddieHudson> @BradMossEsq Brit's arrogance won't allow him to concede so he persists...
886246756404645888 2017-07-15 15:31:07 UTC <EddieHudson> @Forbes So... Black folks "hustle"? White people "invest"? You guys need to do better.
886074966155952128 2017-07-14 04:08:29 UTC <EddieHudson> @RayHudson When are you going to acknowledge me, your long lost Detroit cousin?
886055816775827456 2017-07-14 02:52:23 UTC <EddieHudson> @brithume Why don't you understand this is conspiracy? That's a crime in every state.
886049495682867200 2017-07-14 02:27:16 UTC <EddieHudson> @Bitchpuddingpie Absolutely.
885948778246807552 2017-07-14 19:47:03 UTC <EddieHudson> @DanielleRyanJ Bet you're regretting this a little... You should.
885938290507079680 2017-07-14 19:05:23 UTC <EddieHudson> @ShaunKing Love your work bro. Still don't understand the Bernie luv though.
885843165659484161 2017-07-14 12:47:23 UTC <EddieHudson> @Arightside How do know what was obtained at the meeting? You don't. Be careful bc you sound foolish repeating the party line.
885652926257127426 2017-07-13 00:11:26 UTC <EddieHudson> @newtgingrich Like you and the concept of matrimony?
885497660521820160 2017-07-13 13:54:28 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord You do know that Trump is President, right? Credit where it is due. You are the best "Whataboutist" on twitter though.
885496032817184770 2017-07-13 13:48:00 UTC <EddieHudson> @detroitnews Gimme a break....
885340363698950144 2017-07-12 03:29:26 UTC <EddieHudson> @Bitchpuddingpie Maybe not treason, but a federal crime nevertheless. I hate when media bend over backwards to appear fair. Makes them look foolish.
885276351183409152 2017-07-12 23:15:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @joeprince___ It's just a really bizarre perspective. Sometimes the arguments seem lazy as hell and others times completely oblivious of verified facts.
885275413215416320 2017-07-12 23:11:20 UTC <EddieHudson> @joeprince___ Do you think the lack of depth in their arguments is by design or just a blind spot? I'm not sure.
885165397833654272 2017-07-12 15:54:11 UTC <EddieHudson> @TruthFeedNews @realJeffreyLord Maybe you're a Russian tool. Hmmm... Kompromat, perhaps? Hmmm...
884961867487162368 2017-07-11 02:25:25 UTC <EddieHudson> @JoeNBC Orrin Hatch says the emails are nothing Joe. We should all probably just stop talking about this witch hunt. 
884593962564104193 2017-07-10 02:03:30 UTC <EddieHudson> @joeprince___ @futbol4life Taught Fanon. One of my favs. They all speak this way after depleting the resources and taking the best of what's there.
884579897896775680 2017-07-10 01:07:37 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke @carmeloarroyo2 @CharlesPointer2 @DRoofwood @ussarm You know I'm right. Don't worry. I don't need the validation so it's cool. You're welcome.
884571705624145920 2017-07-10 00:35:03 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke @carmeloarroyo2 @ussarm @CharlesPointer2 @DRoofwood Clarke tells you the "truth" you need apparently. He'll never defend a black person bc you'd become skeptical of him. He can't have that.
884550726009196544 2017-07-10 23:11:41 UTC <EddieHudson> @PatrickRuffini Getting oppo research from Russians stinks and everyone knows. Acknowledging... that's different. People are being too coy abt it though.
884430874753855489 2017-07-10 15:15:27 UTC <EddieHudson> @nypost @realJeffreyLord So Jeff, you're not concerned about the President's ties to Russia, only the lady who lost the election? Hmmm.
884239189419675648 2017-07-09 02:33:45 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord Of course...
884219906715254785 2017-07-09 01:17:08 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord What are your thoughts on Jr? Please do tell. I'd love to hear this pretzel logic...
884219531752861696 2017-07-09 01:15:39 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord So ridiculous. Getting nervous that your Supreme Leader is close to the edge? Hmmm?
883532601452929024 2017-07-07 03:46:02 UTC <EddieHudson> @RBReich So I'm to assume that Civil Rights will fix themselves? Every point mentioned is about finance. How about the soul of this country?
883441367568994304 2017-07-07 21:43:30 UTC <EddieHudson> @Bitchpuddingpie Lack of perspective, perhaps?
883382247956504576 2017-07-07 17:48:35 UTC <EddieHudson> @ReaganGomez I'm Gen X but I found out quickly that marriage and kids required money and a job.
883155041527267328 2017-07-06 02:45:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @CatchaRUSSpy @MalcolmNance @maddow @JoyAnnReid @JulianAssange Assange has no credibility. Russian pawn. Head of the He-Man Woman Haters Club too. What a joke. Come out of your hole sometime.
883068887746490368 2017-07-06 21:03:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @blackrepublican The man is a buffoon. Every black person should turn their back to him so that he's no longer useful to white folks.
882970912135421952 2017-07-06 14:34:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke Think of all the black crime victims in your jail...
882966084114014208 2017-07-06 14:14:53 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord Nope. Next question plz.
882723440288964608 2017-07-05 22:10:43 UTC <EddieHudson> @JamilahLemieux Done 
882713206094823424 2017-07-05 21:30:03 UTC <EddieHudson> @lilyachty @thefader Whoops! Thought this was @TheOnion. Oh, you guys are serious with this bullshit? My bad.
882704941436903424 2017-07-05 20:57:12 UTC <EddieHudson> @RZA Same birthday! Happy birthday brother. Peace and Blessings 2U.
882674805371162624 2017-07-05 18:57:27 UTC <EddieHudson> @JKH2 Regardless of your education and experience, they always seem to know a little bit more about it than you... Weird, huh?
882057309790273536 2017-07-03 02:03:45 UTC <EddieHudson> @BradMossEsq No, he thinks he's going to speak to everyone in Italy. He's that awesome!
882053304662011905 2017-07-03 01:47:50 UTC <EddieHudson> @CillizzaCNN Dangerously stupid lady with the crazy eyes...
882000174117158912 2017-07-03 22:16:42 UTC <EddieHudson> @CNN @realJeffreyLord No credit for doing what you're supposed to do. Sorry.
881999473987211264 2017-07-03 22:13:56 UTC <EddieHudson> @Bitchpuddingpie @JuddLegum I'm thinking it's Bc he died recently. This allows Trumpers to deny any connection. I'm sure Mueller has reviewed this though.
881988849290944512 2017-07-03 21:31:42 UTC <EddieHudson> @thesavoyshow Respectfully disagree bro. Mr. Johnson is about an inch deep and he lies about his bonafides. That's not leadership or revolutionary.
881983078243196928 2017-07-03 21:08:46 UTC <EddieHudson> @NBCNews Mistress?? If that makes you feel better about yourself... We all know you must consent to be a "mistress", right?
881916553897418752 2017-07-03 16:44:26 UTC <EddieHudson> @wpmiddleton @KiaSpeaks A leader should "transcend" you in some way. If he "transcends" by deceit or lying, he can't lead. It really is that simple.
881603986721316864 2017-07-02 20:02:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @AEI Wow. Seriously? You didn't "think" this through before posting this, huh?
880874014130008064 2017-06-30 19:41:45 UTC <EddieHudson> @keithfthurmanjr Congrats!
880873833770741760 2017-06-30 19:41:02 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump @SheriffClarke You seem healthy. Why won't you tangle with @JoyAnnReid? Grow a set and take the fake medals off before you go on.
880832212190494722 2017-06-30 16:55:39 UTC <EddieHudson> @arielhelwani Can we start talking Kevin Lee in that mix? I think he's ready. Plus, I'm from Detroit!
880826067098972161 2017-06-30 16:31:14 UTC <EddieHudson> @JoyAnnReid You just know his reference is to people of color. I'm embarrassed that he's American. That's the irony.
880812947374829568 2017-06-30 15:39:06 UTC <EddieHudson> @CillizzaCNN Perfection. That is it, exactly.
880810258347823104 2017-06-30 15:28:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @biannagolodryga Another feeble attempt at trying to be provocative...
880785814363537408 2017-06-30 13:51:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @epicurious wrong link perhaps?
880552042141552640 2017-06-29 22:22:21 UTC <EddieHudson> Wouldn't it be an opportune time for Dems to intro a single payer system as an alternative? Just saying...
880545841039237120 2017-06-29 21:57:42 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump @Randy513 @realJeffreyLord No Jeff. Not in this context. It's beneath the office. If you weren't the water boy for the team, you'd acknowledge that. Really pathetic.
880490686591758336 2017-06-29 18:18:33 UTC <EddieHudson> @Telemundo @FOXSoccer @futbol4life Watching online. <typing with the most disgusted look on my face>.
880475309329580032 2017-06-29 17:17:26 UTC <EddieHudson> @mattklewis Continued comparisons and links to how we got to Trump are clumsy at best. Saying "he's part of it" only works bc Obama was president.
880442281471488000 2017-06-29 15:06:12 UTC <EddieHudson> @MatthewACherry That's priceless. I had to look at it twice.
880440846696554496 2017-06-29 15:00:30 UTC <EddieHudson> @NormEisen @realJeffreyLord You support that the PRESIDENT should conduct himself in this way? It doesn't matter who instigated this. Your advocacy of it is pathetic.
880391931439788032 2017-06-29 11:46:08 UTC <EddieHudson> @DailyCaller @SheriffClarke They call you the N-word behind your back, Sheriff. Just in case you didn't know...
880230407190478848 2017-06-28 01:04:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @JKH2 Always 20lb bag. My wife is Filipina...
880110948803072003 2017-06-28 17:09:36 UTC <EddieHudson> Congrats ladies!https://twitter.com/Hawks_Wolves/status/879756532363218945
880087911756070912 2017-06-28 15:38:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @SarahLerner Insistence by McEnroe in comparing her to men is a tell that even he knows how great she is. He wouldn't engage if he thought otherwise.
879882411206733825 2017-06-27 02:01:28 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke Such bullshit. You're funny.
879873028645171200 2017-06-27 01:24:11 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord Nope. They didn't. Stop this madness.
879531368958636032 2017-06-26 02:46:33 UTC <EddieHudson> @BradMossEsq Your buddy below doesn't want to know the answer to your questions. That's why he's full of it.
879435138354094081 2017-06-26 20:24:10 UTC <EddieHudson> @Acosta Why not walk out?
878832958307672064 2017-06-24 04:31:19 UTC <EddieHudson> @TheRickWilson Ask Julian to come out of his little room and elaborate so that good people have opportunity to knock his head off!
878092029271605248 2017-06-22 03:27:08 UTC <EddieHudson> @TheRickWilson Listen to the first two Welles solo albums. They're incredible.
877644057270464513 2017-06-21 21:47:03 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump @SheriffClarke Then why does it seem like you're losing?
877213128857198592 2017-06-20 17:14:42 UTC <EddieHudson> @Freeyourmindkid Steven is going to get a lot of people hurt if they start believing that.
877141442057179136 2017-06-20 12:29:50 UTC <EddieHudson> @Kaepernick7 @AlbertBreer Almost like changing the channel when you don't like what's on anymore... Interesting concept.
876998477343051780 2017-06-19 03:01:45 UTC <EddieHudson> @elonjames Seriously?
876941484657954816 2017-06-19 23:15:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @JoyAnnReid Shots fired! Joy tell him to stop being such a little punk too. I can't think of anything more appropriate with this guy. What a punk...
876935035248680960 2017-06-19 22:49:39 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord Seriously absurd... You're don't have a real point here. Grasping at straws...
876891012664360961 2017-06-19 19:54:43 UTC <EddieHudson> @DaShanneStokes Born as a WM, he still believes he transcends those things.
876183252851195907 2017-06-17 21:02:20 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke Oh please shut up! Delete ur account!
875716592511971328 2017-06-16 14:08:00 UTC <EddieHudson> @ntegr8 @TalibKweli @SRassy "Racism" is in the dictionary. U can actually find the definition. Kweli isn't remotely "racist". You butt hurt wyt kids... jeez...
875714220209446912 2017-06-16 13:58:34 UTC <EddieHudson> @keithboykin Cuz something is on the horizon....

875332076408582144 2017-06-15 12:40:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @newtgingrich This rhetoric isn't good for the country and you know better. Sad!
875090783648534529 2017-06-14 20:41:15 UTC <EddieHudson> @dm3300 @CharlesPointer2 This isn't a real person. Trump bot. Pay her no mind.
875068139800850432 2017-06-14 19:11:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @Russian_Starr The irony is so thick in his reply and he can't even see it. Wow.
875038169825255428 2017-06-14 17:12:11 UTC <EddieHudson> @deoncole He comes from the future. We will all be doing that 2050. Trust me.

875014410187792384 2017-06-14 15:37:47 UTC <EddieHudson> @BradMossEsq Woooow, the internet always wins. Let this be the lesson.
874790941332295680 2017-06-13 00:49:47 UTC <EddieHudson> @POTUS @GovMikeHuckabee You haven't a clue what you're talking about! You only appear smart to unintelligent people. Stop this right now.
874740162445660162 2017-06-13 21:28:01 UTC <EddieHudson> @SteveDeaceShow Oh he can be racist and a tool for Russia. There's no contradiction there...
874658617630359552 2017-06-13 16:03:59 UTC <EddieHudson> @thefader Absolute nonsense. Please tell her as much. She needs to know this.
874648852984471552 2017-06-13 15:25:11 UTC <EddieHudson> @DonCheadle As she should. I'd create a prom if she said yes. I'm 45 and married.

874377749007355905 2017-06-12 21:27:55 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord Really disgraceful. You're too old to be the waterboy for this Prez. Gaslighting at it's finest.
874375564374814720 2017-06-12 21:19:14 UTC <EddieHudson> @ShaunKing Especially when the Party cannot convey a msg for what they stand for. Nothing to plainly identify them with. No plain message.
874360422769586176 2017-06-12 20:19:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @elyseiriss He sees the point of the article but doesn't want to admit they steal from black folks on the regular.
874294263198220288 2017-06-12 15:56:10 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump @Arightside Ah, in lockstep with the game plan I see! Used to think you were honorable. You aren't. You're too old to be water boy! 
874274817956073473 2017-06-12 14:38:54 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones "See" it but not "say" it bc they truly know the vulgarity in it all.

873709648884445184 2017-06-10 01:13:07 UTC <EddieHudson> @CurtisScoon Punks.
873708873017946113 2017-06-10 01:10:02 UTC <EddieHudson> Please do better. This isn't helpful at all. Not even to the folks you're supporting.
873707928443858944 2017-06-10 01:06:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @BrianStann nice watch! What is it?
873661904463462404 2017-06-10 22:03:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @stopbeingfamous It can only happen casually in the Twitterverse. These kids know better in real life. Know they'll get their ass stomped.
873659442172243968 2017-06-10 21:53:37 UTC <EddieHudson> @dcexaminer @JohnCornyn Personal notes from a private citizen at that point. How could you be troubled? Aren't you troubled by the President's behavior thus far?
873247067837276162 2017-06-09 18:34:59 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump @SheriffClarke Both of you are truly embarrassing to our country. Sheriff, when will you resign for killing those inmates?
873194634335440897 2017-06-09 15:06:38 UTC <EddieHudson> @CillizzaCNN You think Obama would have gotten that same free pass? 
873193479802953728 2017-06-09 15:02:03 UTC <EddieHudson> @Russian_Starr All presidents are new in their first term. Nobody's fucked up this bad before. Ryan knows nobody believes that mess.
872949257078231041 2017-06-08 22:51:36 UTC <EddieHudson> @BradMossEsq Not my area of practice but even I'm pretty sure he's wrong about that...
872842349390561280 2017-06-08 15:46:47 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones He's "Mister Law and Order"! That's where his credibility comes from.
872831713193406464 2017-06-08 15:04:31 UTC <EddieHudson> @AriMelber Context matters here. "I hope" certainly can be an attempt to persuade corruptly....

872642341424836609 2017-06-07 02:32:01 UTC <EddieHudson> @SethAbramson I think he might be subtly interviewing to represent Trump or someone close.

872599783080427520 2017-06-07 23:42:55 UTC <EddieHudson> @BradMossEsq Who hurt Chuck's feelings?
872482028763176960 2017-06-07 15:55:00 UTC <EddieHudson> @SteveDeaceShow What's conservatism to you? Honest question. From MI btw...
872481673723748354 2017-06-07 15:53:35 UTC <EddieHudson> @Arightside Just not true and u know it. U have an incredible platform to uplift people but u choose to divide by aligning yourself w/ intolerance. Sad!
872478332943839232 2017-06-07 15:40:19 UTC <EddieHudson> @NicolleDWallace @SRuhle If you know you will not do it, you feel no pressure obviously. Their responses seemed obvious to me despite the veiled denials.
872442015816048640 2017-06-07 13:16:00 UTC <EddieHudson> @AminESPN I'm from the D. I've been to Phoenix. It's nice. Really nice...
872289226691416065 2017-06-06 03:08:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @WhitlockJason "These guys"... You mean black men that respect other black men? The optics look bad for you, my friend. You should rethink your position.
872226968632266752 2017-06-06 23:01:29 UTC <EddieHudson> @deray Well that would be just fine. He should just leave his contact info for that indictment coming his way later.
872132802405429248 2017-06-06 16:47:18 UTC <EddieHudson> @wordpressdotcom Cheers to Celine, @TerryFoster971. You guys did a great job! Zoe says congrats too!
872093651819798528 2017-06-06 14:11:43 UTC <EddieHudson> Nonsense @Arightside. @billmaher stepped outside of what's acceptable. "Conservatives" you call friends may say it behind your back everyday
872089691318865921 2017-06-06 13:55:59 UTC <EddieHudson> @FrankLuntz Oh, the irony... It is thick.
871883276130103299 2017-06-05 00:15:46 UTC <EddieHudson> @TalibKweli Well maybe he can come to my area around Detroit and put that assertion to the test.
871830599841046530 2017-06-05 20:46:27 UTC <EddieHudson> @Gavin_McInnes @ebony71 @TalibKweli @SaintsMan4life I know being called to face your collective bullshit may feel like hate, but trust me, it isn't.
871752998678089729 2017-06-05 15:38:05 UTC <EddieHudson> @DailyCaller @realJeffreyLord Oh, I'm sure that will be at the forefront for the Senate. Give me a break. You should be observed in a clinical setting for awhile.
871736032118677505 2017-06-05 14:30:40 UTC <EddieHudson> @espn Got it. The black prez is gone now. Back to normal programming...
871467677281390592 2017-06-04 20:44:20 UTC <EddieHudson> @RodneyMarsh10 Doesn't seem like an honest question, does it? You appear xenophobic and I hope you're better than that.
871203455947476992 2017-06-03 03:14:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @TomiLahren Your fake outrage is cute.
871138907395698688 2017-06-03 22:57:55 UTC <EddieHudson> @mtracey You should be regretting this. Right. About. Now.
871137378500575232 2017-06-03 22:51:50 UTC <EddieHudson> @kingsthings Larry fight for social justice as hard as you defend @billmaher. That's all anyone asks. Otherwise nobody cares.
871136376988815364 2017-06-03 22:47:51 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke You've abused black people as well. No excuses for Maher but none for you either.

870493355628650499 2017-06-01 04:12:43 UTC <EddieHudson> @WhitlockJason @SFY Ok I'll bite. I can't believe you're paid for that ham-handed bullshit. The technical term for what you do? It's Called "making up shit".
870414556794847232 2017-06-01 22:59:36 UTC <EddieHudson> @SteveDeaceShow You're right. That was easy...
870414339898998784 2017-06-01 22:58:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @Arightside You have zero credibility on Twitter bro! Get off your knees for those folks. I know you're better than this.
870092906945802240 2017-05-31 01:41:29 UTC <EddieHudson> @Charles131527 @TalibKweli @Roaming_Zealot Well that's your prerogative I guess. Distance affords you that luxury.
870088308973613056 2017-05-31 01:23:12 UTC <EddieHudson> @Charles131527 @TalibKweli @Roaming_Zealot You've lost the plot. Point is you aren't in position to judge whether he's oppressed bc you lack context. Never will. Very offensive too.
870006569186013184 2017-05-31 19:58:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @Charles131527 @Roaming_Zealot I'd venture to say you don't know @TalibKweli or that you have a valid perspective on the lives of black people. Keyword being valid.
870004887286816768 2017-05-31 19:51:43 UTC <EddieHudson> @TomiLahren But of course! There must be a difference in order to justify this asinine tweet for why any of this matters.
870001829865598981 2017-05-31 19:39:34 UTC <EddieHudson> @eclecticbrotha If Barron lived in the WH he'd know it wasn't true. Instead he persists in costing us additional money protecting him in NYC.
869999635380801536 2017-05-31 19:30:51 UTC <EddieHudson> @Charles131527 @TalibKweli @Roaming_Zealot Simply not accurate.
869982137859981312 2017-05-31 18:21:19 UTC <EddieHudson> @Vincent_Ellis56 If you have to say "to be fair" before your statement, you're probably not going to be fair about anything you're about to say.
869977425807015936 2017-05-31 18:02:36 UTC <EddieHudson> @CNNPR Good. Now address the @realJeffreyLord situation and you'll be making some real progress over there.
869954593282813952 2017-05-31 16:31:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @mura_masa_ @LifeOfDesiigner @thefader Nah.

869728388214398982 2017-05-30 01:33:01 UTC <EddieHudson> @Charles131527 @TalibKweli Eternal question... Why do white people insist on trying to tell black folks what their reality is or isn't?
869578840464642049 2017-05-30 15:38:46 UTC <EddieHudson> @DonCheadle It's what you tell yourself to make it all better. I've seen & heard it a million times....
868802273065000964 2017-05-28 12:12:58 UTC <EddieHudson> @KattyKayBBC @FrankLuntz Maybe for the same reasons moderates in Portland don't do much about white supremacist and terrorist amongst them.
868280230158499840 2017-05-26 01:38:33 UTC <EddieHudson> @Bitchpuddingpie In real life she'd get the taste slapped out of her mouth. She knows that already. They all know it.
868279303091474432 2017-05-26 01:34:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @Bitchpuddingpie Twitter makes these idiots braver than they are in real life. She thinks this is provocative. It isn't. It's just imbecilic.

867808467708502018 2017-05-25 18:23:56 UTC <EddieHudson> @CurtisScoon @Hendu0520 Honest question. Should somebody that inarticulate hold a Cabinet position then? I don't think so and he's even from my hometown.
867750731503284224 2017-05-25 14:34:31 UTC <EddieHudson> @oldmanebro Church!
867731913926160384 2017-05-25 13:19:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @rolandsmartin Um... Never. Black Republicans may whisper it in close company, but they won't speak truth to power. That's why they'll always be outliers.
867731056786644992 2017-05-25 13:16:20 UTC <EddieHudson> @davidfrum Sir, I'm glad you realized this with no prompting. Kudos to you.

867403652616642565 2017-05-24 15:35:21 UTC <EddieHudson> @Joan_Vennochi Why must they choose? Because you say so? That's the problem here.
867403311682641921 2017-05-24 15:33:59 UTC <EddieHudson> @Joan_Vennochi Short answer: YES! Conflating the issues. Nothing to do w/ academics. It's about you agreeing w/ suppressing black girls' self expression.
867360835496288256 2017-05-24 12:45:12 UTC <EddieHudson> @ChrisCuomo Ongoing delusion in U.S.:  Nobody but me works for what I have and everyone else loves a free meal. Still sounds dumb every time I hear it.

866482644850274304 2017-05-21 02:35:35 UTC <EddieHudson> @Bitchpuddingpie @stillcham Does this chick even have a job? Seriously? Does talking shit on Twitter even count?

866478784391892993 2017-05-21 02:20:15 UTC <EddieHudson> @ron_fournier Take into account ND mission of social justice b4 making patronizing statements about young men and women.  You're better than this.

865237254297579520 2017-05-18 16:06:51 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord With everything else going on, right? C'mon Jeff, this is your focus? It's always about the leaks when you're on the wrong side of things.
865235552643276800 2017-05-18 16:00:05 UTC <EddieHudson> @NBCNews @realJeffreyLord I don't know if you heard. A few things have happened since January 24, 2017. You should stop being such a shill. It's painfully obvious.
865234362593411072 2017-05-18 15:55:21 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord Of course. It's really all about the leaks, not the potential crimes and selling out the country. The leaks....

862717618716909570 2017-05-11 17:14:43 UTC <EddieHudson> @rolandsmartin The NFL shouldn't ban anyone for weed. Football is violent and changes your life permanently. NFL should ban most painkillers instead.

859594703079190529 2017-05-02 02:25:22 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones Many white guys never come to grips with their own mediocrity so everyone else is surely just lucky...

858830790137982981 2017-04-30 23:49:51 UTC <EddieHudson> @PatrickRuffini So?
858413280674680832 2017-04-29 20:10:49 UTC <EddieHudson> @SteveDeaceShow First time in a long time where this Lions draft makes sense to me. Should I be scared? 
858411055759884289 2017-04-29 20:01:58 UTC <EddieHudson> @LLamorandier Sometimes pass rush comes from better play behind them. Let's hope that's the thought here.
858377376996229122 2017-04-29 17:48:09 UTC <EddieHudson> @SteveDeaceShow I would have taken Butt. You don't really need him this year. Give him a year to get his feet wet.
858376690703237120 2017-04-29 17:45:25 UTC <EddieHudson> @JoyAnnReid @MSNBC @JKH2 He once thought Trump was a clown but fell in line when he got the nomination. No principles at all. I can't stand this guy.

857732663901396992 2017-04-27 23:06:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @Russian_Starr See how the standard changes when the subject is a black man? Interesting...
857622653099806720 2017-04-27 15:49:09 UTC <EddieHudson> @POTUS44 @JillAbramson @rolandsmartin Because the standard always changes when we are talking about a black man. This is not a coincidence.

857413998291144704 2017-04-26 02:00:01 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord Right "The Left" any "Left" will do for this flimsy-ass argument. King of false equivalency. U don't divide by race as long as they agree.

856696550688468992 2017-04-24 02:29:08 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord An admission that your fearless leader is a liar. Jeff, you just told on yourself.

856506820810158080 2017-04-24 13:55:13 UTC <EddieHudson> @gol_mia @TalibKweli Why do so many white people want to tell black people what's racist and what isn't? Perhaps to continue systemic racism?

853610124061151232 2017-04-16 14:04:47 UTC <EddieHudson> @angela_rye Amazing how many folks use the term racist and don't really know what it means. White folks especially...
853376891377655810 2017-04-15 22:38:00 UTC <EddieHudson> @eclecticbrotha "Made in Russia"
852875783647502336 2017-04-14 13:26:47 UTC <EddieHudson> @jfreewright Cocaine is a helluva drug...
852731572788748288 2017-04-13 03:53:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @CharlesPointer2 And he still can't get a gig with Trump...
852656148864000001 2017-04-13 22:54:02 UTC <EddieHudson> @CNN Why do you allow the continuance of this nonsense? It's your credibility....
852644625571614721 2017-04-13 22:08:14 UTC <EddieHudson> @GOP @jfreewright Plain and Simple. Well said.
852594843993899009 2017-04-13 18:50:25 UTC <EddieHudson> @USATODAY You folks have no clue. To conflate these issues makes you either ignorant or insulting to both parties. Tasteless.
852544993919201283 2017-04-13 15:32:20 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord Please stop digging...
852543947419373572 2017-04-13 15:28:11 UTC <EddieHudson> @ZackFord @GinsburgJobs Somebody fire that man please!
852316809063788545 2017-04-12 00:25:37 UTC <EddieHudson> @BradMossEsq Another example of party before country. It's too bad citizens have such short memories.
852315998460014596 2017-04-12 00:22:23 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones @TheDotP I feel you but definition talks about superiority. On twitter calling white people on bs=racist.
852270159519789056 2017-04-12 21:20:15 UTC <EddieHudson> @Evan_McMullin @TheLeadCNN So it was probably Paul Manafort, right?
852232067517698054 2017-04-12 18:48:53 UTC <EddieHudson> @C_Stillitano plz bring a good match back to U of Michigan. Luv the show too.
852227417959792640 2017-04-12 18:30:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones Do white people even know what racism is? Serious question. So many people on Twitter need a dictionary....
852181936760131585 2017-04-12 15:29:41 UTC <EddieHudson> Indeed.https://twitter.com/Lawrence/status/851869012246093824
851988834518790144 2017-04-11 02:42:21 UTC <EddieHudson> @MDTeresa @realJeffreyLord Not imagining anything. You're insinuating there was some provocation before the cameras rolled. It's obvious to everyone but you.
851985636533948417 2017-04-11 02:29:39 UTC <EddieHudson> @MDTeresa @realJeffreyLord Your question isn't innocent. That's the problem. You're alluding that he did something wrong prior to filming. Jerk move.
851806834662965248 2017-04-11 14:39:09 UTC <EddieHudson> @courierjournal Now YOU have a troubled past on Twitter. You call yourselves professionals?
851624915497361408 2017-04-10 02:36:16 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke How many people died in your jail, again? You're right about those fish, Comrade.
850442314585473024 2017-04-07 20:17:02 UTC <EddieHudson> @SenateGOP @Arightside You don't really believe that, do you? He'll surely defend Citizens United. Not a good look Armstrong Williams!
849397239738970116 2017-04-04 23:04:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @JoyAnnReid Wow...
849079198153150465 2017-04-03 02:00:30 UTC <EddieHudson> @Arightside Guessing you didn't say this when Garland was up for nomination...
849008456849915908 2017-04-03 21:19:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @Cernovich @realJeffreyLord Wrong again. You can't establish her intent either. You conflate every issue and bathe in innuendo. It's so ridiculous it's funny to me.
849003533701713923 2017-04-03 20:59:50 UTC <EddieHudson> @Cernovich @realJeffreyLord It's probably legal and you know this Jeff. Folks, Jeff assumes you're all dumb. I follow him for the comedy.
848947044836405248 2017-04-03 17:15:22 UTC <EddieHudson> @BradMossEsq R.I.P Reading Comprehension  -2017
848930004721336322 2017-04-03 16:07:40 UTC <EddieHudson> @TalibKweli "U can't be a millionaire victim of oppression" Seriously one of the dumbest fucking quotes I've seen anywhere. Wow.
848886586599239680 2017-04-03 13:15:08 UTC <EddieHudson> @TheUndefeated Sorry, none unfortunately. It's kinda sad.
848357614392156161 2017-04-01 02:13:11 UTC <EddieHudson> @DrJasonJohnson @NicaraguanAcct Love when people cite MLK when they disagree with you. He's the only other black guy you heard of?
848340552793903105 2017-04-01 01:05:23 UTC <EddieHudson> @justinamash @realDonaldTrump @DanScavino Stop lying to people. What you're are doing is called "Making up shit". That's the clinical term too.
848303729925398528 2017-04-01 22:39:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @AriMelber Is it not a fruit?
847911575931547649 2017-03-31 20:40:47 UTC <EddieHudson> @balleralert yuck.
847585033833598977 2017-03-30 23:03:14 UTC <EddieHudson> @angela_rye @edmondsburnaby What you are doing is called "Making shit up". That's the clinical term for it too.
847584547223072769 2017-03-30 23:01:18 UTC <EddieHudson> @angela_rye He came to know quickly the Doc wasn't having it. Changed his tune and looked for help...
847461833866829831 2017-03-30 14:53:40 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke you are so self-hating. It's fun to watch actually. Go get 'em cowboy!
847451922793508864 2017-03-30 14:14:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @crooksandliars bc he is an incompetent GOP watery with no grasp of reality. He's all those things.
847106578377531392 2017-03-29 15:22:01 UTC <EddieHudson> @oreillyfactor @SheriffClarke you're both juvenile. Grow up and lead. Be productive citizens. You're embarrassing yourselves and the USA.
846755324996571142 2017-03-28 16:06:16 UTC <EddieHudson> @deray they know no one will verify it unless the interviewer catches it immediately.
846533849836388352 2017-03-27 01:26:12 UTC <EddieHudson> @seanhannity @SheriffClarke so what...
846397814221524992 2017-03-27 16:25:38 UTC <EddieHudson> @davisjsn seems a bit arbitrary. Who polices that anyway. Good product brings people out to see it.
846036270535069696 2017-03-26 16:29:00 UTC <EddieHudson> @newtgingrich so you were looking into the future to show how Obama was saving us money, right? Be careful, the internet has receipts!
845385563951824896 2017-03-24 21:23:19 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones as much white as black until we start judging QB's. Then he's black. Them's the rules too.
845318839416041472 2017-03-24 16:58:11 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke @stephenasmith hope you think twice about taking a pic with "Big Hat No Cattle" again... ouch
845306044406550528 2017-03-24 16:07:20 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord do you want to take this back now? You have a deliberate disregard of reality it appears.
845259543961632770 2017-03-24 13:02:34 UTC <EddieHudson> @RayHudson @SiriusXMFC Happy Birthday Ray! Next time in Detroit, have drinks with your cousin!
844993342463246336 2017-03-23 19:24:46 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord @CNN Jeff's repeated lies make you look bad. Find his replacement soon plz.
844992878158004224 2017-03-23 19:22:56 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord no, he didn't. You are such a shill Jeff. @CNN, Jeff doesn't grasp the issues. Jeff pack your desk plz.
844972693694885889 2017-03-23 18:02:43 UTC <EddieHudson> @stereowilliams it actually changed how I listen to music. I was 23.
844717755421118464 2017-03-22 01:09:41 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke if it happened in Milwaukee you'd never know what happened. You're never there...
844717081144758275 2017-03-22 01:07:00 UTC <EddieHudson> @jaketapper that's how felons joke around...
844594712489152512 2017-03-22 17:00:45 UTC <EddieHudson> @spiceadams where might one get that tshirt bro?
844554850176319489 2017-03-22 14:22:22 UTC <EddieHudson> @Arightside u can choose 2 ignore what's being reported if u like. Prudent to wait to see if foreign agents are currently in WH.
844288775287132163 2017-03-21 20:45:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump @jfreewright I mean that's obviously Obama's fault....
844281595087544322 2017-03-21 20:16:32 UTC <EddieHudson> @LawyerRogelio @TaoOfTofu that's who I thought it was. His firm made wads of money off the housing collapse her in Michigan.
844278530359934976 2017-03-21 20:04:22 UTC <EddieHudson> @LawyerRogelio who's the Congressman?
844277478961102848 2017-03-21 20:00:11 UTC <EddieHudson> @undisputed does anybody count Skip's money? I don't even care for Lebron but stay out of his pocket!
844200727111188481 2017-03-21 14:55:12 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones the walking embodiment of privilege. They don't even care where they are when they say it.
844195265410228224 2017-03-21 14:33:30 UTC <EddieHudson> @RodneyMarsh10 love your show. You know what's meant. Don't be obtuse! Still love your show though ;)
843924848523075584 2017-03-20 20:38:57 UTC <EddieHudson> @CNN @realJeffreyLord @cnn you need to make better choices. Jeff's a propaganda machine. Not credible at all.
843205065351544835 2017-03-18 20:58:48 UTC <EddieHudson> @NYT @realJeffreyLord Says NSA was watching not Obama admin. You're very intellectually dishonest. #GOPWATERBOY
843201965886767106 2017-03-18 20:46:29 UTC <EddieHudson> @NYT @realJeffreyLord that's from March 1 and says nothing about Obama specifically. Very disingenuous.
843159283068030977 2017-03-18 17:56:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @EWErickson Jesus was a Jew. You must have forgotten that part, huh?
843158865143369729 2017-03-18 17:55:13 UTC <EddieHudson> @deray because of course Jesus was all about exclusion, right? He forgot Jesus was a Jew...
843157783386210306 2017-03-18 17:50:55 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord you're so fair and balanced...
842347436957933570 2017-03-16 12:10:53 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke that never happened. Get your butt to Milwaukee and do your job. Get off Twitter. Delete this account!
842028792860270592 2017-03-15 15:04:43 UTC <EddieHudson> This what he's thinking about in the moment.https://twitter.com/TalibKweli/status/842026295693332480
841752675511328768 2017-03-14 20:47:31 UTC <EddieHudson> @RepMiaLove I hope you have the courage to address Steve King's ugly statements sometime soon.
841714838183264256 2017-03-14 18:17:10 UTC <EddieHudson> @CNNPolitics @Toure So we'll fight, then procreate, then fight again to overtake whites? I don't get it. He's an idiot nevertheless.
841713943815045121 2017-03-14 18:13:37 UTC <EddieHudson> @wesfelton @CNNPolitics Somebody should tell Iowa that they can do better. They need to break up with him...
841472732864925696 2017-03-13 02:15:07 UTC <EddieHudson> @WJUCardinals @reas_WV @WJU_Basketball Let's go Cards!
841468780492513280 2017-03-13 01:59:25 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke @rolandsmartin he won't say a damn thing. He just a useful idiot.
841407278272122880 2017-03-13 21:55:02 UTC <EddieHudson> @deray bc she's perpetually full of shit...
841333144901038080 2017-03-13 17:00:27 UTC <EddieHudson> Come on Iowa... You can do better. Get this guy outta there.https://twitter.com/studentactivism/status/841133810288869377
841105852736106496 2017-03-12 01:57:16 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones sorry those are all equally good...
840732962043879424 2017-03-11 01:15:32 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke @KimosabeBonet you sound nice. Have a great one.
840432380280205312 2017-03-10 05:21:08 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord is your job 2 find what u believe is equivalent from the other party? It's really ridiculous and tortured most times.
840196219150467073 2017-03-10 13:42:43 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke prove that accusation. You've whored yourself for the President and anybody who'd put money in your pocket, Comrade.
840020529859948545 2017-03-09 02:04:35 UTC <EddieHudson> @TalibKweli talking like he'll fight a war.... hilarious...
840019643414765568 2017-03-09 02:01:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke you should be in Milwaukee, right?
839596262643154947 2017-03-08 21:58:42 UTC <EddieHudson> @tvonetv @CNN CNN needs to stop giving blatant liars from the Trump camp a platform too. Much respect @rolandsmartin.
839594252539674625 2017-03-08 21:50:43 UTC <EddieHudson> @AriMelber I knew I liked you for some reason....
839574226419974144 2017-03-08 20:31:08 UTC <EddieHudson> @drummaboiblue1 Man, this album is ridiculously good. Congrats.
839540741194072069 2017-03-08 18:18:05 UTC <EddieHudson> @Arightside so he repeated an asinine statement? Are you sure this is the point you want to make?
839471869178818560 2017-03-08 13:44:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke no, probably not. Are you in Milwaukee working? No, probably not?
839144129623953409 2017-03-07 16:02:05 UTC <EddieHudson> @pattonoswalt and his healthcare is taxpayer subsidized. He should have been punched in the face immediately after saying that.
839143175419793408 2017-03-07 15:58:18 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones I'm assuming he's referring to backups.....
839134531185692672 2017-03-07 15:23:57 UTC <EddieHudson> @Arightside enjoy your work, but who's fooled by Putin other than Trump and his crew?
839107553946648578 2017-03-07 13:36:45 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord amazingly stupid thing to say. Wow.
838869007302287361 2017-03-06 21:48:51 UTC <EddieHudson> Please stop @RealBenCarson from coming back to Detroit and speaking to any group after his "slaves were immigrants" bit. Wow!
838814900927496192 2017-03-06 18:13:51 UTC <EddieHudson> @thehill "Overwhelming" is such a relative terms. He appears easily "overwhelmed".
838808144243527681 2017-03-06 17:47:00 UTC <EddieHudson> @StewGivens Hi. ID camp still on for March 11?
838583141593939968 2017-03-05 02:52:55 UTC <EddieHudson> @MLS @AlexiLalas @halwerner in fact it does give u the freedom to do what you want! U r just not free from consequences. It's y we r great!

838236198191697921 2017-03-04 03:54:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke my man, please delete this account. You are foolish and self-hating. You need professional help.
838079566342197249 2017-03-04 17:31:54 UTC <EddieHudson> @DailyCaller @SheriffClarke you maybe the worst self-hating black man to ever be on here. Congrats, I guess...
837691163947765760 2017-03-03 15:48:31 UTC <EddieHudson> @HajjFlemings Great minds think alike....
837679379962560513 2017-03-03 15:01:42 UTC <EddieHudson> @HajjFlemings Commonwealth?
837672957862428672 2017-03-03 14:36:11 UTC <EddieHudson> Hilarious...https://twitter.com/70Ceeks/status/837391540674756608
837666237865951232 2017-03-03 14:09:28 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke you may have a few cheerleaders on this platform, but no one is really taking you seriously. Just so you know....
837497369776304132 2017-03-02 02:58:27 UTC <EddieHudson> @YouTube @rolandsmartin I don't think so. No mention of funding, right?
837447905082486785 2017-03-02 23:41:54 UTC <EddieHudson> @YouTube @rolandsmartin yup...
837447699813261312 2017-03-02 23:41:05 UTC <EddieHudson> @GOPBlackChick @CharlesPointer2 he's frighteningly ignorant and self-hating.
837446312836612097 2017-03-02 23:35:34 UTC <EddieHudson> @thefix he even acknowledged he was considered a surrogate! He misunderstood nothing. He didn't realize the consequences. He's now unfit.
837301235736788992 2017-03-02 13:59:05 UTC <EddieHudson> @jfreewright you probably have to comment more since there's so many pleas to stop.....
837299638411591680 2017-03-02 13:52:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones that's just a few bags of groceries from there. That's been my experience, anyway.
837299078912487426 2017-03-02 13:50:31 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke okay Comrade!
836975227880017920 2017-03-01 16:23:39 UTC <EddieHudson> @oldmanebro yup....
836789737532837888 2017-02-28 04:06:34 UTC <EddieHudson> @thefix doesn't make it a great speech however. Don't try to normalize this monstrosity plz.
836778127078666241 2017-02-28 03:20:26 UTC <EddieHudson> @KeithOlbermann Hugh is a delusional man. He can't be taken seriously anymore.
836777093757292544 2017-02-28 03:16:20 UTC <EddieHudson> @StanCollymore frightening right?
836772916662571008 2017-02-28 02:59:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @NolanFinleyDN of course Congress will not go along.
836570248035905536 2017-02-28 13:34:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @deray someone should have demanded she stand up and acknowledge the event. Somebody there should speak up or lose all credibility.
836569369090064388 2017-02-28 13:30:54 UTC <EddieHudson> @ROLANDMARTIN @SheriffClarke if you can't bring your message to black folks, how can you be credible? @rolandmartin would be a good place to start.
836038333948170240 2017-02-26 02:20:46 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord See... you dare not even utter his name lest you be shunned Jeff. You are being deliberately obtuse. Not a good look...
836014684717318145 2017-02-26 00:46:47 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord maybe a discussion for you and the President perhaps? My guess is you'd be banished in a hurry. I hope u see the irony.
836012127924146176 2017-02-26 00:36:38 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord with all due respect that's nonsensical. I'm not a liberal either. Too many want 2 b free from consequences of free speech.
836004581528244224 2017-02-26 00:06:39 UTC <EddieHudson> @realJeffreyLord the definition is in fact the opposite of liberalism. Jeff, do better.
835622188082421760 2017-02-25 22:47:09 UTC <EddieHudson> @carlyhoilman love your columns but that take is pure nonsense.
835615261646589952 2017-02-25 22:19:38 UTC <EddieHudson> @washingtonpost @realJeffreyLord maybe they can book trips to China and buy direct? What say you Comrade Jeff?
835613748584939524 2017-02-25 22:13:37 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke you better be dusting off that resume soon. You won't be winning again in Milwaukee.
835532611124617216 2017-02-25 16:51:12 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones argument can be made that Shaq is pound 4 pound best athlete ever. Always a different level...
835531326363160577 2017-02-25 16:46:06 UTC <EddieHudson> @CMLIFE @DSoccerCentral I've been to a few games. Supporters seem more interested in chants than product on field. I'll take MLS plz.
835117491747762176 2017-02-24 13:21:40 UTC <EddieHudson> @realDonaldTrump @SheriffClarke You'll be doing the country a favor when you leave office and get back to Mother Russia.
834771764450299904 2017-02-23 14:27:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones I've been known to have the #lowwhitevoice too. He could have kept this email however. Not humorous in the least...
834531711828500480 2017-02-22 22:33:59 UTC <EddieHudson> @bomani_jones I've never really heard you use much slang.
834101231874408451 2017-02-21 18:03:25 UTC <EddieHudson> @SiriusXMFC MLS definitely needs a villain club or two...
834074944740921347 2017-02-21 16:18:57 UTC <EddieHudson> @thefix the speech is free. It's the consequences that are not...
834067251372425222 2017-02-21 15:48:23 UTC <EddieHudson> @madmcferrin @JoyAnnReid the largest blind spot in American history. How can so many people not see these things?
833841573041434624 2017-02-20 00:51:37 UTC <EddieHudson> @StanCollymore is he serious?? Pot meet kettle... Wow.
833840308643299328 2017-02-20 00:46:36 UTC <EddieHudson> @jfreewright why do people do this? You can only be in the box he's made for you? It's truly the dumbest shit I see over and over again...
833798965325856768 2017-02-20 22:02:19 UTC <EddieHudson> @SykesCharlie I honestly believe its only because he was talking about white kids. I hate that I believe that but I do.
833752920273383426 2017-02-20 18:59:21 UTC <EddieHudson> @glennbeck He'll show up anyway....
833715133574742017 2017-02-20 16:29:12 UTC <EddieHudson> @oldmanebro he immigrated from Greece to England then U.S., but against immigration? Only those who don't look like him...

833153535172833280 2017-02-18 03:17:36 UTC <EddieHudson> @PamelaBrownCNN @CNN @realJeffreyLord to bore us to tears with your tortured logic?
833061828066471936 2017-02-18 21:13:12 UTC <EddieHudson> @CR @realJeffreyLord while you're on CNN? You're almost laughable. Almost.
832959129228558337 2017-02-18 14:25:06 UTC <EddieHudson> @jfreewright he should be studied in a clinical setting.
832690518538674176 2017-02-17 20:37:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @CharlesPointer2 a white guy told him what she said and he ran with it! I feel bad for Milwaukee.
832589607204175872 2017-02-17 13:56:45 UTC <EddieHudson> @rolandsmartin @CharlesPointer2 Order those books for a large bonfire perhaps?
832372523757137920 2017-02-16 23:34:09 UTC <EddieHudson> @detroitnews @NolanFinleyDN many view u as aloof and disconnected. You should be aware of that.
831972793000550408 2017-02-15 21:05:45 UTC <EddieHudson> @detroitpolice @detroitnews probably a bad guy but do those facts mean the shooting was warranted in this instance?
831868181862088704 2017-02-15 14:10:04 UTC <EddieHudson> @TIME @SheriffClarke Should we call you "Black Sheriff Clarke" too? Are you even in Milwaukee right now? Do YOUR job!
831690809460322304 2017-02-14 02:25:15 UTC <EddieHudson> @WhitlockJason @TheHerd please Jason Whitlock. He's an awful person. Beyond moronic.

830140612926115842 2017-02-10 19:45:20 UTC <EddieHudson> @rolandsmartin @CharlesPointer2 did @SheriffClarke forget Devos is part of that donor class? When was he in Milwaukee last anyway?
829907055880335360 2017-02-09 04:17:15 UTC <EddieHudson> @WSJ @SheriffClarke Sheriff you're seriously ill. Get professional help.
829794854695755777 2017-02-09 20:51:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @oldmanebro he called it a "permanent" trend. How can that be?
829777818368217088 2017-02-09 19:43:43 UTC <EddieHudson> @arielhelwani obvious that security put their hands on him 1st. I don't blame him at all. They waited 4 him to retaliate 2 to arrest him.
829368604982390784 2017-02-08 16:37:39 UTC <EddieHudson> @BetsyDeVos @Locs_n_Laughs she should seek guidance there everyday going forward.....

828067872920453124 2017-02-04 02:29:00 UTC <EddieHudson> @CharlesPointer2 Not even mediocre! Bottom of the barrel for @SheriffClarke. Raw brutal ignorance from that guy. He should resign.
827536565140410369 2017-02-03 15:17:46 UTC <EddieHudson> @KellyannePolls @KeithOlbermann no merit to your argument. U need critical facts for argument like the event happening. Try stand up again.

826644119351078912 2017-01-31 04:11:31 UTC <EddieHudson> @CharlesPointer2 he'd rather go bully women at a march.
826448882175447040 2017-01-31 15:15:42 UTC <EddieHudson> @JustinTinsley read your article on Harrington. Check in with Carlos Rogers in Detroit. Really good brother.
824748492425924608 2017-01-26 22:38:58 UTC <EddieHudson> @foxandfriends @SheriffClarke @KimosabeBonet Well you would wrong about me being a Dem and I don't talk to anyone w/out a pic. Beat it.
824693270051770368 2017-01-26 18:59:32 UTC <EddieHudson> @foxandfriends @SheriffClarke You're so courageous for pointing this out. Did you get your pat on the head from your masters?
823958082044694528 2017-01-24 18:18:09 UTC <EddieHudson> @futbol4life Great town. Heidi went to Penn. I mooched of her until I went to law school ;)

823542028277600256 2017-01-23 14:44:54 UTC <EddieHudson> @HuffingtonPost @washingtonpost @nytimes @MSNBC @CNN @SheriffClarke Sheriff you hate being black. It's obvious. Milwaukee hates you too.
823520432087298048 2017-01-23 13:19:05 UTC <EddieHudson> @glennbeck @VanJones68 who did you think he was exactly? I don't understand.
823131041321910272 2017-01-22 11:31:47 UTC <EddieHudson> @MSNBC @CNN @SheriffClarke Sheriff, so Trump gave you the job of overseeing the false narratives? Congrats!
823028888737644544 2017-01-21 04:45:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @CharlesPointer2 @SheriffClarke  Easy 2 B tough at a Women's rally. So despite your urging them 2 B violent, they remained nonviolent? 
823026063458570242 2017-01-21 04:34:39 UTC <EddieHudson> @CharlesPointer2 @SheriffClarke the Sheriff is unstable. Milwaukee's women should be worried.
823006469033496576 2017-01-21 03:16:47 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke better go get your pitchforks!
823001814429732864 2017-01-21 02:58:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke you're amazingly tough! Good for you being so tough at a Women's rally!
822915008447254528 2017-01-21 21:13:21 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke sure call it insurrection so you have excuse to shoot or hurt people. You're a thug sir.

822521573298929664 2017-01-20 19:09:59 UTC <EddieHudson> @StanCollymore I guess if you never played football, you couldn't have an opinion on it either??
822511190072967172 2017-01-20 18:28:43 UTC <EddieHudson> @JoyAnnReid How do we know it was accidental?
822238042375290880 2017-01-19 00:23:20 UTC <EddieHudson> @CNN @SheriffClarke delete your account and work for the people of Milwaukee plz.
821774834166333443 2017-01-18 17:42:42 UTC <EddieHudson> @ShaunKing I can't even count the number of times my eyes rolled after listening to something Jim Brown has said. Very sad.
821429823805521920 2017-01-17 18:51:46 UTC <EddieHudson> @marclamonthill @SheriffClarke @rolandsmartin @CharlesPointer2 Does he ever work? Milwaukee should be mad as hell he's stealing their money.
821429459916099584 2017-01-17 18:50:19 UTC <EddieHudson> @marclamonthill @SheriffClarke @rolandsmartin the Sheriff needs to be studied in a clinical setting. Why does he hate black men so much?
821428035836583937 2017-01-17 18:44:39 UTC <EddieHudson> @freep @realDonaldTrump U do realize that when u retweet this maniac he trys to take credit for these things, right? Please stop!
821408884925546497 2017-01-17 17:28:33 UTC <EddieHudson> Yup. Very Weird.https://twitter.com/ericgarland/status/821362005219086336
821404146419036160 2017-01-17 17:09:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @detroitnews @newtgingrich Now we know it only costs 9.5 mil to Trump camp to dismantle public education. Glad we monetized that Newt. Thnx.
821394457123815425 2017-01-17 16:31:14 UTC <EddieHudson> @marclamonthill I luv when they compare Lincoln's Rep. Party 2 now as if it's the same. @SheriffClarke hates being black.
820402873905377280 2017-01-14 22:51:02 UTC <EddieHudson> @DailyCaller @seanhannity @CNNnewsroom @HuffingtonPost @SheriffClarke bc you're a self hating black man.
820045579984240640 2017-01-13 23:11:16 UTC <EddieHudson> @TerryFoster971 nope.
819314430219583488 2017-01-11 22:45:56 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke why do you hate black folks? You hate yourself deep down too... it's obvious.
819314088551522304 2017-01-11 22:44:35 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke completely ridiculous. Who writes this stuff for you?
819313452149784577 2017-01-11 22:42:03 UTC <EddieHudson> @CharlesPointer2 @SheriffClarke Sheriff, do you ever work? Who's killing prisoners in your jail?
818867349029785604 2017-01-10 17:09:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @deray @samswey Oh gosh! What would old @SheriffClarke say about this?
818855860474703872 2017-01-10 16:23:45 UTC <EddieHudson> @ShaunKing Hi! What constitutes "Senior" level positions? Just curious of the definition.
818811581203173376 2017-01-10 13:27:48 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke moronic. Really?
817473626794496001 2017-01-06 20:51:15 UTC <EddieHudson> @TalibKweli @leahcimekim Nope, butTwitter brings out the inner prick, huh? You're a scared little man. Move on b4 I hurt your feelings Mike.
817470558401077248 2017-01-06 20:39:03 UTC <EddieHudson> @TalibKweli @leahcimekim I'm a big man. I'm easy to find. You just keep carrying that water for your bosses, Mike. I'll be over here...
817468192331337729 2017-01-06 20:29:39 UTC <EddieHudson> @TalibKweli @leahcimekim I don't identify as Dem. I'm for truth no matter who tells it. You obviously have a different view, water boy.
817453454222393344 2017-01-06 19:31:05 UTC <EddieHudson> @leahcimekim @TalibKweli 
817450527155961856 2017-01-06 19:19:27 UTC <EddieHudson> @TalibKweli @leahcimekim Simply untrue no matter how many times U say it. BLM didn't do that. What you're doing is called "projection".
817446488246800385 2017-01-06 19:03:24 UTC <EddieHudson> @leahcimekim @TalibKweli you aren't a serious person. BLM hasn't killed anyone. Twitter is the home of false equivalency.
817079734546890752 2017-01-05 18:46:03 UTC <EddieHudson> @DonCheadle Twitter is the home and bastion of the false equivalency. The best in the bigot toolbox.
817063502078681088 2017-01-05 17:41:33 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke You can't even get law and order in your own jail! Please resign and delete your account.
817042019327639554 2017-01-05 16:16:11 UTC <EddieHudson> @FirstWorkMedia @TalibKweli Praying for violence because of a different viewpoint is not very good look... Sad, really.

816316552383524869 2017-01-03 16:13:27 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke It appears, you have a race obsession in the other direction. Why no explanation for the dead prisoners yet?
816145186266972161 2017-01-02 04:52:30 UTC <EddieHudson> @jfreewright anyone who says "libtards" deserves everything they get. Wow...

813868851318452225 2016-12-27 22:07:09 UTC <EddieHudson> @left_of_bang "fake news" has simply become the news you don't agree with. We can just end this conversation right here.
813842798537490432 2016-12-27 20:23:38 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke @jstines3 @left_of_bang Larry that's just a dumb thing to say. Not well thought out...
813794312542621697 2016-12-27 17:10:58 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke @jstines3 @ThomasDurrant7 140 characters isn't enough space for that discourse. It's tragic though.
813794035655733249 2016-12-27 17:09:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke @jstines3 @ThomasDurrant7 wow... okay. Good talk.
813788355116892160 2016-12-27 16:47:17 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke @jstines3 @ThomasDurrant7 Again, you've lost the plot here. No perspective from the one's shot and killed.
813787944133754885 2016-12-27 16:45:39 UTC <EddieHudson> @ThomasDurrant7 You've lost the plot Thomas...
813785467510460416 2016-12-27 16:35:49 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke @jstines3 I appreciate good cops, do you have any clever sayings for when police shoot unarmed black people though?
813768115670679552 2016-12-27 15:26:52 UTC <EddieHudson> @jetfury Indeed you are...
813767144487981056 2016-12-27 15:23:00 UTC <EddieHudson> @BrentNYT It's real. That's been a huge issue in Detroit.

812277474524626944 2016-12-23 12:43:35 UTC <EddieHudson> @SheriffClarke why are people dying needlessly in your jail? Where's your accountability, sir?

772860172033196032 2016-09-05 18:13:18 UTC <EddieHudson> @AlexiLalas Chet Lemon and Lou Whitaker never stood for the anthem. I'd personally be ok too.

772858768434556929 2016-09-05 18:07:44 UTC <EddieHudson> @AlexiLalas @piersmorgan Read all the verses of the national anthem before your conclusion. Maybe it has outlived its relevance.
772857026196168704 2016-09-05 18:00:48 UTC <EddieHudson> @AlexiLalas @piersmorgan Black protest forces America to confront its past and present and live up to an ideal written on paper.

769372091762245632 2016-08-26 03:12:55 UTC <EddieHudson> @katiepack telling that old tired story about white flight in Detroit. It's a lie now and then. Despicable.
769164031177461760 2016-08-26 13:26:10 UTC <EddieHudson> @stopbeingfamous but white media love to parade these guys as prizes and 'edgy" new talent. Yuck.
