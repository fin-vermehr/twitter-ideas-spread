709191702041403392 2016-03-13 01:37:32 UTC <Ellamusings1> @tedcruz I believe in you.  But stop answering every policy question by explaining how Trump is wrong.  Just tell us what YOU  will do.
705497256213008384 2016-03-03 20:57:08 UTC <Ellamusings1> @FoxNews PLEASE don't ask them to comment on another candidate's actions or statements. Just ask what THEIR position/policy is.

702577569942642688 2016-02-24 19:35:20 UTC <Ellamusings1> Washington Cartel / Establishment better realize that the AMERICAN  PEOPLE are  voting for Mr. Trump / Sen Cruz. We don't want the old guard
692545689243500550 2016-01-27 03:12:13 UTC <Ellamusings1> I am still stunned and disgusted that Megan Kelly had Michael Moore on her show. I'm done with her
