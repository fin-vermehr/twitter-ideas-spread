971378693137297408 2018-03-07 13:35:02 UTC <tofureallysux> @AusFedPolice @CmdrAmericas Did you employ the bump method? Nice park.
971239416223227905 2018-03-06 04:21:36 UTC <tofureallysux> @Delta hi, were booked in premium economy on DL40 SYD-JFK 19 Sep. Are we getting the C+ seats or the new PS seats?
970926310129156096 2018-03-05 07:37:25 UTC <tofureallysux> @DLoesch @PoliticalShort What types of crimes? What are the figures? Is that all crimes down?
970686987723145217 2018-03-05 15:46:27 UTC <tofureallysux> @dbongino @NRATV @herb_hedgpeth @bobbernzott Fix the problem by stopping the supply of guns. Your first step will no longer be required. Thank me later.
970685926862028800 2018-03-05 15:42:14 UTC <tofureallysux> @DLoesch "These what? Use full sentences Dana. Remove these what? Police, dogs, carpet, street lights, hoardings? You sound like the kid that complains that everyone is against him. And then slings the verbal brown stuff at those you most hated.
970563802168086528 2018-03-04 07:36:57 UTC <tofureallysux> @dbongino @NRATV @herb_hedgpeth @vbmarquis Im in. Will need to spend lots more money on public transport though.
970562395234947072 2018-03-04 07:31:21 UTC <tofureallysux> @katefree138 Which night is the militia meeting?
970558841845817344 2018-03-04 07:17:14 UTC <tofureallysux> @iamjohnoliver @LastWeekTonight @NRATV @MrDirkMcQuickly Thats hilarious. Obviously the NRA didnt do their homework before rushing this promo to air.
970557292222464001 2018-03-04 07:11:05 UTC <tofureallysux> @dbongino @NRATV @jimmymalecki @TmWasted Not saying youre wrong but do you have a source for your statement.?
970552368176676864 2018-03-04 06:51:31 UTC <tofureallysux> @dbongino @NRATV @herb_hedgpeth @vbmarquis Look I think were getting to that point. If its the Wild West people want then thats what theyll get. Can you imagine the gun violence then. Hey, you looked at me funny... heres 2 rounds because I can. People do a lot of crazy stuff in the heat of the moment.
970551197710024705 2018-03-04 06:46:52 UTC <tofureallysux> @dbongino @NRATV @herb_hedgpeth @bobbernzott Not sure what point your trying to make.
970550176879226886 2018-03-04 06:42:48 UTC <tofureallysux> @NRA @ProudLiberal11 @therealtrooth @Glock_Coma_ I ask you about per capita Oz vs US for long arms used in intentional homicide outside the home.
970494555895181313 2018-03-04 03:01:47 UTC <tofureallysux> @dbongino @NRATV Theres only one tool in that video.
970493086374641664 2018-03-04 02:55:57 UTC <tofureallysux> @DLoesch @NRATV I gather they is the people aka me. You do the same as them. Yes?
970487875325149184 2018-03-04 02:35:14 UTC <tofureallysux> @NRATV Whats your pay packet Wayne? Whens the last time you dined with a member on the Hill? You sound like an elite to me. Maybe you can share a boat to some place else with the elites on the other coast. You dont speak for me.
970486712618008576 2018-03-04 02:30:37 UTC <tofureallysux> @NRATV The truth is you should have stuck to your profession: war fighter. Social debate is a little more nuanced than the them versus us messages youve been posting. Do us a favour and show us that professional leadership you learned and practiced as a SEAL. Bring us together.
970484684487516160 2018-03-04 02:22:34 UTC <tofureallysux> @DLoesch @NRATV As though I dont see enough of this lady on all forms of media already. And I dont even watch the NRATV channel.
970483040131596288 2018-03-04 02:16:02 UTC <tofureallysux> @DLoesch @NRATV Time for a bake-off.
970479016850239488 2018-03-04 02:00:02 UTC <tofureallysux> @dbongino @NRATV @JerryMasters1 I believe the Oscars are being held in March this year. Thank me later.
970478339847700481 2018-03-04 01:57:21 UTC <tofureallysux> @dbongino @NRATV @buymymonkey Nancy, so youre focused on them versus us and the BS politics. Surely we can agree that the right to life is the most important right? Would you be willing to give up your 2nd amendment right if abortion was banned? Just interested in your point of view.
970476581662605312 2018-03-04 01:50:22 UTC <tofureallysux> @dbongino @NRATV @EsradaReed Your tweet doesnt make sense. Why would liberals defend the 2nd? Thats the job of the right wing. The libs would want it read down.
970475825555324928 2018-03-04 01:47:22 UTC <tofureallysux> @dbongino @NRATV @zaclynch23 Exactly how did this bad guy, I think you mean nut job, get a gun in the first place. Oh wait, he has his 2nd amendments rights and hes not given up his  rights for no one no how! By the way, what nights the well regulated militia meeting this week?
970474278062714880 2018-03-04 01:41:13 UTC <tofureallysux> @dbongino @NRATV @herb_hedgpeth So you harden schools as potential targets. The bad guy switches to buses then to bus stations then to train stations then to malls then to medical centres etc etc.  Take these types of guns off the street and everyone can feel and be safer.
970473341353013248 2018-03-04 01:37:29 UTC <tofureallysux> @dbongino @NRATV @jimmymalecki @TmWasted And if you add the number by country your argument then supports gun control.
970471953759797248 2018-03-04 01:31:58 UTC <tofureallysux> @dbongino @NRATV Ive got this one. You pay you get. You no pay you no get. Simple. Rich people with security issues can afford to pay. Schools with security issues dont have the money to pay. In that case, the govt or the parents of the school pay.
970470101831921664 2018-03-04 01:24:37 UTC <tofureallysux> @JerryDunleavy Them are fighting words. Ill try all the states 
970468793045598208 2018-03-04 01:19:25 UTC <tofureallysux> @NRA @ProudLiberal11 @Glock_Coma_ @therealtrooth So is Australia. Your point?
970285631598481408 2018-03-04 13:11:36 UTC <tofureallysux> @RWitherspoon @0014Priya Knew someone had to say that. Where were you when [insert favourite cause here]. People get motivated by what they feel affects them. Black deaths in custody and police brutality absolute issues but not if they dont happen in my community.
970284501040447493 2018-03-04 13:07:06 UTC <tofureallysux> @RWitherspoon @Pipsy26 I have teens. The world is a way different place for them as compared to when I was their age. Disrespectful yup. Under way more pressure than past generations and without the necessary supports? Definitely.
970283222792773632 2018-03-04 13:02:01 UTC <tofureallysux> @RWitherspoon @kati_rankin @MartinKnightNut @monreal_joel So gun lovers can never become nut jobs?
970283031826018306 2018-03-04 13:01:16 UTC <tofureallysux> @RWitherspoon @kati_rankin So you can keep your musket, theres your arms.  2nd amendment doesnt guarantee you access to the latest military assault rifle...
970282518078414848 2018-03-04 12:59:13 UTC <tofureallysux> @RWitherspoon @Jimmy6725 Why rely on the response to a crazy? Why put the military assault rifle on the market in the first place?
970281307220590592 2018-03-04 12:54:25 UTC <tofureallysux> @RWitherspoon @kati_rankin And the kids that die? The right to life, the right to live in peace are inalienable human rights. Take a tour through the law and youll find that courts place inalienable rights above individual social rights.
969874214365798401 2018-03-03 09:56:46 UTC <tofureallysux> @DLoesch @bajaturbo Pastor which passage in the Bible supports the slaughter of school children? Youre not following the Jesus I know. You must be reading the alternative Bible sponsored by the NRA.
969868743659593728 2018-03-03 09:35:02 UTC <tofureallysux> @NRA @ProudLiberal11 @Glock_Coma_ Ahh, the per capita argument...  so, has the per capita rate in Australia for deaths using a long arm outside the home eg a concert, school or cinema gone down since the gun buy back?
969856257602461697 2018-03-03 08:45:25 UTC <tofureallysux> @NRA @theophimon2 Sure, okay. Independent evidence to back your claim?
969844731877322752 2018-03-02 07:59:37 UTC <tofureallysux> @DLoesch @NRATV @IanMMundell @castlebrew Heres how society works: the laws of society are basically about people giving up a bit of freedom by consenting to not do things that harm others and so the community. In return the individual is protected from these things by the community. The right to own guns harms others.
969841437712957440 2018-03-02 07:46:32 UTC <tofureallysux> @DLoesch @NRATV If a person wants to live in a gun free community would you defend even that freedom?
969838529554481152 2018-03-02 07:34:58 UTC <tofureallysux> @stinchfield1776 @NancyPelosi @NYGovCuomo @SenFeinstein @NRATV @jr_venturino Do you a publicly available authoritative source for your flat out fact? Id like to be able to quote it.
969836145554026496 2018-03-02 07:25:30 UTC <tofureallysux> @stinchfield1776 @NancyPelosi @NYGovCuomo @SenFeinstein @NRATV Im Australian. The gun buy back and gun use laws help protect our community from what we see in the US every day. These measures plus background checking, law enforcement intelligence sharing, sustained community liaison and better armed cops make us safer. No militia required.
969832909052944385 2018-03-02 07:12:38 UTC <tofureallysux> @stinchfield1776 @NancyPelosi @NYGovCuomo @SenFeinstein @NRATV @jimcb1664 From an Australian with a law degree to an American with perception problems. The long arm gun laws in Oz are working fine. No mass school, cinema, concert shootings for decades. You want to talk about black market trade in small arms thats different but still no mass shootings.
969831088943017985 2018-03-02 07:05:24 UTC <tofureallysux> @stinchfield1776 @NancyPelosi @NYGovCuomo @SenFeinstein @NRATV Could we amend the last sentence in the quote to include all before have. This would include the right to life, the right to live in peace, the right to prosper, the right of a child to live in a safe environment. In reality, the right to own a gun is not a greater right.
969827956095836160 2018-03-02 06:52:57 UTC <tofureallysux> @DLoesch @NRATV Who gives a rats behind about what the Left are looking for.  Arent people still looking for a better deal on gun violence?
969827096645136384 2018-03-02 06:49:33 UTC <tofureallysux> @NRATV So we need our guns because the police arent doing their job. If we took away all the guns from the good people who arent about to go crazy and let the police go nuts on illegal guns/owners where would we be?
969536813227376640 2018-03-02 11:36:04 UTC <tofureallysux> @workmanalice Does the Black Rod have a twitter account?
969491856970063872 2018-03-02 08:37:25 UTC <tofureallysux> @oportoaustralia Oporto Majura Taking online orders but telling customers coming to collect that there is a 40 min wait on chicken, saying you cant cancel the order! Phone call to Menulog = order that couldnt be cancelled.... cancelled. Lying and greedy. Never going back.
969135144870191104 2018-03-01 08:59:58 UTC <tofureallysux> @politicsabc @OMGTheMess Skills, tools, motivation, intent, opportunity of your intruders? Compared to a bunch of journos? Whiteboard would be your choice of defensive barrier? If there was an actual threat to her person why bring her in via such an exposed route?
969099652258607104 2018-02-28 06:38:56 UTC <tofureallysux> @politicsabc @OMGTheMess BS. No threat in APH. Security screened and accredited media.
966631310964883456 2018-02-22 11:10:38 UTC <tofureallysux> @MrColionNoir @NRATV The gift of fear... These kids have time on their side. Remember that as you become old, frail and unable to pick up a gun. These kids dont need money they just need to vote.
966627484706865155 2018-02-22 10:55:26 UTC <tofureallysux> @MrColionNoir @NRATV @HbuiltHovey So the shooter just changes the location of where they hit people. Next idea? America is awash with guns so give everyone some regular safety and awareness training and give them a gun permit. Everyone can defend themselves. Welcome to the jungle.
966624187589705728 2018-02-22 10:42:19 UTC <tofureallysux> @MrColionNoir @NRATV @bmiles2000 Why should I have to pay for stuff so you can keep your guns? You want them then you pay.  Now thats a better plan.
966620985930723329 2018-02-22 10:29:36 UTC <tofureallysux> @MrColionNoir @NRATV Casting call? Do you mean the next militia member who loses it and guns down law abiding folks?
966620148558831617 2018-02-22 10:26:17 UTC <tofureallysux> @NRATV truth? Would that be a fact based thing or just putting out another political narrative? Lets talk about putting the right guns in sane hands. Oh and when is the militia meeting this week?
966618564915470336 2018-02-22 10:19:59 UTC <tofureallysux> @Nationwide @stinchfield1776 Well, you believe in freedom and and they exercised it.  Practice what you preach. Oh and please give more guns to the good guys, now if you could tell me which one will be the next to crack up and kill innocent citizens that would be great.
962275830620565504 2018-02-10 10:43:30 UTC <tofureallysux> @Channel7 is that presenter wearing a tshirt? Classy.

883628537642590209 2017-07-08 10:07:15 UTC <tofureallysux> @ROBANDTHEMOB That fair.
883628393597513728 2017-07-08 10:06:40 UTC <tofureallysux> @BaillieMediaCom So why didn't the phenomenal players win?
883628035726954497 2017-07-08 10:05:15 UTC <tofureallysux> @lalkamlesh1 Alternative, players from 4 countries that had little time to train together drew a series with a team that plays together full time.
883627466480263168 2017-07-08 10:02:59 UTC <tofureallysux> @jimimac_alf Agreed. Looked like he was worried that he'd get out of the stadium alive.

883624817131266048 2017-07-08 09:52:28 UTC <tofureallysux> @cain0844 Keep telling yourself that. If the ABs have so much talent why didn't they win? Just a cop out otherwise.
883624426595418112 2017-07-08 09:50:54 UTC <tofureallysux> @LatuMoses Keep dreaming. Days of AB reign are over.
