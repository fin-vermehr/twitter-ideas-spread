971222635173548032 2018-03-06 03:14:55 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @NRA @DLoesch @JZukawski @oharris30 1. Its not the same gun. 2. I respect your right to put you and your families safety in the hands of government....Broward Sherriff seems reliable....goid luck to you.
971221441529163777 2018-03-06 03:10:10 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @NRA @DLoesch @JZukawski @RuiRodTweeter Perhaps because the no fly list is largely worthless with nobody knowing how to get on or off of it.  Sen Ted Kenbedy was on it....yeah real helpful that list.
970797240259371008 2018-03-05 23:04:33 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @SenFeinstein Do you have armed security?
970794838969999362 2018-03-05 22:55:00 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @StephenAtHome @sandyspoint Gee thanks for your insight.  Did you know they were a hunting store long before they sold flannel sheets and preppy dog accessories?  The arrogance and ignorance in this thread is amazing.
970499519656943616 2018-03-04 03:21:31 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @DLoesch You are a great voice for the NRA, keep up the strong work!

970228808027660288 2018-03-04 09:25:48 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @thehill @Rightsof_Man Several states allow teachers to be trained and armed.  No theft, accidental discharges or friendly fire.....also, no school shootings.
970224228191690752 2018-03-04 09:07:36 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @thehill @Reps2020 You want them banned because criminals use them, but say criminals won't have them. Sheer liberal genius!
970108436947103744 2018-03-03 01:27:29 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @ahzimm @thedailybeast @tamkeller Ironic that those in Hollywoid making millions off of violent movies, are surrounded by armed security love to talk gun control.
970108070071357440 2018-03-03 01:26:02 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @ahzimm @thedailybeast @gill4161 Trayvon Martin might have something to say on the subject....
969702752585768965 2018-03-02 22:35:27 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @Official_BLM Yes, lets never forget six years ago a criminal learned a lesson.
969685910924222465 2018-03-02 21:28:31 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @LifeLock @davidhogg111 Hey stupid, the NRA had nothing to do with the shooting.  The SHOOTER was responsible.  Would you feel better had he drove a truck or crashed a plane into the bldg? Use your 1st amend. To do something other than infringe my 2nd!
969564057421385728 2018-03-02 13:24:19 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @GinaMar32347315 @LLBean The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed....except by multi million dollar companies looking to cash in on free publicity.  Can die for country at 18, but not enjoy your rights til 21?
969222772265226240 2018-03-01 14:48:10 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @realDonaldTrump @JNGlasstetter @_BlueGeorgia_ Try legally obtaing any gun in Chicago, DC or NYC...tough gun laws restrict law abiding citizens only.  Criminals bent on murder already do not care about the laws!
969222084508430336 2018-03-01 14:45:26 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @realDonaldTrump SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED.....enough said!
969049619308138496 2018-02-28 03:20:07 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @DICKS @Pyrusman2 With that thought process...banning hotdogs, bicycles and swimming pools should be next....they kill many more than all guns do.  And, what about the lawful use of guns to save lives? When seconds count the cops are only minutes away.

969039383545475073 2018-02-28 02:39:27 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @SteveScalise  Congratulations for being a voice of reason and a true representative.  Concealed carry has and will save lives.  As you know a handgun can stop a deranged murderer.  Keep up the good fight!
969037029391683584 2018-02-28 02:30:06 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @realDonaldTrump  Cave on "semi auto rifles" you will not have to worry about your next campaign manager, your political career will be over....why not be rational and objective?  Show me one gun law that EVER reduced crime!  You are turning on your base and it is disheartening.
968860421930278912 2018-02-28 14:48:19 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @DICKS I hope you stop selling knives, they kill more people annually than all rifles combined.  But, meanwhile Cabekas and Bass Pro have my business.
968134424511565830 2018-02-26 14:43:28 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @johncardillo Not a cop! Not a leader! A political hack that can take center stage and echo the progressives. They want us to rely on the system to protect us, yet the system failed in so many ways....#gunssavelives
968133415731187712 2018-02-26 14:39:28 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @elizabethforma @Jayred_R Oh, she will meet with Native Amer. Leaders, sign on to some bills and all will be forgiven...thats how dems solidify their base...promise them things and pay them.
967957877079052290 2018-02-25 03:01:56 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @10NewsWTSP Not giving up my rights, or giving up my duty to my family because of a derranged mass murderer. Fix background checks, do away with gun free zones, make soft targets less appealing. Only criminaks have guns in Chicago, how is that working out?
967848054840848384 2018-02-25 19:45:32 UTC <PAwithaGUN> Firing someone... Late to work, leaves early, lazy...always asking others to do her work.  But expects to stay part time.  No snowflake,  buh bye
967782539330052097 2018-02-25 15:25:12 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @IndivisibleChi @IndivisibleTeam @RepBost @Indivisible12th @IndivCarbondale Private sales are legal.  Buying privately at gun show no different than buying from neighbor, not a loop hole. If buying from dealer background check gets done.
967749035909177344 2018-02-25 13:12:04 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @IndivCarbondale @IndivisibleChi @IndivisibleTeam @RepBost @Indivisible12th Be honest....there is no gun show loophole.  Still must pass background check. CANNOT buy guns online...they go to dealer for same check.  Already laws against "boyfriend"....
967738038234304514 2018-02-25 12:28:22 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @JohnCornyn @PittieBoo Murder is illegal, right? What new law is going to stop a mentally ill person from mass murder?
967095117118132224 2018-02-23 17:53:38 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @hchrystal99 Yeah, he also was going to get fired for NOT doing his job
967093697274933248 2018-02-23 17:47:59 UTC <PAwithaGUN> #BanAssaultWeapons Nah, I will keep my guns.  Ban the gun free zones and enact concealed carry reciprocity.
967091747405926400 2018-02-23 17:40:14 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @SenFeinstein @MikeMur96142190 And armed guards....  Perhaps her wealth makes she and her family more important than everybody else.
967091165966282753 2018-02-23 17:37:56 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @SenFeinstein @azmartin42 Educate yourself..... AR 15 NOT automatic....
967090571465633792 2018-02-23 17:35:34 UTC <PAwithaGUN> @SenFeinstein Nice try... AR15 is not a magic gun.  In FACT it is illegal to hunt with them in many states as it is underpowered.
967065962989195266 2018-02-23 15:57:47 UTC <PAwithaGUN> #BoycottNRA Lets also boycott water, hotdogs and kitchen knives as they kill more people annually than guns do.
967059414682398720 2018-02-23 15:31:46 UTC <PAwithaGUN> #BoycottNRA Not going to listen to "demands" that the constitution be changed when they come from a generation that needs safe spaces and has to be reminded not to eat laundry detergent!
