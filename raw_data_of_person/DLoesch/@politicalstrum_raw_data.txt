The left will call for even stronger regulations starting a process which ends with our second amendments rights being completely degraded. And its a lot harder to regain a right then it is to take it away.

We need to target this problem at the source with a change in culture, and the way in which we respond to these events.
970010328179322880 2018-03-03 18:57:38 UTC <politicalstrum> @cameron_kasky @BenSPLATT @discordiadept I agree with allowing the people who need it to receive appropriate care. However, how can you define mental illness? Its a loose term with no single right answer. Will the government stop anyone who has or has had depression from purchasing a firearm?

969963884898496512 2018-03-03 15:53:05 UTC <politicalstrum> @The_UnSilent_ This argument makes no sense, to characterize a gun as an assault rifle, the gun has to be able to function as an automatic. AR-15's are semiautomatic! Not to mention automatic weapons have been banned in the U.S. since 1994.
