Cremin, distinguished scholar in the field of education, has said that during the colonial period the Bible was the single most important cultural influence in the lives of Anglo-Americans.  Thus, the cornerstone of early American education was the Bible.

965364430933381120 2018-02-18 23:16:30 UTC <bonacci_mike> President Trump is not being paid to bring this country's economy, infrastructure, military, etc from low to high. He is doing it out of love for his country. So turn your minds from low to high and unite as a country of love rather than hate.
965362548785623040 2018-02-18 23:09:01 UTC <bonacci_mike> Negative low lives need to educate yourselves on Hillary's $145 million deal of our Uranium to Russia and Obama's donation of our $1.7 BILLION to Iran and get off of President Trump's back already. In the words of former 1st lady Obama, "when they go low we go high."
965362076825743361 2018-02-18 23:07:09 UTC <bonacci_mike> Please explain to me how it's Presidents Trump's fault for the High School shooting? The FBI knew months in advance about Cruz's odd behavior and plan to do this evil deed.

I guess we'll just have to catch and release bc it's just too difficult for the DOJ & FBI to do their jobs even if it's 1 illegal a day.Ucan baby steps

It's bad enough there are award shows televised almost every month. Who watches this garbage but those who are insecure and need awards to feel glorified and worshiped.
958295527463899136 2018-01-30 11:07:12 UTC <bonacci_mike> @InTouchMin So many people wonder the purpose why we were born on this earth. Here is the answer plan and simple.

Not cool NFL be a role model for children and not a porn show.

There is a huge difference between illegals and immigrants and immigrants don't like illegals being mixed in with them because it's liberals being prejudice towards immigrants.

952400621457453056 2018-01-13 04:42:57 UTC <bonacci_mike> @andersonDrLJA Dems need to realize that America has so many different races that the race card has turned into the boy who cried wolf too many times nobody listens. Time for dems to learn this painful lesson no more daddy Obama to pamper them it's time for responsibility.

952195628989231104 2018-01-13 15:08:23 UTC <bonacci_mike> April Ryan you owe MLK's family an apology bc of your lack of respect at MLKday. If Trump were a racist he wouldn't have had a celebration for MLKday and MLK's family to WH. Ms Ryan you need to keep Dr MLK's hope alive bc your shouts lack it
952193420927254528 2018-01-13 14:59:37 UTC <bonacci_mike> Ms Ryan do you remember national prayer day at WH and President Obama uninvited Rev.Franklin Graham from the event? If you were there would you've yelled, "Mr. President, Are you Anti-Christ?" Forgiveness, Respect, Love, Peace that's MLK&Christ Please stop hate of PresidentTrump
952184410828193792 2018-01-13 14:23:48 UTC <bonacci_mike> In regards to Trump calling Haiti a shit hole unless you've been there the only complaint you should have is Trump's lack of putting it nicely. Unless you've been to Haiti shutup. Why do u think Haitians want to leave. Nothing racist about it. ProveTrumpwrong by actions not talk

947018627492040704 2017-12-30 08:16:50 UTC <bonacci_mike> @LovLikeJesus It's true try for 2 weeks you'll see. Start with a paragraph a day if that's all the time u have. I recommend study Bibles in today's English. This so u have no excuse not understanding. Pray and ask Holy Spirit to teach and guide u that's why Jesus sent HS to teach guide us
947015822723006464 2017-12-30 08:05:41 UTC <bonacci_mike> @LovLikeJesus God's word is a miracle n itself. It's the only book that comes alive as u read it. U and I read the same passage and get different answers bc we have different questions. The Bible always brings love joy peace answers not evil lies or hate. Try it for yourself and see a miracle.

All I can say is I must be blessed for the devil to bring such hardship. I just wish they could see.

929578328012464129 2017-11-11 05:15:18 UTC <bonacci_mike> @thesamsorboshow @FoxNews @DandelionDollar There's a Godly legal way into this country what's ungodly about it? Same in getting into heaven and that's one way through Jesus. Did you know 75% of people who claim to be Christian only 25% actually read His word why is that?

929567281385914370 2017-11-11 04:31:25 UTC <bonacci_mike> @realDonaldTrump I agree with you but they don't know because they're use to past presidential abuse. We're not use to winning. Many rather stick with the evil they know than change to the good they don't know. Praying for you and our country as always

824044890740789250 2017-01-24 00:03:06 UTC <bonacci_mike> Very disrespecting for adults to act like middle school children throwing insults at Barron. Mini Trump has done nothing to deserve slander.https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/824041979147386881
