Hey, how do you feel about a mentally impaired 18 year old kid purchasing a 50 cal sniper rifle, such as a Barrett M107? Giving him the ability to kill the person of his choice from 1.5 miles away. Kinda lays waste to your argument huh. Common sense.

If so, do you think it might read differently?? Common sense is a bitch.
