966654345935810563 2018-02-22 12:42:10 UTC <jmdzampieron> Been running some in development microservices in 2.0.0-RC2. Like the experience. Really like where WebFlow/Reactor is and is going.https://twitter.com/snicoll/status/966355424260837381
963504580570042368 2018-02-13 20:06:07 UTC <jmdzampieron> Starting to teach myself to use Seastar from @ScyllaDB for high-concurrency, low-latency micro-services.  Next thought... how to use DPDK in containers...
953997845094428672 2018-01-18 14:29:45 UTC <jmdzampieron> @jessfraz Bought one of these nearly 20 years ago: https://www.middleatlantic.com/products/racks-enclosures.aspx Still like it.
953638445527781377 2018-01-17 14:41:37 UTC <jmdzampieron> @jessfraz In many non-Software Engineering disciplines this has been referred to as "intrinsically safe design" for decades.
952301911016951808 2018-01-13 22:10:43 UTC <jmdzampieron> @jessfraz I am reminded of: "Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world." and "It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity." and "Any fool can know. The point is to understand." - Albert Einstein
952193847655915520 2018-01-13 15:01:18 UTC <jmdzampieron> @alicegoldfuss You should add: Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach by Hennessy and Patterson.   Same Hennessy who was the President of Stanford and the founder of MIPS.
948174172437516288 2018-01-02 12:48:33 UTC <jmdzampieron> @jessfraz Considering Total Cost of Ownership / Value Prop is important. Things that are core to our business we make. Buying Infra products keeps us focused and on task.
947111559133913088 2017-12-30 14:26:06 UTC <jmdzampieron> One of those days when you miss ZModem.

931974984335089664 2017-11-18 19:58:46 UTC <jmdzampieron> @alicegoldfuss File Systems and most RDBMS (e.g. postgres), amongst other things.
930576168692088833 2017-11-14 23:20:22 UTC <jmdzampieron> @Azure @HashiCorp @listonb Running #DCOS on #Azure using #Terraform. The basic features of #Azure are well covered. Some semantics of when a resource is marked dirty may need updates. Getting better all the time. Always looking for more fine grained control over "apply" (i.e. rolling updates).
922830952371539970 2017-10-24 14:23:39 UTC <jmdzampieron> My corollary to Knuths law: Premature scaling is the root of all evil
921462315307945984 2017-10-20 19:45:10 UTC <jmdzampieron> Some days you long for real hardware instead of the cloud.
918268103385145344 2017-10-11 00:12:31 UTC <jmdzampieron> Tech recruiter: Tries to get a SRE/DevOps interview for someone with automaton skills. The position is not with a robotics company.
917876988735606790 2017-10-10 22:18:22 UTC <jmdzampieron> @leifwalsh Do I have to be to participate in a casual, polite conversation? There's piles of empirical evidence to support my opinion.
917423598343778309 2017-10-09 16:16:45 UTC <jmdzampieron> @leifwalsh Applying inflexible process like this to fix a human problem usually trends toward mediocrity.

914531409053831168 2017-10-01 16:44:13 UTC <jmdzampieron> Time for the limit ICE/CBP bill. No jurisdiction or authority outside enumerated border crossings and only within the immediate travel zone.
