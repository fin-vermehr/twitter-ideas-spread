800483681668399104 2016-11-20 23:39:16 UTC <dkobithen> The Eagles need about six new WRs.
800482579673714688 2016-11-20 23:34:53 UTC <dkobithen> Wilson is a better WR than Agholor.

709962466755813377 2016-03-15 04:40:17 UTC <dkobithen> @Reince I havent heard a single policy from the GOPs leading candidate.
709908387459420160 2016-03-15 01:05:23 UTC <dkobithen> We just got a lot closer to having Hillary Clinton as president.
709575284773617665 2016-03-14 03:01:45 UTC <dkobithen> But seriously, Bernies response to Hillary asking where he was when she was trying to reform health care in the 90s was great.

706691084621975552 2016-03-06 04:00:58 UTC <dkobithen> @CloydRivers except Trump would hire them, then stiff them on their pay by filing for bankruptcy after the job was complete

706165793789231104 2016-03-05 17:13:39 UTC <dkobithen> . @realDonaldTrump probably smells like salami thats been sitting in the sun for four hours.
706165632287510531 2016-03-05 17:13:01 UTC <dkobithen> I dont know why they show @realDonaldTrump live, he has the same speech every single time hes in front of the camera. Never anything new.
705978374829641730 2016-03-04 04:48:55 UTC <dkobithen> I dont understand the petitions for #ChrisChristie to resign. Its called an election, and he won it. Twice.

705719125570498560 2016-03-04 11:38:45 UTC <dkobithen> @FoxFriendsFirst @FoxNews Kasich won the debate. Trump lost. But neither result has any affect on their campaigns.

704688166347800576 2016-03-01 15:22:05 UTC <dkobithen> @Cpmullen37 its a reality that if the race doesnt get down to two candidates, and within days, Trump will have locked up the nomination
704595725280276480 2016-03-01 09:14:46 UTC <dkobithen> I wonder how all of these anti-establishment #Trump supporters are gonna feel when their nominee loses to Hillary Clinton in November?
704050801468055553 2016-02-28 21:09:26 UTC <dkobithen> @_karleeeyk and naps. Mostly naps.

703428544182022144 2016-02-26 03:56:48 UTC <dkobithen> @FoxNews @tedcruz then maybe its time to get down to two candidates.
703420661050576896 2016-02-26 03:25:29 UTC <dkobithen> @RepublicanGirls if trump is the nominee, were probably handing it to her anyway

703271089305214976 2016-02-26 17:31:08 UTC <dkobithen> @CloydRivers people hate Trump because he's an ass hat. And acts accordingly.
703237408771448832 2016-02-26 15:17:18 UTC <dkobithen> @marcorubio well, we are unless you or the other candidates drop out to make it a two person race
703227553004331008 2016-02-26 14:38:08 UTC <dkobithen> @PolitiFact but who is going to pay for the people trump is giving health care to on the street?

695424262182563840 2016-02-04 01:50:39 UTC <dkobithen> @Rachel__Nichols it's hard to make a case when the witness won't cooperate; hence the cycle.

694923256369778688 2016-02-03 16:39:50 UTC <dkobithen> It appears @realDonaldTrump's people gave him his phone back finally after his defeat in Iowa.
