970080329380892672 2018-03-03 23:35:48 UTC <Genewoodtigers> @PeytonManning @PaxtonLynch @MileHighReport @captlinger Could you compare the reps? As in the total number per season?
970038050888744960 2018-03-03 20:47:48 UTC <Genewoodtigers> @MileHighReport I watched his amazing growth @TigersAthletics Memphis, because he was allowed to grow. There were pains, but he excelled. Remember Peytons first year as a Colt: 3-13 with more 26 TDs and 28 INTs. Give Paxton a chance
970036551190220802 2018-03-03 20:41:50 UTC <Genewoodtigers> @MileHighReport Give @PaxtonLynch a chance to play/develop for an ENTIRE season. You cant grow from erratic starts, being pulled after a half, etc. who the hell on this team knows how to develop talent. When @PeytonManning was drafted he was thrown into the mix and was allowed to suck. #faith
