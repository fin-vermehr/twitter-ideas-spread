956998889478991872 2018-01-26 21:14:50 UTC <stephenyouhanai> @LeonardPittsJr1 Excellent article about how the Dems been had.  The best article I've seen on that subject.

955518085905178624 2018-01-22 19:10:39 UTC <stephenyouhanai> @ChuckSweeny You had an interesting thing happen in the 17th Cong Dist.  A well funded Republican drops out not even two weeks after being questioned about donating $1000 to Bustos.  Follow that money. Small amount, but why?
954503427404587008 2018-01-19 23:58:45 UTC <stephenyouhanai> @RSusmarski Saw your Jan 3 article on Kleine contributing to Bustos.  Interesting that 6 days later he fires his campaign staff, and withdraws from the race on the 16th.  Good report, but both sides were lying their butts off.

952545024859951104 2018-01-14 14:16:46 UTC <stephenyouhanai> @osmastro  I served at 2nd div hq at camp Casey, s. Korea.  There is no way that a conventional war could be launched successfully on either side.  Only 3 lanes of attack which an idiot commander could turn into a junkyard
