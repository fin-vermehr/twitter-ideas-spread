971065004534329344 2018-03-06 16:48:33 UTC <lonny_knoll> @perlmutations Show business dumps enough on itself by having stupid arguments and saying stupid things. You are a case in point.
971055707247095809 2018-03-06 16:11:36 UTC <lonny_knoll> @WalshFreedom With CNN's ratings so low are they even a viable news organization any more?
970785092032344064 2018-03-05 22:16:16 UTC <lonny_knoll> @GmorganJr Matthew 24:27  For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
970700533425094656 2018-03-05 16:40:16 UTC <lonny_knoll> @prageru @RealCandaceO Very well done. Simply great messaging.  Loved it.
970372360858562560 2018-03-04 18:56:14 UTC <lonny_knoll> @WilliamShatner Just like all of Hollywood, especially the Oscars.
969185928932544512 2018-03-01 12:21:46 UTC <lonny_knoll> @realDonaldTrump Your pandering to the Democrats yesterday is making me 2nd guess my support for you in 2020. No gun ban, no raising the legal age. Due process! Mental health screening for those showing signs is it.
968970940418744320 2018-02-28 22:07:29 UTC <lonny_knoll> @realDonaldTrump I must say that you are wrong for not including the concealed carry reciprocity in the negotiations. This is just as vital as safety in schools. In fact it works hand in hand.
968969033696595968 2018-02-28 21:59:54 UTC <lonny_knoll> @CharlieDaniels Hate is like fire. It burns the person holding it.
968866276461473792 2018-02-28 15:11:35 UTC <lonny_knoll> @realDonaldTrump So fire Sessions and get Trey Gowdy.
968237540695097344 2018-02-26 21:33:13 UTC <lonny_knoll> @KyleJeter @davidhogg111 @ABetterMan16543 @iamchrisrabkin @taraross_7 It takes 10,000 hours of experience on average to be considered an expert at anything. He's a victim. He can describe his experience,  otherwise he should keep his yap shut about things he has no concept.
968233441874427904 2018-02-26 21:16:56 UTC <lonny_knoll> @TruthFeedNews @TrumpsBlonde He isn't going to outlive anyone with his stupid ideas.
968144928885809153 2018-02-26 15:25:12 UTC <lonny_knoll> @GmorganJr Wine is supposed to be good for the heart. Unfortunately I was turned off of wine because some how I managed to find the driest nastiest stuff ever. Do you have a heart healthy tasty wine recommendations?
967779967701430272 2018-02-25 15:14:59 UTC <lonny_knoll> @davidhogg111 There are 2 types of people in the gun debate. Those who are for the 2nd amendment is the 1st. The uninformed is the 2nd.
967664511074189312 2018-02-24 07:36:12 UTC <lonny_knoll> @butlersheriff Bless you all!
967473486376480768 2018-02-24 18:57:08 UTC <lonny_knoll> @CillizzaCNN Quit calling them good guys. They are cowards.
967194400701870081 2018-02-23 00:28:09 UTC <lonny_knoll> @SebGorka Finally some common sense initiatives.
967193959591165953 2018-02-23 00:26:24 UTC <lonny_knoll> @KurtSchlichter It's all in the training, obviously that whole department is beyond saving and needs to be flushed.
967193083921145856 2018-02-23 00:22:55 UTC <lonny_knoll> @piersmorgan They weren't good guys at all, but cowards who need to be relieved of duty. People properly trained would react differently. That sheriff needs to be fired with extreme prejudice as well as the cowardly deputies.
967191307885015040 2018-02-23 00:15:52 UTC <lonny_knoll> @michaeljknowles @brad_dupee As a veteran I can see a very important use for the AR-15, to defend against tyranny. Just because you are uneducated in it's uses doesn't mean the rest of us are.
967153686014148608 2018-02-23 21:46:22 UTC <lonny_knoll> @michellemalkin Driving isn't a fundamental right. Ban all cars.
967068828902440960 2018-02-23 16:09:10 UTC <lonny_knoll> @DineshDSouza @w_terrence God bless you sir.
967059319031152640 2018-02-23 15:31:23 UTC <lonny_knoll> @scrowder @simplejack2525 I am with you. After having a combat arm near me the whole time during deployment, I'd feel naked and vulnerable if I didn't have my home defense weapons. Meds have definitely improved my quality of life and feeling safe at home goes a long ways towards staying mentally strong.
966876791527763973 2018-02-22 03:26:05 UTC <lonny_knoll> @DineshDSouza @BasedMonitored Sounds like this "officer" had already retired in his mind and wasn't willing to risk anything. Highest form of cowardice.
966726120031711232 2018-02-22 17:27:22 UTC <lonny_knoll> @RealJamesWoods Repealing the 2nd ammendment would go over as well as prohibition of alcohol. The right to self protection is a god given right. Cannot be taken away by man.
966434602683215877 2018-02-21 22:08:59 UTC <lonny_knoll> @WilliamShatner Even if they are misguided and full of misinformation?
966332790227615746 2018-02-21 15:24:25 UTC <lonny_knoll> @Courtneyscoffs How about realizing that air travel is a pain no matter what and have some patience about boarding and unboarding the plane. Why the big rush?
965691849481449472 2018-02-19 20:57:33 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro @yashar Funny how millions if singers find a way to sing it to brilliantly enough to send chills down the spine, but ok this is stupid alright to try to change it.
965352475581493249 2018-02-18 22:29:00 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro @kylegriffin1 Granted the FBI were definitely playing around and not doing their jobs. This tragedy falls on their heads.
965338090498748416 2018-02-18 21:31:50 UTC <lonny_knoll> @yogaskidogs Gun control is totally stupid. It's like getting rid of all cars to stop a few drunk drivers. Not my car, not my guns.
964634365685776384 2018-02-16 22:55:29 UTC <lonny_knoll> @BarackObama How about we start with adding security for our schools and children first, instead of taking guns from law abiding citizens. Gun control is just so effective in Chicago isn't it.
962457134058299392 2018-02-10 22:43:57 UTC <lonny_knoll> @REALStaceyDash Great slogan, go for it!
959761338821046272 2018-02-03 12:11:49 UTC <lonny_knoll> @brithume Constructive next step is to deport DACA individuals ASAP
959515718185136128 2018-02-02 19:55:48 UTC <lonny_knoll> @BillHemmer @CollinsworthPFF Why what's going on Sunday?
959512918587981824 2018-02-02 19:44:41 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro @dandarling He committed a crime, deport him as the law requires.
957814038766825472 2018-01-28 03:13:56 UTC <lonny_knoll> @realDonaldTrump You should reject any deals and begin deporting all DACA. The wall comes first!
955945271652794368 2018-01-23 23:28:08 UTC <lonny_knoll> @GmorganJr @DavidNathanaelx @Ah_Science I believe what you are seeing as proof of a big bang is actually the remnants of divine creation. How else do you explain just the correct ratios between the 4 fundamental forces to get us here. Luck? Give me a break. Your supposed proof is no such thing.
955941836916383746 2018-01-23 23:14:29 UTC <lonny_knoll> @GmorganJr @DavidNathanaelx @Ah_Science Fine then the beginning of life and the big bang aren't even theories as the cannot be tested. Thanks for proving my point.
955934729353625600 2018-01-23 22:46:14 UTC <lonny_knoll> @GmorganJr @DavidNathanaelx @Ah_Science Show any testible evidence that life began and was not created. Show any testible evidence tgat the big bang happened. At this point both are theories.
953403370194190336 2018-01-16 23:07:31 UTC <lonny_knoll> @GmorganJr At least we don't throw sinners off of buildings.
946964570236522497 2017-12-29 04:42:01 UTC <lonny_knoll> @lsarsour Yeah and then you would be required to shut the hell up.
945140892364447750 2017-12-24 03:55:23 UTC <lonny_knoll> @WilliamShatner @prime_matrix He wasn't raising the funds, he was promoting an unpatriotic outfit trying to repair their brand. He would probably have been better off with a gofundme page supporting the charity.
945138394484523008 2017-12-24 03:45:27 UTC <lonny_knoll> @WilliamShatner @prime_matrix Not at all color doesn't come into the equation other than by a racist like you. White supremacist indeed.
945136336486273024 2017-12-24 03:37:17 UTC <lonny_knoll> @WilliamShatner @prime_matrix Proves my point you are just crude. I have charity in my heart just not for political entertainers. The only reason the NFL is trying to look charitable is to repair their brand.
945134573591052288 2017-12-24 03:30:16 UTC <lonny_knoll> @REALStaceyDash If President Trump can't then that means Obama couldn't either, thus they shouldn't have been allowed to serve in the first place.
945101529945481216 2017-12-24 01:18:58 UTC <lonny_knoll> @WilliamShatner @prime_matrix You are crude and unimaginative.
945101080328728581 2017-12-24 01:17:11 UTC <lonny_knoll> @WilliamShatner @Jo0392Jr Indeed! Lol. #BoycottTheNFL
945091999585071104 2017-12-24 00:41:06 UTC <lonny_knoll> @WilliamShatner @thehilligan As a Brit you are already giving all that up until Brexit happens.
945090135749681152 2017-12-24 00:33:41 UTC <lonny_knoll> @WilliamShatner Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean what I said wasn't true.
945086930760318976 2017-12-24 00:20:57 UTC <lonny_knoll> @WilliamShatner Again, linking a child's charity to the failing NFL is just sick. If they were dignified they would contribute without stipulations. Just a grab by the NFL to garner some kind of support as they are circling the drain.
945016710431571968 2017-12-24 19:41:55 UTC <lonny_knoll> @WilliamShatner What is sick is linking sick children to the failing NFL. If they want to support charity they should just do it without stipulation.
945011941851852800 2017-12-24 19:22:59 UTC <lonny_knoll> @WilliamShatner People can do what they want with the flag just as we can do what we want by not supporting the kneelers #BoycottTheNFL
942605627636965376 2017-12-17 04:01:09 UTC <lonny_knoll> @jaketapper Bwahahahahahahaha
942513897054990336 2017-12-17 21:56:38 UTC <lonny_knoll> @realDailyWire Geez the wall is only $21 Billion.
940612994332991494 2017-12-12 16:03:08 UTC <lonny_knoll> @sallykohn How arrogant you are to think that men care if you're a lesbian. You are no loss to the gene pool.
940579832886312960 2017-12-12 13:51:21 UTC <lonny_knoll> Yeah, freedom of speech says I can call him whatever I like.
940468273027588097 2017-12-11 06:28:04 UTC <lonny_knoll> What the hell is Xer, you meant him right?
940423235086139392 2017-12-11 03:29:06 UTC <lonny_knoll> @realDailyWire Sounds like they need to clean house at that VA starting with the guy at the top and run their investigation right from his vacant office.
940421672376549377 2017-12-11 03:22:53 UTC <lonny_knoll> Talk about a total nothing burger. @CNN you going to tell us how many times he has to go to the bathroom every day next? How about the consistency of his stools? That seems to be the kind of manure you deal in.
940420215036248064 2017-12-11 03:17:06 UTC <lonny_knoll> @RealSaavedra @realDailyWire George Soros belongs in jail. He has always been a corrupt human being ever since he was a Nazi sympathizer as a boy.
940419741709082624 2017-12-11 03:15:13 UTC <lonny_knoll> God bless you @REALStaceyDash  you are real fighter and I always enjoy your work.
940415793757503489 2017-12-11 02:59:31 UTC <lonny_knoll> @SebGorka End Visa Lottery too. That's how his sponsor came in.
940342932187443200 2017-12-11 22:10:00 UTC <lonny_knoll> @CillizzaCNN Then stop reporting false information, it's that easy.
940300733152243712 2017-12-11 19:22:19 UTC <lonny_knoll> @jaketapper How about having a high burden of proof than he said, she said, 30 years after a supposed incident.
939497778165702656 2017-12-09 14:11:39 UTC <lonny_knoll> No matter how many times you say it, it doesn't make it true @Acosta
939264059035095040 2017-12-08 22:42:57 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro She has no evidence for her allegation either. See how that works.
939180734232662016 2017-12-08 17:11:50 UTC <lonny_knoll> @nytimes @RealJamesWoods Large fires are generally caused by supressing small fires and allowing a build up of underbrush that is perfect tender for the larger fires.
939177526768713728 2017-12-08 16:59:06 UTC <lonny_knoll> @bylanbersity I have been where you are and where you were. Only by the grace of god did I survive. I hope you find strength now to keep going. Life is definitely worth living.
939117160206495745 2017-12-08 12:59:13 UTC <lonny_knoll> @funder It's going to be funny when the Palestinians realize that their funding is cut.
938929800667848705 2017-12-07 00:34:43 UTC <lonny_knoll> Where do we send the check?
938889973561823233 2017-12-07 21:56:28 UTC <lonny_knoll> @DineshDSouza They also still own  Bob Menendez and are probably only going to give him up when it's politically beneficial.
938810456860270592 2017-12-07 16:40:29 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro @ComfortablySmug No high ground for Dems because they still own Bob Menendez.
938799088308334592 2017-12-07 15:55:19 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro Great way to see where cuts in spending should take place. Just need to look at what areas shutdown.
938739328359923712 2017-12-07 11:57:51 UTC <lonny_knoll> @scrowder Sleep is for f*gs.
938623223918247937 2017-12-06 04:16:30 UTC <lonny_knoll> @Chet_Cannon @CLindstorm2 @WeAllWitnesses Sure, I can say taking a dump now is harder than my tour in Iraq. Doesn't make it true.
938609298560598021 2017-12-06 03:21:09 UTC <lonny_knoll> @Chet_Cannon @CLindstorm2 @WeAllWitnesses Hah, funny. You're trying to compare helping a little old lady across the street with walking through a minefield. You are a joke.
938595394308603905 2017-12-06 02:25:54 UTC <lonny_knoll> @Chet_Cannon @CLindstorm2 @WeAllWitnesses I call bullshit.
938585238493523968 2017-12-06 01:45:33 UTC <lonny_knoll> @AnnCoulter Frankens resignation means nothing if Bob Menendez isn't also resigning.
938522784392609792 2017-12-06 21:37:23 UTC <lonny_knoll> @ReaganBattalion You are smoking dope.
938522319667961856 2017-12-06 21:35:32 UTC <lonny_knoll> @realDonaldTrump God bless you Mr. President. You are winning! Keep up the good work and build that wall!
938520059760144384 2017-12-06 21:26:33 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro The Dems still have Menendez on their dirty little hands. Only going to give him up when it's politically beneficial.
938471175490961408 2017-12-06 18:12:18 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro You keep using the term credibly, but everything I've seen regarding the accusers of Roy Moore shows that they wouldn't stand up to even the most rudimentary cross examination.
938468955433328640 2017-12-06 18:03:29 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro They still cannot because Menendez still has a pass.
938457008906190848 2017-12-06 17:16:01 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro @terrycrews I hope you really get all that you deserve for having to suffer through this. The guilty need to pay for their disgusting actions.
938165344056655872 2017-12-05 21:57:02 UTC <lonny_knoll> @tariqnasheed This statement is so wrong on so many levels that your ignorance is definitely showing.
936794719903821831 2017-12-01 03:10:40 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro It would make for a great Christmas.
936416482187141121 2017-11-30 02:07:41 UTC <lonny_knoll> Don't give up @michaeljknowles you are on the correct side of the issue.
935997337637347328 2017-11-29 22:22:09 UTC <lonny_knoll> @redsteeze Better yet if you've never served in the military you shouldn't be able to vote. Why should you get suffrage without suffering?
935993590072754176 2017-11-29 22:07:16 UTC <lonny_knoll> @WilliamShatner I am so glad that I started following you yesterday. Two tweets in from you has already made my day.
935494705726464001 2017-11-28 13:04:53 UTC <lonny_knoll> @BretBaier @dcexaminer This can only assure a Democrat victory. Another attack from the swamp.
935245672143495168 2017-11-27 20:35:18 UTC <lonny_knoll> @realDailyWire I knew it! Feminists are finally growing a pair.
935167263065305088 2017-11-27 15:23:44 UTC <lonny_knoll> @jaketapper your fake news is showing. The documents and cases are putting the accusers in bad light.
934882069070544896 2017-11-26 20:30:29 UTC <lonny_knoll> @peta You hear about the Vegan who died climbing Mt. Everest? Tell me again how healthy it is?
933365113804820480 2017-11-22 16:02:38 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro Why is it wrong to fight for common decency? It seems to be one of societies great failings of late.
931675760233873410 2017-11-17 00:09:45 UTC <lonny_knoll> @AmandaPresto Looks like center right is next. On to Gab.
931613245890207745 2017-11-17 20:01:21 UTC <lonny_knoll> @scrowder Next will be child bride Barbie.
931552541145407489 2017-11-17 16:00:07 UTC <lonny_knoll> @GmorganJr The fact that the more science learns about how unlikely and rare life and our existence is the more scientists are turning towards gods existence should be a hint.
931209046626942977 2017-11-16 17:15:12 UTC <lonny_knoll> @ReaganBattalion How about Roy Moore stays in and Bob Menendez resigns
930974877711863808 2017-11-15 01:44:42 UTC <lonny_knoll> @DineshDSouza @joshdcaplan Sounds like a case of revenge on her part.
930928805161549824 2017-11-15 22:41:37 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro He brought up good points. Things that would come out with proper cross examination.
930902475430699008 2017-11-15 20:57:00 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro @FoxNews How can they be considered highly credible without any cross examination?
930825742614650881 2017-11-15 15:52:05 UTC <lonny_knoll> @realDonaldTrump You should have left them to their own devices. They broke the law. Is this why the DOJ isn't pursuing Hillary? You want her gratitude?
930466279873327104 2017-11-14 16:03:43 UTC <lonny_knoll> @Courtneyscoffs @EWErickson Fact of the matter we know Clinton broke the law. She mishandled classified information.
930236874257457152 2017-11-13 00:52:08 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro @guypbenson Of course she's willing to testify under oath,  so far nobody that has been caught lying has been prosecuted.
929542550892904448 2017-11-11 02:53:08 UTC <lonny_knoll> @dphaw Don't forget The Clintons and Menendez.
929237882375618560 2017-11-10 06:42:30 UTC <lonny_knoll> @SteveBannen Exactly, it didn't work for President Trump, let's hope it fails this time too so that they will stop crying wolf.
929212659588669443 2017-11-10 05:02:16 UTC <lonny_knoll> @brithume So when's enough, enough. Trump's accusers rapidly faded away after the election. I am sure Moore's will too. So why should they have any merit?
929196570305740800 2017-11-10 03:58:20 UTC <lonny_knoll> @Courtneyscoffs @Harry1T6 That's because he hasn't ran for President yet. When he does you can count on it especially if it works against Judge Roy Moore.
929165738669105152 2017-11-10 01:55:49 UTC <lonny_knoll> @SenJohnMcCain I am more concerned what you're going to do about Bob Menendez. 40 year old allegations don't hold any water.
929132913295106049 2017-11-10 23:45:23 UTC <lonny_knoll> @AmandaPresto @StefanMolyneux He has already forgotten Obama?
929132610512494592 2017-11-10 23:44:11 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro @SenMikeLee Your opinion would have more weight if you would start a coalition to get Senator Menendez to step down.
929109141678800897 2017-11-10 22:10:56 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro @BenjySarlin I'm more stuck on an entire religion who's prophet married a 6 year old.
929103454194167808 2017-11-10 21:48:20 UTC <lonny_knoll> @KatTimpf @Courtneyscoffs @NRO Do they mean like Bill Clinton and Senator Menendez?
929100438330208256 2017-11-10 21:36:21 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro Key word is alleged. Going on the word of someone's 40 year old memory when she admitted herself that she wasn't a very reliable person. It's all he said she said. What do you do in the absence of proof or reliable witnesses?
929091872802275329 2017-11-10 21:02:18 UTC <lonny_knoll> @iptuttle They aren't running for Pope. I'd settle for not doing anything illegal before and after being in office.
927528134613725185 2017-11-06 13:28:34 UTC <lonny_knoll> @DineshDSouza Funny analogy as we have seat belt laws that encourage more seat belt use, shouldn't  we have more laws for lawful guns in more places then?
911973933552771072 2017-09-24 15:21:44 UTC <lonny_knoll> @benshapiro @guypbenson If you are unprofessional at work that is definitely an offense worthy of firing.
908281301156880384 2017-09-14 10:48:31 UTC <lonny_knoll> @realDonaldTrump Kids of bank robbers don't get to keep the money that their parents stole. No one should profit from illegal acts.
908280058103529472 2017-09-14 10:43:35 UTC <lonny_knoll> @realDonaldTrump Yes. Throw them out. By rewarding bad behavior you invite more bad behavior. Do what  you where elected to do. NO AMNESTY!
906962552768184320 2017-09-10 19:28:17 UTC <lonny_knoll> @SarahKSilverman You mean science like biology and that there are only 2 sexes male and female?
905825548462460930 2017-09-07 16:10:14 UTC <lonny_knoll> @RealJamesWoods I think that was the point James.
905507912801411072 2017-09-06 19:08:04 UTC <lonny_knoll> @BarackObama Can't you just shut up?
905099023803072512 2017-09-05 16:03:17 UTC <lonny_knoll> @SpeakerRyan @benshapiro @seungminkim Have done nothing wrong? They are here illegally. Send them back to their nation of origin and let them have the same adventure as   parents
