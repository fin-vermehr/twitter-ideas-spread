955487283049848832 2018-01-22 17:08:15 UTC <13Imogen13> @RealJamesWoods This shut down is about the wall just as much as DACA. I don't think he will give up on the wall. He's too smart to know if he wants to get reelected he must deliver on it.
955164358883053568 2018-01-21 19:45:03 UTC <13Imogen13> @realDonaldTrump @ScottBaio @carriechrist2 Or  because it's a conflict of interest since the Trump team is the victim of these violations? Its the GOP that wants it released. The dems want it blocked. Wouldn't Dems want it released if it was damaging to Trump???
955163540939329541 2018-01-21 19:41:48 UTC <13Imogen13> @realDonaldTrump @ScottBaio @DavePhDone @American_Pride6 Yeah, because someone's taxes and papers revealing corruption and violation of rights in the FBI are equally as important.
955163122477740032 2018-01-21 19:40:09 UTC <13Imogen13> @realDonaldTrump @ScottBaio @inventormama Its an obvious conflict of interest - he's both victim and head of executive branch. Best to let it go through the process of declassification.
955162335626321920 2018-01-21 19:37:01 UTC <13Imogen13> @realDonaldTrump @ScottBaio If his lawyers are smart, they instructed him not to. He's both the victim and head of the executive branch investigating these abuses so there is an obvious conflict of interest. Best to let it go through proper channels and then just not block the declassification.

How can you say the military is not impacted when they are working for no foreseeable pay?

954728380120948737 2018-01-20 14:52:38 UTC <13Imogen13> Brilliant. This was all part of Trumps plan. He let the investigation into him go on knowing it would bring these abuses to light without him lifting a finger. #ReleaseTheMemohttps://twitter.com/drawandstrike/status/954725748757204993

It was an attempt to get the WH to retaliate, then look like unprepared war moguls for starting WWIII. Fortunately, the WH didn't fall for it.

924626652247805952 2017-10-29 13:19:07 UTC <13Imogen13> If the indictment was ag anyone on Trump's team, it would be leaked to the press immediately. The fact we have no name is interesting.

912678580693463041 2017-09-26 14:01:45 UTC <13Imogen13> Kneeling is a symbol of subjugation, showing respect to someone higher than you. Players don't know by kneeling they are pledging loyalty.
912653684860948480 2017-09-26 12:22:49 UTC <13Imogen13> #taketheknee in the NFL is a sign of surrender. Kneeling before a government official is subjugation. That is why we stand tall 4 the flag.

896727478777020416 2017-08-13 13:37:45 UTC <13Imogen13> @FoxNews White Christian conservatives HAVE been condemning this all over social media. Is the MSM listening?

892724423270256640 2017-08-02 12:31:03 UTC <13Imogen13> @realDonaldTrump @mark28210 he has to be careful. Can't look like he's going after his former opponent.

873287167920963588 2017-06-09 21:14:20 UTC <13Imogen13> @LarrySchweikart What's this about Trump being 100% ready to testify? Testify for what!?!?
870314863138144258 2017-06-01 16:23:27 UTC <13Imogen13> Trump's tweets are so impactful even his typos trend and become part of our lexicon. #Covfefe @mitchellvii @gehrig38 @KelemenCari

848196808467771392 2017-04-01 15:34:12 UTC <13Imogen13> @adamhousley "The effect" (two e's together). You'd never say "the affect"! (Hint from English teacher!)
848195765914783746 2017-04-01 15:30:03 UTC <13Imogen13> @therealcornett It wouldn't look right if his admin arrested people who are (supposedly) investigating him for Russian links. Gotta let this play out.
848194843327291392 2017-04-01 15:26:24 UTC <13Imogen13> @therealcornett What's the source? Why isn't MSM covering this???
848194177863168000 2017-04-01 15:23:45 UTC <13Imogen13> @adamhousley is on his way to being the next Bernstein/Woodword. He's the only one with info on the unmasking and the leaker. @mitchellvii
848193240721494017 2017-04-01 15:20:01 UTC <13Imogen13> @adamhousley Why is none of this being reported? This makes Watergate look amatuer.
848192826022273025 2017-04-01 15:18:23 UTC <13Imogen13> @adamhousley @_LOVEINVAIN Snopes is hardly a reliable source.
848192401583878148 2017-04-01 15:16:41 UTC <13Imogen13> @adamhousley Will you be the next Bernstein and Woodword? No one else has this info.
848191901517963265 2017-04-01 15:14:42 UTC <13Imogen13> @adamhousley Is there any evidence of collusion? Or is that a trip down the rabbit hole to cover for the surveillance/unmasking?
848188290566168576 2017-04-01 15:00:21 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii Everything is RUSSIA. I burned my toast this morning = it's Russia's fault.

842016844294852609 2017-03-15 14:17:14 UTC <13Imogen13> Trumps tax returns prove he needs a better tax attorney since he paid a higher rate than nearly all his critics. #ThankYouMaddow

841836854806773760 2017-03-14 02:22:01 UTC <13Imogen13> Trump paid more taxes than Obama, MSNBC, Sanders, and than the average paid by the 1%. #38million @KelemenCari

841833358833283072 2017-03-14 02:08:07 UTC <13Imogen13> if Trump did leak his own taxes, he 1.  proved he paid his taxes 2.  proved he's rich 3. proved MSM is desperate 4. destroyed Maddow Win.

838528745770258432 2017-03-05 23:16:46 UTC <13Imogen13> The big question: does Trump have the FISA requests? @LarrySchweikart @mitchellvii @marklevinshow
838528169078554624 2017-03-05 23:14:29 UTC <13Imogen13> @KelemenCari he doesn't need the media - he's got the FISA requests. Waiting for right time to release!
838524328811630593 2017-03-05 22:59:13 UTC <13Imogen13> @LarrySchweikart @KeithVerity I heard speculation the fake dossier was used as the probable cause for the second FISA warrant

838403853318033408 2017-03-05 15:00:30 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii Six agencies were investigating Trump, including the FBI, the Treasuy Dpt, and the DOJ. He didn't order ANY of them?

838378257259061249 2017-03-05 13:18:47 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii could Russia actually be working WITH Trump's opposition? To keep Trump out?

838228979890991104 2017-03-04 03:25:37 UTC <13Imogen13> Prediction: #wiretapping never tied back 2 Obama. Someone (Lynch?) becomes scapegoat. End of Russia investigations. @LarrySchweikart
838228314439430146 2017-03-04 03:22:58 UTC <13Imogen13> @maryannemarsh @JudgeJeanine @dndelisabeth first FISA was June 2016, not 2015. Trump was running but not nominee yet. Still they got 0.
838226370778054656 2017-03-04 03:15:14 UTC <13Imogen13> @LarrySchweikart what are your thoughts on this? Used for second FISA attempt?pic.twitter.com/t9OYUvroS0

838225952232583168 2017-03-04 03:13:35 UTC <13Imogen13> @LarrySchweikart they must have known he would be the nominee?

838137114990620676 2017-03-04 21:20:34 UTC <13Imogen13> @KelemenCari @mark28210 Most people knew Trump was too quiet and was ready to strike back. Well, there ya go!
838131992524881928 2017-03-04 21:00:13 UTC <13Imogen13> Is it a coincidence Trump tweeted #obamagate on the day of #March4Trump ? This guy knows timing for impact! @KelemenCari @mark28210
838124898727915520 2017-03-04 20:32:02 UTC <13Imogen13> @jonfavs @painter_nancy Prez can certainly "ask" someone in the DOJ to ask for a warrant. Plausible deniability.

802318812590718976 2016-11-25 01:11:25 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii but if they somehow took WI from Trump could they use it to claim evidence of election rigging?

801872802798256128 2016-11-24 19:39:08 UTC <13Imogen13> Heard a report that 6 faithless electorals won't vote Trump. Can someone verify? @mitchellvii @JackPosobiec @KellyannePolls @Cernovich

801528223020580865 2016-11-23 20:49:54 UTC <13Imogen13> @DineshDSouza no, it's like watching a team go for More yardage after the winning touchdown has already been made.
801476892121505792 2016-11-23 17:25:56 UTC <13Imogen13> @Cernovich to be honest I wondered this myself. Whether or not he is, it's nobody's business.

800838041799720961 2016-11-21 23:07:22 UTC <13Imogen13> @Starbucks @bakedalaska @Ericb20 it's not a boycott - it's a statement.

798340355674476544 2016-11-14 01:42:27 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii Old media had a lot of influence turning voters off of the old candidates and government corruption.

798180547243614208 2016-11-14 15:07:26 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii MI hasn't officially been called? Could it be the popular vote in MI will give him the national pop vote lead?

798005999659614209 2016-11-13 03:33:51 UTC <13Imogen13> @FoxNews Trump is to blame for her defeat - he outplayed her. More rallies, more exposure, better plans, and better turnout.
797960936057208833 2016-11-13 00:34:47 UTC <13Imogen13> @realDonaldTrump @USAforTrump2016 I disagree. He needs to hold the cards that he "might" prosecute her someday.

797604750409744385 2016-11-12 00:59:25 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii You sure they won't win this one? They want the EC to go to Hillary because of the PV.

795264433681469440 2016-11-06 13:59:50 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii Lots were dropped on Hillary from the FBI and Wikileaks. They have nothing on Trump.
795234221887553536 2016-11-06 11:59:47 UTC <13Imogen13> @JackPosobiec hillabots are calling it staged. That tells me they are scared he's winning & assassination attempt will help him.

795086070341926914 2016-11-05 02:11:05 UTC <13Imogen13> That's it. Trump just won the election. He comes back on stage after an assassination attempt. That's gonna resonate with people.

795045712841101312 2016-11-05 23:30:43 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii agreed. I think trump wins Michigan and FL but loses PA.

785266331822284800 2016-10-09 23:50:57 UTC <13Imogen13> The gloves are off. Trump appears in a press conference with 4 Clinton accusers. They will also be in the audience. Checkmate. @mitchellvii

778893507851350016 2016-09-22 09:47:38 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii this will all only help Trump
777689043161145345 2016-09-18 02:01:31 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii So is it a rumor, or is it fact you just cannot share or confirm yet?
777685778029608960 2016-09-18 01:48:32 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii Trump is winning CA or NY? (one can hope)

777472832406228992 2016-09-18 11:42:22 UTC <13Imogen13> What's scary is this is obviously the best her handlers could do. #zombiehillary @mitchellvii @KellyannePollshttps://twitter.com/bocavista2016/status/777381015899832320
777472537810898944 2016-09-18 11:41:12 UTC <13Imogen13> If this is the best they can get her to look to reporters she's sicker than we thought. #zombiehillary @mitchellviipic.twitter.com/zBWgpGi80A
777465765117263872 2016-09-18 11:14:17 UTC <13Imogen13> If this is how looks during an 8AM call, god knows what she'd be like at a 3AM call. #zombiehillary @mitchellviipic.twitter.com/3IxrhiTKtA
777303651471720448 2016-09-17 00:30:06 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii or put "xx" and "xy" on the doors. End of argument.
777273867316318209 2016-09-17 22:31:45 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii @1abovethenoise Mondale didn't have huge crowds. Decent-sized crowds, maybe. And there was no enthusiasm behind his campaign.
777161782725120000 2016-09-17 15:06:22 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii Hillary's attacks on Trump are getting old. SSDD. No one is listening. @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump @DanScavino
776840850533937152 2016-09-16 17:51:06 UTC <13Imogen13> @JP_Cantillo I must admit I love watching this.....

776840390481702912 2016-09-16 17:49:16 UTC <13Imogen13> @benshapiro @mark28210 Trump: "Now that you watched them praise me, let's talk about birthers. It's over. Stop talking about it." Drops mic.
776814467556315137 2016-09-16 16:06:16 UTC <13Imogen13> @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Sure, and she owes the American People an apologies for calling half of us deplorable
776590886620782593 2016-09-15 01:17:50 UTC <13Imogen13> Finally Real Clear Politics averages are acknowledging a Trump momentum. It just got real. @mitchellvii
776434141847887872 2016-09-15 14:54:59 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii I don't think so. He kept discussing single mothers.
776223843614613504 2016-09-14 00:59:20 UTC <13Imogen13> @FoxNews @yepitsrigged Don't forget "seizing"
775855214180040704 2016-09-13 00:34:32 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii How are the swing states looking? Most "polling experts" have Hillary with 270-300 electorals.
775851777380024325 2016-09-13 00:20:53 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii you saw the campaign's private internals?
775850008138616832 2016-09-13 00:13:51 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii You have inside info, don't you?
775846331940241408 2016-09-13 23:59:14 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii you cannot tease us! Does it have to do with our future president???
775801319554711552 2016-09-13 21:00:22 UTC <13Imogen13> @AnnCoulter Well, now we know why she runs to the bathroom during debates.
775356696759795712 2016-09-12 15:33:36 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii no one is buying this. It just makes it difficult for trump to highlight her health, but the public knows....
775152369893986304 2016-09-11 02:01:41 UTC <13Imogen13> @always_trump something fell out of her pants today???
775150295001075712 2016-09-11 01:53:26 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii First she has allergies, then she's fine, then she overheated, now pneumonia? why not say that earlier?pic.twitter.com/tbw9IU3OFB
775095245268582400 2016-09-11 22:14:41 UTC <13Imogen13> @ZekeJMiller Don't you need a chest X-ray to confirm pneumonia? Does she have an Xray in her home? @mitchellvii
775094908818366464 2016-09-11 22:13:21 UTC <13Imogen13> First she "short circuits" then she "overheats." What is she? A robot? @DanScavino @mitchellvii @KellyannePolls @TheKuhnerReport
775068483121917952 2016-09-11 20:28:21 UTC <13Imogen13> @USAforTrump2016 That's a hashtag waiting to happen....#MedicalEpisode
775066614047739904 2016-09-11 20:20:55 UTC <13Imogen13> @DRUDGE_REPORT Seizure. No doubt.
775066525875081218 2016-09-11 20:20:34 UTC <13Imogen13> @johncardillo It looks like a seizure. Her head jerks, then she loses coordination/muscle control. Handlers saw the onset and were ready.
775047401631539200 2016-09-11 19:04:34 UTC <13Imogen13> @mark28210 @thehill Seizure. Anyone who has had one or witnessed one knows what it looks like. It looks like her.
775041843700572160 2016-09-11 18:42:29 UTC <13Imogen13> @USAforTrump2016 I knew it! Seizures!
775032306331516928 2016-09-11 18:04:35 UTC <13Imogen13> @HillaryClinton @FoxNews Seizure. You can see the onset. Then she loses coordination or muscle control.
775032096284872708 2016-09-11 18:03:45 UTC <13Imogen13> @USAforTrump2016 Seizure. Her head jerks, then she loses coordination or muscle control. Her team recognized onset & were prepared to assist
775024405458149376 2016-09-11 17:33:12 UTC <13Imogen13> @HillaryClinton @FoxNews Looks like a seizure to me. She either lost consciousness or muscle control. Heat/crowds can be a trigger.
775024076968587264 2016-09-11 17:31:53 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii Heat or large crowds (lack of oxygen, close prox) can trigger SEIZURES. Looked like that to me.
775023829852774405 2016-09-11 17:30:54 UTC <13Imogen13> @AnnCoulter She didn't faint. Looks like a seizure to me. She either lost consciousness or lost muscle control. Heat/crowds can contribute.
775023498766979072 2016-09-11 17:29:36 UTC <13Imogen13> @ZekeJMiller She had a seizure and either lost consciousness or muscle control. Heat or crowds can contribute to seizure onsets.
775023275034435584 2016-09-11 17:28:42 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii I have heard a committee (it may be made up of delegates) can decide on the new nominee.
775022923539185664 2016-09-11 17:27:18 UTC <13Imogen13> @AllenWest Looks like a seizure. She either lost muscle control or lost consciousness. My son used to get them so I know it too well.
775022693808762880 2016-09-11 17:26:24 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii I'm sure they already know what it is. Mark my words, she's having seizures.
775021579222777856 2016-09-11 17:21:58 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii I guarantee she had a seizure. I'd recognize it anywhere.
775021466408615936 2016-09-11 17:21:31 UTC <13Imogen13> @Viccimn @mitchellvii @rarity101 I was thinking it looked like a seizure in which she lost consciousness or at least awareness.
775021186283671552 2016-09-11 17:20:24 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii I just saw the video. She didn't faint. That was a seizure in which she lost consciousness. My son gets them so I know...
774956116677648384 2016-09-11 13:01:50 UTC <13Imogen13> @greta I want to see her health records. More than anyone's tax returns or speeches, the mental ability of a candidate is important.
774924476857192448 2016-09-11 10:56:07 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii She didn't apologize for the deplorable comment - only the 1/2 comment. She really meant "ALL are deplorable."
774924177824329728 2016-09-11 10:54:56 UTC <13Imogen13> @USAforTrump2016 I want to!

773266638787534848 2016-09-06 21:08:27 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii there was a similar energy when Obama won in 08. I felt it again when Scott Brown won Teddy K's seat. I feel it now with Trump.
773265999311306754 2016-09-06 21:05:55 UTC <13Imogen13> @RealTrumpDoc @mitchellvii @JerryFande Just curious if you are hypothesizing those percentages or if you have some inside polling info?
773264927171743744 2016-09-06 21:01:39 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii but he is winning. Several polls including CNN have him +2. State polls have him up as well.
772957325862793216 2016-09-05 00:39:21 UTC <13Imogen13> @greta then takes her second coughing fit in a day and cuts a Q&A short - THAT's the real story.

772888367960879104 2016-09-05 20:05:21 UTC <13Imogen13> @AnnCoulter thanks for reminding the American people Mr. Clinton was IMPEACHED for doing exactly what his wife did - PERJURY. @timkaine

770780945637146625 2016-08-30 00:31:12 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii I think the Hillary campaign are preparing their defense for when they lose this election. They can always say, "The Russians!"
770605837568057344 2016-08-30 12:55:23 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii What's there to "help" with? According to HRC, everything is great in the inner cities and AA community.
770601446316400641 2016-08-30 12:37:56 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii Jessie Jackson and MLK's niece have praised Trump's outreach and support. That says something.

770595485283393537 2016-08-30 12:14:15 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii I'm amazed at all the support he's getting from the AA community. I don't recall ANY of that for McCain or Romney.

768595554209263616 2016-08-24 23:47:14 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii Even the MSM and their polls are admitting the "race is tightening."

768215801627308032 2016-08-23 22:38:14 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii Voter turnout cannot truly be measured by the polls. R enthusiasm is very high. D = notsomuch

767884475728551936 2016-08-22 00:41:40 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii why should she campaign? The MSM is doing it for her as her proxy. She doesn't even need to show up.

767822991170338816 2016-08-22 20:37:21 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii Hillary is pulling ads out of PA, CO, and VA. Why? Is she certain of a win? Isn't that a risk for her & opportunity for Trump?
767694839009992705 2016-08-22 12:08:07 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii @OliMauritania Iindication is if the polls are oversampling D's then Trump is winning by so much that skewing no longer works
767643454310649856 2016-08-22 08:43:56 UTC <13Imogen13> @DanScavino there was an energy around Obama in 2008. I felt it when Scott Walker won Ted Kennedys seat too. I feel it now w/Trump.

767346004588843013 2016-08-21 13:01:58 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii Assuming this to be the most accurate poll, how many points has he gone up? 7 points in 10 days?
767345502463504384 2016-08-21 12:59:59 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii @mike__marchese I have heard the same thing. This may explain how they are skewing the polls.
767344256440758272 2016-08-21 12:55:01 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii He's up by 2 now???
767343097441312768 2016-08-21 12:50:25 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii I never pick up the phone if I don't know number. Thus I've never been polled.
767186284188237824 2016-08-20 02:27:18 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii @jacklex3 Caution absolutely, but the momentum is there.
767184937921441792 2016-08-20 02:21:57 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii I assume these polls do not reflect his change in tone and approach from this last week?
767182288128008192 2016-08-20 02:11:25 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii Can you list the polls? (getting excited!)
767182164068700160 2016-08-20 02:10:56 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii I won't feel comfortable until I see a real bump in the polls. Oversampled or not, I want to see upward trend.
767180015813484544 2016-08-20 02:02:23 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii Question: isn't voter turnout a variable the polls cannot account for? With enthusiasm for T so high and for H so low
767100802720796673 2016-08-20 20:47:38 UTC <13Imogen13> @GirlnameTobi @Gregg093 @mitchellvii @michelleoverby2 Yeah, that's my one concern. He may win pop vote, but lose electoral.
767100658969346048 2016-08-20 20:47:03 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii @Gregg093 @GirlnameTobi  I totally believe Sandy was what put Obama over the top. Optics r important. Optics of Trump in LA.
767098904601038848 2016-08-20 20:40:05 UTC <13Imogen13> @DanScavino Why aren't you publicizing more Trump's truck of donations to LA victims?

767081211743309825 2016-08-20 19:29:47 UTC <13Imogen13> @FoxNews @schwaid so Obama was right to stay golfing? And bush was right to stay out of NO?

766247856697114624 2016-08-18 12:18:19 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii Fox just showed one of those dial polls to indicate voters' responses during last 3 speeches. T's speech got B+/A- from Indep.
766243775001788416 2016-08-18 12:02:06 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii why is this not being reported more??? Ummm no...nevermind....

766113070204747776 2016-08-17 03:22:44 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii excuse my ignorance, but given the fact there are more D voters than R's, what would the "handicap" for a fair poll look like?
766020824709103626 2016-08-17 21:16:11 UTC <13Imogen13> @Cernovich @mitchellvii @mlynnkc1 Clinton +22? How is that possible?
765994643079192576 2016-08-17 19:32:09 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii what 3 polls show dead heat? I know zogby and LA times. What's the 3rd? Or are there more?
765994171832336384 2016-08-17 19:30:16 UTC <13Imogen13> actually I don't know the 3rd poll he's referring to. Searching for it now.

765991616171634688 2016-08-17 19:20:07 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii @kneeco28 http://m.washingtonexaminer.com/pollster-zogby-back-to-a-close-race-clinton-38-trump-36/article/2599471 and LA times has HRC +1.
765991252340924416 2016-08-17 19:18:40 UTC <13Imogen13> @mitchellvii LA Times poll has Hillary up by 1 and zogby has them at a statistical tie. Zogby: http://m.washingtonexaminer.com/pollster-zogby-back-to-a-close-race-clinton-38-trump-36/article/2599471

765898610051604480 2016-08-17 13:10:33 UTC <13Imogen13> @realDonaldTrump @BretBaier Thank you, Bret.
765895771526926336 2016-08-17 12:59:16 UTC <13Imogen13> @BretBaier I would ask: "Do you believe his speech last night will cause him to swing in the poll?" a - yes, b - no, it may even hurt

765540610572967936 2016-08-16 13:27:59 UTC <13Imogen13> @seanhannity Recent polls are very disheartening. Do u believe they are accurate?
765418228197851136 2016-08-15 05:21:41 UTC <13Imogen13> @SheriffClarke praying for you, your officers, and your city. Thank u and your crew. U do a thankless job.
765336109840818177 2016-08-15 23:55:22 UTC <13Imogen13> @realDonaldTrump @greta no
765151997087584256 2016-08-15 11:43:46 UTC <13Imogen13> @foxandfriends Gee, this is the same strategy the DNC was going to use for Sanders. Dump stories about campaign chaos in the media.
764888554937999360 2016-08-14 18:16:57 UTC <13Imogen13> @realDonaldTrump once the press is controlled by the government or any other entity, we cease to be a democratic republic. You HAVE to win!

764169000041476096 2016-08-12 18:37:41 UTC <13Imogen13> @AnnCoulter That's it. I cannot support a man who doesn't know the difference between "hyperbole" & "sarcasm."
764112552871723008 2016-08-12 14:53:23 UTC <13Imogen13> @TheKuhnerReport https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/08/10/donald-trump-shadowing-clinton-on-campaign-trail-media-avoiding-the-contrasting-optics/ I think this would make an interesting segment. Please consider it!
763541692804845569 2016-08-10 01:05:00 UTC <13Imogen13> @AshPratte @FoxNews Easy. Because the media twists it and inserts sensational headlines and bias commentary.
763540699908149248 2016-08-10 01:01:03 UTC <13Imogen13> @DSF2020 @realDonaldTrump Most biased media I've ever seen. Keep on message. Trust public to see truth. Be specific in rhetoric.
763539838830161920 2016-08-10 00:57:38 UTC <13Imogen13> @Jay_Severin She proved she owns FBI. She can - and has - get away with murder. How will our branches "check & balance" such a leader?
763539352815144962 2016-08-10 00:55:42 UTC <13Imogen13> @Jay_Severin Nay. I saw entire speech - beginning 2 end - live stream. I would never have thought violence and was shocked media thought so.
763357101251031040 2016-08-10 12:51:30 UTC <13Imogen13> @greta I'd pay money for that. No one to help frame Clinton's answers.
763346428630474752 2016-08-10 12:09:05 UTC <13Imogen13> @FoxNews So it wasn't Russia after all??? ;-)
763147200331325440 2016-08-09 22:57:25 UTC <13Imogen13> @FoxNews @greta @KarlRove Orlando gunman's father goes to H's rally  = media is silent. T asks 4 unity behind 2nd amend = media twists it
763097747142639618 2016-08-09 19:40:55 UTC <13Imogen13> @greta Yes. Of course. Optics aside, she is a "champion" for gay right, yet she is supporter by the father of someone who killed 50 gays?
762078915015868416 2016-08-06 00:12:26 UTC <13Imogen13> @fox25news Who paid them?
762078731137679360 2016-08-06 00:11:42 UTC <13Imogen13> @SheriffClarke I'm proud to follow you, sir. You are a credit to your uniform and a true American. God bless you and all our men in blue.

761742323441082368 2016-08-05 01:54:57 UTC <13Imogen13> @always_trump what is this? Where did it come from?
761640673749729280 2016-08-05 19:11:01 UTC <13Imogen13> @Jay_Severin guru J - what say u about reports GOP ready to dump Trump before Labor Day and insert own candidate? Wishful or media hype?
761640083321675776 2016-08-05 19:08:41 UTC <13Imogen13> @DamnRepublican @Jay_Severin I too am very silent about my support. Friends claim anyone who supports T is racist and subhuman.
761405478408687616 2016-08-04 03:36:26 UTC <13Imogen13> @realDonaldTrump just watched the speech you gave when you announced. We need that tone & rhetoric back to win.
761353580859101185 2016-08-04 00:10:13 UTC <13Imogen13> @fl_jerry I haven't seen that video! Thanks! But I did see one in which the money was unloaded. It was a EU station. Anchor had British acc.
761343575238074368 2016-08-04 23:30:28 UTC <13Imogen13> @BretBaier @fl_jerry that's not the video I saw. I saw one on a European feed. They clearly showed the pallets.
761342018165542912 2016-08-04 23:24:16 UTC <13Imogen13> @BretBaier The video I saw specifically unloaded the cash. The journalist on site even describe the transaction. I saw the video
761337055016288256 2016-08-04 23:04:33 UTC <13Imogen13> @BretBaier I saw the video on a European news feed the day the story broke. I'll look for the link. Video DOES exist.
761332262923296768 2016-08-04 22:45:31 UTC <13Imogen13> @FoxNews @greta no
761035511494348800 2016-08-03 03:06:19 UTC <13Imogen13> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity listen to Newt and Rudy.
761034872576024577 2016-08-03 03:03:47 UTC <13Imogen13> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity ur opponent is HC. Keep focus. Watch language media can twist. Attack her. Get a thick skin.
760962817533022208 2016-08-03 22:17:28 UTC <13Imogen13> @Jay_Severin Ahhhhh! Thank you for my civic (and polling) lesson for the day! I have become enlightened!
760961752574095360 2016-08-03 22:13:14 UTC <13Imogen13> @Jay_Severin Shouldn't #palletofcash be the lead story on all stations and the latest scandal?
760960516579790848 2016-08-03 22:08:19 UTC <13Imogen13> @Jay_Severin read an article today that polls are being stacked towards H by polling more Ds. Other commentators have mentioned it as well.
760906066850881540 2016-08-03 18:31:57 UTC <13Imogen13> @Jay_Severin it's a "good cop/bad cop" dynamic. I think it works to balance the ticket. The rouge and the peacemaker.
760841201318846464 2016-08-03 14:14:12 UTC <13Imogen13> @Jay_Severin Reason to vote T: T will b watched by both parties & all branches (checks/balances). Who will watch H? She proved she owns FBI.

759160086174531584 2016-07-29 22:54:03 UTC <13Imogen13> @Jay_Severin Remember NAB = Novelty of T + Anger of Bernies/rustbelt/voters + B***ch (H's personality) = T win. Ds don't know how 2 fight it
759159139058741248 2016-07-29 22:50:17 UTC <13Imogen13> @ChadLColeman Its looking good! Temps will be high but much more comfortable than we have been all week. See you there! Hammer time!
759046766536761344 2016-07-29 15:23:46 UTC <13Imogen13> @timkaine @BretBaier He was thinking about all the free time he'd have in the WH around all those interns if HRC wins.

758750653309067267 2016-07-28 19:47:07 UTC <13Imogen13> @Jay_Severin DT win = NAB theory: Novelty (he's new/interesting), Anger of voters/Bernies/cops, and B***ch (Hillary's personality).
758734944696807424 2016-07-28 18:44:42 UTC <13Imogen13> @davemorrissey64 Hot. Today is in the 90's and humid. Sat will be more comfortable in mid80s, Sun will be rain and upper 70s. See u there!
758732600294776832 2016-07-28 18:35:23 UTC <13Imogen13> @Jay_Severin DT keep his name in headlines, reminded public H's emails could have been hacked, and challenged Wiki to release remaining docs
758377096859250688 2016-07-27 19:02:44 UTC <13Imogen13> @realDonaldTrump if this is the best the press can do to insert controversy into his presser, then he's in good shape

757699034324893696 2016-07-25 22:08:21 UTC <13Imogen13> @BretBaier this could be a unified convention....if only they can stop saying the nominee's name....
757690130664722434 2016-07-25 21:32:59 UTC <13Imogen13> @Jay_Severin Ya know, this convention might actually go well - as long as they never mention Clinton's name.
757686396954021888 2016-07-25 21:18:08 UTC <13Imogen13> @christiangrose @FHQ Wlil this Unity Amendment affect the outcome of the 2016 presumptive nominee?

755546144986505217 2016-07-19 23:33:32 UTC <13Imogen13> @Jay_Severin The lifting of MO's exact words = too obvious. It was not an obscure speech.
