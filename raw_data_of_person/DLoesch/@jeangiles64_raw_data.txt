962537596080607233 2018-02-10 04:03:40 UTC <jeangiles64> I absolutely loved @PlanetTyrus's take on President's #parade IDEA! Tyrus described a YRLY celebration for military coming home. EVERY year. He wisely picked up on FACT @POTUS never suggested tanks etc. It's about genuine Love for those who sacrifice so much, even ALL. @Gutfeld
962522361927995392 2018-02-10 03:03:08 UTC <jeangiles64> #OpeningStatement  It's obvious the dogs that hate our President are out to hurt him, this time, by taking down General Kelly.  John Kelly is a GREAT man and the dogs need to CUT the crap! Media are blowing everything out of proportion and reporting non-facts as facts again.
961091542160216065 2018-02-06 04:17:34 UTC <jeangiles64> @ggreenwald exactly !  I don't believe the bots story.  Prove it to me.
961091148767952897 2018-02-06 04:16:00 UTC <jeangiles64> @JohnKStahlUSA He also looks like the little cowboy doll in Toy Story!
961090645745127426 2018-02-06 04:14:00 UTC <jeangiles64> #release the memo #releasethememo I looked this up to see if I could locate any of the so-called "bots" BUT I don't see any yet...just looks like a bunch of "human American citizens" that are sick of the swamp! Mainstream Media Sucks.
959560243268210688 2018-02-02 22:52:44 UTC <jeangiles64> @RepMattGaetz It's hard to believe ppl could still deny the glaring fact that it all leads back to the crooked and corrupt Clintons. This memo is shocking by itself, but also helps piece together other evidence.  Thank you Rep Gaetz and Devin Nunes for continuing to fight for the truth.
957806073955672064 2018-01-28 02:42:17 UTC <jeangiles64> @SenSchumer @PressSec Love you Sarah!  You are absolutely correct here - way to state the truth to Mr. Schumer!  You speak for MANY Americans too, and we thank you!
957126362157998081 2018-01-26 05:41:21 UTC <jeangiles64> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson After seeing that woman you spoke to tonight about DACA, my heart feels less charitable toward illegal immigrants, even DACA "kids".  This is OUR country and we do not OWE citizenship to anyone who illegally comes here.
957125187878707200 2018-01-26 05:36:41 UTC <jeangiles64> @TomFitton @PoliticalShort Need to get ALL their phones if not done yet!  When will the investigation begin to include McCabe and others?  And, #ReleasetheMemo Congress!
957124556430495747 2018-01-26 05:34:11 UTC <jeangiles64> @TomFitton What happened to draining the Swamp @jeffsessions ??  It is clear those running the FBI/ DOJ were working for Clinton (illegally)& are now obstructing justice themselves, as they hint at accusing our President @realDonaldTrump of doing so.  This MUST stop now! ~WeBelievedinYou
956710825087168512 2018-01-25 02:10:10 UTC <jeangiles64> @TuckerCarlson can we have the whole statement that you made during Tucker's thoughts?  I loved it and I do have it recorded -- but it would be easier if you could copy and paste it !  Thanks Tucker!!!  Great show and really meaningful words in Tucker's thoughts!
955562284205707264 2018-01-22 22:06:16 UTC <jeangiles64> @dbongino I could NOT believe he said that!!
955561824170147840 2018-01-22 22:04:27 UTC <jeangiles64> @realDonaldTrump @TomFitton Love you Tom Fitton--What would we do without you?
955561234627223552 2018-01-22 22:02:06 UTC <jeangiles64> @SenSchumer I noticed you forgot BORDER SECURITY!  Of course.  Wall!  End Chain Migration!  Start program based on merit!  END visa lottery!  Increase Border Security! No more "sanctuary cities"!  And, yes Protect Dreamers!
955559536303181824 2018-01-22 21:55:21 UTC <jeangiles64> Absolutely!!https://twitter.com/TomFitton/status/955546005344280578
955559344434810881 2018-01-22 21:54:35 UTC <jeangiles64> Hilarious---Fox News says "Releasing the memo could take up to 19 congressional working days... which puts its release around mid-March."  I was surprised 19 congressional working days didn't make it "mid-June" the way this Congress moves. Come on!  #RealeaseTheMemo
955502816319164416 2018-01-22 18:09:58 UTC <jeangiles64> @POTUS @WhiteHouse Thank you President Trump!  You are doing a Wonderful job!  Finally, looks like the Senate is going to try and do their job too!  Praying for a good turnout.  We must have Border Security, Wall, End Chain and Lottery to resolve DACA as well.
955495809390448640 2018-01-22 17:42:07 UTC <jeangiles64> #SchumerShutdown Im glad govt is opening again--so negotiations (that were already underway) can continue. & "YES, in Senate"-as if that isn't normal, @SenSchumer"...Then goes to the President. @POTUS Was trying in good faith-unlike you. O & Congrats on doing your jobs DDurbin!
955328810316165120 2018-01-21 06:38:32 UTC <jeangiles64> @EricTrump He is SO adorable!!!  God bless you guys!
955328642850152449 2018-01-21 06:37:52 UTC <jeangiles64> @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump Those who oppose any change to the filibuster rule, those who oppose the principle of majority rule, in reality are fearful that the peoples choices & wishes will be translated into action here in Washington. -Sen Tom Harkin in 2014. Chg rule-people want Trump agenda NOW!
955327583226384385 2018-01-21 06:33:39 UTC <jeangiles64> @JudgeJeanine @EricTrump @FoxNews Show dad! Those who oppose any change to the filibuster rule, those who oppose the principle of majority rule, in reality are fearful that the peoples choices and wishes will be translated into Action here in Washington.  -Senator Tom Harkin in 2014 Huffington Post online.
955326712111353857 2018-01-21 06:30:11 UTC <jeangiles64> @realDonaldTrump Those who oppose any change to the filibuster rule, those who oppose the principle of majority rule, in reality are fearful that the "Peoples Choices and Wishes will be translated into Action" here in Washington.  -Senator Tom Harkin, 2014, Huffington Post article.  TRUTH!
955321313538854914 2018-01-21 06:08:44 UTC <jeangiles64> @realDonaldTrump Keep fighting and Don't Let Them take advantage of you--Mr. President, you have the American people behind YOU!!  And, you are RIGHT about the "nuclear option". Supermajority makes slow and thoughtful progress, turn into NO progress AT ALL! Been going on since the 1970's, I read.
955319830235746309 2018-01-21 06:02:51 UTC <jeangiles64> @realDonaldTrump Seems you'll have to fight both Dems and some "so-called" Republicans to keep us safe and MAGA for our children & grandchildren! Senate rules (60 votes) & the "power of donors vs. citizens" are making your job almost impossible. Stay strong! We pray for you daily!
955317565894557696 2018-01-21 05:53:51 UTC <jeangiles64> @realDonaldTrump Yes we DO!!
955315273363525633 2018-01-21 05:44:44 UTC <jeangiles64> @realDonaldTrump It is so ridiculous how American citizens get played by the swamp!  I've been paying attention and watching their shenanigans on CSPAN.  They Know most citizens won't have time-and they'll be able to continue scamming and NOT doing what is in best interests of ordinary citizens.
955313535692787712 2018-01-21 05:37:50 UTC <jeangiles64> You are right @realDonaldTrump !  Republicans Majority is useless when it can't be used win some debates in legislating !
955313308793495557 2018-01-21 05:36:56 UTC <jeangiles64> @realDonaldTrump Should not NEED super majority.  Senate-Follow the Constitution!  In the Federalist Papers-Founding fathers explain why they only wanted simple majority.  They knew the supermajority would give more power to the minority-NOT what the people voted for!
955312110472441856 2018-01-21 05:32:10 UTC <jeangiles64> @realDonaldTrump There is no reason to have this super majority rule.  The constitution states only 5 specific situations in which it is needed.  This is causing the constant grid lock, which apparently, Congress enjoys (for some reason).
954596700684988416 2018-01-19 06:09:23 UTC <jeangiles64> The #SchumerShutdown, we'll call it!! Don't you love the way their LONG speeches never include all the facts? (The ones they hope we citizens won't know.)  Schumer can frame it any way he wants, but it's clear he & the Dems put #IllegalsOverAmericans, as always.
954594025390182400 2018-01-19 05:58:45 UTC <jeangiles64> @SenSchumer What--did I hear someone say --SchumerShutdown!
954593478557741057 2018-01-19 05:56:35 UTC <jeangiles64> @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer He thought the idiots would ALL work together and come up with a SERIOUS deal---duh!!!  You aren't fooling any of us Schumer.
954592446364692480 2018-01-19 05:52:29 UTC <jeangiles64> @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer Oh, please Schumer! The American Ppl know what is up--why no end to lottery& chain immigration? When DHS can ensure we won't end up in SAME situation 1, 2, 5 yrs from now, is when it makes sense to deal on DACA. Until then, stop using govt shutdown to win ONLY YOUR side of deal.
954588652855812101 2018-01-19 05:37:24 UTC <jeangiles64> @LindseyGrahamSC You are the reason this whole mess is happening this way.  You play for the other team while wearing our uniform.  So sick of your lying face.  You, Flake AND McCain!!
954246521012269056 2018-01-18 06:57:54 UTC <jeangiles64> #ReleaseTheMemo asap!
954239909077843968 2018-01-18 06:31:37 UTC <jeangiles64> #ReleaseTheDocuments as every American has the right to know the truth about this situation.  The only way for us to trust our government again is to shed light on ALL of this and hold cheaters and criminals accountable!
951057378430078976 2018-01-10 11:45:23 UTC <jeangiles64> @RepBrendanBoyle @seanodotcom Brendan Boyle is a complete ass...just trying to get attention.  There is NO "situation" as he explains--just crap invented by those who need another reason to try and get rid of our duly elected @POTUS ..  Buzz Off Boyle!
951052803472089088 2018-01-10 11:27:12 UTC <jeangiles64> @LindseyGrahamSC @TheView Those women are horrible!  And, you should apologize for what you said about President @POTUS Senator.  You know it is NOT true NOW, so SAY it loud and clear--a good man would not be ashamed to say it.
941542339956404225 2017-12-14 05:36:01 UTC <jeangiles64> @PressSec You are such a GOOD sport, Sarah!  You're a great example to my all women and our daughters!!  Merry Christmas!
941541943099699200 2017-12-14 05:34:26 UTC <jeangiles64> @PressSec American loves you Sarah!!
939684918589820929 2017-12-09 02:35:17 UTC <jeangiles64> @realDonaldTrump Great speech Mr. President!  We really needed to hear it too :-) Thank you!
