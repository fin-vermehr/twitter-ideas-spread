971143201338912769 2018-03-06 21:59:16 UTC <Yalinumberone> @HMSQnlz @USMarineCorps @Red_State_Rebel @UKinUSA Am I right in thinking it's under-powered or over-weight and is considered a 'lemon' by the US forces?
971059042880774144 2018-03-06 16:24:51 UTC <Yalinumberone> @PamelaGeller I think it's what you in the US call a 'nothing burger'. And having been taken for Jewish my whole life I wouldn't be offended one way or another. But remember you in the USA politicized the Olympics by allowing Black Panthers free reign.
971052553428525057 2018-03-06 15:59:04 UTC <Yalinumberone> @toryboypierce In their defense I doubt the local police would have been able to protect a Russian Double Agent from a Hit Squad from Russia or even from other Security Services!! Why did the British not give him a new identity and whatever? So many questions!
971010279373930496 2018-03-06 13:11:05 UTC <Yalinumberone> @toryboypierce Have our Security Services an unblemished record. I'm thinking of David Kelly and Hilda whatshername in Shropshire? Were they or weren't they.
971009822412955649 2018-03-06 13:09:16 UTC <Yalinumberone> @toryboypierce Perhaps we should have done the same with our traitors? Of perhaps we did?. Or could be False Flag to keep Russian hysteria alive.
971001534178832385 2018-03-06 12:36:20 UTC <Yalinumberone> @spikedonline Who was it that said he who controls the past, controls the present and he who controls the present controls the future or some such then went on to re-write history of the past. I know the reference is way off but I think I have got the sentiment about right.
970984684283981826 2018-03-06 11:29:23 UTC <Yalinumberone> @AMDWaters @patcondell Pat we need a new party like 5 Star led by a comedian. Trouble is there are so many comedians in Parliament (well I laugh at them) that it's difficult to choose the right one.
970694643594727424 2018-03-05 16:16:52 UTC <Yalinumberone> You couldn't make it up. But then again it's just par for the course for the delusional Loony Left. Come on Trump put the EU and Germany back in their place.https://twitter.com/MarcherLord1/status/970583561488228352
970650729722630144 2018-03-05 13:22:22 UTC <Yalinumberone> @RedHotSquirrel I love Italy. I may move there if we get sold out in the UK.
970370255670468609 2018-03-04 18:47:52 UTC <Yalinumberone> @Nigel_Farage What the hell has it got to do with Theresa May? She should be pleased. It will knock Germany sideways with more problems for German car manufacturers etc. and will distract the EU from bullying the UK. Come on Donald give the EU more problems.
970044234362474496 2018-03-03 21:12:22 UTC <Yalinumberone> @GWSR Lovely pair of buffers!
969940741001826304 2018-03-03 14:21:07 UTC <Yalinumberone> @SebGorka @EllaaaCruzzz Nice picture. Love the pistol. It looks like a Ruger custom but is it?
969939893437849601 2018-03-03 14:17:45 UTC <Yalinumberone> @PamelaGeller Are they frustrated and secretly want total male domination and all that goes with it? Is there any other explanation?

969672799978651648 2018-03-02 20:36:25 UTC <Yalinumberone> @Arron_banks More like slushpuppies.
969659309813649413 2018-03-02 19:42:49 UTC <Yalinumberone> @RedHotSquirrel If it was 8.4 million in 1950 it's not 10.7 million today!!  Growth of only 2.3 million in nearly 70 years!!!
969633796164390912 2018-03-02 18:01:26 UTC <Yalinumberone> @Arron_banks I don't watch or listen to the BBC anymore, especially QT, but can I assume that you won't be throwing in the towel anytime soon?
969609623471820800 2018-03-02 16:25:23 UTC <Yalinumberone> @toryboypierce Because he's delusional. If he wasn't and was forced to take and accept responsibility for his actions he would go mad. Isn't this sociopathic?
969608693154230273 2018-03-02 16:21:41 UTC <Yalinumberone> @MichelleDewbs Remember Orwell. All animals are equal but some are more equal than others! Intellectual snobbery leads to a common sense deficit. I'm sure they would like weighted voting rights based on academic achievement!!!
969572672618287104 2018-03-02 13:58:33 UTC <Yalinumberone> @realDonaldTrump Great pity the UK don't realise the importance of strategic industries . But then again in Politics easy come easy go. Take the money and run. Bugger the Country.
969532801564446720 2018-03-02 11:20:07 UTC <Yalinumberone> @thecarolemalone Because we're using Gas for Electricity generation instead of good old Coal. Thanks to the Greens and Climate Change Bedwetters.
969269977462263809 2018-03-01 17:55:45 UTC <Yalinumberone> @RedHotSquirrel You will have upset Red Ken by not including Adolf. Not a great Jazz enthusiast apparently, but Mussolini by all accounts was a real cool cat. Remember Communism comes in many guises.
969186103130542081 2018-03-01 12:22:28 UTC <Yalinumberone> @KTHopkins When you have no rational argument resort to an expletive filled rant. Must be a Lefty.
969151345314983936 2018-03-01 10:04:21 UTC <Yalinumberone> @afneil @spectator I think you mean outside Berlin.
969147281281900550 2018-03-01 09:48:12 UTC <Yalinumberone> @StefaanDeRynck @GuidoFawkes Oh Dear. Trouble in Paradise.
969144802280464384 2018-03-01 09:38:21 UTC <Yalinumberone> @benhill_DM @KTHopkins That's rather nice of them! Will the white people get some warning when 'not for now' becomes 'now'. Not that I'm an expert but it seems 'the tyrant goes, long live the new tyrant' pretty much sums up Africa.
968923824367468544 2018-02-28 19:00:16 UTC <Yalinumberone> @toryboypierce His time in office was stained  by many things including Curry
968905854262104064 2018-02-28 17:48:51 UTC <Yalinumberone> @RedHotSquirrel Perhaps it's like the 'Stockholm Syndrome' that they welcome certainty in their lives even at the expense of freedom and real democracy. I am making a serious comment here, not just being sarcastic or whatever. What do you think?
968903613417443330 2018-02-28 17:39:57 UTC <Yalinumberone> @JunkScience He needs a spine but as you can't grow one better to put a rod up his arse or replace him with someone with balls and a spine. It's now a year or more and he's still fannying around! Get on with it!!!
968896873825218566 2018-02-28 17:13:10 UTC <Yalinumberone> @AnnCoulter Ann, I'm guessing it's not what I think it is which sounds quite interesting!
968776375405547520 2018-02-28 09:14:21 UTC <Yalinumberone> @frankfieldteam Fantasists is a very generous description of them. Other far less generous descriptions come to mind!

968604588138991616 2018-02-27 21:51:44 UTC <Yalinumberone> @spikedonline A tad cynical but right on the button. Do people like him not realize that they are becoming caricatures and parodies of themselves.
968526715202007040 2018-02-27 16:42:17 UTC <Yalinumberone> @NadineDorries If you repeat a lie often enough and loudly enough.......
968449249489891328 2018-02-27 11:34:28 UTC <Yalinumberone> @LeahRBoss I'm OK with the second sentence and the Tuesday thing. Just saying.
968448014447759361 2018-02-27 11:29:34 UTC <Yalinumberone> How true! Not to mention the Computer Games that make the most gory of violence seem commonplace.https://twitter.com/LiberalTyranny/status/968223343303364608

967820348556238849 2018-02-25 17:55:26 UTC <Yalinumberone> @LiamFox @Arron_banks That about sums it up. The door is unlocked but they are afraid to push it open. Our politicians have become institutionalized by the EU. As have many of our business leaders. They are like long term prisoners, afraid of the big wide world.
967818538244243457 2018-02-25 17:48:15 UTC <Yalinumberone> @Digbylj He will borrow it. Borrow it I tell you. And if they won't lend to him, the Banks will give it to him and he will give them a small consideration when hell freezes over in never never land.
967724599831121920 2018-02-25 11:34:58 UTC <Yalinumberone> @afneil Here's a question for you. Where did the money go that was lost in the Crash? The Banks lost money and had to be saved by governments but it didn't just disappear. Someone made enormous profit.
967722516318957570 2018-02-25 11:26:41 UTC <Yalinumberone> @Arron_banks Dopey is a good nickname for Lammy.
967395479020605445 2018-02-24 13:47:10 UTC <Yalinumberone> @spikedonline Absolutely right.
967118983718727680 2018-02-23 19:28:28 UTC <Yalinumberone> @toryboypierce If they bugger off we should clip their wings.
967117868897898504 2018-02-23 19:24:02 UTC <Yalinumberone> @DanielJHannan I feel Jean-Claude could be a modern day Spencer Percival should he become PM.
967087579081318400 2018-02-23 17:23:41 UTC <Yalinumberone> @afneil Surely you know Terry Christian. Middle name 'BLUDDY' often said loudly in a fake northern accent? He's a very well know political pundit.
967017714865922048 2018-02-23 12:46:04 UTC <Yalinumberone> @Arron_banks It says they (the Cons) want to loose the next GE for the 'greater good', i.e. remaining in the EU. It seems the 'ends justifies the means' is their and Labs mutual creed. So with no choice what do we do Arron? We need a new Party!! (not UKIP).
966709471069310977 2018-02-22 16:21:13 UTC <Yalinumberone> @Digbylj Careful M'Lord when he gains power and nationalizes the railways we'll all be cattletrucked whether we're Jewish or not!
966697808194605058 2018-02-22 15:34:52 UTC <Yalinumberone> @afneil Estimated?!?! Strange it's gone down! Or has it really? Perhaps to fulfill the Brexodus prediction? This figure is about as accurate as Project Fear's economic forecast.
966401635353178112 2018-02-21 19:57:59 UTC <Yalinumberone> @afneil That is a very superficial argument. If it's legitimate to compare gun ownership in Britain and America then why not with Switzerland? The problems are societal and cultural and for the most part fairly recent (last 30 years or so). Wonder what caused the change?
965958783838154752 2018-02-20 14:38:15 UTC <Yalinumberone> @_SierraWhiskee @Tejas_Marine What a virtue signalling arsehole. To be honest someone as childish as him shouldn't have a gun. Prat.
965954008119742464 2018-02-20 14:19:16 UTC <Yalinumberone> @Alaskans4Trump @minnman47 I'm afraid you are using a rational argument with idiots. They 'know what they know' and you will never change that however much to try to rationalize the debate.
965504646704975872 2018-02-19 08:33:40 UTC <Yalinumberone> @GuidoFawkes ...just a very naughty boy.
965269336956067840 2018-02-18 16:58:38 UTC <Yalinumberone> @RedHotSquirrel @EuroGuido Well I got it.
965255441314873344 2018-02-18 16:03:25 UTC <Yalinumberone> @rickygervais @Protect_Wldlife Was it shot legally or illegally? If legally then perhaps you should explain the circumstances before before appealing to touchy/feely westerners who eat meat killed far less humanely.
965215744610000896 2018-02-18 13:25:41 UTC <Yalinumberone> @GaetaSusan @thebradfordfile You're bloody right there.

963078951668211712 2018-02-12 15:54:49 UTC <Yalinumberone> @RitaPanahi @Emmyjewel I would have used 'twice' twice rather than 'two times' which is grammatically correct but rather clumsy.
963034289146335232 2018-02-12 12:57:21 UTC <Yalinumberone> @Red_State_Rebel Should be 'too tense' but always good.

960837633114034176 2018-02-06 11:28:37 UTC <Yalinumberone> @OSemperfive Be very careful if you've had chilli oil in the Chinese restaurant as well. From personal experience.
958364673665110016 2018-01-30 15:41:58 UTC <Yalinumberone> @KateHoeyMP @WestmonsterUK Perhaps the person that leaked this should be sacked or even in jail. Do they not sign the official secrets act when dealing with such politically and nationally sensitive information as this. In times of War they would at the very least be in jail.
958284021120864258 2018-01-30 10:21:29 UTC <Yalinumberone> @PeteDurnell @JuliaHB1 Could they be the same ones that failed to spot the 2008 financial crisis? Even though all the warning signs were there.

955807714936016896 2018-01-23 14:21:31 UTC <Yalinumberone> @WestmonsterUK There can't be any handguns in the UK apart from Police Military and Vets. They were all confiscated in 1997!!!!!!
955789423819612160 2018-01-23 13:08:51 UTC <Yalinumberone> @georgegalloway More like Fraser in Dad's Army. We're all doomed. BTW Vladimir Putin ate my hamster.

951841853166575616 2018-01-12 15:42:36 UTC <Yalinumberone> @TheRightScoop If they wren't shitholes why would they want to migrate to the West. Problem is they bring their shit and shit mindset with them.
951834760522977280 2018-01-12 15:14:25 UTC <Yalinumberone> @GuidoFawkes Have you been to Leicester? Labour have turned it into a shithole.
951788384439226369 2018-01-12 12:10:08 UTC <Yalinumberone> @Arron_banks So what's stopping you? Or don't you have the balls?

947848581095948288 2018-01-01 15:14:46 UTC <Yalinumberone> @bsgirl2u So Bill's going to triple every donation. I find that hard to swallow (or is that what Monica said).
947772649257734145 2018-01-01 10:13:03 UTC <Yalinumberone> @RedHotSquirrel I can think of one word that fits all. But my new year's resolution is not to blaspheme.
946778308385148928 2017-12-29 16:21:53 UTC <Yalinumberone> @GWSR I just love 37s. Beauty and power and elegance in a diesel locomotive.

946768756767944707 2017-12-29 15:43:56 UTC <Yalinumberone> @PeteDurnell George is so right.
946765210324520960 2017-12-29 15:29:50 UTC <Yalinumberone> @afneil I day, I day, I day, did you hear the one about the scotchman and the comminist....
946437158797180928 2017-12-28 17:46:17 UTC <Yalinumberone> @RedHotSquirrel You're bloody right there. But who, and what, and when? I think there are people in this country just desperately waiting for new political thinking and new ideas. But the Establishment is so entrenched we will probably die waiting.
946369698610008065 2017-12-28 13:18:13 UTC <Yalinumberone> @Visita_Madrid @bhx_official @iberiaexpress In Madrid and Barcelona watch out for groups of teenage girls especially if they jostle you. You will be robbed! They are bolder and more blatant away from the crowds and you will be attacked. I was robbed and my wife attacked for her handbag.

944243050301345793 2017-12-22 16:27:41 UTC <Yalinumberone> @SaharahShae @PhilCollinsFeed Do you really think I want to start the New Year off listening to bloody Phil bloody Collins? It;s a bit like being alive in your coffin at your own bloody funeral. Enough to make you croak!

942806799727714306 2017-12-18 17:20:32 UTC <Yalinumberone> @AIIAmericanGirI Sounds a bit like 'swords to ploughshares'. Nothing original from the Left. They must constantly leave their brains in Neutral.
942784350772490240 2017-12-18 15:51:19 UTC <Yalinumberone> @frankfieldteam @CommonsWorkPen Strokes beard (actually bit of stubble) and wonders when Modern Slavery became a big issue in the UK. Could it be around 1997? Wonder what happened then? Mass immigration comes to mind. I do love our cultural diversity and what it has brought.
942781769564217344 2017-12-18 15:41:04 UTC <Yalinumberone> @SaharahShae Not your best photo! You've let yourself go a tad. Must have been a very heavy Christmas party at work.
942404301976227840 2017-12-17 14:41:09 UTC <Yalinumberone> @spikedonline Perhaps the comfortable happy columnists in London and New York are anti-semitic.  Wouldn't be the first time.
942102841157738496 2017-12-16 18:43:15 UTC <Yalinumberone> @forduk Position of handbrake is a bit weird for RHD?
941701645968211968 2017-12-15 16:09:03 UTC <Yalinumberone> @AIIAmericanGirI Surgeons and Consultants are GODS and can do whatever they want. Complete silence from everyone that knew, and there were many. Our NHS is normally beyond the Law and too big to fail. I think this got out because one patient had a second Op and it was spotted! Disgrace.
941259563273211904 2017-12-14 10:52:22 UTC <Yalinumberone> @LeaveEUOfficial The most sickening moment was Grieve trying to justify himself for rebelling. A bit like I only gave the D-Day plans once to our enemy.
940543837541462021 2017-12-12 11:28:19 UTC <Yalinumberone> @JuliaHB1 @wallaceme Just love the 'timer' comment.

940225887743741952 2017-12-11 14:24:54 UTC <Yalinumberone> @toryboypierce When I was 6 years old and the bus didn't make it up the hill, we with older kids would walk 3 miles to School and 3 miles back again through snowdrifts. No wonder we have a Snowflake generation now that can't cope with anything and need safe spaces.
940162813661712386 2017-12-11 10:14:16 UTC <Yalinumberone> @royaldeaf @DeafTrust @KTHopkins Katie, I like your thinking.
939436388117897216 2017-12-09 10:07:43 UTC <Yalinumberone> @SaharahShae I didn't want to start a road rage war. To 'pull off' means something else where I live. But I guess that you still need two hands on the levers to steer them, that was the point of my attempted humourous aside which obviously fell flat.
939234449484632064 2017-12-08 20:45:17 UTC <Yalinumberone> @SaharahShae Do they often pull off while they're driving? I'm sure it's possible but I try and keep both hands on the wheel. Just saying.
939093808414851073 2017-12-08 11:26:26 UTC <Yalinumberone> @SaharahShae You know my answer because you can read my mind.

936225162948677633 2017-11-30 13:27:27 UTC <Yalinumberone> @PrisonPlanet I'm suspect that the 230K is just a guesstimate anyway and is probably much higher. And that's only the 'legals'. What about the 'illegals'. Let's settle on about 500K net.  That feels about right. After all politicians have an incentive to depress immigration figures.
936219924992876545 2017-11-30 13:06:38 UTC <Yalinumberone> Pat is absolutely correct.https://twitter.com/patcondell/status/936195268839604224

930096986371579904 2017-11-13 15:36:16 UTC <Yalinumberone> @talkRADIO @thequentinletts I read and re-read. I might send copies to my Remainer 'friends' for Winterval. That's sure to piss them off. Very enjoyable I leave my copy lieing around to work them up.
930094646990196736 2017-11-13 15:26:58 UTC <Yalinumberone> @patcondell It won't be long before Bonio does something similar when he's finished counting his money in the Caymans.
927497690732290048 2017-11-06 11:27:36 UTC <Yalinumberone> @IsabelOakeshott I thought the same but could not have put it more concisely or articulately.
926130585566838784 2017-11-02 16:55:12 UTC <Yalinumberone> @EuroGuido It's only 3 Turkeys. They'll probably be eaten by the New Year.

922097854960881664 2017-10-22 13:50:35 UTC <Yalinumberone> @ClimateRealists @tan123 It's because they are idiots incapable of rational thought and forensic examination of the 'pseudo science' being peddled by fools.

919278811837075461 2017-10-14 19:08:42 UTC <Yalinumberone> @dbongino Of course Iran didn't. Either Obama didn't understand the psychology of the Middle East which was stupid or he did which was much worse!!!

918503067972177920 2017-10-12 15:46:11 UTC <Yalinumberone> @VickiMcKenna I agree. And you have certainly got the style I like.

918495810979065857 2017-10-12 15:17:20 UTC <Yalinumberone> @TomiLahren I said that to the wife only yesterday when we still talking. Then again every cloud has a silver lining.

918199509955555329 2017-10-11 19:39:57 UTC <Yalinumberone> @AIIAmericanGirI He's right. Laziness and complacency are commonplace in British industry.
918170599545016321 2017-10-11 17:45:04 UTC <Yalinumberone> @BreitbartNews Is Hollywood eating itself? I bloody well hope so!.
918164083752538113 2017-10-11 17:19:10 UTC <Yalinumberone> @KTHopkins @RealWednesdayy It takes something to keep Tucker quiet and not let him get a word in edgeways. I guess  he met his match, in a nice way.
918158861718212613 2017-10-11 16:58:25 UTC <Yalinumberone> @LeahRBoss You're on Instagram? I must check it out. Thanks.
918147431660969984 2017-10-11 16:13:00 UTC <Yalinumberone> @RedHotSquirrel @MakeItBritish Bet the @FT did it through gritted teeth. I wouldn't like to be the Tea Boy there he'll be getting his arse kicked to Kingdom Come.
918146508087840768 2017-10-11 16:09:20 UTC <Yalinumberone> @SaharahShae Before Trump's victory, I thought we in the UK had a monopoly on left wing loonies. But in USA you always do everything bigger and better!
918079965379334145 2017-10-11 11:44:55 UTC <Yalinumberone> @LeaveEUOfficial If No Deal were the outcome he wants the UK to be so unprepared that we rush back to the EU. Traitor.
918051562546696192 2017-10-11 09:52:03 UTC <Yalinumberone> @WestmonsterUK If they admit to 1M+ then true figure probably 2M+.
917825878230470657 2017-10-10 18:55:16 UTC <Yalinumberone> @PrisonPlanet Guilty by association? You may say so but I couldn't possibly comment.
917779047874289664 2017-10-10 15:49:11 UTC <Yalinumberone> @afneil @SpectatorMoney Mr Neil. Who's behind this in USA? Has Trump been outflanked? Attempt split DUP/Torys derail BREXIT? Nasty smell about whole thing & timing.
917774626922614785 2017-10-10 15:31:37 UTC <Yalinumberone> @loubgray @afneil @Spectator_LIFE Not that I disagree with this, but you can always tell the upper classes from the wannabee middles. A side-by-side tells all!
917706626265681920 2017-10-10 11:01:24 UTC <Yalinumberone> @toryboypierce Strangely my first thought. Not only 3 million EU. Millions more under Blair's mass immigration. But blame the old.  They can't fight back.
917693868560277504 2017-10-10 10:10:42 UTC <Yalinumberone> @PrisonPlanet @ColumbiaBugle Those students certainly aren't starving. When I was a student your choices were rent, drink and food in that order.
917692792180273152 2017-10-10 10:06:26 UTC <Yalinumberone> Is that Harvey with Bill? Perhaps they swapped stories and tactics afterwards! https://twitter.com/AdamBaldwin/status/917598026025246720
917395482145705984 2017-10-09 14:25:01 UTC <Yalinumberone> @AIIAmericanGirI He's got a home out in the US. Next time he comes can you keep him. We don't want him back. Please. Please.

915955945502658560 2017-10-05 15:04:49 UTC <Yalinumberone> @GigiTracyXO Kellyanne a great a role model for women and everyone. The other a role model for Sociopaths? One may say that, I couldn't possibly comment!

915864789435416576 2017-10-05 09:02:36 UTC <Yalinumberone> @GigiTracyXO CCTV, Hotel Security, House Keeping. Nothing reported. And this from Las Vegas where 'cheating' in the Casino can be spotted a mile away.

915254494933512192 2017-10-03 16:37:30 UTC <Yalinumberone> @AIIAmericanGirI If you were a cynic you might have thought that they hoped for this. The strange thing is the whole thing doesn't add up. Almost incredible.

914844602385027073 2017-10-02 13:28:44 UTC <Yalinumberone> @JuliaHB1 @AlbertoNardelli Close association: Guernica. No condemnation of brutality by Spanish Police! Germany must have known this was going to happen. So condoned.

914838144901578752 2017-10-02 13:03:05 UTC <Yalinumberone> @JuliaHB1 @MisssPatrice Reminds me of Apartheid South African police action against protesters. Except in Catalonia it was against the elderly and peaceful voters.
914824601443676160 2017-10-02 12:09:16 UTC <Yalinumberone> @RitaPanahi @BabyAnimalPics Don't get it wet or feed it after midnight. We all know what happens.

914586353161162753 2017-10-01 20:22:33 UTC <Yalinumberone> @BorisJohnson So that's why you turn a blind eye to Fascism. Words fail me to describe what I think about you. Grow a pair.
914585343768358913 2017-10-01 20:18:32 UTC <Yalinumberone> @RedHotSquirrel Rule of law upheld!! Boris should be ashamed of himself. It was Fascism nothing more nothing less. Well now we know where Johnson stands.
914584204872241152 2017-10-01 20:14:01 UTC <Yalinumberone> @SaharahShae I'm guessing that you're talking about driving your car and not what I was dreaming! 7.2 miles - that's a very long ride.
914571027396665344 2017-10-01 19:21:39 UTC <Yalinumberone> @svrbridgnorth @svrofficialsite @JamieRicketts_ Great photo. And great Autumn colours.
914561670185410561 2017-10-01 18:44:28 UTC <Yalinumberone> @BrendanChilton Police brutality! This is Fascism. Fascism. Not the Police going a bit over the top against protesters. Fascism. Get used to it. This is EU.
914552359572951040 2017-10-01 18:07:28 UTC <Yalinumberone> @PrisonPlanet @BreakingNLive Remember. The End always justifies the Means. Nothing changes with communists, socialists, liberals, or whatever name they choose. All same

914545689828511745 2017-10-01 17:40:58 UTC <Yalinumberone> @JuliaHB1 @kezdugdale Is that it? It's Fascism. Fascism. Do you not get it. It's not a minor breach of electoral etiquette. What a mealy mouthed condemnation.

914468206416449536 2017-10-01 12:33:05 UTC <Yalinumberone> @GigiTracyXO @DineshDSouza Absolutely right. Well said. However much the Left may wish otherwise Fascism is the exclusive preserve of the Left.
914467576998133761 2017-10-01 12:30:34 UTC <Yalinumberone> My thoughts exactly.https://twitter.com/Jane0brien/status/914459719489642503
914465724625817606 2017-10-01 12:23:13 UTC <Yalinumberone> @PrisonPlanet I would have said chilling. Because it represents the attitude of the media and probably politicians towards democracy and freedom.

914451766351220736 2017-10-01 11:27:45 UTC <Yalinumberone> @JunckerEU @JuliaHB1 Because Juncker and his ilk are behind this. This is their Europe.

913466521715924997 2017-09-28 18:12:44 UTC <Yalinumberone> @PeteDurnell The trouble is we have seen the EU of tomorrow and are horrified. The EU of today is bad enough.

910849483885498368 2017-09-21 12:53:34 UTC <Yalinumberone> @SaharahShae @JVC341 I saw the Vulcan at Throckmorton reprising the Falklands bombing run. Something I will never forget. A fantastic aircraft. Sorely missed.

905742010543374340 2017-09-07 10:38:17 UTC <Yalinumberone> @EuroGuido I've taken an oath of Soubriety. So far it's working pretty well....oops sorry
905512483007451140 2017-09-06 19:26:14 UTC <Yalinumberone> Typical of Michael Caine. He always 'blows the bloody doors off'.https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/905505742375063553
904616504922177536 2017-09-04 08:05:56 UTC <Yalinumberone> @georgegalloway @Arron_banks @WestmonsterUK He's right.

903921464490983424 2017-09-02 10:04:05 UTC <Yalinumberone> @KTHopkins Bloody right Katie.
903627458892713985 2017-09-01 14:35:49 UTC <Yalinumberone> @LeahRBoss Piers Morgan is an arsehole. Despite his relationship with Trump, he is still a loud mouthed opportunist. Definitely no Tucker!
903301405745795075 2017-08-31 17:00:12 UTC <Yalinumberone> @LBC @Nigel_Farage I'm all for it Nige.
902861929626128384 2017-08-30 11:53:53 UTC <Yalinumberone> @alanfriedmanit @JuliaHB1 @talkRADIO Did Trump show support for Texas? Compared to Obama and Bush's behaviour in similar circumstances. Are you just another sneering Metro?
902854009639272448 2017-08-30 11:22:24 UTC <Yalinumberone> @IngrahamAngle Bloody hell. That black dog must have been bursting!!
902841228072542209 2017-08-30 10:31:37 UTC <Yalinumberone> @SaharahShae I wish you'd cut them. These scratches are painful......and then I woke up and it was only a dream.
902804805181202433 2017-08-30 08:06:53 UTC <Yalinumberone> @SaharahShae And then we marry them.
902236537496240128 2017-08-28 18:28:47 UTC <Yalinumberone> @GaiaFawkes I think that they want to totally eliminate CO2 in the atmosphere. Do they not realise what will happen below 200ppm ????? Idiots.
902234233527300096 2017-08-28 18:19:38 UTC <Yalinumberone> @BearingArmsCom @VickiMcKenna Beta males make good targets. For debate of course! Nothing else.
902144552554962945 2017-08-28 12:23:17 UTC <Yalinumberone> @PamelaGeller Quelle surprise!
902144277152714752 2017-08-28 12:22:11 UTC <Yalinumberone> @PamelaGeller You're bloody right there.
901865030106394626 2017-08-27 17:52:33 UTC <Yalinumberone> @SaharahShae @recipe It's fantastic. But last time I ate this stuff I put on 2 stone in 3 weeks. Not so good for us Brits  like me who have no willpower.
901863319249846273 2017-08-27 17:45:45 UTC <Yalinumberone> I think that Steven King is morphing into Pennywise.https://twitter.com/BreitbartNews/status/901844973313773569

900374022830948352 2017-08-23 15:07:49 UTC <Yalinumberone> @NadineDorries So do you agree with Naz Shah and think the rape victims of grooming gangs should shut up? YES or NO. Not complicated.
900373072057847808 2017-08-23 15:04:03 UTC <Yalinumberone> @brijoyce I think that you just insulted me. If you did why prevent me replying? If not I apologise.
900331241320452098 2017-08-23 12:17:49 UTC <Yalinumberone> @KTHopkins @NadineDorries @brijoyce It's the 'kind of say that'.  Why be ambiguous? The English language is not difficult.
900329179429969920 2017-08-23 12:09:38 UTC <Yalinumberone> @KTHopkins @NadineDorries So Nadine you agree with Naz Shah? If so why don't you say unequivocally?
899660018223632384 2017-08-21 15:50:37 UTC <Yalinumberone> @LeahRBoss Am getting the wrong end of the stick, or should there be a space rocket somewhere in the picture?
898818593663717377 2017-08-19 08:07:06 UTC <Yalinumberone> @SaharahShae I'll have one from the top shelf.
898241156231856128 2017-08-17 17:52:34 UTC <Yalinumberone> @SaharahShae You seem to have a firm but gentle grip.............I'm sure that you won't let any spill.
897451807709904896 2017-08-15 13:35:59 UTC <Yalinumberone> @SaharahShae What is it? And you've done such a good job of selling Kentucky to me. Now I'm not so sure.
896783182594539520 2017-08-13 17:19:06 UTC <Yalinumberone> @GigiTracyXO We definitely are two countries separated by a common language. Bugger me, but I suppose I'll work this out eventually. Perhaps I need beer.
896781790232424448 2017-08-13 17:13:34 UTC <Yalinumberone> Wish I'd been there. Great photo.https://twitter.com/eastlancsrly/status/896748185196142597

896678439855558656 2017-08-13 10:22:54 UTC <Yalinumberone> @frankfieldteam When time comes and Tory remainers like Soubry try to sabotage BREXIT will you, Kate and other Labour leavers support Government or what?

892007902449467392 2017-07-31 13:03:51 UTC <Yalinumberone> @frankfieldteam They are not interested in negotiating. It's not incompetence it's deliberate.

868498730294669316 2017-05-27 16:06:47 UTC <Yalinumberone> @GodfreyElfwick You should really challenge Morgan on this, he is equating the Crusades et alia 100's years ago to the Manchester bombing.
868497684356837378 2017-05-27 16:02:38 UTC <Yalinumberone> @GigiTracyXO That was the scariest ride ever on the 'wrong' side of the road. Good job nothing was coming the other way.
867840844367134720 2017-05-25 20:32:35 UTC <Yalinumberone> @piersmorgan Having read this thread, there is obviously a good case for raising the voting age to 25+. I've always suspected the under 30's were stupid.
867834359679668229 2017-05-25 20:06:49 UTC <Yalinumberone> @POTUS @Protrump45 @maga_taylor I'm definitely someone that approves of you, now that you are most certainly prouder and prouder! But I was before anyway.

867428751449239552 2017-05-24 17:15:05 UTC <Yalinumberone> @SaharahShae You sound a lot like a soul mate.
866990837334495232 2017-05-23 12:14:58 UTC <Yalinumberone> @SaharahShae That's a pretty well worn .45 Smith. I have better .357 with a 12 inch barrel that is only occasionally used! Ready and cocked for you.
866985564591054853 2017-05-23 11:54:01 UTC <Yalinumberone> @SaharahShae I'd love to see the stuff you don't post. Chris. xxx

865256509822914560 2017-05-18 17:23:22 UTC <Yalinumberone> @Txwench You're absolutely right. Same here in UK. The Left are delusional.

860186170277449734 2017-05-04 17:35:39 UTC <Yalinumberone> @piersmorgan Piers, did you complain publicly about Obama interfering in the EU Referendum? If you did I must have missed it!!
859314826434183168 2017-05-02 07:53:14 UTC <Yalinumberone> @RedHotSquirrel @Carra2509 A picture paints a thousand words.

854676045148106753 2017-04-19 12:40:22 UTC <Yalinumberone> @KTHopkins Good riddance. Especially to Osborne.
854348700960915456 2017-04-18 14:59:37 UTC <Yalinumberone> @RedHotSquirrel @DavidCockerham Designate it a 'Coup'. You have the moral high ground to organize protests, Strikes and Demos (i.e. Riots). My prediction. Maybe wrong.

853968963847557122 2017-04-17 13:50:41 UTC <Yalinumberone> @PamelaGeller Erdogan is NOT the new Ataturk. Ataturk was a great man and is still revered by many Turks. God knows what the Turks expect from Erdogan.

852822630432260096 2017-04-14 09:55:34 UTC <Yalinumberone> So sad. I spent many years in Turkey and I love the people and the country. Ataturk's legacy is being destroyed. I fear for their future.https://twitter.com/openDemocracy/status/852819676023341056

847835713492176898 2017-03-31 15:39:20 UTC <Yalinumberone> @WestmonsterUK @Michael_Heaver Don't you realise, it's old people that created the unprecedented demand! Not to mention depriving young people of houses by not dieing

844624720087695361 2017-03-22 19:00:00 UTC <Yalinumberone> @Arron_banks @JuliaHB1 Bloody right.
844609130547625984 2017-03-22 17:58:03 UTC <Yalinumberone> @Arron_banks @Janice4Brexit Effing spot on.
844188659700158464 2017-03-21 14:07:15 UTC <Yalinumberone> @eastlancsrly Beautiful Loco.
844155095885500416 2017-03-21 11:53:53 UTC <Yalinumberone> @RitaPanahi @BrittPettibone Fantastic I love it. The same could be said for the UK

841287008303624192 2017-03-13 13:57:07 UTC <Yalinumberone> @VickiMcKenna Nothing to do with me as I'm in England, but seems like a nice building that could be a beautiful hotel.
838089813203042305 2017-03-04 18:12:37 UTC <Yalinumberone> @GigiTracyXO Definitely Red especially with those denims.
831207578742956036 2017-02-13 18:25:04 UTC <Yalinumberone> @PrisonPlanet It's actually pretty good on first hearing, so very pleased I bought it. She was very courageous to do what she did.
