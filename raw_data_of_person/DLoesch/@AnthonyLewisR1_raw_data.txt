971412394701357062 2018-03-07 15:48:57 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @BetoORourke @krassenstein @SamPrice54 Im actually a Democrat who changed parties to vote for trump   Im sick and tired of the left playing identity politics
971412036415520768 2018-03-07 15:47:32 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @BetoORourke @krassenstein @SamPrice54 Thats why yall keep on losing. instead of logically brining people to yalls side and way of thinking, yall call people racist.   Well my deplorable racist ass will give yall, Hollywood and all of the left the middle finger and vote for trump again in 2020.
971394668670971905 2018-03-07 14:38:31 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @nytimes @vandusen_cheryl @Marcus_Dekker Trump has give me hope again.  We want 1960s America   We want America to be great again
971394099990401024 2018-03-07 14:36:15 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> No Muslims refuges, no illegal immigrants, no more bullshit trade deals and no more selling of America to other countries.   MAGA all day everyday
971393873762312193 2018-03-07 14:35:21 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @nytimes @Marcus_Dekker @vandusen_cheryl And if it wasnt for McCain obama care would be gone and people could get real healthcare again.
971393680656433154 2018-03-07 14:34:35 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @nytimes @Marcus_Dekker @vandusen_cheryl My biggest issues going into 2016 were the Muslim refuges, illegal immigration, military spending and tax cuts for businesses.   Trump has delivered in spades, easily the best president that we have ever had.
971393234344775686 2018-03-07 14:32:49 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @nytimes @Marcus_Dekker @vandusen_cheryl Absolutely, there is a reason why trump won. And its to end globalism and the death of America. We will not let the liberals not the rhino republicans have control anymore
971392933441232896 2018-03-07 14:31:37 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @nytimes @Marcus_Dekker Absolutely not, spending money on that is a waste of money. If you live in poverty then its youre own fault. Get a job and stop being lazy.
971392613730439168 2018-03-07 14:30:21 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @nytimes @Marcus_Dekker @vandusen_cheryl Climate change isnt real, its a hoax and a waste of money. Thank god that trump took us out of the Paris climate agreement.   And you can thank our healthcare mess on obama and the democrats.   Healthcare was fine before they destroyed it.
971392181419282432 2018-03-07 14:28:38 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @nytimes @Marcus_Dekker The government shouldnt be taking care of anyone. We should cut every agency by 50% and lower taxes even more.   The government is the Enemy and not youre friend
971391894977617920 2018-03-07 14:27:30 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @nytimes @Marcus_Dekker Because without America there is no earth to live on. Other countries like China or Russia would inslave you.  Cut welfare, entitlement programs, EPA and healthcare and put that money into the military.  Cut everything from the government
971390365151481856 2018-03-07 14:21:25 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @nytimes @Marcus_Dekker Trump is the best candidate that Ive ever seen. I cant wait to vote for him again
971390258444144640 2018-03-07 14:20:59 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @nytimes @Marcus_Dekker I dont believe in gun control, abortions and I believe that global warming is a hoax and that there is only 2 genders. I want America to dominate other countries again because we are the best in the world and everyone else sucks compared to us.
971389817857683458 2018-03-07 14:19:14 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @nytimes @Marcus_Dekker On a serious note, Ill explain why I vote republican instead of democrat.   3 of the biggest issues in this country is the economy, military and immigration.   I want tax cuts for business, I want a wall and I want to spend a unlimited amount of money on the military.
971388203088384000 2018-03-07 14:12:49 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @nytimes @Marcus_Dekker Because we love America
971378012519325698 2018-03-07 13:32:20 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @DevinNunes @foxnewsnight @AdamLaxalt @FoxNews @keatonc33 Why I want the republicans to play dirty right back and end this all.   I want trump to fire muller and sessions
971377881992646656 2018-03-07 13:31:49 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @DevinNunes @foxnewsnight @AdamLaxalt @FoxNews @keatonc33 So even if the fbi finds stuff on trump what about all of the democratic stuff ?
971377755026808834 2018-03-07 13:31:18 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @DevinNunes @foxnewsnight @AdamLaxalt @FoxNews @keatonc33 Then you have FBI agents taking about insurance policies to take trump out and then they go after flyn and other people but let Clinton staff people off the hook.
971377530799316993 2018-03-07 13:30:25 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @DevinNunes @foxnewsnight @AdamLaxalt @FoxNews @keatonc33 Probably, witch is wrong but at the same time I just want this all to end.  The democrats rigged the election and stole it from Bernie Sanders and then spent 12 million dollars on Russia intel on trump for slander purposes and to gain a spying Warrant in a court to spy on trump
971376774943854592 2018-03-07 13:27:25 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @ThatShianne Another piss poor game, keep it up and no playoffs.

971138209810927618 2018-03-06 21:39:26 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @POTUS @FoxNews @anajade18 He has said this from day one, Russia and maybe others meddled and trolled on Facebook. But he didnt cheat and get help from them
971137873792643074 2018-03-06 21:38:06 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @POTUS @FoxNews @anajade18 Russia has been doing this for centuries and other countries do also.  This is a witch hunt, the only investigation is into Hilarys emails and the FBI corruption
970835691033722881 2018-03-05 01:37:20 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @keatonc33 I do feel bad for him, he wasnt even a real part of the trump team and now he has to get lawyers and deal with this stupid crap.   No way I could afford it, I would just opened the fifth and get locked up for a year or 2 until the investigation is over.
970656454389780480 2018-03-05 13:45:07 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @realDonaldTrump Thank you for keeping youre promises sir   The Deplorables stand besides you !

969611565367427074 2018-03-02 16:33:06 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @realDonaldTrump   7. Put smoke/fog dispensers on the ceilings of the school. When an active shooter is present a switch can be turned on making the hallways and classrooms filled with fog/smoke so the shooter cant see anyone.
969611489186377728 2018-03-02 16:32:48 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @realDonaldTrump   6. Create a veterans for kids program where vets can get jobs to protect the kids at schools.
969611360911978496 2018-03-02 16:32:17 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @realDonaldTrump   5. Anyone who lies or creates false info for the sole purpose to take away someones right to own a gun is automatically finned $100k and is sentenced to 15 years in prison this would make sure that Drs, politicians and people are held accountable.
969611096729554944 2018-03-02 16:31:14 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @realDonaldTrump   4. Get rid of gun free zones, if someone has a concealed carry permit and they want to bring it somewhere then they should be able to. This includes school teachers.
969610922250637312 2018-03-02 16:30:33 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @realDonaldTrump   3. Raise the age to buy rifles to the age of 21, kids who enter the military at age 18 are exempt from this law and can purchase at age 18 instead of 21.
969610798095110144 2018-03-02 16:30:03 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @realDonaldTrump   Even if 3 Drs say that he is mentally unstable but 1 Dr says that he is in perfect mental health then the subject will get his guns back. Doing it this way would make sure that corrupt Drs couldnt take away anyones guns.
969610610643296256 2018-03-02 16:29:18 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @realDonaldTrump   .... If the judge agrees then the cops can confiscate the persons weapons temporarily until a full mental evaluation is given to the subject. The subject gets to pick whatever Dr that he/she pleases to disprove the court And ...
969610383274250240 2018-03-02 16:28:24 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @realDonaldTrump   2. Create and implement gun warrants. If a family member, friend or anyone who thinks that someone is unstable and shouldnt own a gun, they can go to court and present their proof/case as to why they think this person is dangerous......
969609982839787520 2018-03-02 16:26:49 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> My 7 step plan for gun reform @realDonaldTrump   1. Make a app for phones where school kids can anonymously snitch on people who they think might cause violence.

969360791269990406 2018-03-01 23:56:37 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @FoxNews @StephenFBatres I really think that the deep state are going to make a phone inditement and take out trump and his family.   The question that I have is whats going to happen after that ?    Not going to say but you can read between the lines lol

968943950563196928 2018-02-28 20:20:14 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @POTUS @FoxNews @keatonc33 Yup, trump is a old school democrat. There is allot of stuff that I dont like about trump but immigration was my biggest issue and that was trumps main thing. I want a wall man
968943390405509121 2018-02-28 20:18:01 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @POTUS @FoxNews @keatonc33 Im getting worried. Bump stocks and maybe a ar15. I was always worried that trump would do this
968860732325445632 2018-02-28 14:49:33 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @realDonaldTrump Everyday that he is still in power is another wasted day of youre presidency. We need the swamp locked up and it aint happening Under sessions

968848916639760385 2018-02-28 14:02:36 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> #ThingsICantAccept is a federal government who is so big and powerful that they destroy the country and everyones lives for their own personal gain.   Enough is enough
968848609734115328 2018-02-28 14:01:23 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Honestly regular people just need to start running for office for like a term or two and then just quit and go back to living youre life.   Its the only way that we are going to be able to take our country back.  #ThingsICantAccept
968845950545358855 2018-02-28 13:50:49 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Sometimes I do feel like Im a little extrema/radical when it come to my hatred of the federal government.   But at the same time Americans worship god, not the government.  The feds have grown to big and are too powerful in todays age.
968844358593142784 2018-02-28 13:44:30 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> America was not built by government regulations and restrictions. It was built by people who just got the job done.   This country has gone to shit, cant wait for the day that we default on our debt and everything is shutdown.

968832708569841664 2018-02-28 12:58:12 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Ive officially added California to my no go list for work while trucking.   So many rules and regulations + the only thing that they do is steal youre money.
968594738658988032 2018-02-27 21:12:35 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @LydiaSparrow1 Never mind about destroying his confidence. Him and Dickinson should have been traded period
968594583234822144 2018-02-27 21:11:58 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @SportsSturm @seanshapiro @keith_uscier Exactly, the stars dont have a damn good forward prospect.
968542670330019841 2018-02-27 17:45:41 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @StarsInsideEdge Honka wont play for the rest of the year
968542597344980992 2018-02-27 17:45:24 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @StarsInsideEdge Stupid
968521333083594752 2018-02-27 16:20:54 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @RealAlexJones I got banned for life on Facebook because Im a trump supporter. I would love to come on youre show and talk about my story
968502099729264640 2018-02-27 15:04:29 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @SportsSturm @seanshapiro Honka+Dickinson+pick for patches would be enough. Montreal needs to move patches and patches would be a perfect fit for the stars + we have the trade pieces to do it.
968501130132013056 2018-02-27 15:00:37 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @SportsSturm @seanshapiro Honestly they need to just play Dickinson as the secound line center and role with him but hitch wont do that. Same with Honka
968500774140444672 2018-02-27 14:59:13 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @SportsSturm @seanshapiro I guess if you believe that those are high quality prospects, I personally dont believe that they will be anything special. Nuke is our best hope honestly.   I would package Honaka and Dickinson for a very nice winger or second line center. Patches from Montreal would be good
968499771135569921 2018-02-27 14:55:13 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> American exceptionalism is nothing to ever apologize for. Feeling so blessed today & every day to be able to live in the greatest nation on earth!
968497541619712000 2018-02-27 14:46:22 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @GoodJobsNation Youre fake news and propaganda.
968497274018971651 2018-02-27 14:45:18 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @SportsSturm @seanshapiro A secound round pick for Kane isnt overpaying. The prices were low.   We have zero good top 6 potential prospects coming up and the team is getting older. Need to make a move for a top six winger period.
968474297499971586 2018-02-27 13:14:00 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Its time to fire Jeff sessions   Dude aint doing a damn thing
968451151308795904 2018-02-27 11:42:02 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> As Winnie The Pooh Says  "How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard".
968112507968606208 2018-02-26 13:16:23 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Trumps America is the kinda America  that I want my kids to grow up in.
968109060951228422 2018-02-26 13:02:41 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> When government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
968023805561012224 2018-02-25 07:23:54 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> ... and think about the people that you love like family, friends and what this country means to you.   Rekindle that light that the government blew out.   #Believe
968022507415629824 2018-02-25 07:18:45 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Anything is possible, but the government tries to make you believe otherwise because they fear you. they fear the spirit, the fear the will and they fear the fight that every American is born with.   Starting right now, right this second. I want you to stop what youre doing ....
967968691362123776 2018-02-25 03:44:54 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> The dems dont care about the DACA people. They use them for political gain and pawns. Trump is offering up a very fair deal. Take it and be happy
967968449099116544 2018-02-25 03:43:56 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Its funny how trump is going to be the savior to the illegals.
967967592559374336 2018-02-25 03:40:32 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Sums it up perfectlypic.twitter.com/HUqbS6uu3v
967967323859582976 2018-02-25 03:39:28 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Does anyone use their brains anymore ?????
967967120972828674 2018-02-25 03:38:40 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Turns out that 4 cops were outside the school building and refused to go in and confront the shooter and waited for swat instead.   Disgraceful cowards.   No accountability and passing the blame onto others. Both the FBI and this sheriff dropped the ball and let those kids die.
967964065908842496 2018-02-25 03:26:31 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Four police officers stood their and Let those kids die. This isnt about guns, this about people not doing their damn jobs
967843655238213632 2018-02-25 19:28:03 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @cnnbrk @winsonmkhan @Lightningricky I absolutely am, he is giving me back the powers that the government stole from me before. MAGA 2020 !
967730055504949248 2018-02-25 11:56:39 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @cnnbrk @winsonmkhan Hopefully we wont need to give yall some freedom in the next 50 years.
967729904975515649 2018-02-25 11:56:03 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @cnnbrk @winsonmkhan Absolutely
967728905309343744 2018-02-25 11:52:05 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Whats crazy is that I just watched a movie and learned a valuable life lesson ....... just wow
967674467211268096 2018-02-25 08:15:46 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @DonaldTrump_Is @LauraJeanSings Thats why he won. Reagan was the best president ever and trump aint disappointing
967587894390030336 2018-02-24 02:31:45 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @krassenstein I donated to the NRA today
966890890898808835 2018-02-22 04:22:07 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @TSNBobMcKenzie Im hearing Nash to the stars. Will be announced after the Kings/stars game tonight. Is this true bob ?
966889422871347202 2018-02-22 04:16:17 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @StarsInsideEdge I would like to see a power play set up of ....   Johns-seguin    Klingberg-faska-radulov   I know is weird, especially klingberg on winger.
966886400858583042 2018-02-22 04:04:16 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @StarsInsideEdge You hear anything about Nash to the stars ?      Im hearing that a deal will be announced after the game
966767378213335040 2018-02-22 20:11:19 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @DonaldTrump_Is @FlachTarah Absolute not, who gets to decide who is mentally unstable or not ?  Because Im a trump supporter does that make me unstable ?   What if I take pills to help me sleep ?   You cannot give the government to ban people from guns
966760908289605633 2018-02-22 19:45:36 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @CaidenCowger I would rather die then to give up my guns. You liberals want to take them ?  Then you will have to kill me
966730813646819333 2018-02-22 17:46:01 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @washingtonpost No, because they are fake moments. CNN caught red handed once again !
966527911539986433 2018-02-21 04:19:45 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @AnnCoulter @MarkSKrikorian Absolutely the most important thing possible. We need to deport the illegals and also reduce legal migration also.
965753840678199296 2018-02-19 01:03:53 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> I dont even believe that the clintons are at the top. They defiantly have a seat at the table. But I believe that there are a few higher ranking People
965753589124730880 2018-02-19 01:02:53 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Over the past year members of the deep state have been exposed   Lindsey Gram Jon McCain  Paul Ryan  Mitch McConnell  James Comey  James Clapper  AndyMcCabe  Robert Muller    But these arent the CEOs  We must figure out who is calling the shots.
965752487784468480 2018-02-19 00:58:30 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Former CIA director clapper in my opinion is one step below upper management in the deep state.  1. Clapper  2.comey  3.mcabe   Then in management you have   1. Muller  Who are the rest of them though ?   Where do the clintons fall into place ?    Who are the big 3 bosses ?
965750865951952902 2018-02-19 00:52:03 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> How big is the deep state and who are the leaders ?!?!? 
965750187170910214 2018-02-19 00:49:22 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> The FBI has lost all credibility and their name is tarnished for life.
965749773935501313 2018-02-19 00:47:43 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> The truth is, this doesnt end after 7 more years. Trump and the American people have declared war on the deep state. This war is going to last 30/40 years and the outcome will determine if America stands or falls
965749376260952064 2018-02-19 00:46:08 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> When you have the FBI trying to take out a duly elected president and making insurance policies you knows things are getting serious.
965749095431393280 2018-02-19 00:45:01 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Trump is fighting them all. people might not like the way he talks or acts but there is no denying that he cant be bought or bribed. He will do whatever he wants. The deep state cant control him and thats why they want him gone
965748655151075328 2018-02-19 00:43:16 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> The deep state has been working to destroy America for a long time. They control/bribe our elected officials, judges and news agencies....
965748277936304129 2018-02-19 00:41:46 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> The only way America would ever collapse is if its betrayed from the inside. No outside power could ever destroy America
965748066568626176 2018-02-19 00:40:56 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Most people just wake up and enjoy their day while being in a little bubble without looking at the big picture and whats going on in our country. Huge things are taking place and some of them are extremely scary.
965747566402048001 2018-02-19 00:38:57 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Some people living in the states dont even realize whats happening right now. The deep state is exposed and there is a war going on.
965471979573784578 2018-02-18 06:23:52 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @realDonaldTrump I love you mr president

965404420778446848 2018-02-18 01:55:24 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @StarsInsideEdge To be fair it wasnt really bishops fault, nore the teams. The sharks just capitalized on every single chance they had. Believe it or not they could still come back

965403211539632129 2018-02-18 01:50:36 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @StarsInsideEdge Janmark-faska-radulov needs to be a line right now.
965391698837819392 2018-02-18 01:04:51 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Liberals want someone theyve been calling Hitler all year to take away their guns.   This kind of logic is why we need to lock up Tide pods in our stores...
965366815781203968 2018-02-18 23:25:59 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @krassenstein @connie_rodeconn @John_Rhode Everyone knows that the polls are fake and that the fbi, Democratic and Republican Party is all apart of the deep state. Trump is taking our country back and we will stand with him. MAGA !
965364227862155264 2018-02-18 23:15:42 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @realDonaldTrump @krassenstein Yall are a bunch of 
965363383083175936 2018-02-18 23:12:20 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @krassenstein Honestly Brian, you are mentally unstable and you need to get help. Youre hatred for trump and consistent crying can complaining is not normal. One day you just might snap and lose it all. People like you shouldnt be able to own a gun.
965362286998294530 2018-02-18 23:07:59 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @krassenstein @John_Rhode @connie_rodeconn There is no way that Brian should be able to own a gun. He is mentally unstable and completely unhinged in reality.
965362100209111040 2018-02-18 23:07:14 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @krassenstein @John_Rhode @connie_rodeconn People want to talk about mental health, right here is a fantastic start.
965361871783112705 2018-02-18 23:06:20 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @krassenstein @John_Rhode @connie_rodeconn Its true though, the left doesnt even know what gender they are. These people are completely unhinged. Screaming at the sky and crying 24/7.
965355331328139269 2018-02-18 22:40:21 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @krassenstein @John_Rhode It has nothing to do with trump. The left is acting like mentally ill lunatics because they hate trump so much. Trump is going to be around until 2024
965304117961940992 2018-02-18 19:16:50 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @frank_seravalli @NHLBlackhawks So ?  Who cares ?  Unless youre a snowflake !
964896057334337537 2018-02-17 16:15:21 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @SamsPressShop @SpeakerRyan Youre apart of the deep state. Us deplorable Americans know whats going on and yall wont win.
964800818141650946 2018-02-17 09:56:54 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @piersmorgan @MikeD_OrBigO @andrewmcopson More guns are the answer, not less.
964800674319011840 2018-02-17 09:56:20 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @piersmorgan @MikeD_OrBigO @andrewmcopson Its extremely easy to fix these issues but people would rather play politics. Arm the teachers and hire vets to protect the schools.
964780582906617857 2018-02-17 08:36:30 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @piersmorgan @andrewmcopson @MikeD_OrBigO It wouldnt happen because Americans would fight back. The day we lose our guns is the day we lose our freedom.
964562223438835712 2018-02-16 18:08:49 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @piersmorgan @MikeD_OrBigO @andrewmcopson Those arent rights but privileges. You arent entitled to have a phone but you are entitled to gun
964521071704653824 2018-02-16 15:25:18 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @FoxNews @lekh27 @79_leobardo Have 2 armed vets and have some of the teachers conceal carry
964520794758963200 2018-02-16 15:24:12 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @FoxNews @lekh27 @79_leobardo What if we paid veterans, 2 at each school for security? It would create jobs and also secure our schools. What do you think ?
964507076952145923 2018-02-16 14:29:41 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @piersmorgan @iiSalad The government is the enemy of the people. Again, this is why we voted for trump. To put Americans first and to limit the government
964505461859827712 2018-02-16 14:23:16 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @piersmorgan @MikeD_OrBigO @iiSalad Its why we elected trump, American values are relevant and they are the only things that matter. All that I need is my bible and my guns !
964505010871582720 2018-02-16 14:21:28 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @piersmorgan @MikeD_OrBigO @iiSalad We will not let the globalists and the deep state destroy America. We must always be armed and ready to strike back and defend our country.
964504616548253703 2018-02-16 14:19:54 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @piersmorgan @MikeD_OrBigO @iiSalad Tell that to the corrupt FBI who needs to make insurance policies and take out a duly elected president. Its extremely relevant         Any type of gun laws are unconstitutional period
964503621831294976 2018-02-16 14:15:57 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @cnni Who cares
964502985517641728 2018-02-16 14:13:26 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @piersmorgan @MikeD_OrBigO There is and will never be no plan because many people including myself would rather die then give up our god given rights
964502668059160576 2018-02-16 14:12:10 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @piersmorgan @RobJCollins65 This is fake news
964502229678895104 2018-02-16 14:10:25 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @piersmorgan I rather die fighting for freedom then live on my knees. We will never give up our guns and if the government tried to take them then the second revolution would start.
964498595830423552 2018-02-16 13:55:59 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Per the constitution everyone has the god given right to own a gun. Yes, even mentally ill people.
964498069612933120 2018-02-16 13:53:53 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @FoxNews @lekh27 @79_leobardo Plus constitutionally it clearly says that everyone has a right to bear armes. Even mentally unstable people have that right.
964497493290438656 2018-02-16 13:51:36 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @FoxNews @lekh27 @79_leobardo The truth is anything in life can happen in a blink of an eye. I rather be prepared then unprepared. I even keep a window breaker in my car just Incase if I ever get into a accident and fall in a lake lol
964496033882374145 2018-02-16 13:45:48 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @NoAltitude The kid told classmates last year that he was going to shoot up the school but no one listened.
964495761315475461 2018-02-16 13:44:43 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @NoAltitude I absolutely agree with all of that for sure
964495595049136128 2018-02-16 13:44:03 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @FoxNews @lekh27 @79_leobardo Thankfully I never had to use it. I was mature and responsible and not even my best friend New about it.
964493238609391616 2018-02-16 13:34:42 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @NoAltitude You cant stop 100% of everything in life but you can limit them from happening. Gun free zones dont work. When was the last time a gun store was robbed ?
964488747562618881 2018-02-16 13:16:51 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @ShaunKing I need a AR-15 to protect myself from the deep state and my own government
964487335197855744 2018-02-16 13:11:14 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @GriffJenkins @FoxFriendsFirst @POTUS @FoxNews @ThillGlenna Im also saving 2,000 in taxes a year and just got a 5,000 pay raise because of tax cuts
964484636561752064 2018-02-16 13:00:31 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @FoxNews @lekh27 @79_leobardo I illegally conceal carried a gun back when I was in high school 15 to graduation. No politician is going to tell me how and how not to protect myself.
964483738695430146 2018-02-16 12:56:57 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @FoxNews @lekh27 @79_leobardo We should let the teachers conceal carry and start local programs were vets can get security jobs protecting the schools. We need more guns, not less guns.
964481564288598019 2018-02-16 12:48:18 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @GriffJenkins @FoxFriendsFirst @POTUS @FoxNews @ThillGlenna Not at all, its time to deport the illegals !    MAGA 2020
964480445307002880 2018-02-16 12:43:51 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @SithKulu Im so sorry to hear that, urge youre school  board to let teachers conceal carry in the classroom. Some schools in Texas the teachers are armed. It makes things safer
964479415013879809 2018-02-16 12:39:46 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @NoAltitude Here is a teacher saying that its stupid how she cant carry a gun in the classroom. I agree with herpic.twitter.com/XIrBB6FLii
964479003514908677 2018-02-16 12:38:08 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @cnnbrk To bad that he didnt have a gun to protect himself and the kids.
964478767061069824 2018-02-16 12:37:11 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @NoAltitude  A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
964477999448903681 2018-02-16 12:34:08 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @NoAltitude To stop a mass shooter you call the police, the police use guns. Dont wait for the police while people are getting shot and dying. We need to arm the teachers period
964476904517468161 2018-02-16 12:29:47 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @NoAltitude Negative, you cant give the government the power to control who can and who cannot have a gun. They will abuse their power. I say arm the teachers and hire a few cops to gourd the schools.
964176468623351808 2018-02-15 16:35:58 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @krassenstein @chaddiedabaddie If the teachers had guns then it would have stopped it. We need more guns not less guns
963311966059225088 2018-02-12 07:20:44 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @WSJ Absolutely not, Im a truck driver who delivers amazon packages all the time. Amazon would have to create their own fleet of truckers. Each trucker makes 75,000 a year. Amazon is to cheap to pay their employees that good

962878838056288256 2018-02-11 02:39:39 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> I am convinced:  Donald Trump was put on this Earth for this exact moment in time for this exact reason. No one else could withstand these attacks & come out on top.  God chose him, the people elected him & history will write about him.  Pray for DT in this battle of GOOD vs EVIL

962548897934659584 2018-02-10 04:48:35 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @beckypicha Just like how I wouldnt call a woman to fix my car. Women are better at thinking and solving problems and men are more of the kind of people to just do it without thinking
962548096650612736 2018-02-10 04:45:24 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @beckypicha Men and women are better at other things then the other. Its not sexist, its reality.

941014150313951232 2017-12-13 18:37:11 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> We need a special prosecutor to investigate if Doug Jones colluded with Russia to hack the election in Alabama. #WednesdayWisdom
941013887079424000 2017-12-13 18:36:08 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @SteveBannen @Johnnyskydive00 This is a fake account lol
941000859772641280 2017-12-13 17:44:22 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @SebGorka @WalshFreedom I did this to a Muslim in California yesterday lol
940976056802074624 2017-12-13 16:05:49 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @STL_Blonde @dialogueforusa People say thats its fantasy and cant happen but I dont want to give up on our country. I still believe that we can save it without a violent revolution. Its going to take 20+ years. Trump made everyone believe that its possible. Its all about believing
940975359603781632 2017-12-13 16:03:02 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @STL_Blonde @dialogueforusa I get what youre saying but the ultimate goal of the MAGA base is to elect people who cant be bought or bribed and puts America first. The ultimate end game is to elect enough outsiders to sign into law term limits. We need term limits in Congress
940951774793310209 2017-12-13 14:29:19 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @STL_Blonde @dialogueforusa Yes, it was fake news about Roy Moore. Roy Moore is one of the best candidates that i can think of and is full MAGA. I will never vote for a establishment candidate and of the Republican Party puts one in in 2020 then a dem will win again
940951050319622149 2017-12-13 14:26:27 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @STL_Blonde Wrong, us Deplorables will never vote for a establishment candidate. Screw the Republican Party. Moore was one of the best candidates that I could ever think of. I will not vote in next election and hope that the dems win
940950435849945090 2017-12-13 14:24:00 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> You should sue,its disgusting what the Republican Party did to you. You should run again in 2 years to give the establishment the finger. Many of us will continue to vote for you even if we lose just to tell the establishment to go screw
940844164278865920 2017-12-12 07:21:43 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @jack @DRUDGE_REPORT @LubnaArikat Anyway Im off to bed, Im a truck driver and I have a long day tomorrow. I would love to discuss more topics with you tomorrow if thats cool with you. Have a goodnight. 
940843675449511937 2017-12-12 07:19:46 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @jack @DRUDGE_REPORT @LubnaArikat I think that is reasonable in my opinion
940843537914105856 2017-12-12 07:19:14 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @jack @DRUDGE_REPORT @LubnaArikat Like apple, if they wanna keep on making phones in China then they can pay a 50% tax ..... if they want a tax break then they have to move the factories back into America and hire only Americans
940842881782296577 2017-12-12 07:16:37 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @jack @DRUDGE_REPORT @LubnaArikat What if we put a tariff in place that any company who builds and hires out of the country pays a 50% tax ?  So that if they want a 15% rate they have to hire and build in America so that the people can benefit also ?
940842384916733954 2017-12-12 07:14:39 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @jack @DRUDGE_REPORT @LubnaArikat We can both admit that there is a ton of waste, Im sure that if we spent our money right then things could work
940842040375603206 2017-12-12 07:13:17 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @jack @DRUDGE_REPORT @LubnaArikat Most of the things that you mentioned can be handled locally at a privet/state by state level. Even at 15% we would have around 1.5 trillion to play with
940841023189766144 2017-12-12 07:09:14 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @jack @DRUDGE_REPORT @LubnaArikat Would you be okay with something like that ?!?!?
940840907670282240 2017-12-12 07:08:47 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @jack @DRUDGE_REPORT @LubnaArikat I said a flat 15% for everyone without deductions ect. A tax bill that is once page. Literally 15%, you cant deduct or do anything. No credits and no bull crap. A flat 15%
940840515301511168 2017-12-12 07:07:13 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @jack @DRUDGE_REPORT @LubnaArikat I said a flat 15% for everyone without deductions ect. A tax bill that is once page. Literally 15%, you cant deduct or do anything. No credits and no bull crap. A flat 15%
940839767524200448 2017-12-12 07:04:15 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @jack @DRUDGE_REPORT @LubnaArikat I dont want individual up to 39%, I said 15% for everyone man. You shouldnt be punished for being successful. 15% for everyone and cut spending to everything except our military
940839294536699904 2017-12-12 07:02:22 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @jack @DRUDGE_REPORT @LubnaArikat It would actually be cool to have a real debate without being called a racist or some Russia lover
940839034464735232 2017-12-12 07:01:20 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @jack @DRUDGE_REPORT @LubnaArikat I believe in small government but a huge military, thats why I said cut everything except the military. Its the military who kills ISIS and not the stupid government swamp people.
940838750699089920 2017-12-12 07:00:12 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @jack @DRUDGE_REPORT @LubnaArikat Im honestly trying to have a discussion with you. Why are you so angry ? Jesuss man
940838431118249984 2017-12-12 06:58:56 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @jack @DRUDGE_REPORT @LubnaArikat I want a flat tax rate of 15% for everyone including corporations, everyone gets 15% with no deductions or anything like that. Cut spending on healthcare and entitlement programs and cut everything else by 20% except the military.
940838026623799296 2017-12-12 06:57:20 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @jack @DRUDGE_REPORT @LubnaArikat Its not true man, obviously Im pissed off that the middle class isnt getting a bigger tax break but Im also pissed off that the corporate rate isnt 15%. This is the republican swamp tax plan and not trumps, trump is just going along because of the corporate tax rate
940836954551267329 2017-12-12 06:53:04 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @jack @DRUDGE_REPORT @LubnaArikat Its a good thing for yall on the left though, with the Republican Party being split then its a easy win for the dems. I just cant and wont vote for the swamp. I hate the government and want it destroyed like the rest of my MAGA voters
940836396801187841 2017-12-12 06:50:51 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @jack @DRUDGE_REPORT @LubnaArikat Even with trumps support Luther Strange got smacked, that should tell you something.
940836250923216904 2017-12-12 06:50:16 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @jack @DRUDGE_REPORT @LubnaArikat Im not a bot, and neither are the deplorable party. We HATE the Republican Party with the passion. We want populism and America first. We refuse to vote democratic but we will never vote for a Republican establishment candidate. Its why Luther Strange lost.
940818165499559938 2017-12-12 05:38:24 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @DushanMandic Its fake news, no proof.
940817608500240384 2017-12-12 05:36:12 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @CaidenCowger Moore is what MAGA is all about, I cant even think of another candidate like him. Maybe if sheriff jo runs in Arizona. I just disagree, the dems will just smear every candidate now as a pedo.
940816813562179584 2017-12-12 05:33:02 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Black people always hurting themselves. You cannot succeed in life if you are treated like a second class citizen and are told that everyone is out to get you. The republicans love you, its the Democrats that want to enslave you.pic.twitter.com/0EZL04zHLc
940816097401597953 2017-12-12 05:30:11 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @CaidenCowger I disagree, the MAGA movement will not vote for the establishment candidate. Its why Luther Strange lost. The Republican Party is split up into 2 parties and not enough people to win. Dems will win in 2020
940815424329076736 2017-12-12 05:27:31 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @CaidenCowger the MAGA voters will not vote for the establishment candidate but the cucks will only support the establishment candidate.   This means Democratic wins 24/7 for local elections.
940812056860733441 2017-12-12 05:14:08 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @SebGorka Its a sad day for our country
940810449905487872 2017-12-12 05:07:45 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> The MAGA movement is passionate but unorganized. For us to win this war we must come together and get organized.
940810159080828929 2017-12-12 05:06:35 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Also it wasnt the Democrats who attacked Roy Moore, it was the swamp in the Republican Party. The republicans wanted to lose this seat to hurt the trump agenda.
940808182619918336 2017-12-12 04:58:44 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Everyone in the MAGA movement must rebel and refuse to vote for establishment republicans. Even if we lose then whatever. Give the republicans the middle finger !
940804814002368512 2017-12-12 04:45:21 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> This was my fear from the start, we have the Democrats, Republicans and the third party witch is the MAGA party ....... this gives the Democrats the win everytime
940804152434753542 2017-12-12 04:42:43 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> People who say that Alabama will turn back to republicans in 2020 have no idea what they are talking about. The MAGA revolution refuses to back establishment candidates. Its why Luther Strange lost. Alabama is now a Democratic state for the long term
940803615308083200 2017-12-12 04:40:35 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @benshapiro @realDavidFeiner I cant believe Alabama did this
940803111307837441 2017-12-12 04:38:35 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @benshapiro @realDavidFeiner Im in shock and disgusted right now
940801932091887617 2017-12-12 04:33:54 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> The people of Alabama just destroyed the trump agenda and the rest of the country. We do not have the votes now to do anything. How could yall do this ?
940801168061665280 2017-12-12 04:30:52 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @FoxNews @whatAworld1234 @realRobertDobbs No it wont, I will never vote for a establishment republican. They were apart of this fake news smear against Moore. I will give them the finger in next election and not even show up.
940799266817236993 2017-12-12 04:23:19 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @emily_maines I kinda thought something along the lines of that lol

940796554675400704 2017-12-12 04:12:32 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Im so disgusted with Alabama voters, a bunch of spineless cowards
940793468250677248 2017-12-12 04:00:16 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Screw Alabama, disgusting excuse for a state.
940710114419294208 2017-12-12 22:29:03 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Imagine if George W Bush had ordered the FBI to spy on Barack Obama and plant phony evidence that there were tapes of him with hookers in Kenya and FoxNews spent a year claiming it was all true. Thats where were at
940688722281897984 2017-12-12 21:04:03 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @krassenstein @taranico2 Its the truth, these women know exactly what they are doing. Its how life is. All about sex, money and power !
940688296035753985 2017-12-12 21:02:21 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Men want to have a career and make good money to attract pretty women to have sex with, women put themselves in situations to find a man to take care of them financially and they do this by getting up close and personal to were the man looses control. Its life, deal with it!
940687652172394496 2017-12-12 20:59:48 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> @krassenstein @taranico2 I would tell her to drop to her knees and guess what ?  She will drop to her knees because Im rich

940686220375441408 2017-12-12 20:54:06 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> When men have money, they have power. Men can do whatever they want to women, because women like it and allow it to happen because women want the mans money and power.
940685780963307520 2017-12-12 20:52:21 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Trump talks and acts like a normal American male...one of the reasons I like him.https://twitter.com/realsaavedra/status/940657846244474881

939122145032011776 2017-12-08 13:19:02 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> Business owners and the rich deserve to pay little to nothing in taxes. They are the job creators and they are the reason why you pay you're bills. Instead of hating them, you should be thanking them.

939109566691921921 2017-12-08 12:29:03 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> What people don't understand is that the trump presidency isn't just a presidency, it's a peaceful revolution to take our country back.......

938635775846969344 2017-12-06 05:06:22 UTC <AnthonyLewisR1> After trump wins in 2020 then Roy more will win in 2024. It's over for the establishment
