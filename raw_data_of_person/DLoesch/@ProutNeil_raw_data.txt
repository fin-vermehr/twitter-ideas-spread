955522597885751298 2018-01-22 19:28:34 UTC <ProutNeil> @ThierryHenry @piersmorgan Couldnt agree more
938766594234339329 2017-12-07 13:46:12 UTC <ProutNeil> @HeraldPAFC Should have not spent so much time in the bookmakers and would have some money to fall back on!
928026852115009536 2017-11-07 22:30:18 UTC <ProutNeil> @PlymouthHerald This is really sad to hear, very jolly and always cooked great locally sourced food. My condolences to his wife

915208803188187136 2017-10-03 13:35:57 UTC <ProutNeil> @BBCNews @VictoriaLIVE I think it is unrealistic to compare stats from the uk to USA as there is a massive difference in population

907486645020225536 2017-09-11 06:10:51 UTC <ProutNeil> @HeraldPAFC What a load of rubbish, moaning at creating jobs
902028015714148354 2017-08-27 04:40:12 UTC <ProutNeil> Same problems happen every season, anyone else would have been sacked years ago, transfers take so long and still nothing happens #WengerOUT
902026505508835328 2017-08-27 04:34:12 UTC <ProutNeil> What a shambles #Arsenal football club are! Board, manager and players. #WengerOUT

887639604639215616 2017-07-19 11:45:47 UTC <ProutNeil> @AsadBalal You are the most miserable, pessimistic person on twitter. Why I am following you I don't know.
883227781135466497 2017-07-07 07:34:47 UTC <ProutNeil> @jenslehmann @LacaMadness @NickVann1987 What a great keeper and character

792018330857136128 2016-10-28 15:00:59 UTC <ProutNeil> @TomSleeman11 you're a prick. What about the driver of bus. How does he feel!?
762222971113054208 2016-08-07 09:44:52 UTC <ProutNeil> @LGandWoolwell I'm annoyed by your booking policy. You have 0 weekend availability, if I call in the A.M I cannot get an P.M appointment.
757973965411323906 2016-07-26 16:20:50 UTC <ProutNeil> @piersmorgan spot on
709041425866989568 2016-03-13 15:40:23 UTC <ProutNeil> Time to f**k off Wenger. Thank you for all you've done over the years but enough is a enough
