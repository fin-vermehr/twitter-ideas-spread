968870176291770368 2018-02-28 15:27:05 UTC <d_oswald> @saltinesfosuppa The exact same opportunity, no. It's going to take more drive and more work, obviously, but it's not luck. It's all about the individual and their drive to succeed. The preconception that being born into poverty means you're always going to be there is what needs to change.
968864749311098880 2018-02-28 15:05:31 UTC <d_oswald> @saltinesfosuppa False. Everyone has the ability to make the best of whatever situation they may be in and to get out of it if less than ideal. We need to stop this belief that we are all responsible for the actions of others.

967945041573490689 2018-02-25 02:10:56 UTC <d_oswald> @stephenfishbach FAA administrator requires Senate approval, so they would be the hiring committee. I would also expect the counter-argument that it's Republican controlled so there's a good chance that happens lol but I would also hope they wouldn't actually approve someone who is unqualified.
967941088785911809 2018-02-25 01:55:13 UTC <d_oswald> @stephenfishbach The article states he's on the list because he's Trump's pilot, but if he gets the job it won't be because he's Trump's pilot. If he's qualified then so be it. We all use our connections as an "in" to get an interview where we can, this isn't any different.

937691701027713024 2017-12-04 14:34:57 UTC <d_oswald> @DougLesmerises I'm listening to @BuckeyeTalkPod  I don't think ppl are calling for Haskins out of underappreciation for what JT has done 4 us, but what he hasn't done. No one is saying he's not tough and doesn't love the program, we've just seen too many bad/missed throws lately
937690376512696320 2017-12-04 14:29:41 UTC <d_oswald> And bring @AriWasserman in for a few here and there... haha looks like you guys are more popular than you thought!https://twitter.com/DougLesmerises/status/937664231708790784
937436289393152001 2017-12-03 21:40:02 UTC <d_oswald> That seemed to be a really dumb call on 4th and 1. But it is the #Browns so I guess it meets expectations.
937423604387581952 2017-12-03 20:49:38 UTC <d_oswald> I need a Fournette TD and a McCown to Anderson TD pass... Alex Smith is killing me...
937395921914122242 2017-12-03 18:59:38 UTC <d_oswald> I'm no Skip Bayless fan but I agree with him on this. #AnyoneButBamahttps://twitter.com/RealSkipBayless/status/937376116771139584

937385791168409601 2017-12-03 18:19:23 UTC <d_oswald> @reynolds_31 @MFlinner But OSU did have quality wins last year. That was the difference.

937377716864679944 2017-12-03 17:47:17 UTC <d_oswald> @DerekDraper33 Waiting patiently for the new QB era to roll in...
937189332330471425 2017-12-02 05:18:43 UTC <d_oswald> @KevinKaduk Even you have to admit Ohio State almost gave that game away to the Badgers. Not so much that Wisconsin *almost* won on their own.
937188621458780161 2017-12-02 05:15:54 UTC <d_oswald> @LuckyNumberSl7 All hail Coach Schiano in C-Bus tonight.
937184206869942272 2017-12-02 04:58:21 UTC <d_oswald> Can't help but wonder what this team would look like with Haskins at QB
937183902925500418 2017-12-02 04:57:09 UTC <d_oswald> @NickCaminoWTAM I don't like this but know it to be true
937181866167324672 2017-12-02 04:49:03 UTC <d_oswald> If the Buckeyes lose this, there's no one to blame but Urban Meyer for sticking with JT Barrett. Loyal to a fault.
937179712643792896 2017-12-02 04:40:30 UTC <d_oswald> @BillLandis25 @LuckyNumberSl7 Very nice haha pulling for Haskins out there too?
937179192185311233 2017-12-02 04:38:26 UTC <d_oswald> Time for the Defense to pick up JT again.
937178743990255617 2017-12-02 04:36:39 UTC <d_oswald> @BillLandis25 @LuckyNumberSl7 You've been pretty quiet tonight my friend.
937175594026065920 2017-12-02 04:24:08 UTC <d_oswald> Announcers saying JT has been brilliant must be watching the Penn State game. Certainly not this one.
937169303924768769 2017-12-02 03:59:08 UTC <d_oswald> @AriWasserman Because JT is hurt or because of the missed throws?
937168871273959425 2017-12-02 03:57:25 UTC <d_oswald> Very poor decision making there... Buckeyes keeping Wisconsin in this game by themselves. Defense has been outstanding.
937161157869297664 2017-12-02 03:26:46 UTC <d_oswald> Wisconsin has a quarterback with a noodle arm and he still manages to hit his receivers downfield.
937159559759761408 2017-12-02 03:20:25 UTC <d_oswald> What a stupid pass on 3rd and 16.
937152885829390336 2017-12-02 02:53:54 UTC <d_oswald> @DerekDraper33 No one is complaining about receivers being open tonight...
937152753431973888 2017-12-02 02:53:22 UTC <d_oswald> Should be 28-10 right now at a minimum.
937152509747056640 2017-12-02 02:52:24 UTC <d_oswald> Really thought the pass to McLauren was a good sign. JT missed at least 2 for-sure TD's on that key drive...
937151904609599488 2017-12-02 02:50:00 UTC <d_oswald> How many wide open throws are we going to miss?! 1 for 6 on throws 15+ yards...
937149033126260737 2017-12-02 02:38:35 UTC <d_oswald> Big time step up by the defense there to only allow a FG...
937144118672875520 2017-12-02 02:19:03 UTC <d_oswald> This is Ohio State Football.
937141156722421761 2017-12-02 02:07:17 UTC <d_oswald> That's a big drop right there...

937130974290284544 2017-12-02 01:26:49 UTC <d_oswald> Will be upfront and say I haven't been on the JT train this year, but a JT that is having a hard time running isn't going to win this game...

929818967732113409 2017-11-12 21:11:31 UTC <d_oswald> Kizer swapping jerseys after throwing an interception in the end zone to wrap up the game is comical to me.

928227967712493568 2017-11-08 11:49:27 UTC <d_oswald> @MikeAndMike @Espngreeny @espngolic agree with the premise Re: Bama and Georgia, but what if it's not a close game? Does the loser drop out out if Top 4 then?
928071230766370818 2017-11-07 01:26:38 UTC <d_oswald> Get ready Twitter. I just got promoted to #280characters #win

926918163513651200 2017-11-04 21:04:46 UTC <d_oswald> @Livy70 Call is correct but it's still a dumb rule
926911657061871616 2017-11-04 20:38:54 UTC <d_oswald> Beautiful throw by JT right there to JK!
926533906853236736 2017-11-03 19:37:52 UTC <d_oswald> Lol @Apple promoting a play in a loss for #PSU Not even the best play in that game #GoBuckshttps://twitter.com/CFBONFOX/status/924379865607913472

925548361402470400 2017-10-31 02:21:39 UTC <d_oswald> @NissanUSA @CollegeGameDay @LuckyNumberSl7 Shouldn't the best player in CF be able to overcome his O-line and def front 7? KO return also aided by good blocking and inept coverage...
925547080092876801 2017-10-31 02:16:34 UTC <d_oswald> @NissanUSA @CollegeGameDay @LuckyNumberSl7 He didn't look like the best player in college football that night.
925546808461418497 2017-10-31 02:15:29 UTC <d_oswald> I'll b the 1st to admit I'm not a huge soccer fan, but the @ColumbusCrewSC are fun to watch right now. #rootforohio #SaveTheCrew #ClaimGlory
925545532348665858 2017-10-31 02:10:25 UTC <d_oswald> @NissanUSA @CollegeGameDay @LuckyNumberSl7 Agree with you on Barrett, but the OSU defense called wondering if you saw the game on Saturday

925066903755874304 2017-10-30 18:28:31 UTC <d_oswald> @LuckyNumberSl7 Specifically the 4th quarter. Though defense was excellent the whole way
925045476709339136 2017-10-30 17:03:22 UTC <d_oswald> @LuckyNumberSl7 Same guy also said PSU was the better team on the field Saturday haha

924476201799954435 2017-10-28 03:21:17 UTC <d_oswald> Interesting read coming from the other side.https://twitter.com/djoneshoop/status/924467382512504832
924416395806412800 2017-10-28 23:23:38 UTC <d_oswald> I haven't been on the JT train this year, but that performance should put him in #Heisman talks. #GoBucks
924415375219019776 2017-10-28 23:19:34 UTC <d_oswald> Unbelievable comeback. Great game by JT.
924414659352039425 2017-10-28 23:16:44 UTC <d_oswald> Update: this tweet didn't age well. #GoBuckshttps://twitter.com/d_oswald/status/924414326856933377

924414151212052482 2017-10-28 23:14:43 UTC <d_oswald> As all the writers said, if Ohio State lost this game it wouldn't be because of the defense. Huge stop right there. #GoBucks #PSUvsOSU
924403326409691136 2017-10-28 22:31:42 UTC <d_oswald> Ohio State beat Ohio State today...

924384065272401920 2017-10-28 21:15:10 UTC <d_oswald> That was a prime chance to go 2 for 2 on scoring. Blown playcalling. Have had no luck going side to side yet we stick with it...
924383729765814279 2017-10-28 21:13:50 UTC <d_oswald> @AriWasserman Haha that's what we count on you for
924377608602767370 2017-10-28 20:49:30 UTC <d_oswald> At least Urban is a 2nd half coach.
924376027396300801 2017-10-28 20:43:13 UTC <d_oswald> Stop or turnover here would be huge. And these penalties have got to stop.

923231978408828931 2017-10-25 16:57:11 UTC <d_oswald> @ColinCowherd @TheHerd @LuckyNumberSl7 Thats why I've taken these last 4-5 weeks with grain of salt. Saturday will show us a lot.
922598501153898497 2017-10-23 22:59:58 UTC <d_oswald> @MLBastian That's great and all, but shouldn't they find a pitching coach before a political correctness officer?

921001802362949633 2017-10-19 13:15:15 UTC <d_oswald> @Collin_53 Up until this year, maybe. Just because they had that dominant run in central. However, as far as hatred for a team, Yankees may own that.
920997513917816832 2017-10-19 12:58:13 UTC <d_oswald> @Collin_53 I would disagree. The Cards are my national league team. You're also basing your assumption that OH roots for Cinci, I'd say mostly CLE
920387529739767809 2017-10-17 20:34:21 UTC <d_oswald> @DreKnott just listened to the #AtoZPodcast for the first time. For some reason I didn't expect that from you haha

919393399446409216 2017-10-14 02:44:02 UTC <d_oswald> @LuckyNumberSl7 Looks like the team we all expected to see against Oklahoma
919364849657896961 2017-10-14 00:50:35 UTC <d_oswald> I mean, I know it's Nebraska and all, but holy smokes JT!
919352595948425216 2017-10-14 00:01:54 UTC <d_oswald> I'd like a further explanation. You wouldn't pay for the rights or you weren't sold the rights? #GettingOldhttps://twitter.com/slinganswers/status/919351363997401088

919337989486018560 2017-10-14 23:03:51 UTC <d_oswald> @Sling why is the #OSUvsNEB GAME not available on @FS1 ... why am I paying for you if you black out games?

917546706228662272 2017-10-09 00:25:56 UTC <d_oswald> That walk to Frazier would have been strike 3 to Severino
917542635107176448 2017-10-09 00:09:45 UTC <d_oswald> The good thing about this 4 run deficit is that these same @Indians erased a 5 run deficit 3 days ago. #RallyTogether
917217130956972033 2017-10-08 02:36:19 UTC <d_oswald> @DerekDraper33 Right. But if he's on the roster as defensive insurance in center, and already in the game, why not swap him and Kip?
917216486720188417 2017-10-08 02:33:46 UTC <d_oswald> @DerekDraper33 Gonzo is only other guy on the bench (other than EE). Will he bat if Brantley's spot comes up again then?
917215752855392258 2017-10-08 02:30:51 UTC <d_oswald> Why not move Kip to DH and put Allen in center? Didn't he make the roster as an insurance CF?https://twitter.com/MLBastian/status/917212497890947072

917192224680574978 2017-10-08 00:57:21 UTC <d_oswald> Great pitcher's duel here in Game 3. Too bad Tribe couldn't maximize Kipnis' 1 out 3B. #RallyTogether
917191537662025729 2017-10-08 00:54:37 UTC <d_oswald> @DerekDraper33 Yes, and I almost didn't even say anything but felt like it was necessary. Batted over .300 last post season and is around the .100 mark now

917117718159151110 2017-10-08 20:01:17 UTC <d_oswald> I was all for giving Hue another chance this year, but even his decisions now looking as bad as the team's play. #Browns
917116845555179520 2017-10-08 19:57:49 UTC <d_oswald> Why do the #Browns never have any timeouts left in the final 2 minutes? Anyone talking about Jackson's game management?

916410309384065029 2017-10-06 21:10:18 UTC <d_oswald> @Indians @DerekDraper33 I still remember being at the game he pitched on his 21st birthday. Stood outside the gate to the players parking lot and got his autograph.
916313080799416322 2017-10-06 14:43:57 UTC <d_oswald> @reynolds_31 I'll go with you if you have a ticket...
916138544531492864 2017-10-05 03:10:24 UTC <d_oswald> In between Bauer's terrific start and Jay Bruce's big day, let's not forget about Kipnis' catch in center! #RallyTogether #10togo
916120850822287360 2017-10-05 02:00:06 UTC <d_oswald> @DerekDraper33 To be fair, I did say today at work that if he pitches like he did all through the 2nd half then we'll be just fine...haha

916104109815721984 2017-10-05 00:53:34 UTC <d_oswald> Trevor Bauer is legit making all of us look silly for questioning Tito. #TrustInTito #RallyTogether

915367577748205568 2017-10-03 00:06:51 UTC <d_oswald> @AndrewNotAdam Yeah I would have gone for Yandy over Gonzo...I think... He has to be there for defense/pinch running is all I can think.
915289699526283264 2017-10-03 18:57:24 UTC <d_oswald> Really hard to believe Goody left off. Really felt he pitched well this yr and hoped he'd get a shot. Can't imagine how hard this is 4 staffhttps://twitter.com/Indians/status/915286526237511680

910589877976256512 2017-09-20 19:41:59 UTC <d_oswald> @DougLesmerises It's just a matter of coming in from the sides and holding it by the edges. Also agree the corner pieces go first on the way home.
910576458673934340 2017-09-20 18:48:40 UTC <d_oswald> @AriWasserman Did not look at it from this angle...I must admit
910574672680558593 2017-09-20 18:41:34 UTC <d_oswald> @DougLesmerises just listening to #BuckeyeTalk. Re: the square slices argument, the squares in the middle are . They have the most toppings
910564689851101185 2017-09-20 18:01:54 UTC <d_oswald> @AriWasserman ppl were surprised when Noah Brown left. Any chance of that being JT not leaving and knowing his stock wouldn't go any higher?
910135457928876032 2017-09-19 13:36:17 UTC <d_oswald> @AriWasserman is the fact that OSU was demoted 2 spots a reflection of our offensive struggles/outlook or more on the 2 teams that jumped ushttps://twitter.com/AriWasserman/status/909921236867850240
909782483373355008 2017-09-18 14:13:41 UTC <d_oswald> @mike_petriello Was at the CLE game yesterday and saw Kluber pitch a gem. The two times I've watched Sale pitch he got lit up by CLE. Obv some bias here tho
909780771686281221 2017-09-18 14:06:53 UTC <d_oswald> @mike_petriello if the choice was yours, and yours alone, who would your choice be?https://twitter.com/mike_petriello/status/909778202876350466
909515120287633408 2017-09-17 20:31:17 UTC <d_oswald> Can't wait for October. Kluber pads his CY Young resume yet again.  #RollTribe #RallyTogether #ALCentralChamps

909237685189070853 2017-09-16 02:08:51 UTC <d_oswald> @DerekDraper33 Yeah that was me... I started to think you might not have it haha
909237149417033729 2017-09-16 02:06:43 UTC <d_oswald> @DerekDraper33 Good deal. You want to go to the Tribe game tomorrow?
909235201435455488 2017-09-16 01:58:59 UTC <d_oswald> @DerekDraper33 Missed the game today unfortunately. So you're saying we are set for next year? Haha
909234637557436416 2017-09-16 01:56:45 UTC <d_oswald> @1NickMiller @ChadKellogg This is great. I have a neighbor who does this with their dog though...up & down street to poop and never picks it up...

906711629294862338 2017-09-09 02:51:12 UTC <d_oswald> @LuckyNumberSl7 He can be a leader in the locker room and the sideline, that's fine with me. But he obviously can't be a leader on the field
906711166453501956 2017-09-09 02:49:22 UTC <d_oswald> @LuckyNumberSl7 He's out here double clutching again... Every. Single. Play.

705069089576906752 2016-03-02 16:35:45 UTC <d_oswald> To #StopTrump, either @tedcruz or @marcorubio will need to drop out. They are splitting too many votes between themselves #collaboration
704398606946664449 2016-02-29 20:11:29 UTC <d_oswald> That time you see a wildlife license plate on a #Camaro #gasguzzlingtreehugger #smh
699567312563806208 2016-02-16 12:13:39 UTC <d_oswald> @foxandfriends how is #thebark from @HillaryClinton not being compared to #thescream?
699400413020340224 2016-02-15 01:10:27 UTC <d_oswald> @SeanLowe09 she'd tell you it's so that the rows are clear and people will be able to get out quickly in case of a crash
699047955379179522 2016-02-14 01:49:54 UTC <d_oswald> @chrisbharrison what happens when someone gets stranded on a 2-on-1?!
699046507031486465 2016-02-14 01:44:09 UTC <d_oswald> @chrisbharrison watching #thebachelorat20 and wondering how many gallons of tears have been shed over 20 seasons?

696516014058696704 2016-02-07 02:08:53 UTC <d_oswald> So far #SB50 #MVP goes to either McManus or the whole #Denver D
696513029870063616 2016-02-07 01:57:01 UTC <d_oswald> @reynolds_31 favors for the MVP?
696506082919915520 2016-02-07 01:29:25 UTC <d_oswald> @NARAL @Doritos have you heard a baby's heartbeat at 8 weeks? Tell me that's not life. #itsalive

695757836756918272 2016-02-05 23:56:09 UTC <d_oswald> That time there's 1 min left in a JV basketball game and the refs call 10 fouls. Oh, and it's a 25 point game... #enoughalready
693852718516039680 2016-01-31 17:45:53 UTC <d_oswald> The top 2 Dem candidates include a socialist and the subject of an FBI investigation. And these are serious contenders #smh
693851827935248384 2016-01-31 17:42:21 UTC <d_oswald> Hoping the @marcorubio caucus-goers can be persuasive! #GOPhttps://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/693850953552941061
