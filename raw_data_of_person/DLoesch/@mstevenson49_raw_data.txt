970768361880719361 2018-03-05 21:09:48 UTC <mstevenson49> @ericafett @VividVivka Just look at Roman Polanski, he's a Hollywood hero.... Sex crimes are simply not a problem for them.
970457550322794496 2018-03-04 00:34:44 UTC <mstevenson49> @VividVivka Food poisoning always seems far worse to me than a cold or flu so, I hope you feel better soon!
969283959195602944 2018-03-01 18:51:18 UTC <mstevenson49> @VividVivka I'm so very sorry you have had to deal with this stuff the last few days. I wish there was something any of us could say or do to make it better but, sadly, the world is full of trolls.
967447154678788100 2018-02-24 17:12:30 UTC <mstevenson49> @ABC @karen_tarolli These 4 officers were cowards and derelict in their duty. If they had done their jobs, entered the building and engaged the shooter they could have saved lives, at the very least because the shooter would have focused on them and not students.
966736840974848001 2018-02-22 18:09:58 UTC <mstevenson49> @NayruSuicide People just have to find something to complain about. As long as he is comfortable wearing whatever gets put on him, everyone should just bugger off about it.
964829867220094976 2018-02-17 11:52:20 UTC <mstevenson49> @NayruSuicide Oh, we here take our constitution very seriously. But, people have very different ideas on it too. Some , like me are strict interpreters while others see it and being flexible with the times. Those are the people who think guns are bad but, riots are free speech.
964586191264894980 2018-02-16 19:44:03 UTC <mstevenson49> @RealRonHoward @WarwickADavis Willow was part of a trilogy and I was very disappointed that the other 2 books never made it to film.
964564446667464704 2018-02-16 18:17:39 UTC <mstevenson49> @NayruSuicide Shouting and swearing passes for political and civil discourse now a days in America. We have become very tribal...
964564166706163712 2018-02-16 18:16:32 UTC <mstevenson49> @NayruSuicide True, anyone can become criminals, I guess I just hold out hope that most of them won't. I guess I also hope we can find the balance between our right to bear arms and keeping them away from those who ought not have them.
964561084135985153 2018-02-16 18:04:17 UTC <mstevenson49> @NayruSuicide On a side note, this has been the most polite conversation I've had about guns in days. Thank you for that!
964560430319525888 2018-02-16 18:01:41 UTC <mstevenson49> @NayruSuicide I do agree that private sellers should have to go through a dealer to sell a firearm. And I didn't say it was easy to get a gun in the UK, I know it's not for an honest, law abiding citizen, only that if a criminal wants a gun, he/she will find a way.
964558135515078657 2018-02-16 17:52:34 UTC <mstevenson49> @NayruSuicide It's not nearly as easy as it's made out to be. It's also actually quite rare for someone who has gone through the process to legally buy a gun to use it in a crime. I'd bet our bad guys probably get gun the same way they do in the UK, black market or stones from legal owners.
964555450212651008 2018-02-16 17:41:54 UTC <mstevenson49> @NayruSuicide Here self defense is and there are literally millions of people who owen guns that don't commit these types of heinous crimes. The most tragic part of Wednesdays shooting is that, according to reports, everyone knew this kid was troubled, including the FBI...
964550305672294402 2018-02-16 17:21:28 UTC <mstevenson49> @NayruSuicide I'm a "gun nut" and I haven't gone crazy. There are things we can do to make sure the wrong people don't get their hands on guns that are very common sense. The problem is how do we adjudicate the wrong people from the right in a country that gone "tribal" so to speak?
964548628831506432 2018-02-16 17:14:48 UTC <mstevenson49> @NayruSuicide Banning guns won't solve the societal problems we have here, it will only be a bandaid at Best.
964548164308164608 2018-02-16 17:12:57 UTC <mstevenson49> @NayruSuicide 91 people per day are killed by drunk driver. 681 people per day from medical errors. 948 people per day from smoking related illness.  All since January 1, all preventable and all higher than gun deaths. No one ever talks about banning cars, Drs and rarely cigarettes...
964507882036350982 2018-02-16 14:32:53 UTC <mstevenson49> @NayruSuicide The number of people killed every day is incorrect,  the number is actually about 34ish using 2015 numbers and most of those are gang/criminal on criminal shootings.

959663658296102912 2018-02-02 05:43:40 UTC <mstevenson49> @VividVivka This is funny...
958874512187158528 2018-01-31 01:27:53 UTC <mstevenson49> @VividVivka @TheBioPhreak There can be only one!
958269606103322624 2018-01-30 09:24:12 UTC <mstevenson49> @DarthLux Being pretty cool might help a little...maybe?
958255292583686145 2018-01-30 08:27:19 UTC <mstevenson49> @VividVivka @pogohopensa If she's gonna do a star trek she should do something from Discovery. A Terran empire officer could be cool.pic.twitter.com/OmDh7PaDgZ
957163238541717504 2018-01-27 08:07:53 UTC <mstevenson49> @VividVivka What did I just watch?!?  One of these days I'm going to contribute meaningfully to you stream...or unmeaningfully...or at all really
956074128561393664 2018-01-24 08:00:09 UTC <mstevenson49> @VividVivka It's an awesome calendar!
954623363355430912 2018-01-19 07:55:20 UTC <mstevenson49> @VividVivka @BauerToBeWild I'm pretty sure that line is long!
954564121273528320 2018-01-19 03:59:56 UTC <mstevenson49> @JoyAnnReid This is incorrect. There is still a 60 vote threshold for fiscal votes in the Senate and Republicans only have 51 votes so, they do not control the entire government. Education about how our government actually works is essential to a reporter/ pundits job.
954408197422505984 2018-01-19 17:40:20 UTC <mstevenson49> @itsnebulabee It's sucks when someone you love and trust turns on you like that and doing it on your birthday day is just rubbing salt into the wound. His timing sucked but, you seem to be in a great place now.
953119433605730306 2018-01-15 04:19:15 UTC <mstevenson49> @OfficialNMJ That has to be the on of the best reasons I've ever read
950993162146844672 2018-01-09 07:30:13 UTC <mstevenson49> @itsnebulabee Have you been watching Discovery?
950984093147258880 2018-01-09 06:54:10 UTC <mstevenson49> @itsnebulabee TNG but, I'm old. DS9 didn't get interesting for me until the got the Defiant and started getting off that bloody station. The series ending was kind of a let down too.
950584584193929216 2018-01-08 04:26:40 UTC <mstevenson49> @ClaraCosmia Wow, 2 years!?! I hope you were able to get the help/answers/care you were looking for!
949883876280762369 2018-01-06 06:02:18 UTC <mstevenson49> @thealixlynx my fear would be not measuring up to her work partners but, I long as she keeps coming home to me I would find a way to deal.
949120164494299136 2018-01-04 03:27:35 UTC <mstevenson49> @UFCW876  I have a night crew member with 4 years seniority make a 3 years wage, in fact there are people with 5 months less seniority making more money than him, because his anniversary date is in January. What can we do to fix this because his complaints are unanswered.
948962486199504897 2018-01-04 17:01:02 UTC <mstevenson49> @itsnebulabee I shall now have to find the worst hat in existence to test that....
948950841943314432 2018-01-04 16:14:46 UTC <mstevenson49> @itsnebulabee I'm still baffled as to how you made a fez look so cool but, damn if you didn't pull it off!
948791995820068864 2018-01-03 05:43:34 UTC <mstevenson49> @VividVivka I can do movies but, not a restaurant...
947329945545658368 2017-12-30 04:53:54 UTC <mstevenson49> @itsnebulabee Well, how was it? I'm assuming you enjoyed the hell out of it!
947323808444231680 2017-12-30 04:29:31 UTC <mstevenson49> @VividVivka @ThatOneAceGuy Best email bomb ever!!!
946779511252807681 2017-12-29 16:26:40 UTC <mstevenson49> @itsnebulabee It shouldn't matter if The Doctor is played by a man or woman as long as the writing is good and the part is well acted. I was not a fan of either Matt Smith nor Peter Capaldi so I'm still holding my breath that Doctor Who can be a show I get into again.
946600945517056005 2017-12-28 04:37:07 UTC <mstevenson49> @itsnebulabee That's unbeeleavable!
946305263073624064 2017-12-28 09:02:10 UTC <mstevenson49> @itsnebulabee That seems both painful and quite annoying.
946253131167477760 2017-12-27 05:35:01 UTC <mstevenson49> @itsnebulabee Did this have anything to do with the rapid deployment of the international symbol for "learn how to drive jerk!"
946066747534299136 2017-12-27 17:14:24 UTC <mstevenson49> @VividVivka If it's just trying to get your land legs back, try walking around your back yard or around the block. But, if you have a mild inner ear infection w your flu/cold, it could take a few days to get you equilibrium back...
946031383461400577 2017-12-27 14:53:52 UTC <mstevenson49> @itsnebulabee I totally understand what you're saying. I find most people think they have it worse and try to make it about them and it sucks. Taking a break from dating is okay but, don't do what I did and give up on it. Accepting being lonely is no fun..
