970874115858010114 2018-03-05 04:10:01 UTC <kerriebeth28> @sarahchad_ @marniehutchinso @MarlaCaldwell Ok so if I stab a woman going to have an abortion. The appointment is set and confirmed. The baby dies, how come I would be charged with murder?
970867851014877184 2018-03-05 03:45:08 UTC <kerriebeth28> @sarahchad_ @MarlaCaldwell Ok so was the husband traveling and are they Jewish. Also what about exodus 21:22-25. Killing an unborn child is murder. Funny how liberals only read certain parts of the Bible. Its ok snowflake.
970865645784043520 2018-03-05 03:36:22 UTC <kerriebeth28> @sarahchad_ @MarlaCaldwell Well you seem well versed so where is it?
970853459078582272 2018-03-05 02:47:56 UTC <kerriebeth28> @sarahchad_ @MarlaCaldwell Also may not be my unborn child but it is my tax dollars. So stop valuing one life over anothers. An child is a child. Abortion is murder. And people kill not guns.
970851314702979073 2018-03-05 02:39:25 UTC <kerriebeth28> @sarahchad_ @MarlaCaldwell Murder. And your stats are way off. Start calling their clinics. You know what prevents the need for abortion? Not having unprotected sex, not having sex and adoption is always a choice. Also where in the Bible does it say abortion is ok?
970848488329306115 2018-03-05 02:28:11 UTC <kerriebeth28> @sarahchad_ @MarlaCaldwell Ok then make them stop doing abortions and killing children
970842562582982656 2018-03-05 02:04:38 UTC <kerriebeth28> @svnshinelmj @sarahchad_ @rhythmofcamila Planned parenthood
970842392071897089 2018-03-05 02:03:58 UTC <kerriebeth28> @sarahchad_ If all of you are worried about a childs life, then why is there planned parenthood, government funded, abortion clinics?
970842151742517248 2018-03-05 02:03:01 UTC <kerriebeth28> @sarahchad_ @MarlaCaldwell Yes and it is government funded. Aka Planned Parenthood.

Just like PEOPLE  kill others, not the gun. It is a people problem and anyone who blames the weapon, is very small minded and refuse to admit it is people
