917559924548362240 2017-10-09 01:18:28 UTC <fdamore5055> @dbongino Looks like we should have the same restrictions for Moore regarding cheeseburgers.  I'm sorry, that was a very Lib remark.

916970968240836608 2017-10-08 10:18:09 UTC <fdamore5055> Once again, this is a typical liberal response yet we are the intolerant deplorables.https://twitter.com/realsaavedra/status/916877709925429248
916833684094930946 2017-10-07 01:12:38 UTC <fdamore5055> @dbongino I would like to say that this is a surprise but alas, this is just the normal Lib response, either vulgar or insulting or condescending
916102415623118848 2017-10-05 00:46:50 UTC <fdamore5055> @WilkowMajority This is utter BS, show me a politician that hasn't taken money from an organization that can be linked back to BLOOD!!
916046439658254336 2017-10-05 21:04:25 UTC <fdamore5055> @mschlapp I must say Matt, if that's the secret to your always fabulous hair then count me in!!!

915864570337652737 2017-10-05 09:01:44 UTC <fdamore5055> @CNN Does anyone believe that we are not doing everything possible for Puerto Rico?  Pelosi is such a hack
915754245940490240 2017-10-04 01:43:20 UTC <fdamore5055> @CNN Wouldn't have mattered in this incident or most others.

915663797808979970 2017-10-04 19:43:56 UTC <fdamore5055> @dbongino Kimmel stated that 59 innocent people were killed, does he consider the shooter an innocent person?

914664943592640513 2017-10-01 01:34:50 UTC <fdamore5055> @JamesPindell @dnvolz Rebuke: express sharp disapproval or criticism of (someone) because of their behavior or actions don't think it was a rebuke.
914662079696601089 2017-10-01 01:23:28 UTC <fdamore5055> @mschlapp Matt is famous 24/7 in my eyes!

914313991274369024 2017-09-30 02:20:17 UTC <fdamore5055> @ananavarro @CNN I believe they are the ones that were criticizing.  Wake up CNN
914200393441251329 2017-09-30 18:48:53 UTC <fdamore5055> @WilkowMajority Now that is a typical left Lib response.
