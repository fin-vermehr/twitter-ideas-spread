971190277435248640 2018-03-06 01:06:20 UTC <ErickTufbeird> @benshapiro Why are things like metal detectors and armed security seen as something offensive and terrible in schools but super ok at banks, government buildings, airports... whats a more valuable resource than our children?

970485177607770112 2018-03-04 02:24:31 UTC <ErickTufbeird> @ABC Eugenio no! I love your work and I think youre hilarious but please dont fall into line with these leftist liberal snowflakes.  Whats wrong with a wall? People build fences around their homes to keep trespassers out, whats the difference?
970373909639041025 2018-03-04 19:02:23 UTC <ErickTufbeird> @GovMikeHuckabee @FoxNews @darren04 Infringement on any right for anyone is bad. Ill defend my 1st just as strongly as Ill defend my 2nd. These shootings have nothing to do with guns and everything to do with culture, think about terrorists, its not fertilizer or cars to blame, its there values and mental state.
970164399095910406 2018-03-03 05:09:52 UTC <ErickTufbeird> @securitydog56 DACA stands for deferred action for childhood arrivals, it was another blunder by President Obama in the form of executive action. Although it helped in that I am no longer breaking the law by being here, I now cant apply for residency.
970164272260157440 2018-03-03 05:09:21 UTC <ErickTufbeird> @securitydog56 To answer your other question, my parents brought me here legally when I was 6 years old, and we stayed past our visa expiration.
970161681333673984 2018-03-03 04:59:04 UTC <ErickTufbeird> Thank you for watching
970116863463215110 2018-03-03 02:00:58 UTC <ErickTufbeird> @benshapiro @realDailyWire I dont get it.  I take that back, the people trying to prevent his speeches dont get. FREEDOM OF SPEECH.  If youre going to partake in this right, then dont be a hypocrite and try to deny others the same right.  If you dont agree, walk away.  SIMPLE!
969933620981981184 2018-03-03 13:52:50 UTC <ErickTufbeird> @CNN What Im getting at is that teachers being armed is not only a deterrent to future shooters but a very solid line of defense.  We already know these teachers are brave and will risk life and limb for these kids, now they just need the right tools to efficiently do so.
969933210183487490 2018-03-03 13:51:12 UTC <ErickTufbeird> @CNN Active shooter in the same building as you and your family, scenario 1 (no gun): they walk in, you cover your family to protect them, get shot and fall, your family still gets shot. Scenario 2 w/gun: they walk in, you shoot them, the end.
969932355266850818 2018-03-03 13:47:48 UTC <ErickTufbeird> @LarryGatlin @FoxNews @justsayin60 Youre intolerant to people that dont share your views, easily offended and quick to lash out. People like you would deny me my right to protect my boys or say they are inherently rapists just for being born male. You would ban civil speech and promote violent protest etc...
969929033403297792 2018-03-03 13:34:36 UTC <ErickTufbeird> I am a Free Thinker.  I once thought that was the same thing as being liberal, but quickly realized that I couldnt disagree with any thing on the liberal agenda without being labeled and deathly offending someone.
969927369812316162 2018-03-03 13:27:59 UTC <ErickTufbeird> @cvpayne @FoxNews @VictorB836 Clear threats to American Democracy are things like intolerance and prejudice, ignoring mental illness, the murder of babies, and a lack of decent values. Forcibly and violently silencing others in the name of free speech, and forcing ideas down our childrens malleable gullets.
969925576290111489 2018-03-03 13:20:52 UTC <ErickTufbeird> @cvpayne @FoxNews @T_Bone1964 Had any of the brave teachers trying to save lives had a gun, more casualties could have been avoided.  Simple as that.
969924704114036737 2018-03-03 13:17:24 UTC <ErickTufbeird> @cvpayne @FoxNews @proverbs1_7 6 out of 8 down sir, and its terrifying how quickly were sliding down hill.
969923298086871041 2018-03-03 13:11:49 UTC <ErickTufbeird> @FoxNews @jc_qian @Thedoogle78 Wait, the Sheriff isnt allowed to be a journalist? Because he is the only one that spoke in this video and hes right, if youre going to critique, do so on the subject and topic, dont just attack the people reporting or spewing
969922546937356288 2018-03-03 13:08:50 UTC <ErickTufbeird> @FoxNews @barryonash Because regardless of additional restrictions on firearms or even a complete ban, bad people are going to do bad things.  Does anyone really think new legislation is going to keep criminals and mentally unstable people who DO NOT follow the law from obtaining a gun?
969921950444343296 2018-03-03 13:06:27 UTC <ErickTufbeird> @FoxNews We dont want to blame law enforcement and authorities for their obvious failure this time around despite 17 dead CHILDREN, but let one black man who happens to be a criminal get gunned down on video and all of a sudden all cops are to blame...  Far Left, please make sense...

969921059108646914 2018-03-03 13:02:55 UTC <ErickTufbeird> @FoxNews @kathgirl1987 Well... Im Mexican, lets get that out of the way.  There arent very many illegal crossings through Canada to the US.  Not as many as there are from Mexico. The US still spends a substantial amount of money on CAN/USA border, though not as much I imagine.
