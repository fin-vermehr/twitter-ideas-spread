971245337875763201 2018-03-06 04:45:08 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Thanks @realDonaldTrump theres a blue wave coming & its your fault
971219265717260288 2018-03-06 03:01:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I seriously doubt that, plus our plant is located in a Republican stronghold, whites wont bust ass. Our mixing area pays well over min wage, the only whites that stay are the ones that live way out in the sticks

971140973899153408 2018-03-06 21:50:25 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Again, you clearly have no idea how to run a business, were not going to pay top Dollar to have someone stand there & feed a machine, even our positions they pay well above min wage, whites wont work, work is too hard
971138777392537601 2018-03-06 21:41:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Bro, you are twisting what I say, whites WONT do the entry level work at my job,
971136526548635650 2018-03-06 21:32:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No Bro, Im saying shut it all down, your stats meaning nothing, Dinesh was highly educated still committed a felony
971133383475593217 2018-03-06 21:20:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You should do more researchpic.twitter.com/a1a9eexmxJ

971122058213109760 2018-03-06 20:35:15 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Russia isnt our friend & your a fool to think so, they had a huge hand in 9/11.
971121738762412033 2018-03-06 20:33:59 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I was bitching about Asian immigration when you were still swimming around in your daddys nut sack, kid. Old guard conservatives didnt dig on Asian immigration back in the day.
971119283605508097 2018-03-06 20:24:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I dont, as I said, if your going to build a wall and curb immigration, no exceptions.

971067159190343680 2018-03-06 16:57:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @DineshDSouza @wolfgang_joseph Playing the numbers game, Dinesh is highly educated & still committed a felony, education dont mean shit, if you have poor moral character as Dinesh, clearly does, education goes out the window
971062927905165313 2018-03-06 16:40:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @DineshDSouza @wolfgang_joseph Yes, that doesnt put money in my pocket, it levels the playing field by cutting off that subsidy. People should not be allowed to lower their taxable income by having children
971061186111393792 2018-03-06 16:33:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @DineshDSouza @wolfgang_joseph Total opinion on your part, You have no idea how many of these White South African fucks will be on the dole or commit crimes like Dinesh did, just cause they have white skin doesnt mean they get a free pass or a free ride.

971057596781260800 2018-03-06 16:19:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @DineshDSouza @wolfgang_joseph As do most people, very few people promote things that will harm them.
971054021946507264 2018-03-06 16:04:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @DineshDSouza @wolfgang_joseph Weak answer, Im a Nihilist because I dont think either side should make the call on who gets in so be it, neither tribe has shown me capable of making that call
971048190660268033 2018-03-06 15:41:44 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @DineshDSouza @wolfgang_joseph The have a serious problem with the Right Wings double standard & hypocrisy. The Left has plenty of issues which I point out. Whos to decide if they are a benefit to this country? You, your tribe, Trump, Bernie, Hillary? I say none of the above
971045930320441345 2018-03-06 15:32:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @DineshDSouza @wolfgang_joseph Bro, he donated money in the name of straw donors, was found guilty, people have had citizenship stripped for less, start the proceedings.
971041503362633728 2018-03-06 15:15:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @DineshDSouza @wolfgang_joseph DSouza is a naturalized Citizen, who committed a felony interfering in our election process, people have been stripped of citizenship for less.
971035106583416832 2018-03-06 14:49:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Ill take Trump more seriously on this issue when he deports felons like @DineshDSouza

971002466652360704 2018-03-06 12:40:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @DineshDSouza This is partially true, what you left out is the Republicans did nothing to reverse manifest destiny, Lincoln had 3 tools for dealing with Indians, Killing, Removal & Treaties. Lincoln also ordered the largest mass execution in US history. I see why you left that out tho
970932119617798144 2018-03-06 08:00:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> ROFL, Republican leadership in Kansas has destroyed that state for the last 8 years.https://twitter.com/hellboundreaper/status/970922029049409536

970798415331430401 2018-03-05 23:09:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CNN @thecjpearson @chazlouaz Exactly! They never talk about how 4 of the last 6 governors of Illinois have been Republican, if I have my math right.
970794135404851201 2018-03-05 22:52:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CNN @thecjpearson @HellBoundReaper Stocktons mayor had a gun stole from his house used in a homicide of 13 yr old boy, hes a Republican, but that doesnt fit,CJs narrative hes pushing. Check out Silivas homicide rate while mayor.http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-stockton-mayor-gun-20160730-snap-story.html
970791442821124096 2018-03-05 22:41:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CNN @thecjpearson @HellBoundReaper With little change in homicide rate, both partys had rates that rival,Chicago
970777338521772032 2018-03-05 21:45:28 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CNN @thecjpearson Why dont you talk about Miami ( republican run) or Stockton,CA (Republican run till last year) both cities per capita homicide rates rival Chicago

970468008320741383 2018-03-04 01:16:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @StefanMolyneux @SgtElzetta That may be true, but the fact is, if Molyneux was truly concerned about abortion rates, he wouldnt just talk about blacks.
970452008250544128 2018-03-04 00:12:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @StefanMolyneux @SgtElzetta So by that logic, more white people means they get to kill more white babies, that is what you are saying, correct?
970449465919311873 2018-03-04 00:02:37 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @WalshFreedom For what? They are under no legal obligation to protect me, Parkland proved that

970447289021009920 2018-03-04 23:53:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @StefanMolyneux @SgtElzetta True, but the only reason you phrase it that way is to deflect from the fact, more white babies are killed in the womb overall
970438795278548993 2018-03-04 23:20:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @StefanMolyneux Such a strange tweet, 185,828 white babies were killed in 2014 as well, if your numbers are correct. Odd you singled out black babies

959493442056409089 2018-02-02 18:27:17 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The numbers Im seeing are 43,421,338
959492991588106241 2018-02-02 18:25:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Where are your Nov numbers from?
959492165192896512 2018-02-02 18:22:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yes, monthly decrease in fiscal 2017 not 200k & it rose in Oct 2017 from 42,002,501 to 45,641,674,
959487727405322240 2018-02-02 18:04:35 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph My 173,000 number was the decrease for fiscal 2017
959487450753175553 2018-02-02 18:03:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Wrong, in oct 2017, the latest SNAP stats enrollment has gone up. It states that in the fns link you sent me
959479469986795527 2018-02-02 17:31:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Also the main reason it dropped is because most states tightened up their requirements
959479097922646018 2018-02-02 17:30:17 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Newsweek used SNAPs stats 2016- 44,219,363 2017- 42,137,785 Difference of 2,081,578 Thats 173,464 a month not 200,000
959474077407772672 2018-02-02 17:10:20 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Reported by who? Ive been on SNAPs website, none of your numbers jive & the SNAP rolls have increased in Oct of 2017, the latest figures they have.
959471177327628289 2018-02-02 16:58:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Funny, the rate didnt drop, Bro, you dont know shit about economics, you throw numbers out there that you cant back up, like your 200k a month claim about SNAP, you dont even know what tax rate you were taxed in 2016.
959467983616823296 2018-02-02 16:46:08 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Sure

959187694697046016 2018-02-01 22:12:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @YouTube @KyleKulinski @BlakeMoliere I never heard of Clinton doing that, Obama floated the idea of PPPs modeled after some states, those almost never work & taxpayers usually end up paying more in the long run.

958859130663571457 2018-01-31 00:26:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> I predict this will end badly for Trump.
958840882760962048 2018-01-31 23:14:15 UTC <JohnQPublic30> With the birth of super PACs thanks to Citizens United, the average voter is trying to take on millionaires like the Kochs & Mercers, who have unlimited funds & teams of minions, working to sway an election. Its a daunting task Im sure you will agree.
958840880009502723 2018-01-31 23:14:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Many of us boomers have been voting local, as Tip ONeil said All politics is local since before you were born. Im sure you werent talking directly to me, but keep in mind, many of us have been on the front lines for years.
958840876943409152 2018-01-31 23:14:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> I saw the rise of populism in the form of Pat Buchanan in 92 & 96, I witnessed the birth of Right Wing Media, led by Rush Limbaugh & Fox News.
958840873936195584 2018-01-31 23:14:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> I refused to vote for Bill Clinton, mainly because he left the campaign trail to execute Ricky Ray Rector, a alleged quote of his after was  lets see them say Im soft on crime,now, I was a Ross Perot guy, before he went goofy

958352096096604160 2018-01-30 14:51:59 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JackPosobiec @KiltedRef @GasBuddyGuy I understand, however does not change the fact that since Election Day, Ive been paying between 9-29.5 % more for a gallon of gas
958349672267026432 2018-01-30 14:42:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JackPosobiec @KiltedRef @GasBuddyGuy By your chart, I was living in rarefied air under Obama, where I lived gas was nowhere near $2.35 a gallon, throughout 2016 it remained between $2.00 & $2.16 even the high fluctuations corrected quickly
958344389553803264 2018-01-30 14:21:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JackPosobiec @KiltedRef Yes, the dollar has dropped, but the 10 year US treasury note is at 2.706 right now & is up 22.25 for the year, which makes it less attractive for foreign investors to invest in the US, theyd get hammered on the exchange
958339071876698112 2018-01-30 14:00:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JackPosobiec @KiltedRef Bro, where I live it hovered around $2.00 a gallon for quite a long time, made small movements up, between 3-8 cents, but corrected quickly. Gas hasnt been lower than $2.09 since Election Day in my area

956653017633382400 2018-01-25 22:20:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The last thing we want is a trade war with China, they hold all the cards & have already made threats

955249567653646336 2018-01-21 01:23:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @jaredlholt @RachelLarris @wbgoody90 I actually agree with many things, Styx promotes such as free speech, but this shit with Holt is stupid. If Styx thinks hes the new media than Holt should be a non-issue

955224936481787909 2018-01-21 23:45:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @ItsVee_ Two X factors in play, The Minneapolis market is half the size of Philadelphia, so Eagles getting in will help tv ratings. Secondly, Minnesota is full of Scandinavian, Norwegian people known for been frugal, they wont pay those prices even if Vikings do get there
955222361434927104 2018-01-21 23:35:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @ItsVee_ What history? A team playing a super in their home stadium?
955221596813299712 2018-01-21 23:32:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @ItsVee_ If it happens it will be one of the lowest rated Super Bowls in resent history
955220592264994816 2018-01-21 23:28:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @ItsVee_ You are so far off on this, Minneapolis is too small of a market, having them in there will lower ratings.

953310766693797888 2018-01-16 16:59:33 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realDonaldTrump @wolfgang_joseph Trumps past is dubious at best. Ask his ex wife 
953310364451696641 2018-01-16 16:57:57 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph But, other people do if its on the cloud. When I got my first camera flip phone my tech friend told me  dont take a pic with that phone you dont want to world to see!
953305610497527809 2018-01-16 16:39:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph What about Apple, Bro, as soon as you click that button, its out, unless you really know what youre doing, whats your solution? Age restriction on phones?

952949939566456832 2018-01-15 17:05:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @ItsVee_ The last thing the NFL wants is a Jacksonville vs Minnesota SB, they are hoping for a NE vs Phiily SB.
952944913603153920 2018-01-15 16:45:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @ItsVee_ Minneapolis is a cow town, small market team, the big money would be Brees/Brady SB, two hall of famers clashing for the last time on big stage.
952941832241057798 2018-01-15 16:33:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @ItsVee_ He not on any top FS list I can see & hes a rookie, NFL would rather have a Brees vs Brady matchup. Higher ratings

952556937601847296 2018-01-14 15:04:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @HappyNoLucky True, but you dont really Believe a $1000 is a significant amount of money for todays family in 2018, do you?
952554126168162304 2018-01-14 14:52:55 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @HappyNoLucky If a family is in need of a tax break to pay for Karate & Little League, they need to adjust. $1000 is asswipe money unless youre way below the poverty line & even then its not life changing or will get you ahead
952541388670947328 2018-01-14 14:02:19 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @WalshFreedom @HappyNoLucky Exactly, it would make your life temporarily easier, but dont act like its life changing
952429707445899264 2018-01-13 06:38:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @WalshFreedom Im a regular American, $1000 aint sh*t. Its far from life changing, you cant even buy a descent used car for $1000

952344669400203264 2018-01-13 01:00:37 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Theyve already fired a shot across our bow, they hinted at not buying us treasuries anymore, could be huge, plus our currency is dropping compared to theirs. They still own us.
952342880424775680 2018-01-13 00:53:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Automation will destroy the millennials & Gen Z, thats why the politicians are focusing on immigration & not automation, politicians want automation, its good for profits
952341211230212096 2018-01-13 00:46:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Thats right, thats an Industry norm for us. As manufacturing automates people lose jobs & youre worried about immigration, immigrants are losing their jobs too
952339953421357056 2018-01-13 00:41:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Or they cant find one, many temps apply at our plant & we turn them down.
952338956066181120 2018-01-13 00:37:55 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph U-3, my state is always at least 2% lower than National average & generally 1-1.5 lower than National average in U-6
952337677772353536 2018-01-13 00:32:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The general consensus in economic circles is 3% is zero unemployment, theres always transitional unemployment in the economy. Since theyve been keeping track the lowest the unemployment rate has ever been is 2.3% in 1953 i Believe
952336309321953280 2018-01-13 00:27:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The vast majority of the temps at my job, cant find employment anywhere else, there will always be people like that.
952335864201441281 2018-01-13 00:25:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph All this is happening & we havent missed a beat, my state is at zero unemployment, temp services have had no problem finding us workers.
952335291540475904 2018-01-13 00:23:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph To do the jobs we use temps for, youd have to be brain dead. The jobs are kept simple for a reason, so we can plug a scrub in a run.
952334122336292866 2018-01-13 00:18:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Bro, we automated to get rid of workers, literally, we have 3 different temp services we going through, temp services literally beating down our doors for our business
952332813851820032 2018-01-13 00:13:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Bro, you do not understand this, extremely low skilled job, we use temps, that way we save on payroll tax, Heath insurance & misc other costs. Raising wages defeats the purpose of automating in the first place
952331784238313478 2018-01-13 00:09:25 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph We still need a limited number of workers to preform Basic job functions, the machines dont feed themselves, those jobs will be filled by temps
952331126323990530 2018-01-13 00:06:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You clearly dont understand the benefits of automation, you replace workers that you were paying wages & taxes on & replace them w/ a machine that you get a tax deferment on, no wages, no payroll tax & medical insurance. Its a no brainer
952329923187888128 2018-01-13 00:02:01 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Payroll & taxes.
952329786730450944 2018-01-13 00:01:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Again you dont know, shit! We slowly started to automate 3 years ago, eliminated 20 jobs & saved $500,000 a year in payroll & taxes, all the while getting a tax break on the equipment. Rolling those saving into purchasing our new automated lines, which will save us more in
952325158408261633 2018-01-13 23:43:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Fucks Sake, youre a idiot, if we bumped up wages it would eat into our bottom line & make it more difficult to automate (less cash on hand) you say your company is small fish but is in perpetual debt, how long you think youll survive, I mean really
952320936560164864 2018-01-13 23:26:19 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Again Bro, you literally know nothing about running a business, a businesses job is to maximize profits not to provide you with a job, we literally save $2 million a year using temps
952319303159869440 2018-01-13 23:19:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The reality is, your economic opinion is shoddy at best, I cant take anybody serious that doesnt know how much money they made last year & inflates their tax rate. Interest rates are still way low & Trumps economy is functioning like Obamas.
952316918651936769 2018-01-13 23:10:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph In 2014, Obama had two straight over 4%, as I said in past its progress, but not impressive progress
952298280859430914 2018-01-13 21:56:17 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Bro, manufacturing jobs were added under Trump & U-6 still went up last month. No matter what number you look at they are similar
952296323239305217 2018-01-13 21:48:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No shit, manufacturing is a job multiplier as Ive stated in past, numbers dont lie,Bro U-6 dropped the same under Trump as Obama. 2014- dropped 1.5  2015- dropped 1.4  2016- dropped .9  2017- dropped 1.3  Very similar numbers
952288451688304640 2018-01-13 21:17:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Every metric I look at Trumps economy is functioning at same level as Obamas! Keep spinning
952287017638989824 2018-01-13 21:11:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph BTW, U-6 has been falling since 2014, it actually went up after Trump got elected & Oct,Nov 2017 remained steady & Dec rose
952280681111056384 2018-01-13 20:46:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I meant its not an issue for auto lenders, most have GPS in them, theyll just take it & resell, far easier to do that with a car
952274784712261639 2018-01-13 20:22:55 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Theyre been here for sometime, Auto Loans might not be as big as a deal as cars are easier to repossess & resell
952272639904702465 2018-01-13 20:14:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No, theyre looking at total picture, trust me Bro, they know a hell of a lot more than you on this subject, many predicted the 2008 crash.
952270450276618241 2018-01-13 20:05:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Sorry Bro, Im listening to them before Ill ever listen to you, you know nothing about economics, how to manage a business. For Christ sake, you dont even know how much money you made last year 
952269484164878338 2018-01-13 20:01:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Put your spin on it, most conservative economists I Follow, all say the same thing, The economy is functioning just like it did under Obama
952268253535055877 2018-01-13 19:56:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph And it doesnt appear to be moving down that far, Trump had worst  job growth in six years, which is a leftist talking point, but I put an * by it cause it easier to crate jobs in a broken economy like Bush left Obama
952266892542201856 2018-01-13 19:51:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Big deal, Ive read a million reports that wages arent rising as fast as they would like, most people are staying put, country at or near full employment.
952265199511330818 2018-01-13 19:44:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Just about every company that announced bonuses had some form of layoff, 
952264420943650816 2018-01-13 19:41:44 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph 11,000 just lost their jobs & you say,so!  you are an asshole conservative
952263229279014913 2018-01-13 19:37:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph They also laid off people, an estimated 11,000

951822894329417728 2018-01-12 14:27:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No, Bro, its facts, big facts. I base my theorys on experience, Russians, Norwegians just as lazy as other groups, they are gaming our system.   THEY MUST GO BACK!!!

950425085864800257 2018-01-08 17:52:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Bro, Im not specifically talking about Trump, right now, Im pointing out at the present Oil prices are on the rise, which in turn negatively effects the economy, bad luck that it happened on his watch, but hell be associated with it, he owns the economy now
950422255246499841 2018-01-08 17:41:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @elonmusk @Tesla @wolfgang_joseph For the most part, we lock those prices in, but that doesnt account for fuel surcharge rise, across the board rates have gone up 10% & are expected to keep climbing in 2018, the causes for the rise are irrelevant
950418783134474242 2018-01-08 17:27:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @elonmusk @Tesla @wolfgang_joseph All these things have nothing to do with transportation costs in the present, it is costing companies more to ship their products today than even 3 months ago, Oil is up 16% last three months
950413562010390528 2018-01-08 17:07:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @elonmusk @Tesla @wolfgang_joseph Dude, youre overthinking this, Oil is over $60 & climbing, which in turn effects transportation cost in the present.
950411028004835330 2018-01-08 16:57:01 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @elonmusk @Tesla @wolfgang_joseph That doesnt help the short term, if it helps at all.

949481785364230144 2018-01-05 03:24:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No shit, but it doesnt mean when someone reaches adulthood they cant find a job, maybe the reason theres so many single AA households is due to the limited economic opportunities of AA males
949343419549343744 2018-01-05 18:14:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @DonaldJTrumpJr @josephlawler @wolfgang_joseph I grew up in a single family home, dirt poor, yet I made it, so the single parent talking point is BS. Crime rate is a completely different story.
949337545489383424 2018-01-05 17:51:23 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @DonaldJTrumpJr @josephlawler @wolfgang_joseph Yet, you folks on the right will never analyze why, I believe their unemployment rate is still twice that of whites

948601750302359552 2018-01-03 17:07:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If Trump had inherited Bushs mess I might be slightly impressed but he inherited a growing economy not one that was moving backward, Obama made plenty of missteps but got handed a shit economy

948587461197942784 2018-01-03 16:10:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Its getting more expensive for businesses to operate, which in turn eats into margins. Been informed by many vendors that prices are rising, possibly quarterly like in 2007
948585440810098688 2018-01-03 16:02:47 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If inflation doesnt stall it, PPI is troubling

948567998482264064 2018-01-03 14:53:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, you dont make enough money to be overtaxed. Period. When I bartended I make sure my shit matched up, came out to chump change, $150-200 at most, Im sure your waitress friends are spending all their tips
948565856715460610 2018-01-03 14:44:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Its a loophole that many take advantage of, get off you high horse, Trump exploits every loophole he can, I dont believe he lost almost a billion on that tax return he released , but he claimed he did, he exploited a loophole in the tax system
948561944566476802 2018-01-03 14:29:25 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, he games the system endlessly, why do you think I never give him shit about filing bankruptcy 4 times to escape debt, because I did the same shit.

948558187153772544 2018-01-03 14:14:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The burden of proof for your claim is on you, you claim keeps changing by the tweet. I showed this tweet to all my accountant friends, they laughed their asses off.pic.twitter.com/olxz1osftY

948549958243844096 2018-01-03 13:41:47 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You claimed to paid 19k in takes on 50k, theres no fucking way you paid that much, 19k I Believe is in the 38% ballpark
948549413974233088 2018-01-03 13:39:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Its on them to do their taxes properly, I was a bartender in my 20s, never had a problem
948547143136096256 2018-01-03 13:30:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If $240 is making or breaking them, they arent doing their taxes correctly, but Im sure Trumps tax plan will bring your mythical 38% tax rate down to 37% 
948544836164087808 2018-01-03 13:21:26 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realDonaldTrump @wolfgang_joseph Not really, his team is full of Goldman Sachs castoffs. Youre being lied to

That stops when Trumps plan takes effect. Rubio was brilliant in what he did, politics 101 fighting for that increase

948384412315586561 2018-01-02 02:43:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realDonaldTrump @wolfgang_joseph The child tax credits dont equal the old deduction. If I was single with a child, last year I could have taken $6350 std deduction, $4050 personal deduction & $4050 child deduction for $14450 Under Trumps plan Id get the $12000 deduction & the $2000 tax credit, Id lose $450
948382169747116034 2018-01-02 02:35:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realDonaldTrump @wolfgang_joseph They still cant claim the children so they still lose
948378939134799872 2018-01-02 02:22:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realDonaldTrump @wolfgang_joseph For single low income people, if youre  married with two kids your deduction under trump is $24,000 before It was $12700 in personal deductions & $16200 in personal & dependent deductions for $28900 in total deductions
948376507126345729 2018-01-02 02:12:33 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realDonaldTrump @wolfgang_joseph The deduction for dependents has been eliminated, the child tax credit will not make up for it
948360254999363585 2018-01-02 01:07:59 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realDonaldTrump @wolfgang_joseph Trump will take the heat as any other President would/does, will effect midterms.  As the truth comes out about the tax plan that will hurt republicans as well
948337813791150080 2018-01-02 23:38:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realDonaldTrump @wolfgang_joseph Meanwhile, oil is highest its been in years & dollar is down over 10% for the year & PPI Is rising & has every month Trumps been in office
948337303801466880 2018-01-02 23:36:47 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realDonaldTrump @wolfgang_joseph Dude, he literally tweeted about the low ratings of the Academy awards, they performed his inauguration. Some he does repeatedly, in the past hes claimed the apprentice was a number 1 show, highest its ever been was 7th in the first year, when downward from there
948336061205352449 2018-01-02 23:31:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yet, 15 million tuned into the early game in week 16, put that in prime time it wins the night.
948333712793657344 2018-01-02 23:22:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realDonaldTrump @wolfgang_joseph Which is what the god-king pedo hunter Trump does daily

948234659460272129 2018-01-02 16:48:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You missing the key component in this, PPI is rising, has been since Trump took office, inflation is here, as prices rise so do wages.
948233690290753537 2018-01-02 16:45:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph National data has yet to reflect this, if you look into Minnesota which is what the article focuses on, MN is always ahead of the curve in low unemployment & wages.
948232076897280000 2018-01-02 16:38:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph This has been going on long before Trump took office, this company is doing the same thing my plant has been doing for 3 years, hiring bonuses, also starting today 18 states & 20 are raising their minimum wage, so wages are going up.pic.twitter.com/N5hwTOxhfI

946462352391704577 2017-12-28 19:26:23 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Only married fathers can vote, typical millennial entitled asshole comment. You are nothing but a taker with an entitlement mentality in my eyes. Its a lifestyle choice nothing more, anyway you will probably be receiving less of a tax break in 2018, good news, Thanks Trump https://twitter.com/soliduslives/status/946460463927197697
946459484561592320 2017-12-28 19:15:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> First off, Im not a boomer, second, life is a zero sum game. If you want to reproduce, reproduce. If you need a Government handout to do so, you are flawed & entitled. https://twitter.com/soliduslives/status/946458342708322304
946457698383646722 2017-12-28 19:07:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Your opinions are not fact, its you belief that children are the entire point of society, simply not true. This is not a rational argument for why this tax break exists. If you cant support children without a government hand out, dont have them & get a second job https://twitter.com/soliduslives/status/946456093957353473
946455863459569665 2017-12-28 19:00:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Refer to my previous tweet for my explanation of that. https://twitter.com/soliduslives/status/946455252324073473
946455452178624513 2017-12-28 18:58:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Ill state again, not against anyone having children, against the unfair tax Break you receive, you still havent come up with a logical reason that tax break exists, if someone bought a $250,000 car they couldnt afford youd call that person, stupid https://twitter.com/soliduslives/status/946451569364541440
946454185972822016 2017-12-28 18:53:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Yes, children are a by product of Society, not the entire point of society. Society functions more or less as a collective, which each member contributing, which makes it funny when you say Im draining society when Im literally helping you to the point of economic disadvantage https://twitter.com/soliduslives/status/946451569364541440
946450303230074880 2017-12-28 18:38:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> My bio says Ex-Libertarian, I left that party in the mid/late 80s! Its completely laughable that you think Im a drain on society by paying my taxes to fund your kids while you get a government handout. Your logic is beyond faulty https://twitter.com/soliduslives/status/946448410088894464
946441280531427329 2017-12-28 18:02:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Yes, you are a drain on Society if youre sending your kids to public schools & using state & federal resources to raise those kids all the while receiving a tax break to do so. Yes, not having children I cant afford is the responsible thing to do https://twitter.com/soliduslives/status/946437783131897856
946435956437024768 2017-12-28 17:41:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No I isnt its merely stating a fact that this particular set of businesses are going to exploit a loophole they more than likely lobbied to get passed, one of the many in the Trump plan
946434815980724226 2017-12-28 17:36:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Whats laughable is you having to rely on government handouts to further the white race, Im responsible enough to pay my taxes at an unfair rate compared to families with children, all Im required to do. Trump almost changed that which is one of my 7 tenants https://twitter.com/soliduslives/status/946412288881319936
946433717127581697 2017-12-28 17:32:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Bro, people allowed to shift tax burden on to others is morally unfair, the tax was set up to favor those people. The funny thing is Trump is literally doing one of the 7 things I talked about, just didnt go far enough as usual. We have both a spending & revenue problem
946361709622628353 2017-12-28 12:46:28 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Big shockhttps://twitter.com/guardian/status/946359857589997569

946261814509297664 2017-12-27 06:09:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph It literally shifts the tax burden, somebody has to pick up that slack, it is a government handout that both you & I pay for.
946260828470349824 2017-12-27 06:05:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Companies main motive is profits thats why they dont do it & the fact that you think its in the National interest to promote child birth is laughable.  You conservatives love to have it both ways.
946258635583315968 2017-12-27 05:56:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Again you are showing you know nothing of economics, a tax break is an indirect subsidy, its literally the same as handing someone cash, its lowers the tax burden of one person & shifts it to another
946258077984133120 2017-12-27 05:54:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You are talking out of both sides of your mouth, youre ok with one subsidy but not another & if it was in the National interest to promote its own people why arent politicians fighting for higher wages for all & companies willingly paying more to promote a better country?
946253092261105665 2017-12-27 05:34:52 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Tax break for children is a subsidy just like welfare so yes they are the same, No, its not the Governments job to make sure people have babies, prime example of bloated government
946252440965406721 2017-12-27 05:32:17 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Bro, learn context & stop putting words in my mouth, never said you did nothing but youre be propped up by your company. You are winning the game but think you deserve more & blame other generations & races for the reason you arent
946250421663928320 2017-12-27 05:24:15 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No it isnt & if you truly believed that you wouldnt complain about welfare
946250099121848326 2017-12-27 05:22:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph And you still complain & think youve pull yourself up by your bootstraps & think your race is disadvantaged, 
946248161781342208 2017-12-27 05:15:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> You entitlement mentality makes me giggle, you cant come up with a good reason why that tax break exists & you think Im under some obligation to prop up the race financially.  Its all about personal responsibility if you cant afford children dont have them https://twitter.com/soliduslives/status/946229787856478208
946247361461755904 2017-12-27 05:12:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, Ive been living on my own since 18 working shit jobs making far less, Im also not stupid, if your being taxed at the rate you say you are, you havent done all the shit you say you have.
946173171765579778 2017-12-27 00:17:17 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Bro, as long as their is a functioning economy SSI will be here, you are spewing the same garbage Ive been hearing for 30+ years!  Until you produce that pay stub showing your 38% tax rate, I cant take you seriously about economics, not that I ever did, sorry
946169475140812802 2017-12-27 00:02:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph There is not a fixed amount of work, its the lump of labor fallacy
946168475688538112 2017-12-27 23:58:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Please retweet! @realDonaldTrump @Cernovich @JackPosobiec @CassandraRules @willchamberlain   Help this hero!https://twitter.com/militaryearth/status/945837808987512832
946165043502223360 2017-12-27 23:44:59 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph One of the reasons that happened is Obummer cut the payroll tax down to 4.2% for a couple years.  Uninformed? You literally stated youre taxed at a 38% rate on 50K of income, Im still waiting to see that pay stub or tax return. How you gonna preach about SSI spewing that crap
946162607760822272 2017-12-27 23:35:19 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Now were getting somewhere, key word  subsidizing which is what myself & the Government are doing, I have no problem funding the next gen, I have a problem with the tax break for children, its a lifestyle tax break. Period https://twitter.com/soliduslives/status/946159108582916097
946161563341385728 2017-12-27 23:31:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Gee, where have I heard that before? I know, every single year since I started working as a teenager, SSI will be broke in 15-20 years same old story, as long as people keep working it will be here.

946150494724132864 2017-12-27 22:47:11 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph And most of my generation will be working long into their late 60s/ early 70s which benefits you as they arent drawing SSI
946149337742151681 2017-12-27 22:42:35 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, you literally think youre paying for me, Im still putting in. SSI will be just fine
946147947481145344 2017-12-27 22:37:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, learn how social security works, Gen Z will be putting in for you like I am for the boomers
946147274945687558 2017-12-27 22:34:23 UTC <JohnQPublic30> I am fulfilling my obligation, by paying taxes, like my forefathers did. All Im required to do https://twitter.com/soliduslives/status/946146402056355840
946145047917072384 2017-12-27 22:25:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Disproportionately taxed, wheres my lifestyle subsidy?
946129865211895810 2017-12-27 21:25:12 UTC <JohnQPublic30> As I stated, Im being taxed at an unfair rate to support children that arent mine, if parents dont have time or money, they shouldnt have children, period. I owe no allegiance to my race or nation. https://twitter.com/soliduslives/status/946125677522182144
946122944908021767 2017-12-27 20:57:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> I pay taxes at an unfair rate because I dont have kids, my federal tax dollars go to educate,feed & keep these kids healthy. Im helping disproportionately https://twitter.com/soliduslives/status/946121144666435584

946102932537331712 2017-12-27 19:38:11 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 I believe hes eliminating the $4050 child deduction & replacing it with lower tax credits. Heres some math, 2010 census claims 74 million children under 18, at $4050 it comes to $299 billion $700 million in just one year. Thats crazy
946100018787762177 2017-12-27 19:26:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 The funny thing is,Tara. I believe Trumps tax plan disincentivizes people from having kids because they cant claim them.
946094521665777666 2017-12-27 19:04:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Were not Germany, why do you need to shift the tax burden onto other people? I should get the tax break, I have no kids chewing up state & federal resources https://twitter.com/soliduslives/status/946093542119575552

946090432945180672 2017-12-27 18:48:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Not seeking approval, just want a level playing field, people getting tax breaks for having children shifts the tax burden on to me, unfairly. https://twitter.com/taramccarthy444/status/946089059847249920
946087134087270402 2017-12-27 18:35:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 Nothing is stopping you from paying more taxes, IRS wont send to money back, Im tired of being at an economic disadvantage because Im responsible & didnt have kids I couldnt afford.
946085306738069505 2017-12-27 18:28:09 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @soliduslives The government shouldnt give you a subsidy to achieve this goal, if you cant afford kids without government support dont have them
946084919687696385 2017-12-27 18:26:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 Because its a government subsidy, I dont believe in giving a subsidy for a lifestyle choice.
946083623253479424 2017-12-27 18:21:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 Married couples already get large financial incentives, what are you even talking about, end the IRS child tax deduction, NOW. Trump is moving in the right path on this

943671582072942593 2017-12-20 02:36:52 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yeah, as I said were not paying $35 an hour for an intern, weve tried that route, waste of time,money & resources
943671180610949120 2017-12-20 02:35:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Probably partially explains why your company is in perpetual debt, we try hard to promote from within, but were not going to pay a newbie $35 to feel his way around, no time or money
943669738378547200 2017-12-20 02:29:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No one will do that job for free & we cant afford the risk & time to train people so they will leave.
943668709801037824 2017-12-20 02:25:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, you dont get it. Our maintenance staff are the highest paid in the building $35 an hour, most new hires simply dont have the skills to do the job, you have to be able to fabricate stuff on the fly at my plant
943667285851541505 2017-12-20 02:19:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Bro, you dont manufacture anything, I deal with a wide range of companies from all over the globe, theyre all having the same problem, finding qualified, skilled labor. My company will join them as our maintenance staff as aging & we cant find quality techs
943664702583959552 2017-12-20 02:09:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Bro, one sector does not speak for the country.
943661946024448000 2017-12-20 01:58:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Carrier played Trump like they played Obummer in 2013
943661681699426306 2017-12-20 01:57:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The outlier as Ive said, some of our vendors still plan on scaling back, major MRO suppliers, were still having problems getting equipment in a timely manner
943659564662231040 2017-12-20 01:49:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Look at Carrier in Indiana, this is all PR bullshit, easy to spot. Its great PR for these companies
943659055180058624 2017-12-20 01:47:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No, they dont increase each year & most companies generally plan in 5 years windows.  We had to push back a couple of capex projects cause we couldnt get the equipment in time
943656223651651584 2017-12-20 01:35:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph All companies do that at beginning of the year, most companies stop CapEx around November/December unless its small stuff
943654949602430983 2017-12-20 01:30:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph All signs are saying otherwise, 2018 could be rocky
943652175493951489 2017-12-20 01:19:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph See, what your missing is, the market could have bore the rise to $15, the money has always been there, theyll need that extra cash in 2018, inflation is coming
943650473361465344 2017-12-20 01:12:59 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Im not a Trump dick rider like you & i remember you conservatives bitching about $15 an hour when Bernie was running so this shit makes me giggle, I guess its WHOS raising the wage not the wage being risen
943648120734453760 2017-12-20 01:03:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph They thought that about Reagans Cuts & he started walking them back in 1982, Why? The country had a revenue problem, BTW, the economy tanked after he made those cuts
943647473515618306 2017-12-20 01:01:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph All these press releases say nothing about raising wages except Well Fargo & they just laid off people, This is PR bullshit just like Carrier in Indiana

943609970926538752 2017-12-20 22:32:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> All that says is these employers have been sitting on cash & could have been paying their workers more & boosting the economyhttps://twitter.com/stefanmolyneux/status/943605894197202944

943513813554548742 2017-12-20 16:09:57 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, Ive told you in the past I had a huge IRS & state tax beef, from 1998-2003 I wasnt paying my taxes, my 5 year tax bill didnt come up to the amount you paid in taxes last year, sorry Im calling BS
943508931212701696 2017-12-20 15:50:33 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Im calling BS on this, I made slightly less than you, live in a higher tax state, with no deductions, 1040ez & I paid nowhere near that.
943507169311383552 2017-12-20 15:43:33 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You paid $19,000 in state taxes last year?

942798980068585472 2017-12-18 16:49:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Ummm, it was a republican that introduced the bill, you are being disingenuous here, Clinton should not have signed it, as I have said a million times, Democrats & Republicans are blood brothers when it comes to certain fiscal issues.

Id have to see your tweet & the account you tweeted. Sometimes it just takes a bigger account to take you down if their followers band together

I hated immigrants, thought taxation was theft & I thought I was over taxed. I grew outta it

940355971817320454 2017-12-11 23:01:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Bro, not all threats are criminal, as the link stated the threats were non violent therefore do not fall under MN terroristic threats statute.
940351469039087619 2017-12-11 22:43:55 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Bro, read the link, the threats were non violent so more than likely not criminal, insults are just words, MAN UP

939940977221033984 2017-12-10 19:32:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NPR @wolfgang_joseph Dude, theyve been studying this for decades, if blacks had a genetic trait that lead to infant deaths than the foreign born mothers would have same rate, they dont its on par with whites
939937400255664129 2017-12-10 19:18:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NPR @wolfgang_joseph No it isnt, they searched for pre term birth genes, the results were tiny & didnt fit well in racial categories, low foreign mortality rates tell the same story
939935185826656256 2017-12-10 19:09:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NPR @wolfgang_joseph Incorrect, studies have shown foreign born blacks have similar rates as whites, in the 90s they all but eliminated genetics as a cause due to the fact the genetic variations in humans are tiny

939925350649384960 2017-12-10 18:30:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NPR @wolfgang_joseph So your saying blacks are inferior & more prone to have higher infant mortality rates 
939924900214706176 2017-12-10 18:28:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NPR @wolfgang_joseph Yes, for whites, for blacks it remains unchanged
939923416886456320 2017-12-10 18:23:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NPR @wolfgang_joseph Dude, its a Theory thats being floated because its unexplainable here in America, seemly healthy mothers having high infant mortality rates along with a higher rate of black mothers dying during birth.
939921655618469888 2017-12-10 18:16:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NPR @wolfgang_joseph So what, Im taking America. Were supposed to be the best
939920042845704192 2017-12-10 18:09:35 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The reality is most whites are blaming other people for their problems, Trump seized on this. I have no sympathy for white people, we own the world, we won the lottery

939915769680482304 2017-12-10 17:52:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Because they have a degree they dont have racism against them? Thats outrageous

939271027540004865 2017-12-08 23:10:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, it is still discrimination, the white owned companies are telling....no forcing the temp service not to hire black workers.
939265284359237638 2017-12-08 22:47:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph From the linkpic.twitter.com/DmRDaAJ6hd
939265172815925255 2017-12-08 22:47:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Lawsuit filedhttp://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-discrimination-temporary-staffing-1207-biz-20161206-story.html
939264078454972421 2017-12-08 22:43:01 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Never claimed 90% was solely than reason but they are being discriminated against
939258750568927233 2017-12-08 22:21:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Umm, you should probably research that
939242292744998917 2017-12-08 21:16:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph And you dont get to talk outta both sides of your mouth about immigration, Ive been hearing about Chicago since the 80s when you say life was easier & immigration was lower!
939239516723871745 2017-12-08 21:05:25 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Because a lot of business are purposely not hiring blacks, a temp company is being sued because of it.
939236334199336961 2017-12-08 20:52:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Because theres  no jobs in Chicago & there hasnt been for 30 plus years.  Dont talk to me about Chicago like I dont & havent been knowing whats been going on there for 3 generations.
939234145955471360 2017-12-08 20:44:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph So no need for the wall, lets do it without the wall & see if the Whites can pick up the slack. I look forward to seeing some young white millennials pick crops & clean toilets
939232069535916033 2017-12-08 20:35:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I say lets cut down on immigration, which is happening without the wall & see if some of these whites already here with do those shit jobs, if not than maybe being in a few SAs to pick crops & clean toilets.
939228389801635840 2017-12-08 20:21:12 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I never said anyone about Mexicans, which I dont really have a problem with,very hard workers.  Sounds like you want to do a straight up trade for reasons I cant understand.
939225920921055235 2017-12-08 20:11:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I highly doubt high skilled researchers are being slaughtered like flies, the numbers are over blown & they should stay where they are
939224188916727808 2017-12-08 20:04:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph So, how does this explain why we should take them into our country & have them take jobs from Americans?
939221387826335745 2017-12-08 19:53:23 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph And you know this how? Its funny cause in your previous tweets you never mentioned economics, only that there was a white genocide happening. If they cant make it there how they gonna make it here?
939214847295844352 2017-12-08 19:27:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I sincerely doubt those stats & Ill ask again, am I supposed to care solely because they are white? Why should our country take them in?
939205612705058817 2017-12-08 18:50:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph White Genocide propaganda, also Im I supposed to care solely because they are white?
939201862124883969 2017-12-08 18:35:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph First, they arent being cleansed & Im supposed to care cause they are white. 
939199776159039489 2017-12-08 18:27:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Fuckem, I love you guys that dont think these people will be on the dole & will assimilate, I have Russians at my job who make no effort & a family in my building on the dole cause the male wont work.
939198508338380800 2017-12-08 18:22:28 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yet, you want to bring white South Africans & Polish people here, you make no sense.
939197159353802752 2017-12-08 18:17:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Bro, Ive literally watched jobs disappear due to automation, I hate playing this card, Ive got 25 years work experience on you, Ive seen more, Brown people are not your boogeyman. Your toting the Trump company line which is BS.
939194748417597440 2017-12-08 18:07:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Due to automation which has displaced workers, I saw that shit coming in the 90s as I saw the jobs dying out.
939192150369161216 2017-12-08 17:57:12 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Half the workload WTF are you talking about
939189787432546305 2017-12-08 17:47:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, those jobs were shit jobs in the 80s like they are now, always half & half when I worked them
939188371129323522 2017-12-08 17:42:11 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yeah, there were no immigrants in 1989 
939185820052983808 2017-12-08 17:32:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph $13 an hour, I was making that in 1989 doing same work! 
939185373036544000 2017-12-08 17:30:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Very low standards? Dude, they fire a ton of people, if you dont make quota, you are out the door
939183307983638528 2017-12-08 17:22:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph With high turnover rate, that wage sucks for what they expect
939181036696752128 2017-12-08 17:13:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I think they are still the largest private employer in USA.
939177587515056129 2017-12-08 16:59:20 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Theres always going to be a percentage of working poor on food stamps, as long as theres employers like Walmart
939175702578057216 2017-12-08 16:51:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Thats literally what I said in my tweet
939175400198103040 2017-12-08 16:50:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Ive had whites come right up to me & my girl & calling me a N-lover more times then I can count & with the middle eastern woman Ive dated, forget about it
939165622486949888 2017-12-08 16:11:47 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Funny, Ive lived 50 years & never had a racial slur or attitude directed my way by any of those groups, but see plenty of the reverse
939165157992824833 2017-12-08 16:09:57 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Most are Hispanics taking themselves off the rolls.
939162084419555335 2017-12-08 15:57:44 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph A good majority of people on SNAP are working, they are below the poverty line
939161823634436097 2017-12-08 15:56:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, if you dont think theres racism, youve gone mental. Ive experienced it everywhere Ive gone.
939157789968142336 2017-12-08 15:40:40 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, anybody who wants a job can get one especially if your white, my friend has been out of work force for 20 years & he found a job with first application
939155588554088448 2017-12-08 15:31:55 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, look at past 9 years, the numbers dont look that different, Im far from impressed, looks like Obamas wage growth
939154027291512834 2017-12-08 15:25:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph We give set raises, 90 days, 6 months & 1 year than cost of living after that with a few exceptions. We use temps because it saves us millions on labor costs & overhead
939151577021022208 2017-12-08 15:15:59 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Most businesses try not to cut wages, unless business really slows down, they will freeze before cutting & they try to avoid month to month raises. That creates work for payroll & managers.
939149528011329536 2017-12-08 15:07:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Because Im not on the production floor.
939149211299405827 2017-12-08 15:06:35 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph So far Im unimpressed, Trumps wage numbers dont look all that different than last 8 years
939144075932061698 2017-12-08 14:46:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Thats a dollar less that those folks have to spend.
939142543949946881 2017-12-08 14:40:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Thats total, wages in manufacturing dropped 4 cents
939137086086696961 2017-12-08 14:18:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph As I stated two days ago, wages in manufacturing dropped, hence the lower labor costs for units produced
939097340920680448 2017-12-08 11:40:28 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Mike, you are obsessed with celebrities & CNN. Turn off the TV!https://twitter.com/cernovich/status/938900601609392128
939096983003901952 2017-12-08 11:39:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> I seriously doubt this took placehttps://twitter.com/gaminganarchist/status/938435129978081280
938877956038021120 2017-12-07 21:08:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Are the ladies from En Vogue still bang worthy? Asking for a friend
938871621909086208 2017-12-07 20:43:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yup, something which she was attracted to, Trumps pussy grabbing tape explains abuse of power step by step, its like a tutorial on how to abuse power
938865065599602688 2017-12-07 20:17:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph 22 years old is an adult & she knew exactly what she was doing, you conservatives love to preach personal responsibility except when it benefits your narrative I.e Monica
938861071330312192 2017-12-07 20:01:37 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I dont like the Rights hypocrisy nor the lefts faux holier than thou attitude they have.
938860663631466496 2017-12-07 20:00:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You are proving my point about conservatives, you cant even get her age right, she was 22 not 19.
938859749742923776 2017-12-07 19:56:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Again, Im not running for President & you are bring disingenuous about Trump if he was a Democrat (which he was for many many years) your side would be flipping out about his behavior.
938857516603232256 2017-12-07 19:47:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, hes on tape talking about grabbing pussy, if he was a Democrat & had won, right wingers would have lost their minds, I still have conservative friends who bring up Clinton & Lewinsky
938855453886439424 2017-12-07 19:39:17 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If you really did, Trump & Moore would be nowhere near public office, if they were democrats youd call for their heads
938837587757817856 2017-12-07 18:28:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Watching @MichaelRapaport on Friends right now, Rachel would have never dated Ross, not in a million years
938827849892581376 2017-12-07 17:49:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Democrats have to learn, conservatives dont give a fuck what their candidates do as long as they have that (R) by the name
938821972917673984 2017-12-07 17:26:15 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Hence my tweet
938821318656643073 2017-12-07 17:23:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Thats because conservative Republicans are scum & always double down on their misbehavior, they never capitulate.https://twitter.com/buzzfeednews/status/938815803075444736
938820202380365826 2017-12-07 17:19:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Another stupid move by the milquetoast Democratic Party.https://twitter.com/buzzfeednews/status/938814748803477505
938814416270909442 2017-12-07 16:56:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph First, gateway pundit isnt news, you might as well have posted a Salon link.  Second, yes, jobs were added & productivity is up, but as I said the labor to produce those unit are down .2 when they expected a rise of .3 which means wages arent going up as expected
938776392640102403 2017-12-07 14:25:08 UTC <JohnQPublic30> ANTIFA?https://twitter.com/jackposobiec/status/938772552184483840
938673915223793664 2017-12-06 07:37:55 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, stock buy backs have been fueling this economy for 8 plus years, corporate profits were never higher under Obama, its easy money, paying workers is a loss on the books, I think corporations will continue the same course because if it aint broke dont fix it
938670640248352768 2017-12-06 07:24:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The numbers are telling a different story, productivity went up as units produced labor costs went down. The big question is will these corporations spend on wages or buying back stock like theyve been doing for years, Wall Street is betting on stock buy back
938667649789243392 2017-12-06 07:13:01 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Thats your company, it is the outlier. Trade deficit keeps raising under Trump, not a good sign, wages are flat & look to be flat again this quarter, all negative signs that shouldnt be ignored
938661586092380160 2017-12-06 06:48:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Then they would be exporting those goods which isnt happening hence the largest trade deficit in 5 years, early indications are jobs report looks ok, but wages are not rising
938659250640965632 2017-12-06 06:39:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Some early productivity numbers came out for Q3 & they dont look good, non farm productivity rose by 3% but there was a drop in units labor, costs fell by .2 when they expected them to rise by .3, coupled with the rising trade deficit these numbers are not that Rosey
938648795163832320 2017-12-06 05:58:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph It doesnt matter if they shut down programs if they are spending more money on other shit, we have a revenue problem, you either increase your revenue or you cut spending & this plan does neither
938646130853900288 2017-12-06 05:47:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, that plan will add $1.4 trillion to the debt, you cant reduce revenue without shrinking the size of Government, Trump is not doing that, hes just moving money around
938551889142173696 2017-12-06 23:33:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Conservatives are something else!https://twitter.com/nydailynews/status/938432865754378241
938543413166788608 2017-12-06 22:59:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Its hard to explain because you cant & you dont want to go against the cult like Trump group think, you complain about past generations kicking the can down the road & Trump did just that, like all administrations do.
938538569123102721 2017-12-06 22:40:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Cernovich Youre part of that game, Mike.   All media is trash
938538107623919616 2017-12-06 22:38:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @The_Real_Fly @TheBubbleBubble Oh boy, these people have no idea whats coming. 
938534940337229825 2017-12-06 22:25:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The Right is making the same mistakes they always make, the tax plan is a joke, Reagan era economics
938530453069422593 2017-12-06 22:07:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @wolfgang_joseph You do understand your far right takeover will not end well for both sides, USA is becoming like Europe
938529122908766209 2017-12-06 22:02:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @wolfgang_joseph Im talking about the brewing conflicts between left & right
938527041561026560 2017-12-06 21:54:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @wolfgang_joseph Yup, its falling apart a little slower than I thought, but its crumbling none the less
938512410700406784 2017-12-06 20:56:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @wolfgang_joseph You should probably brush up on Minnesota, no other state like it.
938509384040308737 2017-12-06 20:44:08 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @wolfgang_joseph Minnesota is a prime example of the saying there are no blue states, just cities big enough to flip them blue Trump won every county but 9 & still couldnt flip it red.
938503936717312000 2017-12-06 20:22:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @wolfgang_joseph By who?

937813947322961922 2017-12-04 22:40:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Its been a bubble for at least 8 years, dude just because Trump got into office doesnt mean the bubble stopped, Trump, himself called it a bubble during the election & most economists say its still a bubble

937739353215946752 2017-12-04 17:44:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph And theyll get smoked when the bottom falls out of the market, these homes are overvalued & the income doesnt match

937734429950267393 2017-12-04 17:24:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> This is such a key point, when the housing bubble popped, I knew whole neighborhoods of men that suddenly became out of workhttps://twitter.com/thebubblebubble/status/937733449615659008

937477754257321985 2017-12-03 00:24:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Which bolsters my point, you didnt hear Obama running his mouth about the investigations, Trump is President now, he needs to shut the fuck up about certain things
937475998932721664 2017-12-03 00:17:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Again Obama administration investigations, also these investigations arent all that uncommon

936151599495380993 2017-11-30 08:35:08 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Time to open the spigots & let the dark money flow, Adelson, Kochs & Mercers must be jerking off thinking about this. Conservatives are truly scum of the earth.http://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2017/11/29/johnson-amendment-nonprofits

936013553483550721 2017-11-29 23:26:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If that was the Objective theyd just kill them, they pick those people cause they wont fight back, its a stupid game but if the goal was to kill theyd do it
936012833896194049 2017-11-29 23:23:44 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, the price of gas alone has eaten my raise up not to mention the rising cost of food
936012098097893377 2017-11-29 23:20:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph For Fuck Sake, the point of the knockout game is not murder its hyperbole on your part. In 20 some states you have to make an effort to retreat, FL which is a strong stand your ground state, defendants go to prison 30% of the time
936011300613885952 2017-11-29 23:17:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph My income has increased but not at the pace of my rising everyday living expenses
936006011571273728 2017-11-29 22:56:37 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph 1) All media is trash including Cernovich,PJW & the like  2) Could care less about college, its overblown 3) Im not going to stop watching Hollywood, its entertainment, I can separate the two  4) Im literally poorer since Trump took office, I have less disposable income
936005086815445003 2017-11-29 22:52:57 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Defend not kill & not every state is a state you ground state.
935997236705677312 2017-11-29 22:21:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Not in every case, every state is different

935924071539277824 2017-11-29 17:31:01 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Brand building, yuk, there are some people on here & YouTube that take themselves way too seriously, thats why on my YouTube channel I call myself a douche bag with an iPhone & wi-if Connection  we are all just commentators
935921553878986752 2017-11-29 17:21:01 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yup, I used to take it seriously but not anymore.
935920113848594433 2017-11-29 17:15:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I dont care about followers,TBH, its pointless ever since the Leslie Jones incident, my first account I lost many followers after that crack down, ever since than I went from 700 down to 380 or so
935918320368410624 2017-11-29 17:08:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Thats why with the exception of you, I rarely engage with accounts with less than 500 followers, otherwise I just scroll past
935914947791515648 2017-11-29 16:54:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph LE isnt going to concern itself with the losers on this app, unless it goes real world & even then they roll their eyes. First hand experience
935912824227983361 2017-11-29 16:46:20 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Also, LE doesnt really take Twitter threats seriously, unless it crosses into real world
935910996396380160 2017-11-29 16:39:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Meaningless, they would just open a new account.
935910041672208386 2017-11-29 16:35:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph It will never completely die, but the fact people think Twitter will help them like a daddy is laughable
935909578801401856 2017-11-29 16:33:26 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph One quarter, Obama had a quarter that hit 5% in 2014 I think, its all fed fueled
935908581651689473 2017-11-29 16:29:28 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Twitter will never help you, I know I have experience in this
935907378230431744 2017-11-29 16:24:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Interesting, all four times I had death threats from RWers, got similar response but from a human with the suggestion to contact law enforcement,
935906465713459200 2017-11-29 16:21:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Hence the term reasonable force you have a right to defend your property regardless if perp is man or woman.
935905904565907456 2017-11-29 16:18:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph They never suggested you contact law enforcement?
935894098795466752 2017-11-29 15:31:55 UTC <JohnQPublic30> So I guess the entire United States of America has turned into a Human Resources Department. 
935882552451239936 2017-11-29 14:46:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @lucianwintrich @willchamberlain Will, does same principal apply the the girl who stole MAGA hat in CA, could he have used reasonable force as well?
935878441517371397 2017-11-29 14:29:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Yes, twitter needs a sarcasm font as wellhttps://twitter.com/thebubblebubble/status/935699444997197825

935675585736642566 2017-11-28 01:03:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realJamesAllsup @wolfgang_joseph Actually they can, Im quite sure they had a legal team draw up their TOS. I dont agree with what they are doing but the TOS is pretty clear

935360647101116416 2017-11-27 04:12:11 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem When Uncle Hotep says Shine=1 drink Akata=1 drink Trump Train=1 drink Nig Nog=1 drink USS Liberty=1 shot  Benghazi=1 drink False Flag=1 drink Hoteps been told you=1 shot  Mentions fatherless children=1 drink Tells you to burn your Nikes=1 shot Defends white folk=1 drink

935293354023227394 2017-11-27 23:44:47 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph We rely on temps, its up to the temp service to check them out, our facility has cut payroll by $1.5 million in last 3 years, employees accounts for approx 65% of our facilities overhead in a year
935291291109380098 2017-11-27 23:36:35 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Most of the jobs at our facility take far less skill than a fast food employee so why would we pay top dollar, it literally defeats the purpose of buying the automated lines
935286658819293185 2017-11-27 23:18:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, weve been in business since 1969, the good employees are in management or vital support positions like mine. Do you think Fast Food workers should be high paid, $15 & up?
935284720400728064 2017-11-27 23:10:28 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph 70% of our facilitys jobs are dummy work, we wont pay more than temp wages by design
935282630223941632 2017-11-27 23:02:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Very rarely, we love the flexibility
935281118009536514 2017-11-27 22:56:09 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Nope, theyll have another temp service come in, millions of temp services out there. We use 3 & have at least two come in a month looking for our business

932068687007420416 2017-11-18 02:11:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Sometimes you just got to be an adult & let things roll, thats the problem I have with woman, its situational with most & they cant let things roll
932067449490628608 2017-11-18 02:06:11 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Then you dont know what you are talking about, discrimination cases against companys are very difficult to win, my attorney said the success rate is like 2%
932066647673843712 2017-11-18 02:03:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Have you ever filed a discrimination lawsuit against a company?
932066327250046976 2017-11-18 02:01:44 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The point Im making is Ive literally had things like Franken did done to me by woman thousands of times through out my life, huge double standard & Tomis tweet reinforces that double standard
932065382298476545 2017-11-18 01:57:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, Im a white male, I know how the game is played, already went through a discrimination case. No thanks
932063530496483328 2017-11-18 01:50:37 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I dont like to pick scabs on here, but I get sexually harassed at my job at least twice a month
932062309056475136 2017-11-18 01:45:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I was being serious, I think the shit thats been going on the last month is complete BS, Ive already touched on this in some earlier tweets, woman are not innocent in this game.
932061096562909184 2017-11-18 01:40:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Sorry, thats how I take that tweet.
932060423502925829 2017-11-18 01:38:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> So your saying its situational, typical woman speak, always leave the door open so you can have it both ways.https://twitter.com/tomilahren/status/931629249424793600

932056473269612544 2017-11-18 01:22:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Do you have a problem with the the tweets I send her?
932055984830337024 2017-11-18 01:20:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Do you think Franken should resign or be expelled?
932054848685699072 2017-11-18 01:16:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Sorry dude, if that was your daughter going up that escalator, youd have a problem with what Trump said, Im not buying you dont care about that, you dont care because its Trump
932053581422845952 2017-11-18 01:11:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Im not running for public office, its the double standard you conservatives have when it comes to your tribe
932053152148459521 2017-11-18 01:09:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, you can be boorish without talking about dating young girls
932052262339448832 2017-11-18 01:05:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Hes has some sexual hang ups, his comments about woman, especially young woman are very telling
932050957843746817 2017-11-18 01:00:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph All things that point to bizarre behavior, people like that usually channel that to other behaviors
932049970496200704 2017-11-18 00:56:44 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You trump supporters are so cultish it makes me giggle
932049102837288960 2017-11-18 00:53:17 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You really think hes pious & clean dont you?
932048127137386502 2017-11-18 00:49:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The funny thing is you think Trump is the cure.

931921212225318913 2017-11-18 16:25:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Serious question, whats your goal with Trump? Lay out you end game, be specific

931625648455593984 2017-11-17 20:50:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, the producer price index was up 0.4% for 2nd month in a row, for the year its up 2.8 %  highest in 6-7 years, rising prices is never a good thing
931587871294750720 2017-11-17 18:20:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If that happens & its not, Plus inflation pressures are starting to show, the cost of making products is rising
931582418598944768 2017-11-17 17:58:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph This the rub, people vote with their pocket books, See I understand my 7 point plan is wildly unpopular with both sides because it takes money out of their pockets, both sides love their hand outs
931578243643265030 2017-11-17 17:42:15 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, this is where hell run into problems, you or I dont own a home, the people I know who do are pissed about this tax plan & they all voted for Trump. They will lose money
931577095381307392 2017-11-17 17:37:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Actually Trumps proposed regulatory budget is a 3.4% increase over Obamas, business as usual
931567428521353216 2017-11-17 16:59:17 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I would if things were being torn down, hes showing glimpses of hope, proposing taking away scientologys tax break a start, hes singling them out, needs to take all religious tax breaks away not just theirs
931556093884497920 2017-11-17 16:14:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph So what, another bunch of crooks & scammers will take their place with no real change, I have no issue with your side tearing down the system, its what you are building I object to. You want to continue with business as usual
931544207860404228 2017-11-17 15:27:01 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I have no tribe, Im not registered for any party, I dont like any of the swamp creatures both sides put into power & I want to make changes, radical changes
931541372804485120 2017-11-17 15:15:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Well shes part of your tribe, so you understand how this looks to people.
931540983254220801 2017-11-17 15:14:12 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Styx666Official You mean like some kind of audio tape describing the same behavior? Lets have just one standard
931534803777806338 2017-11-17 14:49:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Authoritarianism in action, welcome to @realDonaldTrump s new vision of America, where liberty & freedom no longer existhttps://twitter.com/foxnews/status/931532289896525824
931529991459954688 2017-11-17 14:30:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Actually it is, but you wouldnt understand that, because its all about bending people to accept your values & way of life.
931528169466802176 2017-11-17 14:23:17 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, Im far more libertarian than most I run across on the right & I get labeled a leftist, which is a joke, check my pinned tweet for proof of that, Im literally the exact opposite of your girl, Tree. Shes an unapologetic authoritarian
931518907378171906 2017-11-17 13:46:28 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Then people like her, Paul Joseph Watson & Molynuex should stay out of our business than & most conservatives have a strong authoritarian streak in them anyway
931514381162176512 2017-11-17 13:28:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Well, she is a conservative & a prominent one at that. Who favors bigger government, just another example of how conservatives favor bigger government when it benefits them
931512088102604801 2017-11-17 13:19:23 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Look at the replies, many agree with her, shes one of yours, are you disavowing her?
931511728130723840 2017-11-17 13:17:57 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TomiLahren @FoxNewsInsider This rule applies to woman as well, Tomi
931507950576955392 2017-11-17 13:02:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Id call Faith here a conservative. https://twitter.com/faithgoldy/status/930949401798901762
931503600605515776 2017-11-17 12:45:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph All inherent problems with the business model, but little to do with the fact that many conservatives want to make this platform & many others a public utility
931501863538778112 2017-11-17 12:38:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Not really, when it states in their TOS that they will revise their TOS from time to time & your continued use of service is your agreement to said revisions
931500373969424385 2017-11-17 12:32:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph It sounds like youre not a capitalist, twitter has the right to change their TOS, being on Twitter is not a binding contractual agreement.
931499027912384513 2017-11-17 12:27:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Funny, I never signed a contract to be on here.  Are you saying businesses cant change their operating structure?
931496296694861824 2017-11-17 12:16:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Twitters behavior is funny because it puts conservative free-market capitalists in a bind

931433560816439296 2017-11-17 08:07:20 UTC <JohnQPublic30> What the fuck are you talking about 60% of House Dems & like 88% of Dems in senate voted yes on you huge defense budget, giving you more than you asked for. https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/931355543096233985

931424639275937792 2017-11-16 07:31:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> The fake outrage from conservatives now that sexual assault scandals are now hitting D.C is fun to watch especially after the person that voted into office. This will only push more people away from politics.

931018508720332800 2017-11-15 04:38:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @benshapiro @wolfgang_joseph No, its a public safety issue, there are 8 major food allergens that make up 90% of cases, that why they need to be labeled so people can make the informed decision. Not complicated
931016523401089024 2017-11-15 04:30:11 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @benshapiro @wolfgang_joseph No, but products that contain milk do! This is just another case of you not knowing what you are talking about & how things work.
931014816990457856 2017-11-15 04:23:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @benshapiro @wolfgang_joseph The product in question contained traces of cashews in a bag marked peanuts & you seriously dont think thats a problem

931008470727446528 2017-11-15 03:58:11 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @benshapiro @wolfgang_joseph Still needs to be labeled, thats why theres a recall

930571474821439488 2017-11-14 23:01:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Bullshit, for 3 weeks before election oil was over $50 & prices didnt budge, I watch gas prices very closely, I run my budget tight, also you are making assumptions about the policies
930547752815267840 2017-11-14 21:27:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @PrisonPlanet @TriggerzM A game both MAGA & Antifa play, you both try & shut people down.
930547437437112320 2017-11-14 21:26:12 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @PrisonPlanet @TriggerzM Did you deal with them with snappy comebacks? Im guessing, No!
930493623724015618 2017-11-14 17:52:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @PrisonPlanet @TriggerzM Favoring strict obedience to authority esp government authority, look dipshit, no one is taking u r free speech, if u want to walk down a sidewalk & call somebodys mother a whore go for it, if said person pops your mouth I have no sympathy for you. Get it
930475871248502791 2017-11-14 16:41:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @PrisonPlanet @TriggerzM I have no problem with any race getting popped in the mouth, words, context & tone have meaning & consequences. If you cant back up you mouth, you should probably keep it closed, you sound like a millennial.
930467819841605632 2017-11-14 16:09:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @PrisonPlanet @TriggerzM I think you missed the point where the white boy was chirping & couldnt back up his words.  The brother fucked up twice, first he should have just blasted the white boy straight out the gate  Second, he had no situational awareness.
930445619067486208 2017-11-14 14:41:37 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @PrisonPlanet @TriggerzM Ahh, cute you went with a your mom comeback. #PlayedOut

930440209866608640 2017-11-14 14:20:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @PrisonPlanet @TriggerzM So you dont have the interracial beatdown ratio for Hispanics vs White? Surprising I figured youd have all the interracial breakdowns

930429916981661696 2017-11-14 13:39:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @PrisonPlanet @TriggerzM Wasnt a argument, it was a comment about what a little bitch the white boy is

930237324268580864 2017-11-13 00:53:55 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Keep drinking the kool aid, Trump is an elitist, he gives less than a shit about the plight of the common man.

930235133088681990 2017-11-13 00:45:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, Trump is in office now, the shitty part of the job is when things go south you take the blame, my issue is, his silence on the matter, It shows me he doesnt care about the average American citizen

930232947181084673 2017-11-13 00:36:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, the month leading up to the election oil was $50 & gas prices stayed at or around $2.00 a gal, since Election Day theyve been rising even when the price of oil has dropped. The facts are people are paying more at the pump now vs a year ago, not debatable
930232023679164416 2017-11-13 00:32:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph From the link I sent earlier, dude, everyone in CA comes to the same conclusion, theyre being gouged.

930106760156864513 2017-11-13 16:15:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The national average is up 14%, this is not debatable, you have been touting Trumps tax cuts, $200 to put in peoples pockets,right? You know where it will go? Right to the oil companies. Your indifference on this subject is telling
930104009611935744 2017-11-13 16:04:11 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph It was 45 & in March & July it went from in the low 50s back down to 44-45 & prices didnt drop where I live so that tells me something is going on.
930102499637383171 2017-11-13 15:58:11 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, March & July, oil prices dropped to Election Day levels for 3-4 weeks & prices did not fall, do you not understand you are paying 8% more at the pump,
930101372036534272 2017-11-13 15:53:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Its up 8% in VA since & nationwide its up 14% compared to a year ago. Where is Trumps anger & passion about this? Oh thats right hes busy playing identity politics, meanwhile the country is suffering.
930098945841422337 2017-11-13 15:44:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Read the link I sent you, all those numbers were done before CA new tax went into effect, you say gas in VA is $2.20 what was it on Election Day?

930089288770912257 2017-11-13 15:05:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Why isnt he calling for them to be fired? Because hes an elitist, he cares nothing for me or the common man, I follow the Stock market but that doesnt effect my life, the price of gas,milk, bread & eggs do, the staples of life.
930088485456941056 2017-11-13 15:02:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Im getting hammered, so is CA, Im up 30% since Election Day, Im literally Trumps base, angry middle aged white male, he was passionate about NFL players kneeling, wheres his passion for the common man? Why isnt he calling the oil producers in this country SOBs?

930058948996206597 2017-11-13 13:05:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Hes more concerned with NFL players kneeling than he is about the American people being fucked over, hes an elitist prick.
930058486423187458 2017-11-13 13:03:17 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Twice during last 12 months oil prices have dropped to pre election prices yet prices at pump did not drop, CA is being price gouged right now. This is why I didnt vote for that POS Trump, he could give a shit about the common man, hes made no mention of the pain we are feeling
930053647043571712 2017-11-13 12:44:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph There appears to be no reason for increased production costs, all signs point to collusion on the part of refineries to slow production & drive up prices.
930034533336010752 2017-11-13 11:28:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yes, a new tax was imposed, but refineries are deliberately slowing down production in CA, everyone in CA agrees they are being gouged.http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-gas-price-20171110-story.html
930032561144909824 2017-11-13 11:20:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, California is being price gouged as we speak, no, gas prices arent that complicated until the market is being manipulated which is whats happening right now.
929986617342914560 2017-11-13 08:17:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, the month leading up to Election Crude was $50 a barrel & prices stayed at or near $2.00 a gal, several times between Nov 2016-17 price of crude has gone down to Election Night prices but price did not drop. So Im not buying your excuse
929865866480635904 2017-11-12 00:17:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yes, but the market corrected itself immediately, so that theory doesnt hold water, went from $2.00-2.09 in 12 hours & hasnt corrected itself in a year.
929863864627458049 2017-11-12 00:09:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The bigger question is why OPEC reduced production, Trump is running the show now, when things go south he takes the blame like every other President before him, rules dont change for him. I dont Believe in coincidences, gas shot up literally the morning after he was elected
929858501547102209 2017-11-12 23:48:37 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Trump has proven to be a market manipulator ever since he took office, hes not on TV lording over some D-list celebrities anymore, hes fucking with peoples livelihoods, yes, you are right it is about me, I dont like people fucking with my money.
929850987841556480 2017-11-12 23:18:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If Trump was positively impacting the market, prices would drop, they arent & more than likely wont, even so Ill never recoup my losses
929849821216804865 2017-11-12 23:14:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I know why the prices went down, the facts are republicans blamed Obama for the high gas prices, you know this is fact. Its unfortunate but gas prices rose under Trump, his administration, his blame. Throw out all the data you want, Americans are worse off right now.
929847424293703680 2017-11-12 23:04:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, the summer of 2008, gas was $4.11 a gallon, Obama brought that down to $2.00 a gallon, where I live it stayed down for quite a long time, he brought down fuel prices not raised them
929845755996712961 2017-11-12 22:57:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No, the facts speak for themselves, me & millions of Americans are literally poorer now than when Trump took office. Yall blamed Obama for high gas prices when he first took office, its part of the game.

929813235238342657 2017-11-12 20:48:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Cernovich Oh for fucks sake, Mike, nobody is that important on here to have a fucking built in tip jar.

929565370234691585 2017-11-11 04:23:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Huge misuse of the word, conflating. You are continuing to try & explain away the fact that the average American is paying more at the pump compared to a year ago, if Trump wasnt in office you wouldnt be disagreeing with me.
929560297429454849 2017-11-11 04:03:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, Im pointing out simple facts, gas prices are higher now than a year ago, which effects peoples bottom line, you can throw historical data at it all you want, doesnt change the facts, Im feeling it & I have a short commute.
929551049991614464 2017-11-11 03:26:55 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Bro, you are making excuses for your boy, are you really suggesting the average American Family is not paying higher gas prices now compared to a year ago
929547502034079745 2017-11-11 03:12:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Its irrelevant, why its high, what is relevant is prices literally rose the day after he was elected & havent sniffed $2.00 since, its pretty much been a steady increase with very few decreases.
929545189370327042 2017-11-11 03:03:37 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, it literally went up 9 cents on the Wednesday after Election Day, hurricanes had nothing to do with that rise. The fact is I have become poorer since Election Day & Im not alone.
929540142628593664 2017-11-11 02:43:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph My bad between 4.5-30%, the numbers got goofy in my head.

929142075823706112 2017-11-10 00:21:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @SelimSeesYou @wolfgang_joseph I see a 12 year republican reign like 1980-1992, but I could be wrong, but Im seeing a lot of similarities between than & now.
929140918791409664 2017-11-10 00:17:12 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @WalshFreedom @wolfgang_joseph Because the Country is so fucked youre grasping for anything so Trump sounds good, he has no ideological anchor, never has. So far its been Business as usual at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue just as I thought
929140052793360385 2017-11-10 00:13:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @SelimSeesYou @wolfgang_joseph If this is true, than your party has major issues because the divisions Im seeing with the Democrats quite possibly will never be put back together again
929139007447097349 2017-11-10 00:09:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @WalshFreedom @wolfgang_joseph As I said cognitive dissonance is strong with you, Ive been listening to trump for 35+ plus years, he is the way he talks, which is why his supporters amuse me so
929138156988923904 2017-11-10 00:06:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @SelimSeesYou @wolfgang_joseph Which brings me to this, Sanders destroyed the Democratic Party, I have friend who are I mean where Democrats till donna Braziles book came out, election victorys for Republicans should be slam dunks for at least 12 years as I see it.
929137271273656320 2017-11-10 00:02:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @WalshFreedom @wolfgang_joseph Holy cognitive dissonance, you really think a man who says hed date his daughter a good person, in tweeting with you I dont think youd hold same Believe if it was a regular guy say at the shopping mall saying that
929135127741063170 2017-11-10 23:54:11 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Than Roy Moore should be disavowed by the Right, which he is not.
929134803710042112 2017-11-10 23:52:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @SelimSeesYou @wolfgang_joseph Was turnout down for republicans on Tuesday? If so, is it a sign of deeper schism within the party.
929134199742910464 2017-11-10 23:50:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @WalshFreedom @wolfgang_joseph Id seriously like an answer to this question.
929133902140248064 2017-11-10 23:49:19 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @espn @wolfgang_joseph Cmon Bro, weve been over this, both sides play that game, thats what all this Hollywood crap is about
929133578608398336 2017-11-10 23:48:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @SelimSeesYou You do great work number crunching but a couple things you overlook, Republicans vote no matter who their candidate is, Dems in other hand will stay home if they dont like candidate, now 2016 saw a 60% turnout, how many Dems stayed home? Did they show up in bigger #s on Tuesday
929129542530281472 2017-11-10 23:31:59 UTC <JohnQPublic30> My 2018 prediction, Louis C.K will be back in the summer bigger than ever, America loves to tear people down, but also love stories of redemption. Hes on a 6 month time out. #LouieCK
929128764117790721 2017-11-10 23:28:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @espn @wolfgang_joseph Nope, a total non factor & made up identity politics by the right, you werent even born when ESPN came out, there was nothing else like it at the time, now market is saturated, you can see highlights anywhere now, on demand. All major sports have a YouTube page now.

928981924995006464 2017-11-10 13:45:25 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph My point is I know exactly how strong these police unions are, I know how they roll, in HS I studied for two years in a law enforcement program, I take your story at face value
928978790742622209 2017-11-10 13:32:57 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Im saying its truly amazing you got two different LEOs fired, I know how strong the police unions & DA offices are.
928975808806424576 2017-11-10 13:21:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Truly, Truly amazing stuff, the fact that you got two different cop fired in two different cities is lottery winning type odds. And you did it on your own, amazing
928973736124014592 2017-11-10 13:12:52 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Truly amazing story, you must have a hell of a legal team
928969577735827456 2017-11-10 12:56:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Let me guess, you faced no repercussions in either jurisdiction?
928966721016401920 2017-11-10 12:45:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Leftist politics didnt kill @espn the internet did, the viewer now can control what highlights they see, ESPN was the only game in town, thats changed now.

928864373128474624 2017-11-09 05:58:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Good for you, Ive seen to much shit & know to many MF that When crossed will hunt people down, Nah, Im about me & mine
928861824090542081 2017-11-09 05:48:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph So what!
928861522784374784 2017-11-09 05:46:59 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph They walked up & shot someone in the head in a major Metropolitan city with 50-100 people around & Im going to testify, nah. Most people get popped like that are up to no good, not saying he deserved it but it wasnt random
928860689179045888 2017-11-09 05:43:40 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No, I smart. Cops were on scene, they can figure it out, been witness to a stabbing incident as a teenager, seen how cops lie & change witness reports, never again will I expose myself like that again
928859620755607553 2017-11-09 05:39:25 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If you say so, I on the other hand keep my shit wired tight, I protect myself, my safety & my loved ones safety are Paramount to anything. Every cop & Lawyer tell me the same thing. The cops cant & wont protect me & mine
928858080464592896 2017-11-09 05:33:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, Ive seen people get killed & not said anything & I learned that from a police officer. Messing in other peoples business is a good way to get killed.
928857104223436800 2017-11-09 05:29:25 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, SNAP is a $70 billion dollar program, if you talking about food stamps stay on food stamps dont add other programs into the mix to inflate the numbers, I take it you consider SNAP a federal giveaway program
928856385206579200 2017-11-09 05:26:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph As I said, I stay outta other peoples affairs, I know one white thats been busted 3 times, felony counts on all of them
928853371892715520 2017-11-09 05:14:35 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph As Ive said in the past, food stamp program is a minuscule part of fed budget, the only abusers I know are white, who make up a majority of food stamp recipients anyway, 2010 USDA study claims for every $1 of SNAP spent another $1.79 in generated for the economy
928851431540641792 2017-11-09 05:06:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Hispanics are scrubbing themselves from SNAP & local food pantry rolls.
928850883525402624 2017-11-09 05:04:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The food stamp drop has a caveat.
928839945854308352 2017-11-09 04:21:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph There is a lot of smoke, the girl says shes a republican, so on surface it looks bad
928837146626150400 2017-11-09 04:10:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I only know about that piece, until he admits to it, I say he stays. I believe no media
928835282568441856 2017-11-09 04:02:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Should Roy Moore withdraw from race? @wolfgang_joseph

928731403080077313 2017-11-09 21:09:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Because its heresy, thats how strong that rumor was, this was 20+ years before internet & I stay out of other peoples business as a rule.
928730328969203712 2017-11-09 21:05:40 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No, these are old stories like Cosby, I first heard bout the Cos in the late 80s
928726006566981633 2017-11-09 20:48:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Now Louis C.K & I say where have you people been?

928449054861905920 2017-11-08 02:27:59 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Again dude, you are repeating allegations as facts from heresy, very dangerous habit to get into
928447598641414144 2017-11-08 02:22:11 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, are you fucking retarded, this story has been circulating for fucking years, its all heresy, the statute of limitations has run out in Illinois & Corey Haim is dead, you conservatives need to get over yourselves
928445807598166023 2017-11-08 02:15:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Were there any witnesses to this alleged rape of Corey Haim?
928445415313301504 2017-11-08 02:13:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Hey @Jim_Bakker will you be one of the rioters or you gonna go into the fetal position like when Jessica Hahn exposed you?http://deadstate.org/jim-bakker-if-donald-trump-is-impeached-christians-will-riot-in-the-streets/
928443968609771520 2017-11-08 02:07:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Separate issue than the Corey Haim allegations.
928442825917820929 2017-11-08 02:03:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Also you conservatives best not fly to close to the sun.
928442602394914816 2017-11-08 02:02:20 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Again dude, you are making allegations against Sheen that are just that allegations, what if he didnt do it?
928437290875215872 2017-11-08 01:41:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, you are making serious assumptions, I get your a conservative & dont like Hollywood, but allegations are not fact.
928434946481508352 2017-11-08 01:31:55 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @RandPaul @StefanMolyneux @wolfgang_joseph Im sure Rand did it repeatedly, Rand seems like a habitual line stepper. Some people need to be taught a lesson, a good ass whooping is all some people understand
928434315666608128 2017-11-08 01:29:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph And you know this as fact?
928429840713289728 2017-11-08 01:11:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I thought he was dead? Why they talking about him like hes alive.
928429433706418181 2017-11-08 01:10:01 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @RandPaul @StefanMolyneux @wolfgang_joseph Wrong, developer of the gated Community says theyve had beef for years, If Rand Paul did blow his lawn trimmings into his neighbors yard, he deserved the ass beating. IMO
928428038794203136 2017-11-08 01:04:28 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @RandPaul @StefanMolyneux @wolfgang_joseph Not why they had beef, not everything is political.
928427693137448960 2017-11-08 01:03:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Corey Haim is still dead right? #CharlieSheen

928296417512259585 2017-11-08 16:21:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Old school republican conservatives, they dont think Trump is right wing enough, family, god & country Republicans they are.
928290660603478016 2017-11-08 15:58:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Good Luck, not the first time you have proposed this, I tell my Conservative friends about this & they just giggle.
928283596900700160 2017-11-08 15:30:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Good luck on that, youre asking conservatives to take money away from their families when most of them are all about themselves & their family.

928252485017460738 2017-11-08 13:26:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, I dont know a single conservative that would do that, the ones I know are free market capitalists, that only care about their bottom line
928250925327765505 2017-11-08 13:20:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yeah, and you want them to take a hit to their bottom line by renting cheaper! WOW!
928241637758816261 2017-11-08 12:43:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Youre seriously asking for conservatives to take less money? How many conservatives live in section 8 land anyway

927980463242739712 2017-11-07 19:25:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realJamesAllsup @wolfgang_joseph To be continued, Im at lunch with my secretary, but yes
927962421007876097 2017-11-07 18:14:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realJamesAllsup @wolfgang_joseph The last two quarters look good for Trump, as I said lets see if it holds, to say Obama never had quarters over 3% is disingenuous
927961671066423299 2017-11-07 18:11:17 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yes, as poverty decreases so does crime, West Virginia, Ohio & Pennsylvania are prime examples of my argument, because its happening in real time
927953734486896645 2017-11-07 17:39:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Youre way off on this, nice goalpost move, BTW
927953463279005696 2017-11-07 17:38:40 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realJamesAllsup @wolfgang_joseph Im taking quarters.http://fortune.com/2017/08/30/donald-trump-springfield-mo-3-gdp/
927950746536022016 2017-11-07 17:27:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realJamesAllsup @wolfgang_joseph Between 2009-2016 Obama hit 3% 8 times i believe.
927949720894496769 2017-11-07 17:23:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Crime is not the main reason for poverty, crime may be a reason poverty persists,  but it is not the underlining cause of poverty.
927948906603966464 2017-11-07 17:20:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realJamesAllsup @wolfgang_joseph Cmon Guys, Obama had many months of 3% GDP growth, lets see if this holds, stock market is in same bubble as when Obama was in office, Trump called it a bubble himself before election
927948043063832576 2017-11-07 17:17:08 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I agree on this, but you stated crime is the reason for poverty & that is inaccurate
927944867032064000 2017-11-07 17:04:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The states affected by so called White Misery are a prime example, poverty & hopelessness came first than drugs & crime, not other way around
927943756996841479 2017-11-07 17:00:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Left will never win this battle due to their tactics.https://twitter.com/yashar/status/927885087454134273
927936183165968384 2017-11-07 16:30:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Partly true, yes if you remove crime,area improves , but if an area become impoverished, crime will follow. It works in reverse too
927926837929500672 2017-11-07 15:52:52 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Many reasons for poverty but crime is a symptom of poverty not the cause
927924129751330816 2017-11-07 15:42:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Percentage wise, yes, I think overall whites are higher. But my point was poverty plays a huge roll in crime
927913127609622528 2017-11-07 14:58:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dont throw out poverty numbers, poor whites have higher non fatal rates than poor blacks.

927447251781410816 2017-11-06 08:07:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Your responses on the child tax deduction are typical from the conservatives side, you only agree with the subsidy because it promotes your way of life, conservatives love to pick & choose.
927358249850097664 2017-11-05 02:13:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Avoid the expense? If you cant afford kids dont have them...oh wait, the Government will subsidize your lifestyle.
927357191186677760 2017-11-05 02:09:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, I know someone with 4 kids thats a $12,000 reduction in his taxable income, same as the Government giving him $12,000 & you dont think thats an economic advantage over someone with 0 kids.
927355213668896768 2017-11-05 02:01:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No, its subsidizing a lifestyle & at the same time puts certain members of Society at an economic disadvantage
927353816286187525 2017-11-05 01:55:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Not if it was only sold in specific establishments & licensed
927353269365682176 2017-11-05 01:53:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph How am I wrong?
927353184439463937 2017-11-05 01:53:23 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yes, remove it, Government gets double dipped, churches pay no tax, worshipers donations are tax deductible
927352713389670402 2017-11-05 01:51:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Legalizing weed would be an economic boom, see Colorado.
927352342554513413 2017-11-05 01:50:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @wolfgang_joseph Are you saying the nfl doesnt contribute to the economy?
927351157873369088 2017-11-05 01:45:20 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Legalize marijuana Legalize prostitution Tax churches Collect property tax on churches End the Parsonage exemption Eliminate Child deduction Eliminate Mortgage deduction
927349833928757250 2017-11-05 01:40:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @wolfgang_joseph Just to put things into perspective, the last NFL stadium built was USBank stadium its total cost was $1.29 billion, foxxconn is getting twice that amount in tax breaks
927349031667404801 2017-11-05 01:36:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @wolfgang_joseph I have 7 things the Government could do right now to raise revenue but Im a leftist remember 
927347507323179009 2017-11-05 01:30:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @wolfgang_joseph Im not for it, its disingenuous for you conservatives to single out the NFL, most businesses get some form of tax relief or deferment
927346276336918535 2017-11-05 01:25:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @wolfgang_joseph Where did I say that?
927344634745049088 2017-11-05 01:19:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @wolfgang_joseph Yes, if youre a farmer & receive a farm subsidy check thats a direct subsidy, if you receive a tax break its an indirect subsidy
927342034574303232 2017-11-05 01:09:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @wolfgang_joseph Dude, a tax break is an indirect subsidy
927340672864186368 2017-11-05 01:03:40 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @wolfgang_joseph Theyre getting close to $3 billion in state tax credits, $1.5 billion in state income tax credits & $1.35 in state Capital investment tax credits, Im sure theyre getting a property tax deferment on the land as well
927337446370697218 2017-11-05 00:50:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @wolfgang_joseph How much do other businesses get, what kind of subsidies is FoxxConn getting for that plant they are allegedly building in Wisconsin?

927275929939820545 2017-11-05 20:46:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph More than likely not political motivated is my guess.

927259318877073410 2017-11-05 19:40:23 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Funny how no conservatives talk about the $17 million the @NFL has given to military nonprofits since 2011! #SaluteToService https://twitter.com/mushkat/status/927010300422799360

927241825890512898 2017-11-05 18:30:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Its reported by neighbors that they had an ongoing feud.
927240277122830337 2017-11-05 18:24:44 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, he was attacked by his neighbor!
927237962043219969 2017-11-05 18:15:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph It was Right Wingers that started the whole Nov 4th Civil War nonsense, that rumor spread like wildfire on line
927237105331433473 2017-11-05 18:12:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Both sides ran their mouths, actually its was the Right Wingers that were doing the most goading
927232102021476352 2017-11-05 17:52:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> The only confirmed death in the ANTIFA/MAGA Civil War was ME from boredom, do better next time,guys! #Antifa #MAGA
927224726166089730 2017-11-05 17:22:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> The real story is, why couldnt 3 huge male police officers & a woman control & subdue one white womanhttps://twitter.com/cernovich/status/927203593849131009

926909978891431936 2017-11-04 20:32:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Almost a million people left job market in October, thats what caused unemployment to drop.
926909253985751040 2017-11-04 20:29:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I finally got a chance to look at that jobs report & it was weak, Trumps economy is functioning the same as Obamas, hourly wages were suppose to rise .2 & they were flat & only because they rounded up.
926906691366637568 2017-11-04 20:19:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Thats irrelevant, the costs of our day to day operations are slowing creeping up, this effects business decisions
926903182688649217 2017-11-04 20:05:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Meanwhile the cost of raw materials to make plastic has gone up so much so our vendors have had to redo their price structure.
926896680565342210 2017-11-04 19:39:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Thats not happening, received notices from two vendors that prices are going up, also our major MRO supplier has being slowing raising prices
926881337507811330 2017-11-04 18:38:26 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Also the tax cut for small business owners is a joke & not really that big, the corporate tax cuts are somewhat better but I see that being outset with the rise of the cost of raw materials which is driving up prices
926878319722881024 2017-11-04 18:26:26 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph This tax plan does not eliminate that problem, Government will actually be taking in less revenue under this plan, cuts werent big enough & the deductions they plan to eliminate are going to hurt people, examples, not being able to deduct student loans, Business expenses
926874044099629056 2017-11-04 18:09:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The Government has a revenue problem & this tax reform does not solve that, 2018 might be more interesting now, they got rid of a lot of deductions, including the deduction for Tax prep, which is going to be more complicated under this plan for most people
926870344316735488 2017-11-04 17:54:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Its a tax cut on the aggregate , but government will be taking in less revenue which means Gen Z will foot the bill, the dance continues
926868443982376961 2017-11-04 17:47:12 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Trump tax plan is going to be pretty interesting! 
926868222707732480 2017-11-04 17:46:19 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I wasnt the LARPERS  saying there would be a civil war, it was Right Wingers stoking that fire.
926866446768107520 2017-11-04 17:39:15 UTC <JohnQPublic30> I dont hear any gun shots, did ANTIFA call off the Civil War? #Nov4ItBegins
926602578611376130 2017-11-03 00:10:44 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Ill be doing a video about it tomorrow!
926600623658864641 2017-11-03 00:02:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> This week we saw the death of the Democratic Party! #FeelTheBern
926573826460315655 2017-11-03 22:16:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You operation is quite smaller easier to do, less moving parts, my plant is a massive operation, were on pace to produce 18 million units this year & our goal is 24 million next year
926572202262220800 2017-11-03 22:10:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I guessing you think Government run programs are slow, wasteful & full of red tape, a multi million dollar business is no different, you cant just throw money around, you have budget constraints & shareholders to answer to. Its like a small Government
926571510210465792 2017-11-03 22:07:17 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Understood but you realize you have a tendency to oversimplify your answers & Solutions.
926569682496380929 2017-11-03 22:00:01 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Thats dishes,Bro. Not huge industrial mixing bowls that hold 1700 lbs of product, different game.
926569307525603328 2017-11-03 21:58:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If it were do-able which its not it would only be used for about 25% of the plants equipment, plus we dont have the luxury of time to have equipment sitting under lights to dry & sterilize, the plant is in Constant motion, it would increase our cost
926567626486243328 2017-11-03 21:51:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph NH?
926530761230077953 2017-11-03 19:25:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph UV lighting would drive up our energy cost, as I said rigid state & government standards have to be met, no way around the process, but youve worked in food service so you know
926518764891406337 2017-11-03 18:37:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph Nope, not sanitary enough, every piece of equipment that touches food must be cleaned, swabbed & tested. Good idea but wont work. We spend over $25,000 a yr just on the swabs to do the testing, thats a $25,000 loss.
926517072640823298 2017-11-03 18:30:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph Replaced all the lighting two years ago, water usage is through the roof, over $1.5 million a year. Steps already taken but its a complete washdown environment so its a cost we have to eat.
926514790561968129 2017-11-03 18:21:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph We already do this, so what else you got for me?
926512792429002757 2017-11-03 18:13:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph So you were putting corn husks & used oil in your food?
926508828375609344 2017-11-03 17:58:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph Food is not gas,
926508654857244674 2017-11-03 17:57:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph Again more broad generalizations, in food production you can only capture so much, strict food safety standards, are you in the habit of eating low quality food?
926507041304301568 2017-11-03 17:51:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph Yes, it is, unique challenges in food production, some things you cant capture & reuse. As I said our customers demand high quality thats why they do business with us. We dont send out garbage product.
926504816704094211 2017-11-03 17:42:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph Nope, Im high up on food chain. Ive already put three thing in place that immediately saved the company money
926504405050056705 2017-11-03 17:40:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph Dude, you literally dont know what the fuck your taking about, we have strict quality standards & strict food safety standards. We always look to improve waste but its very high in food processing. Its why margins are so small.
926502689818775552 2017-11-03 17:33:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph We eliminated the holes with the new line, again you really dont understand man hours
926502252822581248 2017-11-03 17:32:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph Our plant has tons of waste but nature of food production business, big waste, low margins
926502109012480001 2017-11-03 17:31:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph Seriously dude, would you take a job for $10 hr, just standing there. The very purpose of the new line was to get rid of workers & make job simpler so any rum dummy off the street can do it.
926501162190364672 2017-11-03 17:27:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph Automate & double wages, what fantasy world do you live in. Doubling wages literally defeats the purpose
926500607644532741 2017-11-03 17:25:33 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph Your tweets on this subject just prove if you were running a plant, you would bankrupt it very quickly.
926500291566100480 2017-11-03 17:24:17 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Again you are not listening to me, we just installed a $2.2 million dollar automated production line that replaced 12 workers, the line leads got their pay cut because they literally stand & do nothing. Raising wages defeats the purpose of the new line. 1)
926497032793133056 2017-11-03 17:11:20 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph Dude, you are not listening to me, my job uses low wage unskilled workers because the job is simple & repetitive, our problem is keeping workers, which is why we use temp workers heavily.
926493227636707328 2017-11-03 16:56:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph We dont, but theres a machinist shortage,Lets get Americans trained to do those jobs not foreigners
926492689796911104 2017-11-03 16:54:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph At the expense of American jobs, I thought it was America first & you were a civic nationalist?
926491345820241920 2017-11-03 16:48:44 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph I thought your Gen was having trouble finding  good jobs & work?
926490656943607808 2017-11-03 16:46:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TaraMcCarthy444 @wolfgang_joseph Immigration is good when its whites, huh?
926455115367796736 2017-11-03 14:24:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph They also said theyd build a factory in PA which they never opened, lets wait till they are up & running. Right now its still cheaper to import.
926453581619847168 2017-11-03 14:18:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Many factories? Are you taking companies opening multiple factories or just overall growth?
926451844750159873 2017-11-03 14:11:47 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph That is not helpful for the overall economy, its only helpful to the business owners, The point you are missing is manufacturing has always been on the higher paying side of unskilled labor, the right factory you can make descent money without a degree
926450972502691840 2017-11-03 14:08:19 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Manufacturing has been pretty much treading upwards since 2010 with a few monthly hiccups,its why I said I hope it holds
926447810869940224 2017-11-03 13:55:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Its progress, Im more concerned if it holds, the manufacturing numbers werent mind blowing
926408494261194752 2017-11-03 11:19:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> You really think  doesnt incentivize having kids? For fucks sake look at all the tax breaks you get for having kids, all those deductions should be eliminated https://twitter.com/realjamesallsup/status/926299631478218752
926270279868997633 2017-11-02 02:10:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Hes an idiot, the low ratings might help out these advertisers in the long run, negotiate cheaper rate & still reach a prime time size audience.

926141281306337280 2017-11-02 17:37:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> The truth is @RealJamesWoods is a prick on twitter but unlike conservatives who change their minds on liberal actors, I still love James in Any Given Sunday & on Family guy. I can separate the two mediums

925703915030614016 2017-11-01 12:39:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Its a large expense but labor & inventory far our way the energy expense for which there are many ways to reduce, never said anything about shifting costs, our city works closely with our plant to ensure our cost stay in line. Our water bill is what kills us
925700700868435969 2017-11-01 12:27:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Our energy costs are not even in our top expenditures, labor & inventory still our number 1 & 2, fortunately the plant is location in a very Progressive city which works hand & hand with us to reduce our energy costs & keep them low
925686894792527872 2017-11-01 11:32:08 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph A oversimplification of the process, Energy is just a small part of the process. The amount of moving parts & departments that must run in unison is a daunting task.
925586630861295616 2017-10-31 04:53:44 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, you dont know shit about manufacturing or labor economics, youd bankrupt a facility
925574130207993856 2017-10-31 04:04:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Do it! I see a dirty cheap nursing home for you when you have Alzheimershttps://twitter.com/donaldjtrumpjr/status/925495970032443392
925572873913356289 2017-10-31 03:59:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yes, what are you a globalist? Weve lost 5 million manufacturing jobs since 2000 & you are proving my point that Technology is costing jobs, which is NEVER a good thing for the overall economy.
925561949861105665 2017-10-31 03:15:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Who do you think we were selling to back then? When Trump talks about MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, hes talking about the 50s & 60s when we literally ruled the world & were the wealthiest nation by far
925537768952025090 2017-10-31 01:39:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, thats not progress, if manufacturing was at 25% now the economy would be far better off plus manufacturing is a indirect employment multiplier, it creates jobs
925533224532692992 2017-10-31 01:21:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph In 1977 22% of workforce was in manufacturing, today its 8%, when you look at it as a percentage, huge decline do to Technology and automation.
925526873752424448 2017-10-31 00:56:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph 1960, 1 in 4 employed in manufacturing, today its fewer than 1 in 10, 1980 in took 25 people to make a million dollars of products, now it takes 5

925473072525860864 2017-10-31 21:22:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, Ive literally watched jobs in certain industries dry up & the people having to take lesser paying jobs. The economy is contracting, automation is destroying the middle class
925472078664486913 2017-10-31 21:18:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Wait...What?https://twitter.com/salmaiorana/status/925455935224582150
925458860059648000 2017-10-31 20:26:01 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, you literally have no idea how damaging this is to the economy. This is/will be the downfall of your Gen & Gen Z. Moores law, this is accelerating
925430063876722689 2017-10-31 18:31:35 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph 1) thats bs 2) you think congressman are going to vote to take money out of their own pockets. Ugh! 
925419711193649152 2017-10-31 17:50:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Hes planning to cut $38 billion from farm subsidies & the farm lobby is freaking out. How many farmers you think voted Hillary!
925418706699681792 2017-10-31 17:46:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Its a part of it, will he make those cuts? Unlikely, farmers have a lobby you know, Money talks
925418017068109825 2017-10-31 17:43:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Now were back to burning down the system that benefits the rich, somehow you think thats going to happen. Trump has proposed cutting SNAP by $193 billion I think, will he cut farm subsidies? I doubt it
925416052154126336 2017-10-31 17:35:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, Walmart double dips on food stamps, 2014 numbers estimate, Walmart costs taxpayers $6.2 billion & by Walmarts own admission they have captured $13.5 billion a year in SNAP sales or 18%!  You know what that pays for right? Theres your wall
925398489558867968 2017-10-31 16:26:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Working those low paying jobs doesnt eliminate the need for food stamps, see Walmart employees.
925395451104329728 2017-10-31 16:14:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Again, nobody can come up with concrete number to say how much they are taking/contributing to economy, they are taking low wages jobs that whites wont do ( farm work, janitorial work & the such)
925393193511870470 2017-10-31 16:05:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Im a realist, Ive seen this movie before, my prediction is 12 years of republican president regardless if its Trump or not, remember hell be 74 in 2020, a out of shape 74. Yes, I want to make real changes to the system that will benefit everybody
925389399529058304 2017-10-31 15:50:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Serious misconception, they compete with each other, but at end of the day theyre in the same club. Trump, Mnuchin, Soros, Ross, they laugh at people like us

925380949520642049 2017-10-31 15:16:25 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, you live in fantasy land, same creatures infesting the swamp , Mnuchin as secretary of treasury, worked for Soros twice.

925144458940870656 2017-10-30 23:36:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I know, in America whites are being oppressed, this White Misery crisis has me worried.
925142953361887233 2017-10-30 23:30:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Ive worked with many africans the last 10 years, we discuss this very topic.
925130485789011969 2017-10-30 22:41:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No, Im saying most white people treat black people like shit especially in South Africa, I have zero sympathy for the white people over there.
925128454575742977 2017-10-30 22:33:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph And?
925128352205365249 2017-10-30 22:32:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Wait, are you saying whites are having a tough time in South Africa because theyre  the Minority? 
925126787411185664 2017-10-30 22:26:28 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph As long as we are quoting wikipedia, do the math on number of farm murders, its minuscule, as I said I bet more whites died of the flu than murderpic.twitter.com/H6oavypU5j
925123492093325313 2017-10-30 22:13:23 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph And it better not be from stormfront
925123228472958976 2017-10-30 22:12:20 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph As I said not all SA farmers murdered are whites, source your stats!
925122524538658817 2017-10-30 22:09:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph So they were all farmers? SA farm murders not a new topic, I first heard about in mid 90s, its overblown & SA Government not keeping track, its a minuscule amount of deaths, nothing to get worked up about
925121042430996480 2017-10-30 22:03:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I dont think whites should get special treatment because of it, I think only 60-70% of the murders are whites anyway
925120635331805185 2017-10-30 22:02:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Their problem not ours, get a better government
925120452036571137 2017-10-30 22:01:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The definition of genocide is quite broad, 1600 deaths in 15-20 years hardly a genocide, I bet more people died from the flu in that time period
925117375258734592 2017-10-30 21:49:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Cernovich @wolfgang_joseph Genocide? Get real. Im not for open borders if people find their own way here & pay their freight Im fine but if they screw up, immediate deportation. Farmers in SA need to solve the problem on their own
925112430795083776 2017-10-30 21:29:25 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Cernovich @wolfgang_joseph They should handle their own problems over there, no reason to import them to our country, we have enough white farmers gaming our system as it is.
925077108656889856 2017-10-30 19:09:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Cernovich @wolfgang_joseph Fuckem, I dont want those parasites destroying our country

924856323497279488 2017-10-29 04:31:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @ItsVee_ My ex fianc was from the south side of Chicago, 511 with a 50 booty, so Ive seen & heard it all. 
924855594883969025 2017-10-29 04:28:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @ItsVee_ Ive seen worst! 
924855219946582016 2017-10-29 04:27:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Are you talking Antifa or Right Wing Militia?
924854403349254144 2017-10-29 04:24:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Not fight, they are anarchists, they want to tear down the system, there is overlap between the two sides, both distrust the media & hate the elites.
924853092687974400 2017-10-29 04:18:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Exactly, your side was openly calling for civil war if she won, how is that different than what ANTIFA is doing, btw, Antifa would still be protesting if Hillary had won, they see her as a globalist & member of the elite
924851872204296192 2017-10-29 04:14:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph As I said, far different than what was going on in the 60s, today you have a clash of ideologies, which you will have when two polarizing figures run for President.
924848190481948672 2017-10-29 03:59:26 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Maybe so, but far different than what was happening in the 60s, Berkeley had rules forbidding any kind of political advocacy or outside speakers in the 60s, Berkeley has has protests going back to pre WW 2.
924837401360551937 2017-10-29 03:16:33 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Really? They took a census of black bloc members & found out their level of education?
924837019611750400 2017-10-29 03:15:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No, it was the students fighting the administration for the right of on campus demonstrations, very different to what going on there now.
924835531078471681 2017-10-29 03:09:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph In the 60s the students were fighting the administration for free speech rights, The 2017 protests mainly caused by ANTIFA, how many black bloc members are student at Berkeley?
924833162517270528 2017-10-29 02:59:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Berkeley always been that way!
924830674678317056 2017-10-29 02:49:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Wow, Ive know 3 kids in college & at least 15 college grads from your generation that never mention these experiences & they went to major colleges, upper tier. So youre school sucked.
924826271460229121 2017-10-29 02:32:20 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, the talking points & the terminology are the same, sad to say but I see things sliding backwards mainly because of whites especially amongst white conservatives, they feel their under attack
924822212653256705 2017-10-29 02:16:12 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Identity politics is a buzzword used by your generation, Im not hearing anything different today than when I was a teenager. These arguments are nothing new
924821745613369344 2017-10-29 02:14:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Because hes white & the Owner, so when he uses that idiom, he is suggesting he is the prison warden, now if he used the idiom  the inmates are running the asylum it probably would have been taken differently
924819495176175623 2017-10-29 02:05:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Exactly, words have meaning like when you call your employees, prisoners & a vast majority of your employees are black, words & idioms can be taken out of context, this way as an Owner, he should have chosen his words more carefully
924816177603469313 2017-10-29 01:52:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph First, I was using minorities in a general sense not just referring to the NFL, Secondly, you obviously see whites as losing their foothold in Society, which is what this white misery opioid crisis talk is all about
924813295432892417 2017-10-29 01:40:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, YOU are not the arbitrator of what is or isnt racist to minorities, something conservatives seem to overlook
924811818941517824 2017-10-29 01:34:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I know, because the uppity n**** rs need to know there place right? Its only racism when YOU perceive to be.
924810621455040512 2017-10-29 01:30:08 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No bro, you literally stated you dont think they have a right to be pissed because YOU dont perceive it as racism, thats stunningly arrogant especially for a white person
924808913001828352 2017-10-29 01:23:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph 1st, it definitely had racial undertones & Secondly, it doesnt matter if you think its not racist, youre white. Thirdly, everybody on the team was pissed even the white players
924805845791248384 2017-10-29 01:11:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph 1st, your bosses say this shit to you & you dont say anything back?  2nd, just because its a so called common idiom doesnt mean it needs to be said
924784075805687808 2017-10-29 23:44:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, this has nothing to do with contracts. He indirectly called his employees inmates when the majority of his employees are African American. Subtle racism
924782433081405440 2017-10-29 23:38:08 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph He should have known better, its a shitty thing the say about your employees
924775019523256321 2017-10-29 23:08:40 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Yes, when the old white owner call them inmates.https://twitter.com/cernovich/status/924774373877305344

924051103167238145 2017-10-27 23:12:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realDonaldTrump @wolfgang_joseph Sorry thats  not going to help fill these jobs. They just wont ever pay enough
924050801789689856 2017-10-27 23:10:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph A couple I know from the low age range of your Gen, used to give me shit about not owning a house till they bought one this spring, rude awakening for them. Hes an apprentice electrician he understands what hes up against, plus he Girl makes good cash
924048224939364352 2017-10-27 23:00:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Well from what Ive seen, they are taking the same path as the two previous Generations. They know they cant support themselves on those wages
924043834568380416 2017-10-27 22:43:12 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yup, but most you young bucks dont want to do that work, hence the worker shortage.
924043114926440459 2017-10-27 22:40:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No, conservatives want better for their children they pressure them not to choose that vocation, because it pays shit.
924042581603954689 2017-10-27 22:38:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph They wont fill those jobs count on that, I dont know if it true but one of my co-workers daughter started HS this year, hanging in the guidance counselors office is a sign reading $20 an hour is only $41,600 a year telling, very telling!
924041247538470912 2017-10-27 22:32:55 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Why has there being a teacher shortage for 25 plus years, wheres the conservative teachers filling these positions?
924041003069255680 2017-10-27 22:31:57 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph It takes time?? Dude, I thought your generation was more conservative & has better work ethic than mine? The high age range of your Gen is 35 & like 77% of your Gen is out of HS, why arent they filling these jobs? Why has there been a machinist shortage for 30 plus years ....
924038010664095750 2017-10-27 22:20:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, Im not talking about my company, Im taking about our suppliers that manufacture our transfer pumps, motors etc etc, 95% of my job is unskilled labor, we pay less than a cashier at a convenience store
924035935158833154 2017-10-27 22:11:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Not every company has that luxury & most smaller companies wont because its NVA, especially in manufacturing & production
924032905004945409 2017-10-27 21:59:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Do you understand when you raise wages, you have to do one of two things, raise the price of you product or service or take a hit to your bottom line.
924028951462400000 2017-10-27 21:44:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You conservatives crack me up.  dont raise minimum wage or a Big Mac will cost $12 but a machine shop should raise their wage! 
924026907435421697 2017-10-27 21:35:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Margins are too small in most machine shops, one year of schooling to make $40,000 a year not too many people going to do that, I also found out our largest MRO supplier is getting rid of most of their full time people, The Amazon effect
924025160935538688 2017-10-27 21:29:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, theyve been screaming about a shortage of machinists since I was in high school, nobody wants to do that work.
924020029766668289 2017-10-27 21:08:37 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph A slight uptick, which is normal this time of year coupled with the lack of skilled workers, I.E Machinists.
923979806617882625 2017-10-27 18:28:47 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @SelimSeesYou Or maybe the two partys are more alike than you think!

923952440713543690 2017-10-27 16:40:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Some of my suppliers are having trouble getting parts.
923951388291420160 2017-10-27 16:35:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @HappyNoLucky Are you short staffed?

923664963666874368 2017-10-26 21:37:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, if Obama passed that budget you conservatives would be furious!

923608926133858305 2017-10-26 17:55:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @HappyNoLucky I think Ive only been blocked like 4-5 times that I know of, all conservatives
923607261024579585 2017-10-26 17:48:25 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @HappyNoLucky No, Conservatives was spelled correctly
923603093870333952 2017-10-26 17:31:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> I never bought the Trump Dossier narrative but if Hillary signed off on it than she should pay. #TrumpRussiaConspiracy

923595587664121856 2017-10-26 17:02:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Conservatives love that block button, even when you praise them. Its all about ideology. The if you dont agree with me 100% you are my enemy mentality.
923584020960763905 2017-10-26 16:16:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realJamesAllsup You know what I say to these white folk, GET A JOB & stop crying.

923577131141124097 2017-10-26 15:48:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph *much
923575389259214848 2017-10-26 15:41:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Ive got experience & the jobs Ive worked in my resent past Ive had documentation on how many money Ive saved those companies Ive worked for. The CEO of my division & the CEO of my parent company cant believe I never went to college
923572784776835073 2017-10-26 15:31:25 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph It does, none of these young bucks would take the jobs I took in my late teens & early 20s. I catch the same attitude from youngsters as I catch from you about not having an education & having the job I have.
923568353360470017 2017-10-26 15:13:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I got jobs that required a degree such as Management position, the color of my skin didnt play a deciding factor in getting those jobs but it did play a part, Ive only been doing what Im doing for about 7-8 years <end>
923567601111810048 2017-10-26 15:10:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Wrong, Im a failed Heavy Metal musician for the first 15 years of my work career I was a walking cliche, janitor, temp worker, car wash attendant, bar back, bartender, whse worker. None of those jobs prepared me for where I am now. Even when I quit playing 1)
923544356975534080 2017-10-26 13:38:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph That literally has nothing to do with why Im in the position Im in. Opportunity has nothing to do with it, its about making moves & sacrifices
923541787926507522 2017-10-26 13:28:15 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph How what works? Explain
923539481092911106 2017-10-26 13:19:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Really? How so?
923536820700438530 2017-10-26 13:08:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Basically this tweet says it.pic.twitter.com/lqINjbU32z
923535782882824192 2017-10-26 13:04:23 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, you literally admitted a couple of days ago that white privilege exists.
923535535729201152 2017-10-26 13:03:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph This is what Im talking about the ideological fracturing of the country.
923530693505843200 2017-10-26 12:44:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If your doing what Candace is doing, making the rounds on tv shows but if you just stay on YouTube & Twitter you can do that indefinitely
923526317538205696 2017-10-26 12:26:47 UTC <JohnQPublic30> So it beginshttps://twitter.com/foxnews/status/923525560718057473

923518108589010944 2017-10-26 11:54:09 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Like 6 months ago I tried to get a couple of my homegirls to do the Candace hustle but they didnt want to show their face.
923479765146898432 2017-10-26 09:21:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph So you understand they are playing you side, many dont
923479184818786305 2017-10-26 09:19:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You will see more of this kind of hustle, this is what the Hoteps are doing & your side eats this shit up, it will never change because you are to hell bent on conversion & winning to see the damage this does.
923477565003784192 2017-10-26 09:13:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Tree_of_Logic @wolfgang_joseph You miscalculated than, the people who have turned on her have pretty big followings but nobody major has discredited her & thats key. I was on to her from Jump street, Tree is 100% accurate in her assessment of RPB, proves how easily your side can be hustled
923469386417164288 2017-10-26 08:40:33 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Tree_of_Logic @wolfgang_joseph RPB, has plenty of people propping her up & her Patreon account keeps getting bigger.

922160526880321536 2017-10-22 17:59:37 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Many of us saw 9/11 coming, I protested the first gulf war which was a pretty popular war, had friends who fought in that war, they predicted a 9/11 type event as early as 94
922159935160545280 2017-10-22 17:57:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, neocons are former democrats who switched to the Republican Party, they are republicans, you may not consider yourself a neocon but they are a part of your party. Sorry

921033332602888192 2017-10-19 15:20:33 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Again studies disagree if immigration is a net gain or loss, CBO says over aggregate its a net gain.

921032037804531712 2017-10-19 15:15:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TomiLahren @wolfgang_joseph Bullshit, nobody has been tracking this stat & police shootings are reported on a voluntary system.

920646690763309056 2017-10-18 13:44:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dont care, you dont understand @realDonaldTrump must prove his value to me, hes a documented liar, I want results not his words. If he gets things done I give him props, I see no movement on infrastructure or cleaning water in Flint.
920644767851188231 2017-10-18 13:36:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Ill believe it when I see prices back to pre election levels, Im results driven not what ifs or gonna bes
920639659843182597 2017-10-18 13:16:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Zero, I got sick in 98 & racked up over $150,000 in medical debt, tough to get out of when your rowing the boat alone, as for gas prices, its been almost a year & prices in my area have been up literally since Election Day
920632558022529024 2017-10-18 12:48:01 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No 401K, all these entitlements you think i take, I take none of them, been paying taxes for 45 years never taken one deduction, just ended a 8 yr beef with IRS who I pulled a Donald Trump on. Since Nov 8 gas in my area has been up between 9%- 40% is I literally have less now
920629210611318785 2017-10-18 12:34:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Most of is coming from people boycotting his properties, also I hope he goes broke, he hasnt done shit for me yet, actually hes taking money out of my pocket
920628209787523072 2017-10-18 12:30:44 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realDonaldTrump @HappyNoLucky I think its funny the people bitching the most about them kneeling are conservative free market capitalists, such hypocrites they are!
920322501019873281 2017-10-17 16:15:57 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @RealJamesWoods If the apocalypse does comes rest assured the police wont be around, remember Hurricane Katrina
920314761006501888 2017-10-17 15:45:12 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Are you a lawyer, now? The phrase  shot across your bow is not illegal, its an expression & its does have a definition attached to it.
920314234419982336 2017-10-17 15:43:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Words & context have meaning along with presentation.
920313181406408708 2017-10-17 15:38:55 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Its a warning than aggressive action may be used against you. The phase is pretty self explanatory
920311931558342657 2017-10-17 15:33:57 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Wrong, rhetoric is the from of discourse, this coupled with violent words & phrases form violent rhetoric, both can be used in discourse without being a call to action.
920310195322048514 2017-10-17 15:27:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph *meant
920310080800804864 2017-10-17 15:26:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Rhetoric is not a direct call to action but a form of discourse mean to motivate or persuade a particular audience.
920304908808712192 2017-10-17 15:06:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Violent rhetoric does need to be a call to act to be be classified as violent rhetoric, rhetoric is not illegal.
920302627790999552 2017-10-17 14:56:59 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Have you seen her NYT video, full of violent rhetoric & imagery. The phrase  consider this a shot across your bow &  clinched fist  are definite calls to act in an aggressive manner
920299701194362881 2017-10-17 14:45:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No, I said I have no sympathy for her, as I have no sympathy for Antifa or Trump Supporters who spew violent rhetoric. The NRA has a long history of spewing violent rhetoric in their fundraising letters. Dana, regularly dances on the line.
920295806833446913 2017-10-17 14:29:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Have you ever watched any of her NRA videos? Full of hyperbole & rhetoric.
920294609158311937 2017-10-17 14:25:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph She spews violent rhetoric constantly, what do you expect to happen?
920294324239249409 2017-10-17 14:23:59 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @DLoesch @glennbeck Ill pass on this, I dont feel sorry for, Dana

919966068424237057 2017-10-16 16:39:37 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph Dude, that never Trumper list is huge, these Never Trumpers arent stupid, also you need to stop acting like everybody is going conservative, Trump barely won the election
919959639168638976 2017-10-16 16:14:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph Hated by the fringe, the fringe of you party is not that big.
919958698868559873 2017-10-16 16:10:20 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph As Ive said Ive seen this shift before, the establishment Conservatives are stepping back to save their careers, its a gamble but a smart play.
919957728533143552 2017-10-16 16:06:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph Thats not evolving, its fracturing, they are stepping back so not to be entangled with Trump if it goes south.
919953372110905344 2017-10-16 15:49:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph Both parties are fracturing, But I agree Sanders fucked the DNC up.
919943410060021760 2017-10-16 15:09:35 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph I know many who only vote local, Liberalism has been rising since 92
919935419315294208 2017-10-16 14:37:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph What are you going to do with the people who wont choose sides?

919691697394737152 2017-10-15 22:29:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Styx666Official I see this like the Music businesses response to Napster, Media grossly misjudged YouTube & are now scrambling to get a piece of the action, I think this will get far messier in the future. For what is worth I meant no disrespect to you, I have an answer to my question now.
919689925901025280 2017-10-15 22:22:20 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Styx666Official @lyceum_goyumae @True_Canuck1 @templeofninpo Im not concerned with your experience or opinion, sorry!
919689627480547328 2017-10-15 22:21:08 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Styx666Official Youre good at what you do, no argument on that, my question is, How far will corporate media go? Its obvious they want a piece of that pie. Can we expect lawsuits against content creators in the near future? To me that seems like a possible next step
919687462791925760 2017-10-15 22:12:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Styx666Official Ok, thanks for replying to me, Are we talking about the Right Wing Watch piece on you? Yes, I agree you were portrayed in a negative light, I disagree with them 100% but do you feel this is not part of the game?
919685746524598278 2017-10-15 22:05:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Styx666Official @lyceum_goyumae @True_Canuck1 My problem is with the 1st part of his tweet, how has he been negatively impacted by anti white racism? Dont mis understand me I like Styx, love his stance on free speech & liberty but this tweet has me shaking my head
919684849128140801 2017-10-15 22:02:09 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @scrowder @PrisonPlanet @PoliticiansI No, they are not, with Obama gone the militia groups need a new boogie man & ANTIFA is it, hopefully theyll wipe each other out
919670981018472448 2017-10-15 21:07:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @scrowder @PrisonPlanet How about the militia groups & 3%ers talking about killing Antifa? Dont leave that part out, Paul
919669337681747978 2017-10-15 21:00:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Guess what conservatives, I dont stand for the anthem or say Merry Christmas! Can you deal with it #MAGA @realDonaldTrump
919658623697145856 2017-10-15 20:17:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> So its all about your hurt feelings than?
919655640359931904 2017-10-15 20:06:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> How were you personally negatively impacted by this rife racist  you speak of, please be specific. Did you lose a job, a home?
919644247132950528 2017-10-15 19:20:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> I dont worry about behavior or opinions I cant control, My bigger question is, How much anti white racism has Styx experienced in his personal life? My guess is next to none
919635607642656769 2017-10-15 18:46:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> I said it does not effect me, Styxs tweet was a two part tweet, the second part I agree with, the first part I dont, hes getting sick of people who hate whites get over itpic.twitter.com/VydI5cbGUF

919602028153798658 2017-10-15 16:33:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I dont think so, paying to keep ads off there is going to stunt their growth, I knew from the get go theyd make it some form of subscription service all be it limited
919601550959538176 2017-10-15 16:31:09 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Styx666Official @ArrrghM3 News flash, there are Asians that hate whites, blacks that hate whites, are you really that weak that youre going to let people you dont know control your life. Racism is everywhere. Get over yourself
919600867178926080 2017-10-15 16:28:26 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yup, make the problem far worse but the majority of Twitter would leave, IMO
919600108534140928 2017-10-15 16:25:25 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @for_hillary How is giving Trump more than he asked for a compromise? Its not, its capitulation. Were in for another 16 years of conservative rule like 80-92 unless you Democrats show some back bone.

919581194156724225 2017-10-15 15:10:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Pofold I assuming Styx is talking about the media, It seems IMO, the ones crying about the media are the ones most controlled by it, Do I care if some media outlet thinks Im racist cause Im White? No, Why? I dont let media dictate my life & havent since 1983 when I was 15

919407092695490560 2017-10-14 03:38:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @getongab @wolfgang_joseph It seems to me Twitter is looking for a way out of the game without just shutting down.

918482027443257344 2017-10-12 14:22:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> My only comment on the Harvey Weinstein mess is this, @realDonaldTrump is being disingenuous about Harveys behavior, Trump spent 36 years in that poisonous Hollywood culture, Trump is not part of the solution hes part of the problem.

918165738447306753 2017-10-11 17:25:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Kaepernick7 @ShaunKing I never watch the anthem, Thanks to NFLREDZONE, when at games I sit or go to the concession stand (no lines) all the fake patriots are standing at attention like it means something!
918160485836607489 2017-10-11 17:04:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Cernovich I  this is satire!
918137303364788225 2017-10-11 15:32:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @AP_NFL Not accepted, run along, Coach!
918127190319030275 2017-10-11 14:52:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realDonaldTrump The only time I stand for the anthem is to tell somebody to F-themselves when they question me about sitting & keeping my hat on, GOD BLESS FREEDOM & LIBERTY #MAGA
918126470341505024 2017-10-11 14:49:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realDonaldTrump Thank god I have NFLREDZONE & dont have to watch that National Anthem garbage, meaningless gestures, just like everything you do. #MAGA
918123803846299648 2017-10-11 14:39:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realDonaldTrump @UndeniablePeace Yes, many did call it a bubble because companies were doing the same thing under Obama.
918119802920669184 2017-10-11 14:23:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realDonaldTrump @UndeniablePeace Its a bubble, overinflated from companies borrowing cash at low rates to buy back their own stock, smoke & mirrors
918116517950222336 2017-10-11 14:10:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @nytimes @RealJamesWoods What the Amber Tamblyn is going on here?
918103511870656513 2017-10-11 13:18:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @UndeniablePeace Somebody from the As took a knee before the end of regular season!

918009254203846656 2017-10-11 07:03:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @StefanMolyneux He has that much money in the cushions of his couch, big deal
917880633933869062 2017-10-10 22:32:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @original_cracka Which is a decade or more out at the very least
917875425522733056 2017-10-10 22:12:09 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @original_cracka Do you not understand that automation is cheaper than labor even cheap labor. Ive watched this shit play out for 20+ years but keep blaming Hispanics picking produce for you woes!
917874497100963845 2017-10-10 22:08:28 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Straight cash,Homiehttps://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/917820900212436995
917863844235448320 2017-10-10 21:26:08 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @original_cracka Oh that makes perfect sense, MIT benefits from cheap labor 
917846149754753024 2017-10-10 20:15:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @original_cracka Studies are not showing that.
917838511310540803 2017-10-10 19:45:28 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph $25 million in lawsuit settlement, thats on him, dont defraud people & you wont get sued, the rest looks as though people are boycotting his properties, thats also on him.
917832014790668289 2017-10-10 19:19:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I wanna see the whole disclosure, I take Trumps word on nothing. Properties are only part of his alleged wealth
917822515539562497 2017-10-10 18:41:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I wont believe any numbers till I see his complete financial statement, Ive been listening to his lies for 35 years, he must show me proof!
917821842118860805 2017-10-10 18:39:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JackPosobiec Trump the authoritarian, more proof conservatives hate liberty & freedom, free speech ONLY when its your free speech.
917821324566908936 2017-10-10 18:37:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @RyanAFournier New York is where the action is, Dummy
917821030865031168 2017-10-10 18:36:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @WalshFreedom Really? Its the same economy as under Obama & you called that a bubble! 
917806570255339526 2017-10-10 17:38:33 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Estimates Bro, no one knows his true net worth its all speculation, he wont release his taxes because he doesnt want you to see his net worth or tax rate on the taxes he paid or didnt pay. The only true way to know is full Financial disclosure on Trumps part
917789939554766849 2017-10-10 16:32:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You dont even know what his net worth is, you taking his word for it? Not me, hes a documented liar! Also youre missing my point on the Dems, I see no difference between the Dems & Republicans, when I said I dont vote, I dont vote for president, I vote local
917767668198989830 2017-10-10 15:03:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Thats fine if he takes damage too, hes being playing the same game, Trumps been fucking the taxpayers in the ass for decades & your side thinks its cool.
917765285419147264 2017-10-10 14:54:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph This is the guy you voted for? Hes an insider & gets, takes advantage of every tax break & loophole yet you bitch about NFL, if he wouldnt have got outbid for the Buffalo Bills hed be loving those tax breaks
917764509766438912 2017-10-10 14:51:25 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Thats why I dont really care for the Dems, they want that money too. Whos running the country? Wall Street & Big Business. Thats why Im against lowering the corporate tax rate, they get enough tax breaks already
917719108237611008 2017-10-10 11:51:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @original_cracka MIT report says different & I know from first hand experience, I work in manufacturing, my employer has cut at least 30 jobs in last 2-3 & has lower wages.pic.twitter.com/qMfym0796b
917716358640611328 2017-10-10 11:40:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Trump is a bullshit artist & hypocrite! How you clowns follow his lies & manipulation is beyond mepic.twitter.com/MmbW2KV4SO
917630182810406912 2017-10-09 05:57:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @original_cracka Not really, studies have shown when automation comes in it drives down the surrounding wages. You may not like those workers but they contribute to the economy, how much they take out has been debated for years
917608424581591043 2017-10-09 04:31:11 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @original_cracka Thats just an apple sorter & packager, are humans still picking them? Ive read the tech on robotic apple pickers is 10-15 years out, another problem is these tech firm are having trouble getting Government grants.
917485400624594944 2017-10-09 20:22:20 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You working all those hours, you have no house payment & youre making what you say again around $65,000 a year & You have a car payment 
917484895408152576 2017-10-09 20:20:19 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Youll never get divorced, boy never heard that before!  as far as the health goes, going through what youve gone through you know that life is fragile, when you get sick as an adult that bill comes out of your pocket, medical bill add up quick
917484155801427968 2017-10-09 20:17:23 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Ok, 12 hour days, still not impressed, routinely worked 70-80 hours a week when I was your age. Working long hours didnt make me a hero & it doesnt make you one either
917477524204146689 2017-10-09 19:51:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I meant you personally, you do not know what the future holds, as I said good on you for saving but Ive seen life bitch slap a lot of people just like you. Divorce, illness & accidents can/will fuck you shit up
917476766616256512 2017-10-09 19:48:01 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph WOW, keep busting out those 8.76 hour days!
917475913285210112 2017-10-09 19:44:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph That might get you through if you tighten up in old age but as I said youve had no hardship yet from what I can tell, a woman hasnt handed you your ass yet, illness or accident. Good you planning but dont get cocky. Ive seen it go up in flames for some people
917475150240600064 2017-10-09 19:41:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Not from who Ive talked, although you play to blame game more than most Ive talked to , projection I think. Ive met very few of you that are hard workers, you want shit right now without putting the time in.
917472291889516544 2017-10-09 19:30:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph How much you think youll need to retire?
917472143679606785 2017-10-09 19:29:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, your Gen aint shit, I used to defend your Gen but the more of you I talk to the more I think your fucked. You have unrealistic expectations, from being too cuddled I presume.
917471334732615686 2017-10-09 19:26:26 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph And I guarantee you arent saving enough & you havent even had any hardships yet.
917469474802061312 2017-10-09 19:19:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You will replace us to your determent, the longer my gen works the better off for you, but now youre finally getting my point about automation. Machines dont pay taxes or SS, this is what your Gen should be focused on
917466685636046848 2017-10-09 19:07:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Source that! I dont see how you are paying more & thanks to the greatest Gen & baby boomers I dont have a pension so more of my gen will have to work longer which Benefits your Gen
917463303106031617 2017-10-09 18:54:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Do you understand how SS works, Ive been working so you can retire like the Gen before me did. Youre failing into the anti government trap. So far your Gen is just fucking everything up.
917462512462950401 2017-10-09 18:51:23 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Strauss & Howe, the most accepted demographers define me as Gen x as Im defined by every matrix
917454953484111873 2017-10-09 18:21:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph First off, Im not a boomer & second explain how Ive milked the system? Your explanation should be enlightening
917451594962173952 2017-10-09 18:08:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Paltry sums of money, you dont know you wont see SS, what your tax dollars pay for you are getting a steal, youre not a millionaire, you might be in the 25% bracket if so get some deductions. You want to get rid of Welfare, change tax code eliminate child deduction
917449179475169282 2017-10-09 17:58:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Trump telling those players not to kneel is an assault on their liberty, he doesnt have to like it or support it but he should respect it, my second point, you are not being overtaxed, do the math for what you get youre getting a bargain
917446646660726784 2017-10-09 17:48:20 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Bullshit, if a Dem tried to do these things you call them a tyrant, whichs is what many on your side called Obama for 8 years
917445922908442625 2017-10-09 17:45:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Results at the cost of Liberty, you sound like Antifa right now.
917445497731866626 2017-10-09 17:43:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Thats being a authoritarian, Trump & the new Right hate liberty, this is painfully obvious
917444540507750401 2017-10-09 17:39:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You embrace authoritarians bro, this whole NFL garbage is Trump being an authoritarian & you love it. Your side thinks theirs is the only voice that should be heard, The new Right & Antifa are kissing cousins
917442737523306496 2017-10-09 17:32:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Both sides are authoritarian jack offs & dont tell me the right doesnt throw hands, for FFS one of your people are in jail for firing a weapon in Charlottesville
917442072487120897 2017-10-09 17:30:09 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @notconfed Thats debatable, no one has concrete numbers but you conservatives love to waste money on unnecessary walls & wars
917431616280113157 2017-10-09 16:48:37 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Trumps taking all my cash so I cant wait for this shit to blow up, Im tried of these rust belt elitists. Im just bidding my time, as far as Im concerned no difference between a MAGA hat & a Antifa mask.
917426378844368897 2017-10-09 16:27:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Im no fan of Obama, he fumbled the ball on lots of issues, but my life got better under him. Since Trump has been in office Im slowly being bleed to death like a stuck pig
917425717335511041 2017-10-09 16:25:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @original_cracka @wolfgang_joseph @TonyCastle16 Google it
917416242662772736 2017-10-09 15:47:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph So basically you are saying people in the inner cites should adopt the nomadic lifestyle of Hispanic farm laborers because whites wont do the work. 
917413167545880576 2017-10-09 15:35:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I dont see a lot of farms in inner city Chicago, both plants we run are 80-90% minorities. So yeah, we hire a lot & have high turnover rate.
917410504372572160 2017-10-09 15:24:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, you literally want to deport the very people doing those jobs, who will fill them then? You know how much I hate farmers but when farmers all across the country are saying that whites wont work their fields I believe them.
917392501337722880 2017-10-09 14:13:11 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @HappyNoLucky I dont like this tweet, we agree!
917392305291657216 2017-10-09 14:12:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Im talking college kids still in school or any young white kids for that matter, I probably travel the country as much as you, I was in LA County last month, didnt see any 18-25 yr old whites busing tables, moping bathrooms or picking crops. Just saying
917382122356334592 2017-10-09 13:31:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The farm labor wages have been going up for a couple of years, wage war in CA. They still cant get enough Hispanics to do the work. When I see fields full of white college kids picking crops Ill think differently
917380002060165120 2017-10-09 13:23:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @original_cracka @TonyCastle16 @wolfgang_joseph And they still cant find labors to do those farm labor jobs, we have had this conversation before. Your generation wont work those jobs
917379227825197056 2017-10-09 13:20:26 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @original_cracka @TonyCastle16 @wolfgang_joseph Thats right, I bitch about Wall Street screwing us over, why you think these companies hire Hispanics, cheap labor, these companies dont want to pay a descent wage, why? If affects the bottom line, profits! Youre a smart guy you see this!
917373898697699328 2017-10-09 12:59:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @wolfgang_joseph @original_cracka @TonyCastle16 When are you little girls going stop crying about immigration, welfare & birth control?
917373533101182978 2017-10-09 12:57:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @wolfgang_joseph @TonyCastle16 Yet, you voted Trump
917373432039428096 2017-10-09 12:57:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @original_cracka @wolfgang_joseph @TonyCastle16 Aww, snowflake did I touch a nerve

917366496975826944 2017-10-09 12:29:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @wolfgang_joseph @TonyCastle16 What are you?
917244529069129732 2017-10-08 04:25:11 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @_kelsology @PAGilmore_CEO Ahh, I was going this say this!
917242386903904256 2017-10-08 04:16:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I dont vote because Wall Street runs the USA not the politicians in D.C
917239227846463489 2017-10-08 04:04:08 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @wolfgang_joseph @original_cracka Ill stay here & wait for this country to become white Somalia, thats where we are headed.
917238788795101185 2017-10-08 04:02:23 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Im well aware of the FAIR studies, they have come under fire for over inflating their estimates. No group has come up with reliable numbers that everybody can agree on, its a nearly impossible task
917234096933392384 2017-10-08 03:43:44 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @wolfgang_joseph I read the article you sent me, the numbers in the article seem off to me, but there no real reliable numbers from any source on this
917233468131684352 2017-10-08 03:41:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @BuildDeWall Im saying everybody fumbled the ball from Obama on down, it should have been all hands on deck to fix that problem
917233020591116291 2017-10-08 03:39:28 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @wolfgang_joseph The numbers in link are from FAIR which has an agenda & it never sited any CBO stats
917228907778183170 2017-10-08 03:23:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @BuildDeWall I doubt that but if you want it you pay for it, I want good infrastructure, still lead in drinking water in flint
917228468055703552 2017-10-08 03:21:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @wolfgang_joseph Sorry Bro, youll have to source that
917228272374702081 2017-10-08 03:20:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @wolfgang_joseph @original_cracka If you want the wall than you pay for it, I want my tax dollars going for things that will improve my life
917227700909215744 2017-10-08 03:18:19 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @wolfgang_joseph Ive only voted twice, in 08 I voted Obama & voted all other incumbents out of office regardless of party. I voted Hillary because Trump is full of shit & hes not a republican
917226992755503104 2017-10-08 03:15:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JMcfeels @wolfgang_joseph CBO says they put in more than they take out over the long run. Fix my roads,bridges & schools first
917225376325226496 2017-10-08 03:09:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> A red #MAGA hat is the same as an Antifa mask, dont @ me

917203905414656000 2017-10-08 01:43:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @kristieAP @AP_NFL Disastrous news for @HoustonTexans & their great fans!
917203380145197057 2017-10-08 01:41:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @WalshFreedom For someone who doesnt watch the NFL, you sure tweet & talk about it an awful lot!
917202473680556034 2017-10-08 01:38:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JackPosobiec @StefanMolyneux Says the guys complaining about NFL protests, free speech & liberty only when its conservatives doing the talking!
917184859528990720 2017-10-08 00:28:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @realJamesAllsup Oh, so we get to pick & choose where our tax money gets spent? You dont want to pay for BC, good I dont wanna pay for the wall. What form do I fill out for that?
917147104669298692 2017-10-08 21:58:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @Kaepernick7 @jbro_1776 @wolfgang_joseph Yes, jersey sales surge as new players come into the league & performance based surges, still revenue,we are taking about billions of dollars of revenue
917135254904823813 2017-10-08 21:10:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @latimes Nike made right call passing on this scrub, Hes a Ricky Rubio knockoff

917123433753956353 2017-10-08 20:24:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @Kaepernick7 @jbro_1776 @wolfgang_joseph Its still sales, even that player who came out for the anthem during Steelers game 2 weeks ago had a huge bump in jersey sales, its all revenue.
917121700466233345 2017-10-08 20:17:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @Kaepernick7 @jbro_1776 @wolfgang_joseph Still looking for year to year numbers, but Kaepernick not playing & ranked 17th on the seller list, league wide the number I hear being thrown about is $1.6 billion a year
917118743108390912 2017-10-08 20:05:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Cernovich @SteveMadden269 Citizens should not fear consequences from the Government for expressing their god given right to the pursuit of life liberty and happiness, which Trump is clearly trying to do & youre ok with it!
917117720201777152 2017-10-08 20:01:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @Kaepernick7 @jbro_1776 @wolfgang_joseph They said that last year, NFL broke attendance records in 2016, so my theory is people are mad but still going to the games
917117161767882752 2017-10-08 19:59:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Looks like the whole thing may have been faked, cries of desperation from this sad administration. Anything to push their narrative & agenda at any cost
917116438367875072 2017-10-08 19:56:12 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @Kaepernick7 @jbro_1776 @wolfgang_joseph Homeboys tweet said NFL revenues were down 18% which is a complete lie. Yeah,NFL made great deals especially with Amazon for streaming, its called business, boosting your revenue stream
917115659833823232 2017-10-08 19:53:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Cernovich @SteveMadden269 You clearly dont understand the Declaration of Independence or the line in it  Life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

917111307333197829 2017-10-08 19:35:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @TomiLahren I bet youd still let Kap work that tho! Just saying
917110904424198147 2017-10-08 19:34:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @jemelehill Very interesting
917109790303817728 2017-10-08 19:29:47 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Cernovich @SteveMadden269 Thats against the law, not standing for the anthem is not, this is a false equivalence
917107448430972928 2017-10-08 19:20:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Cernovich @SteveMadden269 Thats the whole point of liberty, you should be free from restrictions and consequences. If there is either, you dont have liberty
917106526275428353 2017-10-08 19:16:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Cernovich @SollenbergerRC Two of the pictures violate the flag code but who cares,right
917106291184726017 2017-10-08 19:15:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Cernovich Good God, The two arent even comparable,but I have no problem with either because I support liberty & freedom not forced patriotism!
917104372118671360 2017-10-08 19:08:15 UTC <JohnQPublic30> WTF is going on with the @steelers 2 pick 6s

917099615060742145 2017-10-08 18:49:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @willchamberlain What about liberty & freedom?
917099418012340226 2017-10-08 18:48:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @JackPosobiec Fake News! NFL profits never been higher
917098724584771584 2017-10-08 18:45:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Cernovich @SteveMadden269 Do you think people should be forced to stand for the anthem?
917097087690567683 2017-10-08 18:39:19 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Cernovich @SteveMadden269 Your inability to answer my question speaks volumes

917092677023346688 2017-10-08 18:21:47 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @SecondLady @VP @realDonaldTrump So youre admitting it was a coordinated public relations stunt!
917092405849088000 2017-10-08 18:20:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Cernovich @SteveMadden269 You conservatives seem to have a problem with liberty & freedom, I just wonder what thats about? Seems un-American to me, TBH

917081725796323330 2017-10-08 17:38:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Cernovich @SteveMadden269 Pences PR stunt was bogus, Pence has done far more damage to the state of Indiana than football players will ever do!

916708761494020097 2017-10-07 16:56:15 UTC <JohnQPublic30> I agree, I often wonder how many run of the mill anarchists have been swept up in the new revival.https://twitter.com/willchamberlain/status/916707322969378818
916706820240093185 2017-10-07 16:48:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Hey @willchamberlain do you see Antifa as garden variety anarchists? Some of their rhetoric is the same as when I was younger (80s) , had some run ins with them back in the day.

916691257916887040 2017-10-07 15:46:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @nf_reece Ive been watching your stuff about Dave Rubin, Ill be making a video about him later.
916688948268879872 2017-10-07 15:37:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @HappyNoLucky I told you, Im a bleeding heart libertarian 
916687567311040513 2017-10-07 15:32:01 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @nf_reece Ripping on Molynuex about his review of Kings IT great stuff
916686935158075392 2017-10-07 15:29:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @HappyNoLucky Just google political compass
916635224297082880 2017-10-07 12:04:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Come up with your own show, Fox News needs a late night comedy/variety show in its line up. https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/916634286811435008
916623792734121985 2017-10-07 11:18:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Finally took the political compass testpic.twitter.com/rLuYSbNco6
916623338231029762 2017-10-07 11:16:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> I just found @nf_reece s YouTube channel, good stuff so far. 
916461788320976896 2017-10-06 00:34:52 UTC <JohnQPublic30> So @RealJamesWoods is retiring after he got his ass handed to him by Armie Hammer & Amber Tamblyn 
916364048937226240 2017-10-06 18:06:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No, it is not, thats why scalping does not fall under repackaging laws & statues, the statues are about price control which is govt interference
916359034269298688 2017-10-06 17:46:33 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Repackaging for example would be if I brought a 12 pack of Coke-Cola & put my own label on it, ticket brokering clearly does not fit this definition
916356263205916673 2017-10-06 17:35:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph First off its not repackaging, the market dictates the price, you should have the right to resell something you purchased
916353792492306438 2017-10-06 17:25:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You seriously dont think its a stupid law, as I said no different than flipping a house or selling a used car above market value
916352796101922818 2017-10-06 17:21:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph They know how pointless it is, much better things to spend resources on, The web made it go mainstream
916350678553038848 2017-10-06 17:13:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Ive literally made thousands of transactions in front of cops, its pretty much decriminalized
916336677404241920 2017-10-06 16:17:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph So you clearly have a problem with a free market economy, what Im doing is no different than what millions & millions of businesses do every day.
916325519355936769 2017-10-06 15:33:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Which is basically what every business does, no different than flipping a home or selling a used car. The fact that you have a problem with this is horrific
916304233015672832 2017-10-06 14:08:47 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I charge a price that the market bears, calling it a fee is false, supply & demand
916292530773397505 2017-10-06 13:22:17 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph So you have a problem with them charging fees?
916288603436781568 2017-10-06 13:06:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph So let me get this straight, you have no problem with Wall Street charging customers with 401Ks fees but have a problem with me selling tickets at a price that the market dictates. Do you know what you sound like?
916148551243239424 2017-10-05 03:50:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Most states you dont need a license, impossible to enforce nowadays with the internet. Im a business man, buy low,sell high,just like the stock market
916139247949746176 2017-10-05 03:13:12 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Con man? How do you figure that?
916138790057586688 2017-10-05 03:11:23 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Numbers dont lie, but conservatives do when it comes to pushing the narrative!
916138600521224192 2017-10-05 03:10:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Ticket broker,Bro! No different than what you do playing the stock market
916137374442237952 2017-10-05 03:05:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Wrong ratings were pretty low in 2009-2010, Attendance of game goes up every year
916137011525947392 2017-10-05 03:04:19 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph My point all along, the NFL drop is minuscule
916136823478513665 2017-10-05 03:03:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Its business,Bro! Nothings going to chance because of the amount of money thats in play, my side gig is being a ticket broker, routinely charge 100-135% of face for NFL games
916136093204041728 2017-10-05 03:00:40 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Not likely as attendance is down a minuscule amount
916135877805473794 2017-10-05 02:59:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Viewership decline is minimal, both weekday games win their time slot by more than 3x
916134041631576065 2017-10-05 02:52:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Been going on for 40+ years & the politicians, republicans or Democrats always cave,why? Money,Money,Money
916133695341387776 2017-10-05 02:51:08 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Ratings have been mixed bag all year, SNF 3rd ranked show,TNF 4th ranked show last week, The early game on Fox last Sunday  (LA@Dal) had 20 million viewers higher than any prime time show on tv
916130615568879617 2017-10-05 02:38:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Im not talking about Trump, I really think you fail to realize just how big the NFL is & how much money it brings but these politicians know
916129655559802880 2017-10-05 02:35:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph As will Trump, there is just far too much money involved.
916128766212132864 2017-10-05 02:31:33 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Cmon Joseph, You know Obama tried to end tax exempt bonds for teams in all sports in 2015, youre being deliberately disingenuous
916061617670053888 2017-10-05 22:04:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Cernovich Imagine my shock! Ailes, OReilly & Now Weinstein, rich powerful men abusing their position! GOP & Democrats rotten to the core!

915603000495919105 2017-10-04 15:42:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Styx666Official Styx, do you have any thoughts on the theory that the reduction of Lead, ie, leaded gasoline, lead paints has led to lower crime rates? Overexposure to lead has been shown to increase aggressive behavior in humans
915310975737319424 2017-10-03 20:21:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @WalshFreedom Mixed bag,Joe, Fox single header was up 19% over last year, CBS was up 4% for early games but down big for late DH game -31% ! NFL viewing numbers still huge, all games except for London early A.M game had over 11 million viewers for each game

914919808738742272 2017-10-02 18:27:35 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @UndeniablePeace This point I agree with you, is is not fact, but many people believe that it is & live their lives as it does, so in that respect it does exist because these people have a belief system that they put into action.
914916893974257664 2017-10-02 18:16:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @UndeniablePeace No, Im saying they BELIEVE they think they are.
914916329525792768 2017-10-02 18:13:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @UndeniablePeace Are you saying MSM is MKUltra? The people that say they dont watch MSM are the same people that complain about it the most. You are not forced to watch MSM
914915764934725633 2017-10-02 18:11:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @UndeniablePeace Its exists because some people truly feel that it does!
914915312042221569 2017-10-02 18:09:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @UndeniablePeace No, Im saying that they think they are, as you believe you DONT think youre superior many many people truly believe they are.
914914397902041088 2017-10-02 18:06:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @UndeniablePeace No, you are letting these things control you, you have a choice.
914914003020853248 2017-10-02 18:04:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @UndeniablePeace This part I agree, but to say you dont believe in WS does not make it go away, WS exists because other people believe it exists regardless of how you act & what you beliefs are.
914912422850433025 2017-10-02 17:58:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @UndeniablePeace Bad analogy, you cant control what other people think, just because you dont think youre better doesnt mean other people dont think they are better.
914906901623791616 2017-10-02 17:36:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @UndeniablePeace Its not if YOU believe white supremacy exists, its if others do.

I think you are, no worries you would have run that team into the ground like you did the New Jersey Generals. The @buffalobills are better off with out you
914469558077009926 2017-10-01 12:38:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @deneenborelli @FoxNews @wolfgang_joseph I dont, huh? Explain to me who oversees this.

914323908014350336 2017-09-30 02:59:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @deneenborelli @FoxNews @wolfgang_joseph If you privatize social security, who oversees? The private sector? If so, such a system would be ripe for abuse by Financial institutions
914322187259084800 2017-09-30 02:52:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @deneenborelli @FoxNews @wolfgang_joseph Youre talking about turning peoples retirement over to the hands of Wall Street, recipe for disaster huge regulatory safeguards would have to be installed
914320332693139456 2017-09-30 02:45:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @deneenborelli @FoxNews @wolfgang_joseph The jury is still out on charter schools see Ohio as an example of school choice gone wrong. Both parties lack the political will to invest in the educational system, the subsidized charter school program is a cash grab
914319420138323968 2017-09-30 02:41:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @deneenborelli @FoxNews @wolfgang_joseph Which is a hard sell because whos going to oversee it? Wall Street? You will need a huge regulatory system in place to monitor millions of private accounts. Jobs are more of a focus for AA Community than SS to be honest, lower income AA not thinking that far ahead
914317770791292928 2017-09-30 02:35:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @deneenborelli @FoxNews @wolfgang_joseph How so? The Republican Party offers nothing to the AAs & Republicans know this thats why they went after working class Dems. Working class Dems will be a swing demographic for some time, actually they have been
914316734156476416 2017-09-30 02:31:11 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Normies wont hold if their Financial interests are not been met, its nothing more than a quick all be it somewhat effective fund raising ploy. Most peoples lives do not revolve around these issues
914315489102516225 2017-09-30 02:26:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @deneenborelli @FoxNews @wolfgang_joseph Black started leaving the Republican Party in the 1920s see Indiana,when the klan started to take over the Republican Party in that state, Republicans started to turn their backs on AA even that early.
914312845495595009 2017-09-30 02:15:44 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You dont need to engage in twitter to see his ideology, his tweets are plastered all over the web, are you saying normies dont go online? Sometimes you dont need to read that far into stuff sometimes its in plain view
914312053032194048 2017-09-30 02:12:35 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @deneenborelli @FoxNews @wolfgang_joseph Than why fundraise off the issue? People vote with their Financial interests more than identity politics, this is way I say this resembles the Reagan era so much, many Dems switched to Reagan in 80 & 84 but the switch didnt hold when Bush didnt hold to his promises in 88
914309048366968833 2017-09-30 02:00:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Pointless tactic, this guys twitter feed speaks for itself. Hes not hiding anything, very open about what hes doing & his viewpoints. This guy is a classic textbook anarchist.
914306859464609792 2017-09-30 01:51:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @deneenborelli @FoxNews @wolfgang_joseph Thats the secondary motive, its a fund raising tactic, its a weak identity politic driven ploy for money. Any party switch wont hold if economy goes south which could happen, the economy is functioning the same under Trump as Obama.
914305641652609024 2017-09-30 01:47:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph So whats that have to do with his viewing habits, read his twitter feed, hes a textbook anarchist!
914305200814460929 2017-09-30 01:45:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @deneenborelli @FoxNews @wolfgang_joseph Hes using the NFL anthem issue to raise money, prominent Republicans have already gotten fund raising emails from POTUS with a push poll.
914267105024970763 2017-09-30 23:13:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Who gives a shit about his viewing habits, bigger question is why an anarchist is teaching at a criminal justice university.
914265908327145472 2017-09-30 23:09:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> The NFL made an estimated $14 billion last year, @realDonaldTrump is mad hes not a part of the NFL, if he was hed never shut up about how great it is & how much money hed be making.
914262587176636416 2017-09-30 22:56:01 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Actually its really not that important when you look at the big picture, meaningless gesture when you think about it.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/914255264282480640
914243565835997184 2017-09-30 21:40:26 UTC <JohnQPublic30> This guy should be fired but who give a shit about his viewing habits!https://twitter.com/cernovich/status/914242782885269504
914228924590231553 2017-09-30 20:42:15 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @deneenborelli @FoxNews @wolfgang_joseph The damage to the Democrat party was done on April 30,2015 when Bernie Announced his candidacy. The flaw with Dems is if they dont like a candidate they dont vote unlike Republicans. This flag stuff will have very minimal effect on football.
914224876701044738 2017-09-30 20:26:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @deneenborelli @FoxNews @wolfgang_joseph This is a game both sides play & have been for decades, thats why I laugh when right wingers take the high road, so disingenuous & transparent. This will blow over with minimal damage to either side.
914222305018105856 2017-09-30 20:15:57 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @deneenborelli @FoxNews @wolfgang_joseph Thats literally identity politics & virtue signaling,another tactic the right claims they dont engage in.
914220059458965504 2017-09-30 20:07:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @deneenborelli @FoxNews @wolfgang_joseph You really dont think Trump is playing identity politics right now? This is a tactic that the right rails on the left about nonstop, I dont have a problem with the right doing it just be honest about it & stop denying that you dont play that game.
914217966933245953 2017-09-30 19:58:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @deneenborelli @FoxNews @wolfgang_joseph I think its more about race tbh, Its just further proof that the right only supports free speech when its their free speech, right wingers hate dissent in any form
914216618611347461 2017-09-30 19:53:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @deneenborelli @FoxNews @wolfgang_joseph Never demanded people embrace my POV! Ive only pointed out holes & lies in the conservative narrative. They are playing identity politics a game conservatives say they never play! IMO,the outrage has little to do with the flag & anthem.
914197848601890816 2017-09-30 18:38:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFL @deneenborelli @FoxNews I choose not to stand & take my hat off, its called FREEDOM embrace it,Deneen

914095532422959104 2017-09-30 11:52:12 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @THECristinaCain Did you see on the Rubin Report that RedPillBlack admitted she never was a liberal?
913792302262493186 2017-09-29 15:47:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Compared to last years top rated show its a 8.9 ratings drop. Growth of programs only tells a small part of story. Far more ways to view & more competition for entertainment
913786831124168705 2017-09-29 15:25:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph 1) Ratings for all sports are down  2) Ratings for TV overall are down compared to the late 90s,Seinfeld last top rated show to have a 20+ rating for the season 1997-98
913773015321792514 2017-09-29 14:30:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph RWers said attendance was down last year which was a lie.

913766819135201280 2017-09-29 14:06:01 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph So colleges are allowing theft now? Time for me to hit some campuss & get some free shit!

913744807243255809 2017-09-29 12:38:33 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph She stole his property & you think if he snatches it back hes going to jail  Did u hear his voice? Practically begging for the hat back #MAGA are pussies

913740518508699648 2017-09-29 12:21:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph It should be 200,000 to 250,000 lower than last year! Last year highest ever

913529946504667137 2017-09-28 22:24:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No, the overall picture is not ok because workers pay taxes, purchase goods,etc etc. lost revenue in a shrinking economy!
913528310302433280 2017-09-28 22:18:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph True, but how many techs you need, not many & not enough to replace the displaced workers
913527914691530753 2017-09-28 22:16:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph So if wages are going to go up once illegals are gone what you think is going to happen to those minimum wage jobs

913496682993680384 2017-09-28 20:12:35 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I can site study after study that says automation lowers wages with the added benefit of eliminating jobs
913496060294832129 2017-09-28 20:10:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Are you for rising the minimum wage?
913489144244039690 2017-09-28 19:42:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The effect is!
913460637963038721 2017-09-28 17:49:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph As wages go up so do prices, theres a ceiling to how much companies can/ will pay before it doesnt become cost effective to stay in business
913457153964412930 2017-09-28 17:35:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I said immigration is not the reason jobs are scarce, the impact is minimal
913456470867550208 2017-09-28 17:32:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Dude, I literally work in manufacturing I know exactly why we automate
913452136008167424 2017-09-28 17:15:35 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Immigration has been going on forever in this country, not the reason jobs are scarce.
913451793941745665 2017-09-28 17:14:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You have no idea why companies automate do you! 1) because they have a worker shortage usually due to low wages 2) to eliminate jobs
913432875516743680 2017-09-28 15:59:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Again beneficial for you not overall economy, studies have shown automation drives down wages & hurts local economypic.twitter.com/bXxBhWx3RR
913416769808867329 2017-09-28 14:55:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Unless those jobs are being taken by people (legals in you scenario) its not beneficial in economy only beneficial to the farmers. Lower labor cost
913375758025936897 2017-09-28 12:12:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @generalelectric @HappyNoLucky Im not disagreeing with you, its being disingenuous just calling out sports franchises
913375465888501760 2017-09-28 12:10:55 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph What are you taking about? Automation causes job loss, shrinks the available number of jobs
913372979601592320 2017-09-28 12:01:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @generalelectric @HappyNoLucky All major corporations get some kind of tax break or deferment, by Federal,State & Local! Especially if they create jobs
913372347155013633 2017-09-28 11:58:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Increasing productivity adds to the economy with human labor, job loss does not add to the economy!
913228406053056513 2017-09-27 02:26:33 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Replacing ppl with machines is not the answer either, machines dont contribute to the economy,people do
913228003089543168 2017-09-27 02:24:57 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph That has nothing to do with farm to fork! A lot of the tech is at least 10 years out as far as harvesting in the field.

913219166861225985 2017-09-27 01:49:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Even with the higher wages they still not getting workers,especially in California,they paying some workers $20 an hour,still cant get help
913217501508628481 2017-09-27 01:43:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If wages are increasing why are these farmers having trouble finding workers? Makes no sense
913216529826709508 2017-09-27 01:39:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The only time conservatives complain about this kind of thing is when sports teams do it, this shit is rampant in American business

905093957390131200 2017-09-05 15:43:09 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Again the action by hosting company was business decision as was gabs response

905084054403506176 2017-09-05 15:03:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @HappyNoLucky Yes, now please explain how the government is stopping you from doing this?
905081796341190657 2017-09-05 14:54:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @HappyNoLucky Government is not interfering
905077600644734976 2017-09-05 14:38:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @HappyNoLucky I can only assume you're talking about the Colorado wedding cake case that's going to Supreme Court. Your question is pretty loaded

905071464633827328 2017-09-05 14:13:47 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @HappyNoLucky I am on topic, you seem to have a lot of time to ponder trivial matters like wedding cakes 
905062697749897216 2017-09-05 13:38:57 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The hosting company acted in it own self interest to protect its business & profits something you seem to have a problem with
905062286544523264 2017-09-05 13:37:19 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph And how is that the hosting company's fault? They made a business decision based on that, happens all the time
905060633191878656 2017-09-05 13:30:44 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph We are not in that business, but a hosting company would I'm sure they'd want to everything about their business
905059056657846273 2017-09-05 13:24:28 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Their hosting site would, you'd be shocked about the info at highest levels of companies
905057410926170112 2017-09-05 13:17:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @HappyNoLucky WOW! Too much time on your hands, do u worried about which public bathrooms people use too?
905057005613838336 2017-09-05 13:16:19 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph That info is not hard to find out! We literally don't let some of vendors on our floor cause we know they sell to competitors
905054561399963648 2017-09-05 13:06:37 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @HappyNoLucky Uncle Sam gives them money so it's a little more than that, but keep worrying bout welfare mothers 
905054179860807680 2017-09-05 13:05:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph And the hosting site made a business decision based on that. We have customer complaints all the time, you have to make Business decisions
905051450824433666 2017-09-05 12:54:15 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph For the most part,yes! We also know what our competitors are doing.
905048460109520898 2017-09-05 12:42:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @HappyNoLucky 1) corporations run your life not the Government 2) I know the Government is not out to destroy me, they would have already done it

905042693000192000 2017-09-05 12:19:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Good, than gab won't have anything to worry about! You are making this an ideological fight when it's a business decision
905041549117054977 2017-09-05 12:14:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The hosting site was making a preemptive move to avoid losing customers because of gab!
905040479615627266 2017-09-05 12:10:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph There's noting to expose, this is not a conspiracy,it's business. Plain & simple. Free market in action

905035511819104256 2017-09-05 11:50:55 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No, their hosting site made a business decision, ask gab to remove post or boot them. More profitable to boot them than lose customers

904756764792545280 2017-09-04 17:23:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph You believe the true seat of power lies at 1600 Pennsylvania ave when it's 126 miles to NE at Wall Street! Corporations run  2)
904756331638382593 2017-09-04 17:21:33 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph The problem with u r attempted reform is you're too hang up on ideologies, Democrats & Republicans not that much different 1)
904754648434823168 2017-09-04 17:14:52 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph Many on your side have been "black pilled" maybe not so much pure nihilists but exhibiting nihilistic behaviors
904751398524473345 2017-09-04 17:01:57 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph You are nihilist in the fact your side wants to tear down the system & rebuild in your image, many on Right don't feel that way
904749933122777088 2017-09-04 16:56:08 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph Trump probably would have lost if not for evangelical vote, unwise to dismiss
904749750389493762 2017-09-04 16:55:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph Older people tend to vote in higher numbers & the "new right" is in its infancy, many challenges ahead.
904747998265184260 2017-09-04 16:48:26 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph Which is way the political climate is so interesting & volatile right now. I see the party's fracturing at some point
904747712083611648 2017-09-04 16:47:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph I agree there is a "new right" but it's quite a few years away from being a force. Religious right still a major influence on the party
904744190164262912 2017-09-04 16:33:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph I disagree, Trump sucked up heavy to the evangelicals,still a major force on the right, one of the reason I despise the right
904740730400362505 2017-09-04 16:19:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph That doesn't mean the child will grow up to be right wing.

904554391574908929 2017-09-03 03:59:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph I'm a realist! I survived Nixon,Ford,Carter,Reagan,Bush, Clinton,Bush2 & Obama. Trump is no different

904543214597791744 2017-09-03 03:14:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @CassandraRules @wolfgang_joseph All that is basically a wash when you add everything up! They put into the system (economy) critics argue but it's close to break even

903677385106759680 2017-09-01 17:54:12 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Than your other expenses must be huge! Nature of your business I'm guessing
903677061931388929 2017-09-01 17:52:55 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Unable to pass a drug test,poor work history & lack of transportion

903676219660611585 2017-09-01 17:49:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph My guess it's people
903676180439683072 2017-09-01 17:49:25 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If they ran lean & mean (cutting employees) that profit margin would increase! Look at your company's P&L's & tell me it's #1 expense ...
903675328756895745 2017-09-01 17:46:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Look at unemployment rate how much farther u think it's gonna fall?
903674962917122048 2017-09-01 17:44:35 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph But Carrier wants more so they blackmailed Trump & that stupid fucker bought it. They will move or automate which they are already doing
903674619219103744 2017-09-01 17:43:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Are u nuts? Why do you think Carrier threatened to move? Cheap labor & higher profits. That plant has always turned a profit...
903673903666651137 2017-09-01 17:40:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Little to do with Trump, my state has a worker shortage must rise wages to compete. I've been through this before! Mid to late 90's
903673359891881984 2017-09-01 17:38:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Who's hiring this cheap labor & why? Carrier in Indiana a prime example
903673012930699264 2017-09-01 17:36:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Companies, Americans do. American workers been sold out be corporate greed
903672814699470848 2017-09-01 17:36:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Because it's a small factor, they( corporate ) have been slow destroying the middle class for 50+ years, immigrants don't run these....
903671695529177089 2017-09-01 17:31:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The USA is running of of boogy men. Blacks,Irish,Eastern Europeans,Asians now Muslims. We need to invent a new race

903626012289896453 2017-09-01 14:30:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Your still missing my point, they won't destroy 
903624762546692096 2017-09-01 14:25:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph More to it than that
903620361144631298 2017-09-01 14:07:37 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph My point was ppl were against Asians coming here now embraced
903619980578709508 2017-09-01 14:06:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I was quoting Asian numbers as an example of how attitudes change over time
903618559523397632 2017-09-01 14:00:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Now the new breed of conservative praises them, the old guard hated them with a passion
903618558323806208 2017-09-01 14:00:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph 62% of  was against it, my conservative friends parents bitched abt non stop "will destroy the county" they said ....
903617767009640448 2017-09-01 13:57:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph BS, when I was a teen it was abt Asians & Boat ppl, in 1979 they doubled the number of boat ppl in here from 7000 to 14000 a month
903615095409868800 2017-09-01 13:46:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Immigration is not a new problem in  it's always been a scapegoat issue for politicians
903614984470581248 2017-09-01 13:46:15 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No, when corporate America figured out they could get rid of it & improve their bottom line & damn the American worker
903612221271531520 2017-09-01 13:35:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Very little to do with advancing tech, they started doing this in the early/middle 80's
903611979973234688 2017-09-01 13:34:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The number one reason defined pensions disappeared is companies got rid of them it boosts the bottom. Corporate profits soared after that...
903607344524906497 2017-09-01 13:15:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Why do you think ppl are switching jobs so much? No defined pension plans, no reason for loyalty
903606496327602177 2017-09-01 13:12:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I'm for the old way, defined pensions, SS & 401(k) it used to be a 3 pronged system
903606128365404160 2017-09-01 13:11:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No, $1 million is asswipe money to Trump
903598541590974465 2017-09-01 12:40:55 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Take a look at what the average American has in their 401(k) even the inventor Ted Benna regrets inventing it. He took a major hit in '08
903597787878744065 2017-09-01 12:37:55 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Here are two prominent Trump Supporters calling for Civil War! And I'm suppose to be scared pic.twitter.com/uCEWyoyTgW

903045427225907201 2017-08-30 00:03:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Hybrid pensions yes, defined pension plans are at abt 4% down from 60% in early 80's
903042193035849729 2017-08-30 23:50:11 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph As for SS it was never meant to be sole source of retirement so thank the boomers for getting rid of pensions
903041844065566720 2017-08-30 23:48:47 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Late boomers are & most still working, I'm just barely Gen X so, there's plenty of boomers still put into the system
903039738948591616 2017-08-30 23:40:26 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Are you nuts? Boomers living longer than ever which BTW is part of the problem
903038625537024000 2017-08-30 23:36:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Most of my Gen still working & will work longer than boomers!
903038298012221440 2017-08-30 23:34:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Boomers not yet done taking out of system so that remains to be seen,
903037253580201985 2017-08-30 23:30:33 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph As my gen funded for the boomers so tell me again why I'm to feel sorry for you gen? YOU are literally winning the game right now
903036128399417344 2017-08-30 23:26:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @redpillblack @RedPillBlack Since you've taken the "red pill" & talked about Chicago, I'd love to her some of your solutions for helping that city

903006348136370176 2017-08-30 21:27:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I not wishing struggle more pointing out YOU are way ahead of the curve & no Gen Xer will take your viewpoints seriously
902997825419710467 2017-08-30 20:53:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Than they need to be like you & work harder! No excuses
902986501319008260 2017-08-30 20:08:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The fact that you catch attitude for every Gen Xer you talk to should really tell you something, you will never find pity from them
902985974078205953 2017-08-30 20:06:47 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Making descent money till early/middle thirty's
902985821812338688 2017-08-30 20:06:11 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph That's right but you're still ahead of ppl in my Gen that had college degrees in 1994! Most ppl in know in my gen really didn't start ...
902981062812471300 2017-08-30 19:47:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Inflation calculator, $65000 today is equal to $39721 in 1994 I wasn't making any where near that back then
902977287263576066 2017-08-30 19:32:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I don't pity u r gen at all, every millennial I know is doing far better off than I did at that age!
902976989866360835 2017-08-30 19:31:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Ahead of any Gen Xer I've known, based on what u earn, u have roughly 60% more purchasing power than I did at your age. So yeah....
902976561627967490 2017-08-30 19:29:23 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Cause I don't know a single Gen Xer that would feel sorry for you. If what u tell me is the truth abt what u earn u are light years....
902972915771097088 2017-08-30 19:14:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Have you ever said this to a Gen Xer? Did they feel sorry for you? Seriously curious
902952493163917318 2017-08-30 17:53:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You millennials love your built in excuses! If you can't make it, it's your fault
902949249800949760 2017-08-30 17:40:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The Boomers screwed my Gen over! U work & overcome. As I said your plight or should I say imagined plight is no different or special
902947366445166592 2017-08-30 17:33:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You're missing the point every gen has to over come failures of predecessors, you're not different or special
902941839111708677 2017-08-30 17:11:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The only generation that had it easy so to say is the G.I Generation, if u were a boomer you'd be complaining abt them.
902935583479169024 2017-08-30 16:46:33 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You have to make your own way in life, pervious gens should have no effect on you if each gen has failures. We all go through it
902918550230327296 2017-08-30 15:38:52 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You have a hang up abt previous generations. Each gen complains abt the previous Gen. you'll face the same when u get older 
902915164529414145 2017-08-30 15:25:25 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph By a teacher. You Gen is weak & cuddled
902914906483253248 2017-08-30 15:24:23 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Had my admin tell me to drop out when I was 16 that was 35 yrs ago. Had 2 teachers take swings at me,saw another student assaulted ...
902912134874583044 2017-08-30 15:13:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph They did it to you face, no escape. Teacher & Admin stood by & let it happen more times than not. Far different time
902911695810691072 2017-08-30 15:11:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Suicide is promoted in school, get real! Suicide & bullying have been around forever. My gen u didn't get bullied online...
902908529585029120 2017-08-30 14:59:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Which many say tech is to blame, and suicidal behavior didn't exist in past? The difference it's more widely talked abt now thx to internet
902906927109349378 2017-08-30 14:52:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Studies show different
902906816434233345 2017-08-30 14:52:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I literally helped coach a girls HS basketball team & I'm still in contact with these kids so yeah I have an idea
902902753000869892 2017-08-30 14:36:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph They have none to share because they have none!
902902599761973248 2017-08-30 14:35:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph That's my point, they spend far too much time in front of the screen instead of interacting with ppl, this is not debatable.
902898345009655810 2017-08-30 14:18:35 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Very few share personal experiences, just sitting in front of a screen being led by pied pipers like Southern, Molyneux & the like
902897723896197120 2017-08-30 14:16:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph One of my new obsessions is watching millennial & gen z woman give their testimonials on YT abt being "red pilled" ....
902890565574033408 2017-08-30 13:47:40 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If you have to be "red pilled" your a follower in the first place.
902890348476858369 2017-08-30 13:46:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph As I have seen the woman so called "red pilled" by Right are followers, followers have no loyalty.
902889909031243776 2017-08-30 13:45:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph That's a problem, if the economy improves as u think it will those low soc-eco whites won't need the mvt anymore.
902878663644983297 2017-08-30 13:00:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Not so much gynocentric as far more options for them. If your hanging a movement on woman it will fail
902874309827448836 2017-08-30 12:43:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Which will change, woman change more often & more rapidly than men in general
902873916657557504 2017-08-30 12:41:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Want that type of man the normies left the scene
902873744930201601 2017-08-30 12:40:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph It's the same with music, many normies got into heavy metal in the 80's thinking they'd get laid when they found out the woman didn't
902873376355647488 2017-08-30 12:39:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Not really point of my tweet, men following woman into a Mvt is superficial & wouldn't hold the numbers. The men will eventually leave
902871419650002944 2017-08-30 12:31:35 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Wrong, many normies joined the free love/hippie Mvt in 60's not from social Conscience but to get laid. Different time now
902856307887177729 2017-08-30 11:31:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph But there's a faction to your side that can't stop that! Plus celebrities on alt right turn off as many ppl as they turn on
902855809067081728 2017-08-30 11:29:33 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Effective as a recruiting tool in the beginning but if the men find out they're not getting laid they will leave.
902623492893499392 2017-08-29 20:06:25 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @wolfgang_joseph ANTIFA believes the elites control the govt & media( sound familiar) hence their direct action, most Anarchists are socialist/communist
902617670067126272 2017-08-29 19:43:17 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @wolfgang_joseph That's where u are wrong,All news is manipulation, Antifa are garden variety anarchist's! They believe News is fake too
902604120472915968 2017-08-29 18:49:26 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @wolfgang_joseph Trump let this genie out of the bottle, all news is fake & propaganda.

897948748134928386 2017-08-16 22:30:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph That is definitely debatable, even Technology experts are split on this
897939248157995008 2017-08-16 21:52:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Many companies are being forced to automate due to lack of manpower. Many ppl unwilling to work or are un hireable
897938487743307776 2017-08-16 21:49:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Trump is not going to destroy corporations, corporations run the world.
897933985774321664 2017-08-16 21:31:59 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Businesses in my state have a worker shortage almost full employment, employers are really struggling
897933658174214144 2017-08-16 21:30:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You really don't know how Business works, workers are the last think shareholders care about!

897903132113604609 2017-08-16 19:29:23 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I'm talking Corporate America dislikes Trump, common man loves him & will be disappointed
897901486079868928 2017-08-16 19:22:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The only thing corporate America wants from the common man is his money! They don't Like Trump cuz they think he's a bad business man
897887347047620608 2017-08-16 18:26:40 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @WalshFreedom This Pastor is trolling for publicity
897876652990107650 2017-08-16 17:44:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @YouTube @Styx666Official Wouldn't Trump calling out just ANTIFA put himself into a narrow box so say!
897876343966322691 2017-08-16 17:42:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @YouTube @Styx666Official In your opinion did Trump use Alt-Left to encompass more of the left wing ideology instead of just calling out ANTIFA?
897870807417974786 2017-08-16 17:20:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @NFLWrld But how much stock can you put into ESPN's power rankings?
897863577536778241 2017-08-16 16:52:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The Media is the propaganda arm of the corporate elite which Trump has always been a part of. All corporations are globalist's
897860191873630209 2017-08-16 16:38:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If true than they are complicit & involved with Trump on some form of end game,they played his game far too willingly
897795283169546240 2017-08-16 12:20:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The media can't be this stupid to see they are being used by Trump, they have to be in on it
897795029598687233 2017-08-16 12:19:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I don't like Trump but putting the media in cages as props during the election was sheer brilliance, he's still doing it at rallies
897780977577144321 2017-08-16 11:23:59 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I'm really starting to think the media is in on it
897585310342754304 2017-08-15 22:26:28 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Trump went after the left  @wolfgang_joseph
897576331701039104 2017-08-15 21:50:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph @axios The DEA has been trying to get these 3 to play ball for years,they just thumb their noses at DEA
897575747170312192 2017-08-15 21:48:28 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph @axios This has been going on for years, Amerisourse Bergen had one of its distribution center shut down from shipping opioids in '06
897574987070099456 2017-08-15 21:45:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph @guypbenson Don't have a problem tearing that statue down

897214897200803840 2017-08-14 21:54:35 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If you voted in 2012,who'd you vote for? Just curious
897204193240510465 2017-08-14 21:12:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @YouTube @Styx666Official I'm curious too see if the ppl in center mobilize to fight both factions, many ppl like me detest both sides & many will fight I believe
897202297054343170 2017-08-14 21:04:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @YouTube @Styx666Official Do you see people in the middle/center fighting both sides or do you see them eventually being absorbed by one of the two?
897200630430924804 2017-08-14 20:57:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @YouTube @Styx666Official Do you see the country fragmenting or do u think one of the ideologies will win out? Left or Right?
897135740055937026 2017-08-14 16:40:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Played his cards right! The 47% comment fucked him
897135591212634112 2017-08-14 16:39:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph A good part of the current republican base now is made up of a lot of 1st time voters! Romney could have beat O in '12 if he'd had
897134741631229952 2017-08-14 16:36:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Still does not change fact that money is still flowing in!
897132946720784384 2017-08-14 16:28:57 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph No they aren't, right wing group still accept their money that's not hatred
897131012177760256 2017-08-14 16:21:15 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yet you don't believe these right wing & libertarian groups don't have high buck donors
897130586015485952 2017-08-14 16:19:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @AndrewQuackson @MicroMagicJuice @wolfgang_joseph I'd love to see vote tally
897127161471131649 2017-08-14 16:05:57 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I disagree! Dems no control over Antifa as the Republicans  has no control over the Alt Right
897125569057480704 2017-08-14 15:59:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If the Dems did denounce Antifa do you think they'd stop?
897116904426491904 2017-08-14 15:25:12 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yup, when most ppl can't think for themselves it's a big problem
897115487510949888 2017-08-14 15:19:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph All media is dishonest! Internet media outlets no more honest than corporate media
897112744385753089 2017-08-14 15:08:40 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I thought you hated the media?
897112530711195648 2017-08-14 15:07:49 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph BS! Why you think that chopper was there! C'mon man
897110800560771072 2017-08-14 15:00:57 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Reaction from whom? The media?
897110601406853120 2017-08-14 15:00:09 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph BS! LEO's believed they were outgunned. Cops not going to put life on the line for "Dancing Monkeys" especially after 2 already died
897109676122419201 2017-08-14 14:56:28 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If left wingers are terrorists than the same holds true for Right Wingers! It's intellectually dishonest to say otherwise
897108859449462784 2017-08-14 14:53:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Doubt it, police wanted to act yesterday but held back due to amount of firepower in average citizens hands (mostly RWers hands BTW)
897108112326393856 2017-08-14 14:50:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph One of the things this kid did yesterday is cause left wingers to arm themselves. More lefties & progressives are buying guns
897107804393275392 2017-08-14 14:49:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Like I said, cops will stand down until the city starts getting torn apart, they do not care about individuals on either side
897107106117148672 2017-08-14 14:46:16 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Because numerous individuals there with semi auto weapons! Cops not going to die to protect some right wingers or left wingers
897106785408090112 2017-08-14 14:44:59 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Here's the deal, the cops could care less if they beat each other to dust. They call it the "Monkey Dance"! Cops stood down yesterday
897105393515732992 2017-08-14 14:39:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Who do you want? Who's going to be the deal clincher for you? Because I've seen plenty on left denouncing
897103110061076481 2017-08-14 14:30:23 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yes, to a point! Antifa are far left anarchists & would be protesting even if Hillary won. Many on both sides are embracing these tactics
897095440730132481 2017-08-14 13:59:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph As should the right, both sides playing a dangerous game,but the seeds have been sowed by fringe groups on both sides
897093442110664704 2017-08-14 13:51:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Timcast @wolfgang_joseph Still does change the facts they are funding the right & have enacted many libertarian policies around the US! See Ferguson,MO
897091973412253697 2017-08-14 13:46:08 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Timcast @wolfgang_joseph Doesn't not mean they are not funding the right & libertarians
897091048882786304 2017-08-14 13:42:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Timcast @wolfgang_joseph Koch Brothers for one, they have been for 30+ years
897090853138829312 2017-08-14 13:41:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Timcast @wolfgang_joseph No! Jack hates us
897088597110788098 2017-08-14 13:32:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Timcast @wolfgang_joseph Fragmentation of the country is what's happening perpetrated by Left & Right
897088249969213441 2017-08-14 13:31:20 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Timcast @wolfgang_joseph As is the right they are being funded as well!
897087521770934272 2017-08-14 13:28:26 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Timcast @wolfgang_joseph So what! Calling out groups is meaningless more hyperbole. Make no mistake Joseph,We are at war. This has been building for 30+ years
897081428323819520 2017-08-14 13:04:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Timcast @wolfgang_joseph As I stated, I have friends on left & right been called both, hyperbole! nazi & Marxist are easy go to trigger words
897078598682759168 2017-08-14 12:52:59 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Timcast @wolfgang_joseph Plenty online defending the car attack! All these things u mentioned how did they start! Words! It is what is is.
897077308728766464 2017-08-14 12:47:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Timcast @wolfgang_joseph No it isn't, I've been called both, it's hyperbole & the lowest common denominator.
897068337867493382 2017-08-14 12:12:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Timcast @wolfgang_joseph Calling ppl nazis & marxist is hyperbole something both sides are most than happy to engage in
897068085781377024 2017-08-14 12:11:13 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Timcast @wolfgang_joseph First off, neither side has ever lost their free speech right. No one is in prison for speech for either side.
897064258449670144 2017-08-14 11:56:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Timcast @wolfgang_joseph C'mon Joseph, You're being intellectually dishonest both sides are playing that game
896929461773287424 2017-08-13 03:00:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @AndrewQuackson @EricPattonPsi @wolfgang_joseph Left to stupid to see that far
896929361541988352 2017-08-13 02:59:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @AndrewQuackson @EricPattonPsi @wolfgang_joseph Nah, the left welcomes too many immigrants of all kinds I.E Russians for example. Sidebar most Muslim men I know that could vote,voted Trump
896927631894953985 2017-08-13 02:53:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @AndrewQuackson @EricPattonPsi @wolfgang_joseph By what logic?
896926320101384192 2017-08-13 02:47:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @AndrewQuackson @EricPattonPsi @wolfgang_joseph The smartest move is to arm yourself & stay financially liquid, Antifa & Alt Right are flip sides of same coin. Stone Cold Killers

893589419369869314 2017-08-04 21:48:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You understand it eliminates a job period, that job could go to a legal worker
893587147785203712 2017-08-04 21:39:12 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You do understand automation is doing more harm to your Gen than immigration
893573129708212224 2017-08-04 20:43:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Farmers looking too replace workers with machines if wages continue to rise! Even with HC still can't fill the fields
893572740409683969 2017-08-04 20:41:57 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Again you did not read article. Worker shortage many farmers switching to less labor intensive crops to survive
893553310262677504 2017-08-04 19:24:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Apparently you didn't read the article,it plainly states farmers are having trouble filling jobs even at higher wages
893534557001199618 2017-08-04 18:10:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @Cernovich @wolfgang_joseph Read the entire article. Wages are up & they still can get workers to work the fields.http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-farms-immigration/
893343100906741760 2017-08-03 05:29:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @YouTube @handymayhem It's the white owned companies that are telling the temp service in Chicago not to hire blacks. Quit spreading fake news to prop ur agenda

892199425778610176 2017-07-31 01:44:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @wolfgang_joseph Technology always eliminates human labor whether it be slave or wage labor is my point
892157579228585984 2017-07-31 22:58:37 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @wolfgang_joseph More & more jobs are being replaced by technology across all job sectors, white collar & blue collar are being effected
892151811175587846 2017-07-31 22:35:41 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @wolfgang_joseph The Technology side of argument is machines are almost always cheaper than labor paid or unpaid
892151520229306373 2017-07-31 22:34:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @wolfgang_joseph 1st they've been arguing the economics of slavery for 100+ years! Rising cost of land & price of slaves payed a factor!

884190948661620737 2017-07-09 23:22:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Government subsidizing the housing industry
884187662680240128 2017-07-09 23:09:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Good luck ending that deduction! I'm also against the Mortgage interest deduction as well
884183850548686854 2017-07-09 22:53:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Some of those 120 million have multiple kids which = multiple deductions
884183024304361472 2017-07-09 22:50:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The deduction lowers your taxable income,  how you receive back depends on what you claimed on W-2 form
884181160502407168 2017-07-09 22:43:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If they work they're having taxes taking out
884178379800555520 2017-07-09 22:32:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Huh? And what would you say THAT number is?
884177009731043328 2017-07-09 22:26:40 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You can deduct $4000 for a child, 74 million or so in us comes out to $296 billion
884176105506316289 2017-07-09 22:23:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph In my bio it says Ex-Libertarian,cause once I understood money I realized I'm getting a bargain for my tax dollar
884175675258699776 2017-07-09 22:21:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph In 2016 SNAP was $70 billion
884174855993790464 2017-07-09 22:18:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph $70 but what $10 billion right
884173931988615168 2017-07-09 22:14:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Source that $330 billion number?
884172939301715969 2017-07-09 22:10:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph BS! It $296 billion hardly a small number
884171001151574017 2017-07-09 22:02:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph A direct subsidy is the Government giving you cash i.e. Farm subsidies. Indirect subsidies are a tax deduction or tax break
884170437760045056 2017-07-09 22:00:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Are you required by law to have children? No! It's a personal choice! You can't afford them & need a tax deduction don't have them
884169903531577344 2017-07-09 21:58:26 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph The Government letting you take a deduction is an "indirect subsidy"
884169054348509184 2017-07-09 21:55:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph So your against welfare but for Government subsidizing lifestyle choices
884168444719099905 2017-07-09 21:52:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Claiming your child as a deduction on your taxes is a indirect subsidy.
884167798150373376 2017-07-09 21:50:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I also bet you have no problem with the indirect subsidy the govt gives to people for having kids!
884167221664206849 2017-07-09 21:47:47 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I bet u have no problem with rich farmers taking subsidies though right! 
884166270945570816 2017-07-09 21:44:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Ahh, the old I'm overtaxed & the welfare rats are sucking it up!

884160593376272386 2017-07-09 21:21:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Take it from someone who's older! Find a happy balance you're only young once!
884157272536080389 2017-07-09 21:08:15 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If your working 80 hours to get the things you need you're doing something wrong
884156568551477250 2017-07-09 21:05:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I'm saying you act entitled not you are! I'm just judging by the tone of your tweets!
884153957777637376 2017-07-09 20:55:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph More of that conservative bs attitude! "I work harder,I make better choices therefore....."
884153636644950016 2017-07-09 20:53:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Really,I don't live the working class life? Just because you're working class don't make you special!

884118012395126784 2017-07-09 18:32:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You sound like every other conservative I know! "My choices are the best,my way of life is the only way" meanwhile gettin help whole time

884096910679781376 2017-07-09 17:08:23 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Exactly why I asked the question! Major leg up financially. Basically you can't fail if it pans out the way you say

884091767699722242 2017-07-09 16:47:57 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yes, but ultimately you don't control the outcome! Question, you seem young are you a homeowner?

884070773568282624 2017-07-09 15:24:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem Yet you ignore the progress specifically in Chicago. Homicide stats far lower today than 70's,80's & 90's

883006910605262849 2017-07-06 16:57:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @toddmillionaire @wolfgang_joseph You stated generational wealth is the hardest to keep. It's hard for people who don't respect money it's quite easy if you do
883004958790090752 2017-07-06 16:49:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @toddmillionaire @wolfgang_joseph You're were implying outside factors were at play when it's people's own inability to handle their finances thats the real culprit
882964954785173504 2017-07-06 14:10:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @toddmillionaire @wolfgang_joseph That comes from a lack of respect of money from 2nd & 3rd generations! Respect for money can & should be taught
882937902531039232 2017-07-06 12:22:54 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @toddmillionaire @wolfgang_joseph Generational wealth is very easy to keep if you have a healthy respect for money, I know many who are set up quite well from Gen wealth

882562388830019588 2017-07-05 11:30:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @DailyCaller They are all buddies
882562161138073600 2017-07-05 11:29:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Shout out to @CNN & all the meme makers for providing me with free entertainment! #CNNBlackmail
882555698076413957 2017-07-05 11:04:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem So how is spreading misinformation any different than what CNN does? 
882474194998620160 2017-07-04 05:40:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yes,you can! Bad ethics but not illegal
882471795047235584 2017-07-04 05:30:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @kingdonomics They also believed in separation of church & state & were conscious of using the word God as plural
882465589087940608 2017-07-04 05:06:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph That's not a crime either, bad journalistic ethics but not a crime
882462675468513280 2017-07-04 04:54:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph They said they reserve the right to release if anything changes which they do, you may not agree with it
882461244883697665 2017-07-04 04:48:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Which they can post anytime without repercussion! This is still a blurry area for journalists especially in the Digital age
882460032192966656 2017-07-04 04:44:01 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph They have not doxxed him from what I see
882459713711083521 2017-07-04 04:42:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph So tell me how they broke the law in getting his info?
882458516186857472 2017-07-04 04:38:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @wolfgang_joseph Not quite what they said, but they have to right to print his name
882458025298145280 2017-07-04 04:36:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @wolfgang_joseph Your name is public record anybody can search it! You'd be surprised what info is public record
882457553535414272 2017-07-04 04:34:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @wolfgang_joseph It is not against to law for a News Organization to print someone's name, he is part of the story!
882455648553897986 2017-07-04 04:26:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @wolfgang_joseph His name is not private intel & this is not the first journalist to do this! Remember Lou Dobbs at Fox
882453773020430336 2017-07-04 04:19:09 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @wolfgang_joseph Names are public record! I seriously doubt CNN would be charged
882453022084935680 2017-07-04 04:16:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @wolfgang_joseph And threatened to post his name?
882452266594250752 2017-07-04 04:13:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @wolfgang_joseph This will turn out to be nothing! CNN found nothing that he didn't already post about himself! I feel sorry for neither side
882450984882102272 2017-07-04 04:08:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @kingdonomics The Bible is the west  get over yourself! Care to tell me what other books I haven't read! That's arrogance
882450551199342592 2017-07-04 04:06:21 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @wolfgang_joseph Oh well, that's on him

882446933834559488 2017-07-04 03:51:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @kingdonomics What you believe I did is of no concern to me, bible has been a detriment to the west
882445584610865152 2017-07-04 03:46:37 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @wolfgang_joseph No, I just don't give a fuck, Han Solo knew the game!
882445271967334402 2017-07-04 03:45:22 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @kingdonomics Ignorant would mean I've never read the Bible but I have! I think it's garbage
882444445152534528 2017-07-04 03:42:05 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @wolfgang_joseph People that worry about the media are fools & easily led & misled

871040443777257472 2017-06-03 16:26:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph If people come here & play by the rules I have no problem with immigration! We have lots of Muslims at my job that bust ass....
870830046352748544 2017-06-02 02:30:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph 30 full time & depending on day 30-40 temps, maybe 20% native speakers
870828036157001728 2017-06-02 02:22:37 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Contractors do make good money but the floor workers don't & won't at least in my industry
870826974230581249 2017-06-02 02:18:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Everything else is basically relays,switches,size 50 chain & sprockets & bearings
870826652259024896 2017-06-02 02:17:07 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Yup! For major tech work like touch screens & motherboards! Cheaper to contract that out than keep someone in house
870825397784649731 2017-06-02 02:12:08 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Not outsourcing overseas but major work on Machines! My bad poor explanation on my part
870825071706877952 2017-06-02 02:10:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph How much it costs to operate our plant & our payroll, payroll still our #1 expense but dropping due to fewer employees
870824619548319744 2017-06-02 02:09:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Technical work I'll give you that! But you have no idea the cost of maintaining a facility! I look at our P & L's daily I know....
870823779697651714 2017-06-02 02:05:42 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Actually the day to day maintenance on the machines is quite simple everything else gets outsourced!
870822838000910336 2017-06-02 02:01:58 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Are u in manufacturing/production? If so what do you produce?
870821955443798017 2017-06-02 01:58:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You don't get it! Companies won't pay button pushers high wages! If it comes to that they will go temp workers. Low wages no benefits
870821215790936064 2017-06-02 01:55:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Ohh & going back to taxes! Any part we buy for our machines that make our product is tax exempt runs into the hundreds of thousands 4 us
870820689028276224 2017-06-02 01:53:25 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph You have no idea what you are talking about! #1 reason we got our line is too reduce workforce! Payroll eats into margins & profits
870819949845114881 2017-06-02 01:50:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph My company just reduced the wage of line leads their job got easier they stand there & press a touch screen
870819586165399552 2017-06-02 01:49:03 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Never happen, you think a company is going to pay high wages to a worker pressing a button that's the whole point of automation reduce cost

870815729284763648 2017-06-02 01:33:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph We've cut our workforce in half the last six years due to automation! Jobs remaining filled by low wage temps!
870812456620367872 2017-06-02 01:20:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Automated to stay competitive like my company! Machines do the work faster & cheaper than workers
870812167364370432 2017-06-02 01:19:34 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph As long as America's appetite for cheap goods remains labor will stay overseas & favors automation! Companies will have to go ....
870808892762148864 2017-06-02 01:06:33 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I currently work in a production facility we just installed a 2.3 million dollar line with one sole purpose to reduce labor & lower wages
870807948376903680 2017-06-02 01:02:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Tell me again where most of the products amazon sells are made? Warehouses are not factories
870806641981181952 2017-06-02 00:57:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph With a 1/4 of the staff & lower wages
870806547412242432 2017-06-02 00:57:14 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I've worked in manufacturing for 25+ years those factory jobs are never coming back if they do it will be to automated facilities.....
870804640526458880 2017-06-02 00:49:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph Because of cheap US labor! Payroll is still the number 1 expense in most companies
870804404290584577 2017-06-02 00:48:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph And that's why Rexnord Bearing closed its plant in Indiana & moved to Mexico & why Carrier will silently follow ....
870802400961015809 2017-06-02 00:40:45 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Sorry to say those jobs didn't leave cause of the tax burden left cause of cheap laborhttps://twitter.com/wolfgang_joseph/status/870800993709064192

870720407451709444 2017-06-02 19:14:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @wolfgang_joseph I want all four major polluters to work on lowering their emissions! They're the major polluters they should shoulder more of the burden

856147934920003584 2017-04-23 14:09:08 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Hoteps are angry white men trapped in black men's body's, don't @ me
856147149687541761 2017-04-23 14:06:01 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @TheMuddyCuck Key words in that chart "household income" Asians have extended family member wage earners living in same house as opposed to whites!
856145232525754369 2017-04-23 13:58:24 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem Here's what an Asian wrote about the "model minority" in 2004! http://www.racism.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1191:income02-1&catid=50&Itemid=173
856144253742972928 2017-04-23 13:54:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem @TheMuddyCuck Imagine that Asian household on assistance almost on par with whites! But they work harder right 
856143637750702082 2017-04-23 13:52:04 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem Asian household also earn more because they have more wage earners in household! Extended family as opposed to whites who have just 1 or 2
856143048111214592 2017-04-23 13:49:43 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem More PR,Shine! As I stated in past tweets Asian wealth gap higher than whites to go along with their higher poverty rate
856140714442469377 2017-04-23 13:40:27 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem "Model Minority" is a myth,Uncle! Read a book

856140137633329152 2017-04-23 13:38:09 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem Hey Shine,If Asians doing better than Whites why is Asian poverty rate higher? 
856129187253551104 2017-04-23 12:54:39 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Asians do better than blacks because they have better PR, don't @ me!

856104493775192064 2017-04-23 11:16:31 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem In America the Term "Nuclear Family" only been in the lexicon since abt 1947! Until then the norm was the extended family for most part
856101043129778176 2017-04-23 11:02:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem BTW,I notice it says Father in your bio but not Husband! What up with that?

810877563044237312 2016-12-19 16:00:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @VibeHi By redlining your communities & denying your loans!
810877347683450880 2016-12-19 15:59:59 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Your boy Trump didn't build his alleged wealth with his spending power,he did/does it w/ other peoples capital https://twitter.com/vibehi/status/810876178190008320
810874542386282500 2016-12-19 15:48:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @VibeHi I agree 100% with X but if if was that easy it would be done! Spending power doesn't equal wealth
810873483366465537 2016-12-19 15:44:38 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @VibeHi But you really don't think the white man knew this & has done everything in his power to stop you from allowing this to happen?
810557572239552512 2016-12-18 18:49:19 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @AriesSpears remember that one hunter that got stomped by an elephant a few years back! KARMA IS A BITCH!
810283378020847617 2016-12-17 00:39:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> All good,You'll never get what I'm saying anyway! https://twitter.com/lucianajmiles/status/810281937906659328
810279743945744384 2016-12-17 00:25:19 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Not everybody is going to be a plumber or construction worker. Even the healthcare field is being automated!
810279199814676481 2016-12-17 00:23:10 UTC <JohnQPublic30> You said those jobs are coming back! They haven't yet not to pre recession numbers & more than likely won't!
810276644501987328 2016-12-17 00:13:00 UTC <JohnQPublic30> You said maybe feminism has changed! It's been around a long time so has the backlash
810276266691674112 2016-12-17 00:11:30 UTC <JohnQPublic30> I'm sure many don't! On list of grievances feminism should be far down on the list
810275499889033218 2016-12-17 00:08:28 UTC <JohnQPublic30> And how will those ppl who have lost their jobs to Technology & Automation pay for these services?
810274842666799105 2016-12-17 00:05:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> My brother's a union bricklayer still having trouble making ends meet! Lots of empty building & houses out there. Supply & Demand
810273604864774144 2016-12-17 00:00:56 UTC <JohnQPublic30> My point is anti feminism is not a new thing,it went mainstream years ago!
810273089565167616 2016-12-17 23:58:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Yes,because they make no sense!
810269969825038336 2016-12-17 23:46:29 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Part of a definition of real man is not being concerned with feminism to the point Hotep's are! Dominates their Conversations
810269242004213760 2016-12-17 23:43:36 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Those jobs you listed have been decimated by 2008-2009 recession still not fully back to pre recession numbers
810268865905258500 2016-12-17 23:42:06 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Never said they didn't but it was more uncommon back than esp for White Families
810268191968608256 2016-12-17 23:39:25 UTC <JohnQPublic30> This anti feminism stuff has been going on since early '90's (see Rush Limbaugh) I've been casually studying it for years
810267832516755458 2016-12-17 23:37:59 UTC <JohnQPublic30> I don't even know what a Hotep was till a month ago! My friends & co workers had no clue, I had to look in up online.
810250353778237440 2016-12-17 22:28:32 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Not at the same levels as today!
810250227903033344 2016-12-17 22:28:02 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Based on my experiences in my youth! Yes,very much truth
810250003059003394 2016-12-17 22:27:09 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Really? Manufacturing & Production job all but disappearing ! Back in the day you could support a family on that wage!
810242663039508481 2016-12-17 21:57:59 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Old School Men worked, woman took care of kids! That role is changing rapidly! BTW I'm talking abt men from 60's & 70's
810242125438844929 2016-12-17 21:55:50 UTC <JohnQPublic30> Society is changing, Men are no longer needed to do the jobs than were done by men back in the day! Men need to adapt to a changing world
810237577827647489 2016-12-17 21:37:46 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem Old School Men didn't worry about feminism because they ran the show! These Hotep's scream abt feminism like little girls
810225420473868289 2016-12-17 20:49:28 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @handymayhem Real Men aren't scared of woman or Feminism! But then again Uncle here isn't really 100% anti feminism!
810206507090538496 2016-12-17 19:34:18 UTC <JohnQPublic30> This Hotep shit cracks me up! https://twitter.com/handymayhem/status/810198080742105088

809427050733903872 2016-12-15 15:57:01 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @VibeHi @true198 Everything I've read till this AA female suicide rate is very low compared to other groups (almost non existent) very troubling indeed
809425987884773376 2016-12-15 15:52:48 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @VibeHi @true198 I want to dig deeper into these numbers because the suicide rates seem high for AA woman contrary to other stuff I've read
809425580953337856 2016-12-15 15:51:11 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @VibeHi @true198 Correct, I went back to 98' the numbers appear consistent through the years. To blame it all on black men is a serious leap
809423304318664706 2016-12-15 15:42:08 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @VibeHi @true198 Agree to a point, They definitely cherry picked the numbers! But yes to blame men was/is a stretch. Appears they just went w/ the numbers
809417704679604225 2016-12-15 15:19:53 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @VibeHi homicide listed 3 times as 2nd leading cause!  1-4 yr olds 15-19 yr olds 20-24 yr olds Their claim is a half truth
809275761190387712 2016-12-14 05:55:51 UTC <JohnQPublic30> @YouTube @handymayhem Calls black tv shows stereotype's after stereotyping Asians & Mexicans!  Can make this shit up!
