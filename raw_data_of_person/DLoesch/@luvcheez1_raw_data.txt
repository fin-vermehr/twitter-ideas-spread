967174993741254656 2018-02-23 23:11:02 UTC <luvcheez1> @TakeThatScapeGt @JustaTheory2 @PurifierDragoon You mean evil atheistic resources? No thanks. I know without a doubt that I am a much happier person than you are
967171527635595264 2018-02-23 22:57:16 UTC <luvcheez1> @TakeThatScapeGt @PurifierDragoon Like I said you have to read it to want to understand. Those like you and @JustaTheory2 who happily trash Christian beliefs will never know the true message unless God puts it in your heart.
967169511353929730 2018-02-23 22:49:15 UTC <luvcheez1> @TakeThatScapeGt @PurifierDragoon @JustaTheory2 Consider this: Would you rather live a sinful life only to die and realize there is no God or live a loving life and realize There really is a God? Can't change your mind when it's your time
967168493534810112 2018-02-23 22:45:12 UTC <luvcheez1> @TakeThatScapeGt @JustaTheory2 @PurifierDragoon Then I'll put it this way so you'll possibly understand: if you defy God, shut happens
967167261642559489 2018-02-23 22:40:18 UTC <luvcheez1> @TakeThatScapeGt @PurifierDragoon @JustaTheory2 You obviously haven't read the Bible like I said. Just looking 4 judgment. All of mankind are sinners, sure there r stories of sin/evil. God gave us intelligence & domain of the world. We r responsible 4 our actions. Bible gives us direction.
967164264430690310 2018-02-23 22:28:24 UTC <luvcheez1> @TakeThatScapeGt @PurifierDragoon @JustaTheory2 I study it all the time and will continue to do so. I'm even going to pray for you. Bet that makes you mad...

967162598159470592 2018-02-23 22:21:47 UTC <luvcheez1> @TakeThatScapeGt @PurifierDragoon @JustaTheory2 If you really read to understand it, not looking for judgment against it you will see what I'm talking about. It's all about where your heart is.
967162270533935104 2018-02-23 22:20:28 UTC <luvcheez1> @TakeThatScapeGt @PurifierDragoon @JustaTheory2 You have to study the Bible. Its not all  easy to understand. I'm in a bible study class, have learned so much I wouldn't have just reading on my own.
967160464873488385 2018-02-23 22:13:18 UTC <luvcheez1> @JustaTheory2 @TakeThatScapeGt @PurifierDragoon I can tell you this there was a time in my life I didn't practice my faith. I was in turmoil & felt I hit rock bottom. I started to read the Bible & praying & then listening. Thru this my life changed. I have focus, direction, happiness, peace, etc
967152882209427457 2018-02-23 21:43:10 UTC <luvcheez1> @JustaTheory2 @TakeThatScapeGt @PurifierDragoon That's the sad part, if they don't believe then they won't go to heaven. You come into this world alone, you leave alone based on your own standing with God. Can't take anything or anyone with you
967149486618435584 2018-02-23 21:29:41 UTC <luvcheez1> @JustaTheory2 @TakeThatScapeGt @PurifierDragoon Because I believe our time on Earth is actually short. Our life after is forever. I want to exist in a place of peace w/ those i love who also believe in Jesus. That is what I believe & will always believe.
967135378338697216 2018-02-23 20:33:37 UTC <luvcheez1> @TakeThatScapeGt @JustaTheory2 Not a threat, but a point expressed upon my beliefs. No one can prove the claim unless they actually experience it. I choose to believe in God & Jesus & eternal life not in pain & suffering which would be consequences
966852918279376896 2018-02-22 01:51:13 UTC <luvcheez1> @TakeThatScapeGt @JustaTheory2 My threat? I can't send you there, you send yourself. Your insults are quite the reflection of your heart. That's pretty sad.
966835402693898240 2018-02-22 00:41:37 UTC <luvcheez1> @JustaTheory2 @TakeThatScapeGt You are totally off. I didn't use the word hate but love how you throw it around to make me look bad. This is a dead end. Good night.

897244918187511812 2017-08-14 23:53:53 UTC <luvcheez1> @mitchellvii @realdoctorV @SandyVancuren @KOPatriot45 @AbigailStrom Antifa message is you get your head bashed if you don't agree with them....Hit first, so you can't express your right to speak later
897232526594408450 2017-08-14 23:04:38 UTC <luvcheez1> @mitchellvii @realdoctorV @AbigailStrom How about condemn ANYONE who is looking to fight with hate/violence - You are one sided=not good
897231919267667968 2017-08-14 23:02:13 UTC <luvcheez1> @mitchellvii @realdoctorV @SandyVancuren @KOPatriot45 @AbigailStrom As vile as white national message Is, Antifa is vile as well, very violent, doesn't promote peace at all
897230501924265984 2017-08-14 22:56:36 UTC <luvcheez1> Bye bye @FoxNews- Eboni Williams is the last straw! This network is more hypocritical than ever! Williams's calling base racist goes too far

897216233275346945 2017-08-14 21:59:54 UTC <luvcheez1> @mitchellvii Antifa/BLM came armed and ready to battle, didn't look like a peaceful intent to  protest...both sides r guilty. But they shud b called out!
896823844807348224 2017-08-13 20:00:41 UTC <luvcheez1> @kwilli1046 @USAUnited2017 Is it any wonder why this summer had so many movie flops? Hollywood is not worth supporting!
896788408105697280 2017-08-13 17:39:52 UTC <luvcheez1> @BarackObama @Ms_Erika74 Obama's the biggest lying hypocrite that ever walked the face of this earth!
896537276049707009 2017-08-12 01:01:58 UTC <luvcheez1> True! Trump has denounced Duke many times!https://twitter.com/lsmith4680/status/896459824107540480

895436135668776960 2017-08-09 00:06:25 UTC <luvcheez1> @magazine_20 The opioid issue is pretty dire. Melania can do whatever she wants- both are great causes.
895432956466012160 2017-08-09 23:53:47 UTC <luvcheez1> @marklevinshow Completely agree!
895348210008510465 2017-08-09 18:17:02 UTC <luvcheez1> I'm through with this - if you decide to respond I won't  read it. Have a nice day
895347862346899456 2017-08-09 18:15:39 UTC <luvcheez1> And yes that's God's will not god's
895347775591911425 2017-08-09 18:15:19 UTC <luvcheez1> We've a successful business owner who  recognizes  plight of ppl who feel forgotten & suffered & has guts 2 stand up agnst corruption.
895313875590979584 2017-08-09 16:00:36 UTC <luvcheez1> Politicians are corrupt!!! Look at laundry list of HRC//DNC. Obama sold out US to Iran. you gonna defend him too?
895313437680476160 2017-08-09 15:58:52 UTC <luvcheez1> Scandals and ties? That aren't illegal or they would been brought to light 9 months ago....fake news once again
895313029859913729 2017-08-09 15:57:15 UTC <luvcheez1> This country needs a leader not a cool politcian  who says 1 thing thenduz another. Those who cry over hurt feelings/ offenses need 2 gro up
895311917971013632 2017-08-09 15:52:49 UTC <luvcheez1> The disabled reporter story was debunked a long time ago, get with it Frank!
895299795153244160 2017-08-09 15:04:39 UTC <luvcheez1> Our nation was in such dire straits with Obama that even that private conversation  was not enough to deter my vote
895299047833161728 2017-08-09 15:01:41 UTC <luvcheez1> That conversation was private & 11 yrs ago in Hollywood industry which is crawling w/ men who speak&think that way. ..but crucify this 1 man
895298124260003841 2017-08-09 14:58:01 UTC <luvcheez1> He's  not  perfect- none of us are. Many ppl evolve over years. His message is to improve America for all legal citizens.
895297257427406849 2017-08-09 14:54:34 UTC <luvcheez1> I'm truly glad you as I am too. It's time to end this - we have an imbedded difference of opinion  . Have a nice day
895285604853981185 2017-08-09 14:08:16 UTC <luvcheez1> I feel sorry for you and your kind. Thank God he put Trump in the WH!!! #MAGA
895284866752839680 2017-08-09 14:05:20 UTC <luvcheez1> No proof of collusion!! Amazing how Dems have all kinds of meetings w/ Russians but "ok, not the same"=HYPOCRITES
895284503182274560 2017-08-09 14:03:53 UTC <luvcheez1> No he did not!!!! Where are you getting your information? Coney wasn't doing his jiob! Complete bias for Hillary.  Anyone else wud b in jail
895282227365502977 2017-08-09 13:54:51 UTC <luvcheez1> Yeah a whole bunch of illegals and dead people LOVE HRC!!!
895269487670329347 2017-08-09 13:04:13 UTC <luvcheez1> Ha! Yeah those polls are SO accurate! Didn't Hillary lead in every one? How'd that work out?
895268944264802304 2017-08-09 13:02:04 UTC <luvcheez1> That's right- something with proof that got covered up because CIA/FBI wanted to help Clinton become President.
895267920758132742 2017-08-09 12:58:00 UTC <luvcheez1> Where is the proof? Even Dems still admit there's no evidence...amazing there's a special counsel based on NO PROOF
895267501243760640 2017-08-09 12:56:20 UTC <luvcheez1> Obama reigned over the longest period of stagnation - the ONLY President not to grow economy more than 2%- FACT
895121347147419648 2017-08-08 03:15:34 UTC <luvcheez1> OMG!'Here we go! Russia, Russia, Russia!!!! Good night!
895117405130829824 2017-08-08 02:59:54 UTC <luvcheez1> Corruption is uncovered daily it seems on the Left, yet they r not brought to justice. Republicans are to blame too
895116420895342593 2017-08-08 02:55:59 UTC <luvcheez1> This is petty. Obama put this cntry in a mess politically, economically, racially & more. Trump has uncovered corruption- more important
895112790821806082 2017-08-08 02:41:34 UTC <luvcheez1> I recall a video from Project Veritas where a group hired by DNC along with Bob Creamer admitted to bussing people in to different states
895097451681648640 2017-08-08 01:40:37 UTC <luvcheez1> Voter fraud is legit, Einstein!!!
895097348505948160 2017-08-08 01:40:12 UTC <luvcheez1> Haha! You are truly pathetic! Crowd size is a legitimate lie with all other issues...um I think the idiot label suits you perfectly!!!!!!!
895081873352904704 2017-08-08 00:38:43 UTC <luvcheez1> Somehow I don't think you are mature enough to discuss anything. Funny how the left luvs to say Trump lies but never says about what-tell me
895079618767720449 2017-08-08 00:29:45 UTC <luvcheez1> What if Obama had been the US President he should've been...if he had " balls" & put America first we'd be in a different situation
895000505428127744 2017-08-08 19:15:23 UTC <luvcheez1> @RyanJensen2018 Hope he does then everyone get in line!!!! #MAGA
894999533419147268 2017-08-08 19:11:31 UTC <luvcheez1> @Rockprincess818 Its more like how many nukes does Iran have?
894969586206072832 2017-08-08 17:12:31 UTC <luvcheez1> Exactly! Their mentality is so closed minded, un- American - even attacking the completely innocent is just plain evil!
894968573160038401 2017-08-08 17:08:30 UTC <luvcheez1> Wow is right! By the way how's your 401k doing?
894900160337240064 2017-08-08 12:36:39 UTC <luvcheez1> @BigDuhie1955 @Beccajxo2 To pick on a child is so pathetic. This "punk" will probably grow up to serve in military to protect your ungrateful a$$
894894862595743744 2017-08-08 12:15:36 UTC <luvcheez1> @ezraklein Call him what you want But his lies look like promises kept

894865842369900544 2017-08-08 10:20:17 UTC <luvcheez1> @mitchellvii I don't believe those polls, besides nobody's asked me...

894621010808492034 2017-08-07 18:07:24 UTC <luvcheez1> @Deplorable80210 Its called respect. Something Obama hasnt a clue about. The world responds to a leader who means what he says!

893903848678600704 2017-08-05 18:37:40 UTC <luvcheez1> @MaxineWaters @FoxNews Waters is all about herself and keeping what loot she has gained from her position.
893902104464674816 2017-08-05 18:30:44 UTC <luvcheez1> @BlissTabitha I don't believe it- another desperate smear campaign brought on by 'anonymous sources'
893893766595174401 2017-08-05 17:57:36 UTC <luvcheez1> @Corrynmb You know something's fishy if CNN is defending McMaster.

892348180607758337 2017-08-01 11:35:59 UTC <luvcheez1> @RealJamesWoods What an arrogant, delusional a$$hole, still putting all of Trump supporters in one basket looking down on us = Trump Train 2020 #MAGA
892346478492094464 2017-08-01 11:29:14 UTC <luvcheez1> @REALStaceyDash @Realetti I can tell you're going to defend illegal criminals no matter what so good luck with that- I think I'm talking to a brick wall.
892345782283665408 2017-08-01 11:26:28 UTC <luvcheez1> @REALStaceyDash @Realetti I understand that statement- Don't think you do. Look up definition. Also read about this guy. I can't believe you're still defending him.
892182332890906624 2017-07-31 00:36:58 UTC <luvcheez1> @REALStaceyDash @Realetti As Christians many ppl mistake the word meek for weak but actually means silently strong.
892182014291582977 2017-07-31 00:35:42 UTC <luvcheez1> @REALStaceyDash @Realetti And if he were to harm someone I love I would Hunt him down. Period.
892180857091497984 2017-07-31 00:31:06 UTC <luvcheez1> @REALStaceyDash @Realetti Then stole her car and found another woman 2 assault w/ a knife, oh also, charged with sodomy. Don't know about you but he is evil
892180052770787331 2017-07-31 00:27:55 UTC <luvcheez1> @REALStaceyDash @Realetti You might want to know the facts before commenting. He broke into a 65 yr old woman's house. Bound & Raped her, beat her head into  floor
891997458447945728 2017-07-31 12:22:21 UTC <luvcheez1> @REALStaceyDash @Realetti Being Christian is also about fighting for goodness & His will which is not hatred /violence. Satan can see weakness & will intervene.
891996003141910528 2017-07-31 12:16:34 UTC <luvcheez1> @REALStaceyDash @Realetti When a criminal is given chance after chance & doesn't change then enough is enough-He broke into her home then raped & beat her-defend that
891995166676054016 2017-07-31 12:13:14 UTC <luvcheez1> @REALStaceyDash @Realetti Who is committing the violence? Who is showing hate by hurting ppl? Sounds like you r defending this guy. He deserves NO compassion
891822845059379205 2017-07-30 00:48:30 UTC <luvcheez1> @BreitbartNews Megyn who??????
891820005863682048 2017-07-30 00:37:13 UTC <luvcheez1> @REALStaceyDash @Jason_Hightower But protecting your fellow neighbors from someone who has been proven evil and deported 20 times is just plain stupid!
891818012843659265 2017-07-30 00:29:18 UTC <luvcheez1> @REALStaceyDash Disgusting that city officials allowed this man to do this! There should be some sort of legal action against these nutjobs!

831873541821841408 2017-02-15 14:31:22 UTC <luvcheez1> @realDonaldTrump Praying for continued guidance & safety for our administration & families. Satan is hunting but can only do what God allows

831634551545950208 2017-02-14 22:41:42 UTC <luvcheez1> @FoxNews Give me a break! Chavitz needs to make himself relevant & focus on more important issues
831591449963667457 2017-02-14 19:50:26 UTC <luvcheez1> @cajunkallie Give me a break - deflect, deflect, deflect. She needs to worry about her family's proven corruption
831587656127610880 2017-02-14 19:35:22 UTC <luvcheez1> @Franklin_Graham @RomeuEvelyn @BorisTheWalrus Actually thus quote& support 4  criminalHRC would be VERY hard to reconcile. She is evil

831516884424077313 2017-02-14 14:54:08 UTC <luvcheez1> @mitchellvii Too many leaks happening- too many "bugs". No wonder Trump & Japan PM went to Mara Lago
831278257861435397 2017-02-13 23:05:55 UTC <luvcheez1> Disgusting... that reporter should be barred from WH eventshttps://twitter.com/KurtSchlichter/status/831269384945430528
830980971000426496 2017-02-12 03:24:37 UTC <luvcheez1> @FoxNews Chris Wallace sure is hitting Stephen Miller on unimportant issues like Trump's ?able remarks about others. Really Chris?

830858942225985538 2017-02-12 19:19:43 UTC <luvcheez1> @nia4_trump @kellieevens They'd be wise 2 choose carefully what to protest against. I don't hear them protesting Radical Islamists

830508118459162627 2017-02-11 20:05:40 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur Better yet I have better things to do than continue this delusional conversation
830507671048617985 2017-02-11 20:03:53 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur Funny evrerytime I asked what lies it's always deferred 2 something else. Try & think of something, SOMETHING
830506703133229061 2017-02-11 20:00:02 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur He will fix all corruption that Obama created & MSM has covered up. Can't wait 2 watch it unfold.
830506307983654917 2017-02-11 19:58:28 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur what is Trump's corruption- that he didn't release his taxes?
830505337065193472 2017-02-11 19:54:37 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur if HRC won we'd be under sharia law in 4 years. Christians have been persecuted even under Obama
830505011343933440 2017-02-11 19:53:19 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur Obama just wanted to weaken USA n all areas-militarily, economically,  racially &politically.
830504431980572675 2017-02-11 19:51:01 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur I don't believe any president goes into office wanting 2 financially benefit. Trump is a wealthy outsider & pp just hat it

830497960035237889 2017-02-11 19:25:18 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur I see it doesn't matter how anything is explained Liberals have a closed mind. Good day
830497649832902656 2017-02-11 19:24:04 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur Obama & HRC fit that bill. Corruption was rampant and well covered up. I'll take Trump over those 2 traitors anyday
830496781213523968 2017-02-11 19:20:37 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur My expectations r just fine where they are. Trump has done more 4 this country than Obama ever dreamed if doing.
830496502908862465 2017-02-11 19:19:30 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur Last I looked she didn't run 4 office. Republicans had alot more respectful of Obama's family .
830478545952575488 2017-02-11 18:08:09 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur Sad 2 think everybody's fair game, altho she's been in public eye all of her life, she can handle anything...w/ dignity
830477189581795328 2017-02-11 18:02:46 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur up to the corruption of the government.

830476736466923522 2017-02-11 18:00:58 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur Not always.Trump ran because of love of USA & its going downhill. Bc he's been on both sides of aisles, knows where change

830450776757657600 2017-02-11 16:17:48 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur Only people being conned are those that r blinded by evil hatred of the Left
830450540358283264 2017-02-11 16:16:52 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur Trump family was already successful in their own right
830450343989293056 2017-02-11 16:16:05 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur Hillary profitted from her position as Secretary of State/Clinton Foundation... big difference.
830444608534487040 2017-02-11 15:53:18 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur Perception is what appears to be reality.  She is very much wanted in America & thanks 4 reminding me to go buy her shoes
830437386060460032 2017-02-11 15:24:36 UTC <luvcheez1> @TheCut @sinkspur Only by perception...Ivanka hasn't done anything to anybody
830416576562216965 2017-02-11 14:01:54 UTC <luvcheez1> @sweetatertot2 That's right.! Have these people just started watching  the news & think they know it all?

781518415882100738 2016-09-29 15:38:04 UTC <luvcheez1> She shouldn't have entered the contest if she was planning on eating 12 pizzas afterwards. She should apologize.
781518037480460288 2016-09-29 15:36:34 UTC <luvcheez1> Oh come on!! She has an obligation to fulfill her duties as Miss Universe. She entered the contest & won looking a certain way

781082366701871105 2016-09-28 10:45:22 UTC <luvcheez1> @slone Does this surprise anyone? Anyone?
780948654458830848 2016-09-27 01:54:03 UTC <luvcheez1> @DiamondandSilk Miss Universe is a business. She only hurt herself
780948464922464256 2016-09-27 01:53:18 UTC <luvcheez1> @DiamondandSilk She was Miss Universe! She knew better! I don't pity her!

778755434341478400 2016-09-21 00:38:58 UTC <luvcheez1> @slone @marymac41 What makes Ms. Alexander think all 8 million are going to vote 4 Hillary? This is definitely desperation

777498218347266048 2016-09-18 13:23:15 UTC <luvcheez1> Christians can argue valid points too, don't stereotype-poor judgement. I'm willing to speak out on behalf 4 a better way of life
777497336582901761 2016-09-18 13:19:44 UTC <luvcheez1> Sickos r those who can't see thru the facade of HRC running her campaign on attacks & racism. Listen with BOTH ears!
777495154919936000 2016-09-18 13:11:04 UTC <luvcheez1> it's not racism to want better 4 the country. It's not good leadership 2 demean your voters, honey

774288629426446340 2016-09-09 16:49:29 UTC <luvcheez1> #NationalAnthemprotest  Find another way to protest! Our youth should be taught to honor our flag! I'll NEVER support teams that uphold this
774286156926185472 2016-09-09 16:39:40 UTC <luvcheez1> I am proud to be a "Deplorable" as Hillary describes some of Trump's supporters. He has a vision for EVERYONE. She uses racism for votes.

772517241921347584 2016-09-04 19:30:37 UTC <luvcheez1> @fuzzycuckoo1 I have a college degree & SAT is very important for someone your age & IQ, but what u DO with it is most important
772515573205008384 2016-09-04 19:23:59 UTC <luvcheez1> @fuzzycuckoo1 Once again, ur ability to read & understand is questionable as my bio says WORKING mom

772407633944907776 2016-09-04 12:15:05 UTC <luvcheez1> @YouTube @FoxNews @conservatismtlk She's a career politician with no record to show, riding on the heels of Bill and Obama.
772407440025477120 2016-09-04 12:14:18 UTC <luvcheez1> @YouTube @FoxNews @conservatismtlk I love how Dems always focus on the past & attack in stead of vision for future. HRC offers no hope

772401696714715136 2016-09-04 11:51:29 UTC <luvcheez1> @FoxNews @conservatismtlk @Bryan_Blanc Let's make a list of what Hillary is facing!! A LONG list and where is she???
772401284116779008 2016-09-04 11:49:51 UTC <luvcheez1> @FoxNews @conservatismtlk Don't care what happened 40 years ago. I c what he has accomplished, his passion for US, and his message today.
772400756934729728 2016-09-04 11:47:45 UTC <luvcheez1> @FoxNews @conservatismtlk A scam for who? He's left his businesses, paid millions for primary campaign, very transparent-hasn't lied.
772248028732387328 2016-09-03 01:40:52 UTC <luvcheez1> @FoxNews @conservatismtlk @Bryan_Blanc Good luck with your criminal candidate

772233190694060032 2016-09-03 00:41:54 UTC <luvcheez1> @FoxNews @conservatismtlk @Bryan_Blanc Trumps not racist Just like the Bible u have to read b4 & after a verse to know what it truly means
772117436493598720 2016-09-03 17:01:56 UTC <luvcheez1> @FoxNews @conservatismtlk No that's what bigots believe. Smart people think outside the box, esp when the past 8 years have been disastrous
772115903047692289 2016-09-03 16:55:51 UTC <luvcheez1> @FoxNews @conservatismtlk Those guys are not dumb, & would not allow themselves to be used.
772108554375430144 2016-09-03 16:26:39 UTC <luvcheez1> @fuzzycuckoo1 LOL! You are younger and stupider than I thought. Really? SAT scores don't mean crap in the real world honey
772042785516126208 2016-09-03 12:05:18 UTC <luvcheez1> @fuzzycuckoo1 Obama is a sellout for everything America stands for
772039709929402368 2016-09-03 11:53:05 UTC <luvcheez1> @fuzzycuckoo1 It's over alright, bc Trump will be POTUS, Hillary will be jailed and Obama will go down as one of the worst presidents EVER!
771320490090717184 2016-09-01 12:15:09 UTC <luvcheez1> @fuzzycuckoo1 One last thing if you watch the news, main concerns for Americans is jobs, security and immigration-all suffering badly!
771319270680752128 2016-09-01 12:10:19 UTC <luvcheez1> @fuzzycuckoo1 that response made absolutely no sense....btw
771318283232505856 2016-09-01 12:06:23 UTC <luvcheez1> @fuzzycuckoo1 We can agree to disagree. You have a totally different view than I and that's fine. I don't care to go respond anymore
771317469856276481 2016-09-01 12:03:09 UTC <luvcheez1> @fuzzycuckoo1 yes you do need to go on because you come across as young and stupid.

770902199866195968 2016-08-31 08:33:01 UTC <luvcheez1> @fuzzycuckoo1 You can't even answer my last ? Just like Hillary, can't justify only attack.
770234188658278401 2016-08-29 12:18:35 UTC <luvcheez1> @FoxFriendsFirst @FoxNews Their response seems to support him. His punishment will come from the fans!
770052022448029696 2016-08-28 00:14:43 UTC <luvcheez1> @fuzzycuckoo1 His immigration policy is just fine with me. How's Hillary's record? A career politician with nothing to show!
770050562163404800 2016-08-28 00:08:55 UTC <luvcheez1> @fuzzycuckoo1 Your mouth is filthier than anything I've heard out of his.  LISTEN to what he said, MSM spins everything he says into a lie.
769319524139139072 2016-08-26 23:44:02 UTC <luvcheez1> a man like Trump who did not have to jump to this election  AND pay for HIS primary election speaks volumes.
769318605473386497 2016-08-26 23:40:23 UTC <luvcheez1> Your #shitforbrains only refers to you and people like you

764969522205949952 2016-08-14 23:38:41 UTC <luvcheez1> @fuzzycuckoo1 A con man wouldn't fund his primary campaign with his own money so he can't be accused of being bought. HRC can't say that.
764968943970816000 2016-08-14 23:36:23 UTC <luvcheez1> @fuzzycuckoo1 I doubt you even know what the real issues are. Put a shirt on and go buy a newspaper, that is if you know how to read

763828434753687553 2016-08-11 20:04:24 UTC <luvcheez1> @sheroyalT That  RO lost his job because of a kid who doesn't know how to act. U tell me what's the lesser of 2 evils

763827357643862016 2016-08-11 20:00:07 UTC <luvcheez1> @sheroyalT this student's behavior was disrespectful to the teachers, classmates, and the RO. Her peers would agree since she didn't return
763799448635969536 2016-08-11 18:09:13 UTC <luvcheez1> @BuzzAtTheState @thestate How many adults came to deal with this student before the RO had to come & take her out=losing his job.
763798804424458240 2016-08-11 18:06:40 UTC <luvcheez1> @BuzzAtTheState @thestate This student should not have had her phone out. But as usual the RULES don't apply to certain people

761319909968183297 2016-08-04 21:56:25 UTC <luvcheez1> @NBCNewsPR @wis10 @mike_pence @SavannahGuthrie @TODAYshow hope she's not as rude to them as she was to Trump
761226163851235328 2016-08-04 15:43:55 UTC <luvcheez1> @HillaryClinton @newtgingrich @FoxBusiness She's proven guilty for lies, incompetence, yet Trump hurts someone's feelings and he's "evil"

761222300633030658 2016-08-04 15:28:33 UTC <luvcheez1> @SportsCenter Pathetic! I support N.C.-thanks for having the strength to not cave in to those who don't have common sense
761220841212436480 2016-08-04 15:22:46 UTC <luvcheez1> Obama has started a dangerous path for all Americans abroad, dad's release should've been negotiated w/out moneyhttps://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/761205779525271552

761170140947963904 2016-08-04 12:01:18 UTC <luvcheez1> @oreillyfactor @ThaGroundskeepr @fuzzycuckoo1 I won't at your request, you're not worth the trouble
760900850768285696 2016-08-03 18:11:14 UTC <luvcheez1> @JohnKasich Unlike you who deserted your party at the RNC. Shame on u, u broke your vow to support the nominee-typical politician
760518162773340160 2016-08-02 16:50:34 UTC <luvcheez1> @oreillyfactor @ThaGroundskeepr the more negative news I see and hear about Trump the more I support him, it's all a distraction
760517090637910016 2016-08-02 16:46:18 UTC <luvcheez1> @oreillyfactor @Robdang3r Good point
760516893878980609 2016-08-02 16:45:31 UTC <luvcheez1> @oreillyfactor How unprofessional, how did she get that job?
760504554400182273 2016-08-02 15:56:29 UTC <luvcheez1> @FoxNews Obama has always been unfit to serve - 71/2 yrs of NOTHING to benefit this country as a whole, pathetical leader, only divisive!
760503710518743041 2016-08-02 15:53:08 UTC <luvcheez1> @FoxNews Can't wait until he's out of office!!
760503606525165569 2016-08-02 15:52:43 UTC <luvcheez1> @FoxNews That Hillary would lie to Bengazhi victims' families is just evil! Come on Obama, let's level the playing field!
760487752823611392 2016-08-02 14:49:44 UTC <luvcheez1> @Gothamist @slone To the protesters: You're on your own when ISIS hits, when a robber enters your home. Ya'll need a reality check
760486719045197824 2016-08-02 14:45:37 UTC <luvcheez1> @BuzzAtTheState @thestate Why does  Muslim family get 100x more coverage than the fact that Hillary lied to  faces of Bengazhi families
760486103971467264 2016-08-02 14:43:10 UTC <luvcheez1> @BuzzAtTheState @thestate So disgusted with Hanna. Voting against party because of Trump's recent statement. We all grieve for our soldiers.
760483665893785600 2016-08-02 14:33:29 UTC <luvcheez1> @BuzzAtTheState Amazing how Trump is bashed for a statement to a military family, yet Hillary lied to the faces of 4 families-nothing!
759961572810846208 2016-07-31 03:58:53 UTC <luvcheez1> You want to talk about fraud? Take a look at the Clinton Foundation being investigated...but never mind all that.
759961137156939777 2016-07-31 03:57:09 UTC <luvcheez1> He's a businessman, sweetie, you must be living on Obama's hand outs, hard word must not be your thing.
759778138436079616 2016-07-31 15:49:58 UTC <luvcheez1> He has a track record of creating jobs. What's Obama done and Hillary's record - nothing! Your education is pretty revealing.
759665295283937281 2016-07-31 08:21:34 UTC <luvcheez1> @ericbolling Bought your book last week then rememeber my father in law's birthday. We gave it to him - he was thrilled - back to the store!
759659035989803008 2016-07-31 07:56:42 UTC <luvcheez1> @ScottBaio @scottbaio  Thanks for standing up for Trump, you speak from the heart (RNC)! I can't stand Hollywood anymore, so out of touch with  America
759656086089588737 2016-07-31 07:44:59 UTC <luvcheez1> @ScottBaio @scottbaio I love the way you handled Tamron Hall, what a typical libera! You were amazing!
759652323543089152 2016-07-31 07:30:02 UTC <luvcheez1> @DailyNewsBin who cares about Demi Lovato!?!?
759648975276367872 2016-07-31 07:16:43 UTC <luvcheez1> @realDonaldTrump Keep being you, Donald! Love you and your family! Nothing can change my vote. You've revealed so much about our government!
759458621772005376 2016-07-30 18:40:20 UTC <luvcheez1> @megynkelly Just when I was starting to like you again I watched your segment with Huckabee. You don''t get it about Trump's ban - go to CNN
759457041534558209 2016-07-30 18:34:03 UTC <luvcheez1> And that's supposed to make us feel better?https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/759435212170285056
721453106047938560 2016-04-16 21:39:59 UTC <luvcheez1> Proud of McCrory for making a common sense decision- men and little girls do not belong in the same restroom-it's about safety and privacy!
720254521264443392 2016-04-13 14:17:14 UTC <luvcheez1> @realDonaldTrump I just joined Twitter to let you know I love what you stand for because I'm listening to what you are really saying!
