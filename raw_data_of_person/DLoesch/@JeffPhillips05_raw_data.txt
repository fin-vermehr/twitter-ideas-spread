968221249922060294 2018-02-26 20:28:29 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @BreitbartNews @AIIAmericanGirI Its sad that so many lives were lost by a mentally unstable young man and also sad that so many like this guy are playing politics with their blame.
967503377063202823 2018-02-24 20:55:55 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Proud husband moment - I found something in the house without having to ask my wife where it might be.
967347593276686336 2018-02-24 10:36:53 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Are GIPHYs and imogies now offered as a second language in school?
967345286661230592 2018-02-24 10:27:43 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @jerseygirl2you Theres an armed officer inside most every bank. Why is that more important than guarding our kids?
965908828897398784 2018-02-20 11:19:45 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @BigKuehl German teams did really well. 2 man bobsled is one my favorite events.
965332619222233091 2018-02-18 21:10:06 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Can you smell that? Im cooking a tri tip in the smoker today. Getting hungry just thinking about it.
964811294028255234 2018-02-17 10:38:32 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Mark my words. 20-30 years from now, everyone will have joint pain and arthritis in their thumbs because of all the phone scrolling happening right now. #crystalball
964601250875674629 2018-02-16 20:43:54 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Does anyone still subscribe to a newspaper?
964450678381928448 2018-02-16 10:45:35 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Somebody let me know what its like to sleep in on a day off.
964299653700374529 2018-02-15 00:45:27 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Very true!https://twitter.com/jeffdye/status/964290612030836737
964263942364200960 2018-02-15 22:23:33 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Theres something just very relaxing about smoking a good cigar and enjoying a cold beer
964092037229350915 2018-02-15 11:00:28 UTC <JeffPhillips05> I really dont understand the need to immediately turn these tragedies political.
964090285016993792 2018-02-15 10:53:30 UTC <JeffPhillips05> I could write almost anything on here since no one notices it anyway.
964082791527931905 2018-02-15 10:23:43 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @jen4trump1 The words congress and common sense appearing in the same sentence is a oxymoron.
963176754079772673 2018-02-12 22:23:27 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Some Mondays are just not worth a frigging meme!
962642388639518721 2018-02-11 11:00:05 UTC <JeffPhillips05> A dogs stomach keeps better time than a Swiss watch. Feed me now!
962339335201751041 2018-02-10 14:55:51 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Hello spring. Your yellow trail of pollen along the curb and on the cars is unwelcome but glad the temps are warm now.

961788747292475392 2018-02-08 02:28:01 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Im just about bored enough to answer a call from a phone solicitor
961681235260137472 2018-02-08 19:20:48 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @daf1224 Its an entire group of oxymorons!
961656374747901952 2018-02-08 17:42:01 UTC <JeffPhillips05> I say a lot of things, but that doesnt mean they are all true
961652711182733312 2018-02-08 17:27:27 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @TwitchyTeam @AIIAmericanGirI Hes an out of touch idiot.
961628105076039680 2018-02-08 15:49:41 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @Jillibean557 Lets say it was brought to a vote, like she is wanting, and then it didnt pass. Fair and square. Would she drop it then? Doubtful.
961426328959574016 2018-02-07 02:27:53 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Whose ready for the Winter Olympics to begin? Looking forward to ice hockey but all of the events are great. Whats your favorite?
961193522064961536 2018-02-07 11:02:48 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Help me out @FoxNews with this #FISA court. FBI can submit request to spy on Americans but there is no opposing counsel/arguments. Where is the outrage from #ACLU ? Could it be this doesnt fit their liberal agenda? The sound of silence.
961190910808743936 2018-02-07 10:52:25 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @DaveNYviii FISA Court is just that. There is no opposing counsel or argument. Strange how silent the #ACLU is over all of this.
961040865933316098 2018-02-06 00:56:12 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Love this facepic.twitter.com/Rl8s9FmdlJ

960828326439989249 2018-02-06 10:51:39 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @nbc please renew this show. We need another season. This is a great show that the whole family can watch together.https://twitter.com/nbcbetterlate/status/960710488127504384
960637858523549697 2018-02-05 22:14:47 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @SuzanneSomers Yes. Family, food and football. Commercials were bland with a couple of exceptions.
960564209435271174 2018-02-05 17:22:08 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @Mucinex @terrybradshaw Im at work but looking forward to a new episode of @nbcbetterlate tonight. Hoping for more fun travel seasons in the future
960521347163148289 2018-02-05 14:31:49 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Melancholy: Melancholy can have causes that aren't due to underlying disease. Examples include seeing a sad movie, loss of a loved one or object, or a good thing coming to an end - like when the football season is over
960356624031539203 2018-02-04 03:37:16 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @tide @terrybradshaw Honest opinion Terry. Was Chris openly rooting for the Patriots or not? Al even did some too.
960350142959357952 2018-02-04 03:11:31 UTC <JeffPhillips05> #SuperBowlLll #AlMichaels and #ChrisCollinsworth are the worst, most hopeless Patriots lovers I have ever heard. Stop rooting for just one team.
960345103251509248 2018-02-04 02:51:29 UTC <JeffPhillips05> #ChrisCollinsworth you are such a homer for the Patriots. Its sad how much you are rooting for them. Come on man.
959943415617204224 2018-02-03 00:15:19 UTC <JeffPhillips05> One life goal may be achieved tonight. To be the first drunks thrown out of a new bar.
959481104653783041 2018-02-02 17:38:16 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @Thomas1774Paine Just like a democratic shill to talk about how something looks rather than focus on the facts. Not a journalist just a talking head for one side.
959477641425358849 2018-02-02 17:24:30 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @Patriotic_Va Hey @EricHolder lies based on lies based on other lies DO NOT make an investigation legitimate.
959476915030634496 2018-02-02 17:21:37 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @dbongino If Mueller doesnt turn his investigation on to them, then it is worthless
959476075905642497 2018-02-02 17:18:17 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @KatiePavlich When will Steele be interviewed by Mueller and then indicted? There is where the real collusion is.
959228017607430145 2018-02-01 00:52:35 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @MustangGirl3 @shanedkavanaugh Whatever happened to all of the women accusers? Havent heard anything out of Gloria Allred about since the election. Hmmmm, wonder why?
959223858308972550 2018-02-01 00:36:03 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Adult version of defusing a bomb = entering all of your information for an online ticket order before the timer expires and you lose the hold on the seats you picked.
959189363631579137 2018-02-01 22:18:59 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @daf1224 Just another ridiculous idea designed to grab some media attention for herself
959188956419100673 2018-02-01 22:17:22 UTC <JeffPhillips05> It may not be perfect but a really good cure for a tough day at work is having a dog who gets up on the sofa, lays down next to you and just wants a little love.
958778102657806337 2018-01-31 19:04:47 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Walked out of my office to get a drink and found thispic.twitter.com/RLFMNXiHln
958665142044123136 2018-01-31 11:35:55 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @KimStrassel Its pathetic. American values and putting Americans first is somehow wrong. Why did they run or better, who are they representing?
958662946028220416 2018-01-31 11:27:12 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @newtgingrich They cant get past their hate for the man to see how things are getting better under his watch.
958662212998057984 2018-01-31 11:24:17 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @watspn1013 Un-American
958661860445884416 2018-01-31 11:22:53 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @KatiePavlich Pathetic
958661788282867713 2018-01-31 11:22:36 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Is this right? People get elected to represent and serve the American people. Then, last night at #SOTU, one side of those elected people wouldnt stand for one American success story after another. Pathetic, sad, and un-American.
958489479177818117 2018-01-30 23:57:54 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @mitchellvii Would it be funny if ICE was waiting by the door when they began to leave?
958489174193197056 2018-01-30 23:56:41 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Wife asked if I wanted to ride with her to the store. Halfway there she tells me were going to Trader Joes. This is now a kidnapping. Send Help.
958390978305458176 2018-01-30 17:26:29 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @realPolitiDiva Thats wonderful and thank you for sharing that news. God is good!
958301524387663873 2018-01-30 11:31:02 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Hello Siri, can you tweet for me?  Siri: No, I cant do that.               Why not?                                           Because youre old and have a life.
958276615091511297 2018-01-30 09:52:03 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @inittowinit007 @TrumpsDC @SKYRIDER4538 @ImJustAMel @KNP2BP @DonnaWR8 @GartrellLinda @SandraTXAS @AppSame @starcrosswolf I think the President should release it 5 minutes before the State of the Union address and read it to everyone at that time.
958149918983630848 2018-01-29 01:28:36 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Whats everyone watching on TV tonight? Or is that too boring for Twitter.
958123211639742465 2018-01-29 23:42:29 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @WilliamShatner @nbcbetterlate Yes, please do a season 3. Would you? #AskBill. If for no other reason, @JeffDye  needs a steady job to support his video game habit.

958024267920302080 2018-01-29 17:09:19 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Too much work to do and all I want to do is not work. Monday blahs
957934669047238657 2018-01-29 11:13:17 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @ScottPresler Losers read at the Grammys. Winners read at the State of the Union.
957703917571321856 2018-01-28 19:56:21 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Prediction is 54-42, AFC. Rainy day in Orlando.

957586033348145152 2018-01-28 12:07:56 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Laughter may really be the best medicine. If you need a fun night with lots of laughs, go see @JeffDye show when you can. Saw his show last night and it was excellent. Dont forget @nbcbetterlate Monday nights on NBC.
957223189167427585 2018-01-27 12:06:07 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @RealJamesWoods She is completely disconnected from the real world and passed the nutty phase about 3 facelifts ago.
957222484008464384 2018-01-27 12:03:19 UTC <JeffPhillips05> People at a store in France rioting over Nutella!?!? Its a weird, wide, world we have here folks. @wjxt4 Put something else on your sandwich.

956938681272676352 2018-01-26 17:15:35 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @BlueSea1964 Pitiful and pathetic. Just doesnt make any sense and I dont understand how anyone can see this as such.
956881141834895360 2018-01-26 13:26:56 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Finish the week strong so you can enjoy the weekend!

955761773784829952 2018-01-23 11:18:58 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @SarahPalinUSA That makes no sense at all, but then it did come from Moore, so it is typical. He is out of touch with reality.

She is not attending the state of the union because the President doesnt deserve her attention.........so she goes on a cable news show to announce this???? Seems like he already has her attention.

952514274009677831 2018-01-14 12:14:34 UTC <JeffPhillips05> Some dummy makes a mistake and presses a button in Hawaii sounding an alert of a possible missile strike and SOMEHOW this is President Trumps fault??? Are people really this dumb?
952505293849624576 2018-01-14 11:38:53 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @redpillblack Well said. Thank you for sharing those thoughts.

951413437464219648 2018-01-11 11:20:14 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @SLYR123 I wonder if the people at @splcenter or the parents they speak of sleep with the doors to their house wide open or do they close them and lock them to protect their children from unwelcome visitors?

951195262902554625 2018-01-10 20:53:17 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @Lady_Vi_2U Thank you. Sad, just sad that they seem to love being a part of the swamp rather than a part of #MAGA and giving our country back to the people who elected them.
951193621172248576 2018-01-10 20:46:46 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @seanhannity Dont give her idiotic tweets and nonsense any air time or publicity. That is all she is wanting.
951189987772567554 2018-01-10 20:32:19 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @Lady_Vi_2U If the story about him doing this is true, and Im not saying it isnt, then its a very situation that he turned into more of a politician than someone who stood for American values.

950370725323472896 2018-01-08 14:16:52 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @nbc Is this true? Are you @NBC openly backing someone as a candidate for the Presidency? Is your bias that much in the open now? Please relinquish your press passes then. You are not independent, not reporters of the news any more.
950195895693344768 2018-01-07 02:42:09 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @_Truth_Guardian I cant watch it. They are all just a train wreck.

949623393917243392 2018-01-06 12:47:14 UTC <JeffPhillips05> @specialK1947 In general, I would say because they follow a certain ideology rather than a fact based platform.
