969990675264516096 2018-03-03 17:39:33 UTC <BigToastyToast> @SaffronOlive I would check GameStop just to be safe. There seems to be an influx of people on Facebook groups posting the individual packs from Ixalan saying they are from there

968856902699433985 2018-02-28 14:34:20 UTC <BigToastyToast> @ChrisWesseling So grab him an INT heavy QB so the defense gets more play time

Only instead they go out and buy something stupid and cool the day after valentines day that no GF/Wife would approve of since they don't have to buy a gift. Like a medieval sword. #GuylentinesDay

949659418689388545 2018-01-06 15:10:23 UTC <BigToastyToast> @SaffronOlive Yeah but being capped at 2 mythics in a deck would really change a lot of these decks from where they are now too. Like only 2 cavern of souls. Only 2 hazoret, etc
949656515723517953 2018-01-06 14:58:51 UTC <BigToastyToast> @SaffronOlive Heres a hypothetical question. Mythics are supposed to be more rare right? What if wizards changed constructed to only allow 2-3 copies max of each mythic in a deck?

948073136586596352 2018-01-01 06:07:04 UTC <BigToastyToast> It could also be that Doug may want to keep any film unusable against other defenses. Dont give anyone anything extra. The eagles are dialed in. I dont think they lose divisional round. Foles before raiders game is real Foles
948073134510370816 2018-01-01 06:07:04 UTC <BigToastyToast> Injuries to offense are pretty much nonexistent and they would keep 1st round bye regardless.
948073132199362560 2018-01-01 06:07:03 UTC <BigToastyToast> Think about it. Doug could have told Foles and the offense to go out against the raiders and cowboys and compete but dont overdo anything. Stay healthy and dont be flashy.

943179511251660801 2017-12-19 18:01:33 UTC <BigToastyToast> @HarrisHarrisev9 I'm saying that Ben wouldn't have Anakins Saber in the Flashback defending himself from Luke because Maz had it didn't she?
943178288351997952 2017-12-19 17:56:42 UTC <BigToastyToast> @HarrisHarrisev9 No way Maz would have it. Also it raises the question now about the Knights of Ren "Flashback" doesn't it? Because he didn't have the crossguard saber in the part where he defended himself from Luke
942873494278176773 2017-12-18 21:45:33 UTC <BigToastyToast> @football_Kelly They already cloned their QB and coach and are preparing for signing of Bom Trady and Will Welichick
942820272305872896 2017-12-18 18:14:04 UTC <BigToastyToast> @RealMamaEagle Right, but until they are mathematically eliminated they need to be taken seriously
942819276594884608 2017-12-18 18:10:06 UTC <BigToastyToast> @RealMamaEagle I think if dallas is playing a win and get in game for last playoff spot you almost have to get rid of them there. You don't want to give a team like that more chances
942642929532682241 2017-12-17 06:29:22 UTC <BigToastyToast> @RoobNBCS Foles gonna win and fetch us a couple 1st rounders at least

940273808321142784 2017-12-11 17:35:20 UTC <BigToastyToast> Wentz played after tear and threw a TD to break franchise TD record and help his team win. I cant wait for him to come back next season

940227976263634950 2017-12-11 14:33:12 UTC <BigToastyToast> @SaffronOlive I think in all honesty the problem wasnt just energy but there wasnt a way to get rid of it other than making opponents use it.   I still think if they could print something like a grounding rod that zeros out energy it would balance the decks
940224824760156160 2017-12-11 14:20:41 UTC <BigToastyToast> @IgglesCoverage Because the Eagles are a team and not a player, I still see them getting to the SB. Anything can happen any week
940224230959980544 2017-12-11 14:18:19 UTC <BigToastyToast> @NotUrAvgHoodrat @RealMamaEagle I thought Foles could get them to at least NFC champ game in 2013. With a better defense and talent around him now I still believe that at least

938240820909547520 2017-12-05 02:56:58 UTC <BigToastyToast> @wizards_magic @GemOfMagic If Jeremy wasnt around it still wouldnt fix card quality though. Other youtubers have made similar claims and it would be nice to have better quality in product

937751236606017536 2017-12-04 18:31:32 UTC <BigToastyToast> @4thandJawn Absolutely. All week it was said it would be good for them to see some adversity. 10-2 is not bad and they could still see 14-2. It doesn't matter if they lose in week 13, it matters if they lost this one in Jan-Feb
937714242257481730 2017-12-04 16:04:31 UTC <BigToastyToast> @RealMamaEagle i can take or leave homefield advantage, doesn't bother me. I just want them to get a bye after working so hard this year
937578068142522369 2017-12-03 07:03:25 UTC <BigToastyToast> Eagles lost and thats ok. They dont need to be number 1 in week 13, they need to be at top in February

915430931439116288 2017-10-03 04:18:36 UTC <BigToastyToast> @RealMamaEagle Should have won 163 then...pic.twitter.com/uOUBkAApd8

915237496111349760 2017-10-03 15:29:58 UTC <BigToastyToast> @NoPhlyZone5 I give the Eagles a loose number 3 though. Big plays need to stop and clean up fourth quarter. At least we are finishing games this year!
915230505632653315 2017-10-03 15:02:11 UTC <BigToastyToast> Im excited for PHI vs. AZ. I think the eagles will finally get that elusive win against Arians that we keep missing every meeting

910160354902024192 2017-09-19 15:15:13 UTC <BigToastyToast> @RealMamaEagle If I can say one thing is consistent over the years is that the Eagles pass rush eats very well when they face the Giants at home
910158712668438528 2017-09-19 15:08:41 UTC <BigToastyToast> @RealMamaEagle I have not seen one thing at all from the giants that makes me the least bit worried. If the Eagles lose this game then they deserve it

909770717356376065 2017-09-18 13:26:56 UTC <BigToastyToast> Why are Eagles fans crying for a RB? Didn't you see that line? You couldn't put 2012 Adrian Peterson behind that line and flourish.

877304822243803136 2017-06-20 23:19:03 UTC <BigToastyToast> @UnsleevedMedia Not worried about it. Sideboard card and it can be mitigated by also sideboarding properly
877297586427764736 2017-06-20 22:50:18 UTC <BigToastyToast> I respect the police and support them, but I am not supportive of this one bit. The acquittal is wrong and there needs to be consequences

874807982118256640 2017-06-13 01:57:30 UTC <BigToastyToast> @E3 My suggestion is if you aspire to texture stuff for years and years then game design is for you
874807386317365248 2017-06-13 01:55:08 UTC <BigToastyToast> @bethesda So when Elder Scrolls 6 drops we can expect that piata to be whacked for a good decade too?
874807049246318592 2017-06-13 01:53:48 UTC <BigToastyToast> @wizards_magic @Timenight113 35-40% is unhealthy for any format. Around 15% meta for a tier one deck is probably where it needs to be

874667568941809665 2017-06-13 16:39:33 UTC <BigToastyToast> @RealMamaEagle Ultra Sun and Moon still a thing
874665288154832897 2017-06-13 16:30:29 UTC <BigToastyToast> @RealMamaEagle I think it will be. It's got to end sooner or later on 3ds and I think after Ultra Sun/Moon they will be moving on
874664802638905344 2017-06-13 16:28:34 UTC <BigToastyToast> @RealMamaEagle Can't wait to hear more about Pokmon for switch later on

874654288340963330 2017-06-13 15:46:47 UTC <BigToastyToast> @wizards_magic Thank Bontu! If you see Modern Meta no deck is above 10% which is where standard needs to be

873544292286865410 2017-06-10 14:16:03 UTC <BigToastyToast> @jakejoelmtg I think after this I will film myself opening the packages and checking the card on camera
873544138414673920 2017-06-10 14:15:26 UTC <BigToastyToast> @jakejoelmtg Kept saying I was trying to scam him. I'm just trying to get cards to play with competitively so I want real ones

864023451962441728 2017-05-15 07:43:38 UTC <BigToastyToast> @jakejoelmtg Plus I already own 90% of the deck I need.  I only had to buy 2 dread wanderers and I got 2 westvale abbey and 2 bonepicker for sideboard
864021412767449088 2017-05-15 07:35:32 UTC <BigToastyToast> @jakejoelmtg But I went ahead and committed to my zombie deck. I think with a lot of low cost cards they cannot simply counter everything
864021238863151104 2017-05-15 07:34:50 UTC <BigToastyToast> @jakejoelmtg It's pretty much UW with cycling for approach or actually the big problem wasn't UW it was UR. Basically torrentialx4 and dynavolt
863922495568531457 2017-05-14 01:02:28 UTC <BigToastyToast> @jakejoelmtg The other deck I have is a Jeskai exert deck that uses always watching and have some control in there to counter some also (3)
863921587640180736 2017-05-14 00:58:52 UTC <BigToastyToast> @jakejoelmtg I noticed mono black zombies would just struggle a ton as I did last FNM. Would you still try and play zombies or try something else? (2)
863921322249773056 2017-05-14 00:57:48 UTC <BigToastyToast> @jakejoelmtg I have a dilemma and want to get your opinion on which way to go. Most people at LGS play U/W control it seems (1)
863841558533070848 2017-05-14 19:40:51 UTC <BigToastyToast> @G3RRYT @magicprotour I love my zombie deck, the problem is I keep getting controlled into oblivion at FNM
863469322223501312 2017-05-13 19:01:43 UTC <BigToastyToast> @jakejoelmtg So much. Like disallows and negate and torrential gearhulks and commit//memory. Was a pain lol
863287567688409090 2017-05-12 06:59:29 UTC <BigToastyToast> @jakejoelmtg Update. I played 4 control decks at FNM and got worked. If this is what to expect game day I need to do something different haha

841296158270017536 2017-03-13 14:33:29 UTC <BigToastyToast> I don't think he backs up Sanchez. I think he is #2 and howie makes more moves
841294886473154561 2017-03-13 14:28:26 UTC <BigToastyToast> did you see what other backups are making? This is a small step above Sanchez money. Plus structure is everything
840944209163042818 2017-03-12 15:14:58 UTC <BigToastyToast> @RealMamaEagle well, don't propose in a mall in broad daylight. I think a locked car a lake or cliff is better

822976585800089600 2017-01-21 01:18:02 UTC <BigToastyToast> @mcten what a babbling mess this is. So Gregg even admits it wasn't a woman's march but another anti trump march. This guy is a journalist?
822963341538660353 2017-01-21 00:25:25 UTC <BigToastyToast> @ChamberofSages I was like, "where's the green squar......oh...wow...that's big!"

822861215433035776 2017-01-21 17:39:36 UTC <BigToastyToast> @SNFonNBC that or it's not as cold in socal.
822860802940026880 2017-01-21 17:37:58 UTC <BigToastyToast> it isn't a problem for everyone which is bad on my part
822860729048961024 2017-01-21 17:37:40 UTC <BigToastyToast> not trying to be rude I guess I am ignorant on this. Thats what happens when it isn't a problem for me, I sometimes assume
822859387072937985 2017-01-21 17:32:20 UTC <BigToastyToast> getting it?
822859362200756224 2017-01-21 17:32:14 UTC <BigToastyToast> going back to birth control, is this not something covered? I haven't seen it be a problem for my sister or wife ever
822857956265865216 2017-01-21 17:26:39 UTC <BigToastyToast> wall not really, but better protections would be nice.
822857375535099905 2017-01-21 17:24:20 UTC <BigToastyToast> securing borders makes sense and I think people here under DACA should stay and be given an opportunity for citizenship
822856926207717376 2017-01-21 17:22:33 UTC <BigToastyToast> they do nothing but make everything worse
822856825418592256 2017-01-21 17:22:09 UTC <BigToastyToast> but only time will tell at this point. I do not agree with the fringe alt right people. Those guys can kick rocks
822856701070090240 2017-01-21 17:21:40 UTC <BigToastyToast> I wish I had an answer for racial tensions. From the inauguration speech he seems like he wants to help heal the divide
822855527164047361 2017-01-21 17:17:00 UTC <BigToastyToast> something else in place soon. Don't want people to be out of coverage just because of one guy
822855426404253696 2017-01-21 17:16:36 UTC <BigToastyToast> I was hoping that it could be lowered under trump but I also believe from what I'm hearing that there is going to be
822855233835368449 2017-01-21 17:15:50 UTC <BigToastyToast> I pay right now over $400 a month just for medical and $70 for dental and $25 a month for vision. It is rough
822854292088328192 2017-01-21 17:12:05 UTC <BigToastyToast> yeah
822854240779440128 2017-01-21 17:11:53 UTC <BigToastyToast> me starting a family
822854217140310016 2017-01-21 17:11:47 UTC <BigToastyToast> the Medicare thing is tricky. When Obamacare went through my monthly payment doubled on insurance which was tough for
822853952693637120 2017-01-21 17:10:44 UTC <BigToastyToast> when the access Hollywood tapes came out. We guys aren't perfect and I was happy to see him admit to his fault
822853802478870529 2017-01-21 17:10:09 UTC <BigToastyToast> firstly I don't condone any behavior he has had towards women. I do however believe his apology was genuine and swift
822851180220928006 2017-01-21 16:59:43 UTC <BigToastyToast> What are your concerns?
822839239947653121 2017-01-21 16:12:17 UTC <BigToastyToast> @womensmarch @dorableArmFlail but what is "better"? I guess it would need to be identified on what is bad for women right now.
822837230892761088 2017-01-21 16:04:18 UTC <BigToastyToast> @darrenrovell @mulvihill79 why go anywhere other than Fox News? All the other networks did was bitch and moan the whole time
822831128935473154 2017-01-21 15:40:03 UTC <BigToastyToast> @womensmarch pretty sure every country women are marching in today give women the most rights compared to countries with actual persecution
822827817310109696 2017-01-21 15:26:53 UTC <BigToastyToast> @BigToastyToast see above comment
822827732698427392 2017-01-21 15:26:33 UTC <BigToastyToast> @cindycrabb I'm confused when was this taken away?
822826690908819456 2017-01-21 15:22:25 UTC <BigToastyToast> Why not try and make a difference where there is real oppression and persecution against women and protest there? #WomensMarch
822826549766258688 2017-01-21 15:21:51 UTC <BigToastyToast> What's interesting is that these protests are all happening in countries where women are free to do as they please really. #WomensMarch
822824753903779842 2017-01-21 15:14:43 UTC <BigToastyToast> @Jeanette4Trump I'm confused. What's the march for? I didn't know women were being oppressed in this country where you can do anything.

796898860148756480 2016-11-10 02:14:28 UTC <BigToastyToast> @ReversingASD It's a bit complicated. If trump finally nabs MI then he will be at 309. you would have to get 40 reps to flip

796568354098216960 2016-11-09 04:21:09 UTC <BigToastyToast> @FoxNews Hey @POTUS you need to fix this. They need to respect democracy not seek to tear it down
796562857714388993 2016-11-09 03:59:19 UTC <BigToastyToast> @JenCMarketing The majority of young democrats have education in their lives and are well informed, but easily influenced. Need discernment
796560784964931584 2016-11-09 03:51:05 UTC <BigToastyToast> Respect the democratic process. I know you guys are intelligent but please apply wisdom to that as well. Hillary conceded. #TrumpProtest
796559715199291392 2016-11-09 03:46:50 UTC <BigToastyToast> @markavilez89 Not seek more division. I was upset when Obama was elected but he won and I got over it and participated in this country
796559436366090241 2016-11-09 03:45:43 UTC <BigToastyToast> @markavilez89 and the outrage should have come before the election. That is the democratic process. It is time to come together.....
796559236964773892 2016-11-09 03:44:56 UTC <BigToastyToast> @markavilez89 is actually in place so that people living in any state will have a fair chance to be heard, not just cities.

796496948387835905 2016-11-09 23:37:25 UTC <BigToastyToast> @IngrahamAngle Laura, so with pollsters being dead wrong about this, do you think they may have Obama's approval a little padded?

788096074036699136 2016-10-17 19:15:20 UTC <BigToastyToast> @_Philly_Talk most people I know had us either 3-2 or 4-1 at this point with different losses.
788053377422860288 2016-10-17 16:25:41 UTC <BigToastyToast> On the bright side #EaglesNation Wentz still only has 1 INT through 5 games!
788045781378830336 2016-10-17 15:55:30 UTC <BigToastyToast> @njdotcom @EliotShorrParks not Howie, the coaching needs to be better
788025237937938432 2016-10-17 14:33:52 UTC <BigToastyToast> Well the eagles could also be holding back after so many penalties. Not as aggresive because they don't want to be flagged.
787843307342880769 2016-10-16 02:30:56 UTC <BigToastyToast> @RSherman_25 @NFL @LLewellynJr I think every flag should be reviewable at least give the head 15 seconds to look at it. Flags ruin games

787448139577831425 2016-10-15 00:20:41 UTC <BigToastyToast> @Eagles @CornerPubSports Bennie Logan will terrorize that line. I think it's going to be defensive dominance. They need the bounceback
