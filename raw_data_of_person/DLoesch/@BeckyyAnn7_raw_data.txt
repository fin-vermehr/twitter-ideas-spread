961072870599417856 2018-02-06 03:03:22 UTC <BeckyyAnn7> School/work should be canceled for Valentines Day, for those mourning their past failed relationships  And I guess those in flourishing ones as well but thats not applicable to me
938467543500644352 2017-12-06 17:57:52 UTC <BeckyyAnn7> The only good thing about being home sick is I have endless time to study for exams
938264170272903168 2017-12-05 04:29:44 UTC <BeckyyAnn7> I pulled out an entire roll of toilet paper in class today to blow my nose and no one even batted an eye. No one cares about anything in college lol
938192839468560384 2017-12-05 23:46:18 UTC <BeckyyAnn7> Personally I think its really inappropriate for professors to cuss and talk politics in class when its completely irrelevant to the course
