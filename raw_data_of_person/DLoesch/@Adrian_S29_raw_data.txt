968831091384741888 2018-02-28 12:51:46 UTC <Adrian_S29> @CNN I'm ok with that. Very solid decision. We should look into raising the minimum voting age to be 21 as well.

704429416533905408 2016-02-29 22:13:55 UTC <Adrian_S29> @marcorubio You need to stop bashing Trump. Stop acting like a jealous 15 year old and act like the next president of the U.S.
