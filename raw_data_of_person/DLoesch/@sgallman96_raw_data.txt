942929037147688961 2017-12-18 01:26:15 UTC <sgallman96> @TonyDungy I agree with you coach
942748783259062273 2017-12-18 13:30:00 UTC <sgallman96> @QualkTalk In my opinion for what it is worth,  James had control of the ball as it crosses the plane and once it crossed the plane that should be the end of the play.  Now with the rule as it is written I understand why they called it the way they did.  I do have a biased opinion lol.
