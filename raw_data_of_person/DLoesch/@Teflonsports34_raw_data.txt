970758186545434625 2018-03-05 20:29:22 UTC <Teflonsports34> @CJImondi Me either but I doubtvhe leaves hell come back to bears and give them something reasonable
970757826250465281 2018-03-05 20:27:56 UTC <Teflonsports34> @CJImondi Hes gonna see what hes worth
970757553570353153 2018-03-05 20:26:51 UTC <Teflonsports34> @ErikLambert1 Love it! Keep up the good work I love reading your post and everything
970755219134058496 2018-03-05 20:17:34 UTC <Teflonsports34> @ErikLambert1 Agreed! Do you think Watkins is a guy bears go after?
970754150765088770 2018-03-05 20:13:19 UTC <Teflonsports34> @ErikLambert1 I agree with you a lot on that! He could be much better
970751194699321344 2018-03-05 20:01:35 UTC <Teflonsports34> @ErikLambert1 I like hearing that! So you dont think key is a first round guarantee anymore?
970750667068526593 2018-03-05 19:59:29 UTC <Teflonsports34> @ErikLambert1 Do you think bears will@talk with him or no? And what about donte Jackson or Kevin tolliver and DJ chark? Guys we would go after?
970750270429978624 2018-03-05 19:57:54 UTC <Teflonsports34> @ErikLambert1 Let me ask you this! Being I am a LSU fan I would love to see us get Arden key! Do you think hes a second round target for us?
970749944196947968 2018-03-05 19:56:37 UTC <Teflonsports34> @ErikLambert1 Oh no I agree with you on that but I mean wouldnt you rather get a defensive play maker first? Someone to play opposite of Floyd?
970749555359866881 2018-03-05 19:55:04 UTC <Teflonsports34> @ErikLambert1 I dont want him! No need to draft a guard in first! Need playmakers pass rushers more important or a corner! Hes good but def not best in my opinion
970749242997444608 2018-03-05 19:53:49 UTC <Teflonsports34> @ErikLambert1 Its not Nelson so no thanks
970745546775375874 2018-03-05 19:39:08 UTC <Teflonsports34> @Arjun_AJB15 Nah nah Im not saying youre not entitled man but cmon? You know so much I cant believe you would think q need be fired cmon
970745357574557696 2018-03-05 19:38:23 UTC <Teflonsports34> @ErikLambert1 Erik? Do you actually think hes first round worthy? Ive watched so much Alabama games and hes not as good as everyone thinks
970745016460161025 2018-03-05 19:37:02 UTC <Teflonsports34> @Arjun_AJB15 This is honestly the dumbest tweet you have ever made! My dad is laughing at the fact I read this to him! Q can only do so much a few bad seasons doesnt mean he needs to be fired
970729074904756226 2018-03-05 18:33:41 UTC <Teflonsports34> @tym2g3thi Wow thats insane
970711403920347138 2018-03-05 17:23:28 UTC <Teflonsports34> @thegeorgeyou Ill never admit to that lol
970710691668746241 2018-03-05 17:20:38 UTC <Teflonsports34> @thegeorgeyou Fucj the packers Lolol still though! Bears getting Watkins now that hes gonna be a FA I dont want Landry I want Watkins we can save money getting watkins
970709945896357889 2018-03-05 17:17:40 UTC <Teflonsports34> @thegeorgeyou In my opinion I know that wentz is good but foles did enough to at least get another crack at being starter there
970709769718784000 2018-03-05 17:16:58 UTC <Teflonsports34> Bears Watkins! Make it happen
970709438603628544 2018-03-05 17:15:39 UTC <Teflonsports34> Watkins and robinson
970709297612185608 2018-03-05 17:15:06 UTC <Teflonsports34> Holy shit bears can get watkins
970709110135119873 2018-03-05 17:14:21 UTC <Teflonsports34> @thegeorgeyou Nah itll be trash lol no where near ours
970699491698503680 2018-03-05 16:36:08 UTC <Teflonsports34> You arent getting him hes using the market to see what hes worth and then hes coming back to Chicagohttps://twitter.com/mr_kevinjones/status/970698921587568641
970696643522777088 2018-03-05 16:24:49 UTC <Teflonsports34> @ErikLambert1 Does this mean maybe Howard and Landry do swap?
970696462156910593 2018-03-05 16:24:05 UTC <Teflonsports34> I wouldnt mind bears getting Joshua Jackson he seems like an amazing player but then you get key round 2
970691594901970944 2018-03-05 16:04:45 UTC <Teflonsports34> @tym2g3thi Broncos fit him best

970681689067401216 2018-03-05 15:25:23 UTC <Teflonsports34> Nobody wants denZel ward om the bears! No thanks! Give me donte Jackson anyday

970013616706551815 2018-03-03 19:10:42 UTC <Teflonsports34> @thegeorgeyou True very true
970013077151379458 2018-03-03 19:08:34 UTC <Teflonsports34> @thegeorgeyou I mean I love landry LOVE HIM! Because he went to LSU but I will be very hurt if we lose Howard but maybe Nagy wants a fast offense?
970012710510452738 2018-03-03 19:07:06 UTC <Teflonsports34> @thegeorgeyou They both are huge at their positions! But how reliable is this mullin guy!
970012549340172288 2018-03-03 19:06:28 UTC <Teflonsports34> If we get rid of Howard then we better BETTER GET GUICE
970012431626928128 2018-03-03 19:06:00 UTC <Teflonsports34> How accurate and reliable is moon mullin?
970012051144929280 2018-03-03 19:04:29 UTC <Teflonsports34> @moonmullinNBCS @NBCSChicago The way I look at it Matt Nagy didnt have a big powerful running back in his offenses he had speed and elusiveness I understand the trade but it be dumb I want Landry but not for howard
970011060488097792 2018-03-03 19:00:33 UTC <Teflonsports34> @thegeorgeyou Dont believe the hype of Ridley! Ridley is only good because he played at bama play anywhere else he wouldnt be a first rounder

969999891975098370 2018-03-03 18:16:10 UTC <Teflonsports34> @mikebrez5 @thegeorgeyou Because Ridley isnt that good! Ridley is only relevant cuz he went to bama
969998985443323909 2018-03-03 18:12:34 UTC <Teflonsports34> The rockets bench cannot keep up with warriors bench and we have way too many scorers
969998641539829762 2018-03-03 18:11:12 UTC <Teflonsports34> This is why James harden wont win a title because hes too cocky and a piece of garbage! We will run all over the rocketshttps://twitter.com/fortnitefunny/status/969309586787307522
