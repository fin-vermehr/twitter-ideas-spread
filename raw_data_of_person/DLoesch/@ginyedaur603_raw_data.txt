970964717622657026 2018-03-06 10:10:02 UTC <ginyedaur603> It's a shame because she ticked all the boxes.  Why are Labour doing this to a black transgender white hating Socialist?  She was perfect.https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/970963249196920833

970657673967472641 2018-03-05 13:49:58 UTC <ginyedaur603> @CarolineFlintMP @gdonald1 @nmckay958 Likewise. I have nothing in common with your political beliefs or national identity yet you believe we are one nation of Scots. Us against the world that somehow we're different from the Irish English and Welsh. You will have a lot more in common with a lot of them than me.
970656903087915010 2018-03-05 13:46:54 UTC <ginyedaur603> @CarolineFlintMP @derek_weir @Ladylotteboom @JamieRalstonjd Yes that's why the only time the SNP voted with the Tory back benchers was on FFA. Because they like everyone else they knew it was an SNP bluff that's why they're so quiet about it now. They know Scotland would be screwed. UK is different from those other countries.
970656000293425153 2018-03-05 13:43:19 UTC <ginyedaur603> @CarolineFlintMP @gdonald1 @nmckay958 Niki I know what it said in the manifesto. You can childishly tick tock away but even a dyed in the wool Nationalist like you can see the numbers don't stack up for you.  Even if you can't see it I bet you wee nippy can. Stickers on your cars and house windows don't change minds.

It wouldn't have made one iota of difference to you and the vast majority of YES voters what extra powers the Smith commission sent to Scotland. You were going to vote YES anyway & I was going to vote NO.

970580604243861505 2018-03-05 08:43:43 UTC <ginyedaur603> @CarolineFlintMP @debs_reilly Well your certainly not in touch with SNP rhetoric. They say its not about the SCOTTISH but the people of Scotland taking in all nationalities that live here. Totally ignoring the fact a large number of their fan base hate the English with a passion.

970292013559177216 2018-03-04 13:36:57 UTC <ginyedaur603> I remember when Labour were last in power 1997-2010 we had real Socialism, they abolished capitalism & the stock exchange, ended war, poverty & homelessness, kicked all the Billionaires out the country. We had equality. I even had my cell in Carstairs state hospital refurbished.https://twitter.com/liamyoung/status/969245650905976832

966262255217250305 2018-02-21 10:44:08 UTC <ginyedaur603> @davieclegg @kelpiemare The SNP for years heaped praise on Ireland, Iceland and Norway as the arc of prosperity. Both Ireland &  Iceland  are among the most indebted countries in the world & offered low tax havens for big companies & corporations. Norway's wealth fund is in every tax haven that exists.

Am I right in saying  that Socialism has been around for 120 years or more and forms the foundation and principles for Communism and everyone from calling themselves Socialist in the past got it so terribly wrong but you've got it right?

957565541132193792 2018-01-28 10:46:30 UTC <ginyedaur603> @theSNP The first minister confirmed that if voters backed independence in the near future, Scotland would need a dramatic improvement in its finances to bring its current spending deficit of 8.3% down to 3%, the level most economists see as sustainable. Her words not mine. #livingalie

Even Nicola hinted an Independent Scotland would have to address the deficit. Independence would see these freebies disappear. 8.3%

Never spoke to anyone who can tell me what tax raising power Scotland should have that would make them support Scotland in the UK.

930550282571911168 2017-11-14 21:37:30 UTC <ginyedaur603> @MammothWhale @dave333albiston It was a UK vote not a Scottish vote.  You keep saying the Scottish people when you dont know how the 800,000 Scottish people who live elsewhere in the UK voted. A third of Nationalists voted BREXIT are they traitors? Most Unionists voted remain yet youll see them as traitors.

924158855592009728 2017-10-27 06:20:15 UTC <ginyedaur603> @incongru One day they would like to hold an illegal referendum with 57% of the population not bothering to vote so they can declare UDI.

919865741784076288 2017-10-16 10:00:57 UTC <ginyedaur603> @LBC So this amounts to the Tories spending too much and not having enough cuts. 50 YRS of debt is what happens when you have a Labour GVT.

896986836337340416 2017-08-13 06:48:21 UTC <ginyedaur603> @NicolaSturgeon @Nezcream Not at all. I'm showing a Nationalist a picture of her parties founder with some German Nationalists. Her party is built on hatred.

868533439909253120 2017-05-27 18:24:43 UTC <ginyedaur603> He was arrested outside the old Bailey at the trial of Gerry McGee who murdered 5 innocent people in their sleep.
868532620816240645 2017-05-27 18:21:28 UTC <ginyedaur603> The Birmingham pub bombings were in 1974, he became an MP in 1983. Also I can remember him on TV shouting down Britain but never the IRA.

839448464383696896 2017-03-08 12:11:24 UTC <ginyedaur603> @AJABurnett @AnnieWellsMSP @HairyAngus I don't think they're nationalist's. I'm a proud Scot but that doesn't make me a nationalist.
839447847758082049 2017-03-08 12:08:57 UTC <ginyedaur603> @AJABurnett @AnnieWellsMSP @HairyAngus It's the way you think that makes you a nationalist.

839446366652928004 2017-03-08 12:03:04 UTC <ginyedaur603> @AJABurnett @AnnieWellsMSP @HairyAngus It's a flag. I believe nationalism is a state of mind in your case a mythical state of mind.

830209651526553600 2017-02-10 00:19:40 UTC <ginyedaur603> @Jonny_Nabb @spkitty Are the Scottish Governments figures lying?
830209048482086913 2017-02-10 00:17:16 UTC <ginyedaur603> @Jonny_Nabb @spkitty That's not true. More money per capita being spent in Scotland than the rest of the UK.

830206692830896128 2017-02-10 00:07:54 UTC <ginyedaur603> @Jonny_Nabb UK is the member. Deficit is the amount Scotland spends in public services compared to how much it raises in taxation.

830192701995900928 2017-02-10 23:12:19 UTC <ginyedaur603> @Jonny_Nabb Correct
830192357022760960 2017-02-10 23:10:56 UTC <ginyedaur603> @allmhurach11 So do I but here's the thing it only exists in some peoples heads. The country moved on from that after WW2.
830192047193718784 2017-02-10 23:09:42 UTC <ginyedaur603> @Jonny_Nabb It would be an EU budget sent to Brussels  not income tax or VAT, however the EU can tell you how to spend it.
830191177810972673 2017-02-10 23:06:15 UTC <ginyedaur603> @MusicStoo Nothing intelligent to say and anonymous. You're a really brave Nationalist.

830190220393988096 2017-02-10 23:02:27 UTC <ginyedaur603> @Jonny_Nabb You say so without an explanation.
830189450550468609 2017-02-10 22:59:23 UTC <ginyedaur603> @JamesMelville @clancy_w A lot of people get mixed up with debt & deficit they are two different things. Scotland spends more than it raises

830186389207658496 2017-02-10 22:47:13 UTC <ginyedaur603> @JamesMelville @clancy_w You just made that up. What does the EU say about a 15 Billion deficit?
830184651570425856 2017-02-10 22:40:19 UTC <ginyedaur603> @Jonny_Nabb That's correct hate Nationalism & have Union flag in my AVI. If I had a Saltire would I be a nationalist?

830105201700921344 2017-02-10 17:24:37 UTC <ginyedaur603> Have the SNP got a plan to reduce Scotland's massive deficit for entry into the EU. Iv'e not heard anything from them.

829941042015248384 2017-02-09 06:32:18 UTC <ginyedaur603> @guardiannews Spain has already said never. Also I'm sure the EU will want to support Scotland's 15 Billion annual deficit.

829240561634856961 2017-02-08 08:08:51 UTC <ginyedaur603> @DonnaV20 Donna that's not true. G.E.R.S. figures. If your household bills. are 1,400 & your income is 1,200 your running deficit is 200.

829229345650638850 2017-02-07 07:24:16 UTC <ginyedaur603> @trackmybets1 @DonnaV20 Absolutely. That's why Scotland doesn't feel the effects of the 15 Billion deficit we run or real austerity.

805893345528729602 2016-12-05 21:55:21 UTC <ginyedaur603> @mungler @Tensacrowd You have self governance through Westminster and Holyrood. You'd have Scotland skint to thumb your nose at the Tories.

805535252756201472 2016-12-04 22:12:25 UTC <ginyedaur603> @RuthDavidsonMSP @Tensacrowd Right back at you. You do know the SNP aren't in opposition don't you. They even call themselves Government.
805532923785052161 2016-12-04 22:03:09 UTC <ginyedaur603> SOME Nationalists stoop very low to get their hatred across.

729782148966842368 2016-05-09 21:16:37 UTC <ginyedaur603> @billybragg @feedthedrummer Are you saying stupid nationalists didn't know she was a Tory & voted for her by accident. I see your point.
729781432206430209 2016-05-09 21:13:46 UTC <ginyedaur603> @billybragg @feedthedrummer As a socialist how could you even contemplate supporting Nationalism. The notion of superiority & entitlement.

729739446409699328 2016-05-09 18:26:56 UTC <ginyedaur603> @ArthurStramash @theSNP Time & time again when there was criticism of the SNP we were told it's not about them, I remember it well.

729577908939919360 2016-05-09 07:45:03 UTC <ginyedaur603> @theSNP I thought Independence wasn't about the SNP. That was a lie then.

702992465045954560 2016-02-25 23:03:59 UTC <ginyedaur603> @iluvfilms  Buy raising taxes how else ? If you don't want to cut anything {austerity} Then you need to raise tax & keep current spending.
702973382434934785 2016-02-25 21:48:09 UTC <ginyedaur603> @iluvfilms My point is the Scottish Government are opposed to austerity but have no answer to it in their draft budget.
702972925499068417 2016-02-25 21:46:20 UTC <ginyedaur603> @iluvfilms You tell tell me, your opposed to austerity not me. Earn under 11,000 pay no tax whatsoever, all tax bands cut up to 43,000.

702967920410955778 2016-02-25 21:26:27 UTC <ginyedaur603> @iluvfilms SNP Draft budget made in December for 2016-17 included tax band control. Had no tax increases. Carbon copy of UK GVT tax plans.
