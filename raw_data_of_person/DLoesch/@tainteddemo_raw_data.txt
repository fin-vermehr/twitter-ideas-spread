967403172355506176 2018-02-24 14:17:44 UTC <tainteddemo> The truth is you can promise nothing. 4 armed teachers might have reduced the death toll. Or could have been killed as well. Or could have added to the number of victims shot or killed. That is an unknowable outcome being thrown around as a certainty.
967402152871301120 2018-02-24 14:13:41 UTC <tainteddemo> Its easy to presume to know what was happening on the ground at the time.

We Americans kill each other at a staggering rate compared to the rest of the world, and states with more guns to tend to have more gun deaths. They create more problems than they solve.https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts
966129460532666368 2018-02-20 01:56:27 UTC <tainteddemo> More guns simply lead to more deaths. In order to adequately secure our schools we need to remove weapons that can be used for mass murder from the equation.https://twitter.com/thebabygorilla/status/966041397295009794
