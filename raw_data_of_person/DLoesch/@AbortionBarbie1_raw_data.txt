970471350132531201 2018-03-04 01:29:35 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @redsteeze The message was that Hillary isn't the President.  Yes!

970399468813193217 2018-03-04 20:43:57 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @DLoesch @cyberbiota Sad thing is, she could kick your butt.  Probably inside of 30 seconds.
970366357131931649 2018-03-04 18:32:22 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @stephenfhayes @saletan Sort of like Obama and his Justice Dept not defending the laws of the US?  Got it.
970365783569260546 2018-03-04 18:30:05 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @JVLast @Glennsford And then YOU cry.  Please.
970365612374585344 2018-03-04 18:29:25 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @JVLast So much worse than Obama ignoring the Constitution.  SMH.
970365313308151808 2018-03-04 18:28:13 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @JVLast @Gonzobaggins @mindyjolyons Still better than 8 years/4 years/1 minute of a Hillary presidency.
970125914834194433 2018-03-03 02:36:56 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @PPIndKentucky @deb2156 @justalmary @medicjudd Quit bringing up facts.  Their feelings get hurted.

969970584074571777 2018-03-03 16:19:43 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @FLOTUS @RealPeerReview @realJudaldButru WTF????
969970257057271809 2018-03-03 16:18:25 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @SkyNews Sounds like good hunting with an AR-15!

969968074400124928 2018-03-03 16:09:44 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson We developed that!
969967894200307715 2018-03-03 16:09:01 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @ComfortablySmug If businesses manage themselves based on progressives' Twitter tantrums, they get what they deserve.
969967066479460353 2018-03-03 16:05:44 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @USATODAY Duck felta.
969966623980507137 2018-03-03 16:03:58 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @ChrisLoesch Sure.  To the Left, means justify the ends.  Violence, murder, sexual degradation, misogyny, it's all good.
969966279728693248 2018-03-03 16:02:36 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Who is she to decide?
969965879898398720 2018-03-03 16:01:01 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Maybe I should be paying more for my beer.

969255769337204736 2018-03-01 16:59:17 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @WSJ Sliding further into hell.......
968903763292549121 2018-02-28 17:40:33 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @KatiePavlich Absolutely.  I use them and will continue as long as they don't CAVE!!!!
968903173854375937 2018-02-28 17:38:12 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @WSJ Isn't "sisters" hurtful to those who attend but identify as male????
968902503285841920 2018-02-28 17:35:32 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Grandstanding....
968187316492697600 2018-02-26 18:13:38 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @ElliottRHams I suspect a law outlawing discrimination in choosing sexual partners is in the works?
968186558523297792 2018-02-26 18:10:38 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @DLoesch C'mon.  I'm waiting.
968186369855184896 2018-02-26 18:09:53 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Has anyone blamed Putin for the attack yet?  Asking for a friend.
968166273145364480 2018-02-26 16:50:01 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @nytimes Sorry, you're nowhere near objective.  And not worth protecting.
968161822586163206 2018-02-26 16:32:20 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Risa_amor @ggreenwald @sinmck @thegayempire I'll forget by lunch time.  Now go away.
968161423229620224 2018-02-26 16:30:45 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Risa_amor @ggreenwald @sinmck @thegayempire Not learned a thing.  At least from you.  Sorry, bidness calls.
968160818230636544 2018-02-26 16:28:21 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Risa_amor @ggreenwald @sinmck @thegayempire I'm cool wit dat.
968160651209256961 2018-02-26 16:27:41 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @RealPeerReview Pedagogue not mentioned?  Clutch the pearls.
968160265056464896 2018-02-26 16:26:09 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Risa_amor @ggreenwald @sinmck @thegayempire Aberrant.  Faulty programming.  But whatever your itching ears want to believe....
968158514660237312 2018-02-26 16:19:12 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ggreenwald @mizladyjayne Agreed.  Ever since homosexual marriage was legislated, I don't care what happens to this country.  We are no longer a moral country.
968158130587783168 2018-02-26 16:17:40 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Risa_amor @ggreenwald @sinmck Happily so.  I'm fine being that way.  Homosexuality is deviance, and against nature.  Sorry.
968157914585321472 2018-02-26 16:16:48 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ggreenwald @Oldnblonde That's the only way libs can win, is to lie.
968157798830878721 2018-02-26 16:16:21 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ggreenwald @crayoh @jifisherohio None deserved. It's deviancy, plain and simple.
968157662163668992 2018-02-26 16:15:48 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ggreenwald Agreed.  We need better orphanages so as to not have to let homosexual couples adopt.
968157434043879424 2018-02-26 16:14:54 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Good Lord.  Why on Earth would we let homosexual "couples" adopt?
968157019185262593 2018-02-26 16:13:15 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @charlescwcooke Consistency and libs don't mix.

967832502781071360 2018-02-25 18:43:44 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @condablev @matthew_w_haas In your little dream world.
967832295733432320 2018-02-25 18:42:55 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @guskenworthy Your last moment of notoriety.  Enjoy it.
967557225681248256 2018-02-24 00:29:53 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @DavidAFrench @CathyGeier @b_crawford_c But you're fully buying into the black shootings by white officers myth.  Hmmmmm....
967556988057128962 2018-02-24 00:28:56 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @DavidAFrench @impulse_random Please.
965782944701927424 2018-02-19 02:59:32 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @DEADLINE @EWErickson Simply hype.  That's all.
965782085351956480 2018-02-19 02:56:07 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @SouthernKeeks Amen.  Thought I was the only one.
965669075346165762 2018-02-19 19:27:03 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @Tweet_tracker1 Oh, and they know how to get the biggest bang for their election rubles.  Perhaps Hillary could learn something.
965651164950941704 2018-02-19 18:15:53 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @InezFeltscher @realPelicanfarm And if ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we'd all have a Merry Christmas.
965650339922890752 2018-02-19 18:12:36 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @InezFeltscher Ouch.  That's going to leave a mark.
965630415318016000 2018-02-19 16:53:26 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @MonsantoCo @JustinBilyj I have a life.  A well-spelled one.  TYVM.

965626618696810497 2018-02-19 16:38:21 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @DouthatNYT @EWErickson @andrewtwalk Wow.  True that.  The whole "itching ears" thing.
965626122112262145 2018-02-19 16:36:22 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @MonsantoCo @JustinBilyj Your grammar says it all.
965625939152564225 2018-02-19 16:35:39 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @MonsantoCo @stonebraker23 It's called responsible.
965625814988607489 2018-02-19 16:35:09 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @MonsantoCo Keep fighting Monsanto.  Don't let these tweetie birds have their way.  They'd happily let half the people on earth starve.
965624658832830464 2018-02-19 16:30:33 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @TimRunsHisMouth Good.  Won't have to see her shellcracker face anymore.
965624399784284160 2018-02-19 16:29:31 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @wsbtv He a happy goat........
965624293597032448 2018-02-19 16:29:06 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @snoopster222 What exactly did they do?  I'm still waiting.....
965623965166329856 2018-02-19 16:27:48 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @Tweet_tracker1 They have an economy the size of Italy's, yet are a co-super power, and punch significantly above their weight.  I admire them in a way.
965623519878008833 2018-02-19 16:26:02 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Amen, amen, amen.
965618396179173376 2018-02-19 16:05:40 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @jaketapper @HotlineJosh @Missing_Winnie @leeshutterbug Eradication for the win.
965617047328690176 2018-02-19 16:00:19 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @baseballcrank Preoccupied with the Russkies.  Cut them some slack.
965616624039596040 2018-02-19 15:58:38 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @neiltyson Evidence collected over many years, obtained from many locations, indicates that the power of Prayer is insufficient to stop Neil Tyson from making inane comments....

965614576963411968 2018-02-19 15:50:30 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @sahouraxo That would be ok.  It's our money to do with as we please.  And it's out in the open.  No comparison.  Thanks for playing, though.
965613992101150722 2018-02-19 15:48:10 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @sahouraxo What I've been saying for some time.  Thanks.
965612345694281728 2018-02-19 15:41:38 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @SonnyBunch I believe Yahoo "crowned" (tiara perhaps?) him America's sweetheart.
965611915077660672 2018-02-19 15:39:55 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Let's forget the whole "he who is without sin" thing.
965611672340705280 2018-02-19 15:38:57 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Why I don't trust the media.  Exhibit 4,332.
965611367280594944 2018-02-19 15:37:44 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @nytopinion Ok, no new revelations here.  Why mess with personal choice?  Do you feel undue pressure to wear yoga pants?
965610359926255616 2018-02-19 15:33:44 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson So trample first amendment to restrict second amendment?
964905857627709440 2018-02-17 16:54:18 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @DailyCaller @tedcruz @bennyjohnson @TankGirl2017 Yay.  He's fighting the good fight.

964223184114511872 2018-02-15 19:41:36 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis So the professor wanting the photographer kicked out was Russian?  Who knew?
964222715854053376 2018-02-15 19:39:44 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis I would the  NFL and ESPN would have a homoerotic relationship.

962481646816694272 2018-02-10 00:21:21 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @RobProvince Pretty sure the libs would turn and praise Hitler, as demented as they are by TDS.
962481133597396992 2018-02-10 00:19:18 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @BruceAshford @Jollymon72 Please, ridicule away.

962476814835777538 2018-02-10 00:02:09 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Honda @carsdotcom 4 banger.  Fail.
962476506789314565 2018-02-10 00:00:55 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @RadioFreeTom @trixied13 You are so delusional.  Sad.  But funny.
962476157571600389 2018-02-10 23:59:32 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @RadioFreeTom I suppose none of them have read the books written by NKs who've escaped.  The part about all of the trees stripped of their bark to about the height of a person with their arms extended got to me.

962470351350521861 2018-02-10 23:36:28 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @dyrbert Ha ha.  Enjoy.
962470187332177931 2018-02-10 23:35:49 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @dyrbert Good riddance.  Put someone in who will do their f'in job.

960611626390040576 2018-02-05 20:30:33 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Duracell I think throwing them at opposing team's outfielders at Phillies games has been the main use.  No?
960611214027034626 2018-02-05 20:28:55 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Why?  Why is breaking that law any different?
960610968479944704 2018-02-05 20:27:56 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis I thought they were all pre med students?

960515875479719937 2018-02-05 14:10:04 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @EdKrassen @ianrobo1 No, but anyone of any means there, including many public servants, have private health care.  Fact.
960515489566023681 2018-02-05 14:08:32 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @realDonaldTrump All about State control over every aspect of our lives.

960512093698035713 2018-02-05 13:55:03 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson But when will the SJWs turn on Foles for being a student at Liberty U.?  Will he have to renounce?
960511551269736448 2018-02-05 13:52:53 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @MrLKCarter We.  We.
960511381337501696 2018-02-05 13:52:13 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @NaFun Yes, that's why he had so many female apostles.

960347627832438784 2018-02-04 03:01:31 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @TMobile I don't care about diversity.  I hire the best people.  Period.
960347341076221952 2018-02-04 03:00:23 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @JanetDowell @TMobile I don't care about diversity.  Only service, results, and hiring the best people.

960346162757763073 2018-02-04 02:55:42 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Holdensmama @TMobile "changes"?  Bad commercial, bad grammar.
960345986227896320 2018-02-04 02:55:00 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @TMobile @Holdensmama Yes, ignore your customers.  Sheesh.
960345651912564736 2018-02-04 02:53:40 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @TMobile @kerrywashington Loser.
960341881967337472 2018-02-04 02:38:41 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @grsr33 @TMobile You are clueless.  Read the reactions.
960341758868688896 2018-02-04 02:38:12 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @TMobile Looks like it was a bust.  Congrats.
960341163667533825 2018-02-04 02:35:50 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @grsr33 @TMobile I guess you're ok with Pedophilia.
960340972159807488 2018-02-04 02:35:04 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @TMobile I'm not with you.  This is how you have to try and get customers?  Selling anything but decent service.
960340401247973381 2018-02-04 02:32:48 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Have to agree.  But I guess they're including Pedos.
960338877495029763 2018-02-04 02:26:45 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @mitchellvii Narrative.
960338556337213440 2018-02-04 02:25:28 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @jaketapper And why are you with him?

959828944190148610 2018-02-03 16:40:27 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @WSJ @ClayTravis Et tu, Michael Bennett?
959652060877778944 2018-02-02 04:57:35 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @nytdavidbrooks @JamilSmith Everything is a bargaining chip, child.
959648843884384256 2018-02-02 04:44:48 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @PolitiFact That's a joke, right?  Grayson is a stark raving lunatic.
959648024720011264 2018-02-02 04:41:33 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @LifeNewsHQ So smart, even then!  No, not really.
959647804963655681 2018-02-02 04:40:40 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Pinch Comey and Hillary?  That might do it.
959647400116871168 2018-02-02 04:39:04 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @jtimberlake @pepsi Makes me even less likely to watch any of this.
959140787677204482 2018-02-01 19:05:58 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @StellaArtois Why guilt me into buying?  Besides, WSJ says SA not a big thing back home.
959139801994878976 2018-02-01 19:02:03 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Sen_JoeManchin what did he say that was untrue?
959123387552497665 2018-02-01 17:56:49 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson This is why Private School.
959123139597803520 2018-02-01 17:55:50 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @JVLast I think leading the children astray is a capital S sin.
959122727163645953 2018-02-01 17:54:12 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @MayorMeganBarry @Tennessean Is she a Dem?  Did she have a problem with the Nashville letter?  Probs.
959122337479184384 2018-02-01 17:52:39 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @TomiLahren @EWErickson @jbillinson I'd say that was probably flattering for him.
959122177093234688 2018-02-01 17:52:01 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz Crumbs!

958836063438557185 2018-01-31 22:55:06 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @StellaArtois Too bad it can't stand on its own.
958823826451771392 2018-01-31 22:06:28 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @jonathanvswan @ALEX33016 Ha.  Good one. Trump's done more for the poor in the last 12 months!
958823549942292482 2018-01-31 22:05:23 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @MayaTPrabhu @jonathanvswan @Phwji I guess he ticks both gender boxes.....
958823396283961344 2018-01-31 22:04:46 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @jonathanvswan @shahwan_sandy From their manses.  I believe it's called inoculation.
958823202259718144 2018-01-31 22:04:00 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @jonathanvswan @DreamwalkerWC Is that something on ......

958822312555540481 2018-01-31 22:00:28 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @jonathanvswan Just need a neck brace and a scuba diver with the car prop and it would feel like old times!
958821706847653888 2018-01-31 21:58:03 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @agileforall Scum Master?  Did Hillary Clinton on get a new job?
958821298209255425 2018-01-31 21:56:26 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @washingtonpost All you need in the studio was a neck brace and scuba diver along with the car and it would feel like old times.
958821045061943296 2018-01-31 21:55:25 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Can we pay their plane ticket there?
958820900660502529 2018-01-31 21:54:51 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @dcexaminer @JMODERATE Hmm.... Virtual sex.  You belong at Haverford.
958455528505708545 2018-01-30 21:42:59 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @mitchellvii Sounds juicy.  Hoping for insurrection.
958455361727598592 2018-01-30 21:42:20 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @sahouraxo Right?  The question:. Has the USA ever interfered in a foreign election?
958454932826443776 2018-01-30 21:40:37 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @nytimes Why would I want the NYT spin on anything?
958454654232342528 2018-01-30 21:39:31 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @chefjoseandres you are a whining ninny.  Back over the wall.
958413141402009600 2018-01-30 18:54:34 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Olympics @intel Break a leg, Lindsey!
958412387316531201 2018-01-30 18:51:34 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @ccpecknold Appropriately described as "just a fetus", no doubt.
958406730391711749 2018-01-30 18:29:05 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Sarah_Cundy What lessons did you not learn from the book?
958405498822328320 2018-01-30 18:24:11 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Comey You ruined the FBI.  Just sayin'.

958153587850383360 2018-01-29 01:43:11 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @jaketapper Poor FBI.  They used to have integrity.  So sad.
958153100317134848 2018-01-29 01:41:15 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @NBCOlympics Break a leg, Lindsey!
958152989843382272 2018-01-29 01:40:49 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @JohnnyGWeir Will you cry, like on Chopped?  You really ruin the experience.

958041560683343874 2018-01-29 18:18:02 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Outkick @ClayTravis What's happening in Minneapolis?
958040747361611777 2018-01-29 18:14:48 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @JudgeJeanine @EWErickson @KFILE Clinton still not the Pres.  Another good day.
958038915595857920 2018-01-29 18:07:31 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EricHolder  has done long term damage to our institutions.
956933543250325504 2018-01-26 16:55:10 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @Variety What a total hag.
956933427902763010 2018-01-26 16:54:42 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ByronYork @Tullycast So you would ignore?
956922508099358720 2018-01-26 16:11:19 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @Variety Life is officially not worth living now.  We all need to get down with the struggle.  Get woke.  Whatever.
956922262275416064 2018-01-26 16:10:20 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis No black players?
956922034025566208 2018-01-26 16:09:26 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @BofA_News @MyrteLECTRONICS Did you pay your mortgage?  Asking for a friend.
956921855021146112 2018-01-26 16:08:43 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @BofA_News @bostonsfavson Sorry-their ONLY responsibility is to their shareholders.
956921602754654210 2018-01-26 16:07:43 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @BofA_News I think your answer now is always Gender Equality.  No?
956921419987869697 2018-01-26 16:06:59 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ddale8 Done.  Anything else?  Now quit whining.
956920236799877120 2018-01-26 16:02:17 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson My prob is when Dems get back in, as they eventually will, do they tear down wall and undo all the changes?  That would be horrible.
956919882712600576 2018-01-26 16:00:53 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Outkick @ClayTravis Racist.  Misogynistic.  Etc., Etc.
956919574502440963 2018-01-26 15:59:39 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Accenture Isn't the answer now always Gender Equality?  Joking, of course.
956918980027011073 2018-01-26 15:57:18 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @JoeManchinWV Why don't you back the REINS Act?
956600243180642305 2018-01-25 18:50:45 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @KatTimpf @NRO Can they provide a cyanide cocktail to the patients to help them relax?

956599220928241664 2018-01-25 18:46:41 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Boycott.  Thanks.
956599089004728320 2018-01-25 18:46:10 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @jpodhoretz They'll certainly wonder how America won WW 2.
956598814827216897 2018-01-25 18:45:04 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson That ship has sailed.  He was the best worst choice.
956598642806312960 2018-01-25 18:44:23 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Why?  I'm not electing a pastor in chief, correct?  And immigration affects me a lot more than who he "allegedly" screwed.
956597701432545281 2018-01-25 18:40:39 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @BofA_News No.  And please drop it.
956334088658522114 2018-01-24 01:13:09 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @axios Winning.

956333396178939905 2018-01-24 01:10:24 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @HalesCornersFan @PeterSweden7 I would imagine this enhances his qualifications for MSM.
956333139864977408 2018-01-24 01:09:23 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @NoahCRothman Remember when libs hated big government and FBI, justice, etc?  What happened.
956332317831725057 2018-01-24 01:06:07 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @markknoller Too haggy to pull it off.  Is this to get resistance eyeballs?
956332073173778433 2018-01-24 01:05:08 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson How does one do that when the FBI won't respond to subpeonas?
956240227441487872 2018-01-24 19:00:10 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @donlemon @EWErickson @rmom65 Just cry.

956238621908008960 2018-01-24 18:53:48 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @realDonaldTrump @nihonmama @NYCMayor @bret_jensen @ebarteldes They blow up schools and school buses like the Palestinians?  Do tell.
956238253270630400 2018-01-24 18:52:20 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @realDonaldTrump @NYCMayor Yeah.  You basically suck.
956230861401227265 2018-01-24 18:22:57 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @POTUS @BofA_News @duchessrose08 Yawn....how many females has he hired in critical positions?  Or perhaps they're not your kind of females.
956230465870065665 2018-01-24 18:21:23 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @BofA_News @Shitibott1 As it should be.
956229847801647104 2018-01-24 18:18:56 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @BofA_News Gee, I thought protecting my money as a depositor and making me money as a shareholder would be top of mind.
956229370112364545 2018-01-24 18:17:02 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @HashtagGriswold Like the massive redoing of the tax code during the eight Bush years?
956228963113807872 2018-01-24 18:15:25 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @NolteNC Pope has no credibility or legitimacy after his "who am I to judge" and "Trump's not a Christian" comments.
956227760539820039 2018-01-24 18:10:38 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @Timodc FBI has been very bad at many things the past few years.....
956226870030340096 2018-01-24 18:07:06 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @NFL @FoxBusiness @AZmEx1can @LuckeyDean @jckrsmile @Ofortunecookie Yeah, too bad madame Curie didn't have a woman's movement supporting her.  She could have done great things.  Oh, wait....
956226484154314753 2018-01-24 18:05:34 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @NFL @FoxBusiness @AZmEx1can @LuckeyDean @Ofortunecookie Just pointing out that you and they are idiots.  That's all.
956226147272089601 2018-01-24 18:04:13 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @jaketapper Simple:. Asking, not ordering.
956225983023140865 2018-01-24 18:03:34 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson There is absolutely no chance of that.  No comparison between staff now and staff even 20 yrs ago.  The lib/socialist virus is everywhere.
955902268464910337 2018-01-23 20:37:15 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @MrJoshPerry You must do vat ve tell you to do.  Sieg heil!
955875612983521281 2018-01-23 18:51:20 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Of course.  The director is described as "visionary".
955875297471102977 2018-01-23 18:50:04 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Alyssa_Milano Ummm, that's why I live in one of those states.
955875135872958465 2018-01-23 18:49:26 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Alyssa_Milano And then someone said "Alyssa Milano" and everyone laughed.
955874487748235266 2018-01-23 18:46:51 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @YGLvoices @KPMG Perhaps all the KPMG folks indicted? That one?
955873965548982272 2018-01-23 18:44:47 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @conor64 @jayteeyou Yes, yes we do.
955873728604393473 2018-01-23 18:43:50 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @conor64 Why should we bend over backwards for the parents sins?  Hold the parents responsible for breaking the law.  This is just a Democrat Party voter enhancement scam.
955873266736025600 2018-01-23 18:42:00 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @MarkDice I know when the commercial tells me the director is "visionary", it means the pic is crap and I won't understand it.
955872532254556161 2018-01-23 18:39:05 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @jpodhoretz Me either.  It's not the brokenness, it's the design of the brokenness.
955872272941805570 2018-01-23 18:38:03 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Winning.
955578319881363457 2018-01-22 23:09:59 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @FortuneMagazine @Prudential @kalamarides Just means if you use Pru, you're paying too much for insurance.
955577735082139648 2018-01-22 23:07:40 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @LegInsurrection Wait...equality?  Or are we "righting past wrongs"?  Will they be real women and not accept the extra time?
955576998969200640 2018-01-22 23:04:44 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ChrisBHaynes @six45ci @KnicksCentral @MrBarron91 Leashes?  Why, that's a racist dog whistle if I ever heard one.  Sad!
955576740570652672 2018-01-22 23:03:43 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ChrisBHaynes Racism! Racism! Racism!  Squawk!
955479171396001792 2018-01-22 16:36:01 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Outkick @ClayTravis @FoxSportsRadio I hated the Pats and Brady until they got on the wrong side of Goodell.  Then I started rooting for them. I hate nothing more than ol' Rog.
955459804851507202 2018-01-22 15:19:03 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @exjon And somehow he's made it onto the premier league broadcast.  What a f'in tool.
955459449128398848 2018-01-22 15:17:38 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @AmirSariaslan Thanks, Uncle Chuck!
955459163085266946 2018-01-22 15:16:30 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> I just voted #ProTrumpProLifethe President has kept his promise to protect the unborn! http://tylt.it/1CRNdyhttps://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce54ao62b/57esx
955458935808561152 2018-01-22 15:15:36 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ComfortablySmug Even my Gen Z kids hate those commercials....
955457855754264577 2018-01-22 15:11:19 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson I'm going to have to stop recommending the Resurgent.  Too many questions about it's leadership.
954876904250671105 2018-01-20 00:42:49 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @JudgeJeanine @Biddy702858 @tonna_flatt @lozf85 @WarmGingerTea Yes, sleeping on her daughter's apartment must be soooo taxing.   Take tsk.
954876723665006592 2018-01-20 00:42:06 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @JudgeJeanine @Biddy702858 @tonna_flatt @lozf85 Same character as who, Hills?  She has less than zero character.
954875450601410560 2018-01-20 00:37:02 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Oprah @cheddar Gross.  Disgusting.  Cheesy.
954875268031762432 2018-01-20 00:36:19 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @SecretaryZinke @POTUS @RepMarkMeadows Will anyone visiting said parks be shamed by Dems because they couldn't visit during the Obama shutdown?
954874862765510656 2018-01-20 00:34:42 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @SonnyBunch Still looks horrible.  Won't see.
954874740409237505 2018-01-20 00:34:13 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @obianuju Why would anything these days surprise you.  Seriously.
954874409982070789 2018-01-20 00:32:54 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @baseballcrank Nope.
954873890571980800 2018-01-20 00:30:50 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @BillKristol And the harm done to the swamp.  Ooops, sorry!  Not sorry.
954873211069632514 2018-01-20 00:28:08 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ByronYork @tedcruz @Brendajurgens3 He'll get heap wampum from me again.
954873053871247360 2018-01-20 00:27:31 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @tedcruz Do it California, just do it.  Ha ha.
954872588462886912 2018-01-20 00:25:40 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @JaguarUSA Unlike my '60s E-Type, coupe much better looking than convertible.
954872257985249281 2018-01-20 00:24:21 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Didn't the Dems 'splain to us during the Clinton era that we had a Commander in Chief not a Pastor in Chief?
954485331503575042 2018-01-19 22:46:51 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @BillKristol Depends on if they are legal.  Hard to have a country when you have no borders.
954484424057479168 2018-01-19 22:43:14 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @chucktodd @ShaunNorton 60 votes, man.

954483727845023750 2018-01-19 22:40:28 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @chucktodd Why get your panties in a wad, Chuck?
954483578661998593 2018-01-19 22:39:53 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @chucktodd So what happens when gov shuts down?  Gov workers get a vacation, get paid back pay eventually, and teat suckers still get chks.
954008555392327681 2018-01-18 15:12:18 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Outkick @ClayTravis @FoxSportsRadio @andrewdvonch But saints would have won.
953761935937466369 2018-01-17 22:52:20 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @womensmediacntr Hopefully not.  Should be given for outstanding performances.  No quotas please.
953761692877578241 2018-01-17 22:51:22 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Phantom_Thread This looks horrible.  Possibly as bad as world's greatest showman.  Is that possible?
953403309284569094 2018-01-16 23:07:16 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @drmoore Send all back.  No families torn apart.  Simple fix.
953403122675867648 2018-01-16 23:06:32 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @andrewtwalk So send everyone back.  No family ripped apart.  False premise.
953402934104088579 2018-01-16 23:05:47 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson ....but wins.
952993939115663361 2018-01-15 20:00:35 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @thegarance Assuming it happened this way, an off-point question.  Does anyone care about, say, herpes or other diseases anymore?  Asking for a friend.
952910988982013952 2018-01-15 14:30:58 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> One good thing about Emily K. Day-clear across town I'm under 30 minutes.  Normally takes 1.5 hours.
952907747846164480 2018-01-15 14:18:05 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @MorganStanley Please enjoy your electric cars.  Just don't take away my big V8.
952906940291698688 2018-01-15 14:14:53 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis @thurman84 Trying to make up for his poor positioning.  Bad judgment either way.  Cut him.
952906420885782528 2018-01-15 14:12:49 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis I would have cut him last night.
952905379985403906 2018-01-15 14:08:41 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @joem135 What would Oslama know about the truth?
952905231125434368 2018-01-15 14:08:05 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson So David Perdue is a liar?
952359179750133766 2018-01-13 01:58:17 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EvilKirbySmart @SLhamrick888 Aloha, bitches!
952358681726812160 2018-01-13 01:56:18 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @dandarling What language are you speaking.  Yes, there are people there.  So?
952357439348895744 2018-01-13 01:51:22 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @TheTylt Not sure figures are accurate, but how many automobile deaths?  Ban those first, as they are not constitutionally protected.
952314499817754625 2018-01-13 23:00:44 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @NutzFordBucks Democrat state.  Figures.
952205221165457409 2018-01-13 15:46:30 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EsotericCD Imagine the good he can do in 8 years.  And yes, I'm serious.
952191385272242176 2018-01-13 14:51:31 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @JVLast Agreed.  The media is always the enemy.
952191210277437442 2018-01-13 14:50:50 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @FrankLuntz Because they wanted to leave their shithole countries.
952191057923624960 2018-01-13 14:50:13 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @FrankLuntz Key:. From.  Not in.  Dumb comment.
952190878780715009 2018-01-13 14:49:31 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @BillKristol And why are they here?  Because they wanted to leave their respective shithole countries.
952190604460609541 2018-01-13 14:48:25 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @jrobb20 @ClayTravis @Brandon_SV @Bigkahunasports I believe Bill Clinton did.
952190429642084352 2018-01-13 14:47:43 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis Do you want to move to Haiti?  Do you want to move to Nigeria?  No?  Why not?  Because they are shithole countries.
952189969061335041 2018-01-13 14:45:54 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @RealPeerReview Food is racist, who'd a thunk it?

951578192405585920 2018-01-11 22:14:55 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @chelseahandler But can they spell and put a sentence together?
951577715840372738 2018-01-11 22:13:01 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ChuckLane1 Yeah, but he's a very bright and stable liberal.

950820548027863040 2018-01-09 20:04:18 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ugaalumniassoc Apparently, not enough heart.  And what heart was there has been ripped out again.  Priceless!  Roll Tide.

950524379426734080 2018-01-08 00:27:26 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @BovadaLV @OddsShark How about number of times ESPN shows a protest sign?
950522307256160256 2018-01-08 00:19:12 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @nytimes Read Peggy Noonan's review of the many errors.
950521919698362370 2018-01-08 00:17:40 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis @JasonJperry10 Wasn't too bad until they peeled back the foreskin.

950521327676510209 2018-01-08 00:15:19 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis It was a clusterf*ck at the Peach bowl too.  Stood 45 minutes in 19 degree weather.  Felt like 6 with wind chill.  I don't get it.  It's brand new.  No contingency planning?  No planning at all?
950520408289218561 2018-01-08 00:11:39 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Oprah @davidaxelrod Well, you're right about one thing.

950516070036713472 2018-01-08 23:54:25 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @entylawyer @orangetabbycats Goes along with basic immorality and not respecting women.  Seems a common theme.
950515687562399745 2018-01-08 23:52:54 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @entylawyer Have to agree with you on this one.

949797798874148865 2018-01-06 00:20:16 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @steph93065 Yes, but we won't have fake news CNN on our side, nor every movie, sitcom, song, etc.  That strategy can never work in the face of such universal desire for debauchery.
949796087602319361 2018-01-06 00:13:28 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @SouthernKeeks C'mon, now.  It's not a baby, it's a right.  Amirite?

949679459703185409 2018-01-06 16:30:02 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson So smart the Dems are absolutely terrified of him.
948956335340695553 2018-01-04 16:36:35 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @SenCoryGardner @strobist @RalfusJ Says the sycophant of our lord and savior Barack Obama.

948684623315374080 2018-01-03 22:36:54 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @cnnbrk @epicbeard85 Or me.
948684139015888896 2018-01-03 22:34:59 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @cnnbrk Could make them either way.
948683557639196672 2018-01-03 22:32:40 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @cnnbrk No, me.  Ordered by Trump.
948683342500761600 2018-01-03 22:31:49 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @cnnbrk Hills finally snapped.....
948212333582667776 2018-01-02 15:20:11 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @SaintRPh Ah.....what passes for journalism/reporting today.....
948212076379627520 2018-01-02 15:19:10 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @BillKristol Or we could do what our lord and savior Obama did-nothing.  He seems to be pretty popular among the Twitter set.....
948211638108327936 2018-01-02 15:17:26 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @RealPeerReview Seems perfectly appropriate for me to encourage his demise when he encourages mine. Especially in an atheistic culture.

947484432268709888 2017-12-31 15:07:46 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @RealPeerReview Yay!
947484246368751617 2017-12-31 15:07:02 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis Really-never saw that side of him at UGA.  Too bad-maybe he'd still be there.

947265886787919872 2017-12-30 00:39:21 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @tedcruz As my son said while having dinner at CNN Center, "the only thing real here is the beer".

946852873895366658 2017-12-29 21:18:11 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Evildrcatfish @PsychScientists Singling out because she's a female.  Sexist on the face, and misogynistic as you imply that because she's a female, she can't handle it.  I'm shocked, shocked I tell you.
946852262474862592 2017-12-29 21:15:45 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Benjamin_Poore Never understood the delete your account thing.   Like someone would say, "yeah, you're right, I will."
946851750715252736 2017-12-29 21:13:43 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Benjamin_Poore Must be painful.....
946851359286026240 2017-12-29 21:12:10 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @LeahIsWild It was cute.
946834205371174912 2017-12-29 20:04:00 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Evildrcatfish @PsychScientists Too sensitive.  I'd be laughing.
946830336079597568 2017-12-29 19:48:38 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Evildrcatfish @PsychScientists How horribly sexist and misogynistic of you.  Tsk tsk.

946779996743438336 2017-12-29 16:28:36 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @YahooNews Believe it when I see it.  Basically an organ of the DNC.
946779808255631360 2017-12-29 16:27:51 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson But does the USPS know if it's making money?  Taxpayers subsidize to the tune of $5-$8 billion (with a B) each year.

946140814547222530 2017-12-27 22:08:43 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @GallupNews Sort of explains the mess......
946139786103975936 2017-12-27 22:04:38 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @jennafischer No, you're a lib who is eager to spread falsehoods.  Have you retracted anything nice you've said in this regard due to misinfo?

944960972577533952 2017-12-24 16:00:27 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @MorganStanley @TheRealVSky May I interest you in some tulip bulbs?
944960257763217409 2017-12-24 15:57:36 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @MorganStanley Because I want to maximize returns.  Great argument for not using a "professional" advisor.
944959307866664960 2017-12-24 15:53:50 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Greenpeace @RFPvGP Everything.  Everything.

944625968093827072 2017-12-23 17:49:15 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @rachelheldevans @betterwhirled But there in fact are many absolutes where there need to be.
944625452219600897 2017-12-23 17:47:12 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @rachelheldevans So we get to make it up as we go along?
943654042693177344 2017-12-20 01:27:10 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis @Jason_M_Elson News flash, Einstein, insurance markets have pretty well already collapsed, thanks to our Lord and savior Barack Obama.

943205476854063104 2017-12-19 19:44:44 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @roddreher @andrewtwalk @whitevangelical Done.

943193447250432001 2017-12-19 18:56:56 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson I actually think he's going home to die.
942842375273054209 2017-12-18 19:41:54 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Still not worth it.

942836450839748615 2017-12-18 19:18:21 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson That has to be your dumbest comment ever.  They don't even compare.
942797039318065153 2017-12-18 16:41:45 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson But he is correct.
942796321899073537 2017-12-18 16:38:54 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson No wonder  letting you go.  King of beating the dead horse.

937448275376041984 2017-12-03 22:27:40 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @patricktehan @takethepith Roads and police help all.  I could make the point that the wealthy probably shouldn't pay as much for police fire and schools as they under utilize these services.
937447959289090048 2017-12-03 22:26:25 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @patricktehan @takethepith We won't agree on what those are.

928696243924230146 2017-11-09 18:50:13 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @LoveLife201114 So it's all dependent on a tax credit?  Doesn't sound like a very strong conviction.
928696030228570112 2017-11-09 18:49:22 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Why is me paying for your adoption so important?

928676914386137088 2017-11-09 17:33:25 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @sahouraxo My question continues:. Has the US govt ever tried to influence a foreign election.  If the answer is yes........

928278297863221248 2017-11-08 15:09:27 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Let's face it- if Virginians would elect McAuliffe, they would elect the Devil himself.  No surprise here.

900189452588511232 2017-08-22 02:54:24 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Alyssa_Milano Personally.  With his bare hands. I was there.
900148892322459650 2017-08-22 00:13:14 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis C'Mon, this is a joke.  Isn't it?
900121813958709248 2017-08-22 22:25:38 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @josh_hammer @4everNeverTrump Nope it didn't
900109773890363392 2017-08-22 21:37:47 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @josh_hammer @4everNeverTrump Yes, by their African buddies that sold them into slavery....
900109483925491713 2017-08-22 21:36:38 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @josh_hammer @MsplcdAlaskan67 Probably in the village of the folks of the same race that sold them into slavery.  Yes, that's about right.
900109217788555269 2017-08-22 21:35:35 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @josh_hammer Time for that is over..these folks have been enslaved up until now and are finally tasting freedum.
900108911629434880 2017-08-22 21:34:22 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ChrisQueen @EWErickson @resurgent @Woodridge_Place Because they're not medical professionals, ie pediatricians.  Got it.
900105413789712388 2017-08-22 21:20:28 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ChrisQueen @EWErickson @resurgent @Woodridge_Place That means their views are different from yours?
900102914802417664 2017-08-22 21:10:32 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ChrisQueen @EWErickson @resurgent @Woodridge_Place An association of medical professionals isn't good enough?
900102603824128001 2017-08-22 21:09:18 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ChrisQueen @EWErickson @resurgent As we sink ever deeper into the abyss....
899726847046553601 2017-08-21 20:16:11 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @RealPeerReview Wait-no mention of transgender or queer studies.  So is this perhaps somewhat legitimate?
899448017933262848 2017-08-20 01:48:13 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @DukeU @EWErickson @SaintRPh And he was a slave owner and also used other people's slaves on his plantation.  Oops.
899446925136547840 2017-08-20 01:43:52 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis Actually, it had been in a secular decline as recently as 2011.  But you're not a CFA, are you?
898963905401298948 2017-08-19 17:44:31 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @Opus2360 Yes, but we are intent on tearing apart.  And that's ok.
898963745648586753 2017-08-19 17:43:53 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @WWSKBlog But a much better cause.
898963633597804544 2017-08-19 17:43:26 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @BW_Jones Good.
898963528467566592 2017-08-19 17:43:01 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Duke University is named after a slave owner and enlistee in the Confederate Navy.  Tear it down!
898899182433521664 2017-08-19 13:27:20 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @renebonillajr Those could coincide at some point in the arc.
898899031044354049 2017-08-19 13:26:44 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Bannon:s resume and accomplishments eclipse yours.  Just sayin':.
898655906052702208 2017-08-18 21:20:38 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @JackPosobiec @AlisonWolfMason I'm up for it.  We have the guns......
898653483477467136 2017-08-18 21:11:01 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @sarahlen1980 @RodPSterling She is allowed to only think one way?  Wow, at least you people are consistent...
898652996464107521 2017-08-18 21:09:05 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @420Defenders The bill was written by a Weiner.  What do you expect?
898652688627318784 2017-08-18 21:07:51 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson I'll test it.
898289582588010497 2017-08-17 21:05:00 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis Truth.  Admittedly hard to recognize these days.
898289289364197376 2017-08-17 21:03:50 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis @ACCRecruitingXP Oops.
898289068085313536 2017-08-17 21:02:57 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis Plagiarized as well.  Many problems.
898288820935729152 2017-08-17 21:01:58 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @nytimes Worth less than $0.

898288393427107840 2017-08-17 21:00:17 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @NPRnie @BarryLeBrock He should horsewhip him.  I'm happy to do.
898288218910580737 2017-08-17 20:59:35 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @NPRnie @zondrawilson I like him, am having fun, and would vote for him again.
898287965113262080 2017-08-17 20:58:34 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @BobCorker @SusanHoven @NPRnie @TomkinsMike Human rights protestors.  Nice try.  The real fascists and wanna be slaveowners.
898287671755161600 2017-08-17 20:57:24 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @NPRnie @SusanHoven He would win again today against Hillary.
898287402048815104 2017-08-17 20:56:20 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @NPRnie When we start letting Corker influence our conversation, it's the beginning of the end.
898286741123215360 2017-08-17 20:53:43 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @matthias_schatz What is alternative?
898286560982048768 2017-08-17 20:53:00 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson You are delusional.
898286439091372034 2017-08-17 20:52:31 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson So we give up?  Let the alt left have it?  I'm ok with that, but I have the means to escape.
898258048086573057 2017-08-17 18:59:42 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @jchillwills But he da pres and a b'aire.  And you?
898257814178713602 2017-08-17 18:58:46 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @turbocheetoh @mcredwood No, they speak to their audience, which is rapidly shrinking.
898257500931215360 2017-08-17 18:57:31 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @lawgirl That's what I say.  Forever and always.  Even after pressing the button.
898257330814427136 2017-08-17 18:56:51 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson The curse of having a spine and a will.  It is unusual in politics.
898257111372541953 2017-08-17 18:55:58 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @jaketapper Journos are funny.
898256591920562177 2017-08-17 18:53:54 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @politicalmath @LUKABUS89 That started with homosexual "marriage".  But you're probably good with that.
898256178399944704 2017-08-17 18:52:16 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @politicalmath BS.
898256128294965250 2017-08-17 18:52:04 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @politicalmath Yes, since when should we stand for truth?  Let's be spineless libs.
898255925299081216 2017-08-17 18:51:16 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @FinelyJ He's right.  That's how.
898255789160378373 2017-08-17 18:50:43 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @newsvandal Just like the Dems and the alt-left - the ends are all that counts.  I'm good with that.
898255450977615872 2017-08-17 18:49:22 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @JimbauxsJournal The one-third are spineless dweebs.  Toss 'em.
898255255238041600 2017-08-17 18:48:36 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Let's get rid of the inside the beltway Republicans.  I stand with Trump.  And you better watch it-he'll form a 3rd party and you are toast
897986891076820992 2017-08-16 01:02:13 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @JVLast @quantizedphoton If you are equating the Confederacy and Hitler, that explains the utter depravity of the alt-left.
897986526579048448 2017-08-16 01:00:46 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @JVLast @quantizedphoton You are delusional.

897986022939791360 2017-08-16 00:58:46 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @JVLast @Effross3 Did it at night because they are spineless cowards.
897985848632889346 2017-08-16 00:58:04 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @JVLast While you alt lefts ate destroying things, don't forget there's a Confederate section in Arlington - guess you'll be tipping tombstones.....
897979381292904449 2017-08-16 00:32:22 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis @jrobb20 Damn.  You're right.  Out it goes....oh, wait, already gone.

897952254463885312 2017-08-16 22:44:35 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @baseballcrank Abrams just lost any hope of higher statewide office in Georgia.  Good!
897951782957006849 2017-08-16 22:42:42 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Did you hear her mother speak?  Another total racist.  She had the nerve to say "all lives matter".  Why does she hate black people?
897951175127052288 2017-08-16 22:40:17 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @Oil_Guns_Merica Indeed.  Where is the corporate disavowal of black lives matter?
897922101843296256 2017-08-16 20:44:46 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @nytimes Not even worth free.
897921367345115137 2017-08-16 20:41:51 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Communism_Kills @publicorrupt No.  Canadians are sweet, immigrant accepting, socialized medicine loving peoples.  Can't be Nazi's.
897920806197485568 2017-08-16 20:39:37 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Communism_Kills Swedish Nazis are the worst.
897920544133320704 2017-08-16 20:38:34 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @Communism_Kills On top of being racists and misogynists?  Dang.
897920226469175296 2017-08-16 20:37:19 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Let's face it - the leftists are the modern day slaveowners.  Taking the fruit of a man's labor and giving it away.  At the barrel of a gun.
897919636590690305 2017-08-16 20:34:58 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @Amerita Damn he must hate his daughter and son-in-law!
897919476334608384 2017-08-16 20:34:20 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @KevINthe406 Their implicit support of leftists and antifa makes them complicit.  Clergy or not.
897919077364137986 2017-08-16 20:32:45 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @Estep @flaxponder He swore!  Clutch the pearls!

897918450621833216 2017-08-16 20:30:15 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @1JenNYC Fits.
897918386310717440 2017-08-16 20:30:00 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Why?  He spoke the truth.  He showed he had a spine.  He won't cave.  It's awesome. How can one man stand against a tsunami of fake news?
896927613410660352 2017-08-13 02:53:01 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ladygaga @verizon No.  Hell no.

896054778639273984 2017-08-11 17:04:41 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> Overheard today  "Can't believe what the country is coming to-this whole Google thing.  Can I send money to Noko?Do they like have a Venmo?"
896053944056651777 2017-08-11 17:01:22 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @planning_ahead Yeah, hate orgs that protect constitutional rights.  Aclu really bad.
895074266756132864 2017-08-08 00:08:29 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis Can't they just drop some weights on it and tip it into the ocean?  I think our honorable representative Hank Johnson can show them how.
895071942704848896 2017-08-08 23:59:15 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @_IRON60 I did it on Google and got about half and half...

895017353011965952 2017-08-08 20:22:20 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @AngelOvens I am.  He's a beast!
895017212733526016 2017-08-08 20:21:46 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @Fillinusername No, but he apparently spent a lot of time in them.....
895017090041696256 2017-08-08 20:21:17 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Cosmopolitan is a state of mind, not a zip code.  Or something like that.
895001269651349505 2017-08-08 19:18:25 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Outkick @ClayTravis You're restricting it to sports?
895000581760274434 2017-08-08 19:15:41 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @TerryCollege @EWErickson @universityofga Sounds like UGA is bullying the professor.  Time to burn down the campus.

894750747258101760 2017-08-07 02:42:56 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis The best way to prepare someone for the realities of life is to shield one from them as long as possible   Right.
894255745432256512 2017-08-06 17:55:58 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @MrSrsly @420Defenders Uh, yeah, that one.  Cry me a river.......
894251407334940672 2017-08-06 17:38:44 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Probably better than talking about him as if he were a deity, like the Obama sycophants...

892150602557521921 2017-07-31 22:30:53 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson I actually like.  Keeps it interesting.  And the media really doesn't know what to focus on.
892150199031910400 2017-07-31 22:29:17 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> Is @Lowes the worst store in the history of stores?  The Milledgeville one just may be.

891293697593270272 2017-07-29 13:45:51 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @Jacobatf Bukkshit.  100% acceptance and accommodation is their only goal.  And even then.....
891293205177782273 2017-07-29 13:43:54 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @DunkMob4ay Actually, yes.  But we digress.
891292927552573442 2017-07-29 13:42:48 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @BrianLandsman Wow-you have no clue-about anything.

891289679735267328 2017-07-29 13:29:53 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @eatbees ie, successful.
891289543126786048 2017-07-29 13:29:21 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson He is a total asshole.  And that's what's needed.
890243800022568963 2017-07-26 16:13:56 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @xychelsea Oh no.  Now you don't "got this".  Hallelujah!
889526795023900672 2017-07-24 16:44:49 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @nbbedi I suspect denying science and reality affects me in some way.
889526561707307008 2017-07-24 16:43:53 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @robmillernow No child molestors here yet.......
887759685004275715 2017-07-19 19:42:57 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson I think it's simpler.  Children out of wedlock demonstrates poor decision making.  That trait continues throughout life.

886981825406611457 2017-07-17 16:12:01 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @chocolateluv44 Good luck.
886981693244137472 2017-07-17 16:11:29 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Dumbest comment ever.
886981573555490818 2017-07-17 16:11:01 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Delta only pushing back because it's @AnnCoulter   if it were a BLMer, you'd be giving them a plane...
886719350044078080 2017-07-16 22:49:02 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @Corbinclark87 @AubreyHolloman Yes yes yes.
886719077540139009 2017-07-16 22:47:57 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson The Word is the Word.  Don't follow if you don't want to.

885661934196068354 2017-07-13 00:47:14 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson It's always hate when you don't agree with them.
885661521099063297 2017-07-13 00:45:36 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Exactly what I was thinking.  YAUAS
884926263110111232 2017-07-11 00:03:56 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @NYDNHarper   just still butthurtin', and the women wouldn't take the bait.  Guess you'd rather have the rapist enabler.....

884919570557018112 2017-07-11 23:37:21 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @thehill Well if it's cartoonish things they're after, they're choosing wrongly.
884919306332626944 2017-07-11 23:36:18 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Man, Judgment Day is going to be a tough wake up call.
884918910105026561 2017-07-11 23:34:43 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @RipperMD41 Including murderers, rapists, child molesters.  You did say everybody.
884917813265281024 2017-07-11 23:30:22 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @ClayTravis Even if you try, they sneer at you.  So why bother?

884859889276866561 2017-07-11 19:40:12 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @BankwithFred Nor 1776.  Your point?
884859593456848896 2017-07-11 19:39:01 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @hausfrausystems @EWErickson @djjohnso Um,, more fake news.
884859277575430145 2017-07-11 19:37:46 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @shewrick No, just illustrating the investigative hypocrisy.
884859126513360896 2017-07-11 19:37:10 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @GlennWiens But was trying to be.
884859006317154304 2017-07-11 19:36:41 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson And why is that?  They are simply disingenuous as hell.
884502593011056642 2017-07-10 20:00:26 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @HalesCornersFan @AriFleischer They all probably deserve to die anyway.  Seems GB is pretty cavalier on the life issues..
884500693670916096 2017-07-10 19:52:53 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @Tex2WestSeattle Yes but the joke is on you.

881897130083860480 2017-07-03 15:27:15 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @AndyRichter Why?  It's just having fun.  Try changing your tampon.
881710594251829249 2017-07-02 03:06:01 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @TGC We can do two things at once.
881709130888601605 2017-07-02 03:00:12 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @TGC @rikardo_ojeda Amen.
881708958737506304 2017-07-02 02:59:31 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @TGC So let's just redo the Bible and only have Christ's words.  Don't include those of Paul, whom he personally chose to spread the Gospel.
880969668277567488 2017-06-30 02:01:51 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @streiffredstate @FrPaulKammen So when the Pope says the Church is good with homosexuality will you follow back?  That is coming, you know.
880969121038454785 2017-06-30 01:59:40 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @streiffredstate Unfortunately this may be the first of many previous non-negotiables to fall under this Pope.
880968029995008000 2017-06-30 01:55:20 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @GOP @susavestheworld @nancypantsy Yes!

878402720641814529 2017-06-23 00:01:43 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @albravob Not a well thought out comment.
878337797739905026 2017-06-23 19:43:44 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @AlexNBCNews @AndrewRedlawsk Just stayed your platform clearly: more taxes more spending open borders abortion accept homosexuality open borders men in women's rr.

878335271300890624 2017-06-23 19:33:42 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @wyethwire Nor does higher education.  Many people produce milk.  Perhaps you could make your own EpiPen?
878334762133356544 2017-06-23 19:31:40 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @SInow If this is how the libprogs want to spend their time, have at it.

878052722947248128 2017-06-22 00:50:57 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @thermop57 Just one more.
876956598161297408 2017-06-19 00:15:20 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @drmoore You have no credibility.
876954389487001601 2017-06-19 00:06:34 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @benshapiro Is there a cure for Dunhamism, aka child molestation?
876830917058326529 2017-06-19 15:55:56 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Dems still claiming Bush's fault?  Or fully moved on to Trump?
876156871958253568 2017-06-17 19:17:31 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson So, do we break bread with those who condone murder?  With those that tell us our religion is wrong?  Those who would tax us in2 slavery?
876155468988731392 2017-06-17 19:11:56 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson I believe that is known as cutting off your nose to spite your face.
876154254268018688 2017-06-17 19:07:07 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Yet, there are many who will believe them.  And we wonder how anyone would be naive enough to believe the Antichrist.

876129681141108736 2017-06-17 17:29:28 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson As you said, more balls than our emasculated Georgia legislators.  Don't mess with Texas.
876129207763337216 2017-06-17 17:27:35 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @brhodes I find it amazing that liberals will condemn so many people to misery simply to have beachrs, rum and importantly, cigars.
876128610750525440 2017-06-17 17:25:13 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @TedNugent @SopanDeb @StuartEtc But not so well.  Can't even pull off a decent massacre.  Demlibs are truly, totally inept.
876126586071678977 2017-06-17 17:17:10 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson @djgiglio No, it fits like a glove.  Ladies.  Lambskin.

760572106484682753 2016-08-02 20:24:55 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @vanillaice You gotta watch the board, man.
760571565645889536 2016-08-02 20:22:46 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson it's also by definition lesser.

759847453407514624 2016-07-31 20:25:24 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Peter_Wehner @EWErickson You're mistaking sadistic cruelty for fighting back.  Understandable since you haven't seen the latter much.
759846870810263552 2016-07-31 20:23:05 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @NolteNC @HalesCornersFan Amen.  Fair game now.
759846631445565440 2016-07-31 20:22:08 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @JonahNRO @EWErickson if I ever minded being lied to by politicians I would have left the fight years ago.....
759367326085046274 2016-07-30 12:37:33 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson says opposes trump no matter how bad Hillary is.  Decries same attitude in trump supporters.
759102254284668928 2016-07-29 19:04:15 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @LeonHWolf @EWErickson Gary Johnson is a doofus.  Get a credible candidate.

757623533270884352 2016-07-25 17:08:20 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @presjpolk @EWErickson yes, because Estonia is the strategic linchpin.  How many times has Estonia been mentioned in the past year?
757623058488320000 2016-07-25 17:06:27 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @Nike @purelypoetry What's a "fair"wage when your default wage is $0?
757280950300573697 2016-07-24 18:27:02 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson fine.
757279932011520000 2016-07-24 18:23:00 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> Keeping out terrorists is not who we are as a country
756118251680129024 2016-07-21 13:26:53 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @stephenasmith   Stick to sports.  You are at least marginally acceptable in that realm.
755584723267702784 2016-07-19 02:06:50 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @matt_manry @EWErickson Too late.  You won't get another SCOTUS pick for 20 years.......
755411058441854978 2016-07-19 14:36:45 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> #NeverTrump delegates remind me of the high school star athlete that life passed by.  Lives for the rec league game every week.
755050536483762176 2016-07-18 14:44:10 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @MattWalshBlog So, one must always offer a solution concurrently when noting a problem?  Tough standard.
753786972968103936 2016-07-14 03:03:13 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> Figures it would be a truck as no more points can be accumulated in the Ramadan Bombathon.......

747227873971478529 2016-06-26 00:39:42 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> I thought I'd seen the worst Democrat Party hacks.  Then I saw Robby Mook.  Good lord, what a tool.
746460483243368448 2016-06-24 21:50:22 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> Not saying the EU is overbearing, but they did pass a law stating only certain bottles could be used to hold olive oil on restaurant tables

742824083990163459 2016-06-14 21:00:37 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson Guess he won't be recruited by the JDF anytime soon.  Not that I'm implying anything......

742820003712491521 2016-06-14 20:44:24 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson every time he speaks I'm confused about who I am and what country I live in.

740237392720896000 2016-06-07 17:42:02 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @matthewjdowd @EWErickson is what he said racist?  Any more than a wise latina would render a better decision?
739864182632382464 2016-06-06 16:59:01 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @wesbury Amen.  Short recession, if one, small price to pay for freedom.

732645410779586560 2016-05-17 18:54:12 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson au contraire.  The country is lost.  Might as well make the total collapse, which is imminent, as entertaining as possible.
732618280763031553 2016-05-17 17:06:24 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @cenkuygur   you're a jerk, that's why you got kicked off.

730768149344333824 2016-05-12 14:34:38 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @amandacarpenter I would wear those protests/ors as a badge of honor.  Hell, interview a few of them.  That should seal the deal.

730376123952058368 2016-05-11 12:36:52 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @SamLachman he disgusts me too, but I am still voting for him.  As did McCain, and I voted for him.
730047188047437824 2016-05-10 14:49:47 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson So I tried to review and Target asks for my sex-and only gives 2 choices.  How can I xpress my sex/gndr with M/F?  Wtf!!!!!
730043502185357313 2016-05-10 14:35:09 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @EWErickson might as well be proper and precede with "Der".  As in Der Kommisar, Der Fhrer, etc.
728945539975397376 2016-05-07 13:52:14 UTC <AbortionBarbie1> @stephenfhayes @EWErickson I know what I'm getting with one-and it's very bad.  The other is a grab bag-perhaps it will be good.  Maybe not.
