969413656671916032 2018-03-01 03:26:41 UTC <DAGerlaw> @MikeCChandler @2naOnWhite @Justsaytruth18 Exactly!!  It Takes Two to Tango in this case!  Those women weren't "victims" of @realDonaldTrump .
969412403522883584 2018-03-01 03:21:42 UTC <DAGerlaw> @realDonaldTrump @MikeCChandler @2naOnWhite .".. They let you do it."  Everybody ignores that part.  It Takes Two to Tango -- those women "let him" do it because he was a star.

956366399026421760 2018-01-24 03:21:32 UTC <DAGerlaw> @FoxNews Yes, we saw this interview, too, Marc, and were practically yelling the same thing you tweeted!  Gads, that was maddening... For the life of me, I can't understand why they think the way they do.  I can hear you now.... They don't think!  They feeeeeeellll...
955974392705703936 2018-01-23 01:23:51 UTC <DAGerlaw> So very glad to have seen you, @NeilDiamond, in concert in Houston in July 2017.  As always, you thrilled us with your  magnificent voice, beautiful songs, electric presence.  Who could ever ask for more?  You are very loved! God Bless and Keep You! #NeilDiamond #Parkinsons

951636881141370880 2018-01-11 02:08:07 UTC <DAGerlaw> @BarackObama @FoxNews So... do they also give President Bush credit for creating the conditions under which President Obama killed Osama bin Ladin?  Nope.
951635715988869125 2018-01-11 02:03:29 UTC <DAGerlaw> @thehill President Trump says what everybody thinks but won't say... He's fearless!

823178822191370240 2017-01-22 14:41:39 UTC <DAGerlaw> @Madonna Madonna didn't sound very loving to me.  I am a 'different' woman -- different point of view.    #womensmarchDC @madonna
786576451348865024 2016-10-13 14:36:54 UTC <DAGerlaw> @ChrisPlanteShow @realDonaldTrump.  Trump  said he tried and FAILED!  A real predator/rapist would have kept going...
