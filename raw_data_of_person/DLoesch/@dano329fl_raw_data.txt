897973262151495681 2017-08-16 00:08:03 UTC <dano329fl> @realDonaldTrump @DTrumpExposed @AHamiltonSpirit That is BS!!!

897971432860332032 2017-08-16 00:00:47 UTC <dano329fl> @CoolMark72 You know what I think?  All these problems that Trump has is magnified 10 x negative by the Liberal Media. People start to believe it as tru
897889485794496512 2017-08-16 18:35:10 UTC <dano329fl> @shurevoice Don't listen to Juan Williams , another Liberal hypocrite. Obama was great in his eyes .
897888679355613186 2017-08-16 18:31:57 UTC <dano329fl> @CoolMark72 You can have Hillary....an egomaniac that thinks she is above the law .... I will take Trump over her anytime.
897887904533499904 2017-08-16 18:28:53 UTC <dano329fl> @annepearl1 Bullshit
894951224935677952 2017-08-08 15:59:34 UTC <dano329fl> @BillOReilly I don't believe that is true . Actually if marijuana was legalized nationally, I believe that opioid use would go down.
890025087805607936 2017-07-25 01:44:51 UTC <dano329fl> @TheFive @kimguilfoyle Hey Kimberly , Sessions is part of the old Swamp and his anti marijuana views are old way of thinking. He never should have been picked
890013340352872449 2017-07-25 00:58:10 UTC <dano329fl> @TuckerCarlson She should step down... too much time... she has lost contact with reality.
890012836847648768 2017-07-25 00:56:10 UTC <dano329fl> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Hey Tuck , I am a Trump supporter... however when they find out I am an Atheist... they think I am weird.
889422734618497024 2017-07-24 09:51:19 UTC <dano329fl> @TuckerCarlson I think Sessions was a bad pick for AG from the very beginning.
884566278354161665 2017-07-10 00:13:29 UTC <dano329fl> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson The Western Culture is way better than the East
884565906118017026 2017-07-10 00:12:01 UTC <dano329fl> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson That guy you had on was such an asshole .... he didn't make sense

860651637987258369 2017-05-05 00:25:15 UTC <dano329fl> @TuckerCarlson I disagree with you arguing with the Atheist woman. That phrase on that bench was awful. I can't believe u don't see that.

826574302510190594 2017-01-31 23:34:05 UTC <dano329fl> @oreillyfactor Why did Hitler hate the Jews? Why do people hate them today ... Land? Nobody has ever given me a good answer.
826393840831574017 2017-01-31 11:36:59 UTC <dano329fl> @ericbolling I love when you argue with Juan .... you make him look ridiculous and the Left
