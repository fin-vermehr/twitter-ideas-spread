970741261912158208 2018-03-05 19:22:06 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> I happen to use my Ar-15 to prepare my special cole slaw recipe. Blasting cabbage gives it a special flavor that I just can't get with a normal shredder. You liberals will never take away my cole slaw.
970740026987425792 2018-03-05 19:17:12 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> @NRATV @ScottPorch @DLoesch You misspelled 'pogrom.'
970739221299322880 2018-03-05 19:14:00 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> I hate abortion. It takes away another potential mass shooting victim, and those help my gun lobby donors sell more guns.https://twitter.com/DLoesch/status/970736112040927233
970452203658981378 2018-03-04 00:13:30 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> It's not that I don't care about children. I just really love big guns more.
970451673524121601 2018-03-04 00:11:23 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> @HoarseWisperer When I go low, I'm usually high.
970373432255840256 2018-03-04 19:00:29 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> My right to a silencer is more important than your right to hear the bullet that kills you. #NRA
970373258817294337 2018-03-04 18:59:48 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> The #NRA is here to protect children. By making sure they never make it to adulthood.
970373067817078784 2018-03-04 18:59:02 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> @NRA @thehill @Keoniana I am @BushmasterBarbi and I approve this message.
970346293469040642 2018-03-04 17:12:39 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> I wan't everybody to know that the #NRA is here to protect your rights. And by 'everybody' I mean gun manufacturers. Seriously, fuck the rest of you losers.
970005086482190336 2018-03-03 18:36:49 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> @NRA @BillOReilly @BraylenNapier @DianeLong22 It's a slippery slope because you're so slimy!!
970004891610607621 2018-03-03 18:36:02 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> @NRA @BillOReilly Exactly. Too bad you couldn't get an #NRA discount on that sexual harassment settlement!! Not fair!!
970004533635092480 2018-03-03 18:34:37 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> I like my coffee like I like my heart. Cold and bitter.https://twitter.com/DLoesch/status/969999933288927232
969983091900116994 2018-03-03 17:09:25 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> I like to hunt with my AR-15 because is saves me having to ground up the meat later.
969981389394366464 2018-03-03 17:02:39 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> Very disappointed to learn that a #BombCyclone does not contain any actual bombs.
969981134149947392 2018-03-03 17:01:38 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> My heart is a high capacity magazine full of blanks.
969980180482658304 2018-03-03 16:57:51 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> I'd like to thank the Academy.....https://twitter.com/Keoniana/status/969277287664312320
968296354605871104 2018-02-26 01:26:55 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> I once had a soul but I traded it for a bump stock. #NRABloodMoney
968296230513242112 2018-02-26 01:26:26 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> I call my cooter the 'Polar vortex.'
968296106357678080 2018-02-26 01:25:56 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> Gun's don't kill people. My laser beam eyes kill people.
968295792443314176 2018-02-26 01:24:41 UTC <BushmasterBarbi> If you'd ever seen my husband's penis, you'd understand why I need a Bushmaster. #BushmasterBarbie #NRA
