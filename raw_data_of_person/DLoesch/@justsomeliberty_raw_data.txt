966875674727342081 2018-02-22 03:21:39 UTC <justsomeliberty> Government officials visited the shooters home 39 times.

964553698620919808 2018-02-16 17:34:56 UTC <justsomeliberty> @timedsteele "assault rifle" implies select fire, intermediate cartridge, and a detachable box magazine. Considering the "evil" AR-15 fits two on the three necessary criteria, it is not an assault rifle.

964131400277544960 2018-02-15 13:36:53 UTC <justsomeliberty> If you look at the numbers, we don't have a gun violence problem. But if you only watch the media coverage, then we do. Go out and be good to each other. Befriend the friendless. Feed the hungry. Clothe the naked and cold. Defend life, liberty, and property.
964130910126985217 2018-02-15 13:34:56 UTC <justsomeliberty> Fewer people die per year at the hands of guns than at the hands of cars. And that's keeping the stats of gang and drug related violence (which is around 50% of homicides), which can be almost completely avoided as long as you don't live in a bad neighborhood.
964130256343982081 2018-02-15 13:32:20 UTC <justsomeliberty> If I accept that premise, let's do a comparison. There are roughly 270M cars in the US, so less numerous than firearms. Yet somehow, cars end up killing 37k people per year. That's triple the number of guns violence, with fewer cars.
964129330174611456 2018-02-15 13:28:39 UTC <justsomeliberty> Of those 34k, 60% are suicides, leaving around 13k to actual "gun violence". That is around .004% of the population. "But JSL, guns were designed to kill! They serve no other purpose!" (Continued...)
964128545395142656 2018-02-15 13:25:32 UTC <justsomeliberty> Do we have a gun violence problem in this country? If you watch the news, it would appear that we do. Until you crunch some numbers. With 370M+ guns and 310M+ people, there are 34k people that die at the hands of guns every year. (Continued...)

If we are to have a citizen militia, as prescribed by the 2A (of which every able bodied person is a member), the state of the art in weaponry is what we need to secure our liberties from enemies, both foreign and domestic.

963953994694619136 2018-02-14 01:51:56 UTC <justsomeliberty> @KaniJJackson @doncare2yrs @JTMarshIII ^pretty much only if it's a Sig P320 or an extremely old pistol that should be a safe queen. Even then, the gun doesnt go off by itself, it needs outside action (being dropped). You can just say you hate guns, that's okay.
963951401654194176 2018-02-14 01:41:38 UTC <justsomeliberty> @KaniJJackson @doncare2yrs @JTMarshIII Does where a death affect the death? No. Does how a death happen affect the death? No.  Asking how many cars were used to kill in a classroom is like asking how many guns killed people this year without a someone squeezing the trigger. It just doesn't happen.

963911240799195136 2018-02-14 23:02:03 UTC <justsomeliberty> The government picking the exact types of food for you is less economically efficient than the government handing you what is basically a check that allows you to purchase a wider range of food products.   In short, I'm against Trump's food stamp reform.
963910529445171202 2018-02-14 22:59:13 UTC <justsomeliberty> @KaniJJackson @GianakisAa @TomFerris97 I can walk freely knowing that I won't either. However, if someone decides they want to do me harm, I can defend myself. You have to rely on someone else. I'm okay with it as long as you are, frankly. Which is why I'm American and you're not, I suppose.
963909250698416128 2018-02-14 22:54:08 UTC <justsomeliberty> @KaniJJackson @GianakisAa @TomFerris97 The answer to your false dichotomy is both are important. With your mindset, I'm not surprised the UK handed over their great tradition of riflemanship.
963907573077495808 2018-02-14 22:47:28 UTC <justsomeliberty> @KaniJJackson @GianakisAa @TomFerris97 Setting aside the fact that confiscation wouldn't be legally allowed, how do you think it would go down in the US?
963906359015231489 2018-02-14 22:42:39 UTC <justsomeliberty> @KaniJJackson @GianakisAa @TomFerris97 Tom, that would end in lots of bloodshed. Yes, I know the UK did a similar thing back in the 90s, but the UK isn't the US. Firearms are basically in our blood.
963904691653545985 2018-02-14 22:36:01 UTC <justsomeliberty> @KaniJJackson @GianakisAa At least one was a school getting struck by a stray bullet. Which, to be honest, is still pretty bad, but it's not a school shooting.
963904383992893440 2018-02-14 22:34:48 UTC <justsomeliberty> @KaniJJackson What would you propose for gun control?
963902341979230208 2018-02-14 22:26:41 UTC <justsomeliberty> @adamcbest But it was already a gun free zone!
963901871906803713 2018-02-14 22:24:49 UTC <justsomeliberty> @TerryMcAuliffe "let's put politics aside and do politics."  I am so glad you're not my governor anymore.
963901654528659457 2018-02-14 22:23:57 UTC <justsomeliberty> @adamcbest Considering the NRA has supported every major gun control act in American history, I'm not sure you're pointing at the right group.
963900161373212673 2018-02-14 22:18:01 UTC <justsomeliberty> The people who are politicizing the tragedy in #Parkland today are the same people who were mad that @realDonaldTrump politicized the death of Edwin Jackson at the hands of an illegal immigrant.
962890240137580549 2018-02-11 03:24:57 UTC <justsomeliberty> @BuzzFeed So is objectification only okay when you do it, or is it only okay when the target is an example of "toxic masculinity"?
962889888940150785 2018-02-11 03:23:33 UTC <justsomeliberty> @BuzzFeed Imagine the headline going the other way. How outraged would the editors at BuzzFeed be?

954137906549067776 2018-01-18 23:46:18 UTC <justsomeliberty> @tide sorry you've been swept up in an idiotic internet meme.
953997694183313419 2018-01-18 14:29:09 UTC <justsomeliberty> @iowahawkblog Hampton Roads tried to bid for it, even though it has absolutely none of the requirements that Amazon set. Beautiful.
953996583556866049 2018-01-18 14:24:44 UTC <justsomeliberty> This is a clear violation of the NAP. I am permitted to retaliate. What to do, what to do...
953996320724996103 2018-01-18 14:23:41 UTC <justsomeliberty> Somebody is using essential oils in the office. It's all I can smell right now, over the coffee that is sitting next to me. Is this an act of office violence?
953069754511740928 2018-01-15 01:01:51 UTC <justsomeliberty> @maxplaining I agree with that. Except you and I actually believe in morals, unlike most participants in the aforementioned culture.
953068484728164353 2018-01-15 00:56:48 UTC <justsomeliberty> @maxplaining Until our culture of casual sex disappears, this type of thing is going to be a regular occurrence.
953067598899445760 2018-01-15 00:53:17 UTC <justsomeliberty> @maxplaining I'd still say this is a normal state of affairs in our hookup culture. As long as two groups consent to it, it doesn't bother me.
953067247161004033 2018-01-15 00:51:53 UTC <justsomeliberty> @maxplaining I'd say that pushing is very different than forcing. I wouldn't disagree that he probably treats objects like women, man, but this isn't sexual assault.
953064352633978880 2018-01-15 00:40:23 UTC <justsomeliberty> @maxplaining Creepy? Sure. Wrong? Not really, considering he didn't force her to do anything she didn't want to do, and when she wanted to leave he called her a cab.
953064157372403712 2018-01-15 00:39:36 UTC <justsomeliberty> @timedsteele I'd never leave you.

953054925159911424 2018-01-15 00:02:55 UTC <justsomeliberty> @maxplaining Both are accurate.

953036625088598016 2018-01-15 22:50:12 UTC <justsomeliberty> In light of #AzizAnsari and #MeToo, a few things could happen: 1) hook-up culture dies 2) men go back to paying hookers 3) men will begin to document every single sexual encounter with release forms and video.  Well, ladies, what do you want?

943685143872622595 2017-12-20 03:30:45 UTC <justsomeliberty> @NancyPelosi said something about the GOP Tax Bill doing violence to our Founders vision. I sort of agree. The idea that the government can tax  our income isn't in agreement with the Constitution as our Founders wrote it.

943558366403710976 2017-12-20 19:06:59 UTC <justsomeliberty> @ChrisCPandolfo To be frank, my governor said that 93 Million Americans a day die to gun violence a few months ago, so it ultimately won't matter much.

943527974145490944 2017-12-20 17:06:13 UTC <justsomeliberty> @JDIYFR Couple of things. Not mandating people have it =/= kicking people off. Also throwing a yuuge wrench in this, the theft bill isn't even law yet.
943527595676708864 2017-12-20 17:04:43 UTC <justsomeliberty> @1AEDWM I heard @benshapiro lost his brother to it.

943525795921907714 2017-12-20 16:57:34 UTC <justsomeliberty> Democrats: TRUMP IS LITERALLY HITLER AND MUST BE STOPPED. Also Democrats: TRUMP HAVING LESS MONEY TO DO THINGS IS BAD. Also Also Democrats: NOBODY BUT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS GUNS
943525383558885380 2017-12-20 16:55:55 UTC <justsomeliberty> @RandPaul You should read, from front to cover, Man, Economy, and State on the floor for your filibuster. Maybe someone will learn something.
943525166239363073 2017-12-20 16:55:04 UTC <justsomeliberty> @RandPaul @Rick_Ling1 Like taxes?
943524067944091648 2017-12-20 16:50:42 UTC <justsomeliberty> @ChrisJZullo It's just getting our corporate theft rates more in line with the average rate in Europe, which is around 19%.

943520332765417473 2017-12-20 16:35:51 UTC <justsomeliberty> @flippable_org I get to keep more of my money in my pocket, but it's somehow coming out of my pocket? I mean, taxes are theft and whatnot, but I fail to see how keeping money is bad
943519760922312704 2017-12-20 16:33:35 UTC <justsomeliberty> Liberals and progressives mad about the #GOPTaxScam: you can always "give" more to the government. Tax (theft) rates are a minimum. Time to put your money where your principles are. Or is that not how it works?
943456053521461248 2017-12-20 12:20:26 UTC <justsomeliberty> For example, there are tons of authoritarians on the right. McCain, Trump, McConnell...https://twitter.com/Timcast/status/943294205719441408

940268456481624065 2017-12-11 17:14:04 UTC <justsomeliberty> @AJEnglish Very good background on the racist past of gun control. I have only one complaint. Lyndon Baines Johnson was the president that signed the Gun Control Act of 1968, not Nixon. It was signed by LBJ in October 22, 1968, a few days before the '68 election.
940266936038051841 2017-12-11 17:08:01 UTC <justsomeliberty> I can get behind this idea.
