961735288304234497 2018-02-08 22:55:35 UTC <yyindx> Read the article.  Open Societies Foundation is actuall the exact opposite of what Gaspard says.  OSF supports the Deep State.  We, the people are too stupid to know what we want in government, their job is to tell us.  #DeepState #GeorgeSoros

961617370790834176 2018-02-08 15:07:01 UTC <yyindx> @DineshDSouza @FiveRights So glad to see a real investigation into this travesty.  The money the Clintons received for this act should be confiscated by the Feds to help pay for the Special Counsel that she created  #HRC #UranionOne
961615266776887297 2018-02-08 14:58:40 UTC <yyindx> Carter Page worked during the Clinton Admin in the 90s.  There's a reason that CP has not had to hire an attorney for any of his meetings with government and Congress.  He knows he won't be prosecuted  #CarterPage #RussianCollusion
961614576444833792 2018-02-08 14:55:55 UTC <yyindx> Perhaps Carter Page, in his role as UCE of FBI was told to get into Trump Campaign HQ's.  It seems odd that he was dropped as an UCE about the same time as he was dropped from the Trump campaign.  Then, FBI was able to get the FISA warrant to follow CP.  #carterpage

961258658226057223 2018-02-07 15:21:38 UTC <yyindx> @JudicialWatch What a waste of money, especially since Mueller's team is investigating the wrong people.  He should be investigating Russian collusion with HRC and DNC.  Not even sure the Russians were involved, only have word of Chris Steele in his bogus dossier

961257317592281089 2018-02-07 15:16:18 UTC <yyindx> @DiamondandSilk Not surprising.  McCain is another one who takes money from George Soros for his charitable organization.  Needs to follow Soros' party line

960695824408694784 2018-02-05 02:05:08 UTC <yyindx> #HillaryClinton #RussianCollusion  Is Hillary and her cronies being investagated for Russion Collusion?  Seems the wrong party is being investigated.  How about Hillary's closed door meeting with Putin when she was SOS, right before Bill got a $500,000 speaking engagement.
960693377376268288 2018-02-05 01:55:24 UTC <yyindx> #Russian Collusion  How many people from the USA go to Russia every year and does the FBI,CIA get FISA warrants for all of them
960692732028059648 2018-02-05 01:52:50 UTC <yyindx> @seanmdav Once HRC knew the "dossier" that her team created was in the pipeline, she started the Trump/Russian Collusion retoric in her campaign.
960692334823223297 2018-02-05 01:51:16 UTC <yyindx> @seanmdav Sounds like Cody Shearer and Clinton Campaign wrote the "2nd" dossier, which is probably the first dossier.  This was then given to Steele to embellish, then get the media to publish it.  Steele, through GPS Fusion, then gave the dossier to the FBI and Senator McCain.
