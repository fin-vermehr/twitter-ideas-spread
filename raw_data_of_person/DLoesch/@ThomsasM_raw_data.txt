970926685615931392 2018-03-05 07:38:55 UTC <ThomsasM> @Education4Libs I guess we should just order pizzas at home and stay inside? Lol. This is what we get for having a liberal mayor doing nothing to tackle the problems. When will the Federal Troops come over ?

969956111255093248 2018-03-03 15:22:12 UTC <ThomsasM> @Pink_About_it The Dems would be keen to visit there and take courses from the politicians over there.
969925797505986562 2018-03-03 13:21:45 UTC <ThomsasM> @irenerusso124 @LouDobbs This is not only about saving the American steel workers. It's finally getting our hands on the biggest security threat in our lifetime, China. China has been decimating not only the US, but all other nations in the world. The world should come together & fight against China
969923786123362306 2018-03-03 13:13:45 UTC <ThomsasM> @Technologyoffe4 What century are we've living in? America is the the most technologically developed country in the world. Of course we need to check massive voter fraud committed by the Dems and its supporters. Period!
969825821379588096 2018-03-02 06:44:28 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump If this continues, China will kill everyone in the steel industry. Then they will dominate and use steel as a leverage to advance communism. Free Trade creates winners/losers, but if a foreign communist regime plays unfair, the US should react. The world is not a textbook!
969825135678013440 2018-03-02 06:41:45 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump A lot of conservatives are resorting to "Ricardian" economics. But that assumes everything is perfect. The real world is not perfect. China is killing steel producers across the world because of unfair government subsidies/non-compliance of environmental/labor  standards

969226298072580096 2018-03-01 15:02:11 UTC <ThomsasM> @ChristiChat I agree with the list.
969225847486820352 2018-03-01 15:00:24 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump This is actually a very controversial topic. It will definetly help the steel/aluminum producers in the US. But most of the economists say it will hurt the companies, and therefore consumers of these products. I want this to be implemented to see how the theory plays out
968118833947881473 2018-02-26 13:41:31 UTC <ThomsasM> @AMike4761 Okay, I'm not saying Brexit is wrong or anything, and it may help their immigration issues if the Torries manage it well, but Brexit is just simply not good for their economy. UK has been a hub for continental Europe, but without free access, no need to use UK
967916372180189185 2018-02-25 00:17:00 UTC <ThomsasM> @Pink_About_it This tragic event is the biggest law enforcement failure in modern history. FBI and the sheriffs office dismissed calls. At the very moment when the sheriffs were supposed to do their only duty, they cowered behind.

967439488355000321 2018-02-24 16:42:02 UTC <ThomsasM> @AnnCoulter Bad things always have originated from the Dems. They wanted to continue slavery.

967435189537226753 2018-02-24 16:24:57 UTC <ThomsasM> @TheLastRefuge2 @ChristiChat This is shocking. Why isn't the media talking about this? This is a clear dereliction of duty. The media is colluding with these criminals to cover up the failed system and push their political agenda.

967281437266165760 2018-02-23 06:14:00 UTC <ThomsasM> @ChristiChat This is a massive dereliction of duty the likes of which we haven't seen before. It seems more than obvious that the authorities involved here must have to resign. Yet the Fake News Media keeps pin it on 2nd Amendment Rights. Rigged!

966759211341266944 2018-02-22 19:38:52 UTC <ThomsasM> @DCReporter_ This is called "backstabbing." President Trump has traveled around the world and won deals for you and this what you give the President in return? Disrespectful and Not cool.

966754420963733505 2018-02-22 19:19:50 UTC <ThomsasM> @ChristiChat The so-called "Broward County Solution" has been a complete disaster and directly led to the carnage. Whoever developed this program should be fired and sentenced to jail. They were deliberately lowering the bar to "make" lower arrests.

966736855826755584 2018-02-22 18:10:02 UTC <ThomsasM> @ChristiChat Excellent point. Yes, if the school pushed for it, they would've been accused of racial profiling, etc

966614460067561472 2018-02-22 10:03:40 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews Montenegro should be thankful for protecting the country from Russian influence instead of holding a grudge against the US president. Looks BAD!
966614094475231235 2018-02-22 10:02:13 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews I think this was a pathetic revenge against President Trump because he pushed the PM there.

966611671887224832 2018-02-22 09:52:36 UTC <ThomsasM> @POTUS @FoxNews Walter White, a veteran chemistry teacher, only earned 43,700 dollars a year. If the teachers are mandated to be the first responders, they can negotiate their salary up by at least 20k, and this will attract people who are of more quality.

966009862743183360 2018-02-20 18:01:13 UTC <ThomsasM> @ChristiChat This is not only true but also should've been the case long before! Very long overdue!
966009291990753280 2018-02-20 17:58:57 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump The fake news media is not even trying hard to make it sound real. I mean, as the president rightly pointed out, why would a man of such a stature kiss a stranger in public space at his own building?? 
965954966442557442 2018-02-20 14:23:05 UTC <ThomsasM> @ChristiChat He's a Russian bot
965947677442625536 2018-02-20 13:54:07 UTC <ThomsasM> @Pink_About_it Agreed. We shouldn't vote for a president based on diversity or inclusion reasons. We should vote for a president who's intelligent, patriotic, and can fix the liberal disease spread out in the country irrespective of gender. We only had President Trump.
965945989696638976 2018-02-20 13:47:25 UTC <ThomsasM> @benshapiro If we still have to choose I don't know why President Trump shouldn't be there along with other great presidents.

965944047264124929 2018-02-20 13:39:41 UTC <ThomsasM> @AMike4761 Hungary is a very beautiful country. Eastern Europe might be the only place where Western civilization is well preserved in Europe.

965661550546624512 2018-02-19 18:57:09 UTC <ThomsasM> @libbybrittain Not a supporter of LGBT in general (yes they their rights but just feel uncomfortable of the subject) and hijab, but their behavior is indeed petulant and egregious. SAD!
965657930325348352 2018-02-19 18:42:46 UTC <ThomsasM> @IngrahamAngle This is all good, and I respect Rubio for doing this, but a more fundamental approach would be to cap Chinese students enrollment on US universities. US universities should be only oepn to students coming from democratic nations and US allies
965655826630258689 2018-02-19 18:34:24 UTC <ThomsasM> @PeterSweden7 I think the NATO army should go to Sweden and look into the situation and take necessary actions to prevent crime and terror until things get stabilized. All of these do not make any sense for a country with 10 million population
965654720890073089 2018-02-19 18:30:01 UTC <ThomsasM> @PeterSweden7 I think Sweden is vomiting what they have swallowed but the liberal/globalist politicians over there are just putting their hands in the mouth to prevent vomit coming out, but you still see things spilling over your hands.
965649480103030784 2018-02-19 18:09:11 UTC <ThomsasM> @PeterSweden7 You know that things have gone badly wrong when Eastern European leaders become a beacon of European values
965648601362788352 2018-02-19 18:05:42 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump President Trump, thank you for the reminder and everybody strongly supports you, even the Dems/liberals who deep down admire you but won't admit.
965646379019264000 2018-02-19 17:56:52 UTC <ThomsasM> @milliebbrown Congratulations on your birthday. I look forward seeing you on the S3 of Stranger Things ! 
964323393561440256 2018-02-15 02:19:47 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump The Dems are using this tragedy as an excuse to advance their political agenda. Whenever there is a gun shooting, the Dems shout for more gun controls. Guess what? The States that have the most punitive gun controls have the highest homicide rate from guns! Shame on the Dems!
964164476713951232 2018-02-15 15:48:19 UTC <ThomsasM> @SheriffClarke @ChristiChat It's not the gun who pulls the trigger, it's the people.
963814899733348352 2018-02-14 16:39:13 UTC <ThomsasM> @PeterSweden7 What will be the title and where I can I watch it from? Will this be in English and if not will subtitles be available?
963813585829834753 2018-02-14 16:34:00 UTC <ThomsasM> @IngrahamAngle China's air pollution even reaches as far as California
963796251719360512 2018-02-14 15:25:07 UTC <ThomsasM> @therealcornett I hope a fast recovery. Take care.
963795205508890624 2018-02-14 15:20:58 UTC <ThomsasM> @JesseKellyDC I don't have a family that I need to take care of, but I am going to quit my job within the next two months to do an MBA. I'm 32, so still hesitant, but this thread has really inspired me. Thank you.
963740270067032064 2018-02-14 11:42:40 UTC <ThomsasM> @ChristiChat Don't be consumed by the unhinged liberals. They can't help themselves. You are a beautiful patriot! #MAGA!
962713199324704768 2018-02-11 15:41:27 UTC <ThomsasM> @benshapiro @bethanyshondark @DakotaBewl But overall I agree. America shouldn't feel obliged to take in massive refugees if North Korea suddenly collapses. South Korea is a relatively affluent nation, so they should take of it with some international help
962712124337176577 2018-02-11 15:37:11 UTC <ThomsasM> @benshapiro @bethanyshondark @Scarlet37319784 @DakotaBewl And it's a very different situation. America was founded on the notion of religious freedom and the people escaped from Europe because of religious persecution, but people are just starving to death in North Korea under severe dictatorship
962711254975463424 2018-02-11 15:33:44 UTC <ThomsasM> @benshapiro @bethanyshondark @DakotaBewl I get your point, but if you actually go to the link, it's about actually providing some donation money for the escapees who needs go to South Korea safely. China sends them back to North Korea if they get caught, and if they go back, they'll get executed.
962677926238892032 2018-02-11 13:21:17 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump It looks like the Dems are on fire . MAGA!
962677407743328256 2018-02-11 13:19:14 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Prime example of being all talk and no actions. While I am not for amnesty, The Dems should be ashamed of themselves.
962676972001243136 2018-02-11 13:17:30 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump In order to secure the border and prevent drugs pouring into the country, a Wall is a MUST! Also chain migration and lottery systems needs to end. Dems won't agree because of the fewer votes they'd have
962428287908589569 2018-02-10 20:49:19 UTC <ThomsasM> @FortuneMagazine @jramo how can a country achieve economic success when most of the nation's resources were looted and its labor were conscripted and its women were used as sex labor in war camps?
961989828987437057 2018-02-09 15:47:02 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump President Trump will go down as the most respected president in the history of the US
961979523293048832 2018-02-09 15:06:05 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Obama was the most divisive president ever in the US history
959844160638402561 2018-02-03 17:40:55 UTC <ThomsasM> @V_of_Europe Greece is already struggling with their own economic hardship.
959842024793849856 2018-02-03 17:32:26 UTC <ThomsasM> @PeterSweden7 Number one and three are not mutually exclusive. It's both fake and a attempted coup by the Dems
959839864156864513 2018-02-03 17:23:51 UTC <ThomsasM> @PeterSweden7 The mother and daughter look like really nice people. Hope they don't find themselves in a difficult situation
959839511512473601 2018-02-03 17:22:27 UTC <ThomsasM> @PeterSweden7 @uptheante99 Agreed. Doesn't look natural at all. Europeans are way too liberal.
959838682352988160 2018-02-03 17:19:09 UTC <ThomsasM> @PeterSweden7 @classiclib3ral I had a conversation with a former Swedish colleague, and he said that he's very concerned about the immigration/refugees policies in his nation. Sweden used to be a very homogenous nation and is not used to multiculturalism.
959837917240700928 2018-02-03 17:16:07 UTC <ThomsasM> @PeterSweden7 I think the educatuonal system in Europe indoctrinated people with liberal ideas that are toxic. We are seeing an informed democracy collapsing in Europe very fast. Sweden, like Paris and other once beautiful countries, is in a mess!
959836844530663424 2018-02-03 17:11:51 UTC <ThomsasM> @AmyMek This really breaks my heart. The liberal politicians in Europe have really ruined their countries by not enforcing laws strongly and accepting people with no documents too freely. Europe, the place of where modern civilization has started, is now in ruins because of politicians.
959833911189581824 2018-02-03 17:00:11 UTC <ThomsasM> @AnnCoulter What happened to the lady was a very tragic event and I send all my condolences who are in grieve for this incident. This event though actually has no relation to politics or race by the way. Some particular  African nations are just very dangerous
959832799925514241 2018-02-03 16:55:46 UTC <ThomsasM> @AnnCoulter @Octolight @Patriot27037659 @RealMikeDoss I'm a staunch Trump supporter but I'd have to agree with you on this.
959828685846069249 2018-02-03 16:39:26 UTC <ThomsasM> @AmyMek @steph93065 This is very true. The congress should work on this bill immediately!
959824178630176768 2018-02-03 16:21:31 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump #SOTU was indeed delivered in a powerful way and conveyed tremendous insights. It's only natural for the ratings to go up after such a powerful delivery. #MAGA !
959743261320491008 2018-02-03 10:59:59 UTC <ThomsasM> @V_of_Europe I first thought that that was a violin or some kind of a musical instrument. Damn. 2nd amendments for Europe!
959086080501866496 2018-02-01 15:28:35 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDailyWire Good article!
959081626222305280 2018-02-01 15:10:53 UTC <ThomsasM> @benshapiro Mika wins back some respect  after this session. I'll look  and see if she trashes the President again. #sotu
958927420190375937 2018-01-31 04:58:07 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump This was the best ever #SOTU address delivered by a US president. It was moving, optimistic, heart-touching, patriotic, thought provoking, and eloquent. #MAGA
958710847332732928 2018-01-31 14:37:32 UTC <ThomsasM> @onzetaal @caricevhouten Oh ja, The best ever SOTU by Donald J Trump spant de kroon. #SOTU
958032028888215552 2018-01-29 17:40:09 UTC <ThomsasM> @libbybrittain I guess it's all about cutting costs. The less work hours, the less paychecks. It may be a good thing because the federal agencies are basically bloated
958031198281908224 2018-01-29 17:36:51 UTC <ThomsasM> @Refinery29 @milliebbrown Millie, Trump supporters will always have your back. You're always safe.
957778682302537728 2018-01-28 00:53:27 UTC <ThomsasM> @PeterSweden7 Kings landing tends to be xenophobic
955679385364791297 2018-01-22 05:51:35 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump See you at the party Rictor!
955113045763608576 2018-01-21 16:21:09 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @SophieWinter15 Thanks for stating the exact reason for the march. I was scrolling down for answers  and all of them were hate posts and this was the only sensible answer. I think the president didn't really mean it though.
953631820494417920 2018-01-17 14:15:18 UTC <ThomsasM> @adrienneelrod If he took the right measures he wouldn't have been deported. What led him to live in America off the grid for 30 years?
953301207669358593 2018-01-16 16:21:34 UTC <ThomsasM> @AnnCoulter Ann, no. Blackrock largely a mutual fund and not a private equity firm. They don't benefit from carried interest loopholes. This applies hedge funds or PEs. Fink in fact advocated total dismantling of carried interest loophole.

952952333016612864 2018-01-15 17:15:15 UTC <ThomsasM> @milliebbrown Which scene is this? The sound doesn't seem to be the part where I was emotionally attached

952578528918216705 2018-01-14 16:29:54 UTC <ThomsasM> The people should know who's behind this.
952558500504264709 2018-01-14 15:10:18 UTC <ThomsasM> @Pink_About_it It always wonders me how she  has amassed such an amount of fortune by only being in politics

952336948349186048 2018-01-13 00:29:56 UTC <ThomsasM> @PeterSweden7 Your/EU globalist/liberal politicians have made the concept "country" utterly useless. You'll get more disappointed as time passes by. I think EU in general is a lost cause. Never fight for a lost cause. It's just a waste of time and efforts. If you value freedom try US
950788234883330049 2018-01-09 17:55:54 UTC <ThomsasM> @PeterSweden7 This is really sad.

But he shouldn't cut deals with the Dems on immigration policies and on the Wall. Also, widespread drug abuse and gangs, as well as everyday shootings in Chicago needs to be dealt with
947379972389273601 2017-12-31 08:12:41 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @bbusa617 @irenerusso124 Susan, I lived in Germany for 2 years recently, and it's true that German politicians and EU bureaucrats are creating tremendous problems in their own country by clinging to unfettered immigration policies. But  is relatively safer than the US.
947355156458254336 2017-12-30 06:34:04 UTC <ThomsasM> @AnnCoulter @pnehlen I understand where you're coming from, but this is another disaster caused by O which T has to deal with. Iranean deal was a disaster, but if we can get a regime change without military use  it would be good for all of us, and that's why the president is focusing on this cause.

947004505433939970 2017-12-29 07:20:43 UTC <ThomsasM> @PeterSweden7 And yet globalists like Teresa May and Merkel are in charge of shaping the course of the future in Europe. Sad.
946958368635154433 2017-12-29 04:17:23 UTC <ThomsasM> @libbybrittain We "give back" the emotional and financial support that we've received.

946773532003811329 2017-12-29 16:02:54 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @irenerusso124 @SheriffClarke It makes me chuckle how the media ran with the story and  deneounced the president on using that expression
946772487278182403 2017-12-29 15:58:45 UTC <ThomsasM> @GrrrGraphics @PeterSweden7 America was going to that direction under O, but thankfully we now have a president who cares about American lives and culture. MAGA!
946771889849958400 2017-12-29 15:56:23 UTC <ThomsasM> @Education4Libs Great analogy. But forgot about the phony audience who are paid by the Dems booing at Trump. These are the SJWs and Antifa guys.
946737172907884546 2017-12-29 13:38:26 UTC <ThomsasM> @realPolitiDiva Climate change is a hoax. It will be the coldest ever winter in the East coast!

946262670449115136 2017-12-27 06:12:56 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Great job president. But then this makes me wonder, why the hell didn't Obama do anything about this?
946236743052754944 2017-12-27 04:29:54 UTC <ThomsasM> @dcexaminer @jamiejmcintyre @realDonaldTrump President Trump will go down as the most respected president in the history of the United States - but to be fair, some help from Obama due to huge contrasting effects.
946233623459409920 2017-12-27 04:17:30 UTC <ThomsasM> @dcexaminer @jamiejmcintyre @realDonaldTrump Congratulations President, your dedication to the country and world peace is something we should be all thankful for. But then this  makes me wonder...what the hell was O doing?
946005126229082112 2017-12-27 13:09:32 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews What was O exactly doing ?
945891662127022080 2017-12-26 05:38:40 UTC <ThomsasM> @PressSec Thought this would take many, many years to get done based on O's comments. I gues that was just another deceit!
945597751961706496 2017-12-26 10:10:47 UTC <ThomsasM> @PaulBois39 @realDailyWire It's no secret SJWs are hypocrites.

944394291832426496 2017-12-22 02:28:39 UTC <ThomsasM> @Education4Libs With good luck in personal investments, and considering her age, I guess 2-3 million is doable but 29 million is indeed strange unless she had massive inheritance
944130885850300416 2017-12-22 09:01:58 UTC <ThomsasM> @Education4Libs Not a fan of Conway, but Nikk Haley is very competent. SS is okay

939357797145133056 2017-12-08 04:55:25 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump THE best president in the history of America. He's bringing back freedom and prosperity that was lost during the disastrous 8 years of Obama
938638614086348801 2017-12-06 05:17:39 UTC <ThomsasM> @Education4Libs I was just imagining Ben Shapiro being White House presss secratary. I think it'd be hilarious
937712444092309504 2017-12-04 15:57:23 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews @OHenryHernandez But the president didn't know that it would be this bad, right?
937712053828993024 2017-12-04 15:55:50 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews @OHenryHernandez Okay, I admit that this is  quite funny

936254756330151936 2017-11-30 15:25:03 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @JaydaBF President Trump neeeds governor intervene and save this innocent, brave woman's life.
936236473468063744 2017-11-30 14:12:24 UTC <ThomsasM> @RealAlexJones @PrisonPlanet By 2050
936235284768858112 2017-11-30 14:07:40 UTC <ThomsasM> @RealAlexJones @PrisonPlanet Based on Pew Research estimates, 30% of Sweden's population will be Muslims.
936200661066117120 2017-11-30 11:50:06 UTC <ThomsasM> @theresa_may @number10gov I don't think the PM of UK has any bad intentions like Hillary. I think she genuinely wants to serve her people. BUT you have to first secure home security and be strong on terrorism. I visited London last year and I was not impressed with the multicultural whatever you've built
936197791801421824 2017-11-30 11:38:41 UTC <ThomsasM> @theresa_may @realDonaldTrump @Waynelittlewood Little relevance? Second amendment is set in stone to protect its citizens from government tyranny. As long as there is government, second amendment right is needed
936103171658620928 2017-11-29 05:22:42 UTC <ThomsasM> @theresa_may @realDonaldTrump Only true friends tell the truth to each other.
936101385837322241 2017-11-29 05:15:36 UTC <ThomsasM> @theresa_may @realDonaldTrump And let's admit it. Europe is in a mess because of radical terrorism. Please wake up save your country from these preventable threats!
936100935729758208 2017-11-29 05:13:49 UTC <ThomsasM> @theresa_may @realDonaldTrump I think UK Should be thankful about the world leader's tweet. He's helping UK people's life because of the politicians unwillingness and denial against terrorism. I hope UK wakes up very soon before it find themselves with another attack. God bless America and UK!
935840087862009856 2017-11-29 11:57:18 UTC <ThomsasM> @sagaftraFOUND @milliebbrown @VikochkaT This is awesome
935838184260345857 2017-11-29 11:49:44 UTC <ThomsasM> @milliebbrown @UNICEF I endorse everything 11 and Trump supports. If 11 retweeted this, this must be a great cause.
935829150396440578 2017-11-29 11:13:50 UTC <ThomsasM> @Realjmannarino This is quite frightening. But it tells something about how the German people feel
935185833623031808 2017-11-27 16:37:32 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @Staceymoon52 Do you want America to be like the rest of the world? Do you want America want to be like Europe and have radical terrorists blow up streets? Things are gettig back to normal under Trump's presidency. Trump will go down as the most respected president in the history, I guarantee
935184914235801600 2017-11-27 16:33:53 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @Staceymoon52 Stacey, I understand how you feel, but you can't judge a book by its cover. Obama looked honorable and all that, but he was deliberately destroying America. Trump may not have the class you'd prefer, but he's straightening things up. MAGA!
935005537309036544 2017-11-26 04:41:06 UTC <ThomsasM> @pink_lady56 @RedNationRising Same with Hilary and Obama as well (if you look at the rate of growth for O)
934827156164698112 2017-11-26 16:52:16 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews This is America. While upholding the value of limited government and freedom, but Looking after each other when in need
934625776976084993 2017-11-25 03:32:04 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump That's quite true. CNN marketed themselves like the Goldman in finance when in fact they're more like the Lehmans in finance
934624996055384064 2017-11-25 03:28:58 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump EW made her career out of the crisis. Period. Then at least properly run the baby you created. What a disaster!
934455375037739013 2017-11-25 16:14:57 UTC <ThomsasM> @Lrihendry Lori, sorry, you are wrong. illegals should become part the American culture and assimilate. They should go back to where they come from. Legal immigrants should be Americanized
934454744797429760 2017-11-25 16:12:27 UTC <ThomsasM> @POTUS @irenerusso124 @perfectsliders The order should be Trump>Clinton=Bush>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Obama
934454271247912960 2017-11-25 16:10:34 UTC <ThomsasM> @JacobAWohl @JackPosobiec There are many conservative values as well. Cersei's plan of resorting to Iron Bank to buy mercenaries resembles Obama's disasterous Fed programs. The show will teach that the Dems' Fed was a disaster under 8 years of O
934065907114041344 2017-11-24 14:27:21 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump I'm not surprised. This is Obama's bad legacy.
934060756277936133 2017-11-24 14:06:52 UTC <ThomsasM> @LouDobbs MM looks like a turkey
933463748244733953 2017-11-22 22:34:35 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @Realjmannarino @Four_Paws_Sake That's the precise reason why the president got him out of prison in China in the first place. You're assuming the president did all of this to earn thanks. But think Amanda, there's something wrong when a father refuses to thank someone who got his child out of prison.
933373362700558337 2017-11-22 16:35:25 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @Realjmannarino This is just very well said. Yeah I'd thank Hillary too.
933371647255445504 2017-11-22 16:28:36 UTC <ThomsasM> @benshapiro @OwenBenjamin By making this an issue, Trump is trying to undermine the Chinese political system by letting the peasants there  realize that citizens are whom should be served. 2. He's trying teach a non-white, making it as an example that people should work together despite their differences
933369765460033536 2017-11-22 16:21:07 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump 1. Hilary would have never gone through the hassle herself. 2. Yet Trump gets no credit for what he's done. 3. FMSM keeps attacking Trump for phony reasons. Conclusion: So unfair and RIGGED!
933362417584685056 2017-11-22 15:51:56 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @Realjmannarino Clearly the best ever retweet from the president!
933002297805639680 2017-11-21 16:00:56 UTC <ThomsasM> @iowa_trump @axios Where did all of those high standards she held for Trump go???
932995903811489792 2017-11-21 15:35:32 UTC <ThomsasM> @IngrahamAngle Thought he was engaged in a sexual harassment. Stephen Colbert wouldn't in my view
932644698656669696 2017-11-20 16:19:58 UTC <ThomsasM> @benshapiro How dare you...how dare you...
932635507783213057 2017-11-20 15:43:27 UTC <ThomsasM> @IngrahamAngle @Eugenio69 Merkel got re-elected but she has failed to form a grand coalition. German media is saying it's worst political crisis in Germany. A large part has to do with unfettered immigration. Germans don't even like Merkel.
932635055289016321 2017-11-20 15:41:39 UTC <ThomsasM> @IngrahamAngle This should be true. May failed to gain majority in the most recent snap election. Merkel failed to form a coailition after her so-called victory recently. On the other hand, Trump is quietly restoring America to where it was. Those in Europe are killing Europe
932108400283942913 2017-11-18 04:48:55 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @piersmorgan It's a bit ironic that a lifelong orthodox republican would endorse a statement from a known liberal media person. This shows that the president is indeed a uniter!
932075763267801088 2017-11-18 02:39:13 UTC <ThomsasM> @Education4Libs This is true. But liberal mobs, radical Islamic terrorists, and immigrants who don't share American value (not all though) are undoing everything and is lowering the life quality in America.
932070222969712640 2017-11-18 02:17:12 UTC <ThomsasM> @SebGorka They indeed look like DREAMERs, who wants to descend America into a third world hell hole
932052738275291136 2017-11-18 01:07:44 UTC <ThomsasM> @IngrahamAngle This is so heartbreaking...
931794267466473472 2017-11-18 08:00:39 UTC <ThomsasM> Sorry, I think you meant @realDonaldTrumphttps://twitter.com/morningmika/status/931693962250858496
931790582632005632 2017-11-17 07:46:01 UTC <ThomsasM> @perfectsliders As much as I despise the establishment republicans, I can't say Moore is not guilty. There is just too much convincing evidence. He should quit the race and the Repbulcians should find another suitable candidate
931750950942867456 2017-11-17 05:08:32 UTC <ThomsasM> @judyjones232 After she realized that they she'd lose her whatever measly auidance base she had, she went on television again to show her crockodile tears only to walk back from her apology few days later.
931716933015126016 2017-11-17 02:53:21 UTC <ThomsasM> @peaceandjoy101 @Trump Keen to have one of those and wear it but afraid of radical  lefty lunatics
931716443204345856 2017-11-17 02:51:25 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Remember that obama's policies and inaction directly gave the gangs with machine guns, resulting in massive murders across the nation.
931418916756135936 2017-11-16 07:09:09 UTC <ThomsasM> @pink_lady56 @builditnow This shows that the president is a truly self-made guy and a person who feels no entitlement on anything, unlike the 8 years of horror show known as the disasterous Obama
931147957151264769 2017-11-16 13:12:27 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump This was very moving and touching actually
931013695576010752 2017-11-15 04:18:57 UTC <ThomsasM> @bradleyheath02 @Anish_Patel3107 I went to London last year and it wasn't at all what I had imagined.
930818341031198720 2017-11-15 15:22:40 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl As much as I despise Obama, to be fair, North Korean genocide was there even before Obama.
930817383685505025 2017-11-15 15:18:52 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Obama was the most ineffective president in the history of the United States
930817227632254976 2017-11-15 15:18:15 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump In stark contrast to your heroic victory over this, Obama did nothing to get Warmbier out of NoKo.
930814828922339330 2017-11-15 15:08:43 UTC <ThomsasM> @Gregtechelp @hrkbenowen I voted NO. They're illegally staying here and by giving amnesty you're sowing the seeds of more cases like this. Also, it's unfair to people who are waiting or has gone through the process LEGALLY
930812821750693888 2017-11-15 15:00:45 UTC <ThomsasM> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump President Trump has shown to the world that he is the only true great leader of the world. The world needs Trump's leadership and has to prevent future horror shows like Obama.
930731887089270785 2017-11-15 09:39:08 UTC <ThomsasM> @AmyMek America needs to stop any further Islamification
930591040498577408 2017-11-14 00:19:28 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Sir, you should disavow Roy Moore and replace him with other strong Republican candidate.
929606100520910848 2017-11-11 07:05:40 UTC <ThomsasM> @KelemenCari I mean Obama never even bothered to try.
929566645902721024 2017-11-11 04:28:53 UTC <ThomsasM> @TheDemocrats @GoldingBF @PeterSweden7 @kurtpfost Well I hear Spanish first when I call social security
929553683297083392 2017-11-11 03:37:23 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Why is this tweet not presidential? For me it's one of the most presidential tweets ever! Trump will win against NoKo!
929298523241062401 2017-11-11 10:43:28 UTC <ThomsasM> @AmyMek That's sad. But well it's Canada, not surprised after all...
928449852882558976 2017-11-08 02:31:09 UTC <ThomsasM> @pink_lady56 @IngrahamAngle It's sad that people who wants to immigrate to the States these days don't know what it really means to be an American - they won't vote for Dems otherwise
927935790096592901 2017-11-07 16:28:27 UTC <ThomsasM> @JacobAWohl Chinese GDP data are fake, not kidding
927917078610305024 2017-11-07 15:14:06 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews Stephen is a true hero
927852448252706816 2017-11-07 10:57:16 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet After 8 years, yes
927827045622546432 2017-11-07 09:16:20 UTC <ThomsasM> @irenerusso124 @AmyMek Okay to be fair (I lived in Germany for 2 years recently) I believe that should be an anomaly rather than a norm.
927477444923101184 2017-11-06 10:07:09 UTC <ThomsasM> @MarkDice It still would not have been a problem. The move still would have signaled his strong power against the other leader
927476199760072704 2017-11-06 10:02:12 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDailyWire Trump should dig up all the dirt associated with Obama, the worst and most corrupt president in the history of America
927447199947960320 2017-11-06 08:06:58 UTC <ThomsasM> Could've been paid. Need to check his/family's/friend's bank accounts
927421930616975360 2017-11-05 06:26:33 UTC <ThomsasM> @yashar Lots if people are missing the real message here. He's signalling that everything won't be hunky dory unless Japan levels the trade field
927416706334539776 2017-11-05 06:05:48 UTC <ThomsasM> @yashar @lintoinette @mrainie24 @ridiculoustimes It's SAD that liberals' last resort is calling someone with better arguments as bot. you can do better than that
927414607584550912 2017-11-05 05:57:27 UTC <ThomsasM> @yashar @lintoinette Don't exaggerate. This shouldn't be a material that needs to be politicized. This shows that he's a man of action!
927414261369860096 2017-11-05 05:56:05 UTC <ThomsasM> @yashar @lintoinette @mrainie24 It's called under budget/ahead of time. He doesnt have time to feedem several times. If anything, this shows his strong business shrewdness
927356278363406336 2017-11-05 02:05:40 UTC <ThomsasM> @SenWarren Lady Warren, who's behind Antifa? Who was behind violence behind Trump rallies in Chicago? Please...
927027123889496064 2017-11-04 04:17:44 UTC <ThomsasM> @JacobAWohl Although I'm a conservative, don't want to poliicize MLK's personal affairs and link it to politics. He did leave a mark on American society
926991872014262272 2017-11-04 01:57:39 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Thought this was going to London, May won't like this tweet.
926742441566224384 2017-11-04 09:26:30 UTC <ThomsasM> @irenerusso124 @247razz Very cute dear!
926737292571549696 2017-11-04 09:06:03 UTC <ThomsasM> @USSArizona @PacificCommand @realDonaldTrump Sir, don't give Asians military. That's the lesson learned from the Pharbor attack by the Japenese. They will never be a loyal banner man
926736430772076544 2017-11-04 09:02:37 UTC <ThomsasM> @benshapiro @realDailyWire Ben strongly roots for the success of Trump, even though Trump is not an orthodox republican from his view.
926735695187603456 2017-11-04 08:59:42 UTC <ThomsasM> @benshapiro @realDailyWire Obama bankrupted DNC and therefore couldn't endorse Biden, and instead endorsed corrupt Hillary who has donor money.
926733779271532544 2017-11-04 08:52:05 UTC <ThomsasM> @CatoInstitute In other words, ending up in the wrong hands
926690223446147072 2017-11-03 05:59:00 UTC <ThomsasM> @CatoInstitute That's not a "low" chance I mean
926690110195712002 2017-11-03 05:58:33 UTC <ThomsasM> @CatoInstitute That's not a chance. This is quite alarming
926689728828620800 2017-11-03 05:57:03 UTC <ThomsasM> @HillaryClinton Obama played the racial card and Hillary is playing the gender card. Trump will unite!
926596449047003137 2017-11-03 23:46:23 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump It's a shame that POTUS does not have veto power against these kind of BS. That guy and Obama should be locked up together in the same room
926595835344797696 2017-11-03 23:43:57 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @AnnCoulter Lottery system was the Dems idea to bring in indigenous European people into America before Europe became Islam
926594838153248770 2017-11-03 23:39:59 UTC <ThomsasM> @AnnCoulter Well said lady Coulter
926594311830958080 2017-11-03 23:37:53 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump I am a die hard Trump supporter but this incident was kinda funny
926593970628464642 2017-11-03 23:36:32 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Liked Warren when she was just sitting on a financial committee hitting WS. She started to lie to the public after becoming a politician
926593540230021120 2017-11-03 23:34:49 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump The Bernie supporters are with you sir. "We won't vote for Hillary!"
926593152265240576 2017-11-03 23:33:17 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Shows how Obama endorsed Taliban
926592989756997637 2017-11-03 23:32:38 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Don't forget the tremendous lives and costs that America had to suffer because of the Japenese sneak attack. Don't give them nukes or armies
926076632003100672 2017-11-02 13:20:49 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump All of his family members should be investigated to see if they were complicit
924575684936155137 2017-10-29 09:56:35 UTC <ThomsasM> @sassygayrepub All of this in large part due to Obama.
924567151519809537 2017-10-29 09:22:41 UTC <ThomsasM> @irenerusso124 @AmericanHotLips Illegal immigrants' rights...how can they have any legal rights when they are being illegal? Such an oxymoron!
924097575413616640 2017-10-27 02:16:45 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Lock all the Dems up! They were all complicit!
924096952127561728 2017-10-27 02:14:16 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump This is great stuff. Please also find all 30k HRC emails and release it. The Dems were all complicit in this Russian fraud
923874934262083585 2017-10-27 11:32:03 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Not might, must! Don't let the Dems tear down American heritage!
923341263759228928 2017-10-25 00:11:26 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Jeff Flake is a traitor and used the hard-working president as a scapegoat to cover up his low popularity
923340860707684353 2017-10-25 00:09:50 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump The longer he stays, the better for America. Communism/autocracy never works
922018009287290880 2017-10-22 08:33:18 UTC <ThomsasM> @pink_lady56 @crusher614 Obama created not only ISIS, but also identity politics.
921942520149434368 2017-10-21 03:33:20 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump The NAZI propoganda manager used to lie repeatedly until the public believed it. NYT modern day NAZI?? Yes!
921739064746713092 2017-10-21 14:04:52 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump JFK was my first home assignment when I was little. Interested to know whats in there
921596169981009920 2017-10-20 04:37:04 UTC <ThomsasM> @AnnCoulter Another case of liberal hypocracy.
919818020322545664 2017-10-15 06:51:20 UTC <ThomsasM> @pink_lady56 This is a no brainer right? Obama stirred up racial divide and systematically divided the nation.
919777619737903104 2017-10-15 04:10:47 UTC <ThomsasM> @AmyMek In a sense he's more hardline conservative than Trump. He doesn't use the term radical, thereby generalizing all Muslims as terrorists
919777037484564480 2017-10-15 04:08:29 UTC <ThomsasM> @AmyMek This is indeeed a tragedy. The globalist EU political hacks have been opening their borders way too wide. Need to stop.
918791954216902658 2017-10-13 10:54:06 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Just simply repeal & replace the disasterous OCare. Just start from a clean slate without tweaking the existing MESS!
917772420152410113 2017-10-10 15:22:51 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews Okay, i guess california is now advocating AIDS sex live matters.
917771306694672384 2017-10-10 15:18:25 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @GrrrGraphics @GOPPollAnalyst Obama clearly did nothing, but, to be fair, both the Dems & Republicans haven't done anything.
916865089939980288 2017-10-07 03:17:26 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Nuking NK makes sense if risking lives of 1mm in SK/Japan certainly is a better deal than a remote possibility of 1mm of American lives
915756690502381568 2017-10-04 01:53:03 UTC <ThomsasM> @VP @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @SportsWriterGuy @impeach_d_trump @AngelaBelcamino No, America deserves an "apology" from NBC... #FakeNBC
915166725661802496 2017-10-03 10:48:45 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews Not a good measure, just knee jerk reaction
915114017097621504 2017-10-03 07:19:18 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews Okay got it the evil passed down to his son.
914813237803155456 2017-10-02 11:24:06 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump This is Radical Islamic Terror. If people don't say the words we won't be able to solve it.
914680172837605376 2017-10-01 02:35:21 UTC <ThomsasM> @AnnCoulter Funny, we have two Trumps.
914672327509426176 2017-10-01 02:04:11 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @creature_dan Don't blame anyone on the list but Truman actually had the chance to prevent this - so yeah I blame Truman.
913454355369541632 2017-09-28 17:24:24 UTC <ThomsasM> @AmyMek China is a greater threat than Muslims.
909429175064260608 2017-09-17 14:49:46 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @Fuctupmind @katzoecat It's both cute and presidential. MAGA!
908548788523982848 2017-09-14 04:31:25 UTC <ThomsasM> @MarkDice Mike I listen to his podcast everyday - he didn't support anyone because HRC was corrupt, crappy and Trump didnt have conservative values
908333260165357568 2017-09-14 14:14:59 UTC <ThomsasM> @JackPosobiec Still bull. No DACA!
908319393133731840 2017-09-14 13:19:53 UTC <ThomsasM> @benshapiro @DPRK_News Haha, very ironic 
908314495520432128 2017-09-14 13:00:26 UTC <ThomsasM> @AnnCoulter Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Ann you seriously expect to get a wall after all of this? You're a naive person
908309875494498304 2017-09-14 12:42:04 UTC <ThomsasM> @AnnCoulter Ann, you should recall your books. You're biggest agenda was against illegal immigrants and you misled the readers by saying T would deliver
908308506570190849 2017-09-14 12:36:38 UTC <ThomsasM> @GerryCallahan @AnnCoulter @Blakmane @eckert1952 @slippydip @Gregtechelp Please don't argue with these people. You're right, no matter which circumstances the dreamers are in, they are illegally here.
908306517039841280 2017-09-14 12:28:43 UTC <ThomsasM> @AnnCoulter Trump was the last hope against illegal immigration and he brilliantly crashed conservatives' hopes. Sad day for America!
908303359282626560 2017-09-14 12:16:10 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump So what? They came to the country illegally!
908302403308445701 2017-09-14 12:12:23 UTC <ThomsasM> @pink_lady56 @MathisenScoot Giving amnesty to non-law abiding (they were illegal at the time they came to the country) activities incite more illegal immigration.
908300964024610816 2017-09-14 12:06:39 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump This is a very poorly structured political gambit that will alienate you from lots of your supporters. They came here illegally. Law &order?
908299585583378433 2017-09-14 12:01:11 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @CassandraRules @simplerell This is unfortunate but your parents still came here illegally and you have no legal rights. Your story should not excuse your legal status
908298559820148736 2017-09-14 11:57:06 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump This decision will incite more illegal immigrants coming into the country. Just sneak in and live for a while and become a US citizen!
907105106847342592 2017-09-10 04:54:45 UTC <ThomsasM> @AmyMek Never been to Australia, but  lived in Europe for a while and travelled across. Is AUS like continental EU or U.K?
905791554505261057 2017-09-07 13:55:10 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump These people illegally sneaked into the country. What are you waiting for? Why do we have to wait for six months? Deport them NOW!
905632000026992640 2017-09-06 03:21:09 UTC <ThomsasM> @iowa_trump With all due respect, you understand that pollutants generated from those filthy factories, etc in China blows to the West coast?
905273585538879489 2017-09-05 03:36:56 UTC <ThomsasM> @AmyMek Merkel is a globalist who was very close to Obama. They are destroying their soverienity and surrending their power to leftist globalists
904331696677388288 2017-09-03 13:14:12 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Truman should've let MacAruther nuke Chinese forces when they started to intervene in the war.
903979257369550848 2017-09-02 13:53:44 UTC <ThomsasM> @usedgov @POTUS @BetsyDeVosED How can anybody spew such nasty words to such a devoted secretary of Eduaction? Outrageous!
903978148030668800 2017-09-02 13:49:20 UTC <ThomsasM> @FLOTUS @POTUS @FoxNews FLOTUS us wearing high heels. What's gonna the fake media do about it this time? So fake!
903977605094752258 2017-09-02 13:47:10 UTC <ThomsasM> @steph93065 @winegirl73 @ChrisCoon4 @ChristieC733 @CalFreedomMom @phil200269 @carrieksada @SpecialKMB1969 @crusher614 @MichaelBerrySho @SandraTXAS This never would have happened under Obama. He always draws a artificial line based on race and incites divisiveness.Only possible for Trump
903976827588272128 2017-09-02 13:44:05 UTC <ThomsasM> @POTUS @FoxNews The most powerful and humane president in the history of the United States!
903976142247305217 2017-09-02 13:41:22 UTC <ThomsasM> @RealAlexJones When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. Ryan is not the type that would last long. Trump will win!
903797012260376577 2017-09-01 01:49:34 UTC <ThomsasM> @DailyCaller The thing is, Trump doesn't care about optics. He only speaks his mind and tells the truth. That's what true leaders do, like John Snow
903796720307290112 2017-09-01 01:48:24 UTC <ThomsasM> @FBI @DHSgov @iowa_trump @OBgynFl Okay at least at last.
903796408813182976 2017-09-01 01:47:10 UTC <ThomsasM> @iowa_trump @DevinSenaUI It's going to be a yet another busy week for Trump to clean this up. Hope nobody gets hurt.
903561731414269952 2017-09-01 10:14:38 UTC <ThomsasM> @CatoInstitute @humanprogress This is a good read
903397980115312640 2017-08-31 23:23:57 UTC <ThomsasM> @PrisonPlanet Very definition of fake
903393867105312771 2017-08-31 23:07:36 UTC <ThomsasM> @POTUS @FoxNews Unsure means he's doing good considering this politically divided environment caused by Obama
903203951238983680 2017-08-31 10:32:57 UTC <ThomsasM> @RealAssange This is not a good poll. Where's ANTIFA? Going for the best alternative, a former news network, CNN
902889205553971200 2017-08-30 13:42:16 UTC <ThomsasM> @pink_lady56 @RepStevenSmith Lock her up, lock her up, lock her up!
902887120951324672 2017-08-30 13:33:59 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Sir I think it's because it's good business to them. They want the eyeballs and ad revenue and nothing more. This is sad
902884837010300928 2017-08-30 13:24:54 UTC <ThomsasM> @pnehlen Paul Ryan is a media darling. He purpotedly has some conservative values, what good is it if you can't use them? All talk and no action!
902884545329979392 2017-08-30 13:23:45 UTC <ThomsasM> @DrMartyFox @LeahR77 @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @SandraTXAS @Lrihendry @bfraser747 @VoteTrumpPics @RightWingAngel @Corrynmb @mikandynothem Don't bother, the MSM and the Dems will trash Trump by stating whatever silly reason to undermine him.
902883982148157440 2017-08-30 13:21:30 UTC <ThomsasM> @BasedMonitored This is the most ridiculous reason I've heard to shut down investigation on treason
902883674172997633 2017-08-30 13:20:17 UTC <ThomsasM> @POTUS @PressSec This is indeed a huge morale boost.
902883339652042753 2017-08-30 13:18:57 UTC <ThomsasM> @POTUS @AriFleischer @FoxNews Chris Christie refused to show up during a snow storm in NJ
902882952194830338 2017-08-30 13:17:25 UTC <ThomsasM> @POTUS @FoxNews The US should not rule out military options. It would've been much better if Truman heeded McAruther's advise though
902865429193830401 2017-08-30 12:07:47 UTC <ThomsasM> @kathygriffin @iowa_trump @BasedMonitored And the Dems call Sir Trump a pathaelogical liar. Funny how things work.
902134208600014848 2017-08-28 11:42:10 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews It looks like the police force has been compromised. Perhaps should have to send federal troops to end this nonsense violence
902133755015397379 2017-08-28 11:40:22 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews This is serious stuff, yet CNN is running on the Nazi story all day long. Sad!
902131033952227329 2017-08-28 11:29:33 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews Perhaps a solution to Antifa
902129691607183360 2017-08-28 11:24:13 UTC <ThomsasM> @SpeakerRyan @AnnCoulter @MicroChunkyChip Where's th authority? Where's law and order? Does being a Dem excuse violence?
902129211464224769 2017-08-28 11:22:19 UTC <ThomsasM> @MediaBuzzFNC @HowardKurtz @FoxNews This doesn't look good. You have to choose a side - either your with Trump or not.
902128971063500800 2017-08-28 11:21:22 UTC <ThomsasM> @tedcruz @houstonpolice Chris Christie didn't we even go back to New Jersey during the snow storm. Ted Cruz is better!
902008815188566016 2017-08-27 03:23:54 UTC <ThomsasM> @AmandaPresto @realDailyWire Take back the country from the Dems
901627585217478657 2017-08-26 02:09:02 UTC <ThomsasM> @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @iowa_trump If the Dems are right about everything as they proclaim and Trump is a disaster, why are the Dems losing every single seat?
901623952379854849 2017-08-26 01:54:36 UTC <ThomsasM> @GrrrGraphics @StockMonsterUSA A big mistake by a smart guy. Should at least backtrack
901623502796492801 2017-08-26 01:52:49 UTC <ThomsasM> @RepDeSantis @FoxNews I hope nobody stabs Trump on the back this time like the disasterous OCare
901621700764196864 2017-08-26 01:45:39 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews Better advise Bannon to not turn against Trump. Brietbart has two factions - pro trump and pro bannon. Pro trump is the majority so be wise
901619769991847936 2017-08-26 01:37:59 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDailyWire Why isn't the media running on this story? Why is it that Trump always have to be vicsiously persecuted against the media alone?
901619269837832192 2017-08-26 01:35:59 UTC <ThomsasM> @POTUS @FoxNews Good luck with that. The left's hell-bent conviction that Obama was a good president led to today's mess.
901617345168195584 2017-08-26 01:28:20 UTC <ThomsasM> @CatoInstitute BOTH groups have to be investigated. Have to get to the bottom of it by tracking down the donors of each
901611525705654272 2017-08-26 01:05:13 UTC <ThomsasM> @HillaryClinton @ScottBaio @FoxNews Sir Trump won by a landslide. Why are we keep talking about the election? Why can't Hillary get over it?
901610165794783232 2017-08-26 00:59:49 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews Who's paying for this? Looks way too professional and well organized to be voluntary
901059143653400576 2017-08-25 12:30:15 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews Who's behind this guy? Stay out of other country's affairs!
901058784872747008 2017-08-25 12:28:49 UTC <ThomsasM> @pink_lady56 @WayneDupreeShow Who erected this? Didn't even know such thing was there. The only statue that needs to be removed!
901058428285534209 2017-08-25 12:27:24 UTC <ThomsasM> @pink_lady56 @MikeTokes Another proof that these ANTIFA guys are paid by a malicious group or individual. Should investigate ASAP!
901055530730311680 2017-08-25 12:15:53 UTC <ThomsasM> @POTUS @FoxNews This! Why is the media trying to make up the story like there's real conflicts in the WH? It's operating like a fine tuned machine!
901050248604270600 2017-08-25 11:54:54 UTC <ThomsasM> @CatoInstitute Because Westeros had kings virtue signaling everything and controlling people's lives. This what the Dems want. AVOID!
901049711565471744 2017-08-25 11:52:46 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxFriendsFirst @JoeBorelliNYC @FoxNews Removal of statutes and monuments are like stripping out texts from history book. Let people make their own judgment.
901048593016012800 2017-08-25 11:48:19 UTC <ThomsasM> @brookefoxnews @FoxNews Republicans have been crying out loud that they could destroy Ocare if they had majority. They have it now, but why hasn't  it gone?
901048038109532160 2017-08-25 11:46:07 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews What's the cops & VA doing? So slow in response. Rembmer, one of Trump's agenda is to reform VA to make veterans great again!
901047191329923072 2017-08-25 11:42:45 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Obama was a bad president because he undermined democratic values and divided the country. Trump is undoing Obama!
901045289179414528 2017-08-25 11:35:12 UTC <ThomsasM> @POTUS @FoxNews Republicans have proved that they have no leadership, especially MM and PR. The disasterous OCare should've been gone by now. Underwhelmed!
901044529746202625 2017-08-25 11:32:11 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews This is a witch hunt to intimidate the T. UNFAIR!
900698188004315136 2017-08-24 12:35:56 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @JerryTravone We need more of these kind of eclipses. MAGA!
900664517750702081 2017-08-24 10:22:09 UTC <ThomsasM> @POTUS @FoxNews Germany's penchant for globalism is not surprising. They're raking in billions due to the one-sided and unfair Euro system
900662489045651457 2017-08-24 10:14:05 UTC <ThomsasM> @HillaryClinton @FoxNews This shouldn't be a debate: Trump has better instincts; life wisdom; business prowess; dealmaking skills; policies; appeal; and ideas
900661286421135361 2017-08-24 10:09:18 UTC <ThomsasM> @charliekirk11 These so-called protestors are thugs and criminals. BAD dudes. They are PROFESSIONAL rioters. Find the source and hold them accountable!
900659094863794176 2017-08-24 10:00:36 UTC <ThomsasM> @POTUS @FoxNews Merkel doesn't know America, mind her own country. Merkel is intelligent but Trump has unparalleled wisdom. Trump isRIGHT & Merkel isWRONG!
900658098498437120 2017-08-24 09:56:38 UTC <ThomsasM> @POTUS @FoxNews Merkel's globalist policies are a disaster and Germany is becoming dangerous every second due to unfettered immigration
900657828888576000 2017-08-24 09:55:34 UTC <ThomsasM> @POTUS @FoxNews Merkel is one of the leaders of the free world, but Trump is the champion of the free world. Trump wins and is right!
900309560568578048 2017-08-23 10:51:40 UTC <ThomsasM> @AmyPolitakis @NewtTrump These are professional protesters paid by hate groups
900146012651638784 2017-08-22 00:01:47 UTC <ThomsasM> @AnnCoulter I've never seen Coulter condemning a white immigrant group. This tweet can potentially broaden her appeal
897765227239940096 2017-08-16 10:21:24 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Please investigate if antifa is paid by someone. At Trump rallies, professional protesters were employed and caused tremendous violence
897764361422471168 2017-08-16 10:17:58 UTC <ThomsasM> Antifa and altright are both repugnant groups. Violence should not be condoned or accepted in any circumstances
897718868680089602 2017-08-16 07:17:11 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews @peanutandsnow Agreed. Too old and too obvious
897102257237270528 2017-08-14 14:27:00 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxBusiness @FiatChrysler_NA @FoxNews Ban China from acquiring US companies. They will steal all the remaining technology and IPa that the US companies have
896600772313366528 2017-08-12 05:14:16 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Obama incited violence for his entire 8 years and it's sad that Sir Trump has to clean it all up with getting blames. Unite under Trump!
895844792638201861 2017-08-10 03:10:17 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Sir, I highly doubt 45% is accurate. It should be at least more than 60. Polls are mostly FAKE, but this one is closer to the truth at least
895600275158843392 2017-08-10 10:58:39 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump GOP leadership is a disaster. We need a new face. Replace Mitch McConnell and then repeal the disasterous OCare!
895285913047113728 2017-08-09 14:09:29 UTC <ThomsasM> @GrrrGraphics Le Pen should've won. Macron guy was disrespectfully laughing at Trump when he delivered the NATO speech and said members should pay up.Sad!
895284912420302848 2017-08-09 14:05:31 UTC <ThomsasM> @AmyMek Incredible. I was crossing the border from Spain to France taking a bus and nobody even bothered to look at my passport. Europe needs Trump!
894422890069622784 2017-08-06 05:00:09 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Sir appreciate your statement. A feud with Sessions is one of the last things we want
891485679678439426 2017-07-29 02:28:43 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @MissNyetTrump The era of the so-called "strategic pateience is over". like the disasterous Ocare O's NK policy was a disaster. T can only solve this. Win!
891484846584758273 2017-07-29 02:25:25 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @phillipbalayan @Dlstoke That's what makes him a true leader in this modern world. You don't want to reveal everything to your enemies. He'll lead everyone to Win!
889469262452072449 2017-07-24 12:56:12 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!
889469109473206272 2017-07-24 12:55:35 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Crying chuck finally conceded!
889468812361211905 2017-07-24 12:54:25 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Sir, I concur. We are saving DTS while strengthening our base. More works to be done. MAGA!
889376954301915137 2017-07-23 06:49:24 UTC <ThomsasM> @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Sir, you forgot to mention that you've achieved all of this with an understaffed WH. Under budget & ahead of time! MAGA!
888737199499259904 2017-07-22 12:27:14 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Simply just repeal it. Don't fall to the Dems' idiotic argument that people will lose health care. 92% was insured before disasterous Ocare
888055725129322496 2017-07-20 15:19:18 UTC <ThomsasM> @FoxNews We now have a president sitting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand. Repeal the disasterous Obamacare immediately !
888033549936246784 2017-07-20 13:51:11 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump John McCain is an American hero, just like you sir.
887653301273088000 2017-07-19 12:40:13 UTC <ThomsasM> @IBDeditorials @pink_lady56 @PeckPolitics The Dems will eventually come to president Trump and beg for help. It's imploding fast
887652222821060608 2017-07-19 12:35:56 UTC <ThomsasM> @AnnCoulter Read the whole story and this is indeed wiered
887648284709314560 2017-07-19 12:20:17 UTC <ThomsasM> We now have a president sitting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand waiting eagerly to sign the repeal of Obamacare! Make it happen!
887635097653886976 2017-07-19 11:27:53 UTC <ThomsasM> I stand with Rand Paul. We don't need an Obama-lite care. Burn down the whole thing!https://twitter.com/DonnaWR8/status/887604729815158784

887320646086148096 2017-07-18 14:38:22 UTC <ThomsasM> @benshapiro Ryanbill died the same way. McConnellbill faced the same fate
887320237455978496 2017-07-18 14:36:44 UTC <ThomsasM> @benshapiro At least it needs to be repealed. We don't need a Ocare-lite version. Perhaps a good thing it didn't go through
887243833406140417 2017-07-18 09:33:08 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Agreed sir, at least give a relief. Nobody can take the skyrocketing premiums anymore! Repeal the disasterous Ocare immediately!
887160587192381440 2017-07-17 04:02:21 UTC <ThomsasM> @Delta @AnnCoulter Common it's less than a 1% drop. That's nothing, although have to admit that Delta was wrong
886945588649918464 2017-07-17 13:48:01 UTC <ThomsasM> @iowa_trump Not a surprise at all!
886926744845918209 2017-07-17 12:33:08 UTC <ThomsasM> @Delta @AnnCoulter Ann, in all seriousness, books and speeches aside, you deserve more than this.
886925077698166784 2017-07-17 12:26:31 UTC <ThomsasM> @AnnCoulter @kwilli1046 Ann where is this? I lived in Germany for two years but haven't come across this degree of radical Islamic terror. Ocare is a disaster!
886923887342002176 2017-07-17 12:21:47 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump We need Trump until 2024. The swamp is deeper and larger than I had thought

886380162576547840 2017-07-15 00:21:13 UTC <ThomsasM> Best ever statement concerning the menace known as Ocare. The disasterous Ocare needs to be repealed and replaced immediatelyhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/886283456644251652

881511002029793280 2017-07-02 13:52:55 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @MikeTokes @eugenegu @KikkiPlanet I think people are taking it too seriously. He's trying to send a message that violence cannot be accepted in any circumstances. WWE is show

880813378624606208 2017-06-30 15:40:48 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump This is 100% true. If we can't replace the disasterous ocare right away, at least repeal it right away. Smart move!
880812995403669506 2017-06-30 15:39:17 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump This is long overdue, but at least we're doing it now. Save Chicago! It's a war zone without exaggeration!
880404373154562048 2017-06-29 12:35:34 UTC <ThomsasM> @pink_lady56 @TaveresQuixote Sanctuary is a joke. Unfair to everyone and only benefits illegal aliens. SAD!
880209501407793152 2017-06-28 23:41:13 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump The MSM, or the fake news media, and the Dems are nothing more than obstructions. Time to stop the daily barrage of persecution towards T
880025749406728192 2017-06-28 11:31:03 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Sanctuary city is indeed a joke, especially after all of the horrible homicides by illegal aliens. Not fair. Abolish!
879336170894761984 2017-06-26 13:50:55 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Just let OCare implode and make the Dems beg for mercy.

878610808854401024 2017-06-24 13:48:35 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Disasterous ocare must be utterly destroyed and brought to its knees!
878610597188837376 2017-06-24 13:47:44 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Premiums are skyrocketing and increasing at a pace never seen before. Sooner or later the Dems will beg for mercy. But don't wait for that
878610295568048128 2017-06-24 13:46:32 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Dems are in a complete disarray and don't know what to do. Obamacare is a complete disaster. Must be repealed!
878608075288068096 2017-06-24 13:37:43 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump I think this is a shame. No wonder the Dems are losing all over the place. MAGA by completely repealing and replacing Ocare!

843816626201878529 2017-03-20 13:28:55 UTC <ThomsasM> @BetsyDeVosED @dtpollitt because there is too much waste, fraud and abuse. Drain the swamp. Trump 2020!
843816420970450944 2017-03-20 13:28:06 UTC <ThomsasM> @BetsyDeVosED @FreemanMcNeil24 Wrong! Betsy knows what she's doing and is tremendously qualified! This attack is SAD!
843815493609832449 2017-03-20 13:24:25 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @ShafPatel you've posted on a previous tweet...what's the point? And what are you trying to say? SAD!
843814924358897664 2017-03-20 13:22:09 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Clinton and the Dems failed miserably. This smear attack against Trump looks pathetic and SAD!
843812552018616321 2017-03-20 13:12:44 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Trump's EOs haven been by far the BEST compared to other former POTUS' EO, including the disasterous OBAMA!
843812176699699201 2017-03-20 13:11:14 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Obamacare is a disaster - it has to be REPEALED and REPLACED quickly! Hopefully the phony judges don't get in the WAY!
843811825032486912 2017-03-20 13:09:51 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump I believe TRUMP would've won the popular vote by a LANDSLIDE if it weren't for the FAKE NEWS CNN and the failing NYT!
843811047601401856 2017-03-20 13:06:45 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump FAKE news CNN is so UNFAIR! FOX is much better, BIGLY!
843352316388421632 2017-03-18 06:43:55 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @JordanUhl you're right, merkel is the leader of the free world, but Trump is the Champion of the free world. No MATCH!
841276923024089088 2017-03-13 13:17:03 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Obamacare is a disaster! It would be great to let it implode itself and make the Dems to beg for a rescue!
840573081974329344 2017-03-11 14:40:14 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Obamacare is a disaster!
838356713975656453 2017-03-05 11:53:11 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump I have no doubt that Trump is doing the right thing for the American people.Trump 2020!
838345966059044865 2017-03-05 11:10:28 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump when someone hits you, you have to hittem back, and this is exactly the thinking that this country needs.Trump 2020 & 2024!
835479819366227970 2017-02-25 13:21:26 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump that is so true. Make America Debt Low again. MAGA! Trump for 2020!
831830722390347776 2017-02-15 11:41:13 UTC <ThomsasM> @foxandfriends @CNN @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump completely agree. trump for 2020!
829682956662812672 2017-02-09 13:26:46 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump agreed
825331076411199488 2017-01-28 13:13:57 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump its great to tweet at the same time when President does. Such an honor!
824229228216340480 2017-01-25 12:15:36 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump if it weren't for the massive fraud, Trump would've won even the popular vote by a landslide!
823928483688562688 2017-01-24 16:20:33 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump lets admit one true fact: trump is a patriot and an American hero.
823177236706492417 2017-01-22 14:35:21 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump I don't agree with the protests either. Who knows, like the riots in the rallies, if these are paid by Dems?
822425036560560128 2017-01-20 12:46:23 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Trump will go down in history as the best president ever, maybe even greater than GW or AL. Trump is an American hero!
822122724206092289 2017-01-19 16:45:06 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump this is very great. the world needed someone like Trump to stand up and protect freedom from tyrants. Trump!
821860424031182850 2017-01-18 23:22:49 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump this look is very presidential to be. He embodies high energy, strength and leadership
821764682864168960 2017-01-18 17:02:22 UTC <ThomsasM> @benshapiro they're creating fake news. Lol!
821735142141984768 2017-01-18 15:04:59 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump trump has what it takes to be a great leader not only in America but also in the world. Tremendous!
821704323943907328 2017-01-18 13:02:32 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Hyundai is also investing 3bn in the US
821389148145582081 2017-01-17 16:10:08 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump can't believe the media being dishonest even after election. Trump will win against China, the greatest threat to America!
821010667473768448 2017-01-16 15:06:11 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump a very sweet thing to say!
820090468654465024 2017-01-13 02:09:38 UTC <ThomsasM> @benshapiro @ElishaKrauss had this feeling ever since JH joined that someone might leave...4 people is too crammed...and this happened
819397491162386432 2017-01-11 04:16:00 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump total agree. This is the worst fake news after pizzagate
818842123365552128 2017-01-10 15:29:10 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump thank you Donald! Love!
818468116694900738 2017-01-09 14:43:00 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @rdmccall61 Omg, haven't you read crippled America?! The CEO so disloyal to Trump! No way it could be saved!
818467599491088384 2017-01-09 14:40:56 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @tracym why not? Trump is unleashing tremendous amount of energy in America! Love!
818467363649515520 2017-01-09 14:40:00 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Thank you Donald!
816621777434525696 2017-01-04 12:26:18 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Trump is a hero
815371496017137665 2016-12-31 01:38:08 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump have you guys ever thought about why Trump would not let go of this? Media's popular vote and Russia obsession! I'd do same
815019214498955264 2016-12-30 02:18:17 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump this is a right strategy. You can't fight two wars at once. China is a way bigger threat than Russia.
814125741973479425 2016-12-28 15:07:57 UTC <ThomsasM> @benshapiro Obama is a history revisionist like Abe. Obama has never reprimanded the Japs for engaging in a sneaky attack on Pearl Harbor
813675373003030528 2016-12-27 09:18:20 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump I can't believe nobody can read between the lines. He's hinting that the US will do so great because of his fiscal policies
812266512832598019 2016-12-23 12:00:02 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump definetly unfair. This is again media persecution against the great Trump family
812266060082593793 2016-12-23 11:58:14 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump This is sad. This is mainstream media persecution against the Trump family. Massively unfair!
808867311377518592 2016-12-13 02:52:49 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump @Haiirtz lets admit it. This is biggest landslide win ever!
808866454296608768 2016-12-13 02:49:25 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Trump for President 2020!
805934256601985024 2016-12-05 00:37:54 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump years of kowtowing to being subservient to corrupt communist China is over
797834199952596993 2016-11-13 16:11:10 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump although disturbing, it is time to let go of the failing nyt. President trump should now only focus on policies
797833758120382464 2016-11-13 16:09:25 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump this, along with Jeb, was unexpected. "Get down to your knees" haha
797833415898714112 2016-11-13 16:08:04 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump okay, this was kind of unexpected given the fierce animosity during the primary.
797833191851556864 2016-11-13 16:07:10 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump kasich is the kind of person trump needs to surround with.
797832876548964352 2016-11-13 16:05:55 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump trump has never said this. Trump only wants more countries to defense themselves. North Korea is a special situation though
789752595153686529 2016-10-22 08:57:46 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Trump's persona is that of the Lincoln: very presidential and very constitutional. Trump will bring back law and order.
787301551261962240 2016-10-15 14:38:11 UTC <ThomsasM> The liberal media, especially the failing NYT, is again making up stories to hurt Trump's campaign. One lady has proven to be linked to HRC!https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787244543003467776
785338770388246529 2016-10-09 04:38:48 UTC <ThomsasM> Trump's comments in the video were both despicable and contemptible. But Trump is still the only choice left turn America around!https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/785305058757971968
783271409652895744 2016-10-04 11:43:51 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump The election is rigged. Hillary gets away with emails and Trump is undergoing tremendous amount scrutiny for taxes..Insane!
780712702268223489 2016-09-27 10:16:27 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Failing CNN is picking on Trump on having said being smart on not paying fed taxes. Trump meant taxes are being squandered!
780704262179393537 2016-09-27 09:42:55 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump The failing CNN has gathered up some-20 so-called "undecided" and making them say that Hillary did better. Pathetic!
780695690070458368 2016-09-27 09:08:51 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump CNN, keep going on and quoting the Howard Stern Show. Trump has adamantly opposed the Iraque War from the beginning.
780689464377040896 2016-09-27 08:44:07 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump has definetely won the debate. CNN's futile attempt of gathering fake Trump supporters is just pathetic.
778253012636536832 2016-09-20 15:22:32 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump HRC clearly doesn't have the energy to be president. Trump has been travelling everywhere with a very gruelling schedule!
778213730941214720 2016-09-20 12:46:26 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Hillary has been sowing the seeds of radical terrorism by exercising bad judgment or by sitting idly by. We need Trump!
777980511843028992 2016-09-19 21:19:42 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump HRC is so wrong on the incoming POTUS's view on Islam. He doesn't want a war with the religion, only the terrorists!
777976553300832260 2016-09-19 21:03:59 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Hillary will be reckless on borders like her recklessness on emails. She's bought by foreign donors. Wake up America!
777975081087537152 2016-09-19 20:58:08 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Without reining in illegal immigrants, US won't have too much of a country left. Incoming POTUS Trump will only solve this.
777974416051277824 2016-09-19 20:55:29 UTC <ThomsasM> Incoming POTUS Trump's speech and involvement in the Remembrance project is heart breaking. America needs to take in only the finest.
777861132497190912 2016-09-19 13:25:20 UTC <ThomsasM> Under Obama, Britain, Germany, and other U.S. allies have gone their own ways. Trump, a unifier, will unite the allies and tackle China.
777860362024525824 2016-09-19 13:22:16 UTC <ThomsasM> Once Trump is sworn in, his first task has to be kicking out China from WTO (a Clinton disaster). They don't play by any of the rules.
777858414290493441 2016-09-19 13:14:32 UTC <ThomsasM> Trump has to win this election. Washington has been compromised by lobbyists from everywhere in the corner. Stronger America=Stronger world
777857995543674881 2016-09-19 13:12:52 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Washington has been compromised by foreign lobbyists and Hillary has been the central part of it. Trump will rein in this.
772624480380215296 2016-09-04 02:36:45 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump No red carpets or stairs were waiting for Obama when he landed on the soils of China. This BC will not happen under TRUMP
751183104392519680 2016-07-07 22:36:23 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Please allow non-U.S. citizens to donate! Obama's foreign policy has been a disaster and the world needs a fix!
742475745725976576 2016-06-13 21:56:26 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Speech given by Trump after the Orlando tragedy is by far the most powerfully moving and touching speech I've ever heard.
742144581358227456 2016-06-12 00:00:31 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Time says Trump faces backlash after congrats. Before writing a biased piece, please take a look at the tweet right before!
742143650298269697 2016-06-12 23:56:49 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump The disgusting media is now trying to make a fuss about "congrats," which they have cherry picked from the many others!
739950604206940162 2016-06-06 22:42:26 UTC <ThomsasM> Exactly. If @realDonaldTrump hasn't said this, this wouldn't have been even on the agenda, like many other things.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/739934090690998272
738120745432272897 2016-06-01 21:31:13 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Japan, instead of raising tax to tackle tremendous debt, is weakening their currency at the expense of workers elsewhere!
737695910340202496 2016-05-31 17:23:05 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Financial Times is owned by Japanese media. No wonder they are flooding the front page with unfavorable articles on Trump!
737694178881212417 2016-05-31 17:16:12 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump Financial Times is unbelievably unfair to Trump. Haven't seen a single positive article on Trump!pic.twitter.com/9Pt9IsIEMl
736347692729831424 2016-05-27 00:05:45 UTC <ThomsasM> @realDonaldTrump I can't believe what I am seeing. Obama just visited Hiroshima! Does the president even respect the veterans?
