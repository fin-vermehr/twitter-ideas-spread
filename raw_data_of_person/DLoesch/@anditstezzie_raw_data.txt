963256760206266368 2018-02-12 03:41:22 UTC <anditstezzie> @SkyNews @markcurry26 I'm saying it as something to put into perspective. As I said, look at the way the rest of the world deals with armed suspects, then look at the American police and you will see the pattern is alarming. Nothing further.
963256465992667136 2018-02-12 03:40:12 UTC <anditstezzie> @SkyNews @markcurry26 Mark, I'm not saying the guy isn't to blame for having a gun, he's just at fault. However, it's how the officers reacted to it that's the concern, especially considering the circumstances that occurred here. Are you not understanding my point?
963255611831062528 2018-02-12 03:36:48 UTC <anditstezzie> @SkyNews @markcurry26 Perceived danger =/= real danger. The thing that is supposed to separate police officers from ordinary citizens is rules of deduction. They didn't deduce, this officer in question did, but he was reprimanded. Why?
963255346063204352 2018-02-12 03:35:45 UTC <anditstezzie> @SkyNews @markcurry26 Again, I didn't mention colour, so you don't have to explain it to me.  They did get it wrong, because if they used the same logic the former-Marine used, the man would be alive and had his day in court. It's not a victory when a suspect dies, Mark.
963252366047961090 2018-02-12 03:23:55 UTC <anditstezzie> @SkyNews @markcurry26 [I didn't mention colour, so I don't get why you have.]  Let's compare American police to the rest of the world and see who does it better, then we can talk about he-said she-said.

963251608338432001 2018-02-12 03:20:54 UTC <anditstezzie> @SkyNews Not a surprise that a soldier would have better training, knows the rules of engagement and tries to de-escalate instead of going in all guns blazing.
963250773302874112 2018-02-12 03:17:35 UTC <anditstezzie> @SkyNews American police just aren't getting it right. This guy does and gets punished.    So many cases like this too where officers are being punished for not abusing their position of power. More power to you, Stephen.

934920717585481730 2017-11-26 23:04:03 UTC <anditstezzie> When you come back from the bathroom during a hotboxing session and the window's open. https://twitter.com/hartja_/status/933403255341645824
934822177261662208 2017-11-26 16:32:29 UTC <anditstezzie> @JLSXND7RS oh you're Nocturnal! why the name change?
934529278011637761 2017-11-25 21:08:37 UTC <anditstezzie> @oshimakesmusic Oshi I don't tweet you enough bruh, but this bangs! 
934066473936523271 2017-11-24 14:29:36 UTC <anditstezzie> @wizetheproducer That second, third and fourth beat are absolute gas. You wrote a vocal to the last one though! Gotta drop that still 
933835866774081538 2017-11-23 23:13:15 UTC <anditstezzie> Some days you've just got to tab out from the bullshit.
933755251500470272 2017-11-23 17:52:54 UTC <anditstezzie> @Joy_Villa @prageru But the rate it happens to black is still something that requires attention.
933755200900386817 2017-11-23 17:52:42 UTC <anditstezzie> @Joy_Villa @prageru I know that to be a fact that the breakdown of the nuclear family affected the black community heavily, however the 17.5 statistic you mentioned is still shocking considering how disproportionately it happens. We're not denying it doesn't happen to whites,
933700269145317378 2017-11-23 14:14:26 UTC <anditstezzie> @Joy_Villa @prageru @Joshua_Belyeu Remember redlining in the 70s? Still legal today.
933695629141868544 2017-11-23 13:55:59 UTC <anditstezzie> @Joy_Villa @prageru @Joshua_Belyeu Do you not believe police brutality exists? Do you not believe the prison system is heavily flawed? Do you not believe the war on drugs targeted poor communities and minorities?
933695234948595712 2017-11-23 13:54:25 UTC <anditstezzie> @Joy_Villa @prageru @Joshua_Belyeu There's a difference between holding onto grudges and overlooking these issues which are apparent. I'm not American for one, however for you to use a quote instead of an argument or statistic in lieu of what I said says more than I need to.
933689856303292416 2017-11-23 13:33:03 UTC <anditstezzie> @Joy_Villa @prageru Even if it isn't a co-ordinated attack against black people, there's no denying that police brutality, the industrial prison complex and the war on drugs aren't issues that disproportionately affect the black community, low-income families and minorities.
933688054467977216 2017-11-23 13:25:53 UTC <anditstezzie> I tweet at a lot of people, I just don't follow them.

917755035752259586 2017-10-10 14:13:46 UTC <anditstezzie> Keeping a rapport with people that email you about your work is just as important as releasing it.

917377142756921344 2017-10-09 13:12:09 UTC <anditstezzie> Is Kaepernick not donating money to charities?
917376608570433537 2017-10-09 13:10:02 UTC <anditstezzie> Then what's a better way to protest what they're protesting?
917376286556872704 2017-10-09 13:08:45 UTC <anditstezzie> So what's a better way to protest racial injustice and police brutality? People hate marches, they hate kneeling and they hate speaking up.
917376185172144128 2017-10-09 13:08:21 UTC <anditstezzie> People have been burning flags, stepping on them for years, this is much more polite.
917376071951159297 2017-10-09 13:07:54 UTC <anditstezzie> They're protesting against police brutality and racial injustice, not the American flag or America itself.
917375270616739841 2017-10-09 13:04:43 UTC <anditstezzie> before Trump was even announced President.
917375225926504448 2017-10-09 13:04:32 UTC <anditstezzie> Disrespectful to whom? It was a war veteran that suggested to Kaepernick to do it in the first place and he started last August,
917374699956563968 2017-10-09 13:02:27 UTC <anditstezzie> It's not hurting anybody and it's not looting or burning down stores so what's wrong with it?
917363693343707136 2017-10-09 12:18:42 UTC <anditstezzie> At any given moment, there is a race war happening on Twitter.

917344626637459456 2017-10-09 11:02:57 UTC <anditstezzie> Just gotta tab out from the bullshit.
917344074285436933 2017-10-09 11:00:45 UTC <anditstezzie> People saying there's better ways to protest than to #takeaknee so what's the best way to protest racial injustice?
917343812749545472 2017-10-09 10:59:43 UTC <anditstezzie> What protest has never been divisive nor caused controversy?

904519419723997184 2017-09-03 01:40:09 UTC <anditstezzie> @prageru @MATT_TX Difference is with black on black crime people get life sentences, officers get convicted way less.
904519136117760000 2017-09-03 01:39:01 UTC <anditstezzie> @prageru @MATT_TX I never said this. What I'm saying is there's a large culture of police misconduct being made acceptable.
904518960292519936 2017-09-03 01:38:19 UTC <anditstezzie> @prageru @MATT_TX It is a red herring when it's only mentioned when police brutality is brought up. Nobody who says this discusses the cause of b on b crime

904071278704959488 2017-09-02 19:59:24 UTC <anditstezzie> @prageru that the same is true for whites, hispanics and other races. Why can an officer shoot a suspect 14 times on the ground, or 8 times in
904071121464684546 2017-09-02 19:58:46 UTC <anditstezzie> @prageru Everytime police brutality is mentioned people use black on black crime as a red herring, but honestly the statistics show

897429918912479239 2017-08-15 12:09:00 UTC <anditstezzie> Man like Tezzie just passed second year of Uni and got a 72% on his resubmission.
897345101617344512 2017-08-14 06:31:58 UTC <anditstezzie> @LeanandCuisine @ZachClanton @OneSavage_ There is in America. And not all cops are good either. There's a code of silence and a lot of blind eyes.
897249755289530373 2017-08-14 00:13:06 UTC <anditstezzie> @LeanandCuisine @ZachClanton @OneSavage_ And even if your claim was right I'm sure it's natural for someone to get startled at a cop car considering America's police record.
897248116566614018 2017-08-14 00:06:35 UTC <anditstezzie> @LeanandCuisine @ZachClanton @OneSavage_ In what way was he startled? You implied he was, I didn't. "Get your license" he reaches into his car to get it and gets shot. What else?
897210429973377024 2017-08-14 21:36:50 UTC <anditstezzie> she see money all around me, i look like I'm the man
897162552190406656 2017-08-14 18:26:35 UTC <anditstezzie> @LeanandCuisine @ZachClanton @OneSavage_ Reaching back into your vehicle after an officer tells you to get your license is no reason to be shot at. More excuses please.
897162392961986560 2017-08-14 18:25:57 UTC <anditstezzie> @LeanandCuisine @ZachClanton @OneSavage_ That's why Levar Jones exited his vehicle normally thinking the officer wanted to just use the petrol station.
897162296195264512 2017-08-14 18:25:34 UTC <anditstezzie> @LeanandCuisine @ZachClanton @OneSavage_ So you agree the stop was unwarranted and false? And no, Sean Groubert did not flash his lights to signal a traffic stop.

897060230844080128 2017-08-14 11:40:00 UTC <anditstezzie> @LeanandCuisine @ZachClanton @OneSavage_ Second, he never dove back into his car the way you think he did, notice he never put his feet back inside the vehicle. No intent to run.
897060106977804289 2017-08-14 11:39:30 UTC <anditstezzie> @LeanandCuisine @ZachClanton @OneSavage_ Okay dude, a few things you missed. First, the officer never flashed his lights to initiate a traffic stop.

893443270835044352 2017-08-04 12:07:29 UTC <anditstezzie> @SkyNewsTonight @MancunianPuta @xMsCTH @LT2117 @jolovesjuice It's very easy, as evidenced by your profile, to use little things as an indicator that you think someone's life is worthless,

893432867900067840 2017-08-04 11:26:09 UTC <anditstezzie> @SkyNewsTonight @LT2117 It's the job of the courts to deliver punishment, not police officers.

853035448809259008 2017-04-14 00:01:14 UTC <anditstezzie> Confronting your past is a must sometimes. Don't let shit carry itself into your future when it's not finished.

817170276093952001 2017-01-05 00:45:50 UTC <anditstezzie> Donate my heart to these forthright sentiments.
816868728994402305 2017-01-04 04:47:36 UTC <anditstezzie> Nobody should be held accountable for another person's actions.
816863592272240641 2017-01-04 04:27:11 UTC <anditstezzie> The same way blacks can be self-hating should be frowned upon is the same way white people being self-hating should be frowned upon.

816807223057874944 2017-01-04 00:43:12 UTC <anditstezzie> It's so sad seeing people treat others like a collective rather than individuals based on their appearance.
816805281497837568 2017-01-04 00:35:29 UTC <anditstezzie> If we keep boiling down situations to black and white we'll never get anything solved. Treat people like human beings, not skin tones.
816805138375524352 2017-01-04 00:34:55 UTC <anditstezzie> It's 2017 now. All of you have to stop focusing on skin colour. It's getting toxic.
816803132105703428 2017-01-04 00:26:56 UTC <anditstezzie> We're a long way from fairness.
816762967031250947 2017-01-04 21:47:20 UTC <anditstezzie> @oshimakesmusic didn't you remake one of her tunes with tory lanez? good times

816092758364581889 2017-01-02 01:24:10 UTC <anditstezzie> I'm glad I didn't succumb to greater anger as much as I could have when I was upset because there's so many flowers I don't want to burn.
816072864357117952 2017-01-02 00:05:07 UTC <anditstezzie> fighting games were so easy back then as a kid because all you had to do was mash buttons and pray for the best

812769129107177476 2016-12-24 21:17:15 UTC <anditstezzie> Are favourites back?
812731614765707265 2016-12-24 18:48:11 UTC <anditstezzie> We gotta eliminate words like Uncle Tom and coon from our vocabulary.
812730556127596544 2016-12-24 18:43:59 UTC <anditstezzie> As long as human beings keep using labels so as to distance themselves from the next human being makes us further from truly being equal.

787763329796276224 2016-10-16 21:13:08 UTC <anditstezzie> Hurt me I need to.
787623234342707201 2016-10-16 11:56:27 UTC <anditstezzie> Telling yourself not to care is the easiest way.
787612686246932481 2016-10-16 11:14:32 UTC <anditstezzie> I'm going to start following people on Twitter again.
787513754573570052 2016-10-15 04:41:25 UTC <anditstezzie> God I love when it hurts.

787295849600655360 2016-10-15 14:15:32 UTC <anditstezzie> I'm jealous of the wind that ripples through your clothes. It's closer than your shadow, oh I'm jealous of the wind.
786976438079684609 2016-10-14 17:06:18 UTC <anditstezzie> It doesn't cost you a penny to be human.
786663528933588993 2016-10-13 20:22:55 UTC <anditstezzie> Very upsetting to hear about what happened with @Delta airlines. Hopefully there's some balance to this story.
786659789921251328 2016-10-13 20:08:04 UTC <anditstezzie> So many shameful things go on in this world. Try to remain level-headed.
786588783563026434 2016-10-13 15:25:54 UTC <anditstezzie> It burns to be ego.
786532743807049728 2016-10-13 11:43:13 UTC <anditstezzie> Those words apply to almost every situation.
786532664618602496 2016-10-13 11:42:54 UTC <anditstezzie> You're either a performer or a spectator.

785622218097164288 2016-10-10 23:25:07 UTC <anditstezzie> Just tore up Po Na Na in Bath with Sub Basics on decks.
785267645042089984 2016-10-09 23:56:10 UTC <anditstezzie> You are a red herring. Nothing more, nothing less.
785145968643739648 2016-10-09 15:52:40 UTC <anditstezzie> Catch my set at @thenestbath's Open Mic tomorrow 10th October, 9:40 BST!

779912379454881794 2016-09-24 05:16:15 UTC <anditstezzie> Welcome to hell.
779908759665709056 2016-09-24 05:01:52 UTC <anditstezzie> Please reject me.
779339619196436480 2016-09-23 15:20:19 UTC <anditstezzie> Feelings are stupid, don't make me feel stuff 
779336068625641473 2016-09-23 15:06:12 UTC <anditstezzie> Heavily skeptic.
779102597017919489 2016-09-22 23:38:28 UTC <anditstezzie> @SNYProducer @iamblizzard This is a beautiful effort.
778693397745852417 2016-09-21 20:32:28 UTC <anditstezzie> I can't trust you.
778685004268253184 2016-09-21 19:59:06 UTC <anditstezzie> Lord save my soul.
776932632928083968 2016-09-16 23:55:49 UTC <anditstezzie> Just saw this video of Daniel Pollen being stabbed to death in an unprovoked attack. Fucking disgusting to say the least. Rest in peace lad.
775861921077690368 2016-09-13 01:01:11 UTC <anditstezzie> Catch me in my thoughts fuck the meaningless
775129423418884096 2016-09-11 00:30:30 UTC <anditstezzie> I keep telling myself to not define my by my mistakes.
774766484757352448 2016-09-10 00:28:19 UTC <anditstezzie> Fuck the gangs, fuck police brutality but don't do it to each other.
774572905397182465 2016-09-10 11:39:06 UTC <anditstezzie> CRT Music and Thomas Mellor should link up. They've got similar sounds.  @CRTMUSIC @thomasmelloruk
773354569350914048 2016-09-06 02:57:52 UTC <anditstezzie> Maybe if I got my heart broken more often I'd build up a tolerance.
773346858949312512 2016-09-06 02:27:13 UTC <anditstezzie> It's not that.
773344303238316032 2016-09-06 02:17:04 UTC <anditstezzie> Gotta learn to be my own person before anyone else
773344250838839296 2016-09-06 02:16:52 UTC <anditstezzie> It's all relative
772583330202128384 2016-09-04 23:53:14 UTC <anditstezzie> something has to be said,  if even a whisper
772254845730422784 2016-09-03 02:07:57 UTC <anditstezzie> everyone treads on me to fuck and then when i go quiet and distant they ask me what's wrong
771883019053465600 2016-09-02 01:30:27 UTC <anditstezzie> why is there a world outside of my head
771882979824107520 2016-09-02 01:30:17 UTC <anditstezzie> it's all a joke this social media feigning affection and closeness and having to step into reality i wish i could hibernate
771882815382315008 2016-09-02 01:29:38 UTC <anditstezzie> fuck people don't contact me anymore i beg you
771873070646779904 2016-09-02 00:50:55 UTC <anditstezzie> it all just comes back to haunt me
771872578457726976 2016-09-02 00:48:58 UTC <anditstezzie> i hate it all
771871381537652736 2016-09-02 00:44:12 UTC <anditstezzie> i just hate you
771649308781260801 2016-09-02 10:01:46 UTC <anditstezzie> The American Dream just isn't.
771622137358454784 2016-09-02 08:13:48 UTC <anditstezzie> I want to inject some colour back into my life.
771618372291133441 2016-09-02 07:58:50 UTC <anditstezzie> You need to listen when people tell you about the mistreatment they go through because most of the time there is a meaning underneath.
771618170683523074 2016-09-02 07:58:02 UTC <anditstezzie> We can't even be rowdy or enjoy ourselves without people comparing us to apes or assuming we're going to commit trouble.
771618066673184768 2016-09-02 07:57:37 UTC <anditstezzie> Whenever a black person commits a crime it'll always be attributed to their skin colour and not the person themselves.
771617971676467200 2016-09-02 07:57:15 UTC <anditstezzie> Black people and minorities are held to different esteems than other people in a lot of things and it's really unbalanced.

771123836230176768 2016-08-31 23:13:44 UTC <anditstezzie> @Callmecadet Letter to Krept is a madness.
770453339372982277 2016-08-29 02:49:25 UTC <anditstezzie> Sometimes the things we like just aren't for us.
770082071125647360 2016-08-28 02:14:07 UTC <anditstezzie> shit is mad
770082035641753600 2016-08-28 02:13:59 UTC <anditstezzie> rah nevermind it's nothing anymore
770072801160159232 2016-08-28 01:37:17 UTC <anditstezzie> How do I still feel so alone
768599391963840512 2016-08-24 00:02:29 UTC <anditstezzie> Cynical at best. Hollow in the chest.
768595033234759680 2016-08-24 23:45:10 UTC <anditstezzie> I don't understand anyone, why I should have to.
767732349098491904 2016-08-22 14:37:10 UTC <anditstezzie> Plastician - Japan
767005268894846977 2016-08-20 14:28:01 UTC <anditstezzie> We're all consumed by something.

766981038044090368 2016-08-20 12:51:43 UTC <anditstezzie> Step between the lines.
765240143364157440 2016-08-15 17:34:02 UTC <anditstezzie> I've got respect for all the grime producers out there. They make industry standard beats. It's pretty sick.
763180335890915328 2016-08-09 01:09:05 UTC <anditstezzie> It's almost as if there's two dimensions between me and everybody else.
762428949380988929 2016-08-07 23:23:21 UTC <anditstezzie> So fucking quiet
762417430371012608 2016-08-07 22:37:35 UTC <anditstezzie> Everything's okay until reality hits.
760629293126942720 2016-08-02 00:12:09 UTC <anditstezzie> Forever red.
760504100853350401 2016-08-02 15:54:41 UTC <anditstezzie> It is what it is.
760276068020457472 2016-08-01 00:48:34 UTC <anditstezzie> It's all just one massive distraction.
