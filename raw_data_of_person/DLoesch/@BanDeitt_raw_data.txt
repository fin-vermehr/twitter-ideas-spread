962225965966462976 2018-02-09 07:25:22 UTC <BanDeitt> I'll admit it's a little annoying watching all the other competitors walk out representing their nation with smiles and waves, then Americans come out and all I can see is the backs of their iPhones taking selfies and Snapchatting #OpeningCeremony
962225127357337600 2018-02-09 07:22:02 UTC <BanDeitt> So is @jimmykimmel just gonna leave his messages on "read" and tell us he wasn't aware of any debate proposal? So boring @benshapiro @RubinReport @fleccas
961285985576407041 2018-02-07 17:10:13 UTC <BanDeitt> @jimmykimmel @benshapiro @RubinReport @fleccas Please, yes!

952922647070957568 2018-01-15 15:17:18 UTC <BanDeitt> As we begin to practice regular giving, we see how ludicrous it is to hold on to the abundance God has given us and merely repeat the words "thank you." -Francis Chan @crazylove
947744731936821248 2018-01-01 08:22:06 UTC <BanDeitt> @JanetRWojcikPhD @SujanaChandrase Well. Maybe that and he didn't commit any malicious or harmful acts... Being a beligerant drunk doesn't necessarily spell terrorism.

945366293817057281 2017-12-25 18:51:03 UTC <BanDeitt> @NotGayJared Die Hard. I can't even get my friends to admit it's a Christmas movie

940702608431382528 2017-12-12 21:59:13 UTC <BanDeitt> @ThePunisher is very entertaining and suspenseful! If you can just look past how veterans are portrayed as dysfunctional crazies, waiting to snap and the one @NRA member just happening to be a lying, racist, psychopath. #politicsineverything #activistirony
940116722173992960 2017-12-10 07:11:07 UTC <BanDeitt> Had a great time seeing Christmas lights and trees at the brewery! @ Anheuser-Busch Brewery https://www.instagram.com/p/BcjZcXrAJPG/

938874962710028290 2017-12-07 20:56:49 UTC <BanDeitt> As well educated as @Pontifex may be, it seems one book he has never opened is the Bible.

937535253991886848 2017-12-03 04:13:17 UTC <BanDeitt> So #BrockTurner doesn't want to have to register as a sex offender. As if he didn't get off easy enough already...
936275857483714560 2017-11-30 16:48:54 UTC <BanDeitt> @RVAwonk @leadersoftheark @hamza_ouaghad @jpetazzo Sure, but it's one thing to not need compliments. It's another to annual accuse someone of sexual harassment for complimenting you
936269253405233153 2017-11-30 16:22:39 UTC <BanDeitt> @drmoore Does "flirty business" mean that Geraldo will be the next to get called out?
936115891317723137 2017-11-29 06:13:15 UTC <BanDeitt> I bet all of these celebrities and politicians (as well as their victims) wish they had followed the @mike_pence rule.

935371456183193600 2017-11-27 04:55:08 UTC <BanDeitt> Charles Manson used to brag about how famous he was considering that he wasn't even dead. Maybe not a "solution", but perhaps we should stop turning murderers into celebrities.

935325698092302337 2017-11-27 01:53:18 UTC <BanDeitt> Star Wars Battlefront 2 was near perfect in 2005. Can't @EAStarWars just remaster that? Maybe add a few characters and maps? Thats really all we want...
933145512898736128 2017-11-21 01:30:01 UTC <BanDeitt> Opened up an early Christmas Present. This is a Korean War Service Medal that belonged to my Grandfather. He served as a Fire Controlman on board the U.S.S. DH Fox from 1950 to 1953. #USNavy #Koreapic.twitter.com/O7U0H5GNp9
