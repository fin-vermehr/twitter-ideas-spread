971075038119018501 2018-03-06 17:28:25 UTC <AustinOnSocial> @BraveSampson @tengoal @Cameron Makes sense, for the time being I think that they could at least give a bigger warning, their current messaging doesn't really explicitly say that.
971074828319862784 2018-03-06 17:27:35 UTC <AustinOnSocial> @tengoal @BraveSampson Perhaps highlight it (like in the image) and make it more obvious with something like, "note: this means once BAT is in the browser, you CANNOT move it out. It will be sent to you assigned publishers" or something on those lines.
971073195619962880 2018-03-06 17:21:06 UTC <AustinOnSocial> @BraveSampson For a way to take coins out of your browser wallet! I heard a recent horror story that someone dumped their loads of coins into their browser thinking it was a wallet. Or at least make it more well known/apparent NOT to do that for long term hodling.
970895712509607937 2018-03-05 05:35:50 UTC <AustinOnSocial> Well done, @SpaceX.

970890105081626626 2018-03-05 05:13:33 UTC <AustinOnSocial> @netflix @timeissoold I've heard LOTS about "Dark", it's on my list.

Its in my opinion that they both dont do anything but Id never attack someone over it.

963919312632336385 2018-02-14 23:34:07 UTC <AustinOnSocial> Complaining on Twitter about those who tweet thoughts and prayers has become the new thoughts and prayers.   Theyre both useless and wont change anything.

915413921175150593 2017-10-03 03:11:01 UTC <AustinOnSocial> Hey guys.   I know a guy who sells chairs designed for use in waiting rooms. He has a very high-level position.  He's the chair man of the bored.
915368454953283585 2017-10-03 00:10:21 UTC <AustinOnSocial> @Cameron Possibly. I'm no technician but I'm of the mindset that we don't know the facts yet so we shouldn't assume we do. I bet there's more to it.
915359731006492673 2017-10-03 23:35:41 UTC <AustinOnSocial> @Cameron I did hear it was a sledgehammer, not just a hammer but I'd assume a few hits to most glass would shatter after that.
915358630509236229 2017-10-03 23:31:18 UTC <AustinOnSocial> @Cameron This is actually an interesting thought. Maybe they do?
