942041478531969025 2017-12-16 14:39:25 UTC <Lex_in_CO> Not paranoid but lets be honest - identifying unique signals from a phone to track traffic DOES track people. One accident or traffic stop in that area and anyone with access to the data could match signal to person easily.http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_31529676/loveland-hits-back-at-news-blog-mobile-phone?source=rss

I am FIGHTING to stay alive battling side effects and at war with my own cells to see my daughter graduate.

935154495775842305 2017-11-27 14:33:00 UTC <Lex_in_CO> @CNN @Stickit2Stage4 I know it hurts but we dont look at soldiers killed in battle as less than worthy. To the contrary we lift the up ... honor them. Guess its my Viking heritage but as fellow terminal cancer pt I myself am okay with battle analogy

935146656907124736 2017-11-27 14:01:51 UTC <Lex_in_CO> @CrazyCancerLady Worse is that SHE believes this and so do others like her. They also share their wisdom about how all oncologists are giving chemo for the kickbacks but if we just try their diet or supplements we can be cancer free
