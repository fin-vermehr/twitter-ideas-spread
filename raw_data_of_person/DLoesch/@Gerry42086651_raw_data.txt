971161194492059648 2018-03-06 23:10:46 UTC <Gerry42086651> @dbongino @AriFleischer I totally agree....It is as if posturing in agreement with a vile, despicable man who spews his rhetoric under the banner of his religion...Do these Congress Members represent the views of their constituents?   I hope not .....certainly not the views of most Americans.
971075118809088001 2018-03-06 17:28:44 UTC <Gerry42086651> @jaketapper So glad to see you address Farrakhan...Most do give him a pass....He is a dangerous Anti Semite....and espouses hate to many other groups as well...He should be reminded how our lives  are enriched by Jewish contributions.....me? an appreciative Gentile
970818850399932416 2018-03-05 00:30:25 UTC <Gerry42086651> @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper Why indeed....Anyone who stays silent is complicit....That is how 6 million Jews were murdered...That is equal to taking out Greater Atlanta....Ponder that....And there are not enough words to THANK Jews for their sacrifices and contributions to the world..me? Southern Gentile
970723621084848129 2018-03-05 18:12:01 UTC <Gerry42086651> @RepDannyDavis @jaketapper Where is the outrage that should be coming from all stripes...regardkess of religion or party.....Six million Jews were systematically murdered because of this dismissive attitude.....Farrakkan is a  very dangerous BLOWHARD who should be denounced like David Duke.Both  RACISTS
970638796172791809 2018-03-05 12:34:57 UTC <Gerry42086651> @MarALago @jepence @VP @pastormarkburns To Ms Hart...aka Heartless.   BFD And better looking than you
970321688750587910 2018-03-04 15:34:52 UTC <Gerry42086651> @jaketapper @GlobeCullen Beautifully written....Two beautiful souls skating forever
