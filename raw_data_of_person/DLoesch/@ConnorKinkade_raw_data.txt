968357067265380352 2018-02-26 05:28:10 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @Me1i79 Metroid was announced in E3 last year so that should be definite.
966829888995864576 2018-02-22 00:19:43 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @discordapp @juliaamccurdy Why replace it?
966534163951046656 2018-02-21 04:44:36 UTC <ConnorKinkade> The most effective way to mitigate shootings would be teaching kids morals, respect, and manners again. Society as a whole would be better.https://twitter.com/CloydRivers/status/966521702673993729

964525952322609152 2018-02-16 15:44:41 UTC <ConnorKinkade> Disgusting. How can people be like this?https://twitter.com/emmalwolff/status/964521776784035843

961999803944235008 2018-02-09 16:26:41 UTC <ConnorKinkade> Book of Lost Tales volume 1. So far not bad, but it's a tough read.https://twitter.com/goodreads/status/961963668421345280
961298579657773061 2018-02-07 18:00:16 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @KassyDillon Anyone get a screenshot?
959735700655607808 2018-02-03 10:29:56 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @PocketKnifeBill That's probably what I'll end up doing... it's just intimidating how much longer those books are.

959472306396581889 2018-02-02 17:03:18 UTC <ConnorKinkade> I need to hop back on the Middle Earth train. I was thinking of starting with The Silmarillion since I haven't successfully completed it since 7th grade. Also, I now have Book of Lost Tales 1 and 2. Should I just read those instead of the Silmarillion? Or just do LOTR again?
959267242440581121 2018-02-01 03:28:27 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @KassyDillon I would eat it!

948976843243343872 2018-01-04 17:58:05 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @JLaw1277 My favorite work out program is seeing how fast I can drive to and from Krispy Kreme and eating a dozen donuts. The fastest I've eaten that many donuts was less than an episode of the office. #progress
948411857638952960 2018-01-02 04:33:02 UTC <ConnorKinkade> Nights like this are why I don't end up deleting Twitter! So much panic. 
947865443603304448 2018-01-01 16:21:46 UTC <ConnorKinkade> My New Years resolution: read more books.
947702703135879169 2017-12-31 05:35:06 UTC <ConnorKinkade> 2017 was a great year. Things will happen in 2018.

946185467803914240 2017-12-27 01:06:09 UTC <ConnorKinkade> On top of all this we are reading Narnia so we have all kinds of fun! https://twitter.com/ConnorKinkade/status/946041902377439232

945704068772782082 2017-12-26 17:13:14 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @PocketKnifeBill That sounds good too. I'll have to find it. I didn't get that one for Christmas

945136521677549568 2017-12-24 03:38:01 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @NintendoAmerica, @PocketKnifeBill and I need Pokmon Crystal on the 3ds virtual console. Thanks bye!  P.S. I still love you and all your games.

944336317621653504 2017-12-22 22:38:17 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @ClashBandicoot_ It got me to start playing again so that's pretty good. I haven't dealt with inferno much yet but everything else is chill.
944006717729312769 2017-12-21 00:48:34 UTC <ConnorKinkade> Middle Earth is my favorite but I think I'd choose Narnia because it sounds happier when bad stuff isn't happening.https://twitter.com/goodreads/status/944002056930590720
943890599056478209 2017-12-21 17:07:10 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @juliaamccurdy Yeah, but it's probably expensive. It cost me 60 bucks on the PC.

943331647767961602 2017-12-19 04:06:05 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @PocketKnifeBill Hopefully it passes soon. It wears me out lol.
943331297145118722 2017-12-19 04:04:42 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @PocketKnifeBill That's gross. People need to realize not everything is political.
943280760022355969 2017-12-19 00:43:53 UTC <ConnorKinkade> This is satire right? I can never tell anymore. Normal people don't actually think like this.https://twitter.com/Spacekatgal/status/942773570811387904

942223262699917312 2017-12-16 02:41:46 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @3PrincessPeach4 The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe first. Welcome to the make-shift clash of clans book club!
942210468067905537 2017-12-16 01:50:55 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @3PrincessPeach4 Just started this afternoon actually

942105310671589376 2017-12-16 18:53:04 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @supercell @ClashBandicoot_ What's happening to the inferno tower?
941936524282810369 2017-12-15 07:42:22 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @Anna_CoC_ Not as much though. Everyone's just on their phone all the time playing clash and Pokemon and Farmville and freaking out about minor issues.
941418341138403329 2017-12-14 21:23:17 UTC <ConnorKinkade> Maybe people will start reading books or playing outside again.

938572038104666113 2017-12-06 00:53:06 UTC <ConnorKinkade> You legally can't buy weapons if you are any of these anyway. If a criminal obtains a weapon they probably don't care that they're illegally concealing anyway. They're already breaking the law. You help the good guys arm themselves to stop the bad guys.https://twitter.com/NancyPelosi/status/938544649504993285

811242984490598400 2016-12-20 16:12:54 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii lol challenge accepted.
811221653434855424 2016-12-20 14:48:08 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii they're all masters 1 but i got very lucky. Haven't found loot like that since.

807237335179927553 2016-12-09 14:55:53 UTC <ConnorKinkade> Wish I could filter everything Clash Royale out of my feed. How is there enough substance to cover so much content on it?
807092818187431936 2016-12-08 05:21:37 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @ClashBandicoot_ for sure man, thanks. 
807058632613515268 2016-12-08 03:05:47 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @ClashBandicoot_ I'll have to think about it. I'm not the best attacker and joined a clan recently. Maybe later down the road for sure!
807054300518215680 2016-12-08 02:48:34 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @ClashBandicoot_ heroes 24/25, 98 level 10 walls

802823706028277760 2016-11-27 10:37:41 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii lol that sounds annoying.
802759997880840192 2016-11-26 06:24:32 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii why was he banned?
802640360899952641 2016-11-26 22:29:09 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii we don't know each other.
801521212228702208 2016-11-23 20:22:03 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @GiO_BossTycoon sorry, was asleep lol
801411255739133952 2016-11-23 13:05:07 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @ClashRoyale @supercellgames @Clash_with_Ash where's the @ClashofClans shirts?
800920212409192448 2016-11-21 04:33:53 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @HonestLee5 I don't gym much but this is probably the most aggravating thing ever.
800898040005468160 2016-11-21 03:05:47 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @Eagles @Seahawks @NFL @HonestLee5 your relievers could take lessons from our QB.
800851282734903296 2016-11-21 23:59:59 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @ClashTutor @ClashManual for sure. His explanations for attacks and base building are logical and make so much sense.
800633263899348992 2016-11-21 09:33:39 UTC <ConnorKinkade> I got a magical chest! It's been months.pic.twitter.com/bCbeDRHnF2
800621654778875904 2016-11-21 08:47:31 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @ErisHunter looks like you have too many friends
800475822276476928 2016-11-20 23:08:02 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii especially up I'm champions. Everyone destroys everything there. 
800471584599220224 2016-11-20 22:51:12 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii 25 is still a respectable number
800471094842904576 2016-11-20 22:49:15 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii I was actually born in February... lol
800469994521772033 2016-11-20 22:44:53 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii not sure. I want my heroes and walls max first. Then I'll upgrade when I'm bored. You?
800468272164446208 2016-11-20 22:38:02 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii that's true, but in crystal you don't have to hit next near as much. There's more dead bases with 3-5k de. Just faster imo
800443783452033025 2016-11-20 21:00:44 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii I also look specifically for dark elixir and just slowly accumulate my gold and elixir for walls.
800443422108631040 2016-11-20 20:59:18 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii When my queen is down, I drop to crystal 2 or 3 and goblin knife bases with at least 2500 de... I also have time to raid a lot.

799548597964603392 2016-11-18 09:43:35 UTC <ConnorKinkade> CoC player tag #2L8QUGRP9 if anyone feels like adding me on social.
799443533161635840 2016-11-17 02:46:05 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @triviaforcoc is this before my time like the Santa surprise or whatever?
799411106502451200 2016-11-17 00:37:14 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @OnehiveGenesis sorry to hear this. Been watching @ClashManual for awhile and yall have been one of my favorite clans to follow.

795164951862124544 2016-11-06 07:24:32 UTC <ConnorKinkade> I'm probably going to need to get psychiatric help because clash royale makes me so angry.
794472189365874689 2016-11-04 09:31:45 UTC <ConnorKinkade> Think it's time for some Battlefield 1.

793278247840518145 2016-10-31 02:27:27 UTC <ConnorKinkade> This might be the longest I've played @ClashRoyale without raging... almost one month since reinstalling.
793167568659812352 2016-10-31 19:07:39 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii any Tim Burton movie. Maybe nightmare before Christmas or corpse bride... unless you're into horror stuff then idk.
793073327258558466 2016-10-31 12:53:10 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @GiO_BossTycoon @sealpupxxii yeahhhh I have less than half your stars lol. #2L8QUGRP9
793070748457762816 2016-10-31 12:42:55 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @GiO_BossTycoon @sealpupxxii sounds like a plan haha
793069257877704704 2016-10-31 12:37:00 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii @GiO_BossTycoon that's a sweet idea. My clanmates are lazy but I'll try to motivate them lol
793068108952985600 2016-10-31 12:32:26 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @GiO_BossTycoon @sealpupxxii tourney would be cool but my schedule is unpredictable, and no th10s. Just 9 and under :/
793066247793483776 2016-10-31 12:25:02 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @GiO_BossTycoon @sealpupxxii that's fine with me! I can get my queen up to 25 lol
793064054298337281 2016-10-31 12:16:19 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii @GiO_BossTycoon that's what's up! in a war now and I'll ask my clanmates about fw before I leave. I'm sure I can help anyone.
793062221882335232 2016-10-31 12:09:02 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @GiO_BossTycoon @sealpupxxii I'm down for fw but I was thinking I might have to join one of yalls clans soon if you'll have me.
793060967777046528 2016-10-31 12:04:03 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @GiO_BossTycoon @sealpupxxii yeah. I got a bunch of friends to start playing. I'm the only one who takes the game seriously lol
793059859239272449 2016-10-31 11:59:39 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii @GiO_BossTycoon sweet thanks guys
793058235196461056 2016-10-31 11:53:12 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii @GiO_BossTycoon thanks I appreciate that. If you're in war and you dip out for some bowlers, will you still be able to attack?
793050735722180610 2016-10-31 11:23:24 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii @GiO_BossTycoon that's one problem I have. Nobody in my clan has bowlers... it sucks.
792722580419465216 2016-10-30 13:39:25 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii my 1st attack in war today I used valks. my funnel wasn't quite set and my attack was worthless lol. It was a rushed base too.
792719471588671488 2016-10-30 13:27:04 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @sealpupxxii that and GoVaHo are my go to strategies but I still suck. It's hard to practice on farming bases tho and my friends are th5-8.
792708224466116608 2016-10-30 12:42:23 UTC <ConnorKinkade> Anyone know how to become a proficient 3 star attacker when your clan is mega casual and you're  always matched against rushed bases?

786216087461298177 2016-10-12 14:44:57 UTC <ConnorKinkade> @OnehiveGenesis I think they're enjoying our suffering.
785930470328459264 2016-10-11 19:50:00 UTC <ConnorKinkade> Waking up to find @ClashofClans still isn't updated is probably more disappointing than waking up at 5 am. I guess you can't rush perfection
