906511063860043778 2017-09-09 13:34:14 UTC <Tocanepauli> @businessinsider @BIUK Can't see how it would stick in sand etc. love the concept though
906510417333288961 2017-09-09 13:31:40 UTC <Tocanepauli> @smerconish if I have a product in very high demand and in short supply I will naturally put the price up. Look at #Apple
906241750586544129 2017-09-08 19:44:05 UTC <Tocanepauli> @nbc6 @ErikaGloverNBC6 @DianaRuggOnTV That's what I thought seeing all the jams on the road and then there are all these planes not being used.....doesn't make sense somehow....
906238664136634368 2017-09-08 19:31:49 UTC <Tocanepauli> @nbc6 @ErikaGloverNBC6 Good luck, just seemed strange to see them tied down when they could be flying free...stay safe.
906237359661953024 2017-09-08 19:26:38 UTC <Tocanepauli> @nbc6 @ErikaGloverNBC6 Why didn't they just fly them away from #hurricaneirma?
906236705325408256 2017-09-08 19:24:02 UTC <Tocanepauli> What happens to all the motorists if  #HurricaneIrma hits while they are still evacuating?
906195479679127552 2017-09-08 16:40:13 UTC <Tocanepauli> Really #skynews - you would think you would check your spelling before making International announcements! #HuricaneIrma #spellingpic.twitter.com/pPYOEAODhR

905624903692505088 2017-09-06 02:52:57 UTC <Tocanepauli> @LBC Good on them! Suitcases in the hold, handbags in the plane- much more sensible.
905488396465922048 2017-09-06 17:50:31 UTC <Tocanepauli> @KlipLand Fake!! Not from #IrmaHurricane
904746251866005504 2017-09-04 16:41:30 UTC <Tocanepauli> Why does everyone say it will be #ww3 if  #NorthKorea was bombed? Who are its allies? It would be #NorthKorea against the world!
904745713082540032 2017-09-04 16:39:22 UTC <Tocanepauli> @Juan_A_Llorente Just like it is "considering" a fire and brimstone approach to #NorthKorea
904611723566612482 2017-09-04 07:46:56 UTC <Tocanepauli> @ChrliesWarchest Do they actually know where they all are? Australia perhaps? In shop yards getting holes repaired?
904437922836963329 2017-09-03 20:16:19 UTC <Tocanepauli> @JoelCRosenberg The more I keep hearing this, the more I begin to doubt it!
904241067138195456 2017-09-03 07:14:05 UTC <Tocanepauli> At least one of the 2 idiot leaders is doing what he said he would! #realDonaldTrump #NorthKorea
904226675348692995 2017-09-02 06:16:53 UTC <Tocanepauli> That must have been an "oh Shit" moment, somewhere in the world #NorthKorea
904224643615268865 2017-09-02 06:08:49 UTC <Tocanepauli> @NZNationalParty Amazing how they start to see the problem, just before an Election.This shouldn't even be PART of an election promise, it should be a given!
904119206031101953 2017-09-02 23:09:51 UTC <Tocanepauli> @LibyaLiberty Well that nurse is welcome to have a holiday at ours in France if you can get her here! She deserves it!! Serious offer!!!
903856594332549124 2017-09-01 05:46:19 UTC <Tocanepauli> @GeoffreyFiji Marbles are now banned in most school!
903662319351332865 2017-09-01 16:54:20 UTC <Tocanepauli> @LBC any new trade deal the U.K. does will entail an immigration clause, which essentially negates the whole Brexit argument!
903538762612965376 2017-09-01 08:43:22 UTC <Tocanepauli> @mrjamesob There is NOTHING in the UK that you can't already find in the EU! When will the brexiteers realise this???
903363661045133313 2017-08-31 21:07:35 UTC <Tocanepauli> @Nigel_Farage @LBC It's not the EU who wants a Brexit deal, it's the U.K.!!!

900573473189371904 2017-08-23 04:20:22 UTC <Tocanepauli> @LBC Bizarre to think that they had these letters already on file in the first place!!!
900570624602632192 2017-08-23 04:09:03 UTC <Tocanepauli> @businessinsider @BIUK I think it's going a bit far to think of an oil tanker as a attack machine! - it takes kilometers to stop or turn the thing!
898941947242565632 2017-08-19 16:17:16 UTC <Tocanepauli> @LBC your caller David speaks the truth!!! If you don't want to work for McDs , go get another job!!!

895878255571369984 2017-08-10 05:23:15 UTC <Tocanepauli> Instead of war, why don't they just take out #KimJongUn? Then see if #NorthKorea is still unhappy ....rather lose 1 than a million.
895616316589174784 2017-08-10 12:02:24 UTC <Tocanepauli> So if there is to be a war, why should it become a World War? 3 strikes and they will be all out !#NorthKorea

859479182132346882 2017-05-02 18:46:20 UTC <Tocanepauli> @inside_nk Just like I said! Shower them with goodies and food from the west and they will do the Wests job for them. #revolt
859024733278535680 2017-05-01 12:40:30 UTC <Tocanepauli> Would this REALLY turn into a world war?? You have tinpot #NorthKorea on one side and #theworld on the other. Where's the world war?
858212586399125504 2017-04-28 06:53:20 UTC <Tocanepauli> Do we REALLY think it would be #ww3? It would be tinpot#NorthKorea against the superpowers! Hardly #ww3 !
856560831697440768 2017-04-24 17:29:51 UTC <Tocanepauli> @dwnews So they have finally left Australian waters then!
856442996488851456 2017-04-24 09:41:36 UTC <Tocanepauli> @wpaulsen31 Hopefully not by Postcard this time!
855518421047549952 2017-04-21 20:27:40 UTC <Tocanepauli> @benjones1k Going to meet them where?? Australia?? Hawaii? Some other place??
855375923352403969 2017-04-21 11:01:26 UTC <Tocanepauli> @Barkum68 You mean they are REALLY sailing for #NorthKorea this time??
855285766607388672 2017-04-20 05:03:11 UTC <Tocanepauli> @38NorthNK @ReThinkDefense Shower them with Western gifts and chocolates, foods and travel videos and neat t-shirts and stuff. Create a young uprising......
854774415921467392 2017-04-19 19:11:16 UTC <Tocanepauli> @Info24US @TheTruth24US For real? Don't believe it!! She did it all off her own back ..........#nepotism
853525440430059521 2017-04-16 08:28:17 UTC <Tocanepauli> Why don't we just shower #NorthKorea people with good things? Internet tablets, funky clothing, cool gadgets and fab toys.

853485978077548544 2017-04-15 05:51:28 UTC <Tocanepauli> @NoScience4War So why don't the West just bombard the #NorthKorea folk with internet enabled devices? 000's of little iPhones could bring #NK to its knees!
852850639625482240 2017-04-14 11:46:52 UTC <Tocanepauli> @newsjean What if there was a war and #NorthKorea didn't want to fight but just wanted a life like their families in the South?
852785147317436416 2017-04-14 07:26:37 UTC <Tocanepauli> Has anyone ever asked the normal #NorthKorea people what they think? They might WANT to be freed so they can join the #SOUTHKOREA people.
852783314364538881 2017-04-14 07:19:20 UTC <Tocanepauli> Ever thought that IF the #US strikes #NorthKorea and the NK people are freed and they see how the world really is,they might just "give up"?
852389067874545664 2017-04-12 05:12:45 UTC <Tocanepauli> @mr_colourit Hardly looks wet and wild........damp and miserable maybe.
852388282344361984 2017-04-12 05:09:37 UTC <Tocanepauli> I do NOT want war. I have children who don't need to see the horrors of war! We are all worried..
852379231074078720 2017-04-12 04:33:39 UTC <Tocanepauli> #NorthKorea please don't start #ww3 yet #TheRealDonaldTrump ! My inlaws are still here and they gotta fly back thru #SthKorea. Wait...
852376500112429056 2017-04-12 04:22:48 UTC <Tocanepauli> Because they don't give a flying fuck about anyone else!
852375609586089984 2017-04-12 04:19:16 UTC <Tocanepauli> @DesertBlackWolf They were already at war! Have been since the 50s! It was only a "truce".
852375192592633856 2017-04-12 04:17:36 UTC <Tocanepauli> @BMWalt Seeing it written all over but will wait for proper confirmation (whatever the hell THAT means!!)

852369652785328128 2017-04-12 03:55:36 UTC <Tocanepauli> Bizarre to think that, as the birds tweet in the new day, today might be the start of #ww3 #NorthKorea
