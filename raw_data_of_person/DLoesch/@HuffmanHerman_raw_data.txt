965274892265500672 2018-02-18 17:20:42 UTC <HuffmanHerman> @WatchChad Writing laws that infringe on law abiding citizens will not stop this madness. If the perpetrators wont follow the law that you cannot commit murder, what makes you think it will stop them getting illegal guns?
965273421910339587 2018-02-18 17:14:52 UTC <HuffmanHerman> @EveryDollar $3,000 left on #2
965217949685633026 2018-02-18 13:34:26 UTC <HuffmanHerman> @schoolwalkoutUS @schoolwalkoutus - Taking guns away from law abiding citizens is not the answer. If these perpetrators followed law then they wouldnt have broken the two already on the books. Use logic not emotion.
964317803955277824 2018-02-15 01:57:35 UTC <HuffmanHerman> @theblaze I believe in gun control. I hit what I aim at. For these liberals, there are enough laws that people dont pay attention to. It is not a gun issue, it is a heart issue.
962771982973657088 2018-02-11 19:35:02 UTC <HuffmanHerman> @EveryDollar Ive been doing this for years.

961787591870820352 2018-02-08 02:23:25 UTC <HuffmanHerman> @SpeakerRyan @LACaldwellDC Why didnt the Dems take care of DACA when they had all three branches. It wasnt important until they lost control of house and senate.
960705102112837632 2018-02-05 02:42:00 UTC <HuffmanHerman> @garyvee @DaveRamsey @HustleGreat Good for you. I am almost 58 and have been in debt most of my life. I am now getting out, I only have about $4,000 left.

957661538764148737 2018-01-28 17:07:57 UTC <HuffmanHerman> @EveryDollar If you have varying income leave room for a margin of error. You can always adjust as you go.
954704027610177542 2018-01-20 13:15:52 UTC <HuffmanHerman> @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats - Nonessential personnel in the private sector would not have a job. Cut the fat. Balance the budget.
954624791981502465 2018-01-20 08:01:01 UTC <HuffmanHerman> @SenateDems @SenateGOP @senateGOP @senateDems Get Your acts together and do the peoples will. Balance the budget and stop the deficits. Live within our means.
