971154520096075778 2018-03-06 22:44:15 UTC <FerranteCj> you know my opinion on the best place to go @Brownshttps://twitter.com/kirkcousins8/status/971149458242088960
971086767741964289 2018-03-06 18:15:02 UTC <FerranteCj> @Coach_Guglielmo @BramWhite_ @GrantConahan6 Lets agree to disagree
971086093436227586 2018-03-06 18:12:21 UTC <FerranteCj> @Coach_Guglielmo @BramWhite_ @GrantConahan6 They could move the ball atleast and they werent nobodies found outside the stadium they were decent guys also look at the average age of the browns they barely had any veterans which doesnt help we were basically a glorified college team
971085548705239040 2018-03-06 18:10:11 UTC <FerranteCj> @BramWhite_ @Coach_Guglielmo @GrantConahan6 Because they were out there the whole game cuz our offense couldnt get a first down to save their life
971085163353530372 2018-03-06 18:08:39 UTC <FerranteCj> @BramWhite_ @Coach_Guglielmo @GrantConahan6 Because we had no offense which is why we need playmakers on that side of the ball regardless of their position
971084482353811456 2018-03-06 18:05:57 UTC <FerranteCj> @BramWhite_ @Coach_Guglielmo @GrantConahan6 I agree but our defense helped us a lot this year we need better secondary help which they could also get in FA
971083772979482630 2018-03-06 18:03:07 UTC <FerranteCj> @BramWhite_ @Coach_Guglielmo @GrantConahan6 He missed two games this year against teams that werent the greatest
971082815478599681 2018-03-06 17:59:19 UTC <FerranteCj> @BramWhite_ @Coach_Guglielmo @GrantConahan6 He changed how teams would game plan for them which took pressure off bortles and made him a better quarterback
971082512997978112 2018-03-06 17:58:07 UTC <FerranteCj> @BramWhite_ @Coach_Guglielmo @GrantConahan6 Why not we have young talent and a lot of assets to turn this team around in a couple years and we can afford to give them the most money we also have one of the best offensive coordinators in the game now
971082038303477760 2018-03-06 17:56:14 UTC <FerranteCj> @BramWhite_ @Coach_Guglielmo @GrantConahan6 Look at last year with the jags
971081326148358147 2018-03-06 17:53:24 UTC <FerranteCj> @GrantConahan6 @BramWhite_ @Coach_Guglielmo True but the browns also have 100 million+ this offseason thats why the should through the bank at Kirk cousins and sign some talent to help like Allen Robinson or Sammy Watkins and get some proven offensive lineman to help out
971080575934189568 2018-03-06 17:50:25 UTC <FerranteCj> @GrantConahan6 @BramWhite_ @Coach_Guglielmo We havent had a winning season since 07 those five years can help us get some serious talent down the road because right now nobody wants to come here and play
971080188011442176 2018-03-06 17:48:53 UTC <FerranteCj> @BramWhite_ @GrantConahan6 Barkley makes our running game way better by pairing him with duke which helps whatever qb comes in here
971079767981219842 2018-03-06 17:47:13 UTC <FerranteCj> @GrantConahan6 @BramWhite_ Mayfield is a proven winner and a proven leader
971079144594460672 2018-03-06 17:44:44 UTC <FerranteCj> @GrantConahan6 What was the surrounding help for Allen
971078410083631104 2018-03-06 17:41:49 UTC <FerranteCj> @GrantConahan6 Darnold  turned the ball over too much the browns had that last year with kizer
971078098413334534 2018-03-06 17:40:35 UTC <FerranteCj> @BramWhite_ @GrantConahan6 Watch his film, Yes he struggled in some games but he was the reason they were in a lot of games he did it all for them played receiver, returned kicks , and ran the ball thats the kind of talent you need to turn the worst offense in football around
971076413217484802 2018-03-06 17:33:53 UTC <FerranteCj> @GrantConahan6 If you want a big arm quarterback thats who u go after other than that its a qb with turnover issues browns had that last year Rosen has questions if he even loves the game and is injury prone the best qb than would be baker mayfield and he will be there at 4
971075530257784832 2018-03-06 17:30:22 UTC <FerranteCj> @GrantConahan6 Your telling me josh Allen wont be there at 4?
971075332789948416 2018-03-06 17:29:35 UTC <FerranteCj> @BramWhite_ @GrantConahan6 Barkley is the best player in this draft why would u pass on that when you have holes at almost every single spot
971074472294998019 2018-03-06 17:26:10 UTC <FerranteCj> @GrantConahan6 Since this is the deepest quarterback class in years your telling me one of them wont be there at 4? Or if you believe they wont be there then trade up you dont pass on talent like Barkley
