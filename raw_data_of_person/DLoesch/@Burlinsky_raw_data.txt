969573762667433984 2018-03-02 14:02:53 UTC <Burlinsky> @TheMarkPantano It should read:  How Trump did his job as POTUS and started enforcing existing laws  These dummys incite division on a daily basis, enforcing laws used to be partisan.
967893364069736448 2018-02-25 22:45:35 UTC <Burlinsky> @jonfitchdotnet Who decides what exploitation is? If you started your own business , would you like someone forcing rules on you outside of existing state/federal laws? I feel exploited at times making less than 5% of a jobs profit in construction, but I chose my field. Everyone wants more $$

The great thing about living in America is we are not forced to work or employ in a FREE MARKET.   The analogy above sounds like gas and electric companies, or public schools only providing one choice (both ran by corrupt unions)

I always tell young guys to go through the union apprenticeship because it pays more with benefits,pension & training. But I also think the free market would be better for the more talented guys after the market equaled out in 10 to 20 years??

959449207156350976 2018-02-02 15:31:31 UTC <Burlinsky> @MattWalshBlog If they believe that there are no demons at work in this world, then they have not read the Bible.   They are lukewarm Christians at best and Many vote for Democrats that believe in making up their own morality  (pro-choice, pro-homosexual, pro-perversion) and ignoring Gods word.

He must of looked at the historical/Biblical facts surrounding Jesus? Has he seen William lane Craigs stuff? Les Feldick is another great teacher. The evidence of Grace>The Law is overwhelming

944775686442516481 2017-12-23 03:44:11 UTC <Burlinsky> @CoryBooker @RockinRoads @shinobi42 The argument has nothing to do with impacting your rights it has everything to do with the unborn baby's right to life. People who oppose abortion on thr moral basis that the unborn baby is a sentient being.   No one wants to control you..only save a life
944573469622013953 2017-12-23 14:20:39 UTC <Burlinsky> @arielhelwani @oddsamson @jase0910 Unions were def needed..BEFORE age of information. Personally I would be better off negotiating my own wage over Cletus or Jabari that just finished their apprenticeship.   OUR SKILLS/TALENTS ARE NOT THE SAME!   Our worth as humans is, but not our abilities to perform our job.
944394451752927235 2017-12-22 02:29:17 UTC <Burlinsky> @arielhelwani You think Its odd that the government cant force private employers (who dont force employees to work there) to be union and pay everyone the same, rather than performance based pay!? I'm Union btw,but free market in  Allows you your nice salary

942048426455318529 2017-12-16 15:07:01 UTC <Burlinsky> Peter Strzok handled the botched Benghazi investigation (the one where no one got even a hand slap). Despite the testimony/account of American heros who were actually there...fighting and dying to protect our rights. Americans should be OUTRAGED!

940618503643525120 2017-12-12 16:25:01 UTC <Burlinsky> @sallykohn Now youre criticizing a man for his 2000+ year old religious beliefs.  A lot of people feel the same way if asked a faith based question, but are not ANTI LGBT. You cant expect everyone to morally agree with you personal life.  Condemn  the sin , but love the sinner.
940357451735375872 2017-12-11 23:07:42 UTC <Burlinsky> @WalshFreedom Maybe due to the FACT the New Testament does not condone/promote violence or direct followers of Jesus to do so, quite the opposite actually.
940301030289317893 2017-12-11 19:23:30 UTC <Burlinsky> @WalshFreedom @themitchellfink What are your thoughts on these verses?  https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/violence.aspx
940274302951100417 2017-12-11 17:37:17 UTC <Burlinsky> @WalshFreedom @MarkRubello @themitchellfink 1st, I support freedom of religion.  There are a lot of evil White people, true. But they are not all tied into one doctrine. The New Testament does not condone violence on anyone. The Quran absolutely does, without having to create one off translations.
940273305025519616 2017-12-11 17:33:20 UTC <Burlinsky> @WalshFreedom I wish people would openly discuss/debate without insults and name calling  Islamism = political Islamic fundamentalism =full implantation of sharia law
