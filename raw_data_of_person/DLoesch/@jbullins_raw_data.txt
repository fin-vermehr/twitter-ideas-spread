Dr. Blanchard got the Ducks and Eagles analogy from Dr. Wayne Dyer & it is a simple description of a person who if a Duck  quacks about everything in life & only sees the negative where an Eagle  soars above the ordinary & sees solutions. I trust Trump - Do you?
944217628368887810 2017-12-22 14:46:39 UTC <jbullins> @AnnCoulter (1.) The negativity is starting to be a bit much.  Good grief you write books supporting the man & spend most of your time criticizing all he does. You have become what my favorite author, Dr Ken Blanchard calls a quacking duck  basically a person who only sees the negative.

864883410539610112 2017-05-17 16:40:48 UTC <jbullins> The problem is there is too much media coverage so they have to make up junk so they have something to talk about.
864882275300896768 2017-05-17 16:36:17 UTC <jbullins> @blackrepublican @davidfrum A biased and pathetic media who asked Obama questions like how has the family dog adjusted to the White House. PATHETIC!
