971160130560581632 2018-03-06 23:06:33 UTC <FloppyRunner> @ReproRights @CSRA_prsn Now that there's funny.

971111557684912128 2018-03-06 19:53:32 UTC <FloppyRunner> @ReproRights Sorry, you'll have to cite a respectable source if you'd like me to read it, but I assume it's something like your buddies at PP receiving $550 million from the fed last year and spending $20 million of it on the campaigns of Democrats.
970500999528853505 2018-03-04 03:27:23 UTC <FloppyRunner> @conservmillen "Reproductive Justice" is a personal favorite of mine...
970039678249259008 2018-03-03 20:54:16 UTC <FloppyRunner> @VP @dawnlaguens @DCJMB63 @YOD5FED YES. Real men defend the vulnerable, the weak, the defenseless.
968683982404567041 2018-02-27 03:07:13 UTC <FloppyRunner> @NARAL @ExplorerRowan @ThankYouBob44 How very original...
968625045462425600 2018-02-27 23:13:01 UTC <FloppyRunner> @NARAL @ExplorerRowan Perhaps because 55 million dead babies.
966155709418123267 2018-02-20 03:40:46 UTC <FloppyRunner> @FDRLST Never thought I'd feel sorry for Lena Dunham...but I do...
964630664413790208 2018-02-16 22:40:47 UTC <FloppyRunner> @MattWalshBlog Ahhh yes, but people love to not be held accountable for what they say. Kinda hard when it's IN WRITING.
960956103017185280 2018-02-06 19:19:23 UTC <FloppyRunner> @CecileRichards Under your reign at PP, the lives of more than 3 million young people were at...wait, no, they're already dead.
959925265622118400 2018-02-03 23:03:12 UTC <FloppyRunner> @AbortionFunds @NARAL @annkwalter But there will always be healing and forgiveness available to those who seek it.
959817185056075777 2018-02-03 15:53:44 UTC <FloppyRunner> @dawnlaguens @CecileRichards @Mickeithestone1 It's a good thing your mother decided you were worth it, yes?
959773640874078208 2018-02-03 13:00:42 UTC <FloppyRunner> @dawnlaguens @CecileRichards @Mickeithestone1 Yeah, just a blob of cells right?
959614549518254080 2018-02-02 02:28:32 UTC <FloppyRunner> @nytdavidbrooks @NARAL At least they live to tell about their experiences...
959614316151369728 2018-02-02 02:27:36 UTC <FloppyRunner> @nytdavidbrooks @NARAL @FiniteHappiness Sure, in the same way he/she doesn't believe in the freedom to murder.
959613407304433666 2018-02-02 02:23:59 UTC <FloppyRunner> @PattyMurray @funkutron I sympathize with your problem, but not your solution. Your solution is to kill the results of intercourse, not to, you know...have less unprotected sex?
959566522657120256 2018-02-02 23:17:41 UTC <FloppyRunner> @dawnlaguens @CecileRichards @sycartes59 @mcgillrizer Wow, did you come up with that insightful argument yourself?
959500674709925889 2018-02-02 18:56:02 UTC <FloppyRunner> @dawnlaguens @CecileRichards @sycartes59 Right after you get a conscience.
959499309887582211 2018-02-02 18:50:36 UTC <FloppyRunner> @dawnlaguens @CecileRichards I wonder whether you've ever been in the womb when your mother really did not want you to be. I wonder if you've ever felt that a political party has more control over your body than you do you do. No? Then take a seat.
959498843996897280 2018-02-02 18:48:45 UTC <FloppyRunner> @dawnlaguens @CecileRichards It's a good thing for her that her mother "wanted her". Maybe not for the millions of babies she's indirectly slaughtered, but for her.
959108699527593984 2018-02-01 16:58:28 UTC <FloppyRunner> @CecileRichards @nh1Birddog She has neither dreams nor a soul, so...no.
958407271075037184 2018-01-30 18:31:14 UTC <FloppyRunner> @russell_nm @CjRIspark Says the one who thinks it's ok to use forceps to tear limbs off of a tiny human one by one before leaving him or her to die.
957683348280758272 2018-01-28 18:34:37 UTC <FloppyRunner> @freeblackgirl @BitchMedia @NARAL @createdequalorg @James_Silberman @dap9573 When you've been schooled on one topic, simply change topics.
955578641122869248 2018-01-22 23:11:16 UTC <FloppyRunner> @JoyAnnReid Go home, you're drunk.
951573454217560064 2018-01-11 21:56:05 UTC <FloppyRunner> Dear 10 (or whatever) followers: this is heartbreaking. https://twitter.com/BeatriceFedor/status/951177379887636480
951246941194657799 2018-01-10 00:18:38 UTC <FloppyRunner> @NARAL There's a very simple reason for this that can be summed up in 6 words. "Who the hell is Michelle Williams?"   But sure, sexism and a gender wage gap.
950868622255124480 2018-01-09 23:15:20 UTC <FloppyRunner> @RealSheriffJoe Please go away.
950807085259808768 2018-01-09 19:10:48 UTC <FloppyRunner> @NARAL @renreuen @ShortndPatience @motek42 But that's not fitting NARAL ' S narrative. Come on now...
949783262284541952 2018-01-06 23:22:30 UTC <FloppyRunner> @Cosmopolitan @PPFA Shooting my neighbor in the face is the safest way to end his life.
949782654672453632 2018-01-06 23:20:05 UTC <FloppyRunner> @ReproRights Source please.
949413022404984832 2018-01-05 22:51:18 UTC <FloppyRunner> @conservmillen @NetmasterSr I hear you, but I don't blame most of them. I think more often than not they're scared, feel alone, and are pressured by friends/family/partners. They're sold a lie by the PP types and denied that they'll ever regret it or feel emotional pain.
949061277720236032 2018-01-04 23:33:35 UTC <FloppyRunner> @NARAL Perhaps you might then understand why some are upset that we also pay your buddies at PP who performed 320,000 abortions last year 550 million dollars in the same timeframe.   https://www.plannedparenthood.org/uploads/filer_public/71/53/7153464c-8f5d-4a26-bead-2a0dfe2b32ec/20171229_ar16-17_p01_lowres.pdf  Oh who am I kidding, of course you won't.
948996183342514176 2018-01-04 19:14:56 UTC <FloppyRunner> @ReproRights Yaaaay death!
947999959411957761 2018-01-01 01:16:17 UTC <FloppyRunner> @GloriaSteinem @ReproRights It's just like the declaration says: reproductive rights, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   Oh...wait...
947880099633696768 2018-01-01 17:20:01 UTC <FloppyRunner> @russell_nm @melania9021 Right, AFTER the hospital refused to allow him to leave and caused a ~5 month legal battle while his condition deteriorated. We'll never know what the outcome would have been if he'd been allowed to leave when requested.
947617715954507776 2017-12-31 23:57:24 UTC <FloppyRunner> @NARAL As usual, your ridiculous graphic is mildly misleading, and by mildly misleading I mean hugely misleading.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purvi_Patel
944684897846796288 2017-12-23 21:43:25 UTC <FloppyRunner> @NARAL Well wait they're not showing shit stains in toilet paper commercials, so I guess we have that to work on too...
944684063763263488 2017-12-23 21:40:06 UTC <FloppyRunner> @NARAL Now if only we could get dismembered fetuses to be shown on your website, things would really be accurate!
943602957756407810 2017-12-20 22:04:11 UTC <FloppyRunner> @Liz_Wheeler I like the idea but...do you have a source?
943587492074156034 2017-12-20 21:02:43 UTC <FloppyRunner> @MattWalshBlog I may be taking troll bait here, but anybody who comes to kill my dog will find themselves staring down the barrel of a 9mm before they achieve their goal.
943508301911691265 2017-12-20 15:48:03 UTC <FloppyRunner> @benshapiro Isn't she supposed to be the "queen of clean" or was that Ellen?
943464250302873601 2017-12-20 12:53:00 UTC <FloppyRunner> @MattWalshBlog Broke through his CHAIN? Yeah, I'm sure he wasn't abused at all.
943462444193550336 2017-12-20 12:45:50 UTC <FloppyRunner> @wotmeighn I would like to invite you to come meet and spend some time with my dog.
943269180815548417 2017-12-19 23:57:52 UTC <FloppyRunner> @MayorStanton It perplexes me when Democrats are so concerned about the deficit during talk of tax cuts, but never while yet more new spending is being proposed...
939164351541293056 2017-12-08 16:06:44 UTC <FloppyRunner> @MattWalshBlog Would you cover?https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5093734/alfie-evans-charlie-gard-high-court-life-support-alder-hey/?utm_source=FBPAGE&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=SprnklrSUNOrganic&UTMX=Editorial:TheSun:FBLink:Statement:News
935489095127597057 2017-11-28 12:42:35 UTC <FloppyRunner> @MattWalshBlog @davidikard @bananu7 I don't personally like slavery, but I wouldn't want to force my views on anybody else...
933793368210935808 2017-11-23 20:24:22 UTC <FloppyRunner> @PPFA This year, I'm thankful my limbs weren't torn off in my mother's womb and I wasn't put through a garbage disposal.
931601156916240384 2017-11-17 19:13:18 UTC <FloppyRunner> @MattWalshBlog I've never seen more red herrings and straw men than in the replies to this post.

926527069646757888 2017-11-03 19:10:42 UTC <FloppyRunner> @MattWalshBlog I'm with you, sort of; unfortunately cities are where the jobs are. And long commutes suck too.
925491027527397376 2017-10-31 22:33:50 UTC <FloppyRunner> @ReproRights I'd love to meet the genius who came up with the terms "reproductive rights/justice". What a brilliant way to hide the innocent third party.
925089151703064576 2017-10-30 19:56:55 UTC <FloppyRunner> @NARAL From one who hates abortion more than anything, it will never stop w/ legislation. Need to care for those in need & change hearts and minds.
924710315761078272 2017-10-29 18:51:34 UTC <FloppyRunner> @ReproRights Hopefully we can get them to teach kindergarten kids about sodomy too...http://m.news9.com/story.aspx?story=36609941&catId=112032
924441268922359808 2017-10-28 01:02:28 UTC <FloppyRunner> @NARAL Paying for goods and services one receives is such an antiquated and ridiculous idea. All material possessions are rights, all owed to me.
921871838401118208 2017-10-21 22:52:28 UTC <FloppyRunner> @bodyform @NARAL @KeepINitReal604 I'm just so grateful we have NARAL to hold these companies accountable for their injustices!
921464064257155072 2017-10-20 19:52:07 UTC <FloppyRunner> @NARAL @Annalee_Perez I'm always astounded & appalled by the extreme measures "pro-choicers" take to convince themselves to ignore the innocent third party.
921463317989691392 2017-10-20 19:49:09 UTC <FloppyRunner> @NARAL @maudab @alexaa_speed It's a good thing your mother thought otherwise.
921461698166263808 2017-10-20 19:42:43 UTC <FloppyRunner> @ArizonaDOT I believe the PC term is "burro"... :P Poor guy.
921167152253562881 2017-10-19 00:12:18 UTC <FloppyRunner> @NARAL Trump's proposed health insurance BC restrictions: racist.  Aborting disproportionate numbers of black babies: not racist.  Hmmm...
918508216065056768 2017-10-12 16:06:38 UTC <FloppyRunner> @New_Colossus_ I won't stop protesting until they cover my toothpaste as well. TPFIC

902979780546486276 2017-08-30 19:42:10 UTC <FloppyRunner> @Thomaskirkm And how exactly did you get that from the Nashville statement? Do you read words?
902978989655863296 2017-08-30 19:39:02 UTC <FloppyRunner> @iammattcote What can I say, some of us aren't narcissists who need to tweet every detail of our lives or rely on the approval of followers.
902978712274067456 2017-08-30 19:37:56 UTC <FloppyRunner> @Thomaskirkm Not exactly a twitter aficionado/junkie. I struck a nerve, or what?
902978308668657664 2017-08-30 19:36:19 UTC <FloppyRunner> @realMSTD And when a loved one is running towards a cliff, do you say "good for you, follow your dreams, be yourself!"?
902704954791550976 2017-08-29 01:30:07 UTC <FloppyRunner> @MattWalshBlog Gotta love it. "Here's a list of people who actually believe what the bible tells us, convenient or not!"

889521738781872128 2017-07-24 16:24:43 UTC <FloppyRunner> @MattWalshBlog Perhaps U clowns would be satisfied if statement changed: courts and hosp pissed away time allowing genetic disease to kill
886014286539087872 2017-07-14 00:07:21 UTC <FloppyRunner> @CenterForBioDiv @publiccarbon ...congrats??
885493203025117184 2017-07-13 13:36:45 UTC <FloppyRunner> @MattWalshBlog The epitome of self-centeredness. Whole article is about how hard providing abortions has made HER dating life. Poor thing...
839552565310205952 2017-03-08 19:05:04 UTC <FloppyRunner> @azgfd Yes. Had to move over for one. They can climb like 80 degree slopes but seem to demand that you move from the trail.
824669187498864641 2017-01-26 17:23:50 UTC <FloppyRunner> @mindyfinn Isn't "career civil servants" a bit of an oxymoron?
823560182198210560 2017-01-23 15:57:03 UTC <FloppyRunner> @valleymetro Cool, any chance this will come to buses, namely the Rapid routes?
806280006808678400 2016-12-06 23:31:48 UTC <FloppyRunner> @nature_arizona I think you mean 7,000.
789184104361185281 2016-10-20 19:18:47 UTC <FloppyRunner> @PhoenixConvCtr @azfamily No...no, it's really not.
789183752387776513 2016-10-20 19:17:23 UTC <FloppyRunner> @jasonbarrytv I just saw it. It's hardly what I'd consider "huge".
787061673190363138 2016-10-14 22:45:00 UTC <FloppyRunner> @TeamMcMullin @Evan_McMullin @MedvedSHOW, how about getting @evan_mcmullin on the show? #Istandwithevan #evanmcmullin #letstalkprinciples @mindyfinn @teammcmullin
