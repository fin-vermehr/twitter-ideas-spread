970537717686816769 2018-03-04 05:53:18 UTC <RyderofSidhe> @DLoesch Facts are TABOO to the low information voters of the left. They do not want to hear them because it destroys what they believe to be true. Every knows that if the FBI and the BSO did their jobs the first time around this would of never happened.
