964221866339717121 2018-02-15 19:36:21 UTC <mygracecoach> If you believe it takes a village (aka the government) to raise a child you are sadly mistaken. The village has failed. It takes both fit and willing parents regardless of separation/divorce.  Kids need both parents. Wake up people!
964205908304809994 2018-02-15 18:32:57 UTC <mygracecoach> @Daddyduwsf I totally agree. He was set up to fail. No sympathy for his horrific actions; my heart bleeds for the families of the fallen and society. Statistics dont lie - the red flags were there.
964202326201380865 2018-02-15 18:18:43 UTC <mygracecoach> @Daddyduwsf I think only a small percentage of divorce or separation cases are domestic violence caused. I dont know this kids history other than reading he came from Florida CFS system, so he had a bad beginning and then lost his foster parents to death. The risks factors were apparent.
964193690137841665 2018-02-15 17:44:24 UTC <mygracecoach> We need to get to the source of the rage.
