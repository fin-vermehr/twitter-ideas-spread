Maybe then your nonsense would have more clarity, maybe not. It is unlikely that you know the man personally, so you cherry pick your narrative from ppl who have no more knowledge than you, fueled by hate.

964745121261637633 2018-02-16 06:15:35 UTC <nazgul1999> @IngrahamAngle Unfortunately the 4th estate was for sale. They abandoned the required objectivity years ago. They were supposed to be part of the solution, instead they opted for part of the problem.
964740291570872320 2018-02-16 05:56:24 UTC <nazgul1999> @neiltyson FYI: the power of prayer is a priori. Nothing is effective after the fact, except a surgeon. In the context of stopping a bullet. In the context of healing, anything positive is beneficial. Even a trip to Lourdes.

Dont  think there are any wildcats in Great Britain. Point out that currently there is a lot of violence in the <sic> UK. Due to refugees with knives and bombs assimilating. Plus no 1st amendment protection. Cant protest.

Violence only alienates, teaching fear. To be practical only an idiot would advocate violence against Romans. The Maccabees brought violence with predictable outcome. In the return the balance of power will favor the righteous. Then Jesus will change  hats.

Criticizing their government could get you an all expenses paid vacation at a gray bar. They may even allow you your choice!
964498285649186818 2018-02-16 13:54:45 UTC <nazgul1999> @POTUS @FoxNews @tlburton65 Its also so logical. Only the left is capable of uniting anti-fascist fascists. They are so accomplished at double speak.

964486022330544128 2018-02-16 13:06:01 UTC <nazgul1999> @POTUS @FoxNews @HelvecioLambert So why not move to any other country? They all have total gun control. Youll be so much safer there! Unless, of course, you criticize the government. Then official people with their guns remove you to an even safer gray cell, where you are no threat to domestic tranquility.

Until then the problem is the human heart that employs them. I think you are making the case for the person you are criticizing.

964366285252444160 2018-02-15 05:10:14 UTC <nazgul1999> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @rokeypdx Because of no metal detectors to prevent entry of weapons into the building. $500 in a single entry school to stop guns, bombs, knives, anything metallic.
964364833826091008 2018-02-15 05:04:28 UTC <nazgul1999> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @MomRovin Another inconvenient truth the fascists and haters fill the ranks of the left. The concept of hate crimes was politicized by the Clintons. All-star haters, along with all their enablers.

The impulse to kill arises in the killer not the tool. A good katana in the hands of a trained user is very lethal and doesnt need a reload. Just a target rich environment.
964361145510326274 2018-02-15 04:49:48 UTC <nazgul1999> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @WickedSlapper And if he had homemade bombs? Found a way to trigger carbon monoxide from the furnace? Explosives are much better mass kill devices.

Hire 3 off duty or retired police to man the entry morning and end of school day, whatever is affordable. Shooter(s) cannot gain entry.

963868109055647745 2018-02-14 20:10:39 UTC <nazgul1999> @SethMacFarlane I am amazed at how everyone seems to ignore that ambient radiation is much higher within galactic arms. Life developed on earth bc we are in-between the spiral arms and earth core is still liquid, creating an electromagnetic shield.

963655982302756864 2018-02-13 06:07:44 UTC <nazgul1999> @POTUS @FoxNews Its incredible that the constitution would grant low level judges the power to override an elected president. I dont think it does. The courts usurped power in Marbury vs. Madison without a constitutional amendment.
963654313968132097 2018-02-13 06:01:06 UTC <nazgul1999> @POTUS @FoxNews I want to know where in the constitution the founding fathers, who had just escaped tyranny, decided to award unelected judges the power to override an elected president, or elected congress?

In the modern world dictators do military parades to intimidate their citizens as much as their enemies. In USA we include military bands in parades nonmilitary, we dont copy totalitarians

960216755523260416 2018-02-04 18:21:29 UTC <nazgul1999> @TGowdySC @FoxNews Before appointing a special counsel, another member of the cabal. Republicans have created a track record for endless hearings that convict no one like Fred Thompson and white water. First they make enough noise to be appointed head of a commission, full of the sound and fury.
960214706219872256 2018-02-04 18:13:20 UTC <nazgul1999> @TGowdySC @FoxNews Ya wonder, the swamp talked about insurance policy. How far did that go? Is that why Sessions positioned himself in advance? Then recused himself for a flimsy reason in favor of Rosencrantz, a cabal member. You would think that Rosencrantz would have checked with his boss first.
960206707774443522 2018-02-04 17:41:33 UTC <nazgul1999> @TGowdySC I did notice that session after session and not one malefactor is behind bars. Recalls Fred Thompsons hearings on white water and how ineffectual they were. Mueller above reproach? Doesnt look@like it from here.

953698918566649856 2018-01-17 18:41:55 UTC <nazgul1999> @seanhannity I think like DJT, he is attempting humour.
953697550246301696 2018-01-17 18:36:29 UTC <nazgul1999> @HistoricalPics Often wondered how they managed to hold their hands over their heads for so long?
952984569329876992 2018-01-15 19:23:21 UTC <nazgul1999> @MittRomney Says someone who assumes youve been dumbed down and dont know history. How was Nauvoo for your fam Mitt? Islam also has a history Mitt while Jesus was exhorting his followers to love your neighbors, Mohammed was exhorting his followers to eviscerate theirs in 130+ Koran verses.
952533115616071680 2018-01-14 13:29:26 UTC <nazgul1999> @M_RSection @Pontifex Yeah sure, why should they work to fix the problems in their own country, when they can just go and live off somebody else? Especially if they have taken go forth and multiply to heart, and added Repeat to the admonition.

940725132296970240 2017-12-12 23:28:44 UTC <nazgul1999> @History_Pics Camp guards were not excused for following orders. Y should immigration personnel be absolved?
939674573292888065 2017-12-09 01:54:11 UTC <nazgul1999> @Pontifex Corruption is defiance of Gods will. Nothing to do with money.
935531916052353024 2017-11-28 15:32:44 UTC <nazgul1999> @PoemsPorn Just stay sit.
933475544712273921 2017-11-22 23:21:27 UTC <nazgul1999> @HistoricalPics @solarspaceprobe Yes, anyone afflicted by the Judaic tradition of guilt, like Christians, would be particularly susceptible. Tnx 4 clarification.
933402411967963137 2017-11-22 18:30:51 UTC <nazgul1999> @HistoricalPics @solarspaceprobe Point 3 is just a euphemistic definition of oppression. (4) The objectives of the USA in Vietnam were not to occupy and oppress. If that were the goal, Mai-Lai would have been a badge of honor.
933400553207582732 2017-11-22 18:23:28 UTC <nazgul1999> @HistoricalPics @solarspaceprobe See my reply was too abstract for Jordan.  Let me be more specific. (1) lmperialism and authoritarianism are synonymous. (2) There was no invading army to oppose because the invasion had been completed. (3) poor little constitutional monarchy just trying to retain its colonies.
933038637830295553 2017-11-21 18:25:20 UTC <nazgul1999> @HistoricalPics @solarspaceprobe Sometimes compartmentalization creates walls between synonyms. The invading army had already completed its mission. In concept, mashed potatoes are antithetical to spaghetti. Avoiding one can land you in the other.

933030694988795905 2017-11-21 17:53:47 UTC <nazgul1999> @HistoricalPics Its good to have an IQ before creating a public image.
