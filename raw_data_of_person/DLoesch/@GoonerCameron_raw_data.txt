971236068627533833 2018-03-06 04:08:18 UTC <GoonerCameron> @KyleKashuv Youre too smart for him, Kyle. Too reasonable. Too logical. He doesnt want effective conversation. He doesnt want open, objective communication. He wants you to hear his side while he shouts it to all. Dont waste your time on him.
971206764581433344 2018-03-06 02:11:51 UTC <GoonerCameron> @davidelizarraga Totally. What a little pussy pretending like he got kicked
971179990325739520 2018-03-06 00:25:28 UTC <GoonerCameron> I love how all the #Arsenal players completely bitched Van Nistelrooy!https://twitter.com/footythrowbacks/status/785177108712714240

964381069045678087 2018-02-15 06:08:58 UTC <GoonerCameron> @realDonaldTrump @jimmykimmel More school shootings happened under Obama than any other US president. Funny how not one of those was his fault yet Trump is to blame for all the shootings now. You're simply too much of a biased moron to take seriously.
964211119614189569 2018-02-15 18:53:39 UTC <GoonerCameron> @piersmorgan @benshapiro was right about you, Piers. You're finally showing you want to ban all guns. Took you long enough to admit it.
963927424973942784 2018-02-14 00:06:21 UTC <GoonerCameron> @michaelianblack @erica767 @artsydenise Hahaha, Jesus Christ, you're funny. I could give a shit about guns. I don't own any and could care less if they were banned tomorrow. I'm simply rational and reasonable enough to know that the witch hunt that is blaming the NRA is pointless and misguided.
963925465944621056 2018-02-14 23:58:34 UTC <GoonerCameron> @wonderousATX The NRA is one of the best organizations ever created. There, you convinced? No? Damn, I thought that was a solid argument
963923591615062016 2018-02-14 23:51:07 UTC <GoonerCameron> @michaelianblack @erica767 Obviously that's a great agenda. Do you actually think anyone doesn't have that agenda (besides the psychos who commit the crime)? Everyone wants safe schools. Difference of opinion is simply HOW we achieve that. NRA simply isn't the enemy, imo.

956685099830992897 2018-01-25 00:27:56 UTC <GoonerCameron> @CallMeKinslow That's the safest bet I've seen in a while! No chance we sign Auba. Wenger just wants the fans to think he's trying. The transfer will "fall thru" on deadline day and wenger will say "well, I tried so you can't be mad". Sad that so many fans still fall for his smoke and mirrors
955488872711970816 2018-01-22 17:14:34 UTC <GoonerCameron> @GregProops @benshapiro Yup! Ryan and Colin made that show. Greg who?

954160622849081344 2018-01-18 01:16:34 UTC <GoonerCameron> @ArsenaIDude You know how Trump just took that cognitive test to see if he was clinically insane? They need to administer that to wenger. Guarantee he'd fail miserably.

946938857034887168 2017-12-29 02:59:51 UTC <GoonerCameron> @NYTScience Evidence doesn't matter. There's been TONS of evidence for years but the people denying it don't care about facts. Conversely, it seems the more evidence that comes out, the more they double-down on their moronic stance.
946861855389003777 2017-12-29 21:53:52 UTC <GoonerCameron> @aunderscorek @ParkerMolloy Holy fuck, this is depressing. The cast that's arguably responsible for destroying television with their moronic, ignorant, despicable behavior is capable of more rational thought than the president of America.

945751726803390465 2017-12-26 20:22:37 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon Idk, there's always 3 sides to a story: his side, her side, and the truth. We only know his side so like you say, we don't know the details so it's impossible to come to a conclusion.
944706248871632896 2017-12-23 23:08:16 UTC <GoonerCameron> @ManUtd @piersmorgan @rom_edward @badababatope "Try to catch" and "going to catch" are two VERY different things, dummy. Every team is trying to catch city. In reality, united are in the same exact boat as Arsenal: fighting for nothing more than top 4.
944354920144060416 2017-12-22 23:52:12 UTC <GoonerCameron> @TheArsenalChris No one actually buys this guy's BS, right? So obviously a troll account

941919841811759104 2017-12-15 06:36:04 UTC <GoonerCameron> @RobHolding95 @Arsenal Oh look, he's still on the team. Good to see. We should be able to get a few good games out of him before Wenger figures out a way to make him shit.
941481546128564224 2017-12-14 01:34:27 UTC <GoonerCameron> Hey @Arsenal fans, remember when most of us wanted Pep to replace wenger and some of you said "be careful what you wish for"? Remember that? Thank god we stayed with the "safe" option instead of gambling on that "risky" manager. #WengerOut

927253140751007744 2017-11-05 19:15:50 UTC <GoonerCameron> @TheArsenalChris Such an obvious troll. You know as well as we all do that is was a senile, psychotic decision to leave Laca on the bench.

921209121629548546 2017-10-19 02:59:04 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon Obviously they want profit. Thats like saying they want to breath air. Whether they're extorting people is the question that needs answering
921208662055559168 2017-10-19 02:57:14 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon In this instance, "bitching" means speaking/judging/condemning a company before having all of the facts.
921207950969991168 2017-10-19 02:54:25 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon Get all the facts, THEN judge them. The civil rights was an obvious injustice. This isn't (yet). Totally different.
921207433028034561 2017-10-19 02:52:21 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon that support your case and Ill join you. I'm not saying the co. is fair/ethical. I'm simply saying theres no proof right now that they arent
921206984979836928 2017-10-19 02:50:35 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon Again, how does this deserve attention if you dont know the cost?! Youre ASSUMING they're ripping people off but have ZERO proof. Find facts
921201978918674432 2017-10-19 02:30:41 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon be right there with you protesting them. Without knowing tho, let's hold off judgement.
921201818243252224 2017-10-19 02:30:03 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon I do not know. Hence why I'm not bitching at them to lower it. I can assure you it's not that low, but if it's anywhere close to that, I'll
921201383553908736 2017-10-19 02:28:19 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon maybe 500 people. If the cost is $300k and they sell for $20k, they'll be out of business in a week and help only 1 person. Which is better?
921201089684189184 2017-10-19 02:27:09 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon but you can't be mad at the company. Again, u have NO clue what the cost is. If the cost is $300k and they sell for $370k, they'll help
921200709260926982 2017-10-19 02:25:38 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon It's not a private company's responsibility to make a product everyone can afford. You can be mad that the GOVERNMENT isn't providing care
921199085272449024 2017-10-19 02:19:11 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon Do you know what the cost to produce the treatment is? No? What if it's $200k? Should they be forced to sell it below their cost?
921198230280347653 2017-10-19 02:15:47 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon Ohhh, ok so customers should be able to name their own price? What should the price be then? $10k? $1k? $29.95? What's a reasonable price?
921193603875053568 2017-10-19 01:57:24 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon It's not. It's absurd. It costs BILLIONS to run a pharma co., so idk why he thinks they should give away their products.
921138828378644480 2017-10-19 22:19:45 UTC <GoonerCameron> @johncrossmirror @MirrorFootball Who did he tell? Funny the article doesn't mention a name or any quote. Almost makes u think it's utter horseshit. #FatassCrossy
921123372024569856 2017-10-19 21:18:20 UTC <GoonerCameron> Instead of bitching, how bout you start a pharmaceutical company and give away treatments for free?https://twitter.com/sensanders/status/921110401517015040

919268693497954304 2017-10-14 18:28:30 UTC <GoonerCameron> @dboehringer Wenger has slowly but surely ripped the soul out of our club. So incredibly sad.

903717299407904768 2017-09-01 20:32:49 UTC <GoonerCameron> @johncrossmirror John is the ultimate . @MrDtAFC calls him "a little bitch" and I genuinely can't think of a better description. Simple. Succinct.
903368471668441088 2017-08-31 21:26:42 UTC <GoonerCameron> @davidelizarraga I'm saying that he'll become an amazing player now that wenger isn't destroying his potential. He'd never flourish under wenger but will now
903335887433379840 2017-08-31 19:17:13 UTC <GoonerCameron> Ox scored 9 PL goals in 6 years. So naturally he'll now score a hat trick in his first game against Arsenal. #afc #liverpool
903222588578480128 2017-08-31 11:47:00 UTC <GoonerCameron> @Arsenal But... Wenger promised "Ox will not be sold. 100%!" Are you saying wenger is a piece of shit liar, Arsenal?
903087125519679488 2017-08-30 02:48:43 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon AFC - "We have 100 mil to spend on Mbappe!" *AFC make 70 mil selling players AFC - "We have no money for players" You have to simply laugh

849858550817898498 2017-04-05 05:37:22 UTC <GoonerCameron> Truly insane how this wasn't called a penalty. Won't see a worse missed call for years.https://twitter.com/dariendude2/status/849804044042477568

848723990696804352 2017-04-02 02:29:02 UTC <GoonerCameron> @chandlerriggs Beautiful ending. Perfect writing, acting, music, and cinematography. Epic, epic finale
845859539123560448 2017-03-25 04:46:44 UTC <GoonerCameron> @MLRobbie it would be funny if it was original. It's copying "Boaty McBoat face" which the Internet chose for a polar research ship in 2016.
845278652732387328 2017-03-24 14:18:29 UTC <GoonerCameron> number 1 trolling account of all time. Congrats, @Arsenal
843201467024457728 2017-03-18 20:44:30 UTC <GoonerCameron> @ClipsonOfficial @HeavyHeavyd because Wenger signs them, picks them, tells them how/where to play, and motivates them. 100% down to manager.
842962766071660544 2017-03-17 04:55:59 UTC <GoonerCameron> @theowalcott @Arsenal the ONLY player you should do this for is Alexis. Asking fans to rate others is just a recipe for disaster.
842236604508852224 2017-03-15 04:50:29 UTC <GoonerCameron> @theblaze the craziest thing about this is learning bow wow still exists.

839635934043779072 2017-03-08 00:36:21 UTC <GoonerCameron> @Stillberto @PlanetArse luv how he first grabs his head then his throat. Its so hard making split second decisions on how to deceive the ref
839222336997859330 2017-03-07 21:12:51 UTC <GoonerCameron> I'll never forget RVP getting red carded for shooting the ball at goal. Lmao. Disgusting bias #Uefahttps://twitter.com/jasafc/status/839220453533184005

826546636557922304 2017-01-31 21:44:09 UTC <GoonerCameron> @CallMeKinslow Yup. Same shit, different year. Funny how we all expected things to be different when they havent been for 12 yrs. insanity.
823209046953992192 2017-01-22 16:41:45 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SibsMUFC lmao! United have scored EIGHT goals that should have been offsides this season. Please stop making a fool of yourself. Thanks.

817823771704758272 2017-01-07 20:02:36 UTC <GoonerCameron> @johncrossmirror by "some Arsenal fans" I think you mean "Piers Morgan." Hes not a fan. Hes a tub of lard who in no way represents us fans.

810585969497776128 2016-12-18 20:42:09 UTC <GoonerCameron> @YouTube @ArsenalFanTV Arsenal could get relegated and Chris would still say Wenger is the right man for the job. Absolute knob
810544977914654720 2016-12-18 17:59:16 UTC <GoonerCameron> Prove to Alexis that we are shit so he'll leave and we dont have to pay him. Bold strategy from wenger, lets see if it pays off, Cotton #afc
810532515937034240 2016-12-18 17:09:45 UTC <GoonerCameron> @hughwizzy just as offsides as monreal on iwobi's goal. Zero consistency from the refs. Pathetic

808790099479568384 2016-12-13 21:46:00 UTC <GoonerCameron> @CallMeKinslow Ref didn't "miss" it. He purposely didn't give it. I've never seen clatt treat Arsenal fairly. Just never happens. Ever.

794275754225696768 2016-11-03 20:31:11 UTC <GoonerCameron> @ArsenalMoh8 not with the Specialist In Failure leading them. Maybe if they spend another 200 mil they'll be able to compete in Europa.

779731004802027520 2016-09-24 17:15:32 UTC <GoonerCameron> Ozil, Alexis and Walcott been absolutely world class today! Quite possibly the best half of football I've ever seen.

731876965007773696 2016-05-15 16:00:40 UTC <GoonerCameron> #Spurs fans, you might wanna stay off social media today. #sttotteringhamsday #Spursareshit #FOYS
731875986032070656 2016-05-15 15:56:47 UTC <GoonerCameron> @benbowmania @ArsenalGent HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! #FOYS #ForeverInOurShadow
728695603727769601 2016-05-06 21:19:05 UTC <GoonerCameron> @BillNye but @SarahPalinUSA says climate change is a hoax. Shes the smartest person ever so you (and 97% of scientists) must be lying, Bill.
728292645911572481 2016-05-05 18:37:52 UTC <GoonerCameron> I'm actually convinced Sarah Palin is a genius troll. There's simply no way anyone could be so stupid.http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/jimmy-kimmel-climate-change_us_5728b36fe4b016f378938745#
728003890868850693 2016-05-04 23:30:27 UTC <GoonerCameron> @DeejayDt 27 mins in "what reason have you got for wanting Wenger out?" Lmao! U might as well have debated a brick wall, DT
727266262422802432 2016-05-02 22:39:23 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon @PhileasFoggs @LCFC exactly, Luis! Why do people complain about the sport growing?!
727254573027577857 2016-05-02 21:52:56 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon there's no analogy we can give Americans because there's literally never been anything this great to compare it to!
726622957070520323 2016-04-30 04:03:07 UTC <GoonerCameron> @Mesutholic shows Wenger has lost the respect of the players. Sad to see.
726552709633970176 2016-04-30 23:23:59 UTC <GoonerCameron> @ArsenalFanTV love this guy! Most level headed supporter you interview. Much respect.
725815416723894273 2016-04-28 22:34:15 UTC <GoonerCameron> @Arsenal Giroud. Playing him is the same as playing with 10 men.
724736117157711872 2016-04-25 23:05:29 UTC <GoonerCameron> @davidelizarraga I prefer FOYFCF (fuck off you fucking cunt fucks) #spurs #shit
723323541219725312 2016-04-21 01:32:25 UTC <GoonerCameron> @DeejayDt "if Theo leaves I'll offer him a lift. Or else he'd get lost and drive into a wall." Lol, great line!
723016303053692928 2016-04-20 05:11:34 UTC <GoonerCameron> @__arsenalnews_ but we don't need a striker because Wenger says giroud is world class 
722238341777793024 2016-04-18 01:40:13 UTC <GoonerCameron> Gonna be pretty ironic when that welbeck goal that should have won us the league ends up causing Spurs to win it. #Arsenal #WengerOut
721889507826503680 2016-04-17 02:34:05 UTC <GoonerCameron> @GoonerClaude @ArsenalFanTV good interview @goonerclaude totally agree with you
721882429191917569 2016-04-17 02:05:57 UTC <GoonerCameron> @Arsenal I swear to god Arsenal, no one trolls Arsenal fans more than you do! Why? WHY do you troll your own fans?! #WTF
721803453530394624 2016-04-17 20:52:08 UTC <GoonerCameron> @ArsenalFanTV the fact that guy can't end a sentence without "fam" or "blood" caused me to miss everything he said. Very distracting.
721224323025887232 2016-04-15 06:30:52 UTC <GoonerCameron> @Arsenal @MesutOzil1088 love Ozil but Wenger is wrong. Pfa should go to a player whos helped his team accomplish something. Vardy or mahrez
720735971700936704 2016-04-14 22:10:20 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon not an asshole statement at all! Quite level-headed statement, actually. Shows you're not ignorant to the basics of economics.
718222607464730625 2016-04-07 23:43:08 UTC <GoonerCameron> @GoonerClaude @ryangould4 @goonerclaude @ArsenalFanTV @westhamfantv I agree! He's funny and I like him  I was just saying he's not the greatest debater.
718152795338072064 2016-04-07 19:05:43 UTC <GoonerCameron> @ArsenalFanTV @westhamfantv please have a competent Arsenal supporter debate next time. Love Claude's passion, but he's not the brightest
716111917400522752 2016-04-01 03:56:00 UTC <GoonerCameron> @johncrossmirror won't blame either of them for leaving. Wenger/Board have no ambition. They just care about balancing the books.
713550318521331712 2016-03-25 02:17:07 UTC <GoonerCameron> @johncrossmirror they want to keep him to make money, not to win titles. They don't give a shit about winning.  is all that matters
712083929277161472 2016-03-21 01:10:13 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon @kasafc I wouldn't refer to those people as "Arsenal folk". I prefer "idiotic douche fucks".
711218627555381248 2016-03-19 15:51:49 UTC <GoonerCameron> @aunderscorek oi mate, you know bugger all! Wenger done lost da plot n ur takin da piss out me? Chat shit get banged, ya wankah
711208484256096257 2016-03-19 15:11:30 UTC <GoonerCameron> Can we transfer Walcotts wages to Iwobi and be done with it? That possible? Come on, Wenger, figure out a way. #Arsenal #Iwobi
710221585387393026 2016-03-16 21:49:55 UTC <GoonerCameron> @FresnoGooners I'm sure he'll talk about our "great spirit" and "mental strength" and blah blah blah. He's just a broken record now
709941049997692930 2016-03-15 03:15:11 UTC <GoonerCameron> @johncrossmirror if hes hungry for success why did he refuse to buy a single outfield player? I'm sick of his bullshit. He's all talk now
709611563565457409 2016-03-14 05:25:55 UTC <GoonerCameron> @Arsenal @adrianjclarke no need to waste 7 mins watching that. Here's the better analysis: We are shit.
709508932130066432 2016-03-14 22:38:06 UTC <GoonerCameron> @Arsenal @mertesacker please stop trolling your own fans #Arsenal it's really insulting. Stop posting for a while. Just stop.
709381616154468356 2016-03-14 14:12:11 UTC <GoonerCameron> @Arsenal @mertesacker "we have to do this... We have to do that..." All talk and no walk. Stfu and perform @Arsenal ! No more empty words
709207853555273728 2016-03-13 02:41:43 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon I did as well :-( the finish line was right there and we choked. Absolutely bottled it. Most depressing season I can remember 
709060327141289985 2016-03-13 16:55:30 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon @Arsenal how amazingly delusional! I wonder if he truly believes his own bullshit.
709040642928693249 2016-03-13 15:37:17 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon lol. Idk why but this gave me a good laugh.
709032302123180032 2016-03-13 15:04:08 UTC <GoonerCameron> @dboehringer all that damn oil money of watford.
708369043648937984 2016-03-11 19:08:35 UTC <GoonerCameron> @funnyordie @SarahKSilverman anyone can be compared to Hitler if you try.pic.twitter.com/gkBjitXaV9
708067328756322304 2016-03-10 23:09:41 UTC <GoonerCameron> @rioferdy5 haha. #exgreatclub
707630337665269760 2016-03-09 18:13:14 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon totally agree. I dont share his feelings but I see where hes coming from. We all love Arsenal and should respect everyones opinions
705176218769956864 2016-03-02 23:41:26 UTC <GoonerCameron> @PascalZidane did more than Walcott the last few games.
705129806283862016 2016-03-02 20:37:01 UTC <GoonerCameron> @dboehringer nothing to see here. Go about your day.pic.twitter.com/irillouP8C
705125243132768256 2016-03-02 20:18:53 UTC <GoonerCameron> @CallMeKinslow dominate, dominate, dominate, dominate, lose. Yay, Arsenal!
704778943530995712 2016-03-01 21:22:48 UTC <GoonerCameron> @Paulthehammer79 @SDGoon lmao, that's the easiest offsides call you'll ever make. Check that lino's wallet for some Abromovich 
704758273233264640 2016-03-01 20:00:40 UTC <GoonerCameron> @aunderscorek Oliver's show kicks ass! His "Fifa" and "draft kings" episodes are genius!
704102838427852800 2016-02-28 00:36:12 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon can't blame either of them if they leave. We all know wenger won't sign the world class players we need.
702312512516022272 2016-02-23 02:02:05 UTC <GoonerCameron> @Memz_Dogi so Silent Stan can buy more mansions and yachts. Duh.
702259093432446977 2016-02-23 22:29:49 UTC <GoonerCameron> @__arsenalnews_ let's be clear, we didn't lose due to Barca's theatrics. Nonetheless, their diving/whining is a disgrace to football.
698981674604834816 2016-02-14 21:26:32 UTC <GoonerCameron> @__arsenalnews_ Pires and Henry did that too. Err... Tried
698876154585829377 2016-02-14 14:27:14 UTC <GoonerCameron> @davidelizarraga feels like a cup win. Haven't celebrated like that since Ramsey's winning goal against hull
698275117214732288 2016-02-12 22:38:55 UTC <GoonerCameron> @Fenerbahce @Persie_Official RVP, remember when you were relevant?
696487454430273536 2016-02-07 00:15:23 UTC <GoonerCameron> @MelissaRycroft wagon hopper 
696487080545751040 2016-02-07 00:13:54 UTC <GoonerCameron> @davidelizarraga @nflcommish nfl is so corrupt. They gotta make sure manning gets his ring for the ratings/money.
696434646582562816 2016-02-07 20:45:33 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon @TheRealJayC @amadoit he's a sad man. Launches personal attacks on strangers over simple questions. Sign of a man who has lost it.
696382322216538112 2016-02-07 17:17:38 UTC <GoonerCameron> @__arsenalnews_ too bad it wasn't Costa 
693247539106168832 2016-01-29 01:41:07 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon I don't care anymore. I just want to stop seeing Spanos' fugly ass face.
691645175815221248 2016-01-25 15:33:54 UTC <GoonerCameron> @SDGoon we all knew going into the season that an injury to Coq would cost us the league. Wenger gambled and lost by not buying 
691422496512323584 2016-01-24 00:49:03 UTC <GoonerCameron> @Davrinho disgusting cunts. Everything about Chelsea is classless. Fans, owner, players, everything!
691389403407609857 2016-01-24 22:37:33 UTC <GoonerCameron> @Mouhazard lmao! Wow, you're an idiot. Trade the best minute-per-goal striker in the prem for a cheating ogre who scores half the goals? ok
691318834544799744 2016-01-24 17:57:08 UTC <GoonerCameron> Wenger made the mistake of playing per. Then made mistake of subbing giroud. Hate to say it, wenger fucked up  #AFCvCFC #arsenal
