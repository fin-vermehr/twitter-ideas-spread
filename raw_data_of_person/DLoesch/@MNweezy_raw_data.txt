970387008471355392 2018-03-04 19:54:26 UTC <MNweezy> @OwenBenjamin When they came to power, the Nazis used whatever gun records they had to seize weapons from their enemies.  But no...gun control stops evil...like for realz.

969729186255507457 2018-03-02 00:20:29 UTC <MNweezy> @scrowder I love my state, but really hate having to watch everything I say.  I cant stand the overwhelming ultra left population around me...

969718398144995333 2018-03-02 23:37:37 UTC <MNweezy> @PSchrags @Vikings Funny.  When I said the same thing here on Twitter about Cousins and Keenum, @PAOnTheMic disagreed with me.  When someone from the NFL network says it, he quietly agrees...
969660739442167814 2018-03-02 19:48:30 UTC <MNweezy> @RottenTomatoes Ouch.  Maybe Jennifer Lawrence SHOULD step away from acting to save the world...

969381087666409472 2018-03-01 01:17:16 UTC <MNweezy> @Vikings @casekeenum7 @NickSwardson @duckbrian If the deal is structured right, we wouldnt have to lose anyone.  A good chunk could be given in bonuses, and it could be backend heavy so they could resign everyone, while having a growing cap every year.
969367723061989376 2018-03-01 00:24:09 UTC <MNweezy> @Vikings @casekeenum7 @NickSwardson @duckbrian And Cousins did all that on bad teams without a #1 Defense, and without a decent O-Line, and even threw for over 4000 yards with a bad receiving corps and terrible O line.  Put him with a #1 D, Diggs, Thielen, Rudolph, Cook and Murray...the guy will be stellar
969367251026698241 2018-03-01 00:22:17 UTC <MNweezy> @Vikings @casekeenum7 @NickSwardson @duckbrian I say Cousins. 3 straight years of playing 16 games, with 4000+ yards and 20+ TDs.  We have 50 mil in cap space, and the cap space is supposed to raise by about 11 million on top of that.  We can get our core resigned and still sign Cousins.  Maybe give him a back end loaded deal

969365450810421248 2018-03-01 00:15:08 UTC <MNweezy> @Vikings @casekeenum7 @NickSwardson @duckbrian No way should we pay him even 17-18mil after ONE good season.
969357364154511360 2018-03-01 23:43:00 UTC <MNweezy> @Vikings 40 games and 1 playoff win.  We need to take the next step, Zim.  Average QBs arent going to win us a Super Bowl.

968283321712173057 2018-02-26 00:35:08 UTC <MNweezy> @Gil_Brandt @MikeGarafolo @RapSheet @ChrisWesseling @MikeMichael00 @Jerryjdub Really?  Kirk has had 3 straight 4,000 yd+ seasons all with 20+ TDs with 0 injuries...Keenum has had only 3 seasons over 1,000 yards - the most being 3,500 this year.  Better than Kirk?  I think not.
968282030474743813 2018-02-26 00:30:00 UTC <MNweezy> @redsteeze Lol.  Soo...all legal weapons?  Good luck.
968281795841216512 2018-02-26 00:29:04 UTC <MNweezy> @Cstew_7 Gonna miss you, man!  Love the effort you gave us the last few years.  You always grind your ass off and give it your all.  Youll give your new team plenty of tenacity and grit...the grit we still need...which is why Im still confused about the move...

Also, we saw how great he was in the NFC champ game when the super bowl was on the line.  Dont get me wrong, I like the guy...but in no way is he our future.

968278009953378304 2018-02-26 00:14:01 UTC <MNweezy> @SenFeinstein @JackMsndoghouse Right?  Arent they the ones who argue men cant make laws about abortion because they dont bear children?
968275928278294534 2018-02-26 00:05:45 UTC <MNweezy> @DenLibertarian 1) 4 year olds can take adderall 2) 6 year olds can decide gender 3) 16 year olds can vote 4) 18 year olds arent adult enough to own a gun 5) 21 year olds are just adult enough to have a beer 6) 25 year olds are just adult enough to rent a car
968167349949009920 2018-02-26 16:54:18 UTC <MNweezy> @AroundTheNFL And I guarantee Ill play in the NFL, NHL, NBA, and MLB this year.

967856584113246210 2018-02-25 20:19:26 UTC <MNweezy> @RealJamesWoods Although, you can argue that conservatives dont stay conservative with spending when the votes dont matter.  Also, too many conservatives are trying to give into gun control right now.  It happens on both sides.

965787112019775488 2018-02-19 03:16:05 UTC <MNweezy> @Michael_Fabiano Cousins, Landry, and Bell to Cleveland...I mean, they have the cap.

One of the best qbrs in the league under pressure.  He was actually great in the pocket.  Like against the saints when he danced for 10 seconds up and back to create time.
958552441217273856 2018-01-30 04:08:05 UTC <MNweezy> @KillebrewDj @PAOnTheMic I just dont trust paying Case 18+ Mil after 1 good season.  The only other logical idea I have is keep Teddy if he takes very little money, and draft a couple QBs.
958549760083939328 2018-01-30 03:57:26 UTC <MNweezy> @KillebrewDj @PAOnTheMic I like Keenum, but he had one great year & got exposed in the NFC champ game.  Teddy n Sam are both a ? on ever being able to survive a full season...or even half.  We lose some huge contracts letting Teddy and Sam walk.  And we have one of the highest cap spaces in the league.

956784523764813824 2018-01-25 07:03:01 UTC <MNweezy> @PAOnTheMic @Vikings @GregTKaiser And no run game.  Put him with Cook, Murray, Thielen, Diggs, Rudolph, and a phenomenal O line...you have yourself a Home run
956784291681366016 2018-01-25 07:02:05 UTC <MNweezy> @PAOnTheMic @Vikings @GregTKaiser 3 straight seasons (since being a starter) with 4,000+ yards, 20+ TDs, not 1 missed start, performing on a team with a history of being terrible.  + this year, the injuries to the Redskins (OL in particular) and no receivers (Jordan Reid out most of the year) & he still delivers
956771953293086721 2018-01-25 06:13:04 UTC <MNweezy> @fitbit @Timberwolves Or no defense minus Mr. Buckets.

931196327496765441 2017-11-16 16:24:39 UTC <MNweezy> @SpiritAirlines No specific details.  Its just the fact that your bags cost so much, and you also charge to print your boarding pass at the gate, and you charge for everything mid-flight.  With all the extra penny pinching costs it would be more worth it to go to another airline.
931056459630219264 2017-11-15 07:08:52 UTC <MNweezy> @SpiritAirlines you know why capitalism is so awesome?  Because eventually when enough people realize how terrible your penny pinching airline is...youll lose money and be forced to adapt or go bankrupt. $50 to check a bag!?!? Get outta here!

920896891516317697 2017-10-18 06:18:23 UTC <MNweezy> @Timberwolves Also looked like the wolves dunked their hands in grease before every possession in the 3rd.
920896468554342400 2017-10-18 06:16:42 UTC <MNweezy> @Timberwolves I said the same thing.  They need some time...but they looked like they had no confidence, and had no idea where people were supposed to be.

911472938523742209 2017-09-22 06:10:57 UTC <MNweezy> @jemelehill @KarenthePeach @leroyunlimited And what you don't get is the NFL is a business.  Name a business that likes negative attention and distraction from their goals. I'll wait.
911472236330176512 2017-09-22 06:08:10 UTC <MNweezy> @jemelehill Just so we're clear you can get the hell out if you don't like this country...you're free to leave whenever you like
911448747648929793 2017-09-22 04:34:49 UTC <MNweezy> @MJD @jemelehill Espn should just change their name to CNN

911236077532442625 2017-09-22 14:29:45 UTC <MNweezy> @RealJamesWoods Then The Washington Post turns it into this:https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/posteverything/wp/2017/09/21/we-dont-think-michelle-jones-could-change-because-we-see-black-moms-as-monsters/
911035226469445632 2017-09-21 01:11:38 UTC <MNweezy> @Dameshek @Michael_Fabiano Both of their color rush jerseys are so much better than their regular ones.
910903828773564416 2017-09-21 16:29:31 UTC <MNweezy> @scrowder Let's not forget.  Kimmel got his big break on the Man Show.  I'm surprised the left hasn't chastised him for it
910494137283162112 2017-09-20 13:21:33 UTC <MNweezy> @scrowder 60 percent of the time it works every time.
910493212720189440 2017-09-20 13:17:52 UTC <MNweezy> @benshapiro At this point I think it would be better to let it fail. That way people REALLY realize how shitty it really is, and the GOP can't be blamed

908937082730622976 2017-09-15 06:14:22 UTC <MNweezy> @LennoxLewis @ShadowLeagueTSL @teamwaine @JayJoe12 It's an issue of distracting a locker room.  It's an issue of not putting your team first...distracting your team from the ultimate goal

905096373086846977 2017-09-05 15:52:45 UTC <MNweezy> @gmfb Am I crazy for thinking Jameis Winston will be MVP?
904870005845745665 2017-09-04 00:53:15 UTC <MNweezy> @MJD MJD, I would say you...but Dez is a bad tackle away from missing 5 weeks, Zeke out possibly 6 weeks, and ODB nursing that ankle...

902938931469193217 2017-08-30 16:59:51 UTC <MNweezy> @MatthewBerryTMR I don't like Marshall.  ODB and Shep...and Engram.  Too many bodies for ample targets.
