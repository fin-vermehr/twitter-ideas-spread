The buyback consisted of buying back the guns while gov't created a Medicare levy, which increased taxes to make up for the government outlay in the initial gun buyback.

At one point, about 15 years ago I thought about moving to Australia and the requirements were stringent! I'm sorry that is happening to your country.
969520066084548608 2018-03-02 10:29:31 UTC <DMinorRocks> @germ_nation1 In other words, Australia is allowing the refugees to take over your country. I hope that it's not as bad as Europe. My partner lived near Adelaide...Victor Harbor. Are you living in a larger city?

969513659192942593 2018-03-02 10:04:03 UTC <DMinorRocks> @TomiLahren It's not at all acceptable but look at the demographics of the region.
969512700630847488 2018-03-02 10:00:15 UTC <DMinorRocks> @mike_Zollo @SonsMary They should have learned from his tenure as Governor of CA in the late 70's/early 80's.   On the other hand, the demographics have changed tremendously so I suppose Jerry Brown being elected again was inevitable. Either way, it's very sad to see such a beautiful state go to hell.
969511023987212289 2018-03-02 09:53:35 UTC <DMinorRocks> @Corp125Vet It is happening to me too.  Especially when I fave and retweet the President's twitter account.

I left CA in 1979. Asking for a friend (my partner), who is an ex-Aussie, now U.S. citizen...have things changed that much in Australia???
969504686951710720 2018-03-02 09:28:24 UTC <DMinorRocks> @GayRepublicSwag Ignoring CA's defiance sets a dangerous precedent.

963331234423189505 2018-02-13 08:37:18 UTC <DMinorRocks> @ThomasWictor @RealAronBrowne Particularly the "artist" that did the Obama portrait.   He has a penchant for painting black people holding severed heads of white people.  Fits Obama perfectly.

963204040766103558 2018-02-12 00:11:53 UTC <DMinorRocks> @RealJamesWoods It seems to have a connection with PERSONAL FAILURE and Donald Trump is a very visible target to project blame onto.   The MSM media fuels this projection in an obscene manner. Just my opinion based on observation of many liberals.

957709514978967552 2018-01-28 20:18:36 UTC <DMinorRocks> @RealJamesWoods #BoycottHollywood Due to fame, celebrities do have a bigger voice than 99% of the people in the country. What they have to say and what they do can have a negative or positive influence on society. John Lennon knew how to exploit his fame... So did Jane Fonda...
957702065416843269 2018-01-28 19:49:00 UTC <DMinorRocks> @ThomasJankow @pollsofpolitics @joannenj Well, since construction of the wall has already begun in my region of the U.S. and has been proven to reduce crime I guess we'll wait and see. Outside of my region the wall is 95% effective in San Diego. These successes are stupid?

957050376011726848 2018-01-26 00:39:25 UTC <DMinorRocks> @realDonaldTrump @USAFirst55 I think it will happen.   The Dems aren't accepting any proposals. The right has everything to gain and nothing to lose at this point in time. The Dems are backed up against a wall. However, if Congress doesn't act, I agree.  We will be bombarded again.

956945219877924864 2018-01-26 17:41:34 UTC <DMinorRocks> @realDonaldTrump @USAFirst55 @chromecowboy I never claimed that there weren't some knots to be worked out. I'm stating what I would accept.  I could accept a DACA for 1.6-1.8 million if it got the rest of the illegals out of the country and those remaining were on a merit based system.
956943739183759360 2018-01-26 17:35:41 UTC <DMinorRocks> @RealJamesWoods PERFECT!!!
956939859410632705 2018-01-26 17:20:16 UTC <DMinorRocks> @bdclq C'mon   You KNOW it's true!!!
956938078551031808 2018-01-26 17:13:11 UTC <DMinorRocks> @realDonaldTrump @USAFirst55 I don't completely agree. I prefer to have the border wall to keep out future illegal aliens, end chain migration, anchor babies, deport and/or lock up remaining illegals, alienate Latinos from Dem base, voter ID, etc. in exchange for 1.6 DACA recipients. #BuildTheWall
956936638151585792 2018-01-26 17:07:28 UTC <DMinorRocks> @Rockprincess818 But how many "normal folks" are there? Scary. #BuildTheWall

956928017648906240 2018-01-26 16:33:12 UTC <DMinorRocks> @SteveKingIA I don't entirely agree. If only 1.6 million DACA's are allowed to stay, a state of the art border wall is constructed so that no more can cross in, eliminate anchor baby status, institute reliable voter ID and chain migration...I think it's worth considering. #BuildTheWall

956330274081595392 2018-01-24 00:57:59 UTC <DMinorRocks> @Education4Libs Two VERY excellent observations!
956325404469374977 2018-01-24 00:38:38 UTC <DMinorRocks> @DNC @clivebushjd I get the feeling that President Trump won't be required to appear at all.  #MuellerInvestigation will be dead in the water.
956323692186804224 2018-01-24 00:31:50 UTC <DMinorRocks> @Imperator_Rex3 Good grief.  Clutching at straws...again.

956304097874886656 2018-01-24 23:13:58 UTC <DMinorRocks> @Education4Libs @TerriSm18802157 I think you need to expand your research.  Illegal aliens account for a disproportionate percentage of the prison population.

956197827083816963 2018-01-24 16:11:41 UTC <DMinorRocks> @Education4Libs Beg your pardon. They are criminals by virtue of unconstitutional EO signed by Barack Obama. Obama may have promised it.  Most Americans don't want it.

955379176084717568 2018-01-22 09:58:40 UTC <DMinorRocks> @RealJamesWoods IF @POTUS wants a second term he will do what he promised and build a wall to protect U.S. citizens.  That's not a threat...it's a fact, in my opinion. Isn't he supposed to view the prototypes of the wall at the end of January? #BuildTheWall

953072885333020672 2018-01-15 01:14:17 UTC <DMinorRocks> I watched a recent documentary (don't recall who made it) that stated that part of the major fault lines run down to the Salton Sea. The odd thing is that seismologists believe that a major earthquake (SS area) will move directly into the L.A. basin and bypass the immediate area.https://twitter.com/DestinyandBruce/status/952993171167989761

952816296520966144 2018-01-15 08:14:42 UTC <DMinorRocks> @ThomasSowell @eqmaverickpoet I wasn't being all-inclusive.   Also, I was not referring to Thomas's comment as BS.  Not at all. That was intended for the colleges that have lowered the bar to the extent that students leave school no better off than when they came in...nothing more than an extension of HS.
952814869018898432 2018-01-15 08:09:01 UTC <DMinorRocks> @TraficanteScott Clinton only had a surplus because of the dot. com bubble. In 2008, Obama stated that he would go through the budget "line by line" and eliminate wasteful spending. We all know how that worked out! NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP!!!

952805184429727746 2018-01-14 07:30:32 UTC <DMinorRocks> @joegooding Vaccines are dangerous.  Most do not need to be repeated.

Took thousands of $$$ and 10 years to become a U.S. citizen. DACA is illegal and unconstitutional.  No question about that.  I'm going to think positive because quite frankly, I want ALL illegals out. I'm willing to wait :)
948744728501039104 2018-01-03 02:35:44 UTC <DMinorRocks> @TuckerCarlson @greggutfeld @seanhannity @POTUS @1VirtualPixie That's a possibility.  I agree. I look at it differently and believe me it isn't easy.  I live in a blue state that is overridden with illegals and MS-13. (Not CA) I do believe that by tossing the issue back to Congress as an unconstitutional, illegal EO, DACA may be revoked.

DACA is the least of the problems that we're facing at this moment. The wall will get built one way or the other. I don't give a flip if Mexico pays for it because stopping flow of illegals into U.S. will stop $$$ paid to support them.

945118051162140672 2017-12-24 02:24:37 UTC <DMinorRocks> @realDonaldTrump @ChuckNASCAR I really don't agree.  He distracts the media and there is a public electronic trail of some pretty damning truths.
945117051529576448 2017-12-24 02:20:39 UTC <DMinorRocks> @RedNationRising He always has.  I lived in CA in the 70's when he was governor.  A disaster then, a disaster now.

Not at all happy with the Obama deal.   #NauruRefugees #ManusIslandRefugees (Muslims) being sent to the U.S.  President Trump called it a bad deal.  I guess he could not stop it?
944712845630906368 2017-12-23 23:34:28 UTC <DMinorRocks> @ScottPresler Absolutely. It is the corrupt upper echelon of the FBI that is a complete disgrace.

As I said, Amnesty Int'l has been after AU and has videos of the abuse of these people BUT we don't need them here!  We have our own citizens to take care of.  Thanks Obama

936147748235091968 2017-11-30 08:19:50 UTC <DMinorRocks> @realDonaldTrump @Vzladream @realdonaldtrump  Can we nix this deal with Australia that allows the Muslim refugees on Manus Island and Nauru to come to the U.S.?  Why is the U.S. honoring this destructive deal that #Obama made with #Australia? Don't let them come here...we have enough problems with Mexico!
936147005914603520 2017-11-30 08:16:53 UTC <DMinorRocks> @AnnCoulter @JxhnBinder @psat4 I totally agree and #Australia knows this.  These people have been in detention for 5 years and AU has violated Amnesty International rules for abuse.  Obama is the one that accepted this deal and I'm wondering, in exchange for what?  To get AU off the hook with Am Int'l?
936143750375514112 2017-11-30 08:03:57 UTC <DMinorRocks> According to 100 economists, U.S. economy would experience enormous growth with the new tax plan.

935981825511407616 2017-11-29 21:20:31 UTC <DMinorRocks> @RealMAGASteve Exactly right. Religious laws do not dictate state or federal law.  Separation of church and state.

935978435377278977 2017-11-29 21:07:03 UTC <DMinorRocks> @AnnCoulter @JxhnBinder @psat4 There is something more to it than meets the eye because President Trump clearly stated from the very beginning that we were getting a bad deal. Ditto!  I'm surprised the country is doing as well as it is after 8 years of Obama.  That was a close call and best of all, no Hillary!
935971637312270336 2017-11-29 20:40:02 UTC <DMinorRocks> @AnnCoulter @JxhnBinder @psat4 I 100% agree.   I do not understand why President Trump didn't end this "deal." Obama has not been interested in the safety of our citizens and the PM of AU, Malcolm Turnbull found an ideal solution in Obama, who has encouraged law breaking by not enforcing our immigration laws.

My husband is an Australian expat, now a U.S. citizen, and he has said that they would be killed if returned to their own countries. Nonetheless, it IS Australia's problem.

888616003793321984 2017-07-21 04:25:39 UTC <DMinorRocks> @TomiLahren @RealKyleMorris Acting doesn't require common sense or values.  It's acting.  Real life is elusive to celebrities.
888615416389447680 2017-07-21 04:23:19 UTC <DMinorRocks> @The_Trump_Train I find it amusing that the left feels that President Trump is mentally impaired.  The left needs to look in the mirror.

887888069512142848 2017-07-19 04:13:06 UTC <DMinorRocks> @blaubok Bernie has been living off of people and taxpayer dollars forever.  He's a leech.

887854617995780096 2017-07-19 02:00:11 UTC <DMinorRocks> @brandongroeny That's quite a stretch to assume that those types of hateful thoughts exist.  The left appears to be the ones spouting awful comments.
