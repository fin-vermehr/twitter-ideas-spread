970794252782284800 2018-03-05 22:52:41 UTC <CasimiroCedillo> @milabst I have my real American facts. Not opinions. Like Im not even the biggest gun fan but people are focused on guns which isnt the problem.
970793821490442240 2018-03-05 22:50:58 UTC <CasimiroCedillo> @milabst The second amendment stand for the right to bear arms. Making gun restrictions isnt gonna solve anything. How do criminals get crack? Illegally. How do criminals get guns? Illegally so since I destroyed your theory now what?

969668814123122688 2018-03-02 20:20:35 UTC <CasimiroCedillo> @milabst Yeah because if you have gun control all the criminals and crazy people are gonna magically start obeying the law 
969668277101240320 2018-03-02 20:18:27 UTC <CasimiroCedillo> @milabst Most of the gun related deaths are from suicide in USA, not school shootings. In America we have the 2nd amendment, so you cant take away guns. Thing about America is, we always rise above our enemies and problems. If Europe is so nice why does everyone keep coming to the USA.
969505230483148800 2018-03-02 09:30:34 UTC <CasimiroCedillo> @milabst its not the guns, its the people. If guns killed people then why hasnt any of the guns in my house killed me yet?Its who wields it.Therefore we need to have severe consequence for the people who do these attacks. guns arent the problem. Its the coward who do this to schools
