970062742693478402 2018-03-03 22:25:55 UTC <ChuckFinley05> @TuckerCarlson @SebGorka @DevinNunes Did you reply, "No. Daddy gets paid to have opposing press conferences with Adam Schiff. Daddy's does what he's told."
970059223748042758 2018-03-03 22:11:56 UTC <ChuckFinley05> I do admire a good " poking" with some humor. #2A #freedomhttps://twitter.com/DLoesch/status/969999933288927232
967776437116776448 2018-02-25 15:00:57 UTC <ChuckFinley05> .@AdamSchiffCA is as big of a joke as @DevinNunes. They both need to take a seat. The Congressional investigation of Russia tampering is worthless. God I can't stand the US House of Reps.https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-panel-releases-democrats-memo-defending-fbi-surveillance-of-ex-trump-campaign-aide/2018/02/24/4cff92f4-164f-11e8-92c9-376b4fe57ff7_story.html
965280181631045633 2018-02-18 17:41:43 UTC <ChuckFinley05> @DavidPepper @matthewjdowd Hate to be a buzzkill but that 537th kid did walk into a high school with an AR-15 and kill 17 of his fellow students. This argument, though moving in a tweet, is very flawed.

965207854666911744 2018-02-18 12:54:19 UTC <ChuckFinley05> Every time @RealDonalTrump says there was "no collusion" all I think about is @EricTrump & Jared Kushner meeting with those Russian spies.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/965205208191168512
964963230207619073 2018-02-17 20:42:16 UTC <ChuckFinley05> I was raised to believe the #USSR was our #ColdWar enemy. Yet this guy's kids meet with #Russian spies to collude on fixing an election. I'm a Republican but I'm a patriot first. This guy has to go. Someone needs to #primary him in 2020.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/964946611502747649
