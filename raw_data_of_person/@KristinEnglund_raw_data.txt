962172081076137984 2018-02-09 03:51:15 UTC <KristinEnglund> @allyhoden Ugh. The memory of watching Bob Costas with pink eye has me shuddering. He lost my trust, thats for sure.

955309637150171136 2018-01-21 05:22:20 UTC <KristinEnglund> I thought my mom just said goodnight to me from the other room. I had to stop myself mid-response when I realized she was actually saying goodnight to #Alexa.  On that note...goodnight, Twitter.
954972045904957440 2018-01-20 07:00:52 UTC <KristinEnglund> @wahlskog It Takes Two and Parent Trap?

953633001937698817 2018-01-17 14:19:59 UTC <KristinEnglund> My 95yo grandpa called the @kingarthurflour Bakers Hotline for advice & shared stories of his grandpa bread & the people he visits with in the community. That chat made his day, but the surprise package he received later really tickled us! Thanks @kingarthurflour! #BakeforGoodpic.twitter.com/LbnVNpQmBz

943709652616966145 2017-12-20 05:08:09 UTC <KristinEnglund> This may be the oddest observation ever, but in the first four seasons of @Suits_USA, two different men guess the middle names of two different women and choose Victoria. Both times, they are wrong, but it still stuck out to me, one Kristin Victoria.  #bestmiddlename
