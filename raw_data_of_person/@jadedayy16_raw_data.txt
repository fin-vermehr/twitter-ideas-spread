762992017026744320 2016-08-09 12:40:47 UTC <jadedayy16> Tbh half blood prince is probably the funniest Harry Potter film, especially because Harry is so awkward around Ginny
762991545624690688 2016-08-09 12:38:54 UTC <jadedayy16> Harry and Ron talking about Ginny and Hermione's skin is the funniest thing in half blood prince

761543385496813568 2016-08-05 12:44:26 UTC <jadedayy16> Literally can't even be bothered to deal with racists Sometimes,Not worth itpic.twitter.com/fXjh4aooyv
761540860542529536 2016-08-05 12:34:24 UTC <jadedayy16> @LukeTOPLAD never said that. Not ignoring it. No one should kill anyone. But we can talk about and change more than one issue at a time
761538884052389888 2016-08-05 12:26:33 UTC <jadedayy16> @LukeTOPLAD way we are going to get desperately needed to change to dismantle the systematic racism that is present in today's society
761538761591234561 2016-08-05 12:26:04 UTC <jadedayy16> @LukeTOPLAD it's not ignorant. It's justice. To stand up to racism that black people face everyday by protesting, talking etc is the only
761537171136339968 2016-08-05 12:19:44 UTC <jadedayy16> @LukeTOPLAD black lives do matter.  racism in police is a very important&apparent issue& we shouldn't put it aside to address other issues.
761535645873504260 2016-08-05 12:13:41 UTC <jadedayy16> @LukeTOPLAD maybeyou have never said a racist remark urself but complainingabout the movement or ignoring the need for change is wrong.
761535222265643008 2016-08-05 12:12:00 UTC <jadedayy16> @LukeTOPLAD anyone who ignores or try's to justify their murders &the officers not being charged is adding to the normalisation of racism
761534939057819649 2016-08-05 12:10:52 UTC <jadedayy16> @LukeTOPLAD by white police officers for low or no know threat. Situations that if the person was white, would of been handled differently
761534758673387521 2016-08-05 12:10:09 UTC <jadedayy16> @LukeTOPLAD the systematic racism that is apparent in the police in America is awful. Many black men, women and children have been murdered
761534448064225280 2016-08-05 12:08:55 UTC <jadedayy16> @LukeTOPLAD I'm not gonna use percentages&numbers to explain myself but it's impossible to ignore the unlawful killings that have happened.
761532123169886208 2016-08-05 11:59:41 UTC <jadedayy16> Just because it is not happening here to the same extreme as in The USA doesn't mean we cannot protest &fight for justice #BlackLivesMatter
761531736668966912 2016-08-05 11:58:09 UTC <jadedayy16> People will support the movement until it becomes an Inconvenience to them, and then their racist sides come out  #BlackLivesMatter
761531439418576896 2016-08-05 11:56:58 UTC <jadedayy16> The absolute vile and disgusting comments being made about the protesters and the movement is sicking.  #BlackLivesMatter

758382073384173568 2016-07-27 19:22:31 UTC <jadedayy16> Her gender cannot excuse the shitty and truly awful things she has done and said and will do.
758381871948521472 2016-07-27 19:21:42 UTC <jadedayy16> Just because Hilary is a woman in a high political role doesn't mean she's automatically a feminist icon. Woman can be shitty too.

746233338986258432 2016-06-23 06:47:47 UTC <jadedayy16> Also do people who voted leave realise it's gonna take a MINIMUM of 2 years to actually leave the EU?

739830430363463680 2016-06-06 14:44:54 UTC <jadedayy16> It will effect our jobs, education, travel, economy e.t.c yet those who are voting leave only care about money and immigration
739827585790664704 2016-06-06 14:33:36 UTC <jadedayy16> Really pisses me off that 16 & 17 year olds can't vote. It's our future & it's being decide without consideration to how it will effect us

737731619805618176 2016-05-31 19:44:59 UTC <jadedayy16> How do people think it's okay to hate on a religion and individuals for actions that they have had no part in and oppose
737730548068679680 2016-05-31 19:40:43 UTC <jadedayy16> Muslims have the right to practise their religion safely and without fear for their lives.
737730058211758084 2016-05-31 19:38:46 UTC <jadedayy16> Islamaphobes are so ignorant and full of hate for people they do not know.

735898297848758272 2016-05-26 18:20:01 UTC <jadedayy16> The amount of ridiculous scaremongering & scapegoating from both sides (mainly the leave campaign) is just so wrong.

728011610489561094 2016-05-04 00:01:08 UTC <jadedayy16> @mancmourinho @MancMourinho @piersmorgan maybe tell the people sexualising woman to stop rather then telling woman to cover up
728010651407405056 2016-05-04 23:57:19 UTC <jadedayy16> @mancmourinho @MancMourinho @piersmorgan wow, All I'm saying is stop shaming woman for their right to their own bodies.
728009681713696768 2016-05-04 23:53:28 UTC <jadedayy16> @mancmourinho @MancMourinho @piersmorgan a woman's body isn't a sexual object. Please stay in your lane and don't be so sexist 
728008852050956288 2016-05-04 23:50:10 UTC <jadedayy16> @mancmourinho @MancMourinho @piersmorgan  if you agree with anything sexist he says then you too are being sexist. stop shaming woman&attacking feminists
728007864044933120 2016-05-04 23:46:15 UTC <jadedayy16> @mancmourinho @MancMourinho @piersmorgan a woman's right to her own body is doing feminism right. If a man can go shirtless then so can a woman
728007294814916608 2016-05-04 23:43:59 UTC <jadedayy16> @mancmourinho @MancMourinho @piersmorgan they're not selling their body &even if they were let a woman do whatever she wants. It's her body, her decision

726849693880356864 2016-05-01 19:04:05 UTC <jadedayy16> It is also very important for children to have role models and someone to look up to who are from the LGBT+ community #GiveElsaAGirlfriend
726849332893327361 2016-05-01 19:02:39 UTC <jadedayy16> straight/cis youth will be more open and understanding of others sexuality&gender and eventually stop discrimination against LGBT+community
726848930055606273 2016-05-01 19:01:03 UTC <jadedayy16> If children are educated about how sexuality&gender is fluid then LGBT+ kids will feel so more comfortable about exploring their sexuality
726848321835421698 2016-05-01 18:58:38 UTC <jadedayy16> Parents should stop assuming their children are straight & teach their kids about the different sexualities & genders & how it's okay.
726847544995749888 2016-05-01 18:55:33 UTC <jadedayy16> There is such a stigma around coming out &I believe that 'coming out' makes LGBT+ people feel an unnecessary pressure to explain themselves

721822067260309505 2016-04-17 22:06:06 UTC <jadedayy16> 11.22.63 is living up to expectation. So so good 
721807507237314561 2016-04-17 21:08:14 UTC <jadedayy16> Exactly! And it just annoys me because it's ruining movies that could of been really good if they didn't whitewash it!
721806684595843072 2016-04-17 21:04:58 UTC <jadedayy16> I'm not blaming the actors who are cast but the people casting them. Is it really so hard to find actors that aren't white?
721805624561004545 2016-04-17 21:00:46 UTC <jadedayy16> HOLLYWOOD NEEDS TO STOP FUCKING WHITEWASHING EVERYTHING

721470960348618753 2016-04-16 22:50:55 UTC <jadedayy16> Chewy's reaction to Han's death is just 
721465497812877313 2016-04-16 22:29:13 UTC <jadedayy16> Kylo Ren is just one of those boys that never got over his emo phase as a teen

721453111773130752 2016-04-16 21:40:00 UTC <jadedayy16> I still ship Rey and Chewy more than Rey and Finn
721452615570210817 2016-04-16 21:38:02 UTC <jadedayy16> Still can't get over the fact that Rey called the Millennium Falcon garbage

721377830584610816 2016-04-16 16:40:52 UTC <jadedayy16> I'm seriously already excited about the Inhumans movie because it's going to bring so many characters to the MCU

720922746834853889 2016-04-15 10:32:31 UTC <jadedayy16> Honestly I think it would be great for America to have a woman president but Hillary Clinton is not the right person to be president
720920421487550464 2016-04-15 10:23:17 UTC <jadedayy16> 'Secretary Clinton called them out, they must of been crushed by this' lmao  #DemDebate #FeelTheBernhttps://twitter.com/business/status/720903037389258752

720281436499111936 2016-04-13 16:04:11 UTC <jadedayy16> it's 2016 and saying 'i was raped' or 'I raped them' is still not enough evidence to expel a student or even send them to prison
720278732070641664 2016-04-13 15:53:26 UTC <jadedayy16> The fact that college's care more about how well their sports teams do than the care of other students is so wrong.
720268557624459264 2016-04-13 15:13:00 UTC <jadedayy16> Also 'frat boys' and fraternity's are absolutely disgusting and repulsive and they are just a tradition that needs to stop
720268243366055936 2016-04-13 15:11:45 UTC <jadedayy16> Watching the hunting ground and it just makes me so mad and disgusted at the college system and how they blame victims

717499674429636608 2016-04-05 23:50:27 UTC <jadedayy16> Bet his suit costs a lot but they don't comment on that because it's more important to talk about a woman's outfit than her job 
717499249299234817 2016-04-05 23:48:46 UTC <jadedayy16> You comment on her outfit & ignore her interview questions but don't mention his cloths . can't even deal with thishttps://twitter.com/usweekly/status/717494585858072576
717437197125873664 2016-04-05 19:42:11 UTC <jadedayy16> the LGBT+ community already face such horrible discrimination and now in Mississippi they will feel even more unsafe.

715303409369395200 2016-03-30 22:23:17 UTC <jadedayy16> Oscar Issac's voice is so perfect to fall asleep to 
715280026602745857 2016-03-30 20:50:22 UTC <jadedayy16> Watching a documentary about trump and they've just completely ruled out sanders and saying Trumps only competition is Clinton? Lmao okay
715276967856193537 2016-03-30 20:38:12 UTC <jadedayy16> And his campaign videos are just laughable
715276854404464640 2016-03-30 20:37:45 UTC <jadedayy16> I can't take Ted Cruz seriously because he simultaneously looks sad and happy at the same time
715275596482396162 2016-03-30 20:32:46 UTC <jadedayy16> Mum: God doesn't discriminate me: have you read the bible?
715273809897660417 2016-03-30 20:25:40 UTC <jadedayy16> Woman can be butt naked and still be feminist. Stfu and stop body shaming womanhttps://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/715259296544501760
715273420573900800 2016-03-30 20:24:07 UTC <jadedayy16> If Trump is president we go back in time where anyone who's not white&male have no rights. He has no valid politics points. Don't vote 4 him
715270473974693889 2016-03-30 20:12:24 UTC <jadedayy16> Fuck Trump and Fuck his supporters. Vote Bernie
715221189162090496 2016-03-30 16:56:34 UTC <jadedayy16> why do people protect boys  behaviour by saying 'boys will be boys' and not address that they are in the wrong?pic.twitter.com/uUogOeErg9

715128298469265408 2016-03-30 10:47:27 UTC <jadedayy16> Chris brown is such a horrible person, how do people still listen to his music and idolise him? Learn how to respect woman and not be a twat
714927335196213248 2016-03-29 21:28:54 UTC <jadedayy16> WonderWoman&Lady Sif did a movie together it would be just them kicking ass&planting feminist ideas in men's brains DC/marvel make it happen

712383826358624256 2016-03-22 21:01:54 UTC <jadedayy16> What has happened in Brussels is truly horrifying & these terror attacks need to end, but blaming a religion for them will not achieve that
712383611127930881 2016-03-22 21:01:02 UTC <jadedayy16> It's awful that people blame and say all Muslims are terrorists. Islam is a religion of peace. They don't deserve hate for others actions.
