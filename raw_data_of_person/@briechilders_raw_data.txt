970118725616549888 2018-03-03 02:08:22 UTC <briechilders> In grocery store today I heard an elderly couple talking randomly.

967987977925287937 2018-02-25 05:01:32 UTC <briechilders> My 6 yr old asked me today if we were white or black. Is it weird that I didnt know how to answer that? I know what color I am, but I didnt like her having to claim my white heritage. How sad is that? Can I claim some shade of white skin that says I like all colors?
967264959120924672 2018-02-23 05:08:31 UTC <briechilders> I will vote for anyone who takes this stance in upcoming elections. Protecting our country from mass shootings has become a #1 priority.

966727368369872896 2018-02-22 17:32:20 UTC <briechilders> NRA is basically trying to get everyone to own a gun (or multiple)-Why? Because their community makes money from guns & ammunition. All companies hope that every house in America will buy their goods. So dont let a sales pitch sound like anything but a sales pitch #gunlaws#nra
966725090825027585 2018-02-22 17:23:17 UTC <briechilders> Dear NRA, if u dont want to be blamed for mass shootings, then stop funding politicians. If you arent buying the laws then you wont be at fault for the laws that put weapons in kids hands. #NRAarguments #IstandwithEmma #istandwiththekids

Just keep giving up something u want in exchange for them giving up something for u. Be enemies that function. American public losing as you attempt to agree on anything.

956376422745964544 2018-01-24 04:01:22 UTC <briechilders> We must care. Another high school shooting, with a 15 yr old suspect. 2 kids dead and many others wounded. And there are only 140 posts today with #BentonShooting ... meaning we have stopped reporting enough, stopped caring enough, stopped protecting enough.

951141995354865665 2018-01-10 17:21:37 UTC <briechilders> Tucker on Fox why would Dems agree to anything? Answr: because they r trying to make America a safe place for all our citizens. Its not all about winning. Or at least shouldnt be. Govt is for the people, about the people
950792393128923136 2018-01-09 18:12:26 UTC <briechilders> Trumps round table had some nice conversation. But I cant see a single hand of a person of color. And I see only 1 woman, who has barely spoken. Old white men are not the only Americans worth listening to. #diversifyorsink

845485712547897346 2017-03-24 04:01:16 UTC <briechilders> Surprisingly #Paul Ryan earned some of my respect today. Not so surprising,Trump's blaming others & threatening doomsday didn't impress me.
845378221654757376 2017-03-24 20:54:09 UTC <briechilders> Ps - my prediction of what he was going to say / who he would blame was right on #bragging #iknowmynarcissists
845377974480232448 2017-03-24 20:53:10 UTC <briechilders> Can he count the red people in congress? Does he know what the definition of "majority" is?! Trump has power for any of his good ideas.
845377143882203136 2017-03-24 20:49:52 UTC <briechilders> Trump knows that his Republicans didn't want his bill, too, right? Someone told him that, I assume? Write a better bill, it gets passed, duh
845373030565998592 2017-03-24 20:33:31 UTC <briechilders> Predict Trump reaction: "I did everything I promised!This bill was amazing!Democrats ruined an amazing bill, & Americans will now suffer"

836807806846128128 2017-02-28 05:18:22 UTC <briechilders> Should I be pretending that Trump is living in the same land that I am? This country ain't Tragic. Our criminals aren't all foreigners.
