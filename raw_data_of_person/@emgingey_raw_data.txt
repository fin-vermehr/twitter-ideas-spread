859368791771316225 2017-05-02 11:27:40 UTC <emgingey> Clearly going out of state is a better option for your personal goals, but Maine doesn't really have a stake in your future once you leave
859368605900845058 2017-05-02 11:26:56 UTC <emgingey> I mean you would still be gone for at least 4 years and giving your money to an out of state institution

808043331724918784 2016-12-11 20:18:37 UTC <emgingey> @emgag2400 I think I'm just frustrated with people thinking that tweeting about an issue is doing the work.  It's not.
808043194478895105 2016-12-11 20:18:04 UTC <emgingey> @emgag2400 but, if you CAN, and tweeting is still your only solution.  That is a problem.

807843073728376832 2016-12-10 07:02:52 UTC <emgingey> @emgingey this just popped into my brain btw and I spent a lonng time googling what it was called

807828490917728256 2016-12-10 06:04:55 UTC <emgingey> If you tweet out sympathy for homeless people in the winter, you better also be donating winter clothing. Sympathy can't keep someone warm.

807687926977036289 2016-12-10 20:46:22 UTC <emgingey> @emgingey its name was Floyd
807687852301713409 2016-12-10 20:46:04 UTC <emgingey> I've seen and snugged so many dogs today. A golden retriever put its paws on my shoulders and hug/danced with me.

807465431585980417 2016-12-09 06:02:15 UTC <emgingey> @emgingey also applies for smelling and seeingff

807339102160977920 2016-12-09 21:40:16 UTC <emgingey> @emgingey the same goes for all other movements
807338865363218432 2016-12-09 21:39:19 UTC <emgingey> @emgingey also. the personal is the political. If you preach feminism, but treat the women in your life like shit, you are not a feminist.
807338658336559104 2016-12-09 21:38:30 UTC <emgingey> reminder that men can only ever be allies to the feminist movement. Don't make your voice louder than the voice of the people you fight for.
807306750156279808 2016-12-09 19:31:42 UTC <emgingey> hey. I love you, dude.
807306445079375873 2016-12-09 19:30:30 UTC <emgingey> @emgingey @BenAlgeo I've decided my solution is just to shove you in front of me and yell "HE VOTED FOR HILLARY TOO"
807305912478220289 2016-12-09 19:28:23 UTC <emgingey> Should I lie about my major at family Xmas parties this year so my old conservative uncles and cousins don't ask me how I feel about Trump?
807085337700868097 2016-12-08 04:51:54 UTC <emgingey> @emgingey these are movies pretending to be full of feminism, but like not really?
807083579599626240 2016-12-08 04:44:54 UTC <emgingey> @emgingey "normal, adult, stereotypical women go on a wild break from reality"
807083280118009856 2016-12-08 04:43:43 UTC <emgingey> @emgingey also why are there so many woman-based comedies that only focus on "go wild" moments in women's lives.
807081756193067008 2016-12-08 04:37:40 UTC <emgingey> Mila Kunis IS a mom, but she's so bad at playing a mom..? Like real bad.
