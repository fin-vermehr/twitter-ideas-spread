970092968366485504 2018-03-03 00:26:01 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @JamesMelville When is the wedding day? The blessed union between two peoples that love each other (more than they are allowed to say!) and understand each other more than anyone else. How we hoped and cried (in silence). This seems like a solid union, not like the other one.
970092024111206401 2018-03-03 00:22:16 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @JamesMelville @trueloveway1 Remember austerity is a 'UK' thing, Ireland have ended austerity now. I think Ireland want this and can afford it more to be honest. Dont mean to be harsh but they are much richer than us NI, Scot, Eng and Walesers. It is an expression of LOVE between Ireland and Scotland  :) X
970075146835972096 2018-03-03 23:15:12 UTC <CairnanDuffy> Wall street crash mark 2? Canny wait to see what the stock market does on monday...I will give you a clue...(TERRIBLE!!)https://twitter.com/guardian/status/970053578739060736
969771753089183746 2018-03-02 03:09:38 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @pollytoynbee If the tory rebels could be trusted to vote for it and labours brexiteers kept to a minimum, but the tories will fall into line when the stakes get too much, national interest has a price. Its too risky from the UK side, tories would rally round, wont work, nice try though.

969743350856323072 2018-03-02 01:16:46 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @bbclaurak So its a trade deal! Its leaving at the end of 2020 and a trade deal, pick a country, Canada, who cares? NI is the plus bit. Bit of cash till the end, paying into the bodies that were always going to be paid. This was a terrible offer at the start but now is wonderful?
969729676473262081 2018-03-02 00:22:26 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @BBCNewsnight @ESchonQuinlivan @paulmasonnews Yeah, but this has peaked. It was a combo of the financial crisis and the refugee crisis. I'm not complacent about these things and the tail will be long. Without another economic or refugee crisis this will fade significantly although rising inequality will keep the flame going
969727364249915392 2018-03-02 00:13:14 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @ApplePodcasts @helenlewis @RemainiacsCast Great to hear someone mention the fact that the DUP were hostile to the good friday agreement from the beginning.  If they could build a massive impenetrable wall they would (I wish I was joking). The primary goal of brexit for the DUP was maximum separation from Ireland.
969685991744245760 2018-03-02 21:28:50 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @scotgov @MaryLouMcDonald @chrismcg21 @MichelleGr4h4m The tories&DUP, the DUP have been doing an outstanding job of poisoning England against Northern Irish unionism. Their recent walk away from the assembly has exposed them very badly. SF support for the up coming abortion ref will help detox the brand even further north and south.
969679420737884160 2018-03-02 21:02:44 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @scotgov @MaryLouMcDonald @chrismcg21 @MichelleGr4h4m I lived in Edinburgh for 8 years and have been in dublin for a year so I feel your pain, your bang on with the EFTA and EEA which will have to be the route and not a bad one given the size of the fishing industry. Ruth has been shamefully suckuppy, bazaar anti-scottish scots...
969675504700796933 2018-03-02 20:47:10 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @MaryLouMcDonald @chrismcg21 @MichelleGr4h4m The assembly needs to be resurrected which requires a general election to get rid of the DUP.  An early one, a no deal brexit and economic crisis would do the trick, we have the option of returning to Europe through unification which Scotland doesnt so can time it more carefully.
969666894444802054 2018-03-02 20:12:57 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @bbclaurak Waiting for brexitcast so I can eat it....Its been like all day :'(

969627613869244416 2018-03-02 17:36:52 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @MaryLouMcDonald @MichelleGr4h4m @chrismcg21 The tectonic plates are shifting in NI. We cant make the same mistake as Scotland(I campaigned for indy). NI people will have to push on this, with a good offer, keeping the assembly, NHS, policing it can be done but pensions and currency cant be underestimated. 2026 is my date.
969259238106247168 2018-03-01 17:13:04 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @DavidScullion @BrexitCentral And by the way the reason their is no hard border is because we are in the customs union and single market. This is the entire point of this discussion, stop grasping because going after the Good Friday Agreement backfired spectacularly perhaps even costing you Brexit.
969258160526647297 2018-03-01 17:08:48 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @DavidScullion @BrexitCentral Stop lecturing Northern Irish and Irish people about borders, we understand borders very very very well indeed. Its very tedious having to listen to people who have no idea what they are talking about tell me about something that was part of my everyday life growing up.
969250153273155585 2018-03-01 16:36:58 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Anna_Soubry Well said! Keep it up :) The DUP are strangling the voice of NI by preventing the return of our assembly. This is because it would quickly vote to support staying in the CU and SM. They have no interest in what NI wants i.e to remain in the EU. Total abdication.
969080087139246080 2018-02-28 05:21:12 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @jonsnowC4 I believe him! I NEVER thought I would believe such a man. If brexit has done anything, it is to convince a non tory's that tory's are in fact 'human', wonderful..I even said to myself the other day if @Anna_Soubry was my MP I might vote for her :'( and :). And I'm from Derry!
969053577548312577 2018-02-28 03:35:51 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @YouTube @TheYoungTurks I've been so busy with UK shit I toootaly forgot that you guys were disintegrating too, Happy disintegration day/year/....ps just in case you forgot, they invented this shit which trump used to elect himself..And theyve gone bad real real bad, Good luck guys :)!
969045637433094144 2018-02-28 03:04:18 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @guardian Explains why he supports brexit, UK/EU doesnt matter, hey fuck you guys! Anyone whos business does depend on the UK/EU not so keen....

969030784727347200 2018-02-28 02:05:17 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @dontbrexitfixit In the same way that Britain rued the day that they divided the island of Ireland.
968976076880973824 2018-02-28 22:27:54 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @DUPleader Arlene who? I thought you were toppled a couple of weeks ago in a coup. Is this the only way the MPs will listen? Through the medium of the tweet? They are very busy with their important ministerial jobs to be fair, unlike yourself.
968637849615654912 2018-02-27 00:03:54 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @mikegalsworthy There needs to be a take down on this. Why is level of Irish trade with the US proportionately huge compared with the UK? Why is German trade with China so much greater? The EU will soon have trade deals with all the countries in the world that want to have trade deals.
968290670615105536 2018-02-26 01:04:20 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @bbclaurak Is their such thing as a 'fudge grenade'? Canny wait, May will probably still be covered in fudge on friday and the EU will have a water tight legal doc..May will be waffling on about having her three baskets cakes and eating them...Popcorn all week :)
967744809019559936 2018-02-25 12:55:16 UTC <CairnanDuffy> This is what the brexiteers deserve by trying to throw the good friday agreement under the brexit bus. This certainly gave Corbyn the personal intellectual cover to change his mind, thank you brexiteers from the bottom of my heart!#Brexit #FBPEhttps://twitter.com/andrewrawnsley/status/967734774143111168
967735411467608064 2018-02-25 12:17:56 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @BrexitCentral By going after the good friday agreement you pushed Corbyn to protect it and made even some tories question their stance. You have messed this up for which I am very glad (I come from northern Ireland). There is no majority for leaving the customs union in Parliament, total fail.

They are hostile to the PM, a no deal brexit is now the most likely option by virtue of the impossibility of the alternatives. PREPARE!
965774449931948037 2018-02-19 02:25:46 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @guardian Actually this is trying to undermine the death by violence and denigrate the troubles. Part of the denigration that has been going on in multiple publications today...I have no reason why the press have gone nuts but today is  D day apparently. I think they see NI as brexit death
965772120537038848 2018-02-19 02:16:31 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @MrJohnNicolson I was pretty shocked at Northern Ireland being thrown under a bus but there you go..under a bus...Maybe even a double decker..probably draged along fur ages...miles maybes...but as bad as the north is we still have an escape option which gets more likely by the day HA! INDY FAIL!
965767291429408768 2018-02-19 01:57:20 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @paulmasonnews The panic is palpable. Internal polling?. Something is up. The Northern Ireland stuff is disturbing suggesting real desperation. There must have been a massive shift. I think the practical brexitears have thrown in the towel and thought these feckers dont know what they are doin.
965735385967054848 2018-02-19 23:50:33 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @garrethhayes @BirkstedIan actually it is 'We can fish our own fish' apparently fish have blue passports now...

965726706505011202 2018-02-19 23:16:03 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Telegraph @DanielJHannan Leave the good friday agreement out of this freak show, so Northern Ireland is to be sacrificed on the alter of a red white and blue brexit? Cant solve the conundrum so lets run over it? This union is a disgrace.
964337873909579776 2018-02-15 03:17:20 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @darrengrimes_ This headline was very misleading, did you actually read the article?
964297847565967360 2018-02-15 00:38:17 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Anna_Soubry ABSOLUMONT!
964297286137384961 2018-02-15 00:36:03 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @DanielJHannan Seriously, the reason I'm following you is because of the brexiteers, you made the most rational argument, I was a remainer. I did  worry though when you used the 90% of future growth will be outside the EU. The EU is 6,43 of the worlds population, surely it should be 93.6? :'(
963918360726638592 2018-02-14 23:30:20 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @mcbogwirtell Indeed, I thought I would start the new year by smugly letting the UK fall flat on its smug face but I have this fear that compels me to try and stop it at using all democratic tools at my disposal..I have the feeling that if it goes wrong it will go very very wrong.

963911582794309633 2018-02-14 23:03:24 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Andrew_Adonis Agreed, UKIP was on the daily politics incredibly disproportionately, with around 3% they still seem to be on too often. I felt at one point it was being blackmailed by someone. Ridiculous I know but their was no logical explanation for the extent of the coverage they got
963877981621051392 2018-02-14 20:49:53 UTC <CairnanDuffy> While everyone was listening to that terrible speech by BoJo the DUP have effectively collapsed the government of NI because the DUP brexit MPs feel too important for the NI assembly.

963804736389607425 2018-02-14 15:58:50 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @LeeReynoldsDUP @BrexitCentral The DUP lost the brexit argument in Northern Ireland, the desire to remain in the EU is even higher now. The DUP cant lecturing me, I live in the only border city, Derry. He knows nothing of the psychology of the people desperate for an opportunity for targets and neither do you!
963427479439446017 2018-02-13 14:59:45 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Conservatives @DanielJHannan The first female elected to Westminster was Constance Markievicz, a member of Sinn Fein...
963421728553783299 2018-02-13 14:36:54 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @BrexitCentral The day all your dreams or delusions give way to reality. You do realize that if your wrong about this the country will disintegrate..

962720196761915392 2018-02-11 16:09:16 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @simoncoveney Science and finance are the two most affected areas that Ireland could take advantage of, shame that the focus seems only to have been in finance, attracting the scientific heavyweights that are highly networked in Europe is the key as well as about 2 Billion to do it!
962717891350220800 2018-02-11 16:00:06 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @simoncoveney There needs to be a reality check on optimism. The Irish government I am hoping has been planning for no deal, no transition. The difference in economic consequences between a trade deal and no deal are small. A no-deal brexit is becoming likely, PREPARE or lose the government.
962156943669387264 2018-02-09 02:51:06 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Anna_Soubry The fact that NI was effectively removed from the 'war cabinet' discussion tells you of the impossibilityness of it. The first phase has to be made a legal document, i'm sorry to disappoint but being from NI, IMPOSSIBLE..We never left the first phase...DUP happy??? IMPOSSIBLE!!
961636339170136065 2018-02-08 16:22:24 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @HughRBennett @BrexitCentral @AlisonFayersKer There is no point in discussing impossibilities. Support for the EU goes from 95% in the young to about 75% among the lowest supporting groups, its at 88% overall. It is the most pro-EU country in Europe, the advantages/disadvantages dont change from one EU country to another.
961397427034120192 2018-02-07 00:33:03 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @HughRBennett @BrexitCentral @mrlrac We needed a push, thanks for that..
961389329481379840 2018-02-07 00:00:52 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @HughRBennett @BrexitCentral @mrlrac Not for long dude... If brexit is a failure we will leave the UK, so you better be right about it being a titanic success.
961382697745764353 2018-02-07 23:34:31 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @HughRBennett @BrexitCentral @mrlrac Apparently Northern Ireland is not apart of the UK, but is part of EU and Ireland. Suits me but have you told your friends in the DUP that they are no longer part of the UK?

961317025317621760 2018-02-07 19:13:33 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @bbclaurak I thought Northern Ireland would win hands down but the north east and west midlands relegated us to 3rd place to moderate hell below absolute hell (go north east) and total hell (well done west midlands) in the fantasy Brexit league :(
959648730482921473 2018-02-02 04:44:21 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @bencooper The desperation of the brexiters at the moment tells us something important..The've all gone nuts no? We must be winning?
959553233772564480 2018-02-02 22:24:53 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @BrexitCentral Guys, looks like its all going pete tong. The desperation in this article must have you worried. You can feel the momentum has substantially shifted against leave, its not in the polls yet, if the next two months go badly expect a significant shift. A leadership contest is fatal.
949383757269749760 2018-01-05 20:55:01 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @lsebrexitvote @Usherwood More monthly reassurances from Hammond, I will put that with 'we will probably have a transition deal by Christmas', Hammond clearly thinks finance laps up any optimistic suggestion about brexit. The more I see, the more I start to agree with him, so easily mislead to be honest..
949369513908334593 2018-01-05 19:58:25 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @MRJKilcoyne @BrexitCentral Bazaar that the UK would join a trade agreement that it played no part in negotiating but will just tack itself on at the last minute, this trade agreement is clearly aimed at countries on pacific trading routes, relatively meaningless for a country in the mid atlantic..

937723164326580225 2017-12-04 16:39:59 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Ronutan Maybe you should stop talking about NI as if you know anything. So your argument is that Irish only exsits as a form of anti-english racism, this started off about accurately representing the veiws of NI but continuing is pointless..bye
937721430514503680 2017-12-04 16:33:05 UTC <CairnanDuffy> So NI, Ireland, UK and Europe are being blackmailed by the DUP, What next the World? #Brexit
937719308498690053 2017-12-04 16:24:39 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Ronutan You knowledge of NI is very poor, people in the north dont see the language act as a major obstacle and this is part of previous agreements that should have been implemented a long time ago. Interesting that you leave out LGTB rights which the DUP also see as a 'red line'
937716786228756480 2017-12-04 16:14:38 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Ronutan This is not about the constitutional position of NI. 'Foriegn Policy' do you think Brexit is not a domestic issue? Your obsession with SF is revealing, but it is the DUP that are destroying the support in the UK for the unionist cause in NI.
937715601618894848 2017-12-04 16:09:55 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Ronutan Do you know anything about NI? Yes, alliance, SDLP, Greens, SF, UUP and DUP. If there was a vote tomorrow to stay in the CU and SM it would pass with ease, it is the reason the 'Democratic' UP doesnt want it up and running, they would find out quickly the 'will of the people'
937711386318331904 2017-12-04 15:53:10 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Ronutan 'There are so many parties in Northern Ireland you cant just look at vote share' Then what do you look at? Smaller parties are the future in northern Ireland and I have no problem with them at all. I have a problem with the DUP pretending that they are the 'will of the people'.
937707260612173825 2017-12-04 15:36:47 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Ronutan There was a vote in the assembly before the march election to remain within the CU and SM. It was lost by a single vote. The current makeup of the NI assembly mean that the parties that voted for this would pass such a vote with ease, BTW this is not about SF it is about NI.
937699947377545217 2017-12-04 15:07:43 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @PA @DUPleader @SiobhanFenton @DavidYoungPA Interesting that the reason the NI assembly is not up and running is because the DUP does not want to apply the same laws of the LGTB community to northern Ireland and Language acts that apply to the other devolved administrations in the UK.
937698319832403970 2017-12-04 15:01:15 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @WingsScotland @RobertMackey In the NI assembly vote this year they got 28% (proportional system). Its also interesting to see how the remain vote went in NI (56%) by constituency.pic.twitter.com/CddyQQmbrk
937696407242321920 2017-12-04 14:53:39 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @NicolaSturgeon Agreed, unfortunately for London it is not a country with a devolved administration so I dont know how it would be workable, but agree that given scotland voted massively to remain and had asked for such a solution ,it should have been given it.
937690742520209408 2017-12-04 14:31:09 UTC <CairnanDuffy> The DUP have prevented the formation of the NI assembly because they do not want UK LGTB laws and language laws that apply in the UK and other devolved parliments respectively to apply to NI, i.e they do not want regulatory CONVERGENCE with the rest of the UK. #Brexit
937688909018009601 2017-12-04 14:23:51 UTC <CairnanDuffy> Just for anyone out there curious, the DUP did not sign the good friday agreement and campaigned against it, the DUP do represent 28% percent of the electorate of NI, The DUP campaigned for brexit in NI and NI voted 56% remain. Northern Ireland is NOT the DUP! #Brexit
937122804293652480 2017-12-02 00:54:22 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @ForeignPolicy @PeterKGeoghegan The article has some very good points but its accidental perhaps inherent bias made it seem a bit off. Referring to Sinn Fein as the political wing of the IRA is 20 years out of date, The new leaders and reps have little/no connection to the IRA, they were very young at that time
936776505455083521 2017-12-01 01:58:18 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @JolyonMaugham Need more extensive devolution (regulatory bodies) thats been proposed for NI, should in fact be easier...I asked myself why scotland is very quite about this..Probs to not destabalise the NI negotiations I suppose but it did vote 62% remain, May was very obtuse
936775463619325953 2017-12-01 01:54:09 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @JolyonMaugham Scotland did ask for this but May refused, it would have solved the 'border problem' by pushing it to the Scottish/English border where electronic means would be possible (they tried experiments in NI and they were immediately destroyed night after night).
936773638367232000 2017-12-01 01:46:54 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Lifelandlady @JolyonMaugham @Chr1sF1 Nothing, It will be part of the overall trade agreement, standards already diverge in different parts of the UK, goods origonating or with significant proportion made in NI with the other counter part Ireland no tarrifs, but purely irish goods tarifs..what every they are.
936771273757147136 2017-12-01 01:37:30 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @uk_rants @omotforest Mogg was very specific that this could only work with 0% tarifs on ALL goods, you cannot have different regimes simultaneously. The NI border is not controversial, a ref was held in ireland as part of the peace agreement removing its claim and requiring a ref north and south.
936766043829268480 2017-12-01 01:16:43 UTC <CairnanDuffy> Gold article about brexit and NI for those that think that the DUP are our sole representatives on the planet, they got 28% of the vote in the last NI assembly elections in March.  We are not as mad as they make us out to be #brexithttps://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/unionist-public-more-open-to-special-status-than-leaders-1.3311157
936659503831011328 2017-12-01 18:13:22 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @NicTrades The news is going to get even better, expect a massive tumble in the pound before christmas should send it over the 60 mark, GO DEVALUATION!
936657450392018950 2017-12-01 18:05:13 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @uk_rants This is legally nonsense, global trading WTO etc and trading deals require such a border on the UK side. The UK approach is totally unprofessional, its amateurism from an outside perspective must be shocking. UKs reputation is being destroyed, let Ireland 'build the wall'?
936649119396978692 2017-12-01 17:32:06 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @YesBrexit Do you have anything to say to your fellow non-unionists in NI? Are we leaving the UK? No, I care about what happens to our people in the north that will be most effected, farming communities near the border, your supporters I reckon. Do you care about them their economics?
936618125465964545 2017-12-01 15:28:57 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @CllrBSilvester Farmers will be delighted!
936579226622418944 2017-12-01 12:54:23 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @isaby @BrexitCentral @robinpe59709510 That might work with Scots but not with us (and you actually mean UK wide as the UK is composed of 4 nations), I can already hear the creaking of the government line on Ireland. DUP managed to get NI out of austerity, now ireland/EU will help us escape brexit, schweet, ps enjoy!!
936360667698860032 2017-11-30 22:25:54 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @isaby @BrexitCentral Dude I was there as a political nerd in the thick of it, the US provided impartial mediation and the EU funded the settlement and all the cross border institutions, the peace money was used to get many of the former paramilitaries involved in community work, largely successful.
936347460666122243 2017-11-30 21:33:25 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @isaby @BrexitCentral @robinpe59709510 The Irony, I grew up in the dark old days in a city that will be split into multiple parts because of this, just because the UK dont give a shit about NI doesnt mean that Ireland and the EU feel the same. The DUP only got 28% in the NI elections this year and we did vote remain.
936343962687766529 2017-11-30 21:19:31 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @isaby @BrexitCentral Overplayed his hand? He paid his union dues and now he has the backing of its 450 million members, the UK has no hand. I thought you would realize that after coughing up the money...Malta is more powerful than the UK now, bring back control pffff.....
936342246114381826 2017-11-30 21:12:42 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @LiamHalligan @BrexitCentral Says the man who wants to promote the WTO...You do realize that Trump is currently trying and may very well succeed in destroying the dispute court of the WTO? Which if he continues he will succeed by 2019, good year to join I reckon. Your not following the WTO very carefully...
933115831621431299 2017-11-21 23:32:05 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @OwenSmith_MP Phase one solves the EU, Ireland and NI trade/political problem, Phase two solves the UK NI 'tarif' problem. NI already has different rules for some agriculture products.
933113474833514496 2017-11-21 23:22:43 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @OwenSmith_MP Rules of origin can be decided later in the second phase, either sectorial or general exemption where a significant proportion of a good made in NI receives tariff exemption from the UK. It would be up to the UK&EU to create this in a trade agreement, EU would agree
933099949352411136 2017-11-21 22:28:58 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @OwenSmith_MP NI border re equivalence, would be customs checks at ports but no tarrifs exept for irish goods, ports small & checks 'manageable' as port infrastructure exists, customs required anyway, better at ports. Dods argument of tarif barriers between NI&UK entirely false.
924246846901571584 2017-10-28 12:09:54 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @guyverhofstadt Your squandering the pro-EU good will after brexit among the young Europeans. BTW who are you to decide what is real and fake independence?

772125228604518400 2016-09-03 17:32:54 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Del_ivered When Corbyn is re-elected the Labour will distroy the party to 'Get Corbyn', this will also destroy the Scottish Labour v.sad.
772123588841312256 2016-09-03 17:26:23 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Del_ivered :) but I don't think UK can ask Scotland to go on this isolationist path. Unchallanged Tory governments for 20 yrs is too much.
772120810106548224 2016-09-03 17:15:21 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Del_ivered So was I, the world will form 4 main trading blocks, EU, US, China and India which will dominate global politics for 50 more yrs

772115754846195713 2016-09-03 16:55:15 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Del_ivered Exactly the same mistakes are being made, Scotland simply wanted home rule as Ireland did, and the voted to stay in the EU too.
772114027023663104 2016-09-03 16:48:23 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Del_ivered If the UK was such a team player why did Ireland leave the UK? Stop voting for governments 'team' Scotland detest or let them go

I think Ireland want this and can afford it more to be honest. Dont mean to be harsh but they are much richer than us NI, Scot, Eng and Walesers. It is an expression of LOVE between Ireland and Scotland  :) X

Its too risky from the UK side, tories would rally round, wont work, nice try though.

Bit of cash till the end, paying into the bodies that were always going to be paid. This was a terrible offer at the start but now is wonderful?
969729676473262081 2018-03-02 00:22:26 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @BBCNewsnight @ESchonQuinlivan @paulmasonnews Yeah, but this has peaked. It was a combo of the financial crisis and the refugee crisis. I'm not complacent about these things and the tail will be long. Without another economic or refugee crisis this will fade significantly although rising inequality will keep the flame going
969727364249915392 2018-03-02 00:13:14 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @ApplePodcasts @helenlewis @RemainiacsCast Great to hear someone mention the fact that the DUP were hostile to the good friday agreement from the beginning.  If they could build a massive impenetrable wall they would (I wish I was joking). The primary goal of brexit for the DUP was maximum separation from Ireland.
969685991744245760 2018-03-02 21:28:50 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @scotgov @MaryLouMcDonald @chrismcg21 @MichelleGr4h4m The tories&DUP, the DUP have been doing an outstanding job of poisoning England against Northern Irish unionism. Their recent walk away from the assembly has exposed them very badly. SF support for the up coming abortion ref will help detox the brand even further north and south.

An early one, a no deal brexit and economic crisis would do the trick, we have the option of returning to Europe through unification which Scotland doesnt so can time it more carefully.

We cant make the same mistake as Scotland(I campaigned for indy). NI people will have to push on this, with a good offer, keeping the assembly, NHS, policing it can be done but pensions and currency cant be underestimated. 2026 is my date.
969259238106247168 2018-03-01 17:13:04 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @DavidScullion @BrexitCentral And by the way the reason their is no hard border is because we are in the customs union and single market. This is the entire point of this discussion, stop grasping because going after the Good Friday Agreement backfired spectacularly perhaps even costing you Brexit.
969258160526647297 2018-03-01 17:08:48 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @DavidScullion @BrexitCentral Stop lecturing Northern Irish and Irish people about borders, we understand borders very very very well indeed. Its very tedious having to listen to people who have no idea what they are talking about tell me about something that was part of my everyday life growing up.
969250153273155585 2018-03-01 16:36:58 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Anna_Soubry Well said! Keep it up :) The DUP are strangling the voice of NI by preventing the return of our assembly. This is because it would quickly vote to support staying in the CU and SM. They have no interest in what NI wants i.e to remain in the EU. Total abdication.
969080087139246080 2018-02-28 05:21:12 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @jonsnowC4 I believe him! I NEVER thought I would believe such a man.

Why is German trade with China so much greater? The EU will soon have trade deals with all the countries in the world that want to have trade deals.
968290670615105536 2018-02-26 01:04:20 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @bbclaurak Is their such thing as a 'fudge grenade'? Canny wait, May will probably still be covered in fudge on friday and the EU will have a water tight legal doc..May will be waffling on about having her three baskets cakes and eating them...Popcorn all week :)
967744809019559936 2018-02-25 12:55:16 UTC <CairnanDuffy> This is what the brexiteers deserve by trying to throw the good friday agreement under the brexit bus. This certainly gave Corbyn the personal intellectual cover to change his mind, thank you brexiteers from the bottom of my heart!#Brexit #FBPEhttps://twitter.com/andrewrawnsley/status/967734774143111168
967735411467608064 2018-02-25 12:17:56 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @BrexitCentral By going after the good friday agreement you pushed Corbyn to protect it and made even some tories question their stance. You have messed this up for which I am very glad (I come from northern Ireland). There is no majority for leaving the customs union in Parliament, total fail.

966077536974397440 2018-02-20 22:30:08 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @OwenPaterson @DanielJHannan @KateHoeyMP @DMcCaffreySKY @simoncoveney Forget May, the the ERG are in control with the support of the DUP, NI is just the first to be thrown under the brexit bus, England is next. They are hostile to the PM, a no deal brexit is now the most likely option by virtue of the impossibility of the alternatives. PREPARE!
965774449931948037 2018-02-19 02:25:46 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @guardian Actually this is trying to undermine the death by violence and denigrate the troubles. Part of the denigration that has been going on in multiple publications today...I have no reason why the press have gone nuts but today is  D day apparently. I think they see NI as brexit death
965772120537038848 2018-02-19 02:16:31 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @MrJohnNicolson I was pretty shocked at Northern Ireland being thrown under a bus but there you go..under a bus...Maybe even a double decker..probably draged along fur ages...miles maybes...but as bad as the north is we still have an escape option which gets more likely by the day HA! INDY FAIL!
965767291429408768 2018-02-19 01:57:20 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @paulmasonnews The panic is palpable. Internal polling?. Something is up. The Northern Ireland stuff is disturbing suggesting real desperation. There must have been a massive shift. I think the practical brexitears have thrown in the towel and thought these feckers dont know what they are doin.
965735385967054848 2018-02-19 23:50:33 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @garrethhayes @BirkstedIan actually it is 'We can fish our own fish' apparently fish have blue passports now...
965727373294559233 2018-02-19 23:18:42 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @DanielJHannan Yeah but you described it as finished, HOW DARE YOU!
965726706505011202 2018-02-19 23:16:03 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Telegraph @DanielJHannan Leave the good friday agreement out of this freak show, so Northern Ireland is to be sacrificed on the alter of a red white and blue brexit? Cant solve the conundrum so lets run over it? This union is a disgrace.
964337873909579776 2018-02-15 03:17:20 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @darrengrimes_ This headline was very misleading, did you actually read the article?
964297847565967360 2018-02-15 00:38:17 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Anna_Soubry ABSOLUMONT!
964297286137384961 2018-02-15 00:36:03 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @DanielJHannan Seriously, the reason I'm following you is because of the brexiteers, you made the most rational argument, I was a remainer. I did  worry though when you used the 90% of future growth will be outside the EU. The EU is 6,43 of the worlds population, surely it should be 93.6? :'(
963918360726638592 2018-02-14 23:30:20 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @mcbogwirtell Indeed, I thought I would start the new year by smugly letting the UK fall flat on its smug face but I have this fear that compels me to try and stop it at using all democratic tools at my disposal..I have the feeling that if it goes wrong it will go very very wrong.

963911582794309633 2018-02-14 23:03:24 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Andrew_Adonis Agreed, UKIP was on the daily politics incredibly disproportionately, with around 3% they still seem to be on too often. I felt at one point it was being blackmailed by someone. Ridiculous I know but their was no logical explanation for the extent of the coverage they got
963877981621051392 2018-02-14 20:49:53 UTC <CairnanDuffy> While everyone was listening to that terrible speech by BoJo the DUP have effectively collapsed the government of NI because the DUP brexit MPs feel too important for the NI assembly. This DUP freakshow has got to end, the UK, Ireland and NI deserve better than this #brexithttps://twitter.com/rtenews/status/963841653030219777
963804736389607425 2018-02-14 15:58:50 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @LeeReynoldsDUP @BrexitCentral The DUP lost the brexit argument in Northern Ireland, the desire to remain in the EU is even higher now. The DUP cant lecturing me, I live in the only border city, Derry. He knows nothing of the psychology of the people desperate for an opportunity for targets and neither do you!
963427479439446017 2018-02-13 14:59:45 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Conservatives @DanielJHannan The first female elected to Westminster was Constance Markievicz, a member of Sinn Fein...
963421728553783299 2018-02-13 14:36:54 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @BrexitCentral The day all your dreams or delusions give way to reality. You do realize that if your wrong about this the country will disintegrate..

962720196761915392 2018-02-11 16:09:16 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @simoncoveney Science and finance are the two most affected areas that Ireland could take advantage of, shame that the focus seems only to have been in finance, attracting the scientific heavyweights that are highly networked in Europe is the key as well as about 2 Billion to do it!
962717891350220800 2018-02-11 16:00:06 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @simoncoveney There needs to be a reality check on optimism. The Irish government I am hoping has been planning for no deal, no transition. The difference in economic consequences between a trade deal and no deal are small. A no-deal brexit is becoming likely, PREPARE or lose the government.
962156943669387264 2018-02-09 02:51:06 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Anna_Soubry The fact that NI was effectively removed from the 'war cabinet' discussion tells you of the impossibilityness of it. The first phase has to be made a legal document, i'm sorry to disappoint but being from NI, IMPOSSIBLE..We never left the first phase...DUP happy??? IMPOSSIBLE!!
961636339170136065 2018-02-08 16:22:24 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @HughRBennett @BrexitCentral @AlisonFayersKer There is no point in discussing impossibilities. Support for the EU goes from 95% in the young to about 75% among the lowest supporting groups, its at 88% overall. It is the most pro-EU country in Europe, the advantages/disadvantages dont change from one EU country to another.
961397427034120192 2018-02-07 00:33:03 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @HughRBennett @BrexitCentral @mrlrac We needed a push, thanks for that..
961389329481379840 2018-02-07 00:00:52 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @HughRBennett @BrexitCentral @mrlrac Not for long dude... If brexit is a failure we will leave the UK, so you better be right about it being a titanic success.
961382697745764353 2018-02-07 23:34:31 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @HughRBennett @BrexitCentral @mrlrac Apparently Northern Ireland is not apart of the UK, but is part of EU and Ireland. Suits me but have you told your friends in the DUP that they are no longer part of the UK?
961381946046779392 2018-02-07 23:31:32 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @HughRBennett @BrexitCentral @AlisonFayersKer Irexit has a snoball in hells chance... Your having enough trouble with Brexit...
961317025317621760 2018-02-07 19:13:33 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @bbclaurak I thought Northern Ireland would win hands down but the north east and west midlands relegated us to 3rd place to moderate hell below absolute hell (go north east) and total hell (well done west midlands) in the fantasy Brexit league :(
959648730482921473 2018-02-02 04:44:21 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @bencooper The desperation of the brexiters at the moment tells us something important..The've all gone nuts no? We must be winning?
959553233772564480 2018-02-02 22:24:53 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @BrexitCentral Guys, looks like its all going pete tong. The desperation in this article must have you worried. You can feel the momentum has substantially shifted against leave, its not in the polls yet, if the next two months go badly expect a significant shift. A leadership contest is fatal.
949383757269749760 2018-01-05 20:55:01 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @lsebrexitvote @Usherwood More monthly reassurances from Hammond, I will put that with 'we will probably have a transition deal by Christmas', Hammond clearly thinks finance laps up any optimistic suggestion about brexit. The more I see, the more I start to agree with him, so easily mislead to be honest..
949369513908334593 2018-01-05 19:58:25 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @MRJKilcoyne @BrexitCentral Bazaar that the UK would join a trade agreement that it played no part in negotiating but will just tack itself on at the last minute, this trade agreement is clearly aimed at countries on pacific trading routes, relatively meaningless for a country in the mid atlantic..

937723164326580225 2017-12-04 16:39:59 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Ronutan Maybe you should stop talking about NI as if you know anything. So your argument is that Irish only exsits as a form of anti-english racism, this started off about accurately representing the veiws of NI but continuing is pointless..bye
937721430514503680 2017-12-04 16:33:05 UTC <CairnanDuffy> So NI, Ireland, UK and Europe are being blackmailed by the DUP, What next the World? #Brexit
937719308498690053 2017-12-04 16:24:39 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Ronutan You knowledge of NI is very poor, people in the north dont see the language act as a major obstacle and this is part of previous agreements that should have been implemented a long time ago. Interesting that you leave out LGTB rights which the DUP also see as a 'red line'
937716786228756480 2017-12-04 16:14:38 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Ronutan This is not about the constitutional position of NI. 'Foriegn Policy' do you think Brexit is not a domestic issue? Your obsession with SF is revealing, but it is the DUP that are destroying the support in the UK for the unionist cause in NI.
937715601618894848 2017-12-04 16:09:55 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Ronutan Do you know anything about NI? Yes, alliance, SDLP, Greens, SF, UUP and DUP. If there was a vote tomorrow to stay in the CU and SM it would pass with ease, it is the reason the 'Democratic' UP doesnt want it up and running, they would find out quickly the 'will of the people'
937711386318331904 2017-12-04 15:53:10 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Ronutan 'There are so many parties in Northern Ireland you cant just look at vote share' Then what do you look at? Smaller parties are the future in northern Ireland and I have no problem with them at all. I have a problem with the DUP pretending that they are the 'will of the people'.
937707260612173825 2017-12-04 15:36:47 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Ronutan There was a vote in the assembly before the march election to remain within the CU and SM. It was lost by a single vote. The current makeup of the NI assembly mean that the parties that voted for this would pass such a vote with ease, BTW this is not about SF it is about NI.
937699947377545217 2017-12-04 15:07:43 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @PA @DUPleader @SiobhanFenton @DavidYoungPA Interesting that the reason the NI assembly is not up and running is because the DUP does not want to apply the same laws of the LGTB community to northern Ireland and Language acts that apply to the other devolved administrations in the UK.
937698319832403970 2017-12-04 15:01:15 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @WingsScotland @RobertMackey In the NI assembly vote this year they got 28% (proportional system). Its also interesting to see how the remain vote went in NI (56%) by constituency.pic.twitter.com/CddyQQmbrk
937696407242321920 2017-12-04 14:53:39 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @NicolaSturgeon Agreed, unfortunately for London it is not a country with a devolved administration so I dont know how it would be workable, but agree that given scotland voted massively to remain and had asked for such a solution ,it should have been given it.
937690742520209408 2017-12-04 14:31:09 UTC <CairnanDuffy> The DUP have prevented the formation of the NI assembly because they do not want UK LGTB laws and language laws that apply in the UK and other devolved parliments respectively to apply to NI, i.e they do not want regulatory CONVERGENCE with the rest of the UK. #Brexit
937688909018009601 2017-12-04 14:23:51 UTC <CairnanDuffy> Just for anyone out there curious, the DUP did not sign the good friday agreement and campaigned against it, the DUP do represent 28% percent of the electorate of NI, The DUP campaigned for brexit in NI and NI voted 56% remain. Northern Ireland is NOT the DUP! #Brexit
937122804293652480 2017-12-02 00:54:22 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @ForeignPolicy @PeterKGeoghegan The article has some very good points but its accidental perhaps inherent bias made it seem a bit off. Referring to Sinn Fein as the political wing of the IRA is 20 years out of date, The new leaders and reps have little/no connection to the IRA, they were very young at that time
936776505455083521 2017-12-01 01:58:18 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @JolyonMaugham Need more extensive devolution (regulatory bodies) thats been proposed for NI, should in fact be easier...I asked myself why scotland is very quite about this..Probs to not destabalise the NI negotiations I suppose but it did vote 62% remain, May was very obtuse
936775463619325953 2017-12-01 01:54:09 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @JolyonMaugham Scotland did ask for this but May refused, it would have solved the 'border problem' by pushing it to the Scottish/English border where electronic means would be possible (they tried experiments in NI and they were immediately destroyed night after night).
936773638367232000 2017-12-01 01:46:54 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Lifelandlady @JolyonMaugham @Chr1sF1 Nothing, It will be part of the overall trade agreement, standards already diverge in different parts of the UK, goods origonating or with significant proportion made in NI with the other counter part Ireland no tarrifs, but purely irish goods tarifs..what every they are.
936771273757147136 2017-12-01 01:37:30 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @uk_rants @omotforest Mogg was very specific that this could only work with 0% tarifs on ALL goods, you cannot have different regimes simultaneously. The NI border is not controversial, a ref was held in ireland as part of the peace agreement removing its claim and requiring a ref north and south.
936766043829268480 2017-12-01 01:16:43 UTC <CairnanDuffy> Gold article about brexit and NI for those that think that the DUP are our sole representatives on the planet, they got 28% of the vote in the last NI assembly elections in March.

936657450392018950 2017-12-01 18:05:13 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @uk_rants This is legally nonsense, global trading WTO etc and trading deals require such a border on the UK side. The UK approach is totally unprofessional, its amateurism from an outside perspective must be shocking. UKs reputation is being destroyed, let Ireland 'build the wall'?
936649119396978692 2017-12-01 17:32:06 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @YesBrexit Do you have anything to say to your fellow non-unionists in NI? Are we leaving the UK? No, I care about what happens to our people in the north that will be most effected, farming communities near the border, your supporters I reckon. Do you care about them their economics?

The DUP only got 28% in the NI elections this year and we did vote remain.
936343962687766529 2017-11-30 21:19:31 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @isaby @BrexitCentral Overplayed his hand? He paid his union dues and now he has the backing of its 450 million members, the UK has no hand. I thought you would realize that after coughing up the money...Malta is more powerful than the UK now, bring back control pffff.....
936342246114381826 2017-11-30 21:12:42 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @LiamHalligan @BrexitCentral Says the man who wants to promote the WTO...You do realize that Trump is currently trying and may very well succeed in destroying the dispute court of the WTO? Which if he continues he will succeed by 2019, good year to join I reckon. Your not following the WTO very carefully...
933115831621431299 2017-11-21 23:32:05 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @OwenSmith_MP Phase one solves the EU, Ireland and NI trade/political problem, Phase two solves the UK NI 'tarif' problem. NI already has different rules for some agriculture products.
933113474833514496 2017-11-21 23:22:43 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @OwenSmith_MP Rules of origin can be decided later in the second phase, either sectorial or general exemption where a significant proportion of a good made in NI receives tariff exemption from the UK. It would be up to the UK&EU to create this in a trade agreement, EU would agree
933099949352411136 2017-11-21 22:28:58 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @OwenSmith_MP NI border re equivalence, would be customs checks at ports but no tarrifs exept for irish goods, ports small & checks 'manageable' as port infrastructure exists, customs required anyway, better at ports. Dods argument of tarif barriers between NI&UK entirely false.
924246846901571584 2017-10-28 12:09:54 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @guyverhofstadt Your squandering the pro-EU good will after brexit among the young Europeans. BTW who are you to decide what is real and fake independence?

846636330121662464 2017-03-28 08:13:25 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @RichardDawkins Yes the argument has always been about political direction,I find it difficult to understand why reasonable people cant see.
846635517320089601 2017-03-28 08:10:11 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @RichardDawkins @18RFC72 she's been deselected unlike half the government
845075604521308160 2017-03-23 00:51:39 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @WingsScotland @jegteg When I read GERS the methods were based on estimates, 4.8% Military spending?? Ignores centralized spending? BALLS!!!

789640217451986945 2016-10-21 01:31:13 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @JamesMelville @LyndaMumshoes Place is Awesome! Its even more progressive than you imagine, trust me, shockingly so.
772127797271732224 2016-09-03 17:43:06 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Del_ivered Good chat ciao El Del!
772127531961114624 2016-09-03 17:42:03 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Del_ivered That will decide Scotland, off to pub to see US, Indian friend, I have dual Irish/UK citizenship, sad the chinese dont drink;)
772125228604518400 2016-09-03 17:32:54 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Del_ivered When Corbyn is re-elected the Labour will distroy the party to 'Get Corbyn', this will also destroy the Scottish Labour v.sad.
772123588841312256 2016-09-03 17:26:23 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Del_ivered :) but I don't think UK can ask Scotland to go on this isolationist path. Unchallanged Tory governments for 20 yrs is too much.
772120810106548224 2016-09-03 17:15:21 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Del_ivered So was I, the world will form 4 main trading blocks, EU, US, China and India which will dominate global politics for 50 more yrs
772119337503186946 2016-09-03 17:09:30 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Del_ivered Its the only example of a member of the UK leaving, the same simple mistakes where made,the UK is Irrelevent now its left the EU
772115754846195713 2016-09-03 16:55:15 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Del_ivered Exactly the same mistakes are being made, Scotland simply wanted home rule as Ireland did, and the voted to stay in the EU too.
772114027023663104 2016-09-03 16:48:23 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Del_ivered If the UK was such a team player why did Ireland leave the UK? Stop voting for governments 'team' Scotland detest or let them go
772080547216646144 2016-09-03 14:35:21 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @workforscotland You realise Westminster runs scotland?Glad we don't see figures for NI/Wales, the Union sucks except for the SE England
772077852795793408 2016-09-03 14:24:39 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @Del_ivered You do realise he supports independence?
767886770071597056 2016-08-22 00:50:47 UTC <CairnanDuffy> @BRWombat @Tesco I personally hate flags(Im from Northern Ireland) but the removal of flags is clear political act, what are you playing at?

719653669210226688 2016-04-11 22:29:39 UTC <CairnanDuffy> Wyoming caucus was corrupt? What about Washington? 73% landslide 0% super delegates (there are 10) #NYPrimary #FeelTheBern #DemocracySpring
719604586634469377 2016-04-11 19:14:37 UTC <CairnanDuffy> Interesting, yesterday Carl Rove heaped praise on Hillary and today its Cheney, she's clearly the one republicans can beat #FeelTheBern
718617138676809728 2016-04-08 01:50:51 UTC <CairnanDuffy> Bush Clinton Bush Obama Clinton....Seriously?
718510986727137281 2016-04-08 18:49:03 UTC <CairnanDuffy> There is a distinct enthusiasm gap at the Clinton rally, These young 'supporters' look forced, go to the Bernie rally, go on go on go on!
