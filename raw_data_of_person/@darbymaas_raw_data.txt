958209087258296320 2018-01-29 05:23:43 UTC <darbymaas> @joekwon80 @fugativedmk This is a great idea. I hope it happens.
956307878335340544 2018-01-24 23:29:00 UTC <darbymaas> @JoeCMiranda  You better not use that joke on me.

943672144533241858 2017-12-20 02:39:06 UTC <darbymaas> Actually Im not good at writing. Im okay. But people say Im good at the other things. Thanks. You too have many talents and bring much joy to people.
943667194142978048 2017-12-20 02:19:26 UTC <darbymaas> If I had talents, I would like to play guitar, write poetry, paint murals, build a house, write a great song, write a great short story, surf, cook like a chef, invest money like a banker, and love like my mom loves me. What talents do you wish you had?
943660518677479425 2017-12-20 01:52:54 UTC <darbymaas> At least you have a talent
942471566377435136 2017-12-17 19:08:26 UTC <darbymaas> @JoeCMiranda What do you think?
942111253073240064 2017-12-16 19:16:40 UTC <darbymaas> @JoeCMiranda I like the one on the left better.
940000997560147969 2017-12-10 23:31:16 UTC <darbymaas> @_emmawallace8 Me too. She is what is getting me through these last weeks of school with all the grading. Should be a great evening.
939992405612281857 2017-12-10 22:57:08 UTC <darbymaas> @_emmawallace8 Hang in there. You got this. You are a badass.
939963188577124354 2017-12-10 21:01:02 UTC <darbymaas> @MattsMoustache @MattBanter The first time I saw him live in 2011. Totally blew my mind with his wit and stage presence. And all the amazing songs and covers he did that night. Completely sold me as a fan for life.
939928290906726400 2017-12-10 18:42:22 UTC <darbymaas> Life is a heros journey. And you better bring humor as one of your allies.
939927015477538816 2017-12-10 18:37:18 UTC <darbymaas> The unfinished business of living is always out in front of you.
939277220249341952 2017-12-08 23:35:14 UTC <darbymaas> @thelumineers @masondiab TRUTH
938976074901291009 2017-12-07 03:38:36 UTC <darbymaas> Im worried it would literally blow her mind. She does not even have a computer.
938972518194413571 2017-12-07 03:24:28 UTC <darbymaas> Nope. My mom has no idea what a me-me is.
938228180766277632 2017-12-05 02:06:44 UTC <darbymaas> @breannaleeeighh That is an amazing novel. So well written and emotionally intense. It works on so many levels. I remember recommending it to you now.
938213925757132805 2017-12-05 01:10:05 UTC <darbymaas> @breannaleeeighh Im getting old and cant remember so well. Are you referring to Gatsby? And it was an absolute pleasure to teach you. Im very excited to hear that you are a writer.
936103462646845441 2017-11-29 05:23:52 UTC <darbymaas> My MIL says my talent is still evolving. I like that.
935883437658988544 2017-11-29 14:49:34 UTC <darbymaas> @JoeCMiranda I like giraffes too!
935363676156059648 2017-11-27 04:24:13 UTC <darbymaas> @colinmeloy I wont!
934618930227789824 2017-11-25 03:04:52 UTC <darbymaas> @eryn_guzzy Where do you work?
931580646157197312 2017-11-17 17:51:48 UTC <darbymaas> @KyleRay This is totally true!
929910459544739840 2017-11-12 03:15:05 UTC <darbymaas> @MaioccoNBCS Very sad day. I was at Chico when they got rid of their program.
929554629725007874 2017-11-11 03:41:08 UTC <darbymaas> One time was at Tae Kwon Do. Someone stepped on my toe, and my toenail ended up falling off.
929552592014688257 2017-11-11 03:33:02 UTC <darbymaas> This is true. Until they get smashed or ripped off. This has happened to me two times. Extremely painful.
926235980905902081 2017-11-02 23:54:01 UTC <darbymaas> @JoeCMiranda Sometimes we just dont see what is right in front of us.
926190105340944384 2017-11-02 20:51:43 UTC <darbymaas> @JoeCMiranda Im right here!
923912127974326272 2017-10-27 13:59:51 UTC <darbymaas> @oneryantownsend @fugativedmk I went to a @prophiphop show a few years ago. Great show. He is so smart and articulate with his message.
923401383608385537 2017-10-25 04:10:20 UTC <darbymaas> @renabakk God I love a good Kafka joke/reference. Well done.
922653536634073088 2017-10-23 02:38:39 UTC <darbymaas> @SacRepublicFC @USL @SwopeRangers @oneliferight Hear! Hear!
921853731624255488 2017-10-21 21:40:31 UTC <darbymaas> What are some of your favorite songs?
919357855005687808 2017-10-14 00:22:48 UTC <darbymaas> Just smile. Give a warm thought. And everything should be fine.
919356598107041792 2017-10-14 00:17:48 UTC <darbymaas> You probably intimidated the squirrel
918669475892752384 2017-10-12 02:47:25 UTC <darbymaas> Some of my memories of my dead friends and family make me very happy.
918266082409963521 2017-10-11 00:04:29 UTC <darbymaas> All the time. Its why I love music.
917974550792622080 2017-10-10 04:46:02 UTC <darbymaas> @vladaskylar That is very sad
917226007857291265 2017-10-08 03:11:36 UTC <darbymaas> @JoeCMiranda Take me with you!
914844766277312513 2017-10-02 13:29:23 UTC <darbymaas> 23. One of them told me.
913243415281852418 2017-09-27 03:26:12 UTC <darbymaas> Yes. Yes. Yes. I just started watching the first season all over again. So good.
911767143959601152 2017-09-23 01:40:01 UTC <darbymaas> @al_mcdreams We stayed at a house in Fort Bragg once that had a lot of jars of these pieces of glass.
911663843280949248 2017-09-23 18:49:32 UTC <darbymaas> @Tyler_Eastman Look out world
910310268030271488 2017-09-19 01:10:55 UTC <darbymaas> Nope

892223087386574848 2017-07-31 03:18:55 UTC <darbymaas> @URANGO25 The cold misses you.
891156753009713152 2017-07-28 04:41:41 UTC <darbymaas> @RayWoodson925 I loved listening to you on KNBR. I wish the best in your next endeavors.
891155927763529728 2017-07-28 04:38:24 UTC <darbymaas> @elena_wallace Coincidence? I don't believe in coincidences! 
887169164837662720 2017-07-17 04:36:26 UTC <darbymaas> I really like the Glorious video from @macklemore. So sweet. And it features the best parts of Modesto!
884145231964233729 2017-07-09 20:20:24 UTC <darbymaas> @JoeCMiranda You will be. Senior year and graduation was just a dream.
883473515449417729 2017-07-07 23:51:14 UTC <darbymaas> I know it's been said before, but people watching at Disneyland is awesome.
881235967239114752 2017-07-01 19:40:01 UTC <darbymaas> @JoeCMiranda Exactly. Very funny movie.
881230867472850944 2017-07-01 19:19:45 UTC <darbymaas> I just watched "Good Burger." So that's how my morning is going.
