879319490533756928 2017-06-26 12:44:38 UTC <drinkwine247> @realDonaldTrump So you admit the Russia thing is real? Just resign already!
879316734129451008 2017-06-26 12:33:40 UTC <drinkwine247> I guess facts are not a republican thing. Remember "Both sides do it" is a horseshit argument. Right @MakeItPlain :)https://twitter.com/zachwahls/status/878763918402793472
879316367257858048 2017-06-26 12:32:13 UTC <drinkwine247> @thehill Susan Collins explanation sounded like a hostage statement. Lol.

878717412589412353 2017-06-24 20:52:11 UTC <drinkwine247> @realDonaldTrump Nope, instead they want to kill thousands of people by destroying the health care market in this country. #SINGLEPAYER

877622133878173696 2017-06-21 20:19:56 UTC <drinkwine247> @kylegriffin1 It's like putting your brain in a blender.

877583378119364608 2017-06-21 17:45:56 UTC <drinkwine247> @justicedems @cenkuygur @JeffreyPHill He apparently is ignoring the last 40 years of that district not even being close!

802850075529637888 2016-11-27 12:22:28 UTC <drinkwine247> I demand that @realDonaldTrump apologizes to the families of the over 6,000 people he scammed in Trump U fraud. #Apologize (only fair)
802799246932111360 2016-11-27 09:00:30 UTC <drinkwine247> @WhitfordBradley that will only happen when we control state houses again. So that needs to be priority number 1 for the next two years!!!
802793570616963072 2016-11-27 08:37:57 UTC <drinkwine247> @realDonaldTrump do you not want a fair count of all the votes?

802685606975434752 2016-11-26 01:28:56 UTC <drinkwine247> @PolitikMasFina @marcorubio technically he doesn't show up enough to be a real senator, so instead he is a senator from Florida.
802661017578852352 2016-11-26 23:51:13 UTC <drinkwine247> @JoyAnnReid I need Morning Joy instead of Morning Crap for once!

802258610927583232 2016-11-25 21:12:12 UTC <drinkwine247> Can we at least partially blame Obama for continuing to push the TPP at the end of the campaign when it was clear it was DOA. Just sayin.

801588327300349956 2016-11-23 00:48:44 UTC <drinkwine247> @GottaLaff I will admit, I love how angry his sycophants are about him saying no to Clinton Prosecution. (Not that he could do that anyway)

801574139395981317 2016-11-23 23:52:22 UTC <drinkwine247> @ananavarro @CNN problem is Trump did it to Make Henry McMaster the Governor, not for the betterment of Nikki Haley or the Country!!
801572754357096452 2016-11-23 23:46:51 UTC <drinkwine247> @AlexMorash it makes me want to slam my head into a wall over and over again!
801569664216219653 2016-11-23 23:34:35 UTC <drinkwine247> @DrJillStein @AlexMorash I mean Michigan Clinton lost by 10,000...Stein got 50k+ votes. Now she cares.

801415288243834880 2016-11-23 13:21:08 UTC <drinkwine247> @PolitikMasFina @SenSanders @Medium one thing to not forget here, is his message never resonated with people of color en masse. So maybe...
801413902047309824 2016-11-23 13:15:38 UTC <drinkwine247> @JoyAnnReid Harold Ford is everything that has ever been wrong with the Democratic Party, can we stop calling him a Dem?!

800870412842307584 2016-11-21 01:16:00 UTC <drinkwine247> @jbouie mainly because they have an "Af-Am or Jewish or Latino" friend so therefor they "can't" in their minds be racist :)

798146502581485568 2016-11-14 12:52:09 UTC <drinkwine247> @kylegriffin1 ahhhh got it. Only dumb people who didn't go to college or serve can be racist. #ReinceisWrong
798145655126560768 2016-11-14 12:48:47 UTC <drinkwine247> @MSignorile please please please talk about this fact every day on your program (I know you will ;) ) We cannot normalize this!!!!!

798144940710559744 2016-11-14 12:45:57 UTC <drinkwine247> @Reuters call Bannon the racist he is. Not a firebrand, more like a flame throwing gasoline can.
798142846402371584 2016-11-14 12:37:38 UTC <drinkwine247> @Beer__Wolf @wpjenna I have heard people called that, but it was probably the first time in Bannon's life it happened ;)
798140557189120001 2016-11-14 12:28:32 UTC <drinkwine247> @wpjenna the normalization of hate continues....
798102242830254080 2016-11-14 09:56:17 UTC <drinkwine247> @Slate of course it didn't, cause he said so. Lol

797865378881961985 2016-11-13 18:15:04 UTC <drinkwine247> @DiamondandSilk @jackieaus I didn't, the Supreme Court of the United States of America did.

797863731002806272 2016-11-13 18:08:31 UTC <drinkwine247> @DiamondandSilk @jackieaus good try, the flag is completely legal to be burned. Supreme Court decided that in 1990.

796295566032506881 2016-11-09 10:17:12 UTC <drinkwine247> @BernieSanders @DrJillStein only Bernie lost Wisconsin by less votes than Dr Stein received. That does matter.

790627529774301184 2016-10-24 18:54:26 UTC <drinkwine247> @voxdotcom @mattyglesias makes me question the whole point of Stein. She has no governing coalition, where would she get votes from?

788937771402551296 2016-10-19 02:59:57 UTC <drinkwine247> @RaulLabrador4ID turns out they had every right to protest as they had more votes in Florida and in the US. What's your point?

788912936135880704 2016-10-19 01:21:15 UTC <drinkwine247> @JoyAnnReid she is schooling him so hard right now!
788910309431975936 2016-10-19 01:10:49 UTC <drinkwine247> @KatyTurNBC what does that even mean?
787610720615759872 2016-10-16 11:06:43 UTC <drinkwine247> @deanofcomedy @Hostage_Notes conveniently leaves out the rest of the sentence and context. #Trumpsexassault
787493271941636097 2016-10-15 03:20:01 UTC <drinkwine247> @CBSNews call me when there is anything of value in there. Yawn.
