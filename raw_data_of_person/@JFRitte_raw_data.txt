888458131537317888 2017-07-21 17:58:19 UTC <JFRitte> @toadmeister @hd_m01 Strictly speaking, prev poll overridden by next, so act for ref should be clear on terms. But yes, need constitutional reform badly.
888456758271893506 2017-07-21 17:52:52 UTC <JFRitte> @toadmeister @hd_m01 Law, not constitution. No written constitution.

888456413592383493 2017-07-21 17:51:30 UTC <JFRitte> @toadmeister @hd_m01 Yes. Bit naughty really, as the act in the commons was only passed by stating 'advisory only'.

888451670006476804 2017-07-21 17:32:39 UTC <JFRitte> @toadmeister @hd_m01 Because the first was "what would you think?" So the 2nd would be "this is the deal. Still want to?"

873957727441219584 2017-06-11 17:38:54 UTC <JFRitte> @NCPoliticsUK @devlinukr It was a poll. Nothing more.
873956721944928256 2017-06-11 17:34:54 UTC <JFRitte> @NCPoliticsUK @ecmagenda I'm remain. Voted for NHS and Police.

873921483311116288 2017-06-11 15:14:52 UTC <JFRitte> @dontbrexitfixit I'd have one in October!
873920955852234752 2017-06-11 15:12:47 UTC <JFRitte> @DoktorG @jamesmfahy Not mine, matey. So that means some people are going against some other people. How does that compute?
873920230036295681 2017-06-11 15:09:54 UTC <JFRitte> @OwenJones84 @jeremycorbyn I voted for your party to stop the Tories, to fix NHS. Not on the basis of Brexit.

873915432595533824 2017-06-11 14:50:50 UTC <JFRitte> @BorisJohnson @vegantittie @LiamCFallon 1997, 2001 & 2006. And 2010 could be argued too, making at least three on the bounce.

873872451696046080 2017-06-11 12:00:02 UTC <JFRitte> @piersmorgan @jolovesjuice @MadeinCalcio Fair taxation?
873872389435793408 2017-06-11 11:59:48 UTC <JFRitte> @piersmorgan @MadeinCalcio @jolovesjuice Freedom from thinking of survival, and think of "why not try it?"
873872131003514880 2017-06-11 11:58:46 UTC <JFRitte> @piersmorgan @MadeinCalcio @jolovesjuice Not really. Everyone gets paid a basic wage for being. You then have choice to do what interests you, and try to make more money.

873861290774724609 2017-06-11 11:15:41 UTC <JFRitte> @piersmorgan @jolovesjuice @MadeinCalcio Don't think that is EU at fault either, employers again.
873861060561973249 2017-06-11 11:14:47 UTC <JFRitte> @piersmorgan @jolovesjuice @MadeinCalcio Have right idea with paying everybody enough to live off.
873860903304925184 2017-06-11 11:14:09 UTC <JFRitte> @piersmorgan @jolovesjuice @MadeinCalcio Unfortunately, in many roles, there's not a lot to be done about that - but it was same fear in time of Ludd & Thimonnier. But Finns might..
873860007758110721 2017-06-11 11:10:36 UTC <JFRitte> @piersmorgan @jolovesjuice @MadeinCalcio That's not the EU - that's employers unfettered by correct regulation, able to pay migrants < min wage. Don't think it's the same in GER.
873859472975953920 2017-06-11 11:08:28 UTC <JFRitte> @piersmorgan @jolovesjuice @MadeinCalcio Those aren't true. Even TMs A50 white paper said so!
873849832309497856 2017-06-11 10:30:10 UTC <JFRitte> @piersmorgan @MadeinCalcio @jolovesjuice Ok, please enlighten me: where is this going? In your opinion?
873835734494572545 2017-06-11 09:34:08 UTC <JFRitte> @piersmorgan @jolovesjuice @MadeinCalcio And where do you think they got the idea, if this is true? I understood idea was enhanced integrated border force, nothing more.
873647744514174976 2017-06-10 21:07:08 UTC <JFRitte> @HAT_London @dontbrexitfixit @AdamGCarrick Agree. Vote for the situation in hand, and the policies on offer.
873646809326944256 2017-06-10 21:03:25 UTC <JFRitte> @dontbrexitfixit @EricaNeustadt @leoniedelt FPTP is antiquated and not fit for purpose. PR would solve a lot of problems like voter apathy. Means no need for tactical too.
873646184107323396 2017-06-10 21:00:56 UTC <JFRitte> @jolovesjuice @NorfhammerX Smoke me a kipper ;-)
873646020600750086 2017-06-10 21:00:17 UTC <JFRitte> @jolovesjuice @NorfhammerX May has had 7 years to do this, and didn't.
873645830087073792 2017-06-10 20:59:32 UTC <JFRitte> @jolovesjuice @NorfhammerX Not true. They've just never taken the opportunity to implement the controls that are available in the agreements.
873628630403907584 2017-06-10 19:51:11 UTC <JFRitte> @piersmorgan @jolovesjuice Except those aren't true. Particularly not the immigration, and oh, the EU army too...
873621049803407360 2017-06-10 19:21:04 UTC <JFRitte> @Cosmic_Carol In a glass! Ironically, though...
873605055643103232 2017-06-10 18:17:30 UTC <JFRitte> @piersmorgan @LewisKing7 Because leaving will hurt our economy, leaving hard will cripple it.
873604494797438978 2017-06-10 18:15:17 UTC <JFRitte> @piersmorgan @BostonRacing @robjgrace Yes, please provide evidence.
873604152571682816 2017-06-10 18:13:55 UTC <JFRitte> @piersmorgan @DanielTuttle Democracy must include ability to change your mind. To turn it around: you therefore should accept the 1975 ref to stay in.

873599089245638656 2017-06-10 17:53:48 UTC <JFRitte> @piersmorgan @AliBunkallSKY @aapriestley Easy: "a democracy that cannot change its mind is no longer a democracy". Hence elections held regularly.

872335553341136896 2017-06-06 06:12:57 UTC <JFRitte> @acgrayling I have two very good reasons to not vote May. 1) She's s Tory. 2) she isn't standing in my constituency.

871850126091964416 2017-06-05 22:04:02 UTC <JFRitte> @DesignSparkRS No, but it I s dangerous to go blindly without backups and system redundancy. Basic ITIL.

871063810605551617 2017-06-03 17:59:30 UTC <JFRitte> @grahamlithgow If JC wins, clean Brexit. If May wins, difficult awkward Brexit. Alliances demand negotiation: Brexit could be put to bed.

870929566616911873 2017-06-03 09:06:04 UTC <JFRitte> @JohnCleese @Godfather19811 @Priest_of_Ramen But this GE is Brexit. But I guess even that needn't be forever. I fear some have to see the other side to see the greener grass we left.
