798098361127579649 2016-11-14 09:40:51 UTC <SpencerYK> "I do notknow how"  was his usual negative answer meaning "not so, that is nottrue, I do not want to," etc.  
798097490683662336 2016-11-14 09:37:24 UTC <SpencerYK> but as soon ashe himself began to lose he did not pay anyone and saying "I do notknow how" put the money in his pocket and left the game.
798096617958014977 2016-11-14 09:33:56 UTC <SpencerYK> Once the ladies purposely lost some money  to him playingdominos: he was  delighted and took  the money willingly,
798095255551627264 2016-11-14 09:28:31 UTC <SpencerYK> Thenonly did he stop saving them and wore them around morefreely.
798093354634395648 2016-11-14 09:20:58 UTC <SpencerYK> ...but had been given him by the Company only for a time and would be taken away from him upon his departure and replaced by newones.
798092813065850882 2016-11-14 09:18:49 UTC <SpencerYK> As a result, he often suffered from colds and coughs  and we  were compelled to tell him that' all these things were nothis own,
798091974632828928 2016-11-14 09:15:29 UTC <SpencerYK> ...and would put it on only when ascending the stairs  and would then putit away in a safeplace.
798090373100777473 2016-11-14 09:09:07 UTC <SpencerYK> He took such goodcare of it that when coming to see me he would carry it over his arm...
798089088481914880 2016-11-14 09:04:01 UTC <SpencerYK> For the winter  the Company supplied him with very good winter clothing, which he  liked  very much, especially the wolf-skin fur coat.
798086842826432513 2016-11-14 08:55:05 UTC <SpencerYK> ...but at home he would wear the most dilapidated clothing  that should have long since discarded.
798084534239522816 2016-11-14 08:45:55 UTC <SpencerYK> In #StPetersburg he loved to dresswell when  going out ,
798082064666898432 2016-11-14 08:36:06 UTC <SpencerYK> In spite of all that,  he was always picking up bits if rags, pieces of string, broken needles and such trash and hiding them in his trunk.
798080241033826304 2016-11-14 08:28:51 UTC <SpencerYK> The officerswere constantly giving himthingsand he had many things that he did not need at all .
798077471509737472 2016-11-14 08:17:51 UTC <SpencerYK> He had only one noticeable vice: his  stinginess. On the sloop  we supplied him with clothing,  underwear, and all that was necessary.
798074715784941568 2016-11-14 08:06:54 UTC <SpencerYK> He did not like strong  drinks and detested  drunken people, but for sweet  things he had a particular liking .
