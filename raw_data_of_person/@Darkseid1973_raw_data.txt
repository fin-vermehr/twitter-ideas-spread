971163017160351752 2018-03-06 23:18:01 UTC <Darkseid1973> @rhonda_harbison @JS_Ingersoll Point is, if the country voted on whether or not to ban guns, and the majority voted in favor of banning them, would you respect that,  considering that it would be the will of the people, or no?

959355553301622784 2018-02-02 09:19:22 UTC <Darkseid1973> @voxdotcom Point is Trump doesn't get to take credit for the drop. Obama took office in Jan 09. Up until Oct 09, he was still working under Bush's fiscal policies. Black unemployment started to slowly drop as a result of Obama's policy.

958561768107896832 2018-01-30 04:45:09 UTC <Darkseid1973> @Freeyourmindkid @IamCaptainAmer1 That might have to do with the fact that white pride always translated to AND came at the expense of other races.

Since the subject was white supremacy and the negative effect it's had on black and brown people, is safe to assume that her 'hard work' comment was directed at us.

932332989366890498 2017-11-19 19:41:21 UTC <Darkseid1973> @TcatdaGod @2coldcoronas This from the side that's pushing to elect a pedophile (looking at yoy Roy Moore) to the US Senate?
932331160595849216 2017-11-19 19:34:05 UTC <Darkseid1973> @TINAHILLSTROM1 @tariqnasheed It's also interesting to note that while Trump has been rage tweeting about the Ball family, he's all but ignored the issue Roy Moore running for Senator despite mounting evidence that the man is a pedophile.
932328620118421507 2017-11-19 19:23:59 UTC <Darkseid1973> @TINAHILLSTROM1 @tariqnasheed And it's especially rich when you consider how the opioid epidemic in white communities is being treated as a health issue, not a criminal one.
932328193196949504 2017-11-19 19:22:17 UTC <Darkseid1973> @TINAHILLSTROM1 @tariqnasheed Yet we're the same country that has a history of locking up black and brown people for years for the 'crime' of being drug addicts. Yet here we are, telling another country that their sentencing laws are inhumane.
932326711584227328 2017-11-19 19:16:24 UTC <Darkseid1973> @TINAHILLSTROM1 @tariqnasheed At what point did I mention Obama? Secondly, it doesn't necessarily have to be just stealing. What would be your reaction if the crime was rape or murder?
932322476226416642 2017-11-19 18:59:34 UTC <Darkseid1973> @TINAHILLSTROM1 @tariqnasheed Don't need you to tell me that I made a good point. Answer the question. What would be your reaction?
932321115116011520 2017-11-19 18:54:10 UTC <Darkseid1973> @tariqnasheed @TINAHILLSTROM1 That might something to do with Obama respecting the autonomy of sovereign nations.
932320715688304641 2017-11-19 18:52:34 UTC <Darkseid1973> @TINAHILLSTROM1 @tariqnasheed Now ask yourself this: how would you feel if a foreigner committed a crime on US soil, and the leader of that person's country intervened on their behalf and helped them avoid punishment. Would you react the same way?

932318251803168769 2017-11-19 18:42:47 UTC <Darkseid1973> @tariqnasheed @TINAHILLSTROM1 Thing is you don't really want diversity and equality, you just want black people to stop calling white people out on their bs
