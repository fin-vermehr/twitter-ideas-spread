971082010407194626 2018-03-06 17:56:07 UTC <allanjruter> @realDonaldTrump But how do you really feel, @TheRickyDavila?  I'm with you:  "hate" has no place in my vocabulary except for That Person.  Never have I loathed someone the way I loathe him. #TrumplandIsKafkaland

970864203874566145 2018-03-05 03:30:38 UTC <allanjruter> @elliothannon @kcalamur Hmmm.  Cold comfort that the Canadian PM is capable of embarassing his country, even though it's pretty much a one-off event.  "Down South," a/k/a USA, it's our Daily Normal.  #TrumplandIsKafkaland
970863248735121408 2018-03-05 03:26:50 UTC <allanjruter> @elliothannon I taught fiction for 33 years and didn't expect that factoid from anybody.  Wow.  #NotFakeNews

970860916056223744 2018-03-05 03:17:34 UTC <allanjruter> . . . but you're not surprised, just newly indignant, right, @KevinMKruse?  Every day a new adventure in Fox News-inspired indignation.  #TrumplandIsKafkaland #HannityTheGreatPoser
970860517106610182 2018-03-05 03:15:59 UTC <allanjruter> @SRuhle Second your motion, @sruhle.  Though I'm not frustrated, I'm intrigued.  Puzzled.  Perturbed.

970785520874938368 2018-03-05 22:17:59 UTC <allanjruter> @danpfeiffer No, apparently.  To hear him repeatedly bemoaning having to spend "80" hours on this task makes me think a) he doesn't organize his emails into folders or labels, and b) he must keep everything instead of pruning the collection as most of us do.  Geez, already.
970728666362720256 2018-03-05 18:32:03 UTC <allanjruter> @danpfeiffer Give "The Shape of Water" a viewing, Dan.  It's unusual but deeply compelling.
970423291667255298 2018-03-04 22:18:36 UTC <allanjruter> I know of only two people, @AriMelber, who could unload "tautological ephemera" with seeming ease.  And I'm one of them.  You remain The.Dude. #EgregiouslyVerbalWithoutRepentance

969661082825560064 2018-03-02 19:49:52 UTC <allanjruter> @TomiLahren But you certainly know jack about snark.  In fact, it's all you know.  How you sleep well--or, for that matter, look at yourself in the mirror at 3 a.m.--is beyond me.  WAY BEYOND.

967541487075553280 2018-02-24 23:27:21 UTC <allanjruter> Exactly, @SethAbramson.  Such a tidy little distinction.  But hardly tidy and not at all little.  #NotFakeNews
967540315031785472 2018-02-24 23:22:41 UTC <allanjruter> @NBCNews Well, then.  A single tweet tucks this controversy right into bed.  AS IF!  Trouble is, of course, the Trumpists will not bother to read it.  #NotFakeNews #TrumplandIsKafkaland

The very idea, as @realDonaldTrump would tweet, is SAD!  Actually, it's appalling.
966484146968199168 2018-02-21 01:25:51 UTC <allanjruter> @JRubinBlogger @JubinBlogger, always remember that men--and I do speak in the aggregate--reserve the unique right to stupidity.  Sometimes they come to their senses, even.
966483820760444928 2018-02-21 01:24:33 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill Tenney later defended her remarks as standing up "for law-abiding citizens who are smeared by anti-gun liberal elitists."   "Law-abiding"?  Check.  "Anti-gun"?  Check.  "Liberal"?  Nope, just left of center.  "Elitists"?  Hardly.  I taught public school for 33 years.

963648093731414016 2018-02-13 05:36:23 UTC <allanjruter> Excellent opinion piece from the erudite Eugene Robinson.  Why, oh why, didn't Trump pursue infrastructure first?  Who, oh who, urged him to pursue Obamacare destruction and $1.5 trillion of tax cuts first?  #CantFigureThisOneOuthttps://twitter.com/Eugene_Robinson/status/963374917856186368
963647772812627968 2018-02-13 05:35:07 UTC <allanjruter> @Eugene_Robinson Who do you suppose counseled Trump to forego infrastructure as his initial legislative push and instead pursue Obamacare repeal and $1.5 trillion in tax cuts?  As bizarre as it feels to write this, Trump could have forged a national majority instead of his much-heralded "base."

940241068104339456 2017-12-11 15:25:14 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill Excuse me.  I should have worn a raincoat to read this post.  I am drenched in irony right now.  More steaming swill from Kellyanne's kitchen crock. #TrumplandIsKafkaland
939578987571023873 2017-12-09 19:34:21 UTC <allanjruter> @SteveKingIA @derekjGZ Ditto to the nth power.  Whenever, in conversation with my mother, I refer to King as "your Congressman, Mom," she snarls at me.

937878685268480001 2017-12-04 02:57:58 UTC <allanjruter> @derekjGZ Just learned from my sons during Thanksgiving week the meaning of AF, and have been using it ever since.  #NotFakeAcronyms

935990460992180225 2017-11-29 21:54:50 UTC <allanjruter> @HuffPostPol One must wonder if the President has ongoing lower GI difficulties, given the likelihood that he tweets while sitting. #TrumplandIsKafkaland

913617491062136832 2017-09-28 04:12:38 UTC <allanjruter> @TheEconomist So I'll cry "Uncle":  Bring on a concon and let the old Confederacy secede once and for all, with soft borders.  I'm so over them.

913116100602318848 2017-09-27 19:00:17 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill So many options for responding.  Decency forbids, however.
913018352116920321 2017-09-27 12:31:52 UTC <allanjruter> @realDonaldTrump You forget, Mr. President--or you've never known--that the filibuster was instated to promote compromise.  Try saying that word once a day.

904559579790536704 2017-09-03 04:19:44 UTC <allanjruter> @danpfeiffer And he dangled it in front of us like a TV reality host.  Cruel and capricious, indeed.  All about erasing Obama's legacy, I'm convinced.
904049318344183811 2017-09-02 18:32:08 UTC <allanjruter> @POTUS @markknoller The hooey just doesn't stop rolling in, does it?  So now Harvey was "a wonderful thing."  #NotFakeNews #TrumpesqueKafkaesque
903718786783748098 2017-09-01 20:38:43 UTC <allanjruter> @HilaryPsycho710 Now THAT comment, in a pun on your Twitter handle, is "HilariousPsycho"!
903718161094246400 2017-09-01 20:36:14 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill And if Fox says it, we know it's "Fair and Balanced," even if the subject of the poll is not. #NotFakeNews #TrumpesqueKafkaesque
903367680459243520 2017-08-31 21:23:33 UTC <allanjruter> Today's homecooked crock by Kellyanne.  "Fox & Friends" unlocked the padded cell again to let Mean Girl out to play.  #TrumpesqueKafkaesquehttps://twitter.com/thehill/status/903334110369861633
903367356768014338 2017-08-31 21:22:16 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill Oh, I get it now:  The three "Fox & Friends" stooges have the key to Kellyanne's padded cell.  And they let the Mean Girl out again. Oooooh.
903076286091984898 2017-08-30 02:05:39 UTC <allanjruter> Read this and weep.  And remember, friends, it's only Wednesday.  So pour yourself a hefty something.  #NotFakeNews #TrumpesqueKafkaesquehttps://twitter.com/RobbieGramer/status/902939366611460096
903076046408429568 2017-08-30 02:04:42 UTC <allanjruter> @maggieNYT @RobbieGramer Of all our current political atrocities, noisier and quieter, this one is worth shedding tears over.  #NotFakeNews #TrumpesqueKafkaesque
903074666134335492 2017-08-30 01:59:13 UTC <allanjruter> @PressSec @maggieNYT @AndrewBeatty . . . and, once again, the irony and hypocrisy drip, drip, drip.  In this case, they pour down.  #NotFakeNews #TrumpesqueKafkaesque
903071648315842562 2017-08-30 01:47:13 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill Agreed, breathe deeply, and stop venting. #NotFakeNews
903071311035076608 2017-08-30 01:45:53 UTC <allanjruter> @danpfeiffer Precisely right, Dan.  As David Brooks wrote recently, when Trump leaves the White House, we just can't flip the switch back. Decades, yes.
902885351567581184 2017-08-30 13:26:57 UTC <allanjruter> @danpfeiffer @ValerieJarrett "Those were the days, my friends / We hoped they'd never end . . . ."

902690717583147008 2017-08-29 00:33:32 UTC <allanjruter> @chrislhayes Chris Christie cristified you just now.  You asked great questions, but you need to breathe deeply and SLOW DOWN. Truly!
902620824414408705 2017-08-29 19:55:49 UTC <allanjruter> @DemWrite Wow. There's a lot of bitterness and resentment in this piece that strays from its supposed focus.  Harshness overcomes meaning.
902619548385501186 2017-08-29 19:50:44 UTC <allanjruter> Whew!  This is as blistering as David Brooks ever gets.  It's apocalyptic, in fact.  #NotFakeNews #TrumpesqueKafkaesquehttps://twitter.com/Peter_Wehner/status/902609429908029440
902618191460839426 2017-08-29 19:45:21 UTC <allanjruter> Yep, I guess there are millions of us just as "Crooked" as She Who Should Be Our President. #NotFakeNews #TrumpesqueKafkaesque

901479879031631872 2017-08-26 16:22:06 UTC <allanjruter> @jacobsoboroff Hardly just coincidental and anything BUT ironic.  Yes, Jacob, "Unreal" works.  So does REPREHENSIBLE.  #TrumpesqueKafkaesque
901135678238584832 2017-08-25 17:34:22 UTC <allanjruter> @derekjGZ Instead of doing something productive this afternoon, I think I'll hang out on Twitter and brag about myself.  #TrumpesqueKafkaesque
900935003453796352 2017-08-24 04:16:58 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill @MommaTNYC Great visual.  I'm an old English teacher and disgusted by DJTrump's inability to spell well.  You pass the class, take the cake, whatever.
900934270247743488 2017-08-24 04:14:03 UTC <allanjruter> @neiltyson Lovely.  Resonant.  Reassuring.  TGIF.
900933723708960768 2017-08-24 04:11:52 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill @MommaTNYC Yep.  And you spelled every word correctly, which doesn't surprise me because you care enough and think enough.  Keep caring and thinking.
900932667365052416 2017-08-24 04:07:41 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill . . . because he doesn't have one, nor ever did.  Again, again, and again.  #WorstPresidentEver #NotFakeNews #TrumpesqueKafkaesque

900931199618732032 2017-08-24 04:01:51 UTC <allanjruter> @ConnieSchultz My son works for a CLE start-up and is rehabbing a 1920s Shaker Hts home.  He needs to meet you.
900930647203741697 2017-08-24 03:59:39 UTC <allanjruter> @ConnieSchultz You were splendid on tonight's "11th Hour."  Keep showing up there and elsewhere.  #NotFakeNews #TrumpesqueKafkaesque
900930206646579200 2017-08-24 03:57:54 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill Oh, please.  Can we start considering senators who are younger than 70?  High time!  #NotFakeNews
900858582480158720 2017-08-24 23:13:17 UTC <allanjruter> Start your weekend early, friends, with this home-cooked crock by Kellyanne.  TGIF (almost)!  #NotFakeNews #TrumpesqueKafkaesquehttps://twitter.com/politico/status/900822553874358272
900858272412045312 2017-08-24 23:12:03 UTC <allanjruter> @politico Kellyanne as Democrat Whisperer?  To quote my late dad, "And they wonder why we drink."  #NotFakeNews #TrumpesqueKafkaesque
900413220980051969 2017-08-23 17:43:35 UTC <allanjruter> Yup.  Just that.  #NotFakeNews #TrumpesqueKafkaesquehttps://twitter.com/adamcbest/status/900202742815260672

900373416309436416 2017-08-23 15:05:25 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill Or just plain narcissism tinged by outright indifference to facts.  #NotFakeNews #TrumpesqueKafkaesque
900207453639409664 2017-08-22 04:05:56 UTC <allanjruter> @Eugene_Robinson And thank you, Mr. Robinson, for your incisive perspective in Da Post and on MSNBC.  #NotFakeNews #TrumpesqueKafkaesque
900205372958539781 2017-08-22 03:57:40 UTC <allanjruter> @SykesCharlie @HotlineJosh Thank you, Josh, for a substantive reaction.  That's what we need.  #NotFakeNews #TrumpesqueKafkaesque
900204639735472129 2017-08-22 03:54:45 UTC <allanjruter> @MSNBC @DrPhilGoff EXACTLY!  I watched that moment and echo your thought.  Just for grins, I checked out CNN and Fox.  Both broadcast the event silently.
900202904044408837 2017-08-22 03:47:51 UTC <allanjruter> @danpfeiffer Can't click a heart on this sentiment, Dan.  But I'm with you.  And whiskey and red wine consumption is up to a dangerous level.
900202665950445568 2017-08-22 03:46:55 UTC <allanjruter> @maggieNYT @zdroberts And so it goes.  Once again, once again. #TrumpesqueKafkaesque #NotFakeNews
900081753108492288 2017-08-22 19:46:27 UTC <allanjruter> @J_D_Landis Scared, frankly, to know.  More than 30% is my guess, and I hope that's high.

898376160492519427 2017-08-17 02:49:02 UTC <allanjruter> @Lawrence You and Bill Moyers:  How about you two at least once weekly?  Your duo has The Last Word on sanity, sincerity, and insight.

895706930471026688 2017-08-10 18:02:28 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill Pretty deep snark for a former preacher.  What's with these guys feeling the urge to criticize opinionated women so often?

895371690565390336 2017-08-09 19:50:20 UTC <allanjruter> @yashar And Stephen Miller could be asked to join the cast of SNL for remarks like this one. #trumpesquekafkaesque #NotFakeNews
895371240751468548 2017-08-09 19:48:33 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill Well, yes, Ron Johnson, McCain's brain tumor may certainly have influenced his vote--but for the better, not in the way you construct it.
895370798898315264 2017-08-09 19:46:48 UTC <allanjruter> @danpfeiffer Just when the week couldn't possibly get weirder/darker/more cynically ironic, it just did.  #trumpesquekafkaesque #NotFakeNews
894602411863662593 2017-08-07 16:53:30 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill He's hardly the savvy Midwestern farmer he wants us to think.  He gets crankier by the week, but with a fervent Trump base back in Iowa.
894601751873060866 2017-08-07 16:50:53 UTC <allanjruter> @nytimes @CillizzaCNN Pence joined Trump's ticket last year precisely as a way to emerge out of, aside from, or in front of the pack.  #NotFakeNews

Dark, but true.  #trumpesquekafkaesque #NotFakeNews
893165585823039492 2017-08-03 17:44:04 UTC <allanjruter> @CillizzaCNN And then there's Minnesota:  "Where Michelle Bachman should be named Queen."
893165397406617600 2017-08-03 17:43:19 UTC <allanjruter> @CillizzaCNN Try this one for Illinois:  "The state with more governors in prison than any other."  Long but, sadly, true.
893164536324292608 2017-08-03 17:39:54 UTC <allanjruter> @CillizzaCNN As for Illinois:  "sleazy politics Illinois," "corrupt machine Illinois"?  "Sleazy" has a nice ring to it.  You've got me going, Chris!
893164236972716033 2017-08-03 17:38:42 UTC <allanjruter> @CillizzaCNN "migrant-worker-haven Iowa"?  "migrant-worker-farms Iowa"?  Hyperbolic and sinister.  You could use "meth-factory," but there's competition.
892967186091868160 2017-08-02 04:35:42 UTC <allanjruter> @AnneFrankCenter Brilliant.  #trumpesquekafkaesque
892966374984888320 2017-08-02 04:32:28 UTC <allanjruter> @JohnJHarwood Yoursimple post, John, is at least a triple redundancy, perhaps a quadruple.  Such times as these.  #trumpesquekafkaesque
892965792014364673 2017-08-02 04:30:09 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill Whoa, now:  SH Sanders on Hannity falsely debasing a CNN reporter?  Isn't that a triple redundancy AND a lie?  #trumpesquekafakesque
892965113195622403 2017-08-02 04:27:28 UTC <allanjruter> @NateSilver538 How low can he go?  #trumpesquekafkaesque
892964977065299968 2017-08-02 04:26:55 UTC <allanjruter> @AriMelber D-bag.  Just that.  Utterly that.  Skin-crawlingly offensive.  #trumpesquekafkaesque
892803548404174848 2017-08-02 17:45:28 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill Well, I'll be!  Nate Silver of 538 reported Trump's approval at 37.8%.   How low can it go? #nofakenewshere #trumpesquekafkaesque
892802792355704850 2017-08-02 17:42:27 UTC <allanjruter> Numbers don't lie.  #nofakenewshere #trumpesquekafkaesquehttps://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/892485336990982144
892802555025272832 2017-08-02 17:41:31 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill Any more proof needed that The Mooch is Trump's Mini-Me?  Their knee-jerk defense after outrageous remarks is always, "Just a joke."  SAD!
892577338147430402 2017-08-01 02:46:35 UTC <allanjruter> @SarahHuckabee @seanspicer @joanwalsh Yes, Joan.  Yes.  Dead eyes.  Sardonic delivery.  Seems to enjoy her role in ways a Press Secretary normally doesn't, and shouldn't.

"Our finest hours?"  Hardly.
892423730902839297 2017-08-01 16:36:12 UTC <allanjruter> @realDonaldTrump WRONG!  The BEST way for you to get the truth out is what your predecessors have done:  TELL THE TRUTH to the REAL MEDIA, a/k/a "Not Fox."
892069971295174656 2017-07-31 17:10:29 UTC <allanjruter> As most of you know, I am rarely speechless.  This time, however, with jaws dripping irony, my keyboard is in danger of shorting out.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/892066844953251841
892069750800601089 2017-07-31 17:09:37 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill The mind boggles.  That's it.  Nearly speechless.  Irony dripping, threatening to short-out my keyboard.  #trumpesquekafkaesque
892069245986775046 2017-07-31 17:07:36 UTC <allanjruter> @realDonaldTrump "Thanks, Obama." @BarackObama #trumpesquekafkaesque
891854851260461058 2017-07-30 02:55:41 UTC <allanjruter> @NateSilver538 Sad, but true.
891516846461124608 2017-07-29 04:32:34 UTC <allanjruter> @StevenTDennis So who's going to budge?  Murkowski? Collins? McCain?  How can you suppose that any one of these three who cast a difficult vote will flip?
891104605085597698 2017-07-28 01:14:28 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill We had a label for this kind of hypocrisy back in my 1970s college days, but to lay it down in print would make me guilty of #Scaramuccia.

862421067276726272 2017-05-10 21:36:20 UTC <allanjruter> Sad, but true:  And I'm an historian who would write (right?) the story otherwise if I could. https://twitter.com/poxseyrah/status/862355446576943106
862365574072061952 2017-05-10 17:55:49 UTC <allanjruter> Well, now:  There's something funny about these lists.  #whatfreshhelltodayhttps://twitter.com/SeanLLydon/status/862077101028950016
862131521754476545 2017-05-09 02:25:47 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill Actually, folks, it should read WHOM Trump can't fire."  Today's grammar tip from a veteran English teacher.  Rock on!
862131301259804672 2017-05-09 02:24:54 UTC <allanjruter> @danpfeiffer Spot-on, Dan.  Thanks.
862130772504965121 2017-05-09 02:22:48 UTC <allanjruter> Just more content late in a day with too much content already.  Nonetheless, worth reading.  #whatfreshhelltoday late-night editionhttps://twitter.com/thenation/status/862126307878080513
862015129587781633 2017-05-09 18:43:17 UTC <allanjruter> The very first tweet from DJT with which I agree.  And it may well be the last.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/861993986436866049
862014901195329538 2017-05-09 18:42:22 UTC <allanjruter> @realDonaldTrump As a veteran teacher, this is the first time I've agreed with a tweet from you, Mr. President.  And it may well be the last.
861809275336884224 2017-05-08 05:05:17 UTC <allanjruter> Wow and wow, folks.  Take time to read this one.  It makes sense to me!https://twitter.com/thenation/status/861792643516334080
861809097611542528 2017-05-08 05:04:35 UTC <allanjruter> @thenation Trenchant to the nth power.  Thanks, Nation.  I shall retweet.
861808309711622144 2017-05-08 05:01:27 UTC <allanjruter> Here it is, folks, a quantitative analysis of voting patterns that may help answer a vexing question for those of us on the losing end.https://twitter.com/thenation/status/861800454124130304
861807038237749248 2017-05-08 04:56:24 UTC <allanjruter> @NateSilver538 It's called "The Death of Expertise," Nate.  And I've just finished reading it.  You've probably read it already, but if not, do so.
861345662209798144 2017-05-07 22:23:03 UTC <allanjruter> @HillaryClinton Advice from a thrice-time voter:  Madame Secretary, when you use "the media" like that, you're sounding too much like you-know-who.  FAN!
861344960544636928 2017-05-07 22:20:16 UTC <allanjruter> @GretchenMcNeil Having just driven into your fair (?) city a week ago today, I'm getting the joke.  Sadly.
861308811994435585 2017-05-07 19:56:37 UTC <allanjruter> @brianklaas Let us seriously hope so, Brian.  And I wish I could write that en francaise.
861090171088928768 2017-05-06 05:27:49 UTC <allanjruter> @JoyAnnReid Agreed.  But Cecily Strong didn't appear in more than two skits, while The Eternally Banal Beck Bennett was  almost never off-screen. Weird.
860945444687536128 2017-05-06 19:52:44 UTC <allanjruter> How I wish I had written this.  #whatfreshhelltodayhttps://twitter.com/Jack_Slater/status/856603870780370944
859757944027701249 2017-05-03 13:14:02 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill Nothing like a morning rip from Kellyanne to help wash down my coffee.  She's such a dear.  #whatfreshhelltoday
859757435120222208 2017-05-03 13:12:00 UTC <allanjruter> #whatfreshhelltoday, 05/03/17:  Nothing like a morning rip from Kellyanne with my coffee.  She's such a dear thing.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/859740665730805760
859634375260024833 2017-05-02 05:03:00 UTC <allanjruter> And here's another #whatfreshhelltoday entry.  Something must be bad about nutritious school lunches.  [Breathing deeply, breathing deeply.]https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/859633792331509761
859629456524275712 2017-05-02 04:43:28 UTC <allanjruter> @realDonaldTrump Stop brooding over election results.  I'm a lifer Democrat and acknowledge your electoral win, despite HRC's popular vote victory.
859077611594686464 2017-05-01 16:10:38 UTC <allanjruter> Only 1360 (or so) days left.  Here's the latest installment of #whatfreshhelltoday.https://twitter.com/ezraklein/status/859058178276839424
859076717570396160 2017-05-01 16:07:04 UTC <allanjruter> @ezraklein This post has earned my latest #whatfreshhelltoday.  Thanks, Ezra--I think.
856359291711827968 2017-04-23 04:09:00 UTC <allanjruter> @NateSilver538 @ron_fournier @SteveKornacki Geez already, Nerd Boyz, give it up and stop arguing.  For nearly all of us, it doesn't matter anymore.
856358376820940800 2017-04-23 04:05:22 UTC <allanjruter> Let's just throw this into the #whatfreshhelltoday pile.  Can't believe these two are still duking it out over last November.https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/856324700393394176
856358105852071936 2017-04-23 04:04:17 UTC <allanjruter> @NateSilver538 Both of you stop it.  The stats don't matter anymore, and you need to move past it as millions of us have had to.  For pity's sake, stop.
855895428453326849 2017-04-22 21:25:46 UTC <allanjruter> This earns my new hashtag:  #whatfreshhelltoday Geez, already. https://twitter.com/MarcusC22973194/status/855866710708113409
855895022050390019 2017-04-22 21:24:09 UTC <allanjruter> @NHLBlackhawks @OCons23 Bowman's press conference was singularly honest and raw.  You don't hear that very often from a pro sports GM.
855635040897773569 2017-04-21 04:11:05 UTC <allanjruter> Repeat after me:  "Baby steps.  Baby steps."  But it's something, at least.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/855633790164709376

855485112296845314 2017-04-21 18:15:19 UTC <allanjruter> This one begs for my newly created hashtag:  #whatfreshhelltodayhttps://twitter.com/thehill/status/855460400208457729
855421521636077569 2017-04-21 14:02:38 UTC <allanjruter> @politico Keep telling yourself that, Ronna.  Over and over.  And maybe, just maybe, what you say will happen.  But I doubt it.
855267773148143617 2017-04-20 03:51:41 UTC <allanjruter> @NolanDMcCaskill @politico And don't let the Capitol's front door hit you on your backside as you leave, Congressman Chaffetz.
855267313410605056 2017-04-20 03:49:52 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill This post impels me to create a new hashtag:  #whatfreshhelltoday

Outrageous.
854431970247536640 2017-04-18 20:30:30 UTC <allanjruter> "CNN has become the ESPN of politics."  Wow.  So right.https://twitter.com/ezraklein/status/854060188046958592
854431646547927040 2017-04-18 20:29:13 UTC <allanjruter> @realDonaldTrump And on what fake-news basis do you make those claims, Mr. President?  SAD!
854431323141877762 2017-04-18 20:27:56 UTC <allanjruter> @NateSilver538 "Herding"?  Please explain--to all, since I'm fairly sure I'm not the only one who doesn't understand that term.  Thanks!
852529648093233152 2017-04-13 14:31:21 UTC <allanjruter> Just another gaffe for the files . . . or not.https://twitter.com/kenvogel/status/852154762904653825
852184570711732224 2017-04-12 15:40:09 UTC <allanjruter> @danpfeiffer Cue "Old Friends" from Simon & Garfunkle's "Bookends" album!
851986211161952256 2017-04-11 02:31:56 UTC <allanjruter> @jordansammy Too, too timely.  Some marketing director deserves a bonus!

851960271715389441 2017-04-11 00:48:52 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill I'm so loving RBG's gaffe for so many reasons, most of them justified.  You just can't script this s***!
851959958040174592 2017-04-11 00:47:37 UTC <allanjruter> @ezraklein WTH, indeed.  Should be a hashtag for those of us who desperately need to step away but remain wary of what we'll miss.  #WTH
851959671120375808 2017-04-11 00:46:28 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill Just an existential minute, here:  This piece somehow presumes that someone OTHER than Trump, Jr. wants him to run?  Kafka died too soon.
851959207150727168 2017-04-11 00:44:38 UTC <allanjruter> @CharlesMBlow Brutal, yet trenchant observation.  Spicer just doesn't seem to grow into his job.  #SpicerFacts

851881026666332162 2017-04-11 19:33:58 UTC <allanjruter> @globalzero Countless nominees for countless awards claim, "It's an honor just to be among this group."  But how many aim to save the world?https://twitter.com/allanjruter/status/851880201319567361

851628735312928768 2017-04-10 02:51:27 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill And the natural response is just, "Wow."

850104045054418945 2017-04-06 21:52:53 UTC <allanjruter> @chucktodd Reid in 2013 vs McConnell in 2017 = false equivalency. Then Repubs had used filibuster 100s of times to block Obama appointees.
849739473139228672 2017-04-05 21:44:12 UTC <allanjruter> @thehill Hmmm . . . .  Didn't Trump do the very same thing?

829442352347504640 2017-02-08 21:30:41 UTC <allanjruter> @tedcruz @politico Ted's always a charmer, especially when looking to regain post-election footing after so many Repubs excoriated him.
829409843660390400 2017-02-08 19:21:31 UTC <allanjruter> @chrislhayes We need you here in Chicagoland, Chris.  Use your thumb, if necessary.
