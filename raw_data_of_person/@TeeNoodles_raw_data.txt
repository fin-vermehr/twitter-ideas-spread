970405033635385344 2018-03-04 21:06:03 UTC <TeeNoodles> @IoanAnthony You do seem to be hard of thinking.  We all know which companies are currently trading. When will you accept that there is no way to know how those companies will do after Brexit? Because no one knows what post-Brexit trade will look like.
970404199052832768 2018-03-04 21:02:44 UTC <TeeNoodles> @IoanAnthony I was happy all.along, I'm still waiting for your answer though.
970389845687271424 2018-03-04 20:05:42 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Machiavelli2018 @IoanAnthony You seem to have trouble understanding.  Precisely, who/which companies are well placed to do better after Brexit?  It shouldn't be this difficult.
970361569501687808 2018-03-04 18:13:21 UTC <TeeNoodles> @stealthygeek @AudreyruthBlev2 @SoLongMeatbags To be fair, if God created everything he must have just sort of assumed everything was OK, because he created it.  Maybe if he thought he needed to let humanity know that he thought gender fluidity is wrong, he'd have gotten around to it by now.  But yet, nothing!
970343628072775680 2018-03-04 17:02:03 UTC <TeeNoodles> @IoanAnthony You're accusing me of changing the subject when I'm literally referring back to the first tweet each time. You list of inventors is not going to keep the country going post-Brexit and you've come up with one company who may survive.  Go on, prove your very first point. I'll wait.
970332870341484544 2018-03-04 16:19:18 UTC <TeeNoodles> @stealthygeek @AudreyruthBlev2 I wasn't making fun or jeering, I was questioning why you feel a made up God can speak for you rather than the evidence of your own eyes.  That people do not identify to a gender stereotype formed 2000 years ago.  You can actually *see* it but don't believe it.  Fascinating.
970331883031670785 2018-03-04 16:15:23 UTC <TeeNoodles> @stealthygeek @AudreyruthBlev2 @tigerquinn7 Perfect 
970331319988342785 2018-03-04 16:13:09 UTC <TeeNoodles> @stealthygeek @AudreyruthBlev2 So, you base your ridiculous world view on the word of a made up God of whom you have no proof.  And you feel that's reasonable?
970330350542114817 2018-03-04 16:09:18 UTC <TeeNoodles> @stealthygeek @AudreyruthBlev2 OK, fundamentally that is wrong on many levels.  But, more importantly, who decides there are only two genders?
970329068657889280 2018-03-04 16:04:12 UTC <TeeNoodles> @stealthygeek @AudreyruthBlev2 What about babies who are born with both..? Or neither?  Who gives them a gender?
970328835823718400 2018-03-04 16:03:16 UTC <TeeNoodles> @stealthygeek @AudreyruthBlev2 Who gets to choose?
970325793590185984 2018-03-04 15:51:11 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Nick_Pettigrew Agreed. Felt v v uncomfortable.
970325067862302721 2018-03-04 15:48:18 UTC <TeeNoodles> @602Erik Melania's illegal made me LOL.  Epic.
970310506790768640 2018-03-04 14:50:26 UTC <TeeNoodles> @IoanAnthony Excuse me.  I have never spoken to you with such disrespect, so don't do it to me.  I wasn't the one that made the original statement.  You did.  One company, arguable or not, isn't going to save the economy.  So what do you rely on to back up your original statement?
970297746786865152 2018-03-04 13:59:44 UTC <TeeNoodles> @lancewalton And I know there's breach of trust but don't think that fits here.
970297625244258305 2018-03-04 13:59:15 UTC <TeeNoodles> @lancewalton I'm convinced there must be some old statute on the books that would provide the basis for prosecution.   Some sort of archaic dereliction of duty whilst in position of trust.
970297004621430784 2018-03-04 13:56:47 UTC <TeeNoodles> @IoanAnthony OK, so your weird distractions aside, your original point remains unproven.  You have provided one (arguable) company. I'm not here to converse with you.  I'm asking you for factual evidence for your original statement. You don't appear to be able to provide it.
970293658435104773 2018-03-04 13:43:30 UTC <TeeNoodles> @IoanAnthony Oo caps lock now. So, using BAE as an example, who have already laid staff off, and who rely heavily on trade agreements with two of its largest trading partners, such agreements that are now somewhat less than certain, where is this mystical windfall coming from?
970292321672720384 2018-03-04 13:38:11 UTC <TeeNoodles> @IoanAnthony I wasn't debating.  I was asking you to show me evidence for your original tweet, that we can make our way post-Brexit.  Just because you can't back up your statement doesn't make this a debate.  I'm just pointing out the bits of your argument that are wrong.

970288606073024513 2018-03-04 13:23:25 UTC <TeeNoodles> @IoanAnthony You didn't investigate BAE very well at all did you?  Got any more?
970287965187596288 2018-03-04 13:20:52 UTC <TeeNoodles> @IoanAnthony One company?  BAE who rely heavily on supply to both the EU and USA, one of whom we will no longer have a trade agreement with and one of whom is just kicking off a Trade war.  Try again.
970286808583081984 2018-03-04 13:16:16 UTC <TeeNoodles> @IoanAnthony I asked, specifically, for the leaders in aerospace which you are touting for big things to come?  It was quite a straightforward question.
970277548860084224 2018-03-04 12:39:29 UTC <TeeNoodles> @IoanAnthony OK, you said you see us getting back to the top in aerospace and I just asked for specifics. What British aerospace companies in particular are best placed to take advantage of post-Brexit trade?
970257450883481603 2018-03-04 11:19:37 UTC <TeeNoodles> @IoanAnthony Fair point, so where are the UK leaders in aerospace? Which ones are you touting for big things to come?
970246193816227842 2018-03-04 10:34:53 UTC <TeeNoodles> @IoanAnthony Slight point to be made, these are all past innovators/minds.  The UK isn't going to retake a world leading position based on old TVs and the electric motor.  What do you think are the manufacturing/services/inventions that will take us into prosperity post-Brexit?

958294539424460802 2018-01-30 11:03:17 UTC <TeeNoodles> @faisalislam @ds37alwaysred @pvandck He said when you have nothing you have nothing to lose (sp).  There is no doubt that some of the Brexit voters are those who have been cut off by this Tory party and Brexit was a (misinformed) vote for change.  People who are prepared to say that should be heard, not maligned.
958294115166367745 2018-01-30 11:01:35 UTC <TeeNoodles> @faisalislam @ds37alwaysred @pvandck Brexit spoke of a lot of different things to different people.  But from the comment he made you assumed a lot about him and that was unfair.

He quite clearly said he has nothing to lose, you then went on to presume he has a home and a job.  He may already be one of those in unrelenting poverty which this Government so despise and to whom Brexit spoke of a return of power.

952997923809320966 2018-01-15 20:16:25 UTC <TeeNoodles> @brexit_politics You state one of the factors as the weak pound, one as EU workers staying away, one the EU "recovering" as opposed to the  tanking, Germany paying more because they're not gutting their own economy.  Which of those factors is unrelated to Brexit?  Of course they all are.
952968254989000704 2018-01-15 18:18:31 UTC <TeeNoodles> @brexit_politics And I guess you'll next say that the strength (or otherwise) of the  is unrelated to Brexit?

947196179053535232 2017-12-30 20:02:21 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Rachel5742 Totally, there's either economic suicide/pay and obey or remain. The only possible answer is to #StopBrexit but in order to do so enough politicians have to find the will to cross party divides.  Neither of our current lot seem willing or able to do so.
947193258387570693 2017-12-30 19:50:45 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Cannabis__News @______1980 @brexit_politics @RemainingKind So, if you live in a deprived area in the UK, and can't get a job, why would you automatically assume that FOM will benefit you - how does someone out of work and disenfranchised actually move country to benefit? It's not as straightforward as just being entitled to.
947192864378933249 2017-12-30 19:49:11 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Cannabis__News @______1980 @brexit_politics @RemainingKind I didn't write the article.  I'm merely pointing out that the issue you raised isn't the foremost with some.  I know plenty of people who wouldn't have the money to just up and move house. A disproportionately high number of leave voters don't even have a passport.
947192389638197249 2017-12-30 19:47:18 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Rachel5742 Also, before any super majority is required the EU will insist on Schengen and the .  If leavers are shouting loudly now, imagine if the scenario is to go back in but lose the .  It'll never happen.

947190506408370176 2017-12-30 19:39:49 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Cannabis__News @______1980 @brexit_politics @RemainingKind I read an article recently that said that the vast majority of people who voted remain haven't the economical freedom to travel or just up and move.  FoM is therefore one of the least important issues to leavers because it's simply irrelevant on a personal basis.
947189383228280832 2017-12-30 19:35:21 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Cannabis__News @RemainingKind @______1980 @brexit_politics I disagree with you. I think we're committing economical and political harm to the country by leaving which will damage the country for years to come.
947188475773767681 2017-12-30 19:31:45 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Cannabis__News @______1980 @RemainingKind @brexit_politics I expect Brexit to be stopped on the basis that it is absolutely the wrong thing for the UK and I dislike the hate and division created by the leave vote, ably assisted by May's disregard for everyone who voted remain or who didn't or couldn't vote.

You asked the question if anyone thought the figure quoted was real. My point was that people believed the 350 million would go to the NHS and people voted in reliance.

In the meantime I have joined LDs and am happy with that. It's fair to say that parties may align differently when it comes to it.

For now the Lib Dems are the only party totally opposed to Brexit. Should that change by the next election then my vote may change. There's no good picking lumps out of each other when we have a common interest.

But it would hurt me to pay membership to the Tories, and also she only seems to listen to hardliners - I don't believe Tories will back off.  Labour I'd 100% supportif they simply backed a second ref.  They don't so LD it is.

931592064709652480 2017-11-17 18:37:11 UTC <TeeNoodles> @SRuhle Suspect they're time barred by statute.  Which makes them speaking up more brave - because they're speaking out for you, not themselves. And yet people deride them daily, to compound the original assault.
931585093709238272 2017-11-17 18:09:29 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Telegraph @Friedrich1785 @_Inteligent But it's our choice to leave.  We're ditching our obligations.  That's not the person I want to be.

931464396513120258 2017-11-17 10:09:52 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Telegraph @Friedrich1785 @_Inteligent It's not taking, it's failing to pay.  If you commit to buying a house with your neighbour, you don't get to pull out and leave them to pay.  There are infrastructure and project payments that we have agreed to pay, so an exit payment is our contractual obligation.

931449071029641216 2017-11-17 09:08:58 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Telegraph @Friedrich1785 @_Inteligent The UK won't get an exit without a payment. We have economic responsibilities which we signed up to and which don't just go away because we decided to leave.

Clearly the most dangerous kind of religious follower of all.
930721040698937344 2017-11-15 08:56:02 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Tesco @DanielJHannan @efrogwraig @RuralConserv You're the only person I've ever engaged with who has applied the harshest possible variation of the Qur'an.  So, again, your point is void. I'm not religious, I don't give a damn, but pissed off with Islam taking a battering when all religions are dangerous if so interpreted.
930713504776118272 2017-11-15 08:26:06 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Tesco @DanielJHannan @efrogwraig @RuralConserv I wasn't being patronising, I was responding to the points you made and stating my opinion. You used ill-translated passages of the Qur'an, out of context, to make your point.  Which is wrong and contributes to anti-Islam feeling being spread unnecessarily.
930700218823331840 2017-11-14 07:33:18 UTC <TeeNoodles> @J_amesp You've got to laugh at the deliberate lack of recollection.  "Remain bombardment".  Jokers.

930681142264688641 2017-11-14 06:17:30 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Tesco @DanielJHannan @efrogwraig @RuralConserv I don't claim to be an expert, but the Qur'an. Awliya in 5.51 is incorrectly translated as friends, and is actually counselling not to take Jews and Christians as 'protectors'. Same with 3.28.
930679005812084736 2017-11-14 06:09:00 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Tesco @DanielJHannan @efrogwraig This is a very good try at seeming to know what you're talking about, @RuralConserv - but a rather significant and, I'm guessing, deliberate attempt to use isolated sections to make your point.

But the story currently alleged is that the guys were being abused specifically because they are gay.  Therefore in this context their sexuality is very relevant.

But the fact is companies/states on both sides have to adjust to the new infrastructure, imports, exports, flights, anything in fact coming in or out will be subject to a barrier which just wasn't there before, damage all round.  #StopBrexit
912969264763686912 2017-09-27 09:16:49 UTC <TeeNoodles> @kaffando That's a discrepancy in the respective parties' positions of strength, and negotiation strategy.  Just because we're expecting them to gift us an easy exit, doesn't mean they don't suffer harm too.  I'm more surprised people think there's no harm to them.
912961873338933248 2017-09-27 08:47:27 UTC <TeeNoodles> @kaffando In the short term, each party is clearly damaged, otherwise they'd be holding the door open to pave a smoother transition.  No delusion here - in total agreement that Brexit should be stopped.

908642331129253888 2017-09-15 10:43:08 UTC <TeeNoodles> Somewhat concerning that the BBC have suspended programmes for a relatively minor incident. Exactly what the "terrorists" want.

860222335730765825 2017-05-04 19:59:21 UTC <TeeNoodles> @LeysKarl It's vile isn't it.
859635089122234374 2017-05-02 05:05:51 UTC <TeeNoodles> @igorvolsky And yet affordable healthcare is too burdensome? @realDonaldTrump content to use the Treasury as his personal bank account.  #fraudster
859488005417050112 2017-05-02 19:21:23 UTC <TeeNoodles> @timminchin Maybe go with Ralph or Wilbur even if it is a girl.  Your kid's going to hate you anyway, may as well make it worthwhile x
859139762468401153 2017-05-01 20:17:36 UTC <TeeNoodles> @PC1010Gardner Hooray!
858003452823314432 2017-04-28 17:02:18 UTC <TeeNoodles> So bloody excited to see more. Amazing.https://twitter.com/BadAstronomer/status/857971946839060480
857971111769899008 2017-04-28 14:53:48 UTC <TeeNoodles> @PrideBrighton I have two rooms booked but unable to go due to change of circumstances - anyone looking for a place to stay?
855866572262580226 2017-04-22 19:31:06 UTC <TeeNoodles> @jooliargh This made me lol.  What song?
855353394466258944 2017-04-21 09:31:55 UTC <TeeNoodles> @jooliargh You can do us all one :)
854421242262290433 2017-04-18 19:47:53 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Madeley @scifisam2010 It isn't impossible.  Article 50 can be revoked.  It needs agreement of all EU members.  Still easier than trade/exit deals in two years.
854074691128107008 2017-04-17 20:50:48 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Lord_Sugar And also, not an obsequious toad, a la Piers Morgan.  Winning.
854052012882788356 2017-04-17 19:20:42 UTC <TeeNoodles> @SteH90 Sadly it would likely spawn two more of her, each worse than the last...
849510922586660864 2017-04-04 06:36:01 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Cernovich @domjoly Taking on the mannerisms of his primary role model perhaps?
849145807559417856 2017-04-03 06:25:11 UTC <TeeNoodles> @davidschneider As long as we have navy blue passports, who cares? #priorities #brexitshambles
847546303424942086 2017-03-30 20:29:20 UTC <TeeNoodles> @nytimes @evilcycling @DMFish20 Which bit of him just grabbing women by the pushy whether they want it or not, is not a sexual assault?
847149262437789696 2017-03-29 18:11:38 UTC <TeeNoodles> @marcusbrig I'm wondering if there's another video... May in a hotel room, with Boris in a gimp mask.
846999874247823360 2017-03-29 08:18:01 UTC <TeeNoodles> Childbirth: extremely painful, left with consequences for many years and potential for unexpectedly catastrophic outcome. See also: #brexit
846765888045006852 2017-03-28 16:48:14 UTC <TeeNoodles> @AsdaServiceTeam Yes, that was first option.  Fobbed off with outright  claptrap.
846750534602309632 2017-03-28 15:47:13 UTC <TeeNoodles> @asda Appalling customer service for last two orders. Shopping not delivered or payment taken twice.  Will never use again.  Ridiculous.
845409580750458880 2017-03-24 22:58:45 UTC <TeeNoodles> @jupitusphillip @jooliargh Made me notice too.  Ace.
845409316077273088 2017-03-24 22:57:42 UTC <TeeNoodles> @TheLastLeg Surely this should be getting widdy with it?
845408003704664064 2017-03-24 22:52:29 UTC <TeeNoodles> @BBCHamedani Is it bigly bad? Lame duck bad? Get used to it Trumpton bad?

845262456771559424 2017-03-24 13:14:08 UTC <TeeNoodles> @hendopolis I do wonder what bit of "drive car", "into"  "people" and "hurt" "them" required a Google search.
845260543783002112 2017-03-24 13:06:32 UTC <TeeNoodles> @thehistoryguy @emmy720 @FancyNancyTN I'd like to see her in a cone of shame.  But with smaller ones for her hands also so not only could she not speak, but couldn't type either.
845260246025211904 2017-03-24 13:05:21 UTC <TeeNoodles> @thehistoryguy Looks demoralised to me.  People literally on their knees and full of woe.
843864035342848001 2017-03-20 16:37:18 UTC <TeeNoodles> I notice the Prime Minister ignored the memo.  #InternationalDayOfHappiness #brexit #Article50 #whatthefuckareyoudoing

841708300546764804 2017-03-14 17:51:11 UTC <TeeNoodles> The Murray mint situation can now only be described as dire.  Unless you're the Foreign Secretary then everything's fine.  #brexit #nomints
841561500963786752 2017-03-14 08:07:51 UTC <TeeNoodles> Anyone surprised that May et al may decline a second referendum? May as well fuck everyone in one fell swoop. #theycallthisdemocracy #brexit
838843441782145024 2017-03-06 20:07:16 UTC <TeeNoodles> I suppose we should expect nothing less, but this is appalling beyond words.https://twitter.com/journorosa/status/838815925235232769
838155926800642050 2017-03-04 22:35:19 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Herring1967 @GovHowardDean But most importantly that Barack himself didn't shimmy up the walls of Trumpton's Tower.  Not a euphemism.
834890143307808769 2017-02-23 22:18:16 UTC <TeeNoodles> Can't say I hope LCFC go down, but genuinely aghast that the man who delivered a miracle in May can now be discarded. #bollocks.

832318713068130305 2017-02-16 20:00:19 UTC <TeeNoodles> @domjoly @TangerineChrome Give him a chance to what?
832317311746973699 2017-02-16 19:54:45 UTC <TeeNoodles> @Lord_Sugar Sadly not the performance of a top three team. Very worried about squad depth and desire to win.
831638771514929152 2017-02-14 22:58:28 UTC <TeeNoodles> @chris_coltrane saw somewhere that people should turn up, but stand with their backs to the procession.  I like the idea. #resist #persist
831622798250541057 2017-02-14 21:55:00 UTC <TeeNoodles> @jooliargh I am going to do it.   But I want them all to have Wumpy in their names... yes, all 1000.
831622336537296902 2017-02-14 21:53:10 UTC <TeeNoodles> @IanWright0 wouldn't you?

830139331759190016 2017-02-10 19:40:14 UTC <TeeNoodles> @AaronBastani Surely not being able to discern that this is immigrants using Spanish resources is a little stupid?
830122806738296832 2017-02-10 18:34:34 UTC <TeeNoodles> @domjoly Well it's very easy to fuck up large when engaging in diplomacy with the Japanese. DIdn't stop him with China so I guess bigly.
