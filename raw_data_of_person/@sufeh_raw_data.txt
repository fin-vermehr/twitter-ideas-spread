748253010040479744 2016-06-29 20:33:14 UTC <sufeh> @ounodesign To be clear, we are talking about concert dance, which occupies a tiny sliver of humanity's history & relationship to dancing
748249105042833408 2016-06-29 20:17:43 UTC <sufeh> @Lidsville Yet most contemporary dance artists will insist that they have nothing to do with ballet #denial
748248853065785344 2016-06-29 20:16:43 UTC <sufeh> @Lidsville Critiquing something using the tropes you are critiquing = no critique at all. Tho I'm not even sure it was aspiring to that.
748247582250409984 2016-06-29 20:11:40 UTC <sufeh> @ounodesign I assume it is selling to all the big men and floppy women wannabes

748246489290334209 2016-06-29 20:07:19 UTC <sufeh> @ounodesign 3/ So to answer your question, it is to sell. Period.
748246305437147136 2016-06-29 20:06:35 UTC <sufeh> @ounodesign 2/ But 99% of the time, it is just holding up the status quo patriarchy
748246168367312896 2016-06-29 20:06:02 UTC <sufeh> @ounodesign 1/ Dance has the potential to shake us up, which is why it is often the 1st thing to be banned by forces who want to control us.
