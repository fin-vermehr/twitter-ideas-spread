923282443959984128 2017-10-25 20:17:43 UTC <wjsgunn> @BBCSpringwatch #bbcautumnwatch will the arrival of bee eaters adversely affect our declining bee population?
909507878754676736 2017-09-17 20:02:30 UTC <wjsgunn> @pirellisport @C4F1 @Sneaky_Pedro #recycling!
909505773230845952 2017-09-17 19:54:08 UTC <wjsgunn> @C4F1 what happens to all the used tyres from F1 weekends?
897871666633691139 2017-08-16 17:24:21 UTC <wjsgunn> @realDonaldTrump in WW2 both sides used violence. One side were fascists; the others were American allies. Sorry it's complicated.
857118811459375104 2017-04-25 06:27:03 UTC <wjsgunn> @timfarron @LibDems what's happening in West? Most important election in years & PPCs falling like flies!!
835654888910688256 2017-02-25 00:57:05 UTC <wjsgunn> @BBCRadio2 farewell Brian Matthew, but leave the programme at 0800! And we don't need a "pause for thought"!!!
833017501478957056 2017-02-18 18:17:03 UTC <wjsgunn> @BBC_HaveYourSay is it necessary to perpetuate nonsense like weatherbomb & bombagenesis? Meaningless & trivialising.
820198255908818944 2017-01-14 09:17:57 UTC <wjsgunn> @Daisy4Yeovil @yarlingtonhg I agree more is needed but quality of current stock needs improvement too
813386152510103552 2016-12-26 14:09:05 UTC <wjsgunn> Just an idea: tribute album- "NOW That's What I Call Dead". Too soon?
806239112957149185 2016-12-06 20:49:18 UTC <wjsgunn> @timfarron @LibDemPress As an ex-Royal Navy officer, I couldn't agree more. Moral & military nonsense!
804641550408044544 2016-12-02 11:01:09 UTC <wjsgunn> @notjustagranny @WWTSwanFlight The weekend looks good with a brisk SE tail-wind. Good luck & happy landings!
800067771526770688 2016-11-19 20:06:35 UTC <wjsgunn> @mcewansbeers showing my age - I remember the jingle!
800056947059884032 2016-11-19 19:23:35 UTC <wjsgunn> @mcewansbeers McEwans is the Best Buy!
790637688948985856 2016-10-24 19:34:49 UTC <wjsgunn> @metoffice by Military you mean Army, since the RN had forecasts from you since the 19th cent? RN forecasters have been at sea since 1912!
784688666513932288 2016-10-08 09:35:31 UTC <wjsgunn> @Daisy4Yeovil @YeovilLibDems Petition signed. Good luck!
784500053037703168 2016-10-07 21:06:02 UTC <wjsgunn> Yeovil gets the sad reward for believing @LiamFoxMP @MarcusFysh et al. So angry/sad about GKN. @YeovilLibDems return?
782333378905464833 2016-10-01 21:36:27 UTC <wjsgunn> #ilminstercarnival Huge delays again. Is there a plan for stuck floats? 
774343195450802176 2016-09-09 20:26:19 UTC <wjsgunn> @simplehuman not if it fails as quickly as the soap dispenser!
774316342614773760 2016-09-09 18:39:36 UTC <wjsgunn> @TheLastLeg #isitok for a tandem cyclist to choose a champion pilot? Why isn't Wiggo up front?!
771988464195829760 2016-09-03 08:29:27 UTC <wjsgunn> @Robinnolan Laxey!
761644170805207041 2016-08-05 19:24:55 UTC <wjsgunn> @Parrot is there any reason why you've gone quiet on the ongoing problem with my Zik 2 headphones? I have a case number if you want it.
760230928073498625 2016-08-01 21:49:12 UTC <wjsgunn> @WWTSwanFlight my answers have to be "the weather" and "the weather"!!
759851019752779776 2016-07-31 20:39:35 UTC <wjsgunn> Lousy coverage of final stages of #RideLondon by @BBCSport. Another one @Channel4 or @SkySports will steal from under you
757265997829136384 2016-07-24 17:27:37 UTC <wjsgunn> @LewisHamilton @MercedesAMGF1 You're ahead - That's strong enough!
757264412944261120 2016-07-24 17:21:19 UTC <wjsgunn> @C4F1 I am sure @fia is doing everything to spoil @F1. Money, trying dodgy qualy rules, now radio nonsense. #letthemrace
756497652825686020 2016-07-22 14:34:30 UTC <wjsgunn> OK, May and Hammond have been in office for over a week now. Isn't it time to give Clarkson the Transport portfolio? 
750084875613564928 2016-07-04 21:52:24 UTC <wjsgunn> @gove2016 2 deceitful campaigners gone; 1 to go. Now, please @Gove2016. #ratssinkingship
749705084846604288 2016-07-03 20:43:15 UTC <wjsgunn> @C4F1 @nico_rosberg :stewards this week, @SilverstoneUK Crowd next week. Tough week. Just saying.
749699939475791872 2016-07-03 20:22:48 UTC <wjsgunn> @MercedesAMGF1 how can a "brake by wire problem" stop the steering wheel turning right? #noteamorders
749687917216432128 2016-07-03 19:35:02 UTC <wjsgunn> @LewisHamilton fantastic race!@MercedesAMGF1 don't you dare bring in team orders - just read the stewards' report!
746444185570508802 2016-06-24 20:45:36 UTC <wjsgunn> @Stuart_Homer my vocabulary supported by sound knowledge of French & Italian too. Anglo-Saxon handy for that cunt Farage!
746440382024650752 2016-06-24 20:30:29 UTC <wjsgunn> @seanonolennon @Stuart_Homer only when "the majority" act on the lies of a mendacious & inaccurate campaign.
745371592776093697 2016-06-21 21:43:30 UTC <wjsgunn> Hippy says, "Do you know what I went through to get this? You are not having it back!" #CatsAgainstBrexitpic.twitter.com/kptxMHg18i
744140712682328064 2016-06-18 12:12:26 UTC <wjsgunn> @C4F1 Baku looks great but are there any @F1  fans there?!
742824108287758336 2016-06-14 21:00:43 UTC <wjsgunn> @Stuart_Homer . Will try: probably be teaching on the Monday so it may be a flying visit.
742822426409586688 2016-06-14 20:54:02 UTC <wjsgunn> @Stuart_Homer not proportionally on what he makes, I'll bet! You still in LDN 31 Jul?
742799531868364800 2016-06-14 19:23:03 UTC <wjsgunn> @Stuart_Homer. This from a man who loves Britain so much he couldn't be arsed to pay our tax.
739111330351812608 2016-06-04 15:07:27 UTC <wjsgunn> @VodafoneUKhelp - thanks but no help. Those don't answer my question or get me 4G!
739036827110244352 2016-06-04 10:11:24 UTC <wjsgunn> Utterly disdainful customer service from @simplehuman. Just throw away a 70 item after 2 yrs when it breaks? #lostcustomer
739036438721859584 2016-06-04 10:09:52 UTC <wjsgunn> @TheRealBuzz @Buzzs_xtina thanks for a great night!
738851528476381184 2016-06-03 21:55:06 UTC <wjsgunn> Great, entertaining night with @TheRealBuzz Aldrin. Hope I have your energy at 86, Sir!
733014619053281284 2016-05-18 19:21:18 UTC <wjsgunn> @VodafoneUK why can't I get a 4G service in central London on my iPhone 6? It appears to be set up ok. Confused!pic.twitter.com/3TGx9BWbJZ
732922902601945088 2016-05-18 13:16:51 UTC <wjsgunn> @Stuart_Homer when is this? Chance to get together?
731581578661466112 2016-05-14 20:26:55 UTC <wjsgunn> @LeeMcKenzieTV I guess a clothes shopping trip in Barcelona wouldn't have been any fun! 
730138244176842752 2016-05-10 20:51:37 UTC <wjsgunn> @TheRealBuzz Tickets booked & looking forward to hearing/meeting Dr Rendezvous! @ToppingsBath
728631109030924288 2016-05-06 17:02:48 UTC <wjsgunn> @LewisHamilton @MercedesAMGF1 Well said. Proof (if needed) that motorsport is a TEAM sport.
727966498594148353 2016-05-04 21:01:52 UTC <wjsgunn> @EmptySeas good luck, whatever it's for!
725234893869998081 2016-04-27 08:07:27 UTC <wjsgunn> @GregoryPorter hope you can fit in something similar for tomorrow night's set.
725054955569184768 2016-04-26 20:12:26 UTC <wjsgunn> Tickets for @GregoryPorter extra night at the Apollo? That'll do nicely!
724687598418010112 2016-04-25 19:52:42 UTC <wjsgunn> @EmptySeas @Emergedrinks #getgrateful
724310404034355200 2016-04-24 18:53:52 UTC <wjsgunn> @Robinnolan that's seen a few "Wild Rovers"!
724161296065781760 2016-04-24 09:01:21 UTC <wjsgunn> @MarcusFysh NFU disagree; Westlands disagree. They have a deep interest in this community so there's something in it. I'll seek better info.
724153761996898304 2016-04-24 08:31:25 UTC <wjsgunn> @MarcusFysh both sides are making plenty of statements without clear supporting data. "Total arse" hardly helps.
724147206660493313 2016-04-24 08:05:22 UTC <wjsgunn> @MarcusFysh what erudite analysis. Exactly the type of comment that makes me think don't understand or listen to other views.
722870176228638720 2016-04-20 19:30:54 UTC <wjsgunn> Looking forward to a visit from @timfarron in #Yeovil constituency to start re-claiming for @YeovilLibDems
722869399267356677 2016-04-20 19:27:49 UTC <wjsgunn> And yet the Member @MarcusFysh thinks that he's representing Yeovil by advocating #LeaveEU!! Go @YeovilLibDemshttps://twitter.com/YeovilLibDems/status/720912711408828416
721754354789806081 2016-04-17 17:37:02 UTC <wjsgunn> @BurgerKing Paddington: the only BK in the UK that can't provide a beef burger. Unbelievable.
720574400853065729 2016-04-14 11:28:19 UTC <wjsgunn> @LeeMcKenzieTV @AintreeRaces you can't buy class.
716343634132606981 2016-04-02 19:16:46 UTC <wjsgunn> @LeeMcKenzieTV @C4F1 great coverage again. But @F1 desperately needs to lose Ecclestone & sort dismal qualifying.
712526436360445956 2016-03-22 06:28:35 UTC <wjsgunn> @therealdcf1 Congratulations! Keep up the insightful work with @C4F1
712394900021633026 2016-03-22 21:45:54 UTC <wjsgunn> Sorry @suziperry  @C4F1 missed a trick. We still love our biker girl! X
712391370862886912 2016-03-22 21:31:53 UTC <wjsgunn> True, @suziperry but hardly a commitment to the sport. Good luck on @BBCRadio2 !
712388034315075584 2016-03-22 21:18:37 UTC <wjsgunn> Looking forward to it @suziperry Just don't get why @BBC is pretending to still be interested in F1!
712167867110825984 2016-03-21 06:43:45 UTC <wjsgunn> Chancellor ineffectual: Tories in turmoil. Labour: impotent. Why, then, the invisible media profile of @LibDems & @timfarron ?
711596241491197952 2016-03-20 16:52:19 UTC <wjsgunn> Qually was awful, but that's been fixed. Looks like @C4F1 has @bbcf1 whipped & that will be harder to change!
711592400091815936 2016-03-20 16:37:03 UTC <wjsgunn> Why the podium boos, @LewisHamilton ?? Great solid race- keep it up!
