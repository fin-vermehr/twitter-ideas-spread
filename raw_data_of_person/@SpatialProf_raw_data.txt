958239236888637440 2018-01-29 07:23:31 UTC <SpatialProf> It is also interesting to look at this in relation to the #Guardian's article regarding percieved impact of #Brexit on personal finances. For the majority of people, given the imbalance of wealth in the nation, they could well end up losing MORE than 2-8% of their money
958238025640706048 2018-01-29 07:18:43 UTC <SpatialProf> In modelling one should pay attention to the range of scenarios and outcomes. Some MPs correctly point out the scenario of a [preferred] bespoke deal wasn't included. Such a bespoke deal is the least likely to occur as the EU "holds all the cards".
958237108203900928 2018-01-29 07:15:04 UTC <SpatialProf> If the government doesn't like such work they have wasted time, money and should write a clearer brief and requirements document in the first place
958236510389768192 2018-01-29 07:12:41 UTC <SpatialProf> The Government's reply (also remember they commissioned the work!) is the modelling is incomplete, is based on assumptions and is therefore flawed... just like ANY modelling in ANY context!

824570958153392128 2017-01-26 10:53:30 UTC <SpatialProf> @EnvAgencyGeomat A simple post of flown track and perhaps as-planned coverage (to save time and faff) after each flight would do the trick
824570351220883457 2017-01-26 10:51:06 UTC <SpatialProf> @EnvAgencyGeomat The added value comes from conducting fieldwork ASAP after acquisition. Waiting for next composite is too late.
