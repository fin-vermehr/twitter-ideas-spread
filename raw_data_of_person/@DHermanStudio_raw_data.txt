With a main message for people to get out of the way? That's showing drivers how to kill peds/cyclists, rather than drive safely #irresponsible #visionzero

962304739307409408 2018-02-10 12:38:23 UTC <DHermanStudio> @CharlesMBlow The founding fathers' fear of a president like Trump is what drove their fear of the masses, resulting in the undemocratic Electoral College  which put DJT into office.

Or is he OK with 13-year-olds being killed on NYC streets but not with seniors on the Upper West Side being afraid of "deadly" e-bikes?
961690385998368768 2018-02-08 19:57:10 UTC <DHermanStudio> Honestly, @NYCMayor really has to stop saying stuff like e-bikes are deadly hazards, congestion pricing is a regressive tax, it's ok to drive 12 miles to the gym, and fare beaters should be prosecuted to the fullest extent  he's forcing me to like @NYGovCuomohttps://twitter.com/danrivoli/status/961359771206082560

961678994042220546 2018-02-08 19:11:53 UTC <DHermanStudio> @TransitCenter @BilldeBlasio @NYCMayor @dahvnyc Question on #busturnaround: Does bus bunching grade take lines that share routes for large sections into account? E.g. B67/69 share #parkslope route, often bunched together in either direction. Is that info included in grade?
961677957357064192 2018-02-08 19:07:46 UTC <DHermanStudio> @dahvnyc Buses in/around #parkslope get 4 Ds (B69, 67, 61, and 37) and 2 Fs (B63 and 41).

952616736959946752 2018-01-14 19:01:43 UTC <DHermanStudio> Wouldn't it make more sense to divest from and sue automobile makers for creating the demand that's propelling #climatechange rather than oil companies for "merely" supplying it? @NYCMayorhttps://twitter.com/mikelydon/status/952606236918378496
952615004729114625 2018-01-14 18:54:50 UTC <DHermanStudio> Wouldn't it make more sense to sue car companies for generating that demand by making the supposed freedom of cars sexy, building oversized SUVs, lobbying against fuel efficiency limits etc.?
952614179436933126 2018-01-14 18:51:33 UTC <DHermanStudio> I'm still not sure what the point of these lawsuits beyond "How dare you supply our demand!" Instead, our elected leaders must work to cut down on that demand, e.g. better transit, safer bike infrastruture, and stop taking 3 SUVs to drive 12 miles to your gymhttps://twitter.com/billmckibben/status/951974288416018432

So you're relying on a piece of plastic and drivers following suggestions to save cyclists' lives rather than better street design/laws. That's not safer at all

948257428583473159 2018-01-02 18:19:23 UTC <DHermanStudio> @2AvSagas I'm not as concerned w accuracy  I always figure clocks are off +/- 3mins  as I am w clock placement. One per platform mean they're unusable to most passengers, esp bc they're often blocked by signs, stairs. Another example of cheapskate-to-NYC @NYGovCuomo shortchanging subways

947474080583872512 2017-12-31 14:26:38 UTC <DHermanStudio> @nypost @stevecuozzo The minority of people in NYC who drive  most of whom are wealthier than the average New Yorker  hold more sway over city policy than the vast majority who use transit
947470530155859969 2017-12-31 14:12:32 UTC <DHermanStudio> To all media: stop calling Trump a New Yorker. It's clear from every action he's taken that he doesn't care about our city and actively works against everything that makes our city great. He simply doesn't deserve the honor of "New Yorker"
947470527999946752 2017-12-31 14:12:31 UTC <DHermanStudio> So Trump's grand infrastructure plan is to not fund infrastructure where it's needed most?http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20171229/POLITICS/171229921

947189347551465472 2017-12-30 19:35:13 UTC <DHermanStudio> Hey @feedly: why are there suddenly articles in my app from feeds I don't subscribe to or care about at all (e.g., weekend events in a Mass. town)? It's annoying  let me choose what I want to see, not some algorithm #feedly
947150794519957505 2017-12-30 17:02:01 UTC <DHermanStudio> @MoveNewYork @WinnHu @AlexWithAK Agreed. Also didn't like reporter let someone state unchallenged that #bikenyc lanes add to congestion (false) or that they're lightly used (used less, but not lightly until it's bitterly cold). Why perpetuate stereotypes/inaccuracies?
947139808236851200 2017-12-30 16:18:21 UTC <DHermanStudio> Driving into Manhattan from Queens/Brooklyn, even from transit deserts, is a choice made by car owners, not a requirement. They can also drive to transit, thus not adding to traffic and avoiding any future tolls
947139804935966721 2017-12-30 16:18:21 UTC <DHermanStudio> So I guess @WinnHu couldn't find any of NYC's millions of transit users or 1000s of commercial drivers to interview  people who'd actually benefit from @MoveNewYork plan  and instead just spoke with the minority of drivers in our cityhttps://twitter.com/nytmetro/status/947121608770183168

947117299869323264 2017-12-30 14:48:55 UTC <DHermanStudio> One thing that is unique about NYC transit: how little NYS and state-controlled "independent" MTA cares abt improving its largest city and main economic engine.

944723882979848193 2017-12-23 00:18:20 UTC <DHermanStudio> Can someone at @NYCTBus explain why you allow shift changes in middle of the route rather than at end?

943330306060423168 2017-12-19 04:00:45 UTC <DHermanStudio> @Rit_Aggarwala @BrianLehrer First ask why NYC subways cost so much to build, e.g., London's Crossrail (60mi, 10 new stations, 30 upgraded, for $15B) vs 2nd Ave Subway Phase II (1.5mi, 3 new stations, for $6B). NYC's paying 16x per mile to build than London: that's just wrong @2AvSagas

I wish it was possible, but maybe you and Dem colleagues now need to be just as rigid as GOP to do what's right for us.https://twitter.com/senschumer/status/936786346785439744

Wrongheaded e-bike policy at least based on anecdotal observation, which is of course not accurate. What in the world is he using to call @MoveNewYork a regressive tax?
936652426752471042 2017-12-01 17:45:15 UTC <DHermanStudio> @BrianLehrer @dahvnyc Only way @BilldeBlasio wld be correct is if majority of mid class/poor owned cars and skipped mass transit, and majority of outer borough residents drove into Mnhtn. Since reality is exact opposite, which "facts" are being used by @NYCMayor to make this judgement?

690194159488098305 2016-01-21 15:28:05 UTC <DHermanStudio> If this goes thru, perhaps we need to do "take the lane" event, show what cn happen on Jay if we truly shared road @AlexWithAK @ohhleary
690190006917451777 2016-01-21 15:11:35 UTC <DHermanStudio> @AlexWithAK Maybe @NYC_DOT feeling nostalgic fr pre-@JSadikKhan days, when cars mattered more than people  @DNAinfo @ohhleary
690186668951891968 2016-01-21 14:58:19 UTC <DHermanStudio> @ohhleary That's what I meant: @NYC_DOT here seems to value parking over bike lane & bicyclists' lives - who asked fr this?
690183679558180864 2016-01-21 14:46:26 UTC <DHermanStudio> @NYC_DOT: #fixJaySt for all, esp fr vulnerable riders coming off bridge (no sharrows), more than just for drivershttps://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160120/dumbo/city-plans-remove-jay-street-bike-lane-make-room-for-2-way-traffic
690182374760513536 2016-01-21 14:41:15 UTC <DHermanStudio> @ohhleary Don't forget @NYC_DOT also removing actual bike lane to allow for parking, which (I don't think) even comm board didn't ask for
690171880981073920 2016-01-21 13:59:33 UTC <DHermanStudio> A good history (& probably more than than you could ever think about) 70s shows Galactica & Buck Rogers @PopMatters http://www.popmatters.com/feature/white-jumpsuits-sci-fi-tv-of-the-disco-era/

689809953935233024 2016-01-20 14:01:23 UTC <DHermanStudio> @politicony: @NYGovCuomo likes to cite Robert Moses, but forgets 2 of RM's best qualities: knew where $$ were coming frm & was on schedule
689808659946303488 2016-01-20 13:56:15 UTC <DHermanStudio> @DNAinfo It's a good start @BilldeBlasio, but you need to aim much higher: 1st, cams around ALL schools, then cams around rest of city
689807593536098304 2016-01-20 13:52:00 UTC <DHermanStudio> @FtGreeneCyclist @HildaBikes @transalt @inthebikelane Now let's get it ok'd by CB2 and built ASAP by @NYC_DOT - any timeline for completion?

689781233681825792 2016-01-20 12:07:16 UTC <DHermanStudio> @patkiernan On bicyclist death in Sheepshd Bay: the tragedy was a crash, not an accident, which implies no one's to blame #crashnotaccident
