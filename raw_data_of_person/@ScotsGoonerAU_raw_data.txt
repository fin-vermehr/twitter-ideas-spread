970556368443736065 2018-03-04 07:07:24 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> @MattWShore 
970387635741933568 2018-03-04 19:56:55 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> The calculation has to be; Will Arsne be able to take us further than a caretaker in the Europa? Id say no. The players have stopped listening and he has no idea how to fix it. #Arsenal
970385676662222848 2018-03-04 19:49:08 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Arsne stubbornly remaining in the job whilst it falls apart terribly is understandable () but wholly misguided. The board allowing him to continue is palpably negligent. #Arsenal #afc
970097951279235072 2018-03-03 00:45:49 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> @SavageBoston If they do that in the playoffs then we will be good! Nah youre spot on...
969324025611665408 2018-03-01 21:30:31 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> @gunnerblog I think he might be broken by it now. He does love the club and hes probably heartbroken by his (staggeringly late) realisation that hes hurting Arsenal.
969311542867935232 2018-03-01 20:40:55 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> At this point it doesnt matter what Arsne says to the team. Theyre not listening to him anymore. #arsenal
967880741341114369 2018-02-25 21:55:25 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Being desensitised to embarrassment. The #Arsenal fan experience.
962338395094577158 2018-02-10 14:52:07 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Even he knows he cant turn it around... #WengerOut
962331330213158912 2018-02-10 14:24:03 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Its really depressing. Theyre not a great side, theyre competent. We are not even that. I have no idea whether Lacazette is bad or Xhaka either. I do know that Wenger is no longer a good manager. Its sad. #Arsenal #WengerOut
960118855514255360 2018-02-04 11:52:27 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> @DerekSheen This may be the line of the year! 
958687585441730561 2018-01-31 13:05:06 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Mesut staying is wonderful.
958667234150309889 2018-01-31 11:44:14 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> @Arsenal Please remember Demba Ba!!
958459082532270080 2018-01-30 21:57:07 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Xhaka seems to be awful-but we cant really tell with this manager. #wengerout
958456304552394752 2018-01-30 21:46:04 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Wengers position is completely untenable now. He must know that he is no longer capable of the job. Surely. #Arsenal
958454720296771584 2018-01-30 21:39:47 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> At this point I feel like its reasonable to say that Wenger has lost the dressing room. There are players that I dont really rate, but its probably not fair to do that to them while Wenger mismanages them and the tactics. #arsenal
955088681143975937 2018-01-21 14:44:20 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Id like us to sign Aubameyang, hes a terrific player. But if we are going to do our usual indecisive nonsense then it seems stupid. At the moment we have simply destabilised another club. If we are serious about the player then pay the asking price.
952659666382680064 2018-01-14 21:52:18 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Arsne appears to be convinced that he can take #Arsenal forward, yet it is clear that he cannot. Its actually quite sad as well as frustrating watching his King Canute routine. Its been time to go for ages and it will only get worse.
952527588018147328 2018-01-14 13:07:28 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> So by selling Alexis to Utd they probably ensure Champions League Football while we fail to qualify. Fucking genius once again. And we help that odious troll Mourinho. We are a shambles. #Arsenal #AFC
950125683455356928 2018-01-07 22:03:10 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> The rest of this season should be about finding a great manager for the future. #arsenal
903367166757552128 2017-08-31 21:21:30 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> .@Arsenal Is this incompetence or nefariousness? You are treating us with contempt.  "Football is nothing without the fans"-Jock Stein
903083029819645952 2017-08-30 02:32:27 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> @soIoucity 
903082662985744384 2017-08-30 02:30:59 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> @celticsblog That seems fair. That asset is probably worth a lot more to them than us.
901925025992777728 2017-08-27 21:50:57 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> #everythingthierrysaid #Arsenal
901920967907094528 2017-08-27 21:34:50 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> And it's sad that so many of us have genuine affection for Arsne, but we can all clearly see that he is not the man for the job anymore.
901920213721006081 2017-08-27 21:31:50 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> It's clear that Arsne can't or won't fix this. The summer has been wasted and we are now already in huge trouble. #Arsenal
901918406810599424 2017-08-27 21:24:39 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> It's all pathetic really now at #Arsenal. Nothing is going to change and we look terrible.
823354389297405952 2017-01-22 02:19:18 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> This is fucking great! #patriots #PITvsNE
820862584349855744 2017-01-15 05:17:45 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> @jdf0325 Yes. She's exactly that.
820789485470236672 2017-01-15 00:27:17 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> What a game! #GBvsDAL
820618205743878144 2017-01-15 13:06:41 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> @Killuminati_P Fair point! 
820488639872266240 2017-01-14 04:31:50 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> @ichancayanan Could well be! I'll certainly take 34 points and 375 yards on that defense.
820487514024611840 2017-01-14 04:27:21 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Pats were sloppy tonight and still covered that spread. I'm sure that sloppiness will be gone next week. #Patriots #HOUvsNE
820486283638149120 2017-01-14 04:22:28 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Pats D has been superb tonight. #Patriots #HOUvsNE
820485850324549632 2017-01-14 04:20:45 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> John Elway is pretty smart. #osweiler
820483801058922500 2017-01-14 04:12:36 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> The Texans are going to be seriously good if they can get even competent QB play. #HOUvsNE
820479381353041921 2017-01-14 03:55:02 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> What a game Logan Ryan is having! #Patriots
798820372413956100 2016-11-16 09:29:52 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> A fantastic man. In my opinion he elevated the status of the US internationally at a time when it was really needed.
796470457918570496 2016-11-09 21:52:09 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> @7amkickoff you are a fantastic father to have raised your to child be so compassionate and kind.
796248848662310913 2016-11-08 07:11:33 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Lies, racism, misogyny and hatred appear to be the way to win elections now.
796247783560724480 2016-11-08 07:07:19 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> When you have family in the US, who are POC, this becomes fucking terrifying.
796247390298570752 2016-11-08 07:05:46 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> This is just awful.
787788761740357632 2016-10-16 22:54:11 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> & surely we should be aspiring to his level of ambition anyway?
787788512099569665 2016-10-16 22:53:12 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Pay zil the going rate-replacing him would cost far more than meeting his demands. & I don't think we can replace him. #class
781784496270028801 2016-09-30 09:15:23 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> @gunnerthoughts @PositiveAdi I think that he & Houilier got the highest honour that French citizens can receive from Britain in about 2002..
781781347538919424 2016-09-30 09:02:52 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Not only has Arsne been a fine manager for the club, he has represented the club in truly admirable way.  #wenger20
768428932106366976 2016-08-24 12:45:08 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> 
767856493035003904 2016-08-22 22:50:28 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> If we finish outside the top 4 will Wenger quit or blame it on an unfair football environment? #AFC #Arsenal
765299798131957760 2016-08-15 21:31:05 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Football, like most things has an element of evolutionary progress to it. #Arsenal do not appear to understand or accept this. #hubris
764963384257224704 2016-08-14 23:14:17 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Slightly proud of the fact that we will probably break Twitter after 1 game. But mostly frustrated at the hubris. #afc
764933671941836800 2016-08-14 21:16:13 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> I'm more fearful that Kroenke decides to sell Alexis, Koscielny & zil than hopeful that we actually strengthen the squad. #Arsenal
764926731144658944 2016-08-14 20:48:39 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Well that was predictable. I think Liverpool have the manager we should have tried to get. I'm not feeling optimistic for this season. #AFC
763486460280311808 2016-08-10 21:25:31 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Yet again #Arsenal look completely incompetent with regard to transfers. Of course we will take no action and complain about everyone else.
762936939703971840 2016-08-09 09:01:55 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> @RVArsenal I'll try my best...Our midfield is class, so is our defence (when fit), & we have 1 decent striker and some good prospects....
762127894604763139 2016-08-06 03:27:04 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> @RVArsenal And I feel exactly the same way! Hopefully a couple of signings will happen....
762126576611790848 2016-08-06 03:21:50 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> @RVArsenal there have been some, but usually his best transfers are done pretty early. I hope I'm wrong obviously! http://7amkickoff.com/index.php/2016/07/29/how-many-players-has-arsene-wenger-signed-between-aug-1st-and-14th/
762125228184961024 2016-08-06 03:16:28 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> @7amkickoff How hopeful are you for the coming season? The lack of recent activity, and international exertions, has left me quite concerned
762124696078786560 2016-08-06 03:14:21 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> @RealFPJr @AminESPN I cannot wait for my son to be old enough to watch this with him! It's really awesome!
762124368163942400 2016-08-06 03:13:03 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> ....as we are rapidly moving to a situation where we may no longer be competing at the top, but moving to mid table mediocrity. #afc
762124059433771008 2016-08-06 03:11:50 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> ...therefore this summer, like the last one, represents another missed opportunity. The impetus to change this must be from the Club board..
762123652703793156 2016-08-06 03:10:13 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> ...Our best players are some combination of Cech, Kos, Santi, zil & Sanchez. These players are peaking (or slightly past) NOW.....
762123266819403776 2016-08-06 03:08:41 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> ...the league or European cup, does this mean that he is building for the future? Because if so, then our timeline for that is ridiculous...
762122986715394048 2016-08-06 03:07:34 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> The reality is that we are probably not going to make another signing. Since Wenger must realise that the squad is not good enough to win...
755759209413693440 2016-07-20 13:40:11 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> London is imo the greatest city in the world. The Icardis are probably just on holiday!
750100764870127616 2016-07-04 22:55:33 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Wow-the #Warriors will be incredible in 2016/7! Well done @KingJames to beat them this year! Great for the #Celtics to have been considered
748829440180822016 2016-07-01 10:43:45 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> I got "Boston Celtics" on "Using only emojis, which team would you recruit Kevin Durant to?" What about you? http://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/16648865/nba-free-agency-2016-find-kevin-durant-free-agent-home-emojis
746790996051034112 2016-06-25 19:43:42 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> @DavidLammy Well said. The economic devastation this will cause is too much for such a small majority to carry. Thank you for trying!
746264489494872064 2016-06-24 08:51:33 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> So....now that Sterling is devalued, will there be an exodus of players from the Premier League?
746129847877984256 2016-06-23 23:56:32 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> I like the Brown pick. Smartest guy in the draft. #Celtics
739944007837581312 2016-06-06 22:16:13 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> At #lcfc Vardy has had a great season with a team in which he is perfectly integrated-it does make sense to stay.
739773313199673344 2016-06-06 10:57:56 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Really hoping that we are going to sign Mahrez. He's a fantastic player!
738981748151713793 2016-06-03 06:32:33 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> No person has ever transcended sport more than Muhammad Ali. An incredible man in every sense.
734146194968977408 2016-05-21 22:17:47 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> It is pretty impressive that Man Utd have managed to become an even bigger bunch of cunts.....
731653298369892352 2016-05-14 01:11:54 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> I was so excited when we signed TR in 2006. The injuries definitely restricted him-but his courage in coming back is so admirable. #Legend
724953368800550912 2016-04-26 13:28:46 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> #JFT96
706120282478551040 2016-03-05 14:12:49 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Thanks for the good times Arsne, but I think it's time that we parted.... #afc
705146061698912257 2016-03-02 21:41:36 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> It just gets worse with every game. Wenger will probably resign at the end of the season-but we may not even make the top 4!
705145111122849792 2016-03-02 21:37:50 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> Is there any other club that spends so much on wages and collapses every time that they have a chance of winning the league? #afc
705143709663252481 2016-03-02 21:32:15 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> It's really sad the way it's played out. But the truth is that we clearly need major changes and Wenger will not do that. #Arsenal
705143085890564097 2016-03-02 21:29:47 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> #KroenkeOut #WengerOut
705141362262343680 2016-03-02 21:22:56 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> It just gets worse...
705140660580429825 2016-03-02 21:20:09 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> What are the chances that zil leaves due to the shitness of the team?
704062353680134144 2016-02-28 21:55:20 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> It's sad but I really don't think it matters if Wenger goes. With Kroenke is charge any new appointment will be shambolic and incompetent.
704060746112454656 2016-02-28 21:48:57 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> ...the exact same problems we have had for years. Wenger is probably part of the problem but he is certainly not the end of it. #AFC
704060100554543105 2016-02-28 21:46:23 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> ...KSE teams are not successful, they simply make enough revenue to increase their value on a yearly basis. We have record ticket prices &..
704059766817947648 2016-02-28 21:45:03 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> ... And the next opportunity to improve will be ignored as we become another mediocre, sad & febrile part of Kroenke's sports empire.....
704058800853004288 2016-02-28 21:41:13 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> ...There have been opportunities to improve the quality of the team both this summer and in January and they have been ignored....
704058261335470080 2016-02-28 21:39:04 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> This seems like a very sad end to the Wenger era. The best chance to win the league in many years & a string of terrible performances......
698851185415970817 2016-02-14 12:48:01 UTC <ScotsGoonerAU> It's just cheating.
