881364682782777344 2017-07-01 04:11:29 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> So I dropped off my little Bro and @ConnorLundin got in the front and we were driving home down country lanes to get home...
881364328284385280 2017-07-01 04:10:05 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> I thought nothing of the bag until I went over it and consciously decided it was just a branch or something....
881364181328551937 2017-07-01 04:09:30 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> Until... I felt this crunch under my tires. I remember seeing a faint outline of what looked like a discarded macdonalds bag...
881363924779585537 2017-07-01 04:08:29 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> So I was driving on the motorway taking my little Bro home from his messy night out in Brighton and it was all going well, until...

872560458313732096 2017-06-07 21:06:39 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 'Pretty Woman' is still to this day one of the best films ever made.

871811399239991298 2017-06-05 19:30:09 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> @idkbayleigh She is one of the most accepting people I. The world no matter what category you fall under, that's not what a fandom is about. >
871810010837340162 2017-06-05 19:24:38 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> @idkbayleigh Then tough shit, you don't know them. The fact that you're all saying @Idkbayleigh is a homophobe is fucking stupid >
871809838023618560 2017-06-05 19:23:57 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> Sexual preferences or sexuality. Why is that going to make a difference to how you hear the music. If you can't deal with that >
871809591276916737 2017-06-05 19:22:58 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> Music has lots of meanings but I'd like the think the main one is sharing it with other people no matter their colour, gender, age... >
871809274745430017 2017-06-05 19:21:43 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> You're setting a really good example for the younger fans who are just in it for the music... GR8 WAN M8!! >
871809134722781184 2017-06-05 19:21:09 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> If you don't like the person don't talk to them or about them with other people or even tweet about them. JUST LEAVE THEM ALONE >
871809048060071937 2017-06-05 19:20:49 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> Considering what everyone is telling them to leave for is the complete opposite to what they're all about,  >
871808714034089985 2017-06-05 19:19:29 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> Great way to promote your favourite band by telling people if they don't like a certain thing that they should 'leave the fandom' >

735245531962826752 2016-05-24 23:06:09 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 22/ Again.  Thank you.  But no thank you.
735245154320326656 2016-05-24 23:04:39 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 21/ No one will be able to help you like me. Because that's just me. That's the way I am. That's why you come back.
735244961621381121 2016-05-24 23:03:53 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 20/ Go ahead carry on doing what you do, and I'll be here waiting to catch you when you fall. Because you will fall.
735244690749042688 2016-05-24 23:02:49 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 19/  Because I'm the person you treat as a piece of rubbish, take what you want and throw the rest away.
735244473106587648 2016-05-24 23:01:57 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 18/  Because a life without attention wouldn't suffice. Because a life without attention isn't enough.
735244202737553408 2016-05-24 23:00:52 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 17/  Thank you to the one person who knows what I'm dealing with and decides to make it about them.
735243678848012289 2016-05-24 22:58:47 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 16/  That's what friends are for. Right?
735243625446166532 2016-05-24 22:58:35 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 15/  So thank you everyone who has given me enough to build up my Kingdom of stress and let me deal with it alone.
735243403974299648 2016-05-24 22:57:42 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 14/ Of course I would never tell anyone how I feel, because who would be there to listen.
735243092081664000 2016-05-24 22:56:27 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 13/ Oh well, it's only me.   Thank you would be nice though.
735242562974404608 2016-05-24 22:54:21 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 12/  But the no longer have problems. Because I've fixed them all. So I guess I will wait until they have a problem. Then they'll have time.
735242308707323905 2016-05-24 22:53:21 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 11/ They should help me because I'm the one who always helps and never asks. Im the one who makes their problems dissappear.
735242103144480768 2016-05-24 22:52:32 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 10/  But of course, why should I expect anything else? They're only human. I've helped them they're all fine, why should they help me?
735241649056546817 2016-05-24 22:50:43 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 9/  It's not like I expected them to be there anyway. Because that's just who these people are.
735241490692247555 2016-05-24 22:50:06 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 8/  At a time where I actually am asking for help, all those who said they would help me are no where to be found.
735241270562586624 2016-05-24 22:49:13 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 7/ The one who knows what's happening. The one who is making it about them. The one who wants attention.
735240918912118784 2016-05-24 22:47:49 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 6/  The only person I can count on to make it easy for me, is the only person making it that much harder.
735240697184407552 2016-05-24 22:46:56 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 5/  It would be easier if it was just that, but no of course it isnt. This is life remember! It's never easy.
735240456993398784 2016-05-24 22:45:59 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 4/  Everyone is arguing over stupid things. And im the mutual in the middle trying to sort it out. Obviously it would be me. Who else?
735240246393208832 2016-05-24 22:45:09 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 3/  Of course that would only make it worse. Why would it be simple. I'll tell you why. Because that would make it easy.
735240086967726080 2016-05-24 22:44:31 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 2/  With the amount of stress I'm under... I highly doubt that. Trying to plan a holiday so that I can be less stressed.
735239854489997313 2016-05-24 22:43:36 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> 1/  It's been a hard week. Doctors say I need to be on pills for stress. Like a fucking pill is going to help me.
730375209950269440 2016-05-11 12:33:14 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> When you actually Park and every FUCKER in the entire college decides it's home time!!!!! #thanksguys!
730374840205647872 2016-05-11 12:31:46 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> Reasons I'm late to college:  1. Woke up late 2. Feel like shit 3. Can't find a space in the fucking car park!  45 minutes to park!!!!!!!!!!

691039773151117316 2016-01-23 23:28:15 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> No matter what age I am, I still struggle putting the straw in my #capri-sun
691015372099690496 2016-01-23 21:51:17 UTC <RudaaBeachyy> It takes me hours to shop on #impericon simply because I get distracted with the models tattoos.
