971081151455559680 2018-03-06 17:52:42 UTC <whatifisaidit> @PlumpyTrumpy @MSNBC Why does it take an additional 3 weeks? They've had more than enough time. This is just more BS.

971079983279099904 2018-03-06 17:48:04 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Pajjr2016 Now the chump thinks that he's better than George W. Bush? We can only assume that he didn't get enough attention when he was a child and remains a child til this day.
971078139291095041 2018-03-06 17:40:44 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Pajjr2016 .... and this what they truly believe, that because they are White, they can do anything and not be punished. They look at this president as being the prime example. It's not going to stop until Trump is replaced.
971077362602430464 2018-03-06 17:37:39 UTC <whatifisaidit> @OMGno2trump Trump's thought processes have always been theirs. It just layed dormant for the right candidate to come along and say that it's perfectly okay..... Look at me, I'm the president.
971076333492154369 2018-03-06 17:33:34 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TheRickyDavila They'll turn it over to Trump. He's not going to do anything.

970863998479536128 2018-03-05 03:29:49 UTC <whatifisaidit> Just the thought of a Trump Presidency for LIFE, makes me have a mental breakdown, like Nunberg! I'm barely making it through his first term, 8 years would be pushing it. LIFE? Oh no, I couldn't last in this country! @Lawrence @TheLastWord
970856886160494592 2018-03-05 03:01:33 UTC <whatifisaidit> I still can't get over the fact they twice he asked what they thought Mueller would do to him. Once on #MSNBC and again on #CNN.

970752415178940416 2018-03-05 20:06:26 UTC <whatifisaidit> Boy, I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING like this before..... EVER. #Mueller has somebody going freaking crazy here. Calling into @MSNBC. Just give him the emails, why don't you? Has he been drinking? He is angry!

970712371877629952 2018-03-05 17:27:19 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TearsInHeaven09 Trump should do a playback on how his argument sounds.

970709458665066497 2018-03-05 17:15:44 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TPM The only time we saw Paul Ryan or heard his cowardly voice, was the passing of the #TaxScamBill, which everybody knows that he'd dreamed about the bill all of his life!

970476477270589440 2018-03-04 01:49:57 UTC <whatifisaidit> Chris McDaniels, running for the Senate seat in Mississippi said " I was Trump before Trump." Mississippi, y'all don't need that kind of problem, believe us when we tell you!
970467224816439296 2018-03-04 01:13:11 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill We hate it, when they say this, knowing darn well that it's not "the thoughts and prayers," that kill people.
970464148223156226 2018-03-04 01:00:57 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Brandossius I am with you in that front! They publicly apologize  and compensate Martha Stewart if this is normal. She should sue!
970462814749057024 2018-03-04 00:55:40 UTC <whatifisaidit> @CindibiseniusOr @EdKrassen EXactly!!! That's all I'm saying. Trump loves money.
970461722338316294 2018-03-04 00:51:19 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill Yes it could be a little better, but tanking the American  economy is certainly not the answer.
970460113571143680 2018-03-04 00:44:56 UTC <whatifisaidit> @CindibiseniusOr Yes, I remember, and we were alerted to that. Why did they allow monies for something that they knew the administration never intended to do, to only wake up to to breaking news one day, that this WH can't and won't  account for the money allowed?
970450906947956736 2018-03-04 00:08:20 UTC <whatifisaidit> @NRA @Delta @EdKrassen This is to be considered an American business and they're in the business of screwing the American people..... and yes they all should be in jail for it.
970448827164647425 2018-03-04 00:00:05 UTC <whatifisaidit> @CindibiseniusOr With the Trump Administration spending tax payer monies for everything under the sun and no accountability, my question is simple: Where's the money?
970447766345474048 2018-03-04 23:55:52 UTC <whatifisaidit> @kylegriffin1 Someone probably should tell Trump, since it was reported that Trump has a "hit list," that #Mueller has one of his own.
970446567814688769 2018-03-04 23:51:06 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TearsInHeaven09 @Top_Sergeant You're right! .... and no response from the #FireTheGOP, that refuse to do their duty to make Trump #EnforceTheSanctions.

966411273679327232 2018-02-21 20:36:17 UTC <whatifisaidit> @SocialPowerOne1 What's Ted Nugent afraid of? Is he afraid that somebody is going to come and take his gun, leaving him nothing the grab in the middle of the night? It, because he's not man, sickens me. He's nothing better to do, than to invent a conspiracy against children who survived.

Hannity says things that as an American makes you shake your head and wonder, where'd he get that from? Then when you try to research it, you get Breitbart or some strange twitter account. Fox is #RussianTV.

965948548528435201 2018-02-20 13:57:35 UTC <whatifisaidit> Trump is the worst President in American History, who sits LAST on the list, who trails behind a Black President who sits at number 8. There's almost a day that doesn't go by that he doesn't wake up without Obama on his brain.

965792670391119872 2018-02-19 03:38:10 UTC <whatifisaidit> @deebrief Trump is a narcissistic. They show no emotions. Many of them believe that they are a God.

965699778054098944 2018-02-19 21:29:03 UTC <whatifisaidit> @mzgreen66 He did. He got the leaders together, your friends remember McConnell and Ryan? Instead, they chose not tell us but backed you %, remember? In other words, they chose Party, Trump, and Putin over country!

965472573583691777 2018-02-18 06:26:13 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill The biggest attack on American soil, since Pearl Harbor..... Trump can't be this stupid, can he?

965446500368166917 2018-02-18 04:42:37 UTC <whatifisaidit> @DaShanneStokes We don't. We celebrate the lives of the children who died because the GOP love money more than life. We celebrate #MuellerTime as it puts us closer to justice for Conspiracy against the US. And we celebrate the kids who have more courage to speak when Trump & the GOP were silent.
965438783389949952 2018-02-18 04:11:57 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder Positions unfilled, DT's attacks on intelligence agencies, #CorruptGOP buying into the BS & attacking ppl like Christopher Steele, who loves America more than they do, other countries skeptical about aiding the US in counter terrorism, a skip away from a foreign terroist attack.

965425874513350658 2018-02-18 03:20:39 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill It's not that they don't want to. It's greed of the Republican Party. For goodness sakes, how much money do they need in the coffin when they die?

965415709944709120 2018-02-18 02:40:16 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Kate_Is_Rising @cdashiell Why cast a very delicate vote (voice) for a party that's not going to win crap, but rather split up votes that really stand a chance to have some relevance, and power to get some good legislation passed. A foolish vote!
965411892142493697 2018-02-18 02:25:06 UTC <whatifisaidit> @kylegriffin1 Where the Russians could target us with disinformation like working on an assembly for Ford or GM.
965411071182991361 2018-02-18 02:21:50 UTC <whatifisaidit> @kylegriffin1 Wow, what an amazing story. He says that he was even ashamed of his work. Right here in America.
965406616031059968 2018-02-18 02:04:08 UTC <whatifisaidit> @BarbaraMain07 @March4HerandUs We wonder why?... as if we didn't know.
965405043179642880 2018-02-18 01:57:53 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ANTITRUMPMVMT All of these domestic attacks here at home. Homegrown hatred. And that is bad enough. I don't think that ppl are ready for Trump to be in charge of a physical bloodshed attack, the magnitude of 911.
965403821773152257 2018-02-18 01:53:02 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TheDemCoalition @greenhousenyt Yup. And it should be the end of days for Rubio as well. 2 leaders of Florida, just awful.
965400573817380864 2018-02-18 01:40:07 UTC <whatifisaidit> @SpeakerRyan @BarbaraMain07 @IronStache That is heartless. The leader of the House of the United States of America is there in Florida and doesn't visit the families of the slain, but can fundraise? We shouldn't be electing people like this.
965398620580339717 2018-02-18 01:32:22 UTC <whatifisaidit> @GaryTheCynic Oh no. Follow? Oh no. But I do read it second hand from the press.
965397211390586880 2018-02-18 01:26:46 UTC <whatifisaidit> @GaryTheCynic We see it differently. We want Trump to keep right on tweeting. Almost with certainty, every time that narcissist tweets, he doesn't realize that he digs himself a pothole. And #MuellerTime is coming soon.
965395381399023618 2018-02-18 01:19:29 UTC <whatifisaidit> You know what's so amazing to us?

They usually do, especially during election time.... short memories about what candidates did and said. Children are almost from a different world. I don't know of a child yet, that let's you forget anything.
965384208641351680 2018-02-18 00:35:05 UTC <whatifisaidit> @jenniferinidaho @JatikaSpeaks I guess that they hadn't given that much consideration at the time. Correction: These kids have stupid bat crazy skills with cell phones, and they don't vote YET.

965381573980905472 2018-02-18 00:24:37 UTC <whatifisaidit> @themiterman @perlmutations Yes, stench. And if they truly are laughing, it's because they have themselves are certain #PutinPuppet. One that is so stupid and naive and they couldn't have chosen a better one.
965379050142404609 2018-02-18 00:14:36 UTC <whatifisaidit> General McMaster DIDN'T forget to say anything, like Trump's tweet would suggest. We don't think that General McMaster is that stupid. We don't think that McMaster read the indictment the way Trump did. Wishful thinking perhaps? #KASIEDC
965377111199571968 2018-02-18 00:06:53 UTC <whatifisaidit> @SpeakerRyan @joanwalsh @SunflowerSoul71 Me too.

Because I don't really drink, I don't watch. There's already one freaking nutcase too many... with nuclear codes.
965373934026870789 2018-02-18 23:54:16 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RawStory @Brandossius Indeed, a regretful patsy at that.
965373565058080769 2018-02-18 23:52:48 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RawStory @Brandossius With all that has come out of the #NationalSecurityHearings and just the sheer sophistication of it all, we're not sure that America chose Trump, as as much as we believe he was installed.
965372640063090688 2018-02-18 23:49:07 UTC <whatifisaidit> @79Simon @wesley_jordan Rick Scott's not interested in anything the Floridians have to say, right now. They should show him how much they care about his words with their vote, as he courts running for Senator. But even still we wouldn't be interested in anything that had to say.
965370949238476800 2018-02-18 23:42:24 UTC <whatifisaidit> The kids say that they're not going back into a classroom until legislation is passed on #GunControlNow because they don't feel safe. What say you GOP? Do you intend for the children to remain out of school forever to safeguard your donor, the NRA?
965369272808689667 2018-02-18 23:35:44 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill WTH? America wake up, please. Are you reading this crap about the nuclear code scuffle?
965367528804507649 2018-02-18 23:28:49 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill BS. They aren't going to do anything because if they were so concerned, as an equal branch of this government they'd hold Trump accountable for not carrying out the sanctions that they've already passed.
965366205463912449 2018-02-18 23:23:33 UTC <whatifisaidit> @BarbaraMain07 @amjoyshow What's her name again?
965363813234200577 2018-02-18 23:14:03 UTC <whatifisaidit> @GaryTheCynic Hell yeah, they will.... And kids don't forget. Old people like me do.
965362889845608448 2018-02-18 23:10:23 UTC <whatifisaidit> @DrJillStein @sueleesyl And a Russian spokesperson as cited in the #NationalSecurityHearings
965360423641010178 2018-02-18 23:00:35 UTC <whatifisaidit> @BarbaraMain07 @krassenstein And I'll tell you something else. Parents listen to their children. I did. We learn things from them. We don't like seeing our kids hurt and scared. If they were once Repubs they might switch.
965358350446813186 2018-02-18 22:52:20 UTC <whatifisaidit> @mzgreen66 Never once in all of those Trump tweets this morning, not one mention about the funerals of the slain. Obama attended funerals. Trump is a joke.

965350258006986752 2018-02-18 22:20:11 UTC <whatifisaidit> This child had more courage than the GOP. As she was speaking, they were hiding. And so was their president.https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/965329486358155266
965348459757948928 2018-02-18 22:13:02 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill Ya think? If all you could come up with was "I don't recall," then you did!

After all, WHO wouldn't be angry that America was being attacked? But what he didn't know was that the Republican Party would choose Party over country. Had he known, things would've been different.
965336448550555648 2018-02-18 21:25:19 UTC <whatifisaidit> @mikebank_ @SimonWDC Well, Obama never took his off the ball. That statesmanship in him, in thinking that he needed to tell the leaders of the House and the Senate.... you know, how government should work, but didn't. McConnell had other plans, just hold on to the info.

964829752556126208 2018-02-17 11:51:53 UTC <whatifisaidit> Thank you!https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/964802361775370240
964829589448118273 2018-02-17 11:51:14 UTC <whatifisaidit> Republicans you have been officially put on notice! Get the wax out of your ears.https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/964817456597381121
964827146903580672 2018-02-17 11:41:32 UTC <whatifisaidit> So how does that work? Just keep feeding Putin classified information in secret conversations and unsecured settings.... we'll catch up to that later... in the meantime carry on?https://twitter.com/whatifisaidit/status/964821659445354496
964824584829718529 2018-02-17 11:31:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> All over a blow job?https://twitter.com/whatifisaidit/status/964823867935125505
964823867935125505 2018-02-17 11:28:30 UTC <whatifisaidit> @nytimes I just wanna know why the Republicans aren't screaming bloody murder about all of Trump's extramarital affairs? Didn't they have a heart attack about Bill Clinton?
964821659445354496 2018-02-17 11:19:43 UTC <whatifisaidit> Why is Trump N the Oval Office when he could have been a witting player as referred N the #MuellerIndictments & making decisions on behalf of the US? America has some mucked up laws. We could have a willing agent of Russia acting as a US Pres? Just asking!
964815660495843328 2018-02-17 10:55:53 UTC <whatifisaidit> In light of the new 37 page #MuellerIndictment, we ask why does Donald Trump have security clearance and why he wasn't he properly "vetted", his words not mine,  especially if some believe that his extramarital affairs now pose a national security threat?
964709519778631686 2018-02-16 03:54:07 UTC <whatifisaidit> Everything in this indictment substantiates the Steele dossier. I think that the GOP and especially #RemoveNunes, owes him an apology and a thank you. And what about that bogus investigation of Steele? @Lawrence @TheLastWord
964702189930336256 2018-02-16 03:25:00 UTC <whatifisaidit> Are any of Trump's statements ever presidential? No. A 5th grader could give a better one and unless you actually saw him, you'd never know his age. @Lawrence @TheLastWord
964698613753499653 2018-02-16 03:10:47 UTC <whatifisaidit> That's what Trump misses. There are no allegations in THIS indictment. But oh buddy, we're sure that this indictment won't be the last. @Lawrence @TheLastWord
964692029983903744 2018-02-16 02:44:37 UTC <whatifisaidit> @arkreader @krassenstein Did they? We don't watch. But we doubt if they do and if they do they'll spin it like Mueller is corrupt.
964691172592685061 2018-02-16 02:41:13 UTC <whatifisaidit> Fraudulent charges! Wire charges, banking charges.....https://twitter.com/whatifisaidit/status/964689994383331330
964689994383331330 2018-02-16 02:36:32 UTC <whatifisaidit> Maybe, just maybe, Mueller is signaling to Trump, about fraudulent activities with Manafort. Everybody knows how Trump embellishes. @maddow
964686744158457859 2018-02-16 02:23:37 UTC <whatifisaidit> Amen to that, Rachel. "FINALLY" someone is taking up for us. @maddow
964684032192770055 2018-02-16 02:12:50 UTC <whatifisaidit> Because #MuellerTime is smart, like that. That's how Mueller got it! @maddow
964682844399423489 2018-02-16 02:08:07 UTC <whatifisaidit> @JoyAnnReid It is. They should put Trump's azz in Leavenworth. #LockTrumpUp
964679695974436864 2018-02-16 01:55:37 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Bornabrit1 @funder And #RemoveNunes!
964679483155451904 2018-02-16 01:54:46 UTC <whatifisaidit> You betcha.... and that is a #FACT!https://twitter.com/prevostscifi/status/964678667237494784
964678777950363653 2018-02-16 01:51:58 UTC <whatifisaidit> Please don't tell us that Pruitt's feelings are as easy to hurt as Trump's. These ppl need to grow a pair..... 2 PAIRS. Geezus, we're grateful that Obama knew how to just dust it off. #inners
964677357712957441 2018-02-16 01:46:19 UTC <whatifisaidit> Yes Putin did pick the right horse, because the things that he is allowed even now  to get away with, he wouldn't have been getting away with it if Hillary had won!  #TrumpIsAPutinPuppet #inners
964676245547077633 2018-02-16 01:41:54 UTC <whatifisaidit> That's why it's always best to have an attorney explain what we don't understand. #inners
964675248871432194 2018-02-16 01:37:56 UTC <whatifisaidit> Excuse me. That it DOESN'T mean exoneration.
964674532018712576 2018-02-16 01:35:05 UTC <whatifisaidit> @AriMelber @KristenClarkeJD With the Republicans helping on that front, and they did tremendously, by purging lists of people in African America communities. People that hadn't missed casting a vote since they were of age to vote.
964673305742577665 2018-02-16 01:30:13 UTC <whatifisaidit> @JoyAnnReid Well it didn't influence those of us who could see clearly the BS. It was so vivid. And we didn't need people like #StateRunFoxNews and Hannity making our decision for us.
964672314309824512 2018-02-16 01:26:17 UTC <whatifisaidit> Trump's attorney needs sit him him down and read the indictment line by line and explain it as he goes to help him understand that this does mean exoneration. #inners
964667980935294976 2018-02-16 01:09:03 UTC <whatifisaidit> Y'all remember when Trump called us, #TheResistance, paid protesters? Wow, what a joke! The Russians placed paid protestors in Pennsylvania and set up rallies. #inners 
964654504879820801 2018-02-16 00:15:31 UTC <whatifisaidit> @DevinNunes @79Simon @JoyAnnReid Pretty, pretty please, the jerk!
964646664396050432 2018-02-16 23:44:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> Denial for Trump? Not anymore. ...... he even tells us in his tweet. So keep tweeting! #TheBeat
964638359284080640 2018-02-16 23:11:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> There you go ! It's in black and white now..... and what that means to me is that there was a conspiracy against the United States of  America to sway the election of 2016. And to me this Presidency is illegitimate. #TheResistance #ImpeachTrump #TrumpRussia.
964493573478633472 2018-02-16 13:36:01 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Pajjr2016 Good for them!The Republicans are on their way to becoming extinct. They don't realize, though as tragic as the massacre was, they're are looking at future voters, politicians, judges, etc. There will be hell to pay!
964491437889982464 2018-02-16 13:27:32 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Varidienne @eugenegu Yes it is, which is why you won't see anything done about these assault weapons. Leave it to the Supremacist to go on killing sprees. #GunControlNow #StopKillingOurKids
964489202032357376 2018-02-16 13:18:39 UTC <whatifisaidit> @JuddLegum Of course her tiny little mind would miss what James is saying. It's far to big for her to possibly understand.
964487137327505408 2018-02-16 13:10:27 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill ..........and back to business folks.
964486056669339648 2018-02-16 13:06:09 UTC <whatifisaidit> @cassandra17lina @SaysHummingbird That's nothing. Betsy DeVos and the rest of this crazy administration would have us all believe that we could stop the killing of children by simply arming teachers with guns in schools. That ought to take care of the problem.
964483698371461120 2018-02-16 12:56:47 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Shareblue Trump and his Administration are void of emotion, sense of decency, and care for humanity. Their hearts are hollow.
964481282322456576 2018-02-16 12:47:11 UTC <whatifisaidit> Trump shouldn't visit Florida. He'll only make matters worse. Given his inability to speak from the heart to the hurting parents of the victims and kids he's bound to say something foolish and insulting. He needs 2 stay hiding out in the WH, like he always does. #MorningJoe
964479052693299201 2018-02-16 12:38:19 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill That old play coming from the #ComplicitGOP is not going to work this time. Nobody wants to "take people's guns away!" We just want to keep them out of the hands of the mentally ill. But this what they scream with every massacre. #GunControlNow #StopKillingOurKids
964367787400441856 2018-02-15 05:16:12 UTC <whatifisaidit> @realDonaldTrump @Haikuwoman @funder When it comes to keeping our country safe from home grown terroist, Trump is sleep at the switch and his button is too small.
964367253436182528 2018-02-15 05:14:04 UTC <whatifisaidit> @CNNPolitics True, but we wouldn't hold our breath. "Moral obligation?" The GOP are anything, but moral.
964366509987454977 2018-02-15 05:11:07 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder @boldbizcoach @jatemple Geezus, and they continue to vote for these people against their interest. That's too sad.
964366162476728326 2018-02-15 05:09:44 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder Buddy Carter, Matt Gaetz, Jim Jordan, Steve King, Ted Cruz, Jeff Sessions, Fox and Friends, Sean Hannity, and Fox News!
964361536037830656 2018-02-15 04:51:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Momof15 @JonRiley7 Children were massacred, that's a #fact. Now that we have the facts, what are you going to do?
964360087870451712 2018-02-15 04:45:36 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder I hope that Trump supporters will wake up too because these massacres could easily be coming to a theater, school, church, or concert at home. It's not a Repub or Dem issue, it's a life issue. #StopKillingOurKids
964355637600595968 2018-02-15 04:27:55 UTC <whatifisaidit> That is the most disgusting insincere short speech to the citizens in Florida about the school shooting, delivered by a president. WHY did Trump read it and turn his head back & forth 2 prompters? It was so emotionless. C'mon what is he made of? No one should've had to read it.
964353241260675072 2018-02-15 04:18:24 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ANTITRUMPMVMT @ewilks56 He should have been talking much sooner, for the sake of the country.
964351210018000896 2018-02-15 04:10:19 UTC <whatifisaidit> @fawfulfan @Shareblue You know that things R really really bad, when the children start speaking out and pleading for America, the GOP to do something. That's especially why we don't have a choice any longer. #GunControlNow #StopKillingOurKids
964339885392957440 2018-02-15 03:25:19 UTC <whatifisaidit> Oh my goodnessSteve Schmidt says that what #FireSarah basically is saying to Kelly is look, I lie for the President, you go lie for yourself.. @Lawrence @TheLastWord
964337682800435200 2018-02-15 03:16:34 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Brandossius He probably will. He's already had a twitter war with a teenager since becoming president. Narcissisim doesn't have an age preference.
964334521792557058 2018-02-15 03:04:01 UTC <whatifisaidit> Silence, thoughts and prayers, and back to such things like the STAND ALONE BILL, attacking the disabled.https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/964305349284003841
964333700153528320 2018-02-15 03:00:45 UTC <whatifisaidit> Talking to the GOP about #GunControlNow is like talking to yourself. #StopKillingOurKidshttps://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/964326728150564864
964332947204661254 2018-02-15 02:57:45 UTC <whatifisaidit> Why do children have to beg for their survival? Why is their very existence controlled by the GOP and the NRA?https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/964329251196383232

964329215817601024 2018-02-15 02:42:56 UTC <whatifisaidit> @repjohnlewis Demanding is not going to work. We have called and pleaded, to no prevail. The time for pleading is over.

964325700084920320 2018-02-15 02:28:57 UTC <whatifisaidit> The GOP truly does STAND ALONE. @maddow #TheResistancehttps://twitter.com/whatifisaidit/status/964325000823099392
964325000823099392 2018-02-15 02:26:11 UTC <whatifisaidit> Why did you reverse the American with Disabilities Act of 1990, GOP? So now you have nothing better to do than to attack people with disabilities? They were already discriminated against before you took away the ACT. My God, why do you hate the innocent and helpless so much?
964316022886092801 2018-02-15 01:50:30 UTC <whatifisaidit> My heart swells. Oregon had the courage to introduce #GunControlNow. Thank you, Oregon. #inners
964128834227507200 2018-02-15 13:26:41 UTC <whatifisaidit> @NBCNews Stop hiding in the WH. Stop hiding behind tweets. Everybody doesn't have a twitter account, nor do they want to. Stand at the people's podium like a man and speak the words that the saddened hearts desperately need to hear.
964127415080488960 2018-02-15 13:21:03 UTC <whatifisaidit> The GOP are SILENT! Trump is silent. One day after the school massacre and nothing. Midterm is coming, but you'll hear from them then. Soft spoken promises just to get your votes. Remember how silent they were when we asked for #GunControlNow. #StopKillingOurKids
964125722838290432 2018-02-15 13:14:19 UTC <whatifisaidit> @StephenKing That's exactly right and the ONLY way. We STOP asking and demanding and since Congress won't do as we ask, for the safety of our loved ones we CHANGE the Congress. We all need to stop beating our heads over something that'll never change, and make the change ourselves.
963996949040033793 2018-02-14 04:42:37 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ANTITRUMPMVMT He deserves it. I don't live in Florida, but his constituents trusted him enough to vote him back into office again, by a hair. He doesn't support #GunControlNow and he's taking from the NRA and their kids are being killed. How does he explain it?  #StopKillingOurKids
963994231764381696 2018-02-14 04:31:49 UTC <whatifisaidit> @maggieNYT Hmm. Just turn off the lights and go to bed? And tomorrow, just stay in bed?

963985437986615296 2018-02-14 03:56:53 UTC <whatifisaidit> Let's do everything that we can think of to turn this thing around. Let's start with  Citizens United when we take control.

963970636929490949 2018-02-14 02:58:04 UTC <whatifisaidit> Every month or so. Sometimes a little longer, we get a mass shooting in a school. Prayers are sent out. NRA members (GOP) pictures are posted on twitter, and the amounts of they received, a week of silence, and then back to business as usual.
963967562919874560 2018-02-14 02:45:51 UTC <whatifisaidit> @PreetBharara Wow, we heard the other day that there were 30-40. That many?
963966236395819008 2018-02-14 02:40:35 UTC <whatifisaidit> The GOP aren't going to do what we need to have done. Their only concerns are the Koch Bros and the NRA. Yeah they'll send thoughts and prayers, but if we truly want to change our lives, we have to fight for it. And that means everybody has 2 VOTE. Let's stop begging!
963964423936364544 2018-02-14 02:33:22 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ANTITRUMPMVMT And as long as the GOP remain the majority. They're not going to do anything. Marco Rubio, sits, sending out thoughts and a prayer.

963955981435723776 2018-02-14 01:59:50 UTC <whatifisaidit> Trump can rally his base to take a stand against athletes protesting against violence and injustice, but he can't rally and take a stand against violence in schools where children are gunned downed trying to get an education?

963820640359911424 2018-02-14 17:02:02 UTC <whatifisaidit> @maggieNYT @EdKrassen SAD. Though I don't care for Kelly, Trump's now throwing him under the bus, for something that we believe that he was aware of too.
963818113056862208 2018-02-14 16:51:59 UTC <whatifisaidit> @CNN Right.... but this Administration can take food stamps away from veterans, whom many left body parts on the battlefield, then #StateTVFox, tells them to get a job. THEY HAD ONE, protecting these fools!

962752021286801408 2018-02-11 18:15:43 UTC <whatifisaidit> Is she a freaking Russian spy....... has she been turned?https://twitter.com/whatifisaidit/status/962751452698595328
962751452698595328 2018-02-11 18:13:28 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TeaPainUSA She really should be investigated. How much money is Russia paying her to use #RussianFoxNews to start conspiracies and spread #fakenews? How often does she report to Putin? Is she the go between Donald Trump and Putin? Does she get her topic before airing?
962748457478950912 2018-02-11 18:01:33 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Artzthings Because it's the #PartyofPedophilia. And I don't say it lightly, but if you don't speak out and stand against it..... then you must be for it!
962744045801017346 2018-02-11 17:44:02 UTC <whatifisaidit> We are under the assumption that security clearances don't mean a pile of beans to the GOP. Everyone in the Trump circle has an on classified info. Will they sell America out for info they're aware of? Could they be blackmailed for what they know? It's not important, right?
962741357751275520 2018-02-11 17:33:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> So true, but speaking spiritually, I would imagine that there will be a time and a place (hell) for men just like this who use religion for hate, destruction,bigotry, racism, and other things, then claim to do the will of God. God has a day and we'll have ours and kick them out.
962737612929884161 2018-02-11 17:18:28 UTC <whatifisaidit> @realDonaldTrump @funder There's no telling what Tim Nolan got away with as a Judge.
962737206346551296 2018-02-11 17:16:51 UTC <whatifisaidit> Oh, the president didn't know, "generic" response. "Trump is very disturbed by what he sees." Clearly a president out of touch with his own surroundings. And with a president who doesn't read briefings, what about OUR surroundings?  Boy, are we in trouble.
962729382342283265 2018-02-11 16:45:46 UTC <whatifisaidit> We are so glad that someone finally speaks out against the silence and #VoicelessGOPWomen. Have they pledged 'loyalty' to Trump? #AMJoy

962718806807384064 2018-02-11 16:03:44 UTC <whatifisaidit> @CNNPolitics @RWPUSA We seriously doubt that any women are listening to her, with the exception of the #VoicelessGOPWomen in Congress who never weigh in on anything and CONTROLLED women viewers of #StateNewsFox.

962712411081003009 2018-02-11 15:38:19 UTC <whatifisaidit> @tribelaw @JoyAnnReid So the Dems @AdamSchiffCA, would be completely in their right to read #TheDemsMemo on the floor! We are the Dems to put it into the record!
962710185700675590 2018-02-11 15:29:29 UTC <whatifisaidit> What Trump is doing, is asserting dictatorship authority! He missed his deadline in writing. Because he speaks it, doesn't give him complete authority. This ain't Russia! #AMJoy Read #TheDemsMemo on the floor.
962708453050519553 2018-02-11 15:22:36 UTC <whatifisaidit> It might not be up to Donald Trump to #ReleaseTheDemsMemo. It shouldn't be up to Trump, period. #RemoveNunes, Tump, and #StateTvFox put the out there, so they're angry now because they have to walk in it? Read the memo on the floor! #AMJoy
962705672461869056 2018-02-11 15:11:33 UTC <whatifisaidit> No, they didn't. But it is a case of do as I say and not as I do, and don't question or rebutt what I do. #ReleaseTheDemsMemo READ IT ON THE FLOOR!https://twitter.com/tpm/status/962418742599802887
962704334239797248 2018-02-11 15:06:14 UTC <whatifisaidit> This just spells out 1 thing to us.

962702559340388352 2018-02-11 14:59:10 UTC <whatifisaidit> It's just a clear indication that Trump is lost, doesn't know how government works, and has no clue about what he's doing. None. Blame this on Obama too?https://twitter.com/tpm/status/962506570872614912
962701154516983808 2018-02-11 14:53:36 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill Between Trump and his family costing the American people an UNHEARD of amount of money, and the #TaxScamBill, that rewards the rich, the perks and favors given to anybody associated with the Trump businesses, will there be an America left, with Japan and China holding our debt?
962696564362883072 2018-02-11 14:35:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> @BevReese No, she's not. She did sell sold her soul. It's the sole intention of #RussianFoxNews to distribute #fakenews to their viewers, knowing perfectly well that whatever they report to their audience, they'll believe it.
962694285383659520 2018-02-11 14:26:18 UTC <whatifisaidit> In the future it might serve the people speaking on behalf of Trump to simply let him speak for himself. They certainly wouldn't look like a complete fool after the fact.https://twitter.com/thinkprogress/status/962634842008637440
962692719670910976 2018-02-11 14:20:04 UTC <whatifisaidit> @CNNPolitics We doubt that Kellyanne was shocked at all. Since the campaign of Trump she's been very protective of men who've preyed on women, specifically her president. Why would this be a shocker to her at all?
962690925486133248 2018-02-11 14:12:57 UTC <whatifisaidit> @krassenstein Steve Bannon is no Trump. He's not totally ignorant, he just happens to be a bigot. Though I am no fan of bigots and racists, I have found myself agreeing with Bannon a few times and this is one.
962689118730964992 2018-02-11 14:05:46 UTC <whatifisaidit> It's easy 4 someone like Trump 2 defend the worst people especially when you are one of them: You may have done 1 or more of the things another person is accused of. No one, until now has ever questioned it, therefore you don't see it as wrong. Narcissistic personality disorder.https://twitter.com/usnews/status/962497392196059136
962685573063430144 2018-02-11 13:51:41 UTC <whatifisaidit> It's your right to demand that a medical assistant be present and if feels inappropriate to report it.https://twitter.com/usnews/status/962661342590185472
962525662698524672 2018-02-10 03:16:15 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill We love his interviews. He usually offers more information than he realizes. It makes Mueller's job easier.
962525188494692352 2018-02-10 03:14:22 UTC <whatifisaidit> @CREWcrew We don't think that the #NunesMemo defended Trump at all. It made Trump look desperate and it made the GOP look even more complicit. #ReleaseTheDemsMemo
962522172114833409 2018-02-10 03:02:23 UTC <whatifisaidit> @OregonJOBS2 Since the wave of the Republicans (Tea Party), we need to take the majority in state government. Now you have the 'right to work laws' throughout the country.
962518811923632129 2018-02-10 02:49:02 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Shareblue That's the word. SHAME!! Shame on America for electing Trump as president!   What other reaction would Trump take if he weren't a shameless man?  A man that doesn't respect women at all. It's simply what a man like Trump would do, smear the victim.
962515907363909632 2018-02-10 02:37:29 UTC <whatifisaidit> @OregonJOBS2 Like we said, the #PartyofPedophilia.

962505771144613890 2018-02-10 01:57:12 UTC <whatifisaidit> The talk of the weekend, Porter. Trump loves it, as long as we're not talking about #TrumpRussia, but #MuellerTime is on the way. ... and hopefully @AdamSchiffCA will read the #TheDemsMemo on the floor for the record. We don't forget. #TheResistance
962503892805275649 2018-02-10 01:49:45 UTC <whatifisaidit> Trump's not % stupid. He trouted out Clinton abusers, says they were telling the truth, but when his abusers come forward he says that they're lying & that he plans 2 sue. 2 ex wives of Porter say they were abused, DT says to keep in mind that Porter claims innocence.
962501008088805377 2018-02-10 01:38:17 UTC <whatifisaidit> @JoyAnnReid Nope. He has kissed the ring.
962495818765873152 2018-02-10 01:17:40 UTC <whatifisaidit> I remember when it was first announced that Kelly was coming on board as the Chief of Staff, having been brought up in a military family and marrying one, I thought yes. Finally some organization, structure, and integrity. Boy was I ever wrong! 
962318104327065605 2018-02-10 13:31:29 UTC <whatifisaidit> @mcspocky Oh for goodness sakes, man up whinny!!
962316322158858241 2018-02-10 13:24:24 UTC <whatifisaidit> A president that's a sexual abuser. An administration that beats women.

962313848257699840 2018-02-10 13:14:35 UTC <whatifisaidit> @stonecold2050 Trump blamed the #TrumpStockMarketCrash on the Stock Market.... WTH?
962312397288624128 2018-02-10 13:08:49 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill ..... and tyrants, dictators, and White Supremacist. It is extremely unusual for anyone to side with people whose mentality enjoys pain and suffering done to other ppl. It's like Trump enjoys hurting or seeing other ppl hurt or abused. WEIRD.
962187050110930944 2018-02-09 04:50:43 UTC <whatifisaidit> Trump BASHES the Stock Market now, on twitter. #The11thHour ..... it didn't go his way?

962178815022813184 2018-02-09 04:18:00 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TheBaxterBean Republicans are pedophiles, sexual abusers, and women beaters. The Party of all of the above. It's as simple as that!

962169957646852098 2018-02-09 03:42:48 UTC <whatifisaidit> Don't you Republican women have anything to say about your #corrupt president and his women beating Administration? Do you ever speak? WTH? Don't you stand up for anyone other than Trump? Do you have a mother, nieces, or daughters?

962166527062667264 2018-02-09 03:29:10 UTC <whatifisaidit> @realDonaldTrump @DemResistance What kind of excuse will the Republican Party give us WHEN we are attacked? What excuse will they make for Trump? It's just a matter of time, with Trump not reading briefings and trying to tarnish the intelligence agencies. Terroist are always plotting.
962164790058782720 2018-02-09 03:22:16 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RedTRaccoon Trump and his Administration are some of the most disrespectful, corrrupt and nasty people to ever enter our government. I don't how we're going to get the respect back that America used to have after these people are finally gone.

962162879905652736 2018-02-09 03:14:41 UTC <whatifisaidit> Remember with Trump and the GOP, there are no rules. With #RemoveNunes playing lapdog for Trump, ignoring the recusal, what rules are the GOP using?

962159842155814912 2018-02-09 03:02:37 UTC <whatifisaidit> The #DemocraticMemo has been examined by the DOJ, Repubs & the FBI and given the green light.

962084028072460288 2018-02-09 22:01:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> @maddow Hmmmm.
961826586159755264 2018-02-08 04:58:22 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder Well, didn't Trump admit that he could virtually get away with anything? ..... and so far he has. It's bound to catch up, but they think that because Trump can do it, so can they.
961824228923211776 2018-02-08 04:49:00 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill Are you kidding?

961820240182067200 2018-02-08 04:33:09 UTC <whatifisaidit> Some people like us, believe that Pence knows more than his whinny voice would suggest, that he knows exactly what happened and he's just keeping enough distance in hopes of separating himself for corruption.https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/961807629235269633

961805467755393024 2018-02-08 03:34:27 UTC <whatifisaidit> @JoyAnnReid If a President is unaware of what's going on in the White House, that's all the more reason why he shouldn't be there.

961782134288633859 2018-02-08 02:01:44 UTC <whatifisaidit> @homemadeguitars @tbarton0925 Agree. All the more reason to be careful who we send to support us in Washington. It's time for McConnell to go. I don't usually agree with Supremacist, but Bannon was right on that front.

961777546588315648 2018-02-08 01:43:30 UTC <whatifisaidit> The GOP will hurt the United States' economy like a hurricane if they let Trump deport these kids. They haven't figured out the contribution that they make to this country, but they will when it's too late. #inners
961774833741848576 2018-02-08 01:32:43 UTC <whatifisaidit> @sirDukeDevin Propaganda News is what landed us Trump! #RussianFoxNews should be eliminated because that's what they spread.
961772607329759232 2018-02-08 01:23:53 UTC <whatifisaidit> The kicker is that Trump and his Administration will forever be in chaos, because Trump has never had respect for the FBI, DOJ, or the CIA. He has a defiant attitude and he's determined that what anybody else tells him, it doesn't matter. @inners
961769617206202368 2018-02-08 01:12:00 UTC <whatifisaidit> The Trump Administration always overrides the findings of the FBI concerning security clearances. There are more working without security clearances. Now they pretend to be shocked. NO just busted. #inners
961748205598904326 2018-02-08 23:46:55 UTC <whatifisaidit> @rjsmith169 The right wing media represents the Republican Party, the party of "family values." Since the day Trump was sworn in, we've had a glimpse of how they view "family values," and it ain't pretty.
961746043414212608 2018-02-08 23:38:19 UTC <whatifisaidit> @mmfa They always do a great job of dismissing negative coverage relating to Trump, his administration, or the #ComplicitGOP. You'll hardly hear on their show any  daily pertinent information. They would have you believe that everything is A-Ok, everyday. Nothing is A-Ok everyday!
961741054528643072 2018-02-08 23:18:30 UTC <whatifisaidit> @keithboykin Sometimes in life you just have to say NO, even to the things that you might perceive as opportunity, because In the end, all money is not good money.
961603925316132864 2018-02-08 14:13:36 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ABCPolitics Trump is a liar. That's evident in his refusal to let refugees come here, fleeing oppression.
961600277156687872 2018-02-08 13:59:06 UTC <whatifisaidit> Throughout the campaign from the 1st release of Hillary's emails until the end, that's ALL we heard from the media, while Trump traveled America lying and UNCHECKED on the spot. A text about Hillary's emails has surfaced again. We don't want to hear this S**t throughout 2018.
961594397115781120 2018-02-08 13:35:44 UTC <whatifisaidit> A parade? Bring all the military and equipment to Washington, for what? At some point Trump can take the mic and force them to listen to his narcissistic, dictator speech? Pay them more money, that's how Trump can honor them. They're paid pennies while the rich enjoy a #TaxScam!
961591680720883713 2018-02-08 13:24:56 UTC <whatifisaidit> I don't want to talk about the text that claims Obama wanted to be informed about Hillary's emails. I do however want to talk about why after going to Mitch McConnell to inform him of what was happening according to intelligence, McConnel REFUSED to act. Let's talk about that!
961590140673101825 2018-02-08 13:18:49 UTC <whatifisaidit> @krassenstein Countries where dictators want you to stand and applaud them, and countries where the dictators want to show the world their force.
961449422973493248 2018-02-07 03:59:39 UTC <whatifisaidit> Whatever happened to Republicans and family values. Is that just a talking point? @Lawrence @TheLastWord
961446933163315200 2018-02-07 03:49:46 UTC <whatifisaidit> Almost every Republican that I talk to says it. @Lawrence @TheLastWord
961446635183263745 2018-02-07 03:48:35 UTC <whatifisaidit> Is "The president cannot be prosecuted" being circulated by the Russians like they circulated #ReleaseTheMemo? Your guest said that people shouldn't be saying that
961445001959002112 2018-02-07 03:42:05 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MikeLevinCA I miss that President that had an IQ of 170, Barrack Obama.
961440150021697536 2018-02-07 03:22:49 UTC <whatifisaidit> @GOP @rjsmith169 Well they purge and without you knowing it. I was purged, but I keep check on my voter status, like I do my credit cards, etc. They did almost a month before the 2016 election. I'd advise people to check their status frequently.
961438776512995328 2018-02-07 03:17:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> These Republicans R going to get enough of standing up 4 men that do ugly things. We teach our sons that stuff like this is not cool...and Republicans back this. I just couldn't be a member of the Republican Party. They close their eyes when they should speak out. @Lawrence
961437674488950785 2018-02-07 03:12:58 UTC <whatifisaidit> What kind of Bishops are these people to tell a woman that's being beat and wants a divorce to "Hang in there?"  Just stay and continue to be beat whenever the mood hits him. That's sad. @Lawrence @TheLastWord

961434191056523267 2018-02-07 02:59:08 UTC <whatifisaidit> SEXUAL ABUSE.                        PEDOPHILIA.                             DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.                  CORRUPTION.                           Yep, that = Republican Party.
961432638966943744 2018-02-07 02:52:58 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Shareblue Yep, they've gone from the #PartyOfPedophilia (offered no response on #NoMoore) to the #PartyOfDomesticViolence ("A man of great integrity "). WTH is that?
961430823726669824 2018-02-07 02:45:45 UTC <whatifisaidit> @WalshFreedom Another reason would be that not only did the hack Democrats, they ALSO hacked Republicans they just didn't release anything. But the question is: WHAT DO THEY HAVE?... and when will it be released?
961428848704413696 2018-02-07 02:37:54 UTC <whatifisaidit> Whoa... we think that any one of your kids would make a better president too AG Holder. Anybody else probably would make a better president than Don the http://Con.LOL, I'd make a better president.@maddow
961426178409222144 2018-02-07 02:27:18 UTC <whatifisaidit> @EricIndyv6 Give us Nancy Pelosi any day of the week. When you're up against a corrupt Washington, like what's there now (GOP), you'd better have a fighter like Nancy. She'll will get in the mud with ya. That's why the Republicans fear her so much.
961425197852184581 2018-02-07 02:23:24 UTC <whatifisaidit> Yes!  Obama, we want some more your time, whenever, whatever, and however we can get it! AG Eric Holder and the REAL president Barrack Obama. Great team!  @maddow 
961420547895779328 2018-02-07 02:04:55 UTC <whatifisaidit> @AprilDRyan There seems 2b a lot of that. Jared Kushner STILL to this day doesn't have a security clearance. Security clearances R 4 good reasons and yet the GOP continue to close their eyes and allow it. So ANYBODY with all kinds of baggage is allowed. Why have a security clearance?
961418397018927104 2018-02-07 01:56:22 UTC <whatifisaidit> @NancyPelosi @DrDenaGrayson Pelosi is a fighter!

961339712706400258 2018-02-07 20:43:42 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MalcolmNance, The Russians are already working on the mindset of the American ppl. It's particularly working with Trump supporters, with their signature into the 2018 elections titled #ReleaseTheMemo. Purpose: cast doubt on the FBI & Steele's dossier, led by Repub Party. @MSNBC
961062966140469248 2018-02-06 02:24:01 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Shareblue Being wiped clean!
961049896773214209 2018-02-06 01:32:05 UTC <whatifisaidit> That was dumb exchange. If the Congressman really believed that bogus theory, why wasn't the FISA leaked then. It would have been end of story, yes? #inner
961046779092525056 2018-02-06 01:19:42 UTC <whatifisaidit> It's a problem to Trump. It's a problem for Trump's Administration. It's a problem for us, that it's a problem for Trump. #ProtectDACA is not a problem.https://twitter.com/whatifisaidit/status/961044469981302784
961044469981302784 2018-02-06 01:10:31 UTC <whatifisaidit> That's the White House's problem right there! Sarah H.

961004889278156800 2018-02-06 22:33:14 UTC <whatifisaidit> The Repubs N Washington, pad their pockets.They're in control of all 3 branches, and we pay them. So why do they run OUR government as if it's living from paycheck to paycheck? Extend this 3 months, extend that 3 weeks. Why not pay the darn bill and stop putting it off? #MTP
961000531039784961 2018-02-06 22:15:55 UTC <whatifisaidit> @krassenstein Trump embarrasses us everyday and the only way to avoid it is to not watch the news or read a paper.
960997847922507776 2018-02-06 22:05:16 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TeaPainUSA Indeed, they do.

960992283737849857 2018-02-06 21:43:09 UTC <whatifisaidit> It's a sad day in America when the people that we elect, pay to represent us, the country, democracy, and the Constitution, go to Washington only to work for Putin and pledge loyalty to Trump.
960990842507931648 2018-02-06 21:37:25 UTC <whatifisaidit> @osullivanauthor We don't. And we don't watch certain 'talk show hosts, or #RussianNewsFox.
960987965429374976 2018-02-06 21:25:59 UTC <whatifisaidit> @jaketapper People think that we are too hard on Trump. America wasn't this blatantly racist before Trump. These pieces of think that this country belongs to them and Trump and frankly we're tired of it. I don't like guns, but these fools are crazy, so I carry one everyday!
960984286559170560 2018-02-06 21:11:22 UTC <whatifisaidit> I wish that those decent young people had a place to go other than here. They are some of the hardest working people you'll ever meet, gifted, talented, and educated. If they were to leave here, YOU lose, America loses, dumb azzes!
960983139702145026 2018-02-06 21:06:49 UTC <whatifisaidit> Can anybody in the Trump Administration say anything decent about people? I don't think that Kelly had the right to say that. Why can't these people speak without trying to denigrate other people? They have contributed more than a lot of those beer gut Trump supporters!
960982008691339266 2018-02-06 21:02:19 UTC <whatifisaidit> AWH MAN!!! @elonmusk that takeoff was BEAUTIFUL. We enjoyed it. #MSNBC
960976112544309249 2018-02-06 20:38:53 UTC <whatifisaidit> The Dems ALREADY had the DOJ and the FBI view the #DemocraticMemo, for security reasons. So what possible security reasons could Trump possibly have? Remember that #RemoveNunes & the GOP refused the #NunesMemo to be viewed. #MSNBC

960939710951690240 2018-02-06 18:14:15 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill Great! We hope that #RemoveNunes is out.
960938743669710848 2018-02-06 18:10:24 UTC <whatifisaidit> Now that's bad, when  your own attorney don't want you to sit down 1 on 1 with the special prosecutor, for fear that you might lie. Is Trump even telling his attorney the truth? How does an attorney represent a client like that? LOL. It doesn't get any better with a grand jury.
960871772240384001 2018-02-06 13:44:17 UTC <whatifisaidit> Someone should tell #RemoveNunes, that if he's going to go on national tv and lie for Trump, to make sure that there's no video contradicting the lie being displayed on all the news networks. Oh, except #State Sponsored Fox.
960864995293659136 2018-02-06 13:17:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> @splcenter This is exactly what we are afraid of. The 'alt-right,' considers Trump their leader and many of the killings are carried out in the name of Trump. It's also a reason he should be careful with what he says.

960614525228773379 2018-02-05 20:42:04 UTC <whatifisaidit> You mean Trump's asking for money for his racist wall, gave ALL of the rich ppl more money, asking for a LOT of money for infrastructure. Everybody knows, you can't spend money that you don't have. So the market went crazy?@MSNBC  BASICALLY?
960613305126711305 2018-02-05 20:37:13 UTC <whatifisaidit> @LifeOnTheBeach7 She's right. THANK YOU, LAWD!

960603627017695268 2018-02-05 19:58:46 UTC <whatifisaidit> This Ohio speech makes no sense. WTF is Trump talking about? Enough, remote, click off...https://twitter.com/whatifisaidit/status/960602277269725184
960602277269725184 2018-02-05 19:53:24 UTC <whatifisaidit> OMG! What a total disgrace to America. Please Americans Trump is not the one. We DESERVE so much better. The man stands there in Blue Ash, Ohio and lies through his teeth. C'mon  how many lies do we have to endure? If we've heard one, do we have to hear more? When will he stop?
960590531624566784 2018-02-05 19:06:44 UTC <whatifisaidit> @rorycooper @thedailybeast And THAT is a prize for the GOP Russian Party. Long after Trump is gone the manipulation game will be played and we will not be safe.
960589590611615744 2018-02-05 19:02:59 UTC <whatifisaidit> @FoxNews @RanttMedia SAD. In 2016, we had WikiLeaks, Putin, and his propaganda running via twitter and Facebook. Today we have Fox and Friends, and the specialty conspiracy theorist, Sean Hannity, and the GOP Russian Party. We have work to do!
960587919718277122 2018-02-05 18:56:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> Really? Paul Ryan says that he's not moving forward on anything (DACA) if doesn't meet Trump's approval. Tell me why we need these people again? We're going to do everything we've been doing registering & foot soldiering.. so that we can get these nuts out! Pay them? NO!
960584497011011585 2018-02-05 18:42:45 UTC <whatifisaidit> @HuffPostPol We're getting kind of tired of these mild excuses for Trump. "Losing his touch," having a fit in the Oval Office. It's a shame that we have to b subjected to this s**t  and that they have to always figure out how to get Trump back to the #AdultDayCare.
960582692566945792 2018-02-05 18:35:35 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Blk_Cat713 That is lying tweet as usual, especially when you consider that Trump came into office sabotaging the exchanges. Lordie, if the idiot could only learn how to take responsibility for what he does..... not what anybody else does, just his actions.
960581551003140096 2018-02-05 18:31:03 UTC <whatifisaidit> @robreiner Our sentiments exactly. We are just trying to allow #ProtectMueller to do his job. We are watching, though patience is difficult.
960580709466374145 2018-02-05 18:27:42 UTC <whatifisaidit> @EdKrassen Trump is not going to do so. And the GOP Party of Russia are not going hold his feet to the fire. We are convinced that whatever Putin demands, the GOP & Trump  will deliver. It's Feb. 2018 and Kushner still doesn't have a security clearance. 
960577701374513152 2018-02-05 18:15:45 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill OMG. Putin has really taken over the United States of America by way of Trump, his administration and the #ComplicitGOP. Day by day democracy is eroding. Step by step, straight out of Putin's playbook.
960554858771308546 2018-02-05 16:44:59 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ViewFromWise If anybody is seriously hurt or killed, this will be the fault of the GOP Russian Party and Treasonus Trump! #ImpeachTrump #ComplicitGOP #ProtectTheFBI
960552878808141825 2018-02-05 16:37:07 UTC <whatifisaidit> Amen @MalcolmNance. The GOP Party of Russia don't care that they are helping Trump tear down the institutions that all us rely on to do Putin's bidding. SAD. @MSNBC
960551572550963204 2018-02-05 16:31:55 UTC <whatifisaidit> Hilary was right about Donald Trump being a puppet for Putin. What she didn't know was that the Republican Party is also Putin puppets. Who knew?  #MuellerTime #ProtectTheFBI #ProtectMueller #ComplicitGOP
960549479035400192 2018-02-05 16:23:36 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ADIC33 Until #RemoveNunes makes Dictator Trump angry, and he throws his azz under the bus.The devil has no friends.
960547595620929537 2018-02-05 16:16:07 UTC <whatifisaidit> Republicans are the Party of treason. There's no basis for what #RemoveNunes is doing. The Republicans and Trump have thrown the FBI under the bus to support and back Carter Page, adviser to the Kremlin. WTH? #ProtectMueller release the #DemocraticMemo #ProtectTheFBI
960540815788593154 2018-02-05 15:49:11 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Shareblue What are they gonna do when Trump is impeached? We see that Republicans have adopted Trump's bully tactics with their ads. Trump won't be president forever, thank the Lawd. Time can't come fast enough! #ImpeachTrump #ProtectMueller #ProtectTheFBI
960461770249986048 2018-02-05 10:35:05 UTC <whatifisaidit> @BleacherReport How little people celebrate the Patriot's loss is a lot of fun.

960373853338963968 2018-02-04 04:45:44 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Stonekettle Right....... so bring your azz back to the United States, so that it can be prosecuted!
960371873577095168 2018-02-04 04:37:52 UTC <whatifisaidit> @NicolleDWallace Is "Trump" sitting next to Trump? He should ask "Trump" if he should plead the 5th.
960367777256235008 2018-02-04 04:21:35 UTC <whatifisaidit> We get that Trump's the pres, but he doesn't respect the men and women in the intelligence agencies. Who's to say that the info given to him, wouldn't put them in harms way, especially since he uses intelligence so irresponsibly?https://twitter.com/whatifisaidit/status/960365652186984448
960365652186984448 2018-02-04 04:13:08 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Shareblue Maybe the intelligence agencies should think carefully about the info they give 2 Trump. Seriously. It could fall into the wrong hands with Trump as a president. He's given away classified info 2 the Russians once that could have cost lives and now, #RussianNewsFox? Hannity?
960358287437910016 2018-02-04 03:43:52 UTC <whatifisaidit> @mzgreen66 LOL.

960214887820615682 2018-02-04 18:14:03 UTC <whatifisaidit> But Kellyanne Conway said just today, that "they support the release of the #DemocraticMemo." ..... that they welcomed transparency.. Is she sure?https://twitter.com/whatifisaidit/status/960213079664594944
960213079664594944 2018-02-04 18:06:52 UTC <whatifisaidit> Trump is not going to let the people view the #DemocraticMemo. Trump can't handle the #truth. Approval of the release to him.... would be an admission of guilt. We don't believe that it'll happen and if it does, he'll DEMAND  a watered down version. @MSNBC
960210635589128193 2018-02-04 17:57:10 UTC <whatifisaidit> NO, NO, NO! Trump is on track of running this country, exactly the way that he ran his businesses. Spending money that we don't have. #TaxScamhttps://twitter.com/shareblue/status/960185589474709505

960208568942301185 2018-02-04 17:48:57 UTC <whatifisaidit> Fingers are crossed.

960207533079252992 2018-02-04 17:44:50 UTC <whatifisaidit> No we disagree, but the Trump family is a treasonous family and Jr. might be the second most treasonous of all.https://twitter.com/politicususa/status/960172477363228672

960189960522477568 2018-02-04 16:35:00 UTC <whatifisaidit> That's extremely sad and disappointing. Your guest said that there's no circumstance that would make the Republican Party impeach Trump...so he is 'above the law' and there's no law that applies to Trump. What will the Republican Party do when people take to the streets? #AMJOY
959878385773305858 2018-02-03 19:56:55 UTC <whatifisaidit> @PreetBharara America's been through a lot, Americans even more. Why did we go through so much pain if we were just going to serve America up on a platter by Putin's puppet?

959648395286732800 2018-02-02 04:43:01 UTC <whatifisaidit> Since Russian Fox News Hannity advises Trump, we're almost certain that there are probably some things that Mueller would want to know. #NunesMemos #TrumpRussiahttps://twitter.com/whatifisaidit/status/959647141168852992

The men & women nationwide that serve the country, stopping homegrown terroist, to those abroad only to stop an investigation that shows he's guily more, every single day. #ProtectMueller
959086328204922880 2018-02-01 15:29:34 UTC <whatifisaidit> @cassandra17lina You'll never see this with Puppet Trump. He drools all over himself whenever he's in a room with Putin.
959057993089343489 2018-02-01 13:36:58 UTC <whatifisaidit> Integrity of the FBI? TRUMP HAS AN ENEMY LIST. And yes Senator Paul is right.... but apply that to Trump. We do have to be careful who we give too much power to. Specifically Trump, a vindictive president. He is worse than J Edgar Hoover! #MorningJoe
959045102357352448 2018-02-01 12:45:45 UTC <whatifisaidit> No, those that remain are going to continue to help Trump turn our democracy into a dictatorship. Destroy our free press, courts, FBI, DOJ, and everybody in this country answers and bows down to him? No way! #MorningJoe
959034720528011264 2018-02-01 12:04:30 UTC <whatifisaidit> We support the FBI! And we are watching. #ProtectMueller #ImpeachTrump #TheResistance #MorningJoe
959033754160418816 2018-02-01 12:00:39 UTC <whatifisaidit> You are right, many people aren't paying attention. There are just trying to survive.But people are tired of Paul Ryan, and #NunesMustGo playing politics with our lives. Who's going to protect us, them? They are ruining career lives and putting ours in danger. #MorningJoe
959030719459872768 2018-02-01 11:48:36 UTC <whatifisaidit> That's says everything. Paul Ryan had bipartisan support to make changes to improve those meaures, he knocked that down and now he claims great concerns in the way things are done. Such hypocrites. Now he attacks the FBI for doing their job. #MorningJoe
958920968138784768 2018-01-31 04:32:29 UTC <whatifisaidit> @SpeakerRyan @funder At this point recusal is not good enough, #NunesMustGo, should resign.

958839628232101889 2018-01-31 23:09:16 UTC <whatifisaidit> @politicususa Oh my goodness. PLEASE tell us that Trump wasn't trying to beat this record too.pic.twitter.com/crWkeq4NuZ
958839048713404417 2018-01-31 23:06:58 UTC <whatifisaidit> I think that it's safe to now say that Comey wasn't lying when he says that Trump asked him for loyalty. Trump appears to have asked quite a few people. #TheBeat
958828412155629568 2018-01-31 22:24:42 UTC <whatifisaidit> One of the problems is that Trump also doesn't know who really is or is not "loyal" to him. As this investigation by Mueller goes on, you're gonna find a bunch of Trump loyalists jumping ship. #MTP #ImpeachTrump. We hope that #NunesMustGo is next!
958824496269578240 2018-01-31 22:09:08 UTC <whatifisaidit> @krassenstein #Kremlin Fox News had better do the damage they can. We have a feeling that the Democrats are pretty fed up with fake Russian propaganda news too. Hopefully when they take control they'll pass legislation against PURPOSEFULLY lying, and #fakenews outlets.
958822074570723329 2018-01-31 21:59:31 UTC <whatifisaidit> @krassenstein Well, who would know better, the BS coming from Donald Trump, than she would? She's lived it.
958819855343419393 2018-01-31 21:50:42 UTC <whatifisaidit> Trump's attorney is trying his best to find some law that prohibits Trump from talking to Mueller. What we like, is that Mueller doesn't talk, not a word! Everything said is speculation. No one knows what he has. Trump should make an APPOINTMENT. #TheResistance #MuellerTime

958816044285558786 2018-01-31 21:35:33 UTC <whatifisaidit> A man DIED here. Some are in critical shape, and all Trump has to say is:https://twitter.com/thehill/status/958803588654010368
958815575240790016 2018-01-31 21:33:41 UTC <whatifisaidit> So it's like that now? What the courts have to say don't mean a pile of beans?https://twitter.com/thehill/status/958806655814299648
958811659459493888 2018-01-31 21:18:08 UTC <whatifisaidit> @brianstelter WTH? Trump hasn't learned yet? "On my team." I need your loyalty, can you let this go? What else?
958809575079202816 2018-01-31 21:09:51 UTC <whatifisaidit> C'mon on California.... really you guys can do so much better than #NunesMustGo. He's walking a treason line in his obstructionist efforts.
958808488322457601 2018-01-31 21:05:32 UTC <whatifisaidit> @EdKrassen Maybe Trump is preparing to nominate him to a seat on a court for his help on #TrumpRussia.

They claim to love the military so much, but they'd risk the military out there fighting wars with no allies. All for the sake of protecting Trump. A memo that omits #facts."
958788179670249472 2018-01-31 19:44:50 UTC <whatifisaidit> @BAHAMAS97 They may not believe it, but I do. You can't keep doing bad things in life and expect good things to come.
958787631239720960 2018-01-31 19:42:39 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Shareblue @cj_disabledVet The bottom line is the GOP is lying and the FBI basically told them as much and let them know that knew exactly what they were doing! 
958783847616925696 2018-01-31 19:27:37 UTC <whatifisaidit> The FBI says that #NunesMustGo's memo omits #FACTS and is factually inaccurate and "misleading." Deja Vu? AKA, the #fake Trump presidency.  #ImpeachTrump #VoteTheGOPOut #TrumpRussia #ComplicitGOP #TheResistance
958780472108122112 2018-01-31 19:14:12 UTC <whatifisaidit> @DevinNunes @TheDemCoalition We don't have any proof of this yet, but I think it is something that we have all considered.

958778594938978304 2018-01-31 19:06:44 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ladiesgun Exactly what I was afraid of, that's why I didn't.
958777675560226817 2018-01-31 19:03:05 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RNicholasBurns Agree, but look at who you're talking about here.
958777061186916352 2018-01-31 19:00:39 UTC <whatifisaidit> @dailykos 1st on the Republican 'Communication' venue should be how to assault a journalist for doing his job, lie, get away with it, and go on to be elected.
958770152832753664 2018-01-31 18:33:12 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Lawrence @cbowers1057 That's exactly what it feels like to me.

958769317943939072 2018-01-31 18:29:53 UTC <whatifisaidit> What is wrong with this picture? You don't have to adjust your TV. Speaker Ryan calls for a "cleanse" of the FBI, while Trump uses taxpayer monies in his State of the Union Address to RAISE money. HUH, WHAT? He used OUR money to make himself some money. "CEANSE?"
958763353995915272 2018-01-31 18:06:11 UTC <whatifisaidit> @EricHolder Things like giving Russians classified info, which is what Trump did. It appears that this Repub Party has not a care in the world as it relates to classified info or intelligence capabilities. If allowed to continue down this path, America will truly be in its own N the world.
958760665145073664 2018-01-31 17:55:30 UTC <whatifisaidit> @AriMelber "Accuracy?" I don't recall any accuracy in the Republican Party since Trump was sworn into office.

958757681656946693 2018-01-31 17:43:38 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Lawrence Funny isn't it? They help cast doubt about the wrong doings of a lying corrupt President, divide this country, erode America's standing in the world and everything else that was built, then take off and live their lavished lives. MAGA, right?
958755946125197313 2018-01-31 17:36:45 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Evan_Rosenfeld We should ask: When is the near future? The end of this year, next year, never?

Especially when HE supported #NoMoore, a pedophile, which his faith says it's okay, then has an adult entertainer paid off. Family?

958326463782117376 2018-01-30 13:10:08 UTC <whatifisaidit> Yesterday, Trump virtually told America to kiss his azz, that'll he'll tell the FBI & DOJ what to do. And oh, that he's not going to implement the #RussiaSanctions. And he dares ANYBODY to try to stop him. #RoguePresident #ProtectMueller #ImpeachTrump prepare to #TakeToTheStreets
958324212380430336 2018-01-30 13:01:11 UTC <whatifisaidit> We don't have any leaders in Washington. We don't see leadership in Ryan or McConnell. They both hold titles and rack up money! When a situation in America occurs they both run and take shelter (hide), until they think it's ok to come out. #MorningJoe
958321378343702528 2018-01-30 12:49:56 UTC <whatifisaidit> @goodoldcatchy Neither can I. I'd rather have a tooth filled without Novocain. It's less painful.
958318457493352449 2018-01-30 12:38:19 UTC <whatifisaidit> @EdKrassen #fakenews Fox, has a brainwashing effect. If Kremlin Fox told its viewers that 911 never happened, they'd believe it.
958316235934044162 2018-01-30 12:29:29 UTC <whatifisaidit> No respect for the branches of government or the rule of law. Trump gets to tell the FBI and the DOJ what to do and how HE wants it done.. This government is a JOKE. And Americans will start to view as exactly that! #MorningJoe #ProtectMueller
958313662254649344 2018-01-30 12:19:16 UTC <whatifisaidit> We realize that Mueller is suppose 2 report his findings 2 the Congress, but we hope that since the #ComplicitGOP & Trump spit in the of the Constitution, that Mueller takes to the podium and tells America himself, "what the hell is going on." At least we'll know. #MorningJoe

958189173856522240 2018-01-29 04:04:35 UTC <whatifisaidit> Barrack Obama told us EVERYTHING and some about what we needed to know about Trump...... but he was just a Black President that spent one full term and half of another getting us out of the.

958185824432123906 2018-01-29 03:51:17 UTC <whatifisaidit> Forgive us, but we don't have any sympathy for Trump voters who Trump has dumped.

958179340377784320 2018-01-29 03:25:31 UTC <whatifisaidit> The #Complicit GOP have ALLOWED Trump 2 get away with not implementing the #RussiaSanctions. Again, they kiss his ring.

958123211064999936 2018-01-29 23:42:29 UTC <whatifisaidit> So the GOP have a "full scale investigation" going on into the FBI and DOJ.  They are now investigating the investigators!..... so full of S**t. But they don't want #TrumpRussia investigated. People that put their lives on the line to save ours. #TheBeat
958120319889362945 2018-01-29 23:30:59 UTC <whatifisaidit> #NunesMustGo! It is so clear that he is doing the bidding of Donald Trump with the help of this Republican Congress. Nixon tried too, but our parents said no... and to the streets they went. So shall we! #TheResistance #ProtectMueller

958115038388260864 2018-01-29 23:10:00 UTC <whatifisaidit> COUNTRY OVER PARTY. It doesn't matter what the GOP say or do, country wins in the end. #ProtectMuellerhttps://twitter.com/whatifisaidit/status/958113691790139392
958113691790139392 2018-01-29 23:04:39 UTC <whatifisaidit> It is so disheartening for most of us, for me when I look into my father's face, who is vet and loves this country. He says he would do it again. The one thing that I personally feel good about is knowing that Trump will drag a lot of the GOP right down with him! #ProtectMueller
958110774802702336 2018-01-29 22:53:04 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder Which Republicans will be implicated in #TrumpRussia? Which Republicans will be implicated in the obstruction of justice? #ProtectMueller

958087737437032450 2018-01-29 21:21:31 UTC <whatifisaidit> @HHSGov @realDonaldTrump @stopthenutjob The greatest thing about all of this is: just because Trump gets his way in the dismissals of Yates, Bharara, Comey, McCabe doesn't mean he gets to keep them from talking to Special Prosecutor Mueller, if they haven't already.
958084665818173447 2018-01-29 21:09:19 UTC <whatifisaidit> Now that was really disgusting what Trump said to FBI Dir McCabe... and to insult him about his wife. What president does this? I don't even believe that Nixon did that one. Keep on trying to make a Pres out of this piece of , Repubs! @MSNBC
958080553227571203 2018-01-29 20:52:58 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill We do too! Seemed like too nice of a guy to be caught in that BS... but he did and we're not interested in @MSNBC making a path for his resurrection!

958060438675247110 2018-01-29 19:33:03 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill Did Trump also invite parents that have lost loved ones due to his racist fan base, crazy Supremacist? #TrumpIsARacist!

958037359274201088 2018-01-29 18:01:20 UTC <whatifisaidit> We watch everyday as Trump, Repubs, and Hannity sit back and decide who next to go after, to end their careers, in hopes of getting rid of everyone that think might pose a threat to them as Mueller investigates the CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Amazing!
958034512985968640 2018-01-29 17:50:01 UTC <whatifisaidit> America is consistently losing talent, expertise, brilliance, (IQ's) because the hard right, most of whom are bigoted or racist want us to accept and normalize this  piece of whatever they choose to call him, against all norms. #NeverMyPresident EVER.

957659325044060165 2018-01-28 16:59:10 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill They can hope, but Trump going after Jay Z is a nightmare coming for them! #AlertTheAdultDayCare
957656908218994690 2018-01-28 16:49:33 UTC <whatifisaidit> .....so Trump again has pulled out his hit list of Black people to attack. Why can't he just concentrate on running the country and stay out of controversy?  Here's one he should concentrate on: SPECIAL PROSECUTOR MUELLER! #AMJOY
957653926848888833 2018-01-28 16:37:43 UTC <whatifisaidit> We hear Senator Graham in his defense of Special Prosecutor Mueller, but we''re not so sure that the money will be there when we try to cash the check! #AMJOY
957647927995924480 2018-01-28 16:13:52 UTC <whatifisaidit> Jonathan Capeheart is right. Fox really should be investigated for spreading fake news across their airwaves. When will politicians take the issue up? When people get killed based on false information delivered by Fox and Hannity?  #AMJOY

957086262451736576 2018-01-26 03:02:01 UTC <whatifisaidit> @DLeonhardt Hannity really needs to be investigated. We've read stories that he is run, some of which could have cost people's lives. That is extremely dangerous. His shows now are  Russian propaganda news. We hope that Dems will investigate this because there is something sinister.
957079397412032512 2018-01-26 02:34:44 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder Trump is looking more and more foolish around the world.

957076060113338368 2018-01-26 02:21:29 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RawStory He thinks that we're safer with Trump? No other country is ever going to trust us with intelligence, let alone give us a heads up ever again, as long as Trump remains in office.
957074710227013632 2018-01-26 02:16:07 UTC <whatifisaidit> ..... and #NunesMustGo used portions of the sensitive material that was not allowed to leave because of the sensitivity to construct his own .... and talking points. I HAVE HEARD IT ALL! @maddow
957074068364083200 2018-01-26 02:13:34 UTC <whatifisaidit> Wait, #NunesMustGo views the sensitive material, then left and wrote his own memo, based on the sensitive material that he had been shown? WTF? What is wrong with the Republicans? Are they that stupid? @maddow
956880492334370819 2018-01-26 13:24:22 UTC <whatifisaidit> How in the world does Trump and the Republican Party plan to protect us against terrorism when they consistently try to tear down intelligence agencies that protect us everyday from such harm? Are they going to do it? @MSNBC #MorningJoe
956871728101318657 2018-01-26 12:49:32 UTC <whatifisaidit> Obstruction of justice hearings will never be held, regardless of the news yesterday.

956864840387219457 2018-01-26 12:22:10 UTC <whatifisaidit> No, "it's not always about the economy stupid." What's extremely frightening to us is how much the Republicans are willing to look the other way while we have a president who clearly thinks that he's above the law. #MorningJoe
956713955187191809 2018-01-25 02:22:36 UTC <whatifisaidit> That's laughable!! As if Mueller would hold a grudge about a membership at Trump's stupid golf course. Trump toots his horn too much. @maddow

956381055640064001 2018-01-24 04:19:47 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thinkprogress Because it's a hoax. They play a lot of hoaxs. Like the time Trump threatened Comey about having tapes. No one has found them yet.

955608703448895488 2018-01-22 01:10:43 UTC <whatifisaidit> @JoyAnnReid Like we said earlier. We need to round up every Supremacist and ship their ***right out of this country. Those are the ones that Trump needs to deport.
955601628018724864 2018-01-22 00:42:36 UTC <whatifisaidit> Eric Trump is right when he says that his father has gotten more done than any other president. That's true. He has managed to muck this country up so bad, it'll take years get back.Just America's standing in the world alone. Damaged. We just hope that it can be repaired. @MSNBC
955596648247386112 2018-01-22 00:22:49 UTC <whatifisaidit> @JoyAnnReid There isn't a sane thinking person here on twitter and other places that hadn't thought about that. Given the fact that Donald Trump is a liar and a racist, we all saw this coming.
955595647540977664 2018-01-22 00:18:51 UTC <whatifisaidit> @rjsmith169 Sure it is. That's what cowards do. They use other people to fight their battles, but when it's one on one.... they RUN!

It is not representative of the God I serve!
955589066287927296 2018-01-22 23:52:42 UTC <whatifisaidit> The January 9th Trump was nothing more than a photo op. He lied then and he'll always lie. #TheBeat
955586688872480768 2018-01-22 23:43:15 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder It will be a long war as Joy suggested and it is a good article. I guess that we are tired of the lies. As far as McConnell's promise goes, the Dreamers had a promise from the United States of a America. Both Trump and McConnell have spit in the face of America, but we'll see.

955583852512243712 2018-01-22 23:31:58 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Michael36776349 There will never be a comprehensive imigration bill for any path forward as long as a Supremacist or Nationalist whisper in Trump's ear. And it doesn't take much because  #TrumpIsARacist.
955582216779726848 2018-01-22 23:25:28 UTC <whatifisaidit> So more or less the WH got rid of one Supremacist , Bannon and installed another one, S. Miller. DACA can hardly be happy about that. #TheBeat
955580738124042241 2018-01-22 23:19:36 UTC <whatifisaidit> McConnell has never given the American people a reason to trust a word coming from his mouth. It would be different coming from a person whose words was worth something. Integrity is worth a million dollars. But maybe not to some people. #TheBeat

955525268797640705 2018-01-22 19:39:11 UTC <whatifisaidit> It would help if the President actually knew what he was doing. Changing his mind on everything. We know this to be true because we heard as much from Graham and McConnell. Truly it was a #TrumpShutdown
955522183014551553 2018-01-22 19:26:55 UTC <whatifisaidit> We #TheResistance hope that Pres.Kelly, VPMiller, and aide Trump will leave their racist views at home before they enter the WH. America is not their private toy! @MSNBC

955511308023140354 2018-01-22 18:43:43 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Trishalla2012 We also had a #NoDACANoDeal promise too. It was promised by America, but that didn't mean diddly squat. Trump came along and blew that one up. #TrumpShutdown... so promises, promises.

Now he wants to play the sympathy card.  @JoyAnnReid @ MSNBC #TrumpShutdown
954862322593484800 2018-01-20 23:44:52 UTC <whatifisaidit> Yes, the American ppl do know what's going on here. The GOP's word is about as good as a used Kleenex. ..... kick the can down the road. A man is as good as his word and their word isn't any good! So McConnell speaks with a fork tongue. #TrumpShutdown @JoyAnnReid

954824093437759489 2018-01-20 21:12:58 UTC <whatifisaidit> Trump played games with people lives for 1 whole week, ending last night in a government shutdown.

954709070371610625 2018-01-20 13:35:54 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MyraDSirois1 Right. And McConnell and the GOP are suppose to read Trump's mind as he refused to tell them what exactly he wanted. At this point who knows what he wants.... the wall offered was a no-go. #TrumpShutdown
954707607138250753 2018-01-20 13:30:05 UTC <whatifisaidit> It's SAD!! A game playing pres is said to not be upset in his tweet about the shutdown because he wants to label it the Schumer shutdown. McConnell begged him to tell them what he wants, Schumer offered the wall, he didn't want it. A president playing games. #TrumpShutdown
954704108807688193 2018-01-20 13:16:11 UTC <whatifisaidit> I don't know why Hugh Hewitt continues to call it the Schumer shutdown, yeah, I really do, another story. Everybody that's been keeping up know that it's a #TrumpShutdown. They also know that he campaigned for it.

954581749287268352 2018-01-19 05:09:58 UTC <whatifisaidit> Trump wrote that release. Those words sound just like him.... obstructionist? And Dems didn't place the country in jeopardy... Trump did when he crashed the deal with  his racist rant. #The11thHour #TrumpShutdown #GOPshutdown

954564788436324353 2018-01-19 04:02:35 UTC <whatifisaidit> ..... because so much hatred kept the GOP from keeping the government open. Taking care of children (CHIP) and keeping America's promise to DACA!https://twitter.com/whatifisaidit/status/954563609115484160
954563609115484160 2018-01-19 03:57:54 UTC <whatifisaidit> I don't want to hear another word from Trump and the GOP about honoring the flag, being patriotic, and none of that . What did they do to help the military tonight? #TrumpShutdown

950504062557933568 2018-01-08 23:06:42 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill Again... who's lyin? Trump or Wolff?
950481217585115136 2018-01-08 21:35:56 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill .....and boom he'll be confirmed, with ties still in tack with pharmaceutical companies or (stock). WATCH THE PRICES of pharmaceutical drugs soar. Geezus again and again.
950477893020409856 2018-01-08 21:22:43 UTC <whatifisaidit> Say nice things about him... hang out with him... whatever it takes to get what they want. It's truly "sad" to watch. Especially when they're away from him or if caught on a speaker belittling him.  @MSNBC
950476150949761024 2018-01-08 21:15:48 UTC <whatifisaidit> The GOP knows that Trump is dealing with mental issues. This is not new to them. But they're in a majority right now and Trump doesn't read, so they push what they NEED for him to sign and let the chips fall where they may. @MSNBC
950470878634143744 2018-01-08 20:54:51 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill Maybe Bannon should request an interview with Mueller.

950465741844819969 2018-01-08 20:34:26 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder Absolutely. In Trump's racist mind, if it ain't white, it ain't right.

950379849671233537 2018-01-08 14:53:08 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Shareblue Oh well, I am mentally unfit.
950190909978808321 2018-01-07 02:22:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill Well..... at least not in public anyway.
950188690634133504 2018-01-07 02:13:32 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RPMMAS I don't understand the anger coming from the GOP and Trump. The leaks are coming from his own people. They 're screaming from help! We can't know unless they tell us.
950187078993793025 2018-01-07 02:07:07 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MichaelWolffNYC @BlueVotr Trump should read it if he can read...... or have it read to him.
950183596006019072 2018-01-07 01:53:17 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ColleenBoykin1 And everytime one of the bat crazies go on TV for purposes of lying and deflecting, that should be shut down just like today.
950178809185259520 2018-01-07 01:34:16 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Michael36776349 There should be an investigation on all GOP. We need to know who all got Russian money. That's the money we need to follow.
950176853918183424 2018-01-07 01:26:30 UTC <whatifisaidit> @prevostscifi He lies so much, He probably doesn't believe himself.
950175781002596352 2018-01-07 01:22:14 UTC <whatifisaidit> You know, I hadn't looked at it that way.
950174818309206016 2018-01-07 01:18:24 UTC <whatifisaidit> Donald Trump says, "I'm really, really, really, smart." Damn, all of those "reallys" in one sentence? Who exactly is he trying to convince? #KASIEDC
950171896687091713 2018-01-07 01:06:48 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ladiesgun Especially if he doesn't hold one back for himself. Because he is definitely a #FakePresident.
950171177661685760 2018-01-07 01:03:56 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill Notice how all Trump affiliates throw the word 'liar' out? 
950169127322255360 2018-01-07 00:55:47 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Shareblue Celebrating? I've had a sickness in my stomach, since the day Trump was sworn in. #ImpeachTrump #ReleaseTheTranscripts #ComplicitGOP #TrumpRussia #TheResistance #NeverMyPresident
950166781427093504 2018-01-07 00:46:28 UTC <whatifisaidit> @politicususa I'm waiting for Democrats to take back the House.

950062675035394049 2018-01-07 17:52:47 UTC <whatifisaidit> @CNN I remember when Trump threatened "Fire and Fury," on North Korea. It looks like he got his wish in a book title that everyone in the GOP should bury themselves in this weekend. Maybe they'll start to think Country instead of Trump.
950061224577978368 2018-01-07 17:47:01 UTC <whatifisaidit> What keeps them there? The money? Would they feel better if their bat crazy President started a war and people died? What would it take for these people to stand up for the country?https://twitter.com/shareblue/status/950034836844027904

950054942894690305 2018-01-07 17:22:04 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ProudResister Again I agree. The only thing that I would add is that the Media start to call these complicit GOP out for who they really are, because now we truly know that their allegiances are with Trump and not the country.
950052795905867776 2018-01-07 17:13:32 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MSNBC @CNN @realDonaldTrump @jaketapper @ColMorrisDavis I totally agree! Though I applaud him, it comes a day late and a dollar short. So many lies and allowed to go on and on. To me the cameras should have been shut off. Lies like they were the gospel and known lies.
950050138663333889 2018-01-07 17:02:58 UTC <whatifisaidit> What exactly was it that made Steve Bannon bow? Was it the Mercer money or was it the "Sloppy Steve?" Just asking? @MSNBC
950049066813198336 2018-01-07 16:58:43 UTC <whatifisaidit> @gryking Please do Michael, drop the tapes. You could do 1 per day. You know sort of like Hillary's emails...... some daily.
950047101303558146 2018-01-07 16:50:54 UTC <whatifisaidit> It's crazy isn't it? So far the only ones that we've seen on their knees bowing before Trump, as someone suggested, are the people who were part of his team. Bannon apologizing? #AMJOY

949735086391529473 2018-01-06 20:11:04 UTC <whatifisaidit> @JoyAnnReid Knowing Trump, he'd probably say something foolish like they were being audited too.

949646578704437249 2018-01-06 14:19:22 UTC <whatifisaidit> @HuffPostPol Blood is one day going to be on the hands of the Republican Party as the "very stable genius" leads them and orders over a cliff, which is where THEY should be, NOT us!
949643667559600128 2018-01-06 14:07:48 UTC <whatifisaidit> We guess now that Graham and Grassley want to go after Steele, other people, countries, allies, will think twice about sharing valuable information with the United States that might one day save our lives. It is shocking what they're doing.

948755688339197954 2018-01-03 03:19:17 UTC <whatifisaidit> It pisses me off that everybody including Trump was surprised about his con azz win.

948748782770024453 2018-01-03 02:51:51 UTC <whatifisaidit> @AP There never was any voter fraud to begin with. Trump was simply trying to plan ahead for a reelection. Afraid that ppl would finally find out that he was a corrupt con man? And that the vote that he got from them, he might not get again, knowing what they know now?

948627334613094400 2018-01-03 18:49:15 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill Whaaat? Bannon actually made that charge. I guess that the Friday night fight might be too long of a wait. @Lawrence
948623989517291522 2018-01-03 18:35:58 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Lawrence . I guess we'll go get popcorn and watch. It'll be Friday night fights.... "let's get ready to rumble."
948622577580236800 2018-01-03 18:30:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> @NBCNews From one lost mind.... speaking to another?
948621716846206976 2018-01-03 18:26:56 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TomSteyer We don't know.pic.twitter.com/B7Z4qIS21a
948620149980061696 2018-01-03 18:20:42 UTC <whatifisaidit> You know as a woman, I have been extremely shocked with the silence of Republican women in Congress, given all that has happened in 2017. It has been like they were waiting for permission to speak. Well, it's now 2018... permission granted!
948618557033713666 2018-01-03 18:14:23 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RepSwalwell And we will be working extremely hard to achieve just that.
948617287392808960 2018-01-03 18:09:20 UTC <whatifisaidit> @granisnark12 They should thank the black people for the birth of their ignorant azzes.
948615890131701762 2018-01-03 18:03:47 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RawStory Hmm.... rats do eat their young.
948613213574324224 2018-01-03 17:53:09 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill Is 2018 DUMP TRUMP year for all of his buddies?
948609598390521856 2018-01-03 17:38:47 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder It's Mueller Time! How do they get from under this one?
948608723521597440 2018-01-03 17:35:18 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder What's so amazing is that the FBI had someone in that organization. So they were well aware of exactly what was going on.
948605403566309377 2018-01-03 17:22:07 UTC <whatifisaidit> @jbied Bannon reminds me of a person actually witnessing an awful crime take place right in front him and not speaking up or doing anything about it until his azz is on the line in a similar circumstance.
948602422355746816 2018-01-03 17:10:16 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder It's gone far beyond shame at this point my friend. If for any given reason this quack of a president should attempt nuclear war and get a bunch of ppl killed, you probably won't be able to find the word for what it is in the dictionary.
948600599901286400 2018-01-03 17:03:01 UTC <whatifisaidit> @CillizzaCNN @CNN The question is: WHY is right.... right now, when he was part of the problem until he was dismissed. WHAT does he want?
948597639129583619 2018-01-03 16:51:15 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TearsInHeaven09 @annepearl1 That he did. But his eyes were pleading. I mean begging, literally.
948596228660527105 2018-01-03 16:45:39 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TearsInHeaven09 I believe differently. I believe that Obama knew just how high the stakes were if Trump won the election and exactly what we would be up against. I was at a rally and the look in his eyes were begging the American ppl to think this s..t through.
948595329699602439 2018-01-03 16:42:05 UTC <whatifisaidit> @YahooNews @KenSpurbeck Amen to that.
948593434763415554 2018-01-03 16:34:33 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill We, the American ppl accept WHATEVER Mueller's findings are! But the one thing that we will never accept is for him to be fired and the Republicans, to give us THEIR take on the matter.
948592481565839365 2018-01-03 16:30:46 UTC <whatifisaidit> @robreiner 
948590621748531200 2018-01-03 16:23:22 UTC <whatifisaidit> Obama went to the leaders to tell them what was happening. Both McConnell and Ryan refused to alert the American ppl. Fusion GPS says that they don't have anything to hide. They say #ReleaseTheTranscripts. They say let America read it. We say the same. #ComplicitGOP
948588915665129472 2018-01-03 16:16:36 UTC <whatifisaidit> @SpeakerRyan @funder Darn right! #ReleaseTheTranscripts. They now know, that we know, that they have been feeding the American ppl a bunch of . They and #fakenews Fox are guilty. And we know that they are doing it purposefully. Behind closed doors. Really?
948586587121647616 2018-01-03 16:07:20 UTC <whatifisaidit> @politicususa I guess America will have to sit and wait until Trump blows a head gasket, then the cowardice, complicit GOP, MIGHT act.
948583991040528384 2018-01-03 15:57:01 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TheRickyDavila Since Bannon realizes that the majority of Americans are against White Nationalist ideas, he's just changing up a little so that it sounds better........ he's still the same. He's treasonous too.
948580452440387584 2018-01-03 15:42:58 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder I personally am tired of the GOP and Trump aides holding Trump's hand, showering him with compliments of achievements that he don't deserve simply because he might fall apart if he's not complimented. Darn it, tell the big baby the truth!
948551310344847361 2018-01-03 13:47:10 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Mrsmaxdewinter I recall watching the miners in tv, in a rally style event with Trump. He told them everything that they wanted to hear and some. They waved their flags and screamed against Hillary....... this is what they wanted right?
948549593847025665 2018-01-03 13:40:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> @HillaryClinton Every time I see that, I wanna cry. Trump, Putin and team made Hillary out to be some monster when in fact the very same thing that Trump said about her or what she'd do, he's doing 100 times more at lightening speed and the Republicans shield him and let him do it.
948429281180508161 2018-01-02 05:42:16 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder They can't be Americans. Brothers and sisters have died to protect the very thing they walk all over. Hypocrites like Trump who start a war over taking a knee and the 'flag.' Well what about the damn Constitution? So no, they're not. #ImpeachTrump
948426835360190464 2018-01-02 05:32:33 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TeaPainUSA They claim to have told the GOP what the GOP refuses to acknowledge.
948426363358404608 2018-01-02 05:30:40 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TeaPainUSA You're darn right they are. And everyday that goes by, there's more evidence that comes out to support it. #ReleaseTheTranscripts. Let us read for ourselves what they told the GOP behind closed doors.
948424834144448513 2018-01-02 05:24:35 UTC <whatifisaidit> Let's ask the GOP: what does Russia have on you? What do you know and when did you know it! ##CorruptGOP #ReleaseTheTranscripts #TrumpRussia #ImpeachTrump #TheResistance..... all of you need to resign.
948423294201548800 2018-01-02 05:18:28 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder @The_Borg_Queen_ Me too
948423147564556288 2018-01-02 05:17:53 UTC <whatifisaidit> @politico Lock Jared Kushner up. Lock Ivanka up...... and all the rest Trump's minions that used government servers for their darn emails!
948421522661756928 2018-01-02 05:11:26 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RawStory I probably watch to much cartoons. Even cartoons have more truth than Fox. I wish that the American ppl could push a button and delete Trump into another universe.
948420666713366530 2018-01-02 05:08:02 UTC <whatifisaidit> @wallisweaver Trophy? A high honor for them even.... regardless to what it implies. But they should be investigated.
948419313136033793 2018-01-02 05:02:39 UTC <whatifisaidit> @POTUS @EdMarkey @tedlieu Trump supporters, are you afraid yet? I didn't vote Trump and I am!
948418336030887936 2018-01-02 04:58:46 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder @The_Borg_Queen_ And of course, we take to the streets.
948418022108205061 2018-01-02 04:57:31 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder @The_Borg_Queen_ It's the only chance we have with a Trump Majority Oligarchy, while the GOP sits there and guards the gates of hell.
948416746930757632 2018-01-02 04:52:27 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder S....t, based on what we now know to be true about Congress knowingly and intentionally trying to sabatoge the #TrumpRussia investigation, purposes yet unknown, THEY should be impeached too! #ReleaseTheTranscripts #ImpeachTrump #TheResistance We'll see them at the ballot box!
948414291727867904 2018-01-02 04:42:42 UTC <whatifisaidit> Hillary said it best: "A man that you can bait with a tweet is not a man that you can trust with the nuclear codes." Those who chose to put this azz at the head of table should be shivering right now!  #The11thHour #ReleaseTheTranscripts #ImpeachTrump #TrumpRussia #TheResistance
948411941130776577 2018-01-02 04:33:22 UTC <whatifisaidit> The GOP are traitors to the United States of America. They should be the ones locked up, right along with Trump for not keeping the Oath to defend the Constitution and trying to sabotage investigations to find the truth about the attack on the ctry. #ReleaseTheTranscripts
948408493454888960 2018-01-02 04:19:40 UTC <whatifisaidit> @nytimes @mchovden1785 The raw nerve of him. He never served a day. And he talks like he's the big macho man because he has nuclear codes. This is not XBOX. This is real life. Trump is unfit for this great office.
948406299636764673 2018-01-02 04:10:57 UTC <whatifisaidit> @goldengateblond This makes us angry because they selectively choose to leak certain things, but many things that the firm talked about behind closed doors are the things that could put this baby to bed and almost to sleep, that they don't want us to know, and act as if things weren't disclosed.
948403955658362881 2018-01-02 04:01:38 UTC <whatifisaidit> It is frustrating to watch these fantastic people leave positions that they have filled for years with no replacements. Smart people. To hear Trump say that he and only he can fix it is scarier than a horror film because he doesn't know his own job. @Lawrence @TheLastWord
948400596071174145 2018-01-02 03:48:17 UTC <whatifisaidit> @krassenstein Today's Republicans (the new breed), don't have values and morals. Their objective is simple: to win at any means necessary and bring all baggage aboard.
948387107483127808 2018-01-02 02:54:41 UTC <whatifisaidit> The GOP were told specific things, that they refuse to act on and some are even starting this #fakenews Fox Russian propaganda to cloud the #TrumpRussia investigation and to try to discredit the FBI and others, KNOWINGLY! #ReleaseTheTranscripts #TheResistance
948385053234655232 2018-01-02 02:46:31 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ANTITRUMPMVMT Tell Trump to release his taxes. That's what he can do. No one is interested in his game playing, but Fox. #ReleaseTheTranscripts #ImpeachTrump #TheResistance
948383613078396928 2018-01-02 02:40:48 UTC <whatifisaidit> Hell no it's not normal. Which is worst, Trump or theses darn Republicans. We had foreign influences in our government and they want to cover it up? @maddow #ReleaseTheTranscripts
948382907705458689 2018-01-02 02:37:59 UTC <whatifisaidit> Grassley should #ReleaseTheTranscripts. The American people have a right to know.

948379811269005319 2018-01-02 02:25:41 UTC <whatifisaidit> The question is WHY and WHAT is it that they don't want the American people to know. This is our country for goodness sake. Everybody should be outraged. @maddow
948378447583248384 2018-01-02 02:20:16 UTC <whatifisaidit> @maddow @mchovden1785 Are you hearing this? They haven't subpoenaed Deutsche Bank....... money laundering!
948377221235867649 2018-01-02 02:15:24 UTC <whatifisaidit> WTH? They told the Investigators these things? Well if they were told this and the Republicans are PURPOSEFULLY protecting Trump! Release the transcripts. @maddow
948374830050697216 2018-01-02 02:05:54 UTC <whatifisaidit> Yes!!! @maddow, we missed you! Great to have you back.
948373770972037122 2018-01-02 02:01:41 UTC <whatifisaidit> It's OUR right to speak up and act. These are our lives that Trump is playing checkers with. And I don't know about anybody else, but nobody is a winner in a nuclear war and I don't freaking want one. Tape the idiot's fingers and if need be, his mouth! #inners
948371634590806016 2018-01-02 01:53:12 UTC <whatifisaidit> I can see, that if the Republicans continue to be stooges for Trump, instead of an equal branch, and doing their job, the bat crazy is going to start something with his button size, that America will regret for years to come. Where is the control here? #inners
948370473762676737 2018-01-02 01:48:35 UTC <whatifisaidit> Lol, how's that one for a racist Jew statement? Vote for the other guy. Jones.#inners
948369141072883713 2018-01-02 01:43:17 UTC <whatifisaidit> Oh my, I wouldn't be surprised if Trump started a  war that could excel to something very ugly with Iran too. That is so scary. He offends so many people. Geezus. #inners
948365806798241792 2018-01-02 01:30:02 UTC <whatifisaidit> Trump should be locked up for giving the Russians classified information like a darn Putin puppet. #inners
948363340308451328 2018-01-02 01:20:14 UTC <whatifisaidit> OMG. Someone needs to stop Trump. That sounds like a threat to me. His button works. Is he really this stupid? #inners
948354838483623937 2018-01-02 00:46:27 UTC <whatifisaidit> These coal mining deaths brought to you by Donald Trumphttps://m.dailykos.com/stories/1729230
948328270310838274 2018-01-02 23:00:53 UTC <whatifisaidit> In a perfect world, they shouldn't.

948316344327593984 2018-01-02 22:13:30 UTC <whatifisaidit> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @kurteichenwald Because he doesn't read. He waits for #fakenews  Fox to put it on the screen, whatever it is, and he runs with that. Even George W. read.
948311364174602242 2018-01-02 21:53:42 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill Good. We hope that all of the Republicans get on board the 'get out train.' #TheResistance #MAWA, Make America Well Again!

947858557990506497 2018-01-01 15:54:25 UTC <whatifisaidit> @realDonaldTrump @ColMorrisDavis And the citizens of the United States of America pay his lazy azz to golf everyday. What a joke, but the Republican Party is the butt of the entire joke.

947686683549622272 2017-12-31 04:31:27 UTC <whatifisaidit> @EdKrassen For Trump to do that would be an admission that they're darn good at what they do and he'll never give credit, where credit is due. Happy New Year FBI.... and the rest of the Intelligence Community.

Because someone works for Trump doesn't give them the authority to keep a so called black book on anybody. She has a superior attitude. Because she was in that WH did not give her that right. You read it the way U WANTED to.
941035291254706176 2017-12-13 20:01:11 UTC <whatifisaidit> @eugenegu @GigiOkay @cheeeeeeeri @typicalcircle 
941034283149545472 2017-12-13 19:57:11 UTC <whatifisaidit> @eugenegu @robinsonm0525 No, I said what I meant to say. Superior, meaning "higher ranking" is wayyyyy different than "upity." You need to check yourself!
941033121339838464 2017-12-13 19:52:34 UTC <whatifisaidit> @eugenegu @robinsonm0525 YOU used the term "upity."That would suggest to me that YOU might be a racist.
941032474284523520 2017-12-13 19:50:00 UTC <whatifisaidit> @eugenegu @robinsonm0525 Excuse me, but I happen to be bi-racial. And her attitude is of a "superior" nature. Example: when she told April Ryan that she kept a black book, it was suggestive, that because she was aide to the president that was okay.... it's not
941031671742238721 2017-12-13 19:46:48 UTC <whatifisaidit> @eugenegu @robinsonm0525 Nope, but I did attack her "attitude." As a matter my exact word was superior.

940702717974106112 2017-12-12 21:59:40 UTC <whatifisaidit> Alright, I have to go back to work. Just thought I'd take a few minutes to cheerlead! Here we go..... you can do this Alabama! C'mon. Give us a D.O.U.G..J.O.N.E.S...yea
940697613531271170 2017-12-12 21:39:23 UTC <whatifisaidit> @PressSec @JoeMyGod So the White House is bullying and threatening journalist now?  Because that's what it sounds like to us. Maybe not bodily, but a threat is a threat.
940696916127551493 2017-12-12 21:36:36 UTC <whatifisaidit> @3catsandme3 @TheTweetOfGod Ooook, Lawd!
940695918172663808 2017-12-12 21:32:38 UTC <whatifisaidit> @SenFeinstein 4 the good of the ctry & other countries, there should be a law against Trump having a twitter account, period! He's the president. It's clear that he doesn't understand what that means. He could start a war with 1 tweet. He uses it 2 demean and bully, no control. Take it away!
940672160103845888 2017-12-12 19:58:14 UTC <whatifisaidit> @KimCostello Expected.
940671541850923009 2017-12-12 19:55:47 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RawStory We think that we're pretty certain that Corker can guess how the tweet read. Joni Ernst on the other hand is just using this as an excuse. 2 say that she hasn't seen it, can't comment. But these women in the Repub Party could never represent us.They don't stand up 4 women.
940645384631865345 2017-12-12 18:11:50 UTC <whatifisaidit> Whoa!!!  WTH? We're up to 100 Democrats requesting Congressional probe on Trump's sexual misconduct!! @MSNBC  his tweet this morning didn't help.
940623342217949185 2017-12-12 16:44:15 UTC <whatifisaidit> @SusanPoe7 At work!Typo: difficult time. Bye!
940622549825794048 2017-12-12 16:41:06 UTC <whatifisaidit> @SusanPoe7 The reason that the Trump Admin and his press person are having such a difficult is because this is a democracy, not a dictatorship. And both Trump and #FireSarah are trying to dictate to us. But it ain't gonna happen here. #TheResistance
940619734688714753 2017-12-12 16:29:55 UTC <whatifisaidit> @SusanPoe7 What a big bag of shame! She just discusses us. She's so rude and "almighty." We have a right to the answers of the questions asked. And it is not the fault of the journalist if she can't provide the answers!
940618075556253697 2017-12-12 16:23:19 UTC <whatifisaidit> Well for some strange reason, the Republican women must have been warned to shut up and do as they're told. Their lips have been sealed. Why is that? @MSNBC
940615877556342784 2017-12-12 16:14:35 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TearsInHeaven09 @SethAbramson Who would make the move to get the court involved, because based on everything we see coming from the GOP, we aren't certain that they would finally make that call. And in the event that they didn't, wouldn't we need the court?
940611554319519749 2017-12-12 15:57:24 UTC <whatifisaidit> @tammel2465 @SenGillibrand Yes. Soooo much shame. I don't know this country that my family for 3 generations fought for, I just don't.
940608628863758336 2017-12-12 15:45:47 UTC <whatifisaidit> @CyrusToulabi Not surprising at all. We were stunned by the fact that #NoMoore speaks Russian better than he speaks English! It just upsets us that Putin's in Russia, controlling Amer elections, like pieces on a chess board.
940607409936130048 2017-12-12 15:40:56 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill Great move, great decision. If we don't know anything, we know this: Republicans will cheat and do everything that they can for a win. And with the crazy 2016 election, does anybody trust the voting system? We don't!
940604798293958656 2017-12-12 15:30:34 UTC <whatifisaidit> 70% of Americans want Congress to investigate these Trump claims? The GOP probably won't move on this issue, just like they refused to move on Trump's taxes. Trump can go as far as the GOP allow him. We need to start adding them right next to Trump, EVERY TIME!  @MSNBC. Guilty!
940586233448878080 2017-12-12 14:16:47 UTC <whatifisaidit> @angry_gram Seriously, TRUMP NEEDS HELP. I hope that the GOP pay for the rest of their life 4 what they're putting us through, when they have the power to stopthis! The whole world is in danger, and for what, tax cuts for the rich? How much more mucking money do they need???
940582974663397377 2017-12-12 14:03:51 UTC <whatifisaidit> @JuddLegum @breton_anne I haven't seen anything like this in my entire life. I walk around in disbelief. I can't believe it.
940581040543944704 2017-12-12 13:56:09 UTC <whatifisaidit> @breton_anne @JuddLegum When I heard him say that last night, I thought that I was going crazy, that maybe I didn't hear that right.
940579797113147393 2017-12-12 13:51:13 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ericgarland This is about the sickest tweet yet! I feel like I need to regurgitate. This is a United States of America president?  I am so disturbed. How did we fall so low?
940578063175311360 2017-12-12 13:44:20 UTC <whatifisaidit> I'm sorry not even #TheAdultDayCare is an appropriate place for Trump!  #ImpeachTrump ASAP!!!https://twitter.com/rawstory/status/940574579294179329
940576902154244096 2017-12-12 13:39:43 UTC <whatifisaidit> WOW!!! Trump is a sick man. I cannot believe that he posted that 'suggestive tweet' about a female Senator. ENOUGH!!!! Good grief. #MorningJoe
940554912332746752 2017-12-12 12:12:20 UTC <whatifisaidit> Last night's rally for #NoMoore reminded us of the racist Trump rallies. We guess that if #NoMoore wins, together Trump, Bannon, Moore, Sessions, and King will  be rapidly moving America towards a Make America White Again! #MorningJoe
940552147606876161 2017-12-12 12:01:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> When Trump was a candidate he lied his way through and his team did too. He needed 2b stopped right on the spot, and called out. They checked it later, but later was too late. Now it's a norm. #MorningJoe
940399866248859650 2017-12-11 01:56:14 UTC <whatifisaidit> Yeah, but while Trump was tweeting this morning, there was an attempted attack! #inners
940389219184373760 2017-12-11 01:13:56 UTC <whatifisaidit> Oh boy... Steve Bannon, Clarke, and #NoMoore, share the same platform? #inners

940346222510071808 2017-12-11 22:23:04 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RawStory This job is WAY, WAY,WAY, too big for her. She first should learn how to treat people. Nobody owes her anything! #FireSarah
940338715200839681 2017-12-11 21:53:15 UTC <whatifisaidit> @David4justice48 @funder We take aim at the fact that she assumes to try to give orders and she believes that she is doing us all a favor by her presence. I personally would like to say back the muck away from the people's podium with your lying bag of ! #FireSarah and #ImpeachTrump

940333678600826881 2017-12-11 21:33:14 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Shareblue We question it. Yes we do. He has done harm to the Christian witness and he should be ashamed of himself!
940328896301551617 2017-12-11 21:14:14 UTC <whatifisaidit> @leighanne_swift @Shareblue Wow, that's crazy. The FBI shouldn't have to warn the president what they're up against here. Tearing them down while they put their lives on the line to protect us?
940326296156082176 2017-12-11 21:03:54 UTC <whatifisaidit> People in our building say, please, don't confuse me with the Christians in Alabama, that want to vote for the pedophile. They say that their religion teaches them to care about the children, the widow, and the poor.
940324199691882497 2017-12-11 20:55:34 UTC <whatifisaidit> We question it: just because Alabama says that they're "Christians." It insults a lot of people.https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/940292102180581376

940309872914157568 2017-12-11 19:58:38 UTC <whatifisaidit> @BrendanNyhan All the more reason why the entire GOP should be investigated. Our government (the GOP) are complicit. Maybe not all of them, but one is too darn many!

940305271947169792 2017-12-11 19:40:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> Does Trump know that #NoMoore speaks Russian very fluently? @MSNBC
940303526290513921 2017-12-11 19:33:25 UTC <whatifisaidit> #FireSarah, "Do to the legality, I'm not going to go into it any further." ..... ok@MSNBC
940302727531450369 2017-12-11 19:30:14 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TearsInHeaven09 Ooh, she's angry.....
940302482881892353 2017-12-11 19:29:16 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TearsInHeaven09 Yeah and we are enjoying it!
940302085492527104 2017-12-11 19:27:41 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ezraklein Y'all had better wake up Alabama! What will the Republicans come up with next to approve? A pedophile is enough, but what's next? Out right RAPE? Because you know if one thing is allowed, another will be smooth sailing! #NoMoore. Maybe none of these have happened to you yet!
940298104556879872 2017-12-11 19:11:52 UTC <whatifisaidit> He would. Afraid that his own past is going to catch up with him. Guess what? It usually does! #ImpeachTrump #TrumpIsASexualPredator
940293840854028290 2017-12-11 18:54:56 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Reince @LindseyGrahamSC @SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @TheDemCoalition @jjenzo6 Um, huh. Then they had to have known if Trump asked Flynn that question.
940293235582304258 2017-12-11 18:52:31 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill This is our president teaching children how to bully and that it's ok to do it. We've all seen the awful video of little Keaton. When is the country going to say enough Trump? Really? He doesn't bring s**t to the table but chaos!
940291028791291905 2017-12-11 18:43:45 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TheDemCoalition I'd go a step further, based on what we see and read and the blanket provided to Trump by the GOP. If Trump did ask and we know that he talked to a few, what GOP knew if he asked? #TheResistance

940285777539424256 2017-12-11 18:22:53 UTC <whatifisaidit> @davidaxelrod Congress should be investigated, the GOP, specifically. It's not the will of the people and they are not upholding the Constitution. Need I add, as a matter of fact, they're derelict in duty, missing in freaking action!
940281878510219264 2017-12-11 18:07:24 UTC <whatifisaidit> I don't have a problem about the pro choice, pro life debate. But at least let the concern about children reflect your damn vote! Don't be half in, half out. You love BEFORE and AFTER birth or STFU! It is not ok to bring them into this world 2b abused! #MothersAgainstPedophiles
940278816093736960 2017-12-11 17:55:13 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RawStory Now that is SAD! Have children so that somebody like #NoMoore, of the REPUBLICAN  Party can come along one day, and molest your child? Oh and by the way, let's elect him to the Senate. These are some crazy azz ppl!
940273756718747649 2017-12-11 17:35:07 UTC <whatifisaidit> @bill_auclair Wow, a big blunder!
940272607089315841 2017-12-11 17:30:33 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill @ColleenBoykin1 Me too.
940271439923548160 2017-12-11 17:25:55 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Pajjr2016 @Trumpet1984 Trump is always caught in a lie. Of course he watches TV. Often times, he tweets out, right after the news go up on the screens and sometimes during.... he has to be watching to do that!
940270602165858304 2017-12-11 17:22:35 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MSNBC @wallisweaver Outside of the one on Mueller's team earlier on,that he let go, there's nothing there. We're pretty sure that Mueller can back everything that he's done and is doing by fact, evidence, and law. So they just don't want Trump investigated?
940267194981724161 2017-12-11 17:09:03 UTC <whatifisaidit> @AllResistNews @tribelaw What makes us so angry is that neither Trump or #NoMoore is fit 4 office. And when Trump says he needs  Moore's help with his agenda, well his agenda will hurt Alabama! So elect #NoMoore so that together, we can hurt you? That doesn't sound too good.
940265571765059584 2017-12-11 17:02:36 UTC <whatifisaidit> Keaton is my hero! I am so sad that he endured the bullying. He shouldn't have had to. Heads should roll at that school. Since Trump these bullies are becoming more nervy. Stay strong Keaton! This too, shall past. @MSNBC

940261852944191489 2017-12-11 16:47:49 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill That's right! Demand it. Trump's no different than any other sexual predator with the exception that he happens to be the president (I choke when saying it).
940260919371816960 2017-12-11 16:44:07 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RawStory They have the money. They could have checked before now. This is a bunch of BS.
940259939737620486 2017-12-11 16:40:13 UTC <whatifisaidit> @SafetyPinDaily We don't know what the figures are exactly. We just know Trump's history with Black people, all the way back to his father Fred and the Central Park 5. You didn't need to look any further than that. That was enough.
940258179174289409 2017-12-11 16:33:13 UTC <whatifisaidit> #NoMoore hasn't disappeared. He's simply avoiding any potential questions about his pedophilic instincts before the election.And with the news of him fluently speaking RUSSIAN, he darn sure wants to avoid that one. @MSNBC

940256157725286400 2017-12-11 16:25:11 UTC <whatifisaidit> @naretevduorp ...and true. Charges should be brought against the GOP for violating the United States Constitution and the oath that they took to uphold it.
940255242494586882 2017-12-11 16:21:33 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Salon It's not a birther blemish. These people choose to believe this foolishness because Obama is a black man. Those that believe it, are basically are racist anyway. Now they will argue that they aren't, but watch what they say and do!

940031684841324544 2017-12-10 01:33:13 UTC <whatifisaidit> Why does the Secretary of Alabama and others of Alabama always want to insert "Christian" in reference to #NoMoore? We don't see anything Christian in him and the way he thinks, in all that we've studied. What Bible is he referencing? Point me to where pedophilia is ok. @MSNBC
940029302648717314 2017-12-10 01:23:45 UTC <whatifisaidit> @rathnot143 @TeaPainUSA Well if kicking a pedophile out of office is considered a "tough decision," children don't rank high at all with Republicans. And in that case, whenever they insert children as driving factor to achieve something, we will all know it to be a lie, won't we?
940026717074284544 2017-12-10 01:13:28 UTC <whatifisaidit> @GreedyDalia Our thought is why there is such an urgency of now for Trump to go out on a limb for this Russian speaking pedophile given his own sexual predator issues. There is something more to it. #NoMoore

939880219913179136 2017-12-10 15:31:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> Does the GOP really believe that they can sit in a hearing and have the top of the FBI individually stab and attack one of their own in the back, along with them and Trump?

939865210814451713 2017-12-10 14:31:42 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MSNBC @IICrsii49 This is true. We do have the rule of law.

938498979725238272 2017-12-06 20:02:47 UTC <whatifisaidit> @prettyvegas777 We know that, but the Republicans use Bannon to get elected and when he  goes off the tracks, they want to distance themselves from him until the NEXT time. But they are joined like glue. They won't be able to have it both ways. It's great to be a Democrat! 
938495736290914304 2017-12-06 19:49:54 UTC <whatifisaidit> Wow, Steve Bannon attacks both Mitt Romney and McConnell.

937406896805433350 2017-12-03 19:43:15 UTC <whatifisaidit> @dcexaminer Yup. He's right! If we get out here and work our azzes off for what we want, not them, it'll be game over in 2018 and 2020. Let's put them in retirement. WE ARE TIRED, aren't we?
937405911064305664 2017-12-03 19:39:20 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill This sounds so damn stupid. But the coward didn't have the courage to forewarn the people before the vote.
937405108954058753 2017-12-03 19:36:08 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder We need a complete overhaul of the entire GOP in the House and the Senate. We're looking forward to that. We don't think much about anything else.They're never going to do right...so 2018 and 2020, is the start of a great future. #TheResistance

935336773462495238 2017-11-27 02:37:19 UTC <whatifisaidit> I am so sad that Cordray  is gone. I feel like they will have a field day with our lives now and the next time a financial crisis hits us, might be the big D. @maddow
935332854103461889 2017-11-27 02:21:44 UTC <whatifisaidit> I really like the way that stated that about Donald Trump. It does say a lot about who HE is. @SenWarren. @maddow
935331524001615872 2017-11-27 02:16:27 UTC <whatifisaidit> It's an abomination if the CFBP DOESN'T exist. Why do they want to hurt us Americans so damn bad? Power is this important to them, that they'd harm innocent ppl? It's sick! @maddow

935324224859922433 2017-11-27 01:47:27 UTC <whatifisaidit> @hegec4 @kylegriffin1 The GOP don't care. It took Obama and Warren, the best part of his first term to put this country back on solid ground. Obama is gone, the GOP are in control, and we are so very mucked!
935322410525581312 2017-11-27 01:40:14 UTC <whatifisaidit> OMG. They stopped payments to consumers? So I guess that we're going to be headed for another financial crisis. ARE YOU HAPPY CHICKEN S**T CONGRESS? What will it take? #inners

935311827843424256 2017-11-27 00:58:11 UTC <whatifisaidit> @realDonaldTrump @MrDanielavery @CelticWombat he should be able to understand that one. He doesn't need an education for it.

933727259839647746 2017-11-23 16:01:41 UTC <whatifisaidit> Trump's Thanksgiving message in the stolen President's seat should be: Thank you Obama for saving the United States of America, that I am now MUCKING UP!https://twitter.com/rawstory/status/933707042036113408

933709957295493120 2017-11-23 14:52:55 UTC <whatifisaidit> @BarackObama @eugenegu Yes. And that hurts deeply. They say that it'll be a job creator. It's a lie. The jobs are temporary and they only amount to roughly 3900. "SAD."
933709025925128192 2017-11-23 14:49:13 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RawStory No matter how many times Trump gets to use his position to attack Obama, it still will NEVER make a difference to anybody with just common sense. It is impossible for a man of Trump's IQ to compete on Obama's level!
933707195883155456 2017-11-23 14:41:57 UTC <whatifisaidit> @WilDonnelly That's one of our greatest fears. It takes a village to raise a child. The GOP since Trump wants to change the moral values that have been a part of who we're suppose to be. We don't need our youth men becoming men like these men have become. We want to raise stars!
933706015304019968 2017-11-23 14:37:16 UTC <whatifisaidit> Maybe Dean Young doesn't plan to talk about it, but it's something that you just don't sweep under a rug and carry on like it never happened. So we intend to talk about it everyday. #MothersAgainstPedophiles #NoMoore #MeAt14
933700797451382790 2017-11-23 14:16:32 UTC <whatifisaidit> OMG. Trump talks to troops from his Florida home. Reading it from his paper. "We're letting you win?" I'm done, my Thanksgiving was almost ruined. TV remote... Click off! @MSNBC

933684680578265088 2017-11-23 13:12:29 UTC <whatifisaidit> Trump thinks that he's "really smart," when he attacks people of color.

933502564691267584 2017-11-22 01:08:49 UTC <whatifisaidit> Trump said that "You have to listen to him also," speaking about #NoMoore's claims of innocence. Well, we did "listen to him also." We listened to Trump tell us everything he does to women and get away with and we believe him! #inners

933467461118251008 2017-11-22 22:49:20 UTC <whatifisaidit> There was so much negative #fakenews on social media about her.

933461188255666183 2017-11-22 22:24:24 UTC <whatifisaidit> @politicususa We personally wish that Facebook would shut down until after the 2018 and 2020 elections. Especially since the GOP haven't attempted to do anything about Russian voter tampering. #Fakenews, Russian propaganda. We don't want them installing another darn candidate!

933458419964620802 2017-11-22 22:13:24 UTC <whatifisaidit> @EricIndyv6 Amazing wasn't it, the amount of White Women supporters? The tee shirts said it all. I believe the women that came out against Trump. I was insulted when he suggested that one wasn't pretty enough.
933457626758828032 2017-11-22 22:10:15 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RawStory Right

933442939149266944 2017-11-22 21:11:53 UTC <whatifisaidit> @keithboykin We totally agree! We remember the Senate hearing with Anita Hill, they doubted her and confirmed Clarence Thomas anyway. They now look the other way, and before the election, with Trump. Something's wrong with this picture!
933437362734030849 2017-11-22 20:49:44 UTC <whatifisaidit> I ask because I don't understand who's an "evangelical" and who is not. What do they believe? Are the "NoMoore evangelicals the same as the #ImpeachTrump evangelicals? ... they voted for Trump. I assume that they'll vote for #NoMoore.https://twitter.com/whatifisaidit/status/933435793057644547
933435793057644547 2017-11-22 20:43:30 UTC <whatifisaidit> So, Trump supporters, basically view themselves as "evangelicals," who really might not be at all? .... and watch #fakenews Fox.

It takes a big man to admit that he did something wrong. It takes an even bigger man to apologize for the wrong that he committed.

930578358068539392 2017-11-14 23:29:04 UTC <whatifisaidit> Wow, Sessions on the record says he would recuse if Clinton is investigated. Here after Congressman Conyers' question, he sounds like he might be leading any investigation of her. Improper? #TheBeat

929148334815801345 2017-11-10 00:46:40 UTC <whatifisaidit> @tedlieu Yes. What does that mean?and like he said he usually  gets their mother's permission to date them. Does he even realize what he's saying?
929135233382912000 2017-11-10 23:54:36 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Kate_Is_Rising @sppeoples WHAT? So he did try to date under aged girls ...... with the permission of Mom of course. Pedophile!!! #NoMoore

929115407792984066 2017-11-10 22:35:50 UTC <whatifisaidit> After working in social work, I believe her %. The guest suggested that the women take a lie detector test.

929099680952307712 2017-11-10 21:33:20 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill I beg to differ. Many, very many, are NEVER reported or detected. And usually when we find out about it, it's too late. Most often with girls, they turn to drugs and prostitution. You would be surprised to know how much pedophilia exist inside a broken family!

928965721752731648 2017-11-10 12:41:02 UTC <whatifisaidit> Pedophilia strips a child of innocence, usually leading to a life of bad relationships, drugs, death, or all of the above. Often times we never hear of why a child has turned to these because many never make it back to a positive life.

927255628451581952 2017-11-05 19:25:44 UTC <whatifisaidit> I guess that you're right, but it so 'sad' when you say that we have to have SECURITY at church. Church of all places? @MSNBC
927253997416845313 2017-11-05 19:19:15 UTC <whatifisaidit> What is it with these people walking into churches, opening fire in Texas? @MSNBC Churches? Is it the mass amount of ppl that would b there?
927253446486609920 2017-11-05 19:17:03 UTC <whatifisaidit> We would consider, the American people, that any pardons of Flynn and anyone else is more than likely a BRIBE. It stinks of corruption.

927244443547308032 2017-11-05 18:41:17 UTC <whatifisaidit> Somebody must have Trump's phone or either reception is poor during all of this 'breaking news." NO TWEETS. #TheBeat

927222623905505281 2017-11-05 17:14:35 UTC <whatifisaidit> This is the second time that Trump has put this jacket on. It is very insulting to us.
927220729409654784 2017-11-05 17:07:03 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TheRickyDavila @ColleenBoykin1 I guess that they'll want to place all women who can give birth, on breeding farms, for the specific purpose.
927219723632246786 2017-11-05 17:03:03 UTC <whatifisaidit> That's THE PROBLEM. They want 2 give Sessions a chance 4 a right answer. But how is there a right answer, if one doesn't remember? He lied!https://twitter.com/cnnpolitics/status/927181797225623552

927202549710671872 2017-11-05 15:54:49 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder And Trump still hasn't done anything about those darn sanctions, to this day!
927201994837823488 2017-11-05 15:52:36 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder Well that pretty much sums it up. Our government is basically Russian.

927196395899162625 2017-11-05 15:30:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> I remember a time when if you were even suspected of going against your country, you would have been ostracized for life. #AMJOY
927194837656449026 2017-11-05 15:24:10 UTC <whatifisaidit> It's a GREAT question when you consider that everyone in Trump's circle had ties and some of the GOP took Russian money.https://twitter.com/noctilucentclou/status/927193812295995393
927193594603229185 2017-11-05 15:19:14 UTC <whatifisaidit> I am looking forward to the day when the White House and the hill has been bleached from Russians. We want an AMERICAN Government. #AMJOY
927192825019748353 2017-11-05 15:16:10 UTC <whatifisaidit> Maybe the Repubs will listen the next time a compelling letter comes to light about why someone like Sessions shouldn't b confirmed. #AMJOY
927191618486235136 2017-11-05 15:11:22 UTC <whatifisaidit> I thought I was only one that felt that everyone in the the Trump circle had ties to the Russians. #AMJOY

926948066866946049 2017-11-04 23:03:35 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill They should have welcomed DT (conspiracy theorist), with a life size birth certificate. He should be requested to show his. He acts Russian.
926946150443290624 2017-11-04 22:55:58 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill Agree. Both Repubs and Dems.

926924549060521987 2017-11-04 21:30:08 UTC <whatifisaidit> @AynRandPaulRyan Yes. And the people that came out to protest against Nixon, will look like a grain of salt in comparison.
926923942023041024 2017-11-04 21:27:43 UTC <whatifisaidit> @cj_disabledVet No, they were all in on it. One way or another.
926923034375671813 2017-11-04 21:24:07 UTC <whatifisaidit> @greeneyes7320 Yep. And those "fine people," are gonna get somebody else killed.

925540196216721414 2017-10-31 01:49:13 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RawStory He has no credibility with us. I can't say whether anybody else will listen, but I am done listening to Kelly.

925532656225447937 2017-10-31 01:19:15 UTC <whatifisaidit> @PoliticalSense1 We're the culprits bc we care abt what happened 2 our ctry? Bc it wasn't a bomb, but cyber, that makes it okay? Ctry has been good 2 her!

925504188553072641 2017-10-31 23:26:08 UTC <whatifisaidit> Well he can't pass on a religious test, simply because it's him and then work on a bill that would stop others if gets elected. Hypocrite.https://twitter.com/thinkprogress/status/925466259457748993
925502767271153665 2017-10-31 23:20:29 UTC <whatifisaidit> We don't know what you would call it.... your tweet speaks for itself.https://twitter.com/thinkprogress/status/925482532484861956
925489561446375424 2017-10-31 22:28:00 UTC <whatifisaidit> What are we waiting for? It should have been done b4 now. Remember 2018, 2020?https://twitter.com/politicususa/status/925413953777397760
925489106314022918 2017-10-31 22:26:12 UTC <whatifisaidit> Yeah, he's pretty darn ignorant.https://twitter.com/politicususa/status/925419532986003456
925488838235119621 2017-10-31 22:25:08 UTC <whatifisaidit> If Trump goes all on his own and start a war, what are Republicans going to say because they didn't think he'd do it? SORRY?https://twitter.com/politicususa/status/925428744541626368

925487518165979138 2017-10-31 22:19:53 UTC <whatifisaidit> Trump Disgraces Himself By Tweeting Instead Of Leading After New York Terror Attack. Just outright shameful.http://www.politicususa.com/2017/10/31/trump-disgraces-tweeting-leading-york-terror-attack.html
925485455382122496 2017-10-31 22:11:41 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RawStory Hell yeah, they will. Our country was attacked fool. The Republicans treat it like nothing. We want the Conspirators against the US 2 pay!!
925483823831441409 2017-10-31 22:05:12 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Arctic__char @essenviews OH NO.... of course not.
925482791793577985 2017-10-31 22:01:06 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ViewFromWise @omarvaid You took the words right out of my mouth.
925480934618562560 2017-10-31 21:53:44 UTC <whatifisaidit> @rjsmith169 I was extremely hurt, personally by Kelly's words. The military had been life 4 all of my life. I never thought that I'd hear HIM say that.
925480149524647936 2017-10-31 21:50:36 UTC <whatifisaidit> @tedlieu Ours too.
925479801296687104 2017-10-31 21:49:13 UTC <whatifisaidit> @DumondVince @rhondarealtor But he still can be arrested if he goes the term, right? I mean he's not above the law, like he chooses to believe.
925478183641731072 2017-10-31 21:42:48 UTC <whatifisaidit> @USATODAY They both performed the same kind of attack. The outcome was the same, death. We wish he had weighed in on that 1 too!
925477414196695040 2017-10-31 21:39:44 UTC <whatifisaidit> @USATODAY As a president he should weigh N. The attack in Charlottesville was also a terroist attack.1 Middle Eastern, the other, Supremacist.
925468994043305985 2017-10-31 21:06:17 UTC <whatifisaidit> @tedlieu Amer needs some serious help. These people don't believe in facts, it's like they never went to school, and they don't know what time it is.
925468263273910272 2017-10-31 21:03:22 UTC <whatifisaidit> @michellegrace54 @TomDanTheRock Lordy, death for Trump?
925467813602582531 2017-10-31 21:01:35 UTC <whatifisaidit> @emptywheel @PoliticalSense1 Oh yeah Sessions, his Supervisor.
925467204333817859 2017-10-31 20:59:10 UTC <whatifisaidit> Six people are dead after the truck slammed into the bicyclists in NY. It's a sad day in America. @MSNBC
925466447295500289 2017-10-31 20:56:10 UTC <whatifisaidit> @YahooNews @KenSpurbeck Fox will still be looking stupid at the end of the day when more indictments go out and people actually, after trial, are sentenced.
925465279769038848 2017-10-31 20:51:31 UTC <whatifisaidit> @cj_disabledVet @JaredMay76 How disgraceful and stupid she looks standing at the People's Podium.
925464842902925314 2017-10-31 20:49:47 UTC <whatifisaidit> @cj_disabledVet @PhoenixEamon True for his base. Most of them are Nazis, Supremacist, or KKK. They don't care.
925464197936418817 2017-10-31 20:47:13 UTC <whatifisaidit> @DerekCressman @Stewart_Pidd That is a good question. Nothing better to do with their time & money. However much time they have left and it ain't a lot!
925462414635732993 2017-10-31 20:40:08 UTC <whatifisaidit> @DerekCressman @CindibiseniusOr Yeeessssss
925462175304617984 2017-10-31 20:39:11 UTC <whatifisaidit> @zhonne @john_sipher Because they already knew that they were doing wrong. They just didn't expect that anybody would catch on to what they had done or how.
925461114347024390 2017-10-31 20:34:58 UTC <whatifisaidit> @DerekCressman Anybody with any sense would have 2 wonder why 2 old ancient rich white men won't go on with THEIR lives & stop trying to control the world.
925446528315125760 2017-10-31 19:37:00 UTC <whatifisaidit> @DumondVince Well we wish he'd go. WTH is he waiting for?
925445906165616640 2017-10-31 19:34:32 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill @bknight53 IDK. Everything they touch is Russian or Russian affiliated.
925445335211761664 2017-10-31 19:32:16 UTC <whatifisaidit> @zhonne @tonyposnanski I don't know how somebody in chains can have a platform for a conversation. A platform to be sold to the highest bidder!
925443752323436544 2017-10-31 19:25:59 UTC <whatifisaidit> @EricIndyv6 I watch the cartoons.
925443479781695488 2017-10-31 19:24:54 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ladiesgun And argue to the death about a lie.
925441190459187200 2017-10-31 19:15:48 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill Trump, his cabinet, and a lot of the GOP, nothing but Russian, Russian, Russian, Russian. I am so sick of that darn word. This is the USA!
925439036105379846 2017-10-31 19:07:14 UTC <whatifisaidit> @EricIndyv6 Irreparable damage.
925437785682644993 2017-10-31 19:02:16 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Mildredjeanros2 @bessbell Exactly. What about the soldiers killed in Niger, recently, on Trump's watch?
925437127445372930 2017-10-31 18:59:39 UTC <whatifisaidit> @JoyAnnReid Oh my. That web is getting bigger and catching a bunch of flies.

925432351726940161 2017-10-31 18:40:41 UTC <whatifisaidit> @EricIndyv6 Trump voters answer: Yes, and before the week is over, Hillary will be in handcuffs.

925414067279409152 2017-10-31 17:28:01 UTC <whatifisaidit> One of the things the Dems will have to work on for us, is getting rid of Citizens United, especially since Mercer likes to BUY people!https://twitter.com/marklungariello/status/925380083514306560

925409922413744129 2017-10-31 17:11:33 UTC <whatifisaidit> @greeneyes7320 Me too.
925409429486436352 2017-10-31 17:09:35 UTC <whatifisaidit> @dailykos We don't think that the GOP will bat an eye.The Supreme Court wrote a letter about a decision made by Gorsuch, McConnell wasn't interested.
925407999824408576 2017-10-31 17:03:55 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MJ_Mouton To think that he had a seat at the National Security Advisory meeting. WTH?
925407054017236992 2017-10-31 17:00:09 UTC <whatifisaidit> @cj_disabledVet @themanito Casualties of lying?
925406052618768384 2017-10-31 16:56:10 UTC <whatifisaidit> @cj_disabledVet @themanito Probably not the staffers, but definitely the family. Trump is a user. After he gets what he wants, he has no use for anybody else.
925405249820651520 2017-10-31 16:52:59 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TheDemCoalition @laurenvpass Exactly. Now we know who they really are. Moore hasn't even won yet.
925404690745044992 2017-10-31 16:50:46 UTC <whatifisaidit> @kylegriffin1 Or maybe Kelly took us all by surprise and that is just who he really is.
925403927213993984 2017-10-31 16:47:44 UTC <whatifisaidit> @TheTweetwit Well you know that's to be expected from them. They always have memory loss when hits them in the face.

925395537129504769 2017-10-31 16:14:23 UTC <whatifisaidit> @JoyAnnReid So true! People should not assume differently than what they see and hear. Hell that's why we have eyes and ears. Believe it.
925394842334658560 2017-10-31 16:11:38 UTC <whatifisaidit> @SethAbramson @MorelockPhylis @RobertInSC Lordy, we think that there just might be.
925393712372486144 2017-10-31 16:07:08 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MrDanielavery @jmartNYT They gladly welcomed Bannon. Why should he be any different? Birds of the feather flock together.
925393036779155456 2017-10-31 16:04:27 UTC <whatifisaidit> With people like Bannon, Trump, King, Sessions, Moore, Kelly... we see  plantations going up. The fight all over again!https://twitter.com/thinkprogress/status/925384389512564737

925387604593389569 2017-10-31 15:42:52 UTC <whatifisaidit> Ya think? Conspiracy against your very own country? Yeah, it's that bad.https://twitter.com/politicususa/status/925132681649594369
925387242633400321 2017-10-31 15:41:26 UTC <whatifisaidit> We shouldn't have to worry as citizens about this , if the GOP would just do their darn jobs.https://twitter.com/politicususa/status/925148786237767682
925386788876771328 2017-10-31 15:39:37 UTC <whatifisaidit> They are bigger fools than we even give them credit for if they allow ding ding to have unmeasured powers of this kind.https://twitter.com/politicususa/status/925154330486992896

925377293958242311 2017-10-31 15:01:54 UTC <whatifisaidit> Just like the GOP confirmed Trump's corrupt cabinet, so will they confirm lifetime seats that will have an adverse effect 4 years 2 come.https://twitter.com/huffpostpol/status/925364519718834177

920103017105457152 2017-10-16 01:43:48 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MaggieJordanACN @MrDanielavery I think so. I talked to some people there and they could see nothing wrong with Trump, nothing.
920102108334084098 2017-10-16 01:40:11 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MrDanielavery @MaggieJordanACN No one wants it, but I guess it's fitting that they go first, since to them, he's doing such a "great job."

919282634060107776 2017-10-14 19:23:54 UTC <whatifisaidit> Oh my, we've got more evacuations in California. 
919277831263326210 2017-10-14 19:04:48 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder That was exactly 1 of my points & since he's been given a card 2 abuse his powers, we should b focusing on 2018,2020. #VoteTheGOPOut!
919268025534214144 2017-10-14 18:25:51 UTC <whatifisaidit> @JoyAnnReid @Texasblaze69 And so I say that because we R close to 2018. We should be asking of ourselves everyday what we can do to hit that goal?  Then do it.
919265637578534914 2017-10-14 18:16:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> @JoyAnnReid @Texasblaze69 Oh never stop fighting, but for 2018, 2020. The things we can shape. Trump is a lost cause,but our concentration needs to be on 2018, 2020.
919264514255749120 2017-10-14 18:11:53 UTC <whatifisaidit> @JoyAnnReid @Texasblaze69 Agree, but we don't have control, the GOP don't care and he's still doing it.
919263618318983168 2017-10-14 18:08:20 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Texasblaze69 @JoyAnnReid Maybe, we should stop growing grey hairs over the uncontrollable unfit nut & just left him muck up everything. We'll have to fix it anyway.
919260856579477504 2017-10-14 17:57:21 UTC <whatifisaidit> Exactly who is it in the GOP, that the Koch brothers don't own?https://twitter.com/mcclatchydc/status/918959531677253632
919257531557597185 2017-10-14 17:44:09 UTC <whatifisaidit> @79Simon @JoyAnnReid All that's missing is their desks in the WH.
919257197875310597 2017-10-14 17:42:49 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ericgarland Um...that probably surprised them.
919256368699330560 2017-10-14 17:39:31 UTC <whatifisaidit> Republican failure 2 admit, openly ignore, dismissively act on, sounds to us that they welcome it happening again in hopes to benefit AGAIN.https://twitter.com/usatoday/status/919240143806050305

919248600026304512 2017-10-14 17:08:39 UTC <whatifisaidit> But we're under the impression that the Republicans want to wait until the start of an Armageddon.https://twitter.com/rawstory/status/919221182569861120

919234198975676419 2017-10-14 16:11:26 UTC <whatifisaidit> @dcexaminer @greg_fann Agree. They need all experts in the Medical organization( docs, hospital, etc.) Daddy, yes! It's hard to be your own man if a man owns you!
919232327036887040 2017-10-14 16:03:59 UTC <whatifisaidit> @dcexaminer @greg_fann I agree, but that simply won't be achieved until Repubs shed themselves of Daddy & BOTH sides can come to the table 4 the good of the ctry.
919231643231178752 2017-10-14 16:01:16 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ViewFromWise @naretevduorp Well we already know the solution to Trump's and Sessions' problem: Privatize and build more prisons.
919230797219024897 2017-10-14 15:57:55 UTC <whatifisaidit> @dcexaminer @greg_fann We could have, definitely should have, but the answer should never have been to simply kill it.
919230105288937474 2017-10-14 15:55:10 UTC <whatifisaidit> @DisTrumpia @rhonda_harbison Neither Moore or his son have respect 4 the rule of law or the flag. Every time they should've have paid 4 bad behavior, they got a tap.

919228734271623172 2017-10-14 15:49:43 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ClareGibert That is exactly what should happen!
919228527098105857 2017-10-14 15:48:53 UTC <whatifisaidit> @nytimes There's a difference.pres O couldn't get help frm the obstructionist McConnell 2 move pos legislation. His pen was used 4 Amer relief.
919227248930119689 2017-10-14 15:43:49 UTC <whatifisaidit> @dcexaminer Yes it did. Many people were able to get sleep at night. Yes it did.
919226829352947712 2017-10-14 15:42:09 UTC <whatifisaidit> Every time these Charlottesville leaders pull stunts like these, they should be sued. Death and injuries is inciting violence. #AMJOY
919221712067203073 2017-10-14 15:21:49 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RevDrBarber @funder They never should've been allowed 2 begin with. What it said was that everything that we were taught was a lie. I refuse to believe that.
919219587102756865 2017-10-14 15:13:22 UTC <whatifisaidit> @DanMartinTalks @Shareblue Um.... now they speak. They knew that this crazy narcissistic man was going to do something like this, and NO one spoke up.
919218322473934848 2017-10-14 15:08:20 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RevDrBarber We really do. Trump has challenged the values that have been represented by America for years. The world no longer knows American values.
919216203024957440 2017-10-14 14:59:55 UTC <whatifisaidit> @realDonaldTrump @jenniferinidaho @Elviraafterthot They R already the next ones.It just hasn't been felt yet.Right now they're with him on everything not understanding that it INCLUDES them.
919214810348359680 2017-10-14 14:54:23 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill Yup, he is. But all of this will come back to bite both the Republican Party and Trump on the azz. Just watch, pull up a chair!
919212663170838528 2017-10-14 14:45:51 UTC <whatifisaidit> @DisTrumpia According to the map on @MSNBC  last night it is like hurricane that will sweep the South, extremely hard. Millions of Trump voters b hit.
919211843306082304 2017-10-14 14:42:36 UTC <whatifisaidit> @GOP @thehill @ColleenBoykin1 They should worry. It is now officially #TrumpCare and they own it.
919207837821292545 2017-10-14 14:26:41 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Salon He wants a 'WHITE ONLY' AMERICA. It's no secret. Everyone that's not WHITE is inferior to him and his followers.

918644477404831744 2017-10-12 01:08:05 UTC <whatifisaidit> @SpeakerRyan @funder Yes. #NunesMustGo is not even trying to hide it. He's doing it right out in the open and flicking his finger at us as he does it.
918642870063648768 2017-10-12 01:01:42 UTC <whatifisaidit> @Lyve_Wire @kylegriffin1 @protesting2016 He's one for talk. He talked about Hillary's stamina. It's his memory that I'm worried about.
918641504662548480 2017-10-12 00:56:16 UTC <whatifisaidit> @zhonne @funder Nope. And he never did. They're just his props.
918640902431703040 2017-10-12 00:53:53 UTC <whatifisaidit> Absolutely, he loves Trump that much!https://twitter.com/kailijoy/status/918471307519582211
918640167660998657 2017-10-12 00:50:58 UTC <whatifisaidit> But please.... don't answer with #alternative facts, when he, if he, gives an answer.https://twitter.com/shareblue/status/918585076077785088

918637274836996097 2017-10-12 00:39:28 UTC <whatifisaidit> @EricBoehlert @Shareblue It's because Trump is dictator. It's not do as I do, it's do as I say.
918635766112190465 2017-10-12 00:33:28 UTC <whatifisaidit> What prompted the threat 2?Puerto Rico? Maybe the fact that the mayor is a female or that the people R brown. Maybe DT doesn't give a damn.
918634246062968832 2017-10-12 00:27:26 UTC <whatifisaidit> I can't begin to imagine how someone and more importantly a President could make such a threat. If he doesn't care about them, what are we?
918633052221444098 2017-10-12 00:22:41 UTC <whatifisaidit> We don't know what the Congress has seen, but we are with Maxine Waters. There certainly is enough, we believe to #ImpeachTrump #inners
918601581632868353 2017-10-12 22:17:38 UTC <whatifisaidit> @rathnot143 @tedlieu The words that hit me the most are "EVERY, " not once in awhile, and "CONTAINED." Does he need a straight jacket?
918599353593417728 2017-10-12 22:08:47 UTC <whatifisaidit> @guitboxgeek Only if they're #alternativefacts.

918595311773372416 2017-10-12 21:52:43 UTC <whatifisaidit> @funder Sessions should be the first one to RT.
918590661435297793 2017-10-12 21:34:14 UTC <whatifisaidit> @mzgreen66 Maybe the stupid GOP will be ready to #ImpeachTrump AFTER he tanks the economy.
918589986341052416 2017-10-12 21:31:33 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill Apparently the GOP haven't read the Constitution as they  continually refuse to deliver on their duty.

915584788408541185 2017-10-04 14:29:58 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MSNBC But we do expect that Tillerson will take a hit for having the courage to say it. Something that the Repub Party's bag seem 2b empty of.

909567260313911296 2017-09-17 23:58:28 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RawStory The GOP refuses to listen to experts in the field. They keep playing games with our country, our children, and our democracy.

909559586818084864 2017-09-17 23:27:58 UTC <whatifisaidit> @HuffPost @Texasblaze69 I do however believe that the election of Trump gave them the courage to come out. Now we're seeing exactly who they are.

889306291667181568 2017-07-23 02:08:37 UTC <whatifisaidit> @datdat39 @BuzzFeedNews Trump is being investigated. We really don't know how much he's worth, but with the help of the Repubs, if wasn't worth much, he will be.

889299559247228929 2017-07-23 01:41:51 UTC <whatifisaidit> @dailykos The kicker: he'd save his base and be seen as "GOD." The GOP could possibly be saddled with him longer than desired, and they'd lose 2018.
889298341833699329 2017-07-23 01:37:01 UTC <whatifisaidit> @dailykos It would stand to reason that he would, probably should. If the dysfunctional Republicans could ever stop fighting and start legislating.

878646217491845120 2017-06-24 16:09:17 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill I thought that I'd heard everything.The GOP wants people who aren't insured (penalized) 4 not paying 4 insurance that they're taking away?
878644061359439872 2017-06-24 16:00:43 UTC <whatifisaidit> @politicususa He has forgotten that he said he was going to let the ACA die out since it was dead anyway?Short memory. And so he and the GOP stop payment?

878435919690440706 2017-06-23 02:13:38 UTC <whatifisaidit> Is he worried about the country or #TrumpRussia? @Lawrence @TheLastWordhttps://twitter.com/whatifisaidit/status/878435314510987264
878435314510987264 2017-06-23 02:11:14 UTC <whatifisaidit> Isn't that some BS. Trump holds a conference call on Russia every morning about 6:00am, but don't take his briefs. @AriMelber

878406684108095488 2017-06-23 00:17:28 UTC <whatifisaidit> Yep, Republicans have a lot of explaining to do with this bill.And we don't know how they plan to overcome that one.

873147098971197440 2017-06-09 11:57:45 UTC <whatifisaidit> I don't think Comey should have given his memos 2 the committee at all. Trump sympathizers. They may have disappeared. They can't b trusted.

873011695379152896 2017-06-08 02:59:42 UTC <whatifisaidit> @RawStory Brainwashed minds. Stare into the tv and read Trump's tweets: #fakenews ...soon they believe it.
873009850913107968 2017-06-08 02:52:22 UTC <whatifisaidit> @sjredmond That might be true, but I kicked 2 family members out of my house that voted Trump. I'm ok now,but 4 awhile...

873006750915592192 2017-06-08 02:40:03 UTC <whatifisaidit> The problem for Trump is that he's a liar. And liars forget the last lie told, then they use ignorance. @Lawrence @TheLastWord
873006092908974080 2017-06-08 02:37:26 UTC <whatifisaidit> Donald Trump likes 2 turn his ignorance on &off. Which way it works 4 the day. Now he is ignorant, but not totally. He is a manipulator

871877281223933953 2017-06-05 23:51:57 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill What about MORE for Russia, given the news of the day.
871876528673619972 2017-06-05 23:48:57 UTC <whatifisaidit> @hegec4 @Independent This is the 1 thing that scares me 2 death. I fear that the information would b inaccurate & I believe he would blame innocent ppl. Chaos.
871874702318460932 2017-06-05 23:41:42 UTC <whatifisaidit> @zhonne @TeaPainUSA That's right. He did, didn't he!
871872279080251396 2017-06-05 23:32:04 UTC <whatifisaidit> @JoyAnnReid People say Muslim, white racist assume terrorist. People say Black, they assume thugs or worst.And a lot of it is initiated by politicians.
871871549539799040 2017-06-05 23:29:10 UTC <whatifisaidit> @JoyAnnReid This is true. We hardly ever hear from Muslims. It is wrong to form the opinions that ppl have of them, having never talked to them.

871867205369180163 2017-06-05 23:11:54 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ViewFromWise @prairiewindc We believe that he should resign. Given the hatred in this country already, by some crazies, this is the last thing we need. #TheResistance
871866271524106240 2017-06-05 23:08:12 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ViewFromWise @HawaiiShira I think so, because some nutcake will try and then say that they were told to do it.....and they were.
871865626436009989 2017-06-05 23:05:38 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ViewFromWise @prairiewindc And there are just enough crazies out there to take him up on what he said.
871864859029385216 2017-06-05 23:02:35 UTC <whatifisaidit> @deebrief In that case maybe if we told him that he was doing a fantastic job and we want him to stay....He'd leave? Well that's my wishful thought.
871863685500817408 2017-06-05 22:57:55 UTC <whatifisaidit> @busted_halo @CaffeineAndHate That they do my friend.

871862648392085505 2017-06-05 22:53:48 UTC <whatifisaidit> @ViewFromWise @riggsbeem But I don't believe that all are this way. I do believe that the ones that are this way are so craved, that it's overwhelming.

870992714413871104 2017-06-03 13:17:00 UTC <whatifisaidit> @cj_disabledVet Most of the intelligence community R career. They have put their lives on the line for this ctry. They're serious about what they do.

870964641719037952 2017-06-03 11:25:26 UTC <whatifisaidit> It would appear that any attempt to interfere with Comey's testimony will be looked upon as a clear indication of guilt.
870963656363823104 2017-06-03 11:21:32 UTC <whatifisaidit> We now know fr Comey's past testimony under oath, Trump & his Admin. R being looked at under collusion Trump shouldn't b allowed 2 stop it.

870804223310647297 2017-06-02 00:48:00 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MrDanielavery And yet these Republicans keep kicking their ass to the curb. And they still love to be kicked.
870803661932417024 2017-06-02 00:45:46 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MrDanielavery Just like ACA. Obama tried 2 give them something they needed. Hell, he didn't need it. Repubs want 2 take it away. Town halls are flooded 
870802709955346432 2017-06-02 00:41:59 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MrDanielavery True! That hate 4 no reason. They wait 4 someone to start the smoke and they fan the flame. Totally ignorant.We always have to do clean up.

870799751234584577 2017-06-02 00:30:14 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MrDanielavery Mostly everything that the low life Trumpsters want 2 destroy DIRECTLY benefit them,they need it N some way. So what the hell do they want?
870798366124453889 2017-06-02 00:24:43 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill About time.

870796639388266496 2017-06-02 00:17:52 UTC <whatifisaidit> Didn't Trump open that door by talking about it himself in tv? #inners So isn't his executive privilege gone?
870745818659254272 2017-06-02 20:55:55 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MSNBC @OregonLucky13 We don't even know why they have them to begin with. No questions get answered. Spicer ran away the other day!
870700466237132802 2017-06-02 17:55:42 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MrDanielavery Personally, I think that he played a great role in the leaks. And I think that it was done on purpose. A reminder, who got him there.
870699399034183680 2017-06-02 17:51:28 UTC <whatifisaidit> @thehill That he is. And the amount of love that continuously pours for Obama still even today, drives him out of his freaking mind.

870639750641799170 2017-06-02 13:54:26 UTC <whatifisaidit> @MrDanielavery Trump really didn't want this job, but he's a racist and he figured if a black man could do it, how difficult could it be.
870639359615258625 2017-06-02 13:52:53 UTC <whatifisaidit> Because Trump doesn't understand......he has no clue whatsoever about what he just did to the world. We need a PRESIDENT! #impeachtrumphttps://twitter.com/whatifisaidit/status/870638780998397952

866306890678112256 2017-05-21 14:57:12 UTC <whatifisaidit> It is wrong to demonize the Muslim religion. Look at the so called Christians here, threatening  lynchings, specifically a US Congressman
866304048282165248 2017-05-21 14:45:54 UTC <whatifisaidit> @JoyAnnReid Because he's a fake, trying to be a president, that is why.
866303824327323648 2017-05-21 14:45:01 UTC <whatifisaidit> Well he just offended the Muslim world with that 95% figure of terror committed by Muslim. That's a heavy lift. @MSNBC

866302450873098240 2017-05-21 14:39:34 UTC <whatifisaidit> Banning Muslims from coming to America is the extension of Trump's hand. Spreading hate all over the world is other extension. @MSNBC
