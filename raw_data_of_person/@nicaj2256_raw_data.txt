969665377495126016 2018-03-02 20:06:56 UTC <nicaj2256> @DolfansNYC On ESPN the so called experts says no one will give him that because he is a slot receiver and Polian said no team is gonna sign him to that money and give up draft picks!! Not the ones that have holes in their receiver corp.
969662815844921344 2018-03-02 19:56:45 UTC <nicaj2256> @EricElizondo8 So were Reshad Jones best seasons, should we trade him too!!??

968885385525911557 2018-02-28 16:27:31 UTC <nicaj2256> @AbramsonFL Tanne is better then Siemian!! That dude is not very good and its not an athletic QB! We rolling with Tanne all day!!
967561979681492992 2018-02-24 00:48:47 UTC <nicaj2256> @AbramsonFL The Green Mile he was the bad person but than changed at the end!!
966871474211565568 2018-02-22 03:04:57 UTC <nicaj2256> @AbramsonFL Cowards come in all shapes and colors!!
966870051612778496 2018-02-22 02:59:18 UTC <nicaj2256> @AbramsonFL Went to one and they still got gones inside!! You have to control the doors or in PE they snuk it in!!
966521283054841857 2018-02-21 03:53:25 UTC <nicaj2256> So the only way to stop them is to have a semi automatic weapon!! A handgun can stop that no need for a semi automatic weapon or a weapon of war!!

966160639470292992 2018-02-20 04:00:21 UTC <nicaj2256> @AdamHBeasley Can we celebrate for a minute!! Can wee??
965822993787162624 2018-02-19 05:38:40 UTC <nicaj2256> @TomGarfinkel Should be a free season ticket holder for life!!
965820012257738752 2018-02-19 05:26:49 UTC <nicaj2256> @AbramsonFL Nicaragua is the same!! You dont have to go to far east or  European countries!! Nicaragua when you buy a hand gun or shotgun because assault rifles are band the gun store can give to you before you to a very long list of requirements that include a physc evaluation!!!
965409113063686144 2018-02-18 02:14:03 UTC <nicaj2256> @AbramsonFL You dont remember the Magic Johnson all star game when he called over MJ to guard him!!
965078722876461056 2018-02-17 04:21:12 UTC <nicaj2256> @MichaelRyanRuiz I would like to if his a vampire!!
965077703689940993 2018-02-17 04:17:09 UTC <nicaj2256> @EricElizondo8 Not sure but I think it was before the start of the season!! He had to do community service to get the charges dropped! To me this guy in Miami will be tough on him on maturity issues!! I like Lamar better his from down here or try to sign Teddy as a back up and if Tanne faulter!
965075978954342400 2018-02-17 04:10:18 UTC <nicaj2256> @EricElizondo8 Thats your boy Mayfield!! Almost made the first down!! jajajapic.twitter.com/Xizx4eRL7M
965069648726241282 2018-02-17 03:45:09 UTC <nicaj2256> @EricElizondo8 Mayfield got arrested and tried to run away from the cops in Okl!! Has been benched for obscene gestures to opposing teams!! Landry never got in trouble in LSU and does not have the responsibilities of a QB!! You think he can take the heat like Tanne did down hear!!??
965067789055688704 2018-02-17 03:37:45 UTC <nicaj2256> @EricElizondo8 @Joe_Daddona DVP suffered the most form Tanne being out!! Cutler wanting him to bail him on every throw!!
965066532765265921 2018-02-17 03:32:46 UTC <nicaj2256> @EricElizondo8 Tell me the one you heard of Landry first and I will tell you the one of Mayfield!!
965064260111011840 2018-02-17 03:23:44 UTC <nicaj2256> @EricElizondo8 But you will draft Mayfield who has a ton of off the field baggage!! You can have it both ways especially Landry is a known commodity!!
964743187251302401 2018-02-16 06:07:54 UTC <nicaj2256> @AbramsonFL @LandShark_13 @ricardomoorinho I think Dolphins can be all colors!! Including all 3 colors!!
964247710596501504 2018-02-15 21:19:03 UTC <nicaj2256> @thehill I see this guy get trounced in the social media!! How does he get elected and by wide margins so much!!??
962508969280491520 2018-02-10 02:09:55 UTC <nicaj2256> @AbramsonFL They should rotate btw continents!! And if no other city wants to hold the Olympics repeat the venue next time the continent holds it.

958346490598055937 2018-01-30 14:29:43 UTC <nicaj2256> @EricElizondo8 Marino the season he tore his Aquiles, we had the best offensive team that year, even so that they made Scott Mitchell look good
958345910139998211 2018-01-30 14:27:24 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow But atleast before Loria tried to fool us but how can the MLB say they didnt know he was going to do that!! And with the other bidders what of done things differently!!

943320978385506304 2017-12-19 03:23:41 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso Financial reliefs is not an excuse!! Loria did this when he signed Reyes and FAs that offseason!! He did the same thing and we killed him for the same exact thing!!
943319984440332289 2017-12-19 03:19:44 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso Man Loria is gone stop with the excuses!! Sounds like Trump blaming Obama for everything

940331487077064704 2017-12-11 21:24:31 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso Last year Loria makes this moves and he gets creamed but just because Mr. Jeter is doing it we have to accept it with the line these move have to be done just like City of MiA had to help build the stadium and Loria made money of the Marlins remember
940330800565891072 2017-12-11 21:21:48 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso Yeah but thats like seeing DiMaggio his Yankee lore!! Just your defending his actions pretty hard and its obvious to the casual Marlins fan

938489541828149249 2017-12-06 19:25:17 UTC <nicaj2256> @EricElizondo8 @JReidDraftScout But they move a athletic slow WR to QB like Tannehill

935902535503761410 2017-11-29 16:05:27 UTC <nicaj2256> @TonyAaronII @jemelehill Gay men have that issue also
935901273681022978 2017-11-29 16:00:26 UTC <nicaj2256> @lilmar6 @MigCuervo @DomClare @jemelehill @TheAntigonaki But you can blame how this men were raised by their parents and women compliment me on the street all the time and are vulgar as well but I don't see that as sexual harassment
935900398011015168 2017-11-29 15:56:57 UTC <nicaj2256> @lilmar6 @MigCuervo @DomClare @jemelehill What don't you guys tell mothers to raise this men better my mom did and I know my boundaries!! Women help this go on too you have to look in the mirror also
935899864193470464 2017-11-29 15:54:50 UTC <nicaj2256> @jemelehill One day they say shoot your shot and now teach men how to act towards women but who teaches the men isn't it women who raise us
935896164561547270 2017-11-29 15:40:08 UTC <nicaj2256> @axios Thinking like that got Trump in the presidency
935877402651226112 2017-11-29 14:25:35 UTC <nicaj2256> @AndySlater So he thinks just because his a HOF people will buy into the team while he has a fire sale Jordan 2.0
935873618554257415 2017-11-29 14:10:33 UTC <nicaj2256> @ZaslowShow I can agree with that list!!
935682254638067712 2017-11-28 01:30:08 UTC <nicaj2256> So you knew all this was going to happen before they choose a buyer please Will get out of here
935681038675832832 2017-11-28 01:25:18 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso Man a big fat billionaire would go differently from the start!! It's like you buy the Yankees and you throw the legends under the bus and trade Judge get out of here you've been saying this for 2 years!!
935680299974963200 2017-11-28 01:22:22 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso He doesn't know that that's his opinion just like yours hate Yankees fans trying to make excuses for their hero!! Jordan 2.0 man
935547461443162114 2017-11-28 16:34:31 UTC <nicaj2256> @MarcHochman I'll try it
935352775113891841 2017-11-27 03:40:54 UTC <nicaj2256> @ckparrot @SiClancy Another defense to learn
935284745017151488 2017-11-27 23:10:34 UTC <nicaj2256> @ZaslowShow Wow totally but that's why Memphis will always be sanitation
935251145118928898 2017-11-27 20:57:03 UTC <nicaj2256> @JMendel94 That wouldn't happen if Tanne was QB
935250280475774983 2017-11-27 20:53:37 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso Good they play better with a chip on their shoulder
935249944331608070 2017-11-27 20:52:17 UTC <nicaj2256> @SedanoESPN @JasonLieser Tanking doesn't guarantee nothing look at Indy
934958337246093312 2017-11-26 01:33:32 UTC <nicaj2256> @OmarKelly I think the guards were the issue today the OL who replaced Juwan played about at par with his normal performance
934957951768518657 2017-11-26 01:32:01 UTC <nicaj2256> @SedanoESPN So listening to the fans is bad even if you agree that it's a bad idea yikes
934957646712623105 2017-11-26 01:30:48 UTC <nicaj2256> @MarcHochman She looks coldpic.twitter.com/1mUM4RXZjD
934925657108353026 2017-11-26 23:23:41 UTC <nicaj2256> @JMendel94 Man how much do we miss that man!!
934893155450867712 2017-11-26 21:14:32 UTC <nicaj2256> @PhinsiderRadio No
934864669688385536 2017-11-26 19:21:20 UTC <nicaj2256> @flasportsbuzz His terrible
934864380319162368 2017-11-26 19:20:11 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso You can cheat also
934852131756093440 2017-11-26 18:31:31 UTC <nicaj2256> @AndySlater That's almost everyone except Auburn
934819695441694721 2017-11-26 16:22:38 UTC <nicaj2256> @MattyInfante We winning today
934240999555158016 2017-11-24 02:03:06 UTC <nicaj2256> @AndySlater Theirs still a chance
934156875989430274 2017-11-24 20:28:49 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso Yeah but that win means more if you beat a team that's in the top 4 than if they loose and are in the top 15
934155970275676160 2017-11-24 20:25:13 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso Clemson has to win tonite for the game for it to mean something
932836162229727232 2017-11-20 05:00:46 UTC <nicaj2256> @MarcHochman We finally agree on something!! Rare is for weirdos
932730476422451200 2017-11-20 22:00:49 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow I've got to say Tunsil also because Parker depends on so many to be productive but Tunsil it's all on him
932715172061380609 2017-11-20 21:00:00 UTC <nicaj2256> @PhinsiderRadio Thank God your not in the situation to make that decision
932714908210335751 2017-11-20 20:58:57 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso They should put Gase in concussion protocol the way his been acting
932714571667836929 2017-11-20 20:57:37 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow I beg to disagree because the QBs we do have can't even manage a game
932657525614399489 2017-11-20 17:10:56 UTC <nicaj2256> @OmarKelly I know Tannehill could of ran for the first
932654950269808640 2017-11-20 17:00:42 UTC <nicaj2256> @PhinsiderRadio Vance might come back
932623165691449347 2017-11-20 14:54:24 UTC <nicaj2256> @davehydesports Because you a real Fin fan not a fair weather or band wagon because I was a a fan back then and we weren't winning that much either
932622652765884416 2017-11-20 14:52:22 UTC <nicaj2256> @antwanstaley Not even in the Top ten my friend not even
932609644253646852 2017-11-20 14:00:40 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow Bandwagon fair weather
932609463059697665 2017-11-20 13:59:57 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow This could happen and just getting rid of great pieces like that don't fly if you lose but atleast Thomas played better
932609062650499073 2017-11-20 13:58:22 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow Tanne hid all these defects
932608732667801600 2017-11-20 13:57:03 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow Man no one wins with the bad calls in crucial moments not even the Pat's, so you say we should fire Gase?
932607211334963200 2017-11-20 13:51:00 UTC <nicaj2256> @denverfinfan I do and it's not cut and dry like that
932606881259978752 2017-11-20 13:49:42 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow I not even upset, I knew without Tanne this season was done before it started
932604902202802176 2017-11-20 13:41:50 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow @jimmyg2273 @MiamiDolphinsUK @Grummy1976 @66SamThompson Lose Tanne

931758319659831297 2017-11-17 05:37:49 UTC <nicaj2256> @GeorgetownHoyas @CoachEwing33 @MiamiHEAT Mourning Jersey up in the rafters but not Heat
931409326123692032 2017-11-16 06:31:02 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso Great players have bad people skills
931355491225210880 2017-11-16 02:57:07 UTC <nicaj2256> @mradamscott Hey middle class needs they airplanes to be tax free
931173319692509184 2017-11-16 14:53:14 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow Winslow and McGruder are two pieces that have to get settle, looks like McGruder is big part of success and Winslow can't fill his void
930999577796280321 2017-11-15 03:22:51 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow So last year if we had this start we would of made the playoffs just to put it in perspective and we are still finding are rotation!! Talk to me in Feb and I trust Pat to make moves if he sees fit!!
930997458477502464 2017-11-15 03:14:25 UTC <nicaj2256> @JoyTaylorTalks @RayiysChris How much has he got for Cleveland

930655464521641984 2017-11-14 04:35:28 UTC <nicaj2256> @OmarKelly Those are Ireland picks also hisdoing great with the Saints
930487318074548224 2017-11-14 17:27:18 UTC <nicaj2256> @davehydesports The QB is not performing
930271862264926208 2017-11-13 03:11:10 UTC <nicaj2256> @OmarKelly Not really
929930800572887040 2017-11-12 04:35:54 UTC <nicaj2256> @joshbaumgard @WillManso You take the violence out the game and you take the fun out of it also!!
929746972482957312 2017-11-12 16:25:26 UTC <nicaj2256> @MiamiHurricanes @OmarKelly Can the Hurricanes lend the Turnover Chain to the Dolphins
929209870397722624 2017-11-10 04:51:11 UTC <nicaj2256> @AbramsonFL Wentz, Goff, Wilson, Russell, Ryan, Brady, Brees, Newton, Rivers, Carr, and you add Watson, Luck and Tanne (I'm a fins fan) when have they been more QBs better than that? It's the violence man it was the game, less violent less viewership
929159284528738304 2017-11-10 01:30:11 UTC <nicaj2256> @THEE_Hollywood Of course not you got to ride with your kid and usually people know what they raise

929120131418152960 2017-11-10 22:54:36 UTC <nicaj2256> @MarcHochman You also resemble the LV shooter
928998736193310721 2017-11-10 14:52:13 UTC <nicaj2256> @AbramsonFL That was impressive and he is massive compared to what he was here
928996509290565632 2017-11-10 14:43:22 UTC <nicaj2256> @AbramsonFL Was it a immigration problem when Katrina desplaced the population in NO
928306765430755328 2017-11-08 17:02:34 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso His done a good job in NO, both teams benefited from him leaving here and going there
928304513693470720 2017-11-08 16:53:37 UTC <nicaj2256> @AbramsonFL Moneyline
927966881520214016 2017-11-07 18:32:00 UTC <nicaj2256> @Brendan_Tobin That is exactly why we love the Hurricanes so much!!
927966032114876417 2017-11-07 18:28:37 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow Tanne had hit streaks like Cutlers Sunday night a couple of times and Cutler never ever played better then SNL in his whole career
927759626854166528 2017-11-06 04:48:26 UTC <nicaj2256> @SedanoESPN We need two more Richardsons
927739871611052033 2017-11-06 03:29:56 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow If Gase gets fired he would get a job in less than a month!! Team looked better last night especially offense. We win TO battle will be good
927650494696259584 2017-11-06 21:34:47 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow They reminded me of high school uniforms like Carol City or Booker T
927610094866632704 2017-11-06 18:54:15 UTC <nicaj2256> @iMsBianca @RonMexico718 Dion and Rison
927588584684650497 2017-11-06 17:28:47 UTC <nicaj2256> @OmarKelly Selling without Tanne since day one of season
927358819356872704 2017-11-05 02:15:46 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso The result of the Ajayi trade is to get players inline to the program, so far looks like message got across

927180918472822784 2017-11-05 14:28:51 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow Pour dude that had to handle her through the Golden era, her man didn't even get upset he must of experience this before
927180146641170432 2017-11-05 14:25:47 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso But Heat haven't won and we still sale out the arena and fins are not horrible attendance
927179782219018241 2017-11-05 14:24:20 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso Man who cares!! It's just like they think the canes and fins play on south beach

926105390227566592 2017-11-02 15:15:05 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso We got two championship doing that
926105053475336199 2017-11-02 15:13:45 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso Ok so Gordon, Ozuna, Bour, Stanton and Yelich are middle of the pack I disagree we didn't make the playoffs because of pitching
926104514674950145 2017-11-02 15:11:37 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso That if you don't make the playoffs the only way to succeed is have a fire sale
926103777895178240 2017-11-02 15:08:41 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso I don't agree with middle of the pack lineup and all the teams that didn't make the playoffs should have a fire sale that's an excuse
926101304283459591 2017-11-02 14:58:51 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso Explain the mess so I can better understand it!! Because I see a pretty good hitting team that needs pitching!!

925550761647460352 2017-10-31 02:31:12 UTC <nicaj2256> @flasportsbuzz We have 17 million in cap space, is this tru?? Now and even more if we move on from some bad contracts
925549678896254976 2017-10-31 02:26:53 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow Ajayi blew up after his second year, maybe this is Drakes window to shine

925411769933328384 2017-10-31 17:18:53 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow It's bad when the coach thinks his always right!! He always wants complete control from his players while he had a coach getting high
925411145376296961 2017-10-31 17:16:25 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso Totally agree that's why I fee Jarvis is gone also he wants only yes men

904374156279603200 2017-09-03 16:02:55 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso @antwanstaley I see them with a better record then most than half of the MLB they don't need rebuild fix the bullpen and sign good starters

895319797092700160 2017-08-09 16:24:08 UTC <nicaj2256> @OmarKelly I disagree it was more the situation he was in and that no one valued him like he did, just like you may stop loving a women but not women
895028373906501636 2017-08-08 21:06:07 UTC <nicaj2256> @OmarKelly Not really no more naked bootlegs or roll out and certainly no running plays designed for the QB

747441663564349442 2016-06-27 14:49:14 UTC <nicaj2256> @Staudenr20USN @BigOShow @mrod3997 the results beg to differ they have the best player but overall are stronger mentally
747430506472439809 2016-06-27 14:04:53 UTC <nicaj2256> @SBNation @BigOShow they quit on the pitch also

745474260743774208 2016-06-21 04:31:28 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow @ChrisRVavel but who is better option who??
745238426446770176 2016-06-21 12:54:21 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso @RickayyBobby one maybe even two!!
744981781200273408 2016-06-20 19:54:32 UTC <nicaj2256> @ShannonSharpe @terrencelight2 I'm talking about MJ not Lebron really I was happy for Cleveland those fans deserved it after everything
744980090337976320 2016-06-20 19:47:49 UTC <nicaj2256> @ShannonSharpe @terrencelight2 Heat fans hated him at least the real ones
744977636015775745 2016-06-20 19:38:04 UTC <nicaj2256> @ShannonSharpe I remember just like the 49ers were despised and the Cowboys also just that media remembers the love and not the Hate!!!
744977054991429632 2016-06-20 19:35:45 UTC <nicaj2256> @terrencelight2 @ShannonSharpe ve super good I don't remember people loving MJ when he was the best I used to hate him!!!
744411198095929344 2016-06-18 06:07:14 UTC <nicaj2256> @Kingfunkel real players on a team that has 30 times their rivals payroll come on La Liga is a weak league after top teams
744410481977241600 2016-06-18 06:04:24 UTC <nicaj2256> @Kingfunkel I place them those players in there era above Messi and CR7 Messi was carried last WC bye his team n weak draw
744409048515108864 2016-06-18 05:58:42 UTC <nicaj2256> @Kingfunkel if he doesn't win a World Cup he can't be considered the best in the world or era!! IMO neither CR7
744408038874845184 2016-06-18 05:54:41 UTC <nicaj2256> @Kingfunkel his hurt to I'm not a CR7 fan boy but Messi lays down in the WC
744407003259244544 2016-06-18 05:50:34 UTC <nicaj2256> @BradleyKaaya Argentine had a better squad all together
744406804910661632 2016-06-18 05:49:47 UTC <nicaj2256> @Kingfunkel excuses
744371685588013057 2016-06-18 03:30:14 UTC <nicaj2256> @SportsCenter Don't laugh USA got Argentina up next!!!
744343021156655104 2016-06-18 01:36:20 UTC <nicaj2256> then why doesn't he show up at the World Cup??
743656188169043973 2016-06-16 04:07:06 UTC <nicaj2256> @JoyTaylorTalks the Heat organization is classy even when they lose!!
742451660568436737 2016-06-13 20:20:44 UTC <nicaj2256> @ZaslowShow I've heard their show and have read his column but people change its the nature of life and you are also in the bubble
742450241224380417 2016-06-13 20:15:06 UTC <nicaj2256> @ZaslowShow there out of touch with the common folk I'm sorry but that's how I see them
742446491323617280 2016-06-13 20:00:12 UTC <nicaj2256> @ZaslowShow dude You explaining Dan and Stu!!
742188702588243970 2016-06-12 02:55:50 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso @C_Boogie33 @chiweethedog its called taunting you want to show kids that
742072157497262080 2016-06-12 19:12:44 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso @DwapDwapPow I bet the UM players would have same reaction they should start bat flipping in little league??
742070128645263364 2016-06-12 19:04:40 UTC <nicaj2256> @LeBatardShow @MiamiRadioBeast @KendallRogersD1 let them bat flip so hey get in a brawl and then your best player can play in Omaha
742069754249109508 2016-06-12 19:03:11 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso because showboating gets in people's feelings and if they get in a brawl with a eliminated team it hits the Canes in Omaha
742039569474801664 2016-06-12 17:03:14 UTC <nicaj2256> @GlennGeffner we need a W today
741839337751470080 2016-06-11 03:47:35 UTC <nicaj2256> @WillManso he has that from time to time the offense needs to save him once
741827424879529985 2016-06-11 03:00:15 UTC <nicaj2256> @grhring @BigOShow @GodfatherofBeer @Jpz02 I can't worry about that now I got to support my team!!
741826585171505152 2016-06-11 02:56:55 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow @grhring @Jpz02 neither did Huizenga we reload here and you shouldn't care about the team the press is so far off in this
741821401489936385 2016-06-11 02:36:19 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow @grhring @Jpz02 totally agree when they start winning more they'll be on the bandwagon
741312298866741248 2016-06-10 16:53:19 UTC <nicaj2256> @ESPNNBA @Kevin_Dasd Wade,Shaq, Mourning, Payton,Haslem,Walker,Williams,Posey I beg to differ
741305695987896324 2016-06-10 16:27:05 UTC <nicaj2256> @Deadspin Light Skin Brothers 2's

741028504599330816 2016-06-09 22:05:37 UTC <nicaj2256> @Reggielegendary I want Cleveland to win Warriors just feel to cocky wish you luck but Wade top 5 SG of all time
741028046312857601 2016-06-09 22:03:48 UTC <nicaj2256> @Reggielegendary I know one thing he got 3 and Kyrie got none score all you want but the D wins championships
741026575169126402 2016-06-09 21:57:57 UTC <nicaj2256> @Reggielegendary he doesn't guard him Deli does a better Job and in the clutch they put LBJ on him and Bosh is 3 times better then Love
741026319211761664 2016-06-09 21:56:56 UTC <nicaj2256> @Reggielegendary why did LBJ leave his home to come play with a proven Champ what has Kyrie won how was the Cavs with him leading it
741025709322207232 2016-06-09 21:54:31 UTC <nicaj2256> @SedanoESPN @Reggielegendary who can he guard his too small to play 1 on 1 with anyone and it's a team sport not 1 on 1 he can't stop on 1
741025304194387968 2016-06-09 21:52:54 UTC <nicaj2256> @Reggielegendary Wade beat all great teams in the finals those are excuses and you know what I'm rooting for LBJ and Cleveland
741024994214350852 2016-06-09 21:51:40 UTC <nicaj2256> @SedanoESPN @Reggielegendary nope dude Wade got the clutch I rather have Wade shoot the last shot then Kyrie Wade can play the post better
741024153331847168 2016-06-09 21:48:20 UTC <nicaj2256> @Reggielegendary then why doesn't he carry Cleveland to a championship??

741019113821212672 2016-06-09 21:28:18 UTC <nicaj2256> @Reggielegendary because he misses open shots not because of Kyrie's D dude just scored Marbury 2.0
741018369198043136 2016-06-09 21:25:21 UTC <nicaj2256> @SedanoESPN @Reggielegendary Kyrie scores 30 but gives up 40 Steph has better D the Kyrie

732761749384876032 2016-05-17 02:36:29 UTC <nicaj2256> @AKuperstein just pointing that out and his batting poor for his pay grade but when he gets hot this team will be a sleeper this year!!!
732760324605009920 2016-05-17 02:30:50 UTC <nicaj2256> @AKuperstein he has 12 HR's so far if he continues he will have over 50 dingers how is that playing poor. His batting for average poor!!
732759898488889344 2016-05-17 02:29:08 UTC <nicaj2256> @AKuperstein not at all just that you used poor to describe his play so far not just his batting you said his playing poor that overall nope
732758902933069826 2016-05-17 02:25:11 UTC <nicaj2256> @AKuperstein watch the games not the excel sheet, his had 3 bad games in a row and his homers and glove I'll take over whatever you said...
732758011790249984 2016-05-17 02:21:38 UTC <nicaj2256> @AKuperstein Poor I dont see like that his batting average is down but his still hitting HR and his glove has been great. Thats not poor!!
731654354927648768 2016-05-14 01:16:06 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow I think he will get the same deal like Tristan Thompson!!
731650757544415232 2016-05-14 01:01:48 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow VJ is the best thing to happen to the Heat now we dont have to pay him a max deal!!

731642249193263104 2016-05-14 00:28:00 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow Owns is a little to much he was outplaying him but I think as the series goes on the physicality of @youngwhiteside can takeover
731641253293527040 2016-05-14 00:24:02 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow If we were the better team the odds will be in our favors is not!! What I would've given to see Bosh and Whiteside healthy
731640065001037825 2016-05-14 00:19:19 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow they have two all stars in their prime and we got Wade. They have home field advantage and if they dont win they will be changes
731638167137193984 2016-05-14 00:11:46 UTC <nicaj2256> @BigOShow I agree with Greg how do we have the pressure our best player is out and Whiteside also and we are playing with 2 rooks!!!
