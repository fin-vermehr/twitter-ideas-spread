969397941520748544 2018-03-01 02:24:14 UTC <AnupaminMI> @casas_jimmy Omg! So true! This is why educators need mentors/therapists. Educators carry a lot on their shoulders. Being able to put things into perspective with credible people would help tremendously.
969396605685260288 2018-03-01 02:18:55 UTC <AnupaminMI> @RichardKlee1 Yes! Teaching with love and logic seminar really helped with this. I always referred to my students as "my kids". Made people "wonder" about my kids because I was always buying supplies, food, etc. for them.
