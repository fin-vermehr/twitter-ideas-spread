970530012515487744 2018-03-04 05:22:41 UTC <KJintheCity> @ibwrites I think the only food I like on the east coast is breakfast sandwiches, bagels, and most desert.
970521852320866306 2018-03-04 04:50:15 UTC <KJintheCity> I'm probably going to forget that "The Shape of Water" won best picture in less than a week. #Oscars #girlmeetsfish
970521427932864512 2018-03-04 04:48:34 UTC <KJintheCity> I think Get Out won in all of our hearts.https://twitter.com/jfenstey/status/970521057345011712
970520079610929153 2018-03-04 04:43:13 UTC <KJintheCity> According to @washingtonpost, I'm the Daniel Day-Lewis of seeing movies. I'm going to add this to my business cards and in promos for @ChiThisOneWoman
970519206679728128 2018-03-04 04:39:44 UTC <KJintheCity> I love that Winter Olympian @chloekimsnow was mentioned in Frances McDormand's speech. I just love the Winter Olympics so much.

970518208305401856 2018-03-04 04:35:46 UTC <KJintheCity> I'm a fan of Frances McDormand, and she is also a fan of @chloekimsnow #Oscars

970515904294506496 2018-03-04 04:26:37 UTC <KJintheCity> Gary Oldman bores me. #Oscarshttps://twitter.com/KJintheCity/status/970515339367931904
970515339367931904 2018-03-04 04:24:22 UTC <KJintheCity> Ho hum, I'm so shocked that the Academy rewarded Gary Oldman. Yawn. #Oscars

970514249700249601 2018-03-04 04:20:03 UTC <KJintheCity> Did they just show a clip from "Goodbye Mr. Chips?" Such a great movie. #Oscars90
970512703453323264 2018-03-04 04:13:54 UTC <KJintheCity> I think the in memorium should just be photos and the singer. I don't understand pointing out a few. Are they supposed to be more special?
970510128691732480 2018-03-04 04:03:40 UTC <KJintheCity> I'm so happy "Remember Me" won. @pixarcoco #oscars90
970508092264865793 2018-03-04 03:55:35 UTC <KJintheCity> "This is Me" is such a better song than "City of Stars ." I may still be bitter that "How Far I Go" didn't win. #Oscars90

970503615331913728 2018-03-04 03:37:47 UTC <KJintheCity> @JordanPeele just won Best Screenplay. I wanted him or @emilyvgordon and @kumailn #Oscars
970499593459961857 2018-03-04 03:21:48 UTC <KJintheCity> When did I become such a softy? I'm crying watching this song. #standup #Oscars
970495033274183681 2018-03-04 03:03:41 UTC <KJintheCity> I would rather watch the award show vs. surprising people who aren't watching the award show.

970488971104063488 2018-03-04 02:39:36 UTC <KJintheCity> So are they going to add NBA Championship to the EGOTs?
970488176660942848 2018-03-04 02:36:26 UTC <KJintheCity> I really wanted Laurie Metcalf to win. I may be biased since she graduated from Illinois State University.https://twitter.com/ditzkoff/status/970486778900643841
970487403659087877 2018-03-04 02:33:22 UTC <KJintheCity> Fun Fact to me and probably only me: I met Rita Moreno, George Chakiris, and Russ Tamblin at a West Side Story viewing. Russ was drunk. George was fascinated by the silver sharpies used to sign autographs. Rita was just kind and cool. All of us were just in awe of her.
970484863919935498 2018-03-04 02:23:16 UTC <KJintheCity> She's 86. She's 86. I want to be like her at 86. #Oscars
970484660533940224 2018-03-04 02:22:28 UTC <KJintheCity> Has everyone watched @OneDayAtATime yet? Rita Moreno is in it and is fantastic.
970484432816803845 2018-03-04 02:21:34 UTC <KJintheCity> Also, I love Gael Garcia Bernal, but I think Benjamin Bratt can actually sing, so he totally should have been on the stage.https://twitter.com/KJintheCity/status/970484099600338946
970484099600338946 2018-03-04 02:20:14 UTC <KJintheCity> Benjamin Bratt can actually join any show, and I would be happy.https://twitter.com/KJintheCity/status/970483790777913346
970483790777913346 2018-03-04 02:19:01 UTC <KJintheCity> Spoiler Alert: I know that Benjamin Bratt was the bad guy in @pixarcoco, but he could have joined Gael Garcia Bernal on stage. #Oscars

970481743911374848 2018-03-04 02:10:53 UTC <KJintheCity> @kumailn @Jane9280 What type of director cuts you out of a film???

970474633458847745 2018-03-04 01:42:37 UTC <KJintheCity> I always love the acceptance speeches from the documentary film winners. I want to be like them. #Oscars
970472366995394561 2018-03-04 01:33:37 UTC <KJintheCity> @usanegro Always go for the one that has thread in the title. (This only works for this year.)
970472073977098241 2018-03-04 01:32:27 UTC <KJintheCity> Um, I don't know a lot about fashion, but I think if the move is named @Phantom_Thread you should win this award. It was his to lose. #Oscars
970471512934354944 2018-03-04 01:30:13 UTC <KJintheCity> I want to wear dresses like Eva Marie Saint in my 90s. Can you believe she's 93? #Oscars

970455733912440833 2018-03-04 00:27:31 UTC <KJintheCity> @usanegro Yes! Obviously, that is why Jennifer Garner is going back.
970455397189537793 2018-03-04 00:26:11 UTC <KJintheCity> Oh no, now they're talking about dresses now. Never mind my previous compliment. At least it was short.
970454731100491776 2018-03-04 00:23:32 UTC <KJintheCity> Whoever is producing @ABC's red carpet is doing an amazing job so far. I love the questions that @michaelstrahan, Wendy McLendon-Covey, Sara Haines, and @KristaSmith are asking. What a subtle, but an important change. #Oscars90

970443943090454529 2018-03-04 23:40:40 UTC <KJintheCity> Fun Fact to me and probably only me: Before I started taking improv classes at @iochicago I volunteered to be in the dream. @JordanPeele was performing that night and @RebeccaDrysdale played me.

970436916461096961 2018-03-04 23:12:45 UTC <KJintheCity> The 45th President of the USA is a con man and a liar who is terrible at telling jokes (if that is what he was doing). #conmanandaliar

970404607338991617 2018-03-04 21:04:22 UTC <KJintheCity> I've been avoiding watching @WolverineMovie because I know it will be so sad, but it's nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay at tonight's Academy Awards. #Oscars90

970078720894689281 2018-03-03 23:29:24 UTC <KJintheCity> The 45th President of the USA is a con man and a liar who clearly did not pay attention in any of his history classes. #conmanandaliar

967262483043049472 2018-02-23 04:58:41 UTC <KJintheCity> I dont trust any teacher who would agree to be armed. If they want to carry a gun, they need to find a different profession.
967246792147525633 2018-02-23 03:56:20 UTC <KJintheCity> This wasn't the first time I contacted @parkchicago, but like every other time, I've asked for help. They haven't given it.https://twitter.com/KJintheCity/status/967221540994641921
967221540994641921 2018-02-23 02:16:00 UTC <KJintheCity> @parkchicago Tried calling @Parkchicago they transferred me. The mailbox was full.https://twitter.com/KJintheCity/status/967211894909128705
967211894909128705 2018-02-23 01:37:40 UTC <KJintheCity> Am I the only person this has happened to? Why won't @parkchicago and the City of Chicago work together?https://twitter.com/KJintheCity/status/967206624661254144
967206624661254144 2018-02-23 01:16:43 UTC <KJintheCity> I have the receipts. I was not in violation. Should I expect tickets for the other 3 times too? Why hasn't @parkchicago returned my emails? Why is the city charging me? Who can help me with this?https://twitter.com/KJintheCity/status/967206035915231232
967206035915231232 2018-02-23 01:14:23 UTC <KJintheCity> I pay for my parking in Chicago using the @parkchicago app. I have received 5 tickets from Chicago even though I paid through my app. I appealed them by mailing my receipt to the Department of Finance. The city just sent me 2 letters saying I need to pay. What is going on?
967058125470789632 2018-02-23 15:26:38 UTC <KJintheCity> They dont care if they are on the wrong side of history. You cant have a reasonable conversation with people who are this selfish.

I'm disappointed that @NBC knew about his behavior and decided to play up his comeback story vs. having stories more stories on other athletes. I'm sure they could have found someone who didn't harass women

942471504750575616 2017-12-17 19:08:11 UTC <KJintheCity> It doesn't seem like the 45th President of the USA knows why there is an Advent season. Should someone tell him today is the 3rd Sunday? #conmanandaliar
942458256160681984 2017-12-17 18:15:32 UTC <KJintheCity> @CarmaNibarger I think hes next to fall.

942124626846670848 2017-12-16 20:09:49 UTC <KJintheCity> The 45th President's Administration has banned 7 words from being used at the Centers for Disease Control. #conmanandaliar

941432590308921344 2017-12-14 22:19:55 UTC <KJintheCity> Online today - I was called a crazy bitch because I asked someone how she knew ignorant men. Who are the snowflakes? I'm having a hard time figuring this out.
941382775508295680 2017-12-14 19:01:58 UTC <KJintheCity> Ajit Patal lied today regarding net neutrality, but what else can you expect by someone appointed by a con man and a liar. #conmanandaliar #conmenandliars

940314305219715072 2017-12-11 20:16:15 UTC <KJintheCity> The 45th President of the USA is a con man and a liar who is upset that people know how much Diet Coke he drinks and how much TV he watches. #conmanandaliar
939967690218799104 2017-12-10 21:18:55 UTC <KJintheCity> On the 2nd Sunday of Advent, the 45th President of the USA is supporting a child molester for the Senate. #conmanandaliar
939591258728738816 2017-12-09 20:23:07 UTC <KJintheCity> The GOP Party and 45th President of the USA, a con man and a liar, endorsed a child molester for the US Senate. #conmanandaliar

939229702971187200 2017-12-08 20:26:25 UTC <KJintheCity> Week 46: The 45th President of the USA is a con man and a liar who is attending the opening of a civil rights museum before he has a rally to Make America Great. #conmanandaliar
939184127085080576 2017-12-08 17:25:19 UTC <KJintheCity> @missdsparks No, but he is most likely one of the next men to be outed for assault and harassment. He's scrambling to protect his image right now.

938259232499085317 2017-12-05 04:10:07 UTC <KJintheCity> Why are people still listening to Lena Dunham?
938112582568890369 2017-12-05 18:27:23 UTC <KJintheCity> We should have realized that if the GOP endorsed a con man and a liar who has been accused of harassment and multiple sexual assaults that they have no problem endorsing a child molester. There aren't 2 sides to this. #conmanandaliar

937689989143461890 2017-12-04 14:28:09 UTC <KJintheCity> The 45th President of the USA is a con man and a liar who has endorsed a pedophile for the US Senate. #conmanandaliar
937453314832203776 2017-12-03 22:47:41 UTC <KJintheCity> Do you think the 45th President of the USA is aware that today is the first Sunday of Advent? #conmanandaliar

937027930311614467 2017-12-02 18:37:22 UTC <KJintheCity> Did the 45th President of the USA admitted to obstructing justice in a tweet? #conmanandaliar
936971831386558464 2017-12-02 14:54:27 UTC <KJintheCity> The 45th President of the USA is a con man and a liar, and the GOP controlled Congress is not representing the interests of the American people. #conmanandaliar
936961458549805056 2017-12-02 14:13:14 UTC <KJintheCity> I never want to hear anyone in the @GOP say they are pro-life again. @SenateGOP proved they only care about corporations and their donors.
936832937282093056 2017-12-01 05:42:32 UTC <KJintheCity> Anytime we see a @SenateGOP we need to greet them with a procession of shame. Tonight was disgusting. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvBaw393rNA #TaxScamBill

936651152963325952 2017-12-01 17:40:11 UTC <KJintheCity> So if this tax bill passes, the GOP controlled Congress is admitting that they don't represent us. #TaxBillScam
936647100783263746 2017-12-01 17:24:05 UTC <KJintheCity> Week 45: How do you think the 45th President of the USA, a con man and a liar, is spending his day? #conmanandaliar
936642857586315264 2017-12-01 17:07:13 UTC <KJintheCity> Week 45: Before he became President of the USA, the 45th President directed Michael Flynn to make contact with the Russians.#conmanandaliar
936602037466423297 2017-12-01 14:25:01 UTC <KJintheCity> Week 45: Michael Flynn was just charged by Robert Mueller for "willfully and knowingly" making "false, fictitious and fraudulent statements" to the FBI. #conmanandaliarWeek
936380069790076928 2017-11-30 23:43:00 UTC <KJintheCity> All of this chaos is because people chose a con man and a liar for The 45th President of the USA. #conmanandaliar
936332702189572097 2017-11-30 20:34:47 UTC <KJintheCity> Just an FYI: Every man who has shared an unsolicited dick pic with me thinks he is a good guy.

935672789733961728 2017-11-28 00:52:31 UTC <KJintheCity> My biggest holiday pet peeve is parents complaining about having to move the Elf on the Shelf. No one is forcing you to do this tradition that was created in 2005. You can stop anytime. #amIagrinch

935244955433480194 2017-11-27 20:32:28 UTC <KJintheCity> The 45th President of the USA is a con man, a liar, and a racist. #conmanandaliarhttps://twitter.com/nprinskeep/status/935241779384905729

934970118232297473 2017-11-26 02:20:21 UTC <KJintheCity> The 45th President of the USA is a con man and a liar who is endorsing a child predator for Senator. #conmanandaliar
934557035714228224 2017-11-25 22:58:55 UTC <KJintheCity> The 45th President of the United States is a con man and a liar who needs a reality check. #conmanandaliar
934540659112972289 2017-11-25 21:53:50 UTC <KJintheCity> As the holiday season is starting, it's evident that besides being a con man and a liar, the 45th President of the USA will continue to be petty. #conmanandaliar

934275299432435712 2017-11-24 04:19:24 UTC <KJintheCity> Just learned that SJW is used as a slur. Shouldn't we all be social justice warriors? Why would you be against this?

933918781361082368 2017-11-23 04:42:43 UTC <KJintheCity> @epiconlon They have such great source material. I don't understand why they want to add lines like "Girls are crazy." Ugh. Really. At least, they are staying on the Island and not killing off characters.
933910148829143042 2017-11-23 04:08:25 UTC <KJintheCity> I will always be disappointed by Anne of Green Gables adaptations. However, I'm less disappointed by this PBS version than the Netflix version.
933557413516664832 2017-11-22 04:46:46 UTC <KJintheCity> @mdimarco I'm still waiting to be paid. Should I send an email regarding this?
933512955710328833 2017-11-22 01:50:07 UTC <KJintheCity> They chose Donald F#cking Trump to be President - I'll never get over it.

821769126804934657 2017-01-18 17:20:02 UTC <KJintheCity> Our President-Elect is a con man and a liar who sold the position of Education Secretary for about $200 million dollars. #conmanandaliar

724915999804416005 2016-04-26 11:00:17 UTC <KJintheCity> @RaviniaFestival @nbcchicago  once again Ravinia has not been able to handle ticket sales.
724915010242269184 2016-04-26 10:56:21 UTC <KJintheCity> @RaviniaFestival @AuthorizeNet maybe make sure your system is ready before tickets go on sale. Just a suggestion
724913199288598528 2016-04-26 10:49:09 UTC <KJintheCity> I'm glad @RaviniaFestival is investigating the issue. 50 minutes into when tickets were supposed to go on sale.
724911989739405313 2016-04-26 10:44:21 UTC <KJintheCity> Has anyone been able to buy tickets yet? Or are we all being told to wait? @RaviniaFestival
724910777891753984 2016-04-26 10:39:32 UTC <KJintheCity> Seriously, tickets on sale at 5:00, but no one has gotten through by 5:40? @RaviniaFestival #everyyearaglitch
724910144316911616 2016-04-26 10:37:01 UTC <KJintheCity> 'Don't log off.' When are you fixing this issue. At 5:00 am, there shouldn't be an issue.
724909583035158528 2016-04-26 10:34:47 UTC <KJintheCity> Why does it seem like @RaviniaFestival have a glitch every year? Or is it just every other year? #ravinia

709148888553414662 2016-03-13 22:47:25 UTC <KJintheCity> I'm more shocked that 'conservatives' are endorsing a man who has been married 3 times, dissed the pope, and debated about his penis size.
