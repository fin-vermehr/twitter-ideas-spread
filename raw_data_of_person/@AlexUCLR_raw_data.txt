796290418874806273 2016-11-09 09:56:44 UTC <AlexUCLR> @khanfactorcom Well many, until recently accurate pollsters were also surprised. I had hoped for better things.
796288138591158272 2016-11-09 09:47:41 UTC <AlexUCLR> @khanfactorcom Yes well, that would now appear to be somewhat evident I would have thought.
