968855442867793920 2018-02-28 14:28:32 UTC <TPATammyh> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @TomiLahren @kilmeade Wow, when Tomi Lauren is the best you got LOL
968841656215703553 2018-02-28 13:33:45 UTC <TPATammyh> @marcorubio All I can say is you and Republicans like you are digging yourself deeper every time you try to justify your actions!!!! The hypocrisy you spew along with the fact you support this president is insanity!!! Thats the problem now, much different than simply dem vs repub. ideaolgy!
968802536445661184 2018-02-28 10:58:18 UTC <TPATammyh> @FedEx @JuddLegum I think we, the majority of America should make sure FedEx just ships guns in the very near future!!! If that business means so much to them..
968672298889830400 2018-02-27 02:20:47 UTC <TPATammyh> @MalcolmNance @davidhogg111 Im so sorry youre subjected to such vile people. Were behind you and your community. Keep fighting, remember the majority of AMERICA is with you and we will vote out the corrupt!! Thanks for renewing our faith in whats good in this country!
968667438232621056 2018-02-27 02:01:28 UTC <TPATammyh> @GeorgeTakei What a story told so beautifully in Allegiance. One of those performances you walk away from in tears, sad but also inspired!!  we will get past this sad time in our history too and be stronger. Why cant we learn more from our fairly recent history?
968661447394947072 2018-02-27 01:37:40 UTC <TPATammyh> @ananavarro Yes!!!! Thank you and they need to get the message soon. Americans are not being represented by their elected officials. $$ are making the decisions for us. PAY ATTENTION and VOTE for those that represent your values.  Vote these corrupt politicians out!!!
968647659245441024 2018-02-27 00:42:53 UTC <TPATammyh> @GiffordsCourage @Everytown @jimmykimmel @Emma4Change Keep up the fight. Were with you. My hope is that this is bigger than the womens march and WILL affect change. Our law makers need to listen to the majority of America!!!  Keep strong, we love you and the awesome community of MSD.
967739259452043264 2018-02-25 12:33:13 UTC <TPATammyh> @marcorubio So whats the point?  Ours is, ban those too. We dont need mass fire weapons on the street, period. And people can still have their guns for defense and hunting. There ARE a majority of Americans that dont need a gun to kill anything. Imagine that!!??
967024157794938880 2018-02-23 13:11:40 UTC <TPATammyh> @realDonaldTrump What about killers in our country with access to weapons of mass destruction??!!  Do something about that. No one needs an assault rifle to protect themselves!!!!
966871618613112832 2018-02-22 03:05:32 UTC <TPATammyh> @Andy @RawStory @andy  please, goodbye to Dorit. Ugghh!
966862048691924992 2018-02-22 02:27:30 UTC <TPATammyh> @davidhogg111 We are with you!! Keep fighting and we will too!
966690355365150720 2018-02-22 15:05:15 UTC <TPATammyh> @realDonaldTrump Good, we need to ban assault weapons! NO ONE in America needs an assault rifle to protect themselves.
966687911528816641 2018-02-22 14:55:32 UTC <TPATammyh> @marcorubio Wrong!!
966438571958833152 2018-02-21 22:24:45 UTC <TPATammyh> Listening session!!  Finally a brave young man talking about GUN REFORM!!  I call BS ON MORE guns!!
966392221049278464 2018-02-21 19:20:34 UTC <TPATammyh> BUT we let them buy assault rifles!!?? Thats the point..jerk!
965714123358130176 2018-02-19 22:26:03 UTC <TPATammyh> @IngrahamAngle Yep, right out of Trumps playbook. Tell the lie often enough and people will believe its true. And then amplified by Fox!!!
965711398327193600 2018-02-19 22:15:14 UTC <TPATammyh> @ABC How about an investigation into why seniors died in the hurricane due to YOUR failure to respond!!??!!  No AR 15 involved. The hypocrisy of the GOP.... gets WORSE every single day!
964885824083984384 2018-02-17 15:34:41 UTC <TPATammyh> @matthewamiller He doesnt know how.. is it fear?? Hes devoid of normal human emotion. Sad!! How did people that voted for him nor see this?? Pay attention and vote!!!
964838838333071360 2018-02-17 12:27:59 UTC <TPATammyh> @MalcolmNance @RobertMaguire_ OMG evert f-ing picture. The man is devoid of human emotion. Im sobbing over text exchange tweets that children had to experience such horror, and this guy gives a hearty smile and thumbs up!! How do some people and even more so our current GOP leaders not see this??!!
964831715226251264 2018-02-17 11:59:41 UTC <TPATammyh> @cher Its ok. We feel the pain and frustration too!!! Encourage your followers to vote and take action to elect government officials that will represent us. Trumpsters wanted change in govt but were so ill informed. Voters need to take this back!! People need to pay attention!
964543004232028166 2018-02-16 16:52:27 UTC <TPATammyh> @maggieNYT Never have I sobbed at a tweet before. So heartbreaking.

956282179117633536 2018-01-24 21:46:53 UTC <TPATammyh> @PressSec Hi Sarah, please stop being so rude and dismissive to the press. They ARE asking questions that the American people do care about!!! And you infuriate us with your attitude and assumption that we feel the same as your party of one audience! Also, stop!! With, look,!!
954880643455954944 2018-01-20 00:57:40 UTC <TPATammyh> @realDonaldTrump WTF?? Who is this dude? What does he think this march is about?? What an absolute, clueless idiot! Can he read the signs? Wed like to see liberty, equality, justice for all. Not to mention kindness and civility. Get a grip on TRUTH!
