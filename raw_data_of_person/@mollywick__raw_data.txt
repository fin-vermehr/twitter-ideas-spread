838141567617667073 2017-03-04 21:38:16 UTC <mollywick_> I mean I'd like 5 bucks
837849036560429057 2017-03-03 02:15:51 UTC <mollywick_> @dazedminter @ughitsamelia you didn't give him a change to defend himself
837849000023830530 2017-03-03 02:15:42 UTC <mollywick_> @dazedminter @ughitsamelia have you even thought about Josh's pov? Of course not because you all immediately attacked him
837848827294060548 2017-03-03 02:15:01 UTC <mollywick_> @ughitsamelia @dazedminter you didn't have to reply to anyone. Or even tweet about it. It was your decision.
837848049510674432 2017-03-03 02:11:56 UTC <mollywick_> @ughitsamelia @dazedminter do you have screenshots of him saying he wants to fuck her?
837847911593623552 2017-03-03 02:11:23 UTC <mollywick_> @ughitsamelia @dazedminter yeah. You asked why I got involved.
837847499943587841 2017-03-03 02:09:45 UTC <mollywick_> @ughitsamelia @dazedminter then block me. You never had to respond to me.
837847320716791809 2017-03-03 02:09:02 UTC <mollywick_> @ughitsamelia @dazedminter because I'm friends with people who are getting hurt. Josh and Aspen are my friends.
837847222628810752 2017-03-03 02:08:38 UTC <mollywick_> @ughitsamelia @dazedminter then this isn't your fight. You shouldn't have even replied to anyone. Stay in your lane.
837846946459107329 2017-03-03 02:07:33 UTC <mollywick_> @ughitsamelia @dazedminter you replied to her. Why did you even start arguing
837846518245822465 2017-03-03 02:05:51 UTC <mollywick_> @ughitsamelia @dazedminter the question was for you.
837846172572266496 2017-03-03 02:04:28 UTC <mollywick_> @dazedminter @ughitsamelia that's the same with me. I know he's a good person.
837846026237136897 2017-03-03 02:03:53 UTC <mollywick_> @ughitsamelia @dazedminter yeah and everyone is attacking her. Because she stood up for a friend. That's not right.
837845634455597056 2017-03-03 02:02:20 UTC <mollywick_> @ughitsamelia @dazedminter do you know Josh personally?
837845263029006336 2017-03-03 02:00:51 UTC <mollywick_> @dazedminter @ughitsamelia it's dumb for people to attack when she shouldn't have posted he picture in the first place
837845085987487744 2017-03-03 02:00:09 UTC <mollywick_> @dazedminter well I don't trust her because I dont know her. I don't believe it until I see them.
837844975459176450 2017-03-03 01:59:43 UTC <mollywick_> @ughitsamelia @dazedminter post it all over twitter and try and get people to send him hate? A lot of hate is falling on Aspen too.
837844871583043588 2017-03-03 01:59:18 UTC <mollywick_> @ughitsamelia @dazedminter and why does this even have to be an argument? Why couldn't she just stopped talking to him. Did she have to -
