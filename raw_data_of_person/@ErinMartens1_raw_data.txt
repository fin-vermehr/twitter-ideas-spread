961658409438404608 2018-02-08 17:50:06 UTC <ErinMartens1> @evansiegfried Kelly's got to go.  He squandered his pretense of integrity and honor on serving in the Trump Administration.  When will these people learn?  ETTD (credit to @TheRickWilson )

949761346647875584 2018-01-06 21:55:25 UTC <ErinMartens1> @DemFromCT @matthewjdowd The GOP today does not care. Just using his senility to push through their crazy agenda. They do not care about our country or the majority of its peoples well being.
948897484671242240 2018-01-04 12:42:44 UTC <ErinMartens1> @DemFromCT Greg you are especially on fire today!

946419567521394688 2017-12-28 16:36:23 UTC <ErinMartens1> @DemFromCT She lost me forever with her vote on the tax bill.  I no longer trust her to do the right thing.

940635474728771585 2017-12-12 17:32:27 UTC <ErinMartens1> @DemFromCT Jones would make a great senator no matter what state.  He's a good qualified person.
940575559440052224 2017-12-12 13:34:23 UTC <ErinMartens1> @daveweigel @Eugene_Scott Energized black voters are a force to be reckoned with.

939886738398502912 2017-12-10 15:57:15 UTC <ErinMartens1> @jaketapper @KateNocera @mkraju @JimPeplau He would be unemployable in the private sector. No wonder he has worked for the govt his whole career.
939885545529978881 2017-12-10 15:52:30 UTC <ErinMartens1> @BenSasse @ASlavitt It sounds like you would need to explain how the ACA works to him before a debate!
939884633809965056 2017-12-10 15:48:53 UTC <ErinMartens1> @kylegriffin1 I want to like Sasse but his action never match his words

938176124076642304 2017-12-05 22:39:53 UTC <ErinMartens1> @DemFromCT Alabama- you can do better than this. The rest of America is rooting for you to do the right thing.
938150446736306176 2017-12-05 20:57:51 UTC <ErinMartens1> @matthewjdowd It's important to stay positive and acknowledge that some good things are happening right now.  I like this tweet a lot!

928672984717516800 2017-11-09 17:17:48 UTC <ErinMartens1> @USATODAY @JillDLawrence Probably a good idea.  See Joel Osoff.

922954548527992832 2017-10-24 22:34:46 UTC <ErinMartens1> @HotlineJosh I'm sure Flake doesn't care what Tom Perez thinks and will still probably vote with Trump over 90% of the time.

918527417110728708 2017-10-12 17:22:56 UTC <ErinMartens1> @jdawsey1 Stop playing the anthem before the game.  Problem solved.
918502262359674881 2017-10-12 15:42:58 UTC <ErinMartens1> @kylegriffin1 He consistently makes a bad situation much worse.  How is that leadership?
918329776418500614 2017-10-11 04:17:35 UTC <ErinMartens1> @kylegriffin1 Wow. Terrifying
917540694474067968 2017-10-09 00:02:03 UTC <ErinMartens1> @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC The only thing he does is golf. Some of us work for a living. Unconscionable and tone deaf that you would seriously tweet this.

916694386045530114 2017-10-07 15:59:07 UTC <ErinMartens1> @DemFromCT @TPM Let's see what happens in Alabama first before voting For Flake in the primary. He is a reliable vote for Rs. See health care repeal.
915987798158725120 2017-10-05 17:11:23 UTC <ErinMartens1> @e_kaspersky @benjaminwittes More and more recently I feel like I am living in an episode of Mr. Robot.
915905545181237248 2017-10-05 11:44:33 UTC <ErinMartens1> @PreetBharara Oh good. I was wondering about that too.
915631522002194432 2017-10-04 17:35:41 UTC <ErinMartens1> @kylegriffin1 That is what a lot of my R friends say too.

913046237200384000 2017-09-27 14:22:41 UTC <ErinMartens1> @AriBerman He is the perfect example of what a senator should be.  I will donate even though I live in TX.  Need to get the vote out!
912865967167950848 2017-09-26 02:26:21 UTC <ErinMartens1> @ASlavitt @jefferiesshow Well earned brewski!

911736000732377089 2017-09-23 23:36:16 UTC <ErinMartens1> @joliekerr He is despicable. Wonder who will be taking a knee tomorrow?  Probably a lot more players...
911735446123827200 2017-09-23 23:34:04 UTC <ErinMartens1> @PreetBharara Loved your podcast. Ditto to all of the comments about your voice too. We will all get through this together, right?
