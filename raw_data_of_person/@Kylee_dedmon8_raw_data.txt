751943348592775168 2016-07-09 00:57:19 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> I'm trusting Jordan with my snapchat while I'm gone and I'm just hoping she does a better job than Lydia did last time
751651540457304065 2016-07-08 05:37:46 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> @_jordanwoodruff my house was the first stop #blessed #feelingspecial

751257108176261120 2016-07-07 03:30:26 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> My sister is working at Baylor tonight and that's where one of the officers was taken and she's just telling me how chaotic it is down there

750734610225459200 2016-07-06 16:54:13 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> When you go to Joe T's for lunch  and leave Ashton and Carolanne at your house cause they're still sleeping
750547406350082048 2016-07-05 04:30:20 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> Carolanne said this too
750546957127544832 2016-07-05 04:28:33 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> "He was our biggest BASKETBALL star, like he was gonna go to the NFL"

718081491238957056 2016-04-07 14:22:23 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> You get 1 problem wrong on a test and apparently it's okay for your teacher to start talking bad about the sport you're in
718052175474069505 2016-04-07 12:25:54 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> @smiley_kylee8 y'all she stayed awake until I got there and then 5 minutes later she was asleep
717689659015299072 2016-04-06 12:25:23 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> Kat went to sleep last night at 9, that's gonna be a problem considering I won't be getting to her house tonight until 10:30 from cheer
717559800859459584 2016-04-05 03:49:22 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> My parents just told me not to forget that they're going to New Orleans tomorrow, I don't know how I could forget when I was never told that

717027666688249856 2016-04-04 16:34:52 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> Nothing like turning in your DC exam you've been stressing about and your teaching just staring at you

715394983788843010 2016-03-30 04:27:10 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> Tiffany and I had a plan, and it was a good plan, but then we saw something and now the plan is ruined and changed :)

715019952642613248 2016-03-29 03:36:55 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> I listened to the same song for 2 hours today before realizing it was the same song and that it was on repeat

714843526404517889 2016-03-29 15:55:52 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> @myles5x still don't understand why you didn't try out for cheer but it's fine I guess
714825758510702592 2016-03-29 14:45:16 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> I told my teacher I was going to the bathroom and 2minutes later I walk back in with Starbucks and he just stared at me and shook his head

714200879990067200 2016-03-27 21:22:13 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> It's not a holiday with them if there's no tumbling involvedpic.twitter.com/dW96Hk8Uet

713598547807997952 2016-03-25 05:28:46 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> Only 3 of the teams in my bracket for the Elite 8 are actually in the Elite 8 
713134689398177792 2016-03-24 22:45:34 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> @smiley_kylee8 I changed what I was gonna throw as soon as I started to run for tumbling
713133174990233606 2016-03-24 22:39:32 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> Kat yelled "keep trying" as she spirited out for try outs 
713106356757090304 2016-03-24 20:52:58 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> Ahahaha I still have no idea what I'm doing for running tumbling ahahaha
713083918048624640 2016-03-24 19:23:49 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> It's crazy to me that today is the last day I'll be trying out to be a Martin cheerleader

711595312213786628 2016-03-20 16:48:37 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> I think I'm the only Martin choir kid who don't go to China Town
711592549484511237 2016-03-20 16:37:39 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> Drinking frozen hot chocolate in 36 weather probably wasn't the best idea
711367709410369536 2016-03-19 01:44:13 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> I fell asleep for the entire first half of the opera and woke up right before intermission started

710698639375638528 2016-03-17 05:25:34 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> When my roommates and I first got to our room we just wanted to sleep and now it's almost 1:30 and we are all wide awake :)

708050763931516928 2016-03-10 22:03:51 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> I don't think I want to know what Lyndi got me for the gag gift 
707946447077900288 2016-03-10 15:09:20 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> If I get higher than a 20 on this pre cal test I will honestly be so surprised
707825921651314689 2016-03-09 07:10:25 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> I can't find my pencil so I'm taking that as a sign that I should just give up pre cal and accept the 20 I'm gonna get on the test
707801613201743873 2016-03-09 05:33:49 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> Thank goodness heating pads are a thing

698349097980448769 2016-02-12 03:32:54 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> When you're walking into the hotel but then you see Nancy so you stand in the cold for 15-20 minutes to talk
698280582590152705 2016-02-12 23:00:38 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> When you're shopping and out of town so you have to snapchat pictures to your friends to know to buy the outfit or not

695708764091994112 2016-02-05 20:41:09 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> @Cameron_Watson5 anything involved with Juston is always worse

695690505389117440 2016-02-05 19:28:36 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> @smiley_kylee8 I take it back, I don't know why I was ever excited in the first place
695676943774175232 2016-02-05 18:34:43 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> @Dream_Norman um????? Did you forgot somebody is coming down and seeing you tonight???

695417033937162242 2016-02-04 01:21:55 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> I literally just brought every junk food I have in my house into Kats car for Reaghan to eat...

694674577360683008 2016-02-02 00:11:40 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> I've gone one full day without bread and I've never been so miserable in my life
694294476118818818 2016-02-01 23:01:17 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> I don't understand how people can work out without listening to music
694277235969142784 2016-02-01 21:52:46 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> My dad subbed at Oakridge today & was telling his classes about me & this girl looked me up on insta & started showing the class who I was
694239422603091968 2016-02-01 19:22:31 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> I've been sitting in my car for like 20 minutes because there is a wasp flying around outside the door
693990459241140224 2016-01-31 02:53:13 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> Y'ALL GO LOOK AT MY SNAPCHAT STORY!!!!!

693290934394486784 2016-01-29 04:33:34 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> @phipppo it doesn't make any sense
693290769596059648 2016-01-29 04:32:54 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> @phipppo it's literally the most pointless and confusing "sport" that there is
693284121007632385 2016-01-29 04:06:29 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> Why is curling considered a sport to some people but not cheer?
693254413478047744 2016-01-29 02:08:26 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> @JuliaElise22 WHERE IS THIS???
693090725425098752 2016-01-29 15:18:00 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> "I'm gonna try out for cheer and snapchat the whole thing"
692949320484720641 2016-01-28 05:56:07 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> @jerasin_ my teacher makes her look like a hero half the time so it's bad for me 
692947495308152832 2016-01-28 05:48:51 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> @jerasin_ wishing I was back in Mrs.Smiths class sometimes

692385184776372224 2016-01-27 16:34:26 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> The only time I ever understand anything in pre cal is when mr peters relates it to football or baseball but other than that I'm lost
691790535921684480 2016-01-25 01:11:31 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> @smiley_kylee8 I just woke up and leave for Spirit in 20 minutes :)))
691732337495711748 2016-01-25 21:20:15 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> @JordanMayes20 yes! the guy looked like the character from Kangaroo Jack and I told him that too and he laughed, he must have liked me

691470168958971904 2016-01-24 03:58:29 UTC <Kylee_dedmon8> A good thing about not having Martin cheer from 3:15-5:30 anymore is that now I can sleep after school before going to Spirit
