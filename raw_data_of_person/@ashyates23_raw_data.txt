Its just that there are millions of other choices of music out there. Perhaps theres a personal connection Im not aware of, and if thats the case then Id happily withdraw

964848631508545536 2018-02-17 13:06:54 UTC <ashyates23> @SkatingLesson I feel like I havent slept in a week! I mean, totally worth it, but I feel sooo old.
964290467528695808 2018-02-15 00:08:57 UTC <ashyates23> True story: I signed up for Twitter just to get my skating fix from @SkatingLesson and @JonathanBeyer81 !
