970882678659547136 2018-03-05 04:44:03 UTC <GIAssasin> @Jenna_Marbles @SmolEggHead I haven't seen enough of his content or follow him enough to make an observation or opinion but at least from what I've seen it is the attitude I've seen from a lot of high schoolers.
970878434447470593 2018-03-05 04:27:11 UTC <GIAssasin> @SmolEggHead Never mind, I looked him up. Saw when @Jenna_Marbles watched his video to do her makeup. Was he supposed to be funny?

966837781199667200 2018-02-22 00:51:04 UTC <GIAssasin> @YouTube @PhillyD I seriously have been forced to dig deep to find the show sometimes. Like I have the bell on and all but sometimes it doesn't even send me the notification. Mainly your channel I'm having this problem with. @Jenna_Marbles @JulienSolomita and GMM I mostly find them easily.

965722017495269377 2018-02-19 22:57:25 UTC <GIAssasin> Lol I've been trolling a racist asshole on YouTube comments. It's fun to fuck with stupid people sometimes.
965682064690364416 2018-02-19 20:18:40 UTC <GIAssasin> @joebereta Shit, wtf. My mom made the same thing.
965656413669285889 2018-02-19 18:36:44 UTC <GIAssasin> I brought my knee up to defend myself and hit him right under his balls. So he had a dead leg and left the game. He was crying but even the ref that was by us called it a clean tackle.
965656064229175296 2018-02-19 18:35:21 UTC <GIAssasin> Lol yeah I had fun sometimes. Mostly when the other team was good cause I got a lot of action. My school's team sucked so they just kept getting past my D. I once hurt some guy that was trying to hit me. We both slid for a ball inside my box.
965653909665546240 2018-02-19 18:26:47 UTC <GIAssasin> He came at me full speed and knees me right in the nose. I dropped the ball and they scored. No foul was called and they counted the goal. I left the game with a broken nose. Probably a concussion as well. So much fun playing goalie lol
965653577950674944 2018-02-19 18:25:28 UTC <GIAssasin> Yeah I had a game where my defender, who sucked, passed the ball to the middle of my box. With the other team right there. They go the ball, I came out but then backed up. While I was in the small box I grabbed the ball. Then their attacker came at me while I was on my knee.
965645268774371328 2018-02-19 17:52:27 UTC <GIAssasin> Fuck. Once, when I started to switch to playing goalie, I got nailed on the side of my face. Had a mark similar to that one and a concussion to go with it. Kept playing though lol

949764484553359360 2018-01-06 22:07:53 UTC <GIAssasin> @FlipPhoneTara Lol that's why I said "boys". Just think about how little teenage boys are already uncomfortable in their skin and shit and then put them in a situation where they think they're being judged. Me when I bought them for my mom I just went to the store I work at and bought them.
949724015844720640 2018-01-06 19:27:05 UTC <GIAssasin> @FlipPhoneTara Cause it's hard for boys to go down that isle. It feels weird lol I've bought them for my mom before and shit. It's really not a big deal.

942552063019384832 2017-12-17 00:28:18 UTC <GIAssasin> @sharondubois_ I would never and could never do that. I don't have the talent to paint my face in a way that looks the way a professional does. It takes actual skill, and effort. All the practice and trial and error to perfect the craft.
942028732994224128 2017-12-16 13:48:46 UTC <GIAssasin> @stevezaragoza You should just dress up and go to @PhillyD office

941878281304915969 2017-12-15 03:50:56 UTC <GIAssasin> @billyeichner Aww such a beautiful tweet. My new favorite.
941878004501721089 2017-12-15 03:49:50 UTC <GIAssasin> @rickmizu Fuck, same. When I went to Vegas I kept thinking about that. That's the life. Just not have to do anything. Go to your room whenever and go gamble. Gamble and sleep.
941753904118636544 2017-12-15 19:36:42 UTC <GIAssasin> @lilriss69 Linkin Park lol
941753793187799040 2017-12-15 19:36:15 UTC <GIAssasin> @AjitPaiFCC @FLitz I keep seeing stories like this of people that are dead "commenting" on Net Neutrality, or in your case impersonating someone to try to push their fucked up agenda.

941427448926806016 2017-12-14 21:59:29 UTC <GIAssasin> Fuck this whole corrupt bunch of fuck faces. Every single person that has been involved with Trump is corrupt. We need to get rid of the whole group.https://twitter.com/MarkRuffalo/status/941091739808534528

941149972711448577 2017-12-13 03:36:53 UTC <GIAssasin> Then they're fucked in the head. Must have been kicked in the head at some point in their life.

940774279292915712 2017-12-12 02:44:01 UTC <GIAssasin> Might have misheard it, possibly. Most people say the safe age to start is 25. Once your brain is done developing.
940764439585935360 2017-12-12 02:04:55 UTC <GIAssasin> Wait is that a real thing?
940741968723714048 2017-12-12 00:35:38 UTC <GIAssasin> Although that's how I feel 90% of the time.
940741801601724416 2017-12-12 00:34:58 UTC <GIAssasin> Nah, most people would be sad.

939717053929238529 2017-12-09 04:42:59 UTC <GIAssasin> Still about the forks?
939649338359156736 2017-12-09 00:13:54 UTC <GIAssasin> Exactly, like what is the point of making a scene and making someone look bad. I can get a huge fucking box of assorted cutlery for almost nothing. I would say the whole salon should boycott that fool, but probably won't happen.

917584928711221248 2017-10-09 02:57:49 UTC <GIAssasin> @yg_monroe I regret it so much. I was seriously thinking about how I really don't give a fuck what others think or if I'm good anymore.
