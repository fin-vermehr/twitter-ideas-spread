931558750909018113 2017-11-17 16:24:48 UTC <catanoogachoo> No, they toady to important people. Sound bites and insults much more sad, and frequently used by those who know they are wrong 
931549446004969473 2017-11-17 15:47:49 UTC <catanoogachoo> No, just fact. I notice you're not keen on those and have a repertoire of illogical catchphrases to dole out as a response

893035439036170240 2017-08-03 09:06:55 UTC <catanoogachoo> @RabbieGuevara do you have a link regarding these women?

876906305516175365 2017-06-19 20:55:30 UTC <catanoogachoo> @RabbieGuevara this different from NP tho- NP not from SW, but from health. Will look at cases you've cited- without prejudice!
876819981496971264 2017-06-19 15:12:28 UTC <catanoogachoo> @chubbsdtb can't speak for education but in health is not mandatory. All children allocated HV when reg with GP, HV service not compulsory
876815819044421632 2017-06-19 14:55:56 UTC <catanoogachoo> @heyyouayeyou what data? And from whom?
876815547119394816 2017-06-19 14:54:51 UTC <catanoogachoo> @heyyouayeyou @RabbieGuevara it's not a lie. Children have always been allocated an HV. HV now NP too. HV service not compulsory.
876814986907144192 2017-06-19 14:52:37 UTC <catanoogachoo> @heyyouayeyou @RabbieGuevara how would it put social services under strain? Parents can't be forced to use what they don't want/need
876812174961889280 2017-06-19 14:41:27 UTC <catanoogachoo> @heyyouayeyou @RabbieGuevara It is true.
876811667723755520 2017-06-19 14:39:26 UTC <catanoogachoo> @heyyouayeyou @RabbieGuevara All "data" is info provided by parents, if they want to...
876811219553988609 2017-06-19 14:37:39 UTC <catanoogachoo> @heyyouayeyou @RabbieGuevara I said an NP is allocated to every child, but it is for parents to decide whether to access the service.
876792306652901376 2017-06-19 13:22:30 UTC <catanoogachoo> @heyyouayeyou Am not saying it's perfect by any means, and maybe not used correctly in this case, but much of what media saying inaccurate
876791694662021126 2017-06-19 13:20:04 UTC <catanoogachoo> @heyyouayeyou He claims "patents should be at the centre"- child should be at centre. Most abuse within families after all.
876791418278342656 2017-06-19 13:18:58 UTC <catanoogachoo> @heyyouayeyou He seems to value parental privacy rights over child protection..
876790918967328769 2017-06-19 13:16:59 UTC <catanoogachoo> @heyyouayeyou He wants to use existing CP powers- most significant case reviews show lack of info sharing as main factor when tragedy occurs
876789895364259840 2017-06-19 13:12:55 UTC <catanoogachoo> @heyyouayeyou He claims aim of NP to collect mass data & share with mass no of profs. From whom is all this data obtained?
876789415674355713 2017-06-19 13:11:01 UTC <catanoogachoo> @heyyouayeyou Where to start.. NP is allocated to all if needed but not mandatory. No rights to share information without CP concerns.
875323631747948544 2017-06-15 12:06:31 UTC <catanoogachoo> @BBCScotlandNews @cairnstoon @RuthDavidsonMSP @NicolaSturgeon Is this 60% from the Daily Record survey of just over 1000 respondents..?

716662684410900480 2016-04-03 16:24:33 UTC <catanoogachoo> @iainmacwhirter Why don't you seek to interview some HVs or HTs and find out exactly what NP will mean for them & children they work with?

709372472710270977 2016-03-14 13:35:51 UTC <catanoogachoo> @carolynleckie @ScotNational Also, that when info needs to be shared, they know why & have given consent at every stage
709372035600875521 2016-03-14 13:34:07 UTC <catanoogachoo> @carolynleckie NP training emphasises collaboration with children & families, seeking their views & acquiring their consent to intervention
709108708236783616 2016-03-13 20:07:45 UTC <catanoogachoo> @carolynleckie @ScotNational fingers crossed there are some facts in there- struggling to find any in other articles on the subject..

704427221272891394 2016-02-29 22:05:11 UTC <catanoogachoo> @hazelcowan May I ask in what way it undermines the rights of parents? Thank you...
