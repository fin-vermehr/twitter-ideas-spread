942497251808727040 2017-12-17 20:50:30 UTC <calliemund> @ItsMeDeaner @drake_cynthia We have used marmite to mask a pill, put it in their mouth with lots of sticky marmite on it and then rub it round their whiskers - it works but you may have to arrange it to be imported as marmite is uniquely British! Alternate we have used is put pill in soft cheese

846120128429346817 2017-03-26 22:02:13 UTC <calliemund> @ItsMeDeaner is he your point guy? Goes in, softens up the enemy (mum) and gets concessions on behalf of all? Callie does that in our house

838078917986648065 2017-03-04 17:29:19 UTC <calliemund> @ItsMeDeaner the throwing up is cos he has long hair and regular hair balls. But the wiz issue is annoying as he has a choice about that!

746100705367310336 2016-06-23 22:00:44 UTC <calliemund> @ItsMeDeaner @stinkerswinkers hair balls are Callie's speciality! She likes being brushed so matts less of an issue for her
746099740794839040 2016-06-23 21:56:54 UTC <calliemund> @ItsMeDeaner @stinkerswinkers yes, if we can get the matts off then after a brush he looks better

744621711912501249 2016-06-19 20:03:45 UTC <calliemund> @HutchinsonDave agreed - this week there will be a lot of us lying awake stewing or dreaming uncomfortable dreams
744620053463769088 2016-06-19 19:57:09 UTC <calliemund> @HutchinsonDave fall asleep listening to the news?
744619719123148800 2016-06-19 19:55:50 UTC <calliemund> @barelywashed @anewiss most friends seem 'better the devil you know' so I worry that in other areas it's all 'last out turn the light off'
744618036502667264 2016-06-19 19:49:08 UTC <calliemund> @barelywashed I feel a little queasy about the consequences if the polls are to be believed. Hoping the silent are really the majority.
