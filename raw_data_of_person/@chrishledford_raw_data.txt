970304746438512640 2018-03-04 14:27:33 UTC <chrishledford> I dunno, it's kinda funny to hear a senile 71 year old man who eats several cheeseburgers a day talk about wanting to be president "for life."
970294200720912385 2018-03-04 13:45:39 UTC <chrishledford> @Books_Not_Wooks Yes

970286452876759040 2018-03-04 13:14:52 UTC <chrishledford> Didn't really see too many movies this year, but there's a movie called "Knife Skills" up for best doc short. As a butterfly knife enthusiast I'm gonna be pulling for that. 
970072405543673856 2018-03-03 23:04:19 UTC <chrishledford> I like nice weather but not sure I like it when it gets so nice that classic rock radio stations just show up in the local park.

969995331944484864 2018-03-03 17:58:03 UTC <chrishledford> I may be a dummy simpleton who only recently learned that pickles are cucumbers, but something about the phrase "trade wars are good and easy to win" sound kinda like something someone might say if they were very, very wrong.

969337857272840199 2018-03-01 22:25:29 UTC <chrishledford> It's been really inspiring over these last couple of weeks to watch companies stop doing things I had no idea they were even doing.
968981806660902912 2018-02-28 22:50:40 UTC <chrishledford> Loving all these cool gun dudes like, "There's no such thing as an 'assault rifle' -- it's an 'ArmaLite Rifle'! Please learn the facts so I can counter with some worn out slogans and anecdotal evidence!"
968672206753619968 2018-02-27 02:20:25 UTC <chrishledford> I say stuff to my dog that sounds super creepy in hindsight, like just now I said, "You're the fastest little boy I've ever seen!"

968147452040802304 2018-02-26 15:35:14 UTC <chrishledford> I like this idea that the Deep State keeps using the same actors to fake crises, like their casting style is the same as Wes Anderson's.

967755348659580929 2018-02-25 13:37:09 UTC <chrishledford> As spokesman for Big Johnson T-Shirts, I've been tasked with announcing that Big Johnson LLC is cutting all ties with the NRA. We will also discontinue all t-shirts that use guns as phallic metaphors and do what Spielberg did with E.T. and replace the guns with walkie-talkies.pic.twitter.com/UiYE0SSADU

967155876124557314 2018-02-23 21:55:04 UTC <chrishledford> @RepKHandel After a long week spent avoiding tough questions about gun violence, it's a comfort to be surrounded by fellow NRA shills.

966725849159479297 2018-02-22 17:26:17 UTC <chrishledford> Watched the CNN Town Hall. Not crazy about Rubio's plan to do nothing about assault rifles but instead set up databases of all the freakiest kids in each school district.
966449999079985152 2018-02-21 23:10:10 UTC <chrishledford> None of my teachers could work the VCR without asking a student to do it for them. Can't wait to see how they do with operating and maintaining guns.
966016273946763265 2018-02-20 18:26:42 UTC <chrishledford> I hope to have kids so brave and inspiring that right-wing trolls will accuse them of being a part of the Deep State.
965969592937041920 2018-02-20 15:21:12 UTC <chrishledford> When I was a kid the gun-control debate was centered around access to handguns and Columbine was the deadliest shooting in American history. Over the last 2 decades the debate has shifted to access to military grade assault rifles and Columbine no longer cracks the top 10.
965718765844430854 2018-02-19 22:44:30 UTC <chrishledford> Oh, calm down, people. Didn't you read that article? Turns out a lot of the school shootings this year were really just *accidental* school shootings. You know,  your everyday, run-of-the-mill, random bullets unintentionally whizzing through school zones.

964496753037840387 2018-02-16 13:48:40 UTC <chrishledford> Over the last few years, it has amazed/infuriated me to watch the way ideas that were once seen as being ludicrous and offensive get repeated enough that they somehow become legitimate options, e.g. building a wall, banning Muslims, arming teachers...
964170387679580161 2018-02-15 16:11:48 UTC <chrishledford> Totally non-partisan, not controversial plan: stop electing cowards into office.

I'd appreciate it if she didn't vote for a law that will add $1.5 trillion to the deficit while costing 13 million Americans their health insurance and widening our income inequality gap.
959613668924194816 2018-02-02 02:25:02 UTC <chrishledford> @RepKHandel @AngelsOfDoom If you're gonna attribute raises & bonuses to tax cuts that haven't even gone into effect yet, are you also gonna attribute companies like Comcast, AT&T, and Walmart announcing thousands of layoffs alongside said raises immediately after passage of the tax plan?
959567419588083712 2018-02-02 23:21:15 UTC <chrishledford> @RepKHandel And how many Georgians are projected to lose health insurance due to repeal of the Obamacare mandate? CBO says 13 million Americans over next ten years.
959566212542984192 2018-02-02 23:16:27 UTC <chrishledford> @RepKHandel Weird cuz those tax cuts haven't even gone into effect yet. Kinda feels like we're still feeling the effects of a recovery that began under Obama.

951844053020225537 2018-01-12 15:51:21 UTC <chrishledford> My grandkids are gonna be like, "Grandpa is from an older generation with outdated views, like, that the earth is flat, white men in America are oppressed, and tide pods are delicious."
951818263947894785 2018-01-12 14:08:52 UTC <chrishledford> ... and don't even get him started on all those "butt-fuck" countries!
951797238128414720 2018-01-12 12:45:19 UTC <chrishledford> Not an expert on foreign policy, but pretty sure a good sign of a failed presidency is managing to somehow torpedo our relationship with the UK.
951787037425913856 2018-01-12 12:04:47 UTC <chrishledford> News anchors having way too much fun saying "shithole" on TV. Like in sex-ed when every kid got really bold about saying "penis" and "vagina" in front of the teacher.
951654033307119616 2018-01-11 03:16:17 UTC <chrishledford> Our President has gone full Bad Lieutenant
951612474209468421 2018-01-11 00:31:08 UTC <chrishledford> Of course the Mar-a-Lago guy would treat immigration policy like the admittance rules to a racist country club.
951607041885442048 2018-01-11 00:09:33 UTC <chrishledford> Is this gonna be a "turns out the real shithole country was us all along" thing?
951581820436574209 2018-01-11 22:29:20 UTC <chrishledford> Convinced that without knowing who the director was, its humanly impossible for anyone to be excited about Phantom Thread after watching the trailer.
951510231653212160 2018-01-11 17:44:52 UTC <chrishledford> The more I learn about these "YouTube personalities" the more I think we should all be reading a book.
951239659778203649 2018-01-10 23:49:42 UTC <chrishledford> Wish we had some sorta Black Mirror-esque technology to simulate an Oprah presidency before we five head-first into it.
950797694758465537 2018-01-09 18:33:30 UTC <chrishledford> We have $5 rotisserie chickens at every grocery store. How have we not reached The End of History?

Its just being an asshole and creating a toxic work environment.

950747122646880257 2018-01-09 15:12:32 UTC <chrishledford> @Wow_ThatsLame @Fernanflay @RowenaCocina 3. Just because you say "I actually like diversity" doesn't expunge what you say (i.e. the old fashioned, "I'm not racist, but...")
950746734463979521 2018-01-09 15:11:00 UTC <chrishledford> @Wow_ThatsLame @Fernanflay @RowenaCocina 2. He claims he's the victim of reverse discrimination, in other words, discrimination against a group that's already overly represented, which seems like proof in itself that the group isn't really being discriminated against
950746213263069185 2018-01-09 15:08:55 UTC <chrishledford> @Wow_ThatsLame @Fernanflay @RowenaCocina 1. He was fired for spreading a document among coworkers questioning company policy (which seems like grounds for insubordination) that also postulated that many of them weren't qualified to be working there, which is degrading and contributes to a toxic work environment.
950746136272424961 2018-01-09 15:08:37 UTC <chrishledford> @Wow_ThatsLame @Fernanflay @RowenaCocina Reading it. So far,  here are my thoughts:

950495949310357505 2018-01-08 22:34:28 UTC <chrishledford> @Wow_ThatsLame @RowenaCocina @JosephTNeedmore So companies should be able to hire who they want but not fire who they want?
950493021937815552 2018-01-08 22:22:50 UTC <chrishledford> @Wow_ThatsLame @RowenaCocina @JosephTNeedmore But if you don't get the job it means you were already kinda iffy to begin with. In other words, you're a mediocre candidate whol lost to another mediocre candidate. If you're truly exceptional you really don't have to worry.

950484573313478658 2018-01-08 21:49:16 UTC <chrishledford> @Wow_ThatsLame @suneilgavaskar @RowenaCocina Isn't that basically the gist of it? If not, please tell me what it does say.
950483862194458626 2018-01-08 21:46:26 UTC <chrishledford> @Wow_ThatsLame @RowenaCocina You're right. I don't read "scientific research" suggesting women can't hack it the workplace for the same reason I don't read books on phrenology.

950472992320081920 2018-01-08 21:03:14 UTC <chrishledford> @JamesADamore @Nahkai_Murrao Sending out a memo to coworkers questioning company policy will get you fired at just about any major corp. It doesn't help that it was full of bogus misogyny.

I'm busy!" while sitting at his desk practicing tricks with his butterfly knife.
948745467164323845 2018-01-03 02:38:40 UTC <chrishledford> Every time I read an article about Steve Bannon they always mention he's unshaven and wearing cargo pants and army fatigues and talking about Nazis and misquoting old war books. He's literally Walter from The Big Lebowski.

872297963795746816 2017-06-06 03:43:35 UTC <chrishledford> Karen Handel's base can best be described as "ppl whose fav band is Hootie & The Blowfish but still think Darius Rucker's name is Hootie"
872296149402742784 2017-06-06 03:36:23 UTC <chrishledford> How can Karen Handel say she supports small businesses after getting that teen hookah bar closed down?
872296058486960128 2017-06-06 03:36:01 UTC <chrishledford> Karen Handel embodies everything I hated about growing up in Alpharetta. She's probably never even heard of post-punk.
872128474525446146 2017-06-06 16:30:06 UTC <chrishledford> What if Shark Tank was just one-liner comics pitching their dumb business ideas and Mark Cuban groaning?
871008954121428996 2017-06-03 14:21:31 UTC <chrishledford> I thought what Bill Maher said was offensive till he explained himself by shrugging his shoulders and saying, "Oh, c'mon!"
870335533058318337 2017-06-01 17:45:35 UTC <chrishledford> Always worried about Mr Met. Unlike the more visibly unhinged Philly Phanatic, his rage has just been building beneath his calm deameanor
870019574502088708 2017-05-31 20:50:05 UTC <chrishledford> Yeah, I used to be just like you cucked betas. Then I took the "red pill" and ZZ Top showed up to turn my car into a hotrod.
869992169347588096 2017-05-31 19:01:11 UTC <chrishledford> Wonder if Kathy Griffin would've done it if she'd known what a big fan of hers Barron Trump is
869944083921457152 2017-05-31 15:50:07 UTC <chrishledford> It's just sooo Trump to give us a fun little meme and immediately follow it with putting our planet's future in peril.
869940205746368513 2017-05-31 15:34:42 UTC <chrishledford> Trump to Putin: "When I make a weird spelling error on Twitter, that's our signal that I'm thinking about you."
869694095257726982 2017-05-30 23:16:45 UTC <chrishledford> I imagine Pence is walking around his office talking like the busboy in Back to the Future, "Preeesssident Pence! I like the sounda that!"
868977170504404992 2017-05-28 23:47:56 UTC <chrishledford> If I ever shake hands with Trump, Ill pull him close and squeeze tight and lightly kiss his neck and watch him squirm. That's how I beat him
868946050610073600 2017-05-28 21:44:17 UTC <chrishledford> "Save a horse, ride a cowboy" seems to imply that every time you ride a horse it dies
868159838588686337 2017-05-26 17:40:09 UTC <chrishledford> GOP: Just a party of dads who get thrown out of their kids' little league games... and into the House of Representatives!
867923392888012800 2017-05-25 02:00:36 UTC <chrishledford> My dad called to complain that the media is misreporting the type of wrestling move Gianforte used on the reporter
867900621185318912 2017-05-25 00:30:07 UTC <chrishledford> All I heard during Trump's NATO speechpic.twitter.com/4Xg8w5xUAu
867859677614419970 2017-05-25 21:47:25 UTC <chrishledford> Body-slamming a journalist used to be a requirement to get elected in Montana
867460318414483458 2017-05-24 19:20:31 UTC <chrishledford> Kinda unsettling that Trump's first trip abroad was just a reenactment of The Omega Code
867412596726665220 2017-05-24 16:10:53 UTC <chrishledford> When your the pope and you have to be polite to the guy whose home was used to film The Devil's Advocatepic.twitter.com/6G96DrzPqv

867083940208750592 2017-05-23 18:24:55 UTC <chrishledford> @Books_Not_Wooks It is. N. Druid Hills just passing over 85

866692175567958017 2017-05-22 16:28:11 UTC <chrishledford> Makes sense to bring back Twin Peaks now since Mike Pence looks like he may have murdered Laura Palmer
866669297980112897 2017-05-22 14:57:17 UTC <chrishledford> "Are you allowed to impeach a president for harnessing the supernatural powers of a glowing orb?" - Donald Trump in 2015

866409499086737408 2017-05-21 21:44:56 UTC <chrishledford> Not sure what's going on here but my first thought when I saw this was,  "My God, we're too late."pic.twitter.com/ZDAqijdTVB
865978475093659648 2017-05-20 17:12:12 UTC <chrishledford> @JessePriceless I didn't realize just how bad things had gotten there
865916224072544256 2017-05-20 13:04:50 UTC <chrishledford> Trump-Russia scandal has become my new ACS: People vs O.J. but with a less likeable protagonist

865197387500982272 2017-05-18 13:28:26 UTC <chrishledford> RIP to a true black hole sun, Roger Ailes
865006414892113920 2017-05-17 00:49:35 UTC <chrishledford> Trump's in deep shit when conservatives are putting more effort into keeping a Tim Allen show on TV than keeping Trump in the White House
864975248290189313 2017-05-17 22:45:44 UTC <chrishledford> Wow, tough week for Trump. Luckily all he has to do next week is fix the Israel-Palestine conflict.
864949595700436992 2017-05-17 21:03:48 UTC <chrishledford> I'm sure there's nothing more inspiring to graduates than hearing an old, syphilis-ridden billionaire complain about his lousy lot in life
864922662736461824 2017-05-17 19:16:46 UTC <chrishledford> Gimme the bitcoin and free my soul, I wanna get lost in a darknet hole, fuck the NSA 
864645022137933825 2017-05-16 00:53:32 UTC <chrishledford> Trump actually said "He's a good guy. Let it go," as if he was talk his bro's girl after she found sexts on his phone.

864279952128135169 2017-05-15 00:42:52 UTC <chrishledford> @Books_Not_Wooks He's one of those classic bumbling spies
864263293657124864 2017-05-15 23:36:41 UTC <chrishledford> Not saying Trump's a Russian spy, but isn't giving highly classified info to the Russians literally what a spy does?
864260139859181569 2017-05-15 23:24:09 UTC <chrishledford> I'm not related to the guy named Ledford set to be executed tomorrow. My phone should be able to autotype that sentence by now

863063954150522880 2017-05-12 16:10:56 UTC <chrishledford> If that nude celebrity pic scandal happened today, I'd immediately suspect the president did it
863037083216162820 2017-05-12 14:24:09 UTC <chrishledford> @Books_Not_Wooks He's just lonely cuz his wife and son are in NY
863023230210252803 2017-05-12 13:29:06 UTC <chrishledford> Once you get past his banana republic dictator style, there's something kinda adorable about our president's fear of abandonment.
862745986405453824 2017-05-11 19:07:26 UTC <chrishledford> Why's everyone so down on Scientologists? They're just ppl who like boats and are trying not to feel uncomfortable feelings. #LakeLife
862735039024553985 2017-05-11 18:23:56 UTC <chrishledford> If we get rid of all the confederate memorials, how am I supposed to teach my kids what a buncha assholes their ancestors were?
862308058344685568 2017-05-10 14:07:16 UTC <chrishledford> Analysis: Trump is exhibiting all the classic behavior of a guy who definitely does have an embarrassing piss tape floating around out there
862088154563698688 2017-05-09 23:33:27 UTC <chrishledford> New job opening: investigating me for treason. Ideal candidate would be someone who wouldn't look too much into things.
861997754570215424 2017-05-09 17:34:14 UTC <chrishledford> Hey, Neighborhood Mail Thief, jokes on you. Opening mail gives me anxiety. Your plan to spread chaos has backfired.
861994608825425920 2017-05-09 17:21:44 UTC <chrishledford> To catch the Neighborhood Mail Thief I must learn to think like a mail theif... I shall steal my neighbors mail
861940314910707716 2017-05-09 13:45:59 UTC <chrishledford> Thanks to mysterious Neighborhood Mail Thief it's normal in my house to hear my gf say "Honey can you get the mail before that guy gets it?"
861408860275441664 2017-05-07 02:34:11 UTC <chrishledford> "80% of the internet is the darknet" is the new "We only use 10% of our brains"

860940714749956097 2017-05-06 19:33:56 UTC <chrishledford> The best rap stations are the ones where the radio dj will interupt the song to freestyle over the track
860834963733852160 2017-05-06 12:33:43 UTC <chrishledford> Another month, another right-wing populist to worry bout, another One Direction member to "start taking seriously"
860675889121689601 2017-05-05 02:01:37 UTC <chrishledford> @Jan_LG Me yelling at Boss Baby: "That's what the money's for!"
860642384471871493 2017-05-05 23:48:29 UTC <chrishledford> Boss Baby turned out to be a massive box office success and I feel just like Don Draper when he dismissed Muhammad Ali as a flash in the pan

859241342760833025 2017-05-01 03:01:14 UTC <chrishledford> Trump: "Think of what a violent man riddled with musket balls and with hacking cough could've solved if he'd lived just a little longer."
859133417480388612 2017-05-01 19:52:23 UTC <chrishledford> Parallel President Hillary universe's full of Twitter jokes like, "If Trump was prez he'd probably say he could have stopped the Civil War"
859103613775433729 2017-05-01 17:53:57 UTC <chrishledford> Since the Super Bowl and 85 collapse, living in Atlanta feels like staying at dad's 1st post-divorce apartment. That's a bad thing btw
