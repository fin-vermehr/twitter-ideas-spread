966160300243406848 2018-02-20 03:59:00 UTC <Febreezaaa> TBH when I was in middle school I was super anti feminist and problematic bc I thought I was just being cool but then as I grew up and started actually learning what my actions were doing it was a complete 180. Middle school is such a fragile time that we need to use to educate

964254306101874688 2018-02-15 21:45:16 UTC <Febreezaaa> I think about this a lot bc that was the best scoring section of the year. I actually learned and understood the material bc I was interested, its a story format, it captivated the class. I kinda wish more teachers thought outside the box in teaching methods.
964253995677175808 2018-02-15 21:44:02 UTC <Febreezaaa> I remember in my middle school science class my teacher started the class off by asking if we could help her interpret her dream and we were so intrigued and went along with it and turns out it was just a teaching tactic, the whole dream was a metaphor for cells and the parts

959669839605485568 2018-02-02 06:08:14 UTC <Febreezaaa> Hey i need to stop being a sad piece of poop so can someone shoot a movie suggestion in my DMs
959666730883846146 2018-02-02 05:55:53 UTC <Febreezaaa> @SomeKindofKenny BC HE LOOKED SO SAD
959644087942082560 2018-02-02 04:25:54 UTC <Febreezaaa> I also believe there is not a single person w/out some bias. Everyone is prejudice against another group of people, theres no avoiding that. HOWEVER, the next step after identifying your prejudice is recognizing that its a problem and working on having a better understanding.
959643577054912512 2018-02-02 04:23:52 UTC <Febreezaaa> Does that make sense? And you cant be racist to a white person, you can be prejudice but not racist
959643210732761088 2018-02-02 04:22:25 UTC <Febreezaaa> Ive noticed the best way to explain white privilege to a white person is to tell them that no one is saying since theyre white, theyve never suffered, but they will never suffer bc they are white
959634016143134720 2018-02-02 03:45:53 UTC <Febreezaaa> I know this is wrong but I also know its not going to change

956345617508392960 2018-01-24 01:58:57 UTC <Febreezaaa> The more time I spend away from my mom, the more I realize how much she broke me down growing up and how she put these seeds of self doubt in my head. Its so hard to love yourself when your main caregiver constantly berates you and gives you insecurities.
956343847742615552 2018-01-24 01:51:55 UTC <Febreezaaa> @SomeKindofKenny No, your mom and my mom called it that behind my back and let it slip last time I saw them

952404334058332161 2018-01-13 04:57:42 UTC <Febreezaaa> Agreed but ppl new to the dating scene or those who dont know any better have a hard time seeing the red flags. Instead of telling others they need to defend themselves, teach ppl not to be shitty. Red flags look plain when you see the world with rose colored glasses.https://twitter.com/okayychriss/status/952399478727888897

948803903365242881 2018-01-03 06:30:53 UTC <Febreezaaa> Can we make the fact no one actually knows how to wear a bra a bigger topic of discussion so we can figure out how to wear them, how often to wash them, get more range in sizes (left a different cup size than right) and make them cheaper??
948803493766336512 2018-01-03 06:29:15 UTC <Febreezaaa> Can we make menstruation a bigger topic of discussion so hygiene products can be cheaper
948803100298694656 2018-01-03 06:27:41 UTC <Febreezaaa> Can we make female masturbation a bigger topic of discussion so vibrators can be cheaper

948073752440508416 2018-01-01 06:09:31 UTC <Febreezaaa> Im severely asthmatic to the point where my friends used to yell at me to breathe better and stop laughing bc when I laugh to hard I wheeze
948071508450082816 2018-01-01 06:00:36 UTC <Febreezaaa> Whenever older men dm me I just say Im 16 even tho I have pictures from my 18th Birthday on like all my social media.  Older men in general just scare me bc men are the devil and the old ones know how to disguise it
948069348031258624 2018-01-01 05:52:01 UTC <Febreezaaa> When I used to work at michaels a 60 year old lady threw a bal of yarn at me bc it wasnt on sale so the lady who was next in line bought me chocolate. Her name was Michelle and I really hope she has a good 2018.
948068998150803457 2018-01-01 05:50:38 UTC <Febreezaaa> I have OCD and anticipatory anxiety so I literally stress about not being able to control shit that doesnt even exist yet. Like what?
948068229284532224 2018-01-01 05:47:34 UTC <Febreezaaa> Im willing to bet 80% of the ppl who hate me, hate me bc of an ex/some false thing they heard about me/some small, insignificant understanding and have never actually spoken to me
948067801192902656 2018-01-01 05:45:52 UTC <Febreezaaa> In high school i gave my bus driver a graduation announcement bc i would sit behind him on the ride home and talk to him/hear his stories and he cried bc no kids ever really thanked him/paid attention to him  Also PSA talk to your bus drivers bc theyre nice ppl
948067398342586368 2018-01-01 05:44:16 UTC <Febreezaaa> In middle school I tried to rebel against PE and didnt change out and had to run the pacer test in a band tee, Black skinny jeans, converse, AND had the long bang that went over my left eye. I hated myself afterwards.
948067079860744192 2018-01-01 05:43:00 UTC <Febreezaaa> A lot of things I thought were romantic when I was younger werent actually romantic and were rather abusive. I would reread books and listen to songs and just realize thats not healthy at all. I blame society
948066847064231936 2018-01-01 05:42:05 UTC <Febreezaaa> I struggle a lot with my weight and how I feel/fit in clothes and I had a mini breakdown today bc I weighed myself and just wasnt expecting what I saw
948066220603002881 2018-01-01 05:39:35 UTC <Febreezaaa> I was born in VA and loved it there and when my parents told me we were moving to TX I cried bc I thought I would have to take care of a horse and wasnt ready for that responsibility
948065882982502401 2018-01-01 05:38:15 UTC <Febreezaaa> Ive never broken any of my bones but I broke someone elses bone and thats a really funny story in itself bc I made him come outside to play and he said no bc he was worried about breaking a bone.... which is exactly what happened

948052736955777025 2018-01-01 04:46:01 UTC <Febreezaaa> @wokelndian One night I was talking to my dad about how easy it is to fall asleep drunk. We were watching a football game. A commercial came on so I opened Facebook and the suggested video was what happens to your body when you fall asleep with alcohol in your system
948051739651006464 2018-01-01 04:42:03 UTC <Febreezaaa> A couple didnt have kids, nephews, nieces, none of that. They wanted to see how much their phone listened so they decided they would sit down and talk about diapers for 20 minutes a day. After the second day all the ads suggested were for diapers.https://twitter.com/postmalone/status/947964279499534336

Im not saying the girl deserves what happened, but i also dont want young Muslim girls feeling more targeted and scared by this video if she wasnt attacked for her religion
945325443045093381 2017-12-25 16:08:43 UTC <Febreezaaa> @amiraourni @NeverLoggingOff Look under the original tweet and youll find it

943345433975361536 2017-12-19 05:00:52 UTC <Febreezaaa> Hi tag yourselfpic.twitter.com/dDHdU4X79f
943339896663666689 2017-12-19 04:38:52 UTC <Febreezaaa> If he gets to my dorm while Im in class or something else, hell make up the bed/wash the dishes/do laundry or whatever else to help out bc he knows I hate when things like that build up but I also get busy and they-guess what-build up
943339034721570816 2017-12-19 04:35:26 UTC <Febreezaaa> When I started college I was stressed af so he looked up hours/appointments/prices for the mental health and wellness center at UT and offered to Venmo me $ for the appt and set it up for me
943338814180855808 2017-12-19 04:34:34 UTC <Febreezaaa> When Im having trouble with a problem or paper we Skype and do the share screen and hell look over whatever I did and help me with it
943338614955626497 2017-12-19 04:33:46 UTC <Febreezaaa> The first thing he does when he wakes up regardless of the situation is kiss my forehead/cheek
943338517106712576 2017-12-19 04:33:23 UTC <Febreezaaa> If hes asleep but twitches to wake himself up the first thing he does is kiss my cheek/forehead and then adjust and fall back asleep
943338283328778240 2017-12-19 04:32:27 UTC <Febreezaaa> Hes been to literally all my Quidditch tournaments and he takes a bunch of pictures and tells me how much Ive improved since the last one and helps me practice
943338118983364608 2017-12-19 04:31:48 UTC <Febreezaaa> He never gets mad at me when I wake him honestly, I could wake him up at 3 am and he would be up INSTANTLY and just listen or do what I needed (i know this from experience)
943337877567655937 2017-12-19 04:30:51 UTC <Febreezaaa> After getting back from one of my Quidditch tournaments (we were up like 6am-11pm) we went to bed and I couldnt fall asleep bc I was thinking about the tournament so I woke him up to talk strategy and he was giving me tips on how to play better from what he saw
943337447030652928 2017-12-19 04:29:08 UTC <Febreezaaa> Okay here we go
943333477365288962 2017-12-19 04:13:21 UTC <Febreezaaa> Should I rant about cool things max does before he gets a twitter and sees it all
943332298203848705 2017-12-19 04:08:40 UTC <Febreezaaa> Even if you dont know me or I dont know you, you can 100% dm me and be greeted with a picture of my dog(s)

943325349118693376 2017-12-19 03:41:04 UTC <Febreezaaa> @vechroasiraptor All I do is tweet nice things about him but youre the funny one so I can see that happening
943324724125405184 2017-12-19 03:38:35 UTC <Febreezaaa> Max says hes getting a Twitter tonight so he can get memes fresh off the press and Im shook bc now i cant tweet about him
943314874045812736 2017-12-19 02:59:26 UTC <Febreezaaa> Whenever max asks me what I want for my birthday/Christmas/whatever else I tell something easy/cheap bc I really dislike the idea of him spending money on me
943314466523025408 2017-12-19 02:57:49 UTC <Febreezaaa> But if I do get more rings I want them from other ppl, I always felt weird buying myself a ring
943312588368117760 2017-12-19 02:50:21 UTC <Febreezaaa> I want more rings
943301814157496320 2017-12-19 02:07:32 UTC <Febreezaaa> I knew I had matured today bc I waited til the pizza was cool until I ate it.

942980598896963584 2017-12-18 04:51:09 UTC <Febreezaaa> White and white passing people need to step back and let other people have the platform. Stop being offended when someone says wow *insert ethnicity/race here* girls/boys are so pretty like Eurocentric features arent still shoved down ppls throat.
942968602348662784 2017-12-18 04:03:28 UTC <Febreezaaa> Pero UTPD still said 23th so take what you will
942968472576909312 2017-12-18 04:02:58 UTC <Febreezaaa> UT is one of the best schools out there bc of how challenging it is, not even trying to be shady. Got on a group skype call before my chem final to have friends from different colleges help me prep for my chem final, their intro classes didnt include half the material UT does.

942446278516133888 2017-12-17 17:27:57 UTC <Febreezaaa> You know everyone talks about the divide between Spanish speaking Hispanics and non Spanish speaking Hispanics but can we discuss which team REALhispanics like:

942256859158900738 2017-12-16 04:55:16 UTC <Febreezaaa> Okay Im getting this question a lot now so here we go: max laughed at me when I told him that yeah I did have feelings for him and if he asked me to be his gf one more time I might now say no, he showed up the next day with flowers and weve been good since
942251538713587712 2017-12-16 04:34:07 UTC <Febreezaaa> @Anthony_AFlores Next time were all in Austin were going on a double date
942250348273655808 2017-12-16 04:29:23 UTC <Febreezaaa> @ewwmary Its amazing what dating the right person can do for you, I want everyone to find something like this
942244413027348480 2017-12-16 04:05:48 UTC <Febreezaaa> Long story short: all these bitch ass dudes who cant even give you a text back, drop them. I was there, theyre not worth it. Get you a max, and even if max ends up not being the one, youll know how you actually deserve to be treated. Screw bare minimum twitter.
942244137360875521 2017-12-16 04:04:43 UTC <Febreezaaa> He talks in his sleep and its about our wedding/future/basically anything us. He knows all my habits, coping mechanisms, history, everything, and he still thinks Im the most amazing person to walk this earth.
942243686804541440 2017-12-16 04:02:55 UTC <Febreezaaa> So obvi now were dating and this is getting longer than I meant so cool things: the first picture is beginning of senior year, max grew out his hair 4 years, for prom I joked for him to cut it and the next day he came shaved (second picture)
942243331886796801 2017-12-16 04:01:31 UTC <Febreezaaa> I realized love wasnt what I thought it was. It isnt someone frustrating you, or you having to get through bad things to make it to the good, or seeing how much you can take before you give up. Love is someone who makes you love yourself while motivating you to be better.
942243023118897152 2017-12-16 04:00:17 UTC <Febreezaaa> I went from having someone I could talk to 24/7, someone who would always fight for me, someone who was down just to sit in silence with me just bc I needed someone. That whole summer without him I felt like I was drowning and when I finally saw him, I could breathe again.
942242590098903040 2017-12-16 03:58:34 UTC <Febreezaaa> Max had been trying to date me for four years and I continuously shot him down, he went to Japan for a couple weeks and then went to Virginia for a month and I was having a stressful summer
942242227321032704 2017-12-16 03:57:07 UTC <Febreezaaa> At this point I was dead sure I didnt have feelings so I told him that we would never be more than friends and basically tried to make it super clear that nothing would ever happen and we went and had a great time all that
942241806007390208 2017-12-16 03:55:27 UTC <Febreezaaa> Max immediately offered to take me instead, he said hed buy the tickets off me, he just wanted me to be happy and have a good time. I knew if we went it would cross a line of being friends and something more so I set down ground rules.
942241539346128896 2017-12-16 03:54:23 UTC <Febreezaaa> Senior year he took me to homecoming but we went as friends and we had a really good time, we spent so much time together and most of it was spent by me complaining about the loser guy I was dating at the time. The day I bought prom tickets I found out he was cheating on me
942241256566030336 2017-12-16 03:53:16 UTC <Febreezaaa> The rest of high school I dated other ppl & whenever I wasnt dating someone he would try to get back in the ring but at that point it was hard determining how I actually felt about him, I didnt know if it was a friendship or actual feelings but it was scary so we stayed friends
942240579555086336 2017-12-16 03:50:34 UTC <Febreezaaa> He went to Virginia over the summer and we didnt talk bc he didnt have phone service so I got bored and we just kinda... fell off. Neither of us really talked about what happened but I started dating someone else so that kinda determined things
942240172816650240 2017-12-16 03:48:57 UTC <Febreezaaa> So he asked me on a date like the end of freshman year, I agreed, we went bike racing and it was cool but neither of us had really been on a date before so it was kinda awkward and his parents were there bc neither of us could drive
942239843228233728 2017-12-16 03:47:39 UTC <Febreezaaa> We met freshman year, were both from Virginia, had similar music tastes, had some classes, etc. I was taller than him, his voice was higher than mine, just a couple of awkward teens who obviously liked each other and everyone saw it but us and our friends would call us out but ya
942238988504584194 2017-12-16 03:44:15 UTC <Febreezaaa> This is max, Im gonna post our story bc i feel like it and whenever ppl hear it they say its like a movie so here we gopic.twitter.com/HB2T9VAMFm

942157940504621061 2017-12-16 22:22:12 UTC <Febreezaaa> Unless an issue directly impacts you, 9 times out of 10 you dont even realize its an issue which is why diversity is so important. When the marginalized can tell you what they need and have it implemented, thats when well start to see actual progress.
942157675206512640 2017-12-16 22:21:08 UTC <Febreezaaa> Picture this: you cant enter a building bc your wheelchair doesnt fit through the door. The city planner who can walk doesnt even think about things like this, but if the city planner used a wheelchair, they probably would.
942157481991655424 2017-12-16 22:20:22 UTC <Febreezaaa> Okay we need PoC, minorities, disabled, lgbtq, basically the whole marginalized in policy deciding roles and in minor and major offices. These occupancies need diversity.

940282376097292288 2017-12-11 18:09:22 UTC <Febreezaaa> @mcconhaughey Im not trying to say youre wrong or that you deserved to be bullied or anything, in just saying he had the room to fix it and he didnt, ya know?
940282239669194753 2017-12-11 18:08:50 UTC <Febreezaaa> @mcconhaughey I mean, he called other kids the n word and finally they snapped, I get that some ppl cant help who their parents are but when the kids repeatedly told him thats a racial slur that shouldnt be said and he kept on, isnt his fault at that point
940272971070963713 2017-12-11 17:32:00 UTC <Febreezaaa> Its just so infuriating bc this kid has athletes, actors, performers, etc feeling sorry for him and he doesnt deserve it. The marginalized deserve help and compassion, not this racist ass kid who conned everyone into thinking hes the victim.
940271903314468867 2017-12-11 17:27:45 UTC <Febreezaaa> He was using racial slurs towards other students and they broke down and fought back and he claimed to be the victim, sound familiar??
940271759621853185 2017-12-11 17:27:11 UTC <Febreezaaa> And its so frustrating bc its this little white boy and everyone was quick to help but anyone with melanin gets scrolled past
940271652608278529 2017-12-11 17:26:46 UTC <Febreezaaa> All yall who donated to the racist kid who said he was being bullied probably scrolled past flint fundraisers, families trying to raise money for medical bills, families asking for help with funeral costs after a family member was shot by the police

883214483912577024 2017-07-06 06:41:56 UTC <Febreezaaa> There was an energy and solidarity of being a longhorn that I have never experienced. I wish this was my move in and not my orientation.
883214361065644032 2017-07-06 06:41:27 UTC <Febreezaaa> Also, all the people who were hanging at the door, reluctant to come in got DRAGGED IN, maybe or maybe not by me
883213776018866176 2017-07-06 06:39:08 UTC <Febreezaaa> Also even the ppl who "can't dance" did and the OA's were going IN.
883213468618371072 2017-07-06 06:37:54 UTC <Febreezaaa> I've never been formally asked to dance, I've never been in the middle of the dance circle, and I've never been hyped up like I was tonight.
883213110592638976 2017-07-06 06:36:29 UTC <Febreezaaa> At this point in orientation, EVERYONE is bold bc why not, we've been doing ice breakers and confidence builders the last three days
883212998978015233 2017-07-06 06:36:02 UTC <Febreezaaa> There's no cliques or anything, everyone was dancing with literally everyone and no one cared if you could dance or not
