If there are strict gun laws -and- strong steps are taken to keep guns from coming in from states that refuse to there would be fewer shootings  Guns don't materialize from thin air

967857358520143874 2018-02-25 20:22:30 UTC <willsmithfocus> The Republican Party has shown it likes fabric and music but it has no patriotism and despises rule of law  Ignoring the undisputed assessment Putin placed Trump/Pence and attacking messengers in justice and enforcement  Let this mob know where it can go  http://needtoimpeach.compic.twitter.com/kfq617yj8l
967856045778460673 2018-02-25 20:17:17 UTC <willsmithfocus> @jj5barry @ProudResister Huh, another threat.  Weird that people think these freaks shouldn't have butter knives let alone assault weapons
967849032684048395 2018-02-25 19:49:25 UTC <willsmithfocus> @AMarch4OurLives @GeorgeTakei Yet FEDEX still delivers death with the NRA. Interesting choice. Maybe just red boxes from now on
967847006050930688 2018-02-25 19:41:22 UTC <willsmithfocus> @DLoesch @votevets Can you cry about free speech -from your private channel? No  Can customers tell companies they patronize that they will take their business elsewhere if the companies promotes an organization that spreads fear and keeps battlefield weapons on the street?   Hell Yes
967829167986368517 2018-02-25 18:30:29 UTC <willsmithfocus> @newsthump That's so funny-sad  Looking at this screen is hell on my eyes...
967829017876365313 2018-02-25 18:29:53 UTC <willsmithfocus> @IfNotNowOrg Fair point, particularly about #BDS. You can't say resist without violence then say "You can't resist at all. And by the way stfu."
967819409124483072 2018-02-25 17:51:43 UTC <willsmithfocus> @reghud @AmirAminiMD There are however many instances of armed white men deciding to crush other Americans with catastrophic results  That is the history everyone should remember  As people who empathize with Nazis and Confederates furiously demand mass casualty weapons, and horde them
967814333462822912 2018-02-25 17:31:32 UTC <willsmithfocus> @kylegriffin1 Not sure everyone knows homicidal folks don't always wear the official hat  Make use of the thoughts and prayers built up from the last several massacres @ChrisMurphyCT and do the -one thing- that can prevent some/most/all of them:  Get battlefield weapons off American streets
967806751289561088 2018-02-25 17:01:25 UTC <willsmithfocus> @thinkprogress One of the most shocking facts of 2016 is Trump received the most support from white women  Setting aside the acceptance of Trump's racism and bigotry one wonders if now Trump Pence and the Republican Party backed Moore  Self-preservation will lead those voters to flee the GOP
967802576950448128 2018-02-25 16:44:49 UTC <willsmithfocus> @JohnJHarwood The only points the NRA has today are:  Make sure mass casualty weapons are easy to get Offer offensive military training to civilians Spread fear  It is a terror organization. It exists to create domestic threats
967796464972894208 2018-02-25 16:20:32 UTC <willsmithfocus> @joshtpm @KurtWeldon @LarryWest42 @kmckee7 It is right to offend a "Christian" who says the man who said "turn the other cheek" and -commanded- his followers not to kill also supports the right to own a massacre weapon  Actual Christians should be leading that offense. A few are   There is no benefit in eggshell walking
967706587300286464 2018-02-25 10:23:24 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Limerick1914 I've noticed this nauseating Oppression Envy directed at people of color  It's a bit like demanding people give you flowers and juice like they give your sibling in hospital  Building a myth to justify not gaf -and- being racist is a lot of work  It'd be easier just to be decent
967555220988309504 2018-02-24 00:21:55 UTC <willsmithfocus> @BreeNewsome @DeltaDiva_DoIt @BigTopVoice Jumping with a hope even a slim hope of reaching shore sounds right. Or, wait and escape or rebel as many did. And surviving unquestionably took tremendous psychical and emotional strength.   I don't think there is a right answer or better answer. Just the one you can comprehend
967511866892214272 2018-02-24 21:29:39 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Lexialex I don't actually know what he's saying but I think he's coming on to you  And if you wanna punch him in the throat that would be cool
967504653414948864 2018-02-24 21:00:59 UTC <willsmithfocus> @reghud @fawfulfan Also I think ammosexuals may have missed Hitler's actual agenda. Hint: it concerned "fine people"
967495532888379397 2018-02-24 20:24:44 UTC <willsmithfocus> @GeorgeTakei Not just sharing. There should be a clean break between you and your online presence  There's a reason Trump's legion craves ID databases. They are they key to your life  For too many people that key is on one chain (e.g. google account = real time location, searches, purchases)
967481824573296640 2018-02-24 19:30:16 UTC <willsmithfocus> @MilitaryTimes Is everyone supposed to offer thoughts and prayers and suggest that all military personnel walk around with ARs like ISIS now or wait for the first death?  Sorry. lost my copy of the Trump-NRA script
967473772306378752 2018-02-24 18:58:16 UTC <willsmithfocus> @thinkprogress Yeah it's too hard for mobsters and Kremlin ploys to get cleared
967464736894963712 2018-02-24 18:22:22 UTC <willsmithfocus> @reghud @MalcolmNance I believe he means traitor to the America of his imagination where the Confederacy won and uppity black folks aren't allowed to make a rukus on the street as if they were decent white sports fans  And certainly are not made president
967461152375672832 2018-02-24 18:08:07 UTC <willsmithfocus> @IfNotNowOrg @nancykric "The moment in question came just minutes after another Israeli soldier shot her 15-year-old cousin Mohammad in the face. He was unarmed and engaged in peaceful protest against President Donald Trump's declaration of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel"  Every bit of this is vital
967444039946702848 2018-02-24 17:00:08 UTC <willsmithfocus> @thinkprogress Welcome  To the real world  We're going to take this slow Go over the history and statements of the current leader of the Republican Party and then talk about the Civil War and the new definition of fine people...

967252364561469440 2018-02-23 04:18:29 UTC <willsmithfocus> @kylegriffin1 Really? Did he never glance around the room and notice anything odd?  Did he never scan through the legislation Republicans back and think "This will kick the shit out of people who aren't rich and that describes most people of color."  He -really- didn't know he was a mascot?
967248809750384641 2018-02-23 04:04:21 UTC <willsmithfocus> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @reghud @_metafizik Well either Putin is controlling them  Or Russian mercenaries are just bopping over to Syria to start shit with Americans which will force the Kremlin to take blame or lose face  So whoever is running the mercs is controlling Putin
967246848200265729 2018-02-23 03:56:33 UTC <willsmithfocus> @NRA @Amy_Siskind Why would Putin, who has spent his life trying to destroy America, want to help an organization that makes sure the country's streets are filled with catastrophic easy to use weapons?  mmm thinking thinkingwait it's coming to me...

967158760530563072 2018-02-23 22:06:32 UTC <willsmithfocus> @splcenter Huh. Most people know Hitler for wanting to kill large numbers of people as efficiently as he could manage  Not wanting to keep weapons with the sole purpose of letting individuals do exactly that out of the hands of civilian morons who want one  You learn something new everyday
967146991204687872 2018-02-23 21:19:46 UTC <willsmithfocus> Hey Twitter @Twitter Why are you dumping people who criticize Nazis but not -all- Nazis  Being a Nazi is by definition expressing hateful views. Any Nazi/white supremacist account found should be deleted  Let's make that happen before punishing their critics. Thankshttps://twitter.com/Lexialex/status/967097529048358912

967139922414104576 2018-02-23 20:51:40 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews You cannot communicate with fine gorkas they way you would a human. They aren't as advanced poor things  You have to body slam him or display your large weapon. Establish dominance and you'll be fine
967138974979575809 2018-02-23 20:47:54 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ClintSmithIII I notice this in charter schools. The charter schools intended for people of color I've seen train them to obey. Whereas quasi-private schools for mostly or all white students give them enormous freedom  This is beyond scams and charter funding is used to bleed public education
967135364069470208 2018-02-23 20:33:33 UTC <willsmithfocus> @votevets To force the military to dance for him when 89% of those asked said they were against it is extremely bad  To do it on Veteran's Day just makes it worse. It hijacks the entire day just to amuse this elderly child
967122865471590400 2018-02-23 19:43:54 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews @GABrecken Good luck with that Until then America will have to settle for law
967122183171510278 2018-02-23 19:41:11 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews @GABrecken America does not have to address a psychological issue. It has to address an access issue  If you want to fix the compulsion to do wrong and end all crime I actually do have a solution though: thoughts and prayers
967121190887313408 2018-02-23 19:37:14 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews @GABrecken There are many well-regulated militias now. There is no scenario in which -any- weapon designed to kill large numbers of people very quickly has a use off the battlefield. That is not self-defense. That is terror
967119043001044993 2018-02-23 19:28:42 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews @GABrecken Nicely done backstory. Eagerly awaiting the mini-series.Two small suggestions  Keep your insights about how to break the law and kill people to yourself  Do not imagine a marine instructor is going to fire a fuckiing AR-15 in your fucking home to *save" your child
967116552175800323 2018-02-23 19:18:48 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews @GABrecken Remove the weapons  Now someone like you may have  plan to get them illegally. Just like addicts get their hands on illegal drugs  But it will be much harder and that alone will save many lives. Which is a very good result
967115938167484427 2018-02-23 19:16:22 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews @GABrecken No one is going to blindside you into your into your image maker or under your kitchen cabinet  Nothing you have pursued has any use for anyone who is not a criminal or terrorist  You know the type I'm talking about. Lunatics preparing to make war on their neighbors
967114362698784770 2018-02-23 19:10:06 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews @GABrecken You are not a doctor. If you make a bomb you will answer to the entity with authority in that area finds you first  Just like heroin
967112609911762945 2018-02-23 19:03:08 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews @GABrecken You apparently learned what you wanted. Why you wanted is what you should reflect on  Your biography is fascinating but the subject is mass casualty weapons. No one off of a battlefield has any use for them. You still want them. I don't think America will continue to indulge you
967108864821940225 2018-02-23 18:48:16 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews @GABrecken You have no need to know how to manufacture a weapon or open doors you don't have keys to. You are not a crime fighter. So you should ask yourself why your interest lies in those directions  Your desire to kill for your right to own slaughter weapons is a hint to everyone else
967106226696925184 2018-02-23 18:37:47 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews @GABrecken Thank you for pointing out how a crazy person bent on creating a dangerous weapon might get that done  America will just take the actual weapons that actually exist off the streets  Along with heroin
967103919326408705 2018-02-23 18:28:36 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews @GABrecken Yes. The military tries not to take crazy people. And heroin is illegal  You can infer then America doesn't want just anyone getting weapons (and training) or heroin  Thus guns designed for massacres must be illegal just as heroin is*  *crime and drug free society not guaranteed
967100595344723968 2018-02-23 18:15:24 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews @GABrecken For. Locksmiths Not every jack hole who wants one  Anyone who wants to try to kill a lot of people very quickly can join the military and do so -while they are in the military- to people identified as threats to the country  Not in America to anyone who looks sketchy at Walmart
967098570791890945 2018-02-23 18:07:21 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews @GABrecken That's why nobody sells kits for breaking into houses, even though presumably it infringes on the god given rights to have every kit
967089566506278912 2018-02-23 17:31:34 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews No individual should have the freedom to massacre other people. The right to own weapons whose only purpose is to facilitate that is not enshrined anywhere. Go to hell  Or rather take the hell bring and spread back where it came from
967079699510947840 2018-02-23 16:52:22 UTC <willsmithfocus> @newsthump Brilliant...
967077157968187392 2018-02-23 16:42:16 UTC <willsmithfocus> @kylegriffin1 Coward. That's interesting. How are you feet these days Mr. Trump?
967068952915476480 2018-02-23 16:09:40 UTC <willsmithfocus> Many who say they admire the military/law enforcement don't. They like the idea of people they don't like being hurt  If you admire anything it's the high standard. When one falls short you are heartbroken, furious  If that doesn't matter you are not an admirer. You're a groupie
967065676832747520 2018-02-23 15:56:39 UTC <willsmithfocus> @TimfromDa70s And lo on that fateful day, the Agents of A.L.G.E.B.R.A. were born
967063113915748352 2018-02-23 15:46:28 UTC <willsmithfocus> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SenJohnMcCain @votevets Odd. Somebody said Trump and "conservatives" respect people who serve and hate bitter partisanship
967057026101673984 2018-02-23 15:22:16 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ACLU @samswey The only difference will be the videos that come out of police body slamming girls and administrators attacking boys in schools will become videos of police and teachers executing children of color
967055356051574784 2018-02-23 15:15:38 UTC <willsmithfocus> @thinkprogress And drug dealers don't force anyone to get high they just do everything in their power to put the drug in the hands of anyone with the money to pay for it  The NRA stopped being a responsible entity long ago. Death is what they promote now, and it is their addiction
967049638967762944 2018-02-23 14:52:55 UTC <willsmithfocus> @CarmenYulinCruz @SenGillibrand If you feel that way will you, and however many of your colleagues you can get to participate, refuse to give anything but "thoughts and prayers" to Republicans trying to conduct business? Not just long enough to get some good memes out of it but until they agree to take this up?
967046952213938178 2018-02-23 14:42:14 UTC <willsmithfocus> @legogradstudent Well done. Here's your sidearm...
967044326021894149 2018-02-23 14:31:48 UTC <willsmithfocus> @NRA @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu @MonicaSmalls2 Absolutely.
967042062427262976 2018-02-23 14:22:49 UTC <willsmithfocus> @JoshuaGrubbsPhD @rachaelraker @Loliz @RichardTuffin Which tests are you referring to? The kind of evaluations that miss unstable people in law enforcement and the military all the time? If anyone is offended they'll have to be. We all know it's true
967038498434961408 2018-02-23 14:08:39 UTC <willsmithfocus> @NRA @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu You know who loves mass shootings? The terrorist organization that wants to keep guns whose only function is to kill large numbers of people very quickly on the streets of America and encourage their use: the NRA
967027251903651845 2018-02-23 13:23:58 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews Whatever death-junkie. You are not going to shame anyone into ignoring the slaughter the catastrophic weapons you are fighting to keep on American streets unleash.  Go attend to your human sacrifices or whatever it is you do when you're not poisoning the dialogue.
966815659161260033 2018-02-22 23:23:10 UTC <willsmithfocus> I got to say it was a good day...https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/966804585007534087
966809141992927233 2018-02-22 22:57:16 UTC <willsmithfocus> @NRA @votevets Marco Rubio has accidentally, explained the only way forward  All 2000 weapons (and modifications) that essentially mimic an "assault rifle" now or in the future must be banned from civilian use  Anything short of that and we will all be back standing in blood doing it all again
966803989466615813 2018-02-22 22:36:48 UTC <willsmithfocus> @TomHolland1996 @Zendaya You could get their attention if you really wanted it. Enjoy the freedom. Being able to put on super-stardom and take it off like one of your outfits is a rare gift
966771555073232896 2018-02-22 20:27:55 UTC <willsmithfocus> @TheKingCenter @mochamomma Which will not end when they arrive  Zimmerman hunted a black person and walked. A white teacher who kills an armed black man he didn't recognize -may- be scolded. The dead teacher? Thoughts and prayers  Not to mention the new hell for every student of color  This scheme is DOA
966757550304776192 2018-02-22 19:32:16 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Variety Remember that time the dude killed 17 people with his controller?
966756440814833665 2018-02-22 19:27:51 UTC <willsmithfocus> @kylegriffin1 Police who sign up to risk their lives for others call for expert backup when faced with a domestic terrorist  This scheme is stupidest, most dangerous -domestic- thing Trump and his legion have done
966737356496756736 2018-02-22 18:12:01 UTC <willsmithfocus> @sarahemclaugh Apparently Curtis Rhodes is not aware that death can present human beings with some stark choices  These students have chosen to do everything in their power to prevent more  Sounds like extra credit (for being part of) History to me
966717297518874625 2018-02-22 16:52:19 UTC <willsmithfocus> @johnpavlovitz It's not like the United States was born in protest or anything. And come on, preventing more kids from being cut down like wheat? Why do young people always get engrossed in such trivial things?  Thank god there are fine people to show them what's really important
966704117224701953 2018-02-22 15:59:56 UTC <willsmithfocus> @kylegriffin1 Um... someone should tell him his party is led by a guy who got help from a hostile foreign power before this gets too embarrassing
966702148728827904 2018-02-22 15:52:07 UTC <willsmithfocus> @thinkprogress Have you ever noticed these folks always diminish actual death and real suffering to "crisis acting" and magnify their own petty discomfort to the passion of Christ?
966699372565196800 2018-02-22 15:41:05 UTC <willsmithfocus> @summerbrennan Why don't you admit you hate America and teenage race car drivers?

966684793130930180 2018-02-22 14:43:09 UTC <willsmithfocus> @soledadobrien The NRA is offering offensive gun training, according to them from SEALS, and defends the domestic terrorist's weapons of choice  A civilian has no need or use for such training or weapons. They are openly creating domestic threats  A just god will not show them any mercy at all
966678362545672192 2018-02-22 14:17:36 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Shawnfor63 @learyreports @duckyjd @MoiraR @pegolas @KaviMontanaro @FunArtAndDesign That's a good name for all 2000 guns Marco Rubio says are currently available to civilians and for all intents and purposes identical
966674865645342722 2018-02-22 14:03:42 UTC <willsmithfocus> @HeerJeet Wouldn't someone from the school, the principal, or other kids say "Hey those guys aren't real students?"  And what does it even mean? I assume they believe the people are really dead. Killed with a weapon designed for slaughter. The person who says it doesn't change any of that

If you think your junk is your choice you have finally caught up
966501887485804544 2018-02-21 02:36:21 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ChrisMurphyCT @Mary88245220 If you want to debate hunting you're in the wrong room on the wrong day in the wrong fucking year. Everyone else is talking about humans being shot to death  Get lost
966498433036111872 2018-02-21 02:22:37 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ChrisMurphyCT @Mary88245220 We are talking about shooting at people. The entire conversation is about guns being used to shoot people  If you hunt animals with a handgun or a fucking "assault rifle" turn yourself in at the nearest medical faculty  If you're just being deliberately stupid you have succeeded
966430607986380800 2018-02-21 21:53:07 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ChrisMurphyCT @Mary88245220 You can kill a man with one bullet. That is using the tool as intended. If you are not against that stop telling people you think killing is wrong. That is a lie  I imagine women don't think men should do many things with their bodies. There are no laws against them
966426826666139648 2018-02-21 21:38:05 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ChrisMurphyCT @Mary88245220 So you are saying all guns should be illegal at best phased out quickly in favor of non-lethal alternatives. You are against war period  If you feel that way I respect your integrity and your hope  If you're just being the lying hypocrite I take you for see the previous response

How many civilians challenging these kids' experience have survived hostile fire?  If they are too young for independent thought why was it okay Roy Moore "dated" kids even younger?

965029023721156608 2018-02-17 01:03:43 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealCandaceO @Sig45Mike There is a lot of illegal drug market legislation. So much that if you participate in any way you go to jail  That's the purpose of laws; a concept that only seems incomprehensible in America when it comes to guns

965024273751560192 2018-02-17 00:44:50 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealCandaceO @Sig45Mike I realize background checks are being avoided locally and falling through the cracks at the federal level  If you agree people convicted of violent crime should not get guns -and- you support closing the loopholes and filling the gaps that allow it  We are making good progress
965021366587072512 2018-02-17 00:33:17 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealCandaceO @Sig45Mike If you believe there is no difference between "assault rifles" and other guns you won't miss them

965018179893264384 2018-02-17 00:20:37 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Lexialex Should've told American "conservatives" Kenya hacked the election That would have gotten a response
965015389632528384 2018-02-17 00:09:32 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealCandaceO @Sig45Mike I am satisfied that the odds of a violent criminal, spouse abuser, or unstable person harming someone with a gun are much higher than them saving someone  I'm satisfied that an "assault rifles" or a modification to imitate that rate of fire is not a tool for rescue
965012731123421184 2018-02-17 23:58:58 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealCandaceO @Sig45Mike Ban, no. But:  Long waiting (aka cool off) time without demonstration of imminent need  Convicted of stalking, spouse abuse no gun  Sell/give away own gun? Same restrictions  Working the refs (e.g. bringing guns from Indiana to Chicago) Max punishment including accessory charges
965005354995191808 2018-02-17 23:29:40 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealCandaceO @Sig45Mike Yes. Banning the sale of a tool that makes killing a lot of people easy is the cure for killing a lot of people with that tool  No it won't end murder  The ability to end a type of crime is not the standard for doing everything possible to prevent that type of crime
964998688073543680 2018-02-17 23:03:10 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealCandaceO @Sig45Mike It will hopefully soon be impossible for anyone in America to buy weapons designed for mass death.

960573206963916800 2018-02-05 17:57:53 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Lexialex Fair but American police acting like a particularly brutal military occupying the area rather than peace officers dealing with citizens they're sworn to protect has nothing to do with training they have received from Israel  Probably
960563570911137792 2018-02-05 17:19:36 UTC <willsmithfocus> @samswey @AsteadWesley Odd. It seems 17 people were arrested for peacefully protesting police abuse and murder of AAs  Hm
960559632648409089 2018-02-05 17:03:57 UTC <willsmithfocus> @democracynow How many arrested for flipping cars and destroying sh*t?  Or is that stuff only bad when it's a response to mass murder of AAs by organizations sworn to protect them?

It was fine.I liked the performers and if I see their names associated with stuff in the future I'll check it out  Critics need to chill. It's not that serious and the world is too small for anyone to need "experts" with very different tastes to tell them what to watch

Just damage and the right of police and any armed "white" person to KILL people for it  The response to Black riots after deadly injustice would be more sympathetic than it is to fans IF whites viewed AAs as human

Their only  job is to vote  You can't say Trump is dangerous -and- give him absolute spying power as Dems just did  Their half-hearted shutdown got CHIPS funding -without- support for centers to give care  They aren't resisting. They're giving the enemy covering fire

956590335177740288 2018-01-25 18:11:23 UTC <willsmithfocus> @TomSteyer There are individual Democrats who fight but tbh the party died long ago  When both chambers are full of people who can be counted on to abandon or undermine your efforts when a few votes or one makes the difference that isn't a party  It's a wake  Bury the dead.

946538281835139074 2017-12-28 00:28:06 UTC <willsmithfocus> A good way to think of it might be like when bears walk by houses. Except much more rare.

937020930613760000 2017-12-02 18:09:33 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ashtonpittman @TylerCalkins8 I agree  Now take it a step further. The right is taken. Democrats have tried  to split the difference for a long time and paid dearly. It's time to try something else  Winning back progressives is easy. The question is how many of the non-voters will respond too. I'd say a lot
937019146474278913 2017-12-02 18:02:28 UTC <willsmithfocus> Sure you'll suffer in old age but the main thing is outsourcing corporations will get a tax cut amiright?  #GOPTaxScam heads to both Houses next for the final battlehttps://twitter.com/Newsweek/status/936736704907694082
937016033273098243 2017-12-02 17:50:05 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ashtonpittman @TylerCalkins8 Well try it. You know you'll get progressives back at least. There is everything to gain and nothing to lose  About 60 million people chose a Nazi. That is not the whole country Even if they think so
937011748800024576 2017-12-02 17:33:04 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ashtonpittman @TylerCalkins8 Well then keep losing  There are over 90 million voters who don't want Nazis and don't want sort of kind of liberalish candy shell with centery nougat Democrats have been trying to sell  To start, if you don't want to work things out with progressives who has the purity problem?
937004376165675008 2017-12-02 17:03:46 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ashtonpittman @TylerCalkins8 Oh My God  What I want is for you stop trying to have the argument with me you've been practicing in your head.   You want to show how clever you are? Don't do the kind of posts you're complaining about and if you see a BernieBro (TM) do it tell them there are bigger fish to fry
937001570461351936 2017-12-02 16:52:37 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ashtonpittman @TylerCalkins8 Whatever dude. And when they don't vote for whatever clown you present blame somebody else genius.
937001237240627200 2017-12-02 16:51:18 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ashtonpittman @TylerCalkins8 This is a good metaphor. You are using a word that sounds awkward in the context you used it to sound smarter than you are.  Similarly you are arguing about a tiny group of voters as if a) voters not candidate are responsible for loses b) other factors didn't play a larger role
936996750241468421 2017-12-02 16:33:28 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ashtonpittman @TylerCalkins8 You haven't quite mastered your word of the day. And what I want is Groundhog Primary to end  If you don't want to focus on the Kremlin or Nazi voters or the future cool. Don't try to clown people you're going to need  You tried that. You can't stop crying about how it turned out
936978935023271936 2017-12-02 15:22:40 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ashtonpittman Legislation happens in Congress. Which Democrats lose because they think snark is clever and reconciling with progressives isn't  I'd focus on winning over those voters and the over 90 million who didn't go Dem but don't want Nazis either  But I'm sure you know what you're doing

936402497131888640 2017-11-30 01:12:07 UTC <willsmithfocus> @oneunderscore__ Trump is determined to privatize war and intelligence so the only qualification is: are those hired willing to do whatever evil Trump can imagine.  If America ever stops being a Kremlin experiment the real organizations will inevitably be tasked to stop whatever horror he starts.

936038256617115648 2017-11-29 01:04:45 UTC <willsmithfocus> @thehill Anyone focusing on Donald Trump is focusing on terrorism. He very publicly became the spokesman for international terror today.  Apparently being the a known Kremlin ploy and mob tool wasn't enough.

933517810210344960 2017-11-22 02:09:24 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews The United States defeated the army that was "just following orders," after it spent years killing people, many worked and tortured to death. Donald Trump, who is sympathetic to white supremacists, could kill more in a day.  Normally this would be a difficult decision. Not today.

931595804741074944 2017-11-17 18:52:02 UTC <willsmithfocus> @thehill @ringod01 @Ryan37745676 The exports bump is caused by a temporary lag in Asia's usual supply partner. It has nothing to do with regulation or lack thereof that a) hasnt had time to make the impact it will have and b) was never the cause of the drop. The cause is decline in demand. Permanent decline.
931592427416190978 2017-11-17 18:38:37 UTC <willsmithfocus> @washingtonpost @johnpavlovitz @Grey_Obelisk @bmacmixer Fair point. If Democrats take the effort being squandered on scapegoating and pour it into: getting rid of #crosscheck, making sure there are enough polls, fighting suppression and not alienating active voters who won't go Nazi maybe- the Kremlin wont pick the next WH resident.
931557617649860608 2017-11-17 16:20:18 UTC <willsmithfocus> @thehill @ringod01 @Ryan37745676 I assume you know that bump is an illusion. That it doesnt come near capacity. That the plants are still closing and the decline in demand is real, deliberate and permanent. You have to know it has nothing to do with Trumps deregulation. So who are you trying to kid? Yourself?
931372209431547904 2017-11-16 04:03:33 UTC <willsmithfocus> @washingtonpost @johnpavlovitz @Grey_Obelisk Apparently the Kremlin made a concerted effort to get Trump elected. 90 million Americans didn't vote. Over 62 million chose Trump. Democrats just like you dismissed those "lefty" voters and continue to dump on them. But you're right. It's their fault. You've saved the republic.

931308031547129856 2017-11-16 23:48:32 UTC <willsmithfocus> @thehill So Republicans wrapped themselves in tradition for advantage then stomped on tradition and rules when they felt like it. What else is old?  Will Democrats take the hint, stop being chumps and start fighting to win? That would be new.

The only trap is the one you should keep closed more often. Find out how the world is abandoning coal in any new source. Or stay in your poisonous bubble with Trump. Whatever. We're done.

No one is interested in burning rocks for energy in 2017. The world is moving on. Trump is selling miners a dream. A bad dream of painful death. Was that your best shot?

If Trump is a danger to the US and world, and he is, every principled official needs to do everything in their power to remove him. Not risk letting him linger because they think even their weak meat will look good next to a Nazi. That doesn't work. See: 2016.

929799444643577857 2017-11-12 19:53:57 UTC <willsmithfocus> @johnpavlovitz This is very important. It explains their slippery slope theories about adult behavior, lack of surprise/outrage when their leaders are exposed, and most importantly their code of silence about bad things.

929797414512480256 2017-11-12 19:45:53 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RVAwonk So this attacking the character of the victim thing is not limited to PoC murdered by cops. Its just a conservative thing.

927935969067749378 2017-11-07 16:29:09 UTC <willsmithfocus> @realDonaldTrump @Channel4News So Trump doesnt think his good guy with a gun could meet higher standards and pretends not to know Chicago registration and carry laws are loose and the guns come from states like Pences Indiana.

923728613043662848 2017-10-26 01:50:38 UTC <willsmithfocus> About a week ago an actual terrorist was caught in the US. If you think that is something Trump, Pence and the media would be all over you haven't been paying attention to the details.

And look at the size of that asshole compared to the boy. Real tough guy. And they charged the black kid. Of course.
923710364209967105 2017-10-26 00:38:07 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews Also at an all time high is people watching Republicans follow Trump to hell and asking "What are they smoking?"

923029223194988544 2017-10-24 03:31:30 UTC <willsmithfocus> @samswey So either the police withdrew officers that were needed risking public safety for a political reason, a near cousin of an act of terrorism, or the officers were never needed and their presence was a kickback scam all along

Until then he is a man brave enough to say a scumbag is a scumbag. The GOP courage bar is exactly that low but its reasonable for others to hope for more.

It isnt actual oppression or discrimination. Its just you being annoyed by people confronting those things.

920238107122962432 2017-10-17 10:40:36 UTC <willsmithfocus> @jj5barry A horrifying scenario. And I know this guys a dude but I get the idea the prison metaphor isnt crazy. Where is the reset on this game?

920086310299295744 2017-10-16 00:37:25 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews Seems like a nation with significant leverage over both groups would be extremely well placed to broker peace. But who..?
920081431648456704 2017-10-16 00:18:02 UTC <willsmithfocus> @KagroX The guy who needs picture-book briefs wrote 4 letters? If he made a call or 2 before he hit the links Trump could've done it. What an animal

919783422582841344 2017-10-15 04:33:51 UTC <willsmithfocus> @johnpavlovitz Twelve years ago and it wasnt someone talking about him, it was Trump describing in detail how he committed a crime. The person suing Trump when he was elected- had been a child when he allegedly raped her. Someone else can understand these people. I know enough.

919620745453502467 2017-10-15 17:47:26 UTC <willsmithfocus> @LaFarrellM @BoingBoing Now we see why the Trump mob has been slow-walking aid. To give a private force time to invade an American territory. If he does not send the military there to take or eliminate those combatants they should go anyway; and arrest him.
919616742254698502 2017-10-15 17:31:31 UTC <willsmithfocus> @samswey @km Possibly the idea of buying people isn't quite as hilarious anymore with white supremacists marching in US streets and @espn punishing a woman who called out racists.

Trump, who US intelligence says is a Kremlin ploy you serve like a well trained beast. You are a perfect sample of the @gop on-paper patriot the Heel spur Fuhrer attracts.
919263174142185474 2017-10-14 18:06:34 UTC <willsmithfocus> @nowthisnews It's time for the US to stop honoring people who wanted to break it up and keep humans enslaved for profit; even if some wish they had won.

899092378635698177 2017-08-19 02:15:02 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ElDub81 I assume that is because they don't know the context and are inflamed by racists. The point is PoC want equal justice. No more.

802579193670365188 2016-11-26 18:26:05 UTC <willsmithfocus> @SonicDeanBoom Insulting me doesn't make your point. If you think it was fake okay. Let's leave it at that

802526154645237761 2016-11-26 14:55:20 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ReneSaldanaJr Why don't you+the GOP do it? Trump said "many many times" there was fraud+he'd challenge. But not now. Hm... @DrJillStein
802523490758717440 2016-11-26 14:44:45 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ChillinBos Sure. If I wanted more proof the DP did wrong or I gave a damn about OKeefe @DrJillStein @evaldez6457 @GeenaJagger
802521469116882945 2016-11-26 14:36:43 UTC <willsmithfocus> I'm not arguing with you. I didn't see it. I didn't examine the video. But he is a hack @GeenaJagger @ChillinBos @DrJillStein
802516754245287937 2016-11-26 14:17:58 UTC <willsmithfocus> No idea. But it's not bullshit he's a hack. If he was a broken clock this time he was @GeenaJagger @ChillinBos @DrJillStein
802516073706848256 2016-11-26 14:15:16 UTC <willsmithfocus> O'Keefe was fined 100000 for his fake ACORN video. He is a professional hack not a source @GeenaJagger @ChillinBos @DrJillStein
802514334656167938 2016-11-26 14:08:22 UTC <willsmithfocus> @GeenaJagger Maybe. Id be depressed to find he legit appealed to so many but I can't say you're wrong @evaldez6457 @ChillinBos @DrJillStein
802513815988563968 2016-11-26 14:06:18 UTC <willsmithfocus> @paulkrugman @thehuntinghouse We don't know what Trump did bc Wiki didn't leak on him but obviously no one can deny the DP did @jj5barry
802387876344434688 2016-11-25 05:45:52 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ChillinBos We may all find out exactly who is scamming+who was scammed very soon @DrJillStein
802386678790885376 2016-11-25 05:41:06 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ChillinBos Look on the bright side. Maybe we'll find all those voter fraud guys Trump kept telling everyone about @DrJillStein
802386431129755648 2016-11-25 05:40:07 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ChillinBosLook And if you believed that you'd be laughing not angry or fighting. @DrJillStein
802384862372069376 2016-11-25 05:33:53 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ChillinBos For good reason dont compound it now by fighting an investigation your candidate demanded until he won @DrJillStein
802384378580127744 2016-11-25 05:31:58 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ChillinBos Except when Trump brought it up. And said there was lots of fraud. Apparently he no longer thinks so @DrJillStein
802384045183221760 2016-11-25 05:30:38 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ChillinBos You guys? Who guys? We guys ran against BOTH of you two guys+I don't think that came up @DrJillStein

802379724475498496 2016-11-25 05:13:28 UTC <willsmithfocus> @WoobieTuesday @PollyTickal It's an ambitious attempt at 1984ing the 2016 election but um we were all there
802374354436784129 2016-11-25 04:52:08 UTC <willsmithfocus> @WoobieTuesday Yeah tbh that's what I'm assuming too. They just got out-cheated. So telling that suddenly nobody wants to look @rtyson82
802372682834735108 2016-11-25 04:45:29 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ChillinBos Then why do you care? And I seem to recall Trump talk about many kinds of fraud. So let's just see @DrJillStein
802371960361648128 2016-11-25 04:42:37 UTC <willsmithfocus> @WoobieTuesday @rtyson82 Here's an idea: why don't they get THEIR sainted candidate to do it? Then they can investigate WithHer @DrJillStein
802370490803355648 2016-11-25 04:36:46 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ChillinBos Particularly now Trump fans seem to hate the idea of investigating election irregularities. Oh well @DrJillStein
802369755923546112 2016-11-25 04:33:51 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ChillinBos There is no overlap btw Trump's agenda+@DrJillStein's. That seems obvious but if you just realized it now you know
802369047702577152 2016-11-25 04:31:02 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ksenapathy @LauriLinnea Staying on topic. Anyway you're still satisfied w Hillary I'm proud of @DrJillStein. Let's just leave it at that

802299587126001664 2016-11-25 23:55:02 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ksenapathy @LauriLinnea I support sticking to the topic. Where do you stand on that issue? @DrJillStein
802297833273470976 2016-11-25 23:48:04 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ksenapathy @LauriLinnea Ma'am it's not 2001. And she lost. To Donald Trump. Maybe you should listen a bit more+sigh a bit less @DrJillStein
802296330936877057 2016-11-25 23:42:05 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ksenapathy @LauriLinnea And it's a drop in her ocean. Instead of accepting that Dems tried to fool all the ppl all the time @DrJillStein
802295757982367745 2016-11-25 23:39:49 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ksenapathy @LauriLinnea She lost bc most people think giving public jobs to people who donate to your foundation is outrageous @DrJillStein
802264313746571264 2016-11-25 21:34:52 UTC <willsmithfocus> @rharrisonfries Riiiight. Why would Soros risk being an international hero by publicly funding her? So this is what Anonymous is now. Tragic
802256395060051969 2016-11-25 21:03:24 UTC <willsmithfocus> @paulkrugman Except the ones who were too good to do press conferences for most of their campaign. And those who limited debates @jj5barry
802254387540213760 2016-11-25 20:55:25 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ksenapathy @LauriLinnea You can't become squeamish when everyone has a stake when you did whatever you felt like for yourself @DrJillStein
802252755222007808 2016-11-25 20:48:56 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ksenapathy @LauriLinnea I get your pov but she gave foundation donors ambassadorships. She can demand election accountabiliity @DrJillStein

798297165227397121 2016-11-14 22:50:50 UTC <willsmithfocus> @amozu16 @M_Caba86 @UniteForPower @WoobieTuesday I didnt spend a year telling people not to follow someone blindly just to do the same thing
798290956915183620 2016-11-14 22:26:10 UTC <willsmithfocus> Odd. No "conservative" groups. I could have sworn the people who voted for #ConAlt Trump weren't racists+bigots  http://cnn.it/2fO4zel
798202344026488833 2016-11-14 16:34:03 UTC <willsmithfocus> @SilERabbit Say. Remember all those things that were only going to be released after the election? Oops.  
798200776917139456 2016-11-14 16:27:49 UTC <willsmithfocus> Good. You shake hands with the devil you get what you deservehttps://twitter.com/jonfranks/status/797975490526998528
798013133520601088 2016-11-13 04:02:12 UTC <willsmithfocus> @keithellison @WoobieTuesday @OmanReagan I am saying it. His foreign policy is just Hillary with hugs. Pass
798007718124494848 2016-11-13 03:40:40 UTC <willsmithfocus> If you voted for him+youre not a racist+bigot let Trump+the world know THIS isnt what you signed off onhttp://theconcourse.deadspin.com/donald-trump-names-his-most-racist-friendly-advisor-to-1788932041?utm_medium=sharefromsite&utm_source=The_Concourse_twitter
797968027258130432 2016-11-13 01:02:57 UTC <willsmithfocus> @WoobieTuesday @exiledsurfer Don't be silly. #ConAlt will just use his bankruptcy+not paying taxes tricks. That should take care of it 
797959391408521220 2016-11-13 00:28:38 UTC <willsmithfocus> I know I'm tough now but expect more. It was never a good idea to make racists+bigots feel okay about it. Now that will doom US
797953156512555009 2016-11-13 00:03:52 UTC <willsmithfocus> Unless they are going to say "Sorry we ignored your warnings about Hillary for year. Please tell us what to do." who needs it
797942548329156608 2016-11-13 23:21:43 UTC <willsmithfocus> And now a word from our sponsors...https://twitter.com/MRGDII/status/791054509426348032

797931595269369856 2016-11-13 22:38:11 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealTimBlack @uglyhotdog I try to only blame people for what they do or don't. That why his repudiation of the hate groups is so important
797929397516845056 2016-11-13 22:29:27 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RoseAnnDeMoro @OurRevolution @GodandtheBear @xyzlobez @WoobieTuesday @FlowWithTheGo81 One would think theyd have their own or none.Just odd
797928134523895808 2016-11-13 22:24:26 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealTimBlack @uglyhotdog I wouldn't say so if he recants. A strong statement followed by strong action vs. racism+bigotry would be good too
797927735469473792 2016-11-13 22:22:51 UTC <willsmithfocus> @WoobieTuesday Another interesting thread in this messed up tapestry @FlowWithTheGo81 @xyzlobez @GodandtheBear @OurRevolution @RoseAnnDeMoro

797923715304529922 2016-11-13 22:06:53 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealTimBlack @uglyhotdog I won't say I'll be good because his racist history goes back before the primary but It'll be more than I expected
797923358146957312 2016-11-13 22:05:27 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealTimBlack @uglyhotdog If he recants his statements, repudiates his hate group cheerleaders+never does what he said he would
797917717537947652 2016-11-13 21:43:03 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ninaturner @DaveKaps If they weren't aiming the punches at BS+Nina to begin with we'd be having a very different conversation
797917171670253568 2016-11-13 21:40:52 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealTimBlack @uglyhotdog My moral compass pointed me away from racism+bigotry & dishonesty+war mongering.Everyone has a choice
797913774418182144 2016-11-13 21:27:22 UTC <willsmithfocus> @BenJealous @ninaturner @YoHi64 @DaveKaps Yeah people seem to forget that. Now battle is over here he comes to lead the charge
797913462718480384 2016-11-13 21:26:08 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ninaturner @DaveKaps Well if it matter she seems to be one of a very few who didn't let anyone down at any time for any reason
797911149123670016 2016-11-13 21:16:57 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow @OmanReagan Sounds like a challenge 
797909202463166464 2016-11-13 21:09:12 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow Man what the hell? Stick to policies  GP would be happy if the DP did it's damn job. GP is against winner take all remember?
797905515980300288 2016-11-13 20:54:34 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealTimBlack @uglyhotdog My point is everyone who glosses over his racism+bigotry, as you just did, is a party to it. Good ppl dont do that
797902590486913024 2016-11-13 20:42:56 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ninaturner @DaveKaps @YoHi64 People who stand by principles no matter what are rare.If DP doesnt promote her we certainly will
797901885575294976 2016-11-13 20:40:08 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealTimBlack @uglyhotdog Actually neither of us supported Hillary+those were 2 of the reasons. Different topic from supporter violence tho
797900685891305472 2016-11-13 20:35:22 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow I love you man but I agree w/Jimmy. Guys like "lets war with Iran" Schumer have been themselves way too long to join revolution
797899595745349632 2016-11-13 20:31:02 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ninaturner @DaveKaps @joshua_legters And it's a hell of an embarrassing shameful way to lose
797894440966754304 2016-11-13 20:10:33 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ninaturner @DaveKaps @YoHi64 I dunno. Im going Green so it's not my fight but I think she's earned a battlefield promotion
797894196405424128 2016-11-13 20:09:35 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ninaturner @DaveKaps Neoliberal right? Yes I agree especially in this case their condemnation is a recommendation
797893028610506753 2016-11-13 20:04:56 UTC <willsmithfocus> @scriptsbysg I'd be surprised if the meant all of them but it's no surprise that dudes who obsesses over homosexuality turn out to be gay
797892450681491458 2016-11-13 20:02:39 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ninaturner @DaveKaps If you mean NT I think you've got it wrong. I believe she lost convention status for refusing endorse HRC
797890396940599296 2016-11-13 19:54:29 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealTimBlack @uglyhotdog Buying a book about nazis doesnt make you a nazi. Voting for someone who promises to ban an entire ppl/religion...
797889776397365248 2016-11-13 19:52:01 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealTimBlack @uglyhotdog You can't. #ConAlt personally excused violence offering to pay legal fees & sold hate+fear+rage almost exclusively
797887247932526593 2016-11-13 19:41:58 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealTimBlack @uglyhotdog Which thing?
797861113794850820 2016-11-13 17:58:07 UTC <willsmithfocus> @vets4bernie Next time maybe they'll have someone who doesn't have so many fatal flaws the best they can do is ask ppl not to bring them up

797841563179253760 2016-11-13 16:40:26 UTC <willsmithfocus> @realDonaldTrump @WoobieTuesday @rjpct That'd be a shocking+good 1st step
797841011821121540 2016-11-13 16:38:15 UTC <willsmithfocus> @MaggieMeade1 In her own way, Hillary was as much a reality star as he is
797840848427843584 2016-11-13 16:37:36 UTC <willsmithfocus> @MaggieMeade1 You cant call someone who thinks they can have a secure govt server+has been consistently wrong on foreign policy a technocrat
797833913385226241 2016-11-13 16:10:02 UTC <willsmithfocus> @WoobieTuesday @scapelliti Just stop funding them. If a nation is set on conquest the least US pols can do is not volunteer to pay for it
797829764417523713 2016-11-13 15:53:33 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Fredric_Ward @ActualFlatticus @WoobieTuesday A no-fly zone+ US world cop. Apparently I am still shockable
797827608180355072 2016-11-13 15:44:59 UTC <willsmithfocus> @leslieleeiii @aschops For decades of service Bernie gets a free pass. Im saying dont take the conversion of ppl who hated him at face value
797826711970779136 2016-11-13 15:41:25 UTC <willsmithfocus> @leslieleeiii @aschops Maybe. It wouldnt shock me. But then whats changed? Hillary was just one tool. Her masters will find another+another
797821416888475648 2016-11-13 15:20:23 UTC <willsmithfocus> @BernieArtists @WaywardWinifred tbh I love it. It shows ppl inside+outside the US isnt totally lost+it gets ppl primed for 4 years of battle
797817410363465728 2016-11-13 15:04:28 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RobinHoodTax @SacredStoneCamp First thing to do is the #crayonboxtest to determine if he was a criminal or just defending himself [sarcasm]
797815885511663616 2016-11-13 14:58:24 UTC <willsmithfocus> @WoobieTuesday @scapelliti You can't "aid" a nation that doesn't need aid. You can only subsidize their destruction+lawlessness
797815138501922816 2016-11-13 14:55:26 UTC <willsmithfocus> @leslieleeiii Bernie backed Hillary+raises money for the DP. It is not only safe but useful for everybody who dumped on him to kiss his ass
797813700077953029 2016-11-13 14:49:43 UTC <willsmithfocus> @BBCNewsnight You can open mouth. If racist things come out people will call you a racist. It's actually not that complicated
797811879741628417 2016-11-13 14:42:29 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow Defense of Hillary's dishonest+finally disastrous career embodied privilege just as excusing #ConAlt's venom does

797655016794423296 2016-11-12 04:19:10 UTC <willsmithfocus> @WoobieTuesday @zachhaller Bullshit. All the Left did for decades was debate accommodate+capitulate. As the Right marched right in. Fuck him
797646089532960768 2016-11-12 03:43:41 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ShaunKing @SocialIssueNews @tiffmc1013 I am also tired of watching AA tears wash away the guilt of others. Let them feel it from now on

797186638279479297 2016-11-11 21:18:00 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow A year of Trump's angry rhetoric+Generations of overwhelmingly peaceful protest+the left+right traded places overnight. Bullshit
797175307652501504 2016-11-11 20:32:58 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ninaturner @BenJealous First provide examples of disciplined focused leaders who dont lose the series then tell others how to play the game
797168404025184256 2016-11-11 20:05:32 UTC <willsmithfocus> That would be laws. Not felonies. Just say what you mean straight out because I'm still not sure I follow you
797168065284866048 2016-11-11 20:04:12 UTC <willsmithfocus> If you are describing Nazi culture or zealot culture you are using the word a little differently that I was
797165887874879490 2016-11-11 19:55:32 UTC <willsmithfocus> If you use "culture" to describe national power structures yes they value particular features more. What do you mean felon?
797158404611510272 2016-11-11 19:25:48 UTC <willsmithfocus> The protests are real. I saw a HUGE one with my own eyes. But any violence needs to be closely examined. It's just not our m.o.
797152865890529280 2016-11-11 19:03:48 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealTimBlack Even the murders by cops how many riots compared to the killings? Our go to is to have a meeting to set a date for the meeting
797151530461892608 2016-11-11 18:58:29 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RealTimBlack Honestly I'm not buying the alt-lft. Feels false flag to me. The real left just isnt wired for anarchy even ones who can fight

797138030427566080 2016-11-11 18:04:51 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow Also, how about the over 60% of white men+over 50% of white women who voted FOR HIM. Gezzus Mice. Projection much?
797136441004490752 2016-11-11 17:58:32 UTC <willsmithfocus> You're right. Race is incorrect; but we have come to use it to mean ethnic background often distinguishable by appearance
797136061151514628 2016-11-11 17:57:01 UTC <willsmithfocus> I don't mind. Yes I do.
797135770075152384 2016-11-11 17:55:52 UTC <willsmithfocus> I meant you in the general sense. Not you personally+I think racism is pretty clear everywhere tho I was talking about US

796948522964750336 2016-11-10 05:31:49 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow Voters don't care who they vote for. That's why Hillary got Bernie's crowds after the...oh no wait. That didnt happen. Nevermind
796944371618877440 2016-11-10 05:15:19 UTC <willsmithfocus> @WoobieTuesday For example you can do a sit-in for gun legislation but you need to stay there till you get some not just for the news cycle

796931581826961409 2016-11-10 04:24:30 UTC <willsmithfocus> No one should excuse racism or make racists feel it is acceptable in any way. If you agree with that we agree.
796922573925863424 2016-11-10 03:48:42 UTC <willsmithfocus> @GreenPartyUS @marclamonthill She lost to Donald Trump. Not 1 in 1000 candidates could have done that. There is no way to blame anyone else
796918998977888257 2016-11-10 03:34:30 UTC <willsmithfocus> Maybe if every day wasn't #HugARacist Day in the US people would understand those views are unacceptable+leave them behind ffs

796912025624518656 2016-11-10 03:06:47 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Mac4RFW It's called lying. Look that one up in your dictionary. I think we're done. Thanks for the talk.

796867124086132738 2016-11-10 00:08:22 UTC <willsmithfocus> @durancevile @Mac4RFW From their comments the media is telling viewers it has learned exactly the wrong lesson. Now it is whitewashing Trump
796864171929456640 2016-11-10 23:56:38 UTC <willsmithfocus> @durancevile @Mac4RFW That's just off the top of my head. So I am Baffled by the notion that calling Trump racist is using the word cheaply
796863765035778048 2016-11-10 23:55:01 UTC <willsmithfocus> @durancevile @Mac4RFW Directing voter rage at illegal imm "taking jobs" not illegal employers exploiting cheap labor is racist+stupid+slimy
796861616293871616 2016-11-10 23:46:28 UTC <willsmithfocus> @durancevile @Mac4RFW Saying you only want Jews to do your books BECAUSE having AAs do it makes you nervous is a racist combo
796861265113124864 2016-11-10 23:45:05 UTC <willsmithfocus> @durancevile @Mac4RFW Saying the CenPk5, exonerated on DNA Evidence must be guilty is racist. Calling for banning Muslims/Islam is racist
796859172029661184 2016-11-10 23:36:46 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow *shhhh* Yeah! Make Hilda President! Right on! You tell em man!

796855987680509952 2016-11-10 23:24:06 UTC <willsmithfocus> @durancevile @Mac4RFW The media failed but not because they should have pretended Trump isnt a vile racist who attracts same

792929938164817926 2016-10-30 03:23:23 UTC <willsmithfocus> @relombardo3 @Caboodlennm It's an analogy. The govt is our "fire dept" it is how we all protect our "house" and all have a say

792918404172840960 2016-10-30 02:37:33 UTC <willsmithfocus> @relombardo3 @Caboodlennm Then you will have corps that are not elected+cannot be thrown out of office exercising the same amount of power

790753568907231232 2016-10-24 03:15:16 UTC <willsmithfocus> Or it won't matter, like now, because he says what they want and the org w/his brand does what they do (e.g. take big money).
790752019296423936 2016-10-24 03:09:07 UTC <willsmithfocus> They cheated him of his nomination in broad daylight and have yet to pay. Why wouldnt they just cheat him again?

775109421894598656 2016-09-11 23:11:01 UTC <willsmithfocus> So, would you prefer to believe #Hillary has pneumonia and and thoughtlessly risked giving it to a child or that her campaign lied? Again
775091613286760449 2016-09-11 22:00:15 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow I'm sure the outrage from #Hillary supporters that don't want to taint Obama's legacy will start any minute now. Yep. Any minute

775080280768077825 2016-09-11 21:15:13 UTC <willsmithfocus> @MaggieMeade1 The subtle stuff is interesting. Media using happy pics instead of the clear images of her seizing. Trump not jumping on it

774066208349880320 2016-09-08 02:05:40 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Honest_Hillary There is nothing like hiring the person who had to resign for rigging your primary to send a message of election integrity
774065268280614912 2016-09-08 02:01:56 UTC <willsmithfocus> @MaggieMeade1 The media that acts like emails (and math) showing her primary was rigged & destroyed evidence in a FBI investigation is fine?

766386640365420544 2016-08-18 21:29:48 UTC <willsmithfocus> @OccupyWallStNYC @KeeganNYC It increasingly appears that DP exists to quietly do the real dirty while the GOP barks and waves shiny objects.
766369660254248960 2016-08-18 20:22:20 UTC <willsmithfocus> @KickinBrassApp What else do they have in common? They are played by people who can tell the difference btw a movie and reality
766340011264450560 2016-08-18 18:24:31 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Jules8_11 @HerminoSilva a) It was a joke b) obviously you are a fan so -whaat? c) Lighten up. Go find a real problem to solve
766332994873352196 2016-08-18 17:56:38 UTC <willsmithfocus> @VancityReynolds @Jules8_11 That's what I'm talking about! In your face Deadpool! Which honestly just adds insult to injury.
766331486748479488 2016-08-18 17:50:38 UTC <willsmithfocus> @SilentCutie0 @IGotThatAim @NoahCrazy3 Nice job!
766329599294865408 2016-08-18 17:43:08 UTC <willsmithfocus> @the_realknight  Slightly crazy female super villains are more my speed. Back up ears. Don't make me shoot you. (Take care!)
766324422328328192 2016-08-18 17:22:34 UTC <willsmithfocus> See the movie everyone is talking about.  Again.https://twitter.com/SuicideSquadWB/status/764134240430624769
766323613951791104 2016-08-18 17:19:21 UTC <willsmithfocus> @the_realknight Well I am afraid. I'm afraid you got bad taste in clothes. But you got skills I'll be sorry when I eventually kill your ass
766322821903638528 2016-08-18 17:16:12 UTC <willsmithfocus> @the_realknight Don't ever talk about my family. What kind of family you got going around dressed like that? And anybody can get lucky once
766321378962337792 2016-08-18 17:10:28 UTC <willsmithfocus> @the_realknight You're fast. But your boy is the 1 faster than a bullet and I heard you shot him. I'm a little better than you. No offense 
766320483939807233 2016-08-18 17:06:55 UTC <willsmithfocus> @VexingLilJester It's complicated 
766320362631999488 2016-08-18 17:06:26 UTC <willsmithfocus> @THRE375 Bad puns with good intentions accepted at the window
766319789253853184 2016-08-18 17:04:09 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow Well said.
766319227758219265 2016-08-18 17:01:56 UTC <willsmithfocus> @the_realknight But maybe I'll just get you in the leg or something. I kinda like the idea of a crippled bat trying to fight some crime 
766318763721367552 2016-08-18 17:00:05 UTC <willsmithfocus> @the_realknight How do you know I won't take you out as soon as you step out of it? Spoiler alert: I will 
766317569468993537 2016-08-18 16:55:20 UTC <willsmithfocus> @the_realknight We'll see. You'll have to catch me first. And I have really good eyes. Comes with the aim 
766317009860698112 2016-08-18 16:53:07 UTC <willsmithfocus> @the_realknight Don't mess with me ears. You know why I gave you a pass. It was a one time thing. I don't see any armor on your mouth. ( )
766297103765213184 2016-08-18 15:34:01 UTC <willsmithfocus> @MargotRobbie @KClarkzz @clarewalkerc30 I hope kodi is the name of the theatre you went to.   The more fan support the more fun movies 
766137587526402048 2016-08-17 05:00:09 UTC <willsmithfocus> @mickeyvaleska Must be hard to make a really sweet meme about leaving a girl to drown or electrocuting her
765778310383165440 2016-08-16 05:12:31 UTC <willsmithfocus> @JunoCassandra Me too. Although the idea of Harley driving could make even a suicidal person very nervous 
765226303368945670 2016-08-15 16:39:02 UTC <willsmithfocus> @makecomicsgreat Ppl get stuck in a narrative & spin everything that way. This movie w/ relatively unknown Bad Guys made 465M global/10 days
765216462298570753 2016-08-15 15:59:56 UTC <willsmithfocus> @shigenketz Good start. The only way to hit a target, any goal you have in your mind, is keep practicing 
764859658125402112 2016-08-14 16:22:07 UTC <willsmithfocus> If a lot of people go see it there is going to be a lot of incentive for everyone involved

764628140756967424 2016-08-13 01:02:09 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow @therealsimmdogg A comic book on film. I honestly love what David Ayer did. Don't bring expectations. Just experience & enjoy it

764581884030488576 2016-08-13 21:58:21 UTC <willsmithfocus> @SuicideSquadWB @dotswap Worth it 
764578593955540992 2016-08-13 21:45:16 UTC <willsmithfocus> @BeantownBop Unless you accept that "terrorism" is not being used as a definition of an action just justification of a reaction
764576146440720384 2016-08-13 21:35:33 UTC <willsmithfocus> @iovelyjoshler Scream: OGGY OGGY OGGY SQUAD SQUAD SQUAD OGGY SQUAD OGGY SQUAD If its a real skwad crowd they'll know to say the SQUAD parts
764569118678913024 2016-08-13 21:07:37 UTC <willsmithfocus> @DykstraDame @BeantownBop War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Organizations that expose corruption and murder are terrorists.
764557003469549569 2016-08-13 20:19:29 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow @crushingbort Exit polls were removed to help tyrant steal her primary. Then the fascist sends observers. Writer is a genius
764542211958640640 2016-08-13 19:20:42 UTC <willsmithfocus> Great work 
764540902966714370 2016-08-13 19:15:30 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow @therealsimmdogg I'm legitimately surprised. This seems like one of the few things even #Trump supporters would find offensive.
764539817778638848 2016-08-13 19:11:11 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow Could be the wars. The looking into your eyes lies. The destruction of the Dem identity. The rigged primary. Just off the top

764536797502332928 2016-08-13 18:59:11 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow It's a good thing there are no memes. That would be awkward.
764535489009516544 2016-08-13 18:53:59 UTC <willsmithfocus> @durancevile @mtracey Remember when we could make fun of Mitt Romney and his "charities"? Yeah. Good times.
764532795674943488 2016-08-13 18:43:17 UTC <willsmithfocus> @SuicideSquadWB @JonConfer Do you know what's bad about this? I JUST realized what you were talking about 
764532071880617984 2016-08-13 18:40:24 UTC <willsmithfocus>  Accurate

764510156919046144 2016-08-13 17:13:19 UTC <willsmithfocus> @TimBartender But I think #JillStein has a chance. The same chance #Berine had when people who agreed voted for him, not a lesser candidate.
764509310059745282 2016-08-13 17:09:58 UTC <willsmithfocus> @TimBartender Too real as always Tim. Keep up the great work.

764452869034676224 2016-08-13 13:25:41 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Walmart @Forbes @WoobieTuesday Walmart legacy is single handedly lowering the US present & expected standard of living for profit.

764447531304624128 2016-08-13 13:04:28 UTC <willsmithfocus> @BernieArtists @LouiseDeKoven In the end it's the old evil of two lessers stuff but the soft soap is sweet.
764445841499230208 2016-08-13 12:57:45 UTC <willsmithfocus> @BernieArtists @LouiseDeKoven The 6% dip doesnt mean millennials are fickle; it means 96% re-upped despite 4 years of contempt & dismissal.
764441533466677248 2016-08-13 12:40:38 UTC <willsmithfocus> @DrJillStein And rationale. It's easy to tell people US is vs. them when bombs from US planes/paid for by US tax payers are falling on them.

764115978674401280 2016-08-12 15:07:00 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RobinHoodTax Turns out the "free market" is really expensive for Americans when the government watching over it is for sale.

762479205170851840 2016-08-07 02:43:03 UTC <willsmithfocus> @MaggieMeade1 @lyz_estrada I get it. Tim Kaine is the real sith lord . #Hillary is just the apprentice...with a serious health issue...

762409513576202241 2016-08-07 22:06:07 UTC <willsmithfocus> @SenSanders We also have lots of election fraud. Punishable by getting a nomination or being hired to chair a national campaign

762282728884699136 2016-08-07 13:42:19 UTC <willsmithfocus> @_Malikalovess The DP had a path to landslide victory with progressive values & no obligations to corps/rich donors. It cheated to say no.
762115104976605184 2016-08-06 02:36:15 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow Maybe it would be good to focus on getting police to stop killing people and let the world police the world. Just a thought.
762114557057835008 2016-08-06 02:34:04 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow And the Putin agents are revealing the illegal stuff the US government does. The new X-Files is fantastic!

762087922925498370 2016-08-06 00:48:14 UTC <willsmithfocus> @keidekay I think the prospect of pressure sex w/ Bill probably does that.
762087196270661633 2016-08-06 00:45:21 UTC <willsmithfocus> @SuicideSquadWB I don't know what you're talking about. Ask me again in a couple of months

759906421949497344 2016-07-31 00:19:44 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Honest_Hillary Which is why they forced her down DP's throat. Bc she knows how to handle the media, I mean can't handle it. So confusing...

759571766910054400 2016-07-30 02:09:56 UTC <willsmithfocus> @durancevile @KiranOpal My point is every guilty person is not guilty of everything. & #Hillary learned from Bill. She says as much. Proudly
759571373215911936 2016-07-30 02:08:22 UTC <willsmithfocus> @durancevile @KiranOpal I agree the difference between GOP & Dem policy (privatization, war, militarized police) boils down to packaging.
759569583896465408 2016-07-30 02:01:15 UTC <willsmithfocus> @durancevile @KiranOpal I don't defend Obama's bad calls but he didn't train her and as far any of us could see won primary& election fairly
759567589416792064 2016-07-30 01:53:20 UTC <willsmithfocus> @durancevile @KiranOpal I'm not sure that's true. But she had a terrible mentor in Bill. And frankly she started out a Goldwater Girl so...
759566847368892416 2016-07-30 01:50:23 UTC <willsmithfocus> @durancevile @KiranOpal I might have almost bought that excuse if #Bernie hadn't been demonstrating in real time you don't have to cheat.
759564861600702464 2016-07-30 01:42:29 UTC <willsmithfocus> @KiranOpal @durancevile Is this what the fight was for? To have a woman as corrupt as any man that came before? That's victory?

759560718261817344 2016-07-30 01:26:01 UTC <willsmithfocus> @durancevile Never apologize for being involved. You're the best.

759554041953255424 2016-07-30 00:59:30 UTC <willsmithfocus> @durancevile @KiranOpal Where is Madeline Albright when you need her? My guess? A special place in hell.  
759553101842055169 2016-07-30 00:55:45 UTC <willsmithfocus> Hey #DNC, you can run fake primaries if you want but you need to give the people their real money back #Demexit https://twitter.com/RoseAnnDeMoro/status/759542893950410756
759551215554465793 2016-07-30 00:48:16 UTC <willsmithfocus> @DykstraDame @katalin_pota Hope so but this is #GalCapone. She tried to give a national security job to a high donor & she's still very free
759549541502840832 2016-07-30 00:41:37 UTC <willsmithfocus> Turns out you can't sell a pile of shit even with a week long commercial for it #DemsInPhilly #Demexit https://twitter.com/SupaScoopa_/status/759196440920858624
759533595052634112 2016-07-30 23:38:15 UTC <willsmithfocus> @durancevile @TwoOneSix216 Step up. You don't punish someone for primary corruption by putting them in charge of the election. 
759531493995712513 2016-07-30 23:29:54 UTC <willsmithfocus> @PCGTW Why are they even in room? Who decided corps can pay as little taxes & as low wages as possible promise 0 jobs yet dictate US policy?
759530044507164672 2016-07-30 23:24:08 UTC <willsmithfocus> @BernieArtists @mtracey Number 1 reason #Demexit is necessary. Often bad things pass/ good things fail bc "3rd way" Dems vote with the GOP

759144290291507200 2016-07-29 21:51:17 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Conruthhoward I would argue the people who shrug at fake primaries & a candidate arms tyrants/sells national security jobs were never Dems
759142733856538628 2016-07-29 21:45:06 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Conruthhoward @jonny_is_good Soooo not worried about kids. It's the adults that need serious supervision.

759098234673430528 2016-07-29 18:48:17 UTC <willsmithfocus> I'd probably shoot him. A few times to be absolutely sure. Speaking as an assassin he's one of the few I might do for free 
759092461620854784 2016-07-29 18:25:20 UTC <willsmithfocus> Yeah that's a deep story. It's a funny joke. but the idea of Joker and Batman laughing together is unsettling 
759088866129244165 2016-07-29 18:11:03 UTC <willsmithfocus> Hm. Can't answer that one. You have to imagine wearing a full head mask like that. But Deadshot appreciates it

758917121095065600 2016-07-28 06:48:36 UTC <willsmithfocus> Let me put it this way, you'd have a hard time finding someone who plans better or adapts faster than I do 
758908618364231680 2016-07-28 06:14:49 UTC <willsmithfocus> I guess the second choice is go back & take care of the worst people who ever lived. I guess I could ask any price for that
758908503494799362 2016-07-28 06:14:21 UTC <willsmithfocus> Probably my own mistakes but then I'd never be Deadshot and never go back in time so I have a feeling you can't do that

758109481414844416 2016-07-26 01:19:20 UTC <willsmithfocus> Yes. I usually work alone. At least I used to. It's easier in some ways. You have a lot less to think about 
758105497010569216 2016-07-26 01:03:30 UTC <willsmithfocus> The #DemConvention is a loss but not one we can't take. We came from nothing and challenged most powerful. Tomorrow we start to do it again.

757992384672239616 2016-07-26 17:34:01 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Snowden @jacklgoldsmith I think the point is more that the hack revealed a completely rigged election and US democracy is a sham. Just me

757952916909072384 2016-07-26 14:57:12 UTC <willsmithfocus> @MalyndaNyc #HillaryClinton  fans ignore her intervention disasters, shady foundation, rigged election, etc. Is there any standard or limit?
757952610397741056 2016-07-26 14:55:59 UTC <willsmithfocus> @vets4bernie @davidcnswanson The world called: "Please try to tell us anything about democracy ever again. We need a laugh."  
757947248936452100 2016-07-26 14:34:40 UTC <willsmithfocus> @OccupyWallStNYC #BillClinton encouraged Birther #Trump to get into politics. If he wins blame his mentor.

757811141053603844 2016-07-25 05:33:50 UTC <willsmithfocus> @reghud @BenjySarlin Possibly the same way people who choose to ignore proof of vote rigging end up with a candidate tied with Donald Trump
757797289670774784 2016-07-25 04:38:47 UTC <willsmithfocus> The DNC rigged the primary essentially toying with millions of voters. Supporting their choice #Hillary is
757780846103453696 2016-07-25 03:33:27 UTC <willsmithfocus> @DykstraDame I doubt many of the Dem politicians will wait long to add a bunch of caveats to all those "agreements" or deny them outright
757779302427586562 2016-07-25 03:27:19 UTC <willsmithfocus> @BernieSanders @WoobieTuesday I expect them all to do that and I hope the super delegates decide they actually want to beat #Trump & switch
757778089803939840 2016-07-25 03:22:30 UTC <willsmithfocus> @DrJillStein Camera panned to #BillClinton clapping and smiling when #Bernie mentioned Citizens United. Bubba appreciates a good inside joke
757775696810938368 2016-07-25 03:12:59 UTC <willsmithfocus> @BernieSanders @HillaryClinton @WoobieTuesday Why not? They've already gotten all #Hillary wanted from him.
757773448731095046 2016-07-25 03:04:03 UTC <willsmithfocus> @WoobieTuesday No one sent #Bernie delegates to that convention to vote for #HillaryRottenClinton. I trust they will respectfully decline
757768730017460224 2016-07-25 02:45:18 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Ian_McK_ @SusanSarandon @BernieArtists Cowards. Black Box convention. How appropriate.
757766652293443585 2016-07-25 02:37:03 UTC <willsmithfocus> @BernieArtists When would have been a good time to reveal Dems rigged the primary & lied about that sabotage for months? 
757752621721653248 2016-07-25 01:41:18 UTC <willsmithfocus> @SarahKSilverman @cspan Right. Bc it's not ridiculous to sign off on primary rigging & nominate the most despised politician in the country.
757750587979100160 2016-07-25 01:33:13 UTC <willsmithfocus> Hm. He doesn't really have a style. He is just living destructive chaos. It'd be very rough but I think I'd win in the end 
757747456071327744 2016-07-25 01:20:46 UTC <willsmithfocus> You get used to it. They give you a really nice edge in terms of speed and preparedness 
757745702063710208 2016-07-25 01:13:48 UTC <willsmithfocus> Sorry. I felt like I didn't answer that last one clearly.
757745535902162944 2016-07-25 01:13:08 UTC <willsmithfocus> Katana would make a great action figure. I don't know why there isn't. She's cute but strict. I think she's had a hard life
757735929163448320 2016-07-25 00:34:58 UTC <willsmithfocus> @OccupyWallStNYC @rousseau_ist Ahh, they didn't. They apologized for being rude   and insisted we support the result of their subversion
757735198796738564 2016-07-25 00:32:04 UTC <willsmithfocus> Um, he's alright. He's got a lot of stuff going on with him though. Very complicated dude

757731208633679876 2016-07-25 00:16:12 UTC <willsmithfocus> Me, tbh I don't know anyone as good at hitting what they're aiming at as I am, forget better. And I know a lot of people.

757690999019827200 2016-07-25 21:36:26 UTC <willsmithfocus> @DykstraDame @OmanReagan The DP can sacrifice an almost unprecedentedly flawed & unpopular candidate & win or lose everything. Tough choice.

757674756850212865 2016-07-25 20:31:53 UTC <willsmithfocus> You have to make a very bad mistake. Then get stuck in a very bad deal with the government
757661118047383552 2016-07-25 19:37:41 UTC <willsmithfocus> @quick13 I think #Hilary does not meet your Willy Nilly Absolute standards. And reassigning #Debbie to work for  her proves it beyond doubt
757659640054308864 2016-07-25 19:31:49 UTC <willsmithfocus> @quick13 You just got up on a high horse & willie nilled so I need an answer. The DP cheated. The hacker hacked. Does everyone get punished?
757659080307646464 2016-07-25 19:29:36 UTC <willsmithfocus> @quick13 Ok if you believe that you believe the DP party cheated and #Hillary should concede. And the hacker should be in trouble. Right?
757658659065360384 2016-07-25 19:27:55 UTC <willsmithfocus> @quick13 Yeah you can. The FBI is investigating. They're good at investigating email issues & getting justice. Good luck. DP still cheated.
757657666206466048 2016-07-25 19:23:58 UTC <willsmithfocus> @quick13 I would love to find out GOP cheated for #Trump. It would renew my faith in human race. But it doesn't change DP did for #Hillary
757657529438666752 2016-07-25 19:23:26 UTC <willsmithfocus> @quick13 The facts themselves are not in question. And you can't argue for credibility in elections and support a candidate who has cheated.
757656777907372036 2016-07-25 19:20:27 UTC <willsmithfocus> @quick13 No. The DP defrauded millions of voters. THAT matters. HRC supporters don't care. THAT matters. Conspiracy deflections not so much.
757656361526292480 2016-07-25 19:18:47 UTC <willsmithfocus> @DykstraDame Yeah, that was nuts. They are mentally ill. I'm serious. They legit can't tell the difference between right and wrong behavior.
757655362040426496 2016-07-25 19:14:49 UTC <willsmithfocus> @DykstraDame @quick13 Bc it doesn't matter they're exposing DNC not smearing it. Frankly we assume GOP leaders are crooked as their policies
757646774228160513 2016-07-25 18:40:42 UTC <willsmithfocus> @vets4bernie @mankerlaw Nope. We're all sane af over here. The people who want to hand a stolen primary to a despised candidate not so much
757632333382057984 2016-07-25 17:43:19 UTC <willsmithfocus> @CoryBooker @TODAYshow @DykstraDame @LoveBeeGees And frankly it's a much bigger threat that DEMOCRATIC party "leaders" dont understand that
757629187805052928 2016-07-25 17:30:49 UTC <willsmithfocus> @vets4bernie @roycan79 They have demeaned him, mocked him, threatened him and they are cheating him and the country. What else can they do?
757627783329767424 2016-07-25 17:25:14 UTC <willsmithfocus> @SantanaCarlos @DykstraDame Wow. That is deep. Thank you for that tweet. 
757626212466454528 2016-07-25 17:18:59 UTC <willsmithfocus> @BernieSanders @vets4bernie This is why they don't like #Bernie. You don' get presidential libraries & fund donations talking smack about SA
757625457416216576 2016-07-25 17:15:59 UTC <willsmithfocus> @PeckerRed67 The ones directly pertaining to #BernieSanders yes. I would be very interested in her views after
757624595432210432 2016-07-25 17:12:34 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Perry_OB @roxannelwright @vets4bernie Good point. Saying #Hillary is good for US/world says you know nothing about her policies
757620315467964416 2016-07-25 16:55:33 UTC <willsmithfocus> @PeckerRed67 People use "obstruction" in odd ways. If you are pointing to clear proof of rigging what are you obstructing?

757606676996431873 2016-07-25 16:01:22 UTC <willsmithfocus> Well I usually use a scope of some kind I guess you've seen the eye patch? The whole mask has pluses & minuses

757592092743000065 2016-07-25 15:03:24 UTC <willsmithfocus> @MellowOchre Frankly Clinton Fdn tookfrom everybody & SoS #Hillary approved  to anybody but I meant their impact beyond obvious exchanges
757586114056163328 2016-07-25 14:39:39 UTC <willsmithfocus> @BernieSanders @OccupyWallStNYC @EduSamani Did they expect applause for turning the entire election into a farce? Psychopaths. All of them.
757581114756177920 2016-07-25 14:19:47 UTC <willsmithfocus> @DWStweets @vets4bernie @AbbyMartin Beyond being fired #Debbie should be facing serious legal repercussions just not by herself
757578382838206465 2016-07-25 14:08:56 UTC <willsmithfocus> @vets4bernie @NyniaChance Good article. Is the US ever going to try democracy or just keep trading one aristocracy for another in control?
757572285599510528 2016-07-25 13:44:42 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Dennis_Kucinich @vets4bernie @AmirAminiMD Clinton is fighting the last war & staring the next. She is in the wrong party, country & century
757570833061556224 2016-07-25 13:38:56 UTC <willsmithfocus> @MellowOchre @ChildOfAlba 3. They could not have done more damage to our political system & country if THEY were working for foreign powers.

757569951544832000 2016-07-25 13:35:26 UTC <willsmithfocus> @MellowOchre @ChildOfAlba Clintons have effectively destroyed both major parties. 1 Unleashing #Trump officially turning GOP into hate group

757563182928060416 2016-07-25 13:08:32 UTC <willsmithfocus> tbh the guys who report my adventures never copy my uniform exactly. They get to be creative & I keep my enemies guessing

757418762735878144 2016-07-24 03:34:39 UTC <willsmithfocus> Hm. That is the one downside to action figures. Sometimes they don't come with everything 
757415929835905024 2016-07-24 03:23:24 UTC <willsmithfocus> Mine obviously if you're going to get one. But only if you can afford it with no problem  
757411027420086272 2016-07-24 03:03:55 UTC <willsmithfocus> @mcveyseb Shoot him.  Sorry I didn't mean that. (Shoot him) 
757410217990688769 2016-07-24 03:00:42 UTC <willsmithfocus> Hm. Harley might. She can be chatty. But I don't think Joker. Unless he could use it in a scheme to do something horrible. 
757404571312480256 2016-07-24 02:38:16 UTC <willsmithfocus> Scary I won't lie. And you can tell he puts in the work training. But I don't think he's immortal. And I only need one shot
757401780942675969 2016-07-24 02:27:11 UTC <willsmithfocus> @HillaryClinton @presley243 Good point.

757390939740594176 2016-07-24 01:44:06 UTC <willsmithfocus> Movie maybe might even be with a certain scary crime fighter Netflix probably no (but you might a new show called "Bright")

757385635967725568 2016-07-24 01:23:01 UTC <willsmithfocus> Can't do it. It's hooked up to Google. That's giving up waaay too much tracking and info for my line of work 
757384466394406914 2016-07-24 01:18:22 UTC <willsmithfocus> And now a word from our sponsors #Debbie #DemConvention #Demexit #Bernie #ElectionFraud #SilenceofGood https://twitter.com/relombardo3/status/757082279487254528
757381440489349122 2016-07-24 01:06:21 UTC <willsmithfocus> @DykstraDame @MeaSongbird The leaders dont care. Whether #Trump yells the agenda or #Hillary lies about it we get war/martial law/more poor.
757374192836866048 2016-07-24 00:37:33 UTC <willsmithfocus> @DykstraDame @MeaSongbird She barely got a tie with the rigging AND the suppression AND the purging. DP is basically throwing the election.
757369612522647552 2016-07-24 00:19:21 UTC <willsmithfocus> @MellowOchre The lack of surprise, shame or outrage by the Democratic Party tells an even more disturbing story than the emails
757366028431228928 2016-07-24 00:05:07 UTC <willsmithfocus> @PollyTickal I'm sure Madeline Albright approves that message
757321606960144388 2016-07-24 21:08:36 UTC <willsmithfocus> @RoseAnnDeMoro It's like someone caught fixing sports matches resigned AFTER they gave the title to the cheaters & was hired their PR person
757318589187776512 2016-07-24 20:56:36 UTC <willsmithfocus> @vets4bernie @mankerlaw DWS has been a surrogate for you all along #Hillary instead of running a legitimate primary. That's the f*** problem
757304103567515652 2016-07-24 19:59:02 UTC <willsmithfocus> @DWStweets TPP is the endgame true. All policy debate is meaningless if that passes I just mean I still believe in democracy
757302684693176320 2016-07-24 19:53:24 UTC <willsmithfocus> You know I can't say democracy is dead. The DP won't survive if they pick HRC after all this but we can fight for democracy.
757276892378595329 2016-07-24 18:10:55 UTC <willsmithfocus> @vets4bernie @mankerlaw Yes. But a pawn can beat any piece if it picks its moment and a pawn can have any power if it keeps moving forward 
757270307832987648 2016-07-24 17:44:45 UTC <willsmithfocus> Whereas "headshot" is a real thing
757265315814334464 2016-07-24 17:24:55 UTC <willsmithfocus> Im not tweeting about #DemConvention bc there's nothing to say. I've had all the meaningless feel-good speeches I can take. Get to the vote.
757265162130907136 2016-07-24 17:24:18 UTC <willsmithfocus> @DWStweets @cassandra17lina "...to flatter us withal, make us partakers of a little gain, then now our loss might be ten times so much?"
757263648809181184 2016-07-24 17:18:17 UTC <willsmithfocus> The idea that a country many used to call an "Evil Empire" exposed US democracy as a sham just makes it worse 
757241152433160192 2016-07-24 15:48:54 UTC <willsmithfocus> @DykstraDame @WakeUpMFers So much for the myth of Comey the incorruptible defender of justice and freedom 
757235948690239488 2016-07-24 15:28:13 UTC <willsmithfocus> @mydelineation @deadpoolmovie I'm a better shot than either, funnier than Deathstroke and talk less than Deadpool but everybody does tbh

756877468036952064 2016-07-23 15:43:45 UTC <willsmithfocus> @TimBartender So will #HillarySoFair supporters have the class/integrity to apologize for mocking assertions of DNC/HRC collusion or nah?  
756876420035608576 2016-07-23 15:39:35 UTC <willsmithfocus> @TimBartender You have to finish ALL the kool-aid to blame a RW media conspiracy when you just read actual proof of a DNC media conspiracy.
756875231340457984 2016-07-23 15:34:51 UTC <willsmithfocus> @NateSilver538 @WoobieTuesday @AndyKirn Give Bernie nomination. Problem solved. If not blame DNC +Clintons who encouraged Trump in 1st place
756873302887587840 2016-07-23 15:27:12 UTC <willsmithfocus> @TimBartender & carrying water for DNC when they actually say they have to "keep the people ignorant" is what? Black power? 
756870283781369856 2016-07-23 15:15:12 UTC <willsmithfocus> @DykstraDame @RecoveredCons How could she win "fair and square" when the DNC was not just for her but actively against Bernie?
756678364543483904 2016-07-22 02:32:35 UTC <willsmithfocus> @suzettepetillo Hey Im up for it. We can't go on this way. We have officially reached rock bottom of this democratic experiment
756677306941407233 2016-07-22 02:28:23 UTC <willsmithfocus> #DNCleaks Dems, Repubs, Independents, we are seriously screwed. We don't want #Trump or #Clinton right? We really need to get together here.
756673476660957184 2016-07-22 02:13:09 UTC <willsmithfocus> @srburch1 You put that very delicately  
756671523419721729 2016-07-22 02:05:24 UTC <willsmithfocus> @srburch1 Wouldn't be much comfort after this but fair is fair
756669418718040064 2016-07-22 01:57:02 UTC <willsmithfocus> I almost feel sorry for you #HillaryClinton and #DNC apologists. You don't even know what democracy is.https://twitter.com/sanderswins/status/756621062926962688

756655347050438656 2016-07-22 01:01:07 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow If you assume he was talking about #Hillary and the #DNC the reaction makes sense doesn't it?
756654033327296512 2016-07-22 00:55:54 UTC <willsmithfocus> Wow. Twitter has REMOVED #DNCLeaks from trends and put up the stuff you're supposed to be talking about. No

756649673583190020 2016-07-22 00:38:34 UTC <willsmithfocus> #DNCLeaks When star tweet-feuds get breaking coverage but exposure of election fraud gets zero & you see what a matrix the media really is

756534956273364992 2016-07-22 17:02:43 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow @gruber "Conservative" pundits would hint broadly at the immorality of "certain groups" & denounce his recklessness/instability

756480989434707968 2016-07-22 13:28:17 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow Aside from HRC's wildly off exit polls she had at least 1 example of "adjusted" exit polls. Dont think GOP had any such scrutiny
756479492563038208 2016-07-22 13:22:20 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow Not to downplay stunning level of racism/facism but GOP uses same "black box" voting we do. No way to know if Trump win is legit
756463876414251008 2016-07-22 12:20:17 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Variety Great that people are getting & having fun but he makes a good point. This game is basically Big Brother's big brother
756463410934579200 2016-07-22 12:18:26 UTC <willsmithfocus> @theBpDShow @NNovacane Ironically the man was later shot by police for "getting uppitty" with police who pointed out he wasn't wearing shoes
756455874462355456 2016-07-22 11:48:29 UTC <willsmithfocus> @BernieArtists @tonybrasunas An ex-SoS who didn't even mention messed up exit polls & blatant election fraud was the last straw for me too.
756454449632215040 2016-07-22 11:42:49 UTC <willsmithfocus> @BernieArtists @tonybrasunas She also took donations from private prisons, personally pushed fracking, had her SoS schedule destroyed, etc.

756339541133422592 2016-07-21 04:06:13 UTC <willsmithfocus> @reghud @SteveRattner But maybe number one in spoiled rich ppl & their businesses avoiding taxes then complaining the country isn't great.

755842355131846656 2016-07-20 19:10:34 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Honest_Hillary Great article. Thank you.
755582389946945536 2016-07-19 01:57:34 UTC <willsmithfocus> @TammyKosiancic @saracohennyc @mindtraps @Noratoriou5 @durancevile Sounds good. I recommend this outlook.
755001714399408128 2016-07-18 11:30:10 UTC <willsmithfocus> @NomikiKonst Apology accepted. Take it easy. That's my point. We're all on the same side.
754923270739197952 2016-07-17 06:18:28 UTC <willsmithfocus> @NomikiKonst I was referring to you fucking cursing at me. That change. As I said. We've talked enough. You take care.
754920912013684736 2016-07-17 06:09:05 UTC <willsmithfocus> @NomikiKonst Your friends have had an unfortunate effect on you. Yes. I am. We're done now
754918669042511872 2016-07-17 06:00:11 UTC <willsmithfocus> @NomikiKonst If you say so, but you and I have no disagreements left so let's stop here.
754917802734133248 2016-07-17 05:56:44 UTC <willsmithfocus> @NomikiKonst But let me get this straight. You won't contact delegates which could get him the nom but you'll Write Him In?
754916609790242817 2016-07-17 05:52:00 UTC <willsmithfocus> @NomikiKonst Got it. Unity. False hope. Trump. Sounds very familiar buddy. It didn't work on me the first time
754916046902099968 2016-07-17 05:49:45 UTC <willsmithfocus> @NomikiKonst Arrogant how? Your pal uses HRC "Obey or Trump" talking points. Truth is not arrogant.pic.twitter.com/gOARrM2hCh
754912120043610112 2016-07-17 05:34:09 UTC <willsmithfocus> @NomikiKonst But that means flipping delegates and not antagonizing people who otherwise want the same things that you do.
754911425324343296 2016-07-17 05:31:24 UTC <willsmithfocus> @NomikiKonst Yes. Flip delegates. She is extremely vulnerable. Everybody can see it you can actually have President Sanders
754910428090761216 2016-07-17 05:27:26 UTC <willsmithfocus> @NomikiKonst He has spoken. He said vote for HRC. I won't. Most won't. I suggest you flip delegates but do what you want
754909184110592000 2016-07-17 05:22:29 UTC <willsmithfocus> @NomikiKonst Thanks I actually know the bio. So what is he now the mascot/messiah of the only "real" movement?
754905861714313220 2016-07-17 05:09:17 UTC <willsmithfocus> @NomikiKonst Sending is good. We also have to try to flip delegates bc we need to flip A LOT for him to have any chance.
754903058920923136 2016-07-17 04:58:09 UTC <willsmithfocus> @NomikiKonst Berners are bashing Bernie too. Do we fight everybody? We mocked HRC fans for elitism & scolding. Now its ok?

753770520508829696 2016-07-14 01:57:51 UTC <willsmithfocus> There is no holy war only faithless murderous criminals trying to start one and politicians who can't seem to help helping them
753760203041017856 2016-07-14 01:16:51 UTC <willsmithfocus> And its important because we are stunted thinking we started at the top. We started at the bottom. PLENTY of room to grow.
753759868935364610 2016-07-14 01:15:31 UTC <willsmithfocus> We have to honestly try democracy, clean transparent elections, publicly financed campaigns, etc first. Then we can judge.

753758128282427392 2016-07-14 01:08:36 UTC <willsmithfocus> Today the wealthy can essentially buy politicians at will. Democracy? 2 parties that don't represent anybody?

753752981519101952 2016-07-14 00:48:09 UTC <willsmithfocus> Well I'm not absolutely sure we've every really tried it.
753752306663972865 2016-07-14 00:45:28 UTC <willsmithfocus> True. Now that you mention it we have the worst of all. They do stuff in secret, get caught, & let themselves off the hook.
753751433225334784 2016-07-14 00:42:00 UTC <willsmithfocus> If they try to hide it they clearly still know the difference between right and wrong. It's when they don't...
753750640208281600 2016-07-14 00:38:51 UTC <willsmithfocus> Yeah. I'd actually prefer that. I much prefer a govt that tries to blame evil deeds on others than one that justifies them.
753748090943840256 2016-07-14 00:28:43 UTC <willsmithfocus>  
753747007332810752 2016-07-14 00:24:25 UTC <willsmithfocus> There is no such thing as a private emergency police force or backup military. That is what official forces are there for 
753744336022560768 2016-07-14 00:13:48 UTC <willsmithfocus> Sure. When things are running smooth, reverse career day, why not. But you have to do things right before you start sharing
753743996753702912 2016-07-14 00:12:27 UTC <willsmithfocus> @WoobieTuesday No problem. You're welcome
753743083871797248 2016-07-14 00:08:49 UTC <willsmithfocus> I agree. e.g. privatizing parts of the military was a huge, & when you think about it, pretty obvious mistake.
753740592555945984 2016-07-14 23:58:55 UTC <willsmithfocus> Its not like these are gray area events & its like "Come see what we do & how we do it." What they do is wrong
753740390675644417 2016-07-14 23:58:07 UTC <willsmithfocus> Yeah. I think I do. I would rather see all police have regular community meetings and consciously demilitarize
753737152836624384 2016-07-14 23:45:15 UTC <willsmithfocus> 1/ I feel very uneasy with the idea that AAs are advised to essentially register themselves with the police.

750844453909397505 2016-07-06 00:10:42 UTC <willsmithfocus> @beccamerlot Excusing murder/assault by some cops degrades all. It means undisciplined/fearful/out of control is the standard not exceptions

745780707197337602 2016-06-22 00:49:11 UTC <willsmithfocus> @mmolivieri If its that serious why are you at liberty? The secrecy means the criteria is whatever is decided in secret, serious or not
745776969380397060 2016-06-22 00:34:20 UTC <willsmithfocus> @mmolivieri A list of secret "crimes" or pre-crimes is extremely important
745776254524227584 2016-06-22 00:31:29 UTC <willsmithfocus> @mmolivieri That's not clever. If you're tired of talking lets just stop. There is no benefit & a lot of harm in keeping the criteria secret

745772872224903168 2016-06-22 00:18:03 UTC <willsmithfocus> @mmolivieri The article is speculating on the criteria. The actual criteria is secret. It should be public
745771066015027200 2016-06-22 00:10:52 UTC <willsmithfocus> @mmolivieri There is no reason for the criteria to be a secret. Its not like the people who can't fly don't know they're on it
745770911417118720 2016-06-22 00:10:15 UTC <willsmithfocus> @mmolivieri An error is ok. S* happens. If you send some kind of massive threat 2 bad 4 u. If the criteria is legit no one is going to argue
745769443595268096 2016-06-22 00:04:25 UTC <willsmithfocus> #NoBillNoBreak What about AWB? Does it really matter which type of crazy a killer is? Who can argue that any civilian needs that firepower?
745768138994819072 2016-06-22 23:59:14 UTC <willsmithfocus> #NoBillNoBreak What is the no fly list? Its not suspects being investigated its not known terrorists or associates. Its just an enemies list

745066963760721920 2016-06-20 01:33:01 UTC <willsmithfocus> @jj5barry Sure but not the NRA. Maybe people who have lots of stock in big guns and plenty of money. We focus on the NRA instead of them

743691153589997568 2016-06-16 06:26:02 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz Gotta go. We'll tweet again
743687223548141569 2016-06-16 06:10:25 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz Also people watch events (e.g. sports.) and create a hashtag so they can sort of talk about it with everybody else watching it
743685702332755970 2016-06-16 06:04:23 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz Sort of but not really. Sometimes there is sort of a national or even global "conversation" like # TPP Its the same principal
743685100190085121 2016-06-16 06:01:59 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz anyone who wants to talk about dogs types #Dogs in the search on top. Then they see all the "signs" and can join any conversation
743684093158686721 2016-06-16 05:57:59 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz No problemo. A hastag is kind of like having a conversation and holding a sign that says #Dogs
743682795931738112 2016-06-16 05:52:50 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz Thats happened to me. I once made a sarcastic comment & some guy jumped on it & got a lot of likes I do #sarcasm now or an emoji
743679536525500416 2016-06-16 05:39:53 UTC <willsmithfocus> @mcbyrne @BernieArtists  good one 
743678709631094784 2016-06-16 05:36:35 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz Im not sure we need mood control. A lot of this stuff is just people doing what they can. I believe we can choose to be better
743677941188485124 2016-06-16 05:33:32 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz Well that is true freedom. A lot of parents are going *lucky bum* even though they don't really mean it. Sort of 
743675350039695360 2016-06-16 05:23:14 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz You need to stop settling for jackasses when you want men because then boys who might have been good men choose to be jackasses
743672762628091904 2016-06-16 05:12:58 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz 1 Don't reward man-children but 2 Don't ask people filled w/testosterone to act like they're not
743671634964295684 2016-06-16 05:08:29 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz Well yeah definitely. Guys need good role models. Another part of it is women need to do two things that seem contradictory
743665613663539201 2016-06-16 04:44:33 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz Well yeah thats the thing. We've been talking about males who have never had to learn to be men.
743664217031643136 2016-06-16 04:39:00 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz Don't get me wrong. Being aggressive is a big part of being a guy but the difference btw a boy/a man is being able to turn it off

743661840660635648 2016-06-16 04:29:34 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz When I was a kid I thought so. Today I don't. Or I'll say I think being aggressive in the dopey way we often are appeals to many
743659405640630276 2016-06-16 04:19:53 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz Id only wound you.  It depends on the woman. If a woman is just as aggressive she only acts as cover for the same old behavior.
743658084288040960 2016-06-16 04:14:38 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz I think you hit on a key point. We allow WM violence to be seen as a right. Whether its cops or YallQadea. Its a terrible habit
743655224427032577 2016-06-16 04:03:16 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz Well i was about to say the problem is that disorientation comes with some SEVERE acting out that the US has always excused
743654194654085120 2016-06-16 03:59:11 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz 1. Yeah. For A LOT everybody suddenly demanding equal rank is traumatic. They'll actually say so pretty directly if you let them
743649956112785408 2016-06-16 03:42:20 UTC <willsmithfocus> @aybesea @Women4Bernie But steady drumbeat that Bernie somehow owes the DNC his contact list and help replacing the donations HRC hoarded
743649201981120513 2016-06-16 03:39:20 UTC <willsmithfocus> @lori_catz Maybe because US culture tolerates and excuses WM violence as much as it punishes and stigmatizes aggression in everyone else
743597757835976704 2016-06-16 00:14:55 UTC <willsmithfocus> @somethingldsay Great. Tell you what I'll go. Keep watching for those AAs. Don't worry about guys like you. It'll be fine. You take care
743596400806600704 2016-06-16 00:09:31 UTC <willsmithfocus> @somethingldsay Look. Youre actually boring Me to death. You don't make anyone scared of AA. You freak them out about you. Deal with your s*
743594205243654144 2016-06-16 00:00:48 UTC <willsmithfocus> @somethingldsay Absolutely. Im sure you don't know violent WM and you're not an aggressive trouble magnet yourself. You are perfectly safe
743591091484696576 2016-06-16 23:48:26 UTC <willsmithfocus> @somethingldsay This is really simple. WP kill WP. Especially antisocial WM. Like you. No offense. Just take it like a man and walk away.
743587500963282944 2016-06-16 23:34:10 UTC <willsmithfocus> @somethingldsay Good. When a white man kills you at least you'll have the satisfaction of knowing it wasn't an AA. Are we done?
743584980710924288 2016-06-16 23:24:09 UTC <willsmithfocus> @somethingldsay If someone kills you or anyone in your family it will be a white man Your fear of AA is amusing but it wont save you or them

743302532672294912 2016-06-15 04:41:48 UTC <willsmithfocus> @gotallier 3. Now that all Dems are getting their closeups Im sure they'll hold out for good legislation. We'll soon see
743302432755585025 2016-06-15 04:41:24 UTC <willsmithfocus> @gotallier 2. I get that this impresses you Bernie has filibustered on his own as others made bad deals. That impressed me

743249165057167360 2016-06-15 01:09:44 UTC <willsmithfocus> HRC is so serious about gun reform she got an NRA lobbyist to co-host her fundraiser so...   https://theintercept.com/2016/03/01/nra-lobbyist-will-co-host-clinton-fundraiser/ https://twitter.com/gotallier/status/743243171535020032

743245923778727936 2016-06-15 00:56:51 UTC <willsmithfocus> @gotallier I would focus on AWB, background checks, reigning in gun shows etc. But if you explain how the suit would work I'm open to it
743245294020722697 2016-06-15 00:54:21 UTC <willsmithfocus> @gotallier a) I don't think its 5 times b) I'm not sure how you sue when the product works as advertised. That seems to be passing the buck

740054208519516160 2016-06-06 05:34:07 UTC <willsmithfocus> @politibeast Um yeah if I wanted to extrapolate from his caucus wins I could make an argument but why? We'll all know where we are in July
740053020084441089 2016-06-06 05:29:24 UTC <willsmithfocus> @politibeast I said I COULD say that but caucuses/primaries are not the same thing. Let's just agree to disagree before someone gets upset
740050378352414720 2016-06-06 05:18:54 UTC <willsmithfocus> @politibeast That's cute. Since he destroyed her in many places I could say he's beating her but my point is you are counting apples & pears
740047095495839744 2016-06-06 05:05:51 UTC <willsmithfocus> @politibeast I do find it interesting that representative caucuses are counted as is rather instead of extrapolated out. But thats just me
740046926272462848 2016-06-06 05:05:11 UTC <willsmithfocus> @politibeast I said I would feel the math in July. But since you asked...
740043205379510272 2016-06-06 04:50:24 UTC <willsmithfocus> @politibeast I'd be fascinated to see how that was calculated. Send a link anytime. I'll feel the math in July #ImWithDemocracy

698217503797940228 2016-02-12 18:49:59 UTC <willsmithfocus> @JenniTidd @Shoq @GetWisdomDude I know. It wasnt the days and hours of blood sweating negotiations by Kerry. It was all HRC. Lost my head

698211999818379264 2016-02-12 18:28:07 UTC <willsmithfocus> @JenniTidd @Shoq I really cannot believe anyone is comparing any job to POTUS or ignoring Bernie working w/congress for years. Go figure
698211277898977280 2016-02-12 18:25:15 UTC <willsmithfocus> @JenniTidd @Shoq I know. Always the demotion. But its still more actual "getting things done" as the boss than HRC & more exp in congress

698209618485473281 2016-02-12 18:18:39 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Shoq How about everybody vote for the candidate who they believe will serve them best and get out the vote
698209033308741634 2016-02-12 18:16:20 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Shoq Also the sky will rain frogs and the seas will turn to blood. Got it
698208710624149504 2016-02-12 18:15:03 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Shoq I know. And theyve been right out so much. The thing with blaming voters for not responding to their dismissiveness is genius though
698204688106319872 2016-02-12 17:59:04 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Shoq Right. I know. Always an excuse for HRC and a downgrade for Sanders. Its cool. Well see how it goes
698203859680886785 2016-02-12 17:55:46 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Shoq It was the first race. In the second she got hit so hard she went back in time. I know the surrender reflex is strong but fight it
698201970604175360 2016-02-12 17:48:16 UTC <willsmithfocus> @williamg1 @Shoq She won by .2 % and a few quarters. Who are you kidding?
698201437944287234 2016-02-12 17:46:09 UTC <willsmithfocus> @williamg1 @Shoq No I meant the millions of donors he has. And yes the voters. Maybe your voters didnt come and thats why HRC lost so bad
698199186244792321 2016-02-12 17:37:12 UTC <willsmithfocus> @williamg1 @Shoq  Im surprised at what youre showing. The SoS anticipated turnout. Give it time. The sm donations show the support is there
698186856761073665 2016-02-12 16:48:12 UTC <willsmithfocus> @williamg1 @Shoq It up enough to blow your candidate out of state and across the water and its not even November yet. Give them a chance
698186108849541121 2016-02-12 16:45:14 UTC <willsmithfocus> @williamg1 @Shoq Yes and Bernie has unprecedented support. Why? Because he actually Offers Them Something
698185863755386885 2016-02-12 16:44:16 UTC <willsmithfocus> @williamg1 @Shoq Which is why when a guy like Sanders comes along they scrape their $27 together and ante up. Not so apathetic when invited
698185272224313346 2016-02-12 16:41:55 UTC <willsmithfocus> @williamg1 @Shoq Right. Its also really quite clear they cant afford to compete in national & local auctions thinly disguised as elections
698184204069289984 2016-02-12 16:37:40 UTC <willsmithfocus> @williamg1 @Shoq I get it now. Its not that you dont listen to others you dont even listen to yourselves. You dont follow your own reasoning
698183187957157889 2016-02-12 16:33:38 UTC <willsmithfocus> @williamg1 @Shoq i think blaming the poor when you know we have have a de facto two party system based on money is a little bit disgusting
698182556001439744 2016-02-12 16:31:07 UTC <willsmithfocus> @MMBakner @Shoq Either there is no support for the agenda or any Dem would do it. You are arguing with yourself let me know how it turns out
698181924729257984 2016-02-12 16:28:37 UTC <willsmithfocus> @williamg1 @Shoq Are you just trying to have an argument? Fine. They should vote Green. Thanks. Good talk
698179420964651008 2016-02-12 16:18:40 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Shoq @MMBakner You dont agree that we disagree. Okay. you have a nice day
698179294661578753 2016-02-12 16:18:10 UTC <willsmithfocus> @williamg1 @Shoq I suggest they dont vote because no one is offering them anything substantial. Some people are too busy being "realistic"
698179014599565317 2016-02-12 16:17:03 UTC <willsmithfocus> @MMBakner @Shoq You have voters who want something. You tell them they cant have it & threaten them w/not getting what you want. Persuasive
698177174491303936 2016-02-12 16:09:44 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Shoq @MMBakner Well we agree to disagree
698176827186085888 2016-02-12 16:08:21 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Shoq And yet the only people routinely ignored are the people proposing the most universally beneficial programs. Please tell me another
698176452060188673 2016-02-12 16:06:52 UTC <willsmithfocus> @MMBakner @Shoq Make up your mind. You can complain about things not getting done or about people who demand that things get done. Not both
698175812814635008 2016-02-12 16:04:19 UTC <willsmithfocus> @reasonableFunc @Shoq @GetWisdomDude Well its hard to believe they are not enticed by that kind of respect
698175512791904256 2016-02-12 16:03:08 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Shoq Does "bend to their will" mean do what they ask, like every other voter expects? Or should they vote for people who dismiss them?
698174551017066496 2016-02-12 15:59:19 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Shoq @GetWisdomDude Not quite true.The left advocates sweeping changes & is shut down by "realistic" pols who then -surprise- loose support
698173450570100736 2016-02-12 15:54:56 UTC <willsmithfocus> @aquintinilla He said Kissinger has advocated for trade deals with China that have devastated the US just as NAFTA has. Both things are true
698026373663698944 2016-02-11 06:10:30 UTC <willsmithfocus> @aquintinilla Ok. I dont doubt her intelligence or her memory. That is why her policy 180s are not credible. Her judgement is the problem
698020449431621633 2016-02-11 05:46:58 UTC <willsmithfocus> @aquintinilla I honestly dont know what that means. HRC has been very wrong on serious FP & domestic issues. Depth is ok. Wisdom is required

698001027384131584 2016-02-11 04:29:47 UTC <willsmithfocus> @GuardianUS Easier to say when you dont have to worry about making a living the way most Americans do. That tends to focus your attention
697996182459645952 2016-02-11 04:10:32 UTC <willsmithfocus> @WBVT_98FM They did not stay/threaten to kill anyone and when THEY did Saint Regan & the NRA supported the Mulford Act vs carrying Try again
697993922723901440 2016-02-11 04:01:33 UTC <willsmithfocus> @Bernie2016_PRES @DykstraDame What did they do just drop off bags of cash and walk out with a shy smile? There were no policy conversations?
697988798014210048 2016-02-11 03:41:12 UTC <willsmithfocus> @GuardianUS @BernieSanders Why would it be weird for him not to have a cabal advising him yet? HRC's results have not improved with help

697236632571928576 2016-02-09 01:52:21 UTC <willsmithfocus> @aquintinilla I appreciate your concerns. This guy made the right call on 2 disastrous wars. I think he should make the calls in the future
697235407587696640 2016-02-09 01:47:29 UTC <willsmithfocus> @aquintinilla Good. I dont want a hawk either. I want someone who will fight if its right and  has the strength to say no when its wrong
697110725089751041 2016-02-09 17:32:03 UTC <willsmithfocus> @aquintinilla  Every politician seems to get points for how willing they are to kill and send others to die. I want one who knows better
697108323183828992 2016-02-09 17:22:30 UTC <willsmithfocus> @aquintinilla During those years everybody else was catching up with Bernie Sanders a lot of people died
697106845501169665 2016-02-09 17:16:38 UTC <willsmithfocus> @aquintinilla When everybody was banging the drum to go into Iraq Bernie said it was a mistake. Years later just about everybody agrees
697106456953356288 2016-02-09 17:15:05 UTC <willsmithfocus> @aquintinilla Bernie did not avoid the draft. He told them straight up he objected to the war. Years later just about everybody agrees
697105658798333956 2016-02-09 17:11:55 UTC <willsmithfocus> @aquintinilla I have answered your question at least twice.  I am trying to be as polite as I can Im assuming you are not trying to be dense
697045189488218113 2016-02-09 13:11:38 UTC <willsmithfocus> @aquintinilla "Evolving" to realize a war was a mistake is commendable personal growth but it means a lot of good people never grow older
697044889696104449 2016-02-09 13:10:26 UTC <willsmithfocus> @aquintinilla I answered. The best warriors hate war -usually after. I prefer a Commander in Chief who can pick a bad war before people die
696900714220675072 2016-02-08 03:37:32 UTC <willsmithfocus> @aquintinilla I argue with your assumptions. I believe you mistake the wisdom and self-discipline to resist folly with weakness
696749691598409730 2016-02-08 17:37:26 UTC <willsmithfocus> @DykstraDame For some reason they think they can scold and browbeat and guilt-trip their way back to the WH
696744157587578880 2016-02-08 17:15:26 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ShaunKing They love the nasty subtext condemning other people's children. Wait until the next, God forbid, mass shooting by a tan-less male
696684318735863809 2016-02-08 13:17:40 UTC <willsmithfocus> @16po @GetWisdomDude  From Michael Sherrard, director of Faithful America.  http://m.dailykos.com/story/2016/2/2/1478763/-Largest-online-Christian-organization-condemns-Ted-Cruz-for-claiming-Christians-won-him-Iowa-Caucus Also some guy who said judge not, love

696545667154583553 2016-02-07 04:06:42 UTC <willsmithfocus> @ThisIsntAnn @GetWisdomDude @hotelkeys (1) Matthew 6:5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray
696544250092253184 2016-02-07 04:01:05 UTC <willsmithfocus> @aquintinilla Maybe that is one of the reasons Bernie marched with MLK. God knows there was no shortage of injustices for anyone to focus on
696543263386439682 2016-02-07 03:57:09 UTC <willsmithfocus> @aquintinilla If you can say no to something unjust you say no. Blacks not having a choice is wrong. That doesnt make going to war right
696535930010738688 2016-02-07 03:28:01 UTC <willsmithfocus> @aquintinilla Youre going to have to translate the last part for me. I got up to "its 1 thing" what else?
696534352142934020 2016-02-07 03:21:45 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 Repudiated her old position. Typing is starting to go. Look just look at the policies again. And think it over
696532672924028929 2016-02-07 03:15:04 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 No. What counts is she has repudiate her old position on and Bernie wants us to catch up to other "major" countries
696531862261534721 2016-02-07 03:11:51 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 Excellent. Because I also strongly prefer his policies. Better cheaper healthcare. No more destructive trade etc
696530888549654528 2016-02-07 03:07:59 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 To you. Because thats all you choose to hear. What I actually said was he made and makes the right calls early
696529166649462785 2016-02-07 03:01:08 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 And you guys make it worse. Bc you have no actual argument. You dont. And its obvious. So it looks bad
696528677211873280 2016-02-07 02:59:12 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 HRC doesnt have that. She didnt before. She doesnt now. Every attempt to obscure her own record just makes it worse
696527684839591936 2016-02-07 02:55:15 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 The reason BO won, irrespective of everything else is bc ppl believed he would do the right thing at the right time
696525975614525440 2016-02-07 02:48:28 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 That is your candidates rhetoric. If you dont like it send her a note. And its easy. You just dont want to answer
696519990263083008 2016-02-07 02:24:41 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 Answer the question. Its 3 a.m. There is a crisis. Who should answer? The right now one or the sooner or later one?
696516262772482048 2016-02-07 02:09:52 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 There is no time. Thats the test. That is HRCs own test. Who do you choose? Right at the time or a war or so later?
696515205128388609 2016-02-07 02:05:40 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 Its HRCs own test: When the crisis comes do you want someone who starts right or needs years to figure things out?
696513522050715648 2016-02-07 01:58:58 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 Shes just working things out with evidence. Slowly. By odd coincidence just as the polls have changed
696513026883723265 2016-02-07 01:57:00 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 Thats why she started out a Republican working for a segregationist. Thats why TPP and GMOs well not GMOs I guess
696512031894151168 2016-02-07 01:53:03 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 Right. So HRC needed evidence to realize gay marriage was ok? And with Iraq she had evidence but it didnt work out
696511035700834305 2016-02-07 01:49:06 UTC <willsmithfocus> @UtopiasTaint @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 What does that even mean? He was / is always right at the time. That is the whole point
696508890796703745 2016-02-07 01:40:34 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 That is a cheap lazy non-argument. Why would you prefer someone slow on the uptake? You would not. Its nonsense
696507487244124160 2016-02-07 01:35:00 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 Really. Being right on civil rights gay marriage peace etc. sounds Republican to you. I dont think so
696502963167166464 2016-02-07 01:17:01 UTC <willsmithfocus> @wonderfullone @GetWisdomDude If this was 1950. In 2016 with 99% of Americans getting poorer in the name of being "competitive" not so much
696500946713636866 2016-02-07 01:09:00 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 If you can hire someone who usually gets it right early or someone who usually gets there eventually its not tough
696497955801604097 2016-02-07 00:57:07 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 No. If Bernie was wrong it would be different. As it is he is always ahead of the curve. Not stubborn, just right
696495294700240896 2016-02-07 00:46:33 UTC <willsmithfocus> @pizzmoe @co_kmaldonado4 Some grown ups realize that people who do serial 180s on serious issues would continue to do so as POTUS, some dont
696490422957449216 2016-02-07 00:27:11 UTC <willsmithfocus> @GetWisdomDude  "This isnt Christianity  its bigotry wrapped up in the Bible."  Nice to read the faithful taking faith back
696479626328174592 2016-02-07 23:44:17 UTC <willsmithfocus> @GuardianUS Bernie Sanders called for Snyder's resignation last month. But to be fair HRC undoubtedly told him to "cut it out"
696473997903601664 2016-02-07 23:21:55 UTC <willsmithfocus> @OccupyWallStNYC There is nothing wrong with facilitating exchanges of goods & services, everything is wrong with making the tool the master

695809006040956928 2016-02-05 03:19:29 UTC <willsmithfocus> @COFERJL @CharonMG  (4) The criticism is when a moderate who scoffs@ single-payer, talking to enemies etc uses a word to obscure differences
