969697402478321666 2018-03-02 22:14:11 UTC <philip_e_davies> @mlizondo Absolutely!
969661543947362304 2018-03-02 19:51:42 UTC <philip_e_davies> @mlizondo Interesting speech - it was all about mitigating problems, no real mention of a single benefit of leaving

969538169363296257 2018-03-02 11:41:27 UTC <philip_e_davies> @DVATW @jimkirkland1975 @solinimpex Not Weasel Words but the unarguable truth - if you dont believe me do a fact check! Problem with Brexit debates is that the truth is dismissed when its inconvenient. I havent even said whether I support Brexit, Ive only stated a true fact!!!!
969502628353855488 2018-03-02 09:20:13 UTC <philip_e_davies> @DVATW @jimkirkland1975 @solinimpex Actually they do have right to ignore the referendum result whether you or I like it (or not). That's how it is legally - the referendum was legally defined as 'advisory' with no requirement on any government to implement the result.

967817700075388928 2018-02-25 17:44:55 UTC <philip_e_davies> @Haggis_UK Simple question - no answer - obvious why - Germany does more trade because its economy is stronger - Brexit is definitely not a magic bullet that will increase our exports, trade deal or not

967757057427496961 2018-02-25 13:43:57 UTC <philip_e_davies> @IanDunt AS @mrjamesob often says - if you're well off and left you're a "champagne socialist" (as an insult) - if you're not well off it's "the politics of envy" (as an insult)

961342814406758401 2018-02-07 20:56:02 UTC <philip_e_davies> @LukewSavage Because some people don't realise that maiden flight should not be entrusted to carry something with much value-it's quite likely to explode (as w/Ariane 5 maiden flight with a billion pounds worth of science on board). Maiden flights usually carry "mass dummies"- this was a car
961341992360964096 2018-02-07 20:52:46 UTC <philip_e_davies> @LukewSavage Yes they will - Musk is lowering the cost of putting stuff into space for anyone with a satellite so we can afford to do more for the same money
