890205373109592064 2017-07-26 13:41:14 UTC <taziacira> @realDonaldTrump What about the rates of assault in the military? What about the rates of suicide and mental illness for veterans who are given no care ---

878311444147601409 2017-06-23 17:59:01 UTC <taziacira> @rednazcela the majority of celebrity in mainstream media are white, showing an obvious example of how white privilege exists economically.

864298061882957825 2017-05-15 01:54:50 UTC <taziacira> @Kallenpaige18 Racism is socioeconomic & institutionalized. If you believe your white experience compares, that shows your own racism entirely.

862509581527810048 2017-05-10 03:28:03 UTC <taziacira> @starbunny_ @sarahweed1000 @Alexis_Skye05 The fact that we have you are going to be a law enforcement officer speaks volumes. You are falling into your own stereotype.
862509336060448768 2017-05-10 03:27:05 UTC <taziacira> @sarahweed1000 @starbunny_ @Alexis_Skye05 The fact that you resort to appearance, the laziest and easiest form of 'argument', displays you have no factual rebuttal.B/C there is none.

837465689799733249 2017-03-02 00:52:34 UTC <taziacira> YESS!  & tbh I really think all this "representation" Disney is doing is to cover up their kyriarchal worker exploitation & it's terrifying.https://twitter.com/theaffinitymag/status/837407555349528578

835891534457360384 2017-02-26 16:37:26 UTC <taziacira> #resistcapitalism Capitalism is the first world not being able to know about global injustice b/c of the perpetrators fund the media.

832953391072628737 2017-02-18 14:02:18 UTC <taziacira> (This is coming from a cruelty free vegan environmentalist, too): We have got to step up and realize the reality & not pick and choose.
832953141532454912 2017-02-18 14:01:19 UTC <taziacira> Because if you are going to care about one, you have to care about all, to fully understand the reach of these issues.
832952892982251527 2017-02-18 14:00:19 UTC <taziacira> There are a plethora of unintersectional environmentalists, vegans, and vegetarians, and it needs to stop, b/c it halts your  effort too.
832952116306128896 2017-02-18 13:57:14 UTC <taziacira> Therefore, if you are care about the environment, you cannot not be involved with social issues.
832951924425125898 2017-02-18 13:56:28 UTC <taziacira> When people's health  is at stake, they may not have the time to actively fight for environmental issues nor social issues.
832951330570395648 2017-02-18 13:54:07 UTC <taziacira> With the destruction of the environment (pollution in all forms, agricultural exploitation etc.) peoples wellness is at stake.
832950802687864832 2017-02-18 13:52:01 UTC <taziacira> I really do think social activism would be nothing without environmental activism, & inversly so. They intersect, so it's vital to be both.

819438992869494784 2017-01-11 07:00:54 UTC <taziacira> @TonyKroogz Holding people accountable to me is a form of respect, because it means we expect better, ya know?
819438810832453632 2017-01-11 07:00:11 UTC <taziacira> @TonyKroogz The thing is though, theres a difference between feminazis and holding people accountable.
819438439330443266 2017-01-11 06:58:43 UTC <taziacira> @AnneCalonico @hannahgedwill @TonyKroogz Idk, In the end, all of us as humans, all weve got is each other, so we gotta respect one another
819438308514217984 2017-01-11 06:58:11 UTC <taziacira> @AnneCalonico @hannahgedwill @TonyKroogz To me, a life lived in empathy is one so much more fulfilling than of hurting another, ya know?
819438059116756992 2017-01-11 06:57:12 UTC <taziacira> @AnneCalonico @hannahgedwill @TonyKroogz In terms of being respectful to one anothers experience.
819437892426760192 2017-01-11 06:56:32 UTC <taziacira> @AnneCalonico @hannahgedwill @TonyKroogz Our words have power, and it is our responsibility to use them wisely.
819437708175097860 2017-01-11 06:55:48 UTC <taziacira> @AnneCalonico @hannahgedwill @TonyKroogz 2: If you do not face the injustice brought on by the word, it is not yours to reclaim.
819437109589184512 2017-01-11 06:53:25 UTC <taziacira> @AnneCalonico @hannahgedwill @TonyKroogz b/c ultimately you do not own the connotation of the word. Examples of injustice show the impact.
819436818269618177 2017-01-11 06:52:16 UTC <taziacira> @AnneCalonico @hannahgedwill @TonyKroogz People create culture, and so words create  culture, despite how you intend it,
819436466128490497 2017-01-11 06:50:52 UTC <taziacira> @AnneCalonico @hannahgedwill @TonyKroogz Furthermore, we have to ask where this injustice stems from, and that is normalizing degradation.
819436272355840000 2017-01-11 06:50:06 UTC <taziacira> @AnneCalonico @hannahgedwill @TonyKroogz So since Oppression still exists, we can see that the term still has power.
819435932143276032 2017-01-11 06:48:45 UTC <taziacira> @AnneCalonico @hannahgedwill @TonyKroogz Using the word is disrespectful to their struggle (which can be seen in some examples here)pic.twitter.com/MNzG1p7ajB
819434561398591488 2017-01-11 06:43:18 UTC <taziacira> @AnneCalonico @hannahgedwill @TonyKroogz 1:Oppression of those with disabilities still is prevalent in society today in every group. So,
819433630611161088 2017-01-11 06:39:36 UTC <taziacira> @AnneCalonico @hannahgedwill @TonyKroogz So the reason why utilizing retard is not okay, in terms of what you tweeted, is that:

819411149808660481 2017-01-11 05:10:16 UTC <taziacira> @reagancasper Is this about Hannah's tweet about ableism and using the  R Word?
819410826176196608 2017-01-11 05:08:59 UTC <taziacira> There is much to be said about not calling out slurs. If someone that faced that oppression was there, would you call it out then?
819410169461428224 2017-01-11 05:06:22 UTC <taziacira> Every word you speak has power. Utilizing slurs, such as the R Word, is irresponsible and disrespectful to your fellow human beings.
819409635044114433 2017-01-11 05:04:15 UTC <taziacira> Using the R Word normalizes the oppression, abuse, and threats to their safety that people with disabilities face on the daily
819409259049971712 2017-01-11 05:02:45 UTC <taziacira> What type of insecure god complex do people contain to believe that it's okay to use the r word
819409055827558400 2017-01-11 05:01:57 UTC <taziacira> after sobing for 30 minutes  about how people can be so apathetic to oppression I just want to say thank you all for being woke. thank you

812167634150182913 2016-12-22 05:27:07 UTC <taziacira> 4: By supporting these people, we are supporting their actions. We all do have a power in what is mainstream media, and we need to use it.
812167410501484544 2016-12-22 05:26:14 UTC <taziacira> 3: Therefore, this 'comedy' is a direct form of supremacy, and is normalized under the guise of "Relatable" Content & "Memes".
812167112248750080 2016-12-22 05:25:03 UTC <taziacira> 2: Who is profiting off degrading comedy on Social Media Platforms? Generally Cis-Het-White Able-bodied and Able-Minded Men.
812166602972168192 2016-12-22 05:23:02 UTC <taziacira> 1: Obviously this culture of degrading oppressed groups is horrible. It is a lazy form of comedy, and people are profiting off of it.
812166308804620289 2016-12-22 05:21:51 UTC <taziacira> I firmly believe the culture within Social Media of "Fuck Political Correctness" and Trolling needs to stop. Lets Deconstruct this:

811554143475208193 2016-12-21 12:49:20 UTC <taziacira> I am OUTRAGED. This is so classist, and my heart goes out to all those in Texas. Separation of the Church & State needs to happen NOW!https://twitter.com/evanasmith/status/811360431298252802
810512177681616896 2016-12-18 15:48:56 UTC <taziacira> Some avoid others in times of immense mental struggle, b/c they think it's a burden to talk about it. Always let them know you are there!https://twitter.com/theaffinitymag/status/810396884976234496
810511434547400704 2016-12-18 15:45:59 UTC <taziacira> if they aren't acting 'like themselves' around you and need space,  do not be offended. Let them know you are there for themhttps://twitter.com/theaffinitymag/status/810396884976234496

810510353088086018 2016-12-18 15:41:41 UTC <taziacira> Let them say what they are feeling with NO judgement, and understand that sometimes they may not emotionally be able to open up for a while.https://twitter.com/theaffinitymag/status/810396884976234496
810509665347977216 2016-12-18 15:38:57 UTC <taziacira> Inversely,don't get a boo, hoping they fix your mental disorders. It's unfair, & you deserve to grow a relationship w/ ur fine self too!https://twitter.com/theaffinitymag/status/810382640251539458
810508063383887872 2016-12-18 15:32:35 UTC <taziacira> YES! Obviously being there for someone is sups important (we are all here to spread love to each other!)! BUT People are not medicine.https://twitter.com/theaffinitymag/status/810382640251539458

806310218774806528 2016-12-06 01:31:51 UTC <taziacira> The fact that the school administration has to be SUBORDINATE to ignorant HS Students shows how much change we need.
806309929153921024 2016-12-06 01:30:42 UTC <taziacira> The deans even told me they supported BLM, but they said b/c of the awful things people wrote, I cannot put them up anymore.
806309702435041280 2016-12-06 01:29:48 UTC <taziacira> the fact that students of Minooka, or I should say the corn country cult of IL,  defaced the BLM posters I put up sickens me to the bone.
806211513996427265 2016-12-06 18:59:38 UTC <taziacira> if one more jocky  student uses the word fag around me i am going to strangle them with a damn rainbow

792943484898607104 2016-10-30 04:17:13 UTC <taziacira> Being "Psycho" or "Crazy" for your superficial need to be "Cute &Quirky!" contributes to dehumanization of the mental health narrative.

792362455418609664 2016-10-29 13:48:25 UTC <taziacira> It's sickening that alot of our childhood's main source of happiness (Disney media) was built on worker exploitation w/o us even knowing.
792353293565501441 2016-10-29 13:12:01 UTC <taziacira> It's so sad- next time you go to buy merch or those 'cute' ears or parade around Disney pride, remember who had to hurt for your pleasure.
792352853822017536 2016-10-29 13:10:16 UTC <taziacira> Those these conditions have been revealed, no progress has been made in the conditions for the workers at Disney Sweatshops.
792352474791149573 2016-10-29 13:08:45 UTC <taziacira> Disney has had repeated behaviour of exploiting workers based on race, gender, age, ability, etc, & these reports go as recent as 2015.
792351982648373253 2016-10-29 13:06:48 UTC <taziacira> Heres some receipts of what Disney has done-  http://www.truth-out.org/buzzflash/commentary/disneys-sad-sweatshop-history https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/law/2011/aug/27/disney-factory-sweatshop-suicide-claims?client=ms-android-att-ushttp://www.globallabourrights.org/reports/dirty-toys-made-in-china
792351111264870400 2016-10-29 13:03:20 UTC <taziacira> sometimes I worry that Disney only gives visibility to narratives to cover up that they kyriarchally exploit workers in 3rd world countries

790236500818407424 2016-10-23 17:00:38 UTC <taziacira> Songs like Hey Girl on #JOANNE remind me of why I'm so happy to be alive: To get to know beautiful souls, to create community, and love.

789302094159343616 2016-10-20 03:07:38 UTC <taziacira> why am i so emo the world may never know
789296114650472448 2016-10-20 02:43:52 UTC <taziacira> all i can say is let the flowers of your heart grow into your lungs & throat.  you deserve to let what you love become the air you breathe.
789295767722848256 2016-10-20 02:42:30 UTC <taziacira> what you create is an extension of yourself and that's a really beautiful thing, be proud of all that vulnerability, it's rare.
789295351618375680 2016-10-20 02:40:50 UTC <taziacira> By creating what you do, you inspire others to be as brave as you to share what they have created. A whole cycle starts.
789295071669649412 2016-10-20 02:39:44 UTC <taziacira> gosh i dont know how much i can reiterate this but what you create is worth visibility & DOES CHANGE THE WORLD!! you have so much power
789281785133797377 2016-10-20 01:46:56 UTC <taziacira> Also like I think its cool to be as empathetic as to not eat fish too, ya know? Like why not help everything if you can, idkhttps://twitter.com/beechapo/status/789274607626821632
789165088271761409 2016-10-20 18:03:13 UTC <taziacira> Some great fair trade brands that help those in 3rd world countries are Mata Traders, Me to We, and Toms!
789164810210455552 2016-10-20 18:02:07 UTC <taziacira> Thrift shopping is also a great way to be sustainable and shop ethical!
789164703410860034 2016-10-20 18:01:41 UTC <taziacira> -and that money from shopping clearance goes towards the employees, not the big company!
789164551547723776 2016-10-20 18:01:05 UTC <taziacira> Shopping clearance at your fav stores is a way to not support the exploitation, bc you are only clearing out the stores stock,
789164289865035777 2016-10-20 18:00:03 UTC <taziacira> BUT BUT BUT there are a bunch of fair trade and made in the usa products for cheap!
789164057093779456 2016-10-20 17:59:07 UTC <taziacira> In turn, these companies enforce the culture of superficiality. They get your money to give you a moment of elation, its manipulation.
789163600770240512 2016-10-20 17:57:19 UTC <taziacira> They wrap things up in pretty packaging, from Victoria Secret bras to your new Nikes, to make you feel special while they hurt others.
789163191242625024 2016-10-20 17:55:41 UTC <taziacira> The fact that big corporations advertise their products as family friendly while kyriarchally oppressing 3rd world workers is disgusting
789162661040754688 2016-10-20 17:53:34 UTC <taziacira> I ALSO LOVE THAT CAPITALISM CURATES A MEDIA THAT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ALWAYS NEED NEW THINGS & MAKES U FORGET THE BLOOD BEING SPILLED
789162232936554496 2016-10-20 17:51:52 UTC <taziacira> I LOVE THAT CAPITALISM AND WALL STREET TRAPS THE AMERICAN PUBLIC INTO ONLY BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT SWEATSHOPS WHILE THEY MAKE US POORER WOW
789161934729908224 2016-10-20 17:50:41 UTC <taziacira> WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT BY WORKING AT THE MALL YOURE SUPPORTING SWEATSHOPS BECAUSE YOURE PROFITING OFF THE COMPANY'S EXPLOITATION
788929758163718144 2016-10-19 02:28:06 UTC <taziacira> If one (Trump) does not care about the issues affecting so many American citizens, what makes you think he's qualified to be president?
788929279065100288 2016-10-19 02:26:12 UTC <taziacira> YOU ARE ON FLEEK YOU ARE THE BESTEST HUMAN AND ARE SO GORGEOUS AND A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH,  I LOVE YOU

788566293964259328 2016-10-18 02:23:49 UTC <taziacira> @evan_breen you don't know what's best for their health because you are not them &havent felt their struggle
788566170668503040 2016-10-18 02:23:20 UTC <taziacira> @evan_breen & therefore, it is no one's place to say what helps another person is bullshit, b/c
788565315106013184 2016-10-18 02:19:56 UTC <taziacira> @evan_breen I think its good though that they are there for those who have to deal w/ violence b/c of kyriarchy,

788214145455751169 2016-10-17 03:04:31 UTC <taziacira> (This is me saying this as a queer person) Just because you are lgbtq+, it doesn't give you a free pass to be racist, sexist, ableist etc.
788213791947227136 2016-10-17 03:03:06 UTC <taziacira> It's actually homophobic to excuse this behavior b/c it perpetuates the idea that all gay men are assholes and fit into one stereotype
788213330942889984 2016-10-17 03:01:17 UTC <taziacira> if i see one more white gay cis man idolized & excused for being hateful/closeminded b/c "he's gay so it's okay!!" i'm gonna throw myself
788038806918365184 2016-10-17 15:27:47 UTC <taziacira> HI HI HI! I have postpone this project until Nov 1st because of college preparation, BUT I am still scheduling shoots!https://twitter.com/taliatatertot/status/785905706172047360
788026530752585728 2016-10-17 14:39:00 UTC <taziacira> @CarlosA36018574 @taylorandbrown saying that feminism=females means that you only think men can be feminine. Are you, sir, against men then?
787897148821995520 2016-10-16 06:04:53 UTC <taziacira> @LaurenKRichards THIS IS THE TRUEST THING IVE SEEN THI

787511992131129344 2016-10-15 04:34:24 UTC <taziacira> Fuck that whole "PC Culture is ruining America, I wanna be edgggggy" shit. It's a lazy mentality & don't feel bad for calling it out.
787511626924711936 2016-10-15 04:32:57 UTC <taziacira> In the end, all we've got is each other, we've got to stand up for one another and you are so so amazing for wanting to help others.
787511296086249472 2016-10-15 04:31:38 UTC <taziacira> Some people can't even enjoy the sky or the stars because of this persistant hatred, & when no one stands up, they feel like no one cares.
787510937196650496 2016-10-15 04:30:13 UTC <taziacira> Historically ableism worsens for one if they have more identities that are oppressed in society. This is everyones' issue.
787510623143923712 2016-10-15 04:28:58 UTC <taziacira> There's this mentality that if ur part of an oppressed group then u get a "free pass" to  hate another group. There's no fucking free pass.
787510217764372480 2016-10-15 04:27:21 UTC <taziacira> So many people made fun of autism at my work today & I am disgusted. Why would you want to contribute to such a culture of hatred?

785479973926674433 2016-10-10 13:59:53 UTC <taziacira> REMINDER that being a part of an oppressed group does NOT give you a free pass to be hateful to other oppressed groups.

781317190117195781 2016-09-28 02:18:28 UTC <taziacira> To my fellow activists: Sometimes your fight can make you feel very alone but please know you are doing so much good & we all stand with you
781316891646234628 2016-09-28 02:17:17 UTC <taziacira> do you ever have those moments where you really really need to scream sing & you do it & feel like Tyler Joseph & Madonna at the same time
781280029426618369 2016-09-28 23:50:49 UTC <taziacira> @bill562010 the fact that these fuckers spew hate to raise their tiny ego & jack off to Donald Trump shows how useless they are
780817637139820545 2016-09-27 17:13:26 UTC <taziacira> @edenpinnick like it might not even be the word feminism like they just hear "fem" and then their gaping abyss of insecurity makes them flip
780817209371136000 2016-09-27 17:11:44 UTC <taziacira> @edenpinnick tbh all the White Straight Cis Boys act like their dick is being ripped off when they even hear it being mentioned
780739545117626369 2016-09-27 12:03:07 UTC <taziacira> the way trump articulated last night reminded me of a 13 year old boy trying to convince his parents he didn't smoke the wacky tabacky

777688180023754752 2016-09-18 01:58:05 UTC <taziacira> i think a super important thing for us feminists to know is the line between speaking up for & speaking over.   & to always, always listen.
776808447832649729 2016-09-16 15:42:21 UTC <taziacira> everyone needs to read thishttps://twitter.com/sammisuckmyass/status/776788589011021825

775898878864420864 2016-09-13 03:28:02 UTC <taziacira> Relationships are such beautiful things, so fostering relationships with ourselves should be seen as just as beautiful.
775898704247189504 2016-09-13 03:27:21 UTC <taziacira> It makes me so sad how in society we are expected to give ourselves to one another, & frowned upon if we don't do so.
775898510877130752 2016-09-13 03:26:35 UTC <taziacira> I AM LOVING THE RESPONSE TO THIS!Not dating should not be seen as horrible, it shouldn't be seen as bad to focus on ourselves
775879947961376768 2016-09-13 02:12:49 UTC <taziacira> do you think it's weird for someone to not date/see relationships as a priority in their teens?

769393177518374912 2016-08-26 04:36:42 UTC <taziacira> I hate saying that entitlement is a straight men issue but HEY do you see me, as a pansexual queer, staring at someones boobs? No! Wow!
769392922093613056 2016-08-26 04:35:41 UTC <taziacira> ALSO COOL FUNNY APPARENTLY REVOLUTIONARY IDEA: Me not wearing a bra doesnt give you an excuse to stare at my tits. Wow, who would have known
769391303977295872 2016-08-26 04:29:16 UTC <taziacira> ALSO @hannahgedwill @AnneCalonico ARE SUCH GLORIOUS AND WONDERFUL HUMANS TOO YES

769390782784663552 2016-08-26 04:27:11 UTC <taziacira> Harassment and degradation of ones appearance is an act of an attempt of control and power.Respecting other's bodies is not that hard to do.
769390273008984064 2016-08-26 04:25:10 UTC <taziacira> I mean in the way that causes us that have been objectified to view our bodies as all that matters even though we try so hard not to.
769389889653727232 2016-08-26 04:23:38 UTC <taziacira> --- people like sex, because sex is TOTES OKAY to do (consent obvi!)
769389596073426945 2016-08-26 04:22:28 UTC <taziacira> This type of mindset causes the objectified to objectify themselves, even though they try so hard not to. I don't mean the way that--
769389091414761472 2016-08-26 04:20:28 UTC <taziacira> The mindset of entitlement to people's bodies is scary and disgusting and horrifying.
769388951308230656 2016-08-26 04:19:55 UTC <taziacira> WOW i just adore when underclassMEN blatantly stare at my side boob/chest!

763508854416142340 2016-08-10 22:54:30 UTC <taziacira> I think he needs to stop making lazy ass fucking videos because anyone could make a video profiting off of pain and maybe
763074171995824128 2016-08-09 18:07:14 UTC <taziacira> this is a really great video that explains the gender spectrum and that deconstructs common arguments!!  https://youtu.be/tjGu5OCZFzw
762883293314371585 2016-08-08 05:28:45 UTC <taziacira> @DanielleSIO OH MY https://twitter.com/sorryimalex/status/762882929479389184
762882571738853376 2016-08-08 05:25:53 UTC <taziacira> It's so hard to remember your worth in these situations,  but know all that is you is so beautiful and big and an honor for all to see.
762881547561082880 2016-08-08 05:21:49 UTC <taziacira> Lastly, remember you are worth so much, your soul is goddamn everlasting with its brilliance, and your love is so much bigger.
762881285068984321 2016-08-08 05:20:46 UTC <taziacira> Also, please never feel shame for being in caught in situation with emotional abuse. The blame lies w/ the ones that cause pain, not you.
762880907422208000 2016-08-08 05:19:16 UTC <taziacira> If they really like you, they will respect your time, your mind and your personhood.
762880519159685121 2016-08-08 05:17:44 UTC <taziacira> And and and!! You will find people who LOVE you for who you are!! Great people are out there who will love you for who you are .
762880175902121984 2016-08-08 05:16:22 UTC <taziacira> Fuck that whole stigma that says relationships mean sacrifice of self. If you have to lose yourself for them, they dont appreciate you.
762879746334089216 2016-08-08 05:14:39 UTC <taziacira> This is a reminder that it's never selfish to distance yourself from those who treat you badly/are emotionally abusive. You deserve better.
762854047976005632 2016-08-08 03:32:32 UTC <taziacira> the poovement existed before we even knew *mystical sound effects*
762824714775502848 2016-08-08 01:35:59 UTC <taziacira> @elisaxwynn #rememberthepoovement2k16
762741216362528768 2016-08-08 20:04:11 UTC <taziacira> right! This conditioning spans so far back!
762677763547344897 2016-08-08 15:52:03 UTC <taziacira> I like when @LaurenKRichards is just her beautiful wonderful self on Twitter with all her great thoughts because yaas gaga
762664831220609024 2016-08-08 15:00:40 UTC <taziacira> and me saying this now isnt a new revolutionary notion or anything. Heres a good article on this http://writingwithcolor.tumblr.com/post/119802855848/black-and-white-symbolism-a-look-into-the-trope
762664097229967361 2016-08-08 14:57:45 UTC <taziacira> and because theres still huge amounts of racism today, I feel like its good to examine all things that may enforce it, ya know?
762663766454628353 2016-08-08 14:56:26 UTC <taziacira> it means they originated in a time with huge amounts of racism, therefore contributing to those colors associations today
762663607356252160 2016-08-08 14:55:48 UTC <taziacira> good and bad. For example, these associations have been long ingrained in society, and since theyve been there for so long
762663378200453120 2016-08-08 14:54:53 UTC <taziacira> it would be because the color connotations associated purity and bad aid in enforcing social conditioning of what colors are
762649137162616832 2016-08-08 13:58:18 UTC <taziacira> Is the color black used represent 'evil' & white as 'pure' in art and lit. problematic to you?
762638601251328000 2016-08-08 13:16:26 UTC <taziacira> lately I've been thinking about how they use black to represent suffocation/bad & how that could be problematic? https://twitter.com/invsiblecake/status/762282975014719488
762636572235796480 2016-08-08 13:08:22 UTC <taziacira> Brendon told an 11 yr. Old "Why aren't you wearing a dress? Usually girls wear dresses to see me." at a dinner. Grrr https://twitter.com/invsiblecake/status/762297429362225153
762635434304348165 2016-08-08 13:03:51 UTC <taziacira> Loml. I love how his work challenges escapism in comedy, and how his work talks about the good politics. https://twitter.com/invsiblecake/status/762322528073244672

762076600531689472 2016-08-06 00:03:14 UTC <taziacira> All in all, I think it reinforced for me the fact that all we all have in the end is each other, so we've got to stand up for one another
762076341621501953 2016-08-06 00:02:13 UTC <taziacira> It reminded me how beautiful and extraordinary our youth are, and how much more support and love they need with the world we live in.
762076057608466432 2016-08-06 00:01:05 UTC <taziacira> The camp showed me the beauty of community, and reinforced for me the fact that we need more safe spaces in this world .

752692988271161344 2016-07-11 02:36:07 UTC <taziacira> you can't say you want to help girls when you only mean cis girls. you have to include ALL GIRLS because transgender girls are GIRLS TOO!
752692331581616129 2016-07-11 02:33:30 UTC <taziacira> @wokemom ACCURATE AND ALSO UR MAKEUP SLAYS IN THIS
752690371126104064 2016-07-11 02:25:43 UTC <taziacira> adress each struggle individually, and not summarize struggle into one big thing, aka "All Lives Matter".
752690247209590784 2016-07-11 02:25:13 UTC <taziacira> As someones identity increases in those groups, the more they have to go through, & in order to respect that we have to
752690062245048320 2016-07-11 02:24:29 UTC <taziacira> Saying All Lives Matter is erasure of the struggle that increases with grender, sexuality, race, class and ability

752688787562504192 2016-07-11 02:19:25 UTC <taziacira> that should be an obvious thing??? And if you have to say alllivesmatter 4 people to know you believe that then its like??
752688115223973892 2016-07-11 02:16:45 UTC <taziacira> Its sad that yall are spending more time tearing down movements to help people in need, instead of helping people.https://twitter.com/politics_n_prep/status/752686363439403008
752687051179302912 2016-07-11 02:12:31 UTC <taziacira> Saying "all lives matter" is disrespectful because it assumes that everyone are going through the same struggle.https://twitter.com/politics_n_prep/status/752685721476067328
752686588337852416 2016-07-11 02:10:41 UTC <taziacira> @alanaleab help, and then another person says well hmm you should suck it up because I got a small scrape.
752686424625803264 2016-07-11 02:10:02 UTC <taziacira> @alanaleab all lives matter is a way of silencing the black lives matter movement. Its like when somebodys leg is hurt and they ask for,
752685833740705792 2016-07-11 02:07:41 UTC <taziacira> @alanaleab those are the beliefs of the right wing party though, ya know what I mean?
752685293749186560 2016-07-11 02:05:32 UTC <taziacira> @ChrisOflyng True. Maybe its like internalized homophobia in a way?
752684955323342849 2016-07-11 02:04:12 UTC <taziacira> justify their beliefs, and those that say alllivesmatter and things of that nature. Those that spread hate for dominance
752684803367899136 2016-07-11 02:03:35 UTC <taziacira> what do you mean? The conservatives im was talking about are those who are homophobic and  transphobic and use the bible to
752684600153870336 2016-07-11 02:02:47 UTC <taziacira> @alanaleab transphobia and sexism and are racist and say things like alllivesmatter. Those people are who Im talking about :)
752684466519220224 2016-07-11 02:02:15 UTC <taziacira> @alanaleab sorry I forgot to clarify! Who I was referencing to was the conservatives that are use their religion to justify homophobia,

711253547573071872 2016-03-19 18:10:34 UTC <taziacira> saying that everyone deserves an opinion and being friends w/ someone w/ offensive opinions means you support those opinions
