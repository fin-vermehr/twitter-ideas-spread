970393341509754880 2018-03-04 20:19:36 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 So sorry I'm late to the request for cheering up but better late than etc. - you are a wonderful writer and funny and decent and you set a standard for humanity that I try to reach every day.
960607247578648576 2018-02-05 20:13:09 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat Not inexplicable; a whole jar of lemon curd in one day is bloody marvellous.
959553201870704640 2018-02-02 22:24:45 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat Ours works for F.O. too and did 3 years in St. Petersburg, now in China. It is bearable with visits and Skype and email. Still shit, though. Bon courage, mon ami :)
957632226216292353 2018-01-28 15:11:29 UTC <MaconLoony> @ianbremmer Presumably, you mean 'women who have reported being the victim of serious crime'?
957035045235159040 2018-01-26 23:38:30 UTC <MaconLoony> @absurdistwords Are you going to be OK?  Can we help?
956625471587971072 2018-01-25 20:31:00 UTC <MaconLoony> @absurdistwords So glad things are looking a little brighter for you and your family. You do real things every day and you make a huge difference to so many.
956622772255576064 2018-01-25 20:20:16 UTC <MaconLoony> @absurdistwords @bikesalsa I was just about to say the same thing.
955888589283438592 2018-01-23 19:42:53 UTC <MaconLoony> @paddingtonbear We have a guest room all ready for you, Paddington, and a cat who loves you waiting for a cuddle.
955565458060652544 2018-01-22 22:18:53 UTC <MaconLoony> @absurdistwords There are some of us here, keeping our big white mouths shut,  just reading and learning. (& doing our own research!)  Don't ever stop.
955161651921158144 2018-01-21 19:34:18 UTC <MaconLoony> @donthehammer1 @Joannechocolat Bit late here, sorry. Studied this as part of history degree and read that it was commissioned by Bishop Odo of Kent and has long been thought to have been made at St. Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury - by monks.  It contains numerous religious references.
952271184049115137 2018-01-13 20:08:37 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat @AttackLemur Oh, great advice. That's right up there with 'don't take your backside into work if you don't want it grabbed'.
952263955367563264 2018-01-13 19:39:53 UTC <MaconLoony> @Peculiar Wonderful news!
951914837948420098 2018-01-12 20:32:37 UTC <MaconLoony> @absurdistwords Yes.
951873669382406144 2018-01-12 17:49:02 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 Always thought January was shit and now it's gone and upset you. You are golden and sparkly, Matt. Even on your worst day you outshine January by a trillion lights so it can just go and fuck itself.

950464720158576643 2018-01-08 20:30:22 UTC <MaconLoony> @flippedhatnupe Sounds like you've understood every detailed response perfectly; you just don't like what you've read. Like @absurdistwords said - some people will use any excuse not to make the effort.

949723513895768066 2018-01-06 19:25:05 UTC <MaconLoony> @zedverism211 Then: the naturalness of a product does not preclude its use on racist packaging. Now: your faux naivety.
949540793626308608 2018-01-05 07:19:01 UTC <MaconLoony> @zedverism211 Hmmm. However,  charcoal is not naturally found in the form of a black-face mask with the words 'Black Off' & 'get the ugly out'  printed next to it.
947031111829467136 2017-12-30 09:06:26 UTC <MaconLoony> @SteampunkIndia @Joannechocolat I love finding about them! I found the 'white supremacist Eurocentric' argument disingenuous; there were many white western women in your series I'd never heard of either. Keep going under any title - many of us genuinely enjoy it.
944420242205368320 2017-12-22 04:11:46 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 Merry Christmas to you & yours, Matt. We have only met through your books & tweets but I like your brain & heart a hell of a lot. May all the happiness be yours in 2018.
944093859801419776 2017-12-21 06:34:51 UTC <MaconLoony> @absurdistwords @low_tex It's not a metaphor, it's a noun describing an adjective. If you talked about 'red curtains' no-one would think you were saying all curtains are red. Quite the opposite, they know you're describing them as red to distinguish them from all the others.
943837222821924864 2017-12-21 13:35:04 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat @MitchBenn @AthEngMan @ColinRo93282871 I assume these are extracts from teenage Zeitgeist's diary. It's good that you can look back on that adolescent phase of 'I'm too painfully cool to care' with such good humour. Zeitgeist.
943553003524587523 2017-12-20 18:45:41 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 @theminniequinn Oh yes; if you like Christmas and magic with a wilder, darker edge to it.  Not at all twee or childish or condescending. Give it a try!

942024353734160385 2017-12-16 13:31:22 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 @changethecurri1 @flicksfan Matt did answer the query (what a euphemism) - he said "Yes. Very mental." You are condescending if you think Matt Haig needs to be told mental conditions are serious.

940620760128851968 2017-12-12 16:33:59 UTC <MaconLoony> @chipgaines I received the Magnolia Journal, all the way over here in France, just 3 days after I ordered it. That is great service, thank you!
937731764000382977 2017-12-04 17:14:09 UTC <MaconLoony> @PhilipPullman Just burnt our dinner, so enthralled am I by Michael Sheen's reading of your glorious 'La Belle Sauvage'. Just as with Shakespeare's works, all of human experience is here. Thank you.
934519255701381122 2017-11-25 20:28:47 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat Not so long ago I dreamt I had a bag of marshmallows under my pillow. When I woke up I felt the empty space under the pillow; a tear trickled slowly down my cheek.

928350129274478593 2017-11-08 19:54:53 UTC <MaconLoony> @stavvers @patricksamphire Schools are financially penalised by the govt. if their absence figures are above a percentage set by the govt. Not so absurd, really.
927654078624169984 2017-11-06 21:49:01 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 Man alive; only just read the bile & vitriol you've received the last couple of days. So sorry, bon courage.

920429714178748416 2017-10-17 23:21:59 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 There are thousands of people currently thinking nice things about you & hoping your day went really well. And tomorrow too.
920185841154174977 2017-10-17 07:12:55 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat @scottlynch78 @NetConscience When she has shown clear interest in further contact from you. Only entitled douches are puzzled by this.

915459141078052864 2017-10-03 06:10:42 UTC <MaconLoony> @LarryOConnor @Mediaite I dunno, Foreign-born country music lovers being shot and killed by an American gun owner is quite annoying too.
915232011899604992 2017-10-03 15:08:10 UTC <MaconLoony> @Independent @Phattarchieboy Perfect use of the word.
915224191577845761 2017-10-03 14:37:05 UTC <MaconLoony> @samswey This is bloody important.
914979095276081153 2017-10-02 22:23:10 UTC <MaconLoony> @jasonsfolly In England, taking a knee during Nat Anth looks like we're waiting to be knighted by Her Maj so to protest we tut or sigh heavily instead.
914965652871548928 2017-10-02 21:29:45 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 As am I now. RIP Tom.
914951742193852416 2017-10-02 20:34:28 UTC <MaconLoony> @LibyaLiberty Oh bloody hell no, shit. Who the hell let that happen? I'll certainly give him all day tomorrow.
914557914123243520 2017-10-01 18:29:33 UTC <MaconLoony> @LibyaLiberty And thereby setting a precedent that it's hard to argue against when it comes to something you do mind.

913690587693543424 2017-09-29 09:03:06 UTC <MaconLoony> @kranders @jasonsfolly @DeniseLadyvols @ln419 OK but if the flag has only military connotations then why is it at an NFL game? Surely its presence suggests more meaning than military?
913687764897533952 2017-09-29 08:51:53 UTC <MaconLoony> @kranders @jasonsfolly @DeniseLadyvols @MakingAmy I agree but perhaps hurt feelings, however strong, are not more important than the oppression of fellow Americans? Thanks for discussing : )
913685515945340928 2017-09-29 08:42:57 UTC <MaconLoony> @kranders @jasonsfolly @DeniseLadyvols @MakingAmy I understand, all countries do that, but when cloth is more important than people something's gone horribly wrong.
913683804656668672 2017-09-29 08:36:09 UTC <MaconLoony> @kranders @jasonsfolly @DeniseLadyvols It isn't, eg La Marseillaise. Clearly the flag represents more than military power for many Americans. Otherwise why is it at sports game?

913546415841972225 2017-09-28 23:30:13 UTC <MaconLoony> @kranders @jasonsfolly @DeniseLadyvols But why? How did the military get caught up in a protest against inequality in US society?
913409352224124929 2017-09-28 14:25:34 UTC <MaconLoony> @absurdistwords @Poet_Rose WTF? How is this allowed to happen?
913406115966316546 2017-09-28 14:12:42 UTC <MaconLoony> @attn @GeorgeTakei @PrezHillary17 That would be part of a 3 or 4 course meal, though.

905583247685496832 2017-09-06 00:07:25 UTC <MaconLoony> @S0mething_Weird And completely ignored @absurdistwords when he countered your 'proof'.
905582651712647168 2017-09-06 00:05:03 UTC <MaconLoony> @absurdistwords @TroublesomeGabe @S0mething_Weird You have, repeatedly. You may not think that is racism but that is because you have your own 'white' definition which excuses you.
905579735903817729 2017-09-06 23:53:28 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat @trickyvicar Oh no! Just as well a secular Victoria sponge tastes as good as a Church Fete one, then. Keep giving 'em hell, so to speak.

905576182455951361 2017-09-06 23:39:21 UTC <MaconLoony> @absurdistwords @S0mething_Weird When you said that black people don't encounter racism as often as they say they do.
905571685138649088 2017-09-06 23:21:29 UTC <MaconLoony> @absurdistwords @TroublesomeGabe @S0mething_Weird Oh, for crying out loud; you're a white person telling black people what it's like to be black. That is why you're a racist.
905568496662269953 2017-09-06 23:08:48 UTC <MaconLoony> @absurdistwords @S0mething_Weird Your argument was considered and very patiently. You might have better luck if you avoid telling black people what their lives are.

889917085148749826 2017-07-25 18:35:41 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat @lizwadsworth65 This one came to mind for me too. Wasn't there a negative reaction from early readers who felt they'd been unfairly misled?
889916014338736128 2017-07-25 18:31:26 UTC <MaconLoony> @AlisonMahony @Joannechocolat @calamityjane65 @chuckdrake50 No, she's telling the truth you're in search of.
889224519038238720 2017-07-23 20:43:40 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat @KittenHoliday Ah, you're one of those.
889193853907075072 2017-07-23 18:41:49 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat @KittenHoliday So what?
889190165285150722 2017-07-23 18:27:10 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat @KittenHoliday 'As of 2017 there are 300 female firefighters in the London Fire Brigade.' There's 300 more instances for you. Your comment is insulting.
884849202374868997 2017-07-11 18:57:44 UTC <MaconLoony> @writers_hq @jmgatford @fictionalsarah @Thomas_D_Lee @Joannechocolat I think they do but it's often interpreted as 'whining'. My dept. was told 'you're not paid to think, you're paid to do as you're told'.
884147977102774272 2017-07-09 20:31:19 UTC <MaconLoony> @lyonsron1 I thought she succeeded magnificently.
884146931018211328 2017-07-09 20:27:09 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat So are you in favour of perservion or not? Me, I don't mind it as long as it's well seasoned.
884113293182414848 2017-07-09 18:13:29 UTC <MaconLoony> @FLOTUS @POTUS @VP Ha ha ha ha haaaaaaaaa! Good one.
884111475031371781 2017-07-09 18:06:16 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 Goddamnit, why do I always see these things too late?
884104378612842496 2017-07-09 17:38:04 UTC <MaconLoony> @Antihippy @Joannechocolat The Catholic school in which I did my second teaching practice wanted to know if I 'lived in sin' with partner.
883684823684067328 2017-07-08 13:50:54 UTC <MaconLoony> @ericsnows Yep, it really does sound like you're saying 'women are what's wrong with this country.'
883433885513777153 2017-07-07 21:13:46 UTC <MaconLoony> @JudyTheresa66 I asked the same question a while ago. I miss the utter beauty of his insults.
883430326978183168 2017-07-07 20:59:37 UTC <MaconLoony> @LibyaLiberty @dunamos LibyaLiberty said 'us'. Clearly, that excludes 'you'. Consider yourself excluded.
883344229572935683 2017-07-07 15:17:30 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat I find it also delivers some home truths about the adult world, often in a gently comic way.
883343013577203712 2017-07-07 15:12:40 UTC <MaconLoony> @MarshallBuckley @Joannechocolat And estate agents.
883342290370146305 2017-07-07 15:09:48 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat @ScarletHarris For anyone who thinks 'The Handmaid's Tale' is far-fetched. This is the true, disgusting nature of patriarchy.
881931374160117761 2017-07-03 17:43:19 UTC <MaconLoony> @ArianeSherine @matthaig1 And with Joanne Harris!
881903845374390272 2017-07-03 15:53:56 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 This is the laziest angry email ever written.
881744061341863938 2017-07-02 05:19:00 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat Bon Anniversaire, Joanne! Hope your day is splendid.
881743575939239937 2017-07-02 05:17:05 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 Bon Anniversaire, Matt! Wishing you the happiest of days.

878972941190475777 2017-06-25 13:47:34 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat @christopherowen And also not living in the countryside - kept awake last night by frogs, cows, foxes, owls and our cat dealing with a mouse under the bed.
878690090893144065 2017-06-24 19:03:37 UTC <MaconLoony> @SaritaAgerman @Claire_Phipps @grimangus It was you who stated 99% instead of 100% so surely you have at least one in mind?
878687253295484928 2017-06-24 18:52:21 UTC <MaconLoony> @SaritaAgerman @Claire_Phipps @grimangus Ah, the old 99% statistic. Can't argue with such infallible evidence, eh?

874710568116125696 2017-06-13 19:30:25 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 Any chance of you coming to rural Haute-Marne, even though there are no bookshops?
874306976737525762 2017-06-12 16:46:41 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat Audio books are good but there is an intimacy in a loved one reading to you that they cannot replace.
874306265874411525 2017-06-12 16:43:52 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat @JaneLHodson How lovely to be asked!
874305549139161088 2017-06-12 16:41:01 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat I still love being read to.
874304090527944705 2017-06-12 16:35:13 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat @CaitlinCarrigan It's so important to do the voices!
874301113725583361 2017-06-12 16:23:23 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat Could I add - read to your teenager. Never had a GCSE class who didn't love having the text read to them. Especially if you do the voices.
873624017810444288 2017-06-10 19:32:51 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 you are a poet.
872530677916368900 2017-06-07 19:08:19 UTC <MaconLoony> A reason to live beyond tomorrow.
871057665484607490 2017-06-03 17:35:05 UTC <MaconLoony> @Peculiar Thank god, I saw this just in time. Have to make other plans for tonight now.
870290283895947264 2017-06-01 14:45:47 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 I said, and addressed, and added that you are argumentative and wrong. Now you are wrong again.
868912488838037506 2017-05-28 19:30:55 UTC <MaconLoony> @OzLizardKing @Joannechocolat Oh, I see. He meant 'links' as in 'personal involvement'. Then my response was too polite.
868874318004015104 2017-05-28 16:59:14 UTC <MaconLoony> @geekscanbecool You can have a boost from me too - fuck them, you're fabulous.
868857423402029058 2017-05-28 15:52:06 UTC <MaconLoony> @theresa_may My cat rather than you. Corbyn, if my cat is not eligible.

868855287226171394 2017-05-28 15:43:37 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 @chrisriddell50 This is just lovely.
868854933013098496 2017-05-28 15:42:13 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 You are argumentative and wrong.

867073067054485505 2017-05-23 17:41:43 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat You do. Intelligence and decency and kindness always win.
867072463246696448 2017-05-23 17:39:19 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat I agree, one for the police. What a shitbag.
863483660590354434 2017-05-13 19:58:42 UTC <MaconLoony> @operaandthecity @thekatywalker @BlaisTom I thought someone who actually lives in France should let you know that no, it isn't and no, we don't.
861627401796714496 2017-05-08 17:02:35 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 You forgot 'fabulous'.
861488149263986688 2017-05-08 07:49:15 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 Celebrating here today. FN did not win in our tiny hamlet for 1st time in many years. Whoop! whoop!
855134369555591169 2017-04-20 19:01:35 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat I'm so sorry it's happening, I really admire your stamina!
855134047064006658 2017-04-20 19:00:19 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat Just caught up with all the shit you've had thrown at you in last few days. The stupidity of these comments is shocking.

849645002745675781 2017-04-05 15:28:48 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 Have never found you to be stroppy; open, willing to engage, interested in debate - yes. Stroppy, no.
849633434041552898 2017-04-05 14:42:50 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 I live on the border between Burgundy and Champagne; you'd be most welcome to stay with us - in a non-stalkery way, of course.
849371190653276160 2017-04-04 21:20:47 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 Felicitations!
847898294286241792 2017-03-31 19:48:01 UTC <MaconLoony> @ComedyCentralUK Brilliant!
844813206170173440 2017-03-23 07:28:58 UTC <MaconLoony> @lewinick @matthaig1 I told him: he purred.
844812487706914816 2017-03-23 07:26:07 UTC <MaconLoony> @lewinick @matthaig1 I think your brain is a fine one.

842132109556895744 2017-03-15 21:55:15 UTC <MaconLoony> @Tanni_GT @guernseylibrary Yes, how many arrive at school hungry, tired, unwashed and still manage to learn? An enormous achievement.
842129655771586562 2017-03-15 21:45:30 UTC <MaconLoony> @guernseylibrary @Tanni_GT And this was in the 'affluent' south east of England.
842129389529751559 2017-03-15 21:44:27 UTC <MaconLoony> @guernseylibrary @Tanni_GT They were poor families and said since I was working I could afford it. I bought dinners on a regular basis too.
842094956336578560 2017-03-15 19:27:37 UTC <MaconLoony> @guernseylibrary @Tanni_GT I regularly had to buy tampons for some girls in my tutor group. Parents thought it was my duty.
834432092264083456 2017-02-22 15:58:08 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 I actually am a nobody and I care about buying your book.

833989114793963520 2017-02-21 10:37:54 UTC <MaconLoony> @kirkykoo79 @Joannechocolat Well, you've convinced at least this reader never to buy discount again.
833988060455043074 2017-02-21 10:33:43 UTC <MaconLoony> @kirkykoo79 @Joannechocolat Holy shit! I'd imagined 10% thinking, surely, it couldn't be lower than that.
833986295860969478 2017-02-21 10:26:42 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat French Govt. considers books as necessary an aid to kids in crisis-hit countries as water, food & shelter.
830891771244793856 2017-02-12 21:30:10 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 @shelh321 Did you come up with that all by yourself? Your parents must be so proud.
830859135981875200 2017-02-12 19:20:29 UTC <MaconLoony> @piersmorgan This is shit. Like everything else you say.

829427447963779082 2017-02-08 20:31:28 UTC <MaconLoony> 'Even the President of the United States must sometimes have to stand naked.' Horrible thought.
828738656873697284 2017-02-06 22:54:27 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 @KristineAz He's talking about the staggeringly vicious, angry trolling he's been getting. Perhaps you missed all that?
828243926553395200 2017-02-05 14:08:34 UTC <MaconLoony> @Peculiar UK, definitely. Cannot wait!
827915981829857280 2017-02-04 16:25:26 UTC <MaconLoony> @sturdyAlex I love "stockpiling" 5 a day; isn't that the recommended daily intake?

827298525058838529 2017-02-02 23:31:53 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 Please don't go. I am so full of admiration for your courage, we need you!

818575651934445574 2017-01-09 21:50:18 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 A startling lack of logic seems to be the defining characteristic of a fuckturnip supporter.
817495028419457024 2017-01-06 22:16:17 UTC <MaconLoony> @richardosman A treat! It wouldn't be no sport questions, would it?
816658980219002882 2017-01-04 14:54:08 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 @AndreasLeKirk never mentioned what you should write. sorry if that confused you.
816658387509383168 2017-01-04 14:51:47 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 Yep, first time I took a bus into town after my breakdown felt just like that.
816655122298183680 2017-01-04 14:38:48 UTC <MaconLoony> @LadyScyther He doesn't 'think' it, he's experienced it.

816651583136165888 2017-01-04 14:24:44 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 @AndreasLeKirk Rather than dictate what Matt writes on his own twitter page you could just unfollow/not read it.
811357202237812738 2016-12-20 23:46:45 UTC <MaconLoony> @Joannechocolat So Far Right logic now has it that Liberals are both hypersensitive snowflakes AND callous  lumps of stone.  *sigh*
811350490378334208 2016-12-20 23:20:05 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 But one 'eye-smile' beats a 'cunt' hands down so, here, I've sent you one.

810107429878898689 2016-12-17 13:00:37 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 oh yes.
810106044567392257 2016-12-17 12:55:06 UTC <MaconLoony> @matthaig1 @realMikeWilcox the viciousness and ignorance oozing from the lips of trumpers speaks volumes.
