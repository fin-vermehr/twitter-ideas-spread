The blessing and curse of our new modes of communication is that we can know from the inside, and still can do nothing bc we are w/o the power to do so.

956174463980195840 2018-01-24 14:38:51 UTC <AimeeReneeMpls> Let this sink in: "Tammy Duckworth will be first senator to give birth" If there has ever been a clear statement about the disproportionate demographic of the Senate, this is it.
956172890533085184 2018-01-24 14:32:36 UTC <AimeeReneeMpls> @CatherineNQE No offense, but I think the Bible itself is the first "fake news." However, I do appreciate the Pontiff's urge for clear-headed and accurate news and information. And I don't mind the comparison of those who would spread misinformation to serpents.

955906626443194368 2018-01-23 20:54:34 UTC <AimeeReneeMpls> Feeling hopeless because it feels hopeless. Because the NRA has our leaders in their pockets. Because Americans value guns over children's lives. Because Americans are so numb to this now, we all move on to the next trending topic. Nothing we do will matter until guns are gone.
955906048250056704 2018-01-23 20:52:16 UTC <AimeeReneeMpls> How can anything else matter when schools aren't safe? When morons say things like "What about all the other schools that didn't have shootings? How come the liberal media doesn't talk about that?" Is this our measure of success now? Children NOT getting murdered at school?

952627097457057792 2018-01-14 19:42:53 UTC <AimeeReneeMpls> @popcornreel Why can't they just be quiet? If you aren't adding anything productive to the convo, then just say nothing. It's okay to say "at this point, I'm going to stay quiet and just listen; it's time for women to have the floor." If they are confused by the convo, ask questions. Listen.

Some learn nuance, some innately understand it, some never will. I think that's why it needs to be talked about with our young people and become part of sex ed.
952616229944152064 2018-01-14 18:59:42 UTC <AimeeReneeMpls> @sadydoyle @dnlchrlsklly @spiegelmama He always acted a bit cagey when pressed to say anything about Louis C.K. and that's when I started to wonder about him. He also always struck me as someone who might be awkward in bed. Now we know. A level of awkwardness that translates into "haha aren't I adorable?" coercion.

But at the time, she hadn't learned yet. I'm sorry for you. I'm sorry for her. I'm sorry for all young women who have to go through something awful or even just gross to learn how to stay safe. How did men learn? Do they?
952604896104247301 2018-01-14 18:14:40 UTC <AimeeReneeMpls> @VictoriaInVerse It's sad to say, but I think we were all her in our teens and 20s. :( Unfortunately it takes so long for girls/women to get confident enough to not care if the guy likes you or not. To be strong of self enough to say "You're a creep. Get off me. I'm leaving."
952594648475820032 2018-01-14 17:33:57 UTC <AimeeReneeMpls> @DoreenGLM Also read to me as awkward inexperience, as she said, like a horny 18 yr old boy not experienced with nuance and reading signals. This awkwardness bordering aggression is why we need to add these discussions to sex ed for young people. Both parties should expect verbal consent.

951251129639297027 2018-01-10 00:35:17 UTC <AimeeReneeMpls> @schemaly Also, among illustrators, the highest paid (advance/royalty contracts) are male. They are offered more upfront and they negotiate harder.

Or using the phrase "sexual revolution" as a free pass for all bad behavior? #MeToo IS the sexual revolution where it is understand that nobody but oneself has agency over her/his body.
951210019420295170 2018-01-10 21:51:55 UTC <AimeeReneeMpls> @Angelheartnight I think what makes the "manifesto" gross is this final line: "And this freedom that we cherish is not without risks and responsibilities." For me it undermines any valid points that might have been made.

947950887326101505 2018-01-01 22:01:18 UTC <AimeeReneeMpls> It's been more than a year and I still can't get over knowing my own mother voted for Trump and continues to defend him. I've tried hard to not let this be a divide but I can't get over it. And now the army is sending my nephew to Korea and she thinks it's great.

946935394490290178 2017-12-29 02:46:05 UTC <AimeeReneeMpls> My kid's "magic trick" consists of him repeatedly guessing what card is in my hand till he finally throws the entire deck on the ground in disgust and stomps out of the room, after which I always proclaim loudly "Worst magic trick ever." And yet he will try again. And again.

Climate change is an inarguable and established fact. It's no longer up for dispute. The only thing we should be discussing now is what to do about it.

946199463038738432 2017-12-27 02:01:46 UTC <AimeeReneeMpls> Can we leave the "What a presidential president would have said" headlines in 2017? We all know he's a giant moronic classless ass, so let's move on to impeachment proceedings and stop being surprised he's not more "presidential." #ImpeachTrumpNow

I feel it's a good and honest acknowledgement, but not quite an apology. Maybe lets hope he will apologize to them directly.

691824471175462913 2016-01-25 03:26:22 UTC <AimeeReneeMpls> (I actually want a tiny house. For one. But you can come visit if you bring treats.)
691823917607096321 2016-01-25 03:24:10 UTC <AimeeReneeMpls> One positive thing you can say about Steven Avery is that he never called his trailer a tiny house.
691822559805980672 2016-01-25 03:18:46 UTC <AimeeReneeMpls> "I live in a tiny house" is a nice way to say you live in a trailer. Or, that you live in my 1950s rambler.
691821923731382273 2016-01-25 03:16:14 UTC <AimeeReneeMpls> Tho I'd like to see a show about tiny house-hunters. That is to say, a show about tiny people buying regular-sized houses. #funwithhyphens
691821340291108864 2016-01-25 03:13:55 UTC <AimeeReneeMpls> This year, shows about tiny house hunters. Next year, documentaries about all the hipsters who murdered each other in their tiny house beds.
