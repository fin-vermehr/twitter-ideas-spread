965218569696014336 2018-02-18 13:36:54 UTC <Sixers12345> The fact that it's a problem that there's a black driver in Nascar now shows how backwards their racist fans are. F that sport
965217271563071489 2018-02-18 13:31:45 UTC <Sixers12345> Mitchell did the same thing as Vince Carter..... But he missed the first attempt, that was not a 50. The only reason he got it was the jersey
965217091732299777 2018-02-18 13:31:02 UTC <Sixers12345> The dunk contest lacked any creativity other than DSJ's dunk or Nance Jrs bounce dunk.

963587586420822016 2018-02-13 01:35:57 UTC <Sixers12345> Points are the only thing that matter in the roty race now....
963587210296651783 2018-02-13 01:34:28 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Gonna prepare myself for Simmons to lose to Mitchell tho, hopefully he'll use that and the asg as motivation to get a jumper
963587029480198144 2018-02-13 01:33:45 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Of course rebounds will be an L compared to Simmons. Good points tho, however people only care about ppg for roty. Brogdon never should have won last year
963586846323339265 2018-02-13 01:33:01 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Assists tho? Maybe Mitchell should start stuffing the stat sheet more
963586022138400768 2018-02-13 01:29:44 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger He's played less than 37 games so far this year and he doesn't have Embiid level stats while doing so.... So no
963556676912795651 2018-02-13 23:33:08 UTC <Sixers12345> One thing I know, Mitchell and Simmons are both 10000000x better than Brogdon... Oh wait Dario is also better too

963440261442560000 2018-02-13 15:50:32 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Pure potential perspective it isn't. Maybe ur right cuz he's already proven and Doncic isn't
963439936463605760 2018-02-13 15:49:15 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger I said if Porzingis was healthy lol. If he isn't then Booker is top 2
963439525589643265 2018-02-13 15:47:37 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Booker is 3. Doncic is gonna be amazing
963439471013322753 2018-02-13 15:47:24 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Porzingis will always have more potential than Booker if he's healthy....

959507596385374208 2018-02-02 19:23:32 UTC <Sixers12345> If the memo does in fact end Mueller (it won't) I'll give the people credit who called it..... You think Mueller would lead an investigation with this scope without having the correct pieces to the puzzle?

957227517311684608 2018-01-27 12:23:19 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Oh nevermind u can't get all of them lol, but Fultz will be okay (hopefully)

951418383404331014 2018-01-11 11:39:53 UTC <Sixers12345> The reason so many players hate Bortles is that they see how bad he is and know that they can still win games because of how good their defense is
951417309339496449 2018-01-11 11:35:37 UTC <Sixers12345> After that January all star break the sixers FINALLY play tonight

951238089820852230 2018-01-10 23:43:28 UTC <Sixers12345> Play him while you develop Darnold or Allen, it's perfect for them.

938734886730510336 2017-12-07 11:40:12 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger I'm only content with that because I've seen how good Simmons is.... If he can even get a decent jumper he's a top 15 player easily
938734733260984320 2017-12-07 11:39:35 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger Everybody said the trade was fair and that they thought the Celtics would get more
938734647571251200 2017-12-07 11:39:15 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger No they didn't..... I thought they were gonna get fleeced.... BC wasn't fleeced
938734152156839936 2017-12-07 11:37:17 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger Booker for Fultz who says no
938734051522990081 2017-12-07 11:36:53 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger Simmons is so good the sixers may not even need Fultz. He'll just be icing on the cake if he is able to fit
938732876811702272 2017-12-07 11:32:13 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger I honestly think he needs to be shooting with his right hand. His free throw form looked way better with his right hand. I bet he'll switch hands within a year
938732140103131136 2017-12-07 11:29:17 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger I feel like once Fultz gets his jumper back he can play shooting guard. As long as he can shoot they should fit.
938730168193085442 2017-12-07 11:21:27 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger Hmm we'll see how Brett handles it
938729420738744321 2017-12-07 11:18:29 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger Bayless is trash. TJ will have to be relegated to a bench role when Fultz comes back
938728522214006785 2017-12-07 11:14:55 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger Well then don't act like the sixers are screwed at pg cuz they aren't. They just need Fultz to come back and TJ to play
938728389250338816 2017-12-07 11:14:23 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger I think it's already pretty pretty obvious he will be good. Or are you talking about injuries
938727518122717184 2017-12-07 11:10:55 UTC <Sixers12345> How'd that work out for Simmons guys? @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25

923135705089441793 2017-10-25 10:34:37 UTC <Sixers12345> He'd be bad in Cleveland easily. He'd be so much better than what they have now. Hue would ruin him thohttps://twitter.com/Noah_Becker/status/922942168066613254

923131291331162113 2017-10-25 10:17:05 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV They just wanted to "change" the narrative. In fact, the sixers should have started another season w/an injured rookie.

920240805733896193 2017-10-17 10:51:19 UTC <Sixers12345> This year is gonna be good, there was a ton of movement from players and it'll be interesting to see how their moves shake out.
920240668840218624 2017-10-17 10:50:47 UTC <Sixers12345> The NBA produces fun storylines every year. I tend to disagree when people say it's boring. I agree that the playoffs could be better
920240303319257088 2017-10-17 10:49:20 UTC <Sixers12345> Probably. I think that he will be playing 32+ way earlier than he did last year.
920239774048444422 2017-10-17 10:47:14 UTC <Sixers12345> Nah son. Embiid's mpg is based on him playing less than 3 preseason games. It will jump up after a week or two
920235634949804032 2017-10-17 10:30:47 UTC <Sixers12345> Yes, they're boring.https://twitter.com/TheCrossover/status/920235518197157888

918795292522242048 2017-10-13 11:07:22 UTC <Sixers12345> Wentz has 7 passing tds in the last 2 games. This is why you don't call a player a bust after one year.

918065377241944065 2017-10-11 10:46:57 UTC <Sixers12345> They only have to pay Embiid 94 million if they waive him after the 2018 season.... That makes the deal totally worth it

917770024936525824 2017-10-10 15:13:19 UTC <Sixers12345> The difference between Fultz and ball regarding scoring is that Fultz has handles and can get to the rack easily. Ball has one drive move
917740363221291008 2017-10-10 13:15:28 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Nope. This is a private shooting coach thing... Brown was salty

917716411702800385 2017-10-10 11:40:17 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @SirCleft 51% is BARELY "most" lol. Also the word fox in a source doesn't give me optimism that the source is correct and unbiased.
917714240068292608 2017-10-10 11:31:39 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @SirCleft Also how are you gonna whine about BLM protest violence and then complain about an extremely peaceful protest as well. Very hypocritical

907243994840694784 2017-09-11 14:06:38 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 They looked good.... Because Eli is bad and their offensive line is trash...
907243714430603265 2017-09-11 14:05:31 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Nah they have a harder schedule than last year. Their defense is worse too.
907243112791265280 2017-09-11 14:03:08 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Nah the Giants are just really bad at blocking. The cowboys will get less than 11 wins.
907241147109703680 2017-09-11 13:55:19 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 He is going to be good but he did nothing in week 1
907240899087912961 2017-09-11 13:54:20 UTC <Sixers12345> The eagles defensive line got even better and the Giants o line got worse. If they have Odell how will Eli have the time to throw to him?
907240616693813248 2017-09-11 13:53:13 UTC <Sixers12345> The Giants were absolutely trash even w/o Odell they seem like they won't be a threat when they play the eagles. Their line is too shitty

876456334027358209 2017-06-18 15:07:28 UTC <Sixers12345> He picked everyone I wanted in last years draft as well. That was his first good thing
876455792492281856 2017-06-18 15:05:19 UTC <Sixers12345> Yes, he did very well. I never expected him to make the right moves, I have to give credit where credit is due.

875128732373196800 2017-06-14 23:12:03 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 No one is picking him before 5. So they will be getting someone who could be better than Ball and someone who fits perfectly...
875128527531552768 2017-06-14 23:11:14 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Monk will probably fall to 5.... He fits perfectly with the sixers...

875121767525867520 2017-06-14 22:44:23 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Because it's warriors Cavs for at the very minimum 2 years. Only if LeBron leaves will it change. (Barring any injuries)

863010966753116163 2017-05-12 12:40:23 UTC <Sixers12345> @Bensmithten Or fans well at all either for that matter
863010922176147461 2017-05-12 12:40:12 UTC <Sixers12345> @Bensmithten The NFL does NOT treat their players right at all.
863010832992653312 2017-05-12 12:39:51 UTC <Sixers12345> @Bensmithten The reason I do not agree with this is because of Roger Goodell and the owner's ultra greediness. I'll take the NBA.

857960124455018496 2017-04-28 14:10:08 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 This year was a step in the right direction
857960083229216769 2017-04-28 14:09:58 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Those picks should guarantee a deep/good team by 2020 at the minimum. It will be a success it just requires even more patience.
857959936655077381 2017-04-28 14:09:23 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 U cannot say that because the sixers are going to get the Lakers pick either this year or next year as well as the kings first in 2019.

857957310051872768 2017-04-28 13:58:57 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 If you get 3-4 second rounders right then it means something

857954726918447105 2017-04-28 13:48:41 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 Yes I know 3 draft picks is better than 1. The browns did well

856144658505883648 2017-04-23 13:56:07 UTC <Sixers12345> @SirCleft The focus should be to improve every facet of education. U can't just put everybody in charter schools. Public schools need to improve.

854711426572832769 2017-04-19 15:00:58 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 1 pick is more valuable in the long run, but Fultz won't play like an MVP for at the minimum 3 years. They will need even more patience
854710704032632832 2017-04-19 14:58:06 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Because his team is closer to a championship.... If they can't get over the hump why not trade for Butler or PG(assuming he resigns)
854710447945207809 2017-04-19 14:57:05 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 I would too, but Celtics fans seem to want to cash in on their assets.
854710146022477824 2017-04-19 14:55:53 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Nah, but Ainge would be able to challenge the Cavs if they had Butler. They'll have to be more patient if they don't trade it for a star
854709974555127810 2017-04-19 14:55:12 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Still shouldn't be down 2-0. Only player I give a pass is Isaiah.
854709727787454464 2017-04-19 14:54:13 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Also a lot of fans were embarrassed that they got only 10 wins... Don't act like everybody was ecstatic about it...

843982540671275009 2017-03-20 00:28:12 UTC <Sixers12345> @negadelphia76 Simmons and Embiid are injury liabilities especially with this medical staff. Could use another franchise guy
843981797750923265 2017-03-20 00:25:15 UTC <Sixers12345> @negadelphia76 Yeah, the top 5 players could all be franchise players. Not many years you could say that for
843975908126081024 2017-03-20 00:01:51 UTC <Sixers12345> So funny, I sort of feel bad for him cuz he's a good guy but he hasn't been good at all this year.
843975361989959680 2017-03-20 23:59:41 UTC <Sixers12345> The good thing about this draft is that a player with Monk's potential will be there at 5. Monk=500x better than last year's 5th. (Dunn)

836247490928259072 2017-02-27 16:11:53 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV Did u fucking know he's gonna be on Kimmel this week?
836247183737376774 2017-02-27 16:10:39 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Remember when Tommy said he wasn't coming over this year tho
836245046609514500 2017-02-27 16:02:10 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Yeah so let's give it more time lol. I'm just speculating
836244659764604928 2017-02-27 16:00:38 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 No. But Dario could be the safety net that Nerlens was slated to be. BC and Co don't seem to dislike him either
836244427500826624 2017-02-27 15:59:42 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 It's too early to say that so take it with a grain of salt. Simmons should be totally fine for the start of 17-18
836244281451024385 2017-02-27 15:59:08 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 We'll see how he finishes out this season. If Dario is good enough maybe they can survive w/o Ben... Idk maybe
836243777203363841 2017-02-27 15:57:07 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 More cool with it than Nerlens would be. If he outperforms 6th man money maybe not idk

836228265027244032 2017-02-27 14:55:29 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Um he basically three away money by coming this year... He would have made more if he came in 2017-18....

833814561644040193 2017-02-20 23:04:17 UTC <Sixers12345> Not as my first team but they'd probably be top 3-4. Would be so happy if he succeeded for both the fans and would validate..

833773466075668481 2017-02-20 20:20:59 UTC <Sixers12345> @thezhayes Or maybe this is a simulation, but I doubt the universe just started on it's own randomly. Something had to have been done lol
833773313625378817 2017-02-20 20:20:23 UTC <Sixers12345> @thezhayes If it isn't God then it's some other being that created this universe. Maybe an alien race that is insanely advanced.

831588194265219073 2017-02-14 19:37:30 UTC <Sixers12345> Hield is at least producing for his team now. Dunn is absolutely crapping the bed.

831490473080528896 2017-02-14 13:09:11 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @FREDFFIV They probably took him along slowly to tank
831487696811991041 2017-02-14 12:58:09 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @FREDFFIV Does Hornacek do anything that Phil doesn't want? Not at all. Phil forces him to play the triangle
831487493497352192 2017-02-14 12:57:21 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @FREDFFIV You and Tommy need to read some books on management in the NBA. There is a ladder, Brett is lower.pic.twitter.com/OXT2B4d67z

831485956930826240 2017-02-14 12:51:15 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @FREDFFIV He suffered no setback solly Wong.

831485662511689728 2017-02-14 12:50:04 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @alyxwonger Yes it is. It's called mismanagement of an injury. I also bet you he's close and they're holding him back to tan
831484945860276225 2017-02-14 12:47:13 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Yes, u can see other teams wanting a center are looking at other deals. He effed it up
831483502130495489 2017-02-14 12:41:29 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @FREDFFIV They had month long injuries, not week long ones
831483223838511104 2017-02-14 12:40:23 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Keith Pompey is aight, not great.
831482935366844416 2017-02-14 12:39:14 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger And it wasn't a Philly beat writer reporting that it was imminent it was everybody....
831482817162919937 2017-02-14 12:38:46 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Not the beat writers fault the deal was imminent and BC fucked up. Stop being Tommy and being dumb
831482608244649984 2017-02-14 12:37:56 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @FREDFFIV Which was wrong lol this is ownership and BC. He definitely wants to plqy
831481974883811328 2017-02-14 12:35:25 UTC <Sixers12345> Michael Flynn resigned? Very good
831481444287578113 2017-02-14 12:33:19 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger You're so fucking salty dude. I didn't see him injure his foot or back so he's fine.
831481260325351425 2017-02-14 12:32:35 UTC <Sixers12345> SIMMONS RECOVERY WAS 8 MOTHER EFFING WEEKS GET HIM BACK SERIOUSLY, IT'S BEEN 21
831480193395068928 2017-02-14 12:28:20 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Hmm it's as if he is a human and humans get injured. But keep thinking his career is over tho for this minor injury
831479731824508928 2017-02-14 12:26:30 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger I'll say you were right when he is officially shut down for the season.
831479588958113792 2017-02-14 12:25:56 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @alyxwonger It was honestly ridiculous tho. It was a 3-4 month injury at the most.
831479250356207616 2017-02-14 12:24:36 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Yeah I do, idk what happened with that but someone has effed up.
831350464235110401 2017-02-13 03:52:51 UTC <Sixers12345> @Philly__Nation Bryan did not do that. It was always a myth.
831337097193742337 2017-02-13 02:59:44 UTC <Sixers12345> @vinfosh Will he be hitting his prime in 2-3 years when we're contending for titles, no Smith Jr will be a year or tow/three from his lol
831336889386938369 2017-02-13 02:58:54 UTC <Sixers12345> @vinfosh Yes he's better because he's a vet. Smith can shoot better than him
831336812677181444 2017-02-13 02:58:36 UTC <Sixers12345> @vinfosh Dennis Smith Jr
831336266486730753 2017-02-13 02:56:26 UTC <Sixers12345> @vinfosh Because he's 26. I'll take a younger version who can score better(however passing isn't half as good)
831335487600222210 2017-02-13 02:53:20 UTC <Sixers12345> @vinfosh ...Nah I'll take Fultz, Ball or Smith Jr

831322936145506305 2017-02-13 02:03:27 UTC <Sixers12345> Dario is about to take that ROTY trophy from Embiid, but I forgot who drafted those two very good players.

831119612695683072 2017-02-13 12:35:31 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 He is partly responsible now. All he's done is make excuses on how it's not his fault. Quit whining
831119009361850369 2017-02-13 12:33:07 UTC <Sixers12345> @xst05 Would be extremely awkward if he isn't traded before the deadline and has to come back
831118890965020673 2017-02-13 12:32:39 UTC <Sixers12345> @xst05 At this pt it sort of has to happen of BC keeps having trouble. There's no way they can fix this situation.
830947091249651713 2017-02-12 01:09:59 UTC <Sixers12345> @rayd1475 @JasonAAV He's has a role as a bench PG, he's definitely good enough for that.

830918940771639300 2017-02-12 23:18:07 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Yes, I thought we were gonna get more transparency, but he's doing the same things.
830918649544323072 2017-02-12 23:16:58 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Players want to play if they can. Sorry, it's called competitive nature you must have heard of it before.

830915608258736131 2017-02-12 23:04:53 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 He was sorry.
830915269082103809 2017-02-12 23:03:32 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 I see why he wanted to play. Nationally televised game at home. He even killed it too lol.
830914722656616448 2017-02-12 23:01:22 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 It also could be put on Harris as well. He probably pushed to let him out there against Houston too
830914588493348865 2017-02-12 23:00:50 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Like his trades and signings so far... But his handling of this situation hadn't been too good

830913716086513664 2017-02-12 22:57:22 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Of course Embiid wanted to play, u can play with a torn meniscus do he probs thought he was fine.
830913562856083458 2017-02-12 22:56:45 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Yes, I feel like BC should have said f no. But he's too stupid with decisions like that. More annoyed at him

830913194738778112 2017-02-12 22:55:17 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 But he didn't. If he did I would have to deal with the fact that he is literal glass and can't handle light dance
830912635247935489 2017-02-12 22:53:04 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 But walking puts pressure on it too. Is he not allowed to walk. His dance was literally walking
830912007222222849 2017-02-12 22:50:34 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 You mean either be fully cautious or let him play?
830911624110338050 2017-02-12 22:49:03 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Dancing isn't playing in an NBA game. Think about that for a second and you'll realize that.
830911371143442435 2017-02-12 22:48:03 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Or at least healthy enough to dance which he may have been.
830910927453184002 2017-02-12 22:46:17 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 They needed to be more cautious with it and not put him out there tho. BC lies so much
830910790622396416 2017-02-12 22:45:44 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 And the injury isn't shit sorry Wong. Slightly torn meniscus CAN be played on, but he shouldn't have.
830910638201397253 2017-02-12 22:45:08 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 ... I crucified BC because he freaking let him play with it... It's deserved

830777239612563456 2017-02-12 13:55:03 UTC <Sixers12345> But would Hinkie have played Embiid with a torn meniscus against the Rockets on ESPN?  Highly doubt it.

830437316434993153 2017-02-11 15:24:19 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 That was before he got hurt.... Less enthused about it now if he isn't 100% things change

828257991145185281 2017-02-05 15:04:28 UTC <Sixers12345> I'm ready for the NFL season to be over. Sorry, I had to say it. This season sucked major ass. Hopefully it won't be a trend.
828250530233344000 2017-02-05 14:34:49 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Which is correct, it's why the Spicer thing is so funny. She doesn't play it.

828037744211402754 2017-02-04 00:29:17 UTC <Sixers12345> I am SOOO glad Thibs isn't coaching the sixers. It would be a given that Embiid would break his foot again after he is free of restriction.

827920591416066049 2017-02-04 16:43:45 UTC <Sixers12345> @StonedPhillyFan No, but Noel and Saric are good players. Okafor is the only one looking like a bad player other than Mcw
827920209013010433 2017-02-04 16:42:14 UTC <Sixers12345> @StonedPhillyFan And the point of it was to get AAAA superstar. They win you titles so Hinkie succeeded in that sense
827920060735950848 2017-02-04 16:41:39 UTC <Sixers12345> @StonedPhillyFan Saric is looking pretty good... Much better than Elfrid Payton would have been. Also Noel still counts because he is good

827513341274886145 2017-02-03 13:45:29 UTC <Sixers12345> But it shows he CAN shoot them, which is important. No chance Jah can imo. It's good to have it as a threat
827512102722084864 2017-02-03 13:40:34 UTC <Sixers12345> I didn't know Jahlil could shoot 3's at a 36% rate lol
827511588072673280 2017-02-03 13:38:31 UTC <Sixers12345> But he isn't as bad as Jahlil tho. He can shoot and rebound which makes him better. I hope Jah succeeds cuz he's been classy

826235905182728192 2017-01-30 01:09:25 UTC <Sixers12345> I really hope the sixers have a pick in the draft, they sort of need it as their final draft piece.

825359354438250496 2017-01-28 15:06:19 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @SirCleft The most radical Muslims are bad and they need to gtfo. Radical anything is bad.
825359177333735425 2017-01-28 15:05:36 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @SirCleft Do u actually think most of the Muslims in their respective countries are evil. Or is it the top ppl holding them down
825357805825712129 2017-01-28 15:00:09 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @SirCleft You can't just paint every single refugee to be terrible because we've gotten attacked by lone wolfs a few times.
825355451604819969 2017-01-28 14:50:48 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @SirCleft But why in the hell would Muslims come here if they hate our way of life? Oh yeah it's because USA is way better....
825355181395214337 2017-01-28 14:49:44 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @SirCleft You're reading too much Breitbart. I tried finding how many Muslims in America wanted Sharia and that came up so no.
825354314826842112 2017-01-28 14:46:17 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @SirCleft I'm fairly certain they'll do another ban.
825354105505869825 2017-01-28 14:45:27 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @SirCleft Because that proper vetting won't be proper. It will be harshly unfair. They already have good vetting
825353395699593217 2017-01-28 14:42:38 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @SirCleft U still don't understand that..... They rushed in those places without any vetting..... The u.s has an ocean between...
825353149175185410 2017-01-28 14:41:39 UTC <Sixers12345> @SirCleft They just want better surveillance tech. Not something stupid like a wall. Ppl rnt coming that way anyway
825353029276811264 2017-01-28 14:41:11 UTC <Sixers12345> @SirCleft The wall makes surveillance worse as well. Was reading that a lot of the workers like that they can see through the fence.
825352818521419777 2017-01-28 14:40:20 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @SirCleft If your family couldn't get away from a civil war because of an idiot I think you slowly get angrier and angrier
825352307307077632 2017-01-28 14:38:19 UTC <Sixers12345> @SirCleft The wall is going to cost 15 billion, I thought "Mexico is going to pay for it" though? Waste of money and time.
825351788899495936 2017-01-28 14:36:15 UTC <Sixers12345> @SirCleft Saudi Arabia is the worst with that, are they blocked? Oh no they aren't. Why is that? Oh yeah conflicts of interest.
825351420463443968 2017-01-28 14:34:47 UTC <Sixers12345> @SirCleft But is it 65% of Muslims in America tho? No it isn't.
825351003474161668 2017-01-28 14:33:08 UTC <Sixers12345> @SirCleft I did not see that at all. It's one person too lol.
825350232452059136 2017-01-28 14:30:04 UTC <Sixers12345> @SirCleft That is more than likely false... They come here for better rights and freedoms
825350062834323456 2017-01-28 14:29:23 UTC <Sixers12345> @SirCleft U can still get refugees effectively. You don't need to block them coming here. That isn't what our country is about.
825349834844622849 2017-01-28 14:28:29 UTC <Sixers12345> @SirCleft Because the Muslims here will get pissed off dude. This isn't how we should treat anyone just cuz we're scared of a scary refugees
825349333017038850 2017-01-28 14:26:29 UTC <Sixers12345> @SirCleft This will only make the problems worse. I was never worried about attacks on the country but some of those moves will anger many
825349119451480065 2017-01-28 14:25:38 UTC <Sixers12345> @SirCleft 0 refugees is disgusting. They aren't terrorists. Raised mortgage prices, blocking entry to u.s from 7 countries for 90 days.

824614419900592128 2017-01-26 13:46:12 UTC <Sixers12345> Is Embiid already better than gobert? I say yes, because gobert isn't a two way player. He can't play O half as well. #sowwy

824309155611738115 2017-01-25 17:33:12 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV MCW at least had some upside with size and they thought they could develop his shot. Not a dumb pick at all
824309060652662785 2017-01-25 17:32:49 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV But Embiid turned out to be the right pick even w/injury years. Okafor and MCW(less so) were the only "bad" picks

824080872513175556 2017-01-24 02:26:05 UTC <Sixers12345> Celtics are looking very good IMO. Horford is amazing what a signinghttps://twitter.com/BenGolliver/status/824080512037728256
824079898679660545 2017-01-24 02:22:13 UTC <Sixers12345> @Chizzy_GetsBusy ...Idk about that
824079121269526528 2017-01-24 02:19:07 UTC <Sixers12345> *A lot of the sixers W's this year have been better.

824076162955669504 2017-01-24 02:07:22 UTC <Sixers12345> Same. I was growing weary, but never fully gave up. Knew he would succeed with better playershttps://twitter.com/JoeGiglioSports/status/824075971649212419

820424875668045824 2017-01-14 00:18:27 UTC <Sixers12345> If you don't like Brett as a person you are stupid imohttps://twitter.com/JClarkCSN/status/820380212768763904
820423439135731712 2017-01-14 00:12:45 UTC <Sixers12345> Very impressed with him lately. He's creeping up to that 15 per w/a 13.5. #pointzhttps://twitter.com/NBA/status/820404014265286656

820257928783527937 2017-01-14 13:15:04 UTC <Sixers12345> @vinfosh On pure talent DeMarcus. Marc Gasol if I was in a win now mode. Maybe Rudy Gobert
820255971020853248 2017-01-14 13:07:17 UTC <Sixers12345> Had to say false on this one. He's definitely the best center in the east. Probs top 3-4 center in the leaguehttps://twitter.com/vinfosh/status/820255773251043328

820254628759662593 2017-01-14 13:01:57 UTC <Sixers12345> @Sixers12345 JR. Not injury reserve Smith
820254558639288320 2017-01-14 13:01:41 UTC <Sixers12345> The Korver trade will look even better when I R Smith comes back

820252851515621378 2017-01-14 12:54:54 UTC <Sixers12345> People make excuses about Embiid's stats because they are salty that he's playing so well and that everybody loves his play.
820252139796697089 2017-01-14 12:52:04 UTC <Sixers12345> The sixers have he best defense in the east since December 1st. But Embiid fouls a lot so he isn't good at d according to idiots
820251647268048896 2017-01-14 12:50:06 UTC <Sixers12345> This is why you pay Noel 17 mil to play off the bench.https://twitter.com/DerekBodnerNBA/status/820251320376590336
820246836778823680 2017-01-14 12:30:59 UTC <Sixers12345> Ingram was always a project but I'd take him any day over Dunn.
820245504294526976 2017-01-14 12:25:42 UTC <Sixers12345> Kris Dunn has an 8.7 per and is shooting 29% from 3. Wow he would have been SOOO good but oh yeah he sucks

813102106295017473 2016-12-25 19:20:23 UTC <Sixers12345> Doubt they would have gotten Simmons if Hinkie picked Porzingis, but Porzingis may have more upside than Simmons by a bit

810923090813349889 2016-12-19 19:01:45 UTC <Sixers12345> The Sixers fans totally expect losing in their rebuild. The 3-0 start changed fans minds of what this season would be
810922912677056512 2016-12-19 19:01:03 UTC <Sixers12345> Because the Sixers never exceeded expectations like the Eagles did in the beginning of the season.

809964835320561664 2016-12-16 03:33:59 UTC <Sixers12345> I mean the game is close now lol
809963744352727040 2016-12-16 03:29:39 UTC <Sixers12345> @HurkaDoesSports He's lost so much value at this point. Both him and Jah have lost their value.
809963067387813888 2016-12-16 03:26:58 UTC <Sixers12345> @HurkaDoesSports At some point they need to get rid of the logjam tho
809957911166382080 2016-12-16 03:06:28 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Russell and Enable are good. Ingram is a project. They're losing their pick this year to who oh yeah the sixers
809957720401002496 2016-12-16 03:05:43 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Wrong. Ingram is a stick and not playing that well
809957437348388865 2016-12-16 03:04:36 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 They've lost 8 straight. The sixers just won 2 straight so
809957226320371712 2016-12-16 03:03:45 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 So you can say they're in a better position because of one measly game?
809956909637922816 2016-12-16 03:02:30 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 Russell also is good, but the Sixers have more pieces/picks
809956808659968000 2016-12-16 03:02:06 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 All depends on Ingram and Simmons. But Ingram isn't playing that great.

808335681554706432 2016-12-12 15:40:19 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 But he was the foundational piece the team would build around for years. Most imp.part of tank
808334908762554368 2016-12-12 15:37:15 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 If the gm tanked, then you can call that back for A LOT of the success with LeBron
808334725555355648 2016-12-12 15:36:31 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 So they tanked in 02? If they did, then the gm is very smart.
808334518134472705 2016-12-12 15:35:41 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 And he will get 95% of the credit for the Lakers pick because he got that from MCW
808334403642527745 2016-12-12 15:35:14 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 But that didn't happen. Hinkie gets some credit for Simmons bc we didn't have the pick before he cam
808334264613949440 2016-12-12 15:34:41 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 LeBron was the easiest choice tho. If that 03 gm got you picks that turned into Kyrie then yes
808334042970157056 2016-12-12 15:33:48 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Yeah that's probably true
808333911474536449 2016-12-12 15:33:17 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Having LeBron come home was the only chance you guys had at relevancy in the playoffs

808333662085386240 2016-12-12 15:32:17 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Hinkie will have picked 2/3 of the main core players. Embiid is the foundational piece.
808333565519921152 2016-12-12 15:31:54 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 No, because LeBron came back.
808333332501168128 2016-12-12 15:30:59 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Because after he broke his foot I said they should have gone with Gordon or Smart(both suck)
808333228759248900 2016-12-12 15:30:34 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV And don't you dare go revisionist history and say that Embiid was the easy choice.
808332652910678016 2016-12-12 15:28:17 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV WOW did BC pick Embiid tho? Oh wait he didn't
808332227180457984 2016-12-12 15:26:35 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 How is elfrid Payton doing as well? Because he traded him for Saric... Hmm
808332037476196352 2016-12-12 15:25:50 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 But the superstar center just started playing now. We have a stat caliber player. Noel/okafor arent
808331794387009536 2016-12-12 15:24:52 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 Was a decent pick with some upside at the time
808331510411624449 2016-12-12 15:23:44 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 How are embiid and saric doing? Noel is also good I don't care if he won't be here it wasn't a whiff
808331290437160960 2016-12-12 15:22:52 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 The one who didn't trade Mcw for a top 14 pick. So Hinkie gets credit for that. Didn't know your takes could get worse
808330879990906880 2016-12-12 15:21:14 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Hinkie is gonna get a top 14 pick(top 10 right now) for MCW. Hmm that is bad value tho
808330172709687296 2016-12-12 15:18:25 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Those are picks he got. Sorry that counts you really care so much about making him look bad
808330050357653504 2016-12-12 15:17:56 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Disgusting that you think that. Sorry that the fo was scared of being patient
808329097684385792 2016-12-12 15:14:09 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 I don't care about that because he Sixers are going to get two top 14 picks because of him
808328892473806848 2016-12-12 15:13:20 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 De'Aaron Fox isn't worth it for McW because we had to wait 2 years according to you idiotic logic
808328684394446848 2016-12-12 15:12:31 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 This is what you still don't understand. Hinkie's make won't be done with until Lakers pick/sac swap
808326695405162496 2016-12-12 15:04:36 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV But would I take Jrue over Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball or De'Aaron Fox? No so
808326526789947392 2016-12-12 15:03:56 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Okafor was the only one that was disgusting. Mcw had some upside.
808326396040871936 2016-12-12 15:03:25 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Well the sixers are going to be good. Simmons hasn't even played...
808326187277778944 2016-12-12 15:02:35 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Jrue, Thad Iggy were the only good players you are still naive about how "good" that team was
808325686637236224 2016-12-12 15:00:36 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 The Astros tanked for at least 3 years so
808325488070586368 2016-12-12 14:59:48 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 The idea is good and I see the sixers are improved and they already have a star so it was worth it
808325381384261633 2016-12-12 14:59:23 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Stop whining about tanking anyway. The browns are doing it and you like it. That simple
808312821306036225 2016-12-12 14:09:28 UTC <Sixers12345> Stop complementing Jeff Fisher. His offense is definitely one for elementary schoolershttps://twitter.com/ESPNNFL/status/808312466484690944

808299675010928641 2016-12-12 13:17:14 UTC <Sixers12345> If the Sixers get the 10th pick in the draft (De'Aaron Fox or Malik Monk) was the MCW trade worth it?
808298684362457088 2016-12-12 13:13:18 UTC <Sixers12345> Oh hell yes @Nevers_Failureshttps://twitter.com/rich_hofmann/status/808171800307830785
808147444999536640 2016-12-11 03:12:20 UTC <Sixers12345> This is obviously a joking poll(somewhat) w/the Dunn question. Even w/Murray they'd probs only have 1-2 more winshttps://twitter.com/Sixers12345/status/808147179378536448
808147179378536448 2016-12-11 03:11:16 UTC <Sixers12345> Why are the TWolves 6-18?
808143850699157505 2016-12-11 02:58:03 UTC <Sixers12345> Raise your hand if you thought the Sixers and the TWolves would have the same record at 24 games.
808120658798452736 2016-12-11 01:25:53 UTC <Sixers12345> @Sixers12345 *Or is still terrible because they obviously aren't terrible .

808058322133848064 2016-12-11 21:18:11 UTC <Sixers12345> At least Wentz had a great game, he needed one.

808056968543895552 2016-12-11 21:12:48 UTC <Sixers12345> Can we end this season now so Wentz can get help
808056037223841792 2016-12-11 21:09:06 UTC <Sixers12345> Yeah they think they're doing something "different" it's funnyhttps://twitter.com/darienhoops/status/808055864804286464

808015885407518720 2016-12-11 18:29:33 UTC <Sixers12345> @NBA @TommyBeer @vinfosh You'd have him at 50 cuz u think he's that bad.
808013886838411264 2016-12-11 18:21:37 UTC <Sixers12345> lemme guess, Carson had another play where he showed that he's actually good.....

808000938795565057 2016-12-11 17:30:10 UTC <Sixers12345> @NBA @TommyBeer @vinfosh I did rookie year because he had "bad" players around him then, except this year's team is way better than last
808000759308701696 2016-12-11 17:29:27 UTC <Sixers12345> @NBA @TommyBeer @vinfosh I just sent you stats of their rookie year dude. Noel has averages 8.1 rebounds Jah averages 7. 1 rebound dif huge
807998604161990658 2016-12-11 17:20:53 UTC <Sixers12345> @NBA @TommyBeer @vinfosh If you use things that no one uses idk how many arguments you're gonna win.
807998404521508873 2016-12-11 17:20:06 UTC <Sixers12345> @NBA @TommyBeer @vinfosh What are their comparisons for that then
807997880040652800 2016-12-11 17:18:01 UTC <Sixers12345> @NBA @TommyBeer @vinfosh His total rebound% is higher as well. Granted this is when Jah "wasn't pulled away like you think he is now"
807996818718072832 2016-12-11 17:13:48 UTC <Sixers12345> @NBA @TommyBeer @vinfosh Compare their rookie seasons. Nerlens' WS are way higher than Jah's. Also he doesn't have a negative vorppic.twitter.com/Mb546XxRHt
807995741532725248 2016-12-11 17:09:31 UTC <Sixers12345> @NBA @TommyBeer @vinfosh You're showing me the same useless highlights. Jah is not valuable in today's nba. There was 0 reason to pick him
807995119349669888 2016-12-11 17:07:02 UTC <Sixers12345> @vinfosh You are showing me highlights without looking at the statistics of how disgraceful he is at rebounding and defense. Also his - +/-
807994445295742976 2016-12-11 17:04:22 UTC <Sixers12345> @vinfosh Or defense, or pick ability or any speed
807994347794923521 2016-12-11 17:03:58 UTC <Sixers12345> @vinfosh One highlight. He is elite at rim protection and will have a place in the league for years. Jah's skill is NOT marketable w/o rebs
807993124635181057 2016-12-11 16:59:07 UTC <Sixers12345> @vinfosh Okay your hate of Nerlens is annoying, he is definitely valuable. Both Jahlil and Nerlens will be gone at some point.
807991135775952896 2016-12-11 16:51:13 UTC <Sixers12345> I love this draft so much. When I compare the projected 10th pick this year and last year it's comical. De'Aaron Fox vs Thon Maker lol
807990214421573632 2016-12-11 16:47:33 UTC <Sixers12345> Remember when the Lakers were going to make the playoffs and the Sixers were gonna get a bad pick? Lol keep losing
807984944618278912 2016-12-11 16:26:37 UTC <Sixers12345> @bball_ref @DerekBodnerNBA @vinfosh See, Nerlens is comparable to Embiid. Jah is not.
807961974076276736 2016-12-11 14:55:20 UTC <Sixers12345> @StonedPhillyFan The only reason I'm a bit excited is because I want to beat the Skins. If we weren't playing an NFC East team...
807961405123162112 2016-12-11 14:53:04 UTC <Sixers12345> @hoopscritic @CTowersCBS @vinfosh I just think he should do a better job defending and rebounding for a center
807961287615479809 2016-12-11 14:52:36 UTC <Sixers12345> @hoopscritic @CTowersCBS @vinfosh Comparable skills. That's the one thing Okafor does well I won't trash his back to the basket game

807955080863420416 2016-12-11 14:27:57 UTC <Sixers12345> @hoopscritic @CTowersCBS @vinfosh His defense is almost as good. He has one comparable part of his game Okafor has 0.
807951621829304325 2016-12-11 14:14:12 UTC <Sixers12345> @hoopscritic @CTowersCBS @vinfosh No he isn't being asked to do too much. I don't see Embiid having problems.
807950377253556225 2016-12-11 14:09:15 UTC <Sixers12345> @hoopscritic @CTowersCBS @vinfosh It's more than that as well. He can't defend anybody, can't get any rebounds and has a dinosaurs.skillset
807948963164852224 2016-12-11 14:03:38 UTC <Sixers12345> @hoopscritic @CTowersCBS @vinfosh I don't want an unathletic center with no j on my team.

801179291757268992 2016-11-22 21:43:23 UTC <Sixers12345> @PFF @TommyJones_25 Wentz will ball out with better receivers next year
801178900889935872 2016-11-22 21:41:49 UTC <Sixers12345> @PFF @TommyJones_25 Lots of ints against some really good defenses.
801178840395579392 2016-11-22 21:41:35 UTC <Sixers12345> @PFF @TommyJones_25 2 ints and 1-2 ints against the Viking and Seahawks. Those are not games where you should rail a rookie for.
801177884891222016 2016-11-22 21:37:47 UTC <Sixers12345> @PFF @TommyJones_25 Because his receivers can't get open and he isn't confident in them. Also Doug does not open up the field cuz of that
801176509146873856 2016-11-22 21:32:19 UTC <Sixers12345> @PFF @TommyJones_25 Wentz isn't going to be average. He looks average because of his crap receivers. You haven't seen how bad they've been?
801175835117961216 2016-11-22 21:29:38 UTC <Sixers12345> @PFF @TommyJones_25 I hate to say this but the cowboys are better as of now. Eagles have the better d but the cowboys have a way better o
801175251728171012 2016-11-22 21:27:19 UTC <Sixers12345> @PFF @TommyJones_25 Okay sure. He's totally better than Wentz. Not
801174872529502208 2016-11-22 21:25:49 UTC <Sixers12345> @PFF @TommyJones_25 A lot of people complain about Pff dude come on
801174801326841856 2016-11-22 21:25:32 UTC <Sixers12345> @PFF @TommyJones_25 Above average to star. Browns won't get a qb this year either. The crop is even worse.
801174538956382208 2016-11-22 21:24:29 UTC <Sixers12345> @PFF @TommyJones_25 Pff sucks tho
801174468722761730 2016-11-22 21:24:13 UTC <Sixers12345> @PFF @TommyJones_25 Wentz is obviously gonna be good. He just needs better weapons
801174352032972800 2016-11-22 21:23:45 UTC <Sixers12345> @PFF @TommyJones_25 How the hell is he supposed to be as good as he can be with his trash wr core? Come on.
801174254154825729 2016-11-22 21:23:21 UTC <Sixers12345> @PFF @TommyJones_25 But they weren't so
801173473171243008 2016-11-22 21:20:15 UTC <Sixers12345> @PFF @PatMcManamon @TommyJones_25 So you know Wentz is good? But what the browns are doing is better?

800424446582554629 2016-11-20 19:43:53 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Cousins would bully Noel. He won't bully embiid the same way

800409308680847361 2016-11-20 18:43:44 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 Yes which means that it shouldn't be a fireable offense losing to them.
800408965746229249 2016-11-20 18:42:22 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 You are so obsessed with wins, the sixers are starting to win more so relax.
800408867767283712 2016-11-20 18:41:59 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 2 in 4 days dude calm down. Last year they got there 3rd win December 30th. It's called improvement
800408487016599552 2016-11-20 18:40:28 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 It's just simple to see. Literally the only guy playing badly is Cov and he will probably start playing well again.
800408353382035456 2016-11-20 18:39:56 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 Nah Jrue is back and he crushed when he played. They'll be better.
800407227576238085 2016-11-20 18:35:28 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 Nah because they see Embiid crush so they're better than they were. Also BC helps the image of them not being the same

800388357541003264 2016-11-20 17:20:29 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 But we don't know that for sure. Embiid, Saric weren't here last year. Hence why this year is different
800387885786660864 2016-11-20 17:18:37 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 I can see that if it happened last year, but not this year. They won't be a 10-15 win team.
800386755866279936 2016-11-20 17:14:07 UTC <Sixers12345> So every time the Sixers beat a team their head coach deserves to be fired?

800346752301801473 2016-11-20 14:35:10 UTC <Sixers12345> Stauskas literally went 8/9 with 5/6 3 pointers so this good version is probably here to stay. Hard to imagine how big his turnaround is  .
800345676244656128 2016-11-20 14:30:53 UTC <Sixers12345> The sixers are not bad enough to justify Simmons sitting a whole year so any talk of that can stop nowpic.twitter.com/e7O0EFivQV

800344172452573184 2016-11-20 14:24:55 UTC <Sixers12345> Last talking point. Nik Stauskas has a 13.5 per, Booker has a 13. Booker is obviously better but they'd funny
800342988266213376 2016-11-20 14:20:12 UTC <Sixers12345> I told you guys this season would be different, obviously it is. This team is Sooo much better

800214766635597824 2016-11-19 05:50:42 UTC <Sixers12345> @StonedPhillyFan Oh Pursuit definitely looked better but I like the actors in this film
800213573037342720 2016-11-19 05:45:57 UTC <Sixers12345> @StonedPhillyFan Pursuit of Happiness was great come on. Seven pounds wasn't that good though
800212823234093056 2016-11-19 05:42:58 UTC <Sixers12345> @StonedPhillyFan It looks good....
800199577894797312 2016-11-19 04:50:21 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV He's gonna resign for at least 4 more years and by then the sixers will be good so relax
800199476069670912 2016-11-19 04:49:56 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV That is a joke. So he isn't gonna resign with the team that was patient with him after he was crap at rehabbing?

800195375931867137 2016-11-19 04:33:39 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV Yeah they're so fucking scared cuz he's fucking killing it. He's making us right by showing the bpa was worth it
800160609572687872 2016-11-19 02:15:30 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 He still is let's calm down. Just in a funk.
800152634535583744 2016-11-19 01:43:48 UTC <Sixers12345> I think it's time to bring up how Hinkie traded nothing to get Stauskas and a valuable pick swap so
800152229344727040 2016-11-19 01:42:12 UTC <Sixers12345> NIK ROCKS

800116887229186048 2016-11-19 23:21:46 UTC <Sixers12345> @StonedPhillyFan Also when Simmons comes back, I guarantee the Sixers are gonna be a respectable bad team.

799043177688821761 2016-11-16 00:15:13 UTC <Sixers12345> I had a hot take at the beginning of the season that the sixers will have more wins.... What if it comes true?

799028363893624832 2016-11-16 23:16:21 UTC <Sixers12345> What did he do this time
799023345698295822 2016-11-16 22:56:25 UTC <Sixers12345> @Chuckles152 How about no.
799007313277440000 2016-11-16 21:52:42 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 You're still forgetting that Embiid and Dario are playing great. That means Hinkie had a great 2014 draft so...
799007186357784578 2016-11-16 21:52:12 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Still was a good pick. He was #thefirstcenter
799005929014431744 2016-11-16 21:47:12 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger That still counts. He played on the team for 2 years. He is a good player so it isn't 2/5
799005805785862149 2016-11-16 21:46:43 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger ...Because he is a top 3 player in that draft....
798996148555894784 2016-11-16 21:08:21 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 I will always trash that pick, but Noel was a piece and a good pick. You have stupid rules
798996022202601472 2016-11-16 21:07:50 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Nah actually. Okafor was the bad pick because he is too much of a liability
798994928068153345 2016-11-16 21:03:30 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 He played well the last two years so you need to count it. He was a good pick at 6
798994321571713024 2016-11-16 21:01:05 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Your logic is stupid because Noel was a hit. Noel, Saric, Embiid. 3/5 is actually totally fine....
798993886211411968 2016-11-16 20:59:21 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Who cares embiid is better and is going to be a superstar so... All yu have to do is trade Noel then okafor
798993756271869953 2016-11-16 20:58:50 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 But that's called fucking rebuilding sorry it takes longer than the dumb "1 year" solution
798993581075632128 2016-11-16 20:58:08 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Any competent gm that didn't have a center more talented than Embiid would have taken Embiid
798993485189828610 2016-11-16 20:57:46 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 No because embiid was gonna be out for a year anyway. Noel isn't close to Embiid talent wise so....
798992881860169728 2016-11-16 20:55:22 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 U forget about Noel?
798991794117623809 2016-11-16 20:51:02 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Yeah but that was the sixers situation so. They would not have picked him. I'd say the celtics would have at 6 tho.
798989230701580288 2016-11-16 20:40:51 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Lol so the Magic would have picked Embiid?
798987942089936897 2016-11-16 20:35:44 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Ppl were talking about the Lakers picking him if he dropped to 7.
798987857260146688 2016-11-16 20:35:24 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger I highly doubt he would have been picked at 3 if someone else had the pick. Injury risks were too high for some teams at thetime
798975591924035585 2016-11-16 19:46:40 UTC <Sixers12345> Wowhttps://twitter.com/TonyGrossi/status/798945156112285696

798948280197595136 2016-11-16 17:58:08 UTC <Sixers12345> Embiid and Saric playing well shows that Hinkie's worst mistake was going bpa with Okafor. Noel/Embiid case can be made but u can't have 3 C

798945518831468544 2016-11-16 17:47:10 UTC <Sixers12345> Hmm but both of the top 2 picks were Hinkie picks. I thought Hinkie was terrible at drafting? Oh wait he made one bpa/bad choicehttps://twitter.com/SHowardCooper/status/798938061895700480

798917808222511104 2016-11-16 15:57:03 UTC <Sixers12345> No, because the Eagles have shown they can play with good teams. No way they crush the Seahawks at home thoughhttps://twitter.com/975TheFanatic/status/798917428990201856

798917505548894208 2016-11-16 15:55:51 UTC <Sixers12345> @Nelson81 @TennesseeHoney_ I mean Agholor has had 2-3 flashes of good play in 2 years. Come on he fucking sucks. Dgb needs a higher motor
798917227793752064 2016-11-16 15:54:44 UTC <Sixers12345> Lol Kat you're great but if you go 2-7 and 3-10 on 3 pointers in the last 2 games maybe you should relax on taking them as much....

798898620934266880 2016-11-16 14:40:48 UTC <Sixers12345> If the Lakers picked Jahlil the 76ers would be unreal w/D'Angelo. That will always piss me off

798697922409988097 2016-11-15 01:23:18 UTC <Sixers12345> @JasonLloydABJ @TommyJones_25 Fine. Simmons is hurt so calm down.

798697239505936384 2016-11-15 01:20:35 UTC <Sixers12345> @JasonLloydABJ @TommyJones_25 He hit on the superstar his first draft. Embiid got hurt for 2 years. Difference is injuries.
798696443112550400 2016-11-15 01:17:25 UTC <Sixers12345> @JasonLloydABJ @TommyJones_25 But yes, 10 wins was horrific and I don't think he planned for it to be that bad.
798696356370087937 2016-11-15 01:17:05 UTC <Sixers12345> @JasonLloydABJ @TommyJones_25 Wow. I don't care about wins in a rebuild that big

798688118648012800 2016-11-15 00:44:21 UTC <Sixers12345> @JasonLloydABJ @TommyJones_25 But I guess I'd agree with that, although being worse than Grant doesn't mean Hinkie's bad...
798688023776993280 2016-11-15 00:43:58 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @JasonLloydABJ LeBron. Last time I checked Hinkie didn't have the best player in the world at his disposal.

797476173177561089 2016-11-12 16:28:30 UTC <Sixers12345> @JohnBarchard @terilyns68 Nah absolutely no reason to get rid of him until the end of the season. The players obviously like him.

797456256072093698 2016-11-12 15:09:22 UTC <Sixers12345> I'm fairly certain Embiid will be an all star this year because it's a fan vote

795679532346933249 2016-11-07 17:29:18 UTC <Sixers12345> The most amazing thing about Embiid is that I was expecting him to be rusty... He doesn't look like he hasn't played in 2 years. It's insane
795679016183283712 2016-11-07 17:27:15 UTC <Sixers12345> Hmmhttps://twitter.com/KevinOConnorNBA/status/795642519639953408

795671519695425536 2016-11-07 16:57:27 UTC <Sixers12345> @Sixers12345 Hinkie has failed with some of his draft choices but that doesn't mean tanking will always be dumb.
795671382294196228 2016-11-07 16:56:55 UTC <Sixers12345> @Sixers12345 Asset accumulation is one million times better than trying to be 42-42 every year. You just have to use your assets correctly
795671107995103232 2016-11-07 16:55:49 UTC <Sixers12345> @Sixers12345 If they don't(Okafor) then problems are created. Tanking is smart but making the wrong draft decisions can ruin it
795670892202381312 2016-11-07 16:54:58 UTC <Sixers12345> Just because there are a few outliers for lucky mediocre teams doesn't mean tanking is stupid. The tanking team has to make the right picks
795670171629289472 2016-11-07 16:52:06 UTC <Sixers12345> His defense isn't just "a work in progress" it's trash. Relax sb nationhttps://twitter.com/SBNationNBA/status/795652029079318528

795627224405786624 2016-11-07 14:01:26 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Man Bennett was so good. I'm gonna complain that Hinkie "would have picked him" bit he didn't tho so
795626926220214272 2016-11-07 14:00:15 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 I need to do hw sowwy
795626772356354048 2016-11-07 13:59:39 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Stop building up Embiid? No I can't sorry. You thought he'd suck ass so f off.
795626563136012288 2016-11-07 13:58:49 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Um no he didn't. Literally only Okafor was the trash pick. Mcw was definitely for a need and semi-upside
795626396777402368 2016-11-07 13:58:09 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 You bring up all these players like Hinkie should have all of them. So stupid he can't pick every gem
795626231555297280 2016-11-07 13:57:30 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 And he definitely isn't good at small forward. At pf maybe but the magic are idiotic
795626112772636672 2016-11-07 13:57:01 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Aaron Gordon isn't good. Embiid is already showing why it was such an easy decision to pick over him
795625963736485889 2016-11-07 13:56:26 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 And stop being stupid Saric and Embiid are already playing well with each other..
795625896296218624 2016-11-07 13:56:10 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 I mean I no Noel and Embiid would work better than Oka/Noel. Embiid can space the floor, okafor can't.
795625313346658308 2016-11-07 13:53:51 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Just disregard the 25 per please. I know it's 4 games bit you don't do that of u suck
795625215279632384 2016-11-07 13:53:27 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Embiid, Saric, Noel not ring any bells? They are talent. You're not smart enough to realize that
795625014687125504 2016-11-07 13:52:40 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 I care because I know he's put them in a position to succeed later. But u guys idk it's sad
795624857782382593 2016-11-07 13:52:02 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 I cannot believe how much u guys care about a fired gm on a team you don't like.
795624736936103936 2016-11-07 13:51:33 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Um no. Literally no gm ever would have picked him that high he wasn't that good at Kentucky. Partly Cal's fault
795623686778785792 2016-11-07 13:47:23 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger I mean no one was gonna pick Booker at 3 so relax. I was talking about the Suns it's too bad they didn't get Simmons not
795619505741426693 2016-11-07 13:30:46 UTC <Sixers12345> Devin Booker would be the perfect pairing with Simmons.... Sowwy Suns

795067903821447169 2016-11-05 00:58:54 UTC <Sixers12345> The year is 2025. Embiid is coming off of his 4th consecutive MVP award. People are still complaining that he has injury concerns.
795067552053465088 2016-11-05 00:57:30 UTC <Sixers12345> Don't give a fuck about Embiid's injury concerns until he actually rebreaks his foot. Right now his foot is fine

795054138249932800 2016-11-05 00:04:12 UTC <Sixers12345> My soul dies when Embiid goes out of the game and Okafor(in his current state) comes in.
795052805975371776 2016-11-05 23:58:54 UTC <Sixers12345> The reason the Sixers got Ersan is because he can shoot threes. They badly need that but #ripJeramidunks
795052121573982208 2016-11-05 23:56:11 UTC <Sixers12345> I should listen to you lol. I'm making definitive statements alreadyhttps://twitter.com/talkhoops/status/795051848604360704
795051764617768960 2016-11-05 23:54:46 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Because they have been poop I'm worried
795051283413692416 2016-11-05 23:52:51 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger I am fairly certain the Timberwolves will get their shit together tho lol they have Kat that's all they need
795051118753681408 2016-11-05 23:52:12 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Calm down. Embiid and Saric playing is "different" enough. Plus Simmons in January
795050978756227072 2016-11-05 23:51:39 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger I no right? Kat ONLY has a measly per of 23. So bad imo get your shit together
795050705379794944 2016-11-05 23:50:34 UTC <Sixers12345> @samhinkie Please tell me why you picked Jahlil over the Gawd Kristaps. Please
795050163261894657 2016-11-05 23:48:24 UTC <Sixers12345> I'm sorry but wasn't Minnesota supposed to be insane this year? Where is this jump?
795049516139421698 2016-11-05 23:45:50 UTC <Sixers12345> @Chizzy_GetsBusy @Free_DMStafford I doubt that....

795015359241789440 2016-11-05 21:30:06 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger Yeah that's why I want to trade him and there's a logjam.
795014949462372353 2016-11-05 21:28:29 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV @alyxwonger I for one didn't know how good the pg crop in the next draft was gonna be. Sowwy it's that simple.
795014260426416128 2016-11-05 21:25:44 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger Wow good analysis. You know at the worst one of them is gonna be gone at the end of this year.
795005280090198020 2016-11-05 20:50:03 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Ivan Rabb is said to be going around 10. Is he better than Maker? Hmm I'm fairly certain he will show he is
795004841915543554 2016-11-05 20:48:19 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 By that will never be known since I'm sure Noel will be gone
795004712944881664 2016-11-05 20:47:48 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Noel and Embiid could work. Embiid can stretch the floor. Okafor can't. In that aspect it could work
795004561857581056 2016-11-05 20:47:12 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Noel was never a bad pick. Okafor was by far the worst first round pick. Mcw was for need and some upside
795004336338333696 2016-11-05 20:46:18 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 No embiid is just good stop
795004206532952064 2016-11-05 20:45:47 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Noel(fine pick), Mcw(decent at the time), Embiid(looking good), Dario(wow also looking good), Okafor(pretty meh)
795003792106389504 2016-11-05 20:44:09 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Wasn't Hinkie's fault that management gave away their first pick before he got there.
794968552658890752 2016-11-05 18:24:07 UTC <Sixers12345> @oh_sohilarious He's checked out on the Sixers though. He's a lost cause, I hate to say it.
794965505002061824 2016-11-05 18:12:00 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 Um hell no but he did well last draft. Thought he would screw up but he didn't. I'm worried about his trades more than drafts
794963746288496641 2016-11-05 18:05:01 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 He did perfectly in his first try at least. There's hope for him yet. This draft has at least 5 elite pgs.
794961628668325889 2016-11-05 17:56:36 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 Real players that aren't 100% upside will be there at 10. Thon is interesting tho but he's 55 so solly
794961521092820992 2016-11-05 17:56:10 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 Yeah there is definitely value there. Thon maker isn't gonna be picked at 10 this year.
794961180662042628 2016-11-05 17:54:49 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 The Sixers will get their pick if they're outside of that... I want them to be better. Don't think they're outside of 10 tho
794961033785917440 2016-11-05 17:54:14 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 The thing is tho is that it's good that they won. Don't want them to be one of the top 3 worst teams.
794951551815131137 2016-11-05 17:16:34 UTC <Sixers12345> @sixerhive I would like him to play sg for the Sixers tbh.
794951282251493376 2016-11-05 17:15:29 UTC <Sixers12345> @sixerhive Isn't he playing shooting guard now?
794950881070514177 2016-11-05 17:13:54 UTC <Sixers12345> ++++++++ No more logjam of death. You can split minutes with 2 centers, but I'm not so sure Okafor wants to play on the bench...
794950627348676609 2016-11-05 17:12:53 UTC <Sixers12345> That trade would be fine tho because it seems like Noel's value has diminished and that's a decent return.

793906761254264832 2016-11-02 20:04:56 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 3-1 lead is a 3-1 lead. Same as in the NBA.
793906126018535424 2016-11-02 20:02:25 UTC <Sixers12345> Yeah...no. so wrong Derek Carr is miles ahead of Dakhttps://twitter.com/ESPNNFL/status/793905084463779840

793854437525688321 2016-11-02 16:37:01 UTC <Sixers12345> Wow, I thought Embiid's minutes would hinder him in the roty race, but so far they have not.https://twitter.com/SHowardCooper/status/793854082347782145

793806622133026816 2016-11-02 13:27:01 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Going to Ireland, literally nothing happens there. People just dance in the streets and drink Guiness
793806286471237632 2016-11-02 13:25:41 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Hillary has bad people too, but when the kkk endorses you sorry I am not gonna like that
793806200076955649 2016-11-02 13:25:20 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Tbh it's mainly the hate I have for a lot of his support base. I don't want them to get even more empowered.
793805906240765952 2016-11-02 13:24:10 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger because I know she will be a bad president and I don't want to be connected with putting her there.
793805631757189120 2016-11-02 13:23:05 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger And I hate Hillary a lot but I'll take her over Trump. Not gonna vote for her tho
793805491252133888 2016-11-02 13:22:31 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger No she shouldn't be, but if Trump was more of a normal candidate he's be crushing her. It's his fault.
793805236276256768 2016-11-02 13:21:31 UTC <Sixers12345> Embiid's per is 22.9 right now.
793804882537054209 2016-11-02 13:20:06 UTC <Sixers12345> When Embiid averages as many assists as Wiggins does then there is a problem.
793803039543062528 2016-11-02 13:12:47 UTC <Sixers12345> @Dcorrigan50 eh idk about that. I would watch this game over the embiidless Sixers tonight

793634829191512064 2016-11-01 02:04:22 UTC <Sixers12345> @StonedPhillyFan Let's wait until Simmons plays to take out the torches....

793625134246596608 2016-11-01 01:25:51 UTC <Sixers12345> Don't wanna hear shit about Embiid. If he stays healthy he IS going to be a superstar
793623790454468608 2016-11-01 01:20:31 UTC <Sixers12345> @SirCleft loved that one
793623437646372864 2016-11-01 01:19:07 UTC <Sixers12345> @SirCleft ...It still had punch tho.
793622938809499648 2016-11-01 01:17:08 UTC <Sixers12345> Not gonna feel bad for the Indians if they lose game 7 because the Cavs won the title.
793622649087922176 2016-11-01 01:15:58 UTC <Sixers12345> I like how people think the Sixers have nothing to show for their tanking. Embiid/Dario and Simmons... hmmm It's called being patient
793621392667340800 2016-11-01 01:10:59 UTC <Sixers12345> @SirCleft There should definitely be more but what's there is poignant. #vocab

793193870892740608 2016-10-31 20:52:10 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Wrong like usual.
793193140324802560 2016-10-31 20:49:16 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV That's idiotic. So let's say he scores 25 ppg this year(not happening) with 24 mpg. He isn't worth it? You need better logic
793181881604771840 2016-10-31 20:04:31 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV WE ARE NOT BRAINWASHED, HINKIE HAS MADE MISTAKES HE IS NOT PERFECT

793180111029673984 2016-10-31 19:57:29 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 But Hinkie's pick swaps and Lakers pick may keep it balanced so relax
793178830055669760 2016-10-31 19:52:24 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Okafor and Noel will be gone at the very latest next summer pending embiid's health. Calm down with your whining about the logjam
793178598970503168 2016-10-31 19:51:29 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Last time I checked starters didn't play 48 minutes. I didn't know that.
793178414135975936 2016-10-31 19:50:45 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Sergio Rodriguez is a placeholder but someone we SORELY needed last year to begin the year
793178119548997632 2016-10-31 19:49:34 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Orlando is a cesspool. They have no one even close to Embiid, Saric, or Simmons talent wise. No Gordon at SF is not close.
793177892444213248 2016-10-31 19:48:40 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 I like to actually have the chance to get players who win you titles (not really okafor) bit Embiid and Simmons are so calm down
793177761573593088 2016-10-31 19:48:09 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 You care too much about wins and losses. It's so sad.
793177181270659074 2016-10-31 19:45:51 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Said it was a 7 year plan from 2012-2019 (contention for a title). Sooo it actually means you have to wait until then to judge it haha
793176718622154752 2016-10-31 19:44:00 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Please tell me how this is stupid. The Sixers could win the title next year and get the #1. Please how is that dumb. Enlighten me.

793176113266593792 2016-10-31 19:41:36 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Just because the Kings pick swap and the Lakers pick hasn't churned out yet DOES NOT make them bad assets. Only you impatient ppl think that
793175880285552640 2016-10-31 19:40:41 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Well Embiid got hurt the next year so.... That's a reason
793175544892301312 2016-10-31 19:39:21 UTC <Sixers12345> @SirCleft @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 They have better offensive weapons. But their defense is nothing.
793175426386362369 2016-10-31 19:38:52 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Embiid. Please tell me how you can't see the talent he has.
793175209616343040 2016-10-31 19:38:01 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @SirCleft @FREDFFIV The Eagles will be legit when they add weapons and cb's to their roster which may take a year or 2
793175099209678848 2016-10-31 19:37:34 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @SirCleft @FREDFFIV Yeah yu can f off Tommy. See the Flyers are legit. The Eagles will be in 1-2 years... R u really that short-sighted...

793124987188019200 2016-10-31 16:18:27 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 Now that 2012 Sixers team could have been something with the right gm and owner but they got lucky with Jrue.
793124789040787457 2016-10-31 16:17:39 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 The Browns haven't started tanking, they've been tanking for 20 years
793124689082068992 2016-10-31 16:17:16 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 We just have different views on when to tank. You like to have decent/mediocre teams because all of ur teams are usually trash. I don't

793123577541165056 2016-10-31 16:12:51 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 Feel free to explain how the hell this is "competing". It's called needless mediocrity.pic.twitter.com/XYFGLF7TrG
793122754228740098 2016-10-31 16:09:34 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 Stop. You aren't allowed to cheer for tanking. Flip flop for you
793121716385947648 2016-10-31 16:05:27 UTC <Sixers12345> Not even mad about this. It probs should lol it's the World Series compared to an important regular season gamehttps://twitter.com/richarddeitsch/status/793108081257381888
793103182524215296 2016-10-31 14:51:48 UTC <Sixers12345> @brian_jenks Nah Wentz needs talent around him. Tired of fucking drops
793102949706829825 2016-10-31 14:50:53 UTC <Sixers12345> Gotta give credit to the MLB they held down Eagles Cowboys in ratings. Remember when that one guy said it would get terrible ratings?

793089511500685313 2016-10-31 13:57:29 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 I can trash pederson for a game full of questionable decisions against the Eagles most hated rival. Sorry if you don't do that
793089361218772992 2016-10-31 13:56:53 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 But he made a terrible decision so he deserves to be trashed for a little while. And i am fairly certain they did.
793088621888868353 2016-10-31 13:53:56 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 They did make the playoffs so maybe they would be more happy?
793088198494842880 2016-10-31 13:52:16 UTC <Sixers12345> @Jeff_McLane @FREDFFIV Okay I RARELY use the same gifs

793087796743462912 2016-10-31 13:50:40 UTC <Sixers12345> @Jeff_McLane @FREDFFIV We never use the same gifs chill. Tommy is the culprit with that
793081078537981952 2016-10-31 13:23:58 UTC <Sixers12345> Screenshotters please screenshot this. I WILL NOT FLIP FLOP ON WENTZ
793080814582042624 2016-10-31 13:22:55 UTC <Sixers12345> Of course, it could be that he doesn't think trust any of his receivers to make a play.....
793080727202037762 2016-10-31 13:22:34 UTC <Sixers12345> Pederson is still a good coach, but for God's sake please DO NOT HAVE ANOTHER GAME LIKE THAT
793080478832164864 2016-10-31 13:21:35 UTC <Sixers12345> @Jeff_McLane If you guys were comedians you'd be out of a job because you make the same jokes every day. Try to innovate for once
793080306282749952 2016-10-31 13:20:54 UTC <Sixers12345> I will admit I am actually butthurt about this a Cowboys loss. Pisses me off so much
793078543504773120 2016-10-31 13:13:54 UTC <Sixers12345> @Jeff_McLane This was never funny
793078266068340736 2016-10-31 13:12:47 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger I mean, I still like Pederson. Unlike you wierd fans I get angry if my coach loses a game.

793060167378087937 2016-10-31 12:00:52 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger Um no. You guys just don't understand that people don't make the same decisions every game. He had A REALLY bad game play calling wise

792940348003586053 2016-10-30 04:04:45 UTC <Sixers12345> Yeah, it may be the Cowboys division as of now. Sorry to say
792936281965592576 2016-10-30 03:48:36 UTC <Sixers12345> No that's great. I thought it was over 10 minutes ago.
792935407830704128 2016-10-30 03:45:07 UTC <Sixers12345> Absolutely insane how he held on to that

792912005090844672 2016-10-30 02:12:08 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 You don't pass on Embiid unless you're a fucking idiot. Exum WOW, Gordon, WOW. Smart, WOW. No. None of them are close prospect and skillwise
792911120105222144 2016-10-30 02:08:37 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 No it actually wasn't. The Okafor one was the bad one. Lol
792909760467087360 2016-10-30 02:03:13 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 He also drafted Embiid, Dario, Jerami, Kj, Richaun. All good picks so
792909206198231040 2016-10-30 02:01:00 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 ...Because they needed a pg and thought he could be good w/a fixed jumper
792909107372052481 2016-10-30 02:00:37 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 I mean I guess the you can already see the future with the Kings pick swap and the Lakers pick. Okay
792908891180769281 2016-10-30 01:59:45 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @FREDFFIV Remember how you judge Ainge. BOTH trades and draft selections. You disregard Hinkie's great trades
792908578264784896 2016-10-30 01:58:31 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 And Kings pick swap for FUCKING STAUSKAS. Mcw for Lakers 5-10 pick. Please keep saying he sucks tho
792908449285677056 2016-10-30 01:58:00 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 I mean it's so simple. Embiid is legit sorry. You're too dumb to realize they DID NOT FUCKING have the pick that became Simmons b4 hinkie
792908205399564288 2016-10-30 01:57:02 UTC <Sixers12345> Brb ordering my Sturgis jersey now

792905311925309441 2016-10-30 01:45:32 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Nope. Kings is a pick swap. The Sixers get the Lakers pick if they meet the criteria. Not a swap....
792905190881964032 2016-10-30 01:45:03 UTC <Sixers12345> MCW for Tony Snell is smart, but MCW for the chance for a top 5-10 pick in a loaded draft is dumb

792904314834399232 2016-10-30 01:41:34 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 The Sixers and Lakers played the same team. One team lost by 6. One team got crushed. That simple.

792743437120536577 2016-10-30 15:02:18 UTC <Sixers12345> @FREDFFIV @TommyJones_25 Yes, probably because he rebroke his fucking foot tommy

791649625065263105 2016-10-27 14:35:53 UTC <Sixers12345> Embiid was insane and Simmons/Bayless were hurt. I'd say that was a pretty good loss.

790935234824900608 2016-10-25 15:17:09 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger You act like I say Okafor was the right pick, he wasn't. Porzingis was and they were scared of Emb
790935073377824768 2016-10-25 15:16:31 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger If you have that many picks you need to hit more often. I don't see a Jerami/Kj/Richaun there
790934916124913666 2016-10-25 15:15:53 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger Sorry if it hurts your feelings but they will probably be good this year so Hinkie will look smart
790934820117286912 2016-10-25 15:15:30 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger Dario and Embiid are playing right now idk if u understand that.
790934355983998976 2016-10-25 15:13:39 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger You use hindsight with Hinkie ALL the time and I can't use it?
790933644818776064 2016-10-25 15:10:50 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger Yes and they don't but he was really raw coming out
790932815923654658 2016-10-25 15:07:32 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger But how is he doing tho?
790932746092675073 2016-10-25 15:07:16 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger Sullinger is okay but Fab Melo is done
790932508477042688 2016-10-25 15:06:19 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger Nevermind Rozier was the year after. No Young wasn't.
790932000127393792 2016-10-25 15:04:18 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger Rodney Hood and Gary Harris dude I told you some. He picked Rozier over them
790931539655692288 2016-10-25 15:02:28 UTC <Sixers12345> @TommyJones_25 @alyxwonger No I never said that. Okafor pick was bad. But Ainge has had a longer list of failures

790930124526845952 2016-10-25 14:56:51 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 MCW was just traded for atony Snell and you act like Hinkie's trade with the Lakers is bad.
790926142022844416 2016-10-25 14:41:01 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Management didn't expect to hem to be that bad for that long.
790926049777442817 2016-10-25 14:40:39 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Now we're going to see his picks in action. Saric and Embiid will show if he was good at drafting
790925890989461508 2016-10-25 14:40:01 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Simple. The management couldn't handle the L's. I was getting annoyed as well, but he was good

790922024457822208 2016-10-25 14:24:39 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 He's definitely had 4-5 good trades Tommy. His picks have been decent -Okafor instead of porzy pick
790921843406430208 2016-10-25 14:23:56 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 Oh I'll agree with that but he had Pierce Kg and Allen to fleece the Nets with tho

790920566106644481 2016-10-25 14:18:52 UTC <Sixers12345> Just because the Sixers haven't gotten the picks from the Lakers and Kings yet doesn't make it a bad trade..... Please understand that
790920365895741440 2016-10-25 14:18:04 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 You're always wrong about judging Hinkie Tommy.
790920227215314944 2016-10-25 14:17:31 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 You're not patient at all. Also remember he made the trade that for us Simmons. Didn't have that first before
790920090128646145 2016-10-25 14:16:58 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 He's drafted Noel(still good), Embiid(probably going to be good), Saric(going to be good). Calm down.
790919904623026176 2016-10-25 14:16:14 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger @TommyJones_25 So MCW for a first rounder is a bad trade? What about Stauskas for a pick swap with the kings?

790909021519749120 2016-10-25 13:32:59 UTC <Sixers12345> @alyxwonger Not Terry Rozier if they already had Smart they don't need him. Also Rodney Hood and Gary Harris are way better than Young
790907268552327168 2016-10-25 13:26:01 UTC <Sixers12345> Feel free to take a look at his draft selections the last 3 years and keep telling me he's a genius. He is a genius at tradinghttps://twitter.com/KevinOConnorNBA/status/790907014067159042
