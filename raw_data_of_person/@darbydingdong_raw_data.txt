This, repeated mass murder, is the outcome of the current laws in place. The number of deaths far outweighs whatever meager reason you have for supporting guns.

964753898371153920 2018-02-16 06:50:28 UTC <darbydingdong> @ScottSterner4 If your child gets murdered at school, which by the way things look right now, the chances of that happening are rapidly increasing, are you going to stand up and say there's nothing wrong with the law as it stands? You're REALLY going to take the gun's side over your dead kid?

698622892137795584 2016-02-13 21:40:51 UTC <darbydingdong> I thought there was a ghost in my house and I was going to die but it turned out to be me sitting on the volume button for the TV

698412309601882113 2016-02-12 07:44:05 UTC <darbydingdong> @katiemartens1 I am considering selling it because even though i really love them the lumineers are my everything, but (contd)
