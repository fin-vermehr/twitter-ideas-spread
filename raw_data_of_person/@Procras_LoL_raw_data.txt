965598463365996545 2018-02-19 14:46:28 UTC <Procras_LoL> @HalSparks Gotta add in the infamous believe me!
899892826942656512 2017-08-22 07:15:43 UTC <Procras_LoL> @FionnOnFire It's the trophy, right? Definitely gotta be the trophy.
891752540186042370 2017-07-30 20:09:08 UTC <Procras_LoL> @MikeLoftus_ I just woke up after 34 hours awake. It wasn't fun at all. Get some rest.
889979718979780608 2017-07-25 22:44:34 UTC <Procras_LoL> @sumika920 @PokemonGoNews Flying Spaghetti Monster confirmed?
878528984971128832 2017-06-24 08:23:26 UTC <Procras_LoL> @MikeLoftus_ I miss mine being that tiny. Now he's 70 pounds of energy.
875088279451963392 2017-06-14 20:31:18 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ADsolo3 I can relate. I fought it for ages but now it seems like 3 hours is what I need to function for the next 21 hours. That and coffee.
875049298785906689 2017-06-14 17:56:25 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ADsolo3 Think I'm averaging about 3 hours of sleep. Usually from about 7am-10am. Trying to sleep at night doesn't work.
863121404589481985 2017-05-12 19:59:13 UTC <Procras_LoL> @asabfb I've been waiting for this for so long. Can't wait. The hype is real.

850113077395820546 2017-04-06 22:28:46 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ADsolo3 Must be nice. We are getting hit here.
849080450341629954 2017-04-03 02:05:29 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ADsolo3 Lol sounds like a typical week here in Ohio.
849079583660027904 2017-04-03 02:02:02 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ADsolo3 Can confirm, it's a snowflake. We have one here too for Thursday. Then 70 on Monday.
846086124779032576 2017-03-26 19:47:06 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ADsolo3 How have you managed not to kill someone yet?!?
846063614595383301 2017-03-26 18:17:39 UTC <Procras_LoL> @Della807 @CincyPD @ccblueyes70 both
844240454614945792 2017-03-21 17:33:04 UTC <Procras_LoL> @JulianRCollins @Glitchedlotus No breakfast, just a continuation of writing a research paper for class.
844229324542791681 2017-03-21 16:48:50 UTC <Procras_LoL> good morning
843708684144447488 2017-03-19 06:20:00 UTC <Procras_LoL> @AramisKnight88 @danielwuyanzu Season premier was absolutely amazing! Definitely excited for more!
841143406797705216 2017-03-12 04:26:30 UTC <Procras_LoL> @BDO_News So a few friends were trying to buy the explorer's package but the page just refreshes constantly and they can't buy it.
840261106530734082 2017-03-10 18:00:33 UTC <Procras_LoL> @RL_Stine isn't this how we get Orcs?
829114046741889026 2017-02-07 23:46:07 UTC <Procras_LoL> @jk_rowling It won't happen. With all the people you've killed (Dobby, Snape, Dumbledore) I'm sure you've got horcruxes tucked away.
828825184798916608 2017-02-06 04:38:17 UTC <Procras_LoL> @TrumpDraws @jk_rowling Not sure why, but this killed me.
828497214439833601 2017-02-05 06:55:03 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ImCaptainTeemo Around here, we just call that Death.
824408027075936256 2017-01-25 00:06:05 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ADsolo3 looks like we get snow tomorrow. Better than all this damn rain.
824407225389223936 2017-01-25 00:02:53 UTC <Procras_LoL> @FrostyFaustings @ADsolo3 think you might need to charge that battery a little.
816219382829486080 2017-01-03 09:47:20 UTC <Procras_LoL> @FionnOnFire That last line did it for me. 10/10
815236637546446848 2016-12-31 16:42:15 UTC <Procras_LoL> Happy Birthday to the brilliant and talented @AnthonyHopkins
797936084374134784 2016-11-13 22:56:02 UTC <Procras_LoL> @espn @FionnOnFire ABCDeft is perfect.
796767992604491777 2016-11-10 17:34:27 UTC <Procras_LoL> @asabfb some of us didn't vote for this. Some of us had some sensibility and tried to vote to prevent this. Just as angry as you about this.
787778263175147522 2016-10-16 22:12:28 UTC <Procras_LoL> @Midsummer1942 doesn't happen to me lol. Blood dk. They hit me, I just get it right back.
783871625116528640 2016-10-05 03:28:53 UTC <Procras_LoL> @Midsummer1942 thanks, just working on gearing and raiding lol
783804327223631873 2016-10-05 23:01:28 UTC <Procras_LoL> @Midsummer1942 Just hit exalted with them last night.
780586549591232512 2016-09-26 01:55:10 UTC <Procras_LoL> So much alcohol is being consumed tonight with this card. #debatenight
779599374363963392 2016-09-24 08:32:29 UTC <Procras_LoL> @jk_rowling But seriously, a buzzard? Not really sure what to think about that.
767065088532492288 2016-08-20 18:25:43 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ImCaptainTeemo if I could ever find one...
760548455538429952 2016-08-02 18:50:56 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ADsolo3 so close to my gyrados
760548424471240704 2016-08-02 18:50:49 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ADsolo3 lol definitely. I just enjoy the walks. If I really wanna catch something, I'll pop a lure at the dam and get Magikarp.
760544071102373888 2016-08-02 18:33:31 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ADsolo3 totally kidding, I'm not having issues, but I know quite a few people who are. But they can't find their ass without a guide or map
760543735872708608 2016-08-02 18:32:11 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ADsolo3 you mean, it's not?
760276867022671873 2016-08-01 00:51:45 UTC <Procras_LoL> @YangCLiu @PokeVisionGo @NianticLabs @KrugDrew @Sam_214 @ingress  "little" Pokemon Go website
759223562821591040 2016-07-29 03:06:17 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ADsolo3 Roughly 3-4 more weeks. But I may try to get through some of it on crutches.
759218307190915073 2016-07-29 02:45:24 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ADsolo3 thanks, I'm just hoping to be able to play again soon. Need to hatch some eggs.
759154911326064642 2016-07-29 22:33:29 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ADsolo3 I'm jealous. I haven't been able to for almost a week. Broke my foot at work.
755512367140728832 2016-07-19 21:19:19 UTC <Procras_LoL> @HybridLoL You disappoint me.
755480411631792128 2016-07-19 19:12:20 UTC <Procras_LoL> @HybridLoL Instinct
755166748463108098 2016-07-18 22:25:57 UTC <Procras_LoL> @survivetheark Oh look, it's a giant nope.
754968603582095360 2016-07-18 09:18:36 UTC <Procras_LoL> @LoLZirene That list makes me cry. Here I am trying to walk with a broken foot to keep up and you show a god tier list. Well done sir.
751668399378296832 2016-07-08 06:44:46 UTC <Procras_LoL> @RivingtonThe3rd Got this beauty in the middle of a thunderstorm.pic.twitter.com/RAnK8iLvhL
751657886867009536 2016-07-08 06:03:00 UTC <Procras_LoL> @RivingtonThe3rd my first 10km egg was Onyx.
750910125183868929 2016-07-06 04:31:39 UTC <Procras_LoL> @FionnOnFire I watched my brother stop in the middle of the street to catch a caterpie. Almost got hit by a truck.
747478888578752512 2016-06-27 17:17:09 UTC <Procras_LoL> @OGCyanide I actually wanted to stand up and applaud at the end of the episode. Then realized I was alone at home...
747289096158994432 2016-06-26 04:42:59 UTC <Procras_LoL> @Jetsby Thank you for posting this.
747282264946409472 2016-06-26 04:15:50 UTC <Procras_LoL> @TheRedWoman He is Varys, he can teleport and knows what is going on everywhere.
747203573235101697 2016-06-26 23:03:08 UTC <Procras_LoL> @WatchItDry I've decided that after it's over I'll just throw out my tv until next season. Then I can shop for a tv and enjoy next season.
744664473399504897 2016-06-19 22:53:40 UTC <Procras_LoL> Anxiously awaiting the #BastardBowl tonight. Just a little over 2 hours. #GameOfThrones
738952217827254272 2016-06-03 04:35:12 UTC <Procras_LoL> Alright 2016, you can stop now. Taking away greats and legends. RIP Muhammad Ali.
735862446812864517 2016-05-26 15:57:33 UTC <Procras_LoL> @OGCyanide Steben. As in it must steben tough to spell Lauri.
730167074379587584 2016-05-10 22:46:11 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ImCaptainTeemo 
726084158175350784 2016-04-29 16:22:07 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ADsolo3 @adsolo3 I need these in my life.
724766271552655360 2016-04-25 01:05:19 UTC <Procras_LoL> @reumanpe01 By the end of Game of Thrones, you won't trust anything anymore.
724331168305303553 2016-04-24 20:16:22 UTC <Procras_LoL> Writing a term paper while dealing with a 70 pound hyperactive husky makes it twice the work. Can I just skip the term paper please?
721204905130594304 2016-04-15 05:13:43 UTC <Procras_LoL> @lol_Cris go for broke man
717941640707506177 2016-04-06 05:06:40 UTC <Procras_LoL> @MikeLoftus_ Manhattan
709121159871201280 2016-03-13 20:57:14 UTC <Procras_LoL> @WotAustin Learn the words to the Canadian National Anthem?
704749405010862081 2016-03-01 19:25:26 UTC <Procras_LoL> @tobymuresianu thankfully you clapped. I was afraid I'd have to ask.
704747627871649793 2016-03-01 19:18:22 UTC <Procras_LoL> @tobymuresianu I still say Exorcisms. I hate leeches. They suck.
696461655291641856 2016-02-07 22:32:52 UTC <Procras_LoL> @Midsummer1942 It's actually fairly annoying to pop into a stream and see that constantly. I wanna see a game, not a wardrobe adjustment.
692452847988903938 2016-01-27 21:03:18 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ADsolo3 @adsolo3 This would be Darwinism at it's finest.
692119100693331969 2016-01-26 22:57:07 UTC <Procras_LoL> @ADsolo3 @adsolo3 I hear ya, I was ready for the weekend Monday morning.
