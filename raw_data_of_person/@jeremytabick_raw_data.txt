963517206121385984 2018-02-13 20:56:17 UTC <jeremytabick> @Daniel_Sugarman You're absolutely right, but the common talking point "Jesus was a Jew" is misleading, though not completely false like saying he was an Arab. The idea of a religion of Judaism exists only in contrast with Christianity, doesn't emerge in a big way for centuries.
963491968415404033 2018-02-13 19:16:00 UTC <jeremytabick> @Daniel_Sugarman That's because the words in Greek, Latin and Hebrew for "Judean" (ethnic group of people living in Judaea) and "Jew" (follower of the God of Israel) are all identical (Iudaios, ). Shaye Cohen has a chapter on this in "Beginnings of Jewishness" (2/2)
963491358601367558 2018-02-13 19:13:35 UTC <jeremytabick> @Daniel_Sugarman Jewish grad-student of Judaism in late antiquity here. This is much more complex than you are making it out to be. (a) There were no Arabs at this time, that is not what they were called, the closest are the Nabataeans. (b) Scholars disagree if there were Jews as such also.
963115595591028747 2018-02-12 18:20:26 UTC <jeremytabick> This is the best take I've seen on this.

958894412632862720 2018-01-31 02:46:58 UTC <jeremytabick> @MyNameIsNotBard Yeast isn't hametz at all, it just happens to be part of the process initiated by the flour and water when it turns into hametz (which we now add additional yeast to, starting with the Roman period, not in ancient Israel)

958065655038791680 2018-01-29 19:53:46 UTC <jeremytabick> @JParnell1 7) Looks like it's a standard ETB deck with Roon at the helm, but it's actually a "populate insane tokens" deck! https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/roon-populate-1/.   Full disclosure, I play budget decks (you can see in the mana bases) and generally avoid tutoring, so please update whatever you want
958064931341000705 2018-01-29 19:50:54 UTC <jeremytabick> @JParnell1 6) Specifically for @RedNeckWins, here is a Karador deck that takes advantage of the fact that he "casts" creatures (and is a spirit) by combining it with Kamigawa spiritshttps://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/29-01-18-karador-spirits/

958064068643999745 2018-01-29 19:47:28 UTC <jeremytabick> @JParnell1 2) Given Atraxa can be quite oppressive, I built a deck which has probably the worst thing you can do with her: Energy! (Though it does have a few other tricks e.g. experience counters and superfriends subtheme)https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/29-01-18-atraxa-energy/
958063783188058113 2018-01-29 19:46:20 UTC <jeremytabick> @JParnell1 Awesome, here are some decks: https://tappedout.net/users/jeremytabick/mtg-decks/. 1) Four-Colour Morph, the goal of which is to make all your opponents ask, "Are you attacking me to draw a card or because you have a scary morph?!"https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/four-colour-morph/

920703163648397312 2017-10-18 17:28:34 UTC <jeremytabick> @wizards_magic @maro254 I just hope I also got across my worldview effectively, that holiday season for me and many other Jews is itself a form of erasure
920702999047102465 2017-10-18 17:27:55 UTC <jeremytabick> @wizards_magic @maro254 Just wanted to say thank you for engaging and again apologise for erasing your worldview, I didn't understand but now I do
920670635805888512 2017-10-18 15:19:19 UTC <jeremytabick> @wizards_magic @maro254 Also if you want to include more Jews, why not actually make a Hanukkah card?
920670324877819906 2017-10-18 15:18:05 UTC <jeremytabick> @wizards_magic @maro254 No offense taken, there are also many Jews who do not identify and I'd be curious to hear what celebrators of Diwali or others would think
920669114154323968 2017-10-18 15:13:16 UTC <jeremytabick> @wizards_magic @maro254 That was not my intention and I apologise unreservedly, this might also be a UK-US divide, many UK Jews do not identify with holiday season
920666723954683905 2017-10-18 15:03:46 UTC <jeremytabick> @wizards_magic @maro254 I just think it's dishonest to claim that it isn't fundamentally a Christian worldview
920666624683839489 2017-10-18 15:03:23 UTC <jeremytabick> @wizards_magic @maro254 Again this is totally fine, I want people who are excited about the holiday season to have their cards, regardless of their religion
920666239126704129 2017-10-18 15:01:51 UTC <jeremytabick> @wizards_magic @maro254 So did we, doesn't change the fact that the idea of a holiday season represents the world from a Christian perspective, not a universal one
920665504418803712 2017-10-18 14:58:56 UTC <jeremytabick> @wizards_magic @maro254 Yule literally means Christmas... Again all I'm saying is you represented them as universal when they aren't, it's fine that they're not
920665190089351168 2017-10-18 14:57:41 UTC <jeremytabick> @wizards_magic @maro254 I'm also not saying I have an issue with the holiday cards, I don't, I want people to have these cards and be happy
920664890855051268 2017-10-18 14:56:29 UTC <jeremytabick> @wizards_magic @maro254 How does Yule tide ooze represent anything for any other region? How do any of these cards represent Diwali?

920664181120126976 2017-10-18 14:53:40 UTC <jeremytabick> @wizards_magic @maro254 I understand, but only Jews in Christian countries feel that way, only those Jews give presents on Hanukkah
920662625574375424 2017-10-18 14:47:29 UTC <jeremytabick> @wizards_magic @maro254 It's fine to be doing Christian cultural cards, just don't make it out like they're general when they're not, that's Christian hegemony

920623427031109632 2017-10-18 12:11:44 UTC <jeremytabick> @wizards_magic @maro254 ... please don't pretend they're for other holidays, they're not, it's no worse than using "Judeo-Christian" when you mean "Christian"
