966430727553216512 2018-02-21 21:53:35 UTC <MsYorksClass> Lots of new books to bring back from #atPLC! (Thanks, @WilsonGUSD!). @ToddWhitakers The Ball is a great reflection for the end of today! #caedchatpic.twitter.com/zMxWFLCdaK
966365880778027008 2018-02-21 17:35:54 UTC <MsYorksClass> Culture comes from the bottom up ... You cant do it without first becoming it. People have to change too, not just the system! @Regina_Owens #atPLCpic.twitter.com/SHgTLlWBVd

964649509845266438 2018-02-16 23:55:40 UTC <MsYorksClass> This thread is absolutely true and, by that fact, absolutely infuriating. #caedchat #edchat #parklandhttps://twitter.com/theweirdteacher/status/964525466831867904
963579498426900480 2018-02-13 01:03:49 UTC <MsYorksClass> Whoo hoo! Go, @shirleyhalldiaz!  http://edsource.org/2018/brown-appoints-15-to-new-k-12-computer-science-panel/593618
962914213738856448 2018-02-11 05:00:13 UTC <MsYorksClass> Hey, teachers!  It's almost time to #CelebrateMonday! Get your rest, drink your water, and take a moment for you. I hope you have a beautiful week! #KidsDeserveIt #JoyfulLeaders #TrendThePositive #caedchat #edchatpic.twitter.com/IANpI3LjYL
960293758435643392 2018-02-04 23:27:28 UTC <MsYorksClass> If we are going to crush apathy in our schools and create learning that's irresistible, it won't happen by doubling down our efforts to reach proficiency. We have to start by developing environments where students can rekindle what it means to be a passionate learner. #caedchathttps://twitter.com/davidgeurin/status/960279822353227776
959880280298278912 2018-02-03 20:04:27 UTC <MsYorksClass> Test scores and dollars can be counted, but they are NOT what makes a great school great! Stop paring down student experiences. Start expanding! #kidsdeserveit #caedchat #cuepic.twitter.com/azSr7jojkX
959856074223316994 2018-02-03 18:28:16 UTC <MsYorksClass> Thank you so much for the honor of being a Region 2 nominee at last weeks dinner! 9 counties, 10 nominees  what a spread! #CALeagueOfSchools #LeagueOfSchoolshttps://twitter.com/leagueofschools/status/957099462895157248

952767599040868353 2018-01-14 05:01:11 UTC <MsYorksClass> @CHansenCA You're very welcome! I hope you found it beneficial! #caedchat

952766003473256448 2018-01-14 04:54:51 UTC <MsYorksClass> @CHansenCA But how did you get there? Or are you hoping? :) #caedchat
952765764246716416 2018-01-14 04:53:54 UTC <MsYorksClass> @judykaylane @christyn_a Good for you! Definitely the best response to give.
952764796830494720 2018-01-14 04:50:03 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q8: How can you best start a conversation with colleagues about the purpose and value of homework in your school or classroom? #caedchatpic.twitter.com/gsApMDeNlf
952763971840311296 2018-01-14 04:46:47 UTC <MsYorksClass> A7: I regularly send home math newsletters for parents that correspond to our EngageNY curriculum. Examples and explanations aplenty. So many thanks to @dhabecker and his YouTube/Embarc Online resources! #caedchat
952763017636147200 2018-01-14 04:42:59 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q7: Parents often struggle to understand the concepts we teach or how we teach them. What do you do to ensure that parents are able to help their children with homework when needed? #caedchatpic.twitter.com/dsiO63I3QF
952761865091694597 2018-01-14 04:38:24 UTC <MsYorksClass> @tsschmidty @AppEducationFox Love that! :)
952761417412747265 2018-01-14 04:36:38 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q6: Is it possible to embrace personalized learning when it comes to homework? Do you differentiate levels or offer student choice? #caedchatpic.twitter.com/Q5Ym6WWCjg
952760474805837824 2018-01-14 04:32:53 UTC <MsYorksClass> @MrZiebarth Love that idea! :)
952760138179358725 2018-01-14 04:31:33 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q5: How do we ensure that homework is purposeful and extends learning rather than causing misconceptions or frustration at home? #caedchatpic.twitter.com/t6Vfiar4bQ
952759885933854720 2018-01-14 04:30:32 UTC <MsYorksClass> No problem! I'm adding to it each week! (4th Grade) #caedchathttps://twitter.com/DebbieHurtado/status/952759054195073025
952758768059662336 2018-01-14 04:26:06 UTC <MsYorksClass> That's similar to how I've been handling homework this year. Optional weekly homework slides (http://bit.ly/all-hw), optional monthly character menu, and nightly reading. #caedchathttps://twitter.com/Jstevens009/status/952757458409218048
952758168290914304 2018-01-14 04:23:43 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q4: When homework is given, should it be graded for more than participation? How do you handle discrepancies in the level of support among student homes? #caedchatpic.twitter.com/v6Ym9aKQAW
952756823819350016 2018-01-14 04:18:22 UTC <MsYorksClass> @judykaylane Oh, yes. :)
952756475650125824 2018-01-14 04:16:59 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q3: In your classroom (please note subject/grade), do you assign homework? If so, what do you find to be the biggest benefit for your students? If you do not, why? #caedchatpic.twitter.com/uFR5Ui5FmL
952755952121405440 2018-01-14 04:14:54 UTC <MsYorksClass> That is the worst, IMO. Crosswords, word finds, ... what is the academic value? #caedchathttps://twitter.com/MrZiebarth/status/952755458506289157
952755697007050752 2018-01-14 04:13:54 UTC <MsYorksClass> Absolutely! #caedchathttps://twitter.com/MsAlyssa96/status/952755278415511552
952755514370269184 2018-01-14 04:13:10 UTC <MsYorksClass> I don't remember anything being shared either! #caedchathttps://twitter.com/JudyArzt/status/952755085653823489
952755134320099328 2018-01-14 04:11:40 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q2: When you were preparing to become a teacher, what advice were you given about assigning homework to your students? #caedchatpic.twitter.com/DBHZc3kRlm
952753947105681409 2018-01-14 04:06:56 UTC <MsYorksClass> Hello, Darren! Glad you could join us! #caedchathttps://twitter.com/DarrenHause/status/952753813600985089
952753625725526017 2018-01-14 04:05:40 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q1: Lets start with a look back. How would you describe your own experiences with grade-school homework? Or perhaps the experiences of your children? #caedchatpic.twitter.com/3jvaO5Ntgt
952753417608298497 2018-01-14 04:04:50 UTC <MsYorksClass> @CAedchat @DivinaM451 Hello, Divina! Thanks for being a part of #caedchat!

950230571686350848 2018-01-07 04:59:57 UTC <MsYorksClass> Thanks for joining us tonight, #caedchat participants! Come on back next week and bring a friend! I'll see you there! 
950228583141658624 2018-01-07 04:52:03 UTC <MsYorksClass> @mrwisley I'm making a list right now! :) #caedchat
950228203779514368 2018-01-07 04:50:32 UTC <MsYorksClass> I definitely agree! #caedchathttps://twitter.com/CHansenCA/status/950228104961601537
950227405540532224 2018-01-07 04:47:22 UTC <MsYorksClass> Be ready for question seven! ;) #caedchat https://twitter.com/HowardKiyuna/status/950226796120760320
950227141991350272 2018-01-07 04:46:19 UTC <MsYorksClass> @tsschmidty Definitely! This should be common practice at the college level! :)
950227001981394946 2018-01-07 04:45:46 UTC <MsYorksClass> A6: Share ways that make the chat experience smooth. You don't need to read *every* tweet in the chat! Also, using a site like Tweetdeck really helps to organize thoughts. #caedchat
950226608782065664 2018-01-07 04:44:12 UTC <MsYorksClass> A5: I think if #caedchat's regular chatters took a moment to share a week's topic or reached out to  individuals personally, that would have a *huge* impact! Spread the word! <3
950225247675928577 2018-01-07 04:38:48 UTC <MsYorksClass> A4: I've never had a problem balancing humor and fun with strong expectations. But because of a variety of circumstances this year, I've found it much harder to do. I need to add more FUN to my day! #caedchat
950222140493582336 2018-01-07 04:26:27 UTC <MsYorksClass> A3: I have a lot going on personally this year and I think that #Happiness needs to be the theme. If what I'm doing (in my classroom or not) doesn't make me feel content, it's out!   #caedchat
950221441596776448 2018-01-07 04:23:40 UTC <MsYorksClass> @SLOlifeKevin I  agree. It's debilitating and I'm tired of the "never enough" thoughts. I was just nominated for two awards during this last month. I must be doing something right! I need to give myself a break! #caedchat
950220307771539456 2018-01-07 04:19:10 UTC <MsYorksClass> Okay, nevermind. THAT's what needs to be eliminated this year! #caedchathttps://twitter.com/SLOlifeKevin/status/950219841033547776
950219715858784256 2018-01-07 04:16:49 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: Last year, I removed homework (aside from nightly reading) and Accelerated Reader. Not sure what I'm getting rid of next, but these are staying away! #caedchat
950219322667888640 2018-01-07 04:15:15 UTC <MsYorksClass> @HowardKiyuna Love it!

937544019160076293 2017-12-03 04:48:07 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q7: Do you plan to go #BeyondTheHourOfCode? Beyond #CSEdWeek? If so, what do you have planned for the rest of the school year? #caedchatpic.twitter.com/edKiFRTTG1
937543862117048320 2017-12-03 04:47:30 UTC <MsYorksClass> Open House is a lot like this in my classroom. Create a green screen photo, take Dash through the maze, etc. It's a game-board style where they can earn a prize if they finish all the activities. #caedchathttps://twitter.com/MsbatistaL/status/937543318157721600

937542416373911557 2017-12-03 04:41:45 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q6: Have you ever tried to involve parents in your #CSEdWeek or #HourOfCode plans? If so, what did you do? How did they respond? #caedchatpic.twitter.com/dcNUvb8muF

What advice would you give a colleague who is hesitant to begin teaching computer science? #caedchatpic.twitter.com/85nwppqmxx
937539089544331264 2017-12-03 04:28:32 UTC <MsYorksClass> A4, cont: Be sure to register your event if you haven't already! :) #caedchathttps://twitter.com/CSEdWeek/status/923640389239746571
937538848560594944 2017-12-03 04:27:34 UTC <MsYorksClass> @codeorg A4: My students have participated in Hour of Code for a few years. We try to work our way through the @Codeorg Course 2 Curriculum before years end. My Ss always enjoy it, and #HourOfCode can be a great partner or solo activity to start a students coding journey! #caedchatpic.twitter.com/2o4cufWKvw
937538031199727616 2017-12-03 04:24:19 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q4: Have you ever participated in the #HourOfCode? If so, what did you think? If not, do you plan to join in this year? http://hourofcode.com/us/how-to #caedchatpic.twitter.com/KI0tVchiI2
937537058448457729 2017-12-03 04:20:27 UTC <MsYorksClass> A3: I havent done enough, thats for sure. A few biographies on Steve Jobs and Bill Gates doesnt cut it for CS history! Does anyone have a great resource, topic, or names to drop? http://i.imgur.com/jIEOZDL.jpg #caedchatpic.twitter.com/blyfWZo77g
937536011743064064 2017-12-03 04:16:18 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q3: #CSEdWeek is celebrated each year during the week of Grace Hoppers birthday. Do you spend time discussing the history of computer science with your Ss? If so, what do you discuss? What resources do you like to use? http://csedweek.org/about #caedchatpic.twitter.com/UmcOkLJj1a
937535722797461504 2017-12-03 04:15:09 UTC <MsYorksClass> Glad you could join us, Mary! #caedchat
937534897140375552 2017-12-03 04:11:52 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: Absolutely! It fosters problem solving, critical thinking, experimentation, curiosity, adaptation, and so many other necessary skills! And, its fun! My fourth graders spend most of their CS time on coding and practicing digital citizenship. http://rasmussen.edu/degrees/technology/blog/coding-for-kids #caedchat
937534441278251008 2017-12-03 04:10:04 UTC <MsYorksClass> @_K8Fisher Glad you could make it, Kate! #caedchat
937534371879313409 2017-12-03 04:09:47 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q2: Do you think computer science is an essential part of a students education? If so, why? What are the benefits? What do you focus on most? #caedchatpic.twitter.com/gp7fwxtoTJ
937533807003025409 2017-12-03 04:07:32 UTC <MsYorksClass> @shhsMath That's so disappointing. Not uncommon, but terribly disappointing. #caedchat
937533623606980608 2017-12-03 04:06:49 UTC <MsYorksClass> A1: We were fortunate enough to secure 1:1 Chromebooks for our student body and begin to work our way toward a #futureready environment around 2014. The last couple of years seem to be pretty stagnant though. #caedchat

915057285382074369 2017-10-02 03:33:52 UTC <MsYorksClass> A4: Because #digcit starts early! Yes, digital natives can USE the tool, but can they LEARN from it effectively? #tosachat
915055579059576832 2017-10-02 03:27:05 UTC <MsYorksClass> A3: Lots of communication. What are the specific needs of the T? Who in my PLN already has that experience? Ongoing relationships! #tosachat
915053281457487873 2017-10-02 03:17:57 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: In our dist, it's been 1) "The kids can't do it." or 2) "I haven't been trained." I don't think either are valid. Start small! #tosachat
915051268061618176 2017-10-02 03:09:57 UTC <MsYorksClass> A1: Most of my experience resides in upper elem, but I imagine repetition and consistency are super important for the littles! #tosachat

914695842665185280 2017-10-01 03:37:37 UTC <MsYorksClass> I have just begun to see this value in the gaming system: it does not reprimand, but simply restarts. Try, try again! #caedchathttps://twitter.com/ZSharon/status/914695407355158528
914695490817499136 2017-10-01 03:36:13 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q6: Having a phrase to repeat can help refocus minds in times of doubt. Share a quote you use to help yourself think differently. #caedchatpic.twitter.com/Wgq3HiiIw4
914694141740703744 2017-10-01 03:30:52 UTC <MsYorksClass> Great minds (follow a separate path and arrive at their own, sometimes similar, conclusions)! LOL #caedchathttps://twitter.com/tr_bo/status/914693778396418048

914691287613292545 2017-10-01 03:19:31 UTC <MsYorksClass> A3: I have chosen to give more critical feedback and opportunities for Ss to revise work. More formative, less summative. #caedchat

914687873919500288 2017-10-01 03:05:57 UTC <MsYorksClass> A1: Yes! Reframing the idea of failure can be such a catalyst. Recognizing it as an opportunity to grow changes everything! #caedchatpic.twitter.com/eKNP279Mwc

874116888082632704 2017-06-11 04:11:21 UTC <MsYorksClass> Yay! I'm so happy to hear that! I absolutely loved it in my classroom this year and won't be going back to traditional desks! #caedchathttps://twitter.com/elena_sf_ca/status/874116607357759488

874112941674479617 2017-06-11 03:55:40 UTC <MsYorksClass> A8: Our desks were super old, so when it came time to replace, I asked for three large round tables and two rectangular ones. #caedchatpic.twitter.com/nqngOUt5Tp
874112732596850689 2017-06-11 03:54:50 UTC <MsYorksClass> A8: DonorsChoose is a great place to start. Thrift stores and yard sales can prove fruitful too! #caedchat
874112453071601664 2017-06-11 03:53:43 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q8: How have you funded your new #FlexibleSeating choices?  #caedchat

874111824102277120 2017-06-11 03:51:13 UTC <MsYorksClass> Yes! I initially had a two-person standing table. Ss didn't like it. We lowered it and chose reg chairs w/stability cushions. #caedchathttps://twitter.com/SLOlifeKevin/status/874111521130815488
874111451643822080 2017-06-11 03:49:44 UTC <MsYorksClass> A7: Focus on Ss. Clear expectations. Remember they're learning by doing. Self-reg is important & they're figuring out what's best. #caedchat
874110704508219392 2017-06-11 03:46:46 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q7: Do you have any tips for those beginning to implement #FlexibleSeating? Any questions to help yourself get started? #caedchat
874110565068578817 2017-06-11 03:46:13 UTC <MsYorksClass> Great Q&A re: #flexibleseating. http://luckylittlelearners.com/2016/01/flexible-seating.html #caedchat

874110005389123584 2017-06-11 03:44:00 UTC <MsYorksClass> The only seats I may stray from in the future are yoga balls. Only seats I had to ask Ss to avoid due to their toy-like design. #caedchat
874109445273403392 2017-06-11 03:41:46 UTC <MsYorksClass> I was grateful to purchase tables and get rid of desks this year, which really freed up a lot of space! More seats than Ss now! #caedchat

874108629556748288 2017-06-11 03:38:32 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q6: Do you have any pictures of #FlexibleSeating in your classroom? A Google image of what youd like to try? Share out! #caedchat
874108457934245888 2017-06-11 03:37:51 UTC <MsYorksClass> I honestly haven't. I give very clear expectations to students about behavior and often remind. They know what's appropriate. #caedchathttps://twitter.com/teachermike72/status/874107976604188673
874108061467557888 2017-06-11 03:36:16 UTC <MsYorksClass> It worked very well! Kept supplies in a file by the door, & had group basics (pencils, computer mice...) in a caddy at each table. #caedchathttps://twitter.com/christyn_a/status/874107344719757313
874107246933794816 2017-06-11 03:33:02 UTC <MsYorksClass> @SLOlifeKevin Love it!
874107123860254720 2017-06-11 03:32:33 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q5: How do you handle classroom management when paired with student choice? How often do students choose a new seat? #caedchat
874107099889811456 2017-06-11 03:32:27 UTC <MsYorksClass> We also move repeatedly during the day. Each recess/lunch, students clean up and leave, then choose a new seat upon return. #caedchathttps://twitter.com/teachermike72/status/874105941020467200
874106185015730177 2017-06-11 03:28:49 UTC <MsYorksClass> I haven't encountered this. Although we have a few more seats than kids, every table must have multiple Ss in order to accomodate. #caedchathttps://twitter.com/teachermike72/status/874105941020467200
874105948557656065 2017-06-11 03:27:52 UTC <MsYorksClass> A4: We have tall tables w/stools, short tables w/cushions, Hokki stools, stability cushions w/regular seats, lap desks... #caedchat
874105620990894080 2017-06-11 03:26:34 UTC <MsYorksClass> Q4: What type of #FlexibleSeating arrangements have worked for you? Or, what would you like to try in your classroom? #caedchat
874105251657203712 2017-06-11 03:25:06 UTC <MsYorksClass> Here's another fun poster to remind students. Remember, it's ultimately up to you to pay attn to your Ss and move them if needed. #caedchatpic.twitter.com/F27I7DOq7v
874104973776142336 2017-06-11 03:24:00 UTC <MsYorksClass> Yes, it was definitely discussed at Back to School Night, and parents saw the room for themselves. #caedchathttps://twitter.com/TrPatel20/status/874104334253871105
874104765965193216 2017-06-11 03:23:10 UTC <MsYorksClass> It's a freebie, too! Find it here, along with accompanying goodies: http://teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Flexible-Seating-Freebie-2603824 #caedchathttps://twitter.com/elena_SF_CA/status/874104227307503616
874104284660375553 2017-06-11 03:21:16 UTC <MsYorksClass> A3: My 4th grade parents saw the diff it made for their child. I sent this home at the start of the year: http://goo.gl/pbiLrp #caedchat
874103796506312704 2017-06-11 03:19:19 UTC <MsYorksClass> How do you communicate #FlexibleSeating to parents? Have you had any pushback? #caedchat
874103422567325697 2017-06-11 03:17:50 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: Tiny group who lacked self-control. Placed "Saved Seat" tag at each table. They could still choose, but couldn't sit together. #caedchat
874102956886339584 2017-06-11 03:15:59 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: I was initially worried about excessive chatter, but did not encounter that this year. We followed these simple rules: #caedchatpic.twitter.com/fYnrLhTfMM

836076580661141504 2017-02-26 04:52:45 UTC <MsYorksClass> Need to step away early, #caedchat. Thank you for your insistence on the importance of this topic!
836074610344931329 2017-02-26 04:44:55 UTC <MsYorksClass> A6: Make yourself aware of issues LGBTQ Ss face. Do the research. Use inclusive language. Be sure Ss know you're there for them. #caedchat
836073059148689411 2017-02-26 04:38:45 UTC <MsYorksClass> A5: At our elem site, I don't think it really changes any current protocol. Definitely agree w/Jo-Ann though. #caedchathttps://twitter.com/AppEducationFox/status/836072178076409856
836072496323416064 2017-02-26 04:36:31 UTC <MsYorksClass> A4: Immediate reaction, w/ compassion and a reminder of class norms. Then, one-to-one discussion/follow-up re: lang ramifications. #caedchat
836070506851790848 2017-02-26 04:28:36 UTC <MsYorksClass> A3: I don't hear much re: explicit terms. Generic, childish ways of exclusion instead. Ss know I would never accept any slur. #caedchat
836068121085542402 2017-02-26 04:19:08 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: Again, elem level. Nothing is being done specific to the issue, but I imagine the repercussions for bullying would be similar. #caedchat
836066467011428353 2017-02-26 04:12:33 UTC <MsYorksClass> A1: Being at the elementary level, the topic does not arise as often. The focus has been more about dispelling gender stereotypes. #caedchat

828457253397073920 2017-02-05 04:16:15 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: First stop is @cueinc. Such a great network of educators, always willing to share and collaborate! #NorthStateCUE #NSCUE #caedchat
828455779397103617 2017-02-05 04:10:24 UTC <MsYorksClass> A1: Campus-focus: coaching and school safety. Classroom focus: video editing, STEM, and the re-kindling of my love for #EnviroEd. #caedchat
828454378147192833 2017-02-05 04:04:50 UTC <MsYorksClass> @AppEducationFox Good evening, Jo-Ann! Just walked through the front door right on time! :)
828454242293735424 2017-02-05 04:04:17 UTC <MsYorksClass> Hello, #caedchat! Laurie, 4th Grade, from Gridley! Looking forward to tonight's chat about professional development!
827958425095057408 2017-02-04 19:14:05 UTC <MsYorksClass> @bribriggs @creativeedtech I couldn't bear overlapping (yet)! They're starting to end up on the inside, lol! #OCD #cuechat #caedchatpic.twitter.com/IuOcFsH1OG

826995334731624448 2017-02-01 03:27:07 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: Science/#EnviroEd topics. Marine life, food webs, volcanoes/earthquakes, ... #WeirdEdpic.twitter.com/RyLtAQwXxX
826992082560512001 2017-02-01 03:14:11 UTC <MsYorksClass> @btcostello05 Just give me the phones to go in them! That's the expensive part! #WeirdEd
826991326231097344 2017-02-01 03:11:11 UTC <MsYorksClass> A1: iPads and skinny whiteboard pens. Unrelated. #WeirdEd
826989805292523520 2017-02-01 03:05:08 UTC <MsYorksClass> Hello, #WeirdEd! I'm going with Kenai and Koda from Brother Bear.   Love that movie!
826988769156886528 2017-02-01 03:01:01 UTC <MsYorksClass> Well, that was fast! Thanks for a great chat! Haven't gotten to pop in to #EnviroEd for a while! @RangerRidley @PaulKelba
826987317667647489 2017-02-01 02:55:15 UTC <MsYorksClass> .@vivianharris45 @RangerRidley For my 13th b-day, I decided to pick up trash and plant trees. Friends thought I was nuts, but hey! #EnviroEd
826986906722279424 2017-02-01 02:53:37 UTC <MsYorksClass> @litterati A5: Great question. Not sure I have answer, but I know I like places like @Litterati to spur conversation. #EnviroEd
826986464177057793 2017-02-01 02:51:52 UTC <MsYorksClass> @tellagami @RangerRidley Nice! @Tellagami is a great way for students to share online when parents are afraid of posting photos/videos. #EnviroEd
826986138485219328 2017-02-01 02:50:34 UTC <MsYorksClass> @padlet A4: Also, cross-classroom and student collaboration can certainly be enhanced via GHO/Skype, @Padlet, etc. #EnviroEd
826984839261806592 2017-02-01 02:45:24 UTC <MsYorksClass> A4: At #CUE16, I attended a session lead by someone from @MontereyAq & learned of http://zydeco.soe.umich.edu. Awesome collab sci app. #EnviroEd
826983308927971328 2017-02-01 02:39:20 UTC <MsYorksClass> @mattkdavidsman Today's #GSPD2017 was a great way to encourage unstructured play. I need closer outdoor spaces to explore w/Ss! #EnviroEd
826981633387421697 2017-02-01 02:32:40 UTC <MsYorksClass> A3 (pt. 3): It spurred years of inquiry into population density, marine environments, and a love for writing. #EnviroEd
826981568660975616 2017-02-01 02:32:25 UTC <MsYorksClass> A3 (pt. 2): I know, for myself, my curiosity was peaked after seeing a dead harbor porpoise on the beach. #EnviroEd
826981467519545344 2017-02-01 02:32:01 UTC <MsYorksClass> A3 (pt. 1): I think exposure and hands-on learning are key. To be fair, that should be true for most subjects, but especially #EnviroEd.
826979275211366401 2017-02-01 02:23:18 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: I suppose the focus on creativity, collaboration, critical thinking, complex prob solving... these all can certainly connect. #EnviroEd
826978018774044673 2017-02-01 02:18:18 UTC <MsYorksClass> A1: I don't feel that we had much #EnviroEd experience then or now. I notice that the discussion now is on global issues though, not local.
826976716790718464 2017-02-01 02:13:08 UTC <MsYorksClass> Hello, #EnviroEd! A tad late here! Laurie, 4th Grade, CA. I loved our week-long camp in sixth grade. In HS, went back to be a counselor too!
826955929446789120 2017-02-01 00:50:32 UTC <MsYorksClass> Many thanks to Principal Adame for our initial training re: ALICE at Wilson Elementary. #GridleyEdpic.twitter.com/O983znelL4

824464186117730304 2017-01-25 03:49:14 UTC <MsYorksClass> A4: We don't have much unstructured play outside of recess time. I try to bring in plenty of gaming though: Kahoot, bump games... #WeirdEd
824460288305090560 2017-01-25 03:33:45 UTC <MsYorksClass> A3: Imagination, problem-solving, collaboration, conflict resolution, stress relief... so many benefits to unstructured play! #WeirdEd
824457636082905089 2017-01-25 03:23:12 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: Looking back, I think I was "in edu" from such an early age *because* of the structure. :/ The older I get, the less I want it. #WeirdEd
824456163487911936 2017-01-25 03:17:21 UTC <MsYorksClass> A1: Swinging, monkey bars, jump rope... At home, I had a classroom-size whiteboard. Played school + TMNT/Power Ranger w/brother. #WeirdEd
824374722632654848 2017-01-25 21:53:44 UTC <MsYorksClass> Hey, #edtechtcde! Don't forget, you can access a free month of @Seesaw Plus by scanning this QR code within the app! Woot! #northstatecuepic.twitter.com/jsxswaZSxK

823398299877052416 2017-01-22 05:13:47 UTC <MsYorksClass> @PrincipalManley Great start! I did notice that there are a few sentences repeated at the top of your post, however. FYI! :)
823395140597202944 2017-01-22 05:01:14 UTC <MsYorksClass> A8: I'm looking forward to trying out the Digital Passport program soon. http://commonsensemedia.org/educators/digital-passport @CommonSenseEd #caedchat
823394247353081856 2017-01-22 04:57:41 UTC <MsYorksClass> A7: It starts with a positive personal relationship. They need to know you're not preaching, but rather giving loving advice. #caedchat
823391649371824129 2017-01-22 04:47:21 UTC <MsYorksClass> Yes, yes, yes! #caedchathttps://twitter.com/PrincipalManley/status/823391091634229248
823391315211628545 2017-01-22 04:46:02 UTC <MsYorksClass> A6: It's not about the tech, really. It doesn't matter which app, site, device, etc. The real Qs are bigger.  #caedchatpic.twitter.com/DHIxGIUx58
823390282964025344 2017-01-22 04:41:55 UTC <MsYorksClass> A5: It's very easy to find examples of inappropriate behavior online. Use these as models. Discuss the potential repercussions. #caedchat
823387259537719296 2017-01-22 04:29:55 UTC <MsYorksClass> A4: What to remember? That your audience is VAST. Have you been impeccable with your word? #caedchat
823385285094313984 2017-01-22 04:22:04 UTC <MsYorksClass> A3: Absolutely. How can you expect the next generation to practice #digcit if we don't? #caedchat
823385045750583297 2017-01-22 04:21:07 UTC <MsYorksClass> Yes, I've said that many a time.  Personal stories are pretty impactful too. #caedchathttps://twitter.com/SEMSLibraryLady/status/823384666849710080
823384261885444098 2017-01-22 04:18:00 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: We'll read Confessions of a Former Bully & talk about upstanders (superhero bystanders), then practice #digcit in Seesaw. #caedchat
823382944311951360 2017-01-22 04:12:46 UTC <MsYorksClass> @SEMSLibraryLady Oooh, how I envy the teacher that can do that! #caedchathttps://twitter.com/SEMSLibraryLady/status/823382791899451392
823382642263343104 2017-01-22 04:11:34 UTC <MsYorksClass> @RaeFearing Thanks for sharing, Rae! #caedchathttps://twitter.com/RaeFearing/status/823382502551101440

823381946503831552 2017-01-22 04:08:48 UTC <MsYorksClass> A1: http://commonsensemedia.org/educators would definitely be my go-to #digcit starting place. @CommonSenseEd #caedchat

821072315177779200 2017-01-16 19:11:09 UTC <MsYorksClass> Hey, Tehama County! Hope to see you at the #CUERockStar Black Label next Saturday, January 21st! Let's talk #CSforAll! #NSCUE #EdTechTCDEpic.twitter.com/rsqFsNcXpN
821053864115769344 2017-01-16 17:57:50 UTC <MsYorksClass> Teachers, thank you for choosing a career that serves others daily. Your influence travels far! #MLKDAY #caedchat #connectedtl #cuerockstarpic.twitter.com/qDlxor8yIW
820858890266951680 2017-01-15 05:03:04 UTC <MsYorksClass> @andreabeaty @tsschmidty Love every one of those books! #caedchat
820857992388055040 2017-01-15 04:59:30 UTC <MsYorksClass> A7: Kiddos seem to have their "aha" moment after reading this quote. Makerspace projects and group STEM challenges help a lot too. #caedchatpic.twitter.com/xF7j3s0Lfe
820856159586267136 2017-01-15 04:52:13 UTC <MsYorksClass> A6: It's very age and experience dependent. Some Ss seem to understand this intrinsically, others need LOTS of modeling.  #caedchat
820854752539877376 2017-01-15 04:46:38 UTC <MsYorksClass> A5: Some Ts carry this motto, but not the whole school. Too many are focused on content, & not on bigger goals. The test IS life. #caedchat
820852419747688448 2017-01-15 04:37:22 UTC <MsYorksClass> @tsschmidty Just got a copy last week! #caedchat
820852213513756672 2017-01-15 04:36:33 UTC <MsYorksClass> A4: Can you collaborate, listen, share, exhibit optimism in the face of adversity? This is grit. It's the path to your best self. #caedchat
820849270752362496 2017-01-15 04:24:51 UTC <MsYorksClass> @arturo_calisto Yes, I do the same! You can't earn respect without exhibiting it yourself! #caedchat
820849050001866752 2017-01-15 04:23:58 UTC <MsYorksClass> A3: Forgiving Ss seems to be easier than forgiving adults. (Not that it should be though.) "There is no peace w/o forgiveness." #caedchatpic.twitter.com/kpZcAV8NpP
820846916539858944 2017-01-15 04:15:30 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: Dont think theres enough discussion around this. There is reprimand when Ss don't exhibit acceptance, but that's not enough. #caedchat
820844797967503360 2017-01-15 04:07:05 UTC <MsYorksClass> A1: In theory, sure. But in practice,  some adults need to reflect. We do use the bucket filler program w/Ss. Its a start. #caedchat
820844116963508224 2017-01-15 04:04:22 UTC <MsYorksClass> Hello, #caedchat! Laurie; 4th Grade; Gridley, CA. Tomorrow will be spent prepping a coding session for next week's Tehama Black Label event!
819706463442452480 2017-01-12 00:43:44 UTC <MsYorksClass> A5: Encourage parents to invite extended family. Connect w/other classrooms via blog. Energize Ss to leave feedback for others. #SeesawChat
819703943789834240 2017-01-12 00:33:44 UTC <MsYorksClass> @iteach5m Oh my gosh, I love that! #SeesawChat
819703716827656192 2017-01-12 00:32:50 UTC <MsYorksClass> A4: Fluency Reads are probably our most repetitive item. That, and green screen work. #SeesawChathttps://twitter.com/Room36Aloha/status/796497171319296001
819702379159252993 2017-01-12 00:27:31 UTC <MsYorksClass> @MrsGadtke We are set to experiment with them tomorrow! Had a lot of post-holiday business in other areas! :) #SeesawChat
819701092850147328 2017-01-12 00:22:24 UTC <MsYorksClass> A3, cont: I feel that if we had iPads regularly, we would have more student-chosen work. With Chromebooks, photos get trickier. #SeesawChat
819700590288588800 2017-01-12 00:20:24 UTC <MsYorksClass> A3: Our time spent really varies. I'd say the average is about 2x/week. Lately, too much has been Ts photos. Need Ss doing more! #SeesawChatpic.twitter.com/41nOQEfCP6
819699832528867328 2017-01-12 00:17:24 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2, cont: Be sure you take advantage of the resources at http://help.seesaw.me/hc/en-us. @Seesaw does a great job w/webinars, etc. #SeesawChat

798733373514522624 2016-11-15 03:44:10 UTC <MsYorksClass> A5: Having admin on board is crucial. Big shoutout to @pusdsupe for seeing its value when he was here! #ConnectedTLhttps://twitter.com/LindseyBlass1/status/798733055120711680
798732462431965184 2016-11-15 03:40:33 UTC <MsYorksClass> A4: School-#allrams; ~5Ts+P use it regularly. Dist-#GridleyEd. Sparse. I'd really like 2c what's going on at our other schools! #ConnectedTL
798730238431674368 2016-11-15 03:31:43 UTC <MsYorksClass> A3: Explain the intended outcome & show lots of examples of positive use. Be a consistent presence & speak of it offline often. #ConnectedTL
798728430078414848 2016-11-15 03:24:32 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: There's a general sense of apathy that's hard to break. So many weren't familiar w/basic tech; Twitter appears too foreign. #ConnectedTL
798727452998520834 2016-11-15 03:20:39 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: Would very much like it if admin/dist could highlight the power of Twitter for PLNs, and to encourage growth/sharing. #ConnectedTL
798726887186972672 2016-11-15 03:18:24 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: District goal is to connect to community & highlight positives. We have some school accts, but only one is consistent. :( #ConnectedTL
798724557964124161 2016-11-15 03:09:08 UTC <MsYorksClass> A1: Loosely encouraged, but most teachers and/or classrooms are not connected. #ConnectedTL

796549193003245568 2016-11-09 03:05:01 UTC <MsYorksClass> Hey, #WeirdEd. Laurie in NorCal.  Trying to look at potential positives and silver linings, but having a difficult time.

793972733314928640 2016-11-02 00:27:05 UTC <MsYorksClass> I feel like many of our answers may be referring to slightly differing content. Can everyone explain their definition of CS? Examples? #CSK8
793971215018827776 2016-11-02 00:21:03 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: At first, it was a matter of hardware and consistent wifi. Now, it's all about personalities. Which Ts are willing to take risks? #CSK8
793968648545107968 2016-11-02 00:10:51 UTC <MsYorksClass> A1: Absolutely. "In real life," technology is not a separate concept. There's no reason it should be in education either. #CSK8

773373115065774081 2016-09-06 04:11:33 UTC <MsYorksClass> Yay! So glad to hear it went well! Love @Seesaw! #SeesawAmbassador #allrams #GridleyEdhttps://twitter.com/wilsonroom8/status/773365478961979398
772648026980495360 2016-09-04 04:10:19 UTC <MsYorksClass> @TheWeirdTeacher 63 proposals later, ... it's still working out! http://donorschoose.org/msyork Good luck with yours! *goes off to retweet it*
772647797732454401 2016-09-04 04:09:24 UTC <MsYorksClass> @TheWeirdTeacher I'm full of those kinda-good ideas.  Srsly though, I've had proposals that weren't funded, then I split them up, & voila!
772646379139182592 2016-09-04 04:03:46 UTC <MsYorksClass> @TheWeirdTeacher Ask 4 them separately and they might get funded quicker! Proposals under $200 have (almost) always been funded immediately.
772645637271588864 2016-09-04 04:00:49 UTC <MsYorksClass> A5: Makerspaces, professional development, parent-teacher communication, school culture, STEAM, tech privacy, homework, etc. #OREdChat

772640923666685952 2016-09-04 03:42:05 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: Transition time, particularly at the start of the yr. Still use the 'ole"Give Me Five" standby, which works 4 immediate attn.  #OREdChat
772639835391528960 2016-09-04 03:37:46 UTC <MsYorksClass> A1: This year, one rule: "At any given moment, be your best self." I used to use clips/behavior charts, ... yadda yadda. No more. #OREdChat

758221611581399040 2016-07-27 08:44:53 UTC <MsYorksClass> @TheWeirdTeacher People can swipe up and send you a chat about your snap, but others won't see it. FYI
758075752667459584 2016-07-26 23:05:18 UTC <MsYorksClass> @TheWeirdTeacher Yes, & they'll see even more of that through my Twitter and Instagram. But, in my experience, more past students see snaps.
758075012762914816 2016-07-26 23:02:22 UTC <MsYorksClass> @TheWeirdTeacher 100% agree. My last post was in reference to past students. They're still my kids even when they're gone.
758074737041874946 2016-07-26 23:01:16 UTC <MsYorksClass> @TheWeirdTeacher Past Ss follow me and through my consistent snaps, I know they're seeing positive edu messages, even when not at school.
758074042230243328 2016-07-26 22:58:30 UTC <MsYorksClass> .@TheWeirdTeacher Snapchat forces you to stay relevant to your students. Everything disappears w/in 24 hrs. You don't post, you don't exist.

706701743627722753 2016-03-06 04:43:20 UTC <MsYorksClass> A5: Regarding Ss, move beyond the content. Focus on skills: collaboration, communication, self-motivation. Adaptive learning.  #caedchat
706699501046599680 2016-03-06 04:34:25 UTC <MsYorksClass> A4: I wasn't a BTSA fan, but it did spark connections w/colleagues. If I knew the power of Twitter/Voxer PLNs back then though...  #caedchat
706695998848937984 2016-03-06 04:20:30 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: Definitely the Ss themselves. Also, saying "I know I didn't learn this until Gr 7, but let's give it a shot!" re: algebra.  #caedchat
706693381385138176 2016-03-06 04:10:06 UTC <MsYorksClass> A1: Wish there had been classes titled "How to Communicate w/Ps," "Don't Grade Everything," or "The Importance of Collaboration"  #caedchat

706680931675873281 2016-03-06 03:20:38 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: A "letter gradeless classroom"? I think of authentic feedback, engagement, and continual learning with no end-point. #bcedchat
706680132887384064 2016-03-06 03:17:27 UTC <MsYorksClass> A1: Grading: Subjective, student ranking, summative. Assessment: Guides instruction, finds skill gaps, formative. #bcedchat

693988700414304256 2016-01-31 02:46:14 UTC <MsYorksClass> @kickkrowley @WonderWorkshop Oooh, no! I haven't heard of that! *Saunters off to look...*
693988304681734144 2016-01-31 02:44:40 UTC <MsYorksClass> @kat_goyette Our elementary school is just starting this! Very excited to see it! #allrams #DLDay #cuerockstarhttps://twitter.com/kat_goyette/status/693987322690301952
693987299130867712 2016-01-31 02:40:40 UTC <MsYorksClass> @kickkrowley IDK yet, lol! We just received the Ollies on Thursday! I thought they were more codable. I think I like Dash/Sphero better. ;)
693985485887123456 2016-01-31 02:33:28 UTC <MsYorksClass> @JudyArzt @craigyen We used @quivervision on Friday! Loads of fun! https://twitter.com/Room36Aloha/status/693135724040683520 #DLDay #cuerockstar
693985208425578496 2016-01-31 02:32:21 UTC <MsYorksClass> @sallenzoom On that day, I likely will! Thank you again for the offer!
693984378523758592 2016-01-31 02:29:04 UTC <MsYorksClass> A3: Not necessarily, but it helps! Class GHO/Skype, working in pairs/groups, ... #DLDay #cuerockstar
693983480753950720 2016-01-31 02:25:30 UTC <MsYorksClass> @JennJudkins @jennjudkins @tickleapp I have the app, but haven't used it much yet. So far we've been using the Blockly app for Dash, and Sphero SPRK. :)
693981846380498944 2016-01-31 02:19:00 UTC <MsYorksClass> A2: I want to have a robotic #DLDay. Our room now has a Dash, Ollies, and Spheros... obstacle course coding time! #cuerockstar
693981178194300930 2016-01-31 02:16:21 UTC <MsYorksClass> A1: The sub day is my fav: Slides in G-Classroom w/agenda & links to Padlets, adaptive math, Docs... I check in all day! #DLDay #cuerockstar
693980472213241857 2016-01-31 02:13:32 UTC <MsYorksClass> A1: This is the first year I've heard of an official #DLDay. I think I have them often! Especially on sub days! #1:1rocks #cuerockstar

693854765206253569 2016-01-31 17:54:01 UTC <MsYorksClass> @itsmyschool @darrenmassa @bribriggs I put it on there months ago. ;) I just liked Chromavid for photo b/c the interface is super simple!

693678266402500609 2016-01-30 06:12:41 UTC <MsYorksClass> @darrenmassa @bribriggs Yep, that's what I've got now! I like Chromavid on my phone for GS photo and hoped it worked on iPad, but no.
693676719719321600 2016-01-30 06:06:32 UTC <MsYorksClass> @darrenmassa @bribriggs How about an easy use green screen photo app for iPad? Photo, not video. ???
