962839459887833088 2018-02-11 00:03:10 UTC <itsjavan> @katerlinloves Well Ive been kicked out of a terminal before... but it may be the actual airplane this time. This flight attendant and I are gonna have issues.
962839000343109632 2018-02-11 00:01:21 UTC <itsjavan> @katerlinloves Kaitlin. I just about got kicked off the plane. Ill text you when I land LOL!
962829067484631040 2018-02-11 23:21:52 UTC <itsjavan> We just left the gate to take off and had a medical emergency and are turning back around. Someone better be dead.
962825485809004544 2018-02-11 23:07:38 UTC <itsjavan> These flight attendants are treading on thin ice.pic.twitter.com/fzbmqYtW78
962822703764918272 2018-02-11 22:56:35 UTC <itsjavan> @SouthwestAir this is UNACCEPTABLE. Weve now been sitting in the plane for 45 minutes after they told us were ready to take off. I WILL NEVER fly Southwest again.
962819848161161216 2018-02-11 22:45:14 UTC <itsjavan> I feel another Javan getting kicked out of Denver International style mental breakdown if @SouthwestAir doesnt get this dmn flight in the air.

962804149766250496 2018-02-11 21:42:51 UTC <itsjavan> These fools are now saying theyre waiting until their engineers in Texas give the ok.. but since its Sunday they are not sure how long it will take. Check yo self @SouthwestAir
962796580574318593 2018-02-11 21:12:47 UTC <itsjavan> Dear @SouthwestAir crew: dont tell customers itll be 30 minutes when your app and emails are updating us in live time and telling us the departure will be almost an hour and a half later.
962791660437598208 2018-02-11 20:53:14 UTC <itsjavan> Flight now delayed 2 1/2 hours. @SouthwestAir, WHAT THE HELL. Get yourself together.
962789267310333952 2018-02-11 20:43:43 UTC <itsjavan> Dear @SouthwestAir, I love you, but my flight is delayed and schedule is completely screwed for a dent on the luggage compartment. Its ridiculous.

I tweeted calling her out on it. One of her fan accounts RTed me which ended up with me having HUNDREDS of mentions by her dumb 13 year old fans.
951321645851054081 2018-01-10 05:15:29 UTC <itsjavan> @GregOrman @RubinaCook @WichitaCindy @jlondagin Yeah thats bad. A good social media team should know removing comments is a no-no.

950450308597022721 2018-01-08 19:33:06 UTC <itsjavan> @VaughnFry That would be like saying Obamas presidency should be commemorated for being our first black president. Its historical.
950450062353682433 2018-01-08 19:32:08 UTC <itsjavan> @VaughnFry A good actor/model is good regardless of race true. However there are fewer models/actors of color due to hidden race issues in or society. Awards such as this give a more even playing field for those of color.

938450181799981058 2017-12-06 16:48:53 UTC <itsjavan> @GregOrman @jlondagin I think Greg should maintain an independent ticket and the dems should cave and bow out. And Independent Vs a GOP lead by Kobach has the best odds of a win. Plus, I like Greg better than the field of Dem candidates.
938449312748589057 2017-12-06 16:45:26 UTC <itsjavan> @GregOrman @jlondagin I think the other Dems will drop out before it gets to that. Carl should especially drop out. Greg as an Independent stands a much better chance in Kansas winning than a dem.

935660607512117248 2017-11-28 00:04:07 UTC <itsjavan> I love watching Hoarders because once you've seen it all you come across a guy who has raccoon penis bones hoarded in a box and suddenly your day is complete.

935565654354219009 2017-11-28 17:46:48 UTC <itsjavan> This is not the kind of article you want to see while reading tweets on the toilet.https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/935556440927989760
935366032604135424 2017-11-27 04:33:35 UTC <itsjavan> I can't handle it. It's just disgusting.
935364134190960640 2017-11-27 04:26:02 UTC <itsjavan> Exactly. It's petrifying to think about.
935355032807014400 2017-11-27 03:49:52 UTC <itsjavan> The saddest part is, even though laws prevent segregation & discrimination, views of many people have not changed. People in their 20s during the 1960s are now in their 60s & 70s. Some have not changed. They're still alive. They're still racist. They're still dangerous.
935354319360200705 2017-11-27 03:47:02 UTC <itsjavan> Watching "Selma" and I cannot handle it. I would've been murdered had I lived in the 60s. I cannot fathom how any white people thought any of that was ever OK. No race is superior to another.

930644971002191878 2017-11-14 03:53:46 UTC <itsjavan> @calamitygina  you have caution tape?
930640420467552256 2017-11-14 03:35:41 UTC <itsjavan> @ladygaga @CKMarie23 It might, but it'll be hot inside! I tried to order a pink hat, but didn't pull it off. So I'm so unprepared!
930638583119204352 2017-11-14 03:28:23 UTC <itsjavan> @ladygaga @CKMarie23 I know! I'm not sure what to wear tomorrow either! I feel my past outfits can never be matched (also, no one wants to see me in only caution tape these days haha).
930638177030823936 2017-11-14 03:26:46 UTC <itsjavan> The real question is... what should I wear to the Lady Gaga concert? Unfortunately the butcher shop is already closed and I have no caution tape?
930637781788962816 2017-11-14 03:25:12 UTC <itsjavan> @KristinBaBistin I've seen her four times. Her vocals are always amazing. Definitely worth the money!

908559160844808192 2017-09-14 05:12:38 UTC <itsjavan> There are now two boys line dancing to "Sexyback"... and you all thought Kansas was country.
908558780563996673 2017-09-14 05:11:08 UTC <itsjavan> Out at a bar in Denver and it's the best people watching. 
908471079139774469 2017-09-14 23:22:38 UTC <itsjavan> So if you buy get one of the Tibetan Agate wraps, know it was the scene of a vicious battle between good and evil... and evil won.pic.twitter.com/PkqvGS9IDf
908470017989148673 2017-09-14 23:18:25 UTC <itsjavan> I just had to fight a grandma for the last strands of this Tibetan Agate at the gemstone trade show in Denver.

907688361443381248 2017-09-12 19:32:24 UTC <itsjavan> Passed a billboard trying to convince people to move to a small Kansas town. It read: "Wakeeny: it's affordable."  Tough sell.
907679336207175680 2017-09-12 18:56:32 UTC <itsjavan> Somehow my radio landed on Alex Jones' talk show. This man needs serious psychiatric help.
907663596183855104 2017-09-12 17:53:59 UTC <itsjavan> Last time I drove to Colorado I got three tickets in a weekend. Let's take bets on how many I will get in a week!
907662911723667456 2017-09-12 17:51:16 UTC <itsjavan> @tallgrass @lanadellit Hope you can make it! Bring your friends and don't forget to bring your own chair! It'll be a great night!
907662448559316994 2017-09-12 17:49:25 UTC <itsjavan> @tallgrass @lanadellit Yes ma'am! J. ANDREW will also have a giveaway for passes for the festival!
907662158221266945 2017-09-12 17:48:16 UTC <itsjavan> Finally on the road. Look out Denver!
907653288409137152 2017-09-12 17:13:01 UTC <itsjavan> @daphne_nicole Not yet! But I'm heading there today! I'll let you know what I find hahaha
907653217034620930 2017-09-12 17:12:44 UTC <itsjavan> We're partnering with my favorite local festival, @tallgrass, for a special screening of Scream (Ft. Tallgrass special guest Rose McGowan)!https://twitter.com/jandrewdesign/status/907652852767752192
907479087584866304 2017-09-11 05:40:49 UTC <itsjavan> @daphne_nicole When are you going to Denver?
907433276494802945 2017-09-11 02:38:47 UTC <itsjavan> @erawson  or free!
907424403776000002 2017-09-11 02:03:31 UTC <itsjavan> @michaelriedl LaGuardia is awful hahaha! Also, I have a strong hatred for STL!
907423898551152642 2017-09-11 02:01:31 UTC <itsjavan> @michaelriedl haha I know! Same with the bids for the World Cup! No one wants to fly into KCI. I actually have started flying ICT instead.
907423274258354176 2017-09-11 01:59:02 UTC <itsjavan> @michaelriedl 100% agree. KCI is an embarrassment to Kansas City. Frankly, I think KCI will have an impact on future bids (such as the bid for Amazon).
907417158363308032 2017-09-11 01:34:44 UTC <itsjavan> Anyone know of any rafting companies still doing trips this late in the season near Denver?

906215982536028160 2017-09-08 18:01:41 UTC <itsjavan> Working for yourself is awesome... but I swear I've put in more hours of work self-employed than in my entire life for someone else.
906215253930856448 2017-09-08 17:58:47 UTC <itsjavan> Two meetings down, two more to go. Three more orders to ship and two websites to update/design. I though Friday's were supposed to be easy?
906214123163275264 2017-09-08 17:54:18 UTC <itsjavan> @ks4isu The last time I was there I saw two prostitution exchanges and a whole family in MAGA gear.

905801691299287040 2017-09-07 14:35:26 UTC <itsjavan> Ambien update: I'm still alive. This is a miracle pill 
905647893742182400 2017-09-06 04:24:18 UTC <itsjavan> So far I'm disappointed with the results. I could've chugged a bottle of whiskey and passed out sooner.
905645242791018498 2017-09-06 04:13:46 UTC <itsjavan> Haven't been able to sleep well for three nights. Trying an Ambien tonight... if you don't hear from me in 8hrs I'm dead.
905599844399681536 2017-09-06 01:13:22 UTC <itsjavan> No ma'am, no ham, no turkey.
905579036449136640 2017-09-06 23:50:41 UTC <itsjavan> Reading reviews on Facebook makes me cringe. If you use poor spelling/grammar and call the staff "assholes," you're probably the problem.
905516751932329986 2017-09-06 19:43:12 UTC <itsjavan> @WichitaMag It's beautiful to see such creates in their natural habitat.  Oh, also, raising money for SCZ is a good cause too.

905167872816766982 2017-09-05 20:36:52 UTC <itsjavan> If you think it's ok to rip children from their family and friends to send them to a country that's foreign to them then you're a sociopath.

895840603233284096 2017-08-10 02:53:38 UTC <itsjavan> The @CityofWichita is in good hands with @SWAbalsley for the redesign of #NaftzgerPark...

895797964853178368 2017-08-10 00:04:12 UTC <itsjavan> One commenter mentioned they want less events because she lives in the area. If you don't like a busy neighborhood, don't live downtown.

895794309248802817 2017-08-10 23:49:41 UTC <itsjavan> Not having bathrooms is a main issue this meeting. Fact is, most cities with a park this size DO NOT have public restroom. #NaftzgerPark

895483472025866242 2017-08-09 03:14:31 UTC <itsjavan> I do hope, however, they crack down on the amount of drugs and alcohol in the park. As a business owner who works on the block...
895483182832693248 2017-08-09 03:13:22 UTC <itsjavan> The city is in NO WAY forcing the homeless out of the park. They are instead creating an INCLUSIVE environment for everyone; homeless & nothttps://twitter.com/KathsBurgess/status/895424755989458944

890761127365414912 2017-07-27 02:29:36 UTC <itsjavan> @CityofWichita @tynigh .. I was very concerned about the homeless there... but after meeting w/ the design team, they assure the new park will be inclusive for all
890760958234296320 2017-07-27 02:28:56 UTC <itsjavan> @CityofWichita @tynigh Unfortunately the money is a tax increase on the local businesses and cannot be used on anything other than re-designing the park...
890760004722151424 2017-07-27 02:25:09 UTC <itsjavan> @DowntownWichita great meeting! As you know, I was apprehensive at 1st, but all my concerns were answered. The new architects have an awesome, modern vision
890734570634661888 2017-07-27 00:44:05 UTC <itsjavan> @DowntownWichita @CityofWichita The concepts they showed are amazing and will bring more people to downtown and be a gathering place for everyone.
890734436647673856 2017-07-27 00:43:33 UTC <itsjavan> I was definitely on edge, but good job @CityofWichita & @DowntownWichita! The architects to redesign Naftzger park are top notch!
890722336617496576 2017-07-27 23:55:28 UTC <itsjavan> ... not just homeless or not just young professionals.
890722255067635712 2017-07-27 23:55:09 UTC <itsjavan> Citizen concern for the homeless is heartwarming. New architects WILL make park more inclusive for everyone...
890720296570941440 2017-07-27 23:47:22 UTC <itsjavan> "Our design will be more inclusive." - Architect on homeless population who currently live at the park. #NaftzgerPark @DowntownWichita
890709329661349888 2017-07-27 23:03:47 UTC <itsjavan> Important points of Naftzger meeting: creating open space for events, maintaining shaded areas with mature trees, creating modern urban feel
890706382101643264 2017-07-27 22:52:04 UTC <itsjavan> Old cantankerous citizens think they're on an episode of Parks & Recreation. Keep interrupting speakers.

890693478069489665 2017-07-27 22:00:48 UTC <itsjavan> @kyl33_xx I'm not, I just find it ironic. By your original argument you wouldn't be a photographer. I'm the one defending photography as a hobby.

890350921879879680 2017-07-26 23:19:36 UTC <itsjavan> While I agree something needs to be done, the preliminary design is horrid and DESTORYS the charm of the park. Come listen 5:30pm tomorrow.
890350245527375872 2017-07-26 23:16:55 UTC <itsjavan> Tomorrow there's a public meeting to discuss the redesign of Naftzger Park. Come join in the discussion!https://twitter.com/downtownwichita/status/890251622034665473

890022203323973632 2017-07-25 01:33:23 UTC <itsjavan> @theraynoldo Oh I'm sure you do. I totally believe the issue is with funding, however complaints are bound to happen when people wait in line 30+ min.
889970041126617089 2017-07-25 22:06:07 UTC <itsjavan> People wonder why the US Postal Service is failing? Maybe it's the ridiculous lines and pathetic customer service?

889862219428704256 2017-07-25 14:57:40 UTC <itsjavan> @FuriousGeorge76 No... I found it in the Alley... but picked it up specifically for that purpose 
889860594328903680 2017-07-25 14:51:13 UTC <itsjavan> @____dale Also, I have concern for where they will move the homeless. If they don't want them in the park, that's fine, but they should be relocated.
889860386618585089 2017-07-25 14:50:23 UTC <itsjavan> @____dale They shouldn't remove any trees! A community garden would be cool, but just having a clean, shady park downtown would be amazing.

854478364597465089 2017-04-18 23:34:52 UTC <itsjavan> @KWCH12 People are sad. How can anyone work against those less fortunate and homeless in our community?
854477953467658240 2017-04-18 23:33:14 UTC <itsjavan> Man on @KWCH12 says panhandlers should be illegal in Wichita because they will "make our city look bad" during the 2018 NCAA tournament.
854458942126264326 2017-04-18 22:17:41 UTC <itsjavan> True... but to say she can't sing is a disgrace. She truly has a beautiful voice... especially in acoustic performances.
854456733623832576 2017-04-18 22:08:54 UTC <itsjavan> My co-worker claims Lady Gaga cannot sing. Someone needs to call 911 because there is about to be bloodshed.
854456038988406784 2017-04-18 22:06:09 UTC <itsjavan> Taking a trip to Portland beginning of May... should I visit Seattle, Vancouver or head to the coast for Cannon Beach?

854451354106044417 2017-04-18 21:47:32 UTC <itsjavan> @Ask_WellsFargo There was a glitch in your payment system which has resulted in me (with a perfect payment history) being charged $170. NOT HAPPY.
854425230634356736 2017-04-18 20:03:44 UTC <itsjavan> The customer service at @WellsFargo is laughable; a complete joke. If you ever consider opening an account with them, run the other way!

847249045588328448 2017-03-29 00:48:08 UTC <itsjavan> They're explaining DMs in the vocabulary section... Used in a sentence: "Becky just slid into my DMs"

847237116589256705 2017-03-29 00:00:44 UTC <itsjavan> The class is "Marketing with Social Media"... I'm not quite sure some of these peeps have ever been on Twitter.

846943465019752448 2017-03-28 04:33:52 UTC <itsjavan> @shelbyrowell ugh he is. Thompson actually seems more like an "everyday Kansan" than Estes. He had GUNS in his ad for crying out loud.
846940414699606017 2017-03-28 04:21:44 UTC <itsjavan> ... with that being said, all three candidates are unpolished.
846939297144094725 2017-03-28 04:17:18 UTC <itsjavan> Finally watching the KS KWCH debate. Estes sounds like a GOP recording. No charisma. Thompson sounds relatable, down to earth.

825941721573912577 2017-01-29 05:40:26 UTC <itsjavan> @ItsNagen that's the irony. All white citizens in the US had family that were immigrants at one point

825936167870816256 2017-01-29 05:18:22 UTC <itsjavan> The life of an immigrant is worth the same as a life of an American citizen. We're all humans.
825935517527240705 2017-01-29 05:15:47 UTC <itsjavan> When you spout off hate, intolerance or indifference. You're talking about a living, human being with a life and family.
825934619598008320 2017-01-29 05:12:13 UTC <itsjavan> When you talk about Mexicans or immigrants, you're not talking about some random person. You're talking about me. My family. My friends.

762081642873778176 2016-08-06 00:23:17 UTC <itsjavan> Of course my seats are in front of the obnoxiously loud suburban family with a thick southern accent who insists on continuously talking.

759052501077336065 2016-07-29 15:46:33 UTC <itsjavan> her hiring of Debbie Schultz was the last straw in my book. That was a slap to the face.
759052319493267457 2016-07-29 15:45:50 UTC <itsjavan> under numerous shady circumstances. I'd love to see a woman, even over Bern. Just not one drowning in conspiracies.
759048419075915776 2016-07-29 15:30:20 UTC <itsjavan> if that happened I bet the DNC would be a lot more careful about how the listen to the people. 
759048016208666625 2016-07-29 15:28:44 UTC <itsjavan> @RiotFest yes. Single-Ply toilet paper should be outlawed and those whom purchase such imprisoned. #TwoPlyMinimum #TreatYoBum

758860750337167360 2016-07-28 03:04:36 UTC <itsjavan> @SalvadorKid yeah, that's Han's son. Because he's a fan favorite. Plus it's Luke's nephew (Luke is the chosen one who brings balance)
758860549207695361 2016-07-28 03:03:48 UTC <itsjavan> @SalvadorKid it's the only way this newest film will make sense.
758860252380930048 2016-07-28 03:02:37 UTC <itsjavan> @SalvadorKid it's a futuristic take on ancient Rome. Watch them in order. Episode I, II, III, IV, V, VI, then the newest one.
758854853544161280 2016-07-28 02:41:10 UTC <itsjavan> Watching "Escaping Polygamy". This show is no joke. People are insane.

758113246863773696 2016-07-26 01:34:17 UTC <itsjavan> @ImIsaiahShaver because she played it safe. She went for a middle of the road no one instead of a progressive name.

756741258928726018 2016-07-22 06:42:30 UTC <itsjavan> @breeashhh @photosquids  if you're choking on a bone you're doing it wrong.
756740910717677568 2016-07-22 06:41:07 UTC <itsjavan> @breeashhh @photosquids I don't think you can be a true wing fan if you don't like bone-in. Bones less wings = popcorn chicken in sauce.
756740733910921216 2016-07-22 06:40:25 UTC <itsjavan> @breeashhh @photosquids nah, they're never better. Boneless wings are a white people invention. Along with flavors like "Parmesan garlic"
756740274160668672 2016-07-22 06:38:35 UTC <itsjavan> @photosquids @breeashhh  basically.
756739961697689601 2016-07-22 06:37:21 UTC <itsjavan> @photosquids @breeashhh I gotta agree. Boneless aren't real wings.

753657469969264646 2016-07-14 18:28:37 UTC <itsjavan> Business owners should encourage employees to be their best. To help them grow personally, and grow as a company. Not hold back and abuse.
753653890508288000 2016-07-14 18:14:24 UTC <itsjavan> Bullying should never be tolerated or overlooked in the workplace. Bystanders are just as much to blame for abuse as the abuser.
753653676972146688 2016-07-14 18:13:33 UTC <itsjavan> A business owner should never publicly demean an employee by calling them "mental" or an "asshole"... especially in front of other employees

753076082476187648 2016-07-12 03:58:24 UTC <itsjavan> @C_DURR like you're generalize all the protesters?
753075897050292224 2016-07-12 03:57:39 UTC <itsjavan> @shelbyrowell exactly! EVERYONE should be in support of a minority who's being victimized. Otherwise, you're a bully. Plain and simple.
753075719064936448 2016-07-12 03:56:57 UTC <itsjavan> @C_DURR regardless, I agree that's not how to do it, but the majority weren't. It was a largely peaceful protest
753075594892541952 2016-07-12 03:56:27 UTC <itsjavan> @C_DURR  you mean like police offers do on a regular basis?
753074975553249281 2016-07-12 03:54:00 UTC <itsjavan> @JBlazeSmith @Dakin_Ledford or... The existing police can do their job properly like they signed up to do?
753074547469983744 2016-07-12 03:52:18 UTC <itsjavan> @C_DURR @MajorsSydney that's not what the protest was about. The protest is bringing attention to police brutality against the blk community

I tweeted calling her out on it. One of her fan accounts RTed me which ended up with me having HUNDREDS of mentions by her dumb 13 year old fans.
951321645851054081 2018-01-10 05:15:29 UTC <itsjavan> @GregOrman @RubinaCook @WichitaCindy @jlondagin Yeah thats bad. A good social media team should know removing comments is a no-no.

950450308597022721 2018-01-08 19:33:06 UTC <itsjavan> @VaughnFry That would be like saying Obamas presidency should be commemorated for being our first black president. Its historical.
950450062353682433 2018-01-08 19:32:08 UTC <itsjavan> @VaughnFry A good actor/model is good regardless of race true. However there are fewer models/actors of color due to hidden race issues in or society. Awards such as this give a more even playing field for those of color.

944081681622978560 2017-12-21 05:46:27 UTC <itsjavan> The upside to having resting bitch face is that everyone who goes to sit at the bar next to you decides to sit elsewhere and you can get drinks much quicker.

938450181799981058 2017-12-06 16:48:53 UTC <itsjavan> @GregOrman @jlondagin I think Greg should maintain an independent ticket and the dems should cave and bow out. And Independent Vs a GOP lead by Kobach has the best odds of a win. Plus, I like Greg better than the field of Dem candidates.
938449312748589057 2017-12-06 16:45:26 UTC <itsjavan> @GregOrman @jlondagin I think the other Dems will drop out before it gets to that. Carl should especially drop out. Greg as an Independent stands a much better chance in Kansas winning than a dem.

935364134190960640 2017-11-27 04:26:02 UTC <itsjavan> Exactly. It's petrifying to think about.
935355032807014400 2017-11-27 03:49:52 UTC <itsjavan> The saddest part is, even though laws prevent segregation & discrimination, views of many people have not changed. People in their 20s during the 1960s are now in their 60s & 70s. Some have not changed. They're still alive. They're still racist. They're still dangerous.
935354319360200705 2017-11-27 03:47:02 UTC <itsjavan> Watching "Selma" and I cannot handle it. I would've been murdered had I lived in the 60s. I cannot fathom how any white people thought any of that was ever OK. No race is superior to another.

930638583119204352 2017-11-14 03:28:23 UTC <itsjavan> @ladygaga @CKMarie23 I know! I'm not sure what to wear tomorrow either! I feel my past outfits can never be matched (also, no one wants to see me in only caution tape these days haha).
930638177030823936 2017-11-14 03:26:46 UTC <itsjavan> The real question is... what should I wear to the Lady Gaga concert? Unfortunately the butcher shop is already closed and I have no caution tape?

907688361443381248 2017-09-12 19:32:24 UTC <itsjavan> Passed a billboard trying to convince people to move to a small Kansas town. It read: "Wakeeny: it's affordable."  Tough sell.

907423898551152642 2017-09-11 02:01:31 UTC <itsjavan> @michaelriedl haha I know! Same with the bids for the World Cup! No one wants to fly into KCI. I actually have started flying ICT instead.
907423274258354176 2017-09-11 01:59:02 UTC <itsjavan> @michaelriedl 100% agree. KCI is an embarrassment to Kansas City. Frankly, I think KCI will have an impact on future bids (such as the bid for Amazon).
907417158363308032 2017-09-11 01:34:44 UTC <itsjavan> Anyone know of any rafting companies still doing trips this late in the season near Denver?

906215982536028160 2017-09-08 18:01:41 UTC <itsjavan> Working for yourself is awesome... but I swear I've put in more hours of work self-employed than in my entire life for someone else.
906215253930856448 2017-09-08 17:58:47 UTC <itsjavan> Two meetings down, two more to go. Three more orders to ship and two websites to update/design. I though Friday's were supposed to be easy?

905647893742182400 2017-09-06 04:24:18 UTC <itsjavan> So far I'm disappointed with the results. I could've chugged a bottle of whiskey and passed out sooner.
905645242791018498 2017-09-06 04:13:46 UTC <itsjavan> Haven't been able to sleep well for three nights. Trying an Ambien tonight... if you don't hear from me in 8hrs I'm dead.

905579036449136640 2017-09-06 23:50:41 UTC <itsjavan> Reading reviews on Facebook makes me cringe. If you use poor spelling/grammar and call the staff "assholes," you're probably the problem.
905516751932329986 2017-09-06 19:43:12 UTC <itsjavan> @WichitaMag It's beautiful to see such creates in their natural habitat.  Oh, also, raising money for SCZ is a good cause too.

890761127365414912 2017-07-27 02:29:36 UTC <itsjavan> @CityofWichita @tynigh .. I was very concerned about the homeless there... but after meeting w/ the design team, they assure the new park will be inclusive for all
890760958234296320 2017-07-27 02:28:56 UTC <itsjavan> @CityofWichita @tynigh Unfortunately the money is a tax increase on the local businesses and cannot be used on anything other than re-designing the park...
890760004722151424 2017-07-27 02:25:09 UTC <itsjavan> @DowntownWichita great meeting! As you know, I was apprehensive at 1st, but all my concerns were answered. The new architects have an awesome, modern vision
890734570634661888 2017-07-27 00:44:05 UTC <itsjavan> @DowntownWichita @CityofWichita The concepts they showed are amazing and will bring more people to downtown and be a gathering place for everyone.
890734436647673856 2017-07-27 00:43:33 UTC <itsjavan> I was definitely on edge, but good job @CityofWichita & @DowntownWichita! The architects to redesign Naftzger park are top notch!
890722336617496576 2017-07-27 23:55:28 UTC <itsjavan> ... not just homeless or not just young professionals.
890722255067635712 2017-07-27 23:55:09 UTC <itsjavan> Citizen concern for the homeless is heartwarming. New architects WILL make park more inclusive for everyone...

890709329661349888 2017-07-27 23:03:47 UTC <itsjavan> Important points of Naftzger meeting: creating open space for events, maintaining shaded areas with mature trees, creating modern urban feel

890693478069489665 2017-07-27 22:00:48 UTC <itsjavan> @kyl33_xx I'm not, I just find it ironic. By your original argument you wouldn't be a photographer. I'm the one defending photography as a hobby.

889860594328903680 2017-07-25 14:51:13 UTC <itsjavan> @____dale Also, I have concern for where they will move the homeless. If they don't want them in the park, that's fine, but they should be relocated.
889860386618585089 2017-07-25 14:50:23 UTC <itsjavan> @____dale They shouldn't remove any trees! A community garden would be cool, but just having a clean, shady park downtown would be amazing.

880930801600409600 2017-06-30 23:27:24 UTC <itsjavan> @walmarthelp I would like a written copy of this policy. The associate said I could not come back that day or even the next day alone and purchase?
880913656019656705 2017-06-30 22:19:16 UTC <itsjavan> @walmarthelp He was at the store independently buying his own groceries. We happened to be in the same checkout.

880593292370612226 2017-06-29 01:06:16 UTC <itsjavan> @Walmart because I doubt they would've brought the police for a 24 year old white guy attempting to purchase a single bottle w/ groceries.
880592960127107072 2017-06-29 01:04:56 UTC <itsjavan> @Walmart ... They brought over a police officer instead of the manager I asked for. Is this because we were a group of minorities?
880592776576069633 2017-06-29 01:04:13 UTC <itsjavan> @Walmart I want the written policy! One associate said I couldn't come back tomorrow alone to buy it. When asked to see the policy...
880588856374046720 2017-06-29 00:48:38 UTC <itsjavan> @Walmart was also told that I cannot come back later without him to purchase. When asked to explain the policy they pulled security. 
880588393201225729 2017-06-29 00:46:48 UTC <itsjavan> Wasn't allowed to purchase wine at @Walmart because my brother happened to be in line behind me and he's not 21? Are you kidding me?
880283352389091329 2017-06-28 04:34:40 UTC <itsjavan> Watching the "What the Heath" documentary. Two words: Vegan Propaganda.

861729209839796224 2017-05-08 23:47:08 UTC <itsjavan> If your ass isn't drug off the plane by the attendants it'll definitely be delayed and forced to sleep in an airport. @united Sucks.
861727064331739136 2017-05-08 23:38:36 UTC <itsjavan> 35,000 feet is no place for celery.
861726968689041408 2017-05-08 23:38:14 UTC <itsjavan> These two will be the death of me. She just pulled out a full party-sized vegetable platter on this plane for a "snack".
861724868152180737 2017-05-08 23:29:53 UTC <itsjavan> She's been seated for 36 seconds and I already know she loves pop-rocks, can't see the chiropractor til Friday and needs her sugar. 
861724521585295360 2017-05-08 23:28:30 UTC <itsjavan> LORD HAVE MERCY. I'm seated next to a toddler and his annoying, trashy grandma. 
861711271502028801 2017-05-08 22:35:51 UTC <itsjavan> The irony is that I was defending @united to my friends 2 hours ago. Go figure. #UnitedDelays
861711106250743810 2017-05-08 22:35:12 UTC <itsjavan> My @united flight was delayed and I will almost certainly miss my connecting flight to Wichita. Ugh.
861659203261222912 2017-05-08 19:08:57 UTC <itsjavan> @pehungate This is not the statement that needed to be made. Where is the condemnation of your parents comments? The suspected hate crime at Azads?

860978143179542529 2017-05-06 22:02:40 UTC <itsjavan> Dear @pehungate, I believe your mother proves this tweet wrong. @WichitaStateSGA @WichitaState https://twitter.com/pehungate/status/293401611156475904
860974369886969856 2017-05-06 21:47:40 UTC <itsjavan> No one who works for @WichitaUSD259 should be allowed to keep their position after use of the N-Word against a person of color. @pehungate
860974126600552448 2017-05-06 21:46:42 UTC <itsjavan> Not only should @pehungate resign, her mother (Assistant Principal at NW High School @WichitaUSD259) should also resign.
860973229518708736 2017-05-06 21:43:08 UTC <itsjavan> Watched video of @pehungate's discussion with students at @WichitaState today. She is in no way fit for her position. #StepDown

860902332875194368 2017-05-06 17:01:25 UTC <itsjavan> One night out in PDX and I've seen too much... and had a rat the size of a chihuahua run across my shoe.
860775795714777088 2017-05-06 08:38:36 UTC <itsjavan> Yeah you made me feel, shiny and new! Like a virgin, touched for the very first time!
860733567722078208 2017-05-05 05:50:48 UTC <itsjavan> The MC at the burlesque show just made a speech about body positivity.  UGH! I LOVE PORTLAND!

860620990090432512 2017-05-05 22:23:28 UTC <itsjavan> @pehungate I may even suggestion stepping down, as your statements of inclusion I strongly question.
860620747714080768 2017-05-05 22:22:30 UTC <itsjavan> WSU deserves a statement from @pehungate. The actions of her parents are inexcusable and embarrassing.
860584007666356225 2017-05-05 19:56:30 UTC <itsjavan> Apparently Bob ate all the chocolates and Sheryl is pissed. Also, Bobs arm candy has fallen asleep while coloring.

859864540191707136 2017-05-03 20:17:36 UTC <itsjavan> Of course then I had to explain I fully believe in climate change and global warming and it was a joke.

848659503650353152 2017-04-02 22:12:47 UTC <itsjavan> However, last year they chose Golden Corral... so I suppose this can be seen as a minuscule improvement.

846943465019752448 2017-03-28 04:33:52 UTC <itsjavan> @shelbyrowell ugh he is. Thompson actually seems more like an "everyday Kansan" than Estes. He had GUNS in his ad for crying out loud.
846940414699606017 2017-03-28 04:21:44 UTC <itsjavan> ... with that being said, all three candidates are unpolished.
846939297144094725 2017-03-28 04:17:18 UTC <itsjavan> Finally watching the KS KWCH debate. Estes sounds like a GOP recording. No charisma. Thompson sounds relatable, down to earth.
846876076433444864 2017-03-28 00:06:05 UTC <itsjavan> @trevorreichle no. Not without being a literal asshole.

759052501077336065 2016-07-29 15:46:33 UTC <itsjavan> her hiring of Debbie Schultz was the last straw in my book. That was a slap to the face.

756741258928726018 2016-07-22 06:42:30 UTC <itsjavan> @breeashhh @photosquids  if you're choking on a bone you're doing it wrong.
756740910717677568 2016-07-22 06:41:07 UTC <itsjavan> @breeashhh @photosquids I don't think you can be a true wing fan if you don't like bone-in. Bones less wings = popcorn chicken in sauce.
756740733910921216 2016-07-22 06:40:25 UTC <itsjavan> @breeashhh @photosquids nah, they're never better. Boneless wings are a white people invention. Along with flavors like "Parmesan garlic"
756740274160668672 2016-07-22 06:38:35 UTC <itsjavan> @photosquids @breeashhh  basically.
756739961697689601 2016-07-22 06:37:21 UTC <itsjavan> @photosquids @breeashhh I gotta agree. Boneless aren't real wings.

753657469969264646 2016-07-14 18:28:37 UTC <itsjavan> Business owners should encourage employees to be their best. To help them grow personally, and grow as a company. Not hold back and abuse.
753653890508288000 2016-07-14 18:14:24 UTC <itsjavan> Bullying should never be tolerated or overlooked in the workplace. Bystanders are just as much to blame for abuse as the abuser.
753653676972146688 2016-07-14 18:13:33 UTC <itsjavan> A business owner should never publicly demean an employee by calling them "mental" or an "asshole"... especially in front of other employees

753073550194511872 2016-07-12 03:48:20 UTC <itsjavan> @JBlazeSmith @Dakin_Ledford  now that is one of the most asinine arguments I've read today.

753048871920541696 2016-07-12 02:10:16 UTC <itsjavan> @kwarren__ yeah, it's part of a collective protest across the country. No specific incident in Wichita (thank goodness!)
753048692844732417 2016-07-12 02:09:33 UTC <itsjavan> @TMAC7771 statistically, the protests are in greater danger.
753048399658704896 2016-07-12 02:08:24 UTC <itsjavan> @kwarren__ they are. In almost every major city across the country.

753047919859675136 2016-07-12 02:06:29 UTC <itsjavan> @MisterKT_ my feeble heart can't take reading ignorance tonight. 
753047731376041984 2016-07-12 02:05:44 UTC <itsjavan> @kwarren__ it's part of a collective voice. It's making an impression on people here in Wichita... Look, you're tweeting about it.

715901949191651329 2016-04-01 14:01:40 UTC <itsjavan> @theclintonwebb exactly! @WestarEnergy, have you by chance been collaborating with Gov. Brownback, this sounds like his brilliant ideas.
715901697306931200 2016-04-01 14:00:40 UTC <itsjavan> @theclintonwebb @WestarEnergy yeah, and did you see the hike for schools? Why are we supporting biz to the detriment of everyday citizens?
715901281722703872 2016-04-01 13:59:01 UTC <itsjavan> @theclintonwebb @WestarEnergy @kansasdotcom it truly sickens me that Westar would take advantage of people like they do.
715900989576843265 2016-04-01 13:57:51 UTC <itsjavan> @WestarEnergy you should be ashamed of yourselves! Bullying customers who have no other option but to use your services.
715900235550044161 2016-04-01 13:54:51 UTC <itsjavan> Apparently @WestarEnergy is taking notes from Sam Brownback. Hiking residential & school rates by 30% while cutting rates for biz & big biz.
