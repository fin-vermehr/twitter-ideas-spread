956665025942274048 2018-01-25 23:08:10 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Guys, the best thing happened to me today. I was leaving my friends house & there was a guy walking his puppy & she was so excited bc she seen me. He was like "I'm sorry, she would really like to say hello to you." & I was like  "it's completely fine."

956529224474550278 2018-01-25 14:08:33 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I was up at 5, the roads were barely icy. They sent out a PSA that schools will not start until 10/11. My thought: "CPS would've been like "y'all are good, regular time." 
956412837806555137 2018-01-24 06:26:04 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Still laughing at that picture

955906757104037889 2018-01-23 20:55:05 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> When I use to hang out with ol' boy we would sing "goodbye," by Chris brown on our way home.  & I guess I should've realized that was a sign 
955881347540688896 2018-01-23 19:14:07 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I had a dream I couldn't find my house and while I was trying to find it, I was attacked by a moose.

955222216555118592 2018-01-21 23:34:58 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Some of the people in this fucking town are rude as fuck. I got a broken arm and they all stared as I tried to bring the cart in and hold the fucking door. Smh

954956148213301248 2018-01-20 05:57:42 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> That actually care what the future looks like. Thank you for making a stand for women all over the world: past, present, and future. 
954956146036555776 2018-01-20 05:57:42 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> As for me, I applaud those of you who went out and marched today. Thank you for taking a stand and fighting for what's right. Thank you for marching for me and those who were unable to. Thank you for marching and telling your story. Thank you for being one of the very few people
954956144027451392 2018-01-20 05:57:41 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> And find what these individuals do to be "pointless," or "idiotic," but at the end of the day they're the ones out there trying to make a difference while you sit there and bash how they chose to spend their Saturday.
954956142240673793 2018-01-20 05:57:41 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Exactly the case for other individuals. Lastly, the marches that happened all over the country today were far from pointless. But sitting here and bashing people for taking a step for what is right, isn't going to get you anywhere. You may remain close minded
954956139707301888 2018-01-20 05:57:40 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Voices have been silenced. Women do NOT belong in the kitchen making you a sandwich, they belong wherever they damn well please. Educate yourself before commenting on ANY matter, if you feel as if your rights have been equal all along... good for you. But perhaps that isn't
954956137148764160 2018-01-20 05:57:39 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Today's march wasn't solely based on just our rights as women! This march was meant to have our voices heard, to stand for many reasons, many of which have been caused by this SHITTY presidency. Women all over the country marched in honor of those who couldn't, and those whose
954956134351216640 2018-01-20 05:57:39 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Belonging in the kitchen, this is about abortion not women's rights, or it's stupid because some of the women have never felt as if they didn't have equal rights, etc. This has pissed me off to no return.
954956129569665024 2018-01-20 05:57:38 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I'm on Facebook reading the comments left under a video of women marching in the town I live in. What baffles me is the amount of small minded individuals commenting that the women's march is "pointless." Some of these individuals were commenting about these women
954928796003520512 2018-01-20 04:09:01 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> You still a ain't shit ass individual

946955135783092225 2017-12-29 04:04:32 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I was sick at the beginning of the year, then in the summer, then October - November, and now again in December. Lolpic.twitter.com/fwbzs1pW0Q
946954873420914688 2017-12-29 04:03:30 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I have the worst immune system. 
946943756699279361 2017-12-29 03:19:19 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I will forever be grateful for the memories I've shared with people that are no longer in my life. But I'm even more grateful for those that are still by my side. 
946927218223017984 2017-12-29 02:13:36 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Idk man, just some thoughts. 
946927146739515393 2017-12-29 02:13:19 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Like "oh we have a kid together." So? Wouldn't you rather have your child see you co-parent together rather than see you both suffer in an unhappy relationship?
946926887405723648 2017-12-29 02:12:17 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Or when people are like "well I can't leave them because _(insert bullshit lie here)_" like no you can but you don't want to admit to your actions.
946926608266301440 2017-12-29 02:11:11 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Then you sit there, say "I love you." But do it over and over again. Like if that isn't one of the most fucked up things to do to someone, idk wtf is.
946926323380842497 2017-12-29 02:10:03 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> On some real shit, I will never understand how someone can cheat on their significant other. If you aren't happy with them, end it. But don't make them wonder why they weren't enough for you, make them wonder what they could've done for you to stay FAITHFUL.
946925211080732672 2017-12-29 02:05:37 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> We all know you're a piece of shit individual, it's time you come to terms with it as well.pic.twitter.com/4Cm8ka8Zlk

931024598065229826 2017-11-15 05:02:16 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Yes, he was just a turtle. But I fucking loved him. That was my Lul dude, he was always excited to see me when I walked up to the tank. But today, as I held his tiny lifeless body in my hand... a piece of me broke.
931024171814985728 2017-11-15 05:00:34 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I'm hoping I get to adopt Gunther bc that's the only thing that will fix my broken heart rn. 
931023758931869696 2017-11-15 04:58:56 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I hate when I'm just chillin in the dark & my family comes & turns on EVERY fucking light.

931000041828786176 2017-11-15 03:24:41 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Today my dad was like "I'll get you another turtle, but you aren't getting a dog." But little does he know I'm fucking bringing Gunther home. If I'm eligible to adopt him!
930999809196015616 2017-11-15 03:23:46 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Gunther isn't up for adoption until Friday & there's already a list of people trying to adopt him. 
930965609843539968 2017-11-15 01:07:52 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I asked my mom why she turned the lights on and she was like "cause the rest of us aren't mourning." & I legit started crying again.

930964808899235840 2017-11-15 01:04:41 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> But the only thing I've pictured myself actually doing is writing. So I'm pretty fucking sure I just changed my major to English. 
930964578237685760 2017-11-15 01:03:46 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> If I'm being honest, I never really wanted to major in business. Like yeah the idea of having something to back on is great & having that insight to my own business is great too.
930961074462978048 2017-11-15 00:49:51 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I have until Friday to sign up for winter classes. Only to find out I have a shit ton of classes to take this year for my major so I may have to change it. & my turtle passed away today, so yeah that's how my day is going.

906533582021189633 2017-09-09 15:03:43 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Do not play with my emotions!! https://twitter.com/netflixlifee/status/906300703907426305

906326590983827456 2017-09-08 01:21:12 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Like do not show up and say hello to select few. You say hello to EVERYONE regardless of whether you like them or not.
906326419407433728 2017-09-08 01:20:31 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> The people out here don't know how to come in and say hello to everyone. That is some disrespectful ass shit.

905430759413956608 2017-09-06 14:01:29 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> @Mixedhoneyy Idk if there are protests in Seattle but I'm too far to participate anyway. 
905430080440041473 2017-09-06 13:58:47 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Taking over the duties of my mother means I have to go grocery shopping

905429342678695936 2017-09-06 13:55:52 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> If I could, if protest every chance I got.
905429305492029440 2017-09-06 13:55:43 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Protesting makes you feel alive and makes you feel like you're helping to try and make a difference.
905429120724508673 2017-09-06 13:54:59 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> In Chicago, it was a fucking 40 minute train ride and boom I'm center of the protests.
905428979917529088 2017-09-06 13:54:25 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Seattle is 4 fucking hours away and I don't have a car, so I feel like I'm not making a difference sitting here in Moses.
905428862770614277 2017-09-06 13:53:57 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I hate missing all the protests in Chicago.

905139731863703553 2017-09-05 18:45:03 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> But sending many prayers to my family over there being affected by hurricane Irma. And everyone being affected by both Hurricanes.
905139419480440833 2017-09-05 18:43:48 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> But unfortunately I don't know Spanish  and I have the attention span of a jelly bean so I can't teach myself either. 
905139248726032386 2017-09-05 18:43:08 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Life would be easier if I could communicate with my family in PR.

846569368041541633 2017-03-27 03:47:20 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Being sick and barely able to breathe makes me sound like Bane. Or Darth Vader.

846568206655504384 2017-03-27 03:42:43 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> This woman I have on SC sends me pictures of her app that says how many steps she took today. And I honestly couldn't give two shits.

846031176045383681 2017-03-26 16:08:45 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Plan for today: suffer in bed while watching one tree hill. 
845866666852528129 2017-03-25 05:15:03 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> One tree hill gives me life even though I've watched it a million times.

823256564068925440 2017-01-22 19:50:34 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I understand the "respect your elders," but it's fucking bullshit because why should be be obligated to do so when they don't give respect?

823247566896820225 2017-01-22 19:14:49 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> THIS EPISODE GOT ME DEEP IN THE FEELS 
823238350425321472 2017-01-22 18:38:12 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Yesterday I finally realized the only time men shut up is when they hear what they want to hear. 
823232289681408001 2017-01-22 18:14:07 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I really want to watch perks 
823227540257046528 2017-01-22 17:55:15 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Nah instead I went to protest for the rights Im entitled to as a woman. But my parents dont see that. They see me leaving w/o permission. 
823226569460224000 2017-01-22 17:51:23 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I just don't see the big deal tbh. It's not like I went on a bender and didn't come home for 24 hours. Nor did I go out & get arrested.
823226235107110912 2017-01-22 17:50:03 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Update: my dad still isn't talking to me.

823015337868349441 2017-01-21 03:52:02 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Biggie won't sleep for shit 
822996306306203648 2017-01-21 02:36:24 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Someone come get they mans.
822989315789770752 2017-01-21 02:08:37 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I fucking HATE when adults belittle me.
822947520800296961 2017-01-21 23:22:33 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> They let me leave and go babysit 
822941375637450753 2017-01-21 22:58:08 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> The only reason my mom isn't mad at me is because my grandpa convinced her it was okay lol
822941265486561280 2017-01-21 22:57:41 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Update: I'm alive. My dad won't talk to me, and my mom could care less about what I did. 
822929672795209728 2017-01-21 22:11:37 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> "We will not go from a nation of immigrants to a nation of ignorance." America Ferreras speech is fucking great 
822910527068393472 2017-01-21 20:55:33 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Just got home, wish me luck. 
822895922292080643 2017-01-21 19:57:31 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> BUT in the end, going to the women's march was worth it. And I'd do it again to fight for what I believe in. 
822895803450724352 2017-01-21 19:57:02 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I'm in so much fucking trouble. I already know the minute I walk through that door, all hell is gonna break loose. 
822894581247332353 2017-01-21 19:52:11 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> If y'all don't hear from me for awhile it's bc my parents went psycho. 
822894045450170372 2017-01-21 19:50:03 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I'm terrified to go home

822852879702749184 2017-01-21 17:06:29 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Trying to make my way from Congress Parkway to Jackson & Colombus has been a challenge that I've given up on. 
822832918372450304 2017-01-21 15:47:09 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> @ceece18 lmfao thanks Cynthia, you're clutch. 
822831979565641728 2017-01-21 15:43:26 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Update: my mom told my dad & now I'm in a world of trouble. 
822824392593965059 2017-01-21 15:13:17 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> So I left my house before my mom woke up, and she just texted me. So I just want y'all to know, you're more than welcome at my funeral. 
822802682704490496 2017-01-21 13:47:01 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> You know what? I'm gonna do it anyway. And if I get in trouble, so be it.
822795494632071168 2017-01-21 13:18:27 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I'm really upset that he didn't tell me all that yesterday bc then I would've made a poster & said fuck it & would be headed to the city rn.
822795328759984130 2017-01-21 13:17:47 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I should still be sleeping tho. Lol
822794620820226048 2017-01-21 13:14:59 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Don't. Like he told me "I told your mom to let you go. If you still lived with me, I would've drove you."  My papa everyone.

796404800359383045 2016-11-09 17:31:15 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Like holy fuck, this is basic politics people!
796404711524093958 2016-11-09 17:30:54 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Secondly, you cannot simply "get rid" of the electoral college, that shit has to become a constitutional amendment.
796404190918672385 2016-11-09 17:28:50 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Either fucking way, a Republican is in office and we are all fucked.
796404111923101696 2016-11-09 17:28:31 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> If you assassinate Trump, the Vice President becomes the next successor. And if the VP is assassinated, its the speaker of the house.
796403922806116353 2016-11-09 17:27:46 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I keep seeing all of these posts about assassinating Trump, and getting rid of the electoral college. Its not that easy.
796401347192983552 2016-11-09 17:17:32 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> The Cubs got rid of the goat and released it upon our nation. lmfao
796401226309140481 2016-11-09 17:17:03 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> When you see Arrietas comment and feel disgusted but then you remember that Theo Epstein is a Trump Supporter also.
796389747019091969 2016-11-09 16:31:26 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Since our new president doesn't pay taxes, does that mean we don't have to either? 
796382542345682945 2016-11-09 16:02:48 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> TBH I was too busy checking the TT's that I have no clue what is happening in class now.
796382050299375616 2016-11-09 16:00:51 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Professor Valerie is my favorite.

796381526527094785 2016-11-09 15:58:46 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Im so disgusted with the country I live in. But not the state bc Illinois was with Hillary.
796381121143537664 2016-11-09 15:57:09 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> You know that we fucked up this presidential election when there are people crying in fear of what will come next.
796380932307644416 2016-11-09 15:56:24 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> This conversation in my first class is getting real asf.
796380806549749761 2016-11-09 15:55:54 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> "Racist people would keep racism to themselves bc it wasnt socially acceptable.But now that we have a racist president,they think its okay."
796367192732401665 2016-11-09 15:01:49 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> If Trump was able to become president without any experience, I should be able to become a doctor or a pilot without any experience.
796365014802305026 2016-11-09 14:53:09 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> @lil_one1214 you and me both. This world is so fucked up.

796319981915013124 2016-11-09 11:54:13 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I have never felt so betrayed by my country than i do right now.
796319873538342912 2016-11-09 11:53:47 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> These people have voted against women, race, LGBTQ, and a ton of other things. I cannot believe this.

796191865594904576 2016-11-08 03:25:07 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> "I believe there's a heaven, but not a hell. I believe we're living in hell." & tbh with this election, that's what it seems like. 
796191433451597828 2016-11-08 03:23:24 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> The other day my grandma and I were talking about heaven and hell and she said...

791864263644098560 2016-10-27 04:48:47 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> @verdi_desy why'd you @ me?

791863042761895936 2016-10-27 04:43:56 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I got up to get cereal, and I kinda wish I had made real food instead of cereal. 
791862942383824896 2016-10-27 04:43:32 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> @ceece18 I'll take you soon!

791787145585360897 2016-10-27 23:42:20 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I grabbed my shoes to leave, and my grandpa was like "your mom caught you here?" 
791780550918955008 2016-10-27 23:16:08 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I think I'm getting sick

791402079105519616 2016-10-26 22:12:13 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Really pissed my nap didn't work out.
791401556964966400 2016-10-26 22:10:09 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I need a job. 
791401493064720385 2016-10-26 22:09:54 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Dude I really need to get out there  my life is so boring 
791401334377512960 2016-10-26 22:09:16 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I can't tell if that hurt to hear or if I don't give a fuck anymore. 
791382379071959040 2016-10-26 20:53:57 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> My grandpa just asked if I had a wig on. 
791372294945902592 2016-10-26 20:13:52 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Guys I finally got to see Anthony

791297645415374853 2016-10-26 15:17:14 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I want to go on tumblr but thats not the best idea. lmfao
791283658300727296 2016-10-26 14:21:40 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I was in such a good mood and wide awake before I walked into class, but now Im ready to knock tf out.
791281052497174532 2016-10-26 14:11:18 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Trying so hard not to fall asleep.
791276813972598784 2016-10-26 13:54:28 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> My Wednesday classes are literally so fucking pointless.
791276717402890240 2016-10-26 13:54:05 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I'd rather be sleeping.
791276022641618944 2016-10-26 13:51:19 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> No one wants to hear your shitty music this early in the morning.
791246573007171584 2016-10-26 11:54:18 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I would do my hair on a day it's raining 
790957198297956352 2016-10-25 16:44:26 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I fucking hate getting stuck by a train when I have somewhere to be.
790952112846991360 2016-10-25 16:24:13 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> What can I say? It's complicated.
790934537996034048 2016-10-25 15:14:23 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> IN LOVE WITH MY HAIR 
790909616293089280 2016-10-25 13:35:21 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> It's been forever since I've babysat a newborn, and I'm kinda nervous. But I think I got this. 
790909516955193344 2016-10-25 13:34:57 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Wish me luck today, I have to babysit a newborn. 
790903011350605824 2016-10-25 13:09:06 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Appointment at 9 & then babysitting for the rest of the day. 
790902914281775104 2016-10-25 13:08:43 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I really don't want to get up.
790902229955911680 2016-10-25 13:06:00 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I turned my fan and air conditioner on last night. 
790901301517422592 2016-10-25 13:02:19 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I'd rather it be cold than hot.
790785714673901568 2016-10-24 05:23:01 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> You're my kind of perfect.
790784527564148736 2016-10-24 05:18:18 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Y'all ever get too lazy to create a new contact so you just force yourself to remember who 704 is? 
790783126435946496 2016-10-24 05:12:44 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> My family turned the heat on, and now it's hotter than satans testicles in here. 
790783017560203264 2016-10-24 05:12:18 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> IF THIS AINT ME.pic.twitter.com/UmTzGApQRJ
790655423196069888 2016-10-24 20:45:17 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I could go for a banana milkshake from Gayteys and a deep conversation.
790655146439106564 2016-10-24 20:44:11 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Kinda wanna go to the beach tonight and just sit on the sand wrapped in a blanket just thinking.
790654876166545409 2016-10-24 20:43:06 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I miss Anthony 
790652884216123392 2016-10-24 20:35:11 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I'm happy for you, I swear that I am.
790652842289815556 2016-10-24 20:35:01 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I wish I could mean this but here's my goodbye.
790652659518869504 2016-10-24 20:34:18 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Stone cold, stone cold.
790652585631973377 2016-10-24 20:34:00 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I was your Amber but now she's your shade of cold.
790652351162048516 2016-10-24 20:33:04 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> God knows I've tried to feel happy for you.
790652309667708928 2016-10-24 20:32:54 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Maybe if I don't cry, I won't feel anymore.
790652062568706048 2016-10-24 20:31:55 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I've been sitting here for an hour staring at my laptop which isn't even on. 
790629548287229952 2016-10-24 19:02:28 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Someone buy me a banana shake from Gayteys.
790627977390358528 2016-10-24 18:56:13 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> He's so fine 
790613939738517504 2016-10-24 18:00:26 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I hope I can get a new tattoo for my birthday.
790567101949939712 2016-10-24 14:54:19 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> @NoChillsZone @highlyobnoxious lmfao 
790535455859154944 2016-10-24 12:48:34 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> "Save your money and come home."  I miss my MLW fam. 
790530843869605888 2016-10-24 12:30:15 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I think I'm gonna get off at van buren & take an adventure before class. 
790530550276689920 2016-10-24 12:29:05 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Note to self: stop leaving inhaler at home.
790530483520024578 2016-10-24 12:28:49 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> My chest hurts 
790528955623366656 2016-10-24 12:22:44 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I don't have water or Chapstick either and my lips are so dry omfg.
790528513099046912 2016-10-24 12:20:59 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Had to run to the train and I don't have my inhaler. 
790522441449762816 2016-10-24 11:56:51 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I'm. So. Tired.
790522297627074560 2016-10-24 11:56:17 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Midterm week. 
790521615931084800 2016-10-24 11:53:35 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Kinda wish I had put on a beanie. 
790517853799714816 2016-10-24 11:38:38 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__>  I wanna love ya and treat you right.
790515112729804800 2016-10-24 11:27:44 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Love is louder.
790514097049722880 2016-10-24 11:23:42 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I swear every time I get up for school I feel so sad bc sleeping is so amazing.
790399482554937344 2016-10-23 03:48:16 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> you can have everything you've ever dreamed of, but that doesn't mean your mental health comes last.
790397571328073728 2016-10-23 03:40:40 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> You deserve to be happy.
790397164262416385 2016-10-23 03:39:03 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Okay, I guess Ima try and sleep.
790397079973683200 2016-10-23 03:38:43 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> But maybe that time will come when I believe it myself.
790397016069275650 2016-10-23 03:38:28 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I need someone to just hold me and make me feel as if I am a great person who doesn't deserve to be taken for granted.
790396721092259844 2016-10-23 03:37:17 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> But no matter what, no one will have as big of a heart as other people. And for that, I can't blame anyone.
790396612384264193 2016-10-23 03:36:51 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I'd appreciate it if someone genuinely meant it when they say they'd treat me one way or prove how much I matter to them.
790396446235299841 2016-10-23 03:36:12 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I don't know if you can say I'm a good friend or if I'm just easily persuaded. But damn does this really get tiring.
790396300374278145 2016-10-23 03:35:37 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Sometimes I sit there and think that I deserve so much better, and shouldn't let people belittle me. But no matter what I always go back.
790396178466795520 2016-10-23 03:35:08 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> You can be there through hell or high water but they don't see that. They only remember when you were gone.
790396006995197952 2016-10-23 03:34:27 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> It just irks my soul that no matter how much time and effort you put into someone, they will always point out when you weren't there.
790395832797396992 2016-10-23 03:33:46 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Do you ever try to get back to the way things use to be with someone, but no matter how hard you try it will never be the same?
790389550044643328 2016-10-23 03:08:48 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I could go for a banana shake from Gayteys.
790389394419093504 2016-10-23 03:08:11 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> That just pissed me off.
790389365860073472 2016-10-23 03:08:04 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> What the fuckery?!
790358041371836420 2016-10-23 01:03:35 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> *tries to download the abc app to watch season 13*
790356786645786624 2016-10-23 00:58:36 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I kinda want to put on my prom dress....

790340703989608450 2016-10-23 23:54:42 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> It feels so much later than 7 o'clock.
790324636978380800 2016-10-23 22:50:51 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Why are you so worried about what I do? Worry about your damn self.
790315143460683776 2016-10-23 22:13:08 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> "Who's smoking in your car? Why was the window down?" 
790315060916813829 2016-10-23 22:12:48 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> "Who ate all those cupcakes?" 
790301433253990400 2016-10-23 21:18:39 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> But I don't wanna make it from scratch

790301246775259138 2016-10-23 21:17:54 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Someone bring me chocolate cake mix so I can bake a cake. 
790282542800855040 2016-10-23 20:03:35 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> "It's harder to love somebody than to walk away from them."
790271524011900928 2016-10-23 19:19:48 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> "I ain't bout to sleep on my dreams for no man!"  Cardi B

774040363598249984 2016-09-08 00:22:58 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> You can add "so suck a dick" to anything and it flows.
774040258786783232 2016-09-08 00:22:33 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Sometimes I lay in bed with no pants on, so suck a dick.
774038626057322496 2016-09-08 00:16:04 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Even tho I've texted multiple times, but if you don't have time for me I don't have time for you.

743641231503171584 2016-06-16 03:07:40 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> And Bennett, or complaining to Walton that I didn't get enough sleep the night before.

739101026633015297 2016-06-04 14:26:31 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> The fact that after I graduate I won't be headed to MLW really upsets me.
739100156960870400 2016-06-04 14:23:03 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I'd rather be in Moses on an adventure than stuck here in boring old Chicago.

738814421745573888 2016-06-03 19:27:39 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I hate speaking in front of the class 
738785016260485120 2016-06-03 17:30:48 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Justin's emojis are 3 fucking dollars 
738784680951066624 2016-06-03 17:29:28 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I love to write, but not on specific topics.  I get so bored doing that.
738767963164135425 2016-06-03 16:23:02 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> *goals all Carmel instead of blonde*
738767163356532740 2016-06-03 16:19:52 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> The struggle is real when your hair dresser refuses to dye your hair a specific color but that's all you want.

738566775495872512 2016-06-02 03:03:35 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I've taken three breaks just during my introduction. 
738566592771067906 2016-06-02 03:02:52 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I want to watch grease.
738565032297017344 2016-06-02 02:56:40 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> *scrolls through all social media when I should be writing*
738562411427434497 2016-06-02 02:46:15 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Reason number 876 on why I hate myself: I procrastinate waaaaay too much.
738557931625517056 2016-06-02 02:28:27 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> MY LAPTOP WOULD CHOOSE TO RUN SLOW WHEN I HAVE A 7 PAGE PAPER TO WRITE. 
738552165527113732 2016-06-02 02:05:32 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Plan for this evening: Write a 7 page English paper and pray I get at least 2 hours of sleep.
738455654009085952 2016-06-02 19:42:02 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> And tomorrow, and Saturday, and Sunday. 
738455574589870080 2016-06-02 19:41:43 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I really want to go home and sleep, but I have to be an adult today. 
738443308503031808 2016-06-02 18:52:59 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> "The only thought that crossed my mind was: Thank god I ate that mint." 
738398987741503489 2016-06-02 15:56:52 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I'd much rather be at home in my nice cold room in bed, rather than in the hot and musty ass school. 
738366703898398720 2016-06-02 13:48:35 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I'm exhausted.

738207539494555648 2016-06-01 03:16:07 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Rather than overthinking. 
738207490198896640 2016-06-01 03:15:55 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I should be sleeping.
738207429821894656 2016-06-01 03:15:41 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Like it shouldn't still bother me.
738207379465109504 2016-06-01 03:15:29 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> The fact that I still think about everything that happened really pisses me off.

737419413486460928 2016-05-30 23:04:23 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Nothing annoys me more than when people don't ask me permission to show or tell that asshole things about me.

734229703058284544 2016-05-21 03:49:37 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> And she was still awake, talking about what movie we would watch next or what I would want for breakfast.
734229503388483585 2016-05-21 03:48:49 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> The last time I spent the night here, everything was okay. He was sleeping down the hall, his snoring filling the hallways.
734229269325324288 2016-05-21 03:47:53 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Something about laying here in this house with no sound to fill the void, has me feeling far from at ease.

714855420251258881 2016-03-29 16:43:08 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Yet they're keeping a cure from people who deserve to be saved.
714855300868808704 2016-03-29 16:42:39 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I've watched my grandpa die of cancer, I'm watching my grandma go through the same, and also my moms friends mom.

714263367670566915 2016-03-27 01:30:31 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I see that as if all of a sudden one day you don't love someone, then you never have loved that someone.
714263232278474753 2016-03-27 01:29:59 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I don't believe in that whole "we've been together forever and now all of a sudden I don't love you."

712842811368845312 2016-03-23 03:25:44 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> My poor great grandma has lost all of her hair due to chemo, and she thinks she's ugly. But I swear she is so beautiful and strong.

712663419992690688 2016-03-23 15:32:54 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> The fact that she's still in my group pisses me off 
712663365114408961 2016-03-23 15:32:41 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> So fucking fed up with her shit.

712469982471270401 2016-03-22 02:44:15 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I want to have a Fast & Furious movie night bc I've only ever seen Tokyo Drift. Lol
712466745655566337 2016-03-22 02:31:23 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I still have hope that one day by chance I will somehow meet him, but for now if this is what's best then so be it.
712466483213836288 2016-03-22 02:30:21 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> But I see it as if it's better for Justin, emotionally, mentally, and physically, then it's what needed to happen.
712466354859683840 2016-03-22 02:29:50 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> It really does suck that the beliebers that never got the opportunity to meet Justin, now won't be able to....
712463058266816513 2016-03-22 02:16:44 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> @justinbieber your mental health and wellbeing is way more important than the M&Gs. We love you no matter what. 
712462915786256384 2016-03-22 02:16:10 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> You can't say "he didn't show signs that he was depressed," seriously? Look at the old M&G pictures, & some of us hide it better than others
712462749092065280 2016-03-22 02:15:30 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Yes the cancelling of M&Gs sucks, but his mental health is more important.

697615255233552385 2016-02-10 02:56:52 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> When your friends volunteer you to cook for squad dinner 
697614984646434817 2016-02-10 02:55:48 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> If I had the stuff here to make lasagna, that'd be dinner tomorrow. Lol

697614600599158784 2016-02-10 02:54:16 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I wanted to go zip lining but my grandpa says he refuses to let me go do that and end up sick 
697614470537998336 2016-02-10 02:53:45 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Plans for this weekend consist of staying home and doing nothing 
697613746898862086 2016-02-10 02:50:52 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> So tempted to make it... Soon. Hopefully. Lol

697497849433624576 2016-02-10 19:10:20 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> Seattle is calling my name...
697475014547873793 2016-02-10 17:39:36 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> When people continuously mention that they smoke weed  like we get it, no need to mention it ALL THE FUCKING TIME.
697463290117672962 2016-02-10 16:53:01 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I want to go home. 
697432248707112960 2016-02-10 14:49:40 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> I'm tired and my body hurts.

697288419198820352 2016-02-09 05:18:08 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> My aunt told me to tell my papa she'd be back later, which I did, and he accused me of lying to him saying I did know where she was. 
697287232957345792 2016-02-09 05:13:25 UTC <HeyyItsJayy__> WHEN THEY PUT ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR FIGHTS
