969425122250539008 2018-03-01 04:12:14 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump What did they tell U 2 say & do? They R your masters; U R in their hip pocket. Whatever NRA wants right like the Mob U cant say no, or else.
969360447693471744 2018-03-01 23:55:15 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump He uses news that suits him; everything else that doesnt he calls fake news- like a child he is- a spoiled rotten child who always had to get his way a big 71 yr old baby

969214386580549633 2018-03-01 14:14:51 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump It's sad 2 have a president so hated by most americans, like the warriors, good guys who couldn't even stomach the thought of meeting with such a corrupt,vile  despicable human being.Our country is at low point until this pres & all repugnacans R removed #comeonmuellerdoyourjob
968954112493551617 2018-02-28 21:00:37 UTC <rbnewark> trump ruining this great country, makes everyone ashamed 2B American, represented by an evil orange clown, the laughingstock of the world- listen to Tom Steyer, and lets #impeach sooner or later #upcomingmuellerindictmentsoftrump
968843319676616704 2018-02-28 13:40:22 UTC <rbnewark> Boycott stores that still sell assault weapons. Hurt them where it counts in the pocketbook.
968842388490735616 2018-02-28 13:36:40 UTC <rbnewark> Kudos to Dick's, refusing to sell assault weapons. They have a conscience unlike the NRA. Gun nutjobs will attack Dick's 4 their courageous stand. Time for Congress 2 step up and ban assault weapons.
968840521333358594 2018-02-28 13:29:15 UTC <rbnewark> Tom Steyers newest commercial a big hit, hopefully will shake some loose fruit from the tree. Makes a compelling argument for trump's impeachment. Be sure to sign up to support the presidents impeachment
968707769980170240 2018-02-27 04:41:44 UTC <rbnewark> Disgraceful the president is so bad that most athletes cant even stomach shaking his hand and meeting him in person. Warriors turn their back on the president & deserveably so. It used to be an honor until this scoundrel sullied the office- sad
968633916188839936 2018-02-27 23:48:16 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump All consumers eagerly anticipating Impeachment proceedings 2 begin soon, and looking to buy a lot of party supplies 4 the huge celebration to follow- its going to be way way bigger than your puny inauguration!!! #lockhimup

968632691401801729 2018-02-27 23:43:24 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Correction. the opposite is true, so if U want to make America good again, don't vote 4 anyone the evil orange clown supports, and U should B OK.
967818591344078848 2018-02-25 17:48:28 UTC <rbnewark> trump says he's innocent. Based on his record of truth telling, do U believe him? of course not. Prisons R full of people who claim their innocence 2 all who listen- trouble is they broke the law & were proven to have done so by a court of LAW, OF WHICH TRUMP HAS NO RESPECT.
967814341952118784 2018-02-25 17:31:34 UTC <rbnewark> donnie is a dngerous idiot. CPAC seems 2 B a whole organization of dangerous idiots, like the NRA. I'm guessing there's about a 99% overlap between the two groups. This is how dangerous idiots get elected, by other dangerous idiots. The antidote 2 this scourge?Florida HS students
967809397622636545 2018-02-25 17:11:56 UTC <rbnewark> @CarolLaRue @BillMendocino My dad is deceased.  That's why they sent it to me.
967623462737997824 2018-02-24 04:53:05 UTC <rbnewark> Got a letter honoring my dad for his military service, but unfortunately it wasnt signed by a legit pres. it was signed by a fornicator, a liar, a cheater, a traitor, a phony, a fraud- takes a way from the honor doesnt it, kind of a dishonorablely honor,
967621374553370624 2018-02-24 04:44:47 UTC <rbnewark> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump U probably shouldnt look in the mirror when say that stuff, youre confusing an honorable man like shiff with yourself, who is truly shifty, shiftless, and ashithole to boot!

967451850764005377 2018-02-24 17:31:10 UTC <rbnewark> Billy Graham and Donald Trump R exact opposites- Graham a man who lived a virtuous life guided by his religious beliefs. Trump is virtueless; consistently given in 2 vices; pride, lust, anger, greed, etc
967451009017462784 2018-02-24 17:27:49 UTC <rbnewark> Billy Graham- an American icon, a holy man, lived the Gospel message, surely now with his heavenly Savior
967450538018160640 2018-02-24 17:25:57 UTC <rbnewark> so proud of the kids from parkland, only ones in shithole of a state have the courage 2 speak out 4 needed common sense gun control, rest cower in the face of that lady & the NRA #rubio #scott #floridalegis #trump

967449235137294336 2018-02-24 17:20:46 UTC <rbnewark> Kudos 2 Delta & United 4 ending relationship with NRA, suffer from the vindictive right, but most Americans applaud this-Where R the rest of the cowards? Should have a patch B4 buying a product "NRA free" similar 2 pesticide free
967447296429277184 2018-02-24 17:13:04 UTC <rbnewark> Better security definitely needed in schools 2 monitor entry,get rid of assault weapons-no need 4 them,dont let people convicted of violent crimes get any gun, oh yea, time to shut down NRA clowns-they will never learn or change until their kids R killed- may be not even then
967446230790946816 2018-02-24 17:08:50 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump One of the stupidest ideas I've ever heard- arm teachers. Impractical, fear-mongering, coming at problem from wrong end. We have teachers from 25-75, most of them w no exper w guns, would add 2 tension in room where there R rowdy students, would B wrong 2  use U have a weapon
967045447960248321 2018-02-23 14:36:16 UTC <rbnewark> Great mentally ill people wont be able to get guns! That means everyone at CPAC, all NRA members, the president, people who work at Fox news, all republicans will not B allowed to own guns based on this!
966957190698303489 2018-02-23 08:45:34 UTC <rbnewark> So impressed by the courage of the Florida kids to not let go of this issue, their righteous anger, to not let America forget until change happens.

966955721022582789 2018-02-23 08:39:43 UTC <rbnewark> trump threatens 2 taking away the domestic terrorist group ICES?! yippee! Please do! We don't want the gestapo in our state. They commit more crimes against humanity than 99% of the immigrants. I'll take my chances with an immigrant any day over ICES. #longlivesanctuarystates
966954604385648641 2018-02-23 08:35:17 UTC <rbnewark> Much of our country is mentally ill 2 allow AK 47 in the hands of civilians. noone in their right mind would need or want a weapon like this unless they R interested in killing large numbers of people rambo style. what else would U have them 4 Time to trun off the NRA #neverNRA
966953551623696384 2018-02-23 08:31:06 UTC <rbnewark> Wacko neocons like NRAers taking shots at the kids from Florida shootings. How low can U go. there is no bottom 4 NRA & like minded domestic terrorists that R basically OK with some collateral damage like Parkland so that every nutjob in america has right 2 buy military weapons
966926968242319361 2018-02-22 06:45:28 UTC <rbnewark> Clippers look good, should contend for a playoff spot, even after losing two superstars; Warriors better- Clips made some lucky shots down the stretch to make it look closer than it was, but Warriors always in control of the game. Needed all 44 from Curry to win. Off night=loss
965795130983702528 2018-02-19 03:47:57 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump But what about the big dickhead asshole in the WH, what R we going 2 do about that?! hopefully Mueller will finish the job; we're all gleefully waiting 4 the other shoe 2 drop, hopefully a big boot 2 the ass & U gone! See ya, wouldnt wanta ta be ya! #lockhimup
965794206647070720 2018-02-19 03:44:17 UTC <rbnewark> Right wing bot war against Franken successfully duped dems into stamrolling him without due process, not so much as a hearing- shameful that dems proving to be as stupid as republican acting like lemmings acting and speaking without thinking same thing as with hillary #whosnext
965792823449538561 2018-02-19 03:38:47 UTC <rbnewark> @SaysHummingbird Hoping donnie has a not Happy Not a real Presidents Day 2 our fake illegit president He represents the worst of us, our lowest common denominator, appeals to our lesser angels- good chance he's the anti christ, never heard of anyone as intrinsically evil as trump except hitler
965791604844871685 2018-02-19 03:33:56 UTC <rbnewark> @SaysHummingbird Beautiful. Royals got it right. Who would want the evil orange clown and his white trash flunkies at their wedding?! I'd even the Animal Kingdom have more cache than the trumps in my book. They R both the scum of the earth, but the trumps worse.
965706106335932416 2018-02-19 21:54:12 UTC <rbnewark> Hopefully these souls 17 will not have died in vain,their families & friends hve not suffered 4 nothing;that weve reached a tipping point where even asshole republicans get the message & pass common sense gun control 2 prevent more tragedy #hundredthmonkey #neverNRA #votedem

965664752243392512 2018-02-19 19:09:52 UTC <rbnewark> Were all waiting 4 the other shoe, hopefully a big giant boot, right on the head of donnie; a cheater, liar, a philanderer, a racist, a bully his whole life, and nobody changes all of a sudden at 72- hopefully he'll spending his remaining days in prison where he belongs
965650732396326912 2018-02-19 18:14:10 UTC <rbnewark> @SaysHummingbird Once a cheater alwys a cheater; thats how many of the 1%ers roll, thinking they dont need to follow the rules;but Y do so many people admire this type of attitude is what's beyond me; R there that many deplorable people in US? sad
965649802447826944 2018-02-19 18:10:28 UTC <rbnewark> @joncoopertweets Love it! I wonder Y more insane tweets than usual this weeknd about 5 times as many, even off the deep end for him
965649347474948096 2018-02-19 18:08:39 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Too bad we dont hve a real president, hope by next presidents day youre gone so we can have a real pres, fairly and freely elected by Americans not Russian bots- only reason U won is bc of Russia- Americans of their own device would never elect an evil orange clown such a U
965647994623213568 2018-02-19 18:03:17 UTC <rbnewark> Do U know how many common sense gun laws the republicans have blocked over the yrs Bc they R dependent on NRA money like a junkie is dependent on their next fix; but a junkie is only hurting himself, not putting the lives of school children at unnecessary risk 4 their own greed
965419512974618624 2018-02-18 02:55:23 UTC <rbnewark> its a shame when high school kids R shaming grown men that cant do what they need to protect them bc they're beholding to the NRA 4 financial assistance NRA pulls the strings republicans cower #puppets #neverNRA #votethebumsout #spinelesswonders #repugnacans

964978017561751552 2018-02-17 21:41:02 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Funny how fake fox news never gives us the truth about anything- that you're a serial sexual abuser/philanderer Y don't they give those women "due process"? That U colluded w russians- only way an incompetent, unstable evil orange clown llike U could ever win- only by cheating

964895499101782016 2018-02-17 16:13:08 UTC <rbnewark> The silence of Fox is deafening- nothing on trumps affairs; canu imagine if it was a dem that did what trump has done?! Fair & balanced? what a joke! #lockhimup

960184630837067776 2018-02-04 16:13:50 UTC <rbnewark> NFL is really suffering from protestors, and trumps negative comments- NOT!. The country basically does the opposite of what trump says- He represents everything most Americans don't approve of- greed,avarice, disregard for laws and rules,bullying,sexual abuse, the list goes on.
960183690666979334 2018-02-04 16:10:05 UTC <rbnewark> ...ICE will then B turned against the rest of us; dems, protestors, Constitutionalists if trump does something obviously against the Constitution like fire Mueller

959949991241400321 2018-02-03 00:41:27 UTC <rbnewark> @RepJoeKennedy congress has been basically sitting on their hands this whole year & is complicit at a minimum to trmpist policies, both repugnacans & Democrats
959949215106416640 2018-02-03 00:38:22 UTC <rbnewark> @Bigchief201 @ProudResister The right wing media is way worse than then- it was practically nonexistent, but they continue to play into people's hate, fear and biases and they lap it up. to my mind it's their influence that has created these irrational, small-minded scapegoating views of American issues
959948231680471040 2018-02-03 00:34:28 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump how about the stock market crash-U & your stupid memo can take some credit 4 that- the market reads writing on the wall- noose is tightening youll B in jail B4 long & then you'll not only see muslims dancing in the streets,but all decent folks-it'll B a holiday #wickedwitchisdead
959946967882215424 2018-02-03 00:29:26 UTC <rbnewark> trumps now appears 2B a dead duck- they can release all the spurious memos they want- this one has nothing in it except a smokescreen to deflect from the real crimes going on that R now encircling donnie #guiltyassin
959946383800262656 2018-02-03 00:27:07 UTC <rbnewark> Obstruction widening 2 include nunes, other members of the committee that wrecklessly voted to release top secret intel, possibly hannity & others who seem 2B all in on this conspiracy to obstruct justice, & if they knew the memo has purposeful bias to discredit the investigation
959945656700829697 2018-02-03 00:24:14 UTC <rbnewark> reps also sponsored Steele Dossier into trumps peeing on Obama's bed, & all sorts of other activities that have since been verified. Doesn't matter who it came from, only if it's from a credible source, & credible evidence, & in both cases the answer has been a resounding yes
959911227412570112 2018-02-03 22:07:25 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump U mean Rasputin don't U? who is rasmussen? Is this from the National Enquirer,& does it include Aliens in the polls?Certainly there aren't 49% brain dead Americans who could possibly think youre doing a good job-I doubt if even 49% of your cabinet approve of you.Maybe family?
959909962695634944 2018-02-03 22:02:24 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump If  U mean your admin then yes U R a huge disgrace, U embarrass all of America every hour U R our Pres- it's like having a recurring nightmare; thank God the end is near, & ironically the memo will end up tightening the noose, thank U very much 4 stupidly putting it out this out
959908635068411904 2018-02-03 21:57:07 UTC <rbnewark> Repugnacans all in on obstructing justice, can we have a class action trial and throw all the conspirators in jail? It is a federal crime and I hear there's plenty of room at Gitmo #lockthemup #thankununes4yourstupidmemo
959907576845488128 2018-02-03 21:52:55 UTC <rbnewark> George Washington had it right, knew political parties would ruin America, just as we see happening now. No one agreeing, compromising meeting in the middle $ the common good of the country in an effort to create a more perfect union, only sabotaging, stalemating, obstruction
959906527480967168 2018-02-03 21:48:45 UTC <rbnewark> It's not a crime to B dem, or rep, it's not a job requirement to have voted 4 the pres- it should disqualify U if did vote 4 this corrupt, unstable moron- but it shouldnt matter-it doesn't prejudice evidence if provider thinks pres is dangerous idiot-only merits of evidene matter
959905031020425216 2018-02-03 21:42:48 UTC <rbnewark> Thank U McDonnie the Head Idiot,4 unwittingly providing justice dept w another nail in your coffin-the  highly prejudicial memo is material evidence of obstruction, & along w the creator of this piece of garbage nunes gives U some company in the upcoming trial #conspiracy

Justice triumphs over corruption.America's been attacked B4,now its by our own-repugnacans that R attempting 2 take down America, 2 shape it in their own twisted nihilist vision,but as MLK said We shall overcome
959615397912707072 2018-02-02 02:31:54 UTC <rbnewark> If trump tries to fire everyone who voted against him, wishes to abide by a code of conduct and live up to their oath of office, there would B nobody left in government except the scumbuckets in his cabinet. Almost everyone hates him, except 4 a few greedy morons like himself-
959613858833838087 2018-02-02 02:25:47 UTC <rbnewark> Lets face it, 2 call yourself a repugnacan at this point must feel awful. This party supports so many greedy, hateful antiAmeriican issues and this awful incompetent lying spiteful president, how can they look themselves in the face. #republicanssuck
959610220711329792 2018-02-02 02:11:19 UTC <rbnewark> FBI agents dont have to be repugnacans or democrats. FBI agents' wives don't have to be repugnacan or democrats either. The fact the POTUS asked about their political affiliation is highly irregular, improper, & should not B allowed.
959599088575528960 2018-02-02 01:27:05 UTC <rbnewark> @SethAbramson In normal times he would be censored and probably removed from Congress.
959598070743711744 2018-02-02 01:23:03 UTC <rbnewark> repugnacans at it again- it isnt just trump- its many of them that are corrupted, unethical and complicit with trump crimes- its now a criminal conspiracy including many in the white house & Congress, nunes, kelly and more... #lockthemup
959596906375626753 2018-02-02 01:18:25 UTC <rbnewark> Politically motivated and edited memo without ability to verify opinions is a joke much like president & Nunes
958951197670436864 2018-01-31 06:32:36 UTC <rbnewark> White ignoring rules, separation of poers and laws. Ignore sanctions invite russian spy chiefs to claudestine meetings about what what could U B talking to russian top spies about? arent they sanctioned how did they get in?
958950621129789441 2018-01-31 06:30:19 UTC <rbnewark> @TheJusticeDept @realDonaldTrump @CosmicRodge @tedlieu Highly treacherous

958948729079324672 2018-01-31 06:22:48 UTC <rbnewark> @POTUS @PressSec @tedlieu The whole country hates this evil dangerous man. you've been compared to Tokyo Rose and Hitler's mouthpiece who spewed the party line. U should B ashamed of yourself. Have you no ethics? To repeat, defend and support this monster is deplorable
958947883943788544 2018-01-31 06:19:26 UTC <rbnewark> @DearAuntCrabby Devin news is complicit in the the obstruction case

958915686419451904 2018-01-31 04:11:30 UTC <rbnewark> Donnie demanding loyalty from a law enforcement officer like comey, mccabe, or rosenstein whose loyalty is not to president but to the rule of law & the Constitution. Obvious obstruction.
958913367661359104 2018-01-31 04:02:17 UTC <rbnewark> 3 banned Russian leaders of spy agencies secretly let into US, then sanctions lifted. Is there no end to the scandal the corruption and the complicity with it all of the repugnacans. Theyre all unethical, spineless, scum. Their silence is deafening. Will no one speak up&speak out
958912299061755904 2018-01-31 03:58:02 UTC <rbnewark> repugnacan expediency in the obstruction case brings a number of them criminally involved, like Nunes, Ryan, and others in white house and admin like Hope Hicks. She incriminated herself by saying they- the FBI, would never get ahold of emails about meeting with the russians
958221392519954435 2018-01-29 06:12:37 UTC <rbnewark> lets not forget sanctions against russia dropped today- I guess theyve decided russians were innocent of messing with our election!
958220593752453121 2018-01-29 06:09:27 UTC <rbnewark> @Arriadna @JRubinBlogger Theyre in up to their necks in this 4 some their silence is deafening and others R promoting the trump agenda of obstruction of justice what R they going to do impeach themselves -they R part of the deplorables B4 they so aptly named by Hillary

If somebody knows where they're going 2B so we can warn them a head of time or in some way help the victims of these domestic terrorists.

955660403052171264 2018-01-22 04:36:10 UTC <rbnewark> Repugnacans cynically put out a bill they knew would lose so they could blame dems 4 shutdown.

ICES should B arresting pres & cabinet
955167736061091840 2018-01-21 19:58:29 UTC <rbnewark> ICES not welcome in Cali anymore than ICIS would B they R one in same both terrorist groups- attacking 7-11s?

952209131980578816 2018-01-13 16:02:02 UTC <rbnewark> Talk about pay 4 play. sounds like this is what trump has had to his whole life! Stormy Daniels only tip of iceberg. Has had to pay off 100 women to keep quiet according to Bannon. We know his wives have only been in it 4 the money. #pay4play
951260107194560514 2018-01-10 01:10:57 UTC <rbnewark> ICES attacking American residents working at 7-11!This is a breach of our rights of due process. Do they have probable cause? no! All people of color possible targets of these domestic terrorists.Fat pasty white amoral scum white trash republicans not worried,but everyone else is
951258213848006656 2018-01-10 01:03:26 UTC <rbnewark> ICES is a terrorist organization attacking innocent decent hardworking, taxpaying people of color who work at 7-11.More dangerous than ISIS bc theyre inside our borders, attacking at whim of homeland security-who will be their next victim?not welcome here in Cali sanctuary state
951257194615382016 2018-01-10 00:59:23 UTC <rbnewark> so sad to see the depths the republicans have fallen 2 defend, protect & promote not the Constitution which they R sworn 2 do, but the amoral,serial liar,sexual predator white trash of a president we have
951256518501974016 2018-01-10 00:56:42 UTC <rbnewark> trump has no concept of the first amendment, no concept of the separation of powers, of really how our government works; he's a walking, talking dictator in waiting, if we let him; repugnacans not only sitting on hands, but clapping at his actions/antics disgraceful
951255701988376577 2018-01-10 00:53:27 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump You'll be watching from behind bars by then; the noose is tightening thanks to the courageous Feinstein, the Dossier, the book and the facts #lockhimup cant wait
949166087605690369 2018-01-04 06:30:04 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump All because of Obama! He turned it around for us. Youre just riding his coattails and trying to  take credit for it. Sad
949165744855502848 2018-01-04 06:28:42 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump I would agree to the wall being built 100ft high, but only if they sent you to Mexico! Of course Mexico would never allow an accused rapist like you into their country!
949165258786054144 2018-01-04 06:26:46 UTC <rbnewark> Everyone in America run out to stores and get this one! It's the truth about trump!https://twitter.com/SaysHummingbird/status/949075678737166336
949164058418139136 2018-01-04 06:22:00 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Your Bannon's flunky, and now even he's turned on you! Who's left? a bunch of crooks and syncophants; yes men who are obliged to faun all over you or get fired. You have no concept how our government works. Thank God you'll be gone soon.
949163254273662977 2018-01-04 06:18:49 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Tom Steyer should buy everyone in America a copy of this book to show them what type of president they didn't elect. you are there under false pretenses- lost the popular vote by  whopping 11 million! colluded with Russia to cheat your way to the WH shameful #lockhimup
949162613711167488 2018-01-04 06:16:16 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Everyone in America should have a copy of this book! If I was rich that's what I'd do. Shows us what most of us already know about you, senile, incompetent, irrational, vain to the point of narcissism. Incredibly stupid, in way over your head, a laughing stock, corrupt, a joke!
945153084287696896 2017-12-24 04:43:50 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Happy Holidays asshole! Nobody was ever afraid 2 say Merry Christmas 2 people of good will.Considerate people realize that not everyone is christian,like your own daughter and son-in-law- R sensitive 2 others' beliefs,unlike boorish oafs like yourself who make scrooge look good
943320556161581056 2017-12-19 03:22:01 UTC <rbnewark> senators should not B able 2 vote on legislation that directly benefits them- that would elliminate 13 republican senators right off the bat who R going benefit from this, Y should foreign investors get a tax break over working Americans?! outrageous! #corkerkickback
943319470663131136 2017-12-19 03:17:42 UTC <rbnewark> coopted republican senators line their own pockets w this money-grab-4-rich-guys tax bill how low will they go? not one sticks 2 principles-not corker,not mcCain,not collins,all have $$ signs in their eyes while rest of us pay more! so disappointing deliberate #corkerkickback
943313879538458625 2017-12-19 02:55:29 UTC <rbnewark> I believe good will triumph over evil in the long run, many of trumper republicans will end up in jail, trump & his family as well & justice will prevail in the end-it happens in all the movies & in real life too.Mueller will get his man,trumps been getting away w murder 4 years
943310991151865857 2017-12-19 02:44:00 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump thanks 2 all the spineless corrupt trump flunkie republicans 4 passing the money-grab-4-the-rich tax bill-they get bought out by putting in provisions that benefit them personally & from pressure from their super rich donors what a horrible thing to do 2 us- they will pay dearly
943052913168982016 2017-12-19 09:38:30 UTC <rbnewark> trumps flunkies ready 2 vote themselves a big tax break while the rest of us get thrown a few pennies or even end up paying more.
943051226135928832 2017-12-19 09:31:48 UTC <rbnewark> trumps flunkies look the other way abdicate all their power as a separate branch of government to trump praying 2 strong souls will have the courage 2 vote 4 what is right rather than expedient put country over their own financial interests-biggest benefits go 2 rep senators
943050456443510784 2017-12-19 09:28:44 UTC <rbnewark> trumps flunkies better known as the republican senators all voting in lockstep with this terrible tax increase4many/bigtaxbreaks4rich bill- Y wouldn't they vote 4 it? most R millionaires who will personally benefit greatly from this bill will most of their constiuents will B hurt
943048131104485376 2017-12-19 09:19:30 UTC <rbnewark> @Con_Chron Rook doesnt get it. Thinks he's all that. Needs a little humble pie. He's not on Lakers, it's not one on one ball, it's a team game. Keep playing hard, kid youre awesome protecting the rim, but got to use your head.
943045509551349760 2017-12-19 09:09:05 UTC <rbnewark> how can u pass a bill without dem input?! Very undemocratic! R there no republican senators that support democracy anymore, leaving out over the half the country's representation in government? cant wait til we get our gov back which after this we certainly will soon #dem2018
943044846297554944 2017-12-19 09:06:26 UTC <rbnewark> I was puzzled Y so many republicans in the Senate would get behind this  awful tax increase bill,until I found out they put in provisions that would benefit them personallyl like the "Korker Kickback"many of these, almost one for each vote-shameful guys 4 guys like McCain, Flake
943042947540385792 2017-12-19 08:58:54 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump I'm sure that's a lie like everything else U say. Remember how the boy who cride wolf was never believed after he kept lying? I guess U never learned that very basic lesson- sad
942635343701934080 2017-12-17 05:59:13 UTC <rbnewark> princess Leia Pelosi and Hans solo- Chuck shumer are leading the fight against the dark side led by vader trump and repugnacans, trying 2 screw us once again. it is truly a good ol fashioned fight of good vs evil- #maytheForceBwithus!
942634612781494272 2017-12-17 05:56:19 UTC <rbnewark> @SaysHummingbird He has no shame no conscience no morals no sense of decency or sensitivity of any kind- he's completely self centered
942627818348802048 2017-12-17 05:29:19 UTC <rbnewark> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump trump went over 2 the dark side long ago- a combo of the vile pig Jaba the Hut, and the one who completely caved into the dark side, Darth Vader.
942448823707635712 2017-12-17 17:38:04 UTC <rbnewark> @LesterHoltNBC @realDonaldTrump @RepSwalwell He's obstructed justice and colluded with russians in plain sight asking them to hack hillary's emails in public! whats the problem #lockhimupnow
942448322635116544 2017-12-17 17:36:04 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump U always leave out a few key words as liars r want 2 do, that it's 4 rich 1%ers like yourself! bc its always about U, most of us will have net tax increase bc deductions R being reduced.U R scum of the earth 4 lying 2 middle class & poor, which is the dem party #believetomsteyer
942431029255536640 2017-12-17 16:27:21 UTC <rbnewark> power of prayer helps, look at Alabama-a miracle happened right B4 our eyes, 2B sure thousands of ground workers helped, but how did the hearts & minds of enough Alabamans 2 do the right thing happen? I'm saying prayer was a factor. #praytherosary #toOurLadypatronessofUS
942430012413583360 2017-12-17 16:23:19 UTC <rbnewark> great evil has descended on our country-trumpism,not started by him 2 B sure but he's now carrying torch of fascism,4 only rich,taking frm poor,/middle class,discriminates against people of color,provokes war here & abroad,the list goes on-1 option-dont sleep on power of prayer
942424284114313216 2017-12-17 16:00:33 UTC <rbnewark> We comared trump 2 hitler & everyone thought it could never go that far, but look whats happening now; he's coopting congress, trying 2 take over the judicial branch,attacking the free press-sound familiar 2 anyone? it should- hitler also consolidated power #mustbestopped
942423408410636288 2017-12-17 15:57:04 UTC <rbnewark> like a petulant child anytime something doesnt go his way he questions it attacks, and his minions support him over & above anything else-their principles,the Constitution,their constuency-nothing else matters to them- trump does anything he wants, still gets their approval-scary
942420633245192194 2017-12-17 15:46:02 UTC <rbnewark> trumps flunkies- better known as the republican party- dont stand up 4 anything- not the Constitution, the American people- they have become loyal only to trump & 2 their rich donors- #resistancenotenough
942419889754484736 2017-12-17 15:43:05 UTC <rbnewark> trumps flunkies-the republicans- allowing him 2 consider firing mueller, The separation of powers is being torn to shreds by trump. deaths caused by trumps provocative actions in Israel will now spread to America. He's leading us to war here & around the world #impeachtrumpnow
942418413015613443 2017-12-17 15:37:13 UTC <rbnewark> It will be time 4 revolt if Mueller is fired. Th Constitution is under attack & the Republicans R complicit with trumps treasonous behaviors bc they continue to favor him over the Constitution. It's time to take our country back. #takebackourcountry
941939335271608321 2017-12-15 07:53:32 UTC <rbnewark> @BrookingsInst @Harvard @POTUS @DianeToucan @dany_bahar certainly the case when trumps ancestors got here
941938758001205248 2017-12-15 07:51:14 UTC <rbnewark> speaking of flunkies, nobody fits the roll of flunkies better than the spineless republicans who grovel at the feet of their corrupt bully, afraid to say a word against for fear of  retribution, not a one of them with a pair
941907696915120129 2017-12-15 05:47:49 UTC <rbnewark> Watching my favorite movie"It's a Wonderful Life"realized it's a parallel for today w republicans like Potter-greedy, amoral criminals, not satisfied with they what have but trying 2 take everything 4 themselves, Dems like Jimmy Stewart-decent honest principled hard working
941560819619266561 2017-12-14 06:49:27 UTC <rbnewark> Y R republicans on the wrong side of every single issue-tax cut 4 the rich- wrong, cut medical care 4 poor- wrong, sell national parks-wrong.  against net neutrality- wrong promote coal- wrong again- republicans a very greedy, unethical, uncaring group of people
941559492424056837 2017-12-14 06:44:10 UTC <rbnewark> donnie the dick wants us to believe him on the tax increase when every single analysis shows it be a big tax cut for the rich & an increase 4 poor and middle class  now all repugnacans repeating the lie shameful
941558252206137344 2017-12-14 06:39:15 UTC <rbnewark> donnie knows lies. donnie knows fake news- Nobody in the history of US has lied more than trump which since he is president becomes fake news automatically. The count is now conservatively said to be over 2 million lies. It is said that he even lies in his sleep, a rare phenomena
941409415462129664 2017-12-14 20:47:49 UTC <rbnewark> @ananavarro @SaysHummingbird There's a lawsuit here if I were her. What is that mumbo jumbo at the end? I think he's lost it completely.
941408824157642752 2017-12-14 20:45:28 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump He backed roy moore everyone- youre going to support someone who did that!? What kind of low life supports a child molester for senate- thats politics over principles- this man is not to be trusted in any way
941407957173989376 2017-12-14 20:42:02 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump More lies from the king of loserville fredo trump- believe this at your own peril how can you believe someone who is a sexual predator and a child molester. Y hasn't more Congress folks called for his resignation like they did for the others. His crimes R much more serious !
941405105475141632 2017-12-14 20:30:42 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Please just quit. everywhere people across the country, even in the deep red states R rejecting your hateful blame game- U never admitted any wrongdoing but everyone knows youre as guilty as sin, as guilty as roy moore of sexual assault harassment and child molesting- #lockhimup
940851246231146497 2017-12-12 07:49:51 UTC <rbnewark> It looks like maybe the country is learning from its mistake named fredo trump and is trying to make amends until he is impeached; growing number of Congress members calling for his impeachment and/or resignation
940850773805666304 2017-12-12 07:47:59 UTC <rbnewark> @JoyAnnReid and thank U 4 your ringing endorsement of his opponent- he could'nt have lost without U, U the biggest loser of them all- U R toxic-everything U touch is a disaster-do us all a favor & resign U R  complete failure & disgrace to our beloved country & all decent civil Americans
940849875545133059 2017-12-12 07:44:25 UTC <rbnewark> trump endorsement kiss of death- everyone knows he'll say anything, and nothing he says is based on fact, so nobody believes what he says
940849430739193856 2017-12-12 07:42:39 UTC <rbnewark> thank U trump & mr irrelevant, bannon 4 campaigning 4 moore, I dont think he couldve lost without U!

940822709495324672 2017-12-12 05:56:28 UTC <rbnewark> trump has gotten a pass for some reason, he's more of a perv than roy moore and Bill cosby combined. He needs to resign B4 it gets ugly- congress calling for look at these 15 women's very credible allegations- only a matter of time not if but when
940822004135014400 2017-12-12 05:53:40 UTC <rbnewark> Bannon/trump white trash party still there but a shrinking minority- their "movement" is deader than a doornail. Bannon thinks he's relevant but he's sadly mistaken- no decent people want anything to do w a scum bucket like him. He thinks he's smarter than everyone smug bastard
940820743276908545 2017-12-12 05:48:39 UTC <rbnewark> Proud of the Alabaman voters -they did the right thing, putting values ahead of party. Perv like Moore have no business in Senate or anywhere but jail frankly. too bad Jones wans't prolife. It wouldve been a lot easier decision for most folks.
940010790823673857 2017-12-10 00:10:11 UTC <rbnewark> @krassenstein Brilliant and deadly accurate!
940001395020775424 2017-12-10 23:32:51 UTC <rbnewark> no honor in republican party- all quiet on the republican front, either that or actually support for the lying pedophile mall troller!
940001040396533760 2017-12-10 23:31:27 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Youre going down Fredo, one way or another. do everyone a favor & a messy impeachment, and resign. the country believes Mueller , because all U do is lie - yU R the stain #lockhimup
939624144706027521 2017-12-09 22:33:48 UTC <rbnewark> trump robo call could B kiss of death 4 roy moore his base already in who could possible B on the fence about this guy! either youre against the mall trolling child molester or youre for him! Has 2 B baked in by now. will repugnacans celebrate?How can they feel good if moore wins
939621118582841345 2017-12-09 22:21:46 UTC <rbnewark> @InSpiteOfTrump @TeaPainUSA @goodreadstruth No
939620988576088064 2017-12-09 22:21:15 UTC <rbnewark> @TeaPainUSA there is no bottom to that group, so disappointed in those that i thought had some principles, like Collins, McCain, Flake, Murkowski
939620496018096128 2017-12-09 22:19:18 UTC <rbnewark> @SaysHummingbird sad, but true!
939620283165556736 2017-12-09 22:18:27 UTC <rbnewark> shocker Fredo trump screwing somebody while they think nobody's looking- thank God 4 a free press, but guess who's trying to thwart that basic right! trump would like nothing better than to shut down the free press.https://twitter.com/SaysHummingbird/status/939606588058488834
939619438487248896 2017-12-09 22:15:06 UTC <rbnewark> @washingtonpost @daveweigel @realDonaldTrump Nobody wants 2 hear a loser anymore- U lost the election, U lost health care, U lost immigrant ban, U lost sanctuary cities, youre going 2 lose your tax increase on the middle class/big tax cut 4 your rich buddies. Y dont U try telling the truth- just once! u might like it!
939595951420858368 2017-12-09 20:41:46 UTC <rbnewark> My mom always told me that one lie leads 2 another- apparently trump & moore's mom failed 2 get that point across as their lies build upon earlier lies and then so on and so forth- both of them living a lie as R the people supporting them- not men enuff to step up and face music
939595191228416001 2017-12-09 20:38:45 UTC <rbnewark> No wonder fredo trump loves roy moore-he's just like him! child molesters then serial liars to cover up- the prisons R full of people who claim 2 B innocent,like trump and moore 99% R guilty as sin, literally. Y dont fredo & roy have 2 resign like others #doublestandard
939577558558846977 2017-12-09 19:28:41 UTC <rbnewark> when and if moore gets to the senate his accusers will have their day in public testimony B4 the ethics committee, and then moore will B forced to resign in disgrace as is just 4 a child molester.
939576777420169216 2017-12-09 19:25:34 UTC <rbnewark> trump at a civil rights museum is like Hitler speaking at a Halacaust museum- the civil rights movement was needed bc of people like trump and moore- surprised they didnt have him speak as well! Moore pines 4 the days of slavery and "strong families!"
939575674334986240 2017-12-09 19:21:11 UTC <rbnewark> nobody speaks 4 the least of us- Reps blame them 4 their misery- easy to rationalize them away Dems ignore them as well, but at least tried to give them decent health care- but now repugnacans taking it away
939575033369739269 2017-12-09 19:18:39 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump U R least trusted Person in America! Conyers quit Franken quit- You're a much bigger child molesting sexual predator than them combined, U and Roy moore two pervs of a feather Y haven't U quit, Y hasnt moore- because U arent men enough 2 do so!  #resign
938293201840025600 2017-12-05 06:25:06 UTC <rbnewark> the poor, homeless, drug addicted, mentally ill-all ignored/never mentioned in any republican or democrat discourse-the forgotten in America are still with us in ever increasing numbers-but they have more dignity,integrity morality than any repubiican in Congress in my book
938291127018573824 2017-12-05 06:16:51 UTC <rbnewark> please boycott San Francisco- We'd rather have good decent hardworking  immigrants than any roy moore supporting white trash trump butt kissing amoral evangelical hypocritical racist bastards here  in SF  - you're not welcome anywhere -do not sully our great state
938289210079043584 2017-12-05 06:09:14 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump I'd rather be locked inside of a full outhouse- same amount of shit in both places!
938053882890002432 2017-12-05 14:34:08 UTC <rbnewark> Roy Moore is a sign of the depth that our country has sunk. Before trump a person like him wouldve been run out the state in shame, but now theyre promoting him to the Senate 4 his depraved behavior! It's surreal and depressing.
938053292084551680 2017-12-05 14:31:47 UTC <rbnewark> I'm praying 4 our country we are in bad shape right now. the moral decay on so many issues is so profound not sure if we can recover #praytherosary to Our Lady Patron Saint of the US
938052559004037120 2017-12-05 14:28:52 UTC <rbnewark> Moore will face senate ethics investigation and then the women will have a chance to testify in public under oath, so let him win
938050508677300227 2017-12-05 14:20:44 UTC <rbnewark> republicans passing tax cut for the rich-outrageous!Y bc their it benefits their donors so if they want donors $$,they better vote for it-quid pro quo! all the republicans caved on this-threw a few morsels to the masses, but take them away in a few years! rich benefits permanent
938047344867602432 2017-12-05 14:08:09 UTC <rbnewark> I wish Teddy R. were alive today- only republican with any gumption- he wouldve stood up to Trup- woudve kicked his ass if he tried what he's doing now raping our national parks by giving them 2 business interests.
938046678929514496 2017-12-05 14:05:30 UTC <rbnewark> trump taking away our national parks and giving them over to coal interests?What century R we in?He's taking us back to a more polluting energy source. He must have a financial interest in coal He's probably never gone camping,doesn't appreciate the necessity of preserving nature
938045644391956480 2017-12-05 14:01:24 UTC <rbnewark> @thehill ... as does 3/4 of America- only amoral white trash admire trump
937897916110315520 2017-12-04 04:14:23 UTC <rbnewark> lying a contagious disease; now trump's lawyers lying for him, which should get them disbarred
937896502579490816 2017-12-04 04:08:46 UTC <rbnewark> trump cant even hire decent lawyers- both dont understand basic civics- the pres is not above the law- that's like saying the police chief can do whatever he wants! both will now need to recuse themselves since theyre acting as witnesses to something the president said
937895602959949824 2017-12-04 04:05:11 UTC <rbnewark> Nixon and trump many parallels there; both will suffer the same fate. though trump much worse. #lockhimup #traitor #obstructionofjustice #liarliarpantsonfire
937891752626741248 2017-12-04 03:49:53 UTC <rbnewark> How can Christmas "b bigger and better thn ever B4" as the president stated- it was the greatest single event in human history- how do U improve on tht? Trump is just so full of shit he'd make an outhouse that is long over due to be serviced blush
937890758517854208 2017-12-04 03:45:56 UTC <rbnewark> Mall trolling child molester has support of the voters in Alabama to become a US Senator. We've had worse I suppose but never out in the open like this; guilty as sin,signature right there in the year book.Merry Christmas everybody. How do they rationalize their choice?
937707031686819841 2017-12-04 15:35:52 UTC <rbnewark> What aboutism is alive and well with lying donnie. Trying 2 divert the heat, he cries Hillary as he always does! pathetic liar who knows she's been cleared- He's dead meat! looking forward to the next few weeks, when trumps obstruction case gets brought out in the light of day!
937694034922897409 2017-12-04 14:44:14 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump U lie as easy as most of us breathe- just in this one tweet I count several. 1st of all, tax cuts R 4 the wealthy, most of us, the poor/middle class pay more or get very little, so massive is a lie. The only puppet would B moore to the coke brothers & other rich donors
937693128517021696 2017-12-04 14:40:37 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump I say we already have one too many child molesters in Washington-U! We dont need more trump puppets either. What kind of people would vote for a child molester? What type of people support him? Only people who think this type of behavior, like mall trolling for little girls is OK
937376620142137344 2017-12-03 17:42:56 UTC <rbnewark> Can you say coverup? the thing is it's not subtle it's as obvious as the nose on my face trump trying to put up a smoke screen of insults, lies, fake news. thank God 4 Mueller wont give up until he takes down the president! If he does he'll B one of Americas greatest heroes!
937374555651194880 2017-12-03 17:34:44 UTC <rbnewark> @BrianPaulStuart @EricHolder Right on! So true! Never has our gov been more corrupt than it is right now. Big donors directing Republican policy in a direct quid pro quo- You do what we want and we'll support U financially
937371765415690240 2017-12-03 17:23:39 UTC <rbnewark> As Mueller zeroes in on criminal intent of the president trump does what he always does, what he knows best, really the only thing he's good at- he goes into a flurry of lies attacking his enemy today its the FBI!
937370374970290176 2017-12-03 17:18:07 UTC <rbnewark> @AP @mechelle1966 @JeremyBrotherz Then Y is it that U white trash party trumpers love them more than America?

937367233281507333 2017-12-03 17:05:38 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Thank goodness youll B in jail soon and they'll  take away your phone, youll have your fellow child molesting inmates to spend time with, maybe U & Roy can share a cell & talk about old times compare note on where U like to troll 4 your prey.
937365925837250560 2017-12-03 17:00:26 UTC <rbnewark> Please boycott San Francisco- the last thing we want here R more stupid  white trash evangelical hypocrites Mnuchin/Mulvaney loving racist assholes-we'll take your poor, decent honest hardworking immigrant minorities any day over you. Might as well give the Statue of Liberty back
937364534058090496 2017-12-03 16:54:54 UTC <rbnewark> republicans take their marching orders from the coke brothers and other major donors- the tax bill benefits the super rich plain & simple this is  quid quo pro if I ever saw one
936834166301237249 2017-12-01 05:47:25 UTC <rbnewark> Hate to call nombskull tillerson a voice of reason, but compared to trump he is one of the saner ones there. Another dangerous move Haley is itching to nuke someone she's been as threatening as trump.
936833335669571584 2017-12-01 05:44:07 UTC <rbnewark> Y do republicans screw over the middle class every chance they get! This tax increases the taxes on those in thr 40-50K by over 5 Billion,  while cutting over 5  billion in taxes on those making over 400K?! How does this help most Americans
936804735100661760 2017-12-01 03:50:28 UTC <rbnewark> The noose is tightening! It would poetic justice if there was a lynching of the most racist president of all time! then you would indeed see Muslims, and all the other decent Americans dancing in the streets celebrating the common good's victory over the evil orange clown evil
936803738055950336 2017-12-01 03:46:30 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump How much did u pay the "economists" R they real or R they fake phony frauds like U? I'm guessing they're all phony like U the illegit pres who overwhelming lost the popular vote by 11 mil. Most hated man in America

936491535339683841 2017-11-30 07:05:55 UTC <rbnewark> @jimmykimmel Where we come from sexually assaulting minors is a crime,& a sin.Trolling malls 4 little girls is pretty sic stuff.Perverts like U shouldn't B in the Senate,they should B in prison-there justice would B served-child molesters shouldnt B glorified & defended.they should B punished
936490148769828864 2017-11-30 07:00:25 UTC <rbnewark> @jimmykimmel what kind of Christian values includes molesting little girls?!Isnt that a terrible sin? what else is Ok with U? is lynching then still acceptable also? maybe incest?what else is acceptable to U? U R one depraved dude,U have some upside down morals your followers just as guilty
936477754073038848 2017-11-30 06:11:10 UTC <rbnewark> @jimmykimmel To call your self a Christian is a sacrilege and blashemy- The Lord knows what U did & unless u come clean, U'll pay dearly in the afterlife- B sure to bring lots of suntan lotion where youre going there's a special place in Hell 4 child molesters & their supporters & enablers
936476671128956929 2017-11-30 06:06:51 UTC <rbnewark> @jimmykimmel do it Jimmy! kick the shit out of the pervert! Let him know how his victims felt when he abused them. give him a taste of what prison will be like when he's convicted- they don't take kindly to child molesters in prison- criminals have better morals than repugnacans or alabamans

936473558213050368 2017-11-30 05:54:29 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump How ironic that the antiChrist who is destroying our country would mention the Christmas story, such blashemy from the exact opposite of a follower of Christ there's a special place in Hell waiting for people like U who r living a lie
936238915991695361 2017-11-30 14:22:06 UTC <rbnewark> British Legislaturers have way more courage than American Legislaturers who remain silent on trumps transgressions cowards corrupt- can we trade?

934854788973346816 2017-11-26 18:42:05 UTC <rbnewark> Fredo Trumps endorsement of Moore kiss of death in Alabama? Though he's still extremely popular, there R 15-20% disaffected republicans who reject trump now. These may possibly provide difference in election

934243435682426880 2017-11-24 02:12:47 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump @Cup_of_Joe2 @KeithOlbermann Ooh big big lie here, nobody would give him man of the year except brietbart white trash news or may the National Enquirer alien martian voter poll Man of the Year winner
934242757102616577 2017-11-24 02:10:05 UTC <rbnewark> @kylegriffin1 If they have Jerk of the Year or Ass of the Year or Liar of the Year, or Best Fredo President of all time then I think trump would win hands down any of these
934234685101694976 2017-11-24 01:38:00 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @soccerben He and Bnnon R close but I didnt realize how close
934234234570416128 2017-11-24 01:36:13 UTC <rbnewark> Ivanka at least has decent opinions unlike her dad who is not only a laughing stock of the world, he's the Fredo of presidents- stupid, incompetent, insecure, yet very dangerous bc of his insecurities
934233663738281984 2017-11-24 01:33:57 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Make up your mind, U just committed thousands of troops to Afghanistan; youre making a bad situation far worse #bringbackobama
933452529358143488 2017-11-22 21:50:00 UTC <rbnewark> @NYDailyNews @shotzz20 @kylegriffin1 Perverts stick together
933366398637694976 2017-11-22 16:07:45 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Moore threatening to sue the women accusers... Sound familiar Donnie? what ever happened to all of your lawsuits? That's how the rich get away with sexual crimes, they just spend more than us until we cant stay in the game. Bullying, intimidating, decieving
933365698239258624 2017-11-22 16:04:58 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Supporting Roy Moore? Shameful. and then U went into your stream of lying about Jones- 1.U never looked into his record 2.He's not soft on crime, 3. He's not against the 2nd Amendment- he's a gun owner etc, etc, etc,
933364881868201984 2017-11-22 16:01:43 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Mueller slowly but surely getting closer 2 U.Looking forward 2 when he gets there! U & Charles Manson have a lot in common;constantly lying- example deceptive manipulative threatening inherently evil.Both of U deserve 2 rot in jail. Mueller will get 2 the truth,& then you'll pay
933363463530848256 2017-11-22 15:56:05 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Charles Manson would've been  a better president than U. He lies almost as much as U. He got his just due. We're still waiting 4 U 2 have 2 pay the piper 4 all your crimes- we're looking forward 2 it, the noose is tighening China wouldve released them on their own didnt need U
933205452535382017 2017-11-21 05:28:12 UTC <rbnewark> @DearAuntCrabby Can we get a bigger billboard?
933186973002371073 2017-11-21 04:14:46 UTC <rbnewark> @TheRickyDavila Trump admires some very questionable people- think he secretly must feel the same Un wants to be friends with him I believe he said. These R the types of leaders he aspires 2 B- a tyrant, allpowerful, ruthless with opponents.
933186107675693056 2017-11-21 04:11:20 UTC <rbnewark> @KailiJoy @Shareblue Two peas in a pod! Child Molesters hang together through thick and thin! heartwarming isn't it?
933185497421176833 2017-11-21 04:08:54 UTC <rbnewark> All U have 2 do is deny doing wrongdoing,& youre not guilty- Easypeasy! Our justice system has it all wrong! all along we just should of asked criminals if they did what theyre accused of;if they deny it let them go! So simple! Cuts down on court costs,& I predict empty prisons
933183793971654657 2017-11-21 04:02:08 UTC <rbnewark> Pastor trying to justify moore trolling for young girls at the mall, bc they were purer than older females- How crazy is this going to get! I'm hoping Alabamans will do the right thing. I'm praying for them to have the courage to do so   .
933171523438833664 2017-11-21 03:13:23 UTC <rbnewark> Trump lies as easy as most people breathe- Doug Jones is pro military and owns guns, trump gave Alabamans a binary choice- a liberal or a child molester. apparently a liberal is worse to him than a child molester. What say you, Alabama?
933126750082441216 2017-11-21 00:15:28 UTC <rbnewark> Child molesters stick together! Trump backs Moore! Now we wil have two of the highest offices in the land occupied by Child Molesters, some republicans stick to the party, right or wrong over the la over the country. Everone knew he was a predatory sexual assaulter, a mall walker
933113661396152320 2017-11-21 23:23:27 UTC <rbnewark> @isteintraum the trump legacy of sexual misconduct continues
933113164652093440 2017-11-21 23:21:29 UTC <rbnewark> @MeredithBlake Facts never got in the way of anything trump says- another example of his his ignorance and deceit.
933112063265611776 2017-11-21 23:17:06 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Oh well, Moore says he's innocent, so he must be- lets ask all the people accused of crimes, and if they deny it, they must be innocent, according to your logic. Despicable. this is the way entitled unethical people think- double standard city. #lockthemup
933111172441583616 2017-11-21 23:13:34 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Charles Manson and U similar in many ways- manipulative, threatening, self promoting, 4 own good, not good of others same methods used in gaining power- did you study him? U 2 so much alike
933014367422910464 2017-11-21 16:48:54 UTC <rbnewark> U oppose Columbus Day? U've got an ally in the KKK. they R strongly opposed to Columbus - Maybe U you can get together and have a rally- I'm sure they can bring some extra sheets 4 U
933011507125690369 2017-11-21 16:37:32 UTC <rbnewark> We R headed back to a time, the 1920's, when white racists were a force, the KKK, 4 mil strong, elected governors, Senators even a supreme court justice was a member of the KKK, trump & his admin includes people with similar views- MAGA is dog whistle tribute to those times
933010205251551232 2017-11-21 16:32:22 UTC <rbnewark> @LegalEagle60 That's fine if you want to forgive him, but no way should he be a Senator.
933007933448663040 2017-11-21 16:23:20 UTC <rbnewark> So embarrassing to have such low lifes running our country now. It's a real wake up call of the downward spiral our nation is in morally speaking, that ethics, moral standards, common decency don't matter any more. This is an indictment of where we R as a nation. We've slipped
932850897167646720 2017-11-20 05:59:20 UTC <rbnewark> Lavar Ball is an idiot, but if he smack talks trump, then he's my idiot- U go Lavar!
932850538864984064 2017-11-20 05:57:54 UTC <rbnewark> @ddiamond Very good! Retweet the hell out of this one!
932849982515724288 2017-11-20 05:55:42 UTC <rbnewark> Klan very influential in 1920's politically; elected Senators, governors- even the supreme court justice hugo black, but they were gradually beaten back under their rocks where they belonged-now making a comeback thanks to trumpism- we will defeat them & those of their ilk again
932846055699259392 2017-11-20 05:40:05 UTC <rbnewark> @EricBoehlert @Shareblue "I got the pictures of you peeing on the bed right over there- say anything bad about me and I'll release them to the press"
932845616786415617 2017-11-20 05:38:21 UTC <rbnewark> @DearAuntCrabby Love the courts! Only vestige of democracy left in America- only branch of government left & its wobbling under trump pressure- when it goes, he'll have control of all 3 branches of gov.
932845010097029120 2017-11-20 05:35:56 UTC <rbnewark> @KamalaHarris Right on! i hope some of your republican colleagues R not voting 4 this bill?
932844690503643136 2017-11-20 05:34:40 UTC <rbnewark> @krassenstein Good one! Another trump stupid hypocrisy #3,456 and counting

932827309504999424 2017-11-20 04:25:36 UTC <rbnewark> Talk about Fake News- calling this bill a tax cut is trump lying at its finest- 2/3 of trumpers, & all other middle & lower class folks-would have a tax increase while he & his fellow1%ers get huge tax cut- most of us realize this- & repugnacans know exactly what theyre doing
932715108190502912 2017-11-20 20:59:45 UTC <rbnewark> trump heading us towards N. Korea type of gov. ruled by military; not a democracy- only hope now is to resist and pray- these together can defeat evil and preserve America! Long live America pray to the Blessed Mother to intercede with our Lord on behalf of US #helpus
932714259636617216 2017-11-20 20:56:23 UTC <rbnewark> How can they pass something that doesn't involve 1/2 of government? dems left out of the process and negotiation- #stopthetaxbill
932713867779510272 2017-11-20 20:54:49 UTC <rbnewark> Republicans R the party of greed- principles B damned raise the deficit? no problem. add tax burden 2 middle class, and tax cuts 4 wealthy- OK bc we owe them to B reeected. #stopthetaxbill
932685892686200832 2017-11-20 19:03:39 UTC <rbnewark> would love to hear from trump accusers, including his exwife. Time to give these women their voice.
932685025627095040 2017-11-20 19:00:13 UTC <rbnewark> @SethAbramson scary statement meaning whatever trump wants to do is OK with him. The forces of evil at work here
932684625666703360 2017-11-20 18:58:37 UTC <rbnewark> Trump and Lavar both cut of the same cloth both oafish braggarts who spew bluster and nonsense 4 effect and end up just alot of hot air most of thetime- only thing trumps as president ideas R harmful 2 many Americans and America #pray4america
932683625748840449 2017-11-20 18:54:39 UTC <rbnewark> @SethAbramson This man's statement gives some credibility to the idea that trump could B the antiChrist that could lead us to the end times, but I must say that prayer has B4 and  can again help to change the course of history if enuff people of good will do so. #praytherosary
932682647427432450 2017-11-20 18:50:46 UTC <rbnewark> @SethAbramson Theres two forces in the world the force of Good and the force of Evil- many have chosen to throw their lot in with the Evil One as that blasphemous statement shows. To deny Jesus is to take the side of pharisees & those demanding he B crucified
932681444371001344 2017-11-20 18:45:59 UTC <rbnewark> Republicans have excused all of trumps sex crimes and now moores child molestation charges, ut then attack franken and Clinton actions?! Can anyone say double standard! #lockthemup
932670273165209600 2017-11-20 18:01:35 UTC <rbnewark> Alabamans have a big decision December which will determine direction of our country- is it party B4 right and wrong; whats the most important thing about a candidate-is it his politics,or his character?tough decision 4 Republicans down there-I'm hopeful theyll do the right thing
932667911172325376 2017-11-20 17:52:12 UTC <rbnewark> More than anything during this dangerous time 4 our country what is needed is prayer. Please pray 4 our country that we can survive this downward turn these dark days #praytherosary
932666559247540224 2017-11-20 17:46:50 UTC <rbnewark> Biggest gap in washington the moral gap- look at Dems vs rep reaction 2 to charges against one of their members, dems condemn, reps defend the activities- person charged; reps deny, dems admit, and r remorseful- dems set good example 4 US, reps dont
932665605357953024 2017-11-20 17:43:03 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Chinese were not going 2 keep them over somethig so trivial as shoplifting! think of all the crimes youve committed against women, workers, minorities- U've been running from the law your whole life.  looking forward 2 the day justice is served #lockhimup
932664957497249793 2017-11-20 17:40:28 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Y didnt the russians arrest U 4 prostitution and damage to the hotel room? luckily they kept the tape which is Y U R afraid 2 criticize them! thyre blackmailing U! #dossier
932184997548646400 2017-11-19 09:53:17 UTC <rbnewark> @DearAuntCrabby Wow this is shocking! Is there any humanity there- probably like to have slavery back too
932184713120198656 2017-11-19 09:52:09 UTC <rbnewark> @JoyAnnReid whats much worse than child molestation? U republicans dont seem to have any morals more like animals really
932184136139251712 2017-11-19 09:49:51 UTC <rbnewark> @SaysHummingbird Thats our president talking
930335265364652032 2017-11-13 07:23:06 UTC <rbnewark> @CraigCo62 wonder if Hannity would give Moore permission to date his 16yr old daughter if he asked.. probably would.
930334599154098176 2017-11-13 07:20:27 UTC <rbnewark> Dotard vs Rocket Man will make a great comic book some day.
930297790986518528 2017-11-13 04:54:12 UTC <rbnewark> @MeMySylvanEye @selectedwisdom nothing worse than a trump supporter- lowest form of like on earth
930297044547158016 2017-11-13 04:51:14 UTC <rbnewark> @Bencjacobs Yet they still keep electing him
930295888567664645 2017-11-13 04:46:38 UTC <rbnewark> isnt that pwecious trump believes putin- he doesnt believe almost anybody in his own country- media, courts, dems, but he bewieves the despot, someone who orders killings of opposition,the criminal head of russian terrorism isnt that pwecious
930275986314113025 2017-11-13 03:27:33 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Maybe U & Roy can go trolling once he gets to the senate- he'll add 2 quality people in the repubnacan party- U, him, quinn, manafort, bannon, price, manuchin- all in putins and coke bros back pocket they say jump U say how high #drainthsewer
930275193309732864 2017-11-13 03:24:24 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump How stupid do U think we R- we're not repugnacans we can add & subtract most in middle class will have a net tax increase while the fat cats pay less U & swamp get richer while the rest of us get poorer thanks to your "tax cut" #dontcomeback
930252038318866432 2017-11-13 01:52:23 UTC <rbnewark> @Isabellarowling @JoyAnnReid Sounds like the classic ideal trump/republican appointee; just like himself, unqualified, inexperienced, incompetent a mirror image of the president, and most republicans as well.
930250170146603009 2017-11-13 01:44:58 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump @DelfinaValdez8 @DearAuntCrabby Hilarious! i bet he was most disappointed about the hookers
930249687000522752 2017-11-13 01:43:03 UTC <rbnewark> Moore even signed the girl's high school yearbook, and he's still denies it- and even worse, the morons down there still believe him!!!! No wonder an idiot like trump could get elected- the depth of the stupidity and depravity is stunning
930248931765772288 2017-11-13 01:40:03 UTC <rbnewark> It's hard for us  2 understand the South, where apparently things like child molestation, incest, rape, etc aint no big thang; Moore still supported guilty or not, but God forbid homosexuality, now that would've been a different story. Hypocrites
929443071409864705 2017-11-11 20:17:51 UTC <rbnewark> @Tackspayer @TheRickyDavila Retweet the hell out of this one- This is as rare as a duck billed platypus, and I thought they were extinct- A republican with a soul, a conscience, principles?! unheard of these days, thank God there's a few heroes left-I thought these were extinct too! John Larson 4 president!
929441749998563328 2017-11-11 20:12:36 UTC <rbnewark> Of course who wouldn't believe Putin, he has denied killing dissidents, denied invading crimea and Ukraine-he's totally believble, about as beleivable as trump himself- King of the Liars Club, Almighty Spewer of Falshoods, the Grand Poobah of Deceit
929371250639564800 2017-11-11 15:32:27 UTC <rbnewark> Moore and his evangelical republican nonchristian pharisees use the religion to justify their crimes their hate theyre closer to the people who killed Christ than to being one of His followers
929192829812797440 2017-11-10 03:43:28 UTC <rbnewark> @jimsciutto My condolences, a good parent is such a blessing and such a loss- they've showed us the way
929192078684299265 2017-11-10 03:40:29 UTC <rbnewark> yes let us remember that trump is just the tip of the iceberg- we need to root out the evil that is repugnatism- the hard right scorched earth jerks who have no interest in working in the best interests of the country, 4 the  common good and towards a more perfect union
929190933119119360 2017-11-10 03:35:56 UTC <rbnewark> @TheDemCoalition @NathanLerner Moore looks good in devil red- appropriate!
929190726428061696 2017-11-10 03:35:07 UTC <rbnewark> @TheDemCoalition @NathanLerner No chance- the devil himself, & the devil would definitely b a repugnacan, would win by double digits in any of those confederate states down there
929189605991112704 2017-11-10 03:30:40 UTC <rbnewark> Hannity's interview show Moore to B guilty as sin- and yes this iis a sin and  crime he got away with. Trouble is with evangelicals their morals shift easily based on their behavior-sins rationalized away. For Catholics, a sin is a sin
929188341412536321 2017-11-10 03:25:38 UTC <rbnewark> Like Moore, the Alabama repugnacans stand by him maybe because they have skeletons in their own closet. How else could anybody in their right mind still support Moore whether he's innocent or guilty
929138708359479296 2017-11-10 00:08:25 UTC <rbnewark> Repugnacan party reaching new lows; becoming party of pedophiles-trump had under age girls accusing him B4 he became president and Moore, and now pedophile supporters! Many repugnacans standing by their man, guilty or not! party over principle and decency!
929041716400685056 2017-11-10 17:43:00 UTC <rbnewark> Republicans, i hope you'll enjoy serving along side your esteemed colleague Roy Moore who represents yall so well #guiltbyassociation dems rallying cry 4 2018- He'll B the poster boy 4 every dem across the nation along with the photo of that 14 year old he raped.
929040303570350080 2017-11-10 17:37:23 UTC <rbnewark> would be great to see trump, moore, weinstein, spacy all together in the same prison with a bunch of other hard core sexual deviants, and lets just see what happens! Now thats my idea of justice, Judge Moore!
929039629759553536 2017-11-10 17:34:43 UTC <rbnewark> @SethAbramson One good rigging deserves another, trump likes to say so how about it russia, trump publicly, blatantly ask themto intervene in the election- nuff said time to indict him.
929038901125160961 2017-11-10 17:31:49 UTC <rbnewark> @HoarseWisperer He knew something the others didnt know- this decision could come back to bite him some day.
929038443614580736 2017-11-10 17:30:00 UTC <rbnewark> @KamalaHarris Uh no bc the next guy would probably B worse.
929038216224632833 2017-11-10 17:29:06 UTC <rbnewark> @DelfinaValdez8 @tedlieu Wow, hard 2 imagine the type of person who this type of activity doesn't bother outside of hard core prison pop., very disappointed 2 hear about such squalor.
929037181666041857 2017-11-10 17:24:59 UTC <rbnewark> When I listen 2 many of the scorched earth type of republicans, like evangelicals who support racism, rapists, child molesters just bc theyre republicans; its quite disheartening- these types no longer fringe lunatics now significant  doesnt bode well 4 US
929034648214056961 2017-11-10 17:14:55 UTC <rbnewark> Republicans have only tried 2 take things away from us- health care now deductions that make our tax bill higher; I hope the tax bill fails; again no effort to include dems. hopefully kiss of death
929034133874941952 2017-11-10 17:12:52 UTC <rbnewark> Republican tax bill favors rich- doesn't include 1/2 of constituency input- the democrats- how can people support this party that takes advantage of us? doesnt practice good government 4 common good?
929033022480850944 2017-11-10 17:08:27 UTC <rbnewark> very few republicans with a conscience, calling 4 moore to step down; anything goes 4 them; don't seem 2 have integrity, moral compass- always party B4 country, $$ B4 people, rich B4 poor
929019610786959360 2017-11-10 16:15:10 UTC <rbnewark> rape/molesters OK with repugnacans; add them to the white supremacists, NRA, and even worst of all, trump supporters=White Trash Party
929018943414575104 2017-11-10 16:12:31 UTC <rbnewark> Repugnacans now the party of rapists and child molesters- they're still supporting/making excuses 4 Roy Moore and Donald, these guys R criminals and should B in jail not in the white house/senate
928637737405517825 2017-11-09 14:57:44 UTC <rbnewark> No Dems on board or included in developing this tax plan- this plan is of, by and for the 1%er class; it doesn't benefit wage earners only the business owners; no guarantee-unlikely- it will trickle down to us peons. It's a bad deal.
928637010956267520 2017-11-09 14:54:51 UTC <rbnewark> Don't understand Y Repuganacans continue 2 try 2 screw us, sell us a bill of goods- this tax plan raises our taxes so rich guys can get a tax break? We're already being taxed 2 death. How anyone in middle class could belong to this party is beyond me.
928434982820896769 2017-11-08 01:32:04 UTC <rbnewark> I'm getting killed by taxes, so Y R repugnacans trying to raise my taxes?! And then they give the rich huge tax breaks! And they know exactly what they're doing! How cynical! These people R truly vile people.

928378363479068672 2017-11-08 21:47:04 UTC <rbnewark> I'm guessing trump never did jury duty. Some 1%er exemption just like theyre trying to fix it so the rich don't have 2 pay any taxes, As bad as hillary would have been, at least her policies would've been good. this guy is far worse than anything imaginable.
928375939632738304 2017-11-08 21:37:27 UTC <rbnewark> @happyloner Looks like a foto of losers cheaters, liars  I guess youre right deplorables

892134708661768193 2017-07-31 21:27:44 UTC <rbnewark> Not my idea, but so funny i have to retweet it- denying there's chaos in the White House is like saying the sky's not blue.
892131108900413440 2017-07-31 21:13:26 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump dont know if youve heard, Mr. Pres  but denying that there's chaos in the WH like saying the sky isn't blue- good one right

892128209969360896 2017-07-31 21:01:54 UTC <rbnewark> @funder John Kelly lost all credibility condoning trump behavior by staying on thru everything and now even taking another position? deplorable
892125904138256385 2017-07-31 20:52:45 UTC <rbnewark> Kelly if he indeed had any principles in the first place would have nothing to do with trump or his administration
892057060715642880 2017-07-31 16:19:11 UTC <rbnewark> @Miami4Trump @JrcheneyJohn that's how you trumpers roll, U dont get your way, & U threaten, bully, whatever it takes dam the laws just like your corrupt leader!
892056625564884993 2017-07-31 16:17:27 UTC <rbnewark> @Miami4Trump @JrcheneyJohn McCain a hero to most Americans- if you want to MAGA, just get rid of the idiot pres that's ruining our country.
892055735021977600 2017-07-31 16:13:55 UTC <rbnewark> If Kelly wont "suffer idiots", his first order of business would be to fire the president, wouldn't it- never had a bigger idiot than trump
891004670088421376 2017-07-28 18:37:22 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump How about prosecuting pres who colludes, was illeglly elected, who has obstructed justice several times, burn at the stake?
890956728065380352 2017-07-28 15:26:51 UTC <rbnewark> trump trying to sabotage healthcare wants it to fail- how cynical is that at innocent sick poor elderly Americans' expense #lockhimup
890939828434460673 2017-07-28 14:19:42 UTC <rbnewark> Collins And murkowski R heroes- only republicans with any principles- rest only voting 4 their self interest not the interests of the people
890938471300210689 2017-07-28 14:14:19 UTC <rbnewark> How can a comm director speak like mooch does- not since 3rd Reich. He's a disgrace 2 our nation, but I guess thats normal 4 this admin

890936884871942146 2017-07-28 14:08:00 UTC <rbnewark> Mitch McConnell lost bc he didnt include dems anywhere in the process. Hopefully he learned his lesson
890936561528782848 2017-07-28 14:06:43 UTC <rbnewark> repeal and replace? repugnacans been talking about this 4 a decade, but their ruthless proposal failed, as their bankrupt policies often do

890934882850938880 2017-07-28 14:00:03 UTC <rbnewark> @TeaPainUSA @EJLandwehr The two biggest losers of all time to rise to the presidency- Nixon and Trump- who's worse? At least Nixon knew what he was doing had exp

890812574115086337 2017-07-27 05:54:02 UTC <rbnewark> McConnell & the republicans failed, but the American people won-16 mill who would have lost health care, were able to keep their health care
890740604224684033 2017-07-27 01:08:03 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump @Scaramucci colorful?
890738105820499969 2017-07-27 00:58:08 UTC <rbnewark> mooch is an animal like trump;after he fires the whole admin team,he will turn on the pres,& hopefully they'll duke it out,& kill each other
890736095217934336 2017-07-27 00:50:08 UTC <rbnewark> Scaramucci proving 2B scum like Bannon,flynn,conway, and of course the big head Kahuna scumbucket trump-
890735358224224256 2017-07-27 00:47:13 UTC <rbnewark> We dont need no stinking wall-not 4 1.6 billion-I hope if they build it we knock it down like they did in Berlin-I'll B glad 2 help

890271062948143104 2017-07-26 18:02:16 UTC <rbnewark> Any news that disagrees with trump is fake news; any news he likes, like brietbart or enquirer is legit- have we gone completely bonkers
890270225467191296 2017-07-26 17:58:56 UTC <rbnewark> it will B a glorious thing when trump crashes & burns, the sooner the better.
890269870553653248 2017-07-26 17:57:32 UTC <rbnewark> trumps filled with self-no pretense of civility or policy only pure ego gratification-all actions/statements involves satisfying this need
890267529179930624 2017-07-26 17:48:13 UTC <rbnewark> Only good republican is apparently a female one-only ones willing 2 stand up 2 threats from pres & not back down r women Murkowski & Collins
890266795835244544 2017-07-26 17:45:19 UTC <rbnewark> trump by far worst POTUS ever
890266662699540481 2017-07-26 17:44:47 UTC <rbnewark> I would like to see and would be willing to pay a lot of money to that transgender navy seal kick trumps sorry ass

890265895452368896 2017-07-26 17:41:44 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is obviously not a religious person, uses God only when it's convenient 4 him; lies cheats & steals only concerned with his own ego
890265296799285250 2017-07-26 17:39:21 UTC <rbnewark> Trudat- best thing we can do to MAGA is start by getting rid of trump, then

889898025740521476 2017-07-25 17:19:57 UTC <rbnewark> trump demands absolute loyalty frm his minions, but then constantly throws people under the bus-shows no loyalty 2 anyone other than family
889893930669559808 2017-07-25 17:03:41 UTC <rbnewark> What's happening 2 this country when pres works boy scouts like pol campaign, & nobody says anything,boy scout leadership seems OK with it
889893334738587648 2017-07-25 17:01:19 UTC <rbnewark> I thought scouts were about honor respect loyalty.. shameful behavior yesterday. Boy scouts R only 4 trumpers' kids these days-#unAmerican
889892819128664064 2017-07-25 16:59:16 UTC <rbnewark> If I still had kids in scouts I would immediately pull them out after that despicable display w trump, booing former pres & former boy scout
889891835803557888 2017-07-25 16:55:21 UTC <rbnewark> Like fatherinlaw, like soninlaw, lying comes easy, casual, forceful, repeating falsehoods- even under oath means nothing 2 them #lockthemup
889678174610575360 2017-07-24 02:46:20 UTC <rbnewark> Do Scouts know Trump was not a scout but Obama was?
889677864877948929 2017-07-24 02:45:07 UTC <rbnewark> Scouts support trump? He's immoral scum, and they think he's OK?! What does that say about Boy Scouts these days.what r they teaching them?

889651477341290496 2017-07-24 01:00:15 UTC <rbnewark> trump has no bottom 2 how low he will go working boy scouts like a campaign rally-despicable is too good 4 him
889650989057417216 2017-07-24 00:58:19 UTC <rbnewark> @cinemaven @JoyAnnReid Remember Hitler Youth-they started out like boy scouts until he politicized them & coopted their mission. Boy Scouts should B booing trump
889643337413795841 2017-07-24 00:27:55 UTC <rbnewark> Looking forward 2 see how Kushner fares in jail; I imagine he will B well received by his fellow inmates.
889642747203911681 2017-07-24 00:25:34 UTC <rbnewark> ignorance tho Kushner certainly has an abundance of that, is not a defense for committing a crime Kushner needs 2B #lockedup
889642217756905474 2017-07-24 00:23:28 UTC <rbnewark> typical trump tries 2 blame whipping girl hillary 2 deflect from his crimes. scaramucci fits right in in w den of inequity in WH #lockhimup

862091060075388928 2017-05-09 23:45:00 UTC <rbnewark> repugs find all sorts of way 2 cheat bc they cant win fair & square-always trying 2 limit voting rights, make it diff. 2 vote how unamerican
862090657468301312 2017-05-09 23:43:24 UTC <rbnewark> in free & fair elections like we have in Cali, dems always win. red states voting is biased towards preventing people from voting, corupt.

787706030503321601 2016-10-16 17:25:27 UTC <rbnewark> I think the final results of this election will b decisively against trump. Americans reject people like him, i have faith in America.
787703041097015296 2016-10-16 17:13:34 UTC <rbnewark> trump is a spoiled brat who cant handle losing and is blaming others for him being a very flawed person and candidate- thats the bottom line
787702597641654272 2016-10-16 17:11:48 UTC <rbnewark> trump is used to get his way , & now that he's losing hes acting like the spoiled brat he is and blaming everbody but himself
787702365889568768 2016-10-16 17:10:53 UTC <rbnewark> Good sportsmanship is an American value being trounced by the spoiled brats in republican party led by the biggest brat trump,
787701969821454336 2016-10-16 17:09:19 UTC <rbnewark> Nobody cares about the emails except that they were leaked by foreign actors they R political in nature.
787681197627281408 2016-10-16 15:46:46 UTC <rbnewark> how can CNN continue to put up this guy who is being paid by trump?!https://twitter.com/KevinDarryl/status/787677741302767616
787680877308280832 2016-10-16 15:45:30 UTC <rbnewark> Trumps going 2B worse than ISIS- more lives will be lost in America bc of his inflammatory rhetoric than what we've lost 2 ISIS DT=Evilman
787679750626037761 2016-10-16 15:41:01 UTC <rbnewark> Its not going 2 B pretty after election.  trump wiilB more of a threat than ISIS, hes encouraging domestic terrorism, & will only get worse
787679155689181188 2016-10-16 15:38:39 UTC <rbnewark> Still favorite clip on trump is DeNiro's rant. sums up the anger I feel to this dangerous clown 4 bringing our country to this precipice
787676165431435265 2016-10-16 15:26:46 UTC <rbnewark> Toward a more perfect union our Const. says Is trump doing that? No! is Hillary YES look at her slogan Stronger Together lets elect her!
787675096546578433 2016-10-16 15:22:31 UTC <rbnewark> It is sad whats happening to our country Evil is strong now trump is bringing us down, not sure whats going 2 happen next, hope waning
787674473654734848 2016-10-16 15:20:03 UTC <rbnewark> Hillary should b admired 4 working thru marital diffs, not vilified. Trump doesnt understand this concept bc he's bailed 2xs doesnt value it
787673635251032064 2016-10-16 15:16:43 UTC <rbnewark> There will often B challenges in most marriages, but Hillary has weathered those. Never had a divorced pres, let alone twice, keep streak
787672949323030528 2016-10-16 15:14:00 UTC <rbnewark> hillary has stuck 2 her marriage vows, even thru very tough times, trump has skipped out twice so far, 4 greener pastures, & cheated on them
787672313718120448 2016-10-16 15:11:28 UTC <rbnewark> trump has no credibility, hes never done anything 4 America in any way. He never even gave the 10K he promised 4 9/11 victims, hes 4 himself
787669135509430272 2016-10-16 14:58:50 UTC <rbnewark> @RepReneeEllmers @truth_trumpet @sheenA_8886 9 women? come on man, ever heard of where theres smoke theres fire? this is like Cosby !

787666543421390848 2016-10-16 14:48:32 UTC <rbnewark> Win or lose trumpism is going to ruin US. 1st of all he would B a terrible pres,  Followers say theyll revolt if he loses, wont pay taxes,
787664790894235649 2016-10-16 14:41:34 UTC <rbnewark> theres no rigged election, no more so than if trump was winning the election, hes a very flawed person & candidate and thats why hes losing
787664168463720448 2016-10-16 14:39:06 UTC <rbnewark> trump doesnt have the decency of a 10 year old who knows how 2 accept defeat graciously shakes hands and moves on. Rigged election? Come on!
787663775549632513 2016-10-16 14:37:32 UTC <rbnewark> with 4 kids I've been to 1000s of games, when games over, 1 loses 1 wins, but they R taught to shake hands either way. DT hasnt learned this
787663258152861697 2016-10-16 14:35:29 UTC <rbnewark> trump is a poor loser, he never has grown up and accept defeat graciously like most Americans, There's nothing gracious or decent about him
787662487978029057 2016-10-16 14:32:25 UTC <rbnewark> trump is a loser, in every sense of the word, morally, as an example 2 others as a candidate 4pres, those who continue 2 follow R going 2B 2
787661885470498816 2016-10-16 14:30:02 UTC <rbnewark> trump cant accept defeat what if players who lost a game cried like a baby like DT game was rigged its about fair play someone wins DT loses
787660896407396353 2016-10-16 14:26:06 UTC <rbnewark> trumps undermining our electoral process just because he's losing if he was winning there would B no rigged election of course antiAmerican
787660405820698624 2016-10-16 14:24:09 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is sore loser, but trouble is he's leading his followers off a cliff elections R not rigged, except by what he is trying to do
787659663659573248 2016-10-16 14:21:12 UTC <rbnewark> very irresponsible 4 trump 2 say election rigged now that media finally not giving him pass like 4 1st 15 months! Just a sore loser
787659245894238208 2016-10-16 14:19:32 UTC <rbnewark> The republicans keep talking about game changers. there r no more game changers. the electorate is pretty much baked each side 90% favors HC

785393871475777536 2016-10-10 08:17:45 UTC <rbnewark> Trumps vicious attacks worked with his alt right faction, but in the general election they R a minority doesnt work with the rest of US

784593662969778176 2016-10-07 03:18:00 UTC <rbnewark> We all know people like trump, sad men who depend on conquest of women 4 self-worth, but never as president! Most grow up.he never did.
784590974370578432 2016-10-07 03:07:19 UTC <rbnewark> Remember the republicans chose trump. U have 2 question their judgment/character in picking such a disaster We must vote out republicans

784565127806906368 2016-10-07 01:24:37 UTC <rbnewark> Trump doesnt have any Christian traits, he resembles the anti-Christ than anything, yet christians still support him #notreallychristains
784564435465666560 2016-10-07 01:21:52 UTC <rbnewark> If Popes could vote? No Pope, from Peter to Francis, would ever vote 4 a low life like trump, maybe not all 4 Hillary, but #nevertrump

783845622294073344 2016-10-05 01:45:34 UTC <rbnewark> R U listening Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin? Trump talks a good game but shows that he only cares 4 himself  uses Chinese steel
783831961403961344 2016-10-05 00:51:17 UTC <rbnewark> The family is foundational 2 healthy society. Sound families generally produce productive citizens Trumps hate speech is unhealthy 4 US fams
783829347744395265 2016-10-05 00:40:54 UTC <rbnewark> Trump rhetoric gives license to bad cops, he makes it OK to do whatever they want/abuse their position, one of many negatives of  trumpism
783825246419693569 2016-10-05 00:24:36 UTC <rbnewark> People love to dis Christians bc it makes them feel self righteous- see theyre not perfect- truth is nobody is, but  trying their best
783821719853109248 2016-10-05 00:10:35 UTC <rbnewark> I'm Catholic, and, as I'm sure many other Catholics feel, cannot abide Trump in no uncertain terms, he's evil incarnate & must B defeated
783821019890921472 2016-10-05 00:07:48 UTC <rbnewark> The morons on Catholic radio should keep opinions to themselves. They dont speak 4 Church. If Hitler were prolfe theyd vote 4him-trump same
783820382302121984 2016-10-05 00:05:16 UTC <rbnewark> Catholic radio should lose their nonprofit status they're blatantly supporting 1 candidate & then if U dont support him say U RNot Catholic
783294966709616640 2016-10-04 13:17:27 UTC <rbnewark> A foreign national playing part in election? we're approaching a pretty well set electorate aware of trumps tactics #onlyliesdirtytricks
783294044470255616 2016-10-04 13:13:47 UTC <rbnewark> The only acceptable result would B at least a 10 pt victory. Otherwise trump people will feel emboldened rather than discouraged/defeat
783292450945142784 2016-10-04 13:07:27 UTC <rbnewark> Not enough folks, we need to bury him and send a notice to republicans next time to give us a legitimate choice!https://twitter.com/ElmetsPR/status/783284031689412609

783166972972249088 2016-10-03 04:48:51 UTC <rbnewark> a few Bernie folks have some trumpian traits angry & delusional, like japanese soldiers in the jungle who refused to accept WWII was overhttps://twitter.com/SteveSchmitz2/status/783165709543100416
783165748210380800 2016-10-03 04:43:59 UTC <rbnewark> We're heading 4 possible ruin  as a nation, but the determination/perseverence of antitrump forces can turn the tide, & win the day allhands
783164761244446720 2016-10-03 04:40:04 UTC <rbnewark> I'm waiting for the hundredth monkey, when enuff courageous people realize theyve been wrong, trump should never B pres, then US can B saved
783161388726231040 2016-10-03 04:26:40 UTC <rbnewark> Remember that this whole trump nightmare caused by republicans. They felt trump was legit candidate! How incompetent R they?! #allrepsmustgo
783160746590871552 2016-10-03 04:24:07 UTC <rbnewark> When will we finally turn the corner on this nightmare phenomena trumpism. how much more info do people need to decide this guy is no bueno?
783160122902126592 2016-10-03 04:21:38 UTC <rbnewark> trump disses PSTD veterans. Never supports veterans, and all their sacrifice and accomplishments and heroism. He of 5 deferments, shameful
783159619677847552 2016-10-03 04:19:38 UTC <rbnewark> What would B an acceptable # 4 trump. I look to Detroit 4 the goal- 0% support 4 trump.Detroit shows its possible, keep pushing everybody
783158957426614272 2016-10-03 04:17:00 UTC <rbnewark> When the worm turns, and we reach the hundredth monkey, people will realize how unacceptable trump is, there will B a large # rejecting him
783158371671093248 2016-10-03 04:14:40 UTC <rbnewark> I'm not satisfied with the polls. It's terrible that trump has 40%. Its terrible that many people support scoundrel like trump, hoping 4 trn
783156928826388480 2016-10-03 04:08:56 UTC <rbnewark> What will it take 2 turn around a portion of the trump supporters? I think we're getting close. I think theyre getting fed up & embarrassed
783156415133208580 2016-10-03 04:06:54 UTC <rbnewark> When we reach the hundredth monkey, suddenly the tide will turn away from trump. I pray that this happens, 4 the sake of our country.
783155718442541056 2016-10-03 04:04:08 UTC <rbnewark> We havent reached the hundredth monkey when most Americans realize trump cannot ever B president. I think we're getting close next debate?

780962818120032256 2016-09-27 02:50:20 UTC <rbnewark> trump is the enemy of the people!  He's the fat cat bernie railed against   & almost won! he's the no tax paying jerk thats proud of it!

780959775857123328 2016-09-27 02:38:14 UTC <rbnewark> trump is a bad guy, thats enuff not 2 vote for, but add on top that he has no experience or qualif has mental health issues,#nowayJose
780958514420133888 2016-09-27 02:33:14 UTC <rbnewark> its sad to see people supporting a crackpot like trump who has no business being this close to the presidency. He is so damaging to America
780957895688978432 2016-09-27 02:30:46 UTC <rbnewark> I see children arent valued w the nihilism & narcissism rampant in our country  if people considered kids they would never vote trump
780957240329023488 2016-09-27 02:28:10 UTC <rbnewark> children are our hope our future. We need 2 treat them well & give them good examples 2 follow, does trump meet that standard, shame on us
780956738061078528 2016-09-27 02:26:10 UTC <rbnewark> I realize children R devalued today, w the abortion culture, but those of us who love kids R saddened of the affect trump has on our society
780956319507361792 2016-09-27 02:24:30 UTC <rbnewark> would u want your children to speak like trump does, treat people like he does, No, yet U want him to lead our country? makes no sense
780955876232302592 2016-09-27 02:22:45 UTC <rbnewark> what kind of example would trump B to the kids in our country. It seems like many people really dont care. Trump is awful role model
780955568060018688 2016-09-27 02:21:31 UTC <rbnewark> We shouldnt elect anyone that cant pass muster with children.They think Trumps a bad guy, kids see things thru unfiltered innocent eyes
780954173323915264 2016-09-27 02:15:59 UTC <rbnewark> trump is a shameful excuse 4 pres. How could they put up this ignoramous to lead their party? its shocking & scary he could get this far.
780953704170082304 2016-09-27 02:14:07 UTC <rbnewark> How trump gets any votes is a shameful statement about America. That a person of trumps character, values shames our country w other nations
780952712544264192 2016-09-27 02:10:10 UTC <rbnewark> Kids R more insightful than nearly half the US adults! they see right thru trump- calling him mean, a bully, That is enuff not 2 vote 4 him

780617109810270208 2016-09-26 03:56:36 UTC <rbnewark> Trump lies about Ford no loss of US jobs at all not 1000 and 1000's of jobs.  Also trump pays no taxes makes him smart Do you feel the same?

780605549515710465 2016-09-26 03:10:40 UTC <rbnewark> trump was unprepared tonight, very reactive, interrupted when she was making her point & going on & on ad nauseum with nonsense
780605144895324160 2016-09-26 03:09:04 UTC <rbnewark> i hope the bitter berners were watching, & can finally see that Hillary is the only choice. She did a great job tonight Very presidential

780599457423380481 2016-09-26 02:46:28 UTC <rbnewark> Trump was a totally unprepared oaf women hater who has no business being on that stage, period
780599138266157057 2016-09-26 02:45:12 UTC <rbnewark> trump is the worse possible candidate in the history of US and he showed it tonight
780598800368803840 2016-09-26 02:43:51 UTC <rbnewark> Hillary totally smoked trump he proved to be a moronic oaf
780598585788207105 2016-09-26 02:43:00 UTC <rbnewark> He's a women hater most of all the deplorable are happy, but decent Americans not impressed showed himself to be a rude belligerent oaf
780596163799941120 2016-09-26 02:33:22 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is a greedy SOB all he cares about the is the bottom line doesnt care about the world. Will no doubt start a war, involve youth
780593342908293120 2016-09-26 02:22:10 UTC <rbnewark> Samo Samo easy to take pot shots from the outside. Trump is a serial I told you so . Easy to second guess. Monday morning quarterback.

780582131047149569 2016-09-26 01:37:37 UTC <rbnewark> That makes him smart not paying taxes, actually it makes him a tax evador a felon and should be in jail
780573599052607489 2016-09-26 01:03:43 UTC <rbnewark> Trump lies so much they cant keep track of all them. This is the type of character we want in the white house. He'll say/do anything
780573007613861888 2016-09-26 01:01:22 UTC <rbnewark> trump would b as ruthless as hitler his opponents would suffer he would seek retribution, immigrants persecuted military & police enforce
780571931363856384 2016-09-26 00:57:05 UTC <rbnewark> Would you vote for hitler if he said he was prolife? Of course not.Same difference with trump he's got all the characteristics of a dictator

780569963681619968 2016-09-26 00:49:16 UTC <rbnewark> Did they invite the two young girls who trump raped 2 sit in the front row too? I hope so, it's the only way they're going 2 get any justice
780404832364400640 2016-09-26 13:53:05 UTC <rbnewark> Markets will tank if trump wins but his followers dont care about that. they must have money under their matress otherwise they lose too

778398313309626368 2016-09-20 00:59:54 UTC <rbnewark> Forces of evil R stronger now than probably evr B4 in US. Good people need to stand up and fight 4 our very existence We must defeat trump
778391860519645184 2016-09-20 00:34:16 UTC <rbnewark> lets not forget all of the ridiculous unthinking statements hes made there's nothing presidential about him. He could be putins successor
778391399309848576 2016-09-20 00:32:26 UTC <rbnewark> trump is still the same moronic bully he always was. nothing has changed I vote 4 him now is just as stupid as it ever was, its even worse
778391028092985345 2016-09-20 00:30:57 UTC <rbnewark> something drastic/dramatic needs to happen to change the course. Trump smells blood, like a pack of hyennas he & henchmen R moving in 4 kill

778112853001834496 2016-09-19 06:05:35 UTC <rbnewark> trump is like a petulant child who must have his way all the time & when he doesnt rants & has a tantrum. Time 2 grow up & lose like a man
778112452978507780 2016-09-19 06:04:00 UTC <rbnewark> Lets bury trump 1 way or another, a landslide would B sweet. Anything close would B contest by poor loser 1%er who always has 2 have his way

777537272430206980 2016-09-18 15:58:26 UTC <rbnewark> media gives trump a pass even former bastion of freedom of the press NYtimes is corrupt. It shouldnt happen in US #boycotttimes
777536492428111872 2016-09-18 15:55:20 UTC <rbnewark> media gives trump a pass- declare what he says w/o challenge even tho most is untrue/slanderous/devious they should work 4 ET not real news
777535249089605632 2016-09-18 15:50:23 UTC <rbnewark> Media gives trump a pass, doesnt hold him accountable 4 what he says accepts it as gospel 4 example trump saying pres birth OK is headline
777532524339744768 2016-09-18 15:39:34 UTC <rbnewark> the only thing the truth and trump have in common is they both begin with T. Truth is not an issue trump winning is this doesnt bother trump
777532123955679232 2016-09-18 15:37:58 UTC <rbnewark> trump lies constantly nothing he says has a basis in truth he says what is convenient only thing that matters is does it help their compaign

777529088709799936 2016-09-18 15:25:55 UTC <rbnewark> hitler scapegoated jews 4 problems/ trump blames minorities & appeals to hate groups we know what happen when hitler got elected, imagine if
777528615114113024 2016-09-18 15:24:02 UTC <rbnewark> hitler riled up hatred towards jews, trump does the same toward poor immigrants who have to hang out at home depot 4 work, hatred/scapegoat
777528198351368192 2016-09-18 15:22:22 UTC <rbnewark> hitlers life was a disaster, so he decided to run 4 pres of germany blaming jews 4 all their problems, sound familiar? this is trumps MO too
777527846839328769 2016-09-18 15:20:59 UTC <rbnewark> trump uses the word disastrous alot, its a word that describes what his presidency would B like if it follows rest of his life pers & prof
777527290313842688 2016-09-18 15:18:46 UTC <rbnewark> trump often uses disastrous, very limited vocab btw, when most of his dealings personally and professionally have been disastrous.
777526831763206145 2016-09-18 15:16:57 UTC <rbnewark> Often the vocab that one uses is a projection of themselves. Trump uses the word disastrous a lot a descriptor of trumps busin, marriag, etc

776577952255324160 2016-09-15 00:26:26 UTC <rbnewark> trump has bullied his way passed the republicans but he will not do so to Clinton. she has handled bullies, like putin & others #nevertrump
776577282378833920 2016-09-15 00:23:46 UTC <rbnewark> its not hard to embarrass trump because almost everything he says is embarrassing to our sensibilities.Nobody in this country has been worse

776574295963086848 2016-09-15 00:11:54 UTC <rbnewark> How low to blame our problems on the poor immigrant who's no threat to anyone & doing jobs nobody wants Immigrants built this country not DT

776572635127828481 2016-09-15 00:05:18 UTC <rbnewark> trump is negative, all about dividing, ugly comments & using tragedies 4 political gain, really despicable behavior unworthy of a president
776571952244809728 2016-09-15 00:02:36 UTC <rbnewark> Trump desecrates a baptist church by giving a political speech, bc he's never been  in a church & doesnt know how to act in one, but should
776570960921014272 2016-09-15 23:58:39 UTC <rbnewark> what trump says  & does is against Catholic values & promotes white supremacists He disparages our Pope, & spews hate speech #LoveTrumpsHate
776570135087685634 2016-09-15 23:55:22 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is anti american. he's against veterans, hes for antidemocratic Russia, he wants to build a wall, he's against minorities,hes pro war
776569235791159296 2016-09-15 23:51:48 UTC <rbnewark> trumps so dishonest.He hides his taxes he rips off his workers he takes advantage of tragedies he walks away owing others, his univ a fraud
776568442820235264 2016-09-15 23:48:39 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is antiCatholic. he is exact opposite of Catholic values. He brags, he divides the races, takes advantage of people instead of service
776309440081297408 2016-09-14 06:39:28 UTC <rbnewark> The trumps R so out of touch with America they dont realize that dems have tried to pass similar legis 4 years only to be blocked by reps!
776308835187167232 2016-09-14 06:37:04 UTC <rbnewark> Sound like trump supporters who never let the truth get in the way of a convenient lie.https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/775732400491868161
776284297548345344 2016-09-14 04:59:33 UTC <rbnewark> everything about him lacks integrity,class honesty & common decency. Watch film of hitler & trump compares favorablyhttps://twitter.com/cherokeesher2/status/776283712916951041
776283765085605888 2016-09-14 04:57:26 UTC <rbnewark> Yea that's the point, we want to see just how dishonest, greedy, and miserly he is we know thats Y hes not releasinghttps://twitter.com/IanSams/status/776253987725139969
776280421143224320 2016-09-14 04:44:09 UTC <rbnewark> trump/putin/hackers connection trying to rig the election in favor of trump- treason, & financial holdings would B a conflict of interest
776275003234881537 2016-09-14 04:22:37 UTC <rbnewark> there is nothing about trump that is fit 2 B pres. He's inexperience his tirades, tantrums 7 vitriol R not presidential his ideas R damaging
776274379936112640 2016-09-14 04:20:09 UTC <rbnewark> trumps doctor is a hippy quack he picks & chooses what he releases to the public about his health. like everything else about DT hes a phony
776273722999132160 2016-09-14 04:17:32 UTC <rbnewark> the deplorable thing was politically incorrect but quite accurate but Trump says 5-10 worse things almost everyday & the media lets hm skate
776272973330128896 2016-09-14 04:14:33 UTC <rbnewark> we would B much better off without a president than with trump as president. Trump is an insecure buffoon with no experience& very thin skin
776272377395109888 2016-09-14 04:12:11 UTC <rbnewark> Nobody would be a far better choice than Trump nobody could do no damage. Trump however would do plenty #alloutwaroverhandsignal #looscannon
776224844648067072 2016-09-14 01:03:19 UTC <rbnewark> If nobody was against trump & he was the only one on the ballot like Putin in his fav country russia I would vote 4 nobody& Nobody would win
776224014670831616 2016-09-14 01:00:01 UTC <rbnewark> Even if Hillary were in a coma, she would make a better president than trump. No president would B better than trump & the damage he'd cause
776223310812057600 2016-09-14 00:57:13 UTC <rbnewark> No matter what people, never forget the terrible things hes said & done this year against everyone. Presidential material? I dont think so
776222910688014336 2016-09-14 00:55:38 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is delusional to think that if he were in control nothing bad would ever have happened! This is so cowardly to look back at tragedies
776222068782211072 2016-09-14 00:52:17 UTC <rbnewark> Lets see if trump was in control, 9/11, Flint, basically nothing bad woud've happened! Who would believe that & its scary that he would!
776221585426423808 2016-09-14 00:50:22 UTC <rbnewark> It wouldve been perfect if trump controlled the world? He says if he were in charge this or that wouldnt have happened Anyone could say this
776220849556688898 2016-09-14 00:47:26 UTC <rbnewark> this election is a fight 4 the soul of America Trump represents a very dark element in our country that we must resist he is a false prophet
776220039611506688 2016-09-14 00:44:13 UTC <rbnewark> this election is basically coming down to good vs evil. trump is a very sinister character up to no good, and decent people realize this
776219658647052289 2016-09-14 00:42:42 UTC <rbnewark> The trump/putin/hacker connection is trying to influence the election. trump was right the election is rigged & he's rigging it! Be vigilant
776217856685936640 2016-09-14 00:35:33 UTC <rbnewark> If you call yourself humble, isnt that not being humble? just saying
775683529191501824 2016-09-13 13:12:19 UTC <rbnewark> @Lawrence @ShareblueMedia @LoisEiler O Donnell is a lone voice in the wilderness, he's the only one telling it like it is- even R M  buckled
775594453482430464 2016-09-13 07:18:22 UTC <rbnewark> trump continues to say or do anything to get elected. his message changes 5 times a day to see what resonates.
775594132093886465 2016-09-13 07:17:05 UTC <rbnewark> Clinto is the common sense reasonable candidate not perfect but she will be able to govern & lead us in the right direction. Trump is loony
775593635056201734 2016-09-13 07:15:07 UTC <rbnewark> Trump starts rumors & the press treats them as gospel, treating them as fact! Y dont they csll him out on the crazy stuff he says every day.
775592780278079488 2016-09-13 07:11:43 UTC <rbnewark> alex Jones is the leader of the basket, he is scary crazy and talks like a devil. He needs to be locked up in a white padded room

775591766745423873 2016-09-13 07:07:41 UTC <rbnewark> Clinton in  her worse condition is better than trump any day of the week. Trump is a 7o year old geyser that paints on his face every day.
775559045637890048 2016-09-12 04:57:40 UTC <rbnewark> Madrid delving into politics doesnt belong on Catholic radio. he's beginning to sound like Rush Linbaugh.
775558618892468224 2016-09-12 04:55:58 UTC <rbnewark> P Madrid should really stay out of areas like politics where he appears 2 know little. Trump doesnt represent Catholics as he should know
775518081627979776 2016-09-12 02:14:53 UTC <rbnewark> whatever U do, never forget all the rude, evil, crazy awful things trump has said & done, & then see if U can vote 4 such a scoundrel 4 pres

774507411499462656 2016-09-10 07:18:51 UTC <rbnewark> @Chris_Sherwood Boche's losing it. This has gone on way too long, especially with a bullpen full of lefties.

774460669911412736 2016-09-09 04:13:07 UTC <rbnewark> hitler would be very popular with trump supporters they both have the same strategy of scapegoating to angry racists, exactly what the want
774459882388885504 2016-09-09 04:09:59 UTC <rbnewark> i have a feeling if hitler were running in US this year scapegaoting jews for our problems, hed have most of trump supporters voting 4 him,
774459511755018240 2016-09-09 04:08:31 UTC <rbnewark> working for hillary now trying to swing nevada blue, will be tough, lots of white males that have to be flipped, may come to their senses

774456869976813568 2016-09-09 03:58:01 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is morally bankrupt, too. Everything he's accused hillary of hes guilty of now with pay to play scandal in Floriida Dirty lawyer there
774455697123647490 2016-09-09 03:53:21 UTC <rbnewark> Trump knows he could shoot somebody & his idiot followers would still vote him! He said that. Thats how lo he thinks of his loser supporters
774414544651157505 2016-09-09 01:09:50 UTC <rbnewark> could poor immigrants who cant speak english B taking jobs from Americans? another false premise or trumpism, people buy it hard 2 believe
774413604242141184 2016-09-09 01:06:05 UTC <rbnewark> trump blames poor immigrants 4 taking American jobs & committing crimes. He has no data to back up his accusations Again hitler like (notso)
774411079191363584 2016-09-09 00:56:03 UTC <rbnewark> Trump like hitler scapegoats people who cant defend themselves like poor immigrants who dont speak english well- despicable, & people buy it

774409029565067265 2016-09-09 00:47:55 UTC <rbnewark> Pam Bondi is a big part of this scandal and should face legal consequences, but as before trump is the corrupting influence. you want him?!
774408696013008896 2016-09-09 00:46:35 UTC <rbnewark> and this isnt as big as some emails- this is obviouse corruption. This should be brought every day until he explainshttps://twitter.com/peterdaou/status/774270144256348160

774405028102623232 2016-09-09 00:32:01 UTC <rbnewark> What kind of lowlife lies has to lie about 9/11? President worthy? I think not
774404544730046464 2016-09-09 00:30:05 UTC <rbnewark> More trump lies about 9/1. said he saw people jumpimg but his building is 4 mi away-impossible Said he was going to donate 10K but never did
774403679180861440 2016-09-09 00:26:39 UTC <rbnewark> Trump lied about 9/11. He lied that he lost 100's of friends but went 2ut no funerals. He saw Muslims cheering in NJ, but it didn't happen.
774239503930097664 2016-09-09 13:34:17 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump That's a bad look ,but not 4 a crook or a kook I guess, both of which you R so keep wearing the suit with the baseball hat

774133913803366400 2016-09-08 06:34:42 UTC <rbnewark> Trump likes putin because he has strong control over his country. We call that a dictator, which is not the way our country works

774056043018002432 2016-09-08 01:25:16 UTC <rbnewark> Can Trump read/?Would he be the first illiterate president? Haven't seen any evidence that he can read. The prompter could be an ear piece.
774055561411170304 2016-09-08 01:23:21 UTC <rbnewark> Trump prefers putin aligned with Iran and assad R these going 2 B our new friends? Trump  siding with terrorism over US at the moment
774054365514522624 2016-09-08 01:18:36 UTC <rbnewark> I know he can read his name & poll #'s, but can he read sentences, etc. Looks down syndrome to me, but I dont know if its been looked into
774053861757628416 2016-09-08 01:16:36 UTC <rbnewark> Can Trump read, or is someone in his ear. Needs to be researched, I dont believe he can. Did he graduate from school? did daddy get him thru
774053420504264704 2016-09-08 01:14:51 UTC <rbnewark> is dtrump down syndrome?  he has down syndrome facial features Nothing wrong with it, but what is his IQ? Can he read?  Could be high funcDS
774042651381239808 2016-09-08 00:32:03 UTC <rbnewark> Trump shows poor judgment at every turn he is wholly unqualified 4 the job His election would be a disaster.
774042059980234752 2016-09-08 00:29:42 UTC <rbnewark> Trumps comments about his briefing was inappropriate if not criminal. he should not receive anymore briefings if he used 4 political gain
774041315688321024 2016-09-08 00:26:45 UTC <rbnewark> After his security briefing he throws the US under the bus. This is treason and causing harm to our troops overseas. undermines military
774040819674198021 2016-09-08 00:24:47 UTC <rbnewark> Trump undermines our country with his comments & gives aid & comfort to the enemy. In the old days he would B brought before a firing squad
774040292269838336 2016-09-08 00:22:41 UTC <rbnewark> a trump presidency would lead to all out war. The draft would have 2 B instituted & many more of our young men would be dieing unnecessarily
774039805810180097 2016-09-08 00:20:45 UTC <rbnewark> Trumps foreign policy would destroy our country. His ideas are antiAmerican & antidemocratic & fascist in nature. We would quickly B at War

774037838115377152 2016-09-08 00:12:56 UTC <rbnewark> Trump has no concept of the rule of law. He has never followed the law, just throws an army of lawyers at over 3000 lawsuits
774037302569861120 2016-09-08 00:10:48 UTC <rbnewark> Trump doesnt have any experience why would vote 4 someone with no experience, his would be an autocratic rule which is against our democracy
774036602481807361 2016-09-08 00:08:01 UTC <rbnewark> McCain- Putin is murderer and thug Trump- wants to team up with putin, and assad? A sign of grave instability.

774009987165134848 2016-09-08 22:22:16 UTC <rbnewark> Abortion culture has led to the trump phenomena. Depravity, callousness & hate have permitted a person trump like trump 2 win. He's very bad
774009077244362752 2016-09-08 22:18:39 UTC <rbnewark> Even though I'm all in with Hillary, doesnt mean I support her views on abortion. I am prolife This is a large issue that affects all
773882878098706432 2016-09-08 13:57:10 UTC <rbnewark> the trump candidacy & that he's being considered  legitimate is an indictment on the values & character of Americanshttps://twitter.com/PuestoLoco/status/773866396761595904
773880921460084736 2016-09-08 13:49:24 UTC <rbnewark> Trump lacks understanding of world sit. His views R selfcentered & would have disastrous effects worldwide &in US #noexperience
773879899555717122 2016-09-08 13:45:20 UTC <rbnewark> Trumps association/affinity 4 dictators like Putin &Assad gives a preview of his foreign policy, abandoning allies in NATO 2 B w bad actors
773879038142062592 2016-09-08 13:41:55 UTC <rbnewark> Assad & putin R not the type of leaders we should be friends with. They R ruthless despots, i guess birds of a feather flock together
773876837898264576 2016-09-08 13:33:10 UTC <rbnewark> When trump says he supports putin he is supporting Assad regime also. this man has bombed & possibly gassed his own people to stay in power
773876353758138373 2016-09-08 13:31:15 UTC <rbnewark> Shame on the generals who support trumps use of war crimes htis isnt the way of civilized nations to give N2 barbaric acts #putintrumpassad

773871443679416320 2016-09-08 13:11:44 UTC <rbnewark> trump supports violation of US law he disregards all of putins actions against US & wants to work w this dangerous man- very poor judgment
773870960441163777 2016-09-08 13:09:49 UTC <rbnewark> Trump makes no mention of his buddys Putins attemps 2 hack N2  election systems in many states, so he & his generals support this terrorism
773865581611065344 2016-09-08 12:48:27 UTC <rbnewark> Corrupt is trumps middle name trying 2 buy the florida attorney genral 4 legal favors how bad is this? not presidential 4sure cant trust him

772486277614612480 2016-09-04 17:27:35 UTC <rbnewark> Trumps team is full of lowlifes who will use any tactics to get him elected. as they slip farther behind they get desperate & try anything
772485557444149248 2016-09-04 17:24:43 UTC <rbnewark> Why does Trump continue to hire criminals to work for him Balnnon abused his wife Bosso accused of using dirty tricks to try to elect G Bush
772475224486928385 2016-09-04 16:43:40 UTC <rbnewark> Obama worked to save the economy that was in crisis. since then hes received no cooperation from congress theyre the problem #votethebumsout
772474967376007168 2016-09-04 16:42:38 UTC <rbnewark> Its Tea partiers that white males should be angry at. they didnt do their job, playing politics. they should b fired.
772474383595999232 2016-09-04 16:40:19 UTC <rbnewark> All groups support hillary except 4 1, white males. We know theyre angry but their anger is misplaced. Its rep. Tea partiers who stopped gov
772474033719750656 2016-09-04 16:38:56 UTC <rbnewark> No candidate is perfect, but there is no real choice when it comes 2 experience, temperament & ability 2 govern. It's hillary Most know this
772473506927783936 2016-09-04 16:36:50 UTC <rbnewark> You may not agree with her, but we know she will listen to the oppos, view. Just ask rep Senators who worked with her. most R voting 4 her.
772473150202261504 2016-09-04 16:35:25 UTC <rbnewark> Nobody talks about the virtue of compromising only polarizing. find candidates willing to listen & compromise We have 1 Her name is Hillary
772472711884910593 2016-09-04 16:33:41 UTC <rbnewark> our government works best when there's compromise between the left and the right. the truth and whats best 4 US usually lies in the middle
772472451024379905 2016-09-04 16:32:38 UTC <rbnewark> the tea parties R really the reason our gov isnt working theyve blocked every good thing the gov tried to do. There was no compromise.
772472184740511744 2016-09-04 16:31:35 UTC <rbnewark> Its crazy to even imagine electing trump with no experience to be president. Look how bad the tea partiers were with no experience.
772471860252463104 2016-09-04 16:30:17 UTC <rbnewark> Trump will do anything to get attention. He has no qualifications to be pres! U wouldnt hire someone wi no experience to be head of business
772471013913210880 2016-09-04 16:26:56 UTC <rbnewark> Trump needs attention. Its a sickness, that's why he has so many unnecessary rallies & press conferences. Megalomaniacs are like that-Hitler
772468248914767872 2016-09-04 16:15:56 UTC <rbnewark> The left needs to abandon CNN they are slanting right, alt. right. Even CBS & other mainstreams are more balanced in their reporting

772463410441183232 2016-09-04 15:56:43 UTC <rbnewark> People of Trumps ilk don't deserve a position of honr. He has no integrity or redeeming qualities to represent America.
772462998900215808 2016-09-04 15:55:05 UTC <rbnewark> He's worse than an abulance chaser, turning all tragedies to try his political gain. Please defeat him soundlyhttps://twitter.com/mediccaptfm/status/772244098652647424

772461955076403200 2016-09-04 15:50:56 UTC <rbnewark> Where was he after 911? Nowhere to be found. Clinton was there helping the victims, doing what she could as Senator. https://twitter.com/Honey17011/status/772239434511155200

772186393451737088 2016-09-03 21:35:57 UTC <rbnewark> U Trumpers R not reps, most reps voted against DT. U R more like the knownothing party An outlier, an aberration Dont u know anything?!

772179360094703616 2016-09-03 21:08:00 UTC <rbnewark> Trumps campaign team is made up of dark characters who operate  without restrictions legally or morally .https://twitter.com/RealMuckmaker/status/771474266378244096
772177434942726145 2016-09-03 21:00:21 UTC <rbnewark> @Krighton_ Its a free country or did U forget tht or dont like it. Prefer a dictator like trump who will tell u what to do and what u like.
772177090070274048 2016-09-03 20:58:59 UTC <rbnewark> @Krighton_ i am talking to Americans but trumpers are not true Americans, their values are more like ISIS when you lose lots will go there
772175139362344960 2016-09-03 20:51:14 UTC <rbnewark> Trump will continue to try to fake his way thru he will thro everything at us & C what sticks. Dont believe any of it. #nothingbutlies
772174043357163520 2016-09-03 20:46:52 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is your classic bully He bullied his way thru primary with nothing but insults and bluster. Doesnt work in the general not enuf idiots
772173135281987584 2016-09-03 20:43:16 UTC <rbnewark> Trump followers love the wall do they know why? no, but if trump likes it must be good. I have not heard 1 reason why the wall would B good
772144099348537344 2016-09-03 18:47:53 UTC <rbnewark> the republicans cynically keep old stories going when theres nothing there and thats all cnn talks about. CNN worse than fox #boycottCNN
772143444680581120 2016-09-03 18:45:17 UTC <rbnewark> @B_L_Mencken Im sorry you got me after i reread i quickly deleted them sorry again. Maybe I should be voting 4 trump if Im that dumb!
772143063900618752 2016-09-03 18:43:46 UTC <rbnewark> Luckily most people dont listen 2 hate radio like Rush L.& arent duped by trumps phony pitches. a wall is only symbol 4 keep immigrants out
772142525616263168 2016-09-03 18:41:38 UTC <rbnewark> Trump thinks everyone is like the idiots who listen to talk radio. We're not! we can see through all the BS. those are his base constuents.
772142161005416448 2016-09-03 18:40:11 UTC <rbnewark> It s really sad to listen to his hollow words when his history shows hes been against blacks the whole time. How stupid does he think they R
772141815579291648 2016-09-03 18:38:49 UTC <rbnewark> trump at black church looking for more sign ups for trump university so he can take advantage and offer nothing. He's really shoveling it
772134916872036352 2016-09-03 18:11:24 UTC <rbnewark> Ex Pres Mexican friend Vicente Fox expressed the majority of Americans sentiments exactly- We dont like him we dont want him we reject him
772134344055894017 2016-09-03 18:09:07 UTC <rbnewark> Trump in a Chriistian church No wonder nobody wanted 2 give witness 2 that. He'ill say/do anything 2 get a vote Luckily blacks see thru him
772133524992167936 2016-09-03 18:05:52 UTC <rbnewark> Im prolife but trump is no prolife advocate. if they cant vote he disregards them such as poor, homeless, disabled, sick all the vulnerable
772133424127541249 2016-09-03 18:05:28 UTC <rbnewark> Even the Pope, an obvious prolife advocate has spoken out against Trump. Trump is against everything we believe in as Catholics- #faceofevil
772132985067802624 2016-09-03 18:03:43 UTC <rbnewark> the womens movement has been misguided in one area abortion this is a human rights issue. trump has not said a word in support of the unborn
772132634407251969 2016-09-03 18:02:20 UTC <rbnewark> We have been a nation that tries to pick up those who've been left behind, from Roosevelt to Kennedy, Johnson Carter- all dems reps R 4 rich
772131625459036161 2016-09-03 17:58:19 UTC <rbnewark> ISIS and Trumpers are both dangerous. Both are antiamerican and R threat to safety. Trumpers Rnt violent yet, but will be when they lose big
772130835365363712 2016-09-03 17:55:11 UTC <rbnewark> Trumpers and ISIS followers both believe anything their leaders tell them. they've lost themselves. Each needs 2 B  deprogrammed to be saved
772130227401035776 2016-09-03 17:52:46 UTC <rbnewark> trump followers & !S!S recruits R alike. ISIS see Christians as evil trumpers see the people in front of home depot as a threat.Both R duped
772129496757440512 2016-09-03 17:49:52 UTC <rbnewark> Please dont be fooled by trump he really isnt interested in anything but winning, which would be a big mistake, not only be/c of his views
772129178619551744 2016-09-03 17:48:36 UTC <rbnewark> trump gives them someone to blame 4 their problem- the poor guys waiting out in front of home depot thats your enemy? he's taking your jobs?
772128784765988864 2016-09-03 17:47:02 UTC <rbnewark> Who is against trump- women, minorities, educated, all dems, growing # of reps, who's left for trump- white males with a chip on shoulder
772127688546844672 2016-09-03 17:42:41 UTC <rbnewark> The smartes group kids - 100% aginst trump 2nd place blacks 97% against trump last place white males
772127390185066496 2016-09-03 17:41:29 UTC <rbnewark> The only grp trump appeals to are real base talk radio haters who believe all the evil stuff he promotes. They went from rush to trump
772126748632723457 2016-09-03 17:38:56 UTC <rbnewark> Where are u going to find any black supporters? they are way too smart for that. Try some white supremacist church it will full to the brim
772125881338765312 2016-09-03 17:35:30 UTC <rbnewark> The only consistent with trump is the wall & theres no way its being built. I guarantee it. The first & best reason is hes going 2 lose big
772124213465395201 2016-09-03 17:28:52 UTC <rbnewark> People have not thought this through. the wall is an impractical ineffective idea that would be a colossal waste of money
772123549293158400 2016-09-03 17:26:14 UTC <rbnewark> Why would anyone want to build a wall when the problem is people already here? that's why weve deported over 2 mil people during obamas term
772123127056707584 2016-09-03 17:24:33 UTC <rbnewark> Net immigration with Mexico is approaching zero. they dont take our jobs, but jobs most americans dont want. The wall is a waste of money.
772122555461177344 2016-09-03 17:22:17 UTC <rbnewark> the wall is a really stupid idea, impractical, ineffective, and more patrols needed to prevent vandalism.
772122237314838528 2016-09-03 17:21:01 UTC <rbnewark> Trumps hires known dirty tricks convict. The ends justify the means. One thing for sure, it will more & bigger lies. G Bush disavowed him
772121141901074433 2016-09-03 17:16:40 UTC <rbnewark> More criminals join Trump team. convicted dirty tricks ex con joins trump team to take down hillary. we have to be relentless, vigilant
771871723054510080 2016-09-02 00:45:34 UTC <rbnewark> If we could knock out Rush along with trump and fox, the unholy trio, our country would become a better place without all the hate speech
771871167015628801 2016-09-02 00:43:21 UTC <rbnewark> As I see it kids R the smartest 100% against Trump blacks 2nd-93% against trump the stupidest group by far-white males favor him! #imashamed
771870247913607168 2016-09-02 00:39:42 UTC <rbnewark> Trump demise will be a great victory 4 freedom & decency in America I hope the country comes around to how blacks see him 7% favorable rate
771869338022187008 2016-09-02 00:36:05 UTC <rbnewark> I hope they realize hillary will not build the wall, as no sane person would! What a colossal waste of money that would not help the problem
771868999780929537 2016-09-02 00:34:44 UTC <rbnewark> The wall is trumpers fantasy. the idea of idea of it makes their miserable lives a little less miserable. When no wall is built, watch out1
771868571320197120 2016-09-02 00:33:02 UTC <rbnewark> how lame of an idea the wall is, it'll never fly. It's a simple solution for simpleminded people. Its a rallying cry for the haters of us
771867701115428864 2016-09-02 00:29:35 UTC <rbnewark> Has anybody really though about the logistics of building a 1500 mi wall? the cost, and for what? It'll never happen. I guarantee it!
771866701675663360 2016-09-02 00:25:36 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is setting up our country for War, if not against an outside force, then against ourselves. Trump cant accept losing nor will Trumpers
771865607532752897 2016-09-02 00:21:16 UTC <rbnewark> Think about just how moronic the idea is of a wall It wont solve the problem. Elect Trump you wouldnt need a wall, people will be leaving.
771864801697943552 2016-09-02 00:18:03 UTC <rbnewark> The wall is really a stupid idea. Does any other modern country have a wall? Trump again will take us back to the cold war. #nosteenkingwall
771863964170891264 2016-09-02 00:14:44 UTC <rbnewark> Its amazing how kids R smarter than some adolts esp Trumpers Kids say we shouldnt build walls between countries, We should be friends
771862643896266752 2016-09-02 00:09:29 UTC <rbnewark> Kids can see through Trump. 100% rejection of him in my class. comments were he's mean, he insults people, he'll start WWIII, we'll move
771862156606177280 2016-09-02 00:07:33 UTC <rbnewark> The majority of Americans share Mexico former president V. Fox feelings about Trump- We don't like him. We don't want him. We reject him.
771861136232722432 2016-09-02 00:03:30 UTC <rbnewark> Turmp and Fox gone! Alleluiia!https://twitter.com/RealMuckmaker/status/771777739019784192
771703332507312128 2016-09-02 13:36:26 UTC <rbnewark> If Rachel Maddow is so horrified over trump as she should be, Y did she faun over conway giving his candidacy  the air of legitimacy
771586698186678272 2016-09-01 05:52:58 UTC <rbnewark> Trump followers must be so proud 2 B on the side of Putin, North Korea, the KKK and ISIS all also support Trump. TrueAmericans(NOT!)
771586178772381696 2016-09-01 05:50:55 UTC <rbnewark> CNN has gone to all right and now the Alt right News Network . they give more coverage to Trump surrogates than Clinton herself. BOYCOTTCFNN
771583992776695809 2016-09-01 05:42:13 UTC <rbnewark> ISIS says Trump would be a boon to their recruiting. ISIS is hoping Trump gets elected
771582375608262656 2016-09-01 05:35:48 UTC <rbnewark> It's unanimous!!! All of enemies want Trump! KKK, ISIS and Putin all want Trump 2 B President. trumpers know that theyre are on your side!
771579765404737537 2016-09-01 05:25:25 UTC <rbnewark> Americans arent rabid racists there is a rep faction that voted solidly to elect trump. but is a small group not even majority of reps
771577644370436101 2016-09-01 05:17:00 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump @maketrumpgoaway Walls?! Walls!? We dont need no steenking walls! there will be no wall! I guarantee it!

771573669751431172 2016-09-01 05:01:12 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is the anti candidate. We have nothing to fear but Trump himself. Donald, we''re not going to build a wall. I guarantee it.1

771565167192576001 2016-09-01 04:27:25 UTC <rbnewark> Trump even lies in other countries. Send him to space that the only place he hasn't lied yet. #stupidpeoplebelivehimhttps://twitter.com/RealMuckmaker/status/771142099911618560

771556089917648897 2016-09-01 03:51:21 UTC <rbnewark> @Nikluk Limbaugh and those of his ilk are the people who led to the demise of this country, first with the Tea Party and now with Trump
771554074453872640 2016-09-01 03:43:20 UTC <rbnewark> Trump does not care about anybody especially his supporters. the only reason he likes the is they are voting for him.
771551284004397056 2016-09-01 03:32:15 UTC <rbnewark> Amenhttps://twitter.com/HolyFaceCarmel/status/755370445147340800
771549791750754307 2016-09-01 03:26:19 UTC <rbnewark> Trump's a loose cannon literally &figuratively.he doesnt realize the effect his words & actions have worldwide impa #noexperienceisdangerous
771548417923305472 2016-09-01 03:20:52 UTC <rbnewark> Time to expand our twitter world people. We need to go out there and follow people who dont agree with us and dialogue
771547738932518912 2016-09-01 03:18:10 UTC <rbnewark> a vote 4 Trump is a vote 4 fear, loathing, division, despair & anger. Trump does not represent the best of America but the worst. He's lost
771546908414271488 2016-09-01 03:14:52 UTC <rbnewark> Hope is opposite of Trumps' message hope is his enemy. Hopeful people are his opponents. dont give in to his despair, fear & loathing behope
771546394712682497 2016-09-01 03:12:49 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is the classic fear mongerer. He tries to paint a violent/ crime ridden picture, but its not most Americans' experience so he'll lose
771545515267809280 2016-09-01 03:09:20 UTC <rbnewark> Trump works on our fears, trying to scare people into voting for him. worked with republicans, but dems are smarter than that He'll lose big
771545102011342848 2016-09-01 03:07:41 UTC <rbnewark> OK people it's time to expand our base like trump is doing. We're getting a lot of the same people. Time to expand our twittershere!
771544326870487044 2016-09-01 03:04:36 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is anti christian I hope  evangelicals know. He calls them chumps for believing. He's too cynical to believe in anything but himself
771543972669902848 2016-09-01 03:03:12 UTC <rbnewark> Trump main message is fear, fear and loathing is secondary. He paints a dark picture with him as the Savior. there's only one Savior, Jesus
771543629483520002 2016-09-01 03:01:50 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is trying to scare everybody into voting for him But like FDR so wisely put, i paraphrase We have nothing to fear but Trump himself
771542896650498049 2016-09-01 02:58:55 UTC <rbnewark> There's so much at stake it exhaustinghttps://twitter.com/TearsInHeaven09/status/771541464211820544
771541492397551616 2016-09-01 02:53:20 UTC <rbnewark> Ever heard of a tunnel a plane  a boat, what are you going to do about that you moron https://twitter.com/Info54015797Tux/status/771541159826993156
771535093965869056 2016-09-01 02:27:55 UTC <rbnewark> @Nikluk Your my hero! Hitting rush Limbaugh! excellent. He's part of the cause of the Trump phenomena with his hate speech
771530351227179009 2016-09-01 02:09:04 UTC <rbnewark> Amen to that!https://twitter.com/adbridgeforth/status/771479405768085504
771516041499283456 2016-09-01 01:12:13 UTC <rbnewark> What's this waiting for? time to join the bandwagon out of the Trump camp and join the winning side.https://twitter.com/DynaMoChen/status/771511925922553860
771515659415015424 2016-09-01 01:10:41 UTC <rbnewark> Nobody but the true believers R buying what trump says He continues to beat the dead horse of immig but these poor people arent the problem
771514013616267264 2016-09-01 01:04:09 UTC <rbnewark> angry white males believe everything trump says because he gives them scapegoats for their problems. Hitler did the same thing.
771513298600628224 2016-09-01 01:01:19 UTC <rbnewark> Trump said awhile ago he could get a segment of the republ because they werent that smart He was right. He's got them wrapped around finger
771512062459596800 2016-09-01 00:56:24 UTC <rbnewark> Trumps followers are a lost cause. Nothing can pry them away from Trump. Like he said earlier, he knew he could easily deceive them and has.
771508216337268736 2016-09-01 00:41:07 UTC <rbnewark> Trump continues to pander to the fears & darker angels of Americans. It's a cynical ploy trying to falsely blame poor immigrants 4 our ills.
771507143761465344 2016-09-01 00:36:51 UTC <rbnewark> Trump says our military is weak. I wonder what our soldiers think about that. Kind of an insult. How about veterans. How many more insults?
771506413214445568 2016-09-01 00:33:57 UTC <rbnewark> Of course Mexico will never pay for the wall. Everybody knows you cant force a foriegn government to pay for something without going to war.
771505628887953408 2016-09-01 00:30:50 UTC <rbnewark> Trump always plays loose with the facts, but immigration from Mexico isnt the crisis he depicts and Obama has been deporting illegals- 2 mil
771505286574026753 2016-09-01 00:29:28 UTC <rbnewark> Trump continues to divide our country into camps. The antiimmigrant has always been with us, but he has whipped up emotions to a fever pitch
771503301825220608 2016-09-01 00:21:35 UTC <rbnewark> Trump rallies are not an indication of how Americans think. Most Americans R horrified by Trumpsi nflammatory and discriminatory rhetoric.
771502510804574208 2016-09-01 00:18:27 UTC <rbnewark> Trump says Eisenhower didnt go far enough.He didnt kill enough people trying to deport people in box cars thru the desert? Savage statement
771448523082522624 2016-09-01 20:43:55 UTC <rbnewark> @ckkoch3 I know it puzzles me 2! They must be living in a cave. If they're living in a cave they must be Trump supporters so dont tell them
771187308036972544 2016-08-31 03:25:56 UTC <rbnewark> Threats to Mexico, that's not making friends with our neighbors.
771185622551711746 2016-08-31 03:19:15 UTC <rbnewark> Trump's popularity is an indictment of our country. Luckily there's a majority of decent fair minded people who will defeat him.
771184866285068288 2016-08-31 03:16:14 UTC <rbnewark> Trump even lied about what he talked about with the president of Mexico what is his % of lieing-it has to be 80-90% They did talk about wall
771181084495130625 2016-08-31 03:01:13 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is dangerous like Hitler was because he is charasmatic and many people are either gullable, dumb or just plain bad, like Duke.
771180447485210624 2016-08-31 02:58:41 UTC <rbnewark> Most in the media are cowards, especiall on CNN because they want to keep their jobs. Few are willing to put inthe work and push the issue.
771180095541121024 2016-08-31 02:57:17 UTC <rbnewark> Trump not revealing taxes means hes hiding something damaging. what could ib. we'll never out because the media never challenges him on it!
771179736613523456 2016-08-31 02:55:51 UTC <rbnewark> Not revealing his taxes speaks to his deception and disdain of hard working Americans. He knows he doesn't have because nobody's demandin it
771179173838594052 2016-08-31 02:53:37 UTC <rbnewark> think about it . why wouldn't trump reveal his taxes. Because he probably pays less than you and me, if you're a working stiff like me.
771178836314640385 2016-08-31 02:52:17 UTC <rbnewark> Trump blames Mexicans for many of our problems but that is not the case. Our problems are more caused by rich people like Trump not paying.
771178385145856001 2016-08-31 02:50:29 UTC <rbnewark> Some Mexicans immigrants  struggle to live here with low paying jobs and high cost of living and decide to return net immigration about 0
771177982723362816 2016-08-31 02:48:53 UTC <rbnewark> Trump ignores the facts of recent studies that find the net immigration with Mexico is about 0. Many return to Mexico some are deported 2mil
771177585434689536 2016-08-31 02:47:18 UTC <rbnewark> a wall will not solve the problem either. people find other ways to come as long as there is work and poor life in Mexico . But many return
771176757965705216 2016-08-31 02:44:01 UTC <rbnewark> Getting rid of Mexicans is a simplistic answer, scapegoating. Hitlers big trick. No 1 is going to rush to take their hard, low paying jobs
771175954269941760 2016-08-31 02:40:49 UTC <rbnewark> Mexicans are not causing all the problems in this country. Those who come  take menial jobs noone else wants, laborers farmworkers, etc.
771175275107278848 2016-08-31 02:38:07 UTC <rbnewark> All of Trump supporters are still white. It's embarrassing being white that we are so easily duped into his lies. This is not America.
771174715587047427 2016-08-31 02:35:54 UTC <rbnewark> All our problems will go away because Mexicans are kicked out. Just like when Trump is defeated in Nov our problems will not go away.
771174210840309760 2016-08-31 02:33:54 UTC <rbnewark> He's scapegoating Mexicans. It's all their fault drugs jobs crime all because of Mexicans. Again not the case.
771173804496171008 2016-08-31 02:32:17 UTC <rbnewark> Trying to blame all our problems on Mexicans. Not the case. Net immigration with those coming and going is about 0.
771173507979812865 2016-08-31 02:31:06 UTC <rbnewark> Trump paints a dark picture. Most of what he says is already being done. If people are caught they are deported.
771173105179906048 2016-08-31 02:29:30 UTC <rbnewark> We're proud of our country. There are plenty of people succeeding today.
771172747451899904 2016-08-31 02:28:05 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is using big words now. Obama has deported over two million people. Do they know that.
771172495445532673 2016-08-31 02:27:05 UTC <rbnewark> Most people do come into our country legally. Most immigrants are hardworking people.
771171525965721600 2016-08-31 02:23:14 UTC <rbnewark> Deport Trump. That would solve part of the problem, but what to do with his Psycho racists. they need to be locked up.
771170284162326539 2016-08-31 02:18:18 UTC <rbnewark> His supporters are more rabid there. its the heat there that cooks their little brains. https://twitter.com/puppymnkey/status/771163060337676288
771168772791033857 2016-08-31 02:12:17 UTC <rbnewark> Donald there's hop 4 you yet! but your time is running out! the year of Mercy ends the 1st week of Advent. After that all bets are off!
771168270854475776 2016-08-31 02:10:18 UTC <rbnewark> Not that anyone cares anymore about the facts, but from 2006-2010 the net pop change of immigration with Mexico was estimated to be 0
771167163436576768 2016-08-31 02:05:54 UTC <rbnewark> Deport Trump!
771166531757547521 2016-08-31 02:03:23 UTC <rbnewark> lie,lie,lie,lie,lie,lie. Will people ever learn, everything he says is for effect & that's it. Trump says? Come on!https://twitter.com/larry411/status/771164111254138880

770842051227246592 2016-08-30 04:34:01 UTC <rbnewark> Trump has uncovered a festering sore on the soul of America simmering just beneath the surface. He must be defeated to save our country.

770839122713817088 2016-08-30 04:22:23 UTC <rbnewark> Trump should hire is doctor as his new campaign manager. He will certainly let him do whatever he wants.
770838727094472706 2016-08-30 04:20:48 UTC <rbnewark> He's going to Mexico to look for a new campaign manager. He's to offer a ransom for el Chapo. He would fit right inhttps://twitter.com/rbnewark/status/770838113350324224

770756977664208896 2016-08-30 22:55:58 UTC <rbnewark> Trump makes Machiavelli look like a wide-eyed idealist. Bad news is the only thing he has going for him Without it he'd have nothing to say
770756532036182016 2016-08-30 22:54:11 UTC <rbnewark> Trump must be disappointed that we're killing ISIS leaders & taking territory. He depends on tragedies, and bad news to boost his numbers

770489622132654081 2016-08-29 05:13:35 UTC <rbnewark> whatever idea will sell, trump will say it. Hes a whore 4 your vote. Tell him what you want and he'll say it. He doesnt believe any of it.
770488801542144000 2016-08-29 05:10:19 UTC <rbnewark> Conway is another fast talker like the rest of the Trump bunch, a common practice of liars. they dont believe what theyre saying #getitover
770487696884129793 2016-08-29 05:05:56 UTC <rbnewark> What has trump done 4 the prolife movement. Something less than nothing- no comment ormoney. So if thats your only issue 4 him, good luck.
770486325950705664 2016-08-29 05:00:29 UTC <rbnewark> How can evangelicals vote for a morally corrupt man such as this? He's antiChristian in many ways! You might as well vote 4 thedevil himself
770485361097187328 2016-08-29 04:56:39 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is not prolife.He never speaks about it & has never done a thing about it. It's not a concern of his. It's merely a ploy to get votes
770484522135785472 2016-08-29 04:53:19 UTC <rbnewark> Come on white males look at your black brothers.they see through Trump. He'd be really bad for our country. I'm praying for your conversion

770465433589874688 2016-08-29 03:37:28 UTC <rbnewark> Trump wont do any of this, he wont unite us he will not work with our allies, he wont include all Americans he is the opposite of Hillary
770464968714100736 2016-08-29 03:35:37 UTC <rbnewark> Hillary will be a leader of us all, someone who our allies will work with. Not with evil doers like Putin or Un, but our allies.

770462824460017664 2016-08-29 03:27:06 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is a divider, Hillary is a uniter. Trump want to take us backward, Hillary wants to move forward toward a brighter future

770459718569472000 2016-08-29 03:14:46 UTC <rbnewark> Trump contradicts himself at least 20 times a day. He should try his suggestion. He's downgraded our country so muchhttps://twitter.com/JoyAnnReid/status/770454153525157889
770458647558107136 2016-08-29 03:10:30 UTC <rbnewark> trump cares no more 4 the unborn than he does for any oppressed group-  one group he supports is white nationalists, trying to fool the rest

770450367221932032 2016-08-29 02:37:36 UTC <rbnewark> Trumps hidden message is only white lives matter. Even his appeal to blacks to get urban whites to vote 4 him. cynical ploy #dontfall4it
770449933694492672 2016-08-29 02:35:53 UTC <rbnewark> Listen to Kaepernick speak. He has a point from his perspective as a young black man with all the killing of unarmed blacks by police.

769917472036179969 2016-08-28 15:20:04 UTC <rbnewark> donating money is a good thing that does good work- end of story. what does that have to do with being secretary of state? nothing.

769902072644767746 2016-08-28 14:18:52 UTC <rbnewark> @TearsInHeaven09 Coke is too light of an addiction to compare how strong his is. I would go with Meth, I mean look at his hair
769900910159945728 2016-08-28 14:14:15 UTC <rbnewark> Trumpers are scum of the earth. they have everything this country has to offer, but want to keep 4 themselves, deny access to others
769900494126931973 2016-08-28 14:12:36 UTC <rbnewark> Trumpers want to cut the flag in half and deny what it stands 4 to 1/2 of Americans. What Kapernick does is not nearly so bad in comparison
769900078530048000 2016-08-28 14:10:57 UTC <rbnewark> Trump followers are worst kind of flag dishonorers Our flag represents life leberty & p of h, yet they want to deny these 4 1/2 of Americans
769899364399456256 2016-08-28 14:08:07 UTC <rbnewark> Kat Pierson & lowendowski should get married. It would be a match made in hell.  both so angry, dont listen, spew hate & R true believers
769898657206329344 2016-08-28 14:05:18 UTC <rbnewark> the stars & bars is equal to the Nazi sign or the ISIS black flag. they all represent awful things- slavery, prejudice and terrorism.
769897302668349440 2016-08-28 13:59:55 UTC <rbnewark> Compared to what Kapernick does, waving the stars and bars is way worse. Kap is expressing his constitutional rights, however stupid.
769896912291897344 2016-08-28 13:58:22 UTC <rbnewark> I see more stars & bars at Trump rallies than US flags. The confederate flag is despicable. It represents what's wrong with this country now
769896110705868800 2016-08-28 13:55:11 UTC <rbnewark> Trumpers spit on our flag everyday they support their racist candidate Nothing is more unAmerican than that. Compared to Kap-  way worse
769895358033858560 2016-08-28 13:52:11 UTC <rbnewark> Trumpers desecrate flag every day They're flag is the stars & bars that we defeated at such a high cost in Civil War Trumpers R unAmerican
769894587594711040 2016-08-28 13:49:08 UTC <rbnewark> Yes kapernick dishonors the flag. But Trump supporters do it everyday. bigotry is unAmerican. It's like cutting flag in half.

769669475784286212 2016-08-27 22:54:37 UTC <rbnewark> theres no easy solution to the racial question, After the election, when trump loses big, it will become worse as Trumpers feel wronged
769668450566311938 2016-08-27 22:50:33 UTC <rbnewark> Theres a sickness in our country that trump exposed, & at its core its racial. Trump didn't cause it but hes promoting it. #LoveTrumpsHate

769592108038500352 2016-08-27 17:47:11 UTC <rbnewark> Mr. Pierce says it wisely. Trump has normalized hate groups, & media has normalized Trump. Trumps crazy statements not challenged

769551783177760769 2016-08-27 15:06:57 UTC <rbnewark> A foundation does good. Why R y'all opposed to that. The Clinton foundation was even supported by Trump! Get a life people!
769551314321707008 2016-08-27 15:05:05 UTC <rbnewark> more evidence of the white trash that love all the hate the Trump spews. Our country is being ruined bc of these people& their leader Trump
769550510328127488 2016-08-27 15:01:53 UTC <rbnewark> Trump tries to make poiltical gain over a tragic death. How low can you go. #thereisnobottom4Trump
769549904460984320 2016-08-27 14:59:29 UTC <rbnewark> @realDoneldTrump Its terrible that you would try 4 political from a tragedy like this, but then thats par 4 the course 4 U #scumoftheearth
769548317768294402 2016-08-27 14:53:11 UTC <rbnewark> I am against Trump, bc Clinton tho flawed on some issues, is the better choice in every way. Trump in his own words would be a disaster
769547600206794752 2016-08-27 14:50:20 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump @monicasloves @mcuban Chump change 4 someone supposedly wealthy. May be he's not, or may be he's more like Mr. Scrooge.
769546916510076928 2016-08-27 14:47:37 UTC <rbnewark> Some people say dont vote. thats wrong. That leads to the worst candidate Clinton has experience, leadership, and support around the world
769546403639025664 2016-08-27 14:45:34 UTC <rbnewark> I dont believe in abortion. I think it is an abomination But Trump is such an extreme negative obviously i could never vote 4 him #ImWithHer
769544853428445184 2016-08-27 14:39:25 UTC <rbnewark> Clinton is a uniter. She is for helping those in need- children, those in need of health care, those who are impovershed.
769544146700775424 2016-08-27 14:36:36 UTC <rbnewark> @FoL2009 @JoshSchwerin Its despicable that Trump would use someone's tragic death fro his own political gain
769543679375581185 2016-08-27 14:34:45 UTC <rbnewark> Trumps values dont align w Catholic beliefs Greed, discrimination against others, deceit, sexual abuse He is the antithesis of our values
769542591033466880 2016-08-27 14:30:25 UTC <rbnewark> Clinton hs many strong values that align with Catholic beliefs- working for the common good of our society. She has done this her whole life
769541841024712704 2016-08-27 14:27:26 UTC <rbnewark> Catholics are not told who to vote for by The Church. We vote according to our own decision on which candidate would be best for our country
769541258456944641 2016-08-27 14:25:08 UTC <rbnewark> I hope Catholics will see the inherent evil in Trump & his beliefs This I believe outwieghs an issue Catholics disagree w Clinton-abortion
769540401103450113 2016-08-27 14:21:43 UTC <rbnewark> Since Eisenhower Catholics have favored the winning president It's difficult but were not defined by 1 issue, but formed by moral conscience
769539280507052032 2016-08-27 14:17:16 UTC <rbnewark> Look at who our enemies want  Putin and Assad?- Trump. ISIS wants Trump. David Duke? Trump. Our friends France? Clinton,  Isreal? Clinton

768280371834212354 2016-08-23 02:54:49 UTC <rbnewark> Trump & integrity in the same sentence? Only if you're having a contest to find the most extreme antonyms. By the way this example would win
768279646915862528 2016-08-23 02:51:56 UTC <rbnewark> Only journalists that challenge Trump? Females- Megan Kelly, Joy Reid, & Rachel Maddow the guys act like little girls #mancrushes scaredycat

768259903538335744 2016-08-23 01:33:29 UTC <rbnewark> An attack on one is an attack on all, that's why NATO is important.
768259474335211520 2016-08-23 01:31:46 UTC <rbnewark> Estonia has lost 9 soldiers fighting against ISIS for NATO. I'd say That's sounds like a committment to me Mr. Trump
768258807021527040 2016-08-23 01:29:07 UTC <rbnewark> I believe if the Reps had almost anyone else, they would've had a chance to win, but with Trump they had no chance. Most people arent stupid
768258319211384832 2016-08-23 01:27:11 UTC <rbnewark> Awesome news from S. Carolina. Clinton leading in the state among those likely to vote. That's historic! Trump is working his magic(black)

768176920336883712 2016-08-23 20:03:44 UTC <rbnewark> Im really so tired of dealing with all the haters on the Trump side, from him all the way to the Trumpers at his rally. They're embarrassing
768176565385428992 2016-08-23 20:02:19 UTC <rbnewark> Trumpers would be happy in their own little fascist country where whatevr Trump says goes. maybe he buys an Isle somewhere and they move.
768176119002517504 2016-08-23 20:00:33 UTC <rbnewark> It would be good if there was a place for Trumpers to go. It's obvious they dont like our country and we dont like them. Ithink Crimea or NK
768175746401525760 2016-08-23 19:59:04 UTC <rbnewark> After Trump is crushed in the election the scenario to follow wont be pleasant. Trumpers will go all treasonous, and will need to rounded up
768174541570920448 2016-08-23 19:54:17 UTC <rbnewark> Lots of Trumpers will not accept Hillary as their president. most of them are crazy, demented haters of some sort. We need to be prepared.
768174031510003717 2016-08-23 19:52:15 UTC <rbnewark> Lets face it Trump followers are losers. He gives them some kind of sick hope of an all white society. When they lose it wont be pretty
768173450938560512 2016-08-23 19:49:57 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is a dangerous man. his words are fanning the flames of violent unrest. His people will not be happy when he loses & they have guns.
768172981579157505 2016-08-23 19:48:05 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is promoting revolt with his rigged election statements. This is no joke. His people are scary and serious. #irresonsiblecomments
768172535460470785 2016-08-23 19:46:19 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is going to lose no doubt. His followers arent going to accept it. Theyre going to cause trouble. #TrumpersmoredangerthanISIS
768172078163824643 2016-08-23 19:44:30 UTC <rbnewark> I hope the FBI is monitoring these Trump rallies. They are fertile ground for terrorists it sounds like. They will be like ISIS if they lose
768171661090619393 2016-08-23 19:42:50 UTC <rbnewark> Trump supporters are a danger to our society. Many are on the verge of domestic terrorism, especially if they lose. Trump encourages this.
768171232973828097 2016-08-23 19:41:08 UTC <rbnewark> It sickens me that Trump supporters call themselves American. so hypocritical!. They dont believe in pluralism, diversity or democracy!
768170829007859713 2016-08-23 19:39:32 UTC <rbnewark> Trump supporters need to move along. They dont have American values and dont belong here. They can shoot each up somewhere else #Trumpersout
768170345220026368 2016-08-23 19:37:36 UTC <rbnewark> I hope Trump supporters move to Mexico after their crushing defeat. We  dont want those types of people in America. Then build the wall!
768169936493477889 2016-08-23 19:35:59 UTC <rbnewark> Trumps not winning They better get used it  Trump supporters could go to Mexico if not happy Then I'd be 4 the wall!https://twitter.com/mmpadellan/status/768168873409511425

767911980929720320 2016-08-22 02:30:58 UTC <rbnewark> CNN continues to give legitimacy to people like Scotty & Lowendowski! Why don't they challenge her #Shills4Trump #biasedreporting #weakhosts

767909357174476804 2016-08-22 02:20:32 UTC <rbnewark> Trump the most divisive candidate of all time. Look at him closely. there is a demonic aspect to his appearance. He is evil personified.

766716571079155712 2016-08-19 19:20:50 UTC <rbnewark> Obama is a victim of this logjam in Congress, but did manage to get a few things done. Must of been frustrating dealing with knuckleheads.
766716011986825216 2016-08-19 19:18:36 UTC <rbnewark> So Trump, Congressional block is the direct result of talk radio and the Tea Party bad actors who are driving this country into the ground.
766715651557687298 2016-08-19 19:17:10 UTC <rbnewark> Congress should have a civil exchange of ideas, that negotiates & compromises between the left & right, resolving equtably. It's not. #TPout
766714756321292288 2016-08-19 19:13:37 UTC <rbnewark> Clueless extremists(read tea party) could not and would not govern responsibly, and thus we have this mess in congress. #voteouttheTPbums
766714392595476480 2016-08-19 19:12:10 UTC <rbnewark> Before Tea Party, origins lie in talk radio haters who fed the listeners a line of bull, they believed it & voted for clueless extremists
766713714359754755 2016-08-19 19:09:29 UTC <rbnewark> Tea party created this Trump phenomena. Congress could do nothing, so frustrated white males sought extreme host in Trump, but he's not good
766713317213605892 2016-08-19 19:07:54 UTC <rbnewark> Tea Party has brought this country down, and failed to govern. They do not care about America, only their agenda. #selfishshortsightedbigots
766712854980341760 2016-08-19 19:06:04 UTC <rbnewark> Tea Party not real Republicans. They're anarchists. They were so far to the right even the conservatives were appalled #votethemout #banteap
766712233975963648 2016-08-19 19:03:36 UTC <rbnewark> Tea Party was a disaster. they got nothing done, blocked all good legis, and Congress approval rating at 11%. Iwonder why(not). #votethemout

766662606060867586 2016-08-19 15:46:23 UTC <rbnewark> Why the republicans chose Trump is a puzzle. He had no appeal to large segments of the population, other than disaffected white males.
766662239864487937 2016-08-19 15:44:56 UTC <rbnewark> Again it's not just the message, it's the messenger. Trump has lost many normal republicans because of Trump. Any other Republican would win
766658176166928384 2016-08-19 15:28:47 UTC <rbnewark> CNN needs to change their name to the TNN. All they talk about is TRump. they need some Hillary surrogates on their to balance the clownshow

766655969648480256 2016-08-19 15:20:01 UTC <rbnewark> trump supports Putin, who's bombing innocents in Syria, not ISIS, Syrian rebels. Putin lies, so they're two birds of a feather. #dictators
766653069186641925 2016-08-19 15:08:30 UTC <rbnewark> Manafort was too mainstream. Needed to scrape the bottom to find the most vile creature available-Bannon Check out his history of hatespeech
766652600666066944 2016-08-19 15:06:38 UTC <rbnewark> Manafort was too soft. Needed a more hard core extremeist in Bannon. Getting darker all the time. #buildinganevilempire #dagerouspeople
766652134678867968 2016-08-19 15:04:47 UTC <rbnewark> Please retweet this important info about the kind of people Trump hires. #neonazis #whitesupremacist https://twitter.com/pharris830/status/766641765461831681
766651194785738752 2016-08-19 15:01:03 UTC <rbnewark> there is no other explanation why people still would follow this guy other than its a cult. If you know someone in i,t get them some help.
766650649169715201 2016-08-19 14:58:53 UTC <rbnewark> The cult of Trump is nothing new. People of weak mind are suseptable to megolomaniacs like Trump, Jones, Hitler, etc. Its vital to reject it
766649974268440576 2016-08-19 14:56:12 UTC <rbnewark> Thank goodness there's enough good decent Republicans with a brain that reject the cult of Trump. They reject the incompetence and hate.
766649228986716160 2016-08-19 14:53:14 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is basically a god to his followers. they are weak, & he provides strength. He tells them what to think, & they lap up what he says.
766648710793039872 2016-08-19 14:51:10 UTC <rbnewark> the Trump cult of followers arent going anywhere. If they lose, they will be lashing out in some way in support of their leader. #trubeliief
766648302670450688 2016-08-19 14:49:33 UTC <rbnewark> Why does  Trump appeal to his cult. Maybe it's his simplistic black & white way of finding someone to blame for their problems #disturbing
766647678537076736 2016-08-19 14:47:04 UTC <rbnewark> Trump followers are like a cult. They get extremely angry when you challenge them & lash out. Very irrational. #need2intervene
766646400457117696 2016-08-19 14:42:00 UTC <rbnewark> Let's face it, Trump supporters are nut jobs. Like any cult, whatever their leader does is OK with them! #getalifehttps://twitter.com/mmpadellan/status/766645638700367872

766526339255894016 2016-08-18 06:44:55 UTC <rbnewark> I have a  feeling that by the end even Trump wont be voting for Trump, especially that he's seen the error of his ways, & regrets his words

766519961716088832 2016-08-18 06:19:34 UTC <rbnewark> Trump had the gall to take a man's Purple Heart never having served. He bad mouthed McCains service, & questioned Gold Star mom #despicable

766516220459819008 2016-08-18 06:04:42 UTC <rbnewark> When has Trump ever cared about causing personal pain? That all he's did getting through the primaries, was personally attack his opponents
766507780215746560 2016-08-18 05:31:10 UTC <rbnewark> Boycott Trump on Fox and CNN. these are Trump networks now. It's all Trump all the time. Watch the Olympics or anything! #dontwatchbehappy

766506583283019776 2016-08-18 05:26:25 UTC <rbnewark> Trump represents only white male bigots, and their spouses. That's who his message resonates with. Again check out his audience

766402753052545024 2016-08-18 22:33:50 UTC <rbnewark> they cant go low enough as far as Im concerned. Every vote he gets is an indictment against American ideals. #why4DThttps://twitter.com/PostOpinions/status/766384209568993280

766368638370615296 2016-08-18 20:18:16 UTC <rbnewark> Again, failing to follow through with his promises. You cant believe anything he says! #howmanymoreexamplesdoyouneedhttps://twitter.com/PostScottWilson/status/766354664963108864
766368273705295872 2016-08-18 20:16:49 UTC <rbnewark> Of course he wont- it will reveal what he is- a fraud a cheat and a liar. But still people will vote 4 him! #lowlifehttps://twitter.com/JPublic69/status/766207958413901824
766367555460009986 2016-08-18 20:13:58 UTC <rbnewark> The worse thing is he doesn't believe what he says, he just wants to win. That's why he is all over the place. He has no convictions. #nohrt
766367104811474945 2016-08-18 20:12:10 UTC <rbnewark> All he did is listen to talk radio and repeat what those sickos said and that's why they voted for him in the primary. Rest of US is OK #dem
766366497853669377 2016-08-18 20:09:46 UTC <rbnewark> Get used to it. He wont follow through on anything. He listened to talk radio hate speech to make his issue platformhttps://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/766353681885212672
766357216450400257 2016-08-18 19:32:53 UTC <rbnewark> Are white males so hateful, or is it the media that builds up antigovernment fervor. Do they know the republicans have been in charge for 6y
766356583915716609 2016-08-18 19:30:22 UTC <rbnewark> What's with white males? why are they attracted to Trump? there's nothing appealing about him. He's mean selfish and a crook! #Whysupporthim
766356161360637952 2016-08-18 19:28:41 UTC <rbnewark> We need a new group, white males for Hillary. There's millions of us out here who support her. This is the last group of holdouts for Trump.
766355675353972737 2016-08-18 19:26:45 UTC <rbnewark> Trump appeals to our worse selves,  fears, prejudices; he's a divider, not what we need. It'll take a conversion of the heart. #courage
766354692725018624 2016-08-18 19:22:51 UTC <rbnewark> White men are the worst. Macho idiots. There's no there there, fellas. He's 71.There's nothing left but nonsense, childish attacks, dividing
766353850592735232 2016-08-18 19:19:30 UTC <rbnewark> when are white people going to wake up. A majority are still supporting Trump. That's sad. Blacks got it right.  1% support Trump. #whitesNT
766353139297431552 2016-08-18 19:16:41 UTC <rbnewark> I'm so disappointed in my fellow white people. That they're buying what Trump is selling, and can't see it for what it is- empty hate speech
766352449800065024 2016-08-18 19:13:56 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is a contradiction wrapped in a fabrication delivered in hyperbole. Stupid racist white people lap it up.https://twitter.com/activist360/status/766013416867790848

766299871888363522 2016-08-18 15:45:01 UTC <rbnewark> Trump has no governmental experience. how can he just walk into the white house as his first job? #insanity #doesntknowassfromholeinground
766299445751263232 2016-08-18 15:43:19 UTC <rbnewark> Trump will use intelligence against America if he loses. It's dangerous to tell him anything. #loosecannon #poorloser #grudgeagainstAmerica
766299110085267457 2016-08-18 15:41:59 UTC <rbnewark> Trump favors dictatorship over American democracy. He doesn't realize he must have Congress approval. He has not reached out to them at all.
766298696736608256 2016-08-18 15:40:21 UTC <rbnewark> Progress against ISIS hurts Trump. It's bad news for him. i'm sure he's hoping for the next ISIS attack. Lets make sure hes not involved.
766298215280840704 2016-08-18 15:38:26 UTC <rbnewark> @MichaelSkolnik Trump campaign rooting for ISIS. We need to investigate next attack. Attacks help his numbers. @Trump4ISIS
766297632746504192 2016-08-18 15:36:07 UTC <rbnewark> His numbers aren't low enough. We need to make a statement. Why would whites vote for this guy? He's against Americahttps://twitter.com/mcspocky/status/766171795137392640
766297030285139968 2016-08-18 15:33:43 UTC <rbnewark> @mcspocky they aren't low enough for me. I find it hard to believe 40% of America will vote for this guy. Bad sign. What's wrong with whites
766296473747148800 2016-08-18 15:31:31 UTC <rbnewark> @HillaryClinton you have to keep on the attack. There's plenty of material. A guy like this with a message like this must be defeated totall
766295838800826368 2016-08-18 15:28:59 UTC <rbnewark> @HillaryClinton He's not transparent, doesn't play by the rules. I hope you crush him. It would say something good about our country.
766295314542145536 2016-08-18 15:26:54 UTC <rbnewark> @HillaryClinton Great saying but for me it's just words because Obama did nothing about this. In California the cost of living is higher.
766294936664715264 2016-08-18 15:25:24 UTC <rbnewark> @HillaryClinton Please tell me what you're going to do about the marriage penalty. I want taxes to go down, not just stay the same! #taxed2

766087313440907264 2016-08-17 01:40:23 UTC <rbnewark> Trump desparate now. Hiring criminal element to run  campaign. When Manafort isnt dirty enough, wow, you know youre really scraping bottom
766086368808214528 2016-08-17 01:36:38 UTC <rbnewark> Trump could come up with a big enough lie, so now he's hired the super liar dream team- Ailes, Bannon, Briekbart editor, all unethical scum.

765796110027948034 2016-08-16 06:23:15 UTC <rbnewark> Trump picks a woman assaulter as a key advisor. Trump shows his true color with the dark night  Ailes as a key advisor.
765795612545654785 2016-08-16 06:21:16 UTC <rbnewark> Boycott Trump. He's desperate - and dangerous. He's already hinted at his followers to kill Hillary. Like I said, he's very dangerous.
765794851464052736 2016-08-16 06:18:15 UTC <rbnewark> Boycott all Trump speeches. All will be garbage like the every other one. Ailes will now be turning up the heat. More outrageous than ever.
765794477424406528 2016-08-16 06:16:45 UTC <rbnewark> Trump bringing up Monica Lewinsky? That's tacky, especially coming from an accused of beating up his wife! #Aileswillmakebiggerlies

764611928949829632 2016-08-13 23:57:44 UTC <rbnewark> Remember Trump would do or say absolutely anything to win. So you can't trust anything he says as valid or if he even believes what he says.

764601350508257281 2016-08-13 23:15:42 UTC <rbnewark> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump The truth hurts doesn't it! Time for you to man up and quit. It's the best thing to do for the reps, the country
764600474188210176 2016-08-13 23:12:13 UTC <rbnewark> @maketrumpgoaway @TheRickWilson Amen!
764595415526150145 2016-08-13 22:52:07 UTC <rbnewark> Who's still for Trump, #5- The obvious group, the 2nd Amendmenters. This is their religion. Forget about the others. This is the only one
764594718583889920 2016-08-13 22:49:21 UTC <rbnewark> Who could still be for Trump? How about those who like Scrooge over Tiny Tim? They relate to his comments, like "are there no prisons?
764593696830480385 2016-08-13 22:45:17 UTC <rbnewark> Searching for answers, why still 4 Trump? How about bug out or preppers? With Trump, they won't be preparing for nothing #bettersoonerthanla
764592788184834048 2016-08-13 22:41:40 UTC <rbnewark> Trumpian- 3. something said without thinking or caring about the repercussions.
764589986654015489 2016-08-13 22:30:32 UTC <rbnewark> @BernieSanders Bernie we're being taxed to do something. Please parents to refinance their student loans as well. thank you!
764589745217220608 2016-08-13 22:29:35 UTC <rbnewark> @BernieSanders Please do something about the marriage penalty- taxed separately then put together into a higher bracket and taxed again.
764587714326859776 2016-08-13 22:21:31 UTC <rbnewark> ...still trying to figure out who's still voting Trump. One group could be conspiracy theorists who believe there's someone out to get them
764586961063383040 2016-08-13 22:18:31 UTC <rbnewark> electing Trump as pres is like hiring a know it all jerk just out of college to run your company! Who does that? #noexperience #knownothing
764586148400291840 2016-08-13 22:15:17 UTC <rbnewark> Unbelievable, but he actually said those things! A candidate for president of the United States!!! #anybodybutTrumphttps://twitter.com/milesjreed/status/764574990054330370
764479568203755522 2016-08-13 15:11:47 UTC <rbnewark> @Plantflowes @politicalwire Not good enough friends. how can we any states favoring a guy like Trump? The only satisfactory result is all bl
764477822442221568 2016-08-13 15:04:50 UTC <rbnewark> Excuses, excuses! They're very very selfish. Our Constitution says to promote the common good.https://twitter.com/Ireland0828/status/764466491764772865

764476816929071106 2016-08-13 15:00:51 UTC <rbnewark> Time to push Trump into the 20's. I refuse to believe that there's more degenerates than that in our great country. 80% against Trump!!!!!!
764476302933884928 2016-08-13 14:58:48 UTC <rbnewark> Who still supports Trump?! I can't believe he's still in the 30's%! It must be people who don't follow the news. If they did, they'd stop.
764475146253897728 2016-08-13 14:54:12 UTC <rbnewark> Thank goodness decent, conservative Reps everywhere are beginning to stand up and denounce this monster. #NeverTrump #anybodybutTrump
764474534929895425 2016-08-13 14:51:47 UTC <rbnewark> Psychotic Semiautomatic gun owners for sure love Trump. He protects them in plotting their next attack. #massmurderers4trump
764473811945218049 2016-08-13 14:48:54 UTC <rbnewark> I bet domestic terrorists group members love Trump. His hate speech inspires them and gets them new members. #UShatersloveTrump
764473253586800641 2016-08-13 14:46:41 UTC <rbnewark> We know for sure Neo Nazis are all in with Trump. He's their guy, led by Duke. just listen to the rhetoric at his rallies. #racists4Trump
764472382530596864 2016-08-13 14:43:13 UTC <rbnewark> Maybe the animal abusers are supporting Trump? They vote too, and they're not going to support someone nice like Hillary #animalhaters4trump
764471380729475072 2016-08-13 14:39:15 UTC <rbnewark> Still trying yo figure who could still be voting for Trump. It boggles my mind. It's like voting for a dictator like Putin or N. Korea pres.
764350608941850629 2016-08-12 06:39:20 UTC <rbnewark> Trumpian, a new word in Websters,  definition 2- That which is said by an idiot, as in "Obama is the founder of ISIS."
764349890516307972 2016-08-12 06:36:29 UTC <rbnewark> @SFGiants @sportslarryknbr No pitching and no hitting is a tough combo to succeed with
764349575582756865 2016-08-12 06:35:14 UTC <rbnewark> @CNNPolitics I want to hear that you're going to eliminate the marriage penalty- getting taxed again after we already got taxed separately.
764348801062621184 2016-08-12 06:32:09 UTC <rbnewark> Trump supporters must have a short attention span, are poor sports, look at the glass half empty, are bullies, or interrupt you when speakin
764345985870901248 2016-08-12 06:20:58 UTC <rbnewark> People with road rage vote for Trump. And also people who don't hold the door open for you. Also people who speed up instead of let you in
764344993808998400 2016-08-12 06:17:02 UTC <rbnewark> @CNN @realDonaldTrump There's a new word- Trumpian- it means idiotic, or anything said by you, which is essentially the same thing. #URevil
764343837888172033 2016-08-12 06:12:26 UTC <rbnewark> I've been racking my brain trying to think of who could still be supporting Trump after all of his ridiculous comments, and I've got a list.
764342999098601472 2016-08-12 06:09:06 UTC <rbnewark> New word-"Trumpian" means a base or outlandish statement, having no merit or basis in fact, but believable to the gullible and soft minded.
762891727069847552 2016-08-08 06:02:16 UTC <rbnewark> @maketrumpgoaway @BennettCartoons Not funny

762866036337016832 2016-08-08 04:20:11 UTC <rbnewark> @Plantflowes Any dufus can stick to a script. Only a psychotic rants and raves at every slight. #CosbyandTrumparetwopervsofafeather
762863778257965056 2016-08-08 04:11:12 UTC <rbnewark> @DailyNewsBin @Plantflowes I would say MSNBC has a number of other good journalists including Maddow, and others.
762861485659787264 2016-08-08 04:02:06 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump Who cares? I've never seen anybody as self absorbed as you!
762860985694560257 2016-08-08 04:00:06 UTC <rbnewark> @CNNPolitics Good luck. i hope you beat him. i know  lot of people are looking for some alternative. Trump is most unacceptable.
762860724741742592 2016-08-08 03:59:04 UTC <rbnewark> @CNNPolitics Agreed, he doesn't represent American principles of pluralism and democracy, let alone his personal character.
762839886088896512 2016-08-08 02:36:16 UTC <rbnewark> @Plantflowes Molly, you tweets are right on!. We need to bury him, politically speaking. Your stuff is on point! thank you. Ron Brazil #VFH
762838498466410498 2016-08-08 02:30:45 UTC <rbnewark> @HillaryClinton I will be contributing soon, but first need to hear that you lower taxes for middle class, including California middle class

762836079439286272 2016-08-08 02:21:08 UTC <rbnewark> @baseballmarty It's a push so for. Two ugly strike outs, but a flair ties it up.
762834215108907008 2016-08-08 02:13:44 UTC <rbnewark> Good job, everybody, continue to hit him, and hit him hard at every turn. Dont let him get away with any of his lies and other inaccuracies
762827651266465792 2016-08-08 01:47:39 UTC <rbnewark> The goal with a guy like Trump is to send a message that someone like him is unacceptable. It's not republican ideas under attack, its Trump
762826940730310656 2016-08-08 01:44:49 UTC <rbnewark> Let the new guy run. That will give many reps someone to vote for but shouldn't hurt Hillary too much. The goal os to get Trumps #'s down!
762825133870297088 2016-08-08 01:37:39 UTC <rbnewark> Yea Malala! You are a true Hero! I wish you could vote. Become an American!https://twitter.com/Plantflowes/status/762819958720061442
762807387296108545 2016-08-08 00:27:08 UTC <rbnewark> Hillary says it's because it's the right thing to do, Trumps rationale is to win. #ImWithHer #neverTrump #TrumpAiles4prison #LoveTrumpsHate
762806677737353216 2016-08-08 00:24:18 UTC <rbnewark> @realDonaldTrump @maketrumpgoaway @Green_Footballs but didn't you urge Putin to do that so really it's your fault! #cotcha #donthecon
762805300613173248 2016-08-08 00:18:50 UTC <rbnewark> As expected Trump's tax plan irresponsible and favoring the rich. #notsurprised #Trumpis4therichbutdupeshiscluelessfollowers
762803924218765312 2016-08-08 00:13:22 UTC <rbnewark> We need to drive Trump's numbers down. There's no way somebody like him can get 39% of Americans. It would be very sad if he gets that much!
762803344205156352 2016-08-08 00:11:04 UTC <rbnewark> Many people are saying? It's not the first time he's said that. He's been hearing voices for a while now. #lunytuness #willsayanythingtowin
762802836262440961 2016-08-08 00:09:03 UTC <rbnewark> @CoryBooker Great Speech at convention! You'd get my vote right now #booker2024
762802447026749442 2016-08-08 00:07:30 UTC <rbnewark> How can 39% still support a degenerate like this1? I understand reps have good ideas, but you can't support a man like this! #TrumpCosby
762802021279739904 2016-08-08 00:05:48 UTC <rbnewark> Trump still getting 39%! How is this possible? I don't care about Hillary's #'s. But we're not doing our job, people! Nothing more than 0%!
762798347736391680 2016-08-08 23:51:12 UTC <rbnewark> Everyone needs to continue to get the message out about Trump. Just imagine him as president! Listen to those who support him- scary!
762797653230891008 2016-08-08 23:48:27 UTC <rbnewark> You're believing a child abuser-13-14 year old girls tell their story. He is desparate, and will do anything to win. Nothing is beneath him.
762796642324013057 2016-08-08 23:44:26 UTC <rbnewark> Hillary to blame? Maybe it's my fault, or maybe it's my 90 year old senile dad's fault! Absurd. He cynically uses every tragedy 4 his gain
762783251580583936 2016-08-08 22:51:13 UTC <rbnewark> He said it himself, people would vote for him even if he shot somebody. This is an indictment against the type of person who support him!
762782941860671492 2016-08-08 22:49:59 UTC <rbnewark> It is so disheartening that still 39% of America is backing Trump. It's scary that so many believe in a person like him #bullyracistabuser
762781881007955969 2016-08-08 22:45:46 UTC <rbnewark> Never forget that Trump is a billionaire, and his policies take care of himself first.
762780352616108032 2016-08-08 22:39:42 UTC <rbnewark> People we can't let up against Trump's lies, bullying. We must challenge him at every turn.  #allamericansrallyagainsttrump #anyonebutTrump
762779633951633409 2016-08-08 22:36:51 UTC <rbnewark> Trump would team with Putin to form an axis of power like Hitler/ Mussolini in WWII. Trump ideas not all bad, but the problem is him
762778846819000320 2016-08-08 22:33:43 UTC <rbnewark> Republicans got us into Iraq, not Obama or Clinton! How stupid does he think we are. More lies. He will say anything. #trumpisdangerous
762778510339420160 2016-08-08 22:32:23 UTC <rbnewark> Trump used talk radio to guide his platform, appealing to the haters, and it worked! Don't be duped again! Break away from that ugly scene.
762778223285383169 2016-08-08 22:31:14 UTC <rbnewark> Talk radio also bad, filled with hate speech and negativity. Who needs that? Don't listen and be happier. Most of it is spin #LoveTrumpsHa
762777631020363776 2016-08-08 22:28:53 UTC <rbnewark> I told you fox was bad. the truth has come out this week. They're falling apart. Hannity a true hack, and Ailes a dark manipulator. #Haters
762776871985553408 2016-08-08 22:25:52 UTC <rbnewark> Roger Ailes black room a perfect place for Trump to operate. I'm sure he'll hire Ailes, and then go after young interns. #bothpredators
762776504434462720 2016-08-08 22:24:25 UTC <rbnewark> Again, samo samo. He's a broken record of name calling and bullying and bigotryhttps://twitter.com/rbnewark/status/762324382664433664
762775897942274048 2016-08-08 22:22:00 UTC <rbnewark> Trump followers understand Trump's underlying message against women, minorities, Christians and others, and they love it. Listen to his peep
762775316141977600 2016-08-08 22:19:41 UTC <rbnewark> Everyone needs to read about Trump's sexual abuses. Please find story and read. Of course the clones will excuse even that. #candonowrong
762774704616673280 2016-08-08 22:17:15 UTC <rbnewark> Republicans are desperate. Surogates straining to convince others to vote for Trump with spurious reasoning. #you can hear it in their voice
762774302735290368 2016-08-08 22:15:40 UTC <rbnewark> I don't mind Kasich, probably would've even voted for him! He's doing a great job in Ohio, but the repubs made a big mistake with Trump.
762773965529948161 2016-08-08 22:14:19 UTC <rbnewark> @Humans_vs_Trump Trump should've picked Cosby or Ailes as VP. All are sexual predators. See story about 4 events Trump involved, 2 w minors!
762773095077732353 2016-08-08 22:10:52 UTC <rbnewark> Republicans rallying against Trump. Security leaders label him as dangerous and unstable and dishonest. #notpresidential #noteven4dogcatcher
762772648812175360 2016-08-08 22:09:05 UTC <rbnewark> Name calling working in the showy primary. Americans don't want that type of leader. He is a bully. #NeverTrump #Trumpandailesaresimilar
762772223157350400 2016-08-08 22:07:24 UTC <rbnewark> Trump will say anything to get elected. and he would do anything, too.  He should be in jail, not the white house! #desperatesexabuser
762771598164111360 2016-08-08 22:04:55 UTC <rbnewark> It sounds like Ailes would have been another like charactered choice for VP. Pence is a much too decent sort to be associated with an abuser
762730345661800448 2016-08-08 19:20:59 UTC <rbnewark> @Humans_vs_Trump Nobody is more cozy with wealthy, and apparently 13 year old girls, than you. You shouldve chose Cosby- he's more like U.
762729685226627072 2016-08-08 19:18:22 UTC <rbnewark> disgraceful what that boy did to his father. Does he not have any shame? #Trumpbringsouttheworstinpeople #ProdigalSon #Jebdeservesbetter
762729257076264960 2016-08-08 19:16:40 UTC <rbnewark> Remember the the story of the Prodigal Son. right now Jeb's son is wayward, but he will see the errors of his ways and ask for forgiveness.
762728947205287936 2016-08-08 19:15:26 UTC <rbnewark> Poor Jeb Bush. his son turns his back on him after all the Trump said. The pain of parenthood. He must be the black sheep of the family.
762728644166856704 2016-08-08 19:14:14 UTC <rbnewark> A billionaire is going to look out for the interests  of the average American?! Come on, people! Wake up and smell the coffee. #Trump4rich
762728224149221376 2016-08-08 19:12:34 UTC <rbnewark> If you had a different candidate it would make sense to look at the issues. But because of Trump, you can't. You look at the candidate.
762727286780985344 2016-08-08 19:08:50 UTC <rbnewark> No matter how good his policies sound, because of his character, there is little faith in him actually doing what he says. #TrumpCosby
762726571710918656 2016-08-08 19:06:00 UTC <rbnewark> you can't believe him. Certainly he is not the right representative of a political party. He could well end up in prison for sex offenses.
762725129684066304 2016-08-08 19:00:16 UTC <rbnewark> Trump is a Bill Cosby type of character who allegedly sexually attacked and threatened underage girls and his exwife.
762724828725907457 2016-08-08 18:59:04 UTC <rbnewark> Almost any other rep candidate would be doing better, but Trump is a very repugnant human being, and many reps/voters cant & wont get past
762724301925515264 2016-08-08 18:56:58 UTC <rbnewark> the problem is not the message, it's the candidate.The party of family values is parading an alleged rapist of young girls as their standard
762723149343358976 2016-08-08 18:52:24 UTC <rbnewark> Trump/Cosby would've been a more appropriate ticket. numerous allegations of rape and abuse by Trump against 13 and 14 year olds and his ex.
762510866138882050 2016-08-07 04:48:51 UTC <rbnewark> @tgreene319 @TrumpAsshole He's hitting on the reporter in this interview. He asks her to be in his cabinet... #donthecon #trumpisapervert
762510143942635520 2016-08-07 04:45:59 UTC <rbnewark> I like your hashtag, very catchy.
762507527288344576 2016-08-07 04:35:35 UTC <rbnewark> @knbrmurph Can I add Denard Span, another dud signing. He doesn't even try to steal bases, and if I see another weak grounder to the infield
762506689773867008 2016-08-07 04:32:16 UTC <rbnewark> @mcspocky Although I think the 2nd Amendment should no Trump followers- they wouln't pass background checks- should be allowed to own guns
762506086188363777 2016-08-07 04:29:52 UTC <rbnewark> @Loca2733Mc @FBDemocrats Voter repression favors republicans, democracy favors democrats.
762481478303256576 2016-08-07 02:52:05 UTC <rbnewark> 9 out of 10 know who they re voting for. No matter what they're not changing their mind.
762480977385967620 2016-08-07 02:50:05 UTC <rbnewark> Stop talking about emails! This is serious business! Read about Trump with women and girls.
762478442541490176 2016-08-07 02:40:01 UTC <rbnewark> He's not heading for the white house, he's going to the big house. Read about his alleged abuse of women/girls. It's horrible. #abuseroffems
762477768256868354 2016-08-07 02:37:20 UTC <rbnewark> As bad as I thought he is, it's even worse. Read about the women. including his former wife, he allegedly abused. If it's true, it's prison.
762477035293847553 2016-08-07 02:34:26 UTC <rbnewark> I thought this might be political, but after reading, it sounds legit- Cosby like. Of course Trump clones will deny.https://twitter.com/GoddessKerriLyn/status/762421015255224320
