970585240908582913 2018-03-05 09:02:08 UTC <Tuck1M> @Blackro12653624 'A' customs union is just NOT enough- time to  expose Brexit for what it is. Labour is not doing what is necessary. Trumph's decision to increase steel tariffs should be a warning of what is to come. Within the EU we have safety in numbers. Come on @Keir_Starmer get a grip.

969178144606474240 2018-03-01 11:50:50 UTC <Tuck1M> @Hepworthclare I have tweeted several times that this goes beyond party politics and in- party politics. It is the difference between right and wrong and Brexit is most certainly wrong. I agree, his speech was brilliant.
969133117016625152 2018-03-01 08:51:55 UTC <Tuck1M> @Andrew_Adonis @eddiemarsan Can't make my mind up whether this is immaturity/inexperience. This is tittle tattling and unhelpful by Owen Jones. The problem goes beyond party politics AND in party politics. At a simple level it's the difference between right and wrong and Brexit is morally wrong.

Party politics & the dishonest opportunists within them, who consistently lack transparency & ineffective reasoning will be the ruin of us.
968456643037007872 2018-02-27 12:03:51 UTC <Tuck1M> @DavidLammy @NuriaCorbi Yes, we urgently need to get back to basics and define what is right and wrong. The country has lost the plot. People who don't read around are being duped. Lying and trivialising issues like this is wrong.
968410215560466432 2018-02-27 08:59:22 UTC <Tuck1M> @mikegalsworthy Thanks, there IS a little hope here. Time is passing fast and we're all panicking. I would feel more at ease if Labour made a temporary alliance with the LDems and Greens. We felt let down and deflated after the GE  so the issue of trust is still a problem.  #StopBrexit

961939652881141760 2018-02-09 12:27:39 UTC <Tuck1M> @TheGraveside @AlanAlanh07 I don't know all the answers: Would we have decent human resources within our pub. sector ensuring worker's rights without the EU? Zero hr contracts are a very exploitative, a way of manipulating gov. figures- is that EU's fault?  Is it the EU's fault that wages are low up north?
961561864265175040 2018-02-08 11:26:28 UTC <Tuck1M> @mikegalsworthy Yes totally agree. Likewise my brother and I were brought up in a @Telegraph household. Neither of us read it now. If our parents were still alive, I'd like to think they would've seen the light too.

959479874015711232 2018-02-02 17:33:22 UTC <Tuck1M> @drjanaway Lack of honesty/ transparency & the knowledge that many members of the government have other financial interests and may stand to profit from Brexit. Also suspicious of the deregulation across the board.

954782770571759617 2018-01-20 18:28:46 UTC <Tuck1M> @drjanaway I would vote #LibDems because they are pro EU.

950048555984711680 2018-01-07 16:56:41 UTC <Tuck1M> @ShaunThomas777 Many Remainers ( and Leavers) are so busy, they are only getting information from a sanitized BBC news and that isn't enough. It isn't always apathy, it's time and the mental energy to take all the information on board.
950047517412151296 2018-01-07 16:52:33 UTC <Tuck1M> @ShaunThomas777 I'm having problems persuading friends my age 47+, to either change their minds or become more proactive. Young people can encourage others to inform the ill-informed relatives or stop them being apathetic. I'm sure you'll have friends in this situation.

938883166500196353 2017-12-07 21:29:25 UTC <Tuck1M> @Keir_Starmer Time wasting and the fact that Mr. Davies did not make clear that impact studies did not exist when petitions were being presented, shows a lack of respect for the country, his own position and is an insult to the electorate's intelligence.

938695020726669314 2017-12-07 09:01:47 UTC <Tuck1M> @scarlettpeach That's so sad but I'm afraid correct.

938421554198777856 2017-12-06 14:55:08 UTC <Tuck1M> @DavidLammy So Mr. Lammy, what happens now?
938420625928085504 2017-12-06 14:51:26 UTC <Tuck1M> @DavidLammy So analyses have been done but the impact hasn't? Surely you wouldn't have one without the other. The public requested the release of the 'Impact Studies'- why didn't he come clean months ago as the petitions emerged? Why has he allowed this apparent 'misunderstanding' to go on?
938377011743133697 2017-12-06 11:58:08 UTC <Tuck1M> @RCorbettMEP Then why did Labour vote to go ahead? No plan and no impact assessments- irresponsible. They are complicit and accountable & should do their utmost to undo this rotten mess. Yet still Corbyn is endorsed- I don't understand-there is no logic & no money to implement his ideas.
938353055791304704 2017-12-06 10:22:56 UTC <Tuck1M> @Vicktor1111 @IanMorris78 Absolutely, the vote should be null and void due to poor planning and possible damage to the country. Even more reason to allow MPs a meaningful vote on deal where studies from more reliable sources are taken into account. A 2nd ref should be considered with option to Remain.
937688122854342657 2017-12-04 14:20:44 UTC <Tuck1M> @NicolaSturgeon @bertnotbob Yeah, maybe just a few more miles down to Yorkshire? If not, relocation beckons.

935856320607084545 2017-11-29 13:01:48 UTC <Tuck1M> Don't worry about the odd swear word or anti- Brexit comment but I don't tolerate the targeting of leave areas or leave voters. We need them on side! Politicians and far right movements are however IMO fair game. #StopBrexit

What a conniving, nasty man he has turned out to be- certainly not one I will be supporting.

931286545083990016 2017-11-16 22:23:09 UTC <Tuck1M> Brexit means less worker's rights, job losses and more people claiming Universal credit- more people in poverty, more homeless and less money for the NHS.

931277841697710080 2017-11-16 21:48:34 UTC <Tuck1M> And how will it be any better after Brexit? Corbyn has let this country down by actively supporting Brexit. We'll be sold off to America within the decade.

930352415622168576 2017-11-14 08:31:15 UTC <Tuck1M> @ChukaUmunna Agreed, you can't have a meaningful vote - makes a mockery of our democratic sovereignty & should be illegal. IMO, many MPs have been stupid, from the day the ref was announced- slack, unprepared, spineless, with a lack of foresight - not in the country's best interest.

923455864094298112 2017-10-26 07:46:49 UTC <Tuck1M> @ThatTimWalker A pathetic attempt at quelling the situation by Jo-Johnson.
923453520048721920 2017-10-26 07:37:30 UTC <Tuck1M> @MnsrMysterioso Shocking.
923449434419195905 2017-10-26 07:21:16 UTC <Tuck1M> @f_mols Pro remain PM protecting his own interests / he knew that a potential ref could be funded and swayed by the rich, self serving Eurosceptics?
923446686709637120 2017-10-26 07:10:21 UTC <Tuck1M> @Peston I am both distressed and appalled by this. People like you should call it for what it is, an attack on higher education and academics.
923283202415972352 2017-10-25 20:20:43 UTC <Tuck1M> @terrychristian My favourite part was when you said you will never accept Brexit. Such passion- I feel exactly like that! Brexit is shit.
923154339484569600 2017-10-25 11:48:40 UTC <Tuck1M> @nick_clegg @albawhitewolf @ManInFenham Yeah, he's not even my MP but let's have back!
923140677483057152 2017-10-25 10:54:23 UTC <Tuck1M> @chhcalling @scullyp @AngryNorthernUK @ProfMike_M There are hard times ahead-why should she endure what she didn't vote for and feel that her efforts are not recognised here?

923135260451328000 2017-10-25 10:32:51 UTC <Tuck1M> @chhcalling @scullyp @AngryNorthernUK @ProfMike_M Very worrying, since we will need to develop our bright young minds to sort this mess out.
923131112699912193 2017-10-25 10:16:22 UTC <Tuck1M> @chhcalling @scullyp @ProfMike_M @AngryNorthernUK Is there an anti higher education vibe emerging nowadays, more so since the Brexit vote?  Or is that just in my head?
922875025807544321 2017-10-24 17:18:46 UTC <Tuck1M> @scarlettpeach Love that!
922843987613974529 2017-10-24 15:15:26 UTC <Tuck1M> @Peston Tactless? Why would he ask? Has he justified why- find out! Hasn't he better things to do? Yes, we are having a Brexit induced breakdown.
922839707242975232 2017-10-24 14:58:26 UTC <Tuck1M> @GrahameLucas Done my homework & learnt about Mc' ism & demagogues! Hopelessly trying not to link our politicians with these characteristics- scary stuff!

922743136186781696 2017-10-24 08:34:42 UTC <Tuck1M> @spaceangel1964 Exactly why we're in this mess- no transparency and honesty before the referendum and it still goes on. Dangerous politics based on lies.

921837107663994880 2017-10-21 20:34:28 UTC <Tuck1M> @Harryslaststand @NeilMaybin Years of manipulation, a lack of foresight and planning by Tories and little acknowledgement and awareness of EU investments in the area.

920296163336736768 2017-10-17 14:31:18 UTC <Tuck1M> @medialens Applies to Parliament- MPs either daren't speak up or are too career/ party minded/ spineless to speak up, to the detriment of the country.

918576836703084545 2017-10-12 20:39:18 UTC <Tuck1M> @AngieMeader @CitizensLobby17 We are here because MPs and Ministers put party, careers and their own wealth before country, under the guise of 'the will of the people'.
918575500129394688 2017-10-12 20:34:00 UTC <Tuck1M> @TheStephenRalph I am not aware so far that @DanJarvisMP  is supporting this.
918570474560475136 2017-10-12 20:14:02 UTC <Tuck1M> @DavidLammy History will blame them and all the MPs that didn't speak up. Any idea if @DanJarvisMP  has signed the Brexit Impact studies letter?

918211228199157761 2017-10-11 20:26:30 UTC <Tuck1M> History will blame MPs who failed to stop Brexit @DanJarvisMP .

918138308852637697 2017-10-11 15:36:45 UTC <Tuck1M> Don't get me wrong, I'd rather Brexit was stopped but if there was a 2nd ref, I'd be up for that and so would millions of others!
918097967038566400 2017-10-11 12:56:27 UTC <Tuck1M> @nicbordeaux I have done and @DanJarvisMP has not replied.
918066008602169344 2017-10-11 10:49:27 UTC <Tuck1M> @TheresaMayTweet Brexit won't allow you to help 'the just about managing' as you claim to care so much about. Time to be honest -more poverty & unemployment.

917712192543297536 2017-10-10 11:23:31 UTC <Tuck1M> @acgrayling @ShaunGDavey Actually, there shouldn't have been a vote a all.
917711856495669248 2017-10-10 11:22:11 UTC <Tuck1M> @acgrayling @ShaunGDavey Shouldn't have been a vote without a definite Brexit model for fair comparison. One wonders why this wasn't a prerequisite before the vote.
917403131146833920 2017-10-09 14:55:25 UTC <Tuck1M> @DanJarvisMP @LabourDWP Will increase after Brexit.

917390090778939393 2017-10-09 14:03:36 UTC <Tuck1M> @dontbrexitfixit Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't someone say deals can be made within 48 hours? Looking forward to those deals! Who was it who said that?
917364260115763200 2017-10-09 12:20:58 UTC <Tuck1M> Sent an email to @DanJarvisMP  parliament email address. Hopefully I will get a response!
917360017573019648 2017-10-09 12:04:06 UTC <Tuck1M> Sent yet another email to @DanJarvisMP regarding Brexit. Hopefully he will respond this time!
917275182296944640 2017-10-08 06:27:00 UTC <Tuck1M> @sharpeleven Glad he's getting a platform. Sick of seeing/hearing Farage.

916202902590500864 2017-10-06 07:26:08 UTC <Tuck1M> @NadineDorries Great, hopefully more hateful, trouble stirring incompetent MPs like you who lie and dangerously wind up the public will be disciplined.
916029790284423168 2017-10-05 19:58:15 UTC <Tuck1M> @sarah_richens @PeterGrant19 Tact. votes made rather than preferred choice. No Brexit model before ref & still isn't. Ambiguity can only be settled by 2nd, informed ref.
916021969119797248 2017-10-05 19:27:10 UTC <Tuck1M> @BazzieSmith Quite agree, low earners are struggling already.
915912060449456128 2017-10-05 12:10:26 UTC <Tuck1M> @nickreeves9876 My stomach churns when I read what Fox has to say. I'm not a politician but it was so obvious to me that this is what they wanted pre ref.
915906436051427329 2017-10-05 11:48:05 UTC <Tuck1M> @theresa_may @jeremycorbyn @Jlss1999 So why does he persist in trying to be PM with no Brexit plan?
915657949212811264 2017-10-04 19:20:41 UTC <Tuck1M> @Mcr4EU Very important to stop Brexit- austerity set to get worse after Brexit.

915615331472822272 2017-10-04 16:31:20 UTC <Tuck1M> @theresa_may @jeremycorbyn As a Remainer I need to know your SPECIFIC plans for Brexit. A general avoidance type answer will not suffice. I gave you my tactical vote.
915542864540700673 2017-10-04 11:43:23 UTC <Tuck1M> @jude5456 I'm afraid I switched off at that point- I just couldn't stomach it.
915332717100896256 2017-10-03 21:48:20 UTC <Tuck1M> @JL_998 I think @mrjamesob is correct- he's trying to get sacked.
915178507419955201 2017-10-03 11:35:34 UTC <Tuck1M> @gazliam @terrychristian Father in law vtd out cos 'Germany is trying to take us over as they cdn't in WW2.' So no, as I have several idiots of my own to deal with!
915168144624377857 2017-10-03 10:54:23 UTC <Tuck1M> 'No, I gave you my tactical vote but you continue to support Brexit. Labour or Conservative will give a bad Brexit. Don't email me again!'

914809846435913728 2017-10-02 11:10:38 UTC <Tuck1M> Sent @DanJarvisMP  an email just now, politely stating concerns about Brexit. Hope he has the courtesy to reply.
914571516725137410 2017-10-01 19:23:36 UTC <Tuck1M> @vincecable @scurr_david I'm hoping I'm wrong and leaving will be good for the country. You've not answered my question.
914570068280975360 2017-10-01 19:17:50 UTC <Tuck1M> @vincecable @scurr_david Would you consider changing your mind about leaving if you knew the deal was so bad it would be damaging to the UK?
914568464798556160 2017-10-01 19:11:28 UTC <Tuck1M> @vincecable @scurr_david So you know everything there is to know about the EU and also the Brexit model you voted for? Amazing! Have you a crystal ball? #stopbrexit
914553199662714883 2017-10-01 18:10:49 UTC <Tuck1M> @Peston Anything to add about the Stop Brexit march in Manchester?
914541936106704896 2017-10-01 17:26:03 UTC <Tuck1M> @guardian Can't find coverage of the Manchester Stop Brexit march on your website. Haven't I looked hard enough/ does the north not matter?
914533805473587202 2017-10-01 16:53:45 UTC <Tuck1M> @Ortelius67 Did DD work for them?
914532986921549825 2017-10-01 16:50:29 UTC <Tuck1M> @BBCNews  Why is there no coverage of the large Stop Brexit demonstration in Manchester today? This is censorship and political bias.
914129013467172864 2017-09-30 14:05:15 UTC <Tuck1M> @scarlettpeach I would like this confirming too.
913857043769036800 2017-09-29 20:04:32 UTC <Tuck1M> @CamClack @acgrayling @StopBrexitMarch Good lad.
913856738469777409 2017-09-29 20:03:19 UTC <Tuck1M> @BazzieSmith Done!
913696712086183936 2017-09-29 09:27:26 UTC <Tuck1M> @guyverhofstadt @scarlettpeach The Brexit vote was a blind and ill-informed vote, a vote for something that did not exist and still doesn't. How is this fair?
913695469511102465 2017-09-29 09:22:30 UTC <Tuck1M> I would like to challenge any Brexiter to tell me the benefits of Brexit and justify making life difficult for our youngsters.

913033261592563712 2017-09-27 13:31:07 UTC <Tuck1M> @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour How are you going to get the best deal- why will the EU treat you any better? Stop Brexit.

912336545369247744 2017-09-25 15:22:37 UTC <Tuck1M> @AlexSalmond @EuropeanYorks Me too!
912336342335590401 2017-09-25 15:21:49 UTC <Tuck1M> @scarlettpeach So wrong.  I'm sickened by Brexit, the lies and the spin from both the Tories and Labour.
912322519599910912 2017-09-25 14:26:53 UTC <Tuck1M> @TheAkshayVara @keira_churchill Agreed, what is wrong with an informed ref? Settle the matter once and for all. Why shouldn't we double check 'the will of the pple.'?
912308518589431809 2017-09-25 13:31:15 UTC <Tuck1M> @scarlettpeach They also, by paying tax, funded the Brexit impact studies that have not been put before the public.

912300806208147456 2017-09-25 13:00:36 UTC <Tuck1M> @AndyBurnhamGM @mikegalsworthy Absolutely frustrated like so many other Remainers. To say on behalf of a voter why they voted in a particular way is wrong and intrusive.
912300142681870337 2017-09-25 12:57:58 UTC <Tuck1M> @AndyBurnhamGM @mikegalsworthy And of course no Labour voters were Remainers voting to slash May's mandate! I voted for hope too and now that's dashed.
912030870114066434 2017-09-24 19:07:58 UTC <Tuck1M> @thefabians Yes, and the added pressure of the Brexit uncertainty @DanJarvisMP  which you are not debating at the Labour party conference. Shameful!

902835748466028544 2017-08-30 10:09:50 UTC <Tuck1M> @PeterBoneUK How much have they given back? Do you have an accurate list of the subsidies we've received? Back up claim with evidence. Bet you can't!

902513110497546240 2017-08-29 12:47:48 UTC <Tuck1M> @tony_nog I think @OwenJones84  should read the thread and take heed. He seems to be digging himself a bigger hole- shame he has so much potential.
902229051418583041 2017-08-28 17:59:03 UTC <Tuck1M> @OwenJones84 Are you set to lose your job after Brexit?
902228844060520449 2017-08-28 17:58:13 UTC <Tuck1M> @OwenJones84 There are pple that regret their vote or regret not voting, who are now more informed and worried about job losses.

902138352249516032 2017-08-28 11:58:38 UTC <Tuck1M> @JohnMannMP I voted Labour but I do not support Brexit- time to be honest and admit that his constituents will be worse off as a result.

901101926963703809 2017-08-25 15:20:15 UTC <Tuck1M> @DanJarvisMP @JosieW_AMiE @bookishwgc Yes, worst off as a borough & a country. Uni research opportunities now in question and foreign students- both enrich and benefit our kids.

898973254278184960 2017-08-19 18:21:40 UTC <Tuck1M> @wordpressdotcom Particularly like no.12- would you fire a gun to see what happens?

898891822834962434 2017-08-19 12:58:05 UTC <Tuck1M> @mikegalsworthy You're absolutely spot on and so sensible- sometimes we Remainers need bringing into line. Keep up the good work.

898503954253979652 2017-08-18 11:16:50 UTC <Tuck1M> @acgrayling @GaryLineker Yes, it is within living memory that this country was asking other countries to take our children as refugees in order to keep them safe.
898208644759773184 2017-08-17 15:43:23 UTC <Tuck1M> @jeremycorbyn @schestowitz @harry_wormald Impossible to give the public all the info on such a large, complex organisation. Public given minimal info- ill prepared and misinformed.
898203676665315329 2017-08-17 15:23:38 UTC <Tuck1M> @EuropaUnitedEU @YEM_UK @albawhitewolf @DayJardinz Absolutely- corrupt, invalid. So much money has been pumped into areas and for some reason the EU has not been given lasting credit.
898181797476958209 2017-08-17 13:56:42 UTC <Tuck1M> Yes, used to be a fan but he's really scraping the barrel.
898126835074125824 2017-08-17 10:18:18 UTC <Tuck1M> @OwenJones84 Because EU have the upper hand here- we have little control over the deal and by continuing to do nothing, Labour is supporting catastrophy.

897464764229718016 2017-08-15 14:27:28 UTC <Tuck1M> @stopbrexithour @ShaunGDavey Just stop Brexit as build up to a 2nd ref would be more hateful than the 1st.. Gov. should give reasoned argument why Brexit is a bad idea.
897394211993079808 2017-08-15 09:47:07 UTC <Tuck1M> Labour are allowing this to happen @DanJarvisMPhttps://twitter.com/Open_Britain/status/799198320623321088
896122958426423297 2017-08-11 21:35:37 UTC <Tuck1M> @mikegalsworthy To have one ref on something as complex and large as the EU is absurd.
896121486867537920 2017-08-11 21:29:46 UTC <Tuck1M> @mikegalsworthy This wld have given more negotiating power and done thoughtfully educated at the same time.
896120766382592000 2017-08-11 21:26:54 UTC <Tuck1M> @mikegalsworthy No, the gov. shd have had non binding advisory refs over time on aspects of the EU so they and the EU were informed on public thinking.
896013015652478977 2017-08-11 14:18:44 UTC <Tuck1M> @MikeH_PR Brilliant!
896006140126998528 2017-08-11 13:51:25 UTC <Tuck1M> @OwenJones84 @tony_nog This is an attempt to persuade Remainers to back down. You need to take a step back- what is best for the pple you want to represent?
895982529446002692 2017-08-11 12:17:36 UTC <Tuck1M> We must be vigilant that some polls on twitter are not in 'Remains' favour even if RTs.  Check profiles first! Caught me out!
895971155068280832 2017-08-11 11:32:24 UTC <Tuck1M> @acgrayling Love this one @OwenJones84 .
895970409635610626 2017-08-11 11:29:26 UTC <Tuck1M> @OwenJones84 @PolicyReviewEU It is wrong to accept a result achieved by falsehoods- that's not democracy- that's fraud, everything a good socialist should fight against.
895967690434777088 2017-08-11 11:18:38 UTC <Tuck1M> @OwenJones84 @PolicyReviewEU Plenty to say about staying in the EU in the past. No wonder pple question your motives-  look at their responses- many have a legit point.
895598404109082625 2017-08-10 10:51:13 UTC <Tuck1M> @OwenJones84 Then there will be no need for a new party.
895598138454560773 2017-08-10 10:50:10 UTC <Tuck1M> @OwenJones84 MPs must take this on board and do what's right.
895597905511239681 2017-08-10 10:49:14 UTC <Tuck1M> @OwenJones84 Whether Cam's gov. said they wld honour the ref or not, the evidence suggests a cliff edge- rich will thrive and the vulnerable will suffer.
895594049951776772 2017-08-10 10:33:55 UTC <Tuck1M> Totally agree, had the boot been on the other foot something would have been put in place/ done. Spineless behaviour of MPs.https://twitter.com/Bonn1eGreer/status/895399844138930177
895589117106372608 2017-08-10 10:14:19 UTC <Tuck1M> @mikegalsworthy I am appalled- this is not a democracy when good intentioned pple are not allowed to campaign or have an opinion. Frightening times.
895306689393692674 2017-08-09 15:32:03 UTC <Tuck1M> Do we need a new party @DanJarvisMP  or will MP's have the backbone to stop Brexit? How on earth can you let this progress any further?https://twitter.com/apsamuelson/status/895288013298839553
895233526467108864 2017-08-09 10:41:20 UTC <Tuck1M> @Fang__z @DixieRose100 Yes, agreed. don't give up!

895231105850372096 2017-08-09 10:31:42 UTC <Tuck1M> @DixieRose100 Yes, I agree- Labour doesn't know if it wants a sh**, shave or haircut atm.

895226129933639680 2017-08-09 10:11:56 UTC <Tuck1M> @DixieRose100 Just found out from twitter that it isn't really a Labour poll just some Labour 'leave' group.
895223596506898432 2017-08-09 10:01:52 UTC <Tuck1M> @DixieRose100 Done. But where was, Why did you vote labour? - 'labour through and through' or 'tactical vote'?
892719861188767746 2017-08-02 12:12:55 UTC <Tuck1M> @richardwood___ If that's the case, then Trumpism is at large in the UK.

892514531997618176 2017-08-01 22:37:01 UTC <Tuck1M> @nickreeves9876 We Remainer boomers will have a crap retirement, saving our money for the kids because they'll need it. Going to bed now to worry about it.

892347375511011328 2017-08-01 11:32:47 UTC <Tuck1M> Economics made easy:    The 350 million NHS lie is like saying, 'Would you give up your car to save money even if you'd lose your job?'
892057883105533952 2017-07-31 16:22:27 UTC <Tuck1M> @AngieMeader @StuartLaidler Better in the World cup and European cup- high standard of play and behaviour! Paid peanuts- makes you wonder doesn't it?
891960206531407873 2017-07-31 09:54:19 UTC <Tuck1M> @AngieMeader I have RT- that's support isn't it? I support anyone who is on the Remain side who can justify themselves!
891616555888508931 2017-07-30 11:08:47 UTC <Tuck1M> @Telegraph @mikegalsworthy Also, if the intention is to cut numbers, where will the next generation of lecturers come from given that many are returning to the EU?

890139883012059137 2017-07-26 09:21:00 UTC <Tuck1M> @vincecable @nickreeves9876 Yes, despite tuition fee mistake. Did much good with children's premium and tax.  Passionate Remainer- bring him back.
889908749632012288 2017-07-25 18:02:34 UTC <Tuck1M> Not a Corbyn fan atm but can't recall him saying that he promised to cancel student debt. Anyone got footage of him doing so?
889233194117189634 2017-07-23 21:18:09 UTC <Tuck1M> @OwenJones84 Well written- disappointed that you accept a result that could harm the most vulnerable. Why/how would EU change stance for Labour?
889229203081752577 2017-07-23 21:02:17 UTC <Tuck1M> Congratulations to England's Women's team who won 2:0 against Spain.
889141711448006657 2017-07-23 15:14:38 UTC <Tuck1M> @AngieMeader @teslaspigeons I think we need an expert to help us out here!
889141053328064512 2017-07-23 15:12:01 UTC <Tuck1M> @AngieMeader It's just common sense isn't it? If there's someone on  twitter that can tell me I'm wrong I really don't mind, that would be welcome!
889139686773407744 2017-07-23 15:06:35 UTC <Tuck1M> @AngieMeader Yes but it has to be made of something that an animal, fungus or bacteria can digest. It is all about profit- sickening.
889138808809295878 2017-07-23 15:03:06 UTC <Tuck1M> @AngieMeader Any company claiming that plastic is biodegradable is making false claims.
889138652479139841 2017-07-23 15:02:28 UTC <Tuck1M> @AngieMeader Biodegradable means its chemical structure is changed usually by ingestion by an animal or a fungus/bacteria. Which animal eats plastic?
889132007665651712 2017-07-23 14:36:04 UTC <Tuck1M> @AngieMeader Reuse is fine but plastic never biodegrades, it just breaks down into smaller pieces of plastic which gets into the food chain.
889129574314934272 2017-07-23 14:26:24 UTC <Tuck1M> @AngieMeader Good idea as long as they're made of paper or starch. Make plastic bags more expensive/ illegal- they kill!
888875694083772417 2017-07-22 21:37:34 UTC <Tuck1M> Absolutely sick of this @OwenJones84! Proportional representation would surely limit the spin on how/why pple voted. Time for change!
888871778340175872 2017-07-22 21:22:01 UTC <Tuck1M> @eddiemarsan @MarvidH @OwenJones84 Don't insult the electorate's intelligence! Tactical voting took place. Campaign for 2nd ref & proportional rep. to avoid spin like this!

888797317960278017 2017-07-22 16:26:08 UTC <Tuck1M> @OwenJones84 As a fan of yours, not angry but hugely disappointed that as a democrat you are prepared to accept a dishonest result. Gutted and bemused.
888728851689463808 2017-07-22 11:54:04 UTC <Tuck1M> @acgrayling How dare they speak on the behalf of Remainers- flaming cheek! I'll never accept Brexit.
888727120448561153 2017-07-22 11:47:11 UTC <Tuck1M> @OwenJones84 If so, a % majority should be set but opportunists like you Owen will either keep quiet or switch allegiance for your own agenda won't you?
888508325423439874 2017-07-21 21:17:47 UTC <Tuck1M> @eddiemarsan @MarvidH @OwenJones84 @nickreeves9876 You're an opportunist- a Brexit brought about by lying scoundrels like Gove, Boris and Farage needs stopping! You have no credibility now!
888011471044702208 2017-07-20 12:23:27 UTC <Tuck1M> @OwenJones84 Only if they change stance on Brexit and alert leave voters of the disaster ahead. EU unlikely to change negotiating stance for Labour.
888008718654332928 2017-07-20 12:12:31 UTC <Tuck1M> @DavidLammy You are brave and correct to do so- I'm glad that we have a few politicians that put country before their own career- thank you.

887316273440444418 2017-07-18 14:20:59 UTC <Tuck1M> Too much fighting and criticism within the Remain cause on twitter. Do we want to stop Brexit or not?  Pull together, whatever allegiance.
887312313514160130 2017-07-18 14:05:15 UTC <Tuck1M> @mikegalsworthy Even the thought of Boris in the nude gives me nausea.
