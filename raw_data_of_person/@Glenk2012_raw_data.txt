961879459719651328 2018-02-09 08:28:28 UTC <Glenk2012> @benwhitworth1 @AndrewWrightUK Youre correct. You calculate whats known as a holdover time depending on anti ice fluid used, conditions and temp etc. This gives you an approximate time before you need to de ice again. We remotely deiced on way to runway - the best method IMO.

891961668854583296 2017-07-31 10:00:08 UTC <Glenk2012> @MeteoGib @Slacksoft_uk I thought you'd had a hand in that. It's all about aesthetics rather than performance..
891960881050943489 2017-07-31 09:57:00 UTC <Glenk2012> @MeteoGib @Slacksoft_uk But the Italian ones have that Batman-esque quality....pic.twitter.com/HuXaGgrKhk

891959153794723840 2017-07-31 09:50:08 UTC <Glenk2012> @MeteoGib @Slacksoft_uk We were also delayed a couple of mins as we sharing tug with EZY..busy time for departure.
891958917508595716 2017-07-31 09:49:12 UTC <Glenk2012> @MeteoGib @Slacksoft_uk It's probably the expert way in which you release the parking brake..
891956620703543296 2017-07-31 09:40:04 UTC <Glenk2012> @MeteoGib If you follow @Slacksoft_uk and the #tugspotting tag then you can pass on some suggestions to the boss.
891926706256310272 2017-07-31 07:41:12 UTC <Glenk2012> @MeteoGib It was indeed. As always. Always a pleasure coming to GIB. Shame about the low power tug 
891724223969996801 2017-07-30 18:16:37 UTC <Glenk2012> @MeteoGib @Slacksoft_uk I love GIB. But my second fave is LesBo(y)s!! ( please stop!!)
891724015894753280 2017-07-30 18:15:47 UTC <Glenk2012> @MeteoGib @Slacksoft_uk We shared the IFLD. The CRM was special. We were like Brothers in Arms.

890118543014014976 2017-07-26 07:56:12 UTC <Glenk2012> @jumbo747pilot Scott - You can get a tether kit for the Inspire. It's not cheap but for Police use it could be invaluable. Unlimited flight time
890116925535252481 2017-07-26 07:49:47 UTC <Glenk2012> @Redhill_09 @Junipah @Slacksoft_uk I dare you, just try this - 'Can I "get" a skinny soy chai latte' ( no please or thank you!!)

889554338468823041 2017-07-24 18:34:16 UTC <Glenk2012> @AirbusRed Looks like an 'easy-digger'
889548721066835969 2017-07-24 18:11:56 UTC <Glenk2012> @EatStayFly That looks outstanding!! What is it?

888310193645395968 2017-07-21 08:10:28 UTC <Glenk2012> @Junipah You need to get a 'Ready to move' freq like FCO. Fully equipped with cameras ..I daren't tell 'little white lies' down there.

881905198582697988 2017-07-03 15:59:19 UTC <Glenk2012> @deanmonahan @RPiatkowski Shocking. That will affect at least 0.001% of my comms. Even that's an overestimate. You're lucky there's not a marinade/ate emoji!!

864911715472986112 2017-05-17 18:33:16 UTC <Glenk2012> @EatStayFly Looks a bit tight. Either you have very long legs or someone is making cuts in 1st. What carrier is it?

860461877582860288 2017-05-05 11:51:12 UTC <Glenk2012> @EatStayFly The LoCo mindset - even when they have a boarding pass & seat no. Weird. I often walk past a queue of passengers waiting for my flight.
860413828336582656 2017-05-05 08:40:17 UTC <Glenk2012> @Don_R_Kebab @Slacksoft_uk Depends very much on the proximity to shift end..
