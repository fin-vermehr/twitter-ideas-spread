Instead of trying to virtue signal to the hard right, you may want to live up to your so-called Christian principles. Oh, I support gun rights.

918102683113934848 2017-10-11 13:15:11 UTC <Jonathan_Trenn> @Molly_Kats @Phydeaux_ @SaraLang So I'm mansplaining now? I'm not allowed to have an opinion on what I think the core issue is here? That it goes beyond "men"?
918095855344857088 2017-10-11 12:48:03 UTC <Jonathan_Trenn> @Molly_Kats @Phydeaux_ @SaraLang They use their power and intimidation to create support systems that defend them and protect them at all costs. That's structural sexism.
918095222021738496 2017-10-11 12:45:32 UTC <Jonathan_Trenn> @Molly_Kats @Phydeaux_ @SaraLang The heart of the problem is powerful men who abuse that power and the structures around them that let that happen, that look the other way.
918094729082036224 2017-10-11 12:43:35 UTC <Jonathan_Trenn> @Molly_Kats @Phydeaux_ @SaraLang I'm not even writing that to defend men, I'm trying to focus on the heart of the problem.  We're thinking of "men" in different contexts.
918093236983517184 2017-10-11 12:37:39 UTC <Jonathan_Trenn> @Molly_Kats @Phydeaux_ @SaraLang "About men" cheapens it, it's too broad of a statement, & it doesn't address the structural sexism this subset of men use to exploit women.
918072033241698304 2017-10-11 11:13:24 UTC <Jonathan_Trenn> @Molly_Kats @SaraLang Then, @Phydeaux_, we're going to have to disagree how the focus on men is being used.
917976622262874113 2017-10-10 04:54:16 UTC <Jonathan_Trenn> @Molly_Kats @SaraLang @Phydeaux_ I said it was structural sexism. It pervades the entire industry. And beyond.
917976154941870080 2017-10-10 04:52:25 UTC <Jonathan_Trenn> @Molly_Kats @SaraLang @Phydeaux_ I was responding to the way "men" was used in a tweet.
917970951534534656 2017-10-10 04:31:44 UTC <Jonathan_Trenn> @Molly_Kats @SaraLang @Phydeaux_ I didn't say it wasn't.  I said it was about structural sexism and abuse of power.
917909983446085632 2017-10-10 00:29:28 UTC <Jonathan_Trenn> @Molly_Kats @SaraLang True. Which means that it isn't just about the blindness/callousness of men. Some of it is structural sexism, some of it is abuse of power.
917907599693176832 2017-10-10 00:20:00 UTC <Jonathan_Trenn> @Molly_Kats @SaraLang True, but it wasn't just men that were silent. And I'm not talking about his victims.  It was an entire industry.

797927759150354433 2016-11-13 22:22:57 UTC <Jonathan_Trenn> @N1K0LAK1 She's human to me.  And her election shows me that American continues to be great.
796874107275149312 2016-11-10 00:36:07 UTC <Jonathan_Trenn> Political violence over the past two days in the US from both sides.  Most will condemn it only when it comes from the other side. Pathetic.
