966795606068006913 2018-02-22 22:03:29 UTC <DinapoliLouis> @davidaxelrod Could a reporter please ask former President Bush. What did you rescind the ban on assault weapons in 2004? (Profits for gun manufacturers I'm assuming. ) And how do you feel about that decision now?

966474641639378944 2018-02-21 00:48:05 UTC <DinapoliLouis> @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper It's a crazy idea. It's not their job. They are not policemen.
966401262290862080 2018-02-21 19:56:30 UTC <DinapoliLouis> @realDonaldTrump McConnell and Ryan would not get on board. President Obama  tried to get something bipartisan done. They said no!!!!!
966369414559010816 2018-02-21 17:49:57 UTC <DinapoliLouis> @jaketapper Kushner should not even have a job in the white house. He is completely unqualified.  And no way in hell should he have top secret clearance.

936546165088284673 2017-12-01 10:43:00 UTC <DinapoliLouis> @KirstenPowers When I read some of these angry hate speech responses.  I can't help but think. Isn't this how Nazi Germany started. It's frightening.
935251334005129217 2017-11-27 20:57:48 UTC <DinapoliLouis> @KirstenPowers It seems there is no bottom to how low he can go. Proof that money can't buy you class, but it can make you crass..

According to some people.  And on top of that they use the Lord's name to defend him. You all should be ashamed of yourselfs.
