969631148262518784 2018-03-02 17:50:55 UTC <MusicFreak20> @audralevines I literally have 2 months left of uni and I know I'm not getting anywhere near the amount of work I need to do done. Adjusting to new meds and getting uni work is a hard juggling act to uphold! Thank you, I will at some point if that's okay? 
969316675794407424 2018-03-01 21:01:19 UTC <MusicFreak20> @audralevines I know this feeling all too well, although I'm very close to finishing uni - I am tempted to give up. I have zero motivation to do anything for it.
969311751811497984 2018-03-01 20:41:45 UTC <MusicFreak20> Ready to fight with everyone and everything today. So fucking angry about everything for no actual reason.   Fucking done with this whole day. I've achieved nothing yet again. Fuck this, I'm fucking out.

968117306143461376 2018-02-26 13:35:27 UTC <MusicFreak20> All I can think about is this event we're doing tonight and I'm already fucking anxious about it. Volunteered myself for a sociable role on one of my good days...now I'm dreading tonight.

966864129255452672 2018-02-22 02:35:46 UTC <MusicFreak20> @paramofe Haha it's all good! I already have the RCB one pre-ordered from you but I think I need more plus your photo prints too bc they're Hella cute 
966813853735583746 2018-02-22 23:15:59 UTC <MusicFreak20> @paramofe I want like all of the AL tees  between your designs and Paramore's, I'm broke af  I get paid next week so may treat myself then

966722493309505536 2018-02-22 17:12:57 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior Haha yeah, I'm pretty much obsessed with them 
966660249372553216 2018-02-22 13:05:37 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior Haha just a lil bit   I've loved Paramore since I was like 14, I have two pmore tattoos atm but I'm planning to get more 
966660063040622592 2018-02-22 13:04:53 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior The issue that I have is that a lot of the bad things that I do are on impulse so I don't think before I do them and don't realise the damage I've done until afterwards. It means the rational side of me doesn't think to contact people if I need to etc, it's such a pain 
966659645317304320 2018-02-22 13:03:13 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior I take it as a silver lining from a bad event...but it's different for everyone I guess   I'm finally becoming more able to ask for help when I need it but it's a work in progress as it's something I really struggle with
966659202704920576 2018-02-22 13:01:28 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior It's there usual course of action apparently, which I totally get but right now if I'm not getting that I just need to go somewhere to vent so things don't get too much and boil over again. Trying to get that sorted now
966658919224545280 2018-02-22 13:00:20 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior My mum sorted it all out today so I can actually call people and stuff now which is good!   Yeah I think it'll be good for me and I need it but I'm just anxious about it all tbh, there's so much going on
966631331575877632 2018-02-22 11:10:43 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior Yeah, I know I need it but group therapy sounds so freaking scary. I haven't been able to call people because my phone got cut off last week. When I was in a crisis on Monday, I had to find WiFi somewhere to call my friend. I'm going to try and use the crisis team in future.
966630813835014145 2018-02-22 11:08:39 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior I apparently can't have therapy with a psychiatrist/therapist until I have the emotional coping skills ready in case any difficulty emotions arise
966630640748724226 2018-02-22 11:07:58 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior Yeah they do - although after an incident on Monday they've said I now need a high intensity course instead of the low intensity course that they were originally going to give to me.

965846121204649985 2018-02-19 07:10:34 UTC <MusicFreak20> No wonder people in hospital are constantly sleeping when you get easily woken up by someone having a coughing fit or asked what you want for breakfast...  I'm gonna need to nap on and off today man

964272298445475845 2018-02-15 22:56:45 UTC <MusicFreak20> S1E13 of #OneDayAtATime had me in tears. I didn't realise I needed that cry today...but it was a damn good cry and what an episode. Officially obsessed with this show now. 
964246459670585345 2018-02-15 21:14:05 UTC <MusicFreak20> I did however spend a lovely afternoon with my friend Sammy today & that made my heart happy & warm & my stomach full of tea & cake. Today was a much needed rest day where I could (try my best to) not worry about anything but enjoying myself guilt free pic.twitter.com/TWo19Wqy9P
964245188637089792 2018-02-15 21:09:02 UTC <MusicFreak20> I'm more so frustrated as hell because not one single professional can agree with another professional on what I have and I just want & desperately need a way of moving forward now. I'm so tired of this.
964244508442537984 2018-02-15 21:06:20 UTC <MusicFreak20> I honestly appreciate every ounce of support I get but mental illness is so individual, it's not a one size fits all thing.  I don't fit the stereotype but that doesn't make any diagnosis I have invalid because I don't fit those stereotypes (if I ever get a concrete one lmao).
964242884798140417 2018-02-15 20:59:53 UTC <MusicFreak20> "But you don't look/act like you're bipolar/borderline/*insert other mental illness here*"    Like everyone is different anyways so everyone's mental illness and how that manifests itself is therefore different person to person too...like are we are supposed to act the same??
964103428342468608 2018-02-15 11:45:44 UTC <MusicFreak20> I'm just so confused and I need SOMEONE to agree on something so I can ensure I can get the best treatment and have a quality of life. I'm so tired of going back and forth between services and not getting any clear answers 
964103121520726017 2018-02-15 11:44:30 UTC <MusicFreak20> So my GP and the Mental Health Nurse I saw believe I have anxiety and depression, the psychiatrist I saw believes I have bipolar type 2, my mental health advisor believes I have emotional instability and now I've just been told by someone else that I have traits of EUPD.
964102278276964352 2018-02-15 11:41:09 UTC <MusicFreak20> Even more fucking confused than I was before my appointment today. My brain freaking hurts now, can't get a straight answer out of anyone I'm assessed by and my phone has been cut off again. Fucking brilliant

963970580268580865 2018-02-14 02:57:50 UTC <MusicFreak20> One Day At A Time is actually pretty great and I can't believe I've been sleeping on this show. I'm only 5 episodes in but I'm really digging it so far 
963968850936156160 2018-02-14 02:50:58 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde I always record some of my fave songs at a gig for this exact reason. I love to relive those moments 
963895340553461761 2018-02-14 21:58:52 UTC <MusicFreak20> Me: why am I gaining weight when I've been losing it the past few months?   Also me: eats junk food and cba to go to the gym and is on meds that can cause weight gain   No fucking clue man 
963860369554001922 2018-02-14 19:39:54 UTC <MusicFreak20> I always related to this song with the loss of my Gran being so raw, even nearly half a decade later. This song is seriously a masterpiece https://twitter.com/RouReynolds/status/963858605173821441
963827313057116161 2018-02-14 17:28:33 UTC <MusicFreak20> We're not that big on Valentine's Day but just wanted to remind y'all that this guy is a fucking gem and I'm so lucky to have him in my life. Don't know what I'd do without him pic.twitter.com/GAZFzCaBVl
963549674719326212 2018-02-13 23:05:18 UTC <MusicFreak20> Life doesn't make narrative sense   (always a good song to listen to in an existential crisis )https://youtu.be/9Rtvwu75K3I
963523643484536833 2018-02-13 21:21:52 UTC <MusicFreak20> It only took me nearly a fucking hour to get out of bed wow
963517537462947840 2018-02-13 20:57:36 UTC <MusicFreak20> Also appointments before 10am should be illegal. 9.30am MH appointment on Thursday and I have 0 ideas as to how I'm going to get up before that time let alone be there awake & dressed fucking hell
963517089586786304 2018-02-13 20:55:50 UTC <MusicFreak20> I'm seeing everyone enjoying pancake day & I'm just here like having a crisis about my own existence 
963510264372039680 2018-02-13 20:28:42 UTC <MusicFreak20> Will I find the energy and motivation to go downstairs to cook dinner for myself?   We'll find out after these messages
963501596104589312 2018-02-13 19:54:16 UTC <MusicFreak20> I wholeheartedly support & encourage self love but when I'm by myself I fucking hate everything about me and think of every single thing I've done wrong so I think I might be a bit hypocritical tbh???
963233313468108800 2018-02-12 02:08:12 UTC <MusicFreak20> @YouRuinEveryPod That's a good head canon, I shall accept it as fact unless stated otherwise!
963228763369730051 2018-02-12 01:50:07 UTC <MusicFreak20> @YouRuinEveryPod So am I   Why did we never find out what happened to Susan? Is she okay?
963212772359196672 2018-02-12 00:46:35 UTC <MusicFreak20> This song is so ridiculous but it makes me laugh so I love it and Idec   (I'm so not ready for this season to finish this week )  #CrazyExGirlfriend #IGoToTheZoopic.twitter.com/j8J8GDhjTt
963177385922387968 2018-02-12 22:25:58 UTC <MusicFreak20> When you find something that you relate to all too well...cheers for the reminder Facebook pic.twitter.com/AL3M3MhLLX
963151326757642240 2018-02-12 20:42:25 UTC <MusicFreak20> Hungry af but feel bad ordering takeaway with @awildetweet being on shift but I also need to stay in and do uni work so can't really go to the shop and get something. Fuck this adulting thing man, it S U C K S 
962855364654977024 2018-02-11 01:06:22 UTC <MusicFreak20> Lol @ me thinking I might be productive this weekend bc that definitely didn't fucking happen

962755366718181377 2018-02-11 18:29:01 UTC <MusicFreak20> I have so many messages and absolutely zero chance of reading them within the next few hours because I'm too fucking overwhelmed to deal with them all right now 
962746127694155783 2018-02-11 17:52:18 UTC <MusicFreak20> The thought of facing people tomorrow and interacting with them and trying to appear normal fills me with D R E A D
962741433663918080 2018-02-11 17:33:39 UTC <MusicFreak20> Know that I need to do work but know that I probably won't have the motivation to actually do any of it until like 2am when I should be sleeping.   Fuck this depressive rut. Fuck this. Fuck this. Fuck this.
962726667734192128 2018-02-11 16:34:58 UTC <MusicFreak20> I've got to try and pretend to be a normal functioning human being tomorrow...let's see how well that goes...

962463567336353792 2018-02-10 23:09:30 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Racheldoesstuff @AmyBedster If she did a tour I'd totally be down to follow her around the UK tbh! 
962425610197970944 2018-02-10 20:38:41 UTC <MusicFreak20> One of my favourite songs from this season https://twitter.com/Lanky_Nibz/status/962368778788098049
962425017047879680 2018-02-10 20:36:19 UTC <MusicFreak20> This is probably still my favourite ever episode of @CW_CrazyXGF. Need my own Akopes Dream Ghost in my life. @michaelhyatt16 still kills it in this pic.twitter.com/k4FQnudXFF
962416989858947072 2018-02-10 20:04:25 UTC <MusicFreak20> @yelyahwilliams and @Racheldoesstuff fucking me up emotionally...nothing out of the ordinary then 
962416271785627649 2018-02-10 20:01:34 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Racheldoesstuff I can never have enough Rachel Bloom songs tbh  (but I also love @DLChamplin songs so you see my predicament here). Y'all are fab

962108422689869826 2018-02-09 23:38:17 UTC <MusicFreak20> Seeing everyone on my course do work and be productive and stuff and I'm barely getting anything done because I'm spending like 12 hours in bed a day. Fml, I fucking hate this   Maybe I'll be productive over the weekend, who knows

960967499280986113 2018-02-06 20:04:40 UTC <MusicFreak20> Sad feels rant over for now I guess 
960967183131185152 2018-02-06 20:03:25 UTC <MusicFreak20> Eugh. Today started off so well and now I'm just fucking sick of it. I need food and I need my bed.
960967056685494273 2018-02-06 20:02:54 UTC <MusicFreak20> I weird people out and make them uncomfortable and I just need to stop trying to get people to like me because it's fucking weird and quite frankly, sad.
960966953006522368 2018-02-06 20:02:30 UTC <MusicFreak20> And I hate myself for desperately trying to fit in. I hate it I hate it I HATE IT. I just want to be normal and not have a brain that has its metaphorical finger on the self destruct button every other week.
960966829677207552 2018-02-06 20:02:00 UTC <MusicFreak20> That's all I've ever wanted in life. To be fucking normal. To fit in and not weird people out and have friends who like me for me. But I've always been 'that' kid. Into obscure bands or TV shows or drawing or stuff that no one else seems to like.
960966753353453568 2018-02-06 20:01:42 UTC <MusicFreak20> Seeing all the appointments I have lined up whether they're about meds or being assessed or just checking to see that I haven't topped myself yet makes me realise how abnormal I am. How NOT normal I am.
960963565061582848 2018-02-06 19:49:02 UTC <MusicFreak20> I watched the last episode of S1 of My Mad Fat Diary and that was a MISTAKE   Bringing on all them sad feels
960962919772114945 2018-02-06 19:46:28 UTC <MusicFreak20> @CraftsyTardis It's all good, see the doctor tomorrow so we'll see what she says to do next
960943208250437632 2018-02-06 18:28:08 UTC <MusicFreak20> Also stress management course: here's a letter describing how your anxiety and depression have got worse but also don't both coming back to us rn because you have an initial assessment somewhere else  Cheers man, thanks for that much appreciated 
960941820833423362 2018-02-06 18:22:38 UTC <MusicFreak20> Why the fuck am I so fucking awkward??? I just make people uncomfortable with my presence and I should just go home and not bother people man

959902298393726976 2018-02-03 21:31:56 UTC <MusicFreak20> Feel like I'm that drunk twat in the corner whilst everyone else had their own thing going on 
959774487033106432 2018-02-03 13:04:04 UTC <MusicFreak20> Apparently I've been hyperventilating in my sleep...cool cool cool cool so these tablets make me have weird dreams and that is how my body deals with if 
959581536046723072 2018-02-02 00:17:21 UTC <MusicFreak20> Tbh I think my immune system has suppressed this cold on and off for three weeks but hasn't got rid of it entirely so it keeps coming back with a vengeance 
959578987948396550 2018-02-02 00:07:13 UTC <MusicFreak20> Today I've eaten too much food but still want more and have had too much sleep but still want more. Can I not be ill for the third week in a row please? Just want to actually be able to get stuff done 
959550075302182912 2018-02-02 22:12:20 UTC <MusicFreak20> Pretty sure I have this cold that's going round...again. Fucking brilliant 
959544843818201088 2018-02-02 21:51:32 UTC <MusicFreak20> I also keep craving bad food and would happily order another takeaway tonight but instead I'm actually going to get off my arse and cook. Adulting is hard man 
959544538783240192 2018-02-02 21:50:20 UTC <MusicFreak20> My nap basically turned into a mini sleep wth 
959484780625743873 2018-02-02 17:52:52 UTC <MusicFreak20> The combination of my new meds and possible cold coming back means that my brain has the comprehension speed of a slug today. I need a nap

959220514697904133 2018-02-01 00:22:46 UTC <MusicFreak20> @hollyykinss Thank you! GP is trying to get that all arranged for me and I have an appointment in two weeks time. Hope you're well on the road to recovery now  Thank you so much, here to chat as well if you need to xxx
959204139736723457 2018-02-01 23:17:42 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Yeah I guess so, I've never tried either personally tbh. Just like to sleep it off most of the time 
959202983157358592 2018-02-01 23:13:06 UTC <MusicFreak20> Think I've just had a week's worth of sugar in one milkshake. Rip me 
959202796171034624 2018-02-01 23:12:22 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Good old power nap my friend told me hot lemonade is good for when you're ill but pls don't hold me to that bc I've legit never tried it myself 
959182961504608256 2018-02-01 21:53:33 UTC <MusicFreak20> @trashwatts I just basically want to buy everything but my bank account is saying don't you dare you little shit you've spent enough money already 
959180683284484098 2018-02-01 21:44:30 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Soup and rest for you 
959180521556402177 2018-02-01 21:43:51 UTC <MusicFreak20> @trashwatts Basically me rn  I've ordered the RCB tee but I am SO tempted to go back and get the Paramore is a band! tee, the cap, tour three poster and the edited photos of the band from tour three as well (even though I could barely afford the first tee but whatevs ) 
959179271787999232 2018-02-01 21:38:53 UTC <MusicFreak20> I realise that I should've made a thread with my previous tweets...I'm a pleb 
959179094964531201 2018-02-01 21:38:11 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Courtxamber 
959175670655053824 2018-02-01 21:24:35 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Courtxamber I'm doing okay for now, thank you 
959174808150990848 2018-02-01 21:21:09 UTC <MusicFreak20> #TimetoTalk I joke a lot about stuff but my mental health has been absolutely shit the past few months (and years tbh). But I'm trying to get better this time.   So all I can say is, just be kind please bc you never know what someone is going through.   Just be kind.  3/3
959174023585370112 2018-02-01 21:18:02 UTC <MusicFreak20> #TimetoTalk Now I know Anxiety and Depression are fairly common, but had no idea how common Bipolar Disorder Type 2 and Borderline Personality Disorder were. Now the confusion surrounding my diagnosis is that they are all very similar, meaning that I fit some traits of them 2/3
959173264345124870 2018-02-01 21:15:01 UTC <MusicFreak20> #TimetoTalk Might as well spread a bit of awareness I guess (because no one really told me about them before, I'm awaiting further assessment for this so it's nothing concrete). I *potentially* have Bipolar Disorder Type 2, Borderline Personality Disorder, Depression &Anxiety 1/3
959166808656932864 2018-02-01 20:49:22 UTC <MusicFreak20> @paramofe No problem! I'll be sure to take lots of photos in it when it arrives! 
959159839082668037 2018-02-01 20:21:40 UTC <MusicFreak20> Ordered my Rose Colored Boy tee from @paramofe and I am already so psyched to get it 
959153547085414400 2018-02-01 19:56:40 UTC <MusicFreak20> Yaaaaaas    Convinced @zerothreex to get a takeaway cos I'm a fat bastard who likes to eat all the wrong things
959147409384321024 2018-02-01 19:32:17 UTC <MusicFreak20> Takeaway for the adults plspic.twitter.com/iVvabvVJg6
959144015391272960 2018-02-01 19:18:47 UTC <MusicFreak20> When you want takeaway for dinner but @zerothreex decides for once to be the one who says we should cook...the tables have turned 
959141756712480771 2018-02-01 19:09:49 UTC <MusicFreak20> @paramofe I've literally set a timer so.i don't miss it!! I'm grabbing myself a Rose Colored Boy tee 
959140373741428736 2018-02-01 19:04:19 UTC <MusicFreak20> Here I was thinking the cat is like obese and the vet says he's like the ideal weight   And then there's my fat ass considering whether or not to order a takeaway tonight even though we got food shopping delivered today 
959075765995360256 2018-02-01 14:47:36 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Yeah it fucking sucks  it's frustrating as hell
959046145967353857 2018-02-01 12:49:54 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde According to them there is apparently. Constantly stuck in limbo with everyone...either my case is too serious for one service or not serious enough for another. I can't bloody win 
959043173766090753 2018-02-01 12:38:05 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Nope...they legit told me this. Stuck with my zombie meds for now I guess 
959039584423301120 2018-02-01 12:23:49 UTC <MusicFreak20> Stress management course people: as you're getting help from somewhere else you can't come here any more.  Yeah that's fucking helped my stress levels thanks   I only have an initial appointment it's not even anything concrete yet but cool cheers man much appreciated

959012803989458944 2018-02-01 10:37:24 UTC <MusicFreak20> One of my faves https://twitter.com/miseryroute/status/958871654263869440
958794246378672129 2018-01-31 20:08:56 UTC <MusicFreak20> 1 dose of meds taken and I already feel the need to eat EVERYTHING. Gonna get fat again, yay 
958792145984540673 2018-01-31 20:00:35 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Yeah just a bit that's on a half dose as well, can't imagine what I'm going to be like on the full dose next week 
958778290579427328 2018-01-31 19:05:32 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde It was ridiculous... Al woke me up to move me to be around 4am and apparently it was like I was drunk...I have no recollection for most of last night tbh
958774308549120000 2018-01-31 18:49:42 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Definitely! Had about 14 hours last night bc of new meds and it feels like I've not slept that well since I left the womb go nap and hope you feel better soon 
958767463566598145 2018-01-31 18:22:31 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde No problem!  Sleep solves everything! 
958766230348984320 2018-01-31 18:17:36 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Sending you some good vibes 
958765986752204800 2018-01-31 18:16:38 UTC <MusicFreak20> When you accidentally like something from 2012 on someone's Facebook profile and have to unlike it real quick  I think that's a sign that I need to do work and stay the fuck off of Facebook 
958697440219222021 2018-01-31 13:44:16 UTC <MusicFreak20> I've literally slept for nearly 14 hours... I guess that's a good thing?? 
958481166532857858 2018-01-30 23:24:52 UTC <MusicFreak20> New meds have begun (even tho I was supposed to take them last night oops). Let's see how we go with these 
958425906300768259 2018-01-30 19:45:17 UTC <MusicFreak20> Also my tutor is pissed off at me so that's fun, yay   At least I emailed and didn't just not turn up
958425712272248837 2018-01-30 19:44:31 UTC <MusicFreak20> One of the positives I can take from today though: doctor has arranged a psych appointment for me to be assessed properly. This is probably the most helpful and genuinely understanding GP that I've ever had in regards to my mental health.
958425302832697344 2018-01-30 19:42:53 UTC <MusicFreak20> Also feel like I'm annoying people by messaging them so maybe it's just best to shut the hell up and stop whining about my issues
958425022409986048 2018-01-30 19:41:46 UTC <MusicFreak20> Hangover + missed meds is not a good combo 
958280052734676993 2018-01-30 10:05:43 UTC <MusicFreak20> Fuck this hangover, feels like my brain is going to explode 
958165826150027265 2018-01-29 02:31:49 UTC <MusicFreak20> Kinda want to sleep, kinda need food, kinda need a cigarette... What is my life 
958165413430427649 2018-01-29 02:30:11 UTC <MusicFreak20> I need a cigarette and sleep tbh wtf I'm so tired

958067447910805504 2018-01-29 20:00:54 UTC <MusicFreak20> A 'casual' drink and food.out can easily spiral into a full on night out...let's see how this goes 
958011533971386368 2018-01-29 16:18:43 UTC <MusicFreak20> Most of the time tbh https://twitter.com/sosadtoday/status/957692278621032451
958010796512043010 2018-01-29 16:15:47 UTC <MusicFreak20> Don't talk to me about frustration until you have to sit there for 20 minutes trying to put the straps back on a strapless bra. That shit is frustrating as hell.
957996527062003712 2018-01-29 15:19:05 UTC <MusicFreak20> Fucking gutted about @Pink not winning a Grammy last night. And I'm also pissed that she didn't get a standing ovation for her stunning performance of Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken. Her voice continues to blow me away. Thank you for sharing your talent Alecia.

957781802550165504 2018-01-28 01:05:51 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Thank you so much, that means a lot!    Seriously it's my new fave thing rn   Me and my friend Jess forgot to draw something for the drawing round once and the guy was like 'well clearly your drawing is invisible' yep...
957762580445057026 2018-01-28 23:49:28 UTC <MusicFreak20> On the other hand - I thought that at the start of this academic year I would have like 1 friend. And actually, I've genuinely made some really lovely friends and that's making me fucking smile like a doofus rn???

957761930822934529 2018-01-28 23:46:53 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Doing my best, just hoping it works out this time round   (I also just saw your name change and it cracked me up omd )
957760676759506945 2018-01-28 23:41:54 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Much appreciated just may be in my own bubble in the studio this week
957760161392840705 2018-01-28 23:39:51 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Thank you, that means so much I may just be spaced out/tripping balls this week  we'll know by Wednesday apparently 
957734682690576385 2018-01-28 21:58:36 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Courtxamber Seeing Paramore live twice in one year would be amazing 
957734531871789057 2018-01-28 21:58:00 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Courtxamber Mine was accidentally thrown away as boyfriend didn't check the bag  he's tried to find me another one but with no luck 
957733244874772480 2018-01-28 21:52:54 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Courtxamber I was absolutely gutted! Lost my Low Key No Pressure pin badge too  Got my fingers crossed for them to be at R&L!! 
957732465367502848 2018-01-28 21:49:48 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Courtxamber We missed the first two songs when we saw them as we didn't realise they'd be on at 8.45 and they were some.kf the ones that I was looking forward to seeing live most 
957730668301217792 2018-01-28 21:42:39 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Courtxamber I miss them live already 
957730240868093953 2018-01-28 21:40:57 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Courtxamber Haha omg that would definitely be me 
957728276453224448 2018-01-28 21:33:09 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Courtxamber I'd be so freaking happy!!  If Paramore get announced I'm buying tickets!!  (I love both hands but Paramore would be the main draw for me)
957726750666051586 2018-01-28 21:27:05 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde No problem  and I probably will need hugs and laughs over the next few weeks adjusting to new meds  thank you sweetie x
957686067263614977 2018-01-28 18:45:26 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Completely get that, had it most of this week but was especially bad @ 6am on Tuesday. Glad you feel better  here if you need

957042723114180609 2018-01-26 00:09:00 UTC <MusicFreak20> Potential pros of new meds that I start next week: sleep better and be less depressed & anxious in general   Potential cons of new meds: gain 2 stone in the space of 2 months and feel depressed about that instead   Fucking. Lush. 
957042178206961664 2018-01-26 00:06:50 UTC <MusicFreak20> @fakehappy101 It may do, but I can easily drift off to sleep anywhere but my bed. As soon as I'm in bed I'm wide awake  I think I'm just going to have to find something to do to wear myself out. Thanks tho

938841634854326273 2017-12-07 18:44:23 UTC <MusicFreak20> @DLChamplin @siestasestra I really enjoyed it! I was nervous at first but I gradually eased into it and found it very helpful. I'm hoping to go back again next month 
938514604463939584 2017-12-06 21:04:53 UTC <MusicFreak20> @DLChamplin I managed to talk and not get too flustered. It's all a bit new and scary but making positive steps in the right direction   Thank you for being so lovely!

931502306494992385 2017-11-17 12:40:31 UTC <MusicFreak20> I'm hoping Dr Akopian comes back in this season of @CW_CrazyXGF. I miss @michaelhyatt16 and have a mighty need for more Dream Ghost type numbers  #CrazyExGirlfriendpic.twitter.com/8nXM51UwZQ
931245326253674496 2017-11-16 19:39:22 UTC <MusicFreak20> This was basically me yesterday, so I ended up having to walk around a local park 3 times to burn off excess anxious energy   (Plus I've been listening to the #CrazyExGirlfriend playlist a lot on YouTube so it's stuck in my head okay? )  All good for now tho pic.twitter.com/vG10s7Q7Dj
931244460335419392 2017-11-16 19:35:55 UTC <MusicFreak20> @DLChamplin "Bear, I'm not afraid!"   Still one of my favourite songs from all 3 seasons 
930544125946028033 2017-11-14 21:13:02 UTC <MusicFreak20> I feel that this sums up the last episode of @CW_CrazyXGF very well.    Full article is here: http://observationdeck.kinja.com/sexy-french-depression-the-existentialism-of-crazy-e-1820386361 #CrazyExGirlfriendpic.twitter.com/VVY1FE25yH
930426987327426561 2017-11-14 13:27:34 UTC <MusicFreak20> Hyped to see @ENTERSHIKARI next week!! It's going to be awesome 
930238069411893249 2017-11-13 00:56:53 UTC <MusicFreak20> YESSSS  I'M SO HYPED FOR THIS https://twitter.com/falloutboy/status/930180774229405697
929735015440711680 2017-11-12 15:37:55 UTC <MusicFreak20> @crazyxgfwriters @Racheldoesstuff @alinebmckenna @CW_CrazyXGF @jackdolgen This week's episode was so well written and so well done. I can't say it enough, this show is so real and raw and so needed on television. Thank you 
929577846258925568 2017-11-11 05:13:23 UTC <MusicFreak20> @EscapologistFi 1000% agree with this! This whole episode was a punch in my emotional gut but damn it was so well done. I've been in a bit of an emotionally stunned trance ever since. I love this show much 
929574046618062849 2017-11-11 04:58:18 UTC <MusicFreak20> @JTGayMe That ties in SO well with title too...damn they sneak things in without you even noticing! The flight attendant did the voiceover in the butter commercial and is one of the show's writers. This show never fails to amaze me
929562048400363521 2017-11-11 04:10:37 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Racheldoesstuff So I've just had a conversation about this week's @CW_CrazyXGF with a girl I've never spoken to before like EVER and it has lead to an open discussion about mental health in general. THIS is the power shows can have. I love #CrazyExGirlfriend so much it's unreal@racheldoesstuff
929547229832056832 2017-11-11 03:11:44 UTC <MusicFreak20> All I'm going to say is: thank you @Racheldoesstuff, @alinebmckenna & @crazyxgfwriters. This week's episode is so real and raw and so so needed. Thank you so so SO much. You guys are awesome  #CrazyExGirlfriend (3/3)
929546632097648642 2017-11-11 03:09:21 UTC <MusicFreak20> Not going to say that things are all 100% peachy now, because that's unrealistic. I have my up days and I have my down days. But for now I'm trying to focus on the ups more instead of the downs. #CrazyExGirlfriend (2/??)
929546047210360832 2017-11-11 03:07:02 UTC <MusicFreak20> This week's episode of @CW_CrazyXGF hit me hard. It is v.important to talk about these things. I've been in that place numerous times, used to od daily on painkillers til my body shook as a teenager and did other harmful things. #CrazyExGirlfriend (1/?)
929397783278301184 2017-11-11 17:17:53 UTC <MusicFreak20> Happy Birthday @emmablackery!! Hope you have a fab day and know that we all love you and have your back   Keep rockin'   (And listen to 26 by @paramore like all day bc that's probably what I'd do tbh)

968904018910212098 2018-02-28 17:41:34 UTC <MusicFreak20> @paramofe It's honestly no problem! They're super cute! 
968897953984376833 2018-02-28 17:17:28 UTC <MusicFreak20> @paramofe No problem! Also just treated myself to your photo prints too 
968893305072300032 2018-02-28 16:58:59 UTC <MusicFreak20> @paramofe It's all good! I'm excited for my RCB shirt, think it's gonna look amazing in spring 
968891571830689795 2018-02-28 16:52:06 UTC <MusicFreak20> @USparamoreUK I think I need to order these when I have some money 
968884702055714817 2018-02-28 16:24:48 UTC <MusicFreak20> @paramofe Probably one of my favourite covers ever

968622627668529153 2018-02-27 23:03:25 UTC <MusicFreak20> Actually getting somewhere with doctors, new meds that should hopefully help and a way of moving forward. This has been a long time coming, but I'm glad it's finally happening 
968117306143461376 2018-02-26 13:35:27 UTC <MusicFreak20> All I can think about is this event we're doing tonight and I'm already fucking anxious about it. Volunteered myself for a sociable role on one of my good days...now I'm dreading tonight.

967902274176606208 2018-02-25 23:20:59 UTC <MusicFreak20> I can already tell that this will be me tomorrow. Remind me why I offered myself to fulfill a role that involves me having to actually interact with people? https://twitter.com/bleuvaIentine/status/967112203785601024
967900859127484417 2018-02-25 23:15:22 UTC <MusicFreak20> Episodes of TV shows to watch on a bad day:   S2 E9 of #OneDayAtATime & S1 E15 of #CrazyExGirlfriend.   Doesn't make everything magically better but it makes the day a bit easier

967009726168031232 2018-02-23 12:14:19 UTC <MusicFreak20> @paramofe Your designs are so cool! I need to up my art game, I'm leaving uni soon so need to get into this kind of thing more!  I'll be picking them up next week, they are honestly gorgeous! 
966864129255452672 2018-02-22 02:35:46 UTC <MusicFreak20> @paramofe Haha it's all good! I already have the RCB one pre-ordered from you but I think I need more plus your photo prints too bc they're Hella cute 
966813853735583746 2018-02-22 23:15:59 UTC <MusicFreak20> @paramofe I want like all of the AL tees  between your designs and Paramore's, I'm broke af  I get paid next week so may treat myself then 
966811085377597440 2018-02-22 23:04:59 UTC <MusicFreak20> Treated myself to some Lush bubble bars today and @awildetweet made me use a whole one for once   (this was a prettier deep peachy colour in real life tbh but whatevs)pic.twitter.com/IVSn9XtJMn
966722493309505536 2018-02-22 17:12:57 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior Haha yeah, I'm pretty much obsessed with them 
966660249372553216 2018-02-22 13:05:37 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior Haha just a lil bit   I've loved Paramore since I was like 14, I have two pmore tattoos atm but I'm planning to get more 
966660063040622592 2018-02-22 13:04:53 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior The issue that I have is that a lot of the bad things that I do are on impulse so I don't think before I do them and don't realise the damage I've done until afterwards. It means the rational side of me doesn't think to contact people if I need to etc, it's such a pain 
966659645317304320 2018-02-22 13:03:13 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior I take it as a silver lining from a bad event...but it's different for everyone I guess   I'm finally becoming more able to ask for help when I need it but it's a work in progress as it's something I really struggle with
966659202704920576 2018-02-22 13:01:28 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior It's there usual course of action apparently, which I totally get but right now if I'm not getting that I just need to go somewhere to vent so things don't get too much and boil over again. Trying to get that sorted now
966658919224545280 2018-02-22 13:00:20 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior My mum sorted it all out today so I can actually call people and stuff now which is good!   Yeah I think it'll be good for me and I need it but I'm just anxious about it all tbh, there's so much going on
966631331575877632 2018-02-22 11:10:43 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior Yeah, I know I need it but group therapy sounds so freaking scary. I haven't been able to call people because my phone got cut off last week. When I was in a crisis on Monday, I had to find WiFi somewhere to call my friend. I'm going to try and use the crisis team in future.
966630813835014145 2018-02-22 11:08:39 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior I apparently can't have therapy with a psychiatrist/therapist until I have the emotional coping skills ready in case any difficulty emotions arise
966630640748724226 2018-02-22 11:07:58 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior Yeah they do - although after an incident on Monday they've said I now need a high intensity course instead of the low intensity course that they were originally going to give to me.

966505875442716673 2018-02-21 02:52:12 UTC <MusicFreak20> @indie_warrior I've got wait to be put on the emotional coping skills course but may have a wait of up to 4 & a half months for it. I have traits of BPD but they don't believe my case to be 'severe' enough for DBT
966504973080068096 2018-02-21 02:48:37 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Me with these fucking meds mate, what a fucking M O O D

965846121204649985 2018-02-19 07:10:34 UTC <MusicFreak20> No wonder people in hospital are constantly sleeping when you get easily woken up by someone having a coughing fit or asked what you want for breakfast...  I'm gonna need to nap on and off today man
965420099472646144 2018-02-18 02:57:43 UTC <MusicFreak20> @megandelrey @itzzkait @brelixir I was in freaking tears, that whole episode had me sobbing 
965353039178723330 2018-02-18 22:31:14 UTC <MusicFreak20> Also: is it too early to campaign for #CrazyExGirlfriendSeason4?? Because there are so many things I need to know!!

964280951156207619 2018-02-15 23:31:08 UTC <MusicFreak20> I  AM  H Y P E D https://twitter.com/DisneyPixar/status/963983180943433729
964272298445475845 2018-02-15 22:56:45 UTC <MusicFreak20> S1E13 of #OneDayAtATime had me in tears. I didn't realise I needed that cry today...but it was a damn good cry and what an episode. Officially obsessed with this show now. 
964246459670585345 2018-02-15 21:14:05 UTC <MusicFreak20> I did however spend a lovely afternoon with my friend Sammy today & that made my heart happy & warm & my stomach full of tea & cake. Today was a much needed rest day where I could (try my best to) not worry about anything but enjoying myself guilt free pic.twitter.com/TWo19Wqy9P
964245188637089792 2018-02-15 21:09:02 UTC <MusicFreak20> I'm more so frustrated as hell because not one single professional can agree with another professional on what I have and I just want & desperately need a way of moving forward now. I'm so tired of this.
964244508442537984 2018-02-15 21:06:20 UTC <MusicFreak20> I honestly appreciate every ounce of support I get but mental illness is so individual, it's not a one size fits all thing.  I don't fit the stereotype but that doesn't make any diagnosis I have invalid because I don't fit those stereotypes (if I ever get a concrete one lmao).
964242884798140417 2018-02-15 20:59:53 UTC <MusicFreak20> "But you don't look/act like you're bipolar/borderline/*insert other mental illness here*"    Like everyone is different anyways so everyone's mental illness and how that manifests itself is therefore different person to person too...like are we are supposed to act the same??
964103428342468608 2018-02-15 11:45:44 UTC <MusicFreak20> I'm just so confused and I need SOMEONE to agree on something so I can ensure I can get the best treatment and have a quality of life. I'm so tired of going back and forth between services and not getting any clear answers 
964103121520726017 2018-02-15 11:44:30 UTC <MusicFreak20> So my GP and the Mental Health Nurse I saw believe I have anxiety and depression, the psychiatrist I saw believes I have bipolar type 2, my mental health advisor believes I have emotional instability and now I've just been told by someone else that I have traits of EUPD.
964102278276964352 2018-02-15 11:41:09 UTC <MusicFreak20> Even more fucking confused than I was before my appointment today. My brain freaking hurts now, can't get a straight answer out of anyone I'm assessed by and my phone has been cut off again. Fucking brilliant 
963971053549735936 2018-02-14 02:59:43 UTC <MusicFreak20> This was basically me yesterday   Surprisingly, everything has been pretty good today https://twitter.com/sosadtoday/status/963968622828847104
963970580268580865 2018-02-14 02:57:50 UTC <MusicFreak20> One Day At A Time is actually pretty great and I can't believe I've been sleeping on this show. I'm only 5 episodes in but I'm really digging it so far 
963968850936156160 2018-02-14 02:50:58 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde I always record some of my fave songs at a gig for this exact reason. I love to relive those moments 
963895340553461761 2018-02-14 21:58:52 UTC <MusicFreak20> Me: why am I gaining weight when I've been losing it the past few months?   Also me: eats junk food and cba to go to the gym and is on meds that can cause weight gain   No fucking clue man 
963860369554001922 2018-02-14 19:39:54 UTC <MusicFreak20> I always related to this song with the loss of my Gran being so raw, even nearly half a decade later. This song is seriously a masterpiece https://twitter.com/RouReynolds/status/963858605173821441
963827313057116161 2018-02-14 17:28:33 UTC <MusicFreak20> We're not that big on Valentine's Day but just wanted to remind y'all that this guy is a fucking gem and I'm so lucky to have him in my life. Don't know what I'd do without him pic.twitter.com/GAZFzCaBVl

963517537462947840 2018-02-13 20:57:36 UTC <MusicFreak20> Also appointments before 10am should be illegal. 9.30am MH appointment on Thursday and I have 0 ideas as to how I'm going to get up before that time let alone be there awake & dressed fucking hell
963517089586786304 2018-02-13 20:55:50 UTC <MusicFreak20> I'm seeing everyone enjoying pancake day & I'm just here like having a crisis about my own existence 
963510264372039680 2018-02-13 20:28:42 UTC <MusicFreak20> Will I find the energy and motivation to go downstairs to cook dinner for myself?   We'll find out after these messages
963501596104589312 2018-02-13 19:54:16 UTC <MusicFreak20> I wholeheartedly support & encourage self love but when I'm by myself I fucking hate everything about me and think of every single thing I've done wrong so I think I might be a bit hypocritical tbh???
963233313468108800 2018-02-12 02:08:12 UTC <MusicFreak20> @YouRuinEveryPod That's a good head canon, I shall accept it as fact unless stated otherwise!
963228763369730051 2018-02-12 01:50:07 UTC <MusicFreak20> @YouRuinEveryPod So am I   Why did we never find out what happened to Susan? Is she okay?
963212772359196672 2018-02-12 00:46:35 UTC <MusicFreak20> This song is so ridiculous but it makes me laugh so I love it and Idec   (I'm so not ready for this season to finish this week )  #CrazyExGirlfriend #IGoToTheZoopic.twitter.com/j8J8GDhjTt

962746127694155783 2018-02-11 17:52:18 UTC <MusicFreak20> The thought of facing people tomorrow and interacting with them and trying to appear normal fills me with D R E A D
962741433663918080 2018-02-11 17:33:39 UTC <MusicFreak20> Know that I need to do work but know that I probably won't have the motivation to actually do any of it until like 2am when I should be sleeping.   Fuck this depressive rut. Fuck this. Fuck this. Fuck this.
962726667734192128 2018-02-11 16:34:58 UTC <MusicFreak20> I've got to try and pretend to be a normal functioning human being tomorrow...let's see how well that goes...
962469896209813504 2018-02-10 23:34:39 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Racheldoesstuff @AmyBedster IT'S A PLAN! 
962464225703747584 2018-02-10 23:12:07 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Racheldoesstuff @AmyBedster Omg yes that would be amazing!! 
962463567336353792 2018-02-10 23:09:30 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Racheldoesstuff @AmyBedster If she did a tour I'd totally be down to follow her around the UK tbh! 
962425610197970944 2018-02-10 20:38:41 UTC <MusicFreak20> One of my favourite songs from this season https://twitter.com/Lanky_Nibz/status/962368778788098049
962425017047879680 2018-02-10 20:36:19 UTC <MusicFreak20> This is probably still my favourite ever episode of @CW_CrazyXGF. Need my own Akopes Dream Ghost in my life. @michaelhyatt16 still kills it in this pic.twitter.com/k4FQnudXFF
962416989858947072 2018-02-10 20:04:25 UTC <MusicFreak20> @yelyahwilliams and @Racheldoesstuff fucking me up emotionally...nothing out of the ordinary then 
962416271785627649 2018-02-10 20:01:34 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Racheldoesstuff I can never have enough Rachel Bloom songs tbh  (but I also love @DLChamplin songs so you see my predicament here). Y'all are fab

962108422689869826 2018-02-09 23:38:17 UTC <MusicFreak20> Seeing everyone on my course do work and be productive and stuff and I'm barely getting anything done because I'm spending like 12 hours in bed a day. Fml, I fucking hate this   Maybe I'll be productive over the weekend, who knows

960970986530189313 2018-02-06 20:18:31 UTC <MusicFreak20> (if y'all couldn't tell already, Twitter is where I come to vent about my existence)
960968941026889731 2018-02-06 20:10:24 UTC <MusicFreak20> @michaelhyatt16 @Racheldoesstuff Something to lighten my mood a bit. Thank you for this 
960967499280986113 2018-02-06 20:04:40 UTC <MusicFreak20> Sad feels rant over for now I guess 
960967183131185152 2018-02-06 20:03:25 UTC <MusicFreak20> Eugh. Today started off so well and now I'm just fucking sick of it. I need food and I need my bed.
960967056685494273 2018-02-06 20:02:54 UTC <MusicFreak20> I weird people out and make them uncomfortable and I just need to stop trying to get people to like me because it's fucking weird and quite frankly, sad.
960966953006522368 2018-02-06 20:02:30 UTC <MusicFreak20> And I hate myself for desperately trying to fit in. I hate it I hate it I HATE IT. I just want to be normal and not have a brain that has its metaphorical finger on the self destruct button every other week.
960966829677207552 2018-02-06 20:02:00 UTC <MusicFreak20> That's all I've ever wanted in life. To be fucking normal. To fit in and not weird people out and have friends who like me for me. But I've always been 'that' kid. Into obscure bands or TV shows or drawing or stuff that no one else seems to like.
960966753353453568 2018-02-06 20:01:42 UTC <MusicFreak20> Seeing all the appointments I have lined up whether they're about meds or being assessed or just checking to see that I haven't topped myself yet makes me realise how abnormal I am. How NOT normal I am.
960963565061582848 2018-02-06 19:49:02 UTC <MusicFreak20> I watched the last episode of S1 of My Mad Fat Diary and that was a MISTAKE   Bringing on all them sad feels
960962919772114945 2018-02-06 19:46:28 UTC <MusicFreak20> @CraftsyTardis It's all good, see the doctor tomorrow so we'll see what she says to do next
960943208250437632 2018-02-06 18:28:08 UTC <MusicFreak20> Also stress management course: here's a letter describing how your anxiety and depression have got worse but also don't both coming back to us rn because you have an initial assessment somewhere else  Cheers man, thanks for that much appreciated 
960941820833423362 2018-02-06 18:22:38 UTC <MusicFreak20> Why the fuck am I so fucking awkward??? I just make people uncomfortable with my presence and I should just go home and not bother people man

960209138063200256 2018-02-04 17:51:12 UTC <MusicFreak20> I also realised with this week's episode how much I relate to Rebecca's character and her struggles with her mental health. Having a character in a show that I can relate to on such a deep level truly means a lot. Thank you @Racheldoesstuff  #CrazyExGirlfriend #CXG #CXGF

959774487033106432 2018-02-03 13:04:04 UTC <MusicFreak20> Apparently I've been hyperventilating in my sleep...cool cool cool cool so these tablets make me have weird dreams and that is how my body deals with if 
959581536046723072 2018-02-02 00:17:21 UTC <MusicFreak20> Tbh I think my immune system has suppressed this cold on and off for three weeks but hasn't got rid of it entirely so it keeps coming back with a vengeance 
959578987948396550 2018-02-02 00:07:13 UTC <MusicFreak20> Today I've eaten too much food but still want more and have had too much sleep but still want more. Can I not be ill for the third week in a row please? Just want to actually be able to get stuff done 
959550075302182912 2018-02-02 22:12:20 UTC <MusicFreak20> Pretty sure I have this cold that's going round...again. Fucking brilliant 
959544843818201088 2018-02-02 21:51:32 UTC <MusicFreak20> I also keep craving bad food and would happily order another takeaway tonight but instead I'm actually going to get off my arse and cook. Adulting is hard man 
959544538783240192 2018-02-02 21:50:20 UTC <MusicFreak20> My nap basically turned into a mini sleep wth 
959484780625743873 2018-02-02 17:52:52 UTC <MusicFreak20> The combination of my new meds and possible cold coming back means that my brain has the comprehension speed of a slug today. I need a nap 
959428554978185216 2018-02-02 14:09:27 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Girliekick Thank you so much  and yeah I completely get that, they're all very similar. Fingers crossed I will have my own Rebecca Bunch diagnosis moment

959220514697904133 2018-02-01 00:22:46 UTC <MusicFreak20> @hollyykinss Thank you! GP is trying to get that all arranged for me and I have an appointment in two weeks time. Hope you're well on the road to recovery now  Thank you so much, here to chat as well if you need to xxx
959204139736723457 2018-02-01 23:17:42 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Yeah I guess so, I've never tried either personally tbh. Just like to sleep it off most of the time 
959202983157358592 2018-02-01 23:13:06 UTC <MusicFreak20> Think I've just had a week's worth of sugar in one milkshake. Rip me 
959202796171034624 2018-02-01 23:12:22 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Good old power nap my friend told me hot lemonade is good for when you're ill but pls don't hold me to that bc I've legit never tried it myself 
959182961504608256 2018-02-01 21:53:33 UTC <MusicFreak20> @trashwatts I just basically want to buy everything but my bank account is saying don't you dare you little shit you've spent enough money already 
959180683284484098 2018-02-01 21:44:30 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Soup and rest for you 
959180521556402177 2018-02-01 21:43:51 UTC <MusicFreak20> @trashwatts Basically me rn  I've ordered the RCB tee but I am SO tempted to go back and get the Paramore is a band! tee, the cap, tour three poster and the edited photos of the band from tour three as well (even though I could barely afford the first tee but whatevs ) 
959179271787999232 2018-02-01 21:38:53 UTC <MusicFreak20> I realise that I should've made a thread with my previous tweets...I'm a pleb

959174808150990848 2018-02-01 21:21:09 UTC <MusicFreak20> #TimetoTalk I joke a lot about stuff but my mental health has been absolutely shit the past few months (and years tbh). But I'm trying to get better this time.   So all I can say is, just be kind please bc you never know what someone is going through.   Just be kind.  3/3
959174023585370112 2018-02-01 21:18:02 UTC <MusicFreak20> #TimetoTalk Now I know Anxiety and Depression are fairly common, but had no idea how common Bipolar Disorder Type 2 and Borderline Personality Disorder were. Now the confusion surrounding my diagnosis is that they are all very similar, meaning that I fit some traits of them 2/3
959173264345124870 2018-02-01 21:15:01 UTC <MusicFreak20> #TimetoTalk Might as well spread a bit of awareness I guess (because no one really told me about them before, I'm awaiting further assessment for this so it's nothing concrete). I *potentially* have Bipolar Disorder Type 2, Borderline Personality Disorder, Depression &Anxiety 1/3
959166808656932864 2018-02-01 20:49:22 UTC <MusicFreak20> @paramofe No problem! I'll be sure to take lots of photos in it when it arrives! 
959159839082668037 2018-02-01 20:21:40 UTC <MusicFreak20> Ordered my Rose Colored Boy tee from @paramofe and I am already so psyched to get it 
959153547085414400 2018-02-01 19:56:40 UTC <MusicFreak20> Yaaaaaas    Convinced @zerothreex to get a takeaway cos I'm a fat bastard who likes to eat all the wrong things

959144015391272960 2018-02-01 19:18:47 UTC <MusicFreak20> When you want takeaway for dinner but @zerothreex decides for once to be the one who says we should cook...the tables have turned 
959141756712480771 2018-02-01 19:09:49 UTC <MusicFreak20> @paramofe I've literally set a timer so.i don't miss it!! I'm grabbing myself a Rose Colored Boy tee 
959140373741428736 2018-02-01 19:04:19 UTC <MusicFreak20> Here I was thinking the cat is like obese and the vet says he's like the ideal weight   And then there's my fat ass considering whether or not to order a takeaway tonight even though we got food shopping delivered today 
959075765995360256 2018-02-01 14:47:36 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Yeah it fucking sucks  it's frustrating as hell
959046145967353857 2018-02-01 12:49:54 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde According to them there is apparently. Constantly stuck in limbo with everyone...either my case is too serious for one service or not serious enough for another. I can't bloody win 
959043173766090753 2018-02-01 12:38:05 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Nope...they legit told me this. Stuck with my zombie meds for now I guess 
959039584423301120 2018-02-01 12:23:49 UTC <MusicFreak20> Stress management course people: as you're getting help from somewhere else you can't come here any more.  Yeah that's fucking helped my stress levels thanks   I only have an initial appointment it's not even anything concrete yet but cool cheers man much appreciated

959012803989458944 2018-02-01 10:37:24 UTC <MusicFreak20> One of my faves https://twitter.com/miseryroute/status/958871654263869440
958794246378672129 2018-01-31 20:08:56 UTC <MusicFreak20> 1 dose of meds taken and I already feel the need to eat EVERYTHING. Gonna get fat again, yay 
958792145984540673 2018-01-31 20:00:35 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Yeah just a bit that's on a half dose as well, can't imagine what I'm going to be like on the full dose next week 
958778290579427328 2018-01-31 19:05:32 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde It was ridiculous... Al woke me up to move me to be around 4am and apparently it was like I was drunk...I have no recollection for most of last night tbh
958774308549120000 2018-01-31 18:49:42 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Definitely! Had about 14 hours last night bc of new meds and it feels like I've not slept that well since I left the womb go nap and hope you feel better soon 
958767463566598145 2018-01-31 18:22:31 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde No problem!  Sleep solves everything! 
958766230348984320 2018-01-31 18:17:36 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Sending you some good vibes 
958765986752204800 2018-01-31 18:16:38 UTC <MusicFreak20> When you accidentally like something from 2012 on someone's Facebook profile and have to unlike it real quick  I think that's a sign that I need to do work and stay the fuck off of Facebook 
958697440219222021 2018-01-31 13:44:16 UTC <MusicFreak20> I've literally slept for nearly 14 hours... I guess that's a good thing?? 
958481166532857858 2018-01-30 23:24:52 UTC <MusicFreak20> New meds have begun (even tho I was supposed to take them last night oops). Let's see how we go with these 
958425906300768259 2018-01-30 19:45:17 UTC <MusicFreak20> Also my tutor is pissed off at me so that's fun, yay   At least I emailed and didn't just not turn up
958425712272248837 2018-01-30 19:44:31 UTC <MusicFreak20> One of the positives I can take from today though: doctor has arranged a psych appointment for me to be assessed properly. This is probably the most helpful and genuinely understanding GP that I've ever had in regards to my mental health.
958425302832697344 2018-01-30 19:42:53 UTC <MusicFreak20> Also feel like I'm annoying people by messaging them so maybe it's just best to shut the hell up and stop whining about my issues
958425022409986048 2018-01-30 19:41:46 UTC <MusicFreak20> Hangover + missed meds is not a good combo 
958280052734676993 2018-01-30 10:05:43 UTC <MusicFreak20> Fuck this hangover, feels like my brain is going to explode 
958165826150027265 2018-01-29 02:31:49 UTC <MusicFreak20> Kinda want to sleep, kinda need food, kinda need a cigarette... What is my life 
958165413430427649 2018-01-29 02:30:11 UTC <MusicFreak20> I need a cigarette and sleep tbh wtf I'm so tired 
958163102880673792 2018-01-29 02:21:00 UTC <MusicFreak20> Pretty much https://twitter.com/sosadtoday/status/958138976728215553

958067870864478209 2018-01-29 20:02:35 UTC <MusicFreak20> All the paras are also talking about their essay and topics I have no clue about...I have no idea what's going on 
958067447910805504 2018-01-29 20:00:54 UTC <MusicFreak20> A 'casual' drink and food.out can easily spiral into a full on night out...let's see how this goes 
958011533971386368 2018-01-29 16:18:43 UTC <MusicFreak20> Most of the time tbh https://twitter.com/sosadtoday/status/957692278621032451
958010796512043010 2018-01-29 16:15:47 UTC <MusicFreak20> Don't talk to me about frustration until you have to sit there for 20 minutes trying to put the straps back on a strapless bra. That shit is frustrating as hell.
957996527062003712 2018-01-29 15:19:05 UTC <MusicFreak20> Fucking gutted about @Pink not winning a Grammy last night. And I'm also pissed that she didn't get a standing ovation for her stunning performance of Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken. Her voice continues to blow me away. Thank you for sharing your talent Alecia.

957784755520581634 2018-01-28 01:17:35 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Just a bit...can be a bit intimidating when you're anxious about being out of your house in the first place

957782295569682439 2018-01-28 01:07:48 UTC <MusicFreak20> This along w/ Beautiful Trauma by @Pink & The Spark by @ENTERSHIKARI were my top albums of 2017. I love them all so much https://twitter.com/LEMONADEYELYAH/status/957761525938380800
957781802550165504 2018-01-28 01:05:51 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Thank you so much, that means a lot!    Seriously it's my new fave thing rn   Me and my friend Jess forgot to draw something for the drawing round once and the guy was like 'well clearly your drawing is invisible' yep...
957762580445057026 2018-01-28 23:49:28 UTC <MusicFreak20> On the other hand - I thought that at the start of this academic year I would have like 1 friend. And actually, I've genuinely made some really lovely friends and that's making me fucking smile like a doofus rn??? 
957762256300904448 2018-01-28 23:48:10 UTC <MusicFreak20> Feeling a bit bleh now that everyone is gone and not sure what to do with myself 
957761930822934529 2018-01-28 23:46:53 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Doing my best, just hoping it works out this time round   (I also just saw your name change and it cracked me up omd )
957760676759506945 2018-01-28 23:41:54 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Much appreciated just may be in my own bubble in the studio this week
957760161392840705 2018-01-28 23:39:51 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Thank you, that means so much I may just be spaced out/tripping balls this week  we'll know by Wednesday apparently 
957734682690576385 2018-01-28 21:58:36 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Courtxamber Seeing Paramore live twice in one year would be amazing 
957734531871789057 2018-01-28 21:58:00 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Courtxamber Mine was accidentally thrown away as boyfriend didn't check the bag  he's tried to find me another one but with no luck 
957733244874772480 2018-01-28 21:52:54 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Courtxamber I was absolutely gutted! Lost my Low Key No Pressure pin badge too  Got my fingers crossed for them to be at R&L!! 
957732465367502848 2018-01-28 21:49:48 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Courtxamber We missed the first two songs when we saw them as we didn't realise they'd be on at 8.45 and they were some.kf the ones that I was looking forward to seeing live most 
957730668301217792 2018-01-28 21:42:39 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Courtxamber I miss them live already 
957730240868093953 2018-01-28 21:40:57 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Courtxamber Haha omg that would definitely be me 
957728276453224448 2018-01-28 21:33:09 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Courtxamber I'd be so freaking happy!!  If Paramore get announced I'm buying tickets!!  (I love both hands but Paramore would be the main draw for me)
957726750666051586 2018-01-28 21:27:05 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde No problem  and I probably will need hugs and laughs over the next few weeks adjusting to new meds  thank you sweetie x
957686067263614977 2018-01-28 18:45:26 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde Completely get that, had it most of this week but was especially bad @ 6am on Tuesday. Glad you feel better  here if you need 
957678955162718208 2018-01-28 18:17:10 UTC <MusicFreak20> It's no wonder that I got lyrics from this part of this song. This is like some ethereal spacey out of body shit and I love it sm https://twitter.com/TheParamoreCity/status/957677623441809408

957677972697346048 2018-01-28 18:13:16 UTC <MusicFreak20> @retr0grxde For once I didn't have a drunken meltdown last night  hope you're feeling better now!

957042723114180609 2018-01-26 00:09:00 UTC <MusicFreak20> Potential pros of new meds that I start next week: sleep better and be less depressed & anxious in general   Potential cons of new meds: gain 2 stone in the space of 2 months and feel depressed about that instead   Fucking. Lush. 
957042178206961664 2018-01-26 00:06:50 UTC <MusicFreak20> @fakehappy101 It may do, but I can easily drift off to sleep anywhere but my bed. As soon as I'm in bed I'm wide awake  I think I'm just going to have to find something to do to wear myself out. Thanks tho 
957014074050666496 2018-01-26 22:15:10 UTC <MusicFreak20> Tired tired tired tired tired. I could easily go to bed rn and I've barely been up over 12 hours. This is such fucking bullshit.

956054509092048897 2018-01-23 06:42:12 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Girliekick I was actually searching for that gif more than anything tbh because that is a total mood right now. Hopefully one will be made soon! 
956053558700466177 2018-01-23 06:38:25 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Girliekick Yeah I definitely need one of those! I also need a gif of "I don't want to do things or say things or face things" too. Thank you so much 
956048159351934976 2018-01-23 06:16:58 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Girliekick Yeah it does get a bit full on in the middle, not gonna lie. Will let you all know how I get on later today (I'm still awake and have to be up in 3 hours)

944684357960327169 2017-12-23 21:41:16 UTC <MusicFreak20> Perks of being home alone: being able to sing along to Crazy Ex Girlfriend with no volume limits  #CrazyExGirlfriend #StripAwayMyConscienceIsStillOneOfMyFaves @CW_CrazyXGF @Racheldoesstuff @alinebmckenna

943930596862103552 2017-12-21 19:46:06 UTC <MusicFreak20> Also I'm weirdly excited to be able to sit and watch @Brooklyn99FOX over Christmas to write about @iamstephbeatz and Rosa's coming out scene for my essay bc that scene is too important not to include okay 
943929964419788801 2017-12-21 19:43:35 UTC <MusicFreak20> I freaking ache so much it's ridiculous...can I have the knees of a 22 year old please??? 
943806213606789120 2017-12-21 11:31:51 UTC <MusicFreak20> The first time I listened to AL, I was in the bath and had dedicated a full hour to nothing but listening to the album & I sobbed. Some of the lyrics really hit home for me, & it is now my comfort-go-to album as well.

939637201792655360 2017-12-09 23:25:41 UTC <MusicFreak20> Seriously, YouTube Rewind was absolute bullshit this year (and has been progressively getting worse the past few years). I'm so glad that this has been addressed. No matter how 'big' you are, no one should be fucking exploited like this.

938841634854326273 2017-12-07 18:44:23 UTC <MusicFreak20> @DLChamplin @siestasestra I really enjoyed it! I was nervous at first but I gradually eased into it and found it very helpful. I'm hoping to go back again next month 
938514604463939584 2017-12-06 21:04:53 UTC <MusicFreak20> @DLChamplin I managed to talk and not get too flustered. It's all a bit new and scary but making positive steps in the right direction   Thank you for being so lovely!

937126289366028291 2017-12-02 01:08:13 UTC <MusicFreak20> As if I fell asleep in the bath for like an hour earlier, got out and dressed and napped for an hour and a half and now could quite easily go to bed and sleep for like 8 hours...  Work + new meds kicking in = me feeling fucking shattered 
936647355495043072 2017-12-01 17:25:06 UTC <MusicFreak20> @emmablackery Crazy Ex Girlfriend is one of my favourite TV shows of all time  - it's a musical comedy that also tackles topics such as mental health and stuff and all the episodes so far are available on Netflix

931245326253674496 2017-11-16 19:39:22 UTC <MusicFreak20> This was basically me yesterday, so I ended up having to walk around a local park 3 times to burn off excess anxious energy   (Plus I've been listening to the #CrazyExGirlfriend playlist a lot on YouTube so it's stuck in my head okay? )  All good for now tho pic.twitter.com/vG10s7Q7Dj
931244460335419392 2017-11-16 19:35:55 UTC <MusicFreak20> @DLChamplin "Bear, I'm not afraid!"   Still one of my favourite songs from all 3 seasons 
930544125946028033 2017-11-14 21:13:02 UTC <MusicFreak20> I feel that this sums up the last episode of @CW_CrazyXGF very well.    Full article is here: http://observationdeck.kinja.com/sexy-french-depression-the-existentialism-of-crazy-e-1820386361 #CrazyExGirlfriendpic.twitter.com/VVY1FE25yH

929735015440711680 2017-11-12 15:37:55 UTC <MusicFreak20> @crazyxgfwriters @Racheldoesstuff @alinebmckenna @CW_CrazyXGF @jackdolgen This week's episode was so well written and so well done. I can't say it enough, this show is so real and raw and so needed on television. Thank you 
929577846258925568 2017-11-11 05:13:23 UTC <MusicFreak20> @EscapologistFi 1000% agree with this! This whole episode was a punch in my emotional gut but damn it was so well done. I've been in a bit of an emotionally stunned trance ever since. I love this show much 
929574046618062849 2017-11-11 04:58:18 UTC <MusicFreak20> @JTGayMe That ties in SO well with title too...damn they sneak things in without you even noticing! The flight attendant did the voiceover in the butter commercial and is one of the show's writers. This show never fails to amaze me
929562048400363521 2017-11-11 04:10:37 UTC <MusicFreak20> @Racheldoesstuff So I've just had a conversation about this week's @CW_CrazyXGF with a girl I've never spoken to before like EVER and it has lead to an open discussion about mental health in general. THIS is the power shows can have. I love #CrazyExGirlfriend so much it's unreal@racheldoesstuff
929547229832056832 2017-11-11 03:11:44 UTC <MusicFreak20> All I'm going to say is: thank you @Racheldoesstuff, @alinebmckenna & @crazyxgfwriters. This week's episode is so real and raw and so so needed. Thank you so so SO much. You guys are awesome  #CrazyExGirlfriend (3/3)
929546632097648642 2017-11-11 03:09:21 UTC <MusicFreak20> Not going to say that things are all 100% peachy now, because that's unrealistic. I have my up days and I have my down days. But for now I'm trying to focus on the ups more instead of the downs. #CrazyExGirlfriend (2/??)
929546047210360832 2017-11-11 03:07:02 UTC <MusicFreak20> This week's episode of @CW_CrazyXGF hit me hard. It is v.important to talk about these things.
