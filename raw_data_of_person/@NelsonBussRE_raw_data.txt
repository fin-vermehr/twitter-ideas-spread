The school security guard ran toward the danger unarmed and gave his life to protect children. He knew he didn't have a chance and went toward danger anyway. The young man in JROTC held the door for others to escape.

928326230214000640 2017-11-08 18:19:55 UTC <NelsonBussRE> @KyleBJorrey The new part of this battle was using Everett as a Trojan Horse. Having her lie throughout the campaign about her agenda, and capitalize on constituent anger over CVHS blundering to unseat incumbents.
928188378348011521 2017-11-08 09:12:08 UTC <NelsonBussRE> @ReporterDawn Not a very polite move there Tom. Yelling at other people's children definitely falls in the lack of decorum range of social behavior.

915453601987813376 2017-10-03 05:48:41 UTC <NelsonBussRE> @cctoaks @KyleBJorrey Don't take that too hard. Look at where it got them. Both of those papers are long gone.
915450807901839360 2017-10-03 05:37:35 UTC <NelsonBussRE> A Lancer and classmate from '91. So sorry to all who knew and loved him. #TOHShttps://twitter.com/TOHSAlumni/status/915383231930703874
915448719146758145 2017-10-03 05:29:17 UTC <NelsonBussRE> @ReporterDawn I was there an hour earlier.
915444414394146816 2017-10-03 05:12:11 UTC <NelsonBussRE> @CityofTO @KyleBJorrey Don't publish a story about the upcoming TO Street Fair on Oct 15th. 
915442937558851584 2017-10-03 05:06:19 UTC <NelsonBussRE> @KyleBJorrey When it comes to literature, all the sudden we're all experts.
915442837877006337 2017-10-03 05:05:55 UTC <NelsonBussRE> @KyleBJorrey Agreed. I'm sure these same people would not want to do the preflight checklist on a trip to Hawaii, or QC the code for their phone OS.
915440990336434176 2017-10-03 04:58:34 UTC <NelsonBussRE> @ReporterDawn I wonder if their list is public record?
915437254646030336 2017-10-03 04:43:44 UTC <NelsonBussRE> @ReporterDawn Does Oak Park have a Draconian policy regarding its literature that I am not aware of?
915436726662787072 2017-10-03 04:41:38 UTC <NelsonBussRE> @ReporterDawn If they could get on the admissions boards of the state universities and set admissions requirements as well, that might work.
915435697246310401 2017-10-03 04:37:32 UTC <NelsonBussRE> @CityofTO @KyleBJorrey Embarrassing that we elect people that don't appear to have a dog in the fight.
915433793896423424 2017-10-03 04:29:59 UTC <NelsonBussRE> @ReporterDawn Wait. What?

897697140440526848 2017-08-15 05:50:51 UTC <NelsonBussRE> @ReporterDawn Mr. Anderson is an MMA expert, find him.
897696727070912512 2017-08-15 05:49:12 UTC <NelsonBussRE> @SandeeCVUSD @KyleBJorrey Sometimes you have to put the common good ahead of your individual preference. Nothing wrong with that. In fact it is very brave.

897684780602544129 2017-08-15 05:01:44 UTC <NelsonBussRE> @KyleBJorrey I am completely unclear as to what is so offensive in this book that any of the Bard's plays doesn't far exceed. /2
897684592504717312 2017-08-15 05:00:59 UTC <NelsonBussRE> @KyleBJorrey I don't think Anderson has any idea what an MMA fight would be like. At all. Or an actual debate for that matter. /1
897682015801139200 2017-08-15 04:50:45 UTC <NelsonBussRE> @ReporterDawn I hope they lose their jobs for jeopardizing our school's reputation and our community's value as a great place to raise children.

897666896564293632 2017-08-15 03:50:40 UTC <NelsonBussRE> @ReporterDawn I am super unclear as to what content everyone actually disapproves of in this book.
