919535953852682240 2017-10-15 12:10:30 UTC <rhwigg> @StephenIgoe At this point, their expectation is to lose and lose big so no pride left

889621308513955847 2017-07-24 23:00:22 UTC <rhwigg> This is probably the most disturbing speech I have ever seen @realDonaldTrump give. It's a #boyscout rally not a campaign event.
889619809503244291 2017-07-24 22:54:25 UTC <rhwigg> @wpjenna @MsSparky58 Exactly. These kind dd have no idea that they are mere pawns in the Trump run to authoritarianism
889619550366552065 2017-07-24 22:53:23 UTC <rhwigg> @wpjenna Remember when presidents used to try to be inspirational and bring people together?  If these kids represent our future, I am terrified.
