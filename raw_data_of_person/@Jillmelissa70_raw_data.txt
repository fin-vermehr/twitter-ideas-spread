957463149787062273 2018-01-27 03:59:38 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @AshleyJudd So cool!
954524478662328320 2018-01-19 01:22:24 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @FINALLEVEL Happy Birthday Maximus! Looking good.
954071772185346048 2018-01-18 19:23:30 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @SpikeLee @Mariska @FINALLEVEL You are living the LIFE! I love it.

949015969891999745 2018-01-04 20:33:33 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @hwinkler4real right? Imagine Reagan sending that message during Cold War.
949013725079519232 2018-01-04 20:24:38 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @FINALLEVEL @taylorjwofford And lots of cameras everywhere. Lol
948706945032110080 2018-01-03 00:05:36 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @KTLA this is unbelievably sad and disturbing.
947666748609662976 2017-12-31 03:12:14 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @JordanPeele @dylanbrody I just saw the movie too. Best horror movie I've ever seen. Genuinely scary! Such a surprise.
947031141172703232 2017-12-30 09:06:33 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @DavidSpade @MannGunner I think I need a break from Twitter. Lol
947021573747122177 2017-12-30 08:28:32 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @washingtonpost for the same reason Harvey Weinstein kept abusing women. Because he can.
946659281046192128 2017-12-29 08:28:55 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @MiraSorvino I don't believe it can be learned instantaneously, but if you lead by consistent example they may follow suit in the future. :)
946317568440131584 2017-12-28 09:51:04 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @guardian so funny! I love it
946298038917541889 2017-12-28 08:33:28 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @ananavarro too much daydreaming about a new and different president in 2020 keeps me awake at night.
945063542130032640 2017-12-24 22:48:01 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @billmaher you are so crazy! I am missing your show already. Hurry back please!
945060772740177920 2017-12-24 22:37:01 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @vincentdonofrio Merry Christmas 2U. Thank U 4 being a genuinely caring role model on Twitter. U R so unique. Also, Happy New Year!
943300585805058048 2017-12-19 02:02:39 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @NBCTheVoice I don't know what to do with myself for 2 more hours before the show even begins! West Coast show times are torture.
943296423843397632 2017-12-19 01:46:07 UTC <Jillmelissa70> What if the only reason #MattDamon had a successful movie career is because he wasn't Harvey Weinstein's type...
943285499145478145 2017-12-19 01:02:43 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @iTunes @redmarlow it feels almost unfaithful to be this evenly torn between the final top 4 contestants. But i adore them all faithfully!
943023880234401792 2017-12-18 07:43:08 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @MileyCyrus @brookesimpson Congratulations on another mind-blowing  performance. I am a fan for life! So happy for you and Miley!!
943018237410676736 2017-12-18 07:20:42 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @AddisonAgen you are so inspiring. I can't believe a TV show is making me this emotional. So excited about tomorrow!!!
942302309458915328 2017-12-16 07:55:52 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @nbcsnl @KevinHart4real OMG! Kevin Hart was so great and everyone ice skating at the end made me cry! Love you guys so much!
941973513207824384 2017-12-16 10:09:21 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @ABC2020 This episode was so good! Seriously creepy, but so glad these people are speaking out.
941850018889084928 2017-12-15 01:58:37 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @FINALLEVEL @cocosworld @BabyChanelworld I knew it! She will be a STAR!
941082016765812736 2017-12-13 23:06:51 UTC <Jillmelissa70> I can't get the song "Sweet Home Alabama" out of my head today.
941052741723422720 2017-12-13 21:10:32 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @theforensicDr @ReelzChannel I have really missed seeing the show. Thank you!
941044878309392385 2017-12-13 20:39:17 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @RealPhilProctor me too. It takes a lot of practice. My mother does it so professionally, puts me to shame. "It's the thought that counts."
940831122048634881 2017-12-12 06:29:53 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @MorganJerkins Yes, I love it! Thank you for that
940829312202301440 2017-12-12 06:22:42 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @redmarlow @NBCTheVoice Way to go Red!! Whooooh!
940828878829912065 2017-12-12 06:20:59 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @MileyCyrus @NBCTheVoice @brookesimpson Congrats, I love y'all
940827294121291776 2017-12-12 06:14:41 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @keisharenee I was really stunned by the results tonight. You stole my heart Keisha Renee. I know i will hear you sing again. Much love 2u.
940826139727138816 2017-12-12 06:10:06 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @NBCTheVoice I am really happy for the finalists, but my heart was set on Keisha Renee. I look forward to hearing her sing again.
940791423909052416 2017-12-12 03:52:09 UTC <Jillmelissa70> I love you Alabama!
940787308067897344 2017-12-12 03:35:47 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @Alyssa_Milano thank you for everything you did to help!
940710365263937537 2017-12-12 22:30:03 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @KTLA this is so disturbing. Glad they found and arrested him though.
940708686607015937 2017-12-12 22:23:23 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @MerriamWebster @KTLA Thank you Merriam-Webster and KTLA. Sociology majors everywhere appreciate you clarifying the definition of feminism.
940501801932955648 2017-12-12 08:41:17 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @keisharenee you are so welcome
940494085516771328 2017-12-12 08:10:38 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @keisharenee @JessiTaylor10 Hello Jessi, I am so sorry to hear about your husband. My husband died a few years ago, it takes time to heal.
940491326365220864 2017-12-11 07:59:40 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @iamrachael88 I am so sorry! That sounds unbearable! Its still so cool that you get to live over there though.
940486252536537089 2017-12-11 07:39:30 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @MileyOfficial @MileyCyrus @iTunes You are a genius for choosing that song for Brooke! Congratulations! So happy for Team Miley.
940483141315182592 2017-12-11 07:27:08 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @brookesimpson holy moly! Do you even know how good that was?? You had me in tears, but in a good way! I'm speechless and your a goddess!
940465982690037760 2017-12-11 06:18:57 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @keisharenee I am just so happy that you are on the show! What an incredible performance. Congratulations again!
940461444591624192 2017-12-11 06:00:55 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @redmarlow @LadyJHOLLIDAY just wanted to echo that sentiment. You were always on my mind would be perfect for you. Loved ur performance too!
940456190198157312 2017-12-11 05:40:03 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @DavonFleming what are you trying to do to me? Davon!! Your rendition of Gravity was Levitating. So AMAZING! You are NOT going home. Period.
940132432736534528 2017-12-11 08:13:33 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @DKuzLA I just wanted to say WOW. I was so impressed with your patience and perseverance through that...convo.
940076325636775936 2017-12-10 04:30:36 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @sandee0802 @3rdStreet_Jesus @brettmumaw @Grantalope23 @DKuzLA thank you for everything you said. I get it as do so many others!
939964706265088000 2017-12-10 21:07:04 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @MayorOfLA So excited to hear this morning that you may run for president 2020.
939779541106438144 2017-12-10 08:51:17 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @ahmedtwinkie and sometimes all day long. It literally hurts.
939637900089552897 2017-12-09 23:28:27 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @FINALLEVEL its been 20 years since I even attempted to drive on ice. That's how much it freaks me out!
939275497627820032 2017-12-08 23:28:24 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @SCE repetitive power outages during online exams for college finals can give one the feeling of being utterly cursed.
939260110248878082 2017-12-08 22:27:15 UTC <Jillmelissa70> Power outage in Long Beach, CA. Lakewood area. What is going on?
939222613133475840 2017-12-08 19:58:15 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @HuffPostEnt @HuffPostWomen Yes! So happy about this!!!
939049068096929792 2017-12-08 08:28:39 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @TheCreativeC @ChrissyMetz @Vangsness I love it! You get what you give, right?
939020521269628929 2017-12-07 06:35:13 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @HuffPostEnt @Rosie apparently he gets children as well.
939019959677501441 2017-12-07 06:32:59 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @ABC7 Yes, I am sure it will be rough for him. God willing.
939004246288056321 2017-12-07 05:30:32 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @ChloeKohanski @redmarlow @RealPhilProctor I am digging your prediction list for sure! I have a feeling about Keisha Renee, too.
939001887671455745 2017-12-07 05:21:10 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @ChloeKohanski @AddisonAgen I and so many others have enough love and respect for you and everyone on the Voice to override all haters!!
938942056361164801 2017-12-07 01:23:25 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @AC360 the RNC gave 175,000 dollars to support a child molester. This really brings so much into focus for me.
938735348754006016 2017-12-07 11:42:02 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @Alyssa_Milano I am grateful for all the women and men who came forward. I don't feel alone anymore. Everything is so different now. #MeToo
938523292826136576 2017-12-06 21:39:24 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @FINALLEVEL I told you that you were awesome! And police brutality is a HOT topic, finally!
938522656059539456 2017-12-06 21:36:52 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @FINALLEVEL wooooooooo! I am so happy for you. Can't wait! That's the best news in a while!
938306526757965824 2017-12-05 07:18:03 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @NBCTheVoice @keisharenee So happy for you! I wasn't even a bit worried after your performance last night though.
938303931045826560 2017-12-05 07:07:44 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @ava this made my day. Thank you!
938151938985566208 2017-12-05 21:03:46 UTC <Jillmelissa70> I watched the entire show again when I woke up this morning! I never do that. So crazy good!! #TheVoice
937994159805284352 2017-12-05 10:36:49 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @nytimes this works for me.
937942920891580416 2017-12-04 07:13:13 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @redmarlow Just now saw the show on DVR in California. You did it again and I loved it. Congratulations Red!
937940765094772736 2017-12-04 07:04:39 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @brookesimpson @NBCTheVoice I don't know how to put this into words, but WOOOOOOOW. I may never be the same. Thank you Brooke Simpson!
937932689822191617 2017-12-04 06:32:33 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @keisharenee I keep thinking about the Carrie Underwood song --Jesus, Take the Wheel. You could rock that song!
937930010085572608 2017-12-04 06:21:54 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @keisharenee you absolutely inspire me, Keisha Renee! I love you and that performance was Mind Blowing!! You are a STAR. Period.
937926486312468481 2017-12-04 06:07:54 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @ChloeKohanski You ROCKED my world tonight!! That was so BaaaadAsssss!
937922576361205760 2017-12-04 05:52:22 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @NBCTheVoice feels like my head will explode because all the singers are so good this season! And my heart can't take it! Love it though!
937921569019412481 2017-12-04 05:48:22 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @shiannjones I literally started crying after your performance tonight. I feel so proud of you, and you are a real diamond! Outstanding!!
937914575537577984 2017-12-04 05:20:35 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @xtina @DavonFleming @NBCTheVoice Incredible, really! Thank you Davon. You Never disappoint. You deserve to go all the way!
937913375861772289 2017-12-04 05:15:49 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @adam_cunningham Pam Tillis sang that song, during a concert years ago, in Branson, MO. Your performance tonight was unforgettable!!
937911542791643136 2017-12-04 05:08:32 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @PamTillis @adam_cunningham @NBCTheVoice Oh My Goodness!! That was so good, I still have chills! What a knock out performance!!
937806829718867968 2017-12-04 22:12:26 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @redmarlow the boots are perfect! We are looking forward to hearing you sing again tonight! Good luck Red!
937805883043586050 2017-12-04 22:08:40 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @MichaelSkolnik this is a list of the few who came forward.
937532396232048640 2017-12-03 04:01:56 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @TIME The sexual assault and harassment victims that came forward. Period.
936505647880798209 2017-12-01 08:02:00 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @ChloeKohanski @rachel_grace24 That is a brilliant idea!! Please, please record that song.
936455233697284097 2017-11-30 04:41:40 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @SarahKSilverman Yes, usually. If it's not hard or green. Some stinky cheeses are really popular.
935973482470375424 2017-11-29 20:47:22 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @redmarlow "I'm hangin in there like a hair in a biscuit." Congrats Red! You deserve it. I haven't listened to country in many years til you
935739404089470977 2017-11-28 05:17:13 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @MileyCyrus West Coast viewers had to helplessly watch that happen without voting. Janice is my absolute favorite this season. It can't be.
935738336924356608 2017-11-28 05:12:59 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @MileyCyrus I love Adam Cunningham, but, its not fair that people watching the show in California can't vote because of the time difference.
935439816904159232 2017-11-28 09:26:46 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @IAMJHUD @DavonFleming @NBCTheVoice I just now saw your performance on DVR. Incredible! You can absolutely win this show. For real!!
934536527048093696 2017-11-25 21:37:25 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @TIME I hope the winner is "The Sexual Assault Victim that Came Forward." They may have been in the news more than anyone else.
934349159800348673 2017-11-25 09:12:53 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @ChloeKohanski I know we will love it! You are so awesome and I hope you win!
933858821587341312 2017-11-23 00:44:27 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @glamourmag @TraceeEllisRoss @msfoundation I actually got so emotional reading this. Thank you Tracee Ellis Ross! I am listening, I hear you
932510900484898816 2017-11-19 07:28:18 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @kyrasedgwick @kathy120 yes! I can't wait to see it. The last episode left us hanging.
932133429654667264 2017-11-18 06:28:22 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @dateline_keith the story about the parents personalities being over the top was intriguing, but, I still don't believe "the boys."
932131556952379392 2017-11-18 06:20:56 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @SarahKSilverman @jimstinson @IngrahamAngle Umm. What? Plenty of people adore her and she is quite funny.
930903466137985024 2017-11-15 21:00:56 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @IAMJHUD Thank you Jennifer Hudson for being the most inspirational person in a long time.
930895653529460736 2017-11-15 20:29:53 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @FINALLEVEL @badgrammer yes, but still as Adorable as ever!
929793605635473408 2017-11-12 19:30:44 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @KevinHart4real I should have bought one of those long ago...
929616300866879488 2017-11-11 07:46:12 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @realDonaldTrump @KimEGoldman pleeeeaase tell me it is a spoof. Please.
924135815491358720 2017-10-27 04:48:42 UTC <Jillmelissa70> I vote Woody Harrelson for President in 2020! Who's with me?
917897925199413248 2017-10-10 23:41:33 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @ItsRamiMalek Finally!! I can't wait another second. Thank you for being in this incredible show!
915350559313477632 2017-10-03 22:59:14 UTC <Jillmelissa70> https://youtu.be/n4nPa35CZPI Tom Petty-Here Comes my Girl. I could not get through this video without crying. Seems so unfair right now.
915006848985468928 2017-10-02 00:13:27 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @paulocoelho does that include teachers??
913258860655165440 2017-09-27 04:27:34 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @FINALLEVEL @bullmastiffdog I still get butterflies every time I see you on the show. And I have seen them all!
913256368726982656 2017-09-27 04:17:40 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @FINALLEVEL finally! My Wednesday night is back!
913255752365510656 2017-09-27 04:15:13 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @SarahKSilverman they might be ok? Ha
891206578669367296 2017-07-29 07:59:40 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @chrisrock just you please!
874824752145113089 2017-06-13 03:04:09 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @APEntertainment I am confused about why some do not think it is important for people to know what this nut case has been saying.
874033385265537024 2017-06-11 22:39:32 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @thatguydom I would like that. Have you tried hypnosis yet? I started yesterday.
874031352445677568 2017-06-11 22:31:27 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @allencarr thank you Allen. I want to succeed at being a non-smoker. I have your audio book.
873983427191513088 2017-06-11 19:21:01 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @thatguydom me too.
873982951557439488 2017-06-11 19:19:08 UTC <Jillmelissa70> I started hypnotherapy sessions yesterday. I've smoked a cigarette twice since then. Ordinarily I would have smoked 10 by now. I must quit.
873979130055974912 2017-06-11 19:03:57 UTC <Jillmelissa70> I am sorry that happened. That person has many more serious issues besides smoking. Next time say "that cigarette stinks."
872999596393242624 2017-06-08 02:11:37 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @KamalaHarris @Vets_Vs_Trump Or when my boss says "I hope you will mop the floors today." Focusing on the word "hope" implies that people are too stupid to get it.
872241294646493184 2017-06-06 23:58:24 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @Grubhub_Care thank you. I just sent the order numbers.
871959315401236480 2017-06-05 05:17:55 UTC <Jillmelissa70> Doordash is much more generous and courteous.

834639696512704513 2017-02-22 05:43:05 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @nytimes @vincentdonofrio I don't understand how this kind of a person became our president. It's so...demoralizing. Thanks for the article.

833049734335995904 2017-02-18 20:25:08 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @vincentdonofrio @RuthieHancock14 Do you all remember when Tom Cruise got in to it with Brooke Shields? Over medication for depression. Odd.
831774183247994881 2017-02-14 07:56:33 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @vincentdonofrio Thanks, I needed that. You are one of the coolest people on twitter. Happy Valentines Day.

830310379762835456 2017-02-10 06:59:55 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @HowToGetAwayABC Please just tell me now and put me out of my anxiety ridden misery: Is Wes alive??
830309428280782848 2017-02-10 06:56:08 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @chrislhayes We are talking about the same person who still said Obama was not born in the US years after proof was widespread. Nut Case.
829993664361361408 2017-02-10 10:01:24 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @OCWeekly @GustavoArellano oh my goodness.
829860243513372672 2017-02-09 01:11:14 UTC <Jillmelissa70> I was literally starving for some justice. But we need much more. 3-0
829611815252275200 2017-02-09 08:44:04 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @thelisavidal I just feel better when Kara and Mary Jane are both happy.
829576053572018176 2017-02-08 06:21:58 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @TheJusticeDept @SenWarren I am sure he has learned well over the years how to hide his racism
829574872783204354 2017-02-08 06:17:17 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @FINALLEVEL After 80 hours of homework in ten days, I will reward myself by watching it on DVR now!

829211568726536192 2017-02-07 06:13:38 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @thelisavidal I keep forgetting to not look at twitter until after I watch the show in California. Haha
829210782256812034 2017-02-07 06:10:31 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @SenateMajLdr @SenWarren Now everyone will want to read that letter. Silver lining?
828844598575239168 2017-02-06 05:55:26 UTC <Jillmelissa70> The people can sleep tight tonight. Our representatives will be up all night. Tomorrow we see if the Constitution prevails? Or reality tv?
828344552649957376 2017-02-05 20:48:25 UTC <Jillmelissa70> This Devos commercial on TV....grizzly.
828342585605238784 2017-02-05 20:40:36 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @ABC @GStephanopoulos Pence is wrong about people being "accustomed to" trumps language. Only people who think just like he are 'accustomed'
828163627936935936 2017-02-05 08:49:30 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @ElyssaK @UniteWomenOrg Agree 100 percent. I don't know why it worked? But it did.
828163214114381824 2017-02-05 08:47:51 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @nytimes I don't know why it worked? But it did.
828128408223641600 2017-02-04 06:29:33 UTC <Jillmelissa70> Time to watch SNL on the west coast. Perfect ending to a long and productive day. Goodnight to my new twitter family. Thank you Indivisible!

828124338733789184 2017-02-04 06:13:22 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @NickHanauer Yep. I am reading this everywhere today! Perfect name but I guess we have to give him credit for the trademark..oh well.
828123356402577412 2017-02-04 06:09:28 UTC <Jillmelissa70> These so called professors are giving me way too much homework! I plan to file some kind of complaint. Lol
828122618561646592 2017-02-04 06:06:32 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @MMFlint Definitely nailed it. "So called president trump." I hope it's trending by now because that's his name for less than 4 years.
828006768852676608 2017-02-04 22:26:11 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @CNN @smerconish we promised Chelsea we would all work on our spelling in the future.

827729813297258496 2017-02-03 04:05:40 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @growmymlmtoday this is exactly what I needed to read today.
827317160544309248 2017-02-02 00:45:56 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @ChrisMurphyCT @hardball and yet trump makes it all seem so simple.

826947879667322880 2017-02-01 00:18:33 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @allencarr @sparkysaintsean congrats on such an incredible accomplishment. I hope to join you soon.

826946434314366976 2017-02-01 00:12:48 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @RepMarkTakano Agreed. Exactly the same.
826945703272341504 2017-02-01 00:09:54 UTC <Jillmelissa70> Thank you for explaining this in very plain terms.https://twitter.com/MMFlint/status/826763192869199872
826665849054339072 2017-01-31 05:37:51 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @SarahKSilverman I can actually hear you saying that in my head.
826664084984647681 2017-01-31 05:30:51 UTC <Jillmelissa70> So cool.https://twitter.com/vincentdonofrio/status/826656812346769409

826302601381634049 2017-01-30 05:34:26 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @thelisavidal Thank God for your show, I really need something awesome to temporarily take my mind away from the insanity rising.
826294854585978880 2017-01-30 05:03:39 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @chrislhayes Even if he did, it would not be sincere. I won't hold my breath waiting. He is nothing like Obama, or decent human beings.
826286167200894976 2017-01-30 04:29:08 UTC <Jillmelissa70> I am not trying to be mean for real, but why do so many trump supporters not know how to spell even simple words??
826279709621182464 2017-01-30 04:03:28 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @SallyQYates There are no words to describe the gratitude and admiration felt by people for your bravery. Thank you for standing up.

825631016492552193 2017-01-29 09:05:48 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @iamrachael88 @sassylibrarian1 yes he should be ashamed. But I wonder if he is even capable of such a thing. I believe he will be stopped.

821725344012959747 2017-01-18 14:26:03 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @CharlesMBlow @noah_bean definitely a good start.
821569115068329984 2017-01-17 04:05:15 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @nytimes at least until three days from now.
821469890615746560 2017-01-17 21:30:58 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @FINALLEVEL Yes. Yes. And yes. Everything changed for the good once I adopted this state of mind. Not overnight tho. Patience is a virtue.
821467903119634432 2017-01-17 21:23:04 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @FINALLEVEL @RuffleButts @BabyChanelworld This picture needs to be framed. So adorable. Outfit is perfect.

821214325742284800 2017-01-16 04:35:27 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @vincentdonofrio No way in hell. And you look so sexy too. Who could stay mad at you? Impossible
821130965992947712 2017-01-16 23:04:12 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @YouTube @FINALLEVEL same as you, earth.
821127661938294784 2017-01-16 22:51:05 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @vincentdonofrio so true. I got really upset one time on twitter. I called someone a bad name. Not cool. I'm so sorry about it now.
821124532064776192 2017-01-16 22:38:38 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @ConanOBrien I just found my favorite tweet of the day. Thanks. Where do we make donations?
820902058257616897 2017-01-15 07:54:36 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @SarahKSilverman @reneauberjonois I've never tried it but I've heard people rave about them. It might work. Good luck.
820797189748236288 2017-01-15 00:57:54 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @fusion @JoyAnnReid I pray for more powerful people to stay on this. DT will insult enough of the RIGHT people eventually, then be impeached

820461785694146561 2017-01-14 02:45:07 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @nytimes I doubt anyone would hate the performer. Its more like how could anyone want to embarrass themselves by association.

820399195471290368 2017-01-14 22:36:25 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @nytimes As if trump could get more repulsive? Are we going to get used to this?
820398435094278144 2017-01-14 22:33:23 UTC <Jillmelissa70> So ready to see this movie. Loved seeing you and Danny on the talk. Can't wait!

818939492870389760 2017-01-10 21:56:04 UTC <Jillmelissa70> @Travistritt are you saying that most people are so small-minded that they should only be interested in one thing? Come on.
