964595060259020800 2018-02-16 20:19:18 UTC <sparkletherobot> Youre right to bear arms? The only reason for this was so the public could defend themselves against the government - this isnt relevant anymore as the army is bigger than all private militaries combined. LIVES BEFORE OUTDATED LAWS  #StudentsForRegulation
964594141861527552 2018-02-16 20:15:39 UTC <sparkletherobot> Where are the pro life republicans now? Suddenly their want for guns outweighs LIVES  #StudentsForRegulation
964593736624689152 2018-02-16 20:14:02 UTC <sparkletherobot> My young cousins live in America and it couldve been them. DO SOMETHING  #StudentsForRegulation
963502053489192960 2018-02-13 19:56:05 UTC <sparkletherobot> @ethankurz @rebeccahanover Although in high school games this probably applies
963501952347684865 2018-02-13 19:55:41 UTC <sparkletherobot> @ethankurz @rebeccahanover Actually in bigger games (like international games and the World Cup) the snitch just ends the game, if the other team has a lead that outweighs the amount of points the snitch gives, then catching the snitch is a bad idea because it ends the game with them losing.

955752414912512001 2018-01-23 10:41:47 UTC <sparkletherobot> @AllisonRaskin @JBUshow Im so happy someone did random twisted things as a child too. No offence. Kids are weird.
954288042923061248 2018-01-19 09:42:53 UTC <sparkletherobot> @HayleyKiyoko Doesnt queer also mean strange or odd? That is part of the definition. Im not agreeing with him or disagreeing with you, Im just confused.
953523647464931328 2018-01-16 07:05:27 UTC <sparkletherobot> Thank you! I find that surrounding myself with people who will take the time to understand what helps me is the best. It's wonderful that you're working together to help each other.
953521818446409728 2018-01-16 06:58:11 UTC <sparkletherobot> This is so important, I often feel like I can't talk about these parts of my anxiety and my depression. I get sensory overloads a lot and it's hard to explain to my sister that I wish she wasn't breathing so close to me because no one takes that part of mental illness seriously.
953520197549244416 2018-01-16 06:51:45 UTC <sparkletherobot> @feminismvibes @ashiinu Did it! I think this is great!

947932668011753472 2018-01-01 20:48:54 UTC <sparkletherobot> @AllisonRaskin I played this aloud from my phone in a tiny ass caravan with my judgemental sister. 10/10 recommend this video.
947917834151018496 2018-01-01 19:49:57 UTC <sparkletherobot> @EverydaySexism @Sam_Whitehouse I can only say that Im aiming to be an environment scientist. I feel like Ive wasted time since I wasnt informedI could be a romantic heroine.

932790484749115392 2017-11-20 01:59:16 UTC <sparkletherobot> @AllisonRaskin You actual beautiful person! Omg you look so goooddd!
931703497472409601 2017-11-17 01:59:58 UTC <sparkletherobot> HER body. HER sexuality. HER rules. https://twitter.com/kthopkins/status/931064674581442560
931702922588459008 2017-11-17 01:57:41 UTC <sparkletherobot> @KTHopkins This is fucking stupid. Women being objectified by men is completely different to a woman taking control of her own sexuality and body. How? It's HER body.
930149502903713792 2017-11-13 19:04:57 UTC <sparkletherobot> @gabydunn @AllisonRaskin This was really really interesting and impactful on me. I regret that I never thought this far into it - and people wonder why women don't come forward.
929982755307323392 2017-11-13 08:02:21 UTC <sparkletherobot> @feminismvibes @jennyyangtv Bless all the offended white dudes replying to this. So fucking funny 
929981752407310336 2017-11-12 07:58:22 UTC <sparkletherobot> @Rosgakori In what world do we dress - what is supposed to represent - female warriors like that?
929981057750900736 2017-11-12 07:55:37 UTC <sparkletherobot> @Rosgakori This fucking sucks. I'm not going to see this movie.
924896242458443776 2017-10-30 07:10:22 UTC <sparkletherobot> @gabydunn It's so beautiful. I love the end where he hides the bottle - showing he hasn't completely changed, that theres still good and bad.
916544075091681280 2017-10-06 06:01:50 UTC <sparkletherobot> @gabydunn How many is too many?
915674642240516096 2017-10-04 20:27:01 UTC <sparkletherobot> Pt 3. It had a really good plot and satisfying ending, but it didn't feel like fiction, I got sucked into it. @gabydunn @AllisonRaskin
915674199238230016 2017-10-04 20:25:16 UTC <sparkletherobot> Pt. 2 The ending felt open ended, so the story doesn't feel completely over and I am still apart of their lives. @gabydunn @AllisonRaskin
915673900792537088 2017-10-04 20:24:05 UTC <sparkletherobot> I finished #ihateeveryonebutyou I love how it feels like a section of these girls lives, that's been plucked. @gabydunn @AllisonRaskinpic.twitter.com/oZzFNFtI3D
