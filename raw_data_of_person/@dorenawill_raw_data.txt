951891042063798272 2018-01-12 18:58:04 UTC <dorenawill> @YouTube Parents/adults who influence children, consider that MLK was a loving father who had 2 painfully discuss racism w/ his 6 yr old. Listen 2 this 4 min clip w/ your children. Learn together & move toward hope & action. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBTSW0ulOps&sns=tw via @youtube
951461358578622464 2018-01-11 14:30:39 UTC <dorenawill> Listening to @gdk_chris encourage a young black preacher who reached out for wisdom as he prepares to speak to a majority white audience about reconciliation. So grateful that the wisdom and work of 22 years leading a multiracial church can be beneficial beyond us!

950150441047875584 2018-01-07 23:41:32 UTC <dorenawill> And our main character was a hero we can read right over -Obadiah! (I Kings 18) He hid 100 prophets during Jezebel & Ahab's crazy reign. The takeaway was 4 us 2 risk hiding (and loving) bc love trumps law every time! 2)
950147372423811072 2018-01-07 23:29:21 UTC <dorenawill> "When heroes hide people" was a brilliant sermon today by my hubs @gdk_chris. God sanctioned hiding- Rahab hiding the spies; Moses being hidden by his mom Jochebed; Egypt was the destination for Jesus' fam to hide him. Paul had to be hidden in a basket after preaching. 1)

945382412875427840 2017-12-25 19:55:06 UTC <dorenawill> "So fitting that the news of the lamb of God's birth would come to shepherds. And that the reception would be hosted in a stable. A place where the look of their clothes and the smell of their flocks blended in, where out-of-place people would feel most welcome." -Ken Gire
945134377192783873 2017-12-24 03:29:29 UTC <dorenawill> My four kids love #homealone but at ages 14,17,21&24 they're still shocked at how Kevin talked to his mom!

941285048413716480 2017-12-14 12:33:38 UTC <dorenawill> This right here should be a no brainer; sadly, so many have been influenced to think that abortion is the defining pro-life issue. So thankful God continues to transform our minds and hearts to advance His ways, not just one party or one ideology!https://twitter.com/natepyle79/status/941126703929266176

940073442040209410 2017-12-10 04:19:08 UTC <dorenawill> This precious kid. His empathy has resonated with the masses, including celebrities who are lining up to encourage and bless him!
