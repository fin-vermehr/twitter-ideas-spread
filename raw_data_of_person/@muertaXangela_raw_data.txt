970358624995377152 2018-03-04 18:01:39 UTC <muertaXangela> @NyleDiMarco Hi, if you're seeing this tweet and thinking "that sounds like me! Is this really a thing? Is there anything I can do to get help with this IRL?": Talk to your doctor about seeing an audiologist who can test for auditory processing disorder.https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/auditory-processing-disorder/
970341816959725569 2018-03-04 16:54:51 UTC <muertaXangela> @TheStuffOfMemes It's my pet "you're not just wrong, you're stupid" linguistic history lesson. Also, if they want a "pure" and unchanging language then they're welcome to speak a dead one, pref as a native.
970341320073019398 2018-03-04 16:52:53 UTC <muertaXangela> @TheStuffOfMemes Saying the singular they is grammatically incorrect is like being a Freudian: it's been debunked for a while but people still teach it like it's scripture.
970340527500660737 2018-03-04 16:49:44 UTC <muertaXangela> @TheStuffOfMemes If this is about the singular they: it predates Modern English. Chaucer used it in Canterbury Tales which is Middle English. Shakespeare, Austen, Shaw, Swift, Fielding, Byron, and a host of other "important writers" used it. It's in the King James Bible.
970332050795454465 2018-03-04 16:16:03 UTC <muertaXangela> @NyleDiMarco @matokah @ashleymomara Ask to see an audiologist who can test specifically for things like auditory processing disorder - classic hearing tests won't cut it but more comprehensive tests for other hearing disorders exist.  https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/auditory-processing-disorder/

970194589352189952 2018-03-03 07:09:50 UTC <muertaXangela> @whirlingnerdish No problem. ^_^ I'm glad to help.
970194136027553792 2018-03-03 07:08:02 UTC <muertaXangela> I sometimes accidentally teach people that they aren't weird/stupid, they have a form of hearing disorder. So: Hearing comprehension issues are A Thing & basically mean you hear the noise but there's a lag when your brain tries to interpret it. (Source: my deaf mum's audiologist)
970190990475710465 2018-03-03 06:55:32 UTC <muertaXangela> @whirlingnerdish Filtering issues are also common among people with deafness/hearing disorders (as well as neuroatypicals). My mum started going deaf at age 3 so hearing comprehension & filtering never developed, & hearing aids amplify EVERYTHING so she gets overwhelmed easily when wearing them.
970187989069549568 2018-03-03 06:43:36 UTC <muertaXangela> @whirlingnerdish I only know about it because my mother's audiologist was talking about the different types of deafness/hearing disorders. I suspect it's actually fairly common but not known about outside of circles where deafness/hearing disorders are already being discussed.
970147484365414400 2018-03-03 04:02:39 UTC <muertaXangela> @RahulKohli13 My stepdad works in Reading during the week & comes home at the weekends to my mum in Devon. She keeps telling me how much she misses him. My partners are in New Jersey. I also live in Devon. I haven't seen them since Jan 2017.  I love my mum but she needs to STFU sometimes.
970110695776899072 2018-03-03 01:36:28 UTC <muertaXangela> @NyleDiMarco In addition to classic deafness/hearing problems, hearing comprehension issues can be a thing: you hear it, but there's a lag when your brain interprets the noises into words. Also, music/sfx too loud & speech too quiet is a common problem. Subtitles help all of these.

Never mind that education, time, spoons, access, dyslexia are just a few of the many factors to consider.
967482296499662848 2018-02-24 19:32:09 UTC <muertaXangela> @ToweringProle A lot of people actively shun ideologies because they are dismissed/patronised for not having read enough or experienced enough. It is perfectly valid for them to make reductive jokes in response.
967481122081988609 2018-02-24 19:27:29 UTC <muertaXangela> @ToweringProle The problem is: shit is dense & not easily accessible to all. Also ideology doesn't work for everyone. Some thrive on a framework, others Do Not. And there's So Much elitism in certain circles esp dismissing people who've not read/encountered things. Sharing & kindness IS Enough.
967479152835166208 2018-02-24 19:19:39 UTC <muertaXangela> Me: I told [nibling] "the doggy goes woof woof woof" & she giggles every time? Apparently saying woof is hilarious? Stepdad: *relays to mum but says I said donkey* Mum: Wait, what? Doggy or donkey? Me: Doggy! Why would a donkey say woof?! Is it bilingual?!
967387236982513664 2018-02-24 13:14:25 UTC <muertaXangela> @bae_warden Allocishet men: A female lead?! What a chick flick! No thanks, can't relate!  Also allocishet men: Why do you care about gender so much? lol
967386017308213254 2018-02-24 13:09:34 UTC <muertaXangela> Every time one symptom dies down, it is immediately replaced by another. Of course, this doesn't mean they're taking turns, that would imply I'm only having to deal with one thing at a time.
967384425410547712 2018-02-24 13:03:14 UTC <muertaXangela> @bae_warden Changing a few genders doesn't have to change the plot At All or the script beyond names & pronouns, but it makes a HUGE change for people who tend to only see people like them in the media as victims of abuse/violence/murder. (Related: the Bury Your Gays trope needs to die.)
967380859073445889 2018-02-24 12:49:04 UTC <muertaXangela> @bae_warden Translation: "I'm an allocishet who probably thinks that's a slur because I'd rather just say I'm normal lmao - I think queer people have no value and I've never used the internet before"

967305996526899200 2018-02-23 07:51:35 UTC <muertaXangela> @percahlia Before I even came out as enby a friend started calling me Jeffiner. Also it's weird how sometimes other people (esp queers) subconsciously recognise your queerness before you do (bonus points if they also haven't recognised their own queerness at the time).

964510039468904449 2018-02-16 14:41:27 UTC <muertaXangela> "THIS IS A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE" No. It's not. Even if it was, you don't give a fuck about mental health. You don't give a fuck about the kids being traumatised or killed. You give a fuck about your guns & how powerful they make you feel. You don't give a fuck about the powerless.
964508065197420544 2018-02-16 14:33:37 UTC <muertaXangela> "THIS IS A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE!" Okay so wow, I guess lots of mentally ill people are committing acts of extreme violence? It happens several times a week? Maybe additional mental health support...? No? Cut funding & allow insurers to deny it under pre-existing conditions? Sure.
964506856520634368 2018-02-16 14:28:48 UTC <muertaXangela> "THIS IS A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE!" If only there were some kind of CHECK that could be done before allowing purchase of a firearm to see if there's a history of mental illness in their BACKGROUND...

963862863059308545 2018-02-14 19:49:48 UTC <muertaXangela> @LaSouvarine Rediscovering who you are after an abusive relationship is So Important. And when the You who comes out the other side is different from the You you were before, getting to know that person is Vital.

963860534717308928 2018-02-14 19:40:33 UTC <muertaXangela> @WasabiFlux Because giving you shit about something you have no control over automatically magically gives you control over the situation, obvs(!)

963844204869902336 2018-02-14 18:35:40 UTC <muertaXangela> LDR polyamory is being happy for your partner(s) making plans with other people, but sad for yourself not being one of them... and also just being alone.
963841153308221441 2018-02-14 18:23:32 UTC <muertaXangela> @jephjacques Yeah but you probably don't have the prints from your baby fingers on file? I hope your wisdom fingers came through okay by now and you didn't need to have them removed.
963839651504148481 2018-02-14 18:17:34 UTC <muertaXangela> @RogerCraigSmith Possible translation?: We want people so desperate for a part they'll thank us for the opportunity to be treated like shit, not people who already know their ability and worth?

963816198688436224 2018-02-14 16:44:23 UTC <muertaXangela> @SER1897 I'd rather give the benefit of the doubt than assume someone's rude. I'd hope people would be understanding & patient w/ me, my fellow neuroatypicals, & my HoH mum. It's not that we aren't trying to engage, it's just that there is A Lot & sometimes we need you to repeat yourself.
963814517372260352 2018-02-14 16:37:42 UTC <muertaXangela> @SER1897 The problem is that there are people with hearing problems, auditory processing issues, attention deficit disorders, and a variety of conditions that make overstimulation and difficulty focusing A Thing. And most times you can't tell by looking.

963807121048592385 2018-02-14 16:08:18 UTC <muertaXangela> @stavvers Goose and duck are hella fatty so obvs you should eat waterfowl before rabbit so you can collect & store the fat.
963806257672015872 2018-02-14 16:04:53 UTC <muertaXangela> @stavvers My issues with offal are based off bad experiences but I don't think it's inherently gross for people to eat it, those things are just Not For Me. Also JFC people wash kidneys better. 
963805212610789382 2018-02-14 16:00:43 UTC <muertaXangela> @stavvers If that specific animal was a pet, I think eating it is weird? But that's not species dependent? Also if you're gonna eat rabbit, make sure you have plenty of veggies too.
963803388231208960 2018-02-14 15:53:29 UTC <muertaXangela> @bae_warden It's a nice dress, but the best thing about it is that it's being worn by a babe. 
963800353035649024 2018-02-14 15:41:25 UTC <muertaXangela> @LaSouvarine I empathise. Mine's only mental illness & I've been suuuper lucky, but every time it's terrifying & exhausting & makes me sicker. Love to you & yours.  One can only hope that ATOS, the Job Centre, & the DWP will be among the first against the wall when the revolution comes.
963798901538066433 2018-02-14 15:35:39 UTC <muertaXangela> @LaSouvarine ATOS: because strangers with checklists know more about your health than the doctors and specialists who've spent years treating you.

963592733024768000 2018-02-13 01:56:24 UTC <muertaXangela> @Cosmos_Cookie I have many US friends and when they give me shit for my pronunciations I either slip into an accent they can't follow (go-to is Scouse as I was born in Liverpool) or go full RP and horribly mangle slang and contractions.

962632232107114497 2018-02-11 10:19:43 UTC <muertaXangela> @ToxicityVixen I'm a huge nerd for all things lore and fae, and I've created a bunch of new ones for my fantasy world as well as twists and older incarnations of the more classically established ones.
962553979434651649 2018-02-10 05:08:46 UTC <muertaXangela> Lawful Good gender neutral asexual goliath lifespirit warden. Strictly follows the rules of their clan/path, dismissive of rules/conventions that seem counter to these. A Softie, blushes easily at positive attention, no concept of innuendo, fond of animals, A+ babysitter.
962539229648752645 2018-02-10 04:10:10 UTC <muertaXangela> Chaotic good female air genasi bard and acrobat. Highest stats are dex and charisma. Lowest are strength and wisdom. Haughty, flighty, full of herself, brash, with enough charm to be a cult leader if she had the patience for the long game.
962535356284497921 2018-02-10 03:54:46 UTC <muertaXangela> I'm pretty roguey, pretty stabby, pretty spoopy, kinda clericy and I teeeend to play characters that are aspects of me exaggerated. So I'm going to try to come up with a bunch of characters that aren't...

962504686157946880 2018-02-10 01:52:54 UTC <muertaXangela> I LOVE the fae. I have zero trust for those slippery fucks, but they are endlessly fascinating. Fun little horrorshows.  Ugh, why do I have to write narrative? Why can't I just make a bestiary of all the weird types of fae and creatures in my world?
961851463231184896 2018-02-08 06:37:13 UTC <muertaXangela> I'm barely holding myself together but there are people I have to support & now I have a fucking dog & my house is entirely unsuitable for sharing with anyone even possibly especially an animal & gods I just want it all to stop I just want to die & I hate them for not letting me.
961849324530319360 2018-02-08 06:28:43 UTC <muertaXangela> I literally told her that I've been having to ignore my needs and boundaries because crisis after crisis has been hitting my friends and loved ones but each time I have fewer resources and have been spent and struggling for months. But I guess that's just me not doing enough?
961848593786155008 2018-02-08 06:25:49 UTC <muertaXangela> Mum: It seems like every time something happens to someone, you get sick, and that's not how life is supposed to work.  Golly, it's almost like I have mental disorders or something?!
961847591561437185 2018-02-08 06:21:50 UTC <muertaXangela> Mum: I've suffered with my mental illness my whole life and it wasn't until I literally started ignoring it that I was able to move past it. Me: It's great that worked for you but it only makes me more sick.
961843744323416064 2018-02-08 06:06:33 UTC <muertaXangela> Yes, this will definitely help with the desire to die, thanks (!)

961633628034883585 2018-02-08 16:11:37 UTC <muertaXangela> So, uh... I guess I'm spending a lot of today trying not to cry?
961608204257054720 2018-02-08 14:30:36 UTC <muertaXangela> Nott, a Goblin, is used to abuse. Caleb, a Cat Dad, loves & protects his new daughter. Nott, terribly afraid for her Squishy Wizard, holds him back & tells him it's not worth it when someone is mean to her. Caleb, now having backup, sends Frumpkin to fetch Jester... #CriticalRole
961593839294320640 2018-02-08 13:33:31 UTC <muertaXangela> That whole thing was for the dumb joke at the end. It's still my headcanon and has been since the feywild, but the last line of that tweet just popped into my head and I amused myself waaaay too much with it.

Family gives you both the space and support you need to grow. There's a lot of talk about "familial bonds" but, while it can be sticky, blood makes terrible glue*.

Yes, it can hurt, but it also gives us and those around us a greater capacity for growth and chance of success. It is genuinely part of why we were able to become such a dominant species and didn't just die out.

Gonna get him so agility trained, he'll be my little champ buddy.  (IDC if he wins anything, I just think he'd have So Much Fun with agility)https://twitter.com/yge_ao01/status/956797845528395776
957296836955357185 2018-01-27 16:58:46 UTC <muertaXangela> @TheStuffOfMemes You're probably nowhere near me but if you were - and you liked shibas, shelties, and old collies - I would definitely invite you to come hang out when I walk and/or dogsit my sister's pack of 8 (inc the shibe I'll be getting from her next month).
957291371626364929 2018-01-27 16:37:03 UTC <muertaXangela> @orbette Understandably.

On a subject that affects me and mamy of my friends and loved ones personally. I don't have the luxury of treating any of this as academic/theoretical, so yeah, it is an emotionally charged subject for me.
957289232745328641 2018-01-27 16:28:33 UTC <muertaXangela> @orbette You're amazing. I know none of that could have been easy. I hope there isn't backlash for you, but if there is it 100% is Not Your Fault. You did gr8000 (1000 more than gr8).
957286422041518082 2018-01-27 16:17:23 UTC <muertaXangela> @billy_b0nes I make all the obvious jokes about being a white person over it, but I have genuinely eaten mayonnaise sandwiches because I've been poor AF. At least crisp butties have texture.
957070089316175872 2018-01-26 01:57:45 UTC <muertaXangela> I know I've said this before but @VoiceOfOBrien's outfit in this season's #CriticalRole trailer looks like he's trying to cosplay #RupertTheBear and I kinda can't get over it?

957008819284008966 2018-01-26 21:54:17 UTC <muertaXangela> @KimmyMonte S/O to that guy for giving me issues about my performance in bed even 10 years later.
957008549686792192 2018-01-26 21:53:13 UTC <muertaXangela> @KimmyMonte Dated a guy for a while. I had "a reputation" & was repeatedly told "he's a good guy, don't hurt him". We finally had sex. Then he ghosted me, despite the fact that I literally worked where he lived. After a few weeks I texted "do you want to break up?" He replied "yeh sorry"

956677348665057280 2018-01-25 23:57:08 UTC <muertaXangela> @Fullmetal_Popo @TrinAndTonic @Pauljvergouwe It never was! The singular they has been used in English since before it was English that most people recognise! Not only did Shakespeare use the singular they, Chaucer was using it in Middle English!
956655981370494976 2018-01-25 22:32:14 UTC <muertaXangela> @ESTBLSHMNT Fun fact: not only did Shakespeare use the singular they, Chaucer did. The singular they has been used in English since before it was English that most people recognise. It's not grammatically incorrect, you just want an excuse not to respect nonbinaries.

The UK gets 6 weeks. I didn't realise how ripped off I was until babysitting for a friend while in the US. I ranted a lot to that poor, confused 1 year old.

I used to play with him at least once a day though (fetch, red dot, cat fishers...)
955824202887593985 2018-01-23 15:27:02 UTC <muertaXangela> @ToweringProle Proud of you.  From one who understands how hard it can be.

954028809006845953 2018-01-18 16:32:47 UTC <muertaXangela> Aushirmiri's lowest stat is CON. She has a high pain threshold because Reasons, but is still very squishy. Despite this she chooses to wear mostly revealing clothes to make best use of high CHA & DEX. She also has a physical disability that affects her mobility and communication.https://twitter.com/dungeoncrawl22/status/953794155641221120
954026929404997634 2018-01-18 16:25:19 UTC <muertaXangela> Sen's lowest stat is CHA. She is actual monster-kin. Because she has to disguise herself constantly or be killed on sight, she shuns people both for safety reasons & because she considers all interactions in her glamoured state to be inherently dishonest.https://twitter.com/dungeoncrawl22/status/953794155641221120

954005644687880192 2018-01-18 15:00:44 UTC <muertaXangela> @Nicole_Cliffe Also (pre-Christian demonising) Norse Loki is The Best Loki. No actual evil or malice, just "lol wouldn't it be funny if...? [Time passes] ... I hecked up, I hecked up so bad" or the other gods being like "shitshitshit we hecked up! Loki! Fix the situation that we 100% caused!"
954004579766734849 2018-01-18 14:56:31 UTC <muertaXangela> @Nicole_Cliffe I like Loki as a character? Mental illness/trauma & queer coding make me  but he is NOT a good person? He's like that one kid who is so charming and engaging 1-to-1 but if you take your eyes off him you know something is going to be on fire - except an Adult so it's worrrrrse.

It's also important to recognise that many don't realise how much they need it sometimes until they're given the space to be.

953728580235743236 2018-01-17 20:39:47 UTC <muertaXangela> @TheStuffOfMemes I was lucky to recognise safe vs predators in kink spaces early because my mum's a former pro Domme. But the amount of partners I've had in their mid 20s+ break down because they'd not had needs recognised before is not small. As a society we must educate & protect people better.
953723628117479424 2018-01-17 20:20:06 UTC <muertaXangela> @TheStuffOfMemes Goodness, I'm so pleased for you! I wish the importance of aftercare was more widely known, but I'm very glad you weren't preyed upon in that way (esp while still learning).

953710757555916800 2018-01-17 19:28:58 UTC <muertaXangela> @TidalHeartbeat I haven't sent you any ridiculous make up fae being selfies today, so that's not it.
953708279183618048 2018-01-17 19:19:07 UTC <muertaXangela> @TidalHeartbeat I'm glad you feel that way, my love.  I know how shitty it is to be coerced, have boundaries crossed, have No and No-Signalling ignored, and to be stuck unresponsive and having trauma flashbacks while your partner doesn't notice. I don't ever want to make anyone feel that way.
953706822032031746 2018-01-17 19:13:20 UTC <muertaXangela> However, I don't just rely on verbal cues. If I am being the more dominant/active partner, I always try to be aware of body language & engagement levels. If I suspect a partner isn't having a good time but can't discuss it for whatever reason, I transition to cuddles/aftercare.
953705580522364928 2018-01-17 19:08:24 UTC <muertaXangela> Also, I make it very clear in both kink and vanilla situations that my partners should never worry about using safewords/asking me to stop; I will always respect it, they will never be punished for it, & I would be vastly more upset if I found out that they wanted to but didn't.
953691951014010880 2018-01-17 18:14:14 UTC <muertaXangela> I want fajitas but I don't have tortillas... I do have pasta though, and pasta bakes are one of my fave low spoon foods... Chicken fajita pasta bake?

953172758304886785 2018-01-15 07:51:09 UTC <muertaXangela> A good fake-cheese is hard to find and once you have one you cling to it forever (or until they discontinue it in your area, the bastards).

953034134246559744 2018-01-15 22:40:18 UTC <muertaXangela> Sometimes when I wear make up, I feel like one of those trans birds that adorns itself with ridiculously ostentatious decorations to enhance its plumage and steal all the lady birds?

953031427192426497 2018-01-15 22:29:33 UTC <muertaXangela> But make up was always presented to me as a thing for making you look pretty! It wasn't until a few years ago that I realised it could also be art or for making you feel/look powerful! So I'll be 30 this year and I'm only just learning about make up.

952969789840019456 2018-01-15 18:24:37 UTC <muertaXangela> I feel incredibly sick again so have slept the day away instead of doing anything I had planned to, and now I'm dealing with sickness AND overwhelming shame. Guess I'm just going to lie here and cry and feel like a piece of shit for the rest of the night.
952969028766662656 2018-01-15 18:21:36 UTC <muertaXangela> (I moved 300 miles at age 9 from a Catholic school in Liverpool to a relatively secular school in a Devon village - totally different environment, totally different people, totally different teaching priorities. In those classes in particular, I felt. Hella. Fucking. Isolated.)
952967327150198784 2018-01-15 18:14:50 UTC <muertaXangela> I'm grateful most people in my life now see confusion/admittance of ignorance as an opportunity to educate. But for at least a little while each time I still feel like that isolated 9 year old being singled out & humiliated for not knowing things they hadn't been taught before.
952965319282364416 2018-01-15 18:06:52 UTC <muertaXangela> And while some people strike out through shame, I 100% turn it inwards and hurt myself rather than others. So I accept that it's MY failing rather than "ugh this is dumb anyway who TF cares?!"
952964625540288512 2018-01-15 18:04:06 UTC <muertaXangela> But I would always rather admit that I don't know than double down and potentially paint myself into a corner because the shame is awful enough without adding panic attacks to it.
952962790691663872 2018-01-15 17:56:49 UTC <muertaXangela> I also used to ask a lot of questions but was shamed over that and so tend more towards looking stuff up instead.
952962237999828994 2018-01-15 17:54:37 UTC <muertaXangela> Because sucking at something is the first step towards no sucking at something, but the shame and shittiness I feel over sucking at something makes me avoid doing it no matter how much I want to not suck at the thing.
952961528982097920 2018-01-15 17:51:48 UTC <muertaXangela> I was always excited to learn, and I still am, but it's become more geared towards facts rather than skills over the last 20 years. So I'm full of useless, random knowledge but no actual skills of any practical or artistic use.
952960451037548545 2018-01-15 17:47:31 UTC <muertaXangela> I am 5eva fighting the attitude that I am weak/stupid/bad for not instantly knowing/getting something, after said attitude was drilled into me by a shitty teacher who humiliated me every schoolday from age 9-11. That shame is hard to shake.

952559044622987264 2018-01-14 15:12:28 UTC <muertaXangela> @TriaElf9 I'm sorry terrible people have blamed you for their terrible behaviour. You don't deserve that - which I know can be hard to believe when you're being gaslit, but I hope you're able to remember it at least most of the time. And I hope it's not an experience you have to repeat.
952557266296803328 2018-01-14 15:05:24 UTC <muertaXangela> @TriaElf9 Right? I've done some F'd Up things & I am so ashamed about some of the ways I've treated people, so constantly pushing myself to be better and more aware. I can't "make up for it", but I hope at least to not keep doing it? I couldn't imagine doubling down on my BS.
952555501363040256 2018-01-14 14:58:23 UTC <muertaXangela> @TriaElf9 (Not that anyone who isn't introspective is abusive, just two examples from the thing. It was mostly about shame as a driving force behind making abusers more abusive?)
952554853720608768 2018-01-14 14:55:49 UTC <muertaXangela> @TriaElf9 But I read a thing about the power of shame. More introspective people try to avoid feeling shame by avoiding actions that would cause it. Abusers/toxic people strike out against those who make them feel it, blaming them rather than themselves ("you make me do this" attitude).
952553307888906242 2018-01-14 14:49:40 UTC <muertaXangela> @TriaElf9 AFABs /tend/ to be more socialised towards emotional labour, apologising, changing themselves to suit others. AMABs far less so. So there is a cultural thing. But reasons are not excuses. And while apologising might be something you have to learn, surely basic empathy is innate?

952391905177952256 2018-01-13 04:08:19 UTC <muertaXangela> @ToweringProle I'm sorry. Walls of text take a while and I know anxiety builds in that times, but some things are too important to articulate correctly to rush. I don't want miscommunication to cause problems.

951829933680193536 2018-01-12 14:55:14 UTC <muertaXangela> I ate a real human adult person meal yesterday and I kept it all down! Waves of nausea and pain and lower GI distress, but that's been standard even if I just have a drink or eat something bland. So I guess I'm as safe eating real food as I am eating sickness management food.
951642569485836288 2018-01-11 02:30:43 UTC <muertaXangela> I've gotten to the point where my back audibly cracks when I yawn... I really need to see a chiropractor/massage therapist.

951639483841175552 2018-01-11 02:18:28 UTC <muertaXangela> @ToweringProle As a salt goblin who is actively working on not being such a colossal shitehawk as they've previously been, that's good to know.

951636654149824513 2018-01-11 02:07:13 UTC <muertaXangela> @ToweringProle It definitely depends who writes him, but I'm here for characters who realise how shitty they've been & make a genuine effort to change and use their privileges for good. I'm also here for petty little salt goblins who act out from spite, bc they can be so much fun if done well.

951632219944210432 2018-01-11 01:49:36 UTC <muertaXangela> @ToweringProle I'm biased bc I like him as a character & am annoyed with MCUs continual "make Stark suffer for every decision he's ever made even when any reasonable person'd agree it was the right call at the time" thing, it's boring & irritating. I don't necessarily like him as a Person tho.

951630287582236672 2018-01-11 01:41:55 UTC <muertaXangela> @ToweringProle Bruce Wayne just spends HIS money on cool toys to more effectively punch poor/mentally ill/traumatised people in the face instead of using it to address the problems (massive economic disparity, horrorshow mental health support, etc).
951628718035931136 2018-01-11 01:35:41 UTC <muertaXangela> @ToweringProle Tony is at least better about using his money than Batman. I fucken hate Batman. Tony's a smarmy little snark machine who makes poor choices but gives a fuck. Like, he canonically bought a soda company just so he could use their vending machines to make medication accessible?

951485096531554305 2018-01-11 16:04:59 UTC <muertaXangela> @Galia Needle phobia plus I'm not underweight at the moment so nobody would take it seriously anyway.
951483843781021696 2018-01-11 16:00:00 UTC <muertaXangela> I'm trying so hard to be sensible and careful about what/how much I eat, but I feel like I'm being punished either way and I don't know what to do and I'm so hungry but so afraid to eat.
951482863182106624 2018-01-11 15:56:06 UTC <muertaXangela> I'm so afraid of eating now because no matter what or how much I consume I end up stuck in a bathroom after. But my brain is fuzzy and spacey and my limbs are constantly trembling and I'm exhausted all the time and I feel perpetually on the verge of tears.
951482125525700608 2018-01-11 15:53:11 UTC <muertaXangela> Yesterday was the most I've eaten in days: a piece of bread with some peanut butter (for salt), a small baked potato, a satsuma, 2 cups of tea, a glass of water... Spread out over the whole day. Every time I ate or drank something my whole digestive system would rebel.
951478307605884929 2018-01-11 15:38:00 UTC <muertaXangela> I mean, I am also afraid of eating because every time I've done so for the past several days I've ended up with terrible waves of nausea and being stuck in a bathroom for at least an hour. Not because binge-purge, my body just isn't coping well with anything being inside it.
951477257905823744 2018-01-11 15:33:50 UTC <muertaXangela> [CW: EATING DISORDERS]  The problem with suffering from BOTH purge & non-purge bulimia is that attempts to manage the binging (& subsequent purging) so often just turn into a starvation/fasting point of the non-purge cycle.
951470868080791553 2018-01-11 15:08:27 UTC <muertaXangela> Most upsetting meal I've had since dairy allergy: vegan "cheeseburger" that was literally a bun containing a slice of tomato, a piece of lettuce, a mushroom, and a tasteless slice of putty.

951459472706293760 2018-01-11 14:23:10 UTC <muertaXangela> I tried to suggest using a good spiced dark rum in coffee instead of bourbon and my phone wanted to know if I meant "bourgeois" instead of "bourbon" and I am laughing way too hard about that.
951437019003195392 2018-01-11 12:53:56 UTC <muertaXangela> As a person with a lot of feline tendencies I like to show my affection with nuzzles, purrs, bringing food, grooming, playing together, and occasionally biting and scratching the shit out of them. Y'know, if they're into that.
951430678968750081 2018-01-11 12:28:45 UTC <muertaXangela> @jpwilbury @HippieGeekGirl Official scientific terminology is "agametic reproduction".

For all that I am a hella sexual person, I have So Many squishes & friendship crushes. If romance/sex happens then wow bonus but I'd be so happy being friends & loving & supporting them. 
951066467092529153 2018-01-10 12:21:30 UTC <muertaXangela> Not always in a sexual/romantic way.

Also if you want to cuddle &/or kiss ever I would be super down for that but it is 100% not necessary."

948625173867106304 2018-01-03 18:40:40 UTC <muertaXangela> Can't do anything about the other disappointing thing. ANC headset supposed to arrive today. Order updates this afternoon that it won't arrive until tomorrow. When I won't be here. I'll be spending the day with 7-8 dogs. And could really do with ANC headphones. Great.
948616055148154881 2018-01-03 18:04:26 UTC <muertaXangela> I dealt with one disappointing/shitty thing and while the actual dealing with it part was fairly quick and reasonable, I'm still shaking and feeling sick over it. Because anxiety disorder. Yay.

948563471972622337 2018-01-03 14:35:29 UTC <muertaXangela> Honestly, the jokes just make themselves on this one.https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/948557564261879808
948562288109412352 2018-01-03 14:30:47 UTC <muertaXangela> @stavvers Casual reminder that #BaeOfPigs is also a thing that happened. #Hameron #PigGate #Snoutrage #NeverForget
948560206090395648 2018-01-03 14:22:31 UTC <muertaXangela> @ToweringProle *blushes*
948467948519387136 2018-01-03 08:15:55 UTC <muertaXangela> @korybing I still want flamboyant peacock raptors. Tell me that would be hilarious and terrifying to be swarmed by a bunch of deadly dandy-ass floof monsters.
948462189626699779 2018-01-02 07:53:02 UTC <muertaXangela> @awwpantsno Constant anxiety over it, TBH. I'm also very aware that I don't exactly live far away from a major military target in the UK - the largest naval base in Western Europeand the sole nuclear repair & refuelling facility for the Royal Navy.
948355133821325312 2018-01-02 00:47:38 UTC <muertaXangela> @ToweringProle Sex joke.
948300519734423552 2018-01-02 21:10:37 UTC <muertaXangela> Feeling pretty heckin' queer. #disabledandcute #mentallyill #queerpic.twitter.com/1KNel6RQOB
948240848222871553 2018-01-02 17:13:30 UTC <muertaXangela> Bought myself some OTK socks and a pair of cute thigh garters. And some thermal leggings. Because I deserve to be warm and comfy.
948226488389816326 2018-01-02 16:16:26 UTC <muertaXangela> @misdreavii Oh it's hella unfair. I'm upset. But I also feel backed into a corner.
948225475716972544 2018-01-02 16:12:25 UTC <muertaXangela> @misdreavii Unfortunately, an animal's welfare is at stake so I can't say no.
948207577074143232 2018-01-02 15:01:17 UTC <muertaXangela> Also, none of them have ever so much as offered to pay me. For doing their housework, decorating their houses, looking after their animals. These are legit jobs that people do. But I get benefits & "have the time" so I should just do them the favour. For 8+ hours a day.
948206532147245056 2018-01-02 14:57:08 UTC <muertaXangela> Conveniently forgetting that the reason I don't have a job is because I'm disabled & supposed to be spending my energy/time working on myself & trying to get better.
948206115174731778 2018-01-02 14:55:29 UTC <muertaXangela> Feeling more than a little bitter & taken advantage of. I've spent most of the last 2 years dealing with other people's needs & crises. When is it my turn to take care of my own needs? Goalposts get pushed back again & again, & everyone just expects it because I don't work.
947441149236662273 2017-12-31 12:15:47 UTC <muertaXangela> I'm an anxious-ass empath from a family that games and has at least one person in each generation who is hella competitive and/or a sore loser. My goal is fun, not winning.
947211114957430784 2017-12-30 21:01:42 UTC <muertaXangela> I like Monopoly. I have never played Risk. I am not overly competitive against other people.
947210526479745029 2017-12-30 20:59:22 UTC <muertaXangela> @billy_b0nes pic.twitter.com/Q1ONI3LJZU
946509884266303488 2017-12-28 22:35:16 UTC <muertaXangela> So I guess tonight is mostly crying about my feelings, gaming, and debating whether to spend nearly 70 on new headphones for myself.
946509400193331201 2017-12-28 22:33:20 UTC <muertaXangela> My list: fandom merch (specifically CR, ST/SW, Bioware), headphones, colouring pencils. One of my sisters got me colouring pencils (and a colouring book). Aside from that I got PJs etc, baking supplies (which admittedly should have been on the list), & make up/accessories.
946507598341304321 2017-12-28 22:26:11 UTC <muertaXangela> To be fair, I did like a bunch of the random stuff I was bought. But the things I didn't were so fucking disheartening... Plus why even ask me what I want if you're going to completely ignore it?
946506931690262533 2017-12-28 22:23:32 UTC <muertaXangela> So no, I'm not going to even be able to pretend to appreciate a face palette and a pack of foundation sponges/beauty blenders. At best, it feels like an unintentional twist of the knife. And when you bitch behind my back about my reaction, it feels more like a sick joke.
946505974134837248 2017-12-28 22:19:44 UTC <muertaXangela> Because it's really upsetting. At times, it's upsetting even to think about. My whole face with skin just flaking off, even whrn I'm not breaking out super terribly.
946505086271881217 2017-12-28 22:16:12 UTC <muertaXangela> None of this is new. Nor is it exactly something I can hide, it is literally my face. My family know all of this. They know that I have never really been able to use make up other than eye and lip products. They know that I gave up even trying around a decade ago.
946504341875318785 2017-12-28 22:13:14 UTC <muertaXangela> I have told my sad skin story to beauticians etc who've been So Confident that Their Product/Routine/Technique will be Different... only to end up horrified when they basically end up sliding around a gross, lumpy paste from my skin and products.
946502272250499074 2017-12-28 22:05:01 UTC <muertaXangela> None of this is new. I've been like this since around age 9. I've been prescribed various oral & topical medications, no positive effect. I was once offered acne treatment that required hospitalisation due to severe dehydration but that means a drip & I'm phobic of needles so no.
946500854139490304 2017-12-28 21:59:23 UTC <muertaXangela> Reasons being that my skin's basically worse than most teenagers even though I'm nearly 30; hella acne, it reacts to most products, & even if I exfoliate etc it just sloughs off in huge flakes which is accentuated by the use of make up even with primer etc.
946499270198296577 2017-12-28 21:53:05 UTC <muertaXangela> Gave family a list of stuff I'd like for yule as I'm "so hard to buy for" apparently. Got 1 thing off it & some random stuff, inc things I can't use for Reasons - much of which was hella femme despite being out as nonbinary and... It's just upsetting to not feel listened to.
946434276270145542 2017-12-28 17:34:50 UTC <muertaXangela> @ninoandamelie My fic-reading habits can mostly be described as "so you like to suffer?" - Slow burn, angst, hurt/comfort,  p a i n m e t a...
945694811801075712 2017-12-26 16:36:27 UTC <muertaXangela> All I want to do is eat today but I will definitely be sick if I eat more, why I am... ah, right, thirst, probably.
945690778273288192 2017-12-26 16:20:26 UTC <muertaXangela> Gay.
945688933471485955 2017-12-26 16:13:06 UTC <muertaXangela> @GigawattConduit Yes. It's also totally normal to have a lot of weird feelings about it or fixate on one relatively minor thing. Good luck.
945687446716583936 2017-12-26 16:07:11 UTC <muertaXangela> I love you. 
945675515716923397 2017-12-26 15:19:47 UTC <muertaXangela> @percahlia @billy_b0nes In every generation, a set of twins is born. They alone will face the vampires, the demons, and the forces of doorways.
945674203998707712 2017-12-26 15:14:34 UTC <muertaXangela> @billy_b0nes That awkward moment when a Pagan knows more about the New Testament than you...
945673992232415232 2017-12-26 15:13:44 UTC <muertaXangela> @AnnCoulter Read the Bible, Ann. Gospel of Matthew - Herod's Massacre of Innocents.
945673657501790208 2017-12-26 15:12:24 UTC <muertaXangela> @billy_b0nes Also they may not have been refugees when coming TO Bethlehem but according to the Gospel of Matthew they sure as fuck were when leaving it due to Herod's Massacre of Innocents.
945669693737717762 2017-12-26 14:56:39 UTC <muertaXangela>  Chai, chai! Making vanilla chai! Gotta brew it, but not stew it, or I'll ruin my chai! And them good ole boys stopped drinking whiskey and rye, Singin' this'll be the day I try chai, This'll be the day I try chai! 
945658035917262848 2017-12-26 14:10:19 UTC <muertaXangela> @Paula_White @ShaunKing Surprised they don't just come right out and say "Trump is putting the Christ back in Christmas and the White back in White House" - we all know that's what they really mean. Eurgh.
945656597971394560 2017-12-26 14:04:37 UTC <muertaXangela> So does that mean some of them know about us?
945383918588620802 2017-12-25 20:01:05 UTC <muertaXangela> @misdreavii The 360? I'm only borrowing it. It belongs to Kel.
945382673958227969 2017-12-25 19:56:08 UTC <muertaXangela> @misdreavii Because I'll be able to connect with my family in the UK, among other things.
945382362535391233 2017-12-25 19:54:54 UTC <muertaXangela> @misdreavii I'll be on PS4 in the States.
945381694294675456 2017-12-25 19:52:14 UTC <muertaXangela> @misdreavii Dragon Age: Inquisition. Because I still don't have Mass Effect on console and if I buy them for myself while I'm here it's basically admitting that I probably won't be moving any time soon and I'm not ready for that yet.
945379895567421440 2017-12-25 19:45:06 UTC <muertaXangela> Anyway, that's enough of that nonsense. Normal service resumes.pic.twitter.com/uEZfV26xY5
945373957183729664 2017-12-25 19:21:30 UTC <muertaXangela> What do you do to cheer yourself up at xmas when you are alone and sick and you cough so hard that you vomit? Play dress up, apparently.pic.twitter.com/RCaFPrwPEJ
945372937460252672 2017-12-25 19:17:27 UTC <muertaXangela> @stavvers What a terrible thing to show at Christmas! That's obviously more of a Samhain topic.
945371227723653121 2017-12-25 19:10:39 UTC <muertaXangela> Joke's on them! We're gross in love! Officially queer dating!
945313933803606016 2017-12-25 15:22:59 UTC <muertaXangela> @SailorHannibal Merry critmas from beyond the gender void.
945313445544714240 2017-12-25 15:21:03 UTC <muertaXangela> Welp, you're not rational. Byyyyyyyye! #godsblesstheblockbutton
945310938705645568 2017-12-25 15:11:05 UTC <muertaXangela> @SexWorkHive @letaushijmakaro Why not both? Make it safe for people choose sex work if they want to, but help those who are/feel trapped find a way out.
945307048174145542 2017-12-25 14:55:37 UTC <muertaXangela> True but they taste of chalk and can be used to garrote the wearer/eater, while candy canes come in a variety of delightful flavours and can be used by the eater as a stiletto.https://twitter.com/Uraharascience/status/945305613063675904
945305161760731136 2017-12-25 14:48:08 UTC <muertaXangela> I love candy canes because they are easily weaponised food.
945011943286431745 2017-12-24 19:22:59 UTC <muertaXangela> "You're handling this much better than I'd expected!" Thanks, it's the dissociation.
944965523829411840 2017-12-24 16:18:32 UTC <muertaXangela> Make the yuletide gay.
944959463085273089 2017-12-24 15:54:27 UTC <muertaXangela> Dragged my ass out of my sickbed to cobble together a bullshit pasta bake with bacon & mockzarella. Because I should probably eat something hot, but also because garlic & peppers help when you're sick & that's science.
944664335284162566 2017-12-23 20:21:43 UTC <muertaXangela> @misdreavii Saaaaame #driftpartners
944663473614618624 2017-12-23 20:18:17 UTC <muertaXangela> @misdreavii It feels wrong to do it any other way?
944630976625500161 2017-12-23 18:09:09 UTC <muertaXangela> All I'm saying is that there's nothing proving that the 3 gift-bearers weren't drag kings.
944629027213627398 2017-12-23 18:01:25 UTC <muertaXangela> Alexius: You are a mistake. You should never have existed. Me: True. #DragonAgeInquisition
944556473358708737 2017-12-23 13:13:06 UTC <muertaXangela> When 15 is too quiet but 20 is too loud...
944554127211814912 2017-12-23 13:03:47 UTC <muertaXangela> @cripesonfriday I am 29 and this year will be the 29th xmas I've been sick. Thankfully my family have finally accepted this is a thing and stopped pressuring me to engage. If Santa helped prevent the sick, encourage her to ask every year just in case she is similarly cursed.
944551685929750529 2017-12-23 12:54:05 UTC <muertaXangela> @billy_b0nes Gaaaaaaaaaay.
944354430056632320 2017-12-22 23:50:16 UTC <muertaXangela> @billy_b0nes Mimic EW! (Get it? Like Mimikyu? Th-the Pokemon? Because I'm a big nerd? ... I'll show myself out.)
944349476071923712 2017-12-22 23:30:34 UTC <muertaXangela> @misdreavii ILY and I'm proud of you and I want to personally punch everyone and everything that makes you sad.
944306298719494146 2017-12-22 20:39:00 UTC <muertaXangela> @KRADeC ... ew.
944303986345160704 2017-12-22 20:29:49 UTC <muertaXangela> I should have something healthy for dinner. *dumps a bag of cherry tomatoes into a tub of baby cucumbers* Perfect.
944247962535890944 2017-12-22 16:47:12 UTC <muertaXangela> Me, thinking: How do I express the intense love and affection I am feeling for this person right now? Me: Nerd. #nailedit
943959014580391936 2017-12-21 21:39:01 UTC <muertaXangela> A few weeks ago, my mum asked if I had any books she could borrow as her kindle charger was awol. I only had @seananmcguire's #IntoTheDrowningDeep. I offered it, despite just starting it myself. Today she said I can't take it home as she's really enjoying it. I guess it's good?
943938266918739975 2017-12-21 20:16:35 UTC <muertaXangela> Totally read this as protesters physically attack feds in a courtroom and the jury was like "nah, man, that's fair" #turnaboutisfairplaypic.twitter.com/pCYJSFhk2C
943916201960464384 2017-12-21 18:48:54 UTC <muertaXangela> @Autistic_Ace Thinking of you, friend.
943915572550660097 2017-12-21 18:46:24 UTC <muertaXangela> @al_vimh Sounds amazing to me.
943915195956649984 2017-12-21 18:44:54 UTC <muertaXangela> My grandad: So when are we seeing you if you don't like Christmas? Me: *dead-eyed stare* You're seeing me now aren't you?
943915122971594752 2017-12-21 18:44:37 UTC <muertaXangela> And the goalposts kept moving, which messes with my mental health which in turn affects my physical health. I'm also legit always sick at xmas - every year of my life - so I desperately needed to not have to combine mental/physical/emotional/social exhaustion with actual illness.
943913619535859712 2017-12-21 18:38:38 UTC <muertaXangela> I have been chronically overpeopled for months and unable to do anything about it.
943913403319545856 2017-12-21 18:37:47 UTC <muertaXangela> *sobs happily* I'm finally home! I'm finally alone! I'm finally free of commitments and plans thrust on me by my relatives! This truly is a blessed Yule!
943818656194101248 2017-12-21 12:21:17 UTC <muertaXangela> @sandyd68 Love you, babe. Glad you're here. 
943818074045722624 2017-12-21 12:18:58 UTC <muertaXangela> Being polyam and/or bi/pansexual doesn't mean lacking standards, Helen, you and your husband are safe.
943596883490025472 2017-12-20 21:40:02 UTC <muertaXangela> "Millennials are so entitled" I cried this morning because I woke up from a dream where I had been moving into a house with my loved ones, so...
943500788021817345 2017-12-20 15:18:11 UTC <muertaXangela> @ToweringProle I'm sorry you're dealing with that, friend.
943496967828787200 2017-12-20 15:03:01 UTC <muertaXangela> @misdreavii Not taken for granted by you. Relatives keep asking me to do stuff that keeps moving my goalposts. Always last minute & w/ emotionally loaded framing, & I /might/ get a "thanks for that" after.
943232849129426944 2017-12-19 21:33:30 UTC <muertaXangela> Goalposts moved again so I won't be able to go home until Thursday now. And I've spent all day grocery shopping, spending approx 250 in one day. I'm hella tired, overpeopled, & feeling taken for granted. #NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives
942913662087548929 2017-12-18 00:25:10 UTC <muertaXangela> @billy_b0nes It might just be my experience but I've found that monosexuals tend way more towards gatekeeping, A/trans/(obvs)biphobia & erasure, and generally being hateful asshats about the idea that anything is other than binary?
942909082683441152 2017-12-18 00:06:58 UTC <muertaXangela> I need more dairy-free chilli hot chocolate in my life. Warm and spicy and comforting.
942776580052541440 2017-12-18 15:20:27 UTC <muertaXangela> @h_m_m I'd say go for it, but @DasUmlaut called dibs on Sam Neill.
942774697544085504 2017-12-18 15:12:58 UTC <muertaXangela> Me: I have so much stuff to do but from Wednesday I will be free to fall apart and/do nothing. My body: Okay but what if I have all the unpleasant, inconvenient, and painful stress symptoms now which prevent you from doing everything you need to by your deadline?
942565138170810369 2017-12-17 01:20:15 UTC <muertaXangela> I lay across the bed to set up Netflix to go in the background while I wrap presents and I felt like Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park so I took a selfie of it. #eyesofakillerpic.twitter.com/dItb6br5Kf

942444873252208640 2017-12-17 17:22:22 UTC <muertaXangela> Mum: Do you think we can edit this person out? Because I like this picture of Kel but I don't want them in it. Me: Given that neither of us know anything about photo editing and you have no photo editing software on your computer, I would say no Mum: Well I'm going to try anyway.

942324333837537280 2017-12-17 09:23:23 UTC <muertaXangela> @Mort3mer @thjsdecember Auditory processing issues can be a thing separate from classic hearing problems/deafness. So it makes perfect sense. Have a great day.
942323759117107201 2017-12-17 09:21:06 UTC <muertaXangela> It's helpful for people w/ auditory processing issues, as well as classic hearing probs/deafness.  If you have a deaf/HoH house member, it can definitely feel like something is missing w/out subs. And it helps when music/action sequences are Too Loud while dialogue is Too Quiet.https://twitter.com/Mort3mer/status/942276497674403840

941686347466764289 2017-12-15 15:08:15 UTC <muertaXangela> Not thrown up so far today but nursing nausea and killer headache that painkillers don't touch. Sleep is the only reprieve.
941622198430822401 2017-12-15 10:53:21 UTC <muertaXangela> @Marisha_Ray In the UK, Stella Artois is often called Stella Act-a-Tw*t. So that guy is pretty on brand.

941089329736187904 2017-12-13 23:35:55 UTC <muertaXangela> Not even a little bit surprised that I'm stuck throwing up in the bathroom after today. But I'm so damn tired. I just want to sleep.
941074737765257216 2017-12-13 22:37:56 UTC <muertaXangela> I keep dreaming that I'm dozing while different members of #CriticalRole play with my hair as they hang out and talk amongst themselves. Very good and soft and wholesome. A welcome break from the nightmares, anxiety dreams, and my general existence.

940329899700768768 2017-12-11 21:18:13 UTC <muertaXangela> I've associated the whole #CriticalRole cast with goodness and comfort, I guess? So hearing any of them in things makes me feel a little better? Even if the subject matter isn't exactly light, it actually still find it kind of calming?
940289980060065793 2017-12-11 18:39:35 UTC <muertaXangela> Ugh, I feel sick. I need to put on something light-hearted and non-violent that won't make me cringe... Ah, FMA: Brotherhood, perfect.

940185529919909889 2017-12-11 11:44:32 UTC <muertaXangela> Nibling's favourite film is #Trolls. Her favourite part is #GetBackUpAgain. Yesterday I blew her mind by putting that clip on repeat on YouTube. Every time she got more excited. I had to cut her off after the 5th because she went Full Marshmallow.
939822770652934145 2017-12-10 11:43:04 UTC <muertaXangela> @GigawattConduit @themackenzilee Also: in Norse mythology, Loki is a shapeshifter who takes female & male forms whenever, and in Norse culture magic was seen as a woman's gift. So. Over a thousand years of canon. But sure, queerness is just a new trend(!)

If I get another implied "it's all right, love, let the men handle it" today, someone is going to get fucking decked.

939619814670241797 2017-12-09 22:16:35 UTC <muertaXangela> @Zedda7Cups For dye I prefer friends/loved ones with years of experience putting weird colours in their own hair. I've had salons do the thing in the past but it's always been some variation on "natural" colours and that's not really my jam TBH.
939618715607420932 2017-12-09 22:12:13 UTC <muertaXangela> @Zedda7Cups Depends what they're doing. If it's nothing with blades, I have no specific hair concerns just social anxiety. If it's blades, I say "just a trim" while accepting that unknowns may take more but my hair is so long that even losing a foot won't make it Too Short.
939616688760393728 2017-12-09 22:04:10 UTC <muertaXangela> I feel Hella Sick but Zuko's "that's rough, buddy" makes me snort every time. #AtLA
939586893250990080 2017-12-09 20:05:46 UTC <muertaXangela> @Zedda7Cups I'm not purposefully doing anything with my hair. I'm vaguely curious about its terminal length but that's about it. My primary way of dealing with things is to not deal with them.
939586067589627904 2017-12-09 20:02:29 UTC <muertaXangela> @Zedda7Cups I meant that I have very little skill with hair, I can just about do a basic plait and buns. Short hair takes effort amd maintenance and styling and products. You can put long hair up and that is enough.
939584066030104576 2017-12-09 19:54:32 UTC <muertaXangela> @Zedda7Cups I had a horrendous bob cut at age 9 which did not suit me at all & since then anything above my shoulders is Too Short. But that's just a bad haircut and nothing to do with trauma or mental illness. Plus I'm lazy & bad at hair; long hair is actually lower maintenance than short.
939553526396735488 2017-12-09 17:53:11 UTC <muertaXangela> @Zedda7Cups My social anxiety prevents me from going to hairdressers but that's about it?
939550847024984065 2017-12-09 17:42:32 UTC <muertaXangela> @MaryneeLahaye I have knee-length hair, if I don't have it in a bun I regularly trap myself in bed by lying on it. It gets stuck in car doors. I take myself out if it gets snagged as I walk. Going into a fast-paced, hectic environment with long hair worn down and is a Bad Idea.
939544331848994817 2017-12-09 17:16:39 UTC <muertaXangela> Nibling is very tired from a long night of keeping everyone up with screaming. She has a nasty cold, and can only sleep with the power of cuddles and Calpol. #samekid #disabledandcute #mentallyill #queerpic.twitter.com/4OWlTPafet

939202397943009282 2017-12-08 18:37:55 UTC <muertaXangela> #GetBackUpAgain is her absolute favourite part BTW.
939200765079506945 2017-12-08 18:31:26 UTC <muertaXangela> Pretty much nothing makes the nibling happier than watching #Trolls. 9 months old & she is consistently enthralled, fully engages, & sings/dances along. We try to introduce her to other stuff but it's very clear this film is her favourite, & it's adorable how into it she gets.

939138024872562690 2017-12-08 14:22:08 UTC <muertaXangela> I truly hope that @Marisha_Ray, @matthewmercer, @executivegoth, @VoiceOfOBrien, @LauraBaileyVO, @WillingBlam, @samriegel, @TheVulcanSalute, & all the friends & colleagues who joined them know that they are loved & appreciated - esp at this time. Thank you, @CriticalRole. 
939136251873189888 2017-12-08 14:15:05 UTC <muertaXangela> #CriticalRole has meant a great deal to me; it was there for me to cling to when I felt that everything in my life was overwhelmingly taking, giving nothing. I am endlessly grateful to all of them for choosing to share their game, & for being good & positive influences.
939131448375857152 2017-12-08 13:56:00 UTC <muertaXangela> @LordSteve The majority of women & queers in the fandom tend to be positive & Good (but often post a lot of meta that breaks your fucking heart because they are So Invested in these characters that you also love So Much). I can recommend some good people if ever you want to gush about CR.

938876131066957825 2017-12-07 21:01:27 UTC <muertaXangela> Spent the whole afternoon painting my mother's house while  on a call with @ImTheSecondWave, one of my partners.

938730012907319296 2017-12-07 11:20:50 UTC <muertaXangela> @davidallengreen I used to work for a company that did Steampunk events in the US. I don't think they appreciated my comments about the realities of poverty, classism, colonialism, and other F'd up things from the Victorian era. Nor correcting them on the actual dates for it.

937788081150840832 2017-12-04 20:57:56 UTC <muertaXangela> I don't feel like a girl, I don't feel like a boy, and I struggle really hard with that whole Not Queer Enough feeling.
937786633407160320 2017-12-04 20:52:11 UTC <muertaXangela> And obvs knee-length hair is unusual regardless of gender, it seems hella rare to find NBs with even shoulder-length hair, let alone longer.
937785539733917696 2017-12-04 20:47:50 UTC <muertaXangela> And while I love having long hair, it's not exactly an androgynous look. I feel like I'll never be seen as anything but a woman, and since childhood I've always said "I'm not a real girl."

937272139908046854 2017-12-03 10:47:46 UTC <muertaXangela> Sister: Who's the brainiest out of you two? Me: Depends on the subject. Mum: Obviously the answer is your grandma... I mean, your baby's grandma... Me: Yes, that clearly does answer her question, just not the way you intended.
937073548845355009 2017-12-02 21:38:38 UTC <muertaXangela> @On_A_Baldridge For the N of non-binary. Based off a Spanish gender neutral term for aunt/uncle, which is titi (for tia/tio) but it sounds way too much like titty for me and it also can be associated with being femme so nah.http://genderqueeries.tumblr.com/titles
937061224654794753 2017-12-02 20:49:40 UTC <muertaXangela> Officially a Nini, not an Auntie. I'm grateful to have an immediate family who may not necessarily understand but still accept. #nonbinary #queer

935904801904386048 2017-11-29 16:14:27 UTC <muertaXangela> @misdreavii Yeah, I was pretty much like "yeah, whatever, he's a grownass man, and a grandfather no less, he's neither my son nor my husband, this is not my responsibility."
935820099604402176 2017-11-29 10:37:53 UTC <muertaXangela> Mum: Gary is very sick, please make sure he rests. Me: Yeah, that'll happen(!) Mum says I'm to make sure you rest. Stepdad: I ain't resting, I'm sorting the doors now.

935238109985411072 2017-11-27 20:05:15 UTC <muertaXangela> @stavvers One of my US friends shared the Guardian article & I was like "honey, no..." I explained the current transphobia frenzy here ATM & pointed out the subtext of "ugh, frothing trans SJWs ruin everything!" under the guise of "balanced viewpoints."

935193406455894016 2017-11-27 17:07:37 UTC <muertaXangela> @misdreavii Basically. 
935192295397347329 2017-11-27 17:03:12 UTC <muertaXangela> @misdreavii Hopefully not much longer. Not that I want to be in the US or think it's particularly good, it's just the best way for me to be with my fave nerds. 
935176661112426496 2017-11-27 16:01:05 UTC <muertaXangela> Dear Americans who clearly have no clue about the atrocious steaming shitpile that is the UK: Stop. It is not better here.

934529516810199040 2017-11-25 21:09:34 UTC <muertaXangela> I'm feeling very sad and very alone right now.
934506479100538884 2017-11-25 19:38:01 UTC <muertaXangela> At least I got to actually bang Zev & Fenris though.

933826446228934656 2017-11-23 22:35:49 UTC <muertaXangela> Ex girlfriend just messaged me out of the blue after over a decade? So obviously I've ignored it and am now I'm crying about my past and the shitty person I was and the shitty things I went through.
933798401581506565 2017-11-23 20:44:22 UTC <muertaXangela> In her case, yes, she definitely appreciated a silly way of her loved ones reaching out to say they're thinking of her on this day of mourning and recognising the atrocities done to her people both in the past and continuing today.
933797465333161984 2017-11-23 20:40:39 UTC <muertaXangela> Obviously this is not something you should ever do to random Native Americans, but we know her very well and know her sense of humour and what she'd appreciate and would she wouldn't.
933797103964491777 2017-11-23 20:39:13 UTC <muertaXangela> The phone was not on speaker.
933796917594738689 2017-11-23 20:38:28 UTC <muertaXangela> One of my mum's oldest friends is part Cherokee. Not in a White People "8 generations ago" way, she's very visibly racially Native American. So obviously we called to say "Happy Thanksgiving, godless savage" - I could hear her cackling from the other room.
933794605895684097 2017-11-23 20:29:17 UTC <muertaXangela> My mother is adorable. Every time she makes me poached egg on toast, she makes it a smiley face. I'm 30 next birthday.
933762027885158401 2017-11-23 18:19:50 UTC <muertaXangela> I painted a wall, and did some dishes, and scraped paint off the glass from when my mum painted the door, and had a shower, and remembered to eat... I'm tired now.

933309550438047744 2017-11-22 12:21:51 UTC <muertaXangela> @ZacBruin For me, it helps to make the distinction in my head between Love and Like - as in "I love you but I don't like you very much rn." Also distinction between Family and Relatives, because being family is about more than blood. Found family is So Important.

I guess some people might consider coersion a grey area because technically you said yes, but they are wrong - a yes doesn't count if no isn't an option. If it's not a "fuck yes!" it's a no. Always.

919928145553305602 2017-10-16 14:08:55 UTC <muertaXangela> Dictionary def of queer = "outside the norm" Coercive heteronormativity assumes everyone = allocishet. Queer = everyone who isn't. Inc Ace.

912707300636463111 2017-09-26 15:55:52 UTC <muertaXangela> @HippieGeekGirl Why does every conversation about wanting to see people who are like me turn into "ugh, labels"?
912706674196123649 2017-09-26 15:53:23 UTC <muertaXangela> @HippieGeekGirl As a nonbinary person who's been mentally ill since childhood, if I want to headcanon Riley from Inside Out as nb WTF is wrong with that?

910084225176662016 2017-09-19 10:12:42 UTC <muertaXangela> If someone doesn't want to know penguin facts, leave them on an ice floe & push them out to sea.

900813837603090433 2017-08-24 20:15:29 UTC <muertaXangela> Reasons why I can't stop crying rn: I said no to someone, I can't take a joke, someone asked me about handfastings  I'm so fucking pathetic.

900618370277675009 2017-08-24 07:18:46 UTC <muertaXangela> @billy_b0nes @ksej Sex trafficking & slavery is exploitation. But you aren't going to protect sex workers from exploitation by criminalising sex work.

899199005997101056 2017-08-20 09:18:43 UTC <muertaXangela> then managed to set him up so he would get his head stuck in a thing.

893234216233820160 2017-08-03 22:16:47 UTC <muertaXangela> Oh, and my right arm has a fucking lump where I had my tetanus jab yesterday because of course.
893204799331729408 2017-08-03 20:19:53 UTC <muertaXangela> Been crying a lot today so I'm pretty astonished by the fact that this make up has mostly stayed put. #disabledandcute #mentallyill #queerpic.twitter.com/rfQKQzsjTJ
893164609548550144 2017-08-03 17:40:11 UTC <muertaXangela> Day continues to shit on me. Crying but I now have food.
893154409382912000 2017-08-03 16:59:39 UTC <muertaXangela> @splunge2000 I found 20 in my house yesterday while sorting my stuff, spending it on take out so I have food for days.
893154084122972164 2017-08-03 16:58:22 UTC <muertaXangela> @splunge2000 It's a rat skeleton (metal, not real). I like to think of it as the Death of Rats from #Discworld curled up around my hair for a nap.
893153271896043521 2017-08-03 16:55:08 UTC <muertaXangela> This whole year is fired.
893153216111759361 2017-08-03 16:54:55 UTC <muertaXangela> This is gorram ridiculous. Yesterday I had to deal with my needle phobia to get 2 jabs, today I had to deal with my wasp phobia.
893152945122025473 2017-08-03 16:53:50 UTC <muertaXangela> Remember how I said life is Hard? A FUCKEN WASP JUST FLEW IN MY WINDOW! GUESS WHO IS PHOBIC OF WASPS?!

893102650329366528 2017-08-03 13:33:59 UTC <muertaXangela> @Marisha_Ray Have you any dietary restrictions or foods you don't like? Or foods you esp love? I'm working on a kitchen witchery project.
892874007963459584 2017-08-02 22:25:26 UTC <muertaXangela> It seems like everyone who makes #ASMR videos on YouTube is so gorram pretty. I've thought about making my own but I'm a potato with eyes.

892787999905382400 2017-08-02 16:43:41 UTC <muertaXangela> Back at mine. Arms stabbed, meds collected, last of documents forwarded to immigration doctors, Ki cuddled, food ate. Flop now.
892785323373154306 2017-08-02 16:33:02 UTC <muertaXangela> @KeefJudge Not the worst thing I've done after chopping chillies. Plot twist: discovered a new kink.

892752721564053504 2017-08-02 14:23:30 UTC <muertaXangela> Jabs done. Only cried a lot. One in each arm, but the left hurts a lot more.
892712163281956864 2017-08-02 11:42:20 UTC <muertaXangela> I've already spent my whole morning sobbing, I'm not going to start my afternoon getting yelled at. Click.
892693842822082560 2017-08-02 10:29:32 UTC <muertaXangela> I need to learn to just accept that. But right now all I can do is cry.
892693475162025984 2017-08-02 10:28:04 UTC <muertaXangela> Life lately just seems to be reinforcing that I'm not allowed anything for myself. No matter how much progress I make or how kind/good I am.
892693025712943104 2017-08-02 10:26:17 UTC <muertaXangela> Try to treat myself to vegan chocolate? Eat 2 pieces, then end up paying  130 in vet bills because the dog got into my bag and ate it all.
892692648737288192 2017-08-02 10:24:47 UTC <muertaXangela> And lately Every Time I've tried to treat myself to a Want, no matter how small, it's ended up going badly and having me in floods of tears.
892692110599741440 2017-08-02 10:22:39 UTC <muertaXangela> I so rarely acknowledge the things I want, because Needs take priority and anything on top of that feels like asking Too Much.
892691773243445249 2017-08-02 10:21:18 UTC <muertaXangela> Reaching out is Hard for me. It means I pysched myself up to do whatever we'd planned, then made myself vulnerable by voicing a Want.
892691496910106625 2017-08-02 10:20:12 UTC <muertaXangela> Especially if I had to reach out to you over it in order to find out.
892690391883034628 2017-08-02 10:15:49 UTC <muertaXangela> I'm antisocial AF, I'm OK not making plans, but specifically reaching out to suggest plans then doing it without me makes me feel like shit.
892688518098685952 2017-08-02 10:08:22 UTC <muertaXangela> Them: Let do Thing! Me: OK. -days/weeks later- Me: Um, so when did you want to do Thing? Them: lol sorry I did Thing without you. Me: ...ok.

892338544580153344 2017-08-01 10:57:42 UTC <muertaXangela> Apparently, anxiety means random heat spikes but depression means I can't get warm. Why are my body & brain such garbage? #mentalillness
891738300352012289 2017-07-30 19:12:33 UTC <muertaXangela> @Galia Peach too though.

891715184569581568 2017-07-30 17:40:41 UTC <muertaXangela> @GigawattConduit But if it's not your word it should stay the heck out of your mouth. Why tie yourself in knots looking for an excuse to say it? Just stop.
891714869472501761 2017-07-30 17:39:26 UTC <muertaXangela> @GigawattConduit I'm hella about reclaiming slurs that have been applied to you - if that's what you want to do.
891714462272696320 2017-07-30 17:37:49 UTC <muertaXangela> @GigawattConduit I'll never understand the fascination with saying slurs that have nothing to do with you.
891713898054922242 2017-07-30 17:35:35 UTC <muertaXangela> I truly am a master of the bullshit pasta bake.
891703388710350848 2017-07-30 16:53:49 UTC <muertaXangela> I love baking A Lot but my real #kitchenmagic specialty is making delicious bullshit pasta bakes out of whatever I happen to have available.
891694288047943680 2017-07-30 16:17:39 UTC <muertaXangela> Anyway, even though I'm tired 5eva & struggling with motivation & executive dysfunction, I made myself clean the oven & cook. #progress

891691353847025664 2017-07-30 16:06:00 UTC <muertaXangela> Fuck you - scrubbing an oven, changing bedding, and vacuuming definitely count as cardio.
891691307256643584 2017-07-30 16:05:49 UTC <muertaXangela> Pisses me off when I'm panting and sweating buckets only to have my phone tell me it looks like I'm falling behind on my goals.
891691234091249666 2017-07-30 16:05:31 UTC <muertaXangela> I need an exercise monitor that recognises housework and how much energy certain tasks take.

890962020664840196 2017-07-28 15:47:53 UTC <muertaXangela> I start low intensity CBT treatment on the 25th. Shaking with relief. Been fighting for more #mentalhealth help for years. #mentalillness

890629272842379266 2017-07-27 17:45:40 UTC <muertaXangela> I'm kitchen table polyam and kitchen table non-nuclear fam. #Polyamory #Family

890620263976640512 2017-07-27 17:09:52 UTC <muertaXangela> Trying to convince self it's a win as I was able to do SOMETHING, even if not as much as I'd hoped, when I didn't feel up to doing ANYTHING.
890619803999780864 2017-07-27 17:08:02 UTC <muertaXangela> I wanted to do housework today too but I only ended up doing dishes.
890617762221101057 2017-07-27 16:59:56 UTC <muertaXangela> Having a low spoon/energy/motivation day, couldn't make myself do yoga but managed to gather enough to make a korma & start a chicken soup.
890515779573231616 2017-07-27 10:14:41 UTC <muertaXangela> @al_vimh I had exactly the same thought process a few days ago when I finally caught the little bugger.
890513531392716800 2017-07-27 10:05:45 UTC <muertaXangela> @chiller @anwen @judeinlondon @stavvers /rant Sorry about that. Cuts to MH services are a sore spot as I've been fighting for help for years but have such limited options here.
890512709481099264 2017-07-27 10:02:29 UTC <muertaXangela> @chiller @anwen @judeinlondon @stavvers A combination of the right cocktail of meds & the right therapy for you is best. Not cuts, stigma, silence, & scaremongering.
890511265092775936 2017-07-27 09:56:45 UTC <muertaXangela> @chiller @anwen @judeinlondon @stavvers Unfortunately, massive cuts & limited access to mental health support means I've been struggling to get help with that.
890510868756279297 2017-07-27 09:55:10 UTC <muertaXangela> @chiller @anwen @judeinlondon @stavvers I'm volatile AF during the 1st few months, but after that I have more stability & energy to help me work on my mental health in other ways.
890510036786663425 2017-07-27 09:51:52 UTC <muertaXangela> @chiller @anwen @judeinlondon @stavvers I'm on mirtazapine & sertraline. I'm sick less, no longer underweight, have more energy & self control, don't actively wanna die as often.
890508805519405056 2017-07-27 09:46:58 UTC <muertaXangela> @chiller @anwen @judeinlondon @stavvers Adequate education & resources are needed to provide that support, not cuts & scaremongering.
890508212432228353 2017-07-27 09:44:37 UTC <muertaXangela> @chiller @anwen @judeinlondon @stavvers So people who felt suicidal but didn't have energy to act on it now do. Which is why it's important to have proper support while adjusting.
890507585601904640 2017-07-27 09:42:07 UTC <muertaXangela> @chiller @anwen @judeinlondon @stavvers 1 reason for increased suicide risk in the 1st few months of taking SSRIs is they improve your energy levels before your mood stabilises.

889861864729059329 2017-07-25 14:56:16 UTC <muertaXangela> @judeinlondon If it walks like a TERF and squawks like a TERF, can people please stop pretending it's just a harmless duck?
889612198988980224 2017-07-24 22:24:11 UTC <muertaXangela> @billy_b0nes Agreeeee. Also begs the question if Snape would have tried to bang Harry if they looked more like Lilly? Probably. Gross.
889611734650167296 2017-07-24 22:22:20 UTC <muertaXangela> Ugh ugh UGH! One of my pills is stuck in my throat and it won't shift, everything is terrible! It burns but I need to sleep!
889610679816212481 2017-07-24 22:18:08 UTC <muertaXangela> @billy_b0nes I do remember that the actor portrayed the sly slimeball well though.
889610267721699334 2017-07-24 22:16:30 UTC <muertaXangela> @billy_b0nes I think book!littlefinger is a good character but as a person he is absolute garbage. I stopped watching the show years ago because reasons.

888134597183143936 2017-07-20 20:32:43 UTC <muertaXangela> Weirdness was a spiritual/supernatural/superstitious/culty combo involving chanting people lining up to go through a door?
888134415565680643 2017-07-20 20:32:00 UTC <muertaXangela> The weirdness was unrelated to Daniel Radcliffe, he was presumably sleeping through it.
888133597051408385 2017-07-20 20:28:44 UTC <muertaXangela> Dreamt was @ a LARP in a storm & a drunk, sad, soaked Dan Radcliffe showed up? I wrapped him in blankets, put him to bed. Then it got weird.

887613546342821888 2017-07-19 10:02:15 UTC <muertaXangela> @bae_warden Still way more words than some people know. And some use obnoxiously purple prose to attempt to cover for the fact that their writing sucks.

887610989180583936 2017-07-19 09:52:05 UTC <muertaXangela> @bae_warden If you ever feel bad about your writing, remember that 50 Shades Of Grey is an international best seller, then say "eff it" & keep writing.
887609701176881152 2017-07-19 09:46:58 UTC <muertaXangela> @bae_warden Aren't you multilingual though? That's So Many Word! Lots of writers only know 1 lang & are still shit in it but somehow published/popular?
887608071773728768 2017-07-19 09:40:29 UTC <muertaXangela> @ThomasSanders You likely have ppl you can talk to but if you ever wanna talk to an understanding stranger who won't break confidence, I'm a good listener.
887606824756809730 2017-07-19 09:35:32 UTC <muertaXangela> @ThomasSanders I know everyone wants to cheer you, but it's OK to be sad too. There's a lot of pressure on you to perform, but you as a person come first.
887604649217359872 2017-07-19 09:26:53 UTC <muertaXangela> @MaraWilson I've my issues w/ Liverpool but it's a great place to visit & access to the museums & theatres growing up was formative for this queer nerd.
887602304307933185 2017-07-19 09:17:34 UTC <muertaXangela> @judeinlondon So I guess pump & bottle, never discuss how awkward/painful anything is, put baby 1st but never forget you're supposed to be a sex object?
887601112051798016 2017-07-19 09:12:50 UTC <muertaXangela> @judeinlondon And also we can't talk about any problems we have with breasts unless it's wanting an enlargement because boobs must always be sexy.
887600604734009344 2017-07-19 09:10:49 UTC <muertaXangela> @judeinlondon Boobs are sexy & for male consumption so it's obscene to breastfeed in public but you're a bad mother if you don't feed your kid breastmilk
887600072036372480 2017-07-19 09:08:42 UTC <muertaXangela> @judeinlondon Agreed. It should be a personal choice, like most things. But breastfeeding is stuck in a weird place between misogyny & "breast is best"...
887598453110562818 2017-07-19 09:02:16 UTC <muertaXangela> @judeinlondon Same happened w/ my mum & little sister but she got an NHS boob job. She was in her 20s w/ saddle bags, no breast tissue, & depression.
887596522292039682 2017-07-19 08:54:36 UTC <muertaXangela> @billy_b0nes I have some Problems w/ Bioware but they Try & TBH I'm 5eva Bioware Trash. EA are sketchy AF & are 100% about the $$$. Sad but unsurprised.

883979530855227392 2017-07-09 09:21:58 UTC <muertaXangela> @twptwit Yikes for people used to the NHS etc. In the US, the bill for those tests would be more like several grand.
883978443284779009 2017-07-09 09:17:39 UTC <muertaXangela> Re: healthcare costs. I'm having a medical for immigration at a private clinic in London. Tests include bloods & x rays. It'll cost me 300.
883976798199062529 2017-07-09 09:11:06 UTC <muertaXangela> @bae_warden Agreeee. I'm GQ AFAB pan (still assumed female) & my current partners are bi cis male & GQ AMAB pan (still assumed male). We're still queer.
883807412632899584 2017-07-08 21:58:02 UTC <muertaXangela> @Galia Depends on my mental state. Frazzled or depressed, clumsy af and then I cry about it. I'm not so bad if it's just anxiety.

883784773470236674 2017-07-08 20:28:04 UTC <muertaXangela> It's very difficult to check for traps and quietly neutralise threats when they insist on Leeroy Jenkinsing it every gorram time.

872363897449304064 2017-06-07 08:05:35 UTC <muertaXangela> But I'm struggling. I need help. And I'm desperately lonely. I just wish I could have someone take care of me for a while.
872363503864164352 2017-06-07 08:04:01 UTC <muertaXangela> (Which I don't blame or begrudge them for, and I wouldn't want any of them feeling bad for needing my help.)
872362907375464448 2017-06-07 08:01:39 UTC <muertaXangela> I'm doing my best but I have fewer & fewer coping mechanisms & resources. And I'm having to be support & help for several other people.
872361156064796672 2017-06-07 07:54:41 UTC <muertaXangela> I need to be asleep before then otherwise the meds I'm on make it impossible for me to function if I have to be up by 8 to dogsit.
872360639183847424 2017-06-07 07:52:38 UTC <muertaXangela> Also "we only get to talk a little bit every night"... I'm 5 hours ahead. It's midnight here when my fiance gets in from work.
872359386118750210 2017-06-07 07:47:39 UTC <muertaXangela> And my last 2 visits were hella stressful because tragedies.
872358970392006659 2017-06-07 07:46:00 UTC <muertaXangela> I'm trying very hard but even if I do everything right to the best of my ability there's no guarantee my visa application will be accepted.
872358542707175426 2017-06-07 07:44:18 UTC <muertaXangela> A month together is not enough time when that might be the only visit of the year. And I'm not sure when this state of affairs will end.
872357407451750401 2017-06-07 07:39:48 UTC <muertaXangela> And if I hear one more "but you're used to it" or "you knew that going in" I'm going to scream and throw something.

829333644942639104 2017-02-08 14:18:43 UTC <muertaXangela> I've missed out on my entire adult life because of my mental illness & its physical issues. I'm sorry 1.5 hours is such a problem for you.
829332724196458497 2017-02-08 14:15:04 UTC <muertaXangela> Have you not considered how achingly lonely I am because of the toll all this has on my friendships? How isolated I am?

829331055433887744 2017-02-08 14:08:26 UTC <muertaXangela> Do you think I get off on cancelling plans or just flat out not making any because I'd probably just have to cancel later?

828577143495987200 2017-02-06 12:12:39 UTC <muertaXangela> I no longer feel defined by what I'm not. People can assume what they like, because (now that I DO know) I know better. I know what I AM.
828575769089736705 2017-02-06 12:07:12 UTC <muertaXangela> I still don't have any strong feelings about pronouns, I'm still perceived as female by pretty much everyone, but I no longer feel lacking.

828573944559067137 2017-02-06 11:59:57 UTC <muertaXangela> Some people don't like labels & that's ok. But learning there's a word for what you are/feel can be so important, freeing, & validating.
828573419394494464 2017-02-06 11:57:51 UTC <muertaXangela> All I knew was what I wasn't, not what I was. I felt disconnected, unable to access shared context. It's very isolating. Alienating.
828571542221123584 2017-02-06 11:50:24 UTC <muertaXangela> Until a few years ago, even all the queers I knew were binary. But me? Didn't feel like a girl, didn't feel like a boy. Not trans. Not cis?
828568560695906305 2017-02-06 11:38:33 UTC <muertaXangela> It took me years to realise that not feeling like a "real girl" was valid, even if I didn't feel like a boy either.

788459307427921920 2016-10-18 19:18:42 UTC <muertaXangela> It has been over 10 years since I last saw my father, and I cannot begin to explain how good that knowledge feels every time I remember.
788447249424670721 2016-10-18 18:30:47 UTC <muertaXangela> I need to do dishes in order to food but I have zero spoons due to The Sick. A queer cannot live by pop tarts alone.
788434103171440640 2016-10-18 17:38:33 UTC <muertaXangela> @Uraharascience Well, yes, but I live alone and have no friends within 100 miles. My attempts to lure brownies continue to be unsuccessful.

750665119231799296 2016-07-06 12:18:05 UTC <muertaXangela> @KeefJudge I have confused multiple Americans with Lambananas. Which may not be their primary purpose but is still an excellent one.

749300401455919104 2016-07-02 17:55:11 UTC <muertaXangela> Episode 49 of #CriticalRole. There's a horrifying appropriateness in saying "I have watched you come" to Scanlan.

748772127566798848 2016-06-30 06:56:01 UTC <muertaXangela> Going home today at some point probably. Should be able to sleep in at least twice and not get bounced all over by licky pups at 7am.
748560393241509888 2016-06-30 16:54:39 UTC <muertaXangela> People keep asking things of me and I can't say no because there's literally nobody else available but I have nothing left to give.

746465407540862976 2016-06-24 22:09:56 UTC <muertaXangela> @RahulKohli13 The pikachu top really adds that something special, I think.
746447733213519872 2016-06-24 20:59:42 UTC <muertaXangela> @LordSteve Okay, white boy. :p But you're doing the dishes and I'd better get lots of cuddles and pets.
746439867274510336 2016-06-24 20:28:27 UTC <muertaXangela> I have the happiest fat. Much needed comfort food. Half a pan of chilli & half a stick of garlic bread left. Sometimes I make good choices?
746436156003328001 2016-06-24 20:13:42 UTC <muertaXangela> @LordSteve I like it with at least a little kick but not so hot that you lose the flavour. But I'll adjust to who I'm making it for.
746429080472453120 2016-06-24 19:45:35 UTC <muertaXangela> @LordSteve Cannot express how much I've needed this comfort food. And I happen to think I make a pretty good chilli.
746425470732767232 2016-06-24 19:31:14 UTC <muertaXangela> For dinner, I have made chilli cheese fries (dairy-free for me, real cheese for Mum & Gary) with homemade dairy-free garlic bread.
746421146304778240 2016-06-24 19:14:03 UTC <muertaXangela> @dancing_robot Whereas I'm an international queer of missed-dairy.
746415377022869504 2016-06-24 18:51:08 UTC <muertaXangela> @LordSteve Personally, I plan to avoid the internet & people in the lead up, during, & after mine, but we all have our traditions.
746414393852731394 2016-06-24 18:47:13 UTC <muertaXangela> Oh yay, stepdad's just got home from Reading for Mum's birthday weekend & they're fighting. Fuck everything about today. I'm trying so hard.
746410278036840448 2016-06-24 18:30:52 UTC <muertaXangela> "It's human nature to hate what's different!" Flying isn't human nature but you keep taking your pasty ass on planes to Benidorm every year.
746391972345163777 2016-06-24 17:18:08 UTC <muertaXangela> Spent all day wanting to go home. Get home to fire alarm beeping, so straight back to Mum's. *sigh* Guess this introvert gets no recovery.
746361315321577472 2016-06-24 15:16:18 UTC <muertaXangela> Awesome(!) I am having a heck of a couple of days. #vaguetweet
746354786090500097 2016-06-24 14:50:22 UTC <muertaXangela> @robwillb I mean, they're kind right? Racism does seem to be one of the main interests of a lot of white people.
746326937061171200 2016-06-24 12:59:42 UTC <muertaXangela> @jephjacques Block the exits. Burn it down.
746326654851649536 2016-06-24 12:58:35 UTC <muertaXangela> "What do experts know?" Turns out, a fucktonne in their particular fields, actually.
746259967536173057 2016-06-24 08:33:35 UTC <muertaXangela> Fucksake. Racism wins and we all fucking lose. Idiots.
746141987582152705 2016-06-23 00:44:47 UTC <muertaXangela> Episode 36 of #CriticalRole was just what I needed after today's crapness. Now I need sleep. Hopefully I won't wake to a fucked UK.
746081192508796928 2016-06-23 20:43:12 UTC <muertaXangela> #iVoted Then had oral surgery. Cried lots as I'm needle phobic & it took several attempts to get the IV in. Curling up w/ more #CriticalRole
745935207023415296 2016-06-23 11:03:06 UTC <muertaXangela>  Bricking it, tbh. This is the closest I can get to neutral face right now. Smiles arent really... https://tmblr.co/ZQ1C1y28JGSPk
745922024451760128 2016-06-23 10:10:43 UTC <muertaXangela> Definitely going to cry, might throw up, hoping I don't assault anyone. I try so hard not to do the latter but I can't control panic.
745921231631822849 2016-06-23 10:07:34 UTC <muertaXangela> I have oral surgery with IV sedation in a couple of hours. Shitting myself about it. I have needle phobia with fight or flight.
745920838495502336 2016-06-23 10:06:01 UTC <muertaXangela> Anxiety dreams all night. I feel sick. Dropping my postal vote in to the polling station soon (Mum said helping me go will get her to vote).
745760044562657280 2016-06-22 23:27:04 UTC <muertaXangela> Episode 35, back at the Sun Tree: I AM EMOTIONALLY COMPROMISED. #CriticalRole #rainingonmyface
745753332233478144 2016-06-22 23:00:24 UTC <muertaXangela> Fuck. I'm officially crushing. Again. #polyproblems
745747183106985984 2016-06-22 22:35:58 UTC <muertaXangela> Esp as I'm a pansexual disaster rogue, & my soul twin's a pansexual disaster ranger. We're (mostly) gender-swapped Vex & Vax. #CriticalRole
745746027697807364 2016-06-22 22:31:22 UTC <muertaXangela> I saw a thing on Tumblr that referred to the twins as "bisexual disasters" and I feel that on a deep spiritual level. #CriticalRole
745740829663297536 2016-06-22 22:10:43 UTC <muertaXangela> Listen, fellow Scousers, The Sun wants everyone to vote Leave tomorrow. Isn't that enough reason for us to vote Remain?
745737387943297024 2016-06-22 21:57:03 UTC <muertaXangela> @KeefJudge I've recently been introduced to Critical Role and it's awesome although emotionally compromising. It's good distraction.
745736538189889537 2016-06-22 21:53:40 UTC <muertaXangela> @Adaser "You're right, his IS no hollaback gnome."
745735039112069125 2016-06-22 21:47:43 UTC <muertaXangela> @Blondoid @Vaughn_Lee See? You admit you're adorable. ^_^
745734857230266368 2016-06-22 21:46:59 UTC <muertaXangela> @KeefJudge Me too, but it's really the IV sedation I'm freaking about. Needle phobia with fight or flight. Hoping I won't assault anyone.
745734598760534016 2016-06-22 21:45:58 UTC <muertaXangela> @Vaughn_Lee @Blondoid Proposal made and seconded.
745734468707713024 2016-06-22 21:45:27 UTC <muertaXangela> Halfway through part 1 of ep35 of #CriticalRole... Haha, nope! But at least I'm anxious about this instead of my oral surgery tomorrow?
745733510414143488 2016-06-22 21:41:38 UTC <muertaXangela> @KeefJudge Fuck you, I have oral surgery tomorrow.
745733361491148801 2016-06-22 21:41:03 UTC <muertaXangela> @Vaughn_Lee You know what else is cute? You two.
745722648920002560 2016-06-22 20:58:29 UTC <muertaXangela> Watched Travis climb the tree in my mum's garden, get stuck halfway up, cling to it looking for options, then just drop. #CatsAreAmazing
745713597666443264 2016-06-22 20:22:31 UTC <muertaXangela> Just finished ep34 of #CriticalRole and... it did not help my anxiety today at all. Maybe the next ep will be nicer to my nerves? #prayforme
745648187713654784 2016-06-22 16:02:36 UTC <muertaXangela> Fun fact: deaf people generally aren't big fans of going to the movies.
745620521061130240 2016-06-22 14:12:39 UTC <muertaXangela> Haha, okay, cool, shaking, that's fun(!) #anxiety

745384881505505280 2016-06-21 22:36:18 UTC <muertaXangela> @KeefJudge NEVAAAR!
745383940798693376 2016-06-21 22:32:34 UTC <muertaXangela> @KeefJudge Given our age difference, it's highly unlikely.
745382322510299136 2016-06-21 22:26:08 UTC <muertaXangela> @KeefJudge YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO YOU'RE NOT MY REAL DAD!
745382130079924224 2016-06-21 22:25:22 UTC <muertaXangela> But I digress. The point is: my hair is fucking ridiculous lately. This information is Vital.
745381072960167936 2016-06-21 22:21:10 UTC <muertaXangela> @WasabiFlux Must. Not. Make. Sex. Joke.
745380808601513984 2016-06-21 22:20:07 UTC <muertaXangela> I got really sick the other week. Mum asked if I was pregnant. Given the last time I had sex, it would've been VERY obvious by then.
745379942242877440 2016-06-21 22:16:41 UTC <muertaXangela> I'd be way happier with my near-constant sex hair lately if I had actually had any sex in the last several months. _
745379392814202880 2016-06-21 22:14:30 UTC <muertaXangela> @WasabiFlux You're way better at this stuff than me. But first: SCIENCE!
745378181495066624 2016-06-21 22:09:41 UTC <muertaXangela> @WasabiFlux That's okay, there will not be pictures of my tum freckle any time soon either.
745351065953046528 2016-06-21 20:21:56 UTC <muertaXangela> Welp. Just tried to stand but I'd pinned myself by sitting on my own hair. It's like 2 inches above my knees. That might be too much hair?
745349716444090368 2016-06-21 20:16:34 UTC <muertaXangela> @jephjacques I feel like Boris is controlled by the same species of entity as the one that sits on Trump's head and drives his meat suit.
745348500133675009 2016-06-21 20:11:44 UTC <muertaXangela> @WasabiFlux I bet they're super cute. Peppered with sun kisses. So adorable. <3
745308426302005248 2016-06-21 17:32:30 UTC <muertaXangela> I might be having a slight "cute tum" moment? There's a freckle on my belly that's kinda cute maybe?
745301391476948992 2016-06-21 17:04:33 UTC <muertaXangela> Anxiety so bad I feel sick. Time to curl up with executive dysfunction and #CriticalRole.
745173437920874496 2016-06-21 08:36:06 UTC <muertaXangela> Got a "not to worry" but still feel like a piece of shit. Crying and sleeping are currently non-negotiable though so I better go do those.
745172123610546177 2016-06-21 08:30:53 UTC <muertaXangela> Fully expect to be told either outright or in a roundabout way that I'm selfish and should do the thing anyway.
745171739307433988 2016-06-21 08:29:21 UTC <muertaXangela> Cue feeling like a complete dickhead and a flake because I'm asking for the space to put my needs first instead of doing what people want.
745163608984694784 2016-06-21 07:57:03 UTC <muertaXangela> Plus I haven't slept yet because of recovery & anxiety sleep patterns clashing. Was just about to crash out when I got the message.
745162545162444802 2016-06-21 07:52:49 UTC <muertaXangela> 4 days doesn't cover a 3 month spoon deficit, but I'd PLANNED for 4 days of Recovery & suddenly ending it on day 3 makes a BIG difference.
745161431725707264 2016-06-21 07:48:24 UTC <muertaXangela> I haven't slept yet & I was REALLY counting on getting more rest today. I have oral surgery on Thursday & needle phobia means super anxiety.
745161057413402624 2016-06-21 07:46:55 UTC <muertaXangela> Apparently 4 days of recovery after 3 months of near-constant peopling & being carer was too much to ask for. Day 3: Surprise! I'm needed.
745156154901225475 2016-06-21 07:27:26 UTC <muertaXangela> @Abashima It was so good! I cried.
745146406206267392 2016-06-20 06:48:42 UTC <muertaXangela> @sandyd68 What a tosser.
745129621448859650 2016-06-20 05:42:00 UTC <muertaXangela> America is TERRIFYING! Why do I even want to move to that stupid bloody country? *sigh* 'Cause most of the people I care about are there...
745128701281525760 2016-06-20 05:38:20 UTC <muertaXangela> @WasabiFlux Seriously, everything about America is terrifying. How bad are the earthquakes?
745126817191727104 2016-06-20 05:30:51 UTC <muertaXangela> @WasabiFlux @splunge2000 NOPE. 70 is very warm to me. Much more than that is getting into Melty Jen territory.
745124919529246720 2016-06-20 05:23:19 UTC <muertaXangela> @GigawattConduit Hearing the voices of friends is one of my favourites, but it is on occasion weird and hilarious.
745124444520095744 2016-06-20 05:21:25 UTC <muertaXangela> @WasabiFlux @splunge2000 How hot are we talking?
745121690112262146 2016-06-20 05:10:29 UTC <muertaXangela> @WasabiFlux From what I hear, Oregon is similar in climate to the UK? Would that be safe?
745117692458242048 2016-06-20 04:54:36 UTC <muertaXangela> @WasabiFlux But doesn't that mean worse damage from hurricanes? America is terrifying. Please all come move to a safe island with me?
745116338549448704 2016-06-20 04:49:13 UTC <muertaXangela> @WasabiFlux Well, fuck. I guess I'll just have to melt into human goo?
745115564905947137 2016-06-20 04:46:08 UTC <muertaXangela> Wait... Heat can cause power outage? That's a thing? Cool, just another thing for me to fret about with American summers if I move. Awesome.
745114960611545088 2016-06-20 04:43:44 UTC <muertaXangela> @VoiceOfOBrien Wait... Heat can cause power outage? That's a thing? #ConfusedBrit
745101318755213312 2016-06-20 03:49:32 UTC <muertaXangela> @splunge2000 If I sneeze all at once I get painful sinus pressure that takes ages to stop, it's fine if I can catch it and break it into 3s.
745099298862358528 2016-06-20 03:41:30 UTC <muertaXangela> @splunge2000 I sneeze in threes and it's high pitched and squeaky and f**king ridiculous.
745098057717547010 2016-06-20 03:36:34 UTC <muertaXangela> @splunge2000 My sneeze is embarrassing. I once sneezed in a car park and a guy thought someone had run over a bunch of mice.

745047554853842948 2016-06-20 00:15:54 UTC <muertaXangela> From what I've seen so far and from what I've gleaned from other #Critters, this is #CriticalRole in a nutshell:pic.twitter.com/t7boAvJ5gn
745043501843419136 2016-06-20 23:59:47 UTC <muertaXangela> @matthewmercer @Day11J It's just an expression. However I'm still steeling myself ready to suffer. While highly entertained, but crying.
745038914071724032 2016-06-20 23:41:33 UTC <muertaXangela> I'm only on episode 30 of #CriticalRole so far, but I've been warned that @matthewmercer is the devil and it's only going to get worse.
745037966834286592 2016-06-20 23:37:48 UTC <muertaXangela> The real world continues to be absolute trash, I'm going to curl up in bed with more #CriticalRole for my solstice self care.

745032436879327232 2016-06-20 23:15:49 UTC <muertaXangela> It's background checks though. It's not even a ban.
745030830846844928 2016-06-20 23:09:26 UTC <muertaXangela> @RahulKohli13 Honestly, I have a lot of American friends & the Americans I personally know are great, but the USA scares the crap out of me.

699300748530679808 2016-02-15 18:34:25 UTC <muertaXangela> @seananmcguire Yay! Sometimes my brain'll kind of slide off the bits I'd panic over if it has other things to focus on so I thought I'd ask.
699299132440256513 2016-02-15 18:28:00 UTC <muertaXangela> @seananmcguire What if it's sandwiched between other things? "I love your cat tweets, your work, and your general dorkiness"?
699293597988995072 2016-02-15 18:06:00 UTC <muertaXangela> Why even pretend it has anything to do with what that person wants? You know what you're going to do, why not just tell them your decision?
699293321810866176 2016-02-15 18:04:54 UTC <muertaXangela> Why ask the same thing over and over until the person gives in and tells you the answer you want to hear?
699293024694767616 2016-02-15 18:03:43 UTC <muertaXangela> Why ask what someone wants when you're just going to do what you want anyway?

693534561846820866 2016-01-30 20:41:39 UTC <muertaXangela> Poor Sophie! But now I wonder what my voice seems like to my American friends... #TheRashomonJob #Leverage
693454611072565248 2016-01-30 15:23:57 UTC <muertaXangela> Them: This game is adorable and terrifying Me: Everything I aspire to be.
693447084888956928 2016-01-30 14:54:03 UTC <muertaXangela> Can't tell if this fight between Hardison and Eliot is part of the con or just Hardison fucking with Eliot. #Leverage
693445525891371008 2016-01-30 14:47:51 UTC <muertaXangela> "OHHHHH! ELIOT's the fiddle! We sold Eliot to Kirkwood! I TOTALLY get this!" I love you, Parker. <3 #Leverage
693434627197894656 2016-01-30 14:04:33 UTC <muertaXangela> Oh good! They didn't make Hardison a clueless idiot or pushy! Well done everyone involved in that! #TheyreRightHereWhenYouWantThem #Leverage
693422759418990592 2016-01-30 13:17:23 UTC <muertaXangela> A medical company called Pallogen sounds too much like "pathogen" to me... #Leverage
693181619935547393 2016-01-29 21:19:11 UTC <muertaXangela> @KittasaurusRex I appreciate it.
693180069985030145 2016-01-29 21:13:02 UTC <muertaXangela> Dang, Hardison... #Leverage #TheScheherazadeJob
693127292923551744 2016-01-29 17:43:18 UTC <muertaXangela> Yup, there's the mental health crash I was waiting for.
693113979523207169 2016-01-29 16:50:24 UTC <muertaXangela> An ego boost and an easy lay. If I didn't have all these pesky emotions and opinions, I'd be the perfect woman, right?
693064986277625856 2016-01-29 13:35:43 UTC <muertaXangela> 1st day alone since Sept was spent in the bathroom, then sipping water & nibbling dry bread. Today I've progressed to beans on toast in bed.
692834474988441602 2016-01-28 22:19:45 UTC <muertaXangela> From a fic, Garrus comments on chastity belts: Look, I get this is barbaric. Im outraged... I also really like that one there. Same.
692312532120408064 2016-01-27 11:45:44 UTC <muertaXangela> Skittles for breakfast, because I am a godsdamn adult.
692285820473118720 2016-01-27 09:59:36 UTC <muertaXangela> IDK what kind of allergy makes you break out in plaid shirts.
692110252607684618 2016-01-26 22:21:57 UTC <muertaXangela> Sometimes being a jerk is the least jerky thing to do.
692108223051120644 2016-01-26 22:13:53 UTC <muertaXangela> @ShoalsOfDust If I make you hate me, you won't be sad to go.
692106107498713088 2016-01-26 22:05:29 UTC <muertaXangela> @ShoalsOfDust Then aren't you lucky you'll be rid of me in less than 2 hours?
692102358059319299 2016-01-26 21:50:35 UTC <muertaXangela> .@ShoalsOfDust: That's funny but gross. Me: Name of your sex tape?

691743211770023937 2016-01-25 22:03:28 UTC <muertaXangela> The actual /travel/ parts of travelling kind of suck, to be honest. #ForeverInTransit
691742901668311040 2016-01-25 22:02:14 UTC <muertaXangela> What I'm mostly looking forward to at the moment though is getting off this damn bus.
691742604581588992 2016-01-25 22:01:03 UTC <muertaXangela> I love @ShoalsOfDust. Of course I do. He's one of my best friends and boyfriends. But I'm really looking forward to some time by myself.
691564559748972544 2016-01-25 10:13:34 UTC <muertaXangela> The day of her dad's funeral, some dick comes in demanding money/the pub. She wouldn't cower, she'd get pissed off & stay like it. #Leverage
691563690085236736 2016-01-25 10:10:07 UTC <muertaXangela> Frankly, with the arsehole that close afterwards, she should've kneed him in the bollocks or nutted him. #Leverage
691562888893431808 2016-01-25 10:06:55 UTC <muertaXangela> When you're that close & the target is flanked by cronies, you don't use a wide swing. An Irish woman would've known this. #Leverage

691293534901633024 2016-01-24 16:16:36 UTC <muertaXangela> Sarah Palin is basically a Mommy Blogger turned politician.
691027585048911872 2016-01-23 22:39:49 UTC <muertaXangela> Just spent the last 15 minutes wrestling, laughing helplessly, and yelling "say it like a lungfish!" at @ShoalsOfDust.
691006623184195584 2016-01-23 21:16:31 UTC <muertaXangela> .@ShoalsOfDust said I looked like a handsome boy the last couple of days. *preens*

690954886511484931 2016-01-23 17:50:56 UTC <muertaXangela> Them: A two story restaurant? Don't the mean two storey? Me: As long as it's not a Tolstoy restaurant you should be fine.
690952250269777920 2016-01-23 17:40:28 UTC <muertaXangela> Took @ShoalsOfDust on the @MerseyFerries this afternoon, then grabbed a (bunless in my case) bite at @FiveGuysUK before heading back.
690637168251949056 2016-01-22 20:48:26 UTC <muertaXangela> .@ShoalsOfDust says I wouldn't look good w/ a beard, but IDK man have you seen me w/ @DasUmlaut? (This was a joke about how I'm super gay.)
690498718022369281 2016-01-22 11:38:17 UTC <muertaXangela> It's a good face and all, it's just... not Jim? Which is kind of true? I don't wanna spoil too much if you haven't read it, so go read it k?
690497097708236800 2016-01-22 11:31:51 UTC <muertaXangela> Rereading http://www.skindeepcomic.com (which I itch for whenever I'm in Liverpool now - thanks, @korybing) & it's weird seeing Jim's human face.

689950223750295552 2016-01-20 23:18:46 UTC <muertaXangela> I had this stuck in my head randomly. Probably @LordSteve's fault. *shakes fist* Steve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FArZxLj6DLk
