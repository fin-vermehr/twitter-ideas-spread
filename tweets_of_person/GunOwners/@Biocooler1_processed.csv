Target is on essentially every solid tumor and every normal tissue - not exactly low hanging fruit for the probody approach, but if it works it will be huge.

The potential Allergan M&A premium for $DERM just went way down - so the hyperhidrosis drug would have to represent a big threat to Botox for $AGN to be interested.  Not many other likely big pharma acquirers.

Of course - should be in the IC/IB, and that is likey what FDA clinical hold was for (pause study until new IC/IB are created).  Disclose to the public? No - all that matters ethically is the pts/docs know, not journalists/future investors.

Not sure why market is stuck on importance of ALDR making a distant 4th to market subQ. IV is differentiated and will be a blockbuster by itself. Strong M&A potential
