975521998431576064 2018-03-18 23:59:03 UTC <Climbthat> Wow, watched 60 Minutes interview with Parkland students who demand (unconstitutional) laws passed. They use the exact same lame, decades old talking points used by Democrats.   Ignoring these adolescents is advisable.

975522217399345152 2018-03-18 23:59:55 UTC <AdamAddict> I have such respect for the kids from MSD High School in Parkland on @60Minutes. They're all so impressive, with such maturity and intelligence!!!!! They make Trump and Republicans look like uncaring idiots. #NeverAgain
975522208310276098 2018-03-18 23:59:53 UTC <GayConservativ3> but its okay for the Dems and David Hogg to raise money off Parkland.  Got it. https://twitter.com/Bakari_Sellers/status/975420608820449282
975522199066021889 2018-03-18 23:59:51 UTC <gabrielmalor> People are focusing on this latest bit of information that the Parkland shooting could have been prevented.   It's more than that, though. His mental state both at the time of the shooting and after will play a role in both his trial and any sentence that he may receive. https://twitter.com/jpaceDC/status/975432372056416257
975522172964831232 2018-03-18 23:59:45 UTC <technolibrary> One minute into the 60 minutes segment about Parkland and I'm already tearing up.  Ss looks just like my nephew.  That is WHY I am determined #neveragain #msdstrong @AMarch4OurLives #marchforourlives
975522158272303106 2018-03-18 23:59:41 UTC <forsie> These kids from Parkland give me so much hope for the future. I also want to hug all of them and tell them its going to be OK. But is it? #60Minutes
975522144955355138 2018-03-18 23:59:38 UTC <WJCondonJr> Ok @60Minutes that segment on the Parkland kids was fine. When will you show the segment on the kids who think gun control -what ever that is - is not the answer?

975522135476236292 2018-03-18 23:59:36 UTC <TheBossman102> Parkland school kids on the #60Minutes fluff piece ... strange how @KyleKashuv wasn't part of it. Guessing @CBS has an agenda.
975522130174599168 2018-03-18 23:59:34 UTC <60Minutes> "We're the mass shooting generation." Why do these Parkland, Florida, students believe their generation will succeed in changing gun laws, including a ban on military-style rifles? http://cbsn.ws/2DGAYxWpic.twitter.com/rYcmLGFjy5

975522120036962305 2018-03-18 23:59:32 UTC <JPaps_> I seriously admire how @cameron_kasky left the interview on 60 minutes for a family dinner. Shows that these young men and women from Parkland are just trying to be normal people. 
975522097995943937 2018-03-18 23:59:27 UTC <PaulInk911> @60Minutes Broward Sheriff Scott Israel needs to be fired, total incompetence, & a complete failure at his job, no accountability, he has turned his agency into a political mess, where was his sworn Duty to Act #firesheriffisrael #firescottisrael #parkland #browardcounty #NRApic.twitter.com/D6I3B70YiG
975522093180874752 2018-03-18 23:59:25 UTC <legitdanielle> @MiamiHEAT it would be a great idea to print & sell those Parkland Strong shirts and donate the money to the fund...just saying
975522092782415872 2018-03-18 23:59:25 UTC <RShaffer1> 60 Minutes interview w/gun control teens from Parkland -- they MAY be a bit nave, but I give them A LOT of credit, and they MAY actually get something solid done. "Greater Fool" theory. They don't know what they can't do, so, maybe, they'll actually do it.
