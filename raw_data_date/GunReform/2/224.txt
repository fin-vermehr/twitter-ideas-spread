967548057301663746 2018-02-24 23:53:27 UTC <kdqcof> @NRA @Chadwick_Moore @PaulGrimm20 I get your point. Keep it away from grandkids. Stop ridiculous threats. Gun reform needs to encompass thorough background checks on EVERY Gun sale. No private sales. Restricted access of any semi-automatic & large mags. Shouldnt be your right, but a well-earned privileged.

I want to see an end to this madness in the US where kids are getting shot at in schools for no particular reason.  #GunReform #NeverAgain

Which dumbass sold a murder weapon to a maniac simply because he had no record but had money? Clearly that's no longer enough to trust a stranger with a weapon with the power to kill a human with the flick of a finger. #GunReform
