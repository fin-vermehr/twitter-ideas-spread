975387373788958720 2018-03-18 15:04:06 UTC <JustinSayfie> @AlCardenasFL_DC So its not a question of whether there are politics in any decision made by DOJ, its just a question of whose politics. Someone who is accountable to the people of the country, or someone who is not. This is also true of every executive branch agency. Not just DOJ.
975386898351972352 2018-03-18 15:02:13 UTC <JustinSayfie> @AlCardenasFL_DC I think it is wrong to assume that Justice can only be dispensed fairly if the DOJ is unaccountable to the President. No person in government is apolitical. No one. Theres politics EVERYWHERE. Thats not a condemnation. Its just a reflection of human nature.

The FL Legislature attempted to create an exemption years ago, but they screwed up the definition of hairbraiding, rendering the exemption practically worthless. #Sayfie #HairBraiding #EconomicLiberty
