973710159368376320 2018-03-13 23:59:27 UTC <givebreadsticks> @RollingStone @rogman91 Dude you may not like them but they are doing something for gun control. Whether you like it or not kids are going to school daily in fear of their safety. Theyre doing something to help those kids so can you leave them be?
973710130926751744 2018-03-13 23:59:20 UTC <brainoutREAD> @crash2000J @BetoORourke Gun control started as Soviet Propaganda in the 1930s. Being in Texas, you should know that. So to holler Gun Control, makes you seem a Commie.  Better to have LICENSING and GUN ED in schools, where all get LICENSED, to address the MOTIVE, not the weapon. That should please Dems.

973710048848326657 2018-03-13 23:59:00 UTC <buck_man714> @SpeakerRyan No. Just no. We have other issues that need our attention. Stop being a flag waving twit and address the serious issues in our country. Homeless. Gun control. Equality. Low wages. Job training. Global warming. Student debt. Youre completely out of touch.

973709885132214272 2018-03-13 23:58:21 UTC <dezzymarieee> @shontayromey But isn't the walkout supporting tighter gun control in order to help prevent further shootings? So wouldn't someone who wants more gun control want to participate?

973709763849617408 2018-03-13 23:57:53 UTC <ljf1183> @DwyaneWade @wsvn @itsgabrielleu the writer needs to have a grammar check because "student -ran," is inappropriate. The tweet should read "@itsgabrielleu  donated $200,000 to student -lead gun control rally." Grammar is important to readers
