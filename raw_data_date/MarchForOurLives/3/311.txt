972984213850001408 2018-03-11 23:54:48 UTC <japalian7> You are absolutely right! MSM helped spread the hate by covering @realDonaldTrump ad nauseam and helped get him elected. He IS crazy like fox, and figured out the more outlandish he was, the more coverage he got! #BlueTsunami2018 #The #ResistanceVOTES #MarchForOurLives NYC https://twitter.com/atDavidHoffman/status/972821400464646144

972984868404649984 2018-03-11 23:57:24 UTC <Qynton> Don't be fooled by this #MarchForOurLives. They don't want to help keep our kids safe. They want to strip our 2nd Amendment and leave us defenseless like other corrupt countries. That's their goal.
