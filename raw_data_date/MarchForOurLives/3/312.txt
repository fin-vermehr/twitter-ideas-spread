973347512043167744 2018-03-12 23:58:25 UTC <prepostmeltdown> @Slate Congress is irrelevant on the gun issue.  The action is happening at the State and local levels.  #MarchForOurLives and perhpas Congress will notice, but don't worry if it doesn't, just #VoteThemOut
973347481713979393 2018-03-12 23:58:18 UTC <raya_luv> @FoxNews @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse @KyleKashuv This is disappointing, from you and from FLOTUS.  The constitution also means the right to put views and this march was intended to protect you too. Sad to see you sell yourself out this way and divide the already hurt student body. I wont be following you. #marchforourlives
