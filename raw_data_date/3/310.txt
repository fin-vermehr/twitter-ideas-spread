This debate is giving me a fucking aneurysm. The problem isn't the 99%, it's the 1% that can cause serious damage. Unfortunately, whether you ass hats like it or not, a gun reform need to happen.

972621927004110848 2018-03-10 23:55:12 UTC <tuned_z> I think its funny that the Gen X and Baby Boomers are so quick to yell at kids and their cellphones when these kids are about to do more for gun reform and gun control then those generations combined #mowyourdamnlawn #sitthehelldown #youcreatedtheproblem #wewillfixit
972621712700289024 2018-03-10 23:54:21 UTC <davidsmosspiggy> @Emma4Change @reillyda57 Indeed. Other advanced countries brought in sensible gun reform after gun massacres that stopped them. Its all about what kind of society you want. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bX4qUsgHa4Y

Is my and everyone else's right less important than others ? #NeverAgain #GunReform #ParklandStudents #Trump #NRA #AR15s
972621481921466371 2018-03-10 23:53:26 UTC <Barbara80014143> @KyleKashuv @cameron_kasky @UKrazyFan @AllyClaxton @That_Jon_Guy @ConservativeAn4 Research research research: people are not trying to take your gun away. Sensible gun reform is needed. Elevate purchase age, increase wait periods, background checks, gun show loopholes, PFA orders must include gun bans for partners & spouses. Weapon removals if mental illness.
