975880480171200512 2018-03-19 23:43:32 UTC <lawfeettoo> @KenidraRWoods_ @lexforchange One more time for the folks in the back: Gun reform is not equivalent to banning all guns.
975880104604676098 2018-03-19 23:42:02 UTC <MatthewGRoy> Looking forward, organizers said they will not stop fighting for gun reform, continuing a wave of youth activism... https://fb.me/YNzCNoMN
975880075454246914 2018-03-19 23:41:55 UTC <thVictoriousDID> @lexforchange It's your account, tweet about whatever the heck you want to tweet about! If you tweeted only about gun reform, someone would criticize. People are going to complain no matter what you say or do, so you might as well do what makes you happy and be yourself! We love you!
975879621487898625 2018-03-19 23:40:07 UTC <DailyNewsSun> From @PhilipHaldiman and @mwcarlisle - Being heard: Students fight for gun reform through action, plan more protests @PeoriaPanthers @TheMRHS https://yourvalley.net/yourvalley/news/being-heard-students-fight-for-gun-reform-through-action/
975879403858046976 2018-03-19 23:39:15 UTC <demfeexuns> @NRA @marklevinsdome @write_cabin Both but Ill cut 2 the chase gun reform is on its way.  Min age raised to 21 and universal background , waiting periods will be reqd.  No gun show loopholes.  This is coming from a concealed handgun carrier, owner of handguns, suppressors & AR-15 platforms etc.  Fuck the NRA
975879373688623104 2018-03-19 23:39:08 UTC <EatLegendary> why is the gun reform even a question?! protect lives not guns!!  #enoughisenoughhttps://fb.me/TW0gvnkx
975878941880832000 2018-03-19 23:37:25 UTC <marciafvilas> @tedcruz And still no word about gun reform laws.
975878690461581313 2018-03-19 23:36:25 UTC <Alejandro_R_E_R> Comprehensive gun reform that promotes safety and security while preserving the rights and protections warranted by the 2nd Amendment. @marcorubio @FLGovScott @RosLehtinen
975878636778729473 2018-03-19 23:36:12 UTC <Chaseshaw530> @Emma4Change You use your platform for nothing. You bullied this kid. That's the real issue. Gun reform will help but people like you is the issue.
975878386815066113 2018-03-19 23:35:13 UTC <DeitschFactor> @lexforchange Somebody's got to fight for the fetuses' right to live!  Of course, once born, it is all on them. Health care? Should have put money into a health savings account while in the womb. Gun reform? Gotta' wait 50 years to learn about life.  #TimesUpGOP #VoteThemAllOut
975877414470299648 2018-03-19 23:31:21 UTC <Dcwriley> @Guntalk @goat_path @Overmarshall Its almost as if the facts and evidence are biased towards gun reform?
