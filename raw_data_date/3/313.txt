973709810138050560 2018-03-13 23:58:04 UTC <ProgressOutlook> The NRA doesn't care about American lives. They should not be bottlenecking gun reform.

973709461138354176 2018-03-13 23:56:40 UTC <anticapyoongi> i keep going back and forth between hating myself and telling myself that everything is okay with my grade. i know i'll get 100 on my next quiz, and there's still a discussion he hasn't graded yet. so if i get a B or greater for my discussion, it'll bring my grade up to a B.
973709382159601664 2018-03-13 23:56:22 UTC <NilsW12> @SpeakerRyan @sevier_james @IronStache No he isnt. And he never will be. You want gun reform? Vote them out, and change campaign financing laws. Thats it. 50% of Americans dont vote. So go out and make them.

Yes, it'll be a gazillion point gap from whatever % trump got but I really, REALLY need a win. It's for morale. I'll be really sad if Lamb loses, even by 1 point. Yes, I know, illogical. But I will be.

Please call your state Senator and ask him/her to vote to #OverrideRauner #twill @MomsDemand
973709877829947392 2018-03-13 23:58:20 UTC <JeffEKahn> @Bill_Seitz He's not necessarily completely pro-life. Pro 2nd Amendment but supports reasonable gun reform that doesn't infringe on the rights of law abiding gun owners. Also isn't completely anti-Pelosi (but I like that he's willing to oppose her because she's horrible)
