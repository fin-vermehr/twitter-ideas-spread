974434190748876800 2018-03-15 23:56:29 UTC <SolarisRex> I'd like to remind everyone that there are only 3 amendments in the Bill of Rights that are FULLY incorporated against the states through the 14th amendment; the 1st, 2nd & 4th. This means the states MUST abide by them. #guns #NRA #GunControl #GunReform #GunLawsNOW #GunSenseNowpic.twitter.com/A62dTTs21x

974434082380763137 2018-03-15 23:56:04 UTC <melina_0418> I'm hearing a lot of questions about why people walked out, and I'm tired of having to answer them. MY question now is why don't you support gun reform? Please enlighten to your perspective and beliefs because I have spent a long time explaining mine. #changetheconversation
974433918622617600 2018-03-15 23:55:24 UTC <ston3lis3k> @stingwray35 @Hanwilbs Nobody is trying to take your guns away everyone understands it's impossible and wrong to ditch second amendment. Not once have a said take guns away, I want to see gun reform and actually want to see people get education on firearms and tighter regulation.

974433679798931457 2018-03-15 23:54:28 UTC <DomManns> @WadeC99 @wardaallen Of course, but why do you speak as though its either/or. We need gun reform now, so when a kid is in crisi, they dont have access to weapons that can assasinate their classmates.
