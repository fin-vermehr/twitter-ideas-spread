972260139372720128 2018-03-09 23:57:35 UTC <YvonneP22> @cameron_kasky Keep up the pressure, young man! Don't ever stop, even when the media loses interest. We, the American people, ARE and will CONTINUE TO BE interested and fully vested in this fight for gun reform!
972260073820033024 2018-03-09 23:57:19 UTC <frosty121b> NRA files lawsuit over Florida gun control law http://a.msn.com/01/en-us/BBK47r3?ocid=st Aww, the NRA is not happy with Florida.  If more and more states pass more gun reform, the NRA won't have the $ to buy politicians...it will all go out to lawyers...lol.
972260014919471104 2018-03-09 23:57:05 UTC <Dr42282466> Trump  must be recognized for what he isn't.  Trump has gone in bankruptcy 4, he has no proven bargaining skills, he has sabatoged daca, gun reform, and  continues to attempt to dismantle democracy. https://twitter.com/Amy_Siskind/status/972256039948181505

972259163022807040 2018-03-09 23:53:42 UTC <brianclarkson5> Because reasonable gun reform, even a watered down variety, is too much to ask for these heartless people.
