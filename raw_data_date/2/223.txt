967185819919269888 2018-02-23 23:54:03 UTC <TucsonVoice28> @thehill @SebringRacing I think the NRA is going to hide their money through another source/ SuperPac and give it to Republicans. Regardless the evidence Republicans change of heart is: Gun Reform bill's pass. if they don't pass bills.  #VoteThemOut regardless we don't need any flip-floppers. #BlueWave
967187300156301313 2018-02-23 23:59:56 UTC <mrshobobaggins> The NRA has always been shit. If for some stupid reason you still belong to them, you need to rethink your priorities.  Children are always more important.  Your guns are not the future, children are.  #fuckthenra #GunReform #NRAKillsKids

967187013731483648 2018-02-23 23:58:48 UTC <Gold_Standard17> @JeffEisenband I agree bullying and mental health are issues, but lets not make him a victim. This is an unbelievably selfish and cowardly post by him.  My question is how does HE get his hands on a gun? #mentalhealth #GunReform #notavictim
967186996798959616 2018-02-23 23:58:44 UTC <IvoGary> Thank God for our courageous young people. They saved us during  the civil rights era, Vietnam and now gun reform. A child will lead them!
