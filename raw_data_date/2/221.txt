966462508432175104 2018-02-21 23:59:52 UTC <rychemom> @realDonaldTrump we noticed you didn't invite any of the students that spoke out for gun reform YOU don't get credit for listening until you are required to sit in the high school gym  with an open MIC that ANY student can speak up at sorry you only had another photo op https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/966425806607212545
966462499469119488 2018-02-21 23:59:50 UTC <FelicityWoodman> @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr this is not how we make America great. This is selfish foolish wasteful tragedy. The American public hates the stranglehold of the NRA. We want gun reform and restrictions. Hear us! Do something. https://twitter.com/felicitywoodman/status/966448801396510720
966462440962772993 2018-02-21 23:59:36 UTC <youputz> @TrumpPrisonDate @counterchekist Gun reform for the wall?
966462424340729856 2018-02-21 23:59:32 UTC <ChereeFranco> These kids, y'all. The internet raised them well. #digitalnatives #organize #resist #occupygeneration #gunreform #nomore #SchoolShootingshttps://twitter.com/CNN/status/966459359831130112
966462393642491904 2018-02-21 23:59:25 UTC <TheeEdge> The complicit @NRA has already scoffed at the idea of raising the minimum age to buy a gun from 18-21. #gunreform #unacceptable
966462266030747649 2018-02-21 23:58:54 UTC <kaylaadahl> Ive been applying to Masters programs to become a teacher. I LOVE teaching.  The possibility of forcibly being armed as a teacher is seriously making me rethink it all. I was okay being paid next to nothing and buying supplies. But this is ridiculous. #GunReform #ArmTeachers
966462239799697408 2018-02-21 23:58:48 UTC <SenatorPackwood> Liberals are so angry b/c Trump has a free flow of ideas w/ both sides. Dems only want to hear their side of the issue. Sorry Dems that's not how adults solve problems.Thanks DJT. #ParklandStudentsSpeak #StudentsDemandAction #MomsDemandAction #MomsDemand #Parkland #GunReform #NRApic.twitter.com/NfDYQXPzMQ
966462090612432896 2018-02-21 23:58:13 UTC <wicked_apples> Some of my friends work with literal newborns. Do you think they wanna be armed around a 6 week old?? We need gun reform and we need it NOW #ParklandStudentsSpeak
966462083146633216 2018-02-21 23:58:11 UTC <j_asp7> Cause we need Gun Reform... more restrictions , accessibility and educations on guns ! We need a change !!! https://www.marchforourlives.com
966461935737884673 2018-02-21 23:57:36 UTC <saysaysarita> I listen to a Spanish news podcast and even they cast shade at Cheeto for not mentioning gun reform at all when addressing the Parkland shooting. They brought up that mass shootings dont happen in Latin America.  
966461817508777984 2018-02-21 23:57:07 UTC <m_barrettt> I believe we need #GunReform and #schoolsafety NOW. I dont know what that looks like, but its time to come together and figure it out.
966461807132073984 2018-02-21 23:57:05 UTC <CNNSitRoom> On the heels of losing 17 of their fellow students and staff, Florida students have come out in unprecedented numbers to demand gun reform from lawmakers http://snpy.tv/2ooN5txhttp://cnn.it/2EIHsBE
966461805039116288 2018-02-21 23:57:04 UTC <CityNews> Why are we not protecting our children? Hundreds of students flood Florida capital to demand gun reform - WATCH: http://ow.ly/8W6C30ixEYP @meldugpic.twitter.com/FwJLlI9dBi
966461722474270720 2018-02-21 23:56:45 UTC <Bad_Writer0111> Pat mentioning some sort of gun reform..?! Wondering if his recent stroke shook something loose? #tytlive
966461649971499009 2018-02-21 23:56:27 UTC <Jambox7> @CNNPolitics Great meeting Mr. President. True leadership. Now let's get down to some sort of gun reform very soon. Todays' meeting was productive and somewhat therapeutic for some. A great first step, without question. Nobody with a modicum of sense could deny that.
966461627569614848 2018-02-21 23:56:22 UTC <Danalynnex> @verified @jack @Twitter @davidhogg111 @RealCandaceO Correction, I think you meant to say, "He is another VICTIM of yet another mass shooting. It's completely understandable he wants gun reform, as anyone would want change after that kind of trauma."
