975412796560232451 2018-03-18 16:45:07 UTC <peacebestill709> No Nikki, this is not acceptable. Im so sorry sweetheart.   Every student in every school must feel safe in their learning environment. Im a gun owner. Laws to carry are NOT to take away #2ndAmendment rights, but to safeguard use. Big difference!   #gunreform #neveragainhttps://twitter.com/nikta04/status/974440273576050688

I personally dont care about guns. I have none. I do care about a solution. If I thought banning AR 15s was the solution, I would quickly agree, but it wont happen, nor if it would it wouldnt help anything
975411417175199746 2018-03-18 16:39:38 UTC <deenosaurr007> When you post something about gun reform and your trump supporter friends come out of the woodworks to try you. Bitch , dont come for me if I dont call for you. Pass me with that bullshit.

975410991017193472 2018-03-18 16:37:57 UTC <bankerkam> @NewPghCourier I don't know. I grew up in Jersey City in tge 1970's we didn't have cops or guns in school and no one was shot to death there. Maybe if we remove the weapon from the equation maybe we'll have different results. #GunReform
975410842207318018 2018-03-18 16:37:21 UTC <allisonleucadia> @FBI @MyFLFamilies @browardsheriff @browardschools @MzPoliTweetz An assault weapon killed them. A knife wouldnt have. Common sense gun reform would have prevented him from acquiring a weapon designed for WAR.

975408843441270784 2018-03-18 16:29:25 UTC <vegeta_gg42> @DocThompsonShow Because he needs a basic education before college.  Didn't he drop out of school until gun reform is passed?
975408301583118336 2018-03-18 16:27:15 UTC <chuzyrf8> As I contemplate escalation to a #generalstrike suggested by a local teacher, it seems imperative, right? I've said I'd do anything for my children and others' as well. Did I mean it? #enough #gunreform #gunviolencehttps://twitter.com/lanemurdock2002/status/975373136911880194

975407008525451265 2018-03-18 16:22:07 UTC <GoldenRosaye> this current gun reform is being orchestrated by the nazi-british empire in preparation of the incoming false flag event to blame on iran/russia
975406907321147394 2018-03-18 16:21:43 UTC <SandyHookCenTer> @SenMikeLee in theory yes...  Any and everyone couldve acted prior to the Parkland shooter.  HWVR, any conversation that DSNT equate to gun reform is offensive.  If you will not support common sense gun control, YOU WILL BE VOTED OUT.  Its our only mission now.

975405628599480321 2018-03-18 16:16:38 UTC <artemisnee> Id like to ask those who support #walkupnotout. 1. Why we cant focus on anti bullying AND gun reform. And 2. Do you support then, money being put into anti bullying programs in schools? More counselors in schools?

975404540928450560 2018-03-18 16:12:19 UTC <amberissmiling> @king_of_bob @TAG1031 1) Your car probably wont fit in your bedroom. 2) What if theres more than one attacker? 3) You have to be dangerously close to an attacker to use a knife/hammer. Im actually down with gun reform, but silly memes that make no sense are probably not the best way to make a point
975403950294929408 2018-03-18 16:09:58 UTC <SandyHookCenTer> @SenJohnKennedy your arrogance too is offensive.  Its not about who did what...  ie., your @cspan performance.  Its about gun reform.   And if you will not join us, you will be voted out at next election.
